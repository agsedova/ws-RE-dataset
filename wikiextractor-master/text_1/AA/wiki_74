S. Lewis's children's epic fantasy series, \"The Chronicles of Narnia\". It was co-produced by Walden Media and Walt Disney Pictures and distributed by Buena Vista Pictures. William Moseley, Anna Popplewell, Skandar Keynes and Georgie Henley play Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy, four British children evacuated during the Blitz to the countryside, who find a wardrobe that leads to the fantasy world of Narnia. There they ally with the lion Aslan (voiced by Liam Neeson) against the forces of Jadis, the White Witch (Tilda Swinton).\n\nThe film was released on December 9, 2005, in both Europe and North America to positive reviews and was highly successful at the box office grossing more than $745 million worldwide, making it 2005's third-most-successful film. It won the 2005 Academy Award for Best Makeup and various other awards. An extended edition was released on December 12, 2006, and was only made available on DVD until January 31, 2007, when it was discontinued. It was the best-selling DVD in North America in 2006 taking in $332.7 million that year.\n\n\"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\" was the first of a series of adaptations of C. S. Lewis's series, and was followed by \"\" in 2008 and \"\" in 2010. The three films have grossed over $1.5 billion worldwide among them.\n\nDuring World War II, the Pevensie children, Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy, are evacuated from a London suburb to Professor Digory Kirke's country home. Mrs. Macready, the strict housekeeper, explains he is unaccustomed to hosting children.\n\nWhile the Pevensies play hide-and-seek, Lucy discovers a wardrobe and enters the fantasy world called Narnia. Seeing a lamppost, Lucy encounters a faun named Mr. Tumnus, who invites her to his home. He puts Lucy to sleep by playing a lullaby on his flute. When Lucy wakes up, she finds Tumnus grieving. He explains that Jadis, the White Witch, has cursed Narnia to a hundred years of winter. If a human is encountered, they are to be brought to her. Tumnus cannot bring himself to kidnap Lucy, so he sends her home. When she returns to Professor Kirke's house, hardly any time has passed, and her siblings disbelieve her story.\n\nOne night, Edmund follows Lucy into the wardrobe, entering Narnia. While searching for Lucy, he meets the White Witch, who claims to be queen. She offers him tea and Turkish Delight and the prospect of becoming king if he brings his siblings to her castle. After she departs, Edmund and Lucy meet again and return. Lucy tells Peter and Susan what happened, but Edmund lies. Professor Kirke suggests she is telling the truth, though they remain unconvinced.\n\nWhile running away from Mrs. Macready after accidentally breaking a window, the four siblings retreat to the wardrobe and enter Narnia, Peter and Susan doing so for the first time. They briefly castigate Edmund for lying and force him to apologize to Lucy. Then, they discover that the Witch has taken Mr. Tumnus, and they meet a couple of anthropomorphic beavers, who tell them about Aslan. According to the beavers, Aslan intends to take control of Narnia from the Witch. The four must help Aslan; it has been prophesied that if two sons of Adam and two daughters of Eve sit in the four thrones, the White Witch's reign will end.\n\nEdmund sneaks off to visit the Witch. When he arrives at her castle, she is furious he has not delivered his siblings. The Witch sends wolves to track down the children and the beavers, who barely escape. Edmund is chained in the Witch's dungeon, where he meets Tumnus. The Witch demands Edmund reveal his siblings' location. After Tumnus claims that Edmund knows nothing, The Witch tells Mr. Tumnus that Edmund betrayed him, then turns Tumnus to stone.\n\nWhile Peter, Lucy, Susan, and the beavers travel, they hide from what they believe to be the White Witch; it is really Father Christmas, a sign that the Witch's reign is ending. Father Christmas gives them weapons to defend themselves. Lucy receives a healing cordial that can heal any injury and a dagger to defend herself. Susan receives a magical horn that will summon help and a bow and quiver full of arrows. Peter receives a sword and a shield. After evading wolves led by Maugrim, the group reaches Aslan's camp. Aslan is revealed as a huge and noble lion, who promises to help Edmund. Later, two wolves ambush Lucy and Susan. When Peter intervenes, Maugrim attacks him, only to be killed. Some of Aslan's troops follow the other wolf to the witch's camp and rescue Edmund. Peter is knighted by Aslan.\n\nThe White Witch journeys to Aslan's camp and claims Edmund, but Aslan secretly offers to sacrifice himself instead. That night, as Lucy and Susan covertly watch, the White Witch fatally stabs Aslan, but double crosses him by sending an army to invade. Lucy and Susan send a message to the others, and Edmund persuades Peter to lead Aslan's army. In the morning, both armies clash violently, but Aslan is resurrected, citing magic beyond the Witch's understanding. Aslan takes Susan and Lucy to the Witch's castle, where he frees the prisoners she turned to stone. While saving Peter from the Witch by destroying her wand, Edmund is mortally wounded. As the Witch fights Peter, Aslan arrives with reinforcements and kills her. After Edmund is healed from an otherwise fatal wound by Lucy's cordial, the Pevensies are crowned King Peter the Magnificent, Queen Susan the Gentle, King Edmund the Just, and Queen Lucy the Valiant.\n\nFifteen years later, the Pevensie children, now young adults, chase a white stag through the forest. They encounter the lamppost Lucy saw earlier and suddenly tumble out of the wardrobe at the same time and day they left, becoming children again. Professor Kirke then finds the children, asking why they were in the wardrobe. In a mid-credits scene, Lucy later attempts to return to Narnia via the wardrobe, where Professor Kirke tells her he has tried for many years, and they will probably return to Narnia when they least expect it.\n\n\nThe radio-announcer that Peter listens to on the rainy day near the beginning of the film is played by Douglas Gresham, co-producer of the movie and C. S. Lewis's stepson. Keynes' voice broke during filming, so some of his voice track had to be re-looped by his sister Soumaya. Mr. Pevensie is only glimpsed in a photo which Edmund tries to retrieve during the bombing, which is of Sim-Evan Jones's father.\n\nWith the exception of Tilda Swinton, who was the first choice to play Jadis, the White Witch, casting was a long process. Beginning in 2002, Adamson went through 2,500 audition tapes, met 1,800 children and workshopped 400 before coming down to the final four actors for the Pevensies. Moseley and Popplewell came from the very start of casting, whilst Henley and Keynes were cast relatively late. Moseley was cast because casting director Pippa Hall remembered she cast him as an extra in \"Cider with Rosie\" (1998). He beat 3,000 boys to the role of Peter and quit school to learn all his lines.\n\nAslan's voice was a contention point. Brian Cox was originally cast in the role on December 9, 2004, but Adamson changed his mind. Liam Neeson sought out the role, and was announced as the voice on July 17, 2005.\n\nDuring the early 1990s, producers Frank Marshall and Kathleen Kennedy were planning a film version. They could not find a space in Britain to shoot the film during 1996, and their plans to set the film in modern times made Douglas Gresham oppose the film, in addition to his feeling that technology had yet to catch up. Perry Moore began negotiations with the C. S. Lewis estate in 2000. On December 7, 2001, Walden Media announced that they had acquired the rights to \"The Chronicles of Narnia\".\n\nThe success of \"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\" prompted the producers to feel they could make a faithful adaptation of the novel set in Britain. \"\"Harry Potter\" came along, and all those cultural or geographical lines were broken,\" Mark Johnson explained. \"When \"The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe\" was being developed at Paramount, the imperative was to set it in the U.S., and it just doesn't hold. [...] It's not the book.\" Guillermo del Toro turned down the offer to direct due to his commitment on \"Pan's Labyrinth\". Following an Academy Award win for \"Shrek\", director Andrew Adamson began adapting the source material with a 20-page treatment based on his memories of the book. As such the film begins with the Luftwaffe bombing and concludes with an enormous battle, although they do not take up as much time in the novel.\n\nIn the novel, the battle is not seen until Aslan, Susan, Lucy and their reinforcements arrive. This was changed in the movie because Adamson said he could vividly remember a huge battle, an example of how Lewis left a lot to the readers' imagination. Other small changes include the reason all four children come to Narnia, in that an accident breaks a window and forces them to hide. Tumnus also never meets Edmund until the end in the novel. Minor details were added to the Pevensies, such as their mother's name, Helen, being the actual first name of Georgie Henley's mother. Finchley as the home of the Pevensies was inspired by Anna Popplewell, who actually is from Finchley. Adamson also changed the circumstances in which Lucy first comes into Narnia. He felt it was more natural that she first see the wardrobe while looking for a hide-and-seek hiding place, rather than just chance upon it exploring the house. The film also hints at Professor Kirke's role in \"The Magician's Nephew\", such as the engravings on the wardrobe, when it is a simple one in the novel, and the Professor's surprise and intrigue when Peter and Susan mention Lucy's discovery in the wardrobe. When Lewis wrote the novel, it was the first of the series and the back-story later outlined by the subsequent books in the series did not exist. Additionally in the novel, the father of the Pevensie children is in London with their mother, but in the film, their father is fighting in the war as Lucy states to Mr. Tumnus when they first meet in Narnia.\n\nWeta Workshop head Richard Taylor cited Hieronymus Bosch's \"The Garden of Earthly Delights\" as an inspiration on the film. He felt Narnia had to be less dark and gritty than their depiction of Middle-earth in \"The Lord of the Rings\" because it is a new world. Many of Weta's creature designs were designed for digital creation, so when Howard Berger and KNB FX inherited the practical effects work, they had to spend three months retooling approved designs for animatronics. Berger's children would comment and advise upon his designs; they suggested the White Witch's hair be changed from black to blonde, which Berger concurred with as he realized Swinton's wig looked too Gothic.\n\nPrincipal photography began in New Zealand on June 28, 2004, shooting in primarily chronological order. Adamson did this in order to naturally create a sense of mature development from his young actors, which mirrored their real-life development. Georgie Henley and Skandar Keynes were never shown the set before filming scenes of their characters entering Narnia, nor had Henley seen James McAvoy in his Mr. Tumnus costume before shooting their scenes together.\n\nThe first scene shot was at the former RNZAF Base Hobsonville for the railway scene. Afterwards, they shot the Blitz scene, which Adamson called their first formal day of shooting.\n\nThe filmmakers asked permission to bring in twelve reindeer to New Zealand to pull the White Witch's sled. The were denied by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, citing the potentially deadly Q fever from which the North American reindeer population suffers as the reason. However, ten wolves and wolf hybrids were allowed in for filming in Auckland. To replace the denied live reindeer Mark Rappaport's Creature Effects, Inc. created four animatronic reindeer that were used in shots where the deer were standing in place. The reindeer were designed with replaceable skins to get the most usage; brown for Father Christmas's and white for those of the White Witch.\n\nThe cast and crew spent their time in New Zealand in Auckland before moving in November to the South Island. Shooting locations in the South Island included Flock Hill in Canterbury, the area known as Elephant Rocks near Duntroon in North Otago, which was transformed into Aslan's camp. The castle scene was filmed in Purakaunui Bay, in the Catlins district, not far from the most southern point in New Zealand.\n\nThey filmed in the Czech Republic (Prague and National Park České Švýcarsko), Slovenia and Poland after the Christmas break, before wrapping in February.\n\nThe film was edited by Jim May and Sim Evan-Jones. Jones states that he really liked the problem solving that one can do with editing. According to Sim, \"The way you can just take stuff and sort it out and be the keeper of the story without having to interact with actors, crew and reign\", is what fascinated him into the editing world.\n\nJim May had worked at several visual effects facilities—Boss Film, ILM and Sony Pictures Imageworks—and eventually, moved into feature editorial as the visual effects editor in the cutting room.\n\nThe soundtrack was composed by Harry Gregson-Williams. Gregson-Williams had previously worked with Adamson on \"Shrek\" (2001) and \"Shrek 2\" (2004). In addition there are three original songs in the film; \"Can't Take It In\" by Imogen Heap, \"Wunderkind\" by Alanis Morissette and \"Winter Light\" by Tim Finn. Evanescence lead singer Amy Lee also wrote a song for the film, but it was not included in the soundtrack.\n\nThe soundtrack was recorded at Abbey Road Studios, London, England, and in Los Angeles, California. Gregson-Williams employed the 75-piece Hollywood Studio Symphony Orchestra, along with a 140-member choir (mostly members of The Bach Choir) and numerous other solo musicians such as electric violinist Hugh Marsh and vocalist Lisbeth Scott (at his Wavecrest Studio). He composed the original score and then spent late September through early November 2005 conducting the Hollywood Orchestra and overseeing the recording of the English choir. For \"colour\", he employed instruments used in ancient folk music, and to underscore critical dramatic moments, he added choral textures and, occasionally, a solo voice. The score includes instances of electronic music.\n\nThe soundtrack received two Golden Globe Award nominations: \"Best Original Score\" and \"Best Original Song\" (for \"Wunderkind\").\n\nEMI also released a compilation soundtrack entitled \"\" was released on September 2005. The album features songs by Contemporary Christian music artists, such as Bethany Dillon, Kutless, and Nichole Nordeman. It released \"Waiting for the World to Fall\" by Jars of Clay as a single. The album went on to win the Special Event Album of the Year at the GMA Music Awards.\n\nOn December 7, 2005, the film premiered in London, going on general release the following day. The film was released December 8, 2005, in the United Kingdom and December 9, 2005, in North America and the rest of Europe.\n\nWorldwide, \"Narnia\" earned $745,013,115 marking it the 55th-highest-grossing film of all time worldwide. It had a worldwide opening of $107.1 million, marking Disney's fifth-largest opening worldwide (at the time it was the largest). It is the third-largest movie worldwide among those released in 2005 and it currently still remains the highest-grossing movie of the \"Narnia\" franchise worldwide, and separately in North America and overseas. Finally, it is also the most successful film of Walden Media worldwide.\n\nThe film opened with $23,006,856 in 3,616 theatres on its opening day (Friday, December 9, 2005), averaging $6,363 per location. The film took in a total of $65,556,312 on its opening weekend (December 9–11, 2005), the 24th-best opening weekend at the time (now 54th). It was also Disney's third-largest opening weekend at the time (now the 34th-largest) as well as the second-biggest December opening, behind \"\". It is now fourth following the 2012 opening of \"\", the 2007 release of \"I Am Legend\", and the 2009 release of \"Avatar\" as well. Additionally, it made the third-largest opening weekend of 2005. It grossed $291,710,957 in total becoming the second-highest-grossing film of 2005 behind \"\". It surpassed the gross of \"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\" by only $1.7 million, although the latter grossed $895.9 million worldwide, ahead of \"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\". It is the highest-grossing film of the 2005 holiday period, the second-highest-grossing \"Christian\" film, the sixth-largest family–children's book adaptation, the ninth-highest-grossing fantasy–live-action film and the 10th-highest-grossing film overall in Disney company history. Finally, it is the largest film of Walden Media worldwide. Box Office Mojo estimates that the film sold over 45 million tickets in North America.\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 76% based on 217 reviews, with an average rating of 6.95/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"With first-rate special effects and compelling storytelling, this adaptation stays faithful to its source material and will please moviegoers of all ages.\" On Metacritic the film holds an average weighted score of 75 out of 100, based on 39 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". CinemaScore reported that audiences gave the film a rare \"A+\" grade.\n\nCritic Roger Ebert also gave the film 3 out of 4 stars. \"Ebert and Roeper\" gave the movie \"Two Thumbs Up\". Movie critic Leonard Maltin gave the film 3 out of four stars, calling it, \"an impressive and worthwhile family film,\" though he also said, \"it does go on a bit and the special effects are extremely variable.\" Duane Dudak of the \"Milwaukee Journal Sentinel\" gave the movie 3 out of 4 stars. Stuart Klawans of \"The Nation\" said, \"All ticket buyers will get their money's worth.\" Elizabeth Weitzman of \"New York Daily News\" gave it 4 out of 4 stars and said: \"A generation-spanning journey that feels both comfortingly familiar and excitingly original.\" Critic Mick LaSalle of the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" listed it as the second best film of the year. Kit Bowen gave the film 3 out of 4 stars.\n\nHowever, John Anderson from \"Newsday\", reacted negatively to the film, stating, \"…there's a deliberateness, a fastidiousness and a lack of daring and vision that marks the entire operation.\"\n\n\"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\" won several awards including the Academy Award for Best Makeup; the BeliefNet Film Award for Best Spiritual film; the Movieguide Faith & Values Awards: Most Inspiring Movie of 2005 and Best Family Movie of 2005; and the CAMIE (Character and Morality In Entertainment) Award.

{"id": "1880663", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1880663", "title": "Associated Students of the University of California", "text": "Associated Students of the University of California\n\nThe Associated Students of the University of California (ASUC) is the officially recognized students' association of the University of California, Berkeley. Founded in 1887, the ASUC is an independent, 501(c)3 non-profit, and unincorporated association. The ASUC controls funding for all ASUC-sponsored organizations, advocates on behalf of students to solve issues on campus and in the community, engages with administrators to develop programming, increase student-organizational resources, and increase transparency.\n\nThe ASUC was founded on March 2, 1887. Prior to this, Berkeley had no residence halls, sport teams, or permanent student organizations. The original purpose of the ASUC was \"to organize the Student Body in such wise that it might take effective action upon all matter relating to the general welfare of the student body and the University in general.\" The organization went on to absorb the Cal Student Store, become the center of student organization oversight, and run all university athletics until the 1960s.\n\nVarious student political parties – popularly known as \"slates\" – and independent student communities participate in the ASUC. SLATE, a pioneer organization of the New Left and precursor of the Free Speech Movement and formative counterculture era, was a campus political party at Cal from 1958 to 1966, while VOICE (a radical party) and Pact (a liberal party) were campus political parties at Cal in 1967.\n\nAt present, two parties primarily dominate ASUC politics. Student Action, founded 1995, is a coalition of organizations, with key support groups being the Greek life and pre-law community. CalSERVE (Cal Students for Equal Rights and a Valid Education), founded 1984, is also a coalition, but one centered directly on \"access, representation, and social, environmental, and racial justice.\"\n\nIn addition to these two parties, smaller third parties have been known to run for seats. SQUELCH! is a satirical party which has run and won seats in the past before suffering a major blow in the 2017 elections, when they won no seats in the senate. The Pirate Party centers their messaging on technology and humor, campaigning in pirate costumes during election season. As of the 2017 elections, they held one seat in the ASUC Senate. The Defend Affirmative Action Party (DAAP), founded by national activist and left-wing militant group BAMN, campaigns on a platform of radical racial justice and inclusion for students, though has found relatively little support, having won no seats for 9 years . BAMN itself began at Berkeley in 1995 and ran candidates starting in 1996 under its own name, which, at the time, was The Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action By Any Means Necessary.\n\nThe ASUC's responsibilities include allocating student group funding through a yearly spring budgeting process. The finance officer evaluates each club's funding request, length of time as a sponsored organization, and history of funding in order to determine how much money each registered student organization should be allocated. The ASUC budgets in excess of $1 million each year to campus organizations, including the Bridges multicultural resource & retention center.\n\nThe offices of the president and the external affairs vice president focus much of their time on student advocacy, often relating to issues of sexual assault, campus safety, student voice, mental health, equality, and diversity.\n\nThe ASUC Constitution establishes a students' association with elected officials modeled after California's separation-of-powers and plural elected executive framework.\n\nThe executive officers and the senate of the ASUC are popularly elected by single transferable vote. Chief appointed officers are appointed by the senate. These positions include a chief financial officer, a chief legal officer, a chief communications officer, a chief technology officer, a chief personnel officer.\n\nThe five elected executive officers of the ASUC are the president, executive vice president, external affairs vice president, academic affairs vice president, and student advocate. Political parties that compete in ASUC elections usually run candidates for the first four positions, while the fifth, student advocate, is traditionally won in a nonpartisan race by a member of the staff of the outgoing student advocate.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1880673", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1880673", "title": "Comox Valley", "text": "Comox Valley\n\nThe Comox Valley is a region on the east coast of Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada, that includes the city of Courtenay, the town of Comox, the village of Cumberland, and the unincorporated settlements of Royston, Union Bay, Fanny Bay, Black Creek and Merville. The communities of Denman Island and Hornby Island are also considered part of the Comox Valley. The Comox Valley contains the 47th largest metropolitan area in Canada with a population of about 66,000 as of 2016.\n\nThe Comox Valley is a lowland area with deep alluvial soil. There are mountains to the west, and the Comox Glacier overlooks the valley, On the east, beaches stretch along the shore of the Strait of Georgia.\n\nAccording researcher Samuel Bawlf, Sir Francis Drake visited this area in 1579. This assertion is written about in \"The Secret Voyage of Sir Francis Drake, 1577–1580\" and suggests that Drake's reference to landing in what he called New Albion (the name of the region of North America explored by Drake) was, in fact, what is now known as Comox. This conclusion is not shared, however, by other historians such as Jules Verne and Samuel Johnson. According to the Canadian Encyclopedia, first contact in Comox between the original First Nations inhabitants and the first European visitors occurred in 1792 when HMS \"Discovery\" anchored in Comox Harbour.\n\nThere were three groups of indigenous people, the Comox, the Pentlatch (who were then nearly extinct), and the Lekwiltok, in the valley. They farmed in the rich soil there, keeping the land cleared through burning.\n\nThe first European settlers arrived in the spring of 1861, intending to start farms. At that time, Governor James Douglas was encouraging settlers arriving in the Colony of Vancouver Island to establish themselves in the Cowichan Valley and the Comox Valley rather than the of the mainland as these were the two areas that had agricultural potential on the island. The first settlers were Nanaimo coal miners and Hudson's Bay Company , John and William Biggs, Thomas Dignan, Edwin Gough, Adam Grant Horne, Thomas Jones, Alexander McFarlane, George Mitchell, Thomas Williams and Charles York all of whom had arrived on Vancouver Island before the 1858 gold rush. Of these, only Mitchell remained by 1862 when the \"Grappler\" arrived with the Comox Expedition. Dignan went to Gabriola Island. Horne and most of the others went to Nanaimo. A small pox epidemic in 1862 decimated the native population.\n\nIn 1862, Surveyor General Pemberton secured funding from the colonial government in Victoria to construct the first road into the Comox area from Nanaimo. When it became clear that a wide wagon road would be too expensive, a bridle path with some bridges was built instead. Flooding and tree falls made maintenance of this road impossible. Until the mid-1890s, access to the area was by sea. In 1874 the government wharf and the first bridge over the Courtenay River were constructed.\n\nThe area became the centre of one of the British Empire's largest private railway concerns, the Comox Logging & Railway Company. It was also the headquarters of Comox Logging, which owned Block 29, a valuable stand of Douglas Fir timber, stretching from south of Courtenay well to the north of Campbell River. For a number of years, logging was the largest source of employment in the community. Logging and mining declined in the 1960s, and fishing later declined in the 1990s. At that time the region was one of the fastest growing in British Columbia, although the growth rate between 2001 and 2006 has averaged just 2.0% annually. Most workers in the logging industry commuted to camps and logging operations further north on the Island or the mainland Coast; the Field lumber mill in Courtenay was disassembled in the fall of 2006.\n\nSince 2008, the area has been in the Comox Valley Regional District. The growth industries in the Comox Valley in recent years are tourism and construction. A ski resort at nearby Mount Washington brings in tourists. The Canadian Forces in the form of CFB Comox contributes to the local economy as well. The service sector accounts for over 50% of employment. \nThe lumber resources of Comox Logging are now owned by TimberWest and are being cut for the second time. The remaining forest resources in Comox Valley are scattered amongst small woodlots on individual farms, or in isolated parks.\n\nThere is air service direct to Calgary and points south and east, as well as Edmonton.\n\nIn 2007 the area was designated one of Canada's \"Cultural Capitals\" by Canadian Heritage. A number of music and arts events are undertaken in the region. The community also has a number of volunteer and non-profit organizations devoted to cultural pursuits.\n\nThe Valley is known as \"The Valley of Festivals\". Events include the Art & Bloom Festival, North Island Hot Jazz Festival, Comox Valley Shellfish Festival, About Town!, Marina Park Main Event, CYMC Summer School & Festival, Vancouver Island MusicFest, Hornby Island Festival, Filberg Festival, Comox Nautical Days, Showcase Festival, Comox Valley Exhibition Fall Fair and Cumberland Wild.\n\n"}

The name \"Velebach\" appeared in 1357 and \"Fehlbach\" in 1800. Several landlords had possessions in Fellbach, the House Württemberg bought piece by piece. First, the village belonged to Oberamt Cannstatt. After its dissolution in 1923 Fellbach came to Oberamt Waiblingen, this became in 1938 Waiblingen district. After Fellbach had grown to the largest Württemberg village, the community was named October 14, 1933 for city. After World War II, the population crossed the 20,000 threshold. Therefore, Fellbach was appointed on April 1, 1956 to the district town in the district of Waiblingen.\n\n\n1534 in Württemberg the Reformation was introduced. The present church of the city is the Lutheran Church, which was built mainly in the 15th century. In addition to the Lutheran Church there is the Pauluskirche (built in 1927) and the Melanchthonkirche (built in 1964) and in the neighborhood Lindle the Johannes-Brenz-Kirche. Also in the district Schmiden the Reformation was introduced by Württemberg. In Oeffingen has only existed since 1970 a separate Protestant church and parish. All Protestants of Fellbach belonged initially to the deanery or church district Cannstatt, today to deanery or church district Waiblingen of the Evangelical-Lutheran Church in Württemberg.\nCatholics: After the Reformation, there were no more Catholics. Only in the 19th century Catholics returned and built in 1923 their own church (St. Johannes). 1967, was built a second church, Maria Regina Kirche.\nDue to immigration of Catholics was built an own Catholic church (Holy Trinity). Since 1961 Schmiden has its own parish.\nOeffingen was a Catholic enclave in Protestant Württemberg. In Oeffingen was an old Catholic church in the outskirts, which was heavily damaged by an air raid during World War II. The present church of Christus König was built 1968. All three parishes of Fellbach are within the deanery Rems-Murr of the Diocese of Rottenburg-Stuttgart.\nThe New Apostolic Church was erected in 1983 with 1,400 seats.\nIn addition to two large churches there are in Fellbach, a Greek Orthodox church and several free churches, among them the United Methodist Church, the Mennonite church and the Seventh-day Adventist Church.\n\nThe following municipalities were amalgamated to Fellbach:\n\nThe population figures are estimates, census results (¹) or official updates of the State Statistical Office Baden-Württemberg (only primary residences).\nYearly population figures:\n\nAt the head of the municipality of Fellbach was a Schultheiß. Since 1930, the official title is Mayor and since the survey to district town on April 1, 1956 Lord Mayor. The position is directly elected by the electorate for a term of eight years.

It was awarded to the city on March 13, 1956, Baden-Württemberg state government.\n\nOld Coat\nPreviously led Fellbach to 1933 a coat of arms, which showed the initial F as a milestone mark of the village Fellbach. Then she received a coat of arms with a blue grape as a symbol of viticulture with the silver F before they took 1956 today's crest.\n\nFellbach was before industrialization mainly a wine-growing town. Today 182 hectares of vineyards are cultivated. In the fields around Fellbach, Schmiden and Oeffingen grain and corn are preferably grown. Great importance had once the greenhouses.\n\nThe commercial life was marked up until the 1990s by the retail trade. With the structural changes here there was a profound change. Many of the long-established retail stores were closed by competitive pressure and a changing consumer behavior.\n\nDistricts developed mainly to commuters living communities. However, there are now also numerous companies, especially in the metal sector.\n\nThe Bundesstraße 14 (Schwäbisch Hall -Stuttgart) led through the city until 1992, then the 1600m long Kappelberg Tunnel was opened. Moreover, Fellbach is tunneled from a second tunnel, which opened in 1997.(Fellbach City Tunnel).\n\nFellbach is integrated in the Verkehrs- und Tarifverbund Stuttgart. The city has a stop on the S-Bahn lines S2 (Schorndorf - Stuttgart - Airport - Filderstadt) and S3 (Backnang - Stuttgart Airport). At the Fellbach Lutherkirche is the terminus of the rail line U1 (Fellbach Lutherkirche - Hauptbahnhof - Vaihingen Bf) of the Stuttgarter Straßenbahnen. Furthermore, the urban area runs bus lines 58 ((Summer Rain -) Obere Ziegelei - Schmiden Rathaus), 60 ( Untertürkheim - Luginsland, 207 (Fellbach Alte Kelter - Fellbach - Schmiden - Oeffingen) 67 (Fellbach Bf Fellbach Altenheim), Waiblingen Bf -Korber Höhe) and 212 (Stetten - Rommelshausen - Fellbach Bf)\n\nIn Fellbach (and in Kernen im Remstal) appears as daily newspaper Fellbacher Zeitung.

Noteworthy is also the Fellbacher industrial architecture.\nBy ill modernization in recent decades the historically grown building structures were ever broken, so that Fellbach has no longer a uniform cityscape today. Even the recent urban redevelopment measure are again several half-timbered houses like by demolition victims, including in the area of newly built Fellbacher market and currently in the rear street. In the 1950s, emerged on the outskirts several skyscrapers and numerous interspersed with green areas living quarters in the lower town.\nWith the eastern ring road, built in 1989, the population threshold was further postponed into Schmidenen field.

In addition to the main ranking, the organisation awards a series of special prizes for individuals and restaurants, including the One To Watch award, the Lifetime Achievement Award and the Chefs' Choice Award, the latter based on votes from the fifty head chefs from the restaurants on the previous year's list. Often working as a barometer of global gastronomic trends, the list showcases a variety of cuisines from all over the world. The top restaurants have sometimes been forerunners of molecular gastronomy. Most of the restaurants serve haute cuisine, which is characterized by the meticulous preparation and careful presentation of food.\n\nThe first place on the list has been dominated by elBulli and Noma. In 2002 and 2006–2009, elBulli was determined to be the world's best restaurant, winning more times than any other restaurant. In 2010, Noma received the first place award. It was maintained in 2011 and again in 2012. After defending its title for the third time, chef René Redzepi said that 1,204 customers were wait-listed for the evening, compared to 14 customers from two years before. However, in 2013 El Celler De Can Roca took over the first position before Noma regained it in 2014. In 2018, Osteria Francescana regained the crown it had held in 2016, after dropping to second in 2017, when Eleven Madison Park topped the poll.\n\nThe list originated as a one-off stunt by the staff of \"Restaurant\" magazine, who came up with the idea at the Shaston Arms public house in London's Carnaby Street. It was more successful than they expected and soon became established as a major event in the culinary world.\n\nThe World's 50 Best Restaurants list is compiled from the votes of the \"World’s 50 Best Restaurants Academy\", a group of 26 panels established to make the ranking. The world is divided into regions, with a chairperson in each region appointed for their knowledge of their part of the restaurant world. These chairs each selected a voting panel of 40 members, who every year cast thousands of votes.\n\nThere is no list of nominees; each member of the international voting panel votes for their own personal choice of ten restaurants. Up to six votes can be cast for restaurants in the voter's own region, while at least four must go to restaurants outside of the home region. No voting member is allowed to vote for their own restaurant, or one in which they have an economic interest, and voters must have eaten in the restaurants they nominate within the past 18 months. The integrity of the voting process and the resulting list is adjudicated by global consultancy firm Deloitte.\n\nThe criteria are different from those of the \"Michelin Guide\" or other guides, which has allowed restaurants like Momofuku Ssam Bar, Asador Etxebarri and St. John to hold their own among the molecular or traditional cuisine of restaurants such as The Fat Duck, Les Ambassadeurs or The French Laundry.\n\nThe following restaurants have been named No. 1 in The World's 50 Best Restaurants since the list's inception and will therefore not be eligible for voting in 2019 or beyond.\n\nThe Chefs' Choice Award is voted for by the head chefs of the restaurants in the list, who choose a peer who has made a positive impact in the restaurant industry in the previous year.\n\nThe World's 50 Best Restaurants list has been criticised. Writing in \"The Guardian\" in 2003 Matthew Fort described the list as \"humbug\". The French food writer and critic says the ranking lacks reliability, while the Spanish chef Martín Berasategui spoke of \"rigged\" ranking, manipulated by an \"important international food company\" in order to \"cause damage\" to the Michelin Guide. The list has also been criticised as lacking female representation and being overly Eurocentric.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1880679", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1880679", "title": "FTP Software", "text": "FTP Software\n\nFTP Software was an American software company incorporated in 1986 by James van Bokkelen, John Romkey (co-author of the MIT PC/IP package), Nancy Connor, Roxanne van Bokkelen (née Ritchie), Dave Bridgham, and several other founding shareholders. Their main product was PC/TCP, a full-featured, standards-compliant TCP/IP package for DOS. The company was based in Andover, Massachusetts. It also had a number of offices throughout the United States and overseas. \n\nThe core open-source software was developed at MIT starting in 1982 as the PC/IP project, a project to make PCs into first-class citizens on TCP/IP networks. This project began as a Telnet implemented by Louis J. Konopelski under the supervision of Jerome Saltzer. Later contributors to the PC/IP project included John Romkey, David Bridgham, David D. Clark, and Donald W. Gillies.\n\nFTP Software was the first of many companies to name themselves after an Internet protocol. At the time the company was founded, the PC/IP software package was already being sold by Wollongong, 3Com and others, and so some of the inventors of PC/IP decided to exploit their own product. The original PC/IP package contained a specialized TCP used only by its Telnet client, written by David D. Clark. It also contained ping, fortune, time, and a TFTP protocol client. After Donald W. Gillies produced a full-function multi-connection TCP and compatible SMTP for his bachelor's thesis, a mail proxy, it became possible to offer an FTP implementation - which requires two concurrent TCPs. This software, known as \"ntcp\" (new TCP) in the source tree, could support seven connections on a 128KB IBM PC-XT, and could interoperate with ten different operating systems. The multi-connection TCP languished in the source tree for two years before the FTP founders chose to make it the core of FTP Software, setting the company apart from the other competitors in this space, which were not actively improving PC/IP and were not willing to implement the FTP protocol based upon \"ntcp\".\n\nInitially PC/TCP's protocol stacks and network interface drivers were linked into individual application executables, as with PC/IP. By 1990, all PC/TCP applications shared a TSR kernel, which itself (initially) used built-in network interface drivers. By 1991, John Romkey's TSR PC/TCP Packet Driver specification had largely replaced the built-in drivers.\n\nThe company had a good run, with a valuation of over $1 billion at one point, but suffered greatly from both internal and external pressures. It had grown rapidly and repeatedly moved physically farther away from its roots at MIT. The founders, though technically adept, were inexperienced as managers. They suffered from in-fighting, epitomized in a public divorce between two of the founders. The company went public in 1994, and maintained profitable growth through 1995, as a dominant supplier of TCP stacks for x86-based machines. When Microsoft included a TCP stack at no extra cost in Windows 95 (as has become standard with all operating systems), FTP lost a significant revenue source. Due to management (which by that time was mostly non-founders) failing to adequately prepare for the transition into supplying network-using applications, FTP was not able meet Wall Street's expectations and its stock price declined sharply.\n\nIn May 1996, FTP Software announced it was providing Microsoft with various technology for Internet Explorer 2.0 for Windows 3.1, including a PPP network, 16-bit email client, and other technology.\n\nIn 1998, FTP Software was bought out by former rival NetManage. The deal was controversial, with some shareholders claiming it was not in their interest since the sale price was less than the amount in FTP's bank account.\n\nAn extensive history of TCP on personal computers was published in 1998 by Steven Baker for \"Unix Review\".\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1880689", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1880689", "title": "Gears of War (video game)", "text": "Gears of War (video game)\n\nGears of War is a 2006 third-person shooter video game, the first installment of the \"Gears of War\" series. It was developed by Epic Games and published by Microsoft Game Studios, initially as an exclusive title for the Xbox 360 in November 2006, before a Microsoft Windows version of the game, developed in conjunction with People Can Fly, was released in 2007. The game's main story, which can be played in single or co-operative play, focuses on a squad of troops who assist in completing a desperate, last-ditch attempt to end a war against a genocidal subterranean enemy, and save the remaining human inhabitants of their planet Sera. The game's multiplayer mode allows up to eight players to control characters from one of the two factions in a variety of online game modes. Gameplay features players using cover and strategic fire in order to win battles.\n\nThe game was a commercial success, selling over three million copies within ten weeks of its launch. It became the fastest selling video game of 2006, the second-most played game over Xbox Live during 2007, and the 6th best selling Xbox 360 game. Considered one of the seventh generation of video gaming's most significant titles, the game received universal critical acclaim for its gameplay and detailed visuals, with it winning over 30 \"Game of the Year\" awards in 2006. \n\nA remastered version, \"Gears of War: Ultimate Edition\", was developed primarily by The Coalition, and brought about a number of improvements, including updates to the gameplay from later titles and enhanced graphics. \"Ultimate Edition\" was released for the Xbox One in August 2015, and for PC in March 2016.\n\n\"Gears of War\"'s success led to the development of a franchise, including four sequels (\"Gears of War 2\" in 2008, \"Gears of War 3\" in 2011, \"Gears of War 4\" in 2016, and \"Gears 5\" in 2019) and two prequels, \"\", which was released in 2013 and \"Gears Tactics\" which was released in 2020. In addition, it has also spawned adaptations for books and comics, and a film based on the series is currently in development.\n\n\"Gears of War\" is a third-person shooter that places emphasis on using cover to avoid taking damage while moving towards enemy forces. The game uses a number of weapons, but predominately featured is the Lancer, an assault rifle that has a mounted chainsaw bayonet that can deal melee damage at close range. Playable characters can carry two primary weapons, grenades, and a smaller, secondary weapon such as the Snub Pistol. Weapons are reloaded with a tap of the RB button, and a second tap within a given time (active reload) rewards the player with a damage bonus. However, failing to perform the \"Active Reload\" correctly will cause the gun to become momentarily jammed while the player's character fixes it. When the player takes damage, the \"Crimson Omen\", a red cog representing the player's health gauge, will fade into the screen, becoming more defined with larger amounts of damage. The player can seek cover to recover their health, but if they take too much damage, they will become incapacitated. Once this occurs, a skull will fill the center void of the omen. The player can then be revived by a teammate, executed by an enemy, or remain incapacitated until they \"bleed out\", dying from blood loss.\n\nThe game features a five-act campaign that can be played alone or cooperatively with another player. The campaign focuses on COG Army soldiers Marcus Fenix and Dominic Santiago and their efforts in the Delta Squad to wipe out the Locust forces on their planet Sera. The player is joined by AI teammates that will help fight the Locust. Certain sections of the campaign feature two paths that can be taken as selected by the first player. If there is a second player, their character will automatically take the other. The campaign can be played at three difficulty settings in the first game. From easiest to hardest, these are \"Casual\", \"Hardcore\" and \"Insane\". The \"Insane\" difficulty is unlocked once the game is beaten on either the \"Casual\" or \"Hardcore\" difficulty.\n\nMultiplayer \"Gears of War\" features up to four-on-four competitive gameplay, with teams representing the Gears or the Locust. Players must execute downed foes, otherwise these will revive after a time. In Assassination matches, the team's leader is the only one that can track the other team's leader and pick up new weapons, after which teammates can pick them up, with the goal to eliminate the foe's leader. An Xbox 360 patch added the \"Annex\" mode, which is similar to \"King of the Hill\", in which players must try to control a shifting control point for a certain amount of time to win. The PC version of \"Gears\" introduced \"King of the Hill\", a mode not present in the Xbox 360 version, which uses a fixed control point but varies the conditions on which it is controlled.\n\n\"Gears of War\" takes place on the planet Sera. A liquid called Imulsion became a highly valued power source after a scientist discovered how to use it, and the economic shockwave led to several wars between nations. The Coalition of Ordered Governments (COG) originally existed only as an obscure world-government philosophy, but it evolved into a legitimate, though minor, political party during the 79-year-long Pendulum Wars. The soldiers of the COG are called \"Gears\". After \"Emergence Day\" (E-Day), when the Locust began their attack on humanity, the COG were the ones who took the necessary steps to ensure the survival of human civilization, instituting martial law and taking charge of the effort against the Locust. Fourteen years later, the COG is the only human government left on Sera. One year after E-Day, after losing battle after battle against the Locust, the COG made the greatest sacrifice using the Hammer of Dawn on human cities, giving the citizens of Sera three days to evacuate to the Jacinto Plateau, the only place Locust could not dig through, before going through with the attack.\n\nThe game primarily focuses on Marcus Fenix, the main character, and Delta Squad, consisting of Dominic \"Dom\" Santiago, Augustus Cole and Damon Baird. Side characters, such as Private Anthony Carmine, and Lieutenant Minh Young Kim, Lieutenant Anya Stroud, and an elderly Stranded man known as Chaps, also aid Delta Squad throughout the narrative. Players take control of Fenix in the campaign; while in co-op mode, the second player controls Santiago. All four Delta squad members are available for play during multiplayer games, along with Carmine, Kim, and Colonel Victor Hoffman, in addition to the various Locust characters.\n\nMarcus Fenix is voiced by John DiMaggio; Dominic Santiago is voiced by Carlos Ferro; and Augustus \"Cole Train\" Cole is voiced by Lester \"The Mighty Rasta\" Speight.\n\nThe game's plot begins fourteen years after Emergence Day (E-Day), when the Locust Horde overran and killed many COG soldiers and civilians, declaring war against humanity. Marcus Fenix, a former COG soldier, is reinstated into the military after spending four years in prison for abandoning his military post in order to make a vain attempt to save his father, Adam Fenix. Dominic \"Dom\" Santiago, Marcus' best friend and fellow COG, successfully extracts Fenix from the prison, and takes him to meet Delta Squad. The group seeks to obtain the \"resonator\", a device that will map \"The Hollow\", the caverns which the Locust inhabit and later deploy the \"Lightmass Bomb\", which will destroy the heart of the Locust forces inside the Hollow. Fenix and his allies recover the device, but suffer multiple casualties in the process including Anthony Carmine and Squad leader Kim. Fleeing RAAM's forces, Fenix leads the remaining soldiers through the ruins of Ephyra to claim a \"Junker\" APC, drive to a mining facility, and finally into the planet's depths.\n\nDelta Squad successfully detonates the resonator, but the device fails to map enough of the tunnel network. They discover a larger map of the network that originates from Fenix's old home, specifically his father's laboratory. The group ventures to the Fenix estate at East Barricade Academy, where Fenix originally attempted to rescue his father. When they arrive, Delta encounters heavy Locust resistance. After collecting the data, the group fights their way past Locust forces and boards a train carrying the Lightmass Bomb. Fenix and Santiago battle their way through the train, and are able to defeat General RAAM, before uploading the data. Fully activated, the Lightmass Bomb launches into the Hollow, and eradicates the Locust tunnel networks. In the game's final sequence, Hoffman delivers a victory speech as the tunnels collapse and explode, whereupon the voice of the Locust Queen promises that the Locust will continue to fight onward, despite their losses.\n\nThe first concept for the game was conceived around the years 2000 and 2001 as \"Unreal Warfare\", which was much closer to the multiplayer-driven \"Unreal\" series than the game that would eventually become \"Gears of War\". The original concept for the game featured character classes and mechs, being played in a closed arena against other players or bots. The game was put on standby as Epic focused on the \"Unreal Tournament\" series, and when the team went back to it, the industry had shifted towards single-player games and the aim of the game was changed.\n\nAccording to Rod Fergusson, the game was at one point intended to be a horror game influenced by \"Band of Brothers\", \"Resident Evil 4\" and \"Kill Switch\". A romance subplot was considered for the game but was eventually dropped. In an interview with Cliff Bleszinski, lead developer for Epic Games, he cites three games that were the primary influences in the game's design, including the pacing and over-the-shoulder third-person perspective from \"Resident Evil 4\" and the tactical-cover system from \"Kill Switch\"; Bleszinski also cited \"Bionic Commando\"s influence on the cover system, equating the actions of moving from cover to cover as similar to the action of swinging from platform to platform in the latter game. These design choices reflect themselves in the gameplay, as \"Gears of War\" focuses mainly on squad team-based and cover-dependent tactics with limited weapons rather than brute force. Bleszinski also cited the influence of \"The Legend of Zelda\", including its storytelling and world-building elements, acquiring and mastering of tools, and underground environments. The game's title itself is a homage to \"Metal Gear\", an early formative influence on Bleszinski. The total cost of development was $10 million, according to Epic's Mark Rein, and 20 to 30 people were involved with the development at any time. However, these figures do not include the proprietary Unreal Engine 3.\n\n\"Gears of War\" was first shown as an unnamed exclusive for the Xbox 360 in a behind-closed-doors presentation by Epic Games at the 2005 Game Developers Conference. The demo was presented as a technology showcase for Unreal Engine 3 that would run on the Xenon processor at the center of the new Xbox. It showcased a group of human soldiers patrolling a city at night that fell under ambush. The demo was noted for its overall realism, suspense, and visual clarity, helping to reinforce the argument advanced by Epic Games' founder Tim Sweeney for Microsoft to double the memory in the Xbox 360 from the planned 256 MB to 512 MB. This decision that would ultimately cost Microsoft tens of millions of dollars and restrict the number of Xbox 360 consoles available at launch, but allowed \"Gears of War\" and many other Xbox 360 games to run at 720p resolution.\n\n\"Gears of War\" lead designer Cliff Bleszinski said he hoped for the game to expand into graphic novels and eventually film. On November 21, 2006, Microsoft Corporate VP of Global Marketing and Interactive Entertainment Business Jeff Bell stated \"Gears of War\" is the first in a trilogy, through sequences on E-Day and the battle of Jacinto Plateau, as well as information on Adam Fenix and his research. Epic Games Vice President Mark Rein posted a message on the official \"Gears of War\" Internet forums, stating \"It's not over until it is not fun anymore\", and, in his view, \"Gears of War\" may become the next \"Halo\" series in terms of popularity.\n\nThe ending to \"Gears of War\" heavily suggested a sequel, and at the 2007 Game Developers Conference, Bleszinkski confirmed that Epic Games did \"intend to do a sequel\" to \"Gears of War\". The game's sequel, \"Gears of War 2\" was officially confirmed on February 20, 2008, and was released at midnight on November 7, 2008. On January 27, 2014 Microsoft announced that they have acquired all rights to the franchise from Epic Games and that Rod Fergusson had rejoined Microsoft Studios to lead development on future \"Gears of War\" games.\n\nNews of the franchise's future has emerged multiple times since the game's release. \"PC Gamer\" accidentally released an image in its 2006 holiday issue where \"Gears of War\" can be seen in a Games for Windows display, which led to suspicion that \"Gears of War\" would be released for the PC; however, the image was later stated to be a mock-up. Possible leaked pictures were released on February 13, 2007, leading to more suspicion of \"Gears\" on the PC. In an interview with Xbox fan site TeamXbox, Mark Rein stated that the game would eventually come to the PC; Epic was not currently ready to release it on that format, but the upcoming release of \"Unreal Tournament 3\" was \"helping (Epic) get optimization on the PC\".\n\nOn July 11, 2007 at the E3 conference, it was revealed that \"Gears of War\" would indeed be released for Windows. New features include three new multi-player maps, an extension of five new single-player chapters to act five which describes events of Delta Squad escaping a giant Brumak between acts four and five (which Mark Rein claims is \"about 20 percent extra\" over the existing Xbox 360 content), new game modes, a game editor, and Games for Windows – Live support integrated into Unreal Engine 3. When asked about bringing the additional content to the Xbox 360 version, Mark Rein of Epic Games stated that \"it is unlikely we will bring that content to 360\". He then states, \"Unfortunately the version it's built on is not really compatible with the 360 and so it would involve a massive patch, a patch larger than all five we've done so far, to \"Gears of War\" to do that.\" Additionally, the PC and Xbox 360 versions will not allow for cross-platform play; Cliff Bleszinski stated that \"while this feature does add value, it just wasn't that desired nor worth the extra months of design and development time. We want \"Gears of War\" to be out this holiday on PC.\" This news angered many owners of \"Gears of War\" on the Xbox 360 due to the game no longer living up to its \"Exclusively for the Xbox 360\" title and not receiving the additional content. Mark Rein noted that despite their original label of the game as an Xbox 360 exclusive, Microsoft allowed them to develop the game as part of the Games for Windows moniker, as has been done previously with \"Halo 2\".\n\nA patch was released on November 28 to fix performance issues and also the Games for Windows – Live update issue. The patch was only released for American and Western European versions of the game; legitimate purchasers of the Eastern European and Russian versions were informed that \"the game would continue to function without the patch\" and never issued a corresponding version.\n\nA macOS version was confirmed by Mark Rein at the end of E3, on the \"Game Head\" television program on July 14, 2007, along with \"Unreal Tournament 3\", but no release time frame was specified. As of August 2014, nothing more has been mentioned.\n\nIn early 2009, an issue with a digital certificate, used to sign certain game-critical files as part of the anti-cheat mechanism, which expired on January 28, 2009, rendered the game unplayable without a temporary workaround of resetting the system clock to before the certificate expired. Initial information from sources led people to believe the issue was related to DRM within the game. Epic later acknowledged the problem, claiming it was not in relation to a form of DRM but instead to a form of Anti-Cheat, and notified end users that they \"[were] working with Microsoft to get it resolved.\" This issue was corrected as of February 6, 2009 with a downloadable patch.\n\nThe music was composed by Kevin Riepl who has previously worked with Epic Games on the soundtracks for \"Unreal Tournament 2004\" and \"\". Riepl began receiving early builds and cinematics about halfway through the development process, closely collaborating with the development team on the influence the music should have on the player and the story. The theme of 'Destroyed Beauty' that had inspired the game's visuals guided the music too, creating mood suited to a beautiful city in ruins and the emotional desperation of its inhabitants.\n\nThe score includes many mechanical percussive elements, altered samples of explosions, hits and impacts, and electric guitar stingers that punctuate the game's combat encounters. To complete the score these elements were combined with the organic sounds of a live orchestra. The orchestral score was orchestrated and conducted by Corey Status and performed by the Northwest Sinfonia orchestra. The title track was written and performed by thrash metal band Megadeth, with an instrumental version of the song being used for the soundtrack; a revised version with lyrics was featured on the band's 2007 album \"United Abominations\". Megadeth performed the track live as headliners of Gigantour, a twenty-five stop metal tour sponsored by Microsoft as part of the promotion for the game.\n\nA soundtrack was released on July 31, 2007 by Sumthing Else Music Works.\n\nMicrosoft produced a thirty-minute documentary, titled \"Gears of War: The Race to E3\", that aired on MTV2 on May 19, 2006 to promote the game. The program was produced in a reality TV style and featured Cliff Bleszinski, Epic Games president Mike Capps, and producer Rod Fergusson in the weeks leading up to the \"Gears of War\" gameplay reveal at the Xbox Media Briefing at E3 2006. \nThe program captures several stressful moments including Xbox executive Peter Moore's desire to remove the chainsaw rifle from the E3 demo days before the show. The chainsaw remained and after the demo was given Bill Gates confided to Cliff \"I love that chainsaw.\"\nThe \"Gears of War\" television ad reveals Marcus Fenix alone in the ruined streets of Sera as he moves to avoid threats that appear throughout a dark and deserted city. The spot was widely praised and has been described as one of the most iconic game trailers of the last decade. The spot, set to the Gary Jules' cover of \"Mad World\" and directed by Joseph Kosinski, is melancholy and reflective in tone and was a significant departure for videogame advertising at the time, especially a fast-paced shooter game. Visual effects company Digital Domain created the visuals inside the Unreal Engine 3 game engine, the same engine that powered \"Gears of War\" on the Xbox 360. While the spot was pre-rendered, the production method gave consumers an accurate preview of the game's textures and subtle facial expressions.\n\nThe popularity of the commercial built a bigger audience for \"Mad World\" which would reach the #1 spot on iTunes five years after it was initially recorded. The melody remains heavily associated with the \"Gears of War\" franchise and was later adopted into the soundtrack of \"Gears of War 3.\"\n\nAt the game's release, Epic Games released a \"Limited Collectors Edition\". Some of the notable differences are a steel case instead of the regular plastic case and an extra disc which contains artworks of environments and stages including Locust that did not made it to the game, and extra content and behind footage of the making of \"Gears of War\". The disc also contains a time-lapse on the creation of the \"Emergence\" mural. The game's disc and case has a different cover and instead features the \"Omen\" background. Another of the Collector's Edition extras is a book titled \"Destroyed Beauty\" which illustrates the game's back-story and includes concepts, sketches, and descriptions of the game's characters. The Collector's Edition also includes the same instruction manual and 48-hour Xbox Live Gold trial as the regular game does.\n\nEpic Games began working on new content for \"Gears of War\" in August 2006. The updates would remain free according to Epic Games president Mike Capps. The first of these updates was released over Xbox Live on January 9, 2007, with two new maps released the following day on January 10, 2007. The two maps reflected background scenes from the game's storyline, known as \"Raven Down\" and \"Old Bones\", which depict Gears fighting Locust amidst the crash site of a \"King Raven\" chopper and a museum. Another update was released for \"Gears of War\" on January 22, 2007, which, according to Epic Games' Marc Rein, is said to fix some compatibility issues with the release of \"Gears of War\" in Japan, and that no game play or functionality features were changed.\n\nOn April 9, 2007, Epic Games released their third update, containing a new game mode titled \"Annex\", which requires teams to capture and hold certain areas of each map, as well as additional gameplay tweaks and fixing up some glitches, bugs and exploits. The update was free of charge.\n\nEpic Games initially said that four new maps would be released in conjunction with the third patch. However, due to disagreements between Microsoft and Epic Games, Epic decided instead to \"put these maps on sale at a reasonable price then make them free a few months later,\" according to Mark Rein of Epic Games. The map pack, titled \"Hidden Fronts\", was released on Xbox Live Marketplace on May 3, 2007, and included the maps \"Bullet Marsh\", \"Garden\", \"Process\", and \"Subway\". Free downloads of these maps were made available on September 3, 2007, four months after their initial release.\n\nA fourth update on June 14, 2007 added 250 additional Achievement points (bringing the total possible achievement points to 1250), in eight Achievements related to Annex mode and the maps from \"Hidden Fronts\". Additionally, the update includes improvement of roadie run to keep the player from sticking to cover areas, and a patch to prevent the Annex clock from counting during connection errors. Other \"housekeeping\" issues were also addressed.\n\nUpon its release, \"Gears of War\" received universal acclaim from critics, maintaining an average review score of 93.97% at GameRankings and 94/100 at Metacritic. It was the second highest rated game of 2006 on both sites. Most reviewers praised the game for its concept visuals, presentation and sound. IGN's review of the game called it \"the most gorgeous looking game on the Xbox 360\" and that \"the sound design is worthy of awards.\"\n\nWhile the game received high praise, reviewers did point out that \"Gears of War\" did not offer anything significantly new in its core gameplay. Eurogamer's review of the game states: \"let's not pretend that we're wallowing in the future of entertainment. What we have here is an extremely competent action game that's as polished and refined as it could be, and is therefore very enjoyable. But if Epic had applied the same widescreen scope and ambition to the gameplay as it did to the engine we'd be much more excited than we are.\" The game's story was noted for not being very deep, as GameSpot's review states \"The lack of exposition feels like a missed opportunity to make the characters and the setting even more compelling.\"\n\nThe PC release of the game received similar praise as the 360 version, with reviewers noting various differences between the two versions. IGN commented that \"The mouse and keyboard allow for more precise control, and the graphics have been improved as well;\" however, 1UP stated that \"the control scheme's a very central obstacle\" to the game. GameSpot noted that the additional chapter felt out of place as \"it changes things up a bit in ways that betray the difficulty progression of the game.\" \"Hyper\"s Cam Shea commends the game for its \"visual, solid gameplay, killer multiplayer and reload mechanics\". However, he criticised it for \"potential frustration, pointless squad commands and chainsaw mechanics\".\n\nThe Lancer weapon was later featured in an \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" article that discusses its practicality and historical precedents. Keirsey criticized this weapon by noting that in real life, \"chainsaws are heavy.\" He noted that the closest historical precedents are \"medieval bludgeoning weapons\".\n\nLeading up to the game's release, \"Gears of War\" was one of the most anticipated games of 2006. The game premiered during the 2005 E3 show, and won, among others, several \"Best 360 Game\" awards, including from IGN, 1UP, and GameSpy. The game continued to win several awards at following 2006 E3 show prior to the game's release. These included the Game Critics Awards for \"Best Console Game\" and \"Best Action Game\", IGN's \"Best 360 Action Game\", \"Best 360 Multiplayer Game\", and \"Best Overall Multiplayer Experience\", and GameSpy's \"Best Console Multiplayer\", \"Best Action Game\", and \"Xbox 360 Game of Show\".\n\nUpon release, \"Gears of War\" received numerous awards from many publications. IGN named \"Gears of War\" as the \"Xbox 360 Game of the Year\" among other awards. GameSpot named the game its \"Game of the Year\" as well as \"Best Xbox 360 Game\", among other accolades. \"Official Xbox Magazine\" named \"Gears of War\" as their \"Xbox 360 Game of the Year\". G4 TV during the 2007 G-Phoria awards, named \"Gears of War\" its \"Game of the Year\" in addition to other awards.\n\n\"Gears of War\" won several awards at the 2007 Interactive Achievement Awards at the D.I.C.E. Summit, including \"Overall Game of the Year\", \"Console Game of the Year\", and \"Action/Adventure Game of the Year\", and \"Outstanding Achievements\" in Animation, Art Direction, Visual Engineering, and Online Gameplay. The game received the awards of \"Ultimate Game of the Year\" and \"Xbox Game of the Year\" at the 2007 Golden Joystick Awards.\n\nIn addition, the characters within the game received additional awards. GameSpot gave their 2006 \"Best New Character(s)\" award to the Delta Squad of \"Gears of War\". G4 TV named Marcus Fenix the \"Best New Character\" and gave Lester Speight's performance for \"Augustus 'Cole Train' Cole\" the award for \"Best Voiceover\". The game was given the Interactive Achievement Award for \"Outstanding Character Performance – Male\" for its voicework. The Berserkers were named as \"Official Xbox Magazine\"s \"Enemy of the Year\".\n\nGuinness World Records awarded \"Gears of War\" with 5 world records in the \"Guinness World Records: Gamer's Edition 2008\". These records include, \"First Console Game to Use the Unreal 3 Engine\", \"Fastest Selling Original Xbox 360 Game\", and \"First Music Single to Top the Chart After Promoting a Video Game\" for the Gary Jules version of \"Mad World\", which was originally released in 2003, but topped the download charts in November 2006 after it was used as background music during the TV commercial for \"Gears of War\".\n\n\"Gears of War\" was a hit upon its release. On November 7, 2006—the day that it was released—it became the most popular game on the Xbox Live service, until the release of \"Halo 3\", overtaking \"Halo 2\" which had held the spot since its launch in November 2004. \"Gears\" was the second most-played game on the Xbox Live service throughout 2007. \"Gears of War\" sold one million copies in its first two weeks on sale making it the fastest-selling Xbox 360 game to date. By January 19, 2007, just ten weeks after its debut, over three million units of the game had been sold. It received a \"Double Platinum\" sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 600,000 copies in the United Kingdom. As of November 7, 2008, the game has sold 5.88 million copies worldwide. \"Gears of War\" was also the first Xbox or Xbox 360 game to sell out and reach the top ten charts in Japan.\n\nLeaked in April 2015, \"Gears of War: Ultimate Edition\" was confirmed in E3 2015 Microsoft's press conference. It was released worldwide for the Xbox One in North America and Asian-Pacific countries on August 25, 2015, and in Europe on August 28. \"Ultimate Edition\" is a remaster of the original game, that features the five chapters of the campaign originally exclusive to the PC version of the game. Players who purchased the \"Ultimate Edition\" received early access to the multiplayer beta of \"Gears of War 4\", which was released on April 18, 2016. The re-mastered game was subsequently released for Microsoft Windows on March 1, 2016.\n\n\"Gears of War Ultimate Edition\" was developed under the direction of series Rod Fergusson but is the first to be created at The Coalition, the Microsoft Studios studio charged with the continuation and development of the franchise following its acquisition by Microsoft from Epic Games in early 2014.\n\nThe remake took a total of 18 months, including pre-production, and included the remastering of over 3,000 art assets, original motion capture, and refinement of the control scheme. Only selected elements from the original were retained including the original score and voice performances. The remake's ending was also changed to show Myrrah, the Locust Queen.\n\nThe initial release of \"Gears of War Ultimate Edition\" suffered from significant display problems and stuttering on contemporary top-end hardware, leading to significant criticism of the developer and Microsoft's Universal Windows Platform. The problems partially related to the developer's transition of the game to DirectX 12 and the implementation of ambient occlusion. Driver updates and a patch from the studio significantly helped to address the issues.\n\nOn Xbox One X, when video resolution is set to 4K UHD, \"Gears of War Ultimate Edition\" suffers from brightness, color, and sharpness fluctuations. These fluctuations can be distracting to the player and significantly detract from the experience. As of January 2020, Microsoft has not issued a patch to address this issue. The only known workaround is to manually set the Xbox One X video resolution to 1080p when playing the game.\n\n\"Gears of War: Ultimate Edition\" received generally positive reviews from critics. The improved graphics, sound & minimum changes from the original game were heavily praised, but was criticized for its AI problems & the dated campaign level design. Aggregate review website Metacritic assigned a score of 82/100 based on 74 reviews. GameSpot also gave the game a score of 7.0 out of 10 due to the fact that there wasn't major changes to the game other than graphics. IGN also gave the game a score 8.5 out of 10. Jeff Gerstmann from Giant Bomb, who reviewed the original game when he was at GameSpot, gave the title a negative review. He criticized the game's AI and the campaign mode, noting that it \"aged pretty poorly\".\n\nIn March 2007, New Line Cinema bought the rights to make a film adaptation, with Stuart Beattie writing the script along with Marty Bowen and Wyck Godfrey. In June 2008, Len Wiseman was confirmed to direct before dropping out in 2010. Since then, New Line have been looking for a new director and have allegedly lowered the budget.\n"}

The AL-7 uses a type of operation developed by Pyotr Tkachyov of TsNIITochMash (Central Institute for Precision Machine Building) in the mid-1960s known as \"Balanced Automatics\" first used on the AO-38 assault rifle. The Balanced Automatics Recoil System (BARS) replaces the traditional Kalashnikov gas piston operating system, reducing the negative effects of recoil and allowing more efficient use of automatic fire. BARS works by shifting mass toward the muzzle of the rifle as the bolt and bolt carrier recoil rearward.\n\nThe AL-7 and its BARS system were never adopted by the Soviet Army. The project was overshadowed by the acceptance of the AK-74 due to cost considerations. The passage of time has allowed manufacturing technology to advance, finally making the AL-7 concept economically viable, presenting itself in the form of the AK-107 and AK-108 rifles.\n\nOther rifles that use the balanced automatics system are the AEK-971, AO-38, SA-006, AKB and AKB-1.\n\n\n"}

After securing Shaykh Hasan's neutrality, Musa's patron Ali Padshah went on to battle Arpa Ke'un on Jaghatu plains near Maragha on 29 April 1336. Arpa's army were led by 60 emirs, notably Hajji Taghay (son of Sutai, Governor of Diyar Bakr, from Oirats), Uyghur commander Ögrünch, Torut (a son of Nari and relative of Narin Taghay), Ortuq-Shah (son of Alghu) and Chupan's son Sorgan Sira. However, soon some emirs defected to the side of Ali Padshah, such as Mahmud b. Essen Qutlugh and Sultanshah Nikruz. Battle was a defeat for Arpa and soon after he was captured in Sultaniya and killed.\n\nSubsequently, Musa was enthroned as new Ilkhan, in fact as a puppet of Ali Padshah. Supporters of Arpa Ke'un, namely Hajji Taghai meanwhile went to Jalayirid Hasan Buzurg, who in turn raised another Borjigid prince, Pir Husain as an Ilkhan on 20 July 1336. Chupanid Sorgan Sira again changed sides and joined Jalayirids at the battle of Qara Darra near Van. A Georgian contingent under Amirgambar I Panaskerteli, Duke of Tao also joined the battle on Jalayirid side. Despite Ali Padshah's contingents defeating Hajji Taghay and Ögrünch defeating Surghan, Musa was standing on center and badly defeated. As a consequence, battle was lost and Ali Padshah was captured and executed while Musa was forced to flee on July 24, 1336. \n\nDespite losing his patron, Musa didn't relinquish his claim to Ilkhanate and retreated to Baghdad, later joining forces with Togha Temür in June 1337 occupied Soltaniyeh. However, he was soon captured by Emir Qara Hasan and killed on 10 July 1337. \n"}

All voluntary movement relies on spinal lower motor neurons, which innervate skeletal muscle fibers and act as a link between upper motor neurons and muscles. Cranial nerve lower motor neurons control movements of the eyes, face and tongue, and contribute to chewing, swallowing and vocalization. Damage to the lower motor neurons can lead to flaccid paralysis, absent deep tendon reflexes and muscle atrophy.\n\nLower motor neurons are classified based on the type of muscle fiber they innervate:\n\nGlutamate released from the upper motor neurons triggers depolarization in the lower motor neurons in the anterior grey column, which in turn causes an action potential to propagate the length of the axon to the neuromuscular junction where acetylcholine is released to carry the signal across the synaptic cleft to the postsynaptic receptors of the muscle cell membrane, signaling the muscle to contract.\n\nDamage to lower motor neurons, lower motor neuron lesions (LMNL) cause muscle wasting (atrophy), decreased strength and decreased reflexes in affected areas. These findings are in contrast to findings in upper motor neuron lesions. LMNL is indicated by abnormal EMG potentials, fasciculations, paralysis, weakening of muscles, and neurogenic atrophy of skeletal muscle. Bell's Palsy, Bulbar palsy, Poliomyelitis and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are all pathologies associated with lower motor neuron dysfunction.\n\n"}
{"id": "1880697", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1880697", "title": "Pig pickin'", "text": "Pig pickin'\n\nA pig pickin' (also known as rolling a pig, pig pull, hog roast, pig roast or, among the Cajun, \"cochon de lait\") is a type of party or gathering held primarily in the American South which involves the barbecuing of a whole hog (the castrated male pig or barrow, bred for consumption at about 12 weeks old). Females, or gilts, are used as well. Boars (full-grown intact males) and sows generally are too large.\n\nMany Southern families have a pig roast for Thanksgiving or Christmas, graduations, weddings, or summer gatherings. Some communities hold \"cook-offs\" during festivals, where cooks compete against one another for prize money.\n\nA pig, often around 80–120 pounds dressed weight, is split in half and spread onto a large charcoal or propane grill. Some practitioners use a separate stove filled with hardwood to produce coals which are then transferred under the charcoal grill by shovel; others use charcoal with chunks of either blackjack oak, hickory wood or some other hardwood added for flavor. The style of these grills are as varied as the methods of producing them, some being homemade while others are custom-made.\n\nThere is a long-running debate among barbecue enthusiasts over the merits of different fuels. Propane is said to maintain a consistent temperature, whereas charcoal or charwood are often touted as producing better-tasting meat.\n\nThe cooking process is communal and usually directed by an authority figure; the host is helped by friends or family. It usually takes four to eight hours to cook the pig completely; the pig is often started \"meat-side\" down, and then is flipped one time once the hog has stopped dripping rendered fat. Some practitioners clean ashes from the skin with paper towels or a small whisk broom before flipping the hog to help produce high quality cracklings from the skin.\n\nOften the hog is basted while cooking, though the method and sauce used differs according to region. For instance, a typical South Carolina Piedmont-area baste would be a mustard based sauce, an Eastern North Carolina baste is usually a very light vinegar based sauce with red pepper flakes, and Western North Carolina barbecue uses sauce with a ketchup base similar to traditional barbecue sauce. \n\nWhen the cooking is complete, the meat should ideally be tender to the point of falling off of the bone. The meat is then either chopped or pulled into traditional Carolina-style pork barbecue, or it is picked off the hog itself by the guests. It is from the latter that the gathering gains its name. The barbecue is sometimes eaten with hushpuppies (fried cornmeal, occasionally flavored with onions), coleslaw, baked beans or sometimes Brunswick stew. In South Carolina, it is common to serve pilaf or hash as a side dish. Hash is a blend of leftover pork mixed with barbecue sauce and usually served over rice.\n\nSweet tea, beer, and soft drinks are often served.\n\nThe pig pickin' is a significant part of the culture of the South; the necessary work and time needed to cook the hog makes it ideal for church gatherings (\"dinner on the grounds\") or family reunions, and they can be held virtually year-round thanks to the region's mild winters. Pig pickin's are popular amongst the most devoted tailgaters at college football games across the South. The pig pickin' has been long associated with politics; many local political parties and politicians still use the pig pickin' to attract people to meetings and campaign rallies. In 1983, Rufus Edmisten, running for Governor of North Carolina at the time, was overheard saying \"I've eaten enough barbecue. I am not going to eat any more. I'm taking my stand and that is it.\"\n\nCulturally and culinarily different from traditional Deep South pig pickin' events, pig roasts are a common occurrence in Cuba and the Philippines, as well as the non-mainland American state of Hawaii, with roasts being done in the traditions of those places.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1880698", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1880698", "title": "Halifax and South Western Railway", "text": "Halifax and South Western Railway\n\nThe Halifax and South Western Railway was a historic Canadian railway operating in the province of Nova Scotia.\n\nThe legal name of this railway was the Halifax & South Western Railway, as is defined in various Acts of the Nova Scotia Legislature, such as 1902 c.1, Act respecting the Halifax & South Western Railway Co.. However, Halifax & Southwestern Railway is also sometimes also used.\n\nThe H&SW was created in spring 1901 when William Mackenzie and Donald Mann approached the provincial government with plans to finish the abortive plans for a railway from Halifax to Yarmouth along the province's South Shore. For many years, the line had significant curvature throughout its length, a result of the rugged local topography, which earned it the moniker, \"Hellish Slow & Wobbly\".\n\nThe H&SW was not the first railway to build on the South Shore of Nova Scotia, as various charters for railway companies had preceded it.\n\nThe Nova Scotia Central Railway (NSCR) had opened its line between Middleton in the Annapolis Valley and Lunenburg, by way of Bridgewater, on December 23, 1889.\n\nIn 1893, the Coast Railway Company of Nova Scotia was incorporated under a charter to build a narrow gauge line between Yarmouth and Lockeport, by way of Barrington and Shelburne. Construction took place very slowly and what little trackage had been already built was converted to standard gauge in 1895. In 1899 the company was renamed the Halifax and Yarmouth Railway (H&YR) and received a new charter to build east from Lockeport to Liverpool, Bridgewater and Halifax. By 1903 the line had barely reached Barrington.\n\nThe Liverpool and Milton Tramway also built a short railway up the Mersey River valley between Liverpool and a pulp mill near Milton in Queens County in 1896, opening on February 1, 1897. It was renamed the Liverpool and Milton Railway (L&MR) in 1900.\n\nThe H&SW was created in spring 1901 when Mackenzie and Mann approached the provincial government with plans to finish the abortive plans for a railway from the City of Halifax to Yarmouth. Experienced railway engineers, MacKenzie and Mann already owned 2,000 miles in track in Canada by this time. On July 1, 1902, the H&SW purchased the NSCR with its line from Mahone Bay to Bridgewater, forming part of the new mainline between Bridgewater and Halifax. The new construction between Halifax and Mahone Bay was completed by 1904.\n\nOn April 11, 1903, the H&SW purchased the Nova Scotia Southern Railway (NSSR). The NSSR had no trackage constructed, however it did have a charter to build from the NSCR at New Germany to Caledonia in what was rich timber territory. Upon acquiring the NSSR charter, the H&SW built the 22 miles of track over the following months, with the first train reaching Caledonia on July 1, 1904.\n\nIn April 1905, the H&SW purchased the L&MR, with a short section of that line forming part of the main line between Bridgewater and Barrington. The new construction between Bridgewater and Barrington was completed later that year. In 1905, the H&SW also purchased the H&YR with major upgrades being done to this line between Barrington and Yarmouth over the next year.\n\nAlso in 1905, the H&SW purchased the charter for the incomplete Middleton and Victoria Beach Railway (M&VBR) in the western Annapolis Valley. The 40 mile M&VBR line was opened by the H&SW to connect an iron ore mine at Torbrook, near Middleton on the NSCR, with port facilities at Port Wade on Annapolis Basin.\n\nConstruction was completed in 1906 and H&SW tracks joined the Intercolonial Railway's mainline in Halifax at Southwestern Junction at Africville and ran into the Intercolonial's North Street Station. On December 19, 1906 the first H&SW through train reached Yarmouth from Halifax. At some point after the completion of the H&SW in 1906, the system was merged into Mackenze and Mann's Canadian Northern Railway (CNoR) transcontinental system. The H&SW, along with the Inverness Railway, were isolated from the rest of CNoR's trackage which ran from Montreal to Vancouver, not unlike rival Canadian Pacific Railway's Dominion Atlantic Railway.\n\nThe CNoR, along with several other railway lines in Canada, entered financial difficulties during the First World War. Encumbered by construction debts and low traffic, the CNoR was bankrupt and requested financial aid from the federal government in 1918. On September 6, 1918, CNoR was nationalized and placed under a Board of Management by the Department of Railways and Canals. On December 20, 1918, CNoR, along with the Canadian Government Railways were placed under a new company named Canadian National Railways (CNR).\n\nUnder CNR, the H&SW trackage saw significant infrastructure improvements to ballast, drainage, sleeper ties, rails, switches and bridges. The line still had significant curvature throughout, a result of the rugged local topography on the South Shore (locals called the H&SW the \"Hellish Slow & Wobbly\"), but the improvements brought respectable track speeds and service improvements.\n\nThe Intercolonial Railway / Canadian Government Railways Halifax terminal trackage inherited by CNR underwent significant change in the late 1910s with the construction and opening of a new south-end terminal and station in 1920. The project saw a massive railway cut built across the isthmus of the Halifax Peninsula which affected the H&SW tracks that connected with the ICR mainline near Africville. In 1921, the Halifax end of the H&SW was shifted to join the new alignment in the rock cut by constructing what became known as \"Southwestern Junction\" in the community of Fairview, adjacent to a large new roundhouse complex.\n\nIn the years before the domination of publicly funded highways, the H&SW formed a critical transportation link between the various communities, as well as steam ship connections at Yarmouth (to Boston and New York) and Halifax (to Europe).\n\nIn the 1920s, the former M&VBR line was proving uneconomic after the closure of iron ore mines at Torbrook and the port at Port Wade. CNR applied in 1925 to abandon west of Middleton, but permission was given to abandon only west of Bridgetown. By 1928, bridges were removed and trackage would be removed in the following years.\n\nThe construction of the large Bowater Mersey Paper Company Limited mill at Brooklyn in 1929 led to more traffic from the Liverpool area. Shipyards in Liverpool and Shelburne lent some traffic, as did various saw mills and logging operations at locations between Yarmouth and Halifax and between Bridgewater and Middleton/Bridgetown and New Germany to Caledonia. The naval base HMCS Shelburne opened on Shelburne Harbour during the Second World War, requiring construction of a short 1 mile spur. Heating oil and gasoline distribution terminals operated by various oil companies in communities along the lines. A distillery in Bridgetown generated some traffic, as did a forest products plant in East River. In the early 1980s a large Michelin tire factory opened in Bridgewater and required rail service. The development of the Lakeside Industrial Park near the Beechville area in the 1960s create several large industrial customers. One of them, a Volvo assembly plant attracted steady strings of autorack cars until it closed in 1998.\n\nCN passenger service ended on the South Shore on Saturday October 25, 1969, and its stations fell into disuse. The historic H&SW passenger station in Bridgewater was destroyed by an unexplained fire on December 22, 1982.\n\nCN's former H&SW lines on Nova Scotia's South Shore and in the Annapolis Valley were proving uneconomic by the early 1980s, even for freight service. In 1982, permission was given to abandon the far end of the mainline from Liverpool to Yarmouth as well as the branch line of the former NSCR line between Bridgewater and Bridgetown via Middleton, as well as the New Germany to Caledonia. Reduced to a line running from Halifax to Liverpool, CN depended on the Bowater paper mill and the Michelin tire plant, but even these customers were unable to keep the line generating positive income.\n\nBy the late 1980s, CN was given permission to abandon the remaining line from Bridgewater to Liverpool as the Bowater pulp mill in Liverpool shifted its transportation to ocean shipping and trucks. At Bridgewater, CN built a small yard on the east side of the Lahave River and sold its extensive former yard property to a shopping mall developer. In the early 1990s, even that trackage was eliminated, as Michelin began to use trucks to service its plant and CN's last remaining customer in Lunenburg County was the forest products company at East River.\n\nIn 1993 the former H&SW trackage was abandoned west of Halifax's Lakeside Industrial Park, leaving only a 7-mile spur as the last reminder of this once important railway network in southern Nova Scotia. Called the Chester Spur in its employee timetable, CN freight operations to the Bayers Lake Industrial Park and Lakeside Industrial Park were focused on serving a cement depot, a scrap dealer and several other customers through a team track. In 2006, as part of its \"Three-Year Rail Network Plan\", CN declared its intention to discontinue service on the Chester Spur, this being the last remaining portion of the original H&SW trackage. The last freight trains operated on the spur west of Southwestern Junction through to the Lakeside Industrial Park in late 2007. The rail corridor was purchased by the Halifax Regional Municipality and by October 2009, rails at level crossings were lifted and paved over and by September 2010, all the remaining track of the CN Chester Spur had been removed and replaced by a rail trail (paved recreational pathway).\n\nThe railway's history is preserved at the Halifax and Southwestern Railway Museum in Lunenburg, Nova Scotia.\nIn addition to the network of recreational trails built on the former H&SW roadbed, several stations have survived and been given alternative use. They include the French Village station, which is now a cafe and the Liverpool station which is the Hank Snow museum. The Chester stn. exists today as a tourist bureau, Oak Island museum and art gallery, it is also the site of Friday morning farmer's markets!\n\n"}
{"id": "1880706", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1880706", "title": "Payback (1999 film)", "text": "Payback (1999 film)\n\nPayback is a 1999 American neo-noir action thriller film\nwritten and directed by Brian Helgeland in his directorial debut, and starring Mel Gibson, Gregg Henry, Maria Bello, and David Paymer. It is based on the novel \"The Hunter\" by Donald E. Westlake using the pseudonym Richard Stark, which had earlier been adapted into the 1967 film noir classic \"Point Blank\", directed by John Boorman and starring Lee Marvin. In 2006, Helgeland issued a director's cut that differs substantially from the version released by the studio.\n\nFace down on the kitchen table of an underground abortionist, barely conscious and with two large bullet wounds in his back, lies career thief (and former Marine) Porter. The unlicensed doctor uses the whiskey he is drinking as sterilizing agent and digs out the bullets. Porter spends five months recuperating.\n\nPorter begins tracking down his estranged wife Lynn and former partner-in-crime Val Resnick. Porter was betrayed by both following a $140,000 heist from local Chinese Triads. Resnick had manipulated Lynn into complicity with a picture showing Porter with another woman. Lynn then shot Porter and the two left him for dead. Val rejoined a criminal syndicate named \"the Outfit\", using $130,000 of the heist money to pay off an outstanding debt.\n\nPorter is intent on claiming his $70,000 cut, steadily climbing up the criminal hierarchy. He first finds Lynn, now a heroin-addicted prostitute. Taking pity on her disastrous predicament, he confines her to her bedroom, only to discover her dead from a heroin overdose the next day. Lynn's drug delivery guy points Porter towards lowlife drug dealer and gambler named Arthur Stegman. Porter finds Stegman in the company of two corrupt police detectives, Hicks and Leary, who start harassing Porter for a share of his goal.\n\nPorter enlists the help of Rosie, a call girl affiliated with the Outfit. He was once her limo driver and eventual lover, and a picture taken during their one-night stand was the one used by Resnick to stoke Lynn's jealousy and facilitate the original betrayal. Rosie tells Porter that Resnick is barred from soliciting Outfit prostitutes because his sadistic tendencies nearly killed one of them, possibly Rosie herself.\n\nResnick is seeing a Triad-connected dominatrix named Pearl when Porter violently re-enters his life. Resnick begs the Outfit for help and explains why Porter demands $70,000, but is told to solve his own problems. He then pins the $140,000 heist solely on Porter in order to have him murdered by Pearl's associates. This attempt fails, and Resnick follows Porter's trail to Rosie's apartment, beats her and recognizes her as a former victim of his extreme sexual deviancy. Porter appears in time to prevent further abuse and shoots Resnick dead, not before obtaining the names of Outfit bosses Fairfax and Carter. He takes Rosie to a secret apartment but finds it rigged with plastic explosives, connected to the telephone by three of Carter's hitmen. Porter kills them and later confronts Carter in his own office, threatening to kill him if unless he pays the $70,000. Carter states he is only an underboss, thus unauthorized to make financial decisions. Porter then forces Carter to phone the \"real\" boss, named Bronson. When Bronson refuses over the phone, Porter carries out his threat and kills Carter. Porter then frames Hicks and Leary by planting Leary's fingerprints on the gun used to kill Resnick, as well as stealing Hicks's badge and leaving it with the gun in Resnick's hand.\n\nWith the aid of Rosie, Porter kidnaps Bronson's son Johnny. He then visits and threatens Fairfax; Hicks and Leary, who are waiting outside Fairfax's house, are promptly arrested by Internal Affairs on account of the false evidence left earlier. A shootout ensues involving Porter, Stegman, his driver, Pearl and the Triads; only Porter survives. Porter is later captured by Fairfax's men, taken to a warehouse and beaten for hours. Bronson arrives with his own men, shows Porter a bag containing the symbolic $130,000 that he is never meant to have, and supervises a more gruesome torture method to extract his son's location.\n\nPorter finally gives an address that turns out to be his own secret apartment. He is locked inside a car trunk and driven by Bronson, Fairfax and their men to the flat which, unbeknownst to them, still contains the unexploded bomb left earlier by Carter's men. Porter then manages to grab the car phone and call his own apartment in time for Bronson to pick the telephone. After his captors meet an explosive demise, Porter goes to pick up Rosie. Leaving Johnny behind, the two take off with the money the mob owed him and drive off to Canada to begin a new life.\n\nThe film was shot during September/November 1997, in Chicago and Los Angeles, though neither city is referred to in the film. Although credited as director, Brian Helgeland's cut of the film was not the theatrical version released to audiences. After the end of principal photography, Helgeland's version was deemed too dark for the mainstream public. Following a script rewrite by Terry Hayes, director Helgeland was replaced by the production designer John Myhre, who reshot 30% of the film. The intent was to make the Porter character accessible. The film's tagline became: \"Get Ready to Root for the Bad Guy.\" A potentially controversial scene between Porter and Lynn which arguably involves spousal abuse was excised and more plot elements were added to the third act. After 10 days of reshoots, a new opening scene and voiceover track also were added, and Kris Kristofferson walked on as a new villain.\n\nHelgeland's version, \"Straight Up: The Director's Cut\", was released on DVD, Blu-ray, and HD DVD on April 10, 2007, after an October 2006 run at the Austin Film Festival. The Director's Cut version features a female Bronson, that is never seen only heard over the phone voiced by Sally Kellerman, does not include the voice-over by Porter and several Bronson-related scenes. During their scuffle (which is longer than in the theatrical version and was the main source of controversy), Porter earlier tells Lynn that his picture with Rosie was taken before they met, thereby rendering her jealousy unjustified. This version has an entirely different, ambiguous ending where Porter is seriously wounded in a train station shootout and driven off by Rosie.\n\nA June 4, 2012, look at \"movies improved by directors' cuts\" by \"The A.V. Club\" described \"Payback: Straight Up\" as \"a marked improvement on the unrulier original.\"\n\nMel Gibson stated in a short interview released as a DVD extra that it \"would've been ideal to shoot in black and white.\" He noted that \"people want a color image\" and that the actual film used a bleach bypass process to tint the film. In addition to this, the production design used muted shades of red, brown, and grey for costumes, sets, and cars for further effect.\n\n\"Payback\" was well received at the box office. The film made $21,221,526 in its opening weekend in North America. It eventually grossed $81,526,121 in North America and $80,100,000 in other territories, totaling $161,626,121 worldwide.\n\nThe review-aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 54% based on 74 reviews from critics, and a weighted average of 5.9 out of 10. The website's critical consensus states, \"Sadistic violence and rote humor saddle a predictable action premise.\" Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B-\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\nRoger Ebert gave the film a three-star rating (out of four) in his review, writing, \"There is much cleverness and ingenuity in \"Payback\", but Mel Gibson is the key. The movie wouldn't work with an actor who was heavy on his feet, or was too sincere about the material.\"\n\n"}

The year after, the Seljuk Turks raided Perateia's coasts, and built the fortress of Sudak to try and channel the Crimean trade from Trebizond into Seljuk-held Sinope.

The size of the century changed over time and from the first century B.C.E. throughout most of the empire the standard size of a centuria was 80 men.\n\nA \"centuria\" is also a Roman unit of land area corresponding to 100 \"heredia\".\n\nIn the political context the \"centuria\" was the constituent voting unit in the assembly of the centuries (Latin \"comitia centuriata\"), an old form of popular assembly in the Roman Republic, the members of which cast one collective vote.\n\nIts origin seems to be the homonymous military unit. The comitia centuriata elected important magistrates like consuls and praetors.\n\nThe \"centuria\" was the pivotal tactical Roman legion unit after the Marian reforms of 107 BC. It originally consisted of a hundred soldiers; later 80 distributed among 10 \"contubernia\", with support staff making up the remainder of the 100 men. Each \"contubernium\" (the minimal unit in the Roman legion) consisted of 8 soldiers who lived in the same tent while on campaign or the same bunk room in barracks. \"Centuriae\" were grouped by pairs forming maniples, and later into 6 century cohorts.\n\nA century was commanded by a \"Centurion\", who was assisted by an \"Optio\" (lieutenant) and \"Tesserarius\" (sergeant). It had a banner or signum which was carried by a\" Signifer\". Also, each century provided a Buccinator, who played a buccina, a kind of horn used to transmit acoustic orders.\n\nOn the battlefield, the Centurion stood at the far right of the first row of men next to the Signifer, while the Optio stood at the rear, to avoid, if necessary, the disbanding of the troops and ensure the relay between typical closed order lines used by the Roman army.\n\nIn the imperial period, but likely not the republican period, the first cohort (consisting of the bravest men from the legion) was twice the size of the other cohorts. Each of its five \"centuriae\" was a double centuria of 160 men (rather than 80). The first cohort thus consisted of 800 men. Centurions of these first-cohort double \"centuriae\" were called \"primi ordinis\" (\"first rank\"), except for the leader of the first \"centuria\" of the first cohort, who was referred to as \"primus pilus\" (first file).\n\nThe term \"centuria\" was later used during the Spanish Civil War to describe the informal bands of local militiamen and international volunteers that sprang up in Catalonia and Aragon in October-November 1936.\n\n"}

He was drafted by the Cincinnati Bengals in the sixth round of the 1994 NFL Draft. He played college football at Boise State.\n\nHe also played for the Pittsburgh Steelers, New York Jets, and Philadelphia Eagles. He won the Vince Lombardi Trophy with the Steelers in Super Bowl XL against the Seattle Seahawks.\n\nVon Oelhoffen graduated from Moloka'i High School which did not have a football team. He played one season of high school football at Moanalua High School, which is located on the Hawaiian island of Oahu, in 1985.\n\nVon Oelhoffen started playing at the University of Hawaii, transferring to Walla Walla Community College the next year and finally settling at Boise State University. He suffered a number of injuries in college that slowed his development including a stress fracture in his foot in 1992 and a sprained ankle in 1993.\n\nThe Cincinnati Bengals selected Von Oelhoffen with the first pick of the sixth round of the 1994 NFL Draft. In his first three seasons, he was largely a reserve, moving into the starting lineup in 1997. The next season, Von Oelhoffen became a mainstay of the defensive line, starting every game and finishing second in tackles among defensive linemen.\n\nAfter a strong 1999 season, where he recorded 24 tackles and four sacks, he signed with the Pittsburgh Steelers as an unrestricted free agent on a four-year $11 million contract. Pittsburgh initially inserted him as the starting nose tackle and converted him to defensive end. Von Oelhoffen would start all but one game from the 2000-2005 seasons. He won a Super Bowl ring in 2005 in his final season as a Steeler.\n\nDuring the 2005 Wildcard Playoff game against the Cincinnati Bengals, his former team, Von Oelhoffen was involved in a controversial hit on Bengals quarterback Carson Palmer that occurred on the Bengals second play from scrimmage, after which it knocked Palmer out of the game with a severe knee injury. Von Oelhoffen, coming off a block set by guard Eric Steinbach, rolled into Palmer's left knee after Palmer released a pass 66 yards down field to wide receiver Chris Henry, who was also injured on the play. The injury to Palmer was severe, including damage to his anterior cruciate ligament, medial collateral ligament, and posterior cruciate ligament. MRI's later determined that Palmers ACL, PCL, and MCL were all torn as a result of the hit. Cincinnati fans booed at him after watching the replays on the jumbotron, thinking that a flag should've been thrown for a late hit or roughing the passer. However, no flag was thrown because the hit was deemed legal at the time.\nVon Oelhoffen later apologized publicly for the hit rather than contact Palmer directly about the incident. Though Palmer confirmed that von Oelhoffen never contacted him personally to apologize, Palmer stated that the injury was, \"just part of the game.\"\n\nDuring the off-season, the NFL Rules Committee modified the rule regarding low hits on quarterbacks. The so-called \"Kimo Clause\" now requires that defenders take every opportunity to avoid hitting a quarterback at or below the knees when the quarterback is in a defenseless position looking to throw with both feet on the ground.\n\nFor the 2006 season, Von Oelhoffen signed with the New York Jets on a three-year $9.2 million deal. He spent one season with the Jets, viewed somewhat as a disappointment given his $3.2 million signing bonus.\n\nAfter being released by the Jets in training camp, Von Oelhoffen signed a one-year deal with the Philadelphia Eagles. He would appear in eight games for them during that season. He was later released by the team. He has since retired from professional football.\n\n"}

It is the longest north-south Autoroute, beginning as the continuation of I-91 at the Canada–United States border near Stanstead and continuing to Shawinigan, where it downgrades to Route 155. The total length of A-55 is currently long, including concurrencies with Autoroute 10, Autoroute 20 and Autoroute 40.\n\nAutoroute 55 connects the mid-sized communities of Sherbrooke, Drummondville, Trois-Rivières, and Shawinigan and the smaller communities in between. The most notable feature on A-55 is the Laviolette Bridge between Trois-Rivières and Bécancour, which is one of the longest bridges in Quebec and in Canada.\n\nA-55 had a short \"gap\" between Bécancour and Drummondville until October 2006. The gap resulted from Transports Quebec's original intention of bringing A-55 southeast towards Victoriaville along what is now Autoroute 955 before shifting southwest to rejoin existing A-55 near Richmond. However, plans changed in the 1970s, and the present routing was chosen. The southern section was originally supposed to be Autoroute 51 and was intended to continue to the planned extension of Autoroute 30 in Pierreville. A-55 was signed along Route 155 (which is not an Autoroute-standard highway) until the new route was completed.\n\nAll of the southern portion of A-55 became a full four-lane freeway by the end of October 2006. The gap being filled in the northern portion will initially be a two-lane freeway for about , but it is intended to ultimately be four lanes.\n\nThe designation \"Autoroute Joseph-Armand Bombardier\" is in honour of Quebec businessman Joseph-Armand Bombardier, who lived in Valcourt, near where A-55 passes and who invented the snowmobile there. His company, Bombardier Inc., started by building snowmobiles and eventually grew into a major international manufacturer of transit vehicles and aircraft.\n\nThe designation \"Autoroute de l'Énergie\" means \"Energy Highway\" since it provides access to the Gentilly Nuclear Generating Station in Bécancour and the hydroelectric facilities in Shawinigan and the Haut-Saint-Maurice area, but the section north of A-30 is likely to remain at its comparatively short length to Shawinigan for the foreseeable future.\n\n"}

Howe played 17 seasons in the National Hockey League for the Ottawa Senators, Philadelphia Quakers, Toronto Maple Leafs, St. Louis Eagles and Detroit Red Wings.\n\nHowe played in the NHL from 1929–30 to 1945–46 primarily with the Detroit Red Wings where he would enjoy his greatest personal and team successes. One of the leading scorers of his era, Syd Howe was a part of three Stanley Cup championships with the Red Wings.\n\nSyd Howe often skated on Patterson's Creek and the Rideau Canal with his brother Lawrence 'Pete' Howe while growing up in his hometown of Ottawa, Ontario. He played hockey with the Glebe Collegiate high school team and the Lansdowne Park Juveniles in 1926 before joining the Ottawa Gunners junior team in the newly formed Ottawa City Hockey League. He and his Gunners teammates became the first Ottawa club to reach the Memorial Cup finals when they took on the Regina Monarchs in 1928, losing the best-of-three final by two games to one. Howe was a top scorer during the playdowns, registering nine goals and 13 points in eight games.\n\nHe joined the NHL with his hometown Ottawa Senators for the last 12 games of the 1929–30 season and was loaned to the Philadelphia Quakers for the 1930–31 season, the Quakers' only year of existence. When Ottawa suspended operations for the 1931–32 season, Howe was picked up by the Toronto Maple Leafs in the dispersal draft, but he appeared in just three NHL games, spending most of his time on the farm with the Syracuse Stars of the International Hockey League. He was back with the Senators the following year and moved with the club to St. Louis, as a member of the St. Louis Eagles, in the 1934–35 season. (Howe holds the unique distinction of being the only man to pay for both the Philadelphia Quakers and the St. Louis Eagles.) The Eagles sold Howe in February 1935 to the Detroit Red Wings, where his career could finally get on track.\n\nHowe was on the ice in the Montreal Forum at 2:25 a.m. on March 25, 1936, when Mud Bruneteau scored in the sixth overtime period to give Detroit the win in game one of the best-of-five semi-final against the Montreal Maroons, the longest game in league history. The Red Wings went on to win the series and the Stanley Cup that spring and followed up with another Stanley Cup victory in 1937.\n\nOn March 19, 1940, Howe scored 25 seconds into overtime to give the Wings a 2–1 victory over the New York Americans in game one of the quarter-finals. It was Howe's most cherished moment of his career and would stand as the fastest overtime goal scored in NHL history for the next 29 years. He also set the modern-day NHL record by scoring six goals in a game on February 3, 1944, versus the New York Rangers, a record which has since been twice equaled but never bettered in over fifty years of play. He was named to the NHL Second Team All-Star squad as a left winger in 1945 and played in the 1939 benefit All-Star game for Babe Siebert.\n\nIn his NHL career, he scored 237 goals and 291 assists for 528 points in 691 games. In the playoffs, he totaled 17 goals and 27 assists for 44 points in 70 games. He won the Stanley Cup with Detroit Red Wings in 1936, 1937 and 1943. In 1934–35, he was runner-up to Charlie Conacher for the scoring title with 47 points in 50 games despite playing much of the season with the last-place St. Louis Eagles. In 1943–44, he racked up 32 goals and 60 points in just 46 games, however, league-wide scoring was inflated due to World War II. In a February 3, 1944 game against the New York Rangers, Howe scored six goals in a single game, a total that has been surpassed only once when Joe Malone scored seven.\n\nHowe was an all-around player, shifting between left wing and centre as needed, killing penalties and dropping back to play defence in a pinch. Those who watched the team closely reported that Howe's ice time with the Red Wings would constitute an amazing total.\n\nUpon playing his last NHL game in 1946, Howe was the last active player who played for the Philadelphia Quakers and the original era of the Ottawa Senators. He would return to Ottawa, and play again for the Ottawa Senators, now in the Quebec Senior Hockey League.\n\nAlthough not related, right wing Gordie Howe joined the Red Wings the following season (1946–47) and remained with the club until 1971 thus giving the Wings a star forward named Howe on its roster for 37 consecutive seasons (1934–1971). Syd Howe was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1965, and died eleven years later on May 20, 1976, of throat cancer at age 64. He was interred in the Capital Memorial Gardens in Ottawa.\n\n\n\n"}

It was the alternate capital of the Chu state in the Spring and Autumn period and the Warring States period.\n\nBecause the Jiajing Emperor (r. 1521–1566) of the Ming dynasty was born and had lived in the city before he succeeded to the throne, Zhongxiang, the place where the Chengtian Prefecture (\"fu\") Government Office was located, became one of the three major prefectures directly under the central government. Once on the throne, the Jiajing Emperor controversially had his dead father Zhu Youyuan (1476–1519) retroactively styled as the Gongruixian Emperor; his mother became the Zhangsheng empress dowager. They were buried at a sumptuous mausoleum, knowns as the Xianling Tomb, a few kilometers northeast of Zhongxiang.\n\nDuring the Jiajing Emperor's reign, a large estate owned by the emperor occupied a significant part of Chengtian Prefecture, and was run by the same eunuch who was in charge of the protection of the mausoleum.\n\nThe mausoleum complex is now a tourist site; it was included on the List of UNESCO World Heritage Sites in 2000, as one of the Imperial Tombs of the Ming and Qing Dynasties.\n\nZhongxiang, with a total land area of , is situated in the central part of Hubei. It lies at the north of Jianghan Plain, and the middle reaches of the Han River, with latitude ranging from 30° 42' to 31° 36' N and longitude 112° 07' to 113° 00' E, and a maximum north-south extent of and east-west width of . The urban area is at above sea level. After the building of the Three Gorges Dam a number of people from the Gaoyang area moved to the area around Zhongxiang. It borders Suizhou to the northeast, Jingshan County to the east, Tianmen to the south, the two districts (urban area) of Jingmen to the west, and Yicheng to the northwest.\n\nZhongxiang has a four-season humid subtropical climate (Köppen \"Cfa\"), with cold, damp (but comparatively dry), winters, and hot, humid summers. The average annual temperature is . July is the hottest month, with an average temperature . January is the coldest month, with an average temperature of . The coldest temperature ever recorded in Zhongxiang was on January 30, 1977.\n\nZhongxiang has abundant precipitation throughout the year, with average precipitation of every year. Rain and heat are occurring in the same season. Snow is infrequent. Zhongxiang receives plenty of sunshine, with about 1930.8 to 2114.3 hours every year.\n\nZhongxiang is administratively equal to a county and is divided into 17 township-level division: 1 subdistrict, 15 towns, and 1 township.\n\nAfter years of construction, an industrial structure has been initially formed by the development of machinery, building materials, chemicals, light industry, textile and food industry. Among more than 600 industrial products, 20 of them entered international markets, 45 species are at national leading level and 130 species are at the leading level in Hubei province.\n\nAs of 2009, 265 main industrial enterprises contribute 19.563 billion yuan to the city's industrial output value with a sales value of 18.9747 billion yuan, export delivery value of 307.16 million yuan.\nZhongXiang has diversified terrain and appropriate subtropical monsoon climate. The total land area is 4760 square kilometer, with 1300 square kilometer cultivated land 300 square kilometer uncultivated land. Area for forest, waters and pasture is 1300 square kilometer, 50 square kilometer and 1200 square kilometer respectively. The total amount of freshwater resources is 5104.2 billion cubic meters.\n\nWith diversified terrain, there are different kinds of agricultural products. Main agricultural products include grains, cotton, oil, pigs, poultry, fruits, vegetables, and edible fungus. Main crops includes rice, wheat, corn, soybean silkworm peas, and cotton, rapeseed, peanut, sesame, vegetables, citrus fruit, pears, grape, red jujube, peaches, tea, etc.\n\nIn 2009, the municipal agricultural output value reached 8.2 billion yuan. Total agricultural production includes 816500 tons total grain output, 144100 tons cotton output, 120700 tons oil production; 92000 tons animal production; 110000 tons output of aquatic products; 193300 tons fruit production.\n"}

One of their stories was a post-apocalyptic adventure story called \"The Morrow Project\", about people who awake from cryogenic sleep 150 years after a nuclear holocaust. After completing two chapters, the two left the story in hiatus. \n\nThe following year, Tucholka was introduced to the \"Dungeons & Dragons\" role-playing game (RPG), and he quickly realized that \"The Morrow Project\" could become an RPG. Using the story's setting as source material, Tucholka created the game background, and he and Sadler approached Kevin Dockery to add military realism to the game. After playtesting it at a local Michigan games convention, Tucholka, Sadler and Dockery formed Timeline Ltd. in 1979 to publish the new RPG. \n\nAlmost immediately, Tucholka and Sadler left Timeline due to creative differences with Dockery and formed their own games company, Tacky Tack Games, based in Pontiac, Michigan. Their first product was the light-hearted microgame \"Geriatric War\", a fast-paced game where \"characters battle over a few pension checks that survive the Social Security collapse of 2018\". \n\nTucholka then created and published more serious RPGs such as \"Fringeworthy\", the first RPG about dimensional travel, \"Bureau 13\", the first horror RPG, and \"\", a space opera RPG. Given the more serious tone of these works, the company name was changed from Tacky Tack Games to the more professional-sounding Tri Tac Games in 1983. \n\nTucholka continued to create new games for Tri Tac, including \"\", \"Hardwired Hinterland\", \"Monster Squash,\" \"Pterroductyl,\" \"The Viral Vegetable Wars,\" \"Drive By,\" \"War on High,\" \"Escape From Westerville State,\" \"Baby Boomer,\" \"Duck Trooper,\" \"Beach Bunny Bimbos with Blasters\" and \"HOLES\". He also created supplements and adventure scenarios for other games, including \"Invasion U.S.\", \"Cloistrs\", \"Rogue 417\", \"Weirdzone\", \"Hellsnight\", \"Haunts\", \"Starcharts\", and the \"DM's Book Of Nasty Tricks & Misfit Magic\".\n\nTochulka was also a staff writer for \"Stardate\" and \"Stardrive\" small press magazines, and was the guest of honor at more than a dozen science fiction and games conventions.\n\nTucholka's hobbies included gardening, house restoration, reading, and B movies. He was a fan of science fiction, and his personal collection of SF novels numbered over 18,000. He died of cancer in 2017. \n\nTucholka's creation \"Bureau 13: Stalking the Night Fantastic\" was voted Best Fantasy RPG of 1991 by the RPGA Network at Gen Con 1992.\n\n\n"}

The configuration was briefly built by Robert Stephenson and Company for the Liverpool and Manchester Railway\n\nOther equivalent classifications are:\n\nThe 0-2-2 or \"Northumbrian\" wheel arrangement was first used for Stephenson's \"Rocket\", their entry for the Rainhill Trials of 1829, a competition to choose a locomotive design for the new Liverpool & Manchester Railway. Stephenson recognised that the rules of the competition favoured a fast, light locomotive of only moderate hauling power. Although George Stephenson's previous designs had been heavy four-coupled freight locomotives, \"Rocket\" was almost entirely new. Stephenson was an advocate of the adhesion railway, against the fashion of the time, and believed that the light loads for Rainhill would even allow just a single driving axle. This allowed the simplification of not requiring either a chain drive between the axles or Stephenson's invention of the external coupling rods.\n\nAchieving adequate traction required more of \"Rocket's\" weight to be over the driving axle than the carrying axle. The heavy boiler was placed forwards, with the axle beneath it, giving a 0-2-2 layout rather than 2-2-0. The cylinders were set at a steep angle, as used the year before for \"Lancashire Witch\", rather than the typical vertical cylinders of this period. The cylinders were thus over the firebox and both driver and fireman shared a footplate at the same, rear, end of the engine. Previously they had often been separated to their own ends of the engine.\n\nEricsson and Braithwaite's entry for the Trials, their \"Novelty\", was an 0-2-2 well tank locomotive. Both the driving wheels and trailing wheels were the same size, and there may also have been the facility to fit a coupling chain drive to give better adhesion 'when needed'. \"Novelty\" has also been described as a 2-2-0WT design, as there is no clear 'front' or 'rear' to this design.\n\n\"Rocket\" was the only locomotive to complete the trials successfully and Stephenson became the supplier of locomotives to the L&MR.\n\nThe 0-2-2 arrangement was subsequently used by Robert Stephenson and Company on eight locomotives supplied to the Liverpool and Manchester Railway after 1829:, \"Meteor\", \"Comet\", \"Dart\", \"Arrow\", \"Phoenix\", \"North Star\", \"Northumbrian\", and \"Majestic\". Like the rebuilt \"Rocket\", these had their cylinders set low in a near-horizontal position.\n\nThe \"Northumbrian\" type was superseded by the 2-2-0 \"Planet\" type. These reversed the layout, placing the cylinders inside, between the frames, and below the smokebox at the front. The inside cylinders were closer together, giving less of a rocking couple and so were less prone to yawing oscillation at speed. Placing the cylinders below the smokebox also permitted shorter steampipes and exhaust pipes to the blastpipe, giving better efficiency. \"Northumbrians\" were the last, and only, production locomotives with this wheel arrangement.\n\nAfter the \"Planets\", most passenger locomotives began to use a 2-2-2 arrangement, with an additional front carrying axle to give better riding at speed.\n\nIn the early 20th Century a number of railmotors were built by various railway companies in the UK where the locomotive section had an 0-2-2 wheel arrangement, but they were designed to operate semi-permanently coupled to a coach unit.\n\nThe LSWR C14 class used a similar layout, but reversed as a 2-2-0T. Their low adhesive weight gave them a poor performance and half of them were rebuilt as the 0-4-0T S14.\n"}
{"id": "1880839", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1880839", "title": "The Angel (fairy tale)", "text": "The Angel (fairy tale)\n\n\"The Angel\" () is a literary fairy tale by Hans Christian Andersen about an angel and a dead child gathering flowers to carry to Heaven. The tale was first published with three others in \"New Fairy Tales\" by C.A. Reitzel in November 1843. The four tales were received by the Danish critics with great acclaim. A print depicting the angel and child became very popular.\n\nWhen the tale opens, a child has died, and an angel is escorting him to Heaven. They wander over the Earth for a while, visiting well-known places. Along the way they gather flowers to transplant into the gardens of Heaven. The angel takes the child to a poverty-stricken area where a dead field lily lies in a trash heap. The angel salvages the flower explaining that it had cheered a crippled boy before he died. The angel then reveals he was the boy, and they continue their journey.\n\nJens Andersen, author of \"Hans Christian Andersen: A New Life\" (2005), describes God as \"one of Andersen's most beloved ghosts\" and notes that God in \"The Angel\" is a \"pleasant and helpful traveling companion [...] There are few figures in his works to whom he returns more often or examines from so many different childish angles\". The poet had an unshakable faith that a whole new existence awaited him once his spirit left his earthly frame at the appropriate time. When Andersen was assailed with doubts regarding the soul's immortality, he reverted to his child faith and could not bring himself to suggest that the human being is simply dispersed as gases and other substances to fertilize the earth at death as the scientific Niels Bryde does in Andersen's 1857 novel \"To Be or Not to Be\". Andersen regarded God as a release for those suffering and a new chance for those who have failed. God was an optimistic and promising beginning for Andersen.\n\nThe tale is completely Andersen's invention, and may have been motivated by the death of the eldest daughter of his friends, Edvard and Jette Collins. The theme of a child transformed into an angel had possessed Andersen since the completion of his poem \"The Dying Child\". According to Gustav Hetsch, the story is one of three Andersen stories (along with \"Beneath the Pillar and \"The Nightingale\") to have been inspired by Jenny Lind.\n\n\"The Angel\" was first published in Copenhagen on 11 November 1843 by C. A. Reitzel in the first volume of the first collection of \"New Fairy Tales\". For the first time, the phrase \"told for children\" was not part of the title—an omission Andersen scholar and biographer Jackie Wullschlager believes exhibited a new confidence on Andersen's part: \"These [tales] were the most mature and perfectly constructed tales he had written, and though some of them at once became, and have remained favorites of children, Andersen here melds together the childlike and the profound with exceptional artistry.\" The first edition of 850 was sold out by December 18, and Reitzel planned publication of another 850.\n\n\"The Angel\" was the first tale in the volume that included \"The Nightingale\", \"The Sweethearts; or, The Top and the Ball\", and \"The Ugly Duckling\". The tale was republished 18 December 1849 in \"Fairy Tales\" and again on 15 December 1862 in \"Fairy Tales and Stories\".\n\nWullschlager describes \"The Angel\" as a \"sentimental genre picture [...] that suited the taste of the times.\" A print made from an illustration of the tale by the German artist Wilhelm von Kaulbach was widely popular and sold briskly. Andersen once found the print in Portugal, a country in which he was relatively unknown.\n\n\"New Fairy Tales\" was a break-through for Andersen who, until its publication, had generally received vigorous condemnation from the Danish critics for his venture into the fairy tale genre. Reviews for the collection however were ecstatic.\n\n\n"}

The team is organised by Cricket Canada, which became an Associate Member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) in 1968.\n\nWith the United States, Canada was one of the two participants in the first ever international cricket match, played in New York City in 1844. The annual Canada–U.S. fixture is now known as the Auty Cup. Canada's first international match against a team other than the U.S. came in 1932, when Australia toured. As with the ICC associate members, the team's first major international tournament was the 1979 ICC Trophy in England, where they qualified for the 1979 World Cup after placing second to Sri Lanka. After that, Canada did not make another World Cup until 2003, although they remained one of the leading associate teams. From 2006 to 2013, Canada had both One Day International (ODI) and Twenty20 International status, making appearances at the 2007 and 2011 World Cups. However, since the introduction of the new World Cricket League divisional structure, the team has been less successful – they placed amongst the bottom teams at the 2014 World Cup Qualifier and the 2015 WCL Division Two tournaments, and were consequently relegated to the 2017 Division Three event.\n\nIn April 2018, the ICC decided to grant full Twenty20 International (T20I) status to all its members. Therefore, all Twenty20 matches played between Canada and other ICC members after 1 January 2019 will be a full T20I.\n\nIt is generally thought that cricket was introduced to Canada by British soldiers after the Battle of the Plains of Abraham in 1759, although the earliest confirmed reference to cricket is of matches played on Saint Helen's Island, Quebec in 1785 on what later became the site of Expo 67.\n\nThe roots of modern Canadian cricket though come from the regions of Upper Canada, in particular Toronto, then known as York. During the early years of the nineteenth century, a schoolmaster by the name of George Anthony Barber encouraged the game there, and founded the Toronto Cricket Club in 1827. Barber instigated a game played between the Toronto Cricket Club and the cricket team of Upper Canada College in 1836, a game won by the college team. This game has been played annually ever since. As already mentioned, Canada played its first international against the USA in 1844 in New York at St George's Cricket Club, now the site of the New York University Medical Center.\n\nGeorge Parr led an English team to Canada in 1859, which was the first ever international cricket tour. A product of the tour was a book by Fred Lillywhite entitled \"The English Cricketers' Trip to Canada and the United States\", published the following year. On the tour, which also ventured into the US, the team won all five official matches against a 22 of Lower Canada (by 8 wickets at Montreal, Quebec on 26 October – 27 September), a 22 of the United States (by an innings and 64 runs at Hoboken, New Jersey on 3–5 October), a different 22 of the United States (by 7 wickets at Philadelphia on 10–12 October), a 22 of Lower Canada (by 10 wickets at Hamilton, Ontario on 17–19 October) and a further 22 of the United States (by an innings and 68 runs at Rochester, New York on 21–25 October). There were also some exhibition matches and two excursions to view the Niagara Falls.\n\nWhen Canada became a nation in 1867, cricket was so popular it was declared the national sport by John A. Macdonald, the first Prime Minister of Canada. The influence of baseball from the United States saw a decline in the popularity of cricket, despite tours from English and Australian teams. The third tour by an English team in 1872 featured none other than the famous W. G. Grace. The first Australian team to tour came in 1877, and they returned in 1893 beating Canada by an innings. Three games were played against Ireland between 1888 and 1890, Ireland winning one, with the other two drawn. A tour of North America by the Australians in 1913 saw two first-class games (both won by the tourists) against a combined Canada–USA team.<section begin=canadausa/><section end=canadausa/> The second of these, played at Rosedale, Toronto, was the first first-class match played in Canada.\n\nAfter an unofficial tour in 1880, which saw the Canadian captain arrested during a game against Leicestershire and the tour abandoned, the first official tour of the United Kingdom by a Canadian team took place in 1887. The tour started with two matches against Ireland, against whom Canada drew one game and lost the other, followed by two matches against Scotland with the same result. The tour then ventured into the north east of England with a defeat against the Gentlemen of Northumberland and a draw against Durham.\n\nThe tour then continued with various matches against county sides and others, with wins coming against the Gentlemen of Derbyshire and the Gentlemen of Warwickshire. The Canadian team finished the tour with a win/loss record of 2/5 with the remaining twelve games all drawn.\n\nThe Marylebone Cricket Club visited Canada in 1951, the highlight of which was the first first-class game played by the Canadian national team, played in Armour Heights, Toronto, which was won by the visiting side. This was followed in 1954 by a tour to England on which Canada played eighteen games, four of which were given first-class status, including one against Pakistan who were also touring England at the same time. The MCC again visited Canada in 1959 under Dennis Silk, and played a 3-day game against a Canada XI in Toronto which they won by 10 wickets. They were undefeated throughout the tour, winning most of their matches by wide margins, but had a closely fought draw against the Toronto Cricket Club. This was the decade when the Imperial Cricket Conference had plans to grant Canada Test status, but Canada themselves postponed the idea as they felt that the Canadian national team was not of sufficient standard, and that competing against full-members' sides needed some time as they wanted to improve their cricket even domestically. However, things did not go as planned and it would be fifty years before Canada next played a first-class match.\n\nThe annual series of matches between Canada and the USA continued, alternating between the countries. In the 1963 match in Toronto, Ray Nascimento scored 176, then a record for the series.\n\nCanada drew a game against Ireland in 1973, and the following year again embarked on a tour of England. The tour was a much lower profile than the 1954 tour, with the games being against club sides, county second XIs, and minor counties. Canada had a 4/6 win/loss record on the tour, with a further six games being drawn. In 1979, Canada participated in the first ICC Trophy. They reached the final of the competition, which qualified them for the 1979 World Cup, where they played their first One Day Internationals. The World Cup was not a successful tournament for the Canadians though, and they failed to progress beyond the first round, losing all three games.\n\nCanada participated in the ICC Trophy again in 1982 and 1986. They could not repeat their success of 1979 though, and failed to progress beyond the first round on both occasions. Other internationals in the 1980s include a no result game against Ireland in 1981, and a 3 wicket loss to Barbados.\n\nThe 1990s saw Canada progress up the international ladder, playing in three further ICC Trophy tournaments, their best being a seventh-place finish in 1997. They also began competing in West Indian domestic one-day cricket in 1996, and competed in the Commonwealth Games cricket tournament in 1998, though they did not progress beyond the first round.\n\n2000 saw Canada host the first ICC Americas Championship, a tournament which they won. The following year they embarked on a tour to Sri Lanka, but the highlight of 2001 was their hosting of the ICC Trophy. They finished third in the tournament, which qualified them for the 2003 World Cup. It was this ICC Trophy tournament that first saw the emergence of John Davison, who was to become one of Canada's most successful players.\n\nCanada played various matches in the buildup to the World Cup, visiting Argentina in April 2002, finishing as runners up to longtime rivals the US in the Americas Championship, swiftly followed by a fifth-place finish in the ICC 6 Nations Challenge in Namibia. The West Indian A team toured Canada later in the year, and Canada won the one-day series 2–1, and drew a two-day game. This was followed by Canada's best performance to date in West Indian domestic one-day cricket, winning two games in their first round group, just missing out on qualification for the semi finals.\n\nThe World Cup itself was a tournament of contrasting fortunes for the Canadians. They started with their first ODI win, over Bangladesh. Two games later saw them dismissed for 36 against Sri Lanka, then the lowest score in One Day International history. The next game against the West Indies saw John Davison score the fastest ever World Cup century, although Canada lost that game, and did not progress past the first round.\n2006 started badly for Canada, with a last place finish in the Six Nations Challenge in the United Arab Emirates after Canada lost all their games. They had improved significantly by the time of the ICC Americas Championship in Bermuda, which they won. Also in 2004, Canada participated in the first ICC Intercontinental Cup, finishing as runners up to Scotland. The highlight of this tournament was the game against the US in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, when John Davison recorded the best match bowling figures since Jim Laker's 19 wickets against Australia in 1956.\n\nIn 2005, Canada again finished third in the ICC Trophy, which gained them official ODI status from 2006 until the 2009 ICC World Cup Qualifier, as well as qualifying them for the 2007 World Cup. Their performance in the Intercontinental Cup that year was not as good as in 2004 however, as they did not make it past the first round.\n\nIn 2006, Canada put in good performances in the four-day ICC Intercontinental Cup, beating Kenya by 25 runs and Bermuda by nine wickets, but their one-day form was a complete reversal, losing three times to Bermuda and Kenya, and a further loss to Zimbabwe.\n\nIn August, Canada took part in the first Division of the Americas Championship. They beat Argentina and longtime rivals the USA, but lost to the Cayman Islands and eventual winners Bermuda, and finished third, their worst performance so far in this tournament.\n\nIn June and July 2008, Canada hosted Bermuda for three ODIs and Intercontinental Cup matches against Bermuda and Scotland.\n\nIn August, Canada travelled to Ireland for the World Twenty20 Qualification Tournament. Canada did not qualify for the World Twenty20, finishing 5th ahead of Bermuda. The ODIs and an Intercontinental Cup match were hampered by rain.\n\nIn late summer of 2008, West Indies and Bermuda came to Canada to play in the Scotiabank One-Day Series against Canada. Canada defeated Bermuda, to face West Indies in the Final. West Indies captain Chris Gayle smashed his sixteenth ODI century and led his side to an easy seven-wicket victory against Canada in the finals of the Scotiabank ODI Series at King City.\n\nDuring the Scotiabank Series the talents of Rizwan Cheema were discovered – he would become the star of the first Al-Barakah T20 Canada. The tournament involved Canada, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe. Canada lost both and tied one match, however in the tie with Zimbabwe, Canada lost by points in a bowl-out. Sri Lanka were eventual winners, defeating Pakistan in the Final. The tournament was expected to be played annually for the following four years.\n\nIn late November 2008, Canada participated in the Americas Championship in Florida, USA. The United States, after years of disarray, pulled together and won the championship. Canada finished 3rd on Net Run Rate behind Bermuda, as their match was washed out by rain.\n\nIn April 2009 Canada participated in the 2009 ICC Cricket World Cup Qualification Tournament. Assembling the best Canadian team in many years, Canada rolled through the opening stages of the event and eventually finished second in the tournament. The impressive display earned Canada a berth in the 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup.\n\nThe ICC announced that the 2015 Cricket World Cup will only have 10 participating teams – this makes it difficult for the Associate Countries to qualify for the world cup. Cricket Canada expressed its unhappiness with the reduced world cup\n\nIn January 2014, Canada lost ODI & T20I status and with no prospect of big-stage international cricket to come until next qualifier, owing to a poor performance at the World Cup Qualifier in New Zealand.\n\nThe big event for Canada to make a mark in the year 2015 was the ICC World Twenty20 Qualifier in Ireland and Scotland. Unfortunately, Canada failed to win a single match and finished at the bottom of Group B.\n\nIn the first match, against Kenya in the picturesque Edinburgh, Canada put together 143 runs in 20 overs with the loss of 5 wickets. In response, Irfan Karim's 54-ball 74 led Kenya to a convincing seven-wicket win.\n\nThe second match for Canada was against the relative newcomers to the scene, Oman, and was played in Stirling, Scotland. This game was reduced to 13 overs a side, down from 20 due to inclement weather. Canada's batting, after Oman opted to bowl first, was largely put together courtesy of a 25-ball 52 from Nitish Kumar, who scored four fours and three sixes. In response, Zeeshan Maqsood's unbeaten 86, powered Oman to a seven-wicket win with 10 balls to spare.\n\nCanada played their third match of the tournament at the same venue in Stirling, Scotland against United Arab Emirates. UAE got off to the ideal start. Aside from winning the coin-toss, they decided to bowl first. Canada, batting first, lost their first 2 wickets in the first 8 balls bowled. It was followed by a solid partnership between Hiral Shah and Nitish Kumar who plundered 58 runs between them. But the tide turned again in UAE's favor as they picked up a heap of wickets to reduce Canada down to 109 for the loss of 9 wickets. But Navneet Dhaliwal came to the rescue with an unbeaten 39 to raise the total to 132 runs at the end of 20 overs. In response, UAE lost their first wicket in the third over but good partnerships for the second (25 runs), third (40 runs) and fourth (19 runs) wickets kept them on track. The match seemed level when the target was whittled down to 33 runs required in three overs which came down to 25 runs required off 12 balls. But, Shakoor and Patil brought UAE home in the last over after plundering Cecil Parvez for 21 runs in his final over.\n\nCanada shifted back to Edinburgh for their fourth match of the tournament against hosts Scotland. Canada had lost the coin-toss again in this match and the home team inserted Canada into batting first. They got off to a quick start, racing to 24 in 2.3 overs before Alasdair Evans dismissed Ruvindu Gunasekara. The other bowlers too did not allow any meaningful partnerships to develop between any of the Canadian batsmen, reducing them to 87 for the loss of 8 wickets by the 16th over. A 48-run, ninth-wicket partnership between Navneet Dhaliwal (34*) and No. 10 Junaid Siddiqui, who scored 28 off 16, took them past the triple-figure mark to help them finish on 135 for 8. In response, Scotland started off brightly – at a stunning rate of 10 runs per over till the sixth over – even as Satsimranjit Dhindsa got rid of Calum MacLeod for a 15-ball 29. The wicket didn't cost Scotland much as they went about with the same momentum despite losing Matthew Cross to Dhindsa as well, and cruised to a comfortable win with 32 balls to spare.\n\nCanada played their fifth and final match of the tournament at the same venue in Edinburgh against Netherlands. They lost the toss again and were inserted to bat again. This time though, the batting showed resilience and the team put together a total of 172 for the loss of 8 wickets which came on the back of a half-century from Ruvindu Gunasekera (51) and late blitzes from team captain Rizwan Cheema and wicket-keeper batsman Hamza Tariq. In response, the Netherlands batsmen, particularly Steven Myburgh, Wesley Barresi and Michael Swart led an attacking display of powerful batting to record a solid win for their team with 15 balls to spare. Thus, ending a dismal 2015 ICC World Twenty20 Qualifier for the Canada national cricket team.\n\nFollowing the dismal performance at the 2015 ICC World Twenty20 qualifier, some positive news followed for the Canada national cricket team players. Twenty one players from Canada along with USA, Bermuda and Suriname were shortlisted to play for an 'ICC Americas' regional team to take part in West Indies' Nagico Super50 tournament in January 2016. By the end of the process, Jeremy Gordon was the only Canada bowler to be included and Canadian Hamza Tariq was brought in as a specialist wicket keeper in the final 15 man ICC Americas squad declared to participate in West Indies' Nagico Super50 in January 2016.\n\nCanada's squad for the 2019 ICC World Cricket League Division Two in Namibia from 20–27 April 2019.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational Match Summary – Canada\n\n\"Last updated 27 October 2019.\"\n\n\nMost ODI runs for Canada\n\nMost ODI wickets for Canada\n\nHighest individual innings in ODI \n\nBest bowling figures in an innings in ODI \n\nODI record versus other nations\n\n\nMost T20I runs for Canada\n\nMost T20I wickets for Canada\n\nT20I record versus other nations\n\n\n\n"}

The type was initially designed for freight haulage. One of the earliest examples was the broad-gauge GWR Leo Class, designed by Daniel Gooch and built during 1841 and 1842 by R and W Hawthorn and Company, Fenton, Murray and Jackson, and Rothwell and Company. Because of its popularity for a period with English railways, noted railway author C. Hamilton Ellis considered the 2-4-0 designation to have the nickname (under the Whyte notation) of Old English.\n\nDuring 1846-47, Alexander Allan of the newly established London and North Western Railway (LNWR) created the \"Crewe type\" of locomotive, with a 2-2-2 wheel arrangement for passenger classes and 2-4-0 for freight. During the 1850s and 1860s these designs were widely copied by other railways, both in the United Kingdom and overseas.\nDuring the mid-1840s, Sir John Hawkshaw developed a new style of 2-4-0 passenger locomotive with outside cylinders in front of the leading wheels and the rear driving axle behind the firebox. This layout provided steady running at high speeds, despite a long overhang at the front.\n\nJoseph Beattie of the London and South Western Railway was one of the first British locomotive engineers to use this type on express locomotives. From 1858, he began experimenting with 2-4-0 designs for passenger work, culminating in his \"Seven-Foot\" express passenger locomotives, built between 1859 and 1868. Beattie was also responsible for the long-lived 0298 Class of 2-4-0 well tanks, designed for suburban passenger work in 1874, some examples of which were still working in 1961. A locomotive of this type hauled the first \"Orient Express\" from Paris to Munich, a notable achievement for such a small engine.\n\nAfter 1854, the \"Hawkshaw type\" of 2-4-0 was adopted by Beyer, Peacock and Company, who built many examples of the type for export, including to the Swedish State Railways (Statens Järnvägar) in 1856 and the Zealand Railway in Denmark in 1870.\n\nThe Bavarian B V and Bavarian B VI 2-4-0 locomotives of the Royal Bavarian State Railways (Königlich Bayerische Staats-Eisenbahnen) were the first types to be produced in Bavaria in large numbers. In all, 208 were built between 1853 and 1863. One example is preserved in the Nuremberg Transport Museum.\nBetween 1864 and 1869, the Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg Friedrich-Franz Railway bought 19 \"Hawkshaw\" type Mecklenburg III locomotives from Richard Hartmann in Chemnitz.\n\nBetween 1877 and 1885, altogether 294 passenger locomotives of the Prussian P 2 class were delivered to the Prussian State Railways and its forebears.\n\nIn New Zealand, two classes of tank locomotive were built with the 2-4-0T wheel arrangement. They were the New Zealand Railways (NZR) D class in 1874 and 1929, and the NZR L class in 1878, both classes having been designed for mixed traffic use.\n\nFive D class locomotives were built by Dübs and Company in Glasgow, Scotland, nineteen were built by Neilson and Company and eleven were built by Scott Brothers Ltd. of Christchurch. The first members of the D class entered service in 1874 and all had been withdrawn from NZR service by the end of 1927, which allowed the D classification to be used again in 1929.\n\nOf the 33 D class locomotives built, seven have been preserved, although only D16 and D140 were in operational condition.\n\nAll ten L class locomotives were built by the Avonside Engine Company in Bristol. The first L class built, entered service in 1878 and another nine L class locomotives were ordered. In 1893-94, three of the L class 2-4-0T locomotives were rebuilt to a 4-4-0 wheel arrangement at Newmarket workshops, with larger boilers and enlarged cylinders. This new design was classified La, but their limited coal bunker capacity remained a drawback. The solution was to add a trailing pony truck to accommodate a larger coal bunker, converting them to a 4-4-2T wheel arrangement. A further four L class locomotives were similarly converted. Three were not rebuilt, but sold to the Public Works Department between 1901 and 1903. Three new locomotives were built in 1902-03. When the conversion program was completed in 1903, the classification for all ten remaining NZR locomotives was changed back to L.\n\nOf the ten L class locomotives built, numbers 207 (507), 208 (508) and 219 (509) survived long enough to be preserved, all three operational.\n\nA standard gauge railway line between Salt River and Wynberg in the Cape of Good Hope, constructed with private capital, was opened to the public on 19 December 1864. The Cape Town Railway and Dock Company undertook to rent and operate the line and acquired three 2-4-0 tank locomotives as motive power for the line in 1864.\n\nIn 1872, the locomotives came onto the roster of the Cape Government Railways when it took over the operation of all railways in the Cape of Good Hope. They remained in service on this line until after its conversion to dual standard-and-Cape gauges around 1872 and were retired in 1881, when sufficient Cape gauge locomotives were in service.\n\nBefore 1846, the type was used on the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, the Birmingham and Gloucester Railway, the North Midland Railway and the London and South Western Railway (LSWR).\nBetween 1846 and 1880, the 2-4-0 was the standard type for passenger and mixed traffic locomotives and was built in large numbers by, amongst others, the LNWR (1846–96), the Midland Railway (1846–1880), the Great Northern Railway (1849–97), the North Eastern Railway (1856–88) and the Great Eastern Railway (1856–1902).\n\nMost United Kingdom railways used 2-4-0s, including those designed by James Holden on the Great Eastern Railway, Matthew Kirtley on the Midland Railway, Joseph Armstrong on the Great Western Railway and Francis Webb on the London and North Western Railway. One of the latter's types, the \"Precedent\" (or \"Jumbo\") class \"Hardwicke\" famously set outstanding records for the LNWR during the \"Race to the North\" in 1895.\n\nIn the collection of the California State Railroad Museum is the \"J.W. Bowker\" locomotive, a engine built by Baldwin Locomotive Works in 1875 for the Virginia & Truckee Railroad. Today, the \"J.W. Bowker\" is the sole remaining Baldwin 2-4-0 in existence.\n\nAt the Cedar Point amusement park in Sandusky, Ohio, four 2-4-0s run tourist trains around a two-mile loop of track alongside Lake Erie and pass many of the park's attractions. Two of the 2-4-0s were built by Vulcan Iron Works as 0-4-0Ts in 1922 and 1923 and now run as the \"Myron H.\" no. 22 and \"Judy K.\" no. 44 respectively. They are the two main engines for the Cedar Point & Lake Erie Railroad. The third engine was built by H.K. Porter, Inc. as an 0-4-0T in 1942 and now runs as the \"George R.\" no. 4. The fourth engine was built by Davenport Locomotive Works as a 2-4-4T in 1927 and now runs as the \"G. A. Boeckling\" no. 1. No. 1 was converted from oil-burning in 2010 and all engines now run on coal.\n"}

Weather-worn cookshops and bars line the sand's edge, supplying food staples such as curried goat and Red Stripe beer.\n\nAlligator Pond lies at the foot of the Don Figueroa Mountains to the north-east, some 35 km from Mandeville.

The International Astronomical Union uses the name \"Cor Caroli\" specifically for the brighter star of the binary. Alpha Canum Venaticorum is the brightest point of light in the northern constellation of Canes Venatici.\n\n\"α Canum Venaticorum\" (Latinised to \"Alpha Canum Venaticorum\") is the system's Bayer designation. The brighter of the two stars is designated \"α Canum Venaticorum\", the fainter \"α Canum Venaticorum\".\n\nIn the western world Alpha Canum Venaticorum had no name until the 17th century, when it was named \"Cor Caroli\", which means \"Charles's Heart\". There has been some uncertainty whether it was named in honour of King Charles I of England, who was executed in 1649 during the English Civil War, or of his son, Charles II, who restored the English monarchy to the throne in 1660. The name was coined in 1660 by Sir Charles Scarborough, physician to Charles II, who claimed the star seemed to shine exceptionally brightly on the night of Charles II's return to England. In \"Star Names\", R.H. Allen claimed that Scarborough suggested the name to Edmond Halley and intended it to refer to Charles II. However, Robert Burnham Jr. notes that \"the attribution of the name to Halley appears in a report published by J. E. Bode at Berlin in 1801, but seems to have no other verification\". In \"Star Tales\", Ian Ridpath points out that the name's first appearance on a star map was in the 1673 chart of Francis Lamb, who labelled it \"Cor Caroli Regis Martyris\" ('the heart of Charles the martyred king'), clearly indicating that it was seen as referring to Charles I.\n\nIn 2016, the International Astronomical Union organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalog and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN's first bulletin of July 2016 included a table of the first two batches of names approved by the WGSN; which included \"Cor Caroli\" for the star α Canum Venaticorum.\n\nIn Chinese, (), meaning \"Imperial Guards\", refers to an asterism consisting of α Canum Venaticorum, 10 Canum Venaticorum, Beta Canum Venaticorum, 6 Canum Venaticorum, 2 Canum Venaticorum, 67 Ursae Majoris. Consequently, the Chinese name for Alpha Canum Venaticorum itself is (, .) From this Chinese name, the name \"Chang Chen\" was derived.\n\nAlpha Canum Venaticorum is a binary star with a combined apparent magnitude of 2.81. The two stars are 19.6 arcseconds apart in the sky and are easily resolved in small telescopes. The system lies approximately 110 light years from the Sun.\n\nIt marks the northern vertex of the asterism known as the Great Diamond or the Diamond of Virgo.\n\nα Canum Venaticorum has a spectral type of A0, and has an apparent visual magnitude which varies between 2.84 and 2.98, with a period of 5.47 days. It is a chemically peculiar star with a strong magnetic field, about 5,000 times as strong as the Earth's, and is also classified as an Ap/Bp star. Its atmosphere has overabundances of some elements, such as silicon, mercury, and europium. This is thought to be due to some elements sinking down into the star under the force of gravity while others are elevated by radiation pressure. This star is the prototype of a class of variable stars, the so-called α Canum Venaticorum variables. The strong magnetic field of these stars is believed to produce starspots of enormous extent. Due to these starspots the brightness of α Canum Venaticorum stars varies considerably during their rotation.\n\nα Canum Venaticorum is a F-type main sequence star. It is considerably fainter than its companion and has an apparent visual magnitude of approximately 5.60.\n\n\"Cor Caroli\" was a United States Navy Crater class cargo ship named after the star.\n"}
{"id": "1880853", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1880853", "title": "0-4-2", "text": "0-4-2\n\nUnder the Whyte notation for the classification of steam locomotives, represents the wheel arrangement with no leading wheels, four powered and coupled driving wheels on two axles and two trailing wheels on one axle. While the first locomotives of this wheel arrangement were tender engines, the configuration was later often used for tank engines, which is noted by adding letter suffixes to the configuration, such as for a conventional side-tank locomotive, for a saddle-tank locomotive, for a well-tank locomotive and for a rack-equipped tank locomotive. The arrangement is sometimes known as Olomana after a Hawaiian 0-4-2 locomotive of 1883.\nThe earliest recorded 0-4-2 locomotives were three goods engines built by Robert Stephenson and Company for the Stanhope and Tyne Railway in 1834.\nThe first locomotive built in Germany in 1838, the \"Saxonia\", was also an . In the same year Todd, Kitson & Laird built two examples for the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, one of which, LMR 57 Lion, has been preserved. The Lion had a top speed of and could pull up to 200 tons (203 tonnes).\n\nOver the next quarter of a century, the type was adopted by many early British railways for freight haulage since it afforded greater adhesion than the contemporary 2-2-2 passenger configuration, although in time they were also used for mixed traffic duties.\n\nThe Emperor Ferdinand Northern Railway (Kaiser Ferdinands-Nordbahn) acquired the locomotives \"Minotaurus\" and \"Ajax\" from the British manufacturer Jones, Turner and Evans in 1841, to work the line between Vienna and Stockerau. The locomotive \"Ajax\" has been preserved at the \"Technisches Museum Wien\" since 1992 and is described as \"the oldest preserved steam locomotive on the European continent.\".\n\nIn Finland, the 0-4-2 wheel arrangement was represented by the Classes B1 and B2.\n\nThe Finnish Steam Locomotive Class B1 is an 0-4-2ST locomotive, built from 1868 to 1890 by Beyer, Peacock and Company at their Gorton Foundry works in Manchester, England.\n\nAlthough the type was not used by any major railroads in North America, H.K. Porter, Inc. and the Baldwin Locomotive Works produced many small tank locomotives of this type for industrial and plantation work. The 0-4-2T \"Olomana\", built by Baldwin in 1883, arrived in the Kingdom of Hawaii in August 1883 after a two-month journey around Cape Horn. It was owned by Waimanalo Sugar Company on the island of Oahu and hauled cane from the fields to its refinery.\n\nIn 1905, the \"Nederlands Indische Spoorweg\" opened a line between Yogyakarta and Ambarawa via Magelang, a hilly region requiring a rack railway because of the 6.5% gradients. The 0-4-2T wood burning B25 class was made for this line in 1902 by Maschinenfabrik Esslingen, Germany. They were four-cylinder compound locomotives with two of the cylinders working the pinion wheels.\n\nThere are two examples of B25 class locomotive still in operation, namely B25-02 and B25-03. Both were based in Ambarawa, where they have served for more than a hundred years. Locomotive B25-01 may also still be found at the entrance to the Ambarawa Railway Museum.\n\nOn the island of Sumatra, there are some larger cousins of this class being used for hauling coal trains, namely the D18 and E10 classes.\n\nThe 0-4-2T arrangement was used by two classes of locomotives operated by the New Zealand Railways Department. The first was the C class of 1873, originally built as an 0-4-0T. The class was found to be unstable at speeds higher than 15 mph, so by 1880 all members of the class had been converted to 0-4-2T to rectify this problem.\n\nThe second and more notable 0-4-2T class, and the only one actually built as 0-4-2T, was the unique H class designed to operate the Rimutaka Incline on the Wairarapa Line. The Incline's steep gradient necessitated the use of the Fell mountain railway system, and the six members of the H class spent their entire lives operating trains on the Incline. Except for a few brief experiments with other classes, the H class had exclusive use of the Incline from their introduction in 1875 until the Incline's closure in 1955. The class leader, H 199, is preserved on static display at the Fell Engine Museum in Featherston and is the only extant Fell locomotive in the world.\n\nThe 0-4-2T arrangement was also employed for steam locomotives operated by small private industrial railways and bush and mineral tramways. One such locomotive, built by Peckett and Sons in 1957, is currently operational on the Heritage Park Railway, Whangarei. She is one of four such locomotives imported from Peckett and Sons, and was the very last steam locomotive imported into New Zealand in the steam era.\nTwo others worked alongside her and are preserved, whilst the fourth was owned by a forestry railway, who converted her to a Diesel locomotive.\n\nIn September 1859, Messrs. E. & J. Pickering, contractors to the Cape Town Railway and Dock Company for the construction of the Cape Town-Wellington Railway, imported a small 0-4-0 side-tank steam locomotive from England for use during the construction of the railway. This was the first locomotive in South Africa. In c. 1874, the locomotive was rebuilt to a 0-4-2T configuration before it was shipped to Port Alfred, where it served as construction locomotive on the banks of the Kowie river and was nicknamed \"Blackie\". It has been declared a heritage object and was plinthed in the main concourse of Cape Town station.\n\nIn 1860, the Cape Town Railway and Dock Company took delivery of eight standard gauge tender locomotives with a 0-4-2 wheel arrangement for service on the Cape Town-Wellington Railway, which was still under construction. They remained in service on this line while it was being converted to dual standard-and-Cape gauges from around 1872 and were only retired in 1881, when sufficient Cape gauge locomotives were in service.\n\nTwo tank engine classes of this wheel arrangement were supplied to the \"Nederlandsche-Zuid-Afrikaansche Spoorweg-Maatschappij\" (NZASM) by Maschinenfabriek Esslingen and Breda, Nederland between 1890 and 1894.\n\nBetween 1897 and 1901, several 0-4-2 saddle tank steam locomotives, built for narrow gauge by Dickson Manufacturing Company of Scranton in Pennsylvania, were delivered to various gold mines on the Witwatersrand by Arthur Koppel, acting as importing agents. In 1915, when an urgent need arose for additional locomotives in \"Deutsch-Südwest-Afrika\" during the First World War, two of these locomotives were purchased second-hand by the SAR for use on the narrow gauge lines in that territory. The two locomotives remained in South West Africa after the war and were later designated Class NG2 on the SAR.\nThe Namaqua Copper Company's first gauge locomotive, acquired in 1901, was a Dick, Kerr-built 0-4-2ST named \"Pioneer\" which was rebuilt from the configuration, possibly due to the additional weight of fuel tanks which were installed under the cab when it was converted to use fuel oil. The company also operated four more tank locomotives, one 9 Ton and three 12 Ton, possibly also acquired from Dick, Kerr.\n\nIn 1904, a single gauge 0-4-2 inverted saddle-tank locomotive named \"Caledonia\" was placed in service by the Cape Copper Company as a shunting engine at O'okiep in the Cape Colony.\n\nIn 1905, the Cape Copper Company also placed a single 0-4-2 tank locomotive named \"Britannia\" in service as a shunting engine at Port Nolloth in the Cape Colony.\n\nFrom the mid-1860s onwards, the 0-4-2 wheel arrangement tended only to be used on tank engines in the United Kingdom. Exceptions were in Scotland on the Caledonian and Glasgow and South Western railways and in southern England on the London Brighton and South Coast Railway (LB&SCR) and the London and South Western Railway. The LB&SCR uniquely built express passenger 0-4-2 tender classes until 1891.\nFrom 1868, the Great Western Railway built a number of standard gauge 0-4-2T classes for branch line passenger work to a design known as the 517 class by engineer George Armstrong. This design was developed until the GWR 1400 Class was built between 1932 and 1936, designed for push-pull autotrains. These were the last British examples of this wheel arrangement. Four of them have been preserved.\n\nWilliam Stroudley of the LB&SCR built four very successful 0-4-2 classes, three tenders and one tank, between 1873 and 1891. The first of these was his powerful D-tank for suburban passenger work. By 1887, 125 of these had been built, some of which survived in service until 1951. However, the most famous 0-4-2 class were his Gladstone class express passenger locomotives, the first of which has been preserved.\n\nThe Casper for South Fork and Eastern railroad used an locomotive number two \n\"Daisey\" an 1885 Baldwin 0-4-2T locomotive to haul its logging operations in its early days (Baldwin builder number 7558). That locomotive still survives and is on display next to the skunk train depot on Laurel Street in Fort Bragg. Viewing the locomotive is free to the public in the little mall next door to the train depot. There is also an 18 0-4-0t locomotive on display. That locomotive is California Western railroad locomotive number one (was assembled in 1875 by a smaller locomotive manufacture, but serial numbers on the frame point to the Baldwin locomotive works.\n"}

Prior to the season, Colorado was assigned to the Pacific Division of the Western Conference. They played at McNichols Arena, the building that the New Jersey Devils played in from 1976 to 1982 when they were known as the Colorado Rockies. The Avs would play in that building until they moved to the Pepsi Center in 1999.\n\nIt was also the final season for the original Winnipeg Jets, as they announced that they would be moving from Manitoba to Arizona and become the Phoenix Coyotes at season's end. The NHL would not return to Manitoba until the Atlanta Thrashers moved there to become the \"new\" Winnipeg Jets following the 2010–11 season.\n\nThis season would mark the last season the Buffalo Sabres would play in the Buffalo Memorial Auditorium, the Philadelphia Flyers at the CoreStates Spectrum, the Senators at the Ottawa Civic Centre, and the Canadiens at the Montreal Forum. The Sabres made their new home at the Marine Midland Arena, the Flyers at the CoreStates Center, the Senators at the Corel Centre, and the Canadiens at the Molson Centre. The latter two arenas opened before the end of this season. With the Montreal Forum closed, Maple Leaf Gardens was the last remaining arena from the Original Six era at the time. The Boston Bruins played their first season at Fleet Center after spending the last 67 at the old Boston Garden, and the Vancouver Canucks played their first game at General Motors Place.\n\nDuring the 1992–93 and 1993–94 seasons, each team played 84 games (including two neutral site games). Starting in the 1995–96 season, the neutral site games were eliminated, which reduced the regular season to 82 games per team where it remains to this very day.\n\nThe Detroit Red Wings had a spectacular season, finishing with the second-highest regular-season point total in NHL history (131 points), and setting the NHL record for most wins ever in the regular season (62). However, they fell to the Avalanche in the Western Conference Final, the sixth game of which marked the beginning of the heated Detroit-Colorado rivalry, which would last for years to come. Jaromir Jagr broke the record for assists and points by a right winger in a single season . Mario Lemieux had the NHL's last 150+ point season with 161 points in 70 games. This would be the last season in which at least one player would score at least 60 goals (Jagr and Lemieux) until 2008.

They were followed by Matthew Kirtley on the Midland Railway(26 locomotive built 1869-70) and Patrick Stirling on the Great Northern Railway (48 locomotive built 1873-81). The more common side-tank version was introduced on the Great Eastern Railway by Samuel Waite Johnson in 1872, and was soon afterwards adopted by most mainline railways in the UK, and became the standard configuration for a passenger tank locomotive until about 1900. Examples have included the LSWR O2 Class, Midland Railway 2228 Class, the LSWR M7 Class and the Caledonian Railway 439 Class.

Forney between 1861 and 1864. These were characterized by a single frame under the boiler and fuel/water tank, which is supported at the rear by the truck under the coal bunker/water tank. The locomotives were designed to run cab (or bunker) first and were built for commuter lines in cities such as New York, Chicago and Boston.\n"}

Five of them are preserved in Finland, no. 950 at Joensuu, no. 951 at Tuuri, no. 953 at Haapamäki, no. 961 at Jyväskylä and no. 964 at the Veturimuseo at Toijala.\n\nThe Vr5 class was numbered in the range from 1400 to 1423. No. 1422 is preserved at Haapamäki.\n\nBetween 1890 and 1898, four 0-6-2 tender locomotives were placed in service by the Cape Copper Company on its gauge Namaqualand Railway between Port Nolloth and O'okiep in the Cape Colony. Acquired to meet the traffic needs of the upper mountainous section of the line, they became known as the Mountain type. The first three of these locomotives were later described as the Clara Class, while the fourth was included in this Class by some and included in the subsequent Scotia Class by others.\n\nBetween 1900 and 1905, six more Mountain type 0-6-2 tender locomotives were placed in service by the Cape Copper Company. Later described as the Scotia Class, they were similar to the earlier Clara Class locomotives, but with longer boilers, longer fireboxes and larger firegrates.\n\nIn 1892 and 1893, the \"Nederlandsche-Zuid-Afrikaansche Spoorweg-Maatschappij\" of the \"Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek\" (Transvaal Republic) placed twenty 0-6-2T locomotives in mainline service. Since the railway classified its locomotives according to their weight, these locomotives were known as the .\n\nThree classes of gauge 0-6-2 locomotives were supplied to German South West Africa between 1904 and 1908.\n\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the type was only ever used for tank engines and was first used by William Barton Wright of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway in 1880.\n\nThe arrangement was soon afterwards used by F.W. Webb of the London and North Western Railway on his famous \"Coal Tanks\" of 1881-1897. Many locomotives of this type were also used to haul coal in the South Wales Valleys by the Great Western Railway and its predecessors.\nSeveral railways around London later used the type for heavy suburban passenger trains, notably the following:\n\nGresley later improved upon the GER class with various versions of his London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) N7 class, built between 1925 and 1928.\n\nIn the United States, 0-6-2 locomotives were largely 2-6-0 type locomotives which had been rebuilt with a larger firebox and therefore required greater weight distribution near their backs. The leading wheels were therefore relocated to the rear as trailing wheels. Nearly all of these locomotives were assigned to switch locomotive workings or used on branch lines.\n\nMany 0-6-2 types were found in the state of Hawaii on sugar cane railroads across the state. Most notable were the 0-6-2T’s of the Mcbryde Sugar Company of Kauai, 3 of which survive and are currently the only original steam engines operating in Hawaii.\n"}

The earliest known example was the Moel Tryfan narrow gauge locomotive, built for use on the North Wales Narrow Gauge Railways. It was a Single Fairlie type, built by the Vulcan Foundry near Manchester in 1875. It was followed by the R class and S class, built by the Avonside Engine Company of England for the New Zealand Railways Department between 1878 and 1881.\n\nThe South Australian Railways K class locomotives were introduced in 1884, designed by William Thow. They were noted to run more smoothly bunker-first. After the electrification of the Mersey Railway in England, four of its 0-6-4T locomotives were sold to J. & A. Brown of New South Wales, Australia, where one, number 5, is preserved at the New South Wales Rail Transport Museum, Thirlmere, New South Wales.\n\nThree members of New Zealand's S class were also sold to the Western Australian Government Railways in 1891.\n\nNew Zealand’s R class and S class Single Fairlies were popular with crews and capable of all duties from express passenger trains to shunting tasks. The S class were limited to the Wellington Region when they were introduced, but the R class were distributed throughout the country. All were withdrawn by 1936, but R class no. 28 is preserved as a static exhibit in a Reefton park.\n\nThis wheel arrangement provided the bulk of the motive power for the \"Nederlandsche-Zuid-Afrikaansche Spoorwegmaatschappij\" (NZASM) in the \"Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek\" (ZAR). Between 1893 and 1898, 175 46 Tonner steam locomotives were placed in service, built by the \"Maschinenfabrik Esslingen\" in Germany.\n\nIn 1899, twenty more were ordered from the \"Nederlandse Fabriek van Werktuigen en Spoorwegmaterieel\" (Werkspoor) in the Netherlands, of which only two were delivered by the time the Imperial Military Railways (IMR) took over all railway operations in the ZAR during the Second Boer War. The other eighteen locomotives in this order were delivered directly to the IMR, who diverted two of them to Lourenço Marques in Mozambique.\nAt the end of the war, the survivors of these locomotives were taken onto the roster of the Central South African Railways (CSAR) and designated Class B, while the two in Mozambique were taken onto the roster of the \"Caminhos de Ferro de Mocambique\" (CFM). In 1912, the remaining CSAR locomotives were assimilated into the South African Railways (SAR).\n\nThe CFM eventually had at least thirty 46 Tonner locomotives in service. Between 1897 and 1898, some 46 Tonners were sold by the NZASM to the CFM. The two locomotives which were delivered after the outbreak of the war and diverted to Lourenço Marques upon arrival, were also taken onto the CFM roster at the end of the war. Later, between 1911 and 1920 during the CSAR and SAR eras, six more were sold to the CFM.\n\nOther than examples for export, 0-6-4T locomotives enjoyed a brief vogue in the United Kingdom prior to the First World War, but were not widely used. Nine locomotives of this type were supplied by Beyer, Peacock and Company for the opening of the Mersey Railway in 1886.\n\nWilliam Dean built three crane tanks in 1901, and Kitson & Co. of Leeds supplied nine locomotives to the Lancashire, Derbyshire and East Coast Railway in 1904.\n\nOther examples included the Midland Railway 2000 Class of 1907, the Highland Railway Drummond 0-6-4T Class of 1909, the SECR J class of 1913 and the Metropolitan Railway G Class of 1915. The type was eventually superseded by the popular 2-6-4T locomotive.\n\nIn the United States, the 0-6-4 locomotive was largely built only for use in railyards, essentially as an adaptation of an 0-6-0 switch engine with an extended firebox, or a 4-6-0 reconstructed with a larger firebox which necessitated the relocation of the leading wheels to the rear to support the firebox. Some Mason Bogie locomotives used this wheel arrangement.\n"}

An early modern proponent of infantry tactics, he established his reputation in active service during the Italian Wars under Emperor Maximilian I and his successor Charles V.\n\nFrundsberg was born to Ulrich von Frundsberg, a captain of the Swabian League forces, and his wife Barbara von Rechberg at Mindelheim, into an old line of Tyrolean knights who had settled in Upper Swabia.\n\nIn 1492 he followed his father in the campaign of the Hohenzollern margrave Frederick I of Brandenburg-Ansbach, authorized to execute the Imperial ban against Duke Albert IV of Bavaria. As Albert gave in, the expedition was cancelled. Frundsberg fought for the Habsburg emperor Maximilian I against the Swiss Confederacy in the Swabian War of 1499, where he had to realize that the era of the heavy armoured knights was well and truly over. In the same year he was among the Imperial troops sent to the aid of Ludovico Sforza, who had been deposed as Duke of Milan by King Louis XII of France. When Maximilian appointed him Tyrolean military captain, he recruited a powerful army of pike square infantry formations following the Swiss example.\n\nStill serving Maximilian, he took part in the 1504 War of the Succession of Landshut, fighting against Count Ruprecht of the Palatinate and his father Elector Palatine Philip. Frundsberg distinguished himself leading a Landsknecht regiment into the decisive Battle of Wenzenbach, whereafter Maximilian I personally bestowed knighthood on him: armed with muskets and culverines, the Frundsberg regiment broke a breach into the wagon-wall of the Bohemian mercenaries (composed 300+ wagons), which were then routed. Convinced of the necessity of a native body of trained infantry, Frundsberg assisted Maximilian in the organization of the Landsknecht troops. One year later, he became the commander of the Landsknechts in the Habsburg Netherlands.\n\nThereafter, Frundsberg lived an uninterrupted life of war, campaigning for the Empire and the Habsburgs. In 1509, he was appointed \"Highest Field Captain\" of the Landsknecht Regiment (occupation force) and participated in the War of the League of Cambrai against the Republic of Venice, winning fame for himself and his men after defending the city of Verona against numerous attacks. In 1512 he was, together with Jakob von Ems, leading the Imperial contingent sent to aid Gaston de Foix to retake Brescia.\n\nAfter a short visit to Germany, he returned to the Italian peninsula, where he gained fresh laurels by his enterprises against the Venetians and the French. He was heading the Landsknechts at the side of the Spanish commander Fernando d'Avalos at the 1513 Battle of La Motta, routing the vastly outnumbering Venetian troops according to Frundsberg's motto \"Viel Feind', viel Ehr' \" (\"Many foes, much honor\"). Peace being made, he returned to Germany, and at the head of the infantry of the Swabian League assisted in driving Ulrich, Duke of Württemberg, from his duchy in 1519.\n\nAt the Diet of Worms in 1521, he allegedly spoke words of encouragement to the \"little monk\" Martin Luther, and during the Italian War of 1521–26, Frundsberg helped lead the Imperial Army into Picardy. When King Francis I of France appeared on the battlefield with a force of approximately 40,000 men, the clever withdrawal of Emperor Charles V's army saved its existence. Frundsberg considered the withdrawal on Valenciennes as \"the greatest luck and most appropriate measure during war.\"\n\nAfter the French campaign in 1522 ended and Frundsberg resigned from the leadership of the Landesknechts, he returned to lead the march of 6,000 men on upper Italy. A difficult alpine crossing through deep snow led to the Battle of Bicocca near Milan in April. Swiss nationals on foot fought alongside Frundsberg, who led and fought from the front. The emperor's victory at Bicocca allowed the return of the previous rulers of the oligarchic Republic of Genoa and the Duchy of Milan and brought the greater part of Lombardy under the influence of Charles V.\n\nIn 1525, after a brief stop in Mindelheim as the \"Highest Field Captain\" of the entire German Nation (with a force consisting of 12,000 men and twenty-nine flag bearers), Frundsberg moved again towards upper Italy to relieve Pavia and to save the Empire's Duchy of Milan. Despite an additional 6,000 men, of whom some were Spanish, in battle against an enemy that was strongest, Frundsberg won his most famous victory at Pavia, with the capture of the French king.\n\nOnly one year later, when the war in Italy was renewed in 1526, Frundsberg received a call for help from the Emperor's Army in Lombardy, to help decide the war. Albeit an insufficient amount, he obtained 36,000 German Thaler to organize the new army. During his occupation of Mindelheim, Frundsberg borrowed money and sold off his silver table settings and his wife's jewelry, in order to acquire the remaining funds to raise the army. In less than three weeks, Frundsberg organized over 12,000 men and crossed the Alps during the middle of November. He joined the Constable de Bourbon near Piacenza and marched towards Rome. However, order and discipline broke down near Modena on 13 March 1527, when no decisive battle developed after months of campaigning in Italy. Payment for the mercenaries remained overdue and, in the end, even Frundsberg was unable to rally the Landsknechts and restore order. The matter shook the old commander to such an extent that he suffered a stroke. Unable to regain his physical strength, Frundsberg was moved to Germany after a long struggle in Italian hospitals. Tormented by great anxiety over the situation with his mercenaries or \"beloved sons\", the loss of his personal estate and death of one of his sons, Frundsberg died in his castle in Mindelheim.\n\nThough there is no evidence that he ever left the Catholic Church, and in spite of his constant loyalty to the Catholic Emperor, Frundsberg was quite receptive to the message of Martin Luther and according to some stories, before the campaign of 1527, he motivated his troops (mainly Lutherans) by promising to hang the pope with a golden rope.\n\nFrundsberg was considered a capable and chivalrous soldier, and a devoted servant of the Habsburgs. A son had been killed in Italy in 1524 just before the battle of Pavia. Another son Caspar (1500–1536) and his grandson Georg (died 1586) were both soldiers of some distinction. With the latter's death, the family became extinct.\n\nIn 1841 a bust by Max von Widnmann was added to the Walhalla memorial. Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria had a statue erected in his honour at the Hall of Generals (\"Feldherrenhalle\") of the Vienna Museum of Military History, inaugurated in 1866, and the Austro-Hungarian corvette SMS Frundsberg launched in 1873 was named after him. During World War II, the \"Waffen-SS\" 10th Panzer Division by order of 3 October 1943 was given the honorific title \"Frundsberg\".\n\nGeorg von Frundsberg is a character in the historical novel The Adventurer, AKA Michael The Finn (Mikael Karvajalka) by Mika Waltari.\n\n"}

In South Africa, where the wheel arrangement was first used, the type was known as a Reid Tenwheeler. In the United States of America it was known as a Southern Pacific on the Southern Pacific Railroad and as an Overland on the Union Pacific Railroad.\n\nThis wheel arrangement was first used on the Natal Government Railways (NGR) in the Colony of Natal in 1899, on a tank locomotive that was designed to meet the requirement for a locomotive that could haul at least one and a half times as much as an NGR Dübs A 4-8-2T locomotive.\n\nIn the United States, a simple expansion (simplex) version of the type was used only on the Southern Pacific and Union Pacific Railroads. Baldwin Locomotive Works built an experimental compound expansion in 1926, but since the weight and length of this engine was too much for all but the heaviest and straightest track and compound steam locomotives had already lost favor on United States railroads, its demonstration runs failed to generate interest and no more were produced.\n\nBrazil had 4-10-2 tender locomotives, built by Henschel in 1936. These were converted to gauge in 1940.\n\nBetween 1899 and 1903, the Natal Government Railways (NGR) placed 101 tank locomotives in service. The locomotive was designed by G.W. Reid, the Locomotive Superintendent of the NGR at the end of the nineteenth century, and built in Scotland by Dübs and Company and the newly established North British Locomotive Company. On the NGR, the locomotive type became known as the Reid Tenwheeler and was officially designated Class C.\n\nThe locomotive used saturated steam and was equipped with Allan straight link valve gear. The trailing Bissel truck was of the Cartazzi type that allowed the axle some lateral movement. In order to negotiate sharp curves, both the first and fifth sets of coupled wheels were flangeless, but since the blind trailing coupled wheels had a tendency to derail while reversing, particularly over points, their tyre width was later increased from to . In 1912, after the establishment of the South African Railways, the surviving unmodified NGR locomotives were designated Class H.\nIn 1901 and 1902, towards the end of the Second Boer War, the Imperial Military Railways also acquired 35 Reid Tenwheeler locomotives from Dübs and Company and Neilson, Reid and Company. After the war, they came onto the roster of the Central South African Railways (CSAR), who designated them Class E. In 1903, the CSAR modified six of them to locomotives and, beginning in 1905, the remainder to tank-and-tender locomotives.\n\nA final order for one new Reid Tenwheeler was placed by Witbank Collieries as late as 1927. The total of 137 locomotives built to this design was about double the number of all other locomotives in use elsewhere in the world, all of which were tender locomotives that served in the United States and Brazil.\n\nIn the United States, the type was used only on the Southern Pacific Railroad (SP), which called it the Southern Pacific, and the Union Pacific Railroad (UP), which called it the Overland after their corporate sobriquet, \"The Overland Route\". Only sixty locomotives of this wheel arrangement were built for domestic service and all but one were constructed as simplex three-cylinder engines.\n\nIn 1925, the SP placed an order for sixteen locomotives with the American Locomotive Company (ALCO) and, later in the same year, the UP ordered one. The first SP locomotive, no. 5000, was completed in April 1925, while the UP locomotive, no. 8000, was completed the following month. Within a few months, the SP ordered more of these engines and built up a fleet of 49. The UP, on the other hand, waited thirteen months before repeating orders and establishing a fleet of ten locomotives. All 59 were simplex locomotives and were built by ALCO.\nIn 1926, Baldwin Locomotive Works constructed an experimental demonstrator, the Baldwin 60000, which was a three-cylinder compound locomotive, the only so constructed. This engine used high-pressure steam in the inside cylinder and then exhausted that steam into the two low-pressure outside cylinders. It also had a water tube boiler, one of a very few locomotives so equipped in the United States. As technologically innovative as Baldwin's was, however, it was outmoded when built since compound steam locomotives had already lost favor in United States railroading.\n\nIt was found that the type ran better and rode smoother than the type from which it had evolved. The third cylinder in the center of the cylinder saddle sloped down at a 9½ degree angle to a crank on the second drivers' axle, while the two outside rods connected to the third drivers. The three-cylinder feature on these locomotives gave them a distinctive sound at work, described as a \"hop, skip and jump rhythm\".\n\nWhile the SP engines could operate only on relatively straight and heavily built mainlines, their long service lives of between 28 and 30 years proved that they were good locomotives. The most serious mishap was when, in November 1946, one of the SP locomotives suffered a boiler explosion which killed four train crew. In addition, the inside cylinder's rod created serious maintenance problems because the floating bushings could fail, which lengthen maintenance down-time since such failures required major valve re-settings that caused delays. It was reported that such failures created such great pounding on the rails that railroad housewives along the line \"complained of crockery cracking when a defective rumbled past their homes\".\n\nWhen the UP became tired of the major mechanical problems associated with three cylinders, it converted its locomotives to two-cylinder locomotives in 1942 and renumbered them 5090 to 5099.\n\nTwo locomotives of this type have been preserved:\n"}

The class was owned by the Canadian Pacific Railway and served on the Big Hill in British Columbia, which had a 4.1% grade. Five locomotives were built between 1909 and 1911. A sixth one was built, but it was a simple expansion Mallet with two sets of high-pressure cylinders. All the locomotives in this class were later converted to types and were used as shunting and transfer engines in Montreal.\n\nThe Saxon Class XV HTV was a class of goods train tank steam locomotive operated by the Royal Saxon State Railways, which had been conceived for hauling trains and acting as banking engines for routes in the Ore Mountains. The two CCh4v locomotives were built in 1916 at the Sächsischen Maschinenfabrik, formerly Hartmann. In 1925, the Deutsche Reichsbahn grouped them into their DRG Class 79.0. The locomotive was of unusual design with two fixed six-coupled engine units with a central double cylinder on each side, each with a high-pressure cylinder for the rear and a low-pressure cylinder for the front drive.\n\nThe first Mallet locomotive in North America was built in the United States and was of this type, the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Class O no. 2400.

The Shishou City National Baiji Reserve for Chinese river dolphins is nearby. It shares its name with a stream flowing into the Yangtze River. In addition, the area enjoys convenient transportation, with an hour's drive from Yueyang East Railway Station on the Beijing-Guangzhou high-speed railway line (90 kilometers of expressway), and 70 kilometers from Jingzhou Railway Station on the Shanghai-Wuhan-Chengdu high-speed railway line. Moreover, Shishou boasts a diversified landscape, including mountains, hills, lakes, rivers, terraces and plains, as well as abundant resources such as rice, cotton, oil plants, eggs, fish, and lotus roots.\n\nShishou is in a subtropical monsoon climate zone with an abundant amount of light and heat energy and a long frost-free period. The city receives 1800–2000 hours of sunshine annually, with an annual average temperature of 15.9-16.6 ℃, 10 ℃ or higher accumulated temperature annually, an annual frost-free period of 242–263 days, and an average annual precipitation between 1100mm and 1300 mm. The climatic resources are sufficient for a large variety of crops to grow.

Fearing a cover-up, Tu's family refused to accept that his death was a suicide, and guarded his body while awaiting investigation. When police tried to forcefully remove Tu's body, local residents joined Tu's family, blocking the hotel entrance from the police. On June 19 a large number of local residents guarded the hotel, fighting with the police, including armed police. Confrontations between the police and residents continued outside the hotel, and on June 20, the municipal government began cutting internet connections in Shishou.

{"id": "1880909", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1880909", "title": "Lingual lipase", "text": "Lingual lipase\n\nLingual lipase is a member of a family of digestive enzymes called triacylglycerol lipases, EC 3.1.1.3, that use the catalytic triad of aspartate, histidine, and serine to hydrolyze medium and long-chain triglycerides into partial glycerides and free fatty acids. The enzyme, released into the mouth along with the saliva, catalyzes the first reaction in the digestion of dietary lipid, with diglycerides being the primary reaction product. However, due to the unique characteristics of lingual lipase, including a pH optimum 4.5–5.4 and its ability to catalyze reactions without bile salts, the lipolytic activity continues through to the stomach. Enzyme release is signaled by autonomic nervous system after ingestion, at which time the serous glands under the circumvallate and foliate lingual papillae on the surface of the tongue secrete lingual lipase to the grooves of the circumvallate and foliate papillae, co-localized with fat taste receptors. The hydrolysis of the dietary fats is essential for fat absorption by the small intestine, as long chain triacylglycerides cannot be absorbed, and as much as 30% of fat is hydrolyzed within 1 to 20 minutes of ingestion by lingual lipase alone.\n\nLingual lipase, together with gastric lipase, comprise the two acidic lipases.\n\nLingual lipase uses a catalytic triad consisting of aspartic acid-203 (Asp), histidine-257 (His), and serine-144 (Ser), to initiate the hydrolysis of a triglyceride into a diacylglyceride and a free fatty acid. First, there is a series of deprotonations that make the serine a better nucleophile. The lone pair on the oxygen of the serine then undergoes a nucleophilic addition to either the first or the third carbonyl of the triacylglycerol. Next, the electrons that had moved to form the carbonyl transfer back down to reform the carbonyl. Then the diacylglycerol leaving group is protonated by His-257. Following another round of deprotonations, the lone pair on the oxygen of water undergoes a nucleophilic addition to the carbonyl that reformed in the previous step. The electrons that had moved up from the carbonyl come back down to reform it and kick off the Ser, which again induces the chain of deprotonation. The final products of the reaction are the conserved catalytic triad, a diacylglycerol and a free fatty acid. Monoacylglyceride is also present in a lower concentration and is produced following a second round of hydrolysis by the same mechanism. It acts on tryglicerides to help breakdown food as a part of saliva composition.\n\nPatients with cystic fibrosis (CF) have an 85% chance of additionally experiencing the effects of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. In the most extreme cases, these patients will produce no pancreatic lipase, yet even when the enzyme is completely absent, dietary fat is still absorbed. Studies have shown that even in these cases, lingual lipase is present in normal amounts, and contributes to greater than 90% of total lipase activity in duodenum. This can be attributed to the fact that lingual lipase has a low pH optimum and can thus remain active through the stomach into the duodenum, where there is a low pH in patients with CF. It has, thus, been proposed that a possible treatment option for exocrine pancreatic insufficiency would be enzyme replacement therapy using lingual lipase, increasing the amount of dietary fat absorption and decreasing the risk of malnutrition. The proposed mechanism of lingual lipase preferentially cleaving short and medium chain triacylglycerols provides a means for absorption without the need for micelle formation and chylomicrons. Short and medium chain free fatty acids can be absorbed directly through the mucosal cells into the blood stream without further packaging and hence play a crucial role in nutrition for CF patients (and neonates).\n\nIn the uterus, the fetus is dependent on a high-carbohydrate diet, and lingual as well as gastric lipases are present in the fetus from 26 weeks of gestation on. After birth, fat in mother's milk or a milk substitute becomes the major source of nutrition. Absorptive rates of dietary fat are much lower in neonates than in adults, 65–80% as compared to >95% respectively, which can be attributed to low pancreatic lipase activity. Furthermore, milk fat is not a good substrate for pancreatic lipase. This fact, in combination with the bile salt deficiency and low pH throughout the gastrointestinal tract of the neonate, demands that lingual lipase be the main enzyme catalyzing the hydrolysis of dietary fat. This enzyme activity has been seen as early as 26 weeks gestational age, with ability to hydrolyze dietary fats variable according to digestive tract maturity.\n"}

The most common gauge for such railways is , representing gauge prototypes.

The next most common gauge is , which represents the theoretical non-existent gauge . This gauge is commonly used to portray prototypes between and gauge.\n\nThere are a number of commercial manufacturers of 16 mm scale models as well as many enthusiastic amateurs who build their own rolling stock. Because real railways were most commonly found in the UK, many of the models are of British prototypes. European and North American narrow gauge railways are also modeled in this scale, mainly with scratch-built or kit-built models.\n\nAlthough models of approximately this scale were being built as early as the 1930s, it was the founding of the Merioneth Railway Society just after the Second World War that marks the popularization of this scale.

However the realistic sound, smell and visual effects of steam-driven locomotives makes up for loss of fidelity elsewhere. Driving a live steam locomotive, even at this small scale is very different from driving an electrically powered model.\n\nFor many years there were no commercially available parts, and everything was hand-built or kit-bashed from O scale components. In the early 1970s Archangel emerged as the first commercial manufacturer on a large scale, followed by Merlin and Beck at the end of that decade. All three companies produced affordable live steam locomotives in this scale. In 1981 Mamod entered the market with a cheap if somewhat crude steam loco for the UK market. Although not perfect, the low cost opened the hobby to a much wider range of people and as a result demand for other products grew. Today, Roundhouse almost dominate the market as builders of high quality live steam locomotives. A vibrant group of professional and hobbyist makers have emerged to meet this demand.\n\n\n\n"}

It lacks an AI opponent, although a single player can play to achieve a high score and ignore the other island. When starting the game, the players may choose how many rounds to play (up to 50) and the length of each round (30 to 120 seconds). The winner is the player with the most points at the end of the game.\n\nEach player rules their own island and uses the controller disc to move a rectangular cursor around the screen. Both players spend gold bars to construct different buildings (houses, schools, factories, hospitals and forts) on their islands, build fishing boats or PT boats, or to fund rebel activity on the enemy island. As each island's population grows, the ruler is responsible for housing their people, feeding their populace and keeping them happy, or else risk rebel activity, which decreases the player's score and sometimes destroys buildings. Income is generated when randomly generated rain clouds, (and sometimes hurricanes) pass over a player's farms, when a fishing boat is positioned over a school of fish, and at the end of each turn, based on the player's factory output and fishing boats.\n\nMost rounds consist of constructing a building, then continuously maneuvering the player's fishing boat over a moving school of fish in order to maintain fishing income, with occasional interruptions to construct new buildings whenever the player is able to afford them. Alternatively, the player in the lead might spend considerable time maneuvering a PT boat to try and sink the losing player's fishing boat in order to keep their income down. Game algorithms generate and determine the course of rain clouds, tropical storms, hurricanes, schools of fish, and pirate ships.\n\nGameSpy included \"Utopia\" in its Hall of Fame in 2004, commenting: \"Considering the state of home video-game technology in 1981, \"Utopia\" is an astonishingly detailed simulation.\" GameSpot featured \"Utopia\" in its series Unsung Heroes: Ground Breaking Games, calling it a \"surprisingly complex game (often referred to as 'Civilization 0.5') [that] laid the foundation for PC sim classics such as \"Civilization\" and \"SimCity\".\" In 2012, \"Utopia\" has been included in the Smithsonian Institution's \"The Art of Video Games\" exhibition.\n\n\"Utopia\" was a turn-based strategy game with some real-time elements.

Mandatory redistributions take place in the middle of each term in order to respond to changing demographics. The boundaries of each division attempts to match a quota of the average divisional enrolment as closely as possible. Redistributions are organised by the independent Northern Territory Electoral Commission.\n\nAs of 11 February 2015, the quota of electors was 5,107. At the general election in August 2016, the quota was 5,420. Northern Territory divisions are the smallest such electorates in Australia, due to the Territory's small population.\n\nWith so few constituents, an MLA can easily get to know all of the enrolled voters in his or her electorate.

It is the first Kiss full studio album since 1981's \"Music from \"The Elder\"\" to feature lead vocals from someone other than Paul Stanley or Gene Simmons, with drummer Eric Carr singing lead on \"Little Caesar\". It is also the final Kiss album to feature Carr in its entirety before his death in November 1991. Just like its predecessor album, \"Crazy Nights\", \"Hot in the Shade\" also features keyboards and synthesizers.\n\n\"Hot in the Shade\" contains the most songs of any Kiss studio album with 15. The album is one of the band's longest, with a running time of nearly an hour (58:39). Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley appeared in Kiss make-up for the first time since their 1983 unmasking for the video for \"Rise to It\". Although the scene with Simmons and Stanley in make-up took place in 1975, the costumes they used were historically inaccurate; Simmons' was from the \"Unmasked\" (1980) era while Stanley's was from \"Love Gun\" (1977). The album showcases a more straight ahead hard rock sound after the keyboard-centered pop metal in \"Crazy Nights\" and even flirts with speed metal in \"Boomerang\". \"Little Caesar\" was Eric Carr's first lead vocal on an original song, although he had previously sung lead on a re-recorded version of \"Beth\" on the compilation album \"Smashes, Thrashes & Hits\".\n\nThe album was recorded during the summer of 1989 at The Fortress in Hollywood. Aiming for a more stripped down sound, Gene Simmons and Eric Carr reportedly decided to record the album there after checking out several different studios. To further give the album a more raw feel, along with being able to produce the album with a lower budget, the band elected to use the demos they recorded and polish them up via overdubs instead of re-recording the song over again. Some portions of \"Hot in the Shade\", such as \"Love's A Slap In The Face\" were recorded using a drum machine to further reduce recording costs. For the parts that Eric Carr and Kevin Valentine played drums on, electronic drum pads that triggered samples were used rather than a true drum kit, as The Fortress did not have one on hand.\n\nTommy Thayer, who co-wrote \"Betrayed\" and \"The Street Giveth And The Street Taketh Away\", became Kiss' permanent lead guitarist in 2002, replacing Ace Frehley as \"The Spaceman\". Of the 15 tracks on the album, only five were performed live. \"Forever\", co-written by Michael Bolton, was a pop hit and became a semi-regular part of the live setlist. \"Hide Your Heart\" was played in 2014 on The KISS 40th Anniversary World Tour\n\nThree music videos were made for the promotion of this album. The first was \"Hide Your Heart\" directed by Marty Callner for Cream Cheese Productions, the second one shot was \"Rise to It\" directed by Mark Rezyka for Mark Freedman Productions shot a few days before Thanksgiving, November 1989 and the third \"Forever\" also directed by Mark Rezyka for Mark Freedman Productions shot on December 16, 1989 in a building in downtown Los Angeles. Both videos were held to be released in January and April 1990 to MTV. Even though \"Rise to It\" was shot and edited before \"Forever\", \"Forever\" was release as the second music video from the album to take advantage of the radio airplay the ballad was receiving. The \"Forever\" music video also reached #1 on Dial MTV and reached #47 on MTVs top 100 videos for 1990. The \"Rise to It\" music video featured Paul Stanley and Gene Simmons in their past KISS makeup and variation of costumes. A long-form video was scheduled to be shot and edited together with behind the scenes footage shot on video during sound checks, rehearsals and first show for the tour in Galveston, Texas. The long-form video was rumored to be titled \"KISS Exposed Part II\" also to be directed by Mark Rezyka with a full concert to be filmed on 35mm film in Long Beach California on September 9, 1990 but was cancelled by the record label just a little more than a week before.\n\n\"Hot in the Shade\" was certified Gold on December 20, 1989 by the RIAA.\n\nIts most successful single, \"Forever\", reached #8 on the Billboard charts, the band's highest charting single in the US since \"Beth\", 13 years earlier.\n\nKiss\n\n\n\n"}

He is best known for the Academy Award-winning fantasy films \"Pan's Labyrinth\" (2006) and \"The Shape of Water\" (2017), winning the Oscars for Best Director and Best Picture for the latter.\n\nThroughout his career, del Toro has shifted between personal, lower-budget Spanish language films, such as \"Cronos\" (1993) and \"The Devil's Backbone\" (2001), and Hollywood tentpoles, including \"Mimic\" (1997), \"Blade II\" (2002), \"Hellboy\" (2004) and its sequel \"\" (2008), \"Pacific Rim\" (2013), and \"Crimson Peak\" (2015). As a producer, del Toro worked on the films \"The Orphanage\" (2007), \"Don't Be Afraid of the Dark\" (2010), \"The Hobbit\" film series (2012–14), \"Mama\" (2013), \"The Book of Life\" (2014), \"\" (2018), and \"Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark\" (2019).\n\nWith Chuck Hogan, he co-authored \"The Strain\" trilogy of novels (2009–2011), later adapted into a comic-book series (2011–15) and a live-action television series (2014–17). With DreamWorks Animation, he created the Netflix animated series \"\" (2016–18) and \"\" (2018–19), the first two installments of the \"Tales of Arcadia\" trilogy, based on the 2015 novel he co-wrote with Daniel Kraus. Working with DreamWorks, he also executive produced \"Puss in Boots\" (2011), \"Kung Fu Panda 2 \" (2011), \"Rise of the Guardians\" (2012), and \"Kung Fu Panda 3\" (2016).\n\nDel Toro's work has been characterized by a strong connection to fairy tales and horror, with an effort to infuse visual or poetic beauty in the grotesque. He has had a lifelong fascination with monsters, which he considers symbols of great power. He is also known for his use of insectile and religious imagery, the themes of Catholicism and celebrating imperfection, underworld and clockwork motifs, practical special effects, dominant amber lighting and his frequent collaborations with actors Ron Perlman and Doug Jones. He is good friends with fellow Mexican filmmakers Alfonso Cuarón and Alejandro G. Iñárritu, and they are collectively known as \"The Three Amigos of Cinema\".\n\nDel Toro was born in Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico, the son of Guadalupe Gómez and Federico del Toro Torres, an automotive entrepreneur. He was raised in a strict Catholic household. Del Toro studied at the Centro de Investigación y Estudios Cinematográficos, at the University of Guadalajara.\n\nWhen del Toro was about eight years old, he began experimenting with his father's Super 8 camera, making short films with \"Planet of the Apes\" toys and other objects. One short focused on a \"serial killer potato\" with ambitions of world domination; it murdered del Toro's mother and brothers before stepping outside and being crushed by a car. Del Toro made about 10 short films before his first feature, including one titled \"Matilde\", but only the last two, \"Doña Lupe\" and \"Geometria\", have been made available. He wrote four episodes and directed five episodes of the cult series \"La Hora Marcada\", along with other Mexican filmmakers such as Emmanuel Lubezki and Alfonso Cuarón.\n\nDel Toro studied special effects and make-up with special-effects artist Dick Smith. He spent 10 years as a special-effects make-up designer and formed his own company, Necropia. He also co-founded the Guadalajara International Film Festival. Later in his directing career, he formed his own production company, the Tequila Gang.\n\nIn 1997, at the age of 33, Guillermo was given a $30 million budget from Miramax Films to shoot another film, \"Mimic\". He was ultimately unhappy with the way Miramax had treated him during production, which led to his friend James Cameron almost coming to blows with Miramax co-founder and owner Harvey Weinstein during the 70th Academy Awards.\n\nDel Toro has directed a wide variety of films, from comic book adaptations (\"Blade II\", \"Hellboy\") to historical fantasy and horror films, two of which are set in Spain in the context of the Spanish Civil War under the authoritarian rule of Francisco Franco. These two films, \"The Devil's Backbone\" and \"Pan's Labyrinth\", are among his most critically acclaimed works. They share similar settings, protagonists and themes with the 1973 Spanish film \"The Spirit of the Beehive\", widely considered to be the finest Spanish film of the 1970s.\n\nDel Toro views the horror genre as inherently political, explaining, \"Much like fairy tales, there are two facets of horror. One is pro-institution, which is the most reprehensible type of fairy tale: Don't wander into the woods, and always obey your parents. The other type of fairy tale is completely anarchic and antiestablishment.\"\n\nHe is close friends with two other prominent and critically praised Mexican filmmakers Alfonso Cuarón and Alejandro González Iñárritu. The three often influence each other's directorial decisions, and have been interviewed together by Charlie Rose. Cuarón was one of the producers of \"Pan's Labyrinth\", while Iñárritu assisted in editing the film. The three filmmakers, referred to as the \"Three Amigos\" founded the production company Cha Cha Cha Films, whose first release was 2008's \"Rudo y Cursi\".\n\nDel Toro has also contributed to the web series \"Trailers from Hell\".\n\nIn April 2008, del Toro was hired by Peter Jackson to direct the live-action film adaptation of J. R. R. Tolkien's \"The Hobbit\". On May 30, 2010, del Toro left the project due to extended delays brought on by MGM's financial troubles. Although he did not direct the films, he is credited as co-writer in \"\", \"\" and \"\".\n\nOn December 1, 2008, del Toro expressed interest in a stop-motion remake to Roald Dahl's novel \"The Witches\", collaborating with Alfonso Cuarón. On June 19, 2018 it was announced that Del Toro and Cuarón would instead be attached as Executive Producers on the remake with Robert Zemeckis helming the project as Director and Screenwriter.\n\nOn June 2, 2009, del Toro's first novel, \"The Strain\", was released. It is the first part of an apocalyptic vampire trilogy co-authored by del Toro and Chuck Hogan. The second volume, \"The Fall\", was released on September 21, 2010. The final installment, \"The Night Eternal\", followed in October 2011. Del Toro cites writings of Antoine Augustin Calmet, Montague Summers and Bernhardt J. Hurwood among his favourites in the non-literary form about vampires.\n\nOn December 9, 2010, del Toro launched Mirada Studios with his long-time cinematographer Guillermo Navarro, director Mathew Cullen and executive producer Javier Jimenez. Mirada was formed in Los Angeles, California to be a collaborative space where they and other filmmakers can work with Mirada's artists to create and produce projects that span digital production and content for film, television, advertising, interactive and other media. Mirada launched as a sister company to production company Motion Theory.\n\nDel Toro directed \"Pacific Rim\", a science fiction film based on a screenplay by del Toro and Travis Beacham. In the film, giant monsters rise from the Pacific Ocean and attack major cities, leading humans to retaliate with gigantic mecha suits called \"Jaegers\". Del Toro commented, \"This is my most un-modest film, this has everything. The scale is enormous and I'm just a big kid having fun.\" The film was released on July 12, 2013 and grossed $411 million at the box office.\n\nDel Toro directed \"Night Zero\", the pilot episode of \"The Strain\", a vampire horror television series based on the novel trilogy of the same name by del Toro and Chuck Hogan. FX has commissioned the pilot episode, which del Toro scripted with Hogan and was filmed in Toronto in September 2013. FX ordered a thirteen-episode first season for the series on November 19, 2013, and series premiered on July 13, 2014.\n\nAfter \"The Strain\"s pilot episode, del Toro directed \"Crimson Peak\", a gothic horror film he co-wrote with Matthew Robbins and Lucinda Cox. Del Toro has described the film as \"a very set-oriented, classical but at the same time modern take on the ghost story\", citing \"The Omen\", \"The Exorcist\" and \"The Shining\" as influences. Del Toro also stated, \"I think people are getting used to horror subjects done as found footage or B-value budgets. I wanted this to feel like a throwback.\" Jessica Chastain, Tom Hiddleston, Mia Wasikowska, and Charlie Hunnam starred in the film. Production began February 2014 in Toronto, with an April 2015 release date initially planned. The studio later pushed the date back to October 2015, to coincide with the Halloween season.\nHe was selected to be on the jury for the main competition section of the 2015 Cannes Film Festival.\n\nDel Toro directed the Cold War drama film \"The Shape of Water\", starring Sally Hawkins, Octavia Spencer, and Michael Shannon.\n\nFilming began on August 15, 2016 in Toronto, and wrapped twelve weeks later.\n\nOn August 31, 2017, the movie premiered in the main competition section of the 74th Venice International Film Festival, where it was awarded the Golden Lion for best film, making Del Toro the first Mexican director to win the award. The film became a critical and commercial success and would go on to win multiple accolades, including the Academy Award for Best Picture, with del Toro winning the Academy Award for Best Director.\n\nDel Toro collaborated with Japanese video game designer Hideo Kojima to produce \"P.T.\", a video game intended to be a \"playable trailer\" for the ninth \"Silent Hill\" game, which was cancelled. The demo was also removed from the PlayStation Network.\n\nAt the D23 Expo in 2009, his Double Dare You production company and Disney announced a production deal for a line of darker animated films. The label was announced with one original animated project, \"\". However, del Toro moved his deal to DreamWorks in late 2010. From 2016 to 2018, \"Trollhunters\" was released to great acclaim on Netflix and \"is tracking to be its most-watched kids original ever\".\n\nIn 2017, Del Toro had an exhibition of work at the Minneapolis Institute of Art titled \"Guillermo del Toro: At Home with Monsters\", featuring his collection of paintings, drawings, maquettes, artifacts, and concept film art. The exhibition ran from March 5, 2017, to May 28, 2017.\n\nIn 2019, del Toro appeared in Hideo Kojima's video game \"Death Stranding\", providing his likeness for the character Deadman.\n\nIn 2008, del Toro announced \"Pinocchio\", a dark stop-motion film based on the Italian novel \"The Adventures of Pinocchio\", co-directed by Adam Parrish King, with The Jim Henson Company as production company, and music by Nick Cave. The project had been in development for over a decade. The pre-production was begun by the studio ShadowMachine. In 2017, del Toro announced that Patrick McHale is co-writing the script of the movie. In the same year, del Toro revealed at the 74th Venice International Film Festival that the film will be reimagined during the rise of Benito Mussolini, and that he would need $35 million to make it. On November 2017, it was reported that del Toro had cancelled the project because no studios were willing to finance it. In October 2018, it was announced that the film had been revived, with Netflix backing the project. Netflix had previously collaborated with del Toro on \"Trollhunters\". Many of the same details of the project remain the same, but with Mark Gustafson now co-directing rather than Adam Parrish King.\n\nIn December 2017, Searchlight Pictures announced that del Toro would direct a new adaptation of the 1946 novel \"Nightmare Alley\" by William Lindsay Gresham, the screenplay of which he co-wrote with Kim Morgan. In 2019, it was reported that Bradley Cooper, Cate Blanchett, Toni Collette and Rooney Mara had closed deals to star in the film, which went into production in January 2020.\n\nHe was married to Lorenza Newton, cousin of Mexican singer Guadalupe Pineda. They have two children. He started dating Lorenza when both were studying at the Instituto de Ciencias in Guadalajara. Del Toro and Newton separated in early 2017, and divorced in September of the same year. He maintains residences in Toronto and Los Angeles, and returns to Guadalajara every six weeks to visit his family. \nHe also owns two houses devoted exclusively to his collection of books, poster artwork and other belongings pertaining to his work. He explains, \"As a kid, I dreamed of having a house with secret passages and a room where it rained 24 hours a day. The point of being over 40 is to fulfill the desires you've been harboring since you were 7.\"\n\nIn a 2007 interview, del Toro described his political position as \"a little too liberal\". He pointed out that the villains in most of his films, such as the industrialist in \"Cronos\", the Nazis in \"Hellboy\", and the Francoists in \"Pan's Labyrinth\", are united by the common attribute of authoritarianism. \"I hate structure. I'm completely anti-structural in terms of believing in institutions. I hate them. I hate any institutionalised social, religious, or economic holding.\"\n\nDel Toro was raised Roman Catholic. In a 2009 interview with Charlie Rose, he described his upbringing as excessively \"morbid,\" saying, \"I mercifully lapsed as a Catholic ... but as Buñuel used to say, 'I'm an atheist, thank God.'\" Though insisting that he is spiritually \"not with Buñuel\" and that \"once a Catholic, always a Catholic, in a way.\" He concluded, \"I believe in Man. I believe in mankind, as the worst and the best that has happened to this world.\" He has also responded to the observation that he views his art as his religion by saying, \"It is. To me, art and storytelling serve primal, spiritual functions in my daily life. Whether I'm telling a bedtime story to my kids or trying to mount a movie or write a short story or a novel, I take it very seriously.\" Nevertheless, he became a \"raging atheist\" after seeing a pile of human fetuses while volunteering at a Mexican hospital. He has claimed to be horrified by the way the Catholic Church complied with Francoist Spain, down to having a character in his film quote what actual priests would say to Republican faction members in concentration camps. Upon discovering the religious beliefs of C.S. Lewis, Del Toro has stated that he no longer feels comfortable enjoying his work, despite doing so beforehand. He describes Lewis as \"too Catholic\" for him, despite the fact that Lewis was never a Catholic.\n\nHowever, Del Toro isn't entirely disparaging of Catholicism, and his background continues to influence his work. While discussing \"The Shape of Water\", Del Toro discussed the Catholic influence on the film, stating, \"A very Catholic notion is the humble force, or the force of humility, that gets revealed as a god-like figure toward the end. It's also used in fairy tales. In fairy tales, in fact, there is an entire strand of tales that would be encompassed by the title 'The Magical Fish.' And [it's] not exactly a secret that a fish is a Christian symbol.\" In the same interview, he still maintained that he does not believe in an afterlife, stating \"I don't think there is life beyond death, I don't. But I do believe that we get this clarity in the last minute of our life. The titles we achieved, the honors we managed, they all vanish. You are left alone with you and your deeds and the things you didn't do. And that moment of clarity gives you either peace or the most tremendous fear, because you finally have no cover, and you finally realize exactly who you are.\" \n\nIn 2010, del Toro revealed that he was a fan of video games, describing them as \"the comic books of our time\" and \"a medium that gains no respect among the intelligentsia\". He has stated that he considers \"Ico\" and \"Shadow of the Colossus\" to be masterpieces.\n\nHe has cited \"Gadget Invention, Travel, & Adventure\", \"Cosmology of Kyoto\", \"Asteroids\" and \"Galaga\" as his favorite games.\n\nDel Toro's favorite film monsters are Frankenstein's monster, the Alien, Gill-man, Godzilla, and the Thing. Frankenstein in particular has a special meaning for him, in both film and literature, as he claims he has a \"Frankenstein fetish to a degree that is unhealthy\", and that it's \"the most important book of my life, so you know if I get to it, whenever I get to it, it will be the right way\". He has \"Brazil\", \"Nosferatu\", \"Freaks\" and \"Bram Stoker's Dracula\" listed among his favourite movies.\n\nDel Toro is also highly interested in Victorian culture. He said: \"I have a room of my library at home called 'The Dickens room'. It has every work by Charles Dickens, Wilkie Collins and many other Victorian novelists, plus hundreds of works about Victorian London and its customs, etiquette, architecture. I'm a Jack the Ripper aficionado, too. My museum-slash-home has a huge amount of Ripperology in it\".\n\nAround 1997, del Toro's father, Federico del Toro Torres, was kidnapped in Guadalajara. Del Toro's family had to pay twice the amount originally asked for as a ransom; immediately after learning of the kidnapping, fellow filmmaker James Cameron, a friend of Del Toro since they met during the production of 1993's \"Cronos\", withdrew over $1 million in cash from his bank account and gave it to Del Toro to help pay the ransom. After the ransom was paid, Federico was released, having spent 72 days kidnapped; the culprits were never apprehended, and the money of both Cameron and Del Toro's family was never recovered. The event prompted del Toro, his parents, and his siblings to move abroad. In a 2008 interview with \"Time\" magazine, he said this about the kidnapping of his father: \"Every day, every week, something happens that reminds me that I am in involuntary exile [from my country].\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1880953", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1880953", "title": "Asynchronous I/O", "text": "Asynchronous I/O\n\nIn computer science, asynchronous I/O (also non-sequential I/O) is a form of input/output processing that permits other processing to continue before the transmission has finished.\n\nInput and output (I/O) operations on a computer can be extremely slow compared to the processing of data. An I/O device can incorporate mechanical devices that must physically move, such as a hard drive seeking a track to read or write; this is often orders of magnitude slower than the switching of electric current. For example, during a disk operation that takes ten milliseconds to perform, a processor that is clocked at one gigahertz could have performed ten million instruction-processing cycles.\n\nA simple approach to I/O would be to start the access and then wait for it to complete. But such an approach (called synchronous I/O, or blocking I/O) would block the progress of a program while the communication is in progress, leaving system resources idle. When a program makes many I/O operations (such as a program mainly or largely dependent on user input), this means that the processor can spend almost all of its time idle waiting for I/O operations to complete.\n\nAlternatively, it is possible to start the communication and then perform processing that does not require that the I/O be completed. This approach is called asynchronous input/output. Any task that depends on the I/O having completed (this includes both using the input values and critical operations that claim to assure that a write operation has been completed) still needs to wait for the I/O operation to complete, and thus is still blocked, but other processing that does not have a dependency on the I/O operation can continue.\n\nMany operating system functions exist to implement asynchronous I/O at many levels. In fact, one of the main functions of all but the most rudimentary of operating systems is to perform at least some form of basic asynchronous I/O, though this may not be particularly apparent to the user or the programmer. In the simplest software solution, the hardware device status is polled at intervals to detect whether the device is ready for its next operation. (For example, the CP/M operating system was built this way. Its system call semantics did not require any more elaborate I/O structure than this, though most implementations were more complex, and thereby more efficient.) Direct memory access (DMA) can greatly increase the efficiency of a polling-based system, and hardware interrupts can eliminate the need for polling entirely. Multitasking operating systems can exploit the functionality provided by hardware interrupts, whilst hiding the complexity of interrupt handling from the user. Spooling was one of the first forms of multitasking designed to exploit asynchronous I/O. Finally, multithreading and explicit asynchronous I/O APIs within user processes can exploit asynchronous I/O further, at the cost of extra software complexity.\n\nAsynchronous I/O is used to improve throughput, latency, and/or responsiveness.\n\nForms of I/O and examples of POSIX functions:\nAll forms of asynchronous I/O open applications up to potential resource conflicts and associated failure. Careful programming (often using mutual exclusion, semaphores, etc.) is required to prevent this.\n\nWhen exposing asynchronous I/O to applications there are a few broad classes of implementation. The form of the API provided to the application does not necessarily correspond with the mechanism actually provided by the operating system; emulations are possible. Furthermore, more than one method may be used by a single application, depending on its needs and the desires of its programmer(s). Many operating systems provide more than one of these mechanisms, it is possible that some may provide all of them.\n\nAvailable in early Unix. In a multitasking operating system, processing can be distributed across different processes, which run independently, have their own memory, and process their own I/O flows; these flows are typically connected in pipelines. Processes are fairly expensive to create and maintain, so this solution only works well if the set of processes is small and relatively stable. It also assumes that the individual processes can operate independently, apart from processing each other's I/O; if they need to communicate in other ways, coordinating them can become difficult.\n\nAn extension of this approach is dataflow programming, which allows more complicated networks than just the chains that pipes support.\n\nVariations:\n\nPolling provides non-blocking synchronous API which may be used to implement some asynchronous API. Available in traditional Unix and Windows. Its major problem is that it can waste CPU time polling repeatedly when there is nothing else for the issuing process to do, reducing the time available for other processes. Also, because a polling application is essentially single-threaded it may be unable to fully exploit I/O parallelism that the hardware is capable of.\n\nAvailable in BSD Unix, and almost anything else with a TCP/IP protocol stack that either utilizes or is modeled after the BSD implementation. A variation on the theme of polling, a select loop uses the codice_1 system call to sleep until a condition occurs on a file descriptor (e.g., when data is available for reading), a timeout occurs, or a signal is received (e.g., when a child process dies). By examining the return parameters of the codice_1 call, the loop finds out which file descriptor has changed and executes the appropriate code. Often, for ease of use, the select loop is implemented as an event loop, perhaps using callback functions; the situation lends itself particularly well to event-driven programming.\n\nWhile this method is reliable and relatively efficient, it depends heavily on the Unix paradigm that \"everything is a file\"; any blocking I/O that does not involve a file descriptor will block the process. The select loop also relies on being able to involve all I/O in the central codice_1 call; libraries that conduct their own I/O are particularly problematic in this respect. An additional potential problem is that the select and the I/O operations are still sufficiently decoupled that select's result may effectively be a lie: if two processes are reading from a single file descriptor (arguably bad design) the select may indicate the availability of read data that has disappeared by the time that the read is issued, thus resulting in blocking; if two processes are writing to a single file descriptor (not that uncommon) the select may indicate immediate writability yet the write may still block, because a buffer has been filled by the other process in the interim, or due to the write being too large for the available buffer or in other ways unsuitable to the recipient.\n\nThe select loop does not reach the ultimate system efficiency possible with, say, the \"completion queues\" method, because the semantics of the codice_1 call, allowing as it does for per-call tuning of the acceptable event set, consumes some amount of time per invocation traversing the selection array. This creates little overhead for user applications that might have open one file descriptor for the windowing system and a few for open files, but becomes more of a problem as the number of potential event sources grows, and can hinder development of many-client server applications, as in the C10k problem; other asynchronous methods may be noticeably more efficient in such cases. Some Unixes provide system-specific calls with better scaling; for example, codice_5 in Linux (that fills the return selection array with only those event sources on which an event has occurred), codice_6 in FreeBSD, and event ports (and codice_7) in Solaris.\n\nSVR3 Unix provided the codice_8 system call. Arguably better-named than codice_1, for the purposes of this discussion it is essentially the same thing. SVR4 Unixes (and thus POSIX) offer both calls.\n\nAvailable in BSD and POSIX Unix. I/O is issued asynchronously, and when it is completed a signal (interrupt) is generated. As in low-level kernel programming, the facilities available for safe use within the signal handler are limited, and the main flow of the process could have been interrupted at nearly any point, resulting in inconsistent data structures as seen by the signal handler. The signal handler is usually not able to issue further asynchronous I/O by itself.\n\nThe \"signal\" approach, though relatively simple to implement within the OS, brings to the application program the unwelcome baggage associated with writing an operating system's kernel interrupt system. Its worst characteristic is that \"every\" blocking (synchronous) system call is potentially interruptible; the programmer must usually incorporate retry code at each call. \n\nAvailable in the classic Mac OS, VMS and Windows. Bears many of the characteristics of the \"signal\" method as it is fundamentally the same thing, though rarely recognized as such. The difference is that each I/O request usually can have its own completion function, whereas the \"signal\" system has a single callback.\n\nOn the other hand, a potential problem is that stack depth can grow unmanageably, as an extremely common thing to do when one I/O is finished is to schedule another. If this should be satisfied immediately, the first callback is not 'unwound' off the stack before the next one is invoked. Systems to prevent this (like 'mid-ground' scheduling of new work) add complexity and reduce performance. In practice, however, this is generally not a problem because the new I/O will itself usually return as soon as the new I/O is started allowing the stack to be 'unwound'. The problem can also be prevented by avoiding any further callbacks, by means of a queue, until the first callback returns.\n\nLight-weight processes (LWPs) or threads are available in more modern Unixes, originating in Plan 9 . Like the \"process\" method, but without the data isolation that hampers coordination of the flows. This lack of isolation introduces its own problems, usually requiring kernel-provided synchronization mechanisms and thread-safe libraries. Each LWP or thread itself uses traditional blocking synchronous I/O. The requisite separate per-thread stack may preclude large-scale implementations using very large numbers of threads. The separation of textual (code) and time (event) flows provides fertile ground for errors.\n\nThis approach is also used in the Erlang programming language runtime system. The Erlang virtual machine uses asynchronous I/O using a small pool of only a few threads or sometimes just one process, to handle I/O from up to millions of Erlang processes. I/O handling in each process is written mostly using blocking synchronous I/O. This way high performance of asynchronous I/O is merged with simplicity of normal I/O. Many I/O problems in Erlang are mapped to message passing, which can be easily processed using built-in selective receive.\n\nAvailable in Microsoft Windows, Solaris, AmigaOS, and DNIX. I/O requests are issued asynchronously, but notifications of completion are provided via a synchronizing queue mechanism in the order they are completed. Usually associated with a state-machine structuring of the main process (event-driven programming), which can bear little resemblance to a process that does not use asynchronous I/O or that uses one of the other forms, hampering code reuse. Does not require additional special synchronization mechanisms or thread-safe libraries, nor are the textual (code) and time (event) flows separated.\n\nAvailable in VMS and AmigaOS (often used in conjunction with a completion port). Bears many of the characteristics of the \"completion queue\" method, as it is essentially a completion queue of depth one. To simulate the effect of queue 'depth', an additional event flag is required for each potential unprocessed (but completed) event, or event information can be lost. Waiting for the next available event in such a clump requires synchronizing mechanisms that may not scale well to larger numbers of potentially parallel events.\n\nAvailable in mainframes by IBM, Groupe Bull, and Unisys. Channel I/O is designed to maximize CPU utilization and throughput by offloading most I/O onto a coprocessor. The coprocessor has onboard DMA, handles device interrupts, is controlled by the main CPU, and only interrupts the main CPU when it's truly necessary. This architecture also supports so-called channel programs that run on the channel processor to do heavy lifting for I/O activities and protocols.\n\nAvailable in Windows Server 2012 and Windows 8. Optimized for applications that process large numbers of small messages to achieve higher I/O operations per second with reduced jitter and latency.\n\nThe vast majority of general-purpose computing hardware relies entirely upon two methods of implementing asynchronous I/O: polling and interrupts. Usually both methods are used together, the balance depends heavily upon the design of the hardware and its required performance characteristics. (DMA is not itself another independent method, it is merely a means by which more work can be done per poll or interrupt.)\n\nPure polling systems are entirely possible, small microcontrollers (such as systems using the PIC) are often built this way. CP/M systems could also be built this way (though rarely were), with or without DMA. Also, when the utmost performance is necessary for only a \"few\" tasks, at the expense of any other potential tasks, polling may also be appropriate as the overhead of taking interrupts may be unwelcome. (Servicing an interrupt requires time [and space] to save at least part of the processor state, along with the time required to resume the interrupted task.)\n\nMost general-purpose computing systems rely heavily upon interrupts. A pure interrupt system may be possible, though usually some component of polling is also required, as it is very common for multiple potential sources of interrupts to share a common interrupt signal line, in which case polling is used within the device driver to resolve the actual source. (This resolution time also contributes to an interrupt system's performance penalty. Over the years a great deal of work has been done to try to minimize the overhead associated with servicing an interrupt. Current interrupt systems are rather lackadaisical when compared to some highly tuned earlier ones, but the general increase in hardware performance has greatly mitigated this.)\n\nHybrid approaches are also possible, wherein an interrupt can trigger the beginning of some burst of asynchronous I/O, and polling is used within the burst itself. This technique is common in high-speed device drivers, such as network or disk, where the time lost in returning to the pre-interrupt task is greater than the time until the next required servicing. (Common I/O hardware in use these days relies heavily upon DMA and large data buffers to make up for a relatively poorly-performing interrupt system. These characteristically use polling inside the driver loops, and can exhibit tremendous throughput. Ideally the per-datum polls are always successful, or at most repeated a small number of times.)\n\nAt one time this sort of hybrid approach was common in disk and network drivers where there was not DMA or significant buffering available. Because the desired transfer speeds were faster even than could tolerate the minimum four-operation per-datum loop (bit-test, conditional-branch-to-self, fetch, and store), the hardware would often be built with automatic wait state generation on the I/O device, pushing the data ready poll out of software and onto the processor's fetch or store hardware and reducing the programmed loop to two operations. (In effect using the processor itself as a DMA engine.) The 6502 processor offered an unusual means to provide a three-element per-datum loop, as it had a hardware pin that, when asserted, would cause the processor's Overflow bit to be set directly. (Obviously one would have to take great care in the hardware design to avoid overriding the Overflow bit outside of the device driver!)\n\nUsing only these two tools (polling, and interrupts), all the other forms of asynchronous I/O discussed above may be (and in fact, are) synthesized.\n\nIn an environment such as a Java Virtual Machine (JVM), asynchronous I/O can be synthesized \"even though\" the environment the JVM is running in may not offer it at all. This is due to the interpreted nature of the JVM. The JVM may poll (or take an interrupt) periodically to institute an internal flow of control change, effecting the appearance of multiple simultaneous processes, at least some of which presumably exist in order to perform asynchronous I/O. (Of course, at the microscopic level the parallelism may be rather coarse and exhibit some non-ideal characteristics, but on the surface it will appear to be as desired.)\n\nThat, in fact, is the problem with using polling in any form to synthesize a different form of asynchronous I/O. Every CPU cycle that is a poll is wasted, and lost to overhead rather than accomplishing a desired task. Every CPU cycle that is \"not\" a poll represents an increase in latency of reaction to pending I/O. Striking an acceptable balance between these two opposing forces is difficult. (This is why hardware interrupt systems were invented in the first place.)\n\nThe trick to maximize efficiency is to minimize the amount of work that has to be done upon reception of an interrupt in order to awaken the appropriate application. Secondarily (but perhaps no less important) is the method the application itself uses to determine what it needs to do.\n\nParticularly problematic (for application efficiency) are the exposed polling methods, including the select/poll mechanisms. Though the underlying I/O events they are interested in are in all likelihood interrupt-driven, the interaction \"to\" this mechanism is polled and can consume a large amount of time in the poll. This is particularly true of the potentially large-scale polling possible through select (and poll). Interrupts map very well to Signals, Callback functions, Completion Queues, and Event flags, such systems can be very efficient.\n\nFollowing examples shows concepts of three I/O approaches on the reading operation. Objects and functions are abstract.\n\n1. Blocking, synchronous:\n\ndevice = IO.open()\ndata = device.read() # thread will be blocked until there is data in the device\nprint(data)\n\n2. Non-blocking, synchronous:\n\ndevice = IO.open()\nready = False\nwhile not ready:\ndata = device.read()\nprint(data)\n\n3. Non-blocking, asynchronous:\n\nios = IO.IOService()\ndevice = IO.open(ios)\n\ndef inputHandler(data, err):\n\ndevice.readSome(inputHandler)\nios.loop() # wait till all operations have been completed and call all appropriate handlers\n\nHere is the example with Reactor pattern:\n\ndevice = IO.open()\nreactor = IO.Reactor()\n\ndef inputHandler(data):\n\nreactor.addHandler(inputHandler, device, IO.INPUT)\nreactor.run() # run reactor, which handles events and calls appropriate handlers\n\n"}

Born in a small town in East Texas, these roots would influence his work for his entire life.\n\nIn World War II he served as an officer aboard an aircraft carrier in the South Pacific, where he began work on one of his most important and critically acclaimed books, \"The House of Breath\". After the war and through the 1950s he published short stories, collections of stories, other novels, and plays. He never achieved commercial success in America, but his translated work was highly regarded in Europe. During his life he could not completely support himself through his writing, so at various times he took work as an editor and teacher at several prominent universities. At one point he did not write fiction for several years, calling it a \"relief\" to not have to worry about his writing.\n\nMajor themes in his work include home and family, place, time, sexuality, isolation, and memory. His style of writing is not easily categorized, and he eschewed labels of genre placed on his works.\nIn 1963, he married Doris Roberts, the actress perhaps best known for her work in \"Everybody Loves Raymond\"; they remained together until his death in 1983.\n\nGoyen was born in the small town of Trinity, Texas, on April 24, 1915, to Charles Provine and Mary Inez (née Trow) Goyen. His father worked at the local sawmill, and his mother's family ran the post office.\n\nHe was the oldest of three children and thought to be epileptic; he \"was subject to sudden and prolonged spells of crying.\" In 1923 he moved with his family to Houston. He resided in the Woodland Heights neighborhood, where he attended Travis Elementary School and Hogg Middle School. In 1932 he graduated from Sam Houston High School. He attended Rice Institute (now University), where he earned a BA in literature (1937) and an MA in comparative literature (1939). He briefly pursued a Ph.D. at the University of Iowa.\n\nGoyen taught for one year at the University of Houston in 1939, then joined in the U.S. Navy that same year. During World War II he served as an officer on the aircraft carrier USS Casablanca in the South Pacific. After the war he and Navy friend Walter Berns moved to Taos, New Mexico, where they lived near benefactor Frieda Lawrence (widow of D.H. Lawrence) to pursue writing. He traveled and lived at various times in New Mexico, Europe, New York, and California, living principally in New York.\n\nFrom 1955-60, he taught creative writing at the New School of Social Research, which provided opportunities for European travel and literary productivity. During the 1960s he taught at various universities, including Columbia, Princeton, and the University of Houston. From 1966-71 he was a senior trade editor for McGraw-Hill, but resigned to return to his writing. In 1973 he was visiting Professor of English at Brown University. He moved to Los Angeles in 1975 and lived there most of the rest of his life.\n\nBiographers have noted his sometimes excessive drinking, sometimes fragile mental state and ambiguous sexual orientation. His drinking at times became debilitating. Of his mental state when he would work, Goyen stated: \"\"Ghost and Flesh\" ... you can see in those stories ... wow ... quite surreal and I loved those, and when that was finished and published, I kind of went off the beam. I think the book made me quite mad; writing it, the obsession of that book;…\"\n\nIn 1951 he had an affair with writer Katherine Anne Porter, but their restored letters to each other during this time reveal \"the convoluted nature\" of their relationship, \"one of the most hopeless of her life\".\n\nHis interest in the theater and stage productions (original plays and adaptations of his own work) brought him into contact with the actress Doris Roberts, who starred in one of his plays. They married on November 10, 1963. In an interview after his death, Ms. Roberts said the greatest influence on her life was Goyen, referring to him as her \"mentor\".\n\nIn 1971, Goyen had a conversion experience, which he described in some detail:\n\nThis experience produced the nonfiction work, \"A Book of Jesus\". Of this work Goyen said: \"A very real man began to live with me, of flesh and blood. He did the same work on me that He did on the people of the New Testament that He walked among….\"\n\nIn 1976 he joined Alcoholics Anonymous and stopped drinking altogether. His later years were among the most productive in his life. He died in Los Angeles of leukemia on August 30, 1983, aged 68, two months before his novel \"Arcadio\" was published.\n\nGoyen began writing what would become his first book, \"The House of Breath\", when he served on an aircraft carrier during World War II. After the war he continued work on the novel and began writing short stories. His first published short story, \"The White Rooster,\" appeared in \"Mademoiselle\" in April 1947. Other stories included \"The Fallen Splendid House\" in \"Southwest Review\", in Spring 1949, and \"A Bridge of Breath\" in \"Partisan Review\", in June 1949.\n\nIn 1948 he received a Literary Fellowship from \"Southwest Review\". During this time he was also working on a translation from French of Albert Cossery's \"Les fainéants dans la vallée fertile\" (\"The Lazy Ones\"), which would be published in 1952. In 1950, his first book, \"The House of Breath\", was received with critical acclaim and led to support through fellowships and awards.\n\nIn 1950-51, he lived in New York, Chicago, Houston, and New Mexico, while completing stories for what would be his first collection, \"Ghost and Flesh: Stories and Tales\". About this time his work was being translated into German and French by Ernst Robert Curtius and Maurice Coindreau in Europe, where it remains in print in several languages and where he is highly regarded.\n\nIn the early 1950s he began to write plays and adaptations of his own works for the stage, and he eventually had several of his plays produced over many years: \"The Diamond Rattler\" (1960), \"Christy\" (1964), \"House of Breath Black/White\" (1971), and \"Aimee\" (1973). In 1954 the stage version of his first novel was produced off Broadway, and 1955 saw publication of his second novel, \"In a Farther Country\", which had a hostile reception.\n\nDuring this time he was becoming more involved in the theatre world and traveled back and forth between New York and New Mexico. In 1958 he revised the screenplay and wrote song lyrics for the Paul Newman film, \"The Left-Handed Gun\". A comic novel, \"The Fair Sister\", about two African-American families, was published in 1963, but it was pulled by the publisher after a reviewer in \"The New York Times Book Review\" called Goyen \"insensitive\". \n\nHe continued to have difficulty finding publishers and audiences for his work in America. He gave up his own writing when he was an editor with McGraw-Hill, from 1966-71. He would later say about this time in his life: \"There was no question of my own writing. I was relieved not to have to worry about my own writing.\" Following a conversion experience in 1971, he published the non-fiction work, \"A Book of Jesus\", in 1973. A biographer later noted: \"Jesus cost Goyen his editorial job.\"\n\nHis fourth novel, \"Come the Restorer\", was published in 1974. This tale about a community's search for a savior Goyen called his \"biggest accomplishment\". His limited readership made commercial publishers wary, and even for \"Arcadio\", his final novel, he had to search widely for an interested firm. By this time \"no one would touch his writing.\" \n\n\"Arcadio\" was published two months after his death in 1983. The book concerns a hermaphrodite who, in general terms, is seeking a way to reconcile the warring halves of his/her self. A posthumous publication included \"Half a Look of Cain: A Fantastical Narrative\", which was written in the 1950s and early 1960s and was published in 1998.\n\nGoyen is considered \"a writer's writer\". His East Texas origins and early childhood had an enduring influence on the speech patterns and cultural characteristics reflected in his writings, which are marked by the rhythms of rural speech, the Bible, and a sense of story and place.\n\nHis style has been compared to Virginia Woolf, William Faulkner, and Gabriel García Márquez. Biographer Peede notes that his works are known \"for their incantatory passages, their fragmented brilliance, but not their seamless design.\" Critics have tried to define his style with labels such as Southern, Southern Gothic, modernist, postmodernist, contemporary, and magical realist. But Goyen insisted that his work should be considered outside any genre: \"I'm really not very interested in contemporary fiction, anyway. I consider my fiction absolutely separate and apart from and unrelated to \"contemporary American fiction.\"\n\nRecurring themes in Goyen's work include alienation (from self and from the world), isolation, loneliness, home and family, time, memory, spirituality, sexuality, and place.\n\nGoyen was the recipient of several awards and fellowships. These include:\n\nThe importance of Goyen's contribution to literature is not settled. Some critics have argued that he may yet prove to be one of the most distinctive literary voices of the 20th century. His books continued to remain in print in Europe long after they were unavailable in America.\n\nIn 2001, Doris Roberts established the Doris Roberts-William Goyen Fellowship in Fiction through the Christopher Isherwood Foundation. The monetary award is given annually and intended to support writers who have published at least one book of fiction, either a novel or a collection of stories.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1880976", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1880976", "title": "Wagon-wheel effect", "text": "Wagon-wheel effect\n\nThe wagon-wheel effect (alternatively called stagecoach-wheel effect or stroboscopic effect) is an optical illusion in which a spoked wheel appears to rotate differently from its true rotation. The wheel can appear to rotate more slowly than the true rotation, it can appear stationary, or it can appear to rotate in the opposite direction from the true rotation. This last form of the effect is sometimes called the reverse rotation effect.\n\nThe wagon-wheel effect is most often seen in film or television depictions of stagecoaches or wagons in Western movies, although recordings of any regularly spoked rotating object will show it, such as helicopter rotors, aircraft propellers and car commercials. In these recorded media, the effect is a result of temporal aliasing. It can also commonly be seen when a rotating wheel is illuminated by flickering light. These forms of the effect are known as stroboscopic effects: the original smooth rotation of the wheel is visible only intermittently. A version of the wagon-wheel effect can also be seen under continuous illumination.\n\nStroboscopic conditions ensure that the visibility of a rotating wheel is broken into a series of brief episodes in which its motion is either absent (in the case of movie cameras) or minimal (in the case of stroboscopes), interrupted by longer episodes of invisibility. It is customary to call the former episodes \"frames\". An analog movie camera that records images on filmstock typically operates at 24 frames per second while digital movie cameras operate at 25 frames per second (PAL; European Standards), or at 29.97 frames per second (NTSC; North American Standards). A standard television operates at 59.94 or at 50 images per second (a video frame is two separate images; see interlace). A stroboscope can typically have its frequency set to any value. Artificial lighting that is temporally modulated when powered by alternating current, such as gas discharge lamps (including neon, mercury vapor, sodium vapor and fluorescent tubes), flicker at twice the frequency of the power line (for example 100 times per second on a 50-cycle line). In each cycle of current the power peaks twice (once with positive voltage and once with negative voltage) and twice goes to zero, and the light output varies accordingly. In all of these cases, a person sees a rotating wheel under stroboscopic conditions.\n\nImagine that the true rotation of a four-spoke wheel is clockwise. The first instance of visibility of the wheel may occur when one spoke is at 12 o'clock. If by the time the next instance of visibility occurs, the spoke previously at 9 o'clock has moved into the 12-o'clock position, then a viewer will perceive the wheel to be stationary. If at the second instance of visibility, the next spoke has moved to the 11:30 position, then a viewer will perceive the wheel to be rotating backwards. If at the second instance of visibility, the next spoke has moved to the 12:30 position, then a viewer will perceive the wheel to be rotating forwards, albeit more slowly than the wheel is actually rotating. The effect relies on a motion perception property called beta movement: motion is seen between two objects in different positions in the visual field at different times providing the objects are similar (which is true of spoked wheels—each spoke is essentially identical to the others) and providing the objects are close (which is true of the originally 9-o'clock spoke in the second instant—it is closer to 12 o'clock than the originally 12-o'clock spoke).\n\nThe wagon-wheel effect is exploited in some engineering tasks, such as adjusting the timing of an engine. This same effect can make some rotating machines, such as lathes, dangerous to operate under artificial lighting because at certain speeds the machines will falsely appear to be stopped or to be moving slowly.\n\nFinlay, Dodwell, and Caelli (1984) and Finlay and Dodwell (1987) studied perception of rotating wheels under stroboscopic illumination when the duration of each frame was long enough for observers to see the real rotation. Despite this, the rotation direction was dominated by the wagon-wheel effect. Finlay and Dodwell (1987) argued that there are some critical differences between the wagon-wheel effect and beta movement, but their argument has not troubled the consensus.\n\nRushton (1967) observed the wagon-wheel effect under continuous illumination while humming. The humming vibrates the eyes in their sockets, effectively creating stroboscopic conditions within the eye. By humming at a frequency of a multiple of the rotation frequency, he was able to stop the rotation. By humming at slightly higher and lower frequencies, he was able to make the rotation reverse slowly and to make the rotation go slowly in the direction of rotation. A similar stroboscopic effect is now commonly observed by people eating crunchy foods, such as carrots, while watching TV: the image appears to shimmer. The crunching vibrates the eyes at a multiple of the frame rate of the TV. Besides vibrations of the eyes, the effect can be produced by observing wheels via a vibrating mirror. Rear-view mirrors in vibrating cars can produce the effect.\n\nThe first to observe the wagon-wheel effect under truly continuous illumination (such as from the sun) was Schouten (1967). He distinguished three forms of subjective stroboscopy which he called alpha, beta, and gamma: Alpha stroboscopy occurs at 8–12 cycles per second; the wheel appears to become stationary, although \"some sectors [spokes] look as though they are performing a hurdle race over the standing ones\" (p. 48). Beta stroboscopy occurs at 30–35 cycles per second: \"The distinctness of the pattern has all but disappeared. At times a definite counterrotation is seen of a grayish striped pattern\" (pp. 48–49). Gamma stroboscopy occurs at 40–100 cycles per second: \"The disk appears almost uniform except that \"at all sector frequencies\" a standing grayish pattern is seen ... in a quivery sort of standstill\" (pp. 49–50). Schouten interpreted beta stroboscopy, reversed rotation, as consistent with there being Reichardt detectors in the human visual system for encoding motion. Because the spoked wheel patterns he used (radial gratings) are regular, they can strongly stimulate detectors for the true rotation, but also weakly stimulate detectors for the reverse rotation.\n\nThere are two broad theories for the wagon-wheel effect under truly continuous illumination. The first is that human visual perception takes a series of still frames of the visual scene and that movement is perceived much like a movie. The second is Schouten's theory: that moving images are processed by visual detectors sensitive to the true motion and also by detectors sensitive to opposite motion from temporal aliasing. There is evidence for both theories, but the weight of evidence favours the latter.\n\nPurves, Paydarfar, and Andrews (1996) proposed the discrete-frames theory. One piece of evidence for this theory comes from Dubois and VanRullen (2011). They reviewed experiences of users of LSD who often report that under the influence of the drug a moving object is seen trailing a series of still images behind it. They asked such users to match their drug experiences with movies simulating such trailing images viewed when not under the drug. They found that users selected movies around 15–20 Hz. This is between Schouten's alpha and beta rates.\n\nKline, Holcombe, and Eagleman (2004) confirmed the observation of reversed rotation with regularly spaced dots on a rotating drum. They called this \"illusory motion reversal\". They showed that these occurred only after a long time of viewing the rotating display (from about 30 seconds to as long as 10 minutes for some observers). They also showed that the incidences of reversed rotation were independent in different parts of the visual field. This is inconsistent with discrete frames covering the entire visual scene. Kline, Holcombe, and Eagleman (2006) also showed that reversed rotation of a radial grating in one part of the visual field was independent of superimposed orthogonal motion in the same part of the visual field. The orthogonal motion was of a circular grating contracting so as to have the same temporal frequency as the radial grating. This is inconsistent with discrete frames covering local parts of visual scene. Kline et al. concluded that the reverse rotations were consistent with Reichardt detectors for the reverse direction of rotation becoming sufficiently active to dominate perception of the true rotation in a form of rivalry. The long time required to see the reverse rotation suggests that neural adaptation of the detectors responding to the true rotation has to occur before the weakly stimulated reverse-rotation detectors can contribute to perception.\n\nSome small doubts about the results of Kline et al. (2004) sustain adherents of the discrete-frame theory. These doubts include Kline et al.'s finding in some observers more instances of simultaneous reversals from different parts of the visual field than would be expected by chance, and finding in some observers differences in the distribution of the durations of reversals from that expected by a pure rivalry process (Rojas, Carmona-Fontaine, López-Calderón, & Aboitiz, 2006).\n\nIn 2008, Kline and Eagleman demonstrated that illusory reversals of two spatially overlapping motions could be perceived separately, providing further evidence that illusory motion reversal is not caused by temporal sampling. They also showed that illusory motion reversal occurs with non-uniform and non-periodic stimuli (for example, a spinning belt of sandpaper), which also cannot be compatible with discrete sampling. Kline and Eagleman proposed instead that the effect results from a \"motion during-effect\", meaning that a motion after-effect becomes superimposed on the real motion.\n\nBecause of the illusion this can give to moving machinery, it is advised that single-phase lighting be avoided in workshops and factories. For example, a factory that is lit from a single-phase supply with basic fluorescent lighting will have a flicker of twice the mains frequency, either at 100 or 120 Hz (depending on country); thus, any machinery rotating at multiples of this frequency may appear to not be turning. Seeing that the most common types of AC motors are locked to the mains frequency, this can pose a considerable hazard to operators of lathes and other rotating equipment. Solutions include deploying the lighting over a full 3-phase supply, or by using high-frequency controllers that drive the lights at safer frequencies. Traditional incandescent light bulbs, which employ filaments that glow continuously with only a minor modulation, offer another option as well, albeit at the expense of increased power consumption. Smaller incandescent lights can be used as task lighting on equipment to help combat this effect to avoid the cost of operating larger quantities of incandescent lighting in a workshop environment.\n\n\n"}

The term was coined in the field of linguistics to describe listeners' behaviours during verbal communication. (See Backchannel (linguistics).)\n\nThe term \"backchannel\" generally refers to online conversation about the conference topic or speaker. Occasionally backchannel provides audience members a chance to fact-check the presentation.\n\nFirst growing in popularity at technology conferences, backchannel is increasingly a factor in education where WiFi connections and laptop computers allow participants to use ordinary chat like IRC or AIM to actively communicate during presentation. More recent research include works where the backchannel is brought publicly visible, such as the ClassCommons, backchan.nl and Fragmented Social Mirror.\n\nTwitter is also widely used today by audiences to create backchannels during broadcasting of content or at conferences. For example, television drama, other forms of entertainment and magazine programs. This practice is often also called live tweeting. Many conferences nowadays also have a hashtag that can be used by the participants to share notes and experiences; furthermore such hashtags can be user generated.\n\nVictor Yngve first used the phrase \"back channel\" in 1970 in a linguistic meaning, in the following passage: \"In fact, both the person who has the turn and his partner are simultaneously engaged in both speaking and listening. This is because of the existence of what I call the back channel, over which the person who has the turn receives short messages such as 'yes' and 'uh-huh' without relinquishing the turn.\"\n\nSuch systems were widely imagined and tested in late 1990s and early 2000s. These cases include researcher's installations on conferences and classroom settings. The first famous instance of backchannel communications influencing a talk occurred on March 26, 2002, at the PC Forum conference, when Qwest CEO Joe Nacchio famously lamented the difficulties of raising capital. Journalists Dan Gillmor and Doc Searls posted accounts, from the audience, in real-time, to their weblogs. Buzz Bruggeman, a reader of Gillmor's, emailed information about a recent sizable transaction that had made Nacchio very wealthy; both Gillmor and Searls updated their weblogs with that information.\n\nIn her article referring to the \"Parallel Channel,\" PC Forum host Esther Dyson wrote, \"around that point, the audience turned hostile.\" Many commentators later attributed the audience's hostility to the information people shared while surfing and communicating on their laptops during Nacchio's remarks.\n\nResearch has demonstrated that backchannels help participants to feel as contributing members, not passive followers and make them feel more social. However, the research is mixed on the nature of this discussions, and especially regarding social interaction on the backchannels: some cases report vast interaction where as others highlight that interaction on the platform was considered low. There are indicators that these tools however engage different members of the audience to provide their input.\n\nSince its inception in 1998 at Argonne National Laboratory, the Internet2 initiative known as the Access Grid (a large-format presentation, video conferencing and interactive environment) has used backchannel communications to permit the node operators to pass URLs for display at another site, troubleshoot problems and even discuss what's for lunch at their location. The Access Grid backchannel has evolved from the use of a MOO to XMPP.\n\nIn 2009 Purdue University developed a tool called Hotseat that enabled students to comment on the course lectures in near real-time using social networking tools such as Facebook and Twitter.\n\nUsing a backchannel for educational purposes can function as a formal class activity or even an independent discussion without instructor participation and awareness. Aside from the normal discussion, a backchannel can also be used for note taking, asking questions, offering suggestions on different topics, and sharing resources with other students and faculty members. There are many different media networks out there that can be used as a backchannel. Including Twitter, Facebook, Yammer and Instant Messaging.\n\nJoichi Ito's HeckleBot includes an LED text panel displaying phrases sent from the chat room to catch the attention of the speaker or audience. The USC Interactive Media Division has experimented with \"Google Jockeys\" to feed visual information and search results between the speakers and the backchannel, projected on multiple screens surrounding their seminars. Software like SubEthaEdit allows for more formal backchannel: collaborative notetaking. In 2007 the Building Learning Communities Conference in Boston, Massachusetts used tools such as Twitter and Skype to create backchannels that included participants who were not on location and at times in remote parts of the world. At times presenters were not aware of the backchannel and other occasions the presenters themselves were involved in the backchannel.\n\n"}
{"id": "1880990", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1880990", "title": "Architecture of the California missions", "text": "Architecture of the California missions\n\nThe architecture of the California missions was influenced by several factors, those being the limitations in the construction materials that were on hand, an overall lack of skilled labor, and a desire on the part of the founding priests to emulate notable structures in their Spanish homeland. And while no two mission complexes are identical, they all employed the same basic building style.\n\nAlthough the missions were considered temporary ventures by the Spanish hierarchy, the development of an individual settlement was not simply a matter of \"priestly whim.\" The founding of a mission followed longstanding rules and procedures; the paperwork involved required months, sometimes years of correspondence, and demanded the attention of virtually every level of the bureaucracy. Once empowered to erect a mission in a given area, the men assigned to it chose a specific site that featured a good water supply, plenty of wood for fires and building material, and ample fields for grazing herds and raising crops. The padres blessed the site, and with the aid of their military escort fashioned temporary shelters out of tree limbs or driven stakes, roofed with thatch or reeds. It was these simple huts that would ultimately give way to the stone and adobe buildings which exist to this day.\n\nThe first priority when beginning a settlement was the location and construction of the church (\"iglesia\"). The majority of mission sanctuaries were oriented on a roughly east–west axis to take the best advantage of the sun's position for interior illumination; the exact alignment depended on the geographic features of the particular site. Once the spot for the church was selected, its position would be marked and the remainder of the mission complex would be laid out. The priests' quarters, refectory, \"convento\", workshops, kitchens, soldiers' and servants' living quarters, storerooms, and other ancillary chambers were usually grouped around a walled, open court or patio (often in the form of a quadrangle) inside which religious celebrations and other festive events often took place. The \"cuadrángulo\" was rarely a perfect square because the Fathers had no surveying instruments at their disposal and simply measured off all dimensions by foot. In the event of an attack by hostile forces the mission's inhabitants could take refuge within the quadrangle.\n\nThe basic, common elements found in all of the Alta California missions can be summarized as follows:\n\n\nThe Alta California missions as a whole do not incorporate the same variety or elaborateness of detail in their design exhibited in the structures erected by Spanish settlers in Arizona, Texas, and Mexico during the same T.V period; nevertheless, they \"\"...stand as concrete reminders of Spanish occupation and admirable examples of buildings conceived in the style and manner appropriate to the country in which they were built.\"\" Some fanciful accounts regarding the construction of the missions claimed that tunnels were incorporated into garden the design, to be used as a means of emergency egress in the event of attack; however, no historical evidence (written or physical) has ever been uncovered to support these wild assertions.\n\nThe scarcity of imported materials, together with a lack of skilled laborers, compelled the Fathers to employ simple building materials and methods in the construction of mission structures. Since importing the quantity of materials necessary for a large mission complex was impossible, the padres had to gather the materials they needed from the land around them. Five basic materials we used sexucting the permanent mission structures: adobe, timber, stone, brick, and tile. \"Adobes\" (mud bricks) were made from a combination of earth and water, with chaff, straw, or manure added to bind the mixture together. Occasionally pieces of bricks or shells were placed in the mix to improve the cohesiveness. The soil used may have been clay, loam, or sandy or gravelly earth. The making of the bricks was a simple process, derived from methods originally developed in Spain and Mexico. A convenient, level spot was chosen near the intended building site and close to a suitable water supply (usually a spring or creek). The ground was dug up and soaked with water, whereupon bare-legged workers would stomp the wet earth and binders into a homogeneous consistency fit for carrying to, and placing in, the brick molds.\n\nThe mixture was compressed into the wooden \"formas\", which were arranged in rows, and leveled by hand to the top of the frame. From time to time, a worker would leave an imprint of his hand or foot on the surface of a wet brick, or perhaps a literate workman would inscribe his name and the date on the face. When the forms were filled, the bricks were left in the sun to dry. Great care was taken to expose the bricks on all sides, in order to ensure uniform drying and prevent cracking. Once dry, the bricks were stacked in rows to await their use. California adobes measured , were thick, and weighed , making them convenient to carry and easy to handle during the construction process.\n\nFacilities for milling lumber were almost non-existent: workers used stone axes and crude saws to shape the wood, and often used logs which only had their bark stripped from them. These methods gave mission structures their distinctive appearance. Timber was used to reinforce walls, as \"vigas\" (beams) to support roofs, and as forms for door and window openings and arches. Since most of the settlements were located in valleys or coastal plains almost totally devoid of suitably large trees, the padres were in most cases limited to pine, alder, poplar, cypress and juniper trees for use in their construction efforts. Indians used wooden \"carrettas\", drawn by oxen, to haul timber from as much as forty miles away (as was the case at Mission San Miguel Arcángel). At Mission San Luis Rey, however, the ingenious Father Lasuén instructed his neophyte workers to float logs downriver from Palomar Mountain to the mission site. The lack of good-sized timber forced the men to design mission buildings that were long and narrow. For example, the widest inside dimensions of any of the mission buildings (at San Carlos, Santa Clara, and Santa Cruz) is : the narrowest, at Mission Soledad, spans . The longest structure, at Mission Santa Barbara, stretches . Stone (\"piedra\") was used as a construction material whenever possible. In the absence of skilled stonemasons, the inexperienced builders resorted to the use of sandstone; though easier to cut, it was not as weather-resistant as that which would have been used by skilled artisans. To bind the stones together, the priests and Indians followed the (Mexican) Pre-Columbian technique of using mud mortar, since mortar made from lime was unavailable to them. Colored stones and pebbles were added to the mud mixture, giving it \"\"a beautiful and interesting texture\".\"\n\n\"Ladrillos\" (conventional bricks) were manufactured in much the same manner as adobes, with one important difference: after forming and initial drying, the bricks were fired in outdoor kilns to ensure a much greater endurance than could be achieved through merely sun-drying them. Common bricks typically measured ten inches (250 mm) square and were thick. Square paving bricks were equal in thickness to the common variety, but ranged from across. Many of the structures erected with this type of brick remained standing long after their adobe counterparts had been reduced to rubble.\n\nThe earliest structures had roofs of thatch or earth supported by flat poles. \"Tejas\" (roof tiles) were utilized in later construction (beginning around 1790) to replace the flammable thatch. The semicircular tiles consisted of clay molded over a section of a log was which well-sanded to prevent the clay from sticking. According to the accounts of Father Estévan Tapís of Mission Santa Barbara, some thirty-two Native American males were required to make 500 tiles each day, while the women carried sand and straw to the pits. The mixture was first worked in pits under the hoofs of animals, then placed on a flat board and fashioned to the correct thickness. Sheets of clay were then placed over the logs and cut the desired to size: they ranged in length from , and tapered from in width. After trimming, the tiles were dried in the sun, then placed in ovens and burned until they took on a reddish-brown coloring. The quality of the tiles varied greatly among the missions due to differences in soil types from one site to another. Legend has it that the first tiles were made at Mission San Luis Obispo, but Father Maynard Geiger (the Franciscan historian and biographer of Junípero Serra) claims that Mission San Antonio de Padua was actually the first to use them. Aside from their obvious advantage over straw roofs in terms of fire retardance, the impermeable surface also protected the adobe walls below from the damaging effects of rain. The original tiles were secured with a dab of adobe and were held in place because of their shape, being tapered at the upper end so they could not slide off one another.\n\nThe earliest projects had a layer of streambed stones arranged as a foundation, upon which the adobes were placed. Later, stone and masonry were used for foundation courses, which greatly added to the bearing capacity of the brickwork. Aside from superficial leveling, no other ground preparation was done before construction started. There is some evidence to indicate that the initial structures at some of the outposts were produced by setting wooden posts close together and filling the interstitial spaces with clay. At completion, the building would be covered with a thatched roof and wall surfaces would be coated with whitewash to keep the clay exterior from eroding. This type of construction is known as \"wattle and daub\" (\"jacal\" to the natives) and eventually gave way to the use of adobe, stone, or \"ladrillos\". Even though many of the adobe structures were ultimately replaced with ones of piedra or brick, adobe was still employed extensively and was the principal material used in building the missions as there was an almost universal lack of readily-available stone. The adobes were laid in courses and cemented together with wet clay. Due to the low bearing strength of adobe and the lack of skilled brick masons (\"albañils\"), walls made of mud bricks had to be fairly thick. The width of a wall depended mostly on its height: low walls were commonly two feet thick, while the highest (up to thirty-five feet) required as much as six feet of material to support them.\n\nTimbers were set into the upper courses of most walls to stiffen them. Massive exterior buttresses were also employed to fortify wall sections (see the photo at right), but this method of reinforcement required the inclusion of pilasters on the inside of the building to resist the lateral thrust of the buttresses and prevent the collapse of the wall. Pilasters and buttresses were often composed of more durable baked brick, even when the walls they supported were adobe. When the walls got too high for workers on the ground to reach the top, simple wood scaffolding was erected from whatever lumber was available. Many times posts were temporarily cemented into the walls to support catwalks. When the wall was completed, the posts were removed and the voids filled with adobe, or were sometimes sawed off flush with the surface of the wall.\n\nThe Spaniards had various types of rudimentary hoists and cranes at their disposal for lifting materials to the men working on top of a structure. These machines were fashioned out of wood and rope, and were usually similar in configuration to a ship's rigging. In fact, sailors were often employed in mission construction to apply their knowledge of maritime rigging to the handling of loads. It is not apparent as to whether or not the padres used pulleys in their lifting devices, but these instruments nevertheless got the job done. Unless adobes were protected from the elements they would eventually dissolve into nothing more than heaps of mud. Most adobe walls, therefore, were either whitewashed or stuccoed inside and out. Whitewash was a mixture of lime and water which was brushed on the interior surfaces of partition walls; stucco was a longer-lasting, viscous blend of aggregate (in this case, sand) and whitewash, applied to the faces of load-bearing walls with a \"paleta\" (trowel). Usually the face of a wall that was to receive stucco would be scored so that the mixture would adhere better, or laborers would press bits of broken tile or small stones into the wet mortar to provide a varied surface for the stucco to cling to.\n\nOnce erection of the walls was completed, assembly of the roof could commence. The flat or gabled roofs were held up by square, evenly-spaced wood beams, which carried the weight of the roof and ceiling (if one was present). In the sanctuaries it was common for beams to be decorated with painted designs. Vigas rested on wood corbels, which were built into the walls and often projected on the outside of the building. When the rafters were in place a thatch of \"tules\" (brush) was woven over them for insulation, and were in turn covered with clay tiles. The tiles were cemented to the roof with mortar, clay, or \"brea\" (tar or bitumen). At some of the missions the padres were able to hire professional stonemasons to assist them in their endeavors; in 1797, for example, master mason Isidoro Aguílar was brought in from Culiacán, Mexico to supervise the building of a stone church at San Juan Capistrano. The church, constructed mostly of sandstone, featured a vaulted ceiling and seven domes. Indians had to gather thousands of stones from miles around for this venture, transporting them in carrettas or carrying them by hand. This structure, nicknamed \"Serra's Church\" once had a l20-foot-tall bell tower that was almost totally destroyed by in 1812.\n\nArched door and window openings required the use of wood centering during erection, as did corridor arches and any type of vault or domed construction. Windows were kept small and to a minimum, and placed high on walls as a protective measure in case of Indian attack. A few of the missions had imported glass window panes, but most made do with oiled skins stretched tightly across the openings. Windows were the only source of interior illumination at the missions, other than the tallow candles made in the outposts' workshops. Doors were made of wood cut into planks at the \"carpintería\", and most often bore the Spanish \"River of Life\" pattern or other carved or painted designs. Carpenters used a ripsaw (or \"pitsaw\") to saw logs into thin boards, which were held together by ornate nails forged in the mission's blacksmith shop. Nails, especially long ones, were scarce throughout California, so large members (such as rafters or beams) which had to be fastened together were tied with rawhide strips. Connections of this type were common in post and lintel construction, such as that found over corridors. Aside from nails, blacksmiths fashioned iron gates, crosses, tools, kitchen utensils, cannons for mission defense, and other objects needed by the mission community. Settlements had to rely on cargo ships and trade for their iron supplies as they did not have the capability to mine and process iron ore.\n\nSince they were not trained in building design, the padres could only try to emulate the architectural aspects of structures they remembered from their homeland. The missions exhibit a strong Roman influence in much of their design and construction techniques (as do many buildings in Spain), particularly in arch and dome construction. At Mission Santa Barbara, founding Father Ripali even went so far as to consult the works of 1st century B.C. Roman architect Vitruvius during the design phase of the project.\n\nIn addition to the domes, vaults, and arches, and the Roman building methods used to create them, the missions inherited several architectural features from mother Spain. One of the most important design elements of a mission was its church belfry, of which there were four distinct types: the basic belfry, the \"espadaña\", the \"campanile\", and the \"campanario\". The basic belfry was merely a bell hanging from a beam which was supported by two upright posts. The belfry usually stood just to one side of the main entrance to the church. The second type, the \"espadaña\", was a raised gable at the end of a church building, usually curved and decorated; it did not always contain bells, however, but was sometimes added to the building simply to give it a more impressive facade. The \"campanile\", probably the most well-known bell support, was a large tower which held one or more bells; these were usually domed structures, and some even had lanterns atop them. The final method for hanging bells is the \"campanario\", which consists of a wall with openings for the bells. Most walls were attached to the sanctuary building, save for the one at the Pala Asistencia which is a standalone structure. The \"campanario\" is unique in that it is native to Alta California.\n\nOther notable aspects of the missions were the long arcades (\"corridors\") which flanked all interior and many exterior walls. The arches were Roman (half-round), while the pillars were usually square and made of baked brick, rather than adobe. The overhang created by the arcade had a dual function: it provided a comfortable, shady place to sit after a hard-day's work, and (more importantly) it kept rainfall away from the adobe walls. The mainstay of any mission complex was its \"capilla\" (chapel). The design of chapels overall followed that of Christian churches in Europe, but tended to be comparatively long and narrow due to the size of lumber available along the California coast. Each church had a main section (the nave), a baptistry near the front entrance, a sanctuary (where the altar was located), and a sacristy at the back of the church where materials used to celebrate Mass were stored and where the priests vested. In most churches, a stairway near the main entrance led up to a choir loft.\n\nDecorations were usually copied from books and applied by native artists. The religious designs and paintings are said to \"\"show the flavor of the Spanish Era, mixed with the primitive touch of the Indian artists\".\" The impact that mission architecture has had on the modern buildings of California is readily apparent in the many civic, commercial, and residential structures which exhibit the tile roofs, arched door and window openings, and stuccoed walls that typify the \"mission look.\" These elements are frequently included in the exterior finish of modern buildings in California and the Southwest, and are commonly referred to as Mission Revival Style architecture. The inclusion of these features in whole or part into otherwise ordinary commercial buildings has been met with varying levels of acceptance, and is regarded among some critics as \"\"mission impossible\"\", a phenomenon that is seen most brashly in the fast food emporiums of Taco Bell. When well-done, a mission style building will convey an impression of simplicity, permanence, and comfort, with coolness in the heat of the day and warmth in the cold of night (due to a phenomenon known as the thermal flywheel effect).\n\nStone aqueducts, sometimes spanning miles, brought fresh water from a river or spring to the mission site. Baked clay pipes, joined with lime mortar or bitumen, carried the water into reservoirs and gravity-fed fountains, and emptied into waterways where the force of the water would be used to turn grinding wheels, presses, and other simple machinery. Water brought to the mission proper would be used for cooking, cleaning, irrigation of crops, and drinking. Drinking water was allowed to trickle through alternate layers of sand and charcoal to remove the impurities.\n\nInfluenced by early mission furnishings, \"mission oak\" furniture bears some similarity to the related Arts and Crafts style furniture, using similar materials but without Arts and Crafts' emphasis on refinement of line and decoration. Oak is the typical material, finished with its natural golden appearance that will age to a rich medium brown color. Components such as legs will often be straight, not tapered, and surfaces will be flat, rather than curved. Generous use of materials leads to heavy and solid furnishings, giving an impression of \"groundedness\", through simplicity, functionality and stability. Straightforward lines predominate, with little or no decoration, other than that which is incidental to function, such as forged iron hinges and latches. The leading designer of furnishings in this style during the Arts and Crafts movement was Gustav Stickley.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1881003", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1881003", "title": "Phycocyanin", "text": "Phycocyanin\n\nPhycocyanin is a pigment-protein complex from the light-harvesting phycobiliprotein family, along with allophycocyanin and phycoerythrin. It is an accessory pigment to chlorophyll. All phycobiliproteins are water-soluble, so they cannot exist within the membrane like carotenoids can. Instead, phycobiliproteins aggregate to form clusters that adhere to the membrane called phycobilisomes. Phycocyanin is a characteristic light blue color, absorbing orange and red light, particularly near 620 nm (depending on which specific type it is), and emits fluorescence at about 650 nm (also depending on which type it is). Allophycocyanin absorbs and emits at longer wavelengths than phycocyanin C or phycocyanin R. Phycocyanins are found in Cyanobacteria (also called blue-green algae). Phycobiliproteins have fluorescent properties that are used in immunoassay kits. Phycocyanin is from the Greek \"phyco\" meaning “algae” and \"cyanin\" is from the English word “cyan\", which conventionally means a shade of blue-green (close to \"aqua\") and is derived from the Greek “kyanos\" which means a somewhat different color: \"dark blue\". The product phycocyanin, produced by \"Aphanizomenon flos-aquae\" and Spirulina, is for example used in the food and beverage industry as the natural coloring agent 'Lina Blue' or 'EXBERRY Shade Blue' and is found in sweets and ice cream. In addition, fluorescence detection of phycocyanin pigments in water samples is a useful method to monitor cyanobacteria biomass.\n\nThe phycobiliproteins are made of two subunits (alpha and beta) having a protein backbone to which 1-2 linear tetrapyrrole chromophores are covalently bound.\n\nC-phycocyanin is often found in cyanobacteria which thrive around hot springs, as it can be stable up to around 70 °C, with identical spectroscopic (light absorbing) behaviours at 20 and 70 °C. Thermophiles contain slightly different amino acid sequences making it stable under these higher conditions. Molecular weight is around 30,000 Da.\nStability of this protein invitro at these temperatures has been shown to be substantially lower. Photo-spectral analysis of the protein after 1 min exposure to 65 °C conditions in a purified state demonstrated a 50% loss of tertiary structure.\n\nPhycocyanin shares a common structural theme with all phycobiliproteins. The structure begins with the assembly of phycobiliprotein monomers, which are heterodimers composed of α and β subunits, and their respective chromophores linked via thioether bond.\n\nEach subunit is typically composed of eight α-helices. Monomers spontaneously aggregate to form ring-shaped trimers (αβ), which have rotational symmetry and a central channel. Trimers aggregate in pairs to form hexamers (αβ), sometimes assisted with additional linker proteins. Each phycobilisome rod generally has two or more phycocyanin hexamers. Despite the overall similarity in structure and assembly of phycobiliproteins, there is a large diversity in hexamer and rod conformations, even when only considering phycocyanins. On a larger scale phycocyanins also vary in crystal structure, although the biological relevance of this is debatable.\n\nAs an example, the structure of C-phycocyanin from \"Synechococcus vulcanus\" has been refined to 1.6 Angstrom resolution. The (αβ) monomer consists of 332 amino acids and 3 thio-linked phycocyanobilin (PCB) cofactor molecules. Both the α- and β-subunits have a PCB at amino acid 84, but the β-subunit has an additional PCB at position 155 as well. This additional PCB faces the exterior of the trimeric ring and is therefore implicated in inter-rod energy transfer in the phycobilisome complex. In addition to cofactors, there are many predictable non-covalent interactions with the surrounding solvent (water) that are hypothesized to contribute to structural stability.\n\nR-phycocyanin II (R-PC II) is found in some \"Synechococcus\" species. R-PC II is said to be the first PEB containing phycocyanin that originates in cyanobacteria. Its purified protein is composed of alpha and beta subunits in equal quantities. R-PC II has PCB at beta-84 and the phycoerythrobillin (PEB) at alpha-84 and beta-155.\n\nAs of March 7, 2018, there are 44 crystal structures of phycocyanin deposited in the Protein Data Bank.\n\nC-phycocyanin has a single absorption peak at ~621 nm, varying slightly depending on the organism and conditions such as temperature, pH, and protein concentration \"in vitro\". Its emission maximum is ~642 nm. This means that the pigment absorbs orange light, and emits reddish light. R-phycocyanin has an absorption maxima at 533 and 544 nm. The fluorescence emission maximum of R-phycocyanin is 646 nm.\nPhycocyanin is produced by many photoautotrophic cyanobacteria. Even if cyanobacteria have large concentrations of phycocyanin, productivity in the ocean is still limited due to light conditions.\n\nPhycocyanin has ecological significance in indicating cyanobacteria bloom. Normally chlorophyll \"a\" is used to indicate cyanobacteria numbers, however since it is present in a large number of phytoplankton groups, it is not an ideal measure. For instance a study in the Baltic Sea used phycocyanin as a marker for filamentous cyanobacteria during toxic summer blooms. Some filamentous organisms in the Baltic Sea include \"Nodularia spumigena\" and \"Aphanizomenon flosaquae\".\n\nAn important cyanobacteria named spirulina (\"Arthrospira plantensis\") is a micro algae that produces C-PC.\n\nThere are many different methods of phycocyanin production including photoautotrophic, mixotrophic and heterotrophic and recombinant production. Photoautotrophic production of phycocyanin is where cultures of cyanobacteria are grown in open ponds in either subtropical or tropical regions. Mixotrophic production of algae is where the algae are grown on cultures that have an organic carbon source like glucose. Using mixotrophic production produces higher growth rates and higher biomass compared to simply using a photoautotrophic culture. In the mixotrophic culture, the sum of heterotrophic and autotrophic growth separately was equal to the mixotrophic growth. Heterotrophic production of phycocyanin is not light limited, as per its definition. \"Galdieria sulphuraria\" is a unicellular rhodophyte that contains a large amount of C-PC and a small amount of allophycocyanin. \"G. sulphuraria\" is an example of the heterotrophic production of C-PC because its habitat is hot, acidic springs and uses a number of carbon sources for growth. Recombinant production of C-PC is another heterotrophic method and involves gene engineering.\n\nLichen-forming fungi and cyanobacteria often have a symbiotic relationship and thus phycocyanin markers can be used to show the ecological distribution of fungi-associated cyanobacteria. As shown in the highly specific association between Lichina species and Rivularia strains, phycocyanin has enough phylogenetic resolution to resolve the evolutionary history of the group across the northwestern Atlantic Ocean coastal margin.\n\nThe two genes cpcA and cpcB, located in the cpc operon and translated from the same mRNA transcript, encode for the C-PC α- and β-chains respectively. Additional elements such as linker proteins, and enzymes involved in phycobilin synthesis and the phycobiliproteins are often encoded by genes in adjacent gene clusters, and the cpc operon of Arthrospira platensis also encodes a linker protein assisting in the assembly of C-PC complexes. In red algae, the phycobiliprotein and linker protein genes are located on the plastid genome.\n\nPhycocyanobilin is synthesised from heme and inserted into the C-PC apo-protein by three enzymatic steps. Cyclic heme is oxidised to linear biliverdin IXα by heme oxygenase and further converted to 3Z-phycocyanobilin, the dominant phycocyanobilin isomer, by 3Z-phycocyanobilin:ferredoxin oxidoreductase. Insertion of 3Z-phycocyanobilin into the C-PC apo-protein via thioether bond formation is catalysed by phycocyanobilin lyase.\n\nThe promoter for the cpc operon is located within the 427-bp upstream region of the cpcB gene. In \"A. platensis\", 6 putative promoter sequences have been identified in the region, with four of them showing expression of green fluorescent protein when transformed into \"E. coli\". The presence of other positive elements such as light-response elements in the same region have also been demonstrated.\n\nThe multiple promoter and response element sequences in the cpc operon enable cyanobacteria and red algae to adjust its expression in response to multiple environmental conditions. Expression of the cpcA and cpcB genes is regulated by light. Low light intensities stimulate synthesis of CPC and other pigments, while pigment synthesis is repressed at high light intensities. Temperature has also been shown to affect synthesis, with specific pigment concentrations showing a clear maximum at 36 °C in Arthronema africanum, a cyanobacterium with particular high C-PC and APC contents.\n\nNitrogen and also iron limitation induce phycobiliprotein degradation. Organic carbon sources stimulate C-PC synthesis in Anabaena spp., but seem to have almost no effector negative effect in A. platensis. In the rhodophytes Cyanidium caldarium and Galdieria sulphuraria, C-PC production is repressed by glucose but stimulated by heme.\n\nPure phycocyanin extractions can be isolated from algae. The basic segregation order is as follows. The rupturing of the cell wall, with mechanical forces (freeze thawing) or chemical agents (enzymes). Then, C-PC is isolated with centrifugation and purified with ammonium sulfate precipitation or chromatography -either ion or gel-filtration. After, the sample gets frozen and dried.<br>.\n\nPhycocyanin can be used in many practices, it is particularly used medicine and foods applications. It can also be used in genetics, where it acts a tracer due to its natural fluorescence.\n\nPhycocyanin has both anti-oxidant and anti-inflammation properties. Peroxyl, hydroxyl, and alkoxyl radicals are all oxidants scavenged by C-PC. C-PC, however, has a greater effect on peroxyl radicals. C-PC is a metal binding antioxidant as it prevents lipid peroxidation from occurring. The peroxyl radicals are stabilized by the chromophore (a subunit of C-PC). For hydroxyl radicals to be scavenged, it must be done in low light and with high C-PC levels. Hydroxyl radicals are found at inflamed parts of the body. C-PC, being an anti-oxidant, scavenges these damage-inducing radicals, hence being an anti-inflammation agent.\n\nExcess oxygen in the brain generates Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS). ROS causes damages to brain neurons, leading to strokes. C-phycocyanin scavenges hydrogen peroxide, a type of ROS species, from the inside of astrocyte, reducing oxidative stress. Astrocytes also increase the production of growth factors like BDNF and NDF, therefore, enhance nerve regeneration. C-PC also prevents astrogliosis and glial inflammation.\n\nC-phycocyanin is found to have hepatotoxicity protection. Vadiraja et al. (1998) found an increase in the serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) when C-PC is treated against heptatoxins such as Carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) or R-(+)-pulegone. C-PC protects the liver by the means of the Cytochrome-P450 system. It can either disturb the production of menthofuran or disturb formation of α, β-unsaturated- γ-ketoaldehyde. Both of which are key components of the cytochrome P-450 system that produced a reactive metabolite that produce toxins when it binds to liver tissues. Another possible protection mechanism by C-PC can be the scavenging of reactive metabolites (or free radicals if the cause is CCl4).\n\nC-phycocyanin (C-PC) has anti-cancer effects. Cancer happens when cells continue to grow uncontrollably. C-PC has been found to prevent cell growth. C-PC stops the formation of tumour before the S phase. DNA synthesis is not performed due to the tumour cell entering G0, resulting in no tumour proliferation. Furthermore, C-PC induces apoptosis. When cells are treated with C-PC, ROS (Radical Oxygen Species) are made. These molecules decrease BCl-2 (regulator of apoptosis) production. Here, BCl-2 inhibits proteins called caspases. Caspases are part of the apoptosis pathway. When BCl-2 decreases, the expression of caspases increases. As a result, apoptosis occurs. C-PC alone is not enough to treat cancer, it needs to work other drugs to overcome the persistence nature of tumour cells.\n\nC-phycocyanin (C-PC) can be used as a natural blue food colouring. This food colourant can only be used for low temperature prepared goods because of its inability to maintaining its blue colouring in high heats unless there is an addition of preservatives or sugars. The type of sugar is irrelevant, C-PC is stable when there is high sugar content. Knowing so, C-PC can be used for numerous types of foods, one of which being syrups. C-PC can be used for syrups ranging from green to blue colours. It can have different green tints by adding yellow food colourings.\n\nPhycocyanin market is expected to grow in the period 2019-2028 as a phycocyanin blue pigment got approval from FDA in 2013 which has opened a lot of opportunities for this market and it is anticipated to reach a 1 Billion USD during forecast period 2019-2028.\n"}

{"id": "1881005", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1881005", "title": "Market anomaly", "text": "Market anomaly\n\nA market anomaly in a financial market is predictability that seems to be inconsistent with (typically risk-based) theories of asset prices. Standard theories include the capital asset pricing model and the Fama-French Three Factor Model, but a lack of agreement among academics about the proper theory leads many to refer to anomalies without a reference to a benchmark theory (Daniel and Hirschleifer 2015 and Barberis 2018, for example). Indeed, many academics simply refer to anomalies as \"return predictors\", avoiding the problem of defining a benchmark theory.\n\nAcademics have documented more than 150 return predictors (see \"List of Anomalies Documented in Academic Journals).\" These \"anomalies\", however, come with many caveats. Almost all documented anomalies focus on illiquid, small stocks. Moreover, the studies do not account for trading costs. As a result, many anomalies do not offer profits, despite the presence of predictability. Additionally, return predictability declines substantially after the publication of a predictor, and thus may not offer profits in the future. Finally, return predictability may be due to cross-sectional or time-variation in risk, and thus does not necessarily provide a good investment opportunity. Relatedly, return predictability by itself does not disprove the efficient market hypothesis, as one needs to show predictability over and above that implied by a particular model of risk.\n\nThe four primary explanations for market anomalies are (1) mispricing, (2) unmeasured risk, (3) limits to arbitrage, and (4) selection bias. Academics have not reached a consensus on the underlying cause, with prominent academics continuing to advocate for selection bias, mispricing, and risk-based theories.\n\nAnomalies can be broadly categorized into time-series and cross-sectional anomalies. Time-series anomalies refer to predictability in the aggregate stock market, such as the often-discussed Cyclically Adjusted Price-Earnings (CAPE) predictor. These time-series predictors indicate times in which it is better to be invested in stocks vs a safe asset (such as Treasury bills). Cross-sectional anomalies refer to the predictable out-performance of particular stocks relative to others. For example, the well-known size anomaly refers to the fact that stocks with lower market capitalization tend to out-perform stocks with higher market capitalization in the future.\n\nMany, if not most, of the papers which document anomalies attribute them to mispricing (Lakonishok, Shelifer, and Visny 1994, for example). The mispricing explanation is natural, as anomalies are by definition deviations from a benchmark theory of asset prices. \"Mispricing\" is then defined as the deviation relative to the benchmark.\n\nThe most common benchmark is the CAPM (Capital-Asset-Pricing Model). The deviation from this theory is measured by a non-zero intercept in an estimated security market line. This intercept is commonly denoted by the Greek letter alpha:\n\nformula_1\n\nwhere formula_2 is the return on the anomaly, formula_3is the return on the risk-free rate, formula_4is the slope from regressing the anomaly's return on the market's return, and formula_5is the return on the \"market\", often proxied by the return on the CRSP index (an index of all publicly traded U.S. stocks).\n\nThe mispricing explanations are often contentious within academic finance, as academics do not agree on the proper benchmark theory (see Unmeasured Risk, below). This disagreement is closely related to the \"joint-hypothesis problem\" of the efficient market hypothesis. \n\nAmong academics, a common response to claims of mispricing was the idea that the anomaly captures a dimension of risk that is missing from the benchmark theory. For example, the anomaly may generate expected returns beyond those measured using the CAPM regression because the time-series of its returns are correlated with labor income, which is not captured by standard proxies for the market return.\n\nPerhaps the most well-known example of this unmeasured risk explanation is found in Fama and French's seminar paper on their 3-factor model: \"if assets are priced rationally, variables that are related to average returns ... ..., must proxy for sensitivity to common (shared and thus undiversifiable) risk factors in returns. The [3-factor model] time-series regressions give direct evidence on this issue.\"\n\nThe unmeasured risk explanation is closely related to the shortcomings of the CAPM as a theory of risk as well as shortcomings of empirical tests of the CAPM and related models. Perhaps the most common critique of the CAPM is that it is derived in a single period setting, and thus is missing dynamic features like periods of high uncertainty. In a more general setting, the CAPM typically implies multiple risk factors, as shown in Merton's Intertemporal CAPM theory. Moreover, the ICAPM generally implies the expected returns vary over time, and thus time-series predictability is not clear evidence of mispricing. Indeed, since the CAPM cannot at all capture dynamic expected returns, evidence of time-series predictability is less often regarded as mispricing as compared to cross-sectional predictability.\n\nEmpirical shortcomings primarily regard the difficulty in measuring wealth or marginal utility. Theoretically, wealth includes not only stock market wealth, but also non-tradable wealth like private assets and future labor income. In the consumption CAPM, (which is theoretically equivalent to Merton's ICAPM), the proper proxy for wealth is consumption, which is difficult to measure (Savov 2011, for example).\n\nDespite the theoretical soundness of the unmeasured risk explanation, there is little consensus among academics about the proper risk model over and above the CAPM. Propositions include the well-known Fama-French 3-Factor Model, Fama-French-Carhart 4-factor model, Fama-French 5-factor model, and Stambaugh and Yuan's 4-factor model. These models are all empirically-oriented, rather than derived from a formal theory of equilibrium like Merton's ICAPM.\n\nAnomalies are almost always documented using closing prices from the CRSP dataset. These prices do not reflect trading costs, which can prevent arbitrage and thus the elimination predictability. Moreover, almost all anomalies are documented using equally-weighted portfolios, and thus require trading of illiquid (costly-to-trade) stocks.\n\nThe limits to arbitrage explanation can be thought of as a refinement of the mispricing framework. A return pattern only offers profits if the returns it offers survives trading costs, and thus should not be considered mispricing unless trading costs are accounted for.\n\nA large literature documents that trading costs greatly reduce anomaly returns. This literature goes back to Stoll and Whaley (1983) and Ball, Kothari, and Shanken (1995). A recent paper that studies dozens of anomalies finds that trading costs have a massive effect on the average anomaly (Novy-Marx and Velikov 2015).\n\nThe documented anomalies are likely the best performers from a much larger set of potential return predictors. This selection creates a bias and implies that estimates of the profitability of anomalies is overstated. This explanation for anomalies is also known as data snooping, p-hacking, data mining, and data dredging, and is closely related to the multiple comparisons problem. Concerns about selection bias in anomalies goes back at least to Jensen and Bennington (1970). \n\nMost research on selection bias in market anomalies focuses on particular subsets of predictors. For example, Sullivan, Timmermann, and White (2001) show that calendar-based anomalies are no longer significant after adjusting for selection bias. A recent meta-analysis of the size premium shows that the reported estimates of the size premium are exaggerated twofold because of selection bias .\n\nResearch on selection bias for anomalies more generally is relatively limited and inconclusive. McLean and Pontiff (2016) use an out-of-sample test to show that selection bias accounts for at most 26% of the typical anomaly's mean return during the sample period of the original publication. To show this, they replicate almost 100 anomalies, and show that the average anomaly's return is only 26% smaller in the few years immediately after the end of the original samples. As some of this decline may be due to investor learning effects, the 26% is an upper bound. In contrast, Harvey, Liu, and Zhu (2016) adapt multiple testing adjustments from statistics such as the False Discovery Rate to asset pricing \"factors\". They refer to a factor as any variable that helps explain the cross-section of expected returns, and thus include many anomalies in their study. They find that multiple-testing statistics imply that factors with t-stats < 3.0 should not be considered statistically significant, and conclude that most published findings are likely false.\n\n"}

The film was based on a 1979 novel of the same name by Peter Benchley who also wrote the screenplay. It is about a savage group of pirates, made up of outcasts, thieves, and murderers, who are hidden from the outside world by an uncharted Caribbean island, and who have raided boats to sustain themselves, since the 18th century.\n\nBlair Maynard is a British-born American journalist who was once in the Navy and who decides to investigate the mystery of why so many boats disappear in the Bermuda Triangle of the Caribbean. He takes his estranged son Justin with him to the area on the \"vacation\" and, while fishing, both are attacked by an unkempt man and forcibly brought to an uncharted island. On the island, Blair discovers that the inhabitants of the island are a centuries-old colony of savage French pirates.\n\nThe group has been living on the island for centuries, unseen by society, and sustain themselves by raiding pleasure boats. The pirates kill whoever comes to the island; however, Blair and his son are both kept alive due to a false assumption regarding their lineage and a need to offset the negative effects of inbreeding. Blair is used to impregnate a female and act as a scribe for the largely illiterate group, while Justin is brainwashed to become a surrogate heir to Nau, the pirate leader. Blair struggles to escape from the island, but all attempts fail.\n\nBlair begins his captivity as a very peaceable and civilized everyman, but he is helpless in the absence of law and the presence of the almost unlimited violence the pirates commit. Subjecting him to constant fear and abuse, the pirates fail to realize how desperate Blair is becoming as his repeated escape attempts continually fail. He eventually arranges for the pirates to come head to head with a US Coast Guard ship, but they manage to wipe out the crew and take over the vessel. Blair sneaks aboard and, while most of the pirates are gathered on the aft deck of the ship, he discovers a deck-mounted M2 Machine Gun hidden underneath a tarp. He opens fire on the pirates, and continues to fire even after they are all dead.\n\nHe then learns that Nau was not on the deck. The two men then stalk each other through various parts of the decimated vessel. Blair eventually gets the upper hand and kills Nau with a flare gun. Blair and his son, who no longer desires to be a pirate and seems much more respectful of his father, are reunited.\n\n\nBenchley was paid $1.25 million for film rights to the novel and a first draft screenplay.\n\nThe United States Coast Guard cutter \"Dauntless\" stands in for the fictitious USCGC \"New Hope\" in the movie.\n\nAustralian Angela Punch McGregor was cast after Michael Ritchie saw her in \"Newsfront\".\n\nThe film was mostly shot on the islands of Antigua and Abaco.\n\nDavid Brown said the budget was $12 million plus 25% overhead but other reports put it over $20 million.\n\nOn July 27, 2011, Universal Studios Home Entertainment released the film on DVD as part of its Universal Vault Series as an Amazon exclusive.

The pageant was no longer exist until 1980 because all the three major titles has their own organisation. In 1960 until 1962, Miss Malaysia was wearing \"Miss Malaya\" sashes in Miss Universe and Miss International.

In 1984, Jennifer was appointed from Miss Malaysia Universe 1983. Malaysia did not present in the 90s due to lack of sponsorship to send the delegates until in 1999, a new organisation took the license for the Miss International pageant. It called Miss Global International Malaysia.\n\nAnother separate contest called Miss Malaysia Earth selects winners to Miss Earth.\nIn Malaysia, female Muslims were denied participation in beauty pageants following the issue of a fatwa in 1996 by the Mufti of Selangor, Ishak Baharom. The issue came to a nasty twist in July - September 1997 when four Malay participants joined the Miss Malaysian petite contest, only to be arrested by the authorities. In the ensuing public outcry and debate that followed, the effectiveness of the fatwa was shown given the influence of the Selangor's Mufti over the nation's sharia law. The fatwa resonated with the ideology that Muslim women should cover up private parts of their body, or Aurat of which the beauty pageants' practices ran contrary to - even though such religious enactments also apply to male pageants.\n\nIn Kuala Lumpur on 21 July 2013, the organisers of Miss Malaysia World 2013 were forced to drop four of its Muslim finalists following a fatwa prohibiting Muslim women from joining beauty pageants. According to Wan Zahidi, the fatwa prohibiting Muslim women from joining beauty pageants was issued and gazetted under the Federal Territories Islamic Administration Act in February 1996.\n\nIn recent years, the National Fatwa Council, the country's highest Islamic body, had also issued rulings forbidding Muslims from using Botox and banned women from exhibiting tomboy behaviour, which it defined as behaving or dressing like men or taking part in lesbian sex.\n\nThe council came under heavy scrutiny for its proposal to ban yoga after a university lecturer advised people to stop practising it for fear that it could deviate from the teachings of Islam. The move was met with protests from progressive Muslim women's groups like Sisters in Islam who deemed the fatwas regressive while observers claimed it highlighted the worrying trend of overt Islamisation in Malaysia.\n\nThe four contestants are:\nNevertheless, a public outcry ensued, as members of the public questioned the way the religious authorities handled the matter as well as the abrupt ruling which came about – Muslim women in the past had participated in beauty pageants without much protest amongst the religious authorities. This invoked the concerns of Mahathir's who had raised objections to the way the religious authorities had implemented and enforced the law – and questions including distinctions on religious laws and personal freedom were raised. Nevertheless, the fatwa ruling has since been very effective; Muslim women have since then been deterred from joining any beauty pageants. Malaysian beauty pageants, in compliance with the law, similarly denied Muslim individuals from participating. However, Muslim women may still join smaller scale beauty pageant contests such as Dewi Remaja, Miss Intercontinental, and Miss Tourism, provided that they don't display publicly wearing swimsuits.\n\n\n31. ^ http://www.pageantopolis.com\n\n"}
{"id": "1881021", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1881021", "title": "Indirect rule", "text": "Indirect rule\n\nIndirect rule was a system of governance used by the British and French to control parts of their colonial empires, particularly in Africa and Asia, through pre-existing indigenous power structures. These dependencies were often called \"protectorates\" or \"trucial states\". By this system, the day-to-day government and administration of areas both small and large were left in the hands of traditional rulers, who gained prestige and the stability and protection afforded by the Pax Britannica (in the case of British territories), at the cost of losing control of their external affairs, and often of taxation, communications, and other matters, usually with a small number of European \"advisors\" effectively overseeing the government of large numbers of people spread over extensive areas.\n\nSome British colonies were ruled directly by the Colonial Office in London, while others were ruled indirectly through local rulers who are supervised behind the scenes by British advisors. In 1890 Zanzibar became a protectorate (not a colony) of Britain. Prime minister Salisbury explained his position:\n\nThe Princely States of India were ruled indirectly. So too was much of the West African holdings.\n\nThe ideological underpinnings, as well as the practical application, of \"indirect rule\" in Uganda and Nigeria is usually traced to the work of Frederick Lugard, the High Commissioner of the Protectorate of Northern Nigeria from 1899 to 1906.\nIndirect rule was by no means a new idea at the time, for it had been in use in ruling empires throughout history. For instance, in addition to India and Uganda, it had been practiced in the Songhai and Ashanti empires.\n\nIn the lands of the Sokoto Caliphate, conquered by the British Empire at the turn of the century, Lugard instituted a system whereby external, military, and tax control was operated by the British, while most every other aspect of life was left to local pre-British aristocracies who may have sided with the British during or after their conquest. The theory behind this solution to a very practical problem (a problem referred to as 'The Native Problem' by Mahmood Mamdani in his work Citizen and Subject) of domination by a tiny group of foreigners of huge populations is laid out in Lugard's influential work, \"The Dual Mandate in British Tropical Africa\". Lugard copied the numerous empires before his time who had created and developed the indirect rule system. he is only noted for the ruling system because he first published a book about this system of administration called “The Dual Mandate in Tropical Africa,”\n\nAccording to the British, Indirect Rule was a political doctrine which held that the Europeans and Africans were culturally different to this extent, Africans had to be ruled through the Africans own institution.\nTo achieve this objective:\n\nIt has been pointed out that the British were not prepared to pay for colonial administration, though interested in exploiting the colonies; neither had got enough resources to finance it. This economic question coupled with the shortage of or lack of White personnel in Africa at the time convinced the British that it would be cheaper to use the traditional institutions to achieve the same objective. The nature and operation of Indirect rule in Northern Nigerian, amply confirm these contentions. \nWhen Lord Lugard conquered the Sokoto Caliphate of Northern Nigeria, in early twentieth century, his limited resources in terms of men and money, made it impracticable for him to rule that vast territory.\nFortunately for him, however, the Sokoto Caliphate already possessed a highly developed and efficient system of administration headed by emirs, with the Sultan of Sokoto as the supreme head. The hierarchical nature of the political structure was ideal for Indirect Rule because the British could control the emirs and the emirs in turn could control their people.\n\nThe largest application of Indirect rule was in British Asia, in hundreds of pre-colonial states, first seen at work under the East India Company's system of subsidiary alliances in the Indian subcontinent. The areas thus brought into the British sphere of influence became known as the Indian Princely States. Subsequently, the same principle was applied in strategic regions on the sea routes to India, especially in the Persian Gulf protected states.\n\nIn the British colonies, the laws were typically made by a British Governor and legislative council, but in the protectorates and princely states local rulers retained their traditional administrative authority and ability to legislate, subject to British control of certain areas. Indirect rule was particularly effective in enabling the British to exploit natural resources and raw materials of vast subordinate nations. The establishment of naval and military bases in strategic points around the globe maintained the necessary power to underpin such control.\n\nIndirect rule was cheaper and easier for the European powers and, in particular, it required fewer administrators, but had a number of problems. In many cases, European authorities empowered local traditional leaders, as in the case of the monarchy of Uganda, but if no suitable leader could be found (in the traditional Western sense of the term), the Europeans would simply choose local rulers to suit them. This was the case in Kenya and Southern Nigeria, and the new leaders, often called \"warrant chiefs\", were not always supported by the local population. The European ruling classes also often chose local leaders with similar traits to their own, despite these traits not being suited to native leadership. Many were conservative elders, and thus indirect rule fostered a conservative outlook among the indigenous population and marginalised the young intelligentsia. Written laws, which replaced oral laws, were less flexible to the changing social nature, old customs of retribution and justice were removed or banned, and the removal of more violent punishments in some areas led to an increase in crime. Furthermore, leaders empowered by the governments of European powers were often not familiar with their new tasks, such as recruitment and tax.\n\nFrom the early 20th century, French and British writers helped establish a dichotomy between British Indirect rule, exemplified by the Indian princely states and by Lord Lugard's writings on the administration of northern Nigeria, and French colonial direct rule. As with British theorists, French colonial officials like Félix Eboué or Robert Delavignette wrote and argued throughout the first half of the 20th century for a distinct French style of rule that was centralized, uniform, and aimed at assimilating colonial subjects into the French polity. French rule, sometimes labeled \"Jacobin\", was said in these writings to be based on the twin ideologies of the centralized unitary French government of the Metropole, with the French colonial ideology of Assimilation. Colonial Assimilation argued that French law and citizenship was based on universal values that came from the French Revolution. Mirroring French domestic citizenship law, French colonial law allowed for anyone who could prove themselves culturally French (the \"Évolués\") to become equal French citizens. In French West Africa, only parts of the Senegalese \"Four Communes\" ever extended French citizenship outside a few educated African elite. This was contrasted with British Indirect Rule, which never foresaw subject Protectorates becoming legally assimilated into \"the home nations\".\n\nWhile making more subtle distinctions, this model of direct versus indirect rule was dominant in academia from the 1930s until the 1970s.\n\nAcademics since the 1970s have problematised the Direct versus Indirect Rule dichotomy, arguing the systems were in practice intermingled in both British and French colonial governance, and that the perception of indirect rule was sometimes promoted to justify quite direct rule structures.\n\nMahmood Mamdani and other academics have discussed extensively how both Direct and Indirect rule were attempts to implement identical goals of foreign rule, but how the \"Indirect\" strategy helped to create ethnic and racial cleavages within ruled societies which persist in hostile communal relations and dysfunctional strategies of government. Mamdani himself famously described indirect rule as \"decentralised despotism\".\n\nSome political scientists have even expanded the debate on how direct versus indirect rule experiences continue to affect contemporary governance into how governments which have never experienced colonialism rule.\n\n\nIndirect Rule in Nigeria\nOldNaija\n\n"}

The Promenade's roots date back to the 1960s when three blocks of Third Street were converted into a pedestrian mall. Although successful, by the late 1970s, the Santa Monica Mall (as it was then called), was in need of modernization and a redesign. A new enclosed shopping center, Santa Monica Place (1980–2007), designed by Frank Gehry was added at the Promenade's southern end. A citywide bond measure was issued and architectural firm ROMA Design Group was hired to redesign Santa Monica Mall. The renamed Third Street Promenade opened on September 16, 1989. The project was part of a larger redevelopment effort, encompassing several blocks of Downtown Santa Monica. Santa Monica Place has since been renovated into a new open-air shopping and dining venue that re-opened on August 6, 2010.\n\nStreet performers and entertainers are a frequent sight on the street.

Two prototypes were made in 1992, which differ in the barrel locking system: Model A01 used a rotary-locking system and Model B01 using conventional, Browning-type tilting barrel locking. B01 was the only one to complete testing but the development was temporarily halted due to the military cutting off funding. Financed by WITU and Prexer company, the project continued and in 1994 a new prototype was developed. Called WIST-94 it is based on the B01 prototype. The new pistol was chosen by the Polish military as its new standard sidearm.\n\nThe WIST-94 is a semi-automatic pistol chambered for 9mm Parabellum round. It uses the Browning cam-lug system of operation. The polygonal-rifled barrel is locked to the slide by three locking lugs machined into the upper part of the barrel. The frame is made from polymer plastic while the slide is constructed from steel. The trigger mechanism is similar to the one used in Glock pistols: striker-fired double-action-only. After racking the slide back and after each shot fired the striker is held semi-cocked allowing for lighter trigger pull than conventional double-action. The only safety used is an internal automatic firing pin safety that unlocks the firing pin only in the final stages of the trigger pull. The WIST-94 is fed by a 16-round magazine. The magazine release catch is reversible for use by left-handed shooters. The slide release lever is located at the left side of the gun. The sights are fixed and have self-luminous tritium inserts for low-light situations. The WIST-94L is also equipped with a laser sight mounted in the upper part of trigger guard.

In humans and many other animals, photopic vision allows color perception, mediated by cone cells, and a significantly higher visual acuity and temporal resolution than available with scotopic vision.\n\nThe human eye uses three types of cones to sense light in three bands of color. The biological pigments of the cones have maximum absorption values at wavelengths of about 420 nm (blue), 534 nm (bluish-green), and 564 nm (yellowish-green). Their sensitivity ranges overlap to provide vision throughout the visible spectrum. The maximum efficacy is 683 lm/W at a wavelength of 555 nm (green). By definition, light at a frequency of hertz has a luminous efficacy of 683 lm/W.\n\nThe wavelengths for when a person is in photopic vary with the intensity of light. For the blue-green region (500 nm), 50% of the light reaches the image point of the retina.\n\nAdaptation is much faster under photopic vision; it can occur in 5 minutes for photopic vision but it can take 30 minutes to transition from photopic to scotopic.\n\nMost older adults lose photopic spatial contrast sensitivity. Adults in their 70s require about three times more contrast to detect high spatial frequencies than adults in their 20s.\n\nThe human eye uses scotopic vision under low-light conditions (luminance level 10 to 10 cd/m), and mesopic vision in intermediate conditions (luminance level 10 to 10 cd/m).\n\n"}

The term comes from Greek \"skotos\", meaning \"darkness\", and \"-opia\", meaning \"a condition of sight\". In the human eye, cone cells are nonfunctional in low visible light. Scotopic vision is produced exclusively through rod cells, which are most sensitive to wavelengths of around 498 nm (green–blue) and are insensitive to wavelengths longer than about 640 nm (reddish orange). This condition is called the Purkinje effect.\n\nScotopic vision is dominated by retina amacrine cells, specifically AII-amacrine cells. AII-amacrine cells capture rod bipolar cell input and redistribute it to cone bipolar cells since rod-driven bipolar cells do not synapse on ganglion cells.\n\nScotopic vision occurs at luminance levels of 10 to 10 cd/m. Other species are not universally color blind in low-light conditions. The elephant hawk-moth (\"Deilephila elpenor\") displays advanced color discrimination even in dim starlight.\n\nMesopic vision occurs in intermediate lighting conditions (luminance level 10 to 10 cd/m) and is effectively a combination of scotopic and photopic vision. This gives inaccurate visual acuity and color discrimination.\n\nIn normal light (luminance level 10 to 10 cd/m), the vision of cone cells dominates and is photopic vision. There is good visual acuity (VA) and color discrimination.\n\nIn scientific literature, one occasionally encounters the term \"scotopic lux\" which corresponds to photopic lux, but uses instead the scotopic visibility weighting function.\n\nThe normal human observer's relative wavelength sensitivity will not change due to background illumination change under scotopic vision. The wavelength sensitivity is determined by the rhodopsin photopigment. This is a red pigment seen at the back of the eye in animals that have a white background to their eye called Tapetum lucidum. The pigment is not noticeable under photopic and mesopic conditions. The principle that the wavelength sensitivity does not change during scotopic vision led to the ability to detect two functional cone classes in individuals. If two cone classes are present, then their relative sensitivity will change the behavioral wavelength sensitivity. Therefore, experimentation can determine “the presence of two cone classes by measuring wavelength sensitivity on two different backgrounds and noting a change in the observer’s relative wavelength sensitivity.”\nFor adaption to occur at very low levels, the human eye needs to have a large sample of light across the signal in order to get a reliable image. This leads to the human eye being unable to resolve high spatial frequencies in low light since the observer is spatially averaging the light signal.\n\nThe behavior of the rhodopsin photopigment explains why the human eye cannot resolve lights with different spectral power distributions under low light. The reaction of this single photopigment will give the same quanta for 400 nm light and 700 nm light. Therefore, this photopigment only maps the rate of absorption and does not encode information about the relative spectral composition of the light.\n\nThe maximum scotopic efficacy is 1700 lm/W at 507 nm (compared with 683 lm/W at 555 nm for maximum photopic efficacy). While the ratio between scotopic and photopic efficacies is only around 2.5 counted at peak sensitivity the ratio increases strongly below 500 nm.\n\nAnother reason that vision is poor under scotopic vision is that rods, which are the only cells active under scotopic vision, converge to a smaller number of neurons in the retina. This many-to-one ratio leads to poor spatial frequency sensitivity.\n\n"}

{"id": "1881082", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1881082", "title": "Mitsunobu reaction", "text": "Mitsunobu reaction\n\nThe Mitsunobu reaction is an organic reaction that converts an alcohol into a variety of functional groups, such as an ester, using triphenylphosphine and an azodicarboxylate such as diethyl azodicarboxylate (DEAD) or diisopropyl azodicarboxylate (DIAD). Although DEAD and DIAD are most commonly used, there are a variety of other azodicarboxylates available which facilitate an easier workup and/or purification and in some cases, facilitate the use of more basic nucleophiles. It was discovered by Oyo Mitsunobu (1934–2003). Typical protocol is to add the phosphine and azodicarboxylate together at -10C, typically in THF of toluene, until a white precipitate forms. This white, cloudy suspension is the ylide. Then a solution of the nucleophile and alcohol are added together and reaction can, and in many cases is, heated to reflux. The alcohol reacts with the phosphine to create a good leaving group then undergoes an inversion of stereochemistry in classic SN2 fashion as the nucleophile displaces it. A common side-product (or byproduct) is produced when the azodicarboxylate displaces the leaving group instead of the desired nucleophile. This happens if the nucleophile is not acidic enough (less than 13 pKa) or is not nucleophilic enough due to steric or electronic constraints. A variation of this reaction utilizing a nitrogen nucleophile is known as a Fukuyama-Mitsunobu. \n\nSeveral reviews have been published.\n\nThe reaction mechanism of the Mitsunobu reaction is fairly complex. The identity of intermediates and the roles they play has been the subject of debate.\n\nInitially, the triphenyl phosphine (2) makes a nucleophilic attack upon diethyl azodicarboxylate (1) producing a betaine intermediate 3, which deprotonates the carboxylic acid (4) to form the ion pair 5. DEAD itself deprotonates the alcohol (6) forming an alkoxide that can form the key oxyphosphonium ion 8. The ratio and interconversion of intermediates 8–11 depend on the carboxylic acid pKa and the solvent polarity. Although several phosphorus intermediates are present, the attack of the carboxylate anion upon intermediate 8 is the only productive pathway forming the desired product 12 and triphenylphosphine oxide (13).\n\nHughes \"et al.\" have found that the formation of the ion pair 5 is very fast. The formation of the oxyphosphonium intermediate 8 is slow and facilitated by the alkoxide. Therefore, the overall rate of reaction is controlled by carboxylate basicity and solvation.\n\nThe order of addition of the reagents of the Mitsunobu reaction can be important. Typically, one dissolves the alcohol, the carboxylic acid, and triphenylphosphine in tetrahydrofuran or other suitable solvent (e.g. diethyl ether), cool to 0 °C using an ice-bath, slowly add the DEAD dissolved in THF, then stir at room temperature for several hours. If this is unsuccessful, then preforming the betaine may give better results. To preform the betaine, add DEAD to triphenylphosphine in tetrahydrofuran at 0 °C, followed by the addition of the alcohol and finally the acid.\n\nMany other functional groups can serve as nucleophiles besides carboxylic acids. For the reaction to be successful, the nucleophile must have a pKa less than 15.\n\nSeveral modifications to the original reagent combination have been developed in order to simplify the separation of the product and avoid production of so much chemical waste. One variation of the Mitsunobu Reaction uses resin-bound triphenylphoshine and uses di-\"tert\"-butylazodicarboxylate instead of DEAD. The oxidized triphenylphosphine resin can be removed by filtration, and the di-\"tert\"-butylazodicarboxylate byproduct is removed by treatment with trifluoroacetic acid. Bruce H. Lipshutz has developed an alternative to DEAD, Di-(4-chlorobenzyl)azodicarboxylate (DCAD) where the hydrazine by-product can be easily removed by filtration and recycled back to DCAD.\n\nA modification has also been reported in which DEAD can be used in catalytic versus stoichiometric quantities, however this procedure requires the use of stoichiometric (diacetoxyiodo)benzene to oxidise the hydrazine by-product back to DEAD.\n\nDenton and co-workers have reported a redox-neutral variant of the Mitsunobu reaction which employs a phosphorus(III) catalyst to activate the substrate, ensuring inversion in the nucleophilic attack, and uses a Dean-Stark trap to remove the water by-product.\n\nTsunoda \"et al.\" have shown that one can combine the triphenylphosphine and the diethyl azodicarboxylate into one reagent: a phosphorane ylide. Both (cyanomethylene)trimethylphosphorane (CMMP, R = Me) and (cyanomethylene)tributylphosphorane (CMBP, R = Bu) have proven particularly effective.\n\nThe ylide acts as both the reducing agent and the base. The byproducts are acetonitrile (6) and the trialkylphosphine oxide (8).\n\nThe Mitsunobu reaction has been applied in the synthesis of aryl ethers:\n\nWith these particular reactants the conversion with DEAD fails because the hydroxyl group is only weakly acidic. Instead the related \"1,1'-(azodicarbonyl)dipiperidine\" (ADDP) is used of which the betaine intermediate is a stronger base. The phosphine is a polymer-supported triphenylphosphine (PS-PPh).\n\nThe reaction has been used to synthesize quinine, colchicine, sarain, morphine, stigmatellin, eudistomin, oseltamivir, strychnine, and nupharamine.\n\n"}

In order to carry out this work, historical ecologists synthesize long-series data collected by practitioners in diverse fields. Rather than concentrating on one specific event, historical ecology aims to study and understand this interaction across both time and space in order to gain a full understanding of its cumulative effects. Through this interplay, humans adapt to \"and\" shape the environment, continuously contributing to landscape transformation. Historical ecologists recognize that humans have had world-wide influences, impact landscape in dissimilar ways which increase or decrease species diversity, and that a holistic perspective is critical to be able to understand that system.\n\nPiecing together landscapes requires a sometimes difficult union between natural and social sciences, close attention to geographic and temporal scales, a knowledge of the range of human ecological complexity, and the presentation of findings in a way that is useful to researchers in many fields. Those tasks require theory and methods drawn from geography, biology, ecology, history, sociology, anthropology, and other disciplines. Common methods include historical research, climatological reconstructions, plant and animal surveys, archaeological excavations, ethnographic interviews, and landscape reconstructions.\n\nThe discipline has several sites of origins by researchers who shared a common interest in the problem of ecology and history, but with a diversity of approaches. Edward Smith Deevey, Jr. used the term in the 1960s to describe a methodology that had been in long development. Deevey wished to bring together the practices of \"general ecology\" which was studied in an experimental laboratory, with a \"historical ecology\" which relied on evidence collected through fieldwork. For example, Deevey used radiocarbon dating to reconcile biologists’ successions of plants and animals with the sequences of material culture and sites discovered by archaeologists.\n\nIn the 1980s, members of the history department at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock organized a lecture series entitled \"Historical Ecology: Essays on Environment and Social Change\" The authors noted the public’s concerns with pollution and dwindling natural resources, and they began a dialogue between researchers with specialties which spanned the social sciences. The papers highlighted the importance of understanding social and political structures, personal identities, perceptions of nature, and the multiplicity of solutions for environmental problems.\n\nThe emergence of historical ecology as a coherent discipline was driven by a number of long-term research projects in historical ecology of tropical, temperate and arctic environments:\n\nE.S. Deevey's Historical Ecology of the Maya Project (1973-1984) was carried out by archaeologists and biologists who combined data from lake sediments, settlement patterns, and material from excavations in the central Petén District of Guatemala to refute the hypotheses that a collapse of Mayan urban areas was instigated by faltering food production.\n\nCarole L. Crumley's Burgundian Landscape Project (1974–present) is carried out by a multidisciplinary research team aimed at identifying the multiple factors which have contributed to the long-term durability of the agricultural economy of Burgundy, France.\n\nThomas H. McGovern's Inuit-Norse Project (1976–present) uses archaeology, environmental reconstruction, and textual analysis to examine the changing ecology of Nordic colonizers and indigenous peoples in Greenland, Iceland, Faeroes, and Shetland.\n\nIn recent years the approaches to historical ecology have been expanded to include coastal and marine environments:\n\nStellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary Project (1984–present) examines Massachusetts, USA cod fishing in the 17th through 19th centuries through historical records.\n\nFlorida Keys Coral Reef Eco-region Project (1990–present) researchers at the Scripps Institute of Oceanography are examining archival records including natural history descriptions, maps and charts, family and personal papers, and state and colonial records in order to understand the impact of over-fishing and habitat loss in the Florida Keys, USA which contains the third largest coral reef in the world.\n\nMonterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary Historical Ecology (2008–present) seeks to collect relevant historical data on fishing, whaling, and trade of the furs of aquatic animals in order form a baseline for environmental restorations of the California, USA coast.\n\nHistorical ecology is interdisciplinary in principle; at the same time, it borrows heavily from the rich intellectual history of environmental anthropology. Western scholars have known since the time of Plato that the history of environmental changes cannot be separated from human history. Several ideas have been used to describe human interaction with the environment, the first of which is the concept of the Great Chain of Being, or inherent design in nature. In this, all forms of life are ordered, with Humanity as the highest being, due to its knowledge and ability to modify nature. This lends to the concept of another nature, a manmade nature, which involves design or modification by humans, as opposed to design inherent in nature.\n\nInterest in environmental transformation continued to increase in the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries, resulting in a series of new intellectual approaches. One of these approaches was environmental determinism, developed by geographer Friedrich Ratzel. This view held that it is not social conditions, but environmental conditions, which determine the culture of a population. Ratzsel also viewed humans as restricted by nature, for their behaviors are limited to and defined by their environment. A later approach was the historical viewpoint of Franz Boas which refuted environmental determinism, claiming that it is not nature, but specifics of history, that shape human cultures. This approach recognized that although the environment may place limitations on societies, every environment will impact each culture differently. Julian Steward's cultural ecology is considered a fusion of environmental determinism and Boas' historical approach. Steward felt it was neither nature nor culture that had the most impact on a population, but instead, the mode of subsistence used in a given environment.\n\nAnthropologist Roy Rappaport introduced the field of ecological anthropology in a deliberate attempt to move away from cultural ecology. Studies in ecological anthropology borrow heavily from the natural sciences, in particular, the concept of the ecosystem from systems ecology. In this approach, also called systems theory, ecosystems are seen as self-regulating, and as returning to a state of equilibrium. This theory views human populations as static and as acting in harmony with the environment.\n\nThe revisions of anthropologist Eric Wolf and others are especially pertinent to the development of historical ecology. These revisions and related critiques of environmental anthropology undertook to take into account the temporal and spatial dimensions of history and cultures, rather than continuing to view populations as static. These critiques led to the development of historical ecology by revealing the need to consider the historical, cultural, and evolutionary nature of landscapes and societies. Thus, historical ecology as a research program developed to allow for the examination of all types of societies, simple or complex, and their interactions with the environment over space and time.\n\nIn historical ecology, the landscape is defined as an area of interaction between human culture and the non-human environment. The landscape is a perpetually changing, physical manifestation of history. Historical ecology revises the notion of the ecosystem and replaces it with the landscape. While an ecosystem is static and cyclic, a landscape is historical. While the ecosystem concept views the environment as always trying to return to a state of equilibrium, the landscape concept considers \"landscape transformation\" to be a process of evolution. Landscapes do not return to a state of equilibrium, but are palimpsests of successive disturbances over time. The use of \"landscape\" instead of \"ecosystem\" as the core unit of analysis lies at the heart of historical ecology.\nVarious individuals and schools of thought have informed the idea of the landscape as historical ecologists conceive of it. The Old English words \"landskift\", \"landscipe\" or \"landscaef\" refer to environments that have been altered by humans. As this etymology demonstrates, landscapes have been conceived of as related to human culture since at least the 5th century CE. Cultural and historical geographers have had a more recent influence. They adopted this idea from nineteenth-century German architects, gardeners, and landscape painters in Europe, Australia, and North America. Landscapes are not only physical objects, but also \"forms of knowledge\". Landscapes have cultural meanings, for example, the sacredness in many cultures of burial grounds. This recognition of landscapes as forms of knowledge is central to historical ecology, which studies landscapes from an anthropocentric perspective.\n\nThe idea of the cultural landscape is directly attributed to American geographer Carl Sauer. Sauer's theories developed as a critique of environmental determinism, which was a popular theory in the early twentieth century. Sauer's pioneering 1925 paper \"The Morphology of Landscape\" is now fundamental to many disciplines and defines the domain. In this, the term landscape is used in a geographical sense to mean an arbitrarily selected section of reality; morphology means the conceptual and methodological processes for altering it. Hence to Sauer, wherever humans lived and impacted the environment, landscapes with determinate histories resulted.\n\nThe perception of the landscape in historical ecology differs from other disciplines, such as landscape ecology. Landscape ecologists often attribute the depletion of biodiversity to human disturbance. Historical ecologists recognize that this is not always true. These changes are due to multiple factors that contribute to the ever-changing landscape. Landscape ecology still focuses on areas defined as ecosystems. In this, the ecosystem perpetually returns to a state of equilibrium. In contrast, historical ecologists view the landscape as perpetually changing. Landscape ecologists view noncyclical human events and natural disasters as external influences, while historical ecologists view disturbances as an integral part of the landscape's history. It is this integration of the concept of disturbance and history that allows for landscape to be viewed as palimpsests, representing successive layers of change, rather than as static entities.\n\nHistorical ecologists recognize that landscapes undergo continuous alteration over time and these modifications are part of that landscape's history. Historical ecology recognizes that there is a primary and a secondary succession that occurs in the landscape. These successions should be understood without a preconceived bias against humanity. Landscape transformations are ecological successions driven by human impacts. Primary landscape transformations occur when human activity results in a complete turnover of species and major substrate modifications in certain habitats while secondary landscape transformations involve human-induced changes in species proportions. The stages of landscape transformation demonstrate the history of a landscape. These stages can be brought on by humans or natural causes. Parts of the Amazon rainforest exhibit different stages of landscape transformation such as the impact of indigenous slash-and-burn horticulture on plant species compositions. Such landscape transformation does not inherently reduce biodiversity or harm the environment. There are many cases in which human-mediated disturbance increases biodiversity as landscapes transform over time.\n\nHistorical ecology challenges the very notion of a pristine landscape, such as virgin rainforests. The idea that the landscape of the New World was uninhabited and unchanged by those groups that did inhabit it was fundamental to the justifications of colonialism. Thus, perceptions of landscape have profound consequences on the histories of societies and their interactions with the environment. All landscapes have been altered by various organisms and mechanisms prior to human existence on Earth. Humans have always transformed the landscapes they inhabit, however, and today there are no landscapes on Earth that have not been affected by humans in some way.\n\nHuman alterations have occurred in different phases, including the period prior to industrialization. These changes have been studied through the archeological record of modern humans and their history. The evidence that classless societies, like foragers and trekkers, were able to change a landscape was a breakthrough in historical ecology and anthropology as a whole. Using an approach that combines history, ecology, and anthropology, a landscape's history can be observed and deduced through the traces of the various mechanisms that have altered it, anthropogenic or otherwise. Understanding the unique nature of every landscape, in addition to relations among landscapes, and the forms which comprise the landscape, is key to understanding historical ecology.\n\n\"Homo sapiens\" have interacted with the environment throughout history, generating a long-lasting influence on landscapes worldwide. Humans sometimes actively change their landscapes, while at other times their actions alter landscapes through secondary effects. These changes are called human-mediated disturbances, and are effected through various mechanisms. These mechanisms vary; they may be detrimental in some cases, but advantageous in others.\n\nBoth destructive and at times constructive, anthropogenic fire is the most immediately visible human-mediated disturbance, and without it, many landscapes would become denatured. Humans have practiced controlled burns of forests globally for thousands of years, shaping landscapes in order to better fit their needs. They burned vegetation and forests to create space for crops, sometimes resulting in higher levels of species diversity. Today, in the absence of indigenous populations who once practiced controlled burns (most notably in North America and Australia), naturally ignited wildfires have increased. In addition, there has been destabilization of \"ecosystem after ecosystem, and there is good documentation to suggest fire exclusion by Europeans has led to floral and faunal extinctions.\"\n\nBiological invasions and the spread of pathogens and diseases are two mechanisms that spread both inadvertently and purposefully. Biological invasions begin with introductions of foreign species or biota into an already existing environment. They can be spread by stowaways on ships or even as weapons in warfare. In some cases a new species may wreak havoc on a landscape, causing the loss of native species and destruction of the landscape. In other cases, the new species may fill a previously empty niche, and play a positive role. The spread of new pathogens, viruses, and diseases rarely have any positive effects; new pathogens and viruses sometimes destroy populations lacking immunities to those diseases. Some pathogens have the ability to transfer from one species to another, and may be spread as a secondary effect of a biological invasion.\n\nOther mechanisms of human-mediated disturbances include water management and soil management. In Mediterranean Europe, these have been recognized as ways of landscape alteration since the Roman Empire. Cicero noted that through fertilization, irrigation, and other activities, humans had essentially created a second world. At present, fertilization yields larger, more productive harvests of crops, but also has had adverse effects on many landscapes, such as decreasing the diversity of plant species and adding pollutants to soils.\n\nAnthropogenic fire is a mechanism of human-mediated disturbance, defined within historical ecology as a means of altering the landscape in a way that better suits human needs. The most common form of anthropogenic fire is controlled burns, or broadcast burning, which people have employed for thousands of years. Forest fires and burning tend to carry negative connotations, yet controlled burns can have a favorable impact on landscape diversity, formation, and protection.\n\nBroadcast burning alters the biota of a landscape. The immediate effect of a forest fire is a decrease in diversity. This negative impact associated with broadcast burning, however, is only temporary. Cycles of burning will allow the landscape to gradually increase in diversity. The time required for this change is dependent on the intensity, frequency, timing, and size of the controlled burns. After a few cycles, however, diversity increases. The adaptation to fire has shaped many of Earth's landscapes.\nIn addition to fostering diversity, controlled burns have helped change landscapes. These changes can range from grasslands to woodlands, from prairies or forest-steppes, to scrubland to forest. Whatever the case, these transformations increase diversity and engender landscapes more suitable to human needs, creating patches rich in utilitarian and natural resources.\n\nIn addition to increasing diversity of landscapes, broadcast burning can militate against catastrophic wildfires. Forest fires gained a negative connotation because of cultural references to uncontrolled fires that take lives and destroy homes and properties. Controlled burns can decrease the risk of wildfires through the regular burning of undergrowth that would otherwise fuel rampant burning. Broadcast burning has helped to fireproof landscapes by burning off undergrowth and using up potential fuel, leaving little or no chance for a wildfire to be sparked by lightning.\n\nOf all of the mechanisms of human-mediated disturbances, anthropogenic fire has become one of great interest to ecologists, geographers, soil scientists, and anthropologists alike. By studying the effects of anthropogenic fires, anthropologists have been able to identify landscape uses and requirements of past cultures. Ecologists became interested in the study of anthropogenic fire as to utilize methods from previous cultures to develop policies for regular burning. Geographers and soil scientists are interested in the utility of anthropic soils caused by burning in the past. The interest in anthropogenic fire came about in the wake of the Industrial Revolution. This time period included a mass migration from rural to urban areas, which decreased controlled burning in the countryside. This led to an increase in the frequency and strength of wildfires, thus initiating a need to develop proper prevention methods. Historical ecology focuses on the impact on landscapes through human-mediated disturbances, once such being anthropogenic fire. It is a fusion of ecological, geographical, anthropological, and pedological interests.\n\nBiological invasions are composed of exotic biota that enter a landscape and replace species with which they share similarities in structure and ecological function. Because they multiply and grow quickly, invasive species can eliminate or greatly reduce existing flora and fauna by various mechanisms, such as direct competitive exclusion. Invasive species typically spread at a faster rate when they have no natural predators or when they fill an empty niche. These invasions often occur in a historical context and are classified as a type of human-mediated disturbance called human-mediated invasions.\n\nInvasive species can be transported intentionally or accidentally. Many invasive species originate in shipping areas from where they are unintentionally transported to their new location. Sometimes human populations intentionally introduce species into new landscapes to serve various purposes, ranging from decoration to erosion control. These species can later become invasive and dramatically modify the landscape. It is important to note that not all exotic species are invasive; in fact, the majority of newly introduced species never become invasive. Humans have on their migrations through the ages taken along plants of agricultural and medicinal value, so that the modern distribution of such favored species is a clear mapping of the routes they have traveled and the places they have settled.\n\nOne example of an invasive species that has had a significant impact on the landscape is the gypsy moth (\"Lymantria dispar\"). The foliage-feeding gypsy moth is originally from temperate Eurasia; it was intentionally brought to the United States by an entomologist in 1869. Many specimens escaped from captivity and have since changed the ecology of deciduous and coniferous forests in North America by defoliation. This has led not only to the loss of wildlife habitat, but also other forest services, such as carbon sequestration and nutrient cycling. After its initial introduction, the continued accidental transport of its larvae across North America has contributed to its population explosion.\n\nRegardless of the medium of introduction, biological invasions have a considerable effect on the landscape. The goal of eliminating invasive species is not new; Plato wrote about the benefits of biotic and landscape diversity centuries ago. However, the notion of eliminating invasive species is difficult to define because there is no canonical length of time that a species must exist in a specific environment until it is no longer classified as invasive. European forestry defines plants as being archaeotypes if they existed in Europe before 1500 and neophytes if they arrived after 1500. This classification is still arbitrary and some species have unknown origins while others have become such key components of their landscape that they are best understood as keystone species. As a result, their removal would have an enormous impact on the landscape, but not necessarily cause a return to conditions that existed before the invasion.\n\nA clear relationship between nature and people is expressed through human disease. Infectious disease can thus be seen as another example of human-mediated disturbance as humans are hosts for infectious diseases. Historically, evidence of epidemic diseases is associated with the beginnings of agriculture and sedentary communities. Previously, human populations were too small and mobile for most infections to become established as chronic diseases. Permanent settlements, due to agriculture, allowed for more inter-community interaction, enabling infections to develop as specifically human pathogens.\n\nHolistic and interdisciplinary approaches to the study of human disease have revealed a reciprocal relationship between humans and parasites. The variety of parasites found within the human body often reflects the diversity of the environment in which that individual resides. For instance, Bushmen and Australian Aborigines have half as many intestinal parasites as African and Malaysian hunter-gatherers living in a species-rich tropical rainforest. Infectious diseases can be either chronic or acute, and epidemic or endemic, impacting the population in any given community to different extents. Thus, human-mediated disturbance can either increase or decrease species diversity in a landscape, causing a corresponding change in pathogenic diversity.\n\nHistorical ecologists postulate that landscape transformations have occurred throughout history, even before the dawn of western civilization. Human-mediated disturbances are predated by soil erosion and animals damming waterways which contributed to waterway transformations. Landscapes, in turn, were altered by waterway transformation. Historical ecology views the effects of human-mediated disturbances on waterway transformation as both subtle and drastic occurrences. Waterways have been modified by humans through the building of irrigation canals, expanding or narrowing waterways, and multiple other adjustments done for agricultural or transportation usage.\n\nThe evidence for past and present agricultural use of wetlands in Mesoamerica suggests an evolutionary sequence of landscape and waterway alteration. Pre-Columbian, indigenous agriculturalists developed capabilities with which to raise crops under a wide range of ecological conditions, giving rise to a multiplicity of altered, cultivated landscapes. The effects of waterway transformation were particularly evident in Mesoamerica, where agricultural practices ranged from swiddening to multicropped hydraulically transformed wetlands.\n\nHistorical ecologists view the Amazon basin landscape as cultural and embodying social labor. The Amazon River has been altered by the local population for crop growth and water transportation. Previous research failed to account for human interaction with the Amazon landscape. Recent research, however, has demonstrated that the landscape has been manipulated by its indigenous population over time. The continual, natural shifting of rivers, however, often masked the human disturbances in the course of rivers. As a result, the indigenous populations in the Amazon are often overlooked for their ability to alter the land and the river.\n\nHowever, waterway transformation has been successfully identified in the Amazon landscape. Clark Erickson observes that pre-Hispanic savanna peoples of the Bolivian Amazon built an anthropogenic landscape through the construction of raised fields, large settlement mounds, and earthen causeways. Erickson, on the basis of location, form, patterning, associations and ethnographic analogy, identified a particular form of earthwork, the zigzag structure, as fish weirs in the savanna of Baures, Bolivia. The artificial zigzag structures were raised from the adjacent savanna and served as a means to harvest the fish who used them to migrate and spawn.\n\nFurther evidence of waterway transformation is found in Igarapé Guariba in Brazil. It is an area in the Amazon basin where people have intervened in nature to change rivers and streams with dramatic results. Researcher Hugh Raffles notes that British naturalists Henry Walter Bates and Alfred Russel Wallace noted waterway transformation as they sailed through a canal close to the town of Igarapé-Miri in 1848. Archival materials identifies that it had been dug out by slaves. In his studies he notes an abundance of documentary and anecdotal evidence which supports landscape transformation by the manipulation of waterways. Transformation continues in more recent times as noted when in 1961, a group of villagers from Igarapé Guariba cut a canal about two miles (3 km) long across fields thick with tall papyrus grass and into dense tropical rain forest. The narrow canal and the stream that flowed into it have since formed a full-fledged river more than six hundred yards wide at its mouth, and the landscape in this part of the northern Brazilian state of Amapá was dramatically transformed.\n\nIn general, with an increase in global population growth, comes an increase in the anthropogenic transformation of waterways. The Sumerians had created extensive irrigations by 4000 BC. As the population increased in the 3,000 years of agriculture, the ditches and canals increased in number. By the early 1900s, ditching, dredging, and diking had become common practice. This led to an increase in erosion which impacted the landscapes. Human activities have affected the natural role of rivers and its communal value. These changes in waterways have impacted the floodplains, natural tidal patterns, and the surrounding land.\n\nThe importance of understanding such transformation is it provides a more accurate understanding to long-standing popular and academic insights of the Amazon, as well as other ecological settings, as places where indigenous populations have dealt with the forces of nature. Ecological landscapes have been portrayed as an environment, not a society. Recent studies supported by historical ecologists, however, understand that ecological landscape like the Amazon are biocultural, rather than simply natural and provide for a greater understanding of anthropogenic transformation of both waterways and landscapes.\n\nSoil management, or direct human interaction with the soil, is another mechanism of anthropogenic change studied by historical ecologists. Soil management can take place through rearranging soils, altering drainage patterns, and building large earthen formations. Consistent with the basic premises of historical ecology, it is recognized that anthropogenic soil management practices can have both positive and negative effects on local biodiversity. Some agricultural practices have led to organically and chemically impoverished soils. In the North American Midwest, industrial agriculture has led to a loss in topsoil. Salinization of the Euphrates River has occurred due to ancient Mesopotamian irrigation, and detrimental amounts of zinc have been deposited in the New Caliber River of Nigeria. Elsewhere, soil management practices may not have any effect on soil fertility. The iconic mounds of the Hopewell Indians built in the Ohio River valley likely served a religious or ceremonial purpose, and show little evidence of changing soil fertility in the landscape.\n\nThe case of soil management in the Neotropics (including the Amazon) is a classic example of beneficial results of human-mediated disturbance. In this area, prehistoric peoples altered the texture and chemical composition of natural soils. The altered black and brown earths, known as Amazon Dark Earths, or Terra preta, are actually much more fertile than unaltered surrounding soils. Furthermore, the increased soil fertility improves the results of agriculture. Terra preta is characterized by the presence of charcoal in high concentrations, along with pottery shards and organic residues from plants, animal bones, and feces. It is also shows increased levels of nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, calcium, zinc, and manganese; along with high levels of microorganic activity. It is now accepted that these soils are a product of a labor-intensive technique termed slash-and-char. In contrast to the commonly known slash-and-burn technique, this uses a lower temperature burn that produces more charcoal than ashes. Research shows these soils were created by human activity between 9000 and 2500 years ago. Contemporary local farmers actively seek out and sell this dark earth, which covers around 10% of the Amazon basin. Harvesting Terra preta does not deplete it however, for it has the ability to regenerate at the rate of one centimeter per year by sequestering more carbon.\nInterest in and the study of Amazon dark earths was advanced with the work of Wim Sombroek. Sombroek's interest in soil fertility came from his childhood. He was born in the Netherlands and lived through the Dutch famine of 1944. His family subsided on a small plot of land that had been maintained and improved for generations. Sombroek's father, in turn, improved the land by sowing it with the ash and cinders from their home. Sombroek came across Terra preta in the 1950s and it reminded him of the soil from his childhood, inspiring him to study it further. Soil biologist from the University of Kansas William W. Woods is also a major figure in Terra preta research. Woods has made several key discoveries and his comprehensive bibliography on the subject doubles in size every decade.\n\nGlobally, forests are well known for having greater biodiversity than nearby savannas or grasslands. Thus, the creation of ‘forest islands’ in multiple locations can be considered a positive result of human activity. This is evident in the otherwise uniform savannas of Guinea and central Brazil that are punctured by scattered clumps of trees. These clumps are the result of generations of intense resource management. Earth works and mounds formed by humans, such as the Ibibate mound complex in the Llanos de Mojos in Bolivia, are examples of built environments that have undergone landscape transformation and provide habitats for a greater number of species than the surrounding wetland areas. The forest islands in the Bolivian Amazon not only increase the local plant species diversity, but also enhance subsistence possibilities for the local people.\n\nHistorical ecology involves an understanding of multiple fields of study such as archaeology and cultural history as well as ecological processes, species diversity, natural variability, and the impact of human-mediated disturbances. Having a broad understanding of landscapes allows historical ecology to be applied to various disciplines. Studying past relationships between humans and landscapes can successfully aid land managers by helping develop holistic, environmentally rational, and historically accurate plans of action. As summarized in the postulates of historical ecology, humans play significant roles in the creation and destruction of landscapes as well as in ecosystem function. Through experience, many indigenous societies learned how to effectively alter their landscapes and biotic distributions. Modern societies, seeking to curtail the magnitude of their effects on the landscape, can use historical ecology to promote sustainability by learning from the past. Farmers in the Amazon region, for example, now utilize nutrient-rich terra preta to increase crop yields much like the indigenous societies that lived long before them.\n\nHistorical ecology can also aid in the goals of other fields of study. Conservation biology recognizes different types of land management processes, each attempting to maintain the landscape and biota in their present form. Restoration ecology restores sites to former function, structure, and components of biological diversity through active modification of the landscapes. Reclamation deals with shifting a degraded ecosystem back toward a higher value or use, but not necessarily to its original state. Replacement of an ecosystem would create an entirely new one. Revegetation involves new additions of biota into a landscape, not limited to the original inhabitants of an area. Each method can be enriched by the application of historical ecology and the past knowledge it supplies. The interdisciplinary nature of historical ecology would permit conservation biologists to create more effective and efficient landscape improvements. Reclamation and revegetation can use a historical perspective to determine what biota will be able to sustain large populations without threatening native biota of the landscape.\n\nA tropical forest in particular needs to be studied extensively because it is a highly diverse, heterogeneous setting. Historical ecology can use archaeological sites within this setting to study past successes and failures of indigenous peoples. The use of swidden fires in Laos is an example of historical ecology as used by current land managers in policy-making. Swidden fires were originally considered a source of habitat degradation. This conclusion led the Laos government to discourage farmers from using swidden fires as a farming technique. However, recent research has found that swidden fires were practiced historically in Laos and were not, in fact, the source of degradation. Similar research revealed that habitat degradation originated from a population increase after the Vietnam War. The greater volume of people compelled the government to put pressure on farmers for increased agricultural production. Land managers no longer automatically eliminate the use of swidden fires, but rather the number of swidden fires that are set for government-sponsored agricultural purposes.\n\nThe San Francisco Estuary Institute also uses historical ecology to study human impacts on the California landscape to guide environmental management. A study of the wetlands of Elkhorn Slough near Monterey, California, sought to enhance conservation and restoration activities. By using historical data such as maps, charts, and aerial photographs, researchers were able to trace habitat change to built structures that had negatively altered the tidal flow into the estuaries dating from the early 1900s. The study further suggested using techniques that \"imitate the complex structure of natural tidal wetlands and maintain connectivity with intact wetland habitats as well as with adjoining subtidal and upland habitats.\"\n\n"}

Along with the \"Frankfurter Zeitung\", it became one of the most important liberal German newspapers of its time.\n\nThe \"Berliner Tageblatt\" was first published by Rudolf Mosse as an advertising paper on 1 January 1872, but developed into a liberal newspaper. On 5 January 1919 the office of the newspaper was briefly occupied by Freikorps soldiers in the German Revolution. By 1920, the \"BT\" had achieved a daily circulation of about 245,000.\n\nPrior to the National Socialist administration taking office on 30 January 1933, the newspaper was particularly critical and hostile to their program. On 3 March 1933, after the Reichstag fire, Hans Lachmann-Mosse, the publisher, dismissed editor in chief Theodor Wolff because of his criticism of the Nazi government and his Jewish ancestry. Wolff by then fled to the Tyrol in Austria by plane.\n\nAfter 1933, the National Socialist government took control of the newspaper (the Gleichschaltung). However, in September 1933, special permission was granted by Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels to release the paper from any obligation to reprint Nazi propaganda in order to help portray an image of a free German press internationally. Due to this assurance, their respected foreign correspondent Paul Scheffer became editor on 1 April 1934. He had been the first foreign journalist to be refused a re-entry permit into the Soviet Union in 1929 for his critical reporting on the Five-Year Plan and prophecy of famine in Ukraine.\n\nFor almost two years, Scheffer surrounded himself by independently minded university graduates such as Margaret Boveri. She wrote in 1960 that Scheffer \"\"was hated from the beginning by leading people of the Propaganda Ministry, and it was only because of his excellent foreign connections that he was not relieved of his position in the early years of the regime.\"\" Scheffer's position eventually became untenable and he resigned on 31 December 1936.\n\nThe paper was finally shut down by the Nazi authorities on 31 January 1939.\n\nDuring the 27 years (1906–1933) when Theodor Wolff was editor in chief, the \"BT\" became the most influential newspaper in Berlin. Wolff brought the elite of German journalism to the \"Berliner Tageblatt\". Ernst Feder and Rudolf Olden ran the domestic politics section, while Josef Schwab, Max Jordan, and Maximilian Müller-Jabusch handled foreign politics. Arthur Norden and Felix Pinner were responsible for the business section. headed the feuilleton section from 1922 to 1932. Regular contributors to the feuilleton included Alfred Polgar, Fritz Mauthner, Kurt Tucholsky, Erich Kästner, Robert Walser, Otto Flake, Felix Hirsch and Frank Thiess. The chief of the theatre section was Alfred Kerr.\n\nFrom 1918 until April 1920, Kurt Tucholsky contributed 50 articles to the \"Berliner Tageblatt\" while he was also editor in chief of the satirical magazine \"Ulk\", which appeared weekly between 1913 and 1933. His novel \"Schloss Gripsholm\" (based on Gripsholm Castle) appeared in the \"BT\" from 20 March to 26 April 1931. Alfred Eisenstaedt was one of the newspaper's photographers.\n\nErich Everth began corresponding from the \"BT\" from Vienna in 1924. As the successor of Leopold Schmidt, Alfred Einstein was the musical critic from September 1927 until August 1933. The head of the important Central European Office from 1927 to 1933 was Heinrich Eduard Jacob, based in Vienna. During his time at the \"BT\", Jacob had approximately 1,000 contributions. Because he was an opponent of the Austrian Nazis, Jacob was imprisoned at Dachau concentration camp after the Anschluss in 1938.\n\nThe \"BT\" published separate weekly magazines, distributed as part of the newspaper.

It is about in length. \n\nAlthough the designation implies the possibility of a through journey, this is no longer practical as there are no direct car ferry crossings between the United Kingdom and Norway.\n\nThe route starts in Northern Ireland and runs from Craigavon (M1) – Belfast (M2, A8) – Larne, then to Scotland: Stranraer, Dumfries and Galloway (A75) – Gretna – then England via the (M6) – Carlisle (A69) to Newcastle. As is normal for European routes in the United Kingdom, it is not signposted as such.\n\n\n\n\nThere are no ferries from Newcastle to Norway. Freight-only ferries may operate from other United Kingdom ports to Norway or Denmark, but for car journeys the only practical route is a crossing to France, Belgium or the Netherlands, followed by a road journey through Germany and Denmark, and a ferry crossing from there to Norway.\n\nThe route continues as a motorway from Kristiansand in Norway. E18 is connected with the E39 Ferry to Denmark. The ferry runs from Kristansand to Hirtshals, takes about 3 hours and 15 minutes, and is operated by Color Line.\n\nIn Norway, the E18 has a length of , of which are motorway. It runs Kristiansand – Arendal – Porsgrunn – Larvik – Sandefjord – Tønsberg – Horten – Drammen – Oslo – Ås – Askim – Ørje.\n\nA flyover carrying the E18 Holmestrand bypass, opened in 2001, partially collapsed in February 2015 following a landslip, necessitating its demolition.\n\nFrom Ørje, the E18 crosses the border into Sweden at Töcksfors. It has a length of , of which are motorway. It runs Töcksfors – Karlstad – Örebro – Västerås – Stockholm / Kapellskär.\n\nThe connection over the Baltic Sea is from Stockholm or Kapellskär, in Sweden, to Turku or Naantali, in Finland, using by ferries operated by Silja Line, Viking Line or Finnlines. It is also possible to take a direct route to Helsinki. In theory it is also possible to cross the sea via Åland and the Åboland islands by island hopping over bridges, by cable ferries and ferries along the Archipelago Ring Road, but this low-capacity route is not signposted as being part of the E18.\n\nIn Finland the E18 goes from Åland through southern Finland by way of Turku/Naantali – Salo – Lohja – Espoo – Porvoo – Loviisa – Kotka – Hamina – Vaalimaa till the border with Russia. Crossing the border to Russia used to often require queuing as the volume of traffic using it increased. The situation has since 2009 improved thanks to increased capacity, and a new parking lot constructed by 2016 is expected to solve the problem for good.\n\nIn Russia, E18 goes along the M10 highway from Finnish border to Saint Petersburg. The stretch of M10 between Saint Petersburg and the Finnish border will be redesignated to A181 by 2018. The route runs through northwestern Leningrad Oblast and mostly through sparsely populated areas. Since 2003, after opening of Vyborg bypass E18 does not go through Vyborg, though previously it did. Near Saint Petersburg the route runs through suburbs, such as Sestroretsk and Olgino. E18 terminates at the western border of Saint Petersburg.\n\nThere are plans to expand the road from one to three lanes in each direction because of the increasing volume of traffic. In 2012 the highway will be connected with the Western Rapid Diameter near Beloostrov by expanded existing junction of M10 with the Zelenogorsk highway. It is likely to be a new terminus of E18.\n\n"}

His 2006 memoir, \"Born on a Blue Day\", about his life with Asperger syndrome and savant syndrome, was named a \"Best Book for Young Adults\" in 2008 by the American Library Association \"Young Adult Library Services\" magazine. His second book, \"Embracing the Wide Sky\", was one of France's best-selling books of 2009. His third book, \"Thinking in Numbers\", was published on 16 August 2012 by Hodder & Stoughton in the United Kingdom and on 30 July 2013 by Little, Brown and Company in the United States and Canada. \"Mishenka\", his first novel, was published in France and Quebec in 2016. His books have been published in over 20 languages. He was elected in 2012 to serve as a fellow of the Royal Society of Arts.\n\nTammet was born Daniel Paul Corney and raised in Barking and Dagenham, East London, England, as the eldest of nine children. As a young child, he suffered epileptic seizures, which remitted following medical treatment.\n\nHe participated twice in the World Memory Championships in London under his birth name, placing 11th in 1999 and 4th in 2000.\n\nHe changed his birth name by deed poll because \"it didn't fit with the way he saw himself.\" He took the Estonian surname \"Tammet\" which is related to \"oak tree\".\n\nAt age twenty-five, he was diagnosed with Asperger syndrome by Simon Baron-Cohen of the University of Cambridge Autism Research Centre. He is one of fewer than a hundred \"prodigious savants\" according to Darold Treffert, the world's leading researcher in the study of savant syndrome.\n\nHe was the subject of a documentary film titled \"Extraordinary People: The Boy with the Incredible Brain\", first broadcast on the British television station Channel 4 on 23 May 2005.\n\nHe met software engineer Neil Mitchell in 2000. They lived in Kent, England, where they had a quiet life at home with their cats, preparing meals from their garden. He and Mitchell operated the online e-learning company Optimnem, where they created and published language courses.\n\nTammet now lives in Paris, France, with his husband Jérôme Tabet, a photographer whom he met while promoting his autobiography. Tammet is openly gay.\n\nTammet is a graduate of the Open University with a Bachelor of Arts degree with first-class honours in the humanities.\n\nIn 2002, Tammet launched the website, Optimnem. The site offers language courses (currently French and Spanish) and has been an approved member of the UK National Grid for Learning since 2006.\n\n\"Born on a Blue Day\" received international media attention and critical praise. \"Booklist\" magazine contributing reviewer Ray Olson stated that Tammet's autobiography was \"as fascinating as Benjamin Franklin's and John Stuart Mill's\" and that Tammet wrote \"some of the clearest prose this side of Hemingway\". \"Kirkus Reviews\" stated that the book \"transcends the disability memoir genre\".\n\nFor his US book tour, Tammet appeared on several television and radio talk shows and specials, including \"60 Minutes\" and the \"Late Show with David Letterman\". In February 2007 \"Born on a Blue Day\" was serialised as BBC Radio 4's \"Book of the Week\" in the United Kingdom.\n\nHis second book, \"Embracing the Wide Sky\", was published in 2009. Allan Snyder, director of the University of Sydney Centre for the Mind, called the work 'an extraordinary and monumental achievement'. Tammet argues that savant abilities are not \"supernatural\" but are \"an outgrowth\" of \"natural, instinctive ways of thinking about numbers and words\". He suggests that the brains of savants can, to some extent, be retrained, and that normal brains could be taught to develop some savant abilities.\n\n\"Thinking in Numbers\", a collection of essays, was first published in 2012 and serialised as BBC Radio 4's \"Book of the Week\" in the United Kingdom.\n\nHis translation into French of a selection of poetry by Les Murray was published by L'Iconoclaste in France in 2014.\n\nTammet's first novel, \"Mishenka\", came out in France and Quebec in 2016.\n\n\"Every Word Is a Bird We Teach to Sing\", a collection of essays on language, was published in the UK, US, and France in 2017. In a review of the book for the \"Wall Street Journal\", Brad Leithauser noted that \"in terms of literary genres, something new and enthralling is going on inside his books\" and that the author showed \"a grasp of language and a sweep of vocabulary that any poet would envy\".\n\n\"Portraits\", a bilingual first poetry collection, was published in 2018.\n\nAfter the World Memory Championships, Tammet participated in a group study, later published in the New Year 2003 edition of \"Nature Neuroscience\". The researchers investigated the reasons for the memory champions' superior performance. They reported that they used \"strategies for encoding information with the sole purpose of making it more memorable\", and concluded that superior memory was not driven by exceptional intellectual ability or differences in brain structure.\n\nIn another study, Baron-Cohen and others at the Autism Research Centre tested Tammet's abilities in around 2005. Tammet was found to have synaesthesia according to the \"Test of Genuineness-Revised\" which tests the subjects' consistency in reporting descriptions of their synaesthesia. He performed well on tests of short term memory (with a digit-span of 11.5, where 6.5 is typical). Conversely, test results showed his memory for faces scored at the level expected of a 6- to 8-year-old child in this task. The authors of the study speculated that his savant memory could be a result of synaesthesia combined with Asperger syndrome, or it could be the result of mnemonic strategies.\n\nBaron-Cohen, Bor and Billington investigated whether Tammet's synaesthesia and Asperger syndrome explained his savant memory abilities in a further study published in \"Neurocase\" in 2008. They concluded that his abilities might be explained by hyperactivity in one brain region (the left prefrontal cortex), which results from his Asperger syndrome and synaesthesia. On the Navon task, relative to non-autistic controls, Tammet was found to be faster at finding a target at the local level and to be less distracted by interference from the global level. In an fMRI scan, \"Tammet did not activate extra-striate regions of the brain normally associated with synaesthesia, suggesting that he has an unusual and more abstract and conceptual form of synaesthesia\". Published in \"Cerebral Cortex\" (2011), an fMRI study led by Jean-Michel Hupé at the University of Toulouse (France) observed no activation of colour areas in ten synaesthetes. Hupé suggests that synaesthetic colour experience lies not in the brain's colour system, but instead results from \"a complex construction of meaning in the brain, involving not only perception, but language, memory and emotion\".\n\nIn his book \"Moonwalking with Einstein\" (2011), the science journalist and former US Memory Champion Joshua Foer speculates that study of conventional mnemonic approaches has played a role in Tammet's feats of memory. While accepting that Tammet meets the standard definition of a prodigious savant, Foer suggests that his abilities may simply reflect intensive training using standard memory techniques, rather than any abnormal psychology or neurology \"per se\". In a review of his book for \"The New York Times\", psychologist Alexandra Horowitz described Foer's speculation as among the book's few \"missteps\", questioning whether it would matter if Tammet had used such strategies or not.\n\nTammet has been studied continuously by researchers in Britain and the United States, and has been the subject of several peer-reviewed scientific papers. Allan Snyder at the Australian National University has said of him: \"Savants can't usually tell us how they do what they do. It just comes to them. Daniel can describe what he sees in his head. That's why he's exciting. He could be the Rosetta Stone.\"\n\nIn his mind, Tammet says, each positive integer up to 10,000 has its own unique shape, colour, texture and feel. He has described his visual image of 289 as particularly ugly, 333 as particularly attractive, and pi, though not an integer, as beautiful. The number 6 apparently has no distinct image yet what he describes as an almost small nothingness, opposite to the number 9 which he calls large, towering, and quite intimidating. He also describes the number 117 as \"a handsome number. It's tall, it's a lanky number, a little bit wobbly\" and described David Letterman with the number 117 in these terms when interviewed on the Letterman Show. In his memoir, he describes experiencing a synaesthetic and emotional response for numbers and words.\n\nHe set the European record for reciting pi from memory to 22,514 digits in five hours and nine minutes on 14 March 2004. He revealed in a French talk show on Radio Classique on 29 April 2016, that this event was the inspiration behind Kate Bush's song \"Pi\" from her album \"Aerial\".\n\nHe is a polyglot. In \"Born on a Blue Day\", he writes that he knows ten languages: English, Finnish, French, German, Lithuanian, Esperanto, Spanish, Romanian, Icelandic, and Welsh. In \"Embracing the Wide Sky\", he writes that he learned conversational Icelandic in a week and then appeared on an interview on \"Kastljós\" on RÚV speaking the language.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMänti is a constructed language that Tammet published in 2006. The word \"Mänti\" comes from the Finnish word for \"pine tree\" (\"mänty\"). Mänti uses vocabulary and grammar from the Finnic languages. Some sample words include:\n\n\n\n"}

It is widespread but not very common, usually appearing as an individual plant amongst other species. It was first collected by scientist and explorer Meriwether Lewis in 1806 during the Lewis and Clark expedition and the \"Philadelphus lewisii\" is named after him.\n\nThe shrub is rounded and grows to in height. It sends out long stems which are red when new and fade to gray with age, the bark shredding in small flakes. The oppositely arranged leaves vary in size across individual plants but they are usually oval, long, smooth or serrated along the edges, and light green in color with a rough texture. The flowers are produced in clusters at the ends of long stems, with four white petals up to long and numerous yellow stamens. At the height of flowering, the plant is covered in a mass of blossoms. The flowers have a heavy, sweet scent similar to orange blossoms with a hint of pineapple. The fruit is a small hard capsule about a centimeter long with woody, pointed wings, containing many brown seeds. It is hardy from USDA zones 3 to 9.\n\nNative American tribes used \"P. lewisii\" for numerous purposes. The hard wood was useful for making hunting and fishing tools, snowshoes, pipes, and furniture. The leaves and bark, which contain saponins, were mixed in water for use as a mild soap. \"Native American used stems for making arrows,(USDA FS 1937) bows, combs, tobacco pipes, cradles and netting shuttles.\" \"Flowers are used in preparing perfumes and teas (Taylor 1972).\"\n\nLewis' mock-orange prefers full sun to partial sun. It is drought-tolerant, will grow in poor soils and is suitable for xeriscaping. It provides a landscape with flashy flowers and a fruity scent.\n\nThe Waterton Mockorange \"Philadelphus lewisii 'Waterton\"' was hybridized by the Alberta Horticultural Research Station in Brooks, Alberta, Canada. It is drought-tolerant and is suitable for xeriscaping. It grows to 4–6 ft. (1.2-1.8 m) in height. It is hardy from USDA zones 3 to 9. In 1933 Augustus Griffin noted that this plant was growing in what is now Waterton Lakes National Park of Canada on the east side of the Rocky Mountains. Griffin (1883-1946) was a horticulture pioneer who collected, grew, crossed and tested plants at the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) Headquarters Farm (now the Alberta Horticultural Research Station) in Brooks where he worked as irrigation engineer. His former home is a registered historical site.\n\n\"Philadelphus lewisii\" is the state flower of Idaho.\n\n"}

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nBefore the city was founded by the Spanish colonizers, it is known as \"Kabaritan\", named for the plant commonly seen in the area. With its wide plains, agriculture is the main source of livelihood in the city. It is part of the rice granary of the Philippines. Besides rice, the city also produces vegetables, fruits, and onions. It is now a leading producer of onions in the country. Every year the Tanduyong Festival is held in April coinciding with the annual fiesta to celebrate this. Tanduyong is a variety of onion grown in the area.\n\nThe city has two pronounced seasons, rainy season from the months of May to November and the dry season in the remaining months.\n\nSan Jose, years before it became a town was a wilderness, a veritable hunting ground for wild animals by the inhabitants of its neighboring towns. The earliest inhabitants were known as Negritos (Baluga) headed by Kapitan Danding, a Negrito convert residing in Pinagcuartelan. These early inhabitants depended mostly on hunting and fishing for their livelihood. Some hunters from the neighboring towns found San Jose as a good place for settlers due to its wide and uncleared agricultural land. The first group of settlers made some clearings (kaingin) in the outskirts of the present town.\n\nOriginally, San Jose was a part of the town Puncan, but later on, because of its nearness to Lupao, it was made a barrio of the latter. The early history of this town was coupled with the early history of Puncan and Lupao. Formerly, San Jose was known as the barrio of “Kabaritan” derived from \"barit\", an Ilocano word for a plant that belongs to the rattan family. “Kabaritan” means the place where “barit” grows in abundance.\n\nOn March 19, 1894, San Jose carved out its own course for on this date it became a full-fledged town, with an interim government headed by a Kapitan Municipal. “Kabaritan” (now known as San Jose) was made an independent town from Lupao and was named after Saint Joseph, the patron saint of the place.\n\nSeveral years before the Philippine Revolution, the Ilocanos from Ilocos Region and some parts of Nueva Ecija, especially the towns of Santo Domingo, Muñoz and Lupao, as well as Pangasinenses of Pangasinan and northern Tarlac, came and plunged deep into the forest of Kabaritan, and cleared its wilderness. It was from this time then that the growth of the town really started. The progress of the town was through the enterprise, thrift, and hardihood of these settlers, headed by Canuto Ramos.\n\nDuring the Spanish Regime, the barrio of Kabaritan was a municipal district of Lupao, headed by a \"Teniente Absoluto\". Later, when Kabaritan was declared a town in 1894, the head was changed to a \"Kapitan Municipal\". The first man appointed as Kapitan Municipal was Canuto Ramos. He served from 1894 to 1898. One of his remarkable achievements was the Construction of an Irrigation System which was later taken over and enlarged by the government (now the Talavera River Irrigation System) which irrigates vast ricefields as far as the towns of Muñoz and Talavera.\n\nWhen the revolution broke out and upon the surrender of the Spaniards in 1898, a revolutionary government was set up in San Jose. The town remained as such until the establishment of a civil government under the Americans in 1901.\n\nSan Jose, under the American Regime, became a progressive town. Its inhabitants enjoyed more rights and privileges- political, economic, intellectual and religious than before. This was due to the establishment of various schools, churches, public buildings and the construction of roads and bridges, which made possible the fast progress of the town.\n\nFrom 1898 to 1900, a military government under the American Regime was established. Jose Cardenas was appointed Kapitan Municipal. During his term, the appointment of town officials, town planning, and the opening of new settlements was among his achievements.\n\nThe second appointed Kapitan Municipal during the military government (1900–1901) was Celestino Javalde who continued the opening of new settlements and the construction of roads in the poblacion.\n\nWhen the civil government under the American Regime was established, Cornelio Ramos was appointed Kapitan Municipal. He continued the construction of roads in the \"poblacion\" and he also took a hand in the construction of irrigation canals leading to the different barrios of San Jose.\n\nIn 1904, the Filipinos were given more rights and freedom in choosing the right man to take the reins of the government. An election was held. The first elected Municipal President was Crisanto Sanchez (1904–1906). Among his achievements was the construction of roads, the naming of the streets in the \"poblacion\" and the appointments of municipal officials.\n\nAgain, (1906–1908) Celestino Javalde was elected Municipal President. With the help of his Vice-President and other municipal officials, he stressed land reforms, which paved the way for equal distribution of lands.\n\nThe President-elect of 1908–1910, Valerio Escobar concentrated on the Construction of Roads from Sibut to San Agustin. He also founded the barrios of Santa Barbara and Kapisungan (now Bagong Sikat).\n\nDesiderio De Guzman had a chance to be elected in 1910 and served up to 1912. He had many achievements but among all these, he paid more attention to the improvements of records in the Poblacion.\n\nDuring the incumbency of Municipal President Agapito Kurameng, (1912–1916), he initiated the Construction of a Concrete Elementary School Building (Gabaldon building) which now comprised one of the central school buildings of the San Jose West Elementary School. The improvement of roads, expropriation of lots for the Municipal Hall and the Public Market were among his other achievements.\n\nThe construction of the Municipal building and the construction of more roads leading to the barrios were launched by Gregorio Cadhit (1916–1919). He was re-elected to office from 1919 to 1922. During his term in 1919 to 1922, he initiated the construction of one of the buildings of the public market.\n\nAs years went by, the town became so progressive that there was a need for more public improvements and building constructions for the welfare of the populace. As an answer to such demands, the newly elected President Rafael Rueda and Vice-President Estanislao Arquero with the help of other municipal officials put up a Puericulture Center and a Municipal Nursery during the period from 1922 to 1925. A second building for the public market was also constructed. Telephone lines connecting the poblacion with all the barrios were installed. A road to Kalbarito (now Palestina) was constructed and more improvement of roads was done.\n\nAnother man in the person of Raymundo Eugenio was elected Municipal President of San Jose for the period from 1925 to 1928. A third building for the public market was constructed and more construction of roads, especially those leading to Andres Bonifacio, were put underway.\n\nIn 1928–1931, Apolonio Pascual and Vice-President Victorino Villar were instrumental in putting up the fourth building for the public market and the municipal dispensary. More improvement of roads leading to the barrios was also done.\n\nRaymundo Eugenio was re-elected to the office. He served from 1931 to 1934 with Vice-President Ladislao Bunag. Raymundo Eugenio was called the road-building President of San Jose because of the untiring efforts that he exerted in the construction of many roads especially roads leading to the barrios of Bagong Bayan, Porais, Tondod, and Andres Bonifacio.\n\nApolonio Pascual was re-elected for the 1934–1937 term. Dimas Tomas was the Vice President for the same term. Due to a change in the set-up in 1935, which was known as the commonwealth government, the heads of the municipal government came to be known and called Alcalde and Vice-Alcalde. Aside from the construction of more roads, the barrios of Patacla (now San Francisco) and A. Pascual were founded. The waterworks that provides the people of San Jose with drinking water was constructed and installed. The home economics building of San Jose Central School was also constructed.\n\nAlcalde Pedro Del Pilar and Vice-Alcalde Severino Bautista, under the Commonwealth government, established NARIC (National Rice and Corn) buying stations in the town. This was during their term of office from 1937 to 1940. They were re-elected for the 1940–1942 term. As a continuation of their policies, the improvement of roads was continued.\n\nDue to the outbreak of World War II on December 8, 1941, San Jose became an evacuation center. Evacuees from neighboring provinces especially those from Manila and suburbs sought refuge in this town. The tranquility of the place was marred by the bombings of two Japanese planes on December 23, 1941. The terror-stricken populace, who suffered heavy casualties fled to the remotest barrios of San Jose. An emergency government under the Commonwealth was established in the barrio of Porais with Basilio Duran as Mayor, appointed by the military forces of the Commonwealth Government. The emergency government existed for a short time, due to the arrival of the Japanese Imperial Forces on January 26, 1942.\n\nAn emergency government, under the control of the Japanese Imperial Forces, was likewise established in Porais with Matias Bautista as Mayor. Due to the non-cooperation of the appointed Mayor Bautista, the Japanese army was obliged to appoint Mayor Anastacio Bascos. Engr. Casimiro Panajon succeeded him. Mayor Panajon was however murdered by the soldiers of the Japanese Garrison of this town for his non-collaboration with them and his guerilla activities.\n\nDuring the liberation, under the Commonwealth government, Anselmo Patacsil, Pedro Del Pilar and Basilio Duran were appointed in succession as Mayors of this town by the PCAU (Philippine Civil Affairs Unit) of the liberation forces. Each served for a short period of time in 1945–1946. They strived once more for the re-organization of the Municipal Government in cooperation with officials to coordinate the work of the PCAU. These persons helped in the establishment of emergency hospitals, the North Provincial High School and the re-opening of elementary schools.\n\nOn July 4, 1946, the Philippines was granted its independence, there came about a change in our form of government, from Commonwealth to Republic.\n\nUnder the Republic of the Philippines, Alfonso Villamar was elected Mayor with Paulino Margarejo as his Vice Mayor, (1947–1951). Among their achievements were the maintenance of evacuees, pacification campaign, rehabilitation of devastated government building, the establishment of a fire department and a municipal library and the improvement of roads.\n\nIn 1954, the barrios of Bagumbayan (townsite), Andres Bonifacio, Caridad, San Mauricio (portion), Parang Manga (portion), Santa Barbara, Floridablanca, Gomez, San Francisco, and Victoria were separated to form the town of Llanera along with some territory from Talavera and Rizal.\n\nThe city of San Jose lies at 15° 47' North, 120° 59' East in Central Luzon. The estimated elevation at these coordinates is approximately 109.9 meters or 360.4 feet above mean sea level.\n\nSan Jose has a tropical wet and dry climate (Köppen-Geiger system: \"Aw\"),The average annual temperature is 26.7 °C in San Jose City. Precipitation here averages 1869 mm.\n\nThe current population of San Jose City is 129,424 people in 23,191 households as of May 2010. The majority language used is Tagalog, more than 72 percent of the population speak it as their native tongue, followed by Ilocano, Kapampangan, and Pangasinense.\n\nOn February 16, 1984, the Diocese of San Jose was created by Pope John Paul II. The creation of the new diocese bisected the province horizontally into the Diocese of Cabanatuan in the south, and the Diocese of San Jose in the north, both the suffragans of the Archdiocese of Lingayen-Dagupan. 80% of the city residents are Catholics and the patron saint is Saint Joseph. The feast is celebrated every March 19 annually. The diocese now has 17 parishes administered by 22 priests working under one bishop. Among its Catholic institutions are 9 high schools, 4 elementary schools, 6 kindergarten schools, 1 diocesan catechetical center, and the Don Bosco Training Center.\n\nSan Jose City is politically subdivided into 38 barangays.\nAgriculture is the prime revenue of San Jose City since it is a part of the rice granary of the Philippines. However other agri-based produce are vegetables, fruits and onions. The city is now a leading producer of onions in the country.\n\nThe city's local crops range from rice, corn, and onion; thus the city is also referred to as the \"City of the Golden Harvests\" and “Rice Bowl of the Philippines.” Other crops are mango, banana, eggplant, and garlic.\n\nMajor bus companies from Metro Manila ply the route going to San Jose City along the Pan-Philippine Highway. Baliwag Transit, Inc. has terminal in Pasay and Cubao, Quezon City has buses that travel specifically to and from Nueva Ecija.\n\nBus Companies going to San Jose City\n\nThe Philippine National Railways (then Manila Railroad Company) used to have a branch line northwards from Tutuban, Manila and branches out from the mainline in Tarlac City going to San Jose City. The Tarlac-San Jose line, which served the towns of Guimba, Muñoz and San Jose, was initially constructed in the 1920s and was completed in 1939. However, in 1988, during the administration of Corazon Aquino, the North Main Line was closed (see Philippine National Railways). This railway branch line has long been neglected and dismantled since its closure. The concrete ruins of the old MRR station of San Jose City are located along San Roque Street in Barangay Abar 1st.\n\nSan Jose City has many private and public schools.\nPrivate schools:\n\nPublic schools:\nThe park is situated at the gateway to the Cagayan Valley, at the foot of Mount Caraballo. This place is truly a haven for nature lovers and one can enjoy picnics and sightseeing. It has a hundred step stairs leading to lamp-lit pagodas in the hilltop, and is a nice spot to view Nueva Ecija.\n\nThis waterfall is located in the outskirts of the city, in the barrio Manicla, seven kilometers away from the Poblacion, ideal for picnics and bathing especially during the summer period.\n\n\nIn 2018, the city has been named as the Christmal Capital of Nueva Ecija for its grand Christmas lights.\n\n\nIn 2008, with rice as its primary produce, San Jose City conducted its First Rice Festival, adopting the century – old festive tradition. However, unlike in older days, wherein people celebrate separately in their barangays, San Jose City now celebrates as one big family. The after-harvest celebration has become a multi-sectoral effort, collectively prepared, funded out of contributions (from the public and private sector), and participated in by all sections of the city.\n\nSince 2015, Pagibang Damara festival features the best Pancit Kanin contest.

Wallis Budge\n\nSir Ernest Alfred Thompson Wallis Budge (27 July 185723 November 1934) was an English Egyptologist, Orientalist, and philologist who worked for the British Museum and published numerous works on the ancient Near East. He made numerous trips to Egypt and the Sudan on behalf of the British Museum to buy antiquities, and helped it build its collection of cuneiform tablets, manuscripts, and papyri. He published many books on Egyptology, helping to bring the findings to larger audiences. In 1920, he was knighted for his service to Egyptology and the British Museum.\n\nE. A. Wallis Budge was born in 1857 in Bodmin, Cornwall, to Mary Ann Budge, a young woman whose father was a waiter in a Bodmin hotel. Budge's father has never been identified. Budge left Cornwall as a boy, and eventually came to live with his maternal aunt and grandmother in London.\n\nBudge became interested in languages before he was ten years old, but left school at the age of twelve in 1869 to work as a clerk at the retail firm of W.H. Smith, which sold books, stationery and related products. In his spare time, he studied Biblical Hebrew and Syriac with the aid of a volunteer tutor named Charles Seeger. Budge became interested in learning the ancient Assyrian language in 1872, when he also began to spend time in the British Museum. Budge's tutor introduced him to the Keeper of Oriental Antiquities, the pioneer Egyptologist Samuel Birch, and Birch's assistant, the Assyriologist George Smith. Smith helped Budge occasionally with his Assyrian. Birch allowed the youth to study cuneiform tablets in his office and obtained books for him from the British Library of Middle Eastern travel and adventure, such as Austen Henry Layard's \"Nineveh and Its Remains.\"\n\nFrom 1869 to 1878, Budge spent his free time studying Assyrian, and during these years, often spent his lunch break studying at St. Paul's Cathedral. John Stainer, the organist of St. Paul's, noticed Budge's hard work, and met the youth. He wanted to help the working-class boy realize his dream of becoming a scholar. Stainer contacted W.H. Smith, a Conservative Member of Parliament, and the former Liberal Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone, and asked them to help his young friend. Both Smith and Gladstone agreed to help Stainer to raise money for Budge to attend the University of Cambridge.\n\nBudge studied at Cambridge from 1878 to 1883. His subjects included Semitic languages: Hebrew, Syriac, Ge'ez and Arabic; he continued to study Assyrian independently. Budge worked closely during these years with William Wright, a noted scholar of Semitic languages, among others.\n\nIn 1883 he married Dora Helen Emerson, who died in 1926.\n\nBudge entered the British Museum in 1883 in the recently renamed Department of Egyptian and Assyrian Antiquities. Initially appointed to the Assyrian section, he soon transferred to the Egyptian section. He studied the Egyptian language with Samuel Birch until the latter's death in 1885. Budge continued to study ancient Egyptian with the new Keeper, Peter le Page Renouf, until the latter's retirement in 1891.\n\nBetween 1886 and 1891, Budge was assigned by the British Museum to investigate why cuneiform tablets from British Museum sites in Iraq, which were to be guarded by local agents of the Museum, were showing up in the collections of London antiquities dealers. The British Museum was purchasing these collections of what were their \"own\" tablets at inflated London market rates. Edward Bond, the Principal Librarian of the Museum, wanted Budge to find the source of the leaks and to seal it. Bond also wanted Budge to establish ties to Iraqi antiquities dealers in order to buy available materials at the reduced local prices, in comparison to those in London. Budge also travelled to Istanbul during these years to obtain a permit from the Ottoman Empire government to reopen the Museum's excavations at these Iraqi sites. The Museum archeologists believed that excavations would reveal more tablets.\n\nDuring his years in the British Museum, Budge also sought to establish ties with local antiquities dealers in Egypt and Iraq so that the Museum could buy antiquities from them, and avoid the uncertainty and cost of excavating. This was a 19th-century approach to building a museum collection, and it was changed markedly by more rigorous archeological practices, technology and cumulative knowledge about assessing artifacts in place. Budge returned from his many missions to Egypt and Iraq with large collections of cuneiform tablets; Syriac, Coptic and Greek manuscripts; as well as significant collections of hieroglyphic papyri. Perhaps his most famous acquisitions from this time were the Papyrus of Ani, a \"Book of the Dead\"; a copy of Aristotle's lost Constitution of Athens, and the Amarna letters. Budge's prolific and well-planned acquisitions gave the British Museum arguably the best Ancient Near East collections in the world, at a time when European museums were competing to build such collections. In 1900 the Assyriologist Archibald Sayce said to Budge, \"What a revolution you have effected in the Oriental Department of the Museum! It is now a veritable history of civilization in a series of object lessons[.]\"\n\nBudge became Assistant Keeper in his department after Renouf retired in 1891, and was confirmed as Keeper in 1894. He held this position until 1924, specializing in Egyptology. Budge and collectors for other museums of Europe regarded having the best collection of Egyptian and Assyrian antiquities in the world as a matter of national pride, and there was tremendous competition for such antiquities among them. Museum officials and their local agents smuggled antiquities in diplomatic pouches, bribed customs officials, or simply went to friends or countrymen in the Egyptian Service of Antiquities to ask them to pass their cases of antiquities unopened. During his tenure as Keeper, Budge was noted for his kindness and patience in teaching young visitors to the British Museum.\n\nBudge's tenure was not without controversy. In 1893 he was sued in the high court by Hormuzd Rassam for both slander and libel. Budge had written that Rassam had used his relatives to smuggle antiquities out of Nineveh and had sent only \"rubbish\" to the British Museum. The elderly Rassam was upset by these accusations, and when he challenged Budge, he received a partial apology that a later court considered \"ungentlemanly\". Rassam was supported by the judge but not the jury. After Rassam's death, it was alleged that, while Rassam had made most of the discoveries of antiquities, credit was taken by the staff of the British Museum, notably Austen Henry Layard.\n\nBudge was also a prolific author, and he is especially remembered today for his works on ancient Egyptian religion and his hieroglyphic primers. Budge argued that the religion of Osiris had emerged from an indigenous African people: \n\"There is no doubt\", he said of Egyptian religions in \"Osiris and the Egyptian Resurrection\" (1911), \"that the beliefs examined herein are of indigenous origin, Nilotic or Sûdânî in the broadest signification of the word, and I have endeavoured to explain those which cannot be elucidated in any other way, by the evidence which is afforded by the Religions of the modern peoples who live on the great rivers of East, West, and Central Africa . . . Now, if we examine the Religions of modern African peoples, we find that the beliefs underlying them are almost identical with those Ancient Egyptian ones described above. As they are not derived from the Egyptians, it follows that they are the natural product of the religious mind of the natives of certain parts of Africa, which is the same in all periods.\"\n\nBudge's contention that the religion of the Egyptians was derived from similar religions of the people of northeastern and central Africa was regarded as impossible by his colleagues. At the time, all but a few scholars followed Flinders Petrie in his theory that the culture of Ancient Egypt was derived from an invading \"Dynastic Race,\" which had conquered Egypt in late prehistory and introduced the Pharaonic culture.\n\nBudge's works were widely read by the educated public and among those seeking comparative ethnological data, including James Frazer. He incorporated some of Budge's ideas on Osiris into his ever-growing work on comparative religion, \"The Golden Bough\".\n\nBudge was also interested in the paranormal, and believed in spirits and hauntings. Budge had a number of friends in the Ghost Club (British Library, Manuscript Collections, Ghost Club Archives), a group in London committed to the study of alternative religions and the spirit world. He told his many friends stories of hauntings and other uncanny experiences. Many people in his day who were involved with the occult and spiritualism after losing their faith in Christianity were dedicated to Budge's works, particularly his translation of the \"Egyptian Book of the Dead.\" Such writers as the poet William Butler Yeats and James Joyce studied and were influenced by this work of ancient religion. Budge's works on Egyptian religion have remained consistently in print since they entered the public domain.\n\nBudge was a member of the literary and open-minded Savile Club in London, proposed by his friend H. Rider Haggard in 1889, and accepted in 1891. He was a much sought-after dinner guest in London, his humorous stories and anecdotes being famous in his circle. He enjoyed the company of the well-born, many of whom he met when they brought to the British Museum the scarabs and statuettes they had purchased while on holiday in Egypt. Budge never lacked for an invitation to a country house in the summer or to a fashionable townhouse during the London season.\n\nThough Budge's books remain widely available, since his day both translation and dating accuracy have improved, leading to significant revisions. The common writing style of his era—a lack of clear distinction between opinion and incontrovertible fact—is no longer acceptable in scholarly works.\n\nBudge was knighted in the 1920 New Year Honours for his distinguished contributions to Colonial Egyptology and the British Museum. In the same year he published his sprawling autobiography, \"By Nile and Tigris\".\n\nHe retired from the British Museum in 1924, and lived until 1934. He continued to write and published several books; his last work was \"From Fetish to God in Ancient Egypt\" (1934).\n\nIn his will, in remembrance of his wife, Budge established and endowed the Lady Wallis Budge Junior Research Fellowships and graduate scholarships at Cambridge and Oxford universities. These continue to support young Egyptologists at the beginning of their research careers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1881159", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1881159", "title": "Charitable choice", "text": "Charitable choice\n\nCharitable choice refers to direct United States government funding of religious organizations to provide social services.\n\nCreated in 1996, charitable choice allows government officials to purchase services from religious providers using Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), Welfare-to-Work, and Community Services Block Grant (CSBG) funds. In late 2000, charitable choice was included in the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration’s (SAMHSA) block grant.\n\nCharitable Choice has gained support from policymakers due to its unique approach to social services. In this faith-based model or the so-called holistic relief (also known as whole person ministry), a religious organization addresses the needs of the poor both on the material and spiritual levels. The element of faith in the social service framework does not necessarily mean a focus on specific religious program or initiatives based on a specific religious denomination. Proponents of the concept explain that instead, it pertains to a broad religious framework wherein all religious forms are included in providing social support. \n\nAccording to the Department of Health and Human Services, Charitable Choice rests on four major principles:\n\nFaith-based providers are eligible to provide federally-funded social services on the same basis as any other providers, neither excluded nor included because they are religious, too religious or of a different religion.\n\nThe religious character of faith-based providers is protected by allowing them to retain control over the definition, development, practice, and expression of their religious beliefs. Neither federal nor state government can require a religious provider to alter its form of internal governance or remove religious art, icons, scripture or other symbols in order to be a program participant.\n\nIn regard to rendering assistance, religious organization shall not discriminate against an individual on the basis of religion, a religious belief, or refusal to actively participate in a religious practice. If an individual objects to the religious character of a program, a secular alternative must be provided.\n\nAll government funds must be used to fulfill the public social service goals, and no direct government funding can be diverted to inherently religious activities such as worship, sectarian instruction, and proselytization.\n\nSome are concerned that charitable choice blurs the separation of church and state and argue that federal financial support of faith-based organizations creates an opportunity for abuse and a potential for funds to flow in a biased way towards groups affiliated with one particular denomination or religious tradition. Specifically, critics argue that it violates the religion clause of the First Amendment. Some examples of lawsuits that raised this issue were the cases that challenged the constitutionality of the Charitable Choice programs in Texas and Kentucky. \n\nIn addition, some religious organization such as the Interfaith Alliance are concerned about the impact of charitable choice \"on the vitality of the prophetic voice of faith, the integrity of religious autonomy, excessive government entanglement in the affairs of religious institutions and the overarching temptation to abuse religion and manipulate faith to achieve political power.\"\n\nOn the other hand, the U.S. Supreme Court has increasingly taken a permissive position with respect to the constitutionality of the Charitable Choice. In several decisions, it established a relaxation of the constraints imposed and assumptions made with respect to public funding of the secular initiatives of religious organizations.\n"}

The anime was licensed in North America through a partnership between Toei and Geneon USA. However, only a few episodes of the series were released in the region before the cancellation of the deal, which was due to the poor quality and large number of DVD returns to Geneon.\n\nBehind the scenes of the hustle and bustle of everyday life in Tokyo, there exist many people who strive to become stronger by competing against each other in street fights. The main protagonist is Maki Aikawa, a 16-year-old high school student. A former gymnast, Maki adapts her skills to a different way of life — street fighting. The only thing that truly makes her feel alive is the rush and pressure experienced while fighting. With amazing power and grace, she fights opponent after opponent, repeatedly demonstrating the gymnastic talent that earns her her street name, \"Airmaster\". Eventually, Maki is exposed to a fighting league of sorts, known as the Fukamichi Rankings.\n\nThe Fukamichi Rankings consist of the world's greatest street fighters and martial artists. The Fukamichi Ranking fights are held for various reasons. Firstly, many fighters wish to test themselves, achieving the highest rank possible and stretching themselves to their physical limits. However, there is also a corporate side to the Fukamichi rankings, with many viewers around the world eager to watch the brutal yet awe-inspiring showdowns. Each Fukamichi ranker is paid a respective amount for winning within their fight. Maki, seeking to quench her thirst for that pressure or buzz she experiences only through fighting and to find her place within this world, scales the Fukamichi Rankings, clashing with the world's greatest fighting prodigies.\n\n\n\"Air Master\" was serialized in the Hakusensha magazine \"Young Animal\" from 1997 to 2006. The individual chapters have been collected into 28 \"tankōbon\", which were published between July 29, 1997, to May 29, 2006.\n\nAn anime adaptation of \"Air Master\" was produced by Toei Animation, directed by Daisuke Nishio, and originally aired on Japan's Nippon Television from April 1 to September 23, 2003. The episodes were compiled onto nine separate DVDs, which were released in Japan by VAP between July 24, 2003, and March 24, 2004. Each DVD contains three episodes and a bonus \"yonkoma\" by manga author Yokusaru Shibata.\n\nGeneon Entertainment had signed an agreement with Toei to license an English-dubbed version of the anime in the United States and Canada. It was also announced that the series would air on the Canadian cable channel Razer, though it never earned a timeslot and was cancelled before broadcast. Ultimately only three DVDs of \"Air Master\" were released in North America, with the fourth and fifth being solicited but cancelled due to an abrupt termination of partnership between the two companies. Region 1 DVDs for the anime, along with two other Toei titles, received very little advertising and suffered from poor quality, resulting in dismal sales and a large number of returns to Geneon. In 2009, Funimation gained the rights to \"Air Master\" and began streaming it on the company's official website. The anime was also streamed on Joost.\n\n"}
{"id": "1881167", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1881167", "title": "Stellate ganglion", "text": "Stellate ganglion\n\nThe stellate ganglion (or cervicothoracic ganglion) is a sympathetic ganglion formed by the fusion of the inferior cervical ganglion and the first thoracic ganglion, which exists in 80% of cases. Sometimes the second and the third thoracic ganglia are included in this fusion. Stellate ganglion is relatively big (10-12 x 8-20 mm) compared to much smaller thoracic, lumbar and sacral ganglia and it is polygonal in shape (L. stellatum = star-shaped). Stellate ganglion is located at the level of C7, anterior to the transverse process of C7 and the neck of the first rib, superior to the cervical pleura and just below the subclavian artery. It is superiorly covered by the prevertebral lamina of the cervical fascia and anteriorly in relation with common carotid artery, subclavian artery and the beginning of vertebral artery which sometimes leaves a groove at the apex of this ganglion (this groove can sometimes even separate the stellate ganglion into so called vertebral ganglion). \n\nRelations of the apex of the stellate ganglion:\n\nThe stellate ganglia may be cut in order to decrease the symptoms exhibited by Raynaud's phenomenon and hyperhydrosis (extreme sweating) of the hands. Injection of local anesthetics near the stellate ganglion can sometimes mitigate the symptoms of sympathetically mediated pain such as complex regional pain syndrome type I (reflex sympathetic dystrophy), and PTSD. Injection is often given near the Chassaignac's Tubercle (anterior tubercle of transverse process of C6) due to this being an important landmark lateral to the cricoid cartilage. It is thought that anesthetic is spread along the paravertebral muscles to the stellate ganglion.\n\nStellate ganglion block also shows great potential as a means of reducing the number of hot flushes and night awakenings suffered by breast cancer survivors and women experiencing extreme menopause. The Stellate Ganglion \nBlocks done by the military in Veteran with CRPS had an interesting side effect, a large percentage of veterans with PTSD had Spontaneous Elimination of PTSG. This has led it to be called \"The God Block\" This has led to 200 million dollar study in the VA to study this further. Nerve fibers from the Stellate Ganglion go up the superior cervical sympathetic chain and into the Pterygopalatine (Sphenopalatine) Ganglion (SPG) SPG blocks have been shown to reduce anxiety, headaches, migraines, cancer pain and other disorders. (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30973097)\nSelf-Adminiostration of SPG Blocks is the most effective method of delivering Sphenopalatine Blocks or Indirect Stellate Ganglion Blocks.\n\nComplications associated with a stellate ganglion block include Horner's syndrome, accidental intra-arterial or intravenous injection, difficulty swallowing, vocal cord paralysis, epidural spread of local anaesthetic, and pneumothorax.\n\nBlunt needling of the stellate ganglion with an acupuncture needle is used in traditional Chinese medicine to decrease sympathetically mediated symptoms as well.\n\nBlock of the stellate ganglion has also been explored in coronary artery bypass surgery, as well as posttraumatic stress disorder.\n\nLeft stellectomy is a treatment strategy in prolonged QT syndrome because activity of the stellate ganglia drives prolonged QT. However, this therapy is only offered to patients who are already on a beta blocker and experience frequent shocks from an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), because stellectomy causes Horner's syndrome.\n\nThe stellate ganglion lies in front of the neck of the first rib. The vertebral artery lies anterior to the ganglion as it has just originated from the subclavian artery. After passing over the ganglion, the artery enters the vertebral foramen and lies posterior to the anterior tubercle of C6 (Chassaignac's Tubercle).\n"}
{"id": "1881169", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1881169", "title": "Herod Archelaus", "text": "Herod Archelaus\n\nHerod Archelaus (, \"Hērǭdēs Archelaos\"; 23 BC – c. 18 AD) was ethnarch of Samaria, Judea, and Idumea (biblical Edom), including the cities Caesarea and Jaffa, for a period of nine years (c. 4 BC to 6 AD). Archelaus was removed by Roman Emperor Augustus when Judaea province was formed under direct Roman rule, at the time of the Census of Quirinius. He was the son of Herod the Great and Malthace the Samaritan, and was the brother of Herod Antipas, and the half-brother of Herod II. Archelaus (a name meaning \"leading the people\") came to power after the death of his father Herod the Great in 4 BC, and ruled over one-half of the territorial dominion of his father.\n\nJosephus writes that Herod the Great (father of Archelaus) was in Jericho at the time of his death. Just prior to his final trip to Jericho, he was deeply involved in a religious conflagration. Herod had placed a golden eagle over the Temple entrance which was perceived as blasphemous. The eagle was chopped down with axes. Two teachers and approximately 40 other youths were arrested for this act and immolated. Herod defended his works and offered an attack on his predecessors, the dynastic Hasmoneans. Herod killed all male lineal successors of the Hasmoneans. The Pharisees had long attacked the Hasmoneans as well, as having parentage from Greeks while under bondage. This racial slur was repeated by the Pharisees through the rule of Alexander Jannaeus and Queen Salome.\n\nWith this explicit background given, Josephus began an exposition of the days of Archelaus' reign before Passover of 4 BC. Archelaus dressed in white and ascended a golden throne and appeared to be kind to the populace in Jerusalem in order to appease their desires for lower taxes and an end to the (political) imprisonment of Herod's enemies. The demeanor of the questioning appeared to turn at some point, and the crowd began to call for the punishment of those of Herod's people who ordered the death of the two teachers and the 40 youths. They also demanded the replacement of the High Priest, from the appointed High Priest of Herod's to a High Priest, \"of greater piety and purity\". Josephus does not tell who would be \"of greater piety and purity\". To this request, however, Archelaus acceded, although he was becoming angry at the presumptions of the crowds. Archelaus asked for moderation and told the crowds that all would be well if they would put aside their animosities and wait until he was confirmed as King by Caesar Augustus.\n\nArchelaus then left to feast with his friends. It was evening and as the darkness settled, a mourning and wailing begin over the city. Archelaus began to worry as people begin streaming into the Temple area and those who wailed for loss of the teachers continued their very loud mourning. The people were escalating in their threatening behavior. Henry St. John Thackeray's translation of Josephus here states it thus: \"The promoters of the mourning for the doctors stood in the body of the temple, procuring recruits for their faction\". Josephus does not tell us who these \"promoters of the mourning\", who recruit from within a body inside the Temple, could be.\n\nArchelaus then sent a general, some other people and finally a \"tribune in Command of a Cohort\" to reason with these \"Seditionists\", to stop their \"innovations\" and wait until Archelaus could return from Rome and Caesar. Those who came from Archelaus were stoned, with many killed. After the stoning, those who stoned the soldiers returned to their sacrifices, as if nothing had happened. Josephus does not tell who performed the sacrifices in the Temple. It was after midnight, and Archelaus suddenly ordered the entire army into the city to the Temple. Josephus records the death toll at 3000. Archelaus sent heralds around the city announcing the cancellation of Passover.\n\nArchelaus quickly sailed to Caesar and faced a group of enemies – his own family. Antipas, the younger brother of Archelaus who was deposed from Herod's will days earlier, argued that Archelaus merely feigned grief for his father, crying during the day and involved with great \"merriment\" during the nights. The threats carried out by Archelaus ending in the death of 3000 in the Temple were not just threats to the worshipers in Jerusalem at Passover, but also amounted to a threat to Caesar himself, since Archelaus acted in every manner a King, before such title had been given by Caesar.\n\nAt this point, Nicolaus of Damascus argued to Caesar that Archelaus acted appropriately and that Herod's will, supposedly written a few weeks prior (yielding the kingship to Archelaus and against Antipater), should be seen as valid. The change of this will in favor of Archelaus is given as Herod's true choice and, it is argued, occurred with Herod being in his right mind since he left the final decision to Caesar. The change of the will appears as one of Herod's last acts and it is attested from Jericho by one \"Ptolemy\", keeper of Herod's Seal. Nicholaus of Damascus had been Herod's confidant for years. He was loyal to Rome. Ptolemy was Nicholaus of Damascus' brother.\n\nArchelaus, at the conclusion of the arguments, fell at Caesar's feet. Caesar raised him up and stated that Archelaus \"was worthy to succeed his father\". Caesar gave Archelaus the title of Ethnarch and divided the kingdom. Rome would consolidate its power later.\n\nThus, Archelaus received the Tetrarchy of Judea through the last will of his father, though a previous will had bequeathed it to his brother Antipas. He was proclaimed king by the army, but declined to assume the title until he had submitted his claims to Caesar Augustus in Rome. In Rome he was opposed by Antipas and by many of the Jews, who feared his cruelty, based on the murder of 3000; but in 4 BC Augustus allotted to him the greater part of the kingdom (Samaria, Judea, and Idumea) with the title of \"ethnarch\" (a ruler of an ethnic group).\n\nThe first wife of Archelaus is given by Josephus simply as Mariamne, perhaps Mariamne III, daughter of Aristobulus IV, whom he divorced to marry Glaphyra. She was the widow of Archelaus' brother Alexander, though her second husband, Juba, king of Mauretania, was alive. This violation of the Mosaic law, along with Archelaus' continued cruelty, roused the ire of the Jews, who complained to Augustus. Archelaus fell into disrepute and was deposed in his 10th year of reign as ethnarch, being banished to Vienna (today Vienne) in Gaul. Samaria, Judea proper, and Idumea became the Roman province of Iudaea.\n\nArchelaus is mentioned in the Gospel of Matthew (chapter 2 –). An angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and told him to get up and take Mary and Jesus and flee to Egypt to avoid the Massacre of the Innocents. When Herod the Great died, Joseph was told by an angel in a dream to return to the land of Israel (presumably to Bethlehem). However, upon hearing that Archelaus had succeeded his father as ruler of Judaea he \"was afraid to go there\" (), and was again warned in a dream by God \"and turned aside to the region of\" Galilee. This is Matthew's explanation of why Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea but grew up in Nazareth.\n\nThe beginning and conclusion of Jesus' parable of the minas in the Gospel of Luke, chapter 19, may refer to Archelaus' journey to Rome. Some interpreters conclude from this that Jesus' parables and preaching made use of events familiar to the people as examples for bringing his spiritual lessons to life. Others read the allusion as arising from later adaptations of Jesus' parables in the oral tradition, before the parables were recorded in the gospels.\n\nA nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom and then return ... But his citizens hated him and sent a delegation after him, saying, \"We do not want this man to reign over us.\" ... \"But as for these enemies of mine,\" [said the nobleman,] \"who did not want me to reign over them, bring them here and slaughter them before me.\" (, , )\n\n"}

In a racing career which lasted from October 2000 until October 2001 he ran eight times and won six races. He is best known for winning The Derby, Irish Derby Stakes, and King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes in 2001 and for his rivalry with the Godolphin champion Fantastic Light. He was named the European Champion Three-Year-Old Colt of 2001.\n\nSince his retirement, Galileo has become one of the most sought after sires in the world. He first became the leading sire in Great Britain and Ireland in 2008, then consecutively earned the title from 2010 through 2019. In 2019, he tied the record for the number of Epsom Derby winners sired at four: New Approach, Ruler Of The World, Australia and Anthony Van Dyck. In 2019, he also tied Danehill for the all-time record of Group/Grade I winners sired with 84. In addition to his Derby winners, his notable offspring including Frankel, Nathaniel, Found, Churchill and Minding. He is also a leading broodmare sire and an emerging sire of sires.\n\nGalileo is a bay horse with a narrow white blaze and a white sock on his near hind leg. He was sired by Sadler's Wells out of the mare Urban Sea. His breeders were David Tsui, the owner of Urban Sea, and \"Orpendale\", a name used by the Coolmore Stud organisation for some of their breeding interests. He was described as a three-year-old as being \"one of the most impeccably bred horses in training\".\n\nSadler's Wells (1981-2011) won three Group One races in 1984 and went on to sire the winners of over 2,000 races, including more than 130 at Group One/Grade I level. He was the most successful sire in the history of British racing, being the leading sire in Great Britain and Ireland a record 14 times. Urban Sea (1989-2009) won the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe in 1993 and went on to become an outstanding broodmare. Apart from Galileo, she was the dam of the Derby winner Sea The Stars, and the Grade I winners Black Sam Bellamy (Tattersalls Gold Cup) and My Typhoon (Diana Stakes), as well as All Too Beautiful (Group race winner, Group One placed) and Melikah (Listed race winner, Group One placed).\n\nOwned by Sue Magnier and Michael Tabor, Galileo was sent into training by Aidan O'Brien at Ballydoyle and ridden in all but one of his races by Michael Kinane.\n\nGalileo is known for his relaxed, professional behaviour and even temperament. Noel Stapleton, his long-time handler at Coolmore Stud, calls him a creature of habit. \"He is a true gentleman,\" said Stapleton, \"and I think he knows how important he is.\"\n\nHe is one of several horses to have borne the name of Galileo. The most notable \"other\" Galileo was a Polish-bred gelding which won the Grade I RSA Novices' Hurdle at the 2002 Cheltenham Festival.\n\nGalileo did not appear on the racecourse until late October 2000, when he was entered in a sixteen-runner maiden race at Leopardstown. He was made the even-money favourite, despite the field containing two runners each from the stables of the leading Irish trainers John Oxx and Jim Bolger. Mick Kinane tracked the leaders on Galileo before sending the colt into the lead in the straight. Although there were less than two furlongs to the finish, Galileo extended his lead fourteen lengths by the end of the race.\n\nAs a three-year-old, Galileo was conditioned for a middle-distance campaign and was aimed at Derby trial races in spring. On his debut, he was made 1/3 favourite for the Listed Ballysax Stakes over a mile and a quarter at Leopardstown. Racing smoothly throughout the race, he took the lead two furlongs out and won \"easily\" by three and a half lengths. Runner-up Milan went on to win the St Leger and finish second in the Breeders' Cup Turf, while the third-placed Vinnie Roe won four consecutive Irish St Legers. After the race, Galileo was offered at odds of 8/1 for the Derby. O'Brien was satisfied with the performance, especially as he believed the colt was some way from peak fitness (\"[my horses]...are as big as bulls\") and likely to improve.\n\nGalileo had his third race at Leopardstown in May as he was stepped up in class for the Group Three Derrinstown Stud Derby Trial. He was made odds-on favourite, and was ridden for the first and only time by Seamie Heffernan, as Kinane was riding Milan in the Group One Prix Lupin on the same day. Galileo took the lead a furlong from home and stayed on to beat the John Oxx-trained Exaltation by one and a half lengths. Although Heffernan put Galileo under pressure before going clear, the colt's Derby odds were cut to 5-1.\n\nAt Epsom, Galileo started 11/4 joint-favourite alongside the 2,000 Guineas winner Golan. The 2001 Epsom Derby field was strong, with Tobougg, the previous year's champion two-year-old, and the winners of most of the major Derby trials, including Mr Combustible (Chester Vase), Dilshaan (Dante Stakes) and Perfect Sunday (Lingfield Derby Trial), all taking part. Kinane positioned Galileo just behind the leaders and turned into the straight in third behind Mr Combustible and Perfect Sunday. Two furlongs from the finish, Galileo moved past Mr Combustible and quickly went clear to record an \"impressive\" three and a half length victory over Golan, Tobougg and Mr Combustible. Following the race, Timeform assigned a figure of 130 to Galileo, making him, in their opinion, the best Derby winner for ten years. Kinane was reported to have called Galileo the best horse he had ridden, saying, \"There is no weakness to him... He is a dream to ride.\"\n\nIn the Irish Derby at The Curragh, three weeks later, Galileo was made favourite at odds of 4/11, with Golan and Exaltation the only other horses starting at less than 20/1. Galileo led two furlongs from the finish and quickly went clear. Although Kinane eased the colt down in the closing stages, he won by four lengths from the Derby Italiano winner Morshdi, with Golan another four lengths back in third. Kinane, who was winning his first Irish Derby in seventeen attempts said that he was always in \"complete control\", while Morshdi's jockey, Philip Robinson described the winner as \"a freak\".\n\nGalileo was then tested against older horses in the King George VI & Queen Elizabeth Diamond Stakes at Ascot in July. The betting suggested that the race would be a match between Galileo (1/2 favourite) and the Godolphin five-year-old Fantastic Light (7-2), who had won Group One races in four different countries. Such were the reputations of these two horses that the third choice in the betting, the Prix du Jockey Club winner Anabaa Blue, started at 18/1. Kinane took Galileo to the lead two furlongs out, but Frankie Dettori soon brought Fantastic Light to challenge. The horses raced together for a few strides before Galileo pulled ahead inside the final furlong and won by two lengths. Marcus Townend, writing in the Daily Mail, described Galileo as the best horse in Europe and praised his \"determination\" and \"lightning acceleration.\"\n\nGalileo returned to Leopardstown in September for a much-anticipated Irish Champion Stakes in which he was matched against Fantastic Light again, this time over the shorter distance of one and a quarter miles. O'Brien entered Ice Dancer in the race to act as pacemaker and ensure a stamina test. The plan failed as the rest of the riders ignored Ice Dancer, who went ten lengths clear before stopping abruptly in the straight. Fantastic Light took the lead two furlongs out, and Kinane immediately moved Galileo up to join him. The two horses raced side by side throughout the last quarter of the mile, with the advantage appearing to fluctuate between them. On the line, Fantastic Light defeated Galileo by a head in a photo finish. The race has been described as one of the most exciting and memorable in the modern history of the sport. O'Brien praised the winner, but felt that he had \"messed up\" tactically.\n\nFor his final race, Galileo was sent to Belmont Park for the Breeders' Cup Classic. He was racing on dirt for the first time, although before traveling he was prepared by exercising on the artificial surface at Southwell. The Classic was expected to feature a third meeting between Galileo and Fantastic Light, but the Godolphin horse was switched to the Turf shortly before the race. In the Classic, Galileo raced behind the leaders for most of the way but was unable to quicken, staying on at the same pace to finish sixth of the fourteen runners behind Tiznow.\n\nGalileo's retirement was announced immediately after the race.\n\nGalileo was named European Champion Three-Year-Old at the Cartier Racing Awards.\n\nIn the 2001 International Classification (the forerunner of the World Thoroughbred Racehorse Rankings), Galileo was assessed at 129 (equal with Fantastic Light), making him the third highest rated horse behind Sakhee and Point Given.\n\nGalileo was given a final Timeform rating of 134.\n\nGalileo was retired to stand as a stallion for the Coolmore Stud. He originally operated as a \"shuttle\" stallion, standing at Coolmore's main farm at Fethard, County Tipperary Ireland during the Northern Hemisphere breeding season and moving to its Australian branch in the Hunter Region, New South Wales for the Southern Hemisphere breeding season. However, since 2012, he has stood exclusively in Ireland.\n\nGalileo was the leading sire in Great Britain and Ireland in 2008 and from 2010 to 2019. Since 2008, his stud fee has since been privately negotiated, but he is reputed to be the most expensive stallion in the world. For breeders who are not associates of Coolmore Stud, the fee has \"long been north of €400,000\" and suggested to be as high as €600,000 in 2018.\n\n, he had sired 192 group winners. In August 2018, Sizzling gave Galileo his 328th European group race win as a sire, taking him past the record previously held by his own sire Sadler's Wells.\n\nOn 9 November 2019, Magic Wand became his 84th individual Group/Grade One winner, putting him level with Danehill for most such winners sired. Anthony Van Dyck became his fourth Epsom Derby winner in 2019 (with New Approach, Ruler Of The World, and Australia). This ties him with Cyllene, Waxy, Sir Peter Teazle, Blandford and Montjeu for the number of Derby winners sired. After Minding's victory in the 2016 1000 Guineas, Galileo became the sire of winners of all five British Classics. In the 2016 Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe, he sired the top three finishers (Found, Highland Reel and Order of St George). In the 2019 Derby, he was the sire, grandsire or great-grandsire of 12 out of 13 runners, and was the broodmare sire of the 13th.\n\nIn September 2008, Galileo underwent surgery for colic.\n\n\"c = colt, f = filly\", g = gelding\"\n\n† Noble Mission was awarded the Grand Prix de Saint-Cloud, after another Galileo son called Spiritjim was demoted from first after it was found that he tested positive for banned substances.\n\n‡ Gleneagles was demoted from first to third in the 2014 Prix Jean-Luc Lagardère, after stewards deemed him to have interfered with the horse that finished second (Full Mast) and third (Territories).\n\nSeveral of Galileo's sons have also begun to make an impact as stallions. In 2018, Frankel finished fourth on the leading sire list, while Nathaniel finished fifth. New Approach was the sire of 2018 Derby winner Masar, while Teofilo sired Melbourne Cup winner Cross Counter.\n\nEntered stud in 2008.\n\nEntered stud in 2009. \n\nEntered stud in 2010. Standing at Haras Du Logis Saint Germain in France, shuttling to Southern America.\n\nEntered stud in 2011. \n\nEntered stud in 2013. \n\nEntered stud in 2013.\n\nLike his sire Galileo has become a sire of excellent broodmares whose offspring have achieved Group 1 success.\n\n"}
{"id": "1881178", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1881178", "title": "Lammtarra", "text": "Lammtarra\n\nLammtarra (2 February 1992 7 July 2014) was an undefeated Thoroughbred racehorse who won three Group One races in 1995 and was voted the Cartier Three-Year-Old European Champion Colt. He won The Derby in record time, the King and Queen Elizabeth Stakes and the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. He is one of only two horses to win all three races, the other being Mill Reef.\n\nThe colt was owned by Saeed bin Maktoum al Maktoum, whose father, Sheikh Maktoum, bred Lammtarra at his Gainsborough Farm in Versailles, Kentucky. He was sired by Nijinsky by Northern Dancer out of The Oaks winner, Snow Bride by Blushing Groom (FR). He was inbred to Northern Dancer in the second and fourth generations (2m x 4f).\n\nLammtarra won his only race as a two-year-old, in the Washington Singer Stakes at Newbury. As a three-year-old, Lammtarra was trained for the Derby as his main target.\n\nLammtarra's Epsom Derby triumph in June 1995 came just months after the tragic fatal shooting of his young trainer Alex Scott. Scott was killed at his Newmarket stud in September 1994, at the age of 34.\n\nBefore his death, Scott had been dreaming of Epsom glory with a two-year-old colt in his care. Indeed, he was so confident of Classic success that he backed the horse before it started, placing £1,000 at 33/1 with Ladbrokes. But after the death of his trainer, the colt was sent to Sheikh Mohammed's Godolphin operation to continue his career.\nHowever, Lammtarra very nearly didn't get to the Derby at all. During the early part of the season, he was a sick horse and his participation was in grave doubt. When he arrived at Epsom on the big day, it was for his seasonal reappearance and his first run in 302 days.\n\nLammtarra was at 14/1 odds to emulate his sire 25 years earlier, with Walter Swinburn as his jockey. The market was dominated by Andre Fabre's impressive 2,000 Guineas winner Pennekamp (11/8). Second favourite was Peter Chapple-Hyam's Spectrum (11/4), an easy winner of the Irish 2,000 Guineas.\n\nAs the field rounded Tattenham Corner, Lammtarra was stuck on the rails towards the rear of the field. With two furlongs left, Walter Swinburn got clear and Lammtarra gathered speed. Frankie Dettori's swoop on 9-1 shot Tamure had seemed certain to carry him to victory, but Lammtarra quickly made up at least six lengths in the last one and a half furlongs. He overtook Tamure deep inside the final furlong and won going away by a length. There were emotional scenes in the winner's enclosure afterwards, as Swinburn and Sheikh Mohammed paid tribute to Alex Scott. Normally, bookmakers will cancel a bet if the person placing it dies. However, Ladbrokes let Scott's ante-post bet on Lammtarra stand and paid the winnings to his widow.\n\nThe official time for the race was two minutes 32.21 seconds, 1.53 seconds inside the previous Derby best. This time stood for 15 years until 2010, when it was beaten by Workforce with a time of two minutes 31.33s.\n\nLammtarra's next appearance was in the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Ascot. He had a new jockey for this race, Frankie Dettori having replaced Swinburn. A couple of furlongs into the race, Dettori started to improve Lammtarra's position, but trainer Geoff Wragg's Pentire moved up on his outside, seemingly with plenty in hand. Pentire went to the front but only briefly as Lammtarra rallied to get his head back in front and take victory. After the race, Dettori said his mount had the heart of a lion. The horse ran just once more on a racecourse - in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe at Longchamp.\n\nLammtarra next won the Group One, Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe at Longchamp in France. Dettori settled him just off the pace, then rode him to the lead just over two furlongs out. Challengers queued up to take a shot at the English horse, but all failed. Dettori drove Lammtarra home and at the line the 21/10 favourite had three-quarters of a length to spare over Freedom Cry, with Swain two lengths further back in third. Jockey, Dettori said Lammtarra was \"possibly\" the best horse he's ever ridden. \"Maybe Lammtarra is the best, because he remained unbeaten...\".\n\nLammtarra was sent to stud undefeated with a high value. He was tested in only four races and was one of the most lightly raced Derby winners in history.\n\nLammtarra stood his first season at Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum's Dalham Hall Stud near Newmarket. At the end of the 1996 breeding season, he was sold to Japanese breeders for $30 million to stand at the largest stallion farm in the Hidaka area for a stud fee of £30,000. His offspring met with limited success and his fee was reduced later to £2,500 with a live foal guarantee. The best of his ofspring were probably the Japanese Grade 3 winners Maruka Senryo and Meisho Ramses. Although the foals have not been great performers, mares sired by him are highly sought after, due to Lammtarra's excellent bloodlines. In August 2006, it was announced that Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum had bought back Lammtarra from Japan's Arrow Stud and would return to Dalham Hall Stud to live out his days in retirement. On 7 July 2014 it was announced that Lammtarra had died at Dalham Hall the previous day at the age of twenty-two.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1881181", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1881181", "title": "Vračar", "text": "Vračar\n\nVračar (, ) is a municipality of the city of Belgrade. According to the 2011 census results, the municipality has a population of 56,333 inhabitants.\n\nWith an area of only 291 hectares, it is the smallest of all Belgrade's (and Serbian) municipalities, but also the most densely populated. Vračar is one of the three municipalities that constitute the very center area of Belgrade, together with Savski Venac and Stari Grad. It is an affluent municipality, having one of the most expensive real estate prices within Belgrade, and has the highest proportion of university educated inhabitants compared to all other Serbian municipalities. One of the most famous landmarks in Belgrade, the Saint Sava Temple is located in Vračar.\n\nVračar borders five other Belgrade municipalities: Voždovac to the south, Zvezdara to the east, Palilula to the northeast, Stari Grad to the north and Savski Venac to the west. It is generally bounded by the three boulevards: Boulevard of Liberation, Southern Boulevard and the Boulevard of King Aleksandar.\n\nThough today the smallest municipality of Belgrade, historically Vračar occupied much larger territory. It was divided in three parts: East Vračar, which roughly occupies the modern municipality, West Vračar which is today a local community (sub-municipal unit) within the municipality of Savski Venac and Great Vračar, which is today known as Zvezdara, though the local community of Vračarsko Polje (Vračar Field) retained its name within the Zvezdara municipality.\n\nThe neighborhood of Vračar is located on the top of the Vračar plateau, partially in the easternmost section of the municipality of Savski Venac as a result of a series of administrative changes of municipal boundaries after World War II. Despite its small area, being located less than a kilometer away from downtown (Terazije) it borders many other Belgrade neighborhoods: the square and neighborhood of Slavija to the north, Palilula to the northeast, Čubura and Gradić Pejton to the east, Neimar to the south and the park and neighborhood of Karađorđev Park to the southwest. \n\nWith , Vračar plateau is one of the highest points in downtown Belgrade, which is generally built on a hilly terrain (32 hills altogether). The top of the hill was flattened and turned into the plateau when earth from the top was used to cover and drain the pond on Slavija, in the western foothills of the Vračar hill. Almost no geographical features survive today as the area is completely urbanized, except for the small section of Karađorđev Park on the southern slopes of the plateau. Some much larger parks, like major portion of Karađorđev Park or parks Manjež and Tašmajdan are left just outside the Vračar's administrative borders.\n\nThe most dominant feature of modern Vračar is the massive Temple of Saint Sava. Its decades long, troubled construction shaped not only the present appearance of the plateau but also the entire skyline of Belgrade. The plateau has been reshaped in the early 2000s, with fountains, marble access roads to the temple with pillars, and playgrounds added, while the already existing monument to the leader of the First Serbian Uprising, Karađorđe, was erected on a low, artificial hillock. The plateau is also the location of the National Library of Serbia and Karađorđev Park begins here, with the craftsmen settlement of Gradić Pejton and the bohemian quarter of Čubura nearby.\n\nVračar (derived from Serbian word \"vrač\" meaning the 'medicine man', 'healer') was first mentioned in 1440, during the siege of Belgrade by the Ottoman sultan Murad II. Ottoman map from 1492 mentions Vračar as a tower. In 1560 it is mentioned as the Christian village outside the fortress of Kalemegdan with 17 houses. It is believed this village is the place where in 1595 the Turkish grand vizier Sinan Pasha burned at the stake the remains of Saint Sava, a major Serbian saint, to pacify and punish a rebellious population.\n\nAt the beginning of the 19th century Vračar, as a geographical term, referred to a much wider area, from the village of Savamala (present Mostar) on the west to the village of Paliula (present neighborhood of Karaburma), which means it used to cover at least three times larger territory than the municipality covers today. By order of prince Miloš Obrenović, an alternative city centre with western characteristics was designed and built here while city of Belgrade was still under Turkish rule and for three quarters an oriental town with all the characteristics of Islamic architecture. On the other hand, Vračar was built with broad streets and boulevards, first parks and monuments. It was housing all Serbian public buildings and state institutions in Belgrade, known as a place where the remains of the Serbian Saint Archbishop Sava Nemanjic were burned by Turks. The Masonic Temple on this site was destroyed during the German bombing of Belgrade on 6 April 1941. Today, it is the site of the biggest Christian Orthodox Cathedral in the world.\n\n\"The Times\" on October 17, 1843 published a text full of exultations. 'Four years have passed since the time when I was last here, and how Belgrade has changed! I have hardly recognised it. The high belfry on the church (Cathedral) now screens by its shadow the Turkish mosques; many shops are now provided with new doors and glass windows, oriental clothing is more rare and houses with several storeys, in European manner, are being built everywhere'.\n\nMany architects-baumeisters (builders) Germans, Czechs, Italians and the Serbians who appeared only at the end of the 1860s built new Serbian Belgrade in Vračar. After 1867, when Turkish military garrisons left the Belgrade fortress Kalemegdan they extended their architectural activities on the ruins of the Turkish houses (Stambol gate, Dorćol, Palilula) and on the ruins of the Serbian huts in the Sava river port, Savamala.\n\nWhen Belgrade was divided into six quarters in 1860, Vračar was one of them. By the census of 1883 it had a population of 5,965.\n\nIn the eastern section of Vračar, on the border of the Kalenić, Čubura and Krunski Venac neighborhoods, a settlement of one-floor villas began to develop in the early 1920s. At that time, a tram line No. 1-a was passing through here, connecting downtown to Crveni Krst. As majority of the parcels were purchased by the army generals and their family members, the neighborhood became known as the \"Quarter of the Generals\" (Milivoje Zečević, Bogoljub Ilić, Svetislav Milosavljević, families Kocić, Lukić, Petrović, Đonović, etc.). The villas were later upgraded with additional floors and were given names (Villa Stana, Villa Kocić, Villa Ilić).\n\nSince the 1880s, the neighborhood was roughly divided into Zapadni Vračar (West Vračar) and Istočni Vračar (East Vračar), divided by the road of \"Šumadijski put\" (present Boulevard of Liberation). The municipality of Vračar was officially formed in 1952 after Belgrade was administratively reorganized from districts (\"rejon\") to municipalities. Already on September 1, 1955 Vračar was divided into Zapadni Vračar (West Vračar) and Istočni Vračar (East Vračar). Year and a half later, on January 1, 1957, parts of Istočni Vračar merged with the municipality of Neimar and the western part of the municipality of Terazije to create new, albeit the smallest municipality in Belgrade, Vračar. Zapadni Vračar became municipality of Savski Venac, while the easternmost section of Istočni Vračar became part of the municipality of Zvezdara (local community of Vračarsko Polje; Zvezdara hill itself was styled \"Veliki Vračar\" - Big Vračar).\n\nAs Vračar has a very small area by itself, its sub-neighborhoods are also small, some of them encompassing only a street or so:\n\nAs the other two central Belgrade municipalities, Stari Grad and Savski Venac, Vračar has been depopulating for the last five decades. Despite that, Vračar is by far, thanks to its small area, the most densely populated municipality of Belgrade, with 18,967 inhabitants per square kilometer (2011 census; 28,380 back in 1971).\n\nThe ethnic composition of the municipality:\nRecent presidents of the municipal assembly:\n\nMrs Dunja Vlahović (b. 1912), who was municipal president from January 1957 when Vračar was restored as one municipality, was one of the first female municipal presidents in Serbia.\n\nDistrict (Serbian: \"srez\") which comprised the suburban area of Belgrade after 1945 was called Vračar District (\"Vračarski srez\") though the name Belgrade District was also used. In 1955 the Vračar District merged with the City of Belgrade and parts of some bordering districts to create new, enlarged Belgrade District.\n\nThe following table gives a preview of total number of registered people employed in legal entities per their core activity (as of 2018):\n\nVračar is a residential and very important commercial part of Belgrade. The tall skyscraper in downtown Belgrade, the Beograđanka, Cvetni Trg (famous for its flower shops) and the square of Slavija occupy the western section of the municipality. Other important features are the Temple of Saint Sava and the National Library of Serbia on the Vračar plateau, northern section of the big interchange Autokomanda and the stadium of the FK Obilić (Miloš Obilić Stadium) and the Architecture high school in the extreme west of the municipality. Commercial center of the municipality is the area surrounding the Kalenić, largest open green market in Belgrade.\n\nThe \"Vračar plane tree\" is a tree in the \"Makenzijeva\" street, protected as the natural monument. It is a London plane, high in 2013 and is estimated to be planted circa 1860.\n\nVračar is twinned with following cities and municipalities:\n\n\n"}

By 1969, both were working musicians living in New York; while collaborating with folksinger Tim Hardin they were introduced to world music pioneer Paul Winter's \"Consort\" ensemble, particularly member Collin Walcott, with whom Towner began improvising as an informal duo. By 1970 Towner and Moore had joined the Winter Consort and met fellow member McCandless; the four began exploring improvisation on their own, while their contributions continued to be seminal in redefining the Winter Consort \"sound\" in compositions like Towner's \"Icarus\".\n\nThe four musicians made their first group recording in 1970, but the label, Increase Records, went out of business before it could be released (it eventually was issued by Vanguard in 1980 as \"Our First Record\"). Oregon made its \"formal\" debut in NYC in 1971 (originally named \"Thyme — Music of Another Present Era\", the name change to Oregon was suggested by McCandless).\n\nThe group's first release \"Music of Another Present Era\" was issued on Vanguard in 1972 (the four also recorded for ECM, though the recording, 1973's \"Trios Solos\", was billed as \"Ralph Towner with Glen Moore\"). With those initial recordings and the follow-ups \"Distant Hills\" (1973) and \"Winter Light\" (1974) (all on Vanguard), Oregon established itself as one of the leading improvisational groups of its day, blending Indian and Western classical music with jazz, folk, space music and avant-garde elements. The group released numerous albums on Vanguard throughout the 1970s, also making three records for Elektra/Asylum between 1978 and 1980 (including the highly acclaimed \"Out of the Woods\" and a live recording taken from performances at Carnegie Hall and in Canada in late 1979). \nAfter a couple years' hiatus devoted to individual projects (including the birth of Walcott's daughter in 1980), the group reassembled, recording for ECM, releasing the eponymous \"Oregon\" in 1983 and \"Crossing\" in 1984. Before the latter's release, however, during a 1984 tour Walcott was killed in an automobile accident in the former East Germany. Oregon temporarily disbanded, but regrouped in May 1985 at a memorial concert for Walcott in NYC, with Indian percussionist Trilok Gurtu sitting in (Walcott's own choice for his replacement should it become necessary). In 1986 Gurtu was invited to join Oregon; the band resumed touring and released three albums during his five years as a member.\n\nAfter Trilok Gurtu's departure, the group continued as a trio, issuing two albums during that period. The 1997 album \"Northwest Passage\" marked a return to the inclusion of percussion, featuring either drummer Mark Walker or Turkish Armenian percussionist Arto Tunçboyacıyan on most tracks; subsequently, Walker was taken on as a full member. In 1999 the ensemble traveled to Moscow, Russia to record with the Tchaikovsky Symphony Orchestra of Moscow Radio, premiering orchestral compositions that had been in development for years, some dating back to their first days with the Winter Consort; that project's 2000 release \"Oregon in Moscow\" garnered four Grammy nominations. 2002 saw the release of \"Live at Yoshi's\", recorded in San Francisco, the first live Oregon recording in two decades.\n\nIn March 2015, it was announced that Glen Moore was departing from the group, with bassist Paolino Dalla Porta replacing him.\n\nAs of 2019, Oregon has no further plans to exist as a touring ensemble.\n\non Vanguard\n\non Elektra\n\non ECM\n\non CBS /Portrait\n\non Intuition\n\non Chesky\n\non Intuition\n\non CamJazz\n\n"}

After working as a legal advisor in the Ministry of Justice, Flores began her professional activity independently. She was a professor of law and taught at the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru Law School and the University of Lima Law School between 1984 and 1989.\n\nStarting her political career at a young age as a member of the Christian People's Party (\"Partido Popular Cristiano\"), Flores would occupy the internal positions of national secretary of Electoral Affairs (1984–88), national secretary of Professionals (1987–89), national secretary of Politics (1989–92) and of General Collegiate secretary (1992–99), before being elected as chairwoman of the Christian People's Party in 2003 and re-elected in 2007. She was the first woman to become chairwoman of a political party in Peru.\n\nAfter a failed first candidacy to the Congress of the Republic at the age of 25, Flores was elected as a councilwoman of Lima in 1986 and re-elected in 1989, after aspiring to the office of Lieutenant Mayor of Lima. She became Deputy of the Republic in 1990, representing Lima. With the Alberto Fujimori's self-coup and the dissolution of the 1992 Parliament, Flores was elected member of the Democratic Constituent Congress in 1993 and re-elected as a Congresswoman in 1995, becoming a leader of the parliamentary opposition to the Fujimori administration. After the fall of the regime, Flores decided to run for President in 2001, finishing in third place with 24% of the national vote in the first round, behind Alejandro Toledo and Alan García. Flores undertook a second run for the presidency in 2006, again occupying the third place in the voting results after being overtaken by Alan García, who went to a run-off with Ollanta Humala. Flores is the first woman to be a major contender for the presidency in the history of Peru.\n\nFollowing her second presidential run, she assumed the position of chancellor of the San Ignacio de Loyola University from 2006 to 2009. She was a candidate for mayor of Lima in the municipal elections of Lima in 2010. She obtained the second place, being surpassed by her leftist rival, Susana Villarán, by a narrow margin. In 2016, she ran for Vice President in the Popular Alliance ticket, a heavily-criticized coalition between the Peruvian Aprista Party and the Christian People's Party for the presidential election of that year, receiving 5.83% of the voting and occupying the fifth place.\n\nFlores currently serves as the vice president of the Centrist Democrat International, a Christian democratic political international, and as a member of Washington D.C. based think tank, the Inter-American Dialogue.\n\nLourdes Flores was born in Lima on 7 October 1959. She studied at the Colegio ReIna de Los Ángeles and at the Pontificia Universidad Católica del Perú Law School. She pursued graduate studies in Madrid, earning a master in legal advice at Instituto de Empresa (currently known as IE Business School) and a doctorate in law at the Universidad Complutense. As an independent lawyer, Flores specialized in civil and business law. In 1992, Flores attended the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. She later taught commercial law at the Pontificia Universidad Católica del Perú and the University of Lima. She served for two years as chancellor of the Universidad San Ignacio de Loyola.\n\nAt age 18, Flores joined the Christian People's Party (PPC), a center-right branch of the Christian Democracy movement founded in 1966. She was an assistant to Enrique Elías Larosa, who became Minister of Justice.\n\nFlores was elected Deputy from Lima to the Congress of the Republic in 1990 with more than 250 000 votes. During that election, the PPC formed part of the FREDEMO front backing Mario Vargas Llosa for president.\n\nShe opposed the 1992 \"self-coup\" of President Alberto Fujimori, organizing congressional meetings in her home. She was elected to the Democratic Constitutional Congress later that year and re-elected to Congress in 1995.\n\nShe denounced Fujimori's holding of Japanese citizenship in 1997 and opposed the activities of his security chief, Vladimiro Montesinos.\n\nIn the year 2000, Flores founded the National Unity coalition, with a center-right tendency, in order to create a single front to run for the Peruvian presidency in the 2001 general election.\n\nFacing sexism and misogyny, she led the opinion polls for several weeks, but got the third place with 24.3% of the votes, being overtaken by Alejandro Toledo and Alan García, who would face each other in a second round in which Toledo would win. The unfortunate comment of his father, César Flores, referring to Alejandro Toledo a few weeks after the first round, would be detrimental to the candidacy of Lourdes Flores, according to analysts, as being considered pejorative and discriminatory.\n\nDespite the loss, National Unity consolidated itself as the third opposition force of the Toledo administration, winning 17 seats out of a total of 120. During the Toledo administration, both she and her coalition remained in the opposition, although supporting some the government's economic measures. National Unity was the first political group to withdraw from the National Accord in 2002, being widely criticized. Her party even supported a possible measure of vacancy of the President and Ántero Flores Aráoz obtained the presidency of Congress in 2004 thanks to the votes of the Peruvian Aprista Party.\n\nIn that year, Lourdes Flores rejected the April 14 strike called by the General Confederation of Workers of Peru, which had the support of APRA leader Alan García.\n\nLourdes Flores ran again as the National Unity nominee for President in the 2006 race, which took place on April 9, 2006. At the end of 2005, Congressman José Barba withdrew his Cambio Radical party, having discovered a fraud of false signatures by a provincial committee. Immediately, Barba made it official that his party would be removed from the National Elections Board and would withdraw from the National Unity alliance.\n\nIn 2005, when she made his candidacy official, she already obtained the first place in the polls. In August 2005, Ollanta Humala began an unexpected rise in the polls. The polls throughout the campaign projected her as the most possible successor to Alejandro Toledo.\n\nAs of February 2006, Flores Nano began an advertising campaign with the slogan \"Peru in firm hands\". The voice-over of their advertisements was that of Güido Lombardi, a well-known journalist and TV political host. Her coalition, National Unity, was the only one who did not advertise with his candidates for Congress, since they only presented the presidential candidate.\n\nShe was disqualified by her opponents, referring to Flores as the \"candidate of the rich and the wealthy\", a phrase coined by Alan García and his supporters against her, while members of the National Unity denounced a dirty war orchestrated by the Aprista Party and by Unión por el Perú to damage directly to Lourdes Flores. The surveys of April 2006 showed an increase in Ollanta Humala, a decrease in Flores Nano and a slight increase in Alan García, which could be said to be a \"technical draw\".\n\nAt 100% of the computed votes, it was announced that Ollanta Humala and Alan García would contest the presidency in a run-off, obtaining 30.6% and 24.3% respectively. Lourdes Flores took the third place with 23.8% of the votes, around 65,000 fewer votes than García. As in 2001, former President Garcia edged her out by a slim margin (0.5%) for the second run-off spot. Garcia was then elected as President.\n\nRecognizing the results that left her out of the race, Lourdes Flores affirmed that she believed she had lost \"at the table\", suggesting possible fraud in counting the votes at the polling tables.\n\nIn 2010, Flores narrowly lost the election for Mayor of Lima to Susana Villarán of the Social Force Decentralisation Party (\"Partido Descentralista Fuerza Social\").\n"}
{"id": "1881201", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1881201", "title": "Capping stunt", "text": "Capping stunt\n\nA capping stunt or capping is a New Zealand university tradition of student pranks wherein students perpetrate hoaxes or practical jokes upon an unsuspecting population. They traditionally take place in May during graduation.\n\nCapping stunts have a long tradition in New Zealand, and are a prominent event at and around campuses throughout the country with many notable instances reaching national or local headlines.\n\nThe stunts commonly play on the accepted civil rules of the host city with the local city councils or media as the target. The capping stunts that generate the most media exposure generally involve passive techniques such as letter writing; however, material pranks such as the suspension of inflatable genitals from university property are common.\n\nA frequently referenced stunt is the Victoria University stunt where local workmen were told students dressed as police were planning a fake arrest, while local police were told students dressed as workmen were planning to dig up the road. This stunt encompasses all key elements.\n\nCapping stunts are also carried out in revenge. For example, in 1952 University of Otago students, tired of being misrepresented by the \"Otago Daily Times\", perpetrated a nationwide UFO hoax in order to display the shortcomings of the local paper.\n\nOccasionally capping stunts will prey on other students, particularly those in their first year of study. In May 2004 a Massey University stunt involved staging auditions for extras in Peter Jackson's \"King Kong\". After advertising the auditions in the student newspaper, over 200 students auditioned for a part. Each signed a disclaimer which included \"I also understand that TheatreRecruitment does not guarantee part in any movie, but will endeavor to act in the best interests of entertainment\".\n\nThe most notable recent suspected capping stunt was the Waiheke Island foot and mouth disease threat of May 2005, which was suspected to be a stunt by Massey University in Palmerston North. A letter was sent to Prime Minister Helen Clark stating that the disease had been released onto the island. Police said that the letter came from the Manawatu Region, and coincided with graduation week.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1881212", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1881212", "title": "Dieldrin", "text": "Dieldrin\n\nDieldrin is an organochloride originally produced in 1948 by J. Hyman & Co, Denver, as an insecticide. Dieldrin is closely related to aldrin, which reacts further to form dieldrin. Aldrin is not toxic to insects; it is oxidized in the insect to form dieldrin which is the active compound. Both dieldrin and aldrin are named after the Diels-Alder reaction which is used to form aldrin from a mixture of norbornadiene and hexachlorocyclopentadiene.\n\nOriginally developed in the 1940s as an alternative to DDT, dieldrin proved to be a highly effective insecticide and was very widely used during the 1950s to early 1970s. Endrin is a stereoisomer of dieldrin.\n\nHowever, it is an extremely persistent organic pollutant; it does not easily break down. Furthermore, it tends to biomagnify as it is passed along the food chain. Long-term exposure has proven toxic to a very wide range of animals including humans, far greater than to the original insect targets. For this reason, it is now banned in most of the world.\n\nIt has been linked to health problems such as Parkinson's, breast cancer, and immune, reproductive, and nervous system damage. It is also an endocrine disruptor, acting as an estrogen and antiandrogen, and can adversely affect testicular descent in the fetus if a pregnant woman is exposed to it.\n\nDieldrin can be formed from the Diels-Alder reaction of hexachloro-1,3-cyclopentadiene with norbornadiene followed by epoxidation of the addition product with a peroxy acid such as paracetic acid as shown below. \n\nThe chemicals dieldrin and aldrin were widely applied in agricultural areas throughout the world. Both are toxic and bioaccumulative. Aldrin does break down to dieldrin in living systems, but dieldrin is known to resist bacterial and chemical breakdown processes in the environment.\n\nAldrin was used to control soil pests (namely termites) on corn and potato crops. Dieldrin was an insecticide used on fruit, soil, and seed. It persists in the soil with a half-life of five years at temperate latitudes. Both aldrin and dieldrin may be volatilized from sediment and redistributed by air currents, contaminating areas far from their sources. They have been measured in Arctic wildlife, suggesting long range transport from southern agricultural regions.\n\nBoth aldrin and dieldrin have been banned in most developed countries, but aldrin is still used as a termiticide in Malaysia, Thailand, Venezuela and parts of Africa. In Canada, their sale was restricted in the mid-1970s, with the last registered use of the compounds in Canada being withdrawn in 1984.\n\nIPCS quotes the World Health Organization as stating dieldrin is prohibited for use in agriculture in, among others, Brazil, Ecuador, Finland, the German Democratic Republic, Singapore, Sweden, Yugoslavia, and the USSR. The European Community legislation prohibits the marketing of phytopharmaceutical products containing dieldrin. In Argentina, Canada, Chile, the Federal Republic of Germany, Hungary, and the USA, its use is prohibited, with some exceptions. The use of dieldrin is restricted in India, Mauritius, Togo, and the United Kingdom. Its use in industry is prohibited in Switzerland and its manufacture and use in Japan is under government control. In Finland, the only accepted use for dieldrin is as a termiticide in one glue mixture for exported plywood. India requires registration and licences for all importation, manufacture, sale, or storage.\n\nOrganochlorines and other chemicals were originally developed in the 1930s for use as insecticides and pesticides. DDT became famous worldwide in 1939 after its use in overcoming a typhus infestation in Naples. The use of organochlorines increased during the 1950s and peaked in the 1970s. Their use in Australia was dramatically lowered between the mid 1970s and the early 1980s. The first restrictions on the use of dieldrin and related chemicals in Australia were introduced in 1961-2, with registration required for their use on produce animals, such as cattle and chickens. This coincided with increasing concerns worldwide about the long-term effects of persistent pesticides. The publication of \"Silent Spring\" (an account of the environmental and health effects of pesticides) by Rachel Carson in 1962 was a key driving force in raising this concern. The phase-out process was driven by government bans and deregistration, in turn promoted by changing public perceptions that food containing residues of these chemicals was less acceptable and possibly hazardous to health.\n\nThroughout this time, continuous pressure was maintained by relevant committees, for example the Technical Committee on Agricultural Chemicals (TCAC), to reduce approved organochlorine use. By 1981, the use of dieldrin worldwide was limited to sugarcane and bananas, and these uses were deregistered by 1985. In 1987, a nationwide recall system was put into place, and in December of that year, the government prohibited all imports of these chemicals into Australia without express ministerial approval. In 1994, the National Registration Authority for Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals published a use of organochlorines in termite control, recommending the phase-out of organochlorines used in termite control upon development of viable alternatives. The same year, the Agriculture and Resource Management Council of Australia and New Zealand decided to phase out remaining organochlorine uses by 30 June 1995, with the exception of the Northern Territory. In November 1997, the use of all organochlorines other than mirex was phased out in Australia. Remaining stocks of mirex are to be used only for contained baits for termites in plantations of young trees in the Northern Territory until stocks run out, which is expected in the near future.\n\nThe recognition of negative impacts on health has stimulated the implementation of multiple legislative policies in regards to the use and disposal of organochlorine pesticides. For example, the Environment Protection (Marine) Policy 1994 became operational in May 1995 in South Australia. It dictated the acceptable concentration of toxicants such as dieldrin in marine waters and the manner in which these levels must be tested and tried.\n\nMomentum against organochlorine and similar molecules continued to grow internationally, leading, to negotiations which matured as the Stockholm Convention on the use of persistent organic pollutants (POPs). POPs are defined as hazardous and environmentally persistent substances which can be transported between countries by the earth's oceans and atmosphere.\n\nMost POPs (including dieldrin) bioaccumulate in the fatty tissues of humans and other animals. The Stockholm Convention banned 12 POPs, nicknamed \"the dirty dozen\". These include: aldicarb, toxaphene, chlordane and heptachlor, chlordimeform, chlorobenzilate, DBCP, DDT, \"drins\" (aldrin, dieldrin and endrin), EDB, HCH and lindane, paraquat, parathion and methyl parathion, pentachlorophenol, and 2,4,5-T. This took force on 17 May 2004. Australia ratified the Convention only three days later and became a party to it in August that year.\n\nWell before this, Australia had been well advanced in meeting the measures agreed upon under the Convention. Production, import and use of aldrin, chlordane, DDT, dieldrin, hexachlorobenzene (HCB), heptachlor, endrin, and toxaphene are not permitted in Australia. Production and importation of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are not permitted in Australia, with the phase-out of existing PCBs being managed under the National Strategy for the Management of Scheduled Waste. This strategy also addresses how Australia will manage HCB waste and organochlorine pesticides.\n\nLegislation in Australia on the import, use and disposal of dieldrin and other organochlorines has been extensive and covers mainly environmental and potential health impacts on the population.\n\n"}

{"id": "1881227", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1881227", "title": "Sarıyer", "text": "Sarıyer\n\nSarıyer () is the northernmost district of Istanbul, Turkey, on the European side of the city. The Sarıyer district is a huge area consisting of the villages on the European side of the Bosphorus from Rumelifeneri, down through Tarabya, Yeniköy, İstinye, Emirgan to Rumelihisarı. Sarıyer also administers the Black Sea coast to the west of the mouth of the Bosphorus including the village of Kilyos. Its neighbours are Eyüp to the northwest, Beşiktaş to the south and Kağıthane to the west. Sarıyer has a population of approximately 260,000. The mayor is Şükrü Genç (CHP). Some parts of Beyoğlu and Çatalca were joined and Sarıyer became district centre in 1930. The district boundaries shrunk after the county of Kemerburgaz was given to the Eyüp district in 1936 and villages of Maslak and Ayazağa were given to Şişli district in 1954. Sarıyer has present boundaries after joining boroughs of Maslak, Ayazağa and Huzur from Şişli district in 2012.\n\nSarıyer's Bosphorus villages, backed by steep hills, were once rural fishing communities. They later became retreats for the city's wealthy. In the Ottoman period the sultans came to these villages for picnics and excursions. During the 18th and 19th centuries, the coast was lined with summer residences of the wealthy foreign traders of Pera and Galata. Many foreign embassies built summer residences in this period. Since the construction of the coast road, these villages, and increasingly the hillsides behind them, house many expensive villas owned by İstanbul's rich businessmen, actors and musicians, attracted by the coastline and the lush forest behind.\n\nSarıyer has recently been supplied with natural gas. Significant parts of the district have also seen the installation of a new drainage system, particularly in the village of Sarıyer itself and along the coast road. These projects have led to chronic road construction and its attendant traffic. Sarıyer itself has particularly heavy traffic.\n\nThe coast road running through Sarıyer is lined with fish restaurants of all kinds, many of which were formerly housed in boats moored by the sea wall. This coast is so popular with day-trippers and Sunday drivers that at weekends the pleasure of a drive along Sarıyer's is mitigated by the crawling queues of traffic.\n\nIn addition to the coast road, Sarıyer is connected to the downtown historic and financial centers by Buyukdere Road, the main road from Beşiktaş up to Maslak and beyond; this is the route used by minibuses serving Sarıyer-Beşiktaş. There is also high-speed ferry boat service for commuting to the city. However, as a drive through Sarıyer during commute times and rush hour will attest, many people commute by car.\n\nThe Bosphorus communities of Sarıyer include (south to north):\n\n\nThe Belgrad Forest, at one time the Ottoman military would come on exercises. Today it is popular for picnics at the weekend, and the road to Kilyos passes through here. The woods are home to Istanbul University's department of forestry, and are accessible by public transport. There have always been rural communities here but since the 1990s, luxury housing and private schools have been built in parts of the forest. The largest of these developments is the new village of Zekeriyaköy, which is now one of the most expensive residential areas in Istanbul. The campus of the prestigious, private Koç University is also located in the forest. The growth of these areas may have, along with construction and poorly conceived traffic flow planning, contributed to the heavy traffic in the village of Sarıyer.\n\nKilyos is a small town, a pleasant retreat from the city, although it is often windswept in winter. Indeed, the Black Sea can produce dramatic storms even in the summer. Some Istanbul residents swim in the sea at Kilyos, although the rocky coast and strong currents, including, in places, a dangerous undertow, may make swimming here risky. The road to Kilyos leads through the Belgrad Forest with its system of viaducts and reservoirs going back to the Ottoman period, although it is also accessible through the village of Sarıyer, leading to serious traffic delays during summer months. There are lovely cool spots to stop in the forest or go for a country walk, and the hilltops have marvellous views of the Bosphorus and the Black Sea. For many years this area has been a popular spot for picnics. In recent years Kilyos has acquired a number of bars and cafes, including a couple of well-known private beach clubs and a rock festival in summer. There are still beaches though and plenty of spots for a picnic, so on Sundays long queues of cars snake through the forest honking their horns at each other.\n\n\nThe football club Sarıyer S.K. was the winner of 1992 Balkans Cup winner. They play in the TFF Second League.\n\nThe women's football club Kireçburnu Spor play in the Turkish Women's First Football League.\n\nWomen's volleyball yeam of Sarıyer Belediyespor compete in the Turkish Women's Volleyball League.\n\nÇayırbaşı Stadiım is home to the football clubs in Sarıyer.\n\nThe villages of Sarıyer district include Rumelikavağı, Garipçe, Rumelifeneri, Demirciköy, Zekeriyaköy, Bahçeköy, Kilyos (Kumköy), Uskumruköy, Gümüşdere, and Kısırkaya (the westernmost point of Sarıyer district).\n\nPrimary and secondary schools:\n\nUniversities:\n\nSarıyer is twinned with:\n\n\n"}

While on that label, they released seven albums, all of which have been certified platinum or higher by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). In order of release, these albums are \"Rascal Flatts\" (2000), \"Melt\" (2002), \"Feels Like Today\" (2004), \"Me and My Gang\" (2006), \"Still Feels Good\" (2007), \"Greatest Hits Volume 1\" (2008) and \"Unstoppable\" (2009). After Lyric Street closed in 2010, they moved to Big Machine Records, for which they have released five albums: \"Nothing Like This\" (2010), \"Changed\" (2012), \"Rewind\" (2014), \"The Greatest Gift of All\" (2016), and \"Back to Us\" (2017).\n\nTheir studio albums have accounted for more than 25 singles, of which 14 have reached No. 1 on \"Billboard\" Hot Country Songs or Country Airplay. Their longest-lasting No. 1 single, a cover of Marcus Hummon's \"Bless the Broken Road\", spent five weeks in that position in 2005. In 2005–06, \"What Hurts the Most\" was No. 1 on both the Hot Country Songs and Adult Contemporary charts, and peaked at No. 6 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100.\n\nOn January 7, 2020, the band announced that they would be disbanding following a farewell tour after 21 years together. On May 19, 2020, the farewell tour was cancelled due to COVID-19.\n\nRascal Flatts' founding was at Fiddle and Steel Guitar Bar in Nashville, Tennessee. Gary LeVox and Jay DeMarcus are second cousins from a musical family. DeMarcus moved to Nashville in 1992, earning his first record deal as part of a Christian group called East to West; his brother-in-law, James Otto, is also a country music singer. In 1997, DeMarcus called LeVox, and convinced him to come to Nashville and provide some harmonies on Michael English's album \"Gospel\", which he was producing. They engineered the album together, and became English's back-up band.\n\nAt the same time, DeMarcus had become the bandleader of Chely Wright's band, where he met Joe Don Rooney, the guitarist in that band. DeMarcus and LeVox were working in a Printer's Alley nightclub and when their part-time guitarist could not make it one night, DeMarcus invited Rooney to join them. Jim Riley was the drummer and bandleader for the band. The group covered the hit Shenandoah single \"The Church on Cumberland Road\" that night. To the group's recollection, a bond was formed instantly.\n\nSinger Mila Mason recommended the group to record producers Mark Bright and Marty Williams, who played Lyric Street Records A&R Doug Howard a three-song demo and Howard thought they were \"just incredible.\" After he'd heard the demos, the band went into the Lyric Street offices the next day, sat down with acoustic guitars, and played a couple of songs. According to Howard in an interview with HitQuarters: \"The vocals and harmonies, it was all there—I was just blown away. The lead singer has such a unique and compelling voice.\" The band was signed to Lyric Street in late 1999.\n\nIn early 2000, the group made its debut with the single \"Prayin' for Daylight\". This song had been on the three-song demo that had gotten the band signed. The song, which reached No. 3 on the \"Billboard\" country charts, was the first single from their self-titled debut, which was issued in early 2000 on Lyric Street. Following \"Prayin' for Daylight\", the album's other three singles all made the Top 10 on that chart with \"This Everyday Love\", \"While You Loved Me\", and \"I'm Movin' On\", which respectively peaked at numbers 9, 7, and 4. \"I'm Movin' On\" was awarded Song of the Year by the Academy of Country Music in 2002. Stephen Thomas Erlewine reviewed the album with favor, calling it \"a sunny, pleasing modern country-pop album\".\n\nTheir second album, entitled \"Melt\", was released in 2002. Unlike their previous album, Rascal Flatts co-produced this one. The album's first single, \"These Days\", became the band's first number one hit on the U.S. country charts. The album included two more Top 10 hits with \"Love You Out Loud\" \"I Melt\", and \"Mayberry\". The latter became the band's second number one. The music video for \"I Melt\" featured partial nudity and was banned from the Great American Country (GAC) network.\n\nRascal Flatts's third album, \"Feels Like Today\", was released in late 2004. The album's title track was released as its first single. Following it was \"Bless the Broken Road\". That song was originally recorded by its co-writer, Marcus Hummon, and had also been recorded by Melodie Crittenden (whose version made the country chart in 1998), the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, and Sons of the Desert. In early 2005, Rascal Flatts's version became the band's third number one hit on the U.S. country charts and spent five weeks at that position. The third single, \"Fast Cars and Freedom\", hit number one as well. While the latter was climbing the charts, some radio stations began playing a hidden track on the album, titled \"Skin\". This airplay caused \"Skin\" to enter the top 40. The song was released as a single under the title \"Skin (Sarabeth)\" and officially added to the album's track list.\n\nRascal Flatts's thirteenth chart entry, \"What Hurts the Most\", was released in December 2005. This song had previously been recorded by Mark Wills in 2003. Rascal Flatts' version of that song was released as the first single from their fourth album \"Me and My Gang\", which was released in 2006. For this album, the band worked with producer Dann Huff. They switched producers to create a more band-oriented album. Rascal Flatts' rendition of \"What Hurts the Most\" was a crossover hit for the band, reaching No. 1 on both the country and adult contemporary charts, as well as peaking with the top 10 on the \"Billboard Hot 100. After it, the album's title track was released as the second single and charted in the Top 10 at number 6. The third and fourth singles, \"My Wish\" and \"Stand\", both reached number one.\n\nAlso in 2006, the group charted in the top 10 of the Hot 100 with a cover of Tom Cochrane's \"Life Is a Highway\", which they recorded for the Pixar film \"Cars\". Although \"Life Is a Highway\" was not released to country radio, several country stations did begin playing the song, causing it to chart within the top 20 of Hot Country Songs.\n\n\"Me and My Gang\" had the highest US debut of 2006, with 722,000 units in April. The album spent 15 weeks at No. 1 on the \"Billboard\" Top Country Albums chart and was the second-best selling album of 2006 (behind \"High School Musical\"), with sales totaling to about 3.5 million by year's end. The album's success led the band to take the spot of top-selling artist for all genres of music, which had not been accomplished in 15 years by a country group.\n\nCarrie Underwood and Rascal Flatts performed together at the 2007 Grammy Awards ceremony. Later the same year, the group released the single \"Take Me There\", a song which Kenny Chesney co-wrote and had initially planned to record himself. That song became a number-one country hit in September and served as the first single from the album \"Still Feels Good\". It was followed by \"Winner at a Losing Game\", which was the first single which the band wrote themselves. Both it and its followup \"Every Day\" peaked at No. 2 on the country charts. The fourth single from the album, \"Bob That Head\", became the band's first single to miss the Top 10 on the chart. The fifth and final single, \"Here\", was released in August 2008 and became the band's ninth Number One hit on the chart week of January 3, 2009.\n\nRascal Flatts released their first compilation album, \"Greatest Hits Volume 1\", on October 28, 2008. The album contains 13 of their biggest songs, starting with \"Prayin' for Daylight\" and going through \"Life Is a Highway\". The limited edition of the album contains a second disc with three Christmas songs: \"White Christmas\", \"Jingle Bell Rock\", and \"I'll Be Home for Christmas\". A year later in October 2009, they released a second edition of their greatest hits collection, this time with a second disc containing live performances of \"Take Me There\", \"Summer Nights\", \"Me & My Gang\", and \"Winner at a Losing Game\".\n\nIn January 2009, Rascal Flatts released the song \"Here Comes Goodbye\" as the first single from the album \"Unstoppable\", which was released on April 7 of that year. Co-written by \"American Idol\" season six finalist Chris Sligh, \"Here Comes Goodbye\" became the group's tenth number one hit. The second single form the \"Unstoppable\" album, \"Summer Nights\", which was co-written by Gary LeVox, was released in early May 2009. That song debuted at No. 57 and topped out at No. 2 on the country charts. The group performed \"Summer Nights\" at the \"CMT Music Awards\", \"Oprah\"s Kickoff Party, and the finale of \"America's Got Talent\". The third single off the album, \"Why\", peaked at No. 18 on the country charts. Rascal Flatts performed that song on \"The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien\". The title track was released as the album's fourth single in January 2010.\n\nA special release version of their album \"Unstoppable\" was sold at JCPenney stores nationwide. It features a special release song entitled \"American Living\" only available on the albums sold at JCPenney stores. JCPenney is an official sponsor of Rascal Flatts' Unstoppable American Living Tour in a two-year partnership and $1 of every CD sold at JCPenney will be donated to the JCPenney Afterschool Fund. On July 16, 2009, as part of the JCPenney American Living Tour, Rascal Flatts made history as the first country music group to play Chicago's Wrigley Field. The trio was joined by fellow artists Vince Gill and Darius Rucker for a near-sellout crowd.\n\nAfter the closure of Lyric Street in April 2010, Rascal Flatts signed to Big Machine Records in July of that year. The group's first single from the label was the song \"Why Wait\". The song was first single single from the album \"Nothing Like This\", which was released November 16, 2010. In December 2010, \"Why Wait\" became the trio's eleventh number one hit on the U.S. country charts.\n\nIn March 2011, Rascal Flatts was featured on a remix of Justin Bieber's song \"That Should Be Me\". The second single from \"Nothing Like This\" was \"I Won't Let Go\". That song went to number 2 in early 2011. Following it was the band's first collaborative release to country radio, \"Easy\", which is a duet with British pop singer Natasha Bedingfield. \"I Won't Let Go\", and \"Easy\" peaked at numbers 2 and 3 respectively on the country charts. On November 8, 2011, Hollywood Records released \"The Best of Rascal Flatts Live\".\n\nRascal Flatts' eighth studio album, \"Changed\", was released on April 3, 2012.

The band admitted they were lip-syncing to a recording of their song \"Rewind\" during Academy of Country Music (ACM) awards show on April 6, 2014. In response to the controversy, Rascal Flatts communicated afterwards that lead singer Gary LeVox had lost his voice and so they made a last-minute decision to lip-sync. \"Rewind\" became a Top 5 hit on the Country Airplay chart in 2014. \"Rewind\" has produced three more singles with \"Payback\", which peaked at 21, \"Riot\", which reached 20, and \"I Like the Sound of That\", which was released to country radio on September 14, 2015.

{"id": "1881242", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1881242", "title": "Strategic sourcing", "text": "Strategic sourcing\n\nStrategic sourcing is an institutional procurement process that continuously improves and re-evaluates the purchasing activities of a company. In the services industry, strategic sourcing refers to a service solution, sometimes called a strategic partnership, which is specifically customized to meet the client's individual needs. In a production environment, it is often considered one component of supply chain management. Modern supply chain management professionals have placed emphasis on defining the distinct differences between strategic sourcing and procurement. Procurement operations support tactical day-to-day transactions such as issuing purchase orders to suppliers, whereas strategic sourcing represents to strategic planning, supplier development, contract negotiation, supply chain infrastructure, and outsourcing models.\n\nThe term \"strategic sourcing\" was popularized through work with a variety of blue chip companies by a number of consulting firms in the late 1980s and early to mid 1990s. This methodology has become the norm for procurement departments in large, sophisticated companies such as fortune 500 companies.\n\nStrategic sourcing is the process of developing channels of supply at the lowest total cost, not just the lowest purchase price. It expands upon traditional purchasing activities to embrace all activities within the procurement cycle, from specification to receipt and payment of goods and services.\n\nThe steps in a strategic sourcing process were defined, in 1994, as:\n\nA slimmed down strategic sourcing process was defined, in 2012, as:\n\nWhile the modernized process combines the market assessment and cost analyses steps of the older model into a single \"market research\" step, and the supplier identification and sourcing strategy development steps into a single \"go-to-market\" step, negotiation has split into \"negotiation\" and \"contracting.\" This change is due to the heightened importance of market intelligence in modern strategic sourcing plans, and its ability to deliver value by improving both pricing and contract terms when leveraged against the identified suppliers.\n\nAlthough both descriptions of the sourcing process are accurate to some extent, there is no standard set of steps and procedures. As strategic sourcing is put in place and practiced over time, many large, sophisticated organizations will modify the process to better meet their individual corporate needs.\n\nOutsourcing a business practice to another company may also be incorporated into a sourcing strategy for services. This strategy may involve the transfer of staff and assets to the outsource company. Due to the strategic and complex nature of outsourcing, many organizations such as Procter & Gamble, Microsoft and McDonald's have created what is referred to as Vested Outsourcing agreements to help build highly collaborative win-win business relationships. Researchers at the University of Tennessee provide guidance on how to create Vested Outsourcing agreements in their book Vested Outsourcing: Five Rules that will Transform Outsourcing.\n\nThe sourcing plan is the result of all planning efforts on strategic sourcing. Into this planning, all sourcing events are organized and detailed with tactical and operational information such as the sourcing team responsible for each event, when the sourcing event is supposed to begin and end based on each RFX step (RFI, RFP, RFQ), the requirements, specifications of all services or materials, and negotiations/cost goals. The objective of the sourcing plan is to manage the timing and quality of all sourcing events in the strategic sourcing program. Many procurement professionals continue to conduct sourcing and RFX activities manually using spreadsheets; however, this creates risk for error and gaps in the sourcing process.\n\nOperations research is a discipline of applying advanced techniques to help make better decisions. Optimization, in turn, utilizes mathematical algorithms to rapidly solve a business problem by evaluating all possible outcomes (or many outcomes) and selecting those ones that yield the best solution.\nWhen applied to sourcing and supply chain operations, optimization helps the sourcing professional simultaneously evaluate thousands of different procurement inputs. This evaluation can take into consideration the global market, specific current supply chain conditions, and individual supplier conditions, and offers alternatives to address the buyer’s sourcing goals. Furthermore, it allows internal stakeholders in the buying organization to impose constraints on the award or specify preferences to favor certain non-cost objectives such as limited switching, reduced supplier numbers or higher quality outcomes.\n\nCooperative sourcing is a collaboration or negotiation of different companies, which have similar business processes. \nTo save costs, the competitor with the best production function can insource the business process of the other competitors. This is especially common in IT-oriented industries due to low to no variable costs, e.g. banking. Since all of the negotiating parties can be outsourcers or insourcers the main challenge in this collaboration is to find a stable coalition and the company with the best production function. \nThis is difficult since the real production costs are hard to estimate and negotiators might be tempted to portray their real cost much higher than they actually are in order to demand higher fees for insourcing. High switching costs, costs for searching potential cooperative sourcers, and negotiating often result in inefficient solutions.\n\nSourcing Business Models are a systems-based approach to structuring supplier relationships. A sourcing business model is a type of business model that is applied to business relationships where more than one party needs to work with another party to be successful. There are seven sourcing business models that range from the transactional to investment-based. The seven models are: Basic Provider, Approved Provider, Preferred Provider, Performance-Based/Managed Services Model, Vested outsourcing Business Model, Shared Services Model, and Equity Partnership Model. Sourcing business models are targeted for procurement professionals who seek a modern approach to achieve the best fit between buyers and suppliers.\n\nStrategic sourcing from a professional standpoint is lampooned in the American syndicated comic strip \"Sally Forth\", in which the titular character's husband Ted Forth is employed within this field for the duration of the series's run. \"Sally Forth\" is currently written by the writer-illustrator team of Craig MacIntosh and Francesco Marciuliano and frequently lampoons many aspects of business and procurement culture and new trends in purchasing innovation.\n\n\n"}

All routes connect to MBTA subway, MBTA Commuter Rail, and/or other MBTA Bus services. Many routes are descendants of the streetcar routes of the Boston Elevated Railway, or of suburban companies including the Eastern Massachusetts Street Railway, Middlesex and Boston Street Railway, and Newton and Boston Street Railway.\n\nThe Silver Line is a bus rapid transit system marketed as rapid transit. It is divided into two branches: Waterfront service (SL1, SL2, SL3, and the rush-hour Shuttle) that runs through the South Boston Transitway tunnel, and Washington Street service (SL4 and SL5) that runs on the surface via Washington Street. The Waterfront service costs the same as a subway fare, while the Washington Street service costs a regular bus fare.\n\nThe SL5 route was created in 2002 as a replacement for the Washington Street Elevated. The Shuttle route began operations in 2004, followed by the SL2 and SL3 (former) in 2004 and SL1 in 2005 when dual-mode buses became available. The SL4 was introduced in 2009 as a replacement for the canceled Phase III tunnel. A new SL3 route to Chelsea opened in 2018. \n\nThe crosstown (CT) buses provide limited-stop service on two routes that connect major subway and bus transfer points. The routes were created by the MBTA in 1994.\n\nThese routes provide almost all local service in the core of the metropolitan area; most were originally Boston Elevated Railway streetcar routes. They were originally numbered roughly clockwise from southeast to northeast, with 4 the furthest south in South Boston and 121 the furthest north (roughly) in East Boston. The BERy folded into the Metropolitan Transit Authority in 1947, and the M.T.A. in turn was reorganized as the MBTA in 1964. Despite some changes, including minor routes being merged into trunk routes, the core service network has remained roughly intact since the BERy eta. Several new routes, including the 1, 5, and 47, have been added during the M.T.A. and MBTA eras.\n\nSeven routes - the 52, 59, 62, 67, 70, 70A, and 76 - serve more distant western suburbs, such as Belmont, Lexington, and Needham; most were acquired from the Middlesex and Boston Street Railway in 1972, and subsequently renumbered using previously discontinued designations.\n\nFifteen of these routes (those with the highest ridership in the system) are designated as key bus routes; they supplement the subway system to provide frequent service to the densest areas of the city. Key bus routes typically operate at higher frequencies than their undesignated cousins, and in March 2014 their hours of service were extended until 2:30AM on Friday and Saturday nights along with the rapid transit system. In mid-2015, late-night service on some key bus routes was cut back, while other routes were dropped from late-night service.\n\nKey bus routes are designated on this list with an *.\n\nNumbers from 131 to 137 operate in the Melrose area; their routings are based on routes operated as part of the former Eastern Massachusetts Street Railway, which was folded into the MBTA system in 1968. The 136 and 137 were briefly operated as far as Lowell and Lawrence, their original Eastern Mass terminals, while under MBTA control. The 132 was a Service Bus Lines route which was not operated by the MBTA until 1975.\n\n170 and 171 are special low-service routes, the 170 a variant of the 70 introduced in 1968 and the 171 a replacement for early morning CT3 service when it was cut back from Logan Airport in 2002. Other numbers in the 170s were used for largely short-lived routes serving industrial areas.\n\nRoutes from 191 to 194 are single round trips in the early morning, mainly meant for subway fare collectors but open to the public. They were introduced by the M.T.A. in 1960.\n\nRoute 195 is a special low-service route not open to the general public nor shown on MBTA maps. It connects downtown Boston with the homeless shelter at Lemuel Shattuck Hospital. Until September 2015, the route was numbered 277 to match routes 274-276 (which connected downtown Boston to the Long Island Health Campus and were suspended due to the closure of Long Island Bridge in October 2014.)\n\nThe 20 belt route was created by the M.T.A. in 1962 as a combination of the 20 and 21 stub routes inherited from BERy. In 2005, the MBTA redesignated the two directions of the loop as the 201 and 202 to avoid confusion about which way each bus ran.\n\nThese routes operate in the Quincy area. Routes 210-245 are based on routes originally operated by the Eastern Massachusetts Street Railway (folded into the MBTA in 1968) which mostly ran into Fields Corner station. When the Red Line's Braintree Branch opened in the 1970s, these routes were rerouted to terminate at the new rapid transit stations (principally Quincy Center). \n\nThese routes operate express between Medford and downtown Boston. They were introduced by the MBTA in June 1973.\n\nThese routes operate in the Burlington area. They are the remains of the Eastern Massachusetts Street Railway's Lowell Division, which was inherited intact by the MBTA in 1968 and gradually declined thereafter.\n\nThese routes operate in the Lynn area and the North Shore. Two routes that run to Haymarket have weekend short-turn variants (labeled with a W suffix) that terminate at Wonderland. The 411 and 430 were Service Bus Lines routes that were acquired by the MBTA in 1975; the other routes are largely Eastern Massachusetts Street Railway routes acquired in 1968.\n\nThese routes operate express between Newton and downtown Boston via the Massachusetts Turnpike (I-90). The 500 series routes were created by the MBTA in the 1960s to take advantage of the newly constructed turnpike extension into Boston. The 550 series routes were Middlesex and Boston Street Railway routes to Newton Corner that were extended to downtown Boston in the 1960s and taken over by the MBTA in 1972.\n\nThe MBTA provides partial subsidy for some suburban routes outside its usual service area that connect with MBTA bus, subway, or commuter rail service. Routes 710-716 are radial commuter routes that accept MBTA passes on CharlieTickets only; they were taken over from various private operators (Hudson Bus Lines for the 710 and 716, Rapid Transit Inc. for the 712/713, and Nantasket Transportation for the 714).\n\nThe non-numbered routes (listed here by their designator on MBTA maps) are local circulator services founded by the municipalities with partial MBTA subsidy. All are operated by private companies under contract, except for the Beverly Shuttle which is operated by the Cape Ann Transportation Authority.\n\n"}

The seat of the Bishop of Pamiers is at the Pamiers Cathedral.\n\nPamiers is located on the Ariège River.\n\nThe town of Pamiers is famous for its three bell towers and for being the birthplace of Gabriel Fauré, one of the greatest French musicians and composers of the late 19th and early 20th century. It also boasts awards for \"Ville fleurie\", the equivalent of \"town in bloom\".\nLocal facilities include good restaurants, bars, supermarkets, large public indoor and outdoor swimming pools (one of which is 50m).\n\nPamiers lies in an ancient alluvial plain of the Ariège River in the area called \"La Basse Ariège\", noted for its rich fertile soil ideal for agriculture. Pamiers has 17,000 inhabitants, the \"Appaméens\", and is the economic capital of the Ariège, being the most important town in the department.\n\nThe town itself dates back to the 5th century. The origin of its name is subject to debate. A certain school of linguists tends to believe that it was derived from the fact that, when Pamiers was founded, its new inhabitants were given land parcels measured in \"pams\"', from \"empan\" (from the Latin \"pannus\" meaning \"piece of cloth\"). Originally it was called \"Ville de Pams\". Another explanation is one involving Roger II de Foix, who had gone to a crusade in the region of Apamea in Syria and who, upon his return to France, gave his castle and domain the name of one of his battles: \"Castrum Appamiae\", name later on given to the town. The fact that Pamiers' inhabitants are called \"Appaméens\" would seem to favour this hypothesis. In the 18th century a plural stance on the word was introduced making the name \"Apamias\" derived from ecclesiastical language and also similar to the Occitan language. The Occitan name \"Pamias\" can be seen on the town sign, alongside the French name Pamiers, as one enters the town via the old route from Toulouse, RN20.\n\nThe main square of Pamiers, \"Place de la République\", is paved in red marble. Every week, three large open-air farmers' markets are held, plus a flea market every Sunday morning.

What had begun as a local conflict over the control of the Val Müstair and the Umbrail Pass in the Grisons soon got out of hand when both parties called upon their allies for help; the Habsburgs demanding the support of the Swabian League, and the Federation of the Three Leagues of the Grisons turning to the Swiss \"Eidgenossenschaft\". Hostilities quickly spread from the Grisons through the Rhine valley to Lake Constance and even to the Sundgau in southern Alsace, the westernmost part of Habsburg Further Austria.\n\nMany battles were fought from January to July 1499, and in all but a few minor skirmishes, the experienced Swiss soldiers defeated the Swabian and Habsburg armies. After their victories in the Burgundian Wars, the Swiss had battle tested troops and commanders. On the Swabian side, distrust between the knights and their foot soldiers, disagreements amongst the military leadership, and a general reluctance to fight a war that even the Swabian counts considered to be more in the interests of the powerful Habsburgs than in the interest of the Holy Roman Empire proved fatal handicaps. When his military high commander fell in the battle of Dornach, where the Swiss won a final decisive victory, Emperor Maximilian I had no choice but to agree to a peace treaty signed on September 22, 1499, in Basel. The treaty granted the Confederacy far-reaching independence from the empire. Although the \"Eidgenossenschaft\" officially remained a part of the empire until the Treaty of Westphalia in 1648, the peace of Basel exempted it from the imperial jurisdiction and imperial taxes and thus \"de facto\" acknowledged it as a separate political entity.\n\nOne source of conflict was the ancient distrust, rivalry, and hostility between the Old Swiss Confederacy and the House of Habsburg, which had risen to the throne of the Holy Roman Emperor since 1438. Since the late 13th century, the members of the Swiss Confederacy had gradually taken control of territories that once had belonged to the Habsburg realm. The Swiss had attained the status of imperial immediacy, being subject only to the emperor himself, and not to any intermediate Princes or liege lords. This status granted them a far-reaching autonomy within the Holy Roman Empire, even more so as the emperor was a distant overlord. Before 1438, the empire and the emperor had been an antipole to the Habsburg dukes for the Swiss. Previous emperors had repeatedly supported the confederates in their struggles against the Habsburgs, whom they saw as strong rivals. They had confirmed the Imperial immediacy of the Swiss on several occasions; and the Swiss had succeeded in defending their privileged status against Habsburg dukes who had tried to regain their former territories.\n\nWhen Frederick III of Habsburg ascended to the throne, the Swiss suddenly faced a new situation in which they could no longer count on support from the empire. Worse yet, conflicts with the Habsburg dukes threatened to become conflicts with the empire itself. Under Frederick's reign, this did not occur yet. Frederick had sided in 1442 against the confederacy in the Old Zürich War where he had supported the city of Zürich, and he also refused to reconfirm the imperial immediacy of the members of the Confederacy. But Frederick's troubled reign did not leave room for military operations against the Swiss. In Austria, Frederick was in conflict first with his brother Albert and then faced the pressure of Matthias Corvinus, who even drove him from Vienna and forced Frederick's court to assume an itinerant lifestyle.\n\nIn the empire, Frederick faced the opposition of the Bavarian Wittelsbach dynasty and of his cousin Sigismund, who was duke in Tyrol, Vorarlberg, and Further Austria then. Sigismund had been in conflict with the Swiss Confederacy, too. When he had been banned by Pope Pius II in a conflict over the nomination of a bishop in Tyrol, the Swiss had annexed the formerly Habsburg territories of the Thurgau. In 1468, Sigismund clashed with the Swiss in the War of Waldshut, which he could end without significant territorial losses only by paying a large ransom, which he financed by pawning territories in the Sundgau and the Alsace to Charles the Bold of Burgundy in 1469. Charles did not, however, help Sigismund against the Swiss, and so Sigismund bought back the territories in 1474 and concluded a peace treaty with the Confederacy, the \"Ewige Richtung\", although the emperor never recognized it. In the following Burgundy Wars, the Swiss and Sigismund both fought against Charles the Bold.\n\nIn 1487, Sigismund arranged the marriage of Frederick's daughter Kunigunde to duke Albert IV of Bavaria against her father's will, and he also signed away some of his territories in Tyrol and Further Austria to Albert IV. Frederick intervened by force: he founded the Swabian League in 1488, an alliance of the Swabian cities, the Swabian knights of the League of St. George's Shield and the counts of Württemberg and Tyrol and Vorarlberg. With their help, he forced the Wittelsbach house to return the territories signed over by Sigismund.\n\nIn 1490, Sigismund was forced to abdicate and turn over all his territories to Frederick's son Maximilian I. Maximilian had married Mary of Burgundy in 1477 after the death of Charles the Bold in the Burgundy Wars and thus inherited the Burgundian territories: Duchy and County of Burgundy and the Netherlands. He took over and expanded the Burgundian administration with a more centralized style of government, which in 1482, caused the outbreak of a rebellion of the cities and counts, allied with Charles VIII of France, against Maximilian. The Duchy of Burgundy was also a French fiefdom and immediately claimed by Charles VIII. The first phase of this conflict would last until 1489, keeping Maximilian occupied in the Low Countries. He even fell into the hands of his enemies and was held prisor for four months in Bruges in 1488. He was freed only when his father sent an army under the command of duke Albert of Saxony to his rescue. Maximilian subsequently returned to Germany, leaving his cousin Albert as his representative. Albert would, in the following years, manage to assert the Habsburg hegemony in the Netherlands.\n\nMaximilian had been elected King of the Romans in 1486 on his father's initiative, and they had been ruling jointly since then. Upon the death of Frederick in 1493, Maximilian also took over his father's possessions and thus united the whole Habsburg territory in his hands. In the same year, the Peace of Senlis also marked the end of his wars against the French about his Burgundian possessions; he kept the territories in the Netherlands and also the County of Burgundy, but had to cede the Duchy of Burgundy to the French king. Maximilian controlled thus territories that nearly encircled the Old Swiss Confederacy: Tyrol and Vorarlberg in the east, Further Austria in the north, and the County of Burgundy in the west.\n\nWhen asked by emperor Frederick to also join the Swabian League, the \"Eidgenossen\" flatly refused: they saw no reason to join an alliance designed to further Habsburg interests, and they were wary of this new, relatively closely knit and powerful alliance that had arisen on their northern frontier. Furthermore, they resented the strong aristocratic element in the Swabian League, so different from their own organization, which had grown over the last two hundred years liberating themselves from precisely such an aristocratic rule.\n\nOn the Swabian side, similar concerns existed. For the common people in Swabia, the independence and freedom of the \"Eidgenossen\" was a powerful and attractive role model. Many a baron in southern Swabia feared that his own subjects might revolt and seek adherence to the Swiss Confederacy. These fears were not entirely without foundation: the Swiss had begun to form alliances north of the Rhine river, concluding a first treaty with Schaffhausen in 1454 and then also treaties with cities as far away as Rottweil (1463) or Mulhouse (1466).\n\nThe city of Constance and its bishop were caught in the middle between these two blocks: they held possessions in Swabia, but the city also still exercised the high justice over the Thurgau, where the Swiss had assumed the low justice since the annexation in 1460. The foundation of the Swabian League prompted the Swiss city states of Zürich and Bern to propose accepting Constance into the Swiss Confederacy. The negotiations failed, though, due to the opposition of the founding cantons of the Confederacy and Uri in particular. The split jurisdiction over the Thurgau was the cause of many quarrels between the city and the Confederacy. In 1495, one such disagreement was answered by a punitive expedition of soldiers of Uri and the city had to pay the sum of 3,000 guilders to make them retreat and cease their plundering. (The Thurgau was a condominium of the Swiss Confederacy, and Uri was one of the cantons involved in its administration.) Finally, Constance joined the Swabian League as a full member on November 3, 1498. Although this did not yet definitively define the position of the city—during the Reformation, it would be allied again with Zürich and Bern, and only after the defeat of the Schmalkaldic League in 1548 its close connections to the \"Eidgenossenschaft\" would be finally severed—it was another factor contributing to the growing estrangement between the Swiss and the Swabians.\n\nThe competition between Swiss (\"Reisläufer\") and Swabian mercenaries (\"Landsknechte\"), who both fought in armies throughout Europe, sometimes opposing each other on the battlefield, sometimes competing for contracts, intensified. Contemporary chronicles agree in their reports that the Swiss, who were considered the best soldiers in Europe at the time after their victories in the Burgundian Wars, were subject to many taunts and abuses by the \"Landsknechte\"; they were called \"\"Kuhschweizer\"\" and ridiculed in other ways. Such insults were neither given nor taken lightly, and frequently led to bloodshed. Indeed, such incidents would contribute to prolong the Swabian War itself by triggering skirmishes and looting expeditions that the military commands of neither side had ever wanted or planned.\n\nMaximilian I, like other Holy Roman Emperors before and after him, had to face struggles with other powerful princes in the empire and he thus sought to secure his position and the imperial monarchy by furthering centralisation. At the Imperial Diet held in Worms in 1495, he was partly successful, but he also had to make concessions in favor of the princes. The imperial reform proclaimed an \"eternal public peace\" (\"Ewiger Landfriede\") to put an end to the abounding feuds and the anarchy of the robber barons and it defined a new standing Imperial Army to enforce that peace, to which each imperial estate (\"Reichsstand\") would have had to send troops. It also mandated the common penny (\"Reichspfennig\"), a new head tax to finance this army. Among the concessions Maximilian had to make was the institution of a new supreme court, the \"Reichskammergericht\", thus separating the highest judicial authority from the person and the whereabouts of the emperor. He also had to agree to the formation of a governmental council of princes called the \"Reichsregiment\". It would never play a significant role: it convened for the first time in 1500, but was dissolved by Maximilian two years later.\n\nThe Swiss did not accept these resolutions of the Imperial Diet, and they explicitly refused to pay the common penny. They had no interest whatsoever in sending troops to serve in an army under Habsburg authority, nor in paying taxes, nor would they accept any foreign court's jurisdiction; and they had succeeded in securing public peace within their territories reasonably well by themselves. They simply considered the whole proposal a curtailing of their freedom. The Swiss were by far not the only members of the empire who refused to accept the resolutions, but Maximilian would use their refusal later as a pretext to place the Swiss Confederacy under an imperial ban (\"Reichsacht\").\n\nOpen war broke out over a territorial conflict in the Grisons, where during the 15th century a federation similar to the \"Eidgenossenschaft\" had developed. Like the Swiss, these Three Leagues had achieved a far-reaching autonomy, but also were involved in constant struggles with the Habsburgs, who ruled the neighbouring territories to the east and who kept trying to bring the Grisons under their influence. During the 1470s and 1480s, duke Sigismund had succeeded in acquiring step by step the high justice over most of the communes of the \"Zehngerichtebund\" (\"League of the Ten Jurisdictions\" in the Prättigau, the youngest of the Three Leagues that had sprung up in the Grisons, having been founded only in 1436), and Maximilian continued this expansionist strategy. The Habsburg pressure prompted the Three Leagues to sign a close military alliance with the Swiss Confederacy in 1497-98.\n\nAt the same time, the Habsburgs had been involved in a major power struggle with the French kings of the House of Valois over the control of the remains of the realm of Charles the Bold, whose daughter and heiress Mary Maximilian had married. Maximilian's second marriage in 1493 with Bianca Maria Sforza from Milan then got the Habsburgs directly involved in the Italian Wars, clashing again with the French kings over the control of the Duchy of Milan.\n\nAs a direct connection between Tyrol and Milan, the Grisons and in particular the Val Müstair became strategically important to the Habsburgs. The Umbrail Pass in the Val Müstair connects the Vinschgau valley (Val Venosta) in southern Tyrol with the Valtellina in northern Italy. Furthermore, the Habsburgs and the Bishop of Chur had been quarrelling over the judicial rights over the region for some time. On January 20, 1499, Habsburg troops occupied the valley and plundered the Benedictine Convent of Saint John at Müstair, but were soon driven back by the forces of the Three Leagues, and an armistice was signed already on February 2 in Glurns (Glorenza), a village in the upper Vinschgau.\n\nBut the Three Leagues had already called upon the Swiss for help and troops from Uri had already arrived in Chur. Upon learning about the truce, they withdrew, but met a small troop of Habsburg soldiers on their way back home. When those engaged in the usual insults on the Swiss, the latter crossed the Rhine and killed the scoffers. In retaliation, Habsburg troops sacked the village of Maienfeld on February 7 and called the Swabian League for help. Only five days later, Swiss troops from several cantons had been assembled and reconquered the village and moved towards Lake Constance, pillaging and plundering along the way. On February 20, they again met a Habsburg army, which they defeated in the battle of Hard on the shores of Lake Constance near the estuary of the Rhine, and at about the same time, other Swiss troops invaded the Hegau region between Schaffhausen and Constance. On both sites, the Swiss retreated after a few days.\nMeanwhile, the Swabian League had completed its recruitment, and undertook a raid on Dornach on March 22, but suffered a defeat against numerically inferior Swiss troops in the battle of Bruderholz that same evening. In early April, both sides raided each other's territories along the Rhine; the Swiss conquered the villages of Hallau and Neunkirch in the Klettgau west of Schaffhausen. A larger attack of the Swabian League took place on April 11, 1499: the Swabian troops occupied and plundered some villages on the southern shore of Lake Constance, just south of Constance. The expedition ended in a shameful defeat and open flight when the Swiss soldiers, who had their main camp just a few miles south at Schwaderloh, arrived and met the Swabians in the battle of Schwaderloh. The Swabians lost more than 1,000 soldiers; 130 from the city of Constance alone; and the Swiss captured their heavy equipment, including their artillery.\n\nAgain, the Swiss raided the Klettgau and the Hegau and pillaged several fortified smaller Swabian cities such as Tiengen or Stühlingen before retreating again. This whole war was characterized by many such smaller raids and plundering expeditions of both sides between a few larger battles. On the eastern front, a new Habsburg attack on the Rhine valley provoked a counterstrike of the \"Eidgenossen\", who remained victorious in the battle of Frastanz near Feldkirch on April 20, 1499.\n\nThe continued defeats of both Habsburg and Swabian armies made king Maximilian, who had hitherto been occupied in the Netherlands, travel to Constance and assume the leadership of the operations himself. He declared an imperial ban over the Swiss Confederacy in an attempt to gain wider support for the operation amongst the German princes by declaring the conflict an \"imperial war\". However, this move had no success. Maximilian then decided that the next decisive attack should take place again in the Val Müstair, since he didn't have enough troops near Constance to risk attacking there. An abandoned attack attempt in the west in early May 1499 had drawn significant Swiss forces there, who subsequently raided the Sundgau. On May 21, the Swiss undertook a third raid in the Hegau, but abandoned the operation one week later after the city of Stockach withstood a siege long enough for Swabian relief troops to come dangerously close.\n\nSimultaneously, the Three Leagues attacked the Habsburg troops that camped again at Glurns on May 22, 1499, before Maximilian could arrive with reinforcements. They overran the fortifications and routed the Austrian army in the battle of Calven and then ravaged the Vinschgau, before retreating after three days. Maximilian and his troops arrived one week late, on May 29. In revenge, his troops pillaged the Engadin valley, but retreated quickly before reinforcements from the Swiss Confederacy arrived.\n\nThe refusal of the military leaders of the Swabian League to withdraw troops from the northern front to send them to the Grisons as Maximilian had demanded made the king return to Lake Constance. The differences between the Swabians, who preferred to strike in the north, and the king, who still hoped to convince them to help him win the struggle in the Val Müstair, led to a pause in the hostilities. Troops were assembled at Constance, but an attack did not occur. Until July, nothing of significance happened along the whole front.\n\nBy mid-July, Maximilian and the Swabian leaders suddenly were under pressure from their own troops. In the west, where there lay an army under the command of count Heinrich von Fürstenberg, a large contingent of mercenaries from Flanders and many knights threatened to leave as they had not received their pay. The foot soldiers of the Swabian troops also complained: most of them were peasants and preferred to go home and bring in the harvest. Maximilian was forced to act.\n\nAn attack by sea across Lake Constance on Rheineck and Rorschach on July 21 was one of the few successful Swabian operations. The small Swiss detachment was taken by surprise, the villages plundered and burnt. A much larger attack of an army of about 16,000 soldiers in the west on Dornach, however, met a quickly assembled but strong Swiss army. In the battle of Dornach on July 22, 1499, the Swabian and mercenary troops suffered a heavy defeat after a long and hard battle. Their general Heinrich von Fürstenberg fell early in the fight, about 3,000 Swabian and 500 Swiss soldiers died, and the Swabians lost all of their artillery again.\n\nOne of the last skirmishes of the war took place on July 25. A Swabian army marched from the Hegau on Schaffhausen, but met with fierce defense at Thayngen. Although the small force of defenders was finally overcome, and the village was pillaged, the defenders inflicted heavy casualties and the attack was held up long enough for the Swiss to send troops from Schaffhausen to meet the Swabians in the field. Misunderstandings between the Swabian knights and their foot soldiers made the Swabians retreat, and nightfall then prevented a larger battle.\n\nA major problem for the Swiss was the lack of any unified command. The cantonal contingents only took orders from their own leaders. Complaints of insubordination were common. The Swiss Diet had to adopt this resolution on 11 March 1499: \"Every canton shall impress upon its soldiers that when the Confederates are under arms together, each one of them, whatever his canton, shall obey the officers of the others.\"\n\nThe war was paid for largely by the French and Italian allies of the Swiss as well as by ransoming prisoners of war.\n\nEarly mediation attempts in March 1499 had failed because of mutual distrust between the parties. But after the battle of Dornach, the Swabian League was war-weary and had lost all confidence in the king's abilities as a military leader, and thus refused Maximilian's demands to muster a new army. The Swabian and Habsburg armies had suffered far higher human losses than the Swiss, and were also short on artillery, after repeatedly having lost their equipment to the Swiss. The Swiss also had no interest to prolong the war further, though they refused a first peace proposal that Maximilian presented at Schaffhausen in August 1499.\nHowever, events in the Italian Wars helped bring the Swabian War to an end. The French king Louis XII tried to bring the Duchy of Milan under his control. As long as the Swabian War continued, the Milanese ruler Ludovico il Moro—whose niece Bianca Maximilian had married in 1493—could not expect help from either Swiss mercenaries or Maximilian, and thus his envoy Galeazzo Visconti tried to mediate between the Swiss and the king. The French delegation at the \"Tagsatzung\", the federal diet and war council of the Swiss, tried to prevent any agreement for the same reason. The Milanese delegation prevailed in these intrigations and succeeded to persuade both sides to moderate their demands. Finally, a peace treaty between Maximilian I and the Swiss was signed in Basel on September 22, 1499. The peace treaty carefully played down the whole war from the \"imperial war\" that Maximilian had tried to make it by declaring the ban over the Confederacy to what it actually was: a war between two equal members of the empire (Imperial estate, or \"Reichsstände\"), namely the House of Habsburg and the Swiss Confederacy. The document referred to Maximilian only as \"duke of Habsburg\", not as \"king of the Germans\" or even \"Holy Roman Emperor\".\n\nWith the Peace of Basel, the relations between the Old Swiss Confederacy and the empire returned to the \"status quo ante\" from before the Diet of Worms in 1495. The imperial ban was dropped silently. Maximilian had to accept the refusal of the cantons and to abandon implicitly the Habsburg claims on their territories, acknowledging their independence. Consequently, the then ten members of the Swiss Confederacy remained exempt from the jurisdiction of the \"Reichskammergericht\". The Swiss henceforth exercised also the high justice over the Thurgau. The war had not caused any territorial changes, except in the area around Schaffhausen, where the city had succeeded to assert its hegemony over some places that had formerly belonged to the Bishop of Constance.\n\nIn the Grisons, the situation also reverted to pre-war conditions. The Habsburgs could keep their rights over eight of the communes of the \"Zehngerichtebund\", but also had to accept that league's alliance with the two other leagues and with the Swiss Confederacy. Ultimately, this arrangement would lead to the Habsburgs losing the Prättigau to the Three Leagues, with the exception of a temporary re-occupation during the Thirty Years' War nearly 130 years later.\n\nBasel had remained studiously neutral throughout the whole war. Although allied with some cantons of the Swiss Confederacy, it also had strong economic ties in the Alsace and further down along the Rhine. But the events of the war had strengthened the pro-confederate party in the city council, and the Swiss recognized the city's strategic position as a bridgehead on the Rhine (like Schaffhausen, too). On June 9, 1501, a delegation from Basel and the Swiss cantons' representatives signed the alliance contract, which the city council of Basel ratified on July 13, 1501.\n\nSchaffhausen had fought alongside the \"Eidgenossen\" during the Swabian War, and thus its acceptance into the Confederacy was a mere formality. The city had been an imperial city since 1415 and an associate state of the Confederacy since 1454 through a 25-year contract that had been renewed in 1479. On August 10, 1501, it became the twelfth member of the Confederacy.\n\nWith the end of the war, the Swiss troops were no longer bound along the Rhine and in the Grisons. The cantons concluded new mercenary contracts, so called capitulations, with the Duchy of Milan and soon got deeply involved in the Italian Wars, where Swiss mercenaries ended up fighting on both sides. The involvement of the Old Swiss Confederacy, acting in its own interests in these wars, was brought to an end by the defeat against French forces in the battle of Marignano in 1515 and a subsequent peace treaty with the French king in 1516, the so-called Eternal Peace. However, Swiss mercenaries from individual cantons of the federation continued to participate in the Italian Wars well beyond (until the middle of the 16th century) in the service of various parties and, following that peace with France, in particular in the service of the French king.\n\nThe Swiss Confederacy remained an independent \"Reichsstand\" of the Holy Roman Empire, but as it was not even obliged to participate in the Imperial Diet, this relation was degraded to a purely formal one that would lose significance throughout the 16th century. However, the Swiss still considered themselves as members of the empire with the status of imperial immediacy; the empire was still considered the foundation of all privileges, rights, or political identity as can be witnessed in the continued use of the imperial insignia. The relations between the Habsburgs and the Confederacy were fully normalized in the \"Erbeinung\" of 1511, a renewal of the earlier \"Ewige Richtung\" of 1474 and a first \"Erbeinung\" of 1477. In that treaty, the Habsburgs finally and officially gave up all their territorial claims of old, and even designated the Confederacy the protecting power of the County of Burgundy. In the Treaty of Westphalia of 1648, all members and associate states of the Confederacy would gain official full exemption from the empire and recognition as a national and political entity on their own right.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1881286", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1881286", "title": "Velvet (fish disease)", "text": "Velvet (fish disease)\n\nVelvet disease (also called gold-dust, rust and coral disease) is a fish disease caused by dinoflagellate parasites of the genus \"Piscinoodinium\", specifically \"Amyloodinium\" in marine fish, and \"Oodinium\" in freshwater fish. The disease gives infected organisms a dusty, brownish-gold color. The disease occurs most commonly in tropical fish, and to a lesser extent, marine aquaria.\n\nThe single-celled parasite's life cycle can be divided into three major phases. First, as a tomont, the parasite rests at the water's floor and divides into as many as 256 tomites. Second, these juvenile, motile tomites swim about in search of a fish host, meanwhile using photosynthesis to grow, and to fuel their search. Finally, the adolescent tomite finds and enters the slime coat of a host fish, dissolving and consuming the host's cells, and needing only three days to reach full maturity before detaching to become a tomont once more.\n\nVelvet (in an aquarium environment) is usually spread by contaminated tanks, fish, and tools (such as nets or testing supplies). There are also rare reports of frozen live foods (such as bloodworms) containing dormant forms of the species. Frequently, however, the parasite is endemic to a fish, and only causes a noticeable \"outbreak\" after the fish's immune system is compromised for some other reason. The disease is highly contagious and can prove fatal to fish.\n\nInitially, infected fish are known to \"flash\", or sporadically dart from one end of an aquarium to another, scratching against objects in order to relieve their discomfort. They will also \"clamp\" their fins very close to their body, and exhibit lethargy. If untreated, a 'dusting' of particles (which are in fact the parasites) will be seen all over the infected fish, ranging in color from brown to gold to green. In the most advanced stages, fish will have difficulty respiring, will often refuse food, and will eventually die of hypoxia due to necrosis of their gill tissue.\n\nSodium chloride (table/sea salt) is believed to mitigate the reproduction of velvet, however this treatment is not itself sufficient for the complete eradication of an outbreak. Additional, common medications added directly to the fish's environment include copper sulfate, methylene blue, formalin, malachite green and acriflavin, all of which can be found in common fish medications designed specifically to combat this disease. Additionally, because velvet parasites derive a portion of their energy from photosynthesis, leaving a tank in total darkness for seven days provides a helpful supplement to chemical curatives. Finally, some enthusiasts recommend raising the water temperature of an infected fish's environment, in order to quicken the life cycle (and subsequent death) of velvet parasites; however this tactic is not practical for all fish, and may induce immunocompromising stress.\n\n"}

Spikkestad railway station was opened in 1885 to link Asker to Drammen. The village was named after the farm \"Spikkestad\", as the station was built on its lands. In the early 1970s, a tunnel was built which made the trip between these places shorter, and most of the train track was closed. Spikkestad became the end terminus of Spikkestadbanen, and there are still trains running every half-hour. Spikkestad is also accessible by car.

(or RSG!) was a British rock/pop music television programme broadcast every Friday evening from 9 August 1963 until 23 December 1966. It was conceived by Elkan Allan, head of Rediffusion TV. Allan wanted a light entertainment programme different from the low-brow style of light entertainment transmitted by ATV. The programme was produced without scenery or costumes and with a minimum of choreography and make-up. Allan recruited a fellow journalist, Francis Hitching, as producer. Hitching became a major figure in light entertainment in the 1960s. Robert Fleming was the first director, followed by the documentary director Rollo Gamble, then Michael Lindsay-Hogg, Daphne Shadwell and Peter Croft.\n\nThe programme was produced by Associated-Rediffusion, the weekday ITV contractor for London, called Rediffusion-London after 1964. The live show was eventually networked nationally.\n\nThe show gained its highest ratings on 20 March 1964 when it featured the Beatles being interviewed and performing \"It Won't Be Long\", \"You Can't Do That\" and \"Can't Buy Me Love\" - the last a hit at the time.\n\n\"RSG! USA!\" was a Dick Clark production in 1964. A trademark infringement suit ended the show after six episodes.\n\nIn the 1980s Dave Clark of the Dave Clark Five acquired the rights to the 1960s UK music show and bought the rights to the surviving recordings.\n\nOn 10 January 2018, BMG Rights Management announced that it had acquired the ancillary rights to \"Ready, Steady, Go!\"\n\nThe show went out early on Friday evenings with the line \"The weekend starts here!\", and was introduced by the Surfaris' \"Wipe Out\", later by Manfred Mann's \"5-4-3-2-1\", then Manfred Mann's \"Hubble Bubble (Toil and Trouble)\", and finally The Rolling Stones \"Goin' Home\". There is also the possibility that The Who's \"Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere\" was used as the theme music for a short period. It was more youth-orientated and informal than its BBC rival (from 1964), \"Top of the Pops\". It was notable for featuring the audience as dancers, and for the interaction of artists and audience. Artists appeared on different mini-stages, sometimes on studio gantries and stairs, or on the main floor for solo artists, closely surrounded by the audience. The producers chose the audience in London clubs, picking out the best or the most fashionably dressed dancers. This ensured a hip audience in tune with the artists.\n\nOwing to scheduling of local news in parts of the UK, several ITV regions joined the show part-way through.\n\nInitially, \"RSG!\" artists mimed but by late 1964 some performed live and the show switched to all-live performances in April 1965. It was noted for allowing artists to perform the full version of songs rather than short versions demanded by other shows. The programme was never broadcast in the United States, perhaps because it was in black and white when ABC, CBS and NBC were converting to full colour.\n\nThe show was recorded at small studios in Rediffusion's headquarters in Kingsway, London. Although the company had bigger facilities at Wembley in the west of the capital, it was easier to attract stars and audiences to central London. As the studios were compact it was not possible to hide cameras. The ever-present cameras, which were large with rotating lens turrets rather than zooms, were sometimes incorporated into the action, notably in a Manfred Mann performance of \"Machines\" which ended with Paul Jones singing crouched on the floor surrounded by cameras.\n\nRSG was originally from Studio 9 in Kingsway when artists mimed; it later moved to Studio 5 at Wembley, enabling artists to perform live. Artists' own recorded backing tracks were not allowed by the Musicians' Union so the whole of Studio 5 (normally divided into 5a and 5b) was used so an orchestra could perform the backing live.\n\nThe show was popular among young people. It had a particular following among the mod youth subculture of the 1960s.\n\nIn late 1966, when the 'beat boom' was fading, the show was cancelled, despite its popularity. Compilations were broadcast on Channel 4 in the 1990s and VHS videos included a Beatles live special and The Sounds of Motown special edition. In 1989 the show was seen for the first time in the US, on Disney Channel. During that time, Disney was a pay channel aimed at adults at night. \"Ready Steady Go!\" has not been officially released on DVD.\n\nAfter the recording of the pilot episode on Tuesday July 16, 1963 Keith Fordyce approached a group of Mods who had travelled from Sheffield's King Mojo club and asked 'so you chaps have come all the way from Sheffield on a Tuesday no less. I expect you'll be eager to go home and get back to work, what with the weekend coming up and all.'\n\nJohn Varney, Sheffield 'Ace Face' replied 'are you kidding mate - the weekend starts here' and the slogan was born. Over the next three years Pete Stringfellow and the Sheffield Mojo crowd were regulars on the now renamed 'Ready Steady Go'.\n\nThe best known presenters were Keith Fordyce and Cathy McGowan, though early shows were introduced by Dusty Springfield. The show was occasionally presented by David Gell and Michael Aldred. Both McGowan and Aldred joined after answering an advertisement for \"a typical teenager\" as adviser. They found themselves presenting the show, and McGowan's status as a fan was evident in her style; stumbling over lines, losing her cool and her inexperience made her more rather than less popular, and by the end she was presenting alone. She also joined in fun and games, including miming with the Rolling Stones to other people's records, notably \"I Got You Babe\".\n\nIt featured most successful artists of the era, among them the Who, the Beatles, the Hollies, the Merseybeats, the Zombies, Dusty Springfield, the Supremes, the Temptations, the Walker Brothers, the Kinks, Paul Butterfield Blues Band, Gerry & the Pacemakers, the Fourmost, the Rolling Stones, Donovan (discovered by \"RSG!\"), the Fortunes, Helen Shapiro, P.J. Proby, Otis Redding, Freddie and the Dreamers, the Dave Clark Five, Bobby Vee, the Animals, Cilla Black, Gulliver's People, the Searchers, Georgie Fame and the Blue Flames, Billy Fury, Lulu, Marvin Gaye, Gene Pitney, the Beach Boys (who made their first appearance on British television on the show), Sandie Shaw, Burt Bacharach, Jerry Lee Lewis, Paul Simon (who would later cite his appearance as his worst experience while living in England), Kenny Lynch, the Small Faces, the Shirelles, James Brown & the Famous Flames, the Yardbirds, Them, Jim Reeves and the Four Pennies.\n\nDuring the 4 October 1963 episode — The Beatles' first appearance — Paul McCartney judged four teenage girls miming to Brenda Lee's \"Let's Jump the Broomstick\" (the group had opened for Lee before becoming famous), choosing 13-year-old Melanie Coe as winner. Three years later, after Coe's disappearance made the front page of the \"Daily Mirror\", McCartney used the article as the basis for \"She's Leaving Home\".\n\nJimi Hendrix made his first television appearance in Britain on \"RSG!\" with \"Hey Joe\", performing live. After this, his club tour sold out and he was added to a nationwide tour by the Walker Brothers.\n\nDusty Springfield devised and introduced the \"RSG\" Motown Special in April 1965, featuring the Supremes, Stevie Wonder, the Miracles and Martha and the Vandellas, which was a VHS video in the 1980s. The Supremes performed their \"Stop! In the Name of Love\" dance routine for the first time on the show...and The Miracles closed the show with their hit,\"Mickey's Monkey.\"\n\nThe Who proved particularly popular, making the most appearances of any artist - a total of 18 between January 1965 and December 1966. The band had an episode to themselves entitled \"Ready Steady Who\", broadcast in October 1966. The band also released an EP of the same name; despite the title all of the tracks were studio recordings which had been made previously. The Walker Brothers were also popular and had a live edition in 1966 but the tape was wiped, although extracts surfaced on YouTube in 2009 proving the group did not mime.\n\nOn 20 March 2020, BBC Four had a documentary on about Ready Steady Go, with original clips, plus interviews with Martha Reeves, Mary Wilson, Paul Jones, Chris Farlowe, Vicki Wickham, Annie Nightingale & Michael Lindsay Hogg.\n\n\n"}

His 2000 follow-up, \"Eterno\", was even more successful. Around this time, Fonsi also recorded a duet with Christina Aguilera for her 2000 Spanish-language album, \"Mi Reflejo\". On May 1, 2000, Fonsi performed at the Great Jubilee Concert for a Debt-Free World, an outdoor concert in Rome, attended by Pope John Paul II. That same year, Ednita Nazario won a Latin Grammy Award for a song composed by Fonsi. He also performed, with other artists, at the White House in honor of the victims of the September 11 attacks.\n\nIn 2002, Fonsi was the opening act for Britney Spears' Dream Within a Dream Tour in the US and Mexico. In the same year he debuted his English album \"Fight The Feeling\" trying to do a crossover with the first single \"Secret\" featuring Joey Fatone in the video. In 2003, Luis Fonsi performed to billions of viewers across the globe at Miss World 2003 in China.\n\nHis fifth CD, \"Abrazar la vida\", sold very well, which opened new markets in Europe. \"¿Quién Te Dijo Eso?\" reached number one on the \"Billboard\" Latin charts. During his time in the studio for the next album, Fonsi recorded \"Amazing\", a duet with Spice Girl Emma Bunton for her 2004 album \"Free Me\". His sixth CD, \"Paso a Paso\", debuted at number one and sent him into international markets. \"Nada Es Para Siempre\" also reached number one on the music charts, and was a nominee for the Latin Grammy Awards. In 2006, he contributed to \"El Piruli\", a tribute album honoring Víctor Yturbe, singing a classic bolero, \"Historia de un Amor.\"\n\nIn 2007, Luis Fonsi was selected to be part of the jury of the new version of the Latino boy band Menudo. The band would be a fusion of urban, pop and rock music in English and Spanish to produce several albums with the label of Sony BMG Epic Records. Several auditions were held in different cities such as Los Angeles, Dallas, Miami, New York, among others. Fonsi was a part of the Dallas competition where along the side of radio announcer Daniel Luna they chose varies contestants and in their pickings, rising star JC Gonzalez was 1 of the 25 selected.\n\nHis seventh CD, \"Palabras del Silencio\", debuted and stayed in the number one position for many weeks. Luis Fonsi entered the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100 for the first time in September 2008 with his song \"No Me Doy por Vencido\", debuting at number 98 and peaking at number 92. It reached number one on the \"Billboard\" Hot Latin Tracks chart, one of his biggest hits to date. \"No Me Doy por Vencido\" became \"Billboard\"s \"Latin Pop Song of the Decade,\" and spent 21 weeks at number one on the Hot Latin Songs chart.\n\nIn November 2009, Luis Fonsi was awarded a Latin Grammy Award for \"Song of the Year\" for his composition \"Aquí Estoy Yo\".\n\nOn December 11, 2009, Fonsi performed at the Nobel Peace Prize Concert in Oslo, honoring recipient President Barack Obama.\n\nIn 2011, Fonsi released the album \"Tierra Firme\", and went on tour to promote it throughout Latin America.\n\nOn July 9, 2011, Billboard named Fonsi \"Leader of Latin Music's New Generation\".\n\nIn 2014, Fonsi released his album \"8\", a reference to his eighth career album. He then did a tour named \"Somos Uno\" in 2014–15. He also mentioned that acting would be on his career path and that he wouldn't mind acting with Mexican actors and actresses.\n\nIn January 2017, \"Despacito\" featuring Daddy Yankee was promoted and released. On April 5, 2018, the music video reached five billion views on YouTube, with the song becoming number one in nearly every Latin \"Billboard\" chart, and the most viewed video in the world. In April 2017, the song was given an English remix featuring Canadian singer Justin Bieber. The remix featuring Bieber reached number one on the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100 for the week ending May 27, 2017, becoming both Fonsi and Yankee's first number one on the chart, and Bieber's fifth. Bieber promoted the remix at one of his shows in Puerto Rico, inviting Fonsi onto stage to perform the duet with him. The song remained number one for 16 consecutive weeks, tying One Sweet Day, by Mariah Carey and Boyz II Men as the longest reigning top song in the chart's history.\n\nIn November 2017, he released the song \"Échame la Culpa\", featuring Demi Lovato, which debuted at number three on the Hot Latin chart.

The track list contains \"Despacito (Remix) \", \"Échame la Culpa\" and \"Sola\". The album topped the Billboard Top Latin Albums and Spanish album chart, and entered at number 18 of the Billboard 200.\n\nIn 2019, Fonsi performed \"Right Where I'm Supposed to Be\" as the Official Song of the 2019 Special Olympics World Summer Games in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates in collaboration with Ryan Tedder, Avril Lavigne Hussain Al Jassmi, Assala Nasri and Tamer Hosny.\n\nOn July 26, 2019, Luis Fonsi performed at the opening ceremony of the 2019 Pan American Games in Lima, Peru. He sang his songs including his worldwide hit \"Despacito\" at the ceremony.\n\nIn 1992, Fonsi made a brief cameo in the romance film \"Como Agua Para Chocolate\" in which he played the friend of the male lead, Pedro Múzquiz.\n\nIn 2004, Fonsi made his second acting appearance on the Mexican telenovela named \"Corazones al límite\" in which he played Roy. He also had a special appearance in 2001 on the Nickelodeon television series \"Taina\". Fonsi joined the cast of Broadway's \"Forever Tango\" for a two-week engagement in August 2013\n\nIn 2003, Fonsi started to become romantically interested in actress Adamari López, who, as an Univision artist and fellow Puerto Rican, constantly found herself near Fonsi. That same year, Fonsi released the song \"Abrazar la vida\" (\"To Embrace the Life\"), off the eponymous album. The song would later become one of López's favorites.\n\nDuring 2005, Fonsi was in the middle of an international tour that was abruptly cancelled when López was diagnosed with cancer. Fonsi promised to stay by her side, and traveled with her to Mexico, Miami, and Puerto Rico for various treatment- and work-related trips. She has been in remission since 2006.\n\nOn June 3, 2006, Fonsi and Adamari López were married in a religious ceremony in Guaynabo, Puerto Rico, attended by many celebrities, including Joey Fatone, Charytín Goyco, Ednita Nazario, and Carlos Ponce, as well as his brother, aspiring singer Jean Rodríguez, professionally known as \"Jan\". On November 8, 2010, they officially divorced.\n\nFonsi and Spanish model Águeda López were married on September 10, 2014, after three years of living together.

{"id": "1881324", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1881324", "title": "United States Navy Reserve", "text": "United States Navy Reserve\n\nThe United States Navy Reserve (USNR), known as the United States Naval Reserve from 1915 to 2005, is the Reserve Component (RC) of the United States Navy. Members of the Navy Reserve, called reservists, are enrolled in the Selected Reserve (SELRES), the Individual Ready Reserve (IRR), the Full Time Support (FTS), or the Retired Reserve program.\n\nThe mission of the Navy Reserve is to provide strategic depth and deliver operational capabilities to the Navy and Marine Corps team, and Joint forces, in the full range of military operations from peace to war.\n\nThe Reserve consists of 108,718 (64,715 SELRES and 44,003 IRR) officers and enlisted personnel who serve in every state and territory as well as overseas as of September 2012.\n\nThe largest cohort, the SELRES, have traditionally drilled one weekend a month and two weeks of annual training during the year, receiving base pay and certain special pays (i.e., flight pay, dive pay, etc.) when performing Inactive Duty Training (IDT, aka \"drills\"), and full pay and allowances while on active duty for Annual Training (AT), Active Duty for Training (ADT), Active Duty for Operational Support (ADOS), Active Duty for Special Work (ADSW), or under Mobilization (MOB) orders or otherwise recalled to full active duty.\n\nEvery state, as well as Guam and Puerto Rico, has at least one Navy Operational Support Center (NOSC, formerly the Naval Reserve Center), staffed by Full Time Support (FTS) personnel, where the SELRES sailors come to do their weekend drills. The size of these centers varies greatly, depending on the number of assigned reservists. They are intended mostly to handle administrative functions and classroom style training. However, some NOSCs have more extensive training facilities, including damage control trainers and small boat units. Some NOSCs are co-located on existing military facilities, but most are \"outside-the-wire\", stand alone facilities that are often the only U.S. Navy representation in their communities or even the entire state. Because of this, NOSCs outside the fleet concentration areas are also heavily tasked to provide personnel, both FTS staff and SELRES, for participation in Funeral Honors Details. This service provided to the local community is one of the NOSC's top two priority missions (the other being training and mobilization of SELRES).\n\nThose SELRES assigned to front-line operational units, such as Naval Aviators, Naval Flight Officers, Naval Flight Surgeons and enlisted personnel assigned to Navy Reserve or Active-Reserve Integrated (ARI) aviation squadrons and wings, or personnel assigned to major combatant command, Fleet and other major staff positions, are typically funded for far more duty than the weekend per month/two weeks per year construct, often well in excess of 100-man-days per year. SELRES have also performed additional duty in times of war or national crisis, often being recalled to full-time active duty for one, two or three or more years and deploying to overseas locations or aboard warships, as has been recently seen during Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom.\n\nFTS, previously known as TAR (Training and Administration of the Reserve), serve in uniform all year round and provide administrative support to SELRES and operational support for the Navy. They are full-time career active duty personnel, but reside in the Reserve Component (RC), and perform a role similar to Active Guard and Reserve (AGR), Air Reserve Technician (ART) and Army Reserve Technician in the Air Force Reserve Command, the Air National Guard, the U.S. Army Reserve, and the Army National Guard.\n\nThe Individual Ready Reserve (IRR) do not typically drill or train regularly, but can be recalled to service in a full mobilization (requiring a Presidential order). Some IRR personnel who are not currently assigned to SELRES billets, typically senior commissioned officers in the ranks of commander or captain for whom SELRES billets are limited, will serve in Volunteer Training Units (VTU) or will be support assigned to established active duty or reserve commands while in a VTU status. These personnel will drill for points but no pay and are not eligible for Annual Training with pay. However, they remain eligible for other forms of active duty with pay and mobilization. The largest source of IRR Officers in the Navy Reserve are commissioned from the United States Merchant Marine Academy and comprise more than 75% of the Navy's Strategic Sealift Officer Community which is focused on strategic sealift and sea-based logistics.\n\nReservists are called to active duty, or mobilized, as needed and are required to sign paperwork acknowledging this possibility upon enrollment in the reserve program.\n\nAfter the 11 September attacks of 2001, Reservists were mobilized to support combat operations. The War on Terrorism has even seen the activation of a Reserve squadron, the VFA-201 Hunters, flying F/A-18 Hornet aircraft, which deployed on board the USS \"Theodore Roosevelt\" (CVN-71). Additionally, more than 52,000 Navy Reservists have been mobilized and deployed to serve in Iraq and Afghanistan, including more than 8,000 who have done a second combat tour. They have served alongside Army, Marine, Air Force, Coast Guard and service personnel from other countries, performing such missions as countering deadly improvised explosive devices, constructing military bases, escorting ground convoys, operating hospitals, performing intelligence analysis, guarding prisoners, and doing customs inspections for units returning from deployments.\n\nReflecting the importance of Reservists in the naval history of the United States, the first citizen sailors put to sea even before the Continental Congress created the Continental Navy, forerunner of today's U.S. Navy. On 12 June 1775, inspired to act after hearing the news of Minutemen and British regulars battling on the fields of Lexington and Concord, citizens of the seaside town of Machias, Maine, commandeered the schooner \"Unity\" and engaged the British warship HMS \"Margaretta\", boarding her and forcing her surrender after bitter close quarters combat. In the ensuing years of the American Revolution, the small size of the Continental Navy necessitated the service of citizen sailors, who put to sea manning privateers, their far-flung raids against the British merchant fleet as important as the sea battles of John Paul Jones in establishing the American naval tradition.\n\nFollowing the American Revolution, the expense of maintaining a standing navy was deemed too great, resulting in the selling of the last Continental Navy ship in 1785. However, attacks by Barbary pirates against American merchant vessels in the Mediterranean Sea prompted a change in course in 1794. A navy that helped give birth to the nation was now deemed essential to preserving its security, which faced its most serious threat during the War of 1812. Not only did reservists raid British commerce on the high seas, but they also outfitted a fleet of barges called the Chesapeake Bay Flotilla in an effort to defend that vital body of water against British invasion. Though overwhelmed by an enemy superior in numbers, these men, most recruited from Baltimore, continued to wage war on land, joining in the defense of Washington, D.C.\n\nHaving fought against a foreign power, naval reservists faced a much different struggle with the outbreak of the Civil War, which divided a navy and a nation. Within days of the attack, President Abraham Lincoln authorized an increase in the personnel levels of the Navy, which assumed an important role in the strategy to defeat the Confederacy with a blockade of the South and a campaign to secure control of the Mississippi River. By war's end the Navy had grown from a force numbering 9,942 in 1860 to one manned by 58,296 sailors. A total of 101,207 men from twenty-one states enlisted during the war and volunteers were present during some of the storied naval engagements of the American Civil War, including serving in \"Monitor\" during her battle with CSS \"Virginia\" and the daring mission to destroy the Confederate ironclad CSS \"Albermarle\". The latter action resulted in the awarding of the Medal of Honor to six reserve enlisted men.\n\nWith the lack of any major threat to the United States in the post-Civil War years, the U.S. Navy took on the appearance and missions of the force it had in 1860. Then came publication of naval theorist Captain Alfred Thayer Mahan's landmark study \"The Influence of Sea Power Upon History\", which in part prompted a modernization of the U.S. fleet and brought some of the first calls for an organized naval reserve to help man these more advanced ships. In the meantime, state naval militias represented the Navy's manpower reserve, demonstrating their capabilities during the Spanish–American War in which they assisted in coastal defense and served aboard ship. Militiamen from Massachusetts, New York, Michigan, and Maryland manned four auxiliary cruisers—\"Prairie\", \"Yankee\", \"Yosemite\", and \"Dixie\"—seeing action off Cuba. All told, some 263 officers and 3,832 enlisted men of various state naval militias answered the call to arms.\n\nAs successful as the state naval militias were in the Spanish–American War, which made the United States a world power, events unfolding in Europe following the turn of the century demonstrated that a modern war at sea required a federal naval reserve force. The first formally funded naval reserve force was organized around the United States Merchant Marine with the formation of the Merchant Marine Reserve, then called the Naval Auxiliary Reserve, in 1913. With the outbreak of World War I in 1914, the Secretary of the Navy Josephus Daniels and his assistant, a young New Yorker named Franklin D. Roosevelt, launched a campaign in Congress to appropriate funding for such a force. Their efforts brought passage of legislation on 3 March 1915, creating the Naval Reserve Force, whose members served in the cockpits of biplanes and hunted enemy U-boats during the Great War.\n\nThough the financial difficulties of the Great Depression and interwar isolationism translated into difficult times for the Naval Reserve, the organizational structure persevered and expanded with the creation of Naval Aviation Cadet program and the Naval Reserve Officer Training Corps. When World War II erupted on 1 September 1939, the Naval Reserve was ready. By the summer of 1941, virtually all of its members were serving on active duty, their numbers destined to swell when Japanese planes roared out of a clear blue sky over Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941. Navy reserve sailors from Minnesota aboard the USS \"Ward\" fired the first U.S. shots of World War II by sinking a Japanese mini-submarine outside the entrance to Pearl Harbor. Over the course of the ensuing four years, the Navy would grow from a force of 383,150 to one that at its peak numbered 3,405,525, the vast majority of them reservists, including five future U.S. presidents.\n\nThe end of World War II brought a different struggle in the form of the Cold War, which over the course of nearly five decades was waged with the haunting specter of nuclear war. Cold War battlegrounds took naval reservists to Korea, where a massive mobilization of \"Weekend Warriors\" filled out the complements of ships pulled from mothballs and in some cases sent carriers to sea with almost their entire embarked air groups consisting of Reserve squadrons. Other calls came during the Berlin Crisis and Vietnam, and with the defense build-up of the 1980s, presided over by Secretary of the Navy John Lehman, a naval reservist, the Naval Reserve not only expanded, but also took steps towards greater interoperability with the active component with respect to equipment. Yet, the divisions between the active and reserve cultures remained distinct.\n\nThis began to change in the 1990s as over 21,000 Naval Reservists supported the Persian Gulf War's Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm, which coincided with the ongoing collapse of the Soviet Union. Since that time, whether responding to the ethnic cleansing in the former Yugoslavia or the threat of world terrorism, the latter coming to the forefront in the attacks against the World Trade Center and the Pentagon on 11 September 2001, the recently renamed Navy Reserve has transformed from a force in waiting for massive mobilization to an integral component in carrying out the mission of the U.S. Navy. As Admiral William J. Fallon stated, \"We must remember that the Reserves, which represent twenty percent of our warfighting force, are absolutely vital to our Navy's ability to fight and win wars now and in the future.\"\n\nOffice of the Chief of Naval Reserve was established as Director of Naval Reserve, with the consolidation of the Navy Air and Surface Reserve headquarters organizations at the Naval Support Activity, NAS New Orleans, Louisiana in April 1973.\n\nPersons who enlist in the Active duty program first sign a contract to enter the Ready Reserve for a period of time that coincides with time served as Active Duty. Upon separation from Active Duty, members may still be obligated by their reserve contract if it has not expired. The remainder of the contract may be served as a member of the Selected Reserve or the Individual Ready Reserve.\n\nPrior service enlistees may be able to affiliate with the Navy Reserve in their active duty rating (job specialty) and paygrade.\n\nNon-prior service enlistees are sent to Initial Active Duty Training (IADT), also called boot camp, located at Naval Station Great Lakes in Illinois (same location as Active Duty training) and qualify for a specific billet (job) in order to make their rate permanent. Very few ratings are available to non-prior service personnel. Based upon their skill sets, members will enter into service at paygrades E-1 through E-3. Although non-prior service recruits are paid from their first day at the advanced pay grade, they are not entitled to wear the insignia signifying their rank until they successfully complete boot camp. After graduating from boot camp, the reservist usually trains at a Navy Operational Support Center (NOSC) again to complete the final \"Phase IV\" requirements. After that, he or she is sent to a reserve unit.\n\nTypically, the Reservist is required to drill one weekend every month and spend a consecutive two-week period every year at a regular Navy base or on board a ship. While training either for just a weekend or during the two weeks, the Reservist is on active duty and the full spectrum of rules and regulations, including the Uniform Code of Military Justice, apply.\n\nUnited States Navy reservists are allowed to serve simultaneously in the United States Navy Reserve and in the naval militia of their state of residence; however, when called into federal service, reservists are relieved from service and duty in the naval militia until released from active duty.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt least three characters in popular TV shows were officers in the Navy Reserve. These were Lt.Commander Steve McGarrett of \"Hawaii Five-O\", Captain R. Quincy of \"Quincy, M.E.\", and Lt.Commander Thomas Magnum of \"Magnum PI\". They were veterans of World War II, the Korean War, and Vietnam, respectively.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1881325", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1881325", "title": "American Front", "text": "American Front\n\nAmerican Front (AF) is a white supremacist organization founded in San Francisco, California by Bob Heick in 1984. It began as a loose organization modeled after the British National Front. Heick began working with Tom Metzger's White Aryan Resistance (WAR) in 1988. Heick and artist Boyd Rice posed for photos in AF uniforms for an article on neo-Nazism in \"Sassy\" magazine. Rice claims he was never really a member of the American Front, but that he was friends with Heick.\n\nIn 1985, after years of associating with peers of all races, Bob Heick began writing and distributing leaflets, mostly from a nationalist anti-communist stance, in response to the increasing leftist influence in the local punk subculture. Originally intended as an umbrella organization for all American skinheads, AF had no formal structure or membership. In San Francisco, Heick lost favor with the mostly apolitical skinheads. Media attention and constant vandalism and assault (such as breaking the windows of the \"Bound Together\" anarchist bookstore and harassing interracial couples in the Haight-Ashbury) by the group brought increased attention from the local police. In addition, Heick's progression from patriotism to Nazism lost him many friends, and some people accused him of trying to take over the local skinhead scene. Heick then started associating with heavy metal music fans and rural white workers. He formed the short-lived group \"United White Brethren\" in the North and South Bay Areas.\n\nUpon his return to San Francisco in 1987, Heick found the newer generation of local skinheads to be more receptive to Nazism. The AF transformed into a political organization, and its membership was no longer exclusively skinheads. On the AF telephone hotline, at the end of the telephone message, the voice of Heick asked \"Do you have hate in your heart?\" The AF telephone hotline often repeated a quote from the San Francisco-born author Jack London: \"I'm a worker, but first of all I'm a white worker\". On May 1, 1988, AF held its first White Workers Day march on Haight Street in San Francisco, in which 65 participants, which included a few long haired white hippies who had spontaneously joined the march, marched unopposed. This was heralded by Tom Metzger of White Aryan Resistance on his telephone hotline, in the WAR newspaper, and on television. The AF tabloid \"Aryan Warrior\" was published soon after. Metzger began presenting Heick to the media as a spokesman for white power skinheads. Heick appeared on the TV news magazine \"The Reporters\", in a segment that mainly focused on Heick and included footage of the Mayday march. AF was also featured in publications such as \"Rolling Stone\", \"Hustler\", and \"Sassy\". By 1989, there were AF units in 14 American states.\n\nHeick started to organize a concert of white power bands on rural land near Napa, California, a suburb of San Francisco in the northern part of the San Francisco Bay Area. Heick was pushed aside by Tom Metzger, and the concert became a White Aryan Resistance event instead of an AF event. Heick and Metzger disagreed on almost every facet of the festival, including the name, \"Aryan Woodstock\". Heick disagreed with Metzger's promotion of the event on his phone hotline, because it was monitored by anti-racist activists, and would give them time to organize against the event. A WAR activist was told by three bureaucrats that no permit would be required to play live music at a private event on private land, as long as sanitation was provided for.\n\nDuring the two weeks leading up to Aryan Woodstock, the event was a leading local news story. Napa County sought an injunction to block the gathering, and Heick appeared before a judge to defend AF and WAR's right to assemble. The judge ruled that the gathering may take place, but that there could be no music. Approximately 300 people from across the United States arrived on the property before the landowner caved to police pressure and allowed the authorities to close off the entrance. This stranded many would-be attendees, some who had traveled great distances to be there. Several hundred protesters were outside the property. Tension between AF and WAR increased soon after. Heick spent the next year visiting various AF units in California and across the United States before getting married and settling down in Portland, Oregon.\n\nIn 1990, Heick announced on the AF telephone hotline that the group would appear in San Francisco's Union Square on the first Saturday in May. The message ran for a month prior to the event. Opponents of the AF held a Mayday demonstration three days prior, on May 1. On the day of the AF event, Heick arrived with 10 men and three women, and marched into 300 missile-throwing protesters. Police, seeing that the AF contingent was completely surrounded by violent counter protesters, moved in and encircled AF, separating the two groups. At this point, both the AF and SFPD were vastly outnumbered by counter protesters, who were hurling rocks, bottles and attacking both the officers and AF with 2x4 sign posts. Back-up officers began arriving on the scene and the police were able to get a patrol wagon into the park. All 13 AF members scrambled into the wagon (without handcuffs) and were whisked away for their own safety. Officers fought off the continuing attacks of the counter protesters who then fled the scene. There were a number of injuries on all sides.\n\nIn October 1990, The Coalition for Human Dignity published fliers featuring Heick's new home address in Portland, Oregon, and distributed press releases announcing his arrival. Local TV news crews arrived at Heick's apartment a few days after he moved in. Heick still received regular invitations to appear on national television, but many of the new offers were to appear on trash TV shows. Heick refused those offers, restricting his interviews to genuine news programs. He has appeared on the Geraldo Rivera Show even though as stated before, he denied most offers. As press interest in Heick and AF waned, Heick focused on local activism. AF's 1991 May Day demonstration was held in Portland. There was a large counter protest, but no violence. In 1992, Heick and AF associates were the first out-of-state activists to arrive at the Randy Weaver stand-off at Ruby Ridge. Heick blockaded a fuel truck and lambasted the driver for supporting the government.\n\nAround this time, AF focused on demonstrations and literature distribution. The group's telephone hotline was revived in Portland and remained active until Heick left the group in 1995. In the 1990s, the Washington and California AF sections published \"The Voice of Revolution\" magazine, which had strong ties to Combat 18 in England. In New York, Jim Porazzo published \"Greystorm\". In Portland, Heick published \"Revolutionary Nationalist\" AF focused on opposing hate crime laws, which they claimed only targeted whites. AF became known for harassing Portland city commissioner Mike Lindberg, who called the group \"gay bashing skinheads\" in the press. The Albany, Oregon area AF unit held regular demonstrations. AF briefly resurfaced under the leadership of Porazzo, who moved the group to Harrison, Arkansas and began to promote Third Positionism.\n\nOn May 5, 2012, ten members of the Florida branch of the American Front were arrested in St. Cloud, Florida, 25 miles from the Walt Disney World theme parks, and charged with paramilitary training, shooting into an occupied dwelling and evidence of prejudices while committing an offense.\n\nMarcus Faella, and an eventual total of thirteen of his American Front associates were arrested. On November 10, 2014, Faella was convicted for his part in attempting to incite a \"race war\" but was sentenced to only 6 months in jail. One commentator described the case against the American Front as \"floundering\", while the judge described the group as \"the gang that couldn't shoot straight\".\n\nMarcus Faella obtained attorney Augustus Sol Invictus to appeal the case.\n"}

The specific epithet \"oxycedrus\" means \"sharp cedar\" and this species may have been the original cedar or \"cedrus\" of the ancient Greeks.\n\n\"Juniperus oxycedrus\" is very variable in shape, forming a spreading shrub tall to a small erect tree tall. It has needle-like leaves in whorls of three; the leaves are green, long and broad, with a double white stomatal band (split by a green midrib) on the inner surface. It is usually dioecious, with separate male and female plants. The seed cones are berry-like, green ripening in 18 months to orange-red with a variable pink waxy coating; they are spherical, diameter, and have three or six fused scales in 1-2 whorls, three of the scales with a single seed. The seeds are dispersed when birds eat the cones, digesting the fleshy scales and passing the hard seeds in their droppings. The pollen cones are yellow, long, and fall soon after shedding their pollen in late winter or early spring.\n\nAs to be expected from the wide range, \"J. oxycedrus\" is very variable. One recent study splits it into three species, though other authorities do not accept this:\n\nAn additional variety or subspecies \"J. oxycedrus\" var. \"badia\" H.Gay (syn. \"J. oxycedrus\" subsp. \"badia\" (H.Gay) Debeaux) is distinguished on the basis of larger cones ( diameter), tinged purple when mature; it is described from northern Algeria, and also reported from Portugal and Spain.\n\nA further species \"Juniperus macrocarpa\", confined to Mediterranean coastal sands, is more distinct but has also often been treated as a subspecies of Prickly Juniper, as \"J. oxycedrus\" subsp. \"macrocarpa\"; it differs in the broader leaves wide, and larger cones diameter.\n\nOther close relatives of \"J. oxycedrus\" include \"Juniperus brevifolia\" on the Azores, \"Juniperus cedrus\" on the Canary Islands and \"Juniperus formosana\" in eastern Asia.\n\nCade oil is the essential oil obtained through destructive distillation of the wood of this shrub. It is a dark, aromatic oil with a strong smoky smell which is used in some cosmetics and (traditional) skin treatment drugs, as well as incense. Cade oil has, on rare occasions, caused severe allergic reactions in infants.\n\n"}

Winzen and General Mills, Inc. They were used by the United States Navy Office of Naval Research (ONR) in the late 1940s and 1950s for atmospheric research, especially for constant-level meteorological observations at very high altitudes. Instruments like the Cherenkov detector were first used on Skyhook balloons.\n\nIn the late 1940s, Project Skyhook was conceived of as a means by which plastic balloons could be used to transmit or send instruments into the stratosphere to conduct research. This project carried forward work from an earlier project, Helios, that General Mills and Jean Piccard initiated to use arrays of giant plastic balloons to carry humans aloft.\n\nBalloons, long used for collecting meteorological data, now offered the opportunity of collecting highly specialized information and photographs. The first Skyhook balloon was launched on September 25, 1947. The balloon was developed by the Aeronautical Division of General Mills. It carried a payload of nuclear emulsion to over . At low level immediately after launch, the lifting gas (hydrogen or helium) in the balloons formed a small bubble at the top of the envelope, resulting in the balloon having a \"limp\" look. At the lower air pressure at higher altitudes, the gas expanded and eventually filled the whole envelope forming a sphere or ovoid. In some models the balloons could reach diameters of more than 30 m.\n\nIn the succeeding 10 years, over 1,500 Skyhook flights were made for investigations supported by the ONR and for European scientists. These flights were made from locations in the United States, Canada, and naval vessels in the Atlantic, Pacific, Caribbean, and Arctic waters. Both Winzen Research and General Mills participated in these launchings, and in later years, the Atomic Energy Commission joined ONR in support of Project Skyhook.\n\nAmong significant flights, Project Skyhook launched the first successful three-balloon cluster in 1948. Then in 1949 the first shipboard Skyhook launch took place. It was followed by nearly 300 shipboard launchings over the next 10 years.\n\nThe first manned plastic balloon flight under ONR contract took place in 1949. Project Rockoon, in 1952, featured a Skyhook balloon that released small Deacon rockets at about above arctic waters.\n\nOne of the first known attempts to carry out an astrophysical measurement from a plastic balloon occurred under the Skyhook program on June 30, 1954. During the solar eclipse on that date two Skyhook balloons were launched by Winzen Research with camera gondolas employing simple orientating systems. The objective was to photograph the eclipse from high altitude. Varied photographic equipment was carried and aimed at the Sun to obtain full coverage for the total period of totality.\n\nOn September 7, 1956, the University of Minnesota launched a giant Mylar balloon (developed by the G. T. Schejeldahl Corporation of Northfield, MN) to set an unofficial balloon altitude record of for unmanned balloons. In 1957 the US Navy began an operational aerology system known as Transosonde (trans-ocean sounding), consisting of almost daily balloon flights across the Pacific Ocean from Japan.\n\nOn August 19, 1957, an unmanned Skyhook balloon lifted the first Project Stratoscope telescope. Project Stratoscope I was a program developed to research the Sun. Instruments included a 12-inch (30-centimeter) telescope with a special light-sensitive pointing system and a closed circuit television camera that was guided by the scientists on the ground. This was the first balloon-borne telescope. The telescope took more than 400 photographs of sunspots. These were the sharpest photographs taken of the Sun up to that time. The photographs increased scientists' understanding of the motions observed in the strong magnetic fields of the sunspots.\n\nIn 1948 Skyhook balloons were used to show that in addition to protons and electrons, cosmic rays also include high energy atomic nuclei that are stripped of their electrons. Thirteen stratospheric plastic Skyhook balloons were launched in September 1953 as part of Project Churchy, an Office of Naval Research funded cosmic ray expedition at the geomagnetic equator. Project Churchy was conducted at the Galápagos because high-energy cosmic-ray particles can only be collected at the geomagnetic equator without accompanying low-energy particles found at higher latitudes. Balloons carrying scientific instruments rose to between and and encountered temperatures as low as -80 °C (-112 °F). Aircraft from Patrol Squadron (VP) 45 ‘Pelicans’ took off an hour after the launch of each balloon and visually tracked the balloon until it released its cargo and deflated. The instruments were observed until splashdown, and marked for destroyers to retrieve.\n\nSkyhook balloons may have been the origin of some UFO observations. The most famous case possibly involving a Skyhook mis-sighting was the Mantell UFO Incident. (The script of the film \"Earth vs. the Flying Saucers\" (1956) mentions \"Project Skyhook\").\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1881332", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1881332", "title": "HM Prison Birmingham", "text": "HM Prison Birmingham\n\nHM Prison Birmingham is a Category B men's prison, located in the Winson Green area of Birmingham, England. The prison was operated by G4S from 2011, before it was returned to HM Prison and Probation Service in August 2018. The government takeover was originally planned to be temporary pending improvement, but became permanent in April 2019.\n\nHM Prison Birmingham was formerly called Winson Green Prison. It is a Victorian prison, designed by DR Hill, who also designed All Saints' Hospital, which was completed in 1849.\n\nIn 1995, Birmingham was criticised by its own Board of Visitors for being soft on prisoners. This arose after allegations that one inmate had gone on two weeks' holiday to Menorca, while being released for weekend leave.\n\nIn January 1999 an inspection report by Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons attacked conditions at Birmingham, describing the health centre in the jail as the \"untidiest and dirtiest\" inspectors had ever come across. The report also criticised the prison for its lack of a sex offender treatment programme, the lack of employment and education opportunities, and the inadequate bathing arrangements where some inmates were only being allowed a full wash three times a week.\n\nIn March 2001 the Chief Inspector declared that conditions had worsened in Birmingham Prison where around 11% of inmates had claimed to have been assaulted by prison officers. One particular incident involved a mentally-disturbed prisoner who had been denied a wash or change of clothes for weeks because staff thought he was faking his illness.\n\nIn 2002 the prison was expanded as a result of a multimillion-pound investment programme by the Prison Service. 450 additional prisoner places were added together with new workshops, educational facilities, a new healthcare centre and gym as well as extensions and improvements to existing facilities. Two years later, a report from the Chief Inspector found that conditions at Birmingham had substantially improved, stating that the prison was a place where \"positive attitudes are firmly embedded\".\n\nIn November 2007, the Independent Monitoring Board warned in a report that overcrowding at Birmingham was putting prisoners and staff at risk. The report stated that if overcrowding was not tackled, then there was a potential for unrest. Two years later, the Board issued another report that criticised levels of overcrowding at Birmingham Prison. The report also noted that inmates from the jail were being transferred to prisons further north, to accommodate increased prisoner levels from the South-East of England.\n\nBirmingham became the first publicly built, owned and operated prison in the UK to be transferred to the private sector. G4S formally took over the day-to-day running of the prison in October 2011. Shortly after taking over the operation of the prison, G4S had to spend £500,000 replacing all the keys and locks in the prison after the master keys went missing.\n\nNumerous judicial executions by hanging took place at the prison until the abolition of capital punishment in the UK. The first was that of Henry Kimberley, on 17 March 1885, for the murder of Emma Palmer. A total of 35 executions took place at Birmingham prison during the 20th century. The last person ever to be hanged at the prison was a 20-year-old Jamaican named Oswald Augustus Grey. He was executed on 20 November 1962 after being convicted of the shooting death of newsagent Thomas Bates during the course of a robbery in Lee Bank Road on 3 June 1962. Christopher Simcox, a double-murderer, was scheduled for execution at Birmingham prison on Tuesday, 17 March 1964, but was reprieved.\n\nBirmingham holds adult male prisoners, serving the Crown and Magistrates' Courts of Birmingham, Stafford and Wolverhampton and the Magistrates' Courts of Burton upon Trent, Cannock.\nEducation and training at Birmingham Prison is provided by NOVUS, part of The Manchester College group. Learning programmes for inmates include basic and key skills, bricklaying, plumbing, painting and decorating, carpentry, joinery, forklift truck training, industrial cleaning, catering, textiles, barbering, information technology, business, creative arts and performing arts. All courses lead to qualifications such as NVQs, and there is the option for further study with the Open University.\n\nThe Prison Library Service is provided by Birmingham City Council's Library Services, and all prisoners have access to the service. As well as facilities for independent learners, the library has special collections on law, employment, health, community information, English as a second or other language (ESOL), and basic skills materials. There is also a Learning Centre within the library to provide additional learning support to those with dyslexia and ESOL needs.\n\nPhysical education at Birmingham is provided on a daily basis over a 7-day period, and evenings over 5 days. There are a number of sports delivered and also sports related subjects from basic skills to NVQ Level 2 in Sports and Recreation.\n\nBirmingham has a prison chaplaincy with full-time chaplains from the Church of England, Roman Catholic, Free Church and Muslim faiths. There are also sessional staff from the Sikh, Buddhist and Hindu faiths.\n\nAssaults by prisoners have been rising with an average of three assaults a week on staff, some serious. There have also been assaults and serious assaults by prisoners on other prisoners. Drones were used to bring drugs into the prison which Petherick of G4S confirmed.\n\nIn June 2016 inspectors said prison violence was increasing because of large amounts of illegal drugs in the prison.\n\nIn autumn 2016 concerns were expressed about drugs which can make prisoners violent being smuggled into the prison. Jerry Petherick of G4S who run the prison claimed \"a very small minority of staff are corrupt\". Petherick also said contraband was brought in by visitors, by drones and was thrown over the walls.\n\nStaff shortages were also problematic influencing efficiency, morale, and wellbeing. Jobs for prison officers at Birmingham Prison were advertised with a starting salary of just under £10 an hour.\n\nThere was reportedly a buildup of frustration over prison conditions prior to the riot. Low staff numbers, poor healthcare and nutrition were cited as factors. Also being on, 'lockdown' in their cells all day was cited as a major contributing factor to the disturbance.\n\nOn 16 December 2016, a prison guard was reportedly \"rushed\" by inmates leading to a rapid escalation of what prison officials described as \"trouble\". According to a G4S statement, staff retreated from two of the prison's four wings, sealing the abandoned sections before withdrawing. The disturbances, however, subsequently spread to the remaining two wings. According to a different account of events told by a \"prison affairs blogger\" quoted by \"The Guardian\", the breakdown in order began after inmates seized control of fire hoses and began breaking lights. Prison staff attempted to lock down inmates in their cells, however, during the operation a guard's keys were stolen, whereupon security staff were ordered to evacuate the wing. An injured prisoner was baited.\n\nA Prison Officers Association spokesman described the incident as, \"another stark warning to the Ministry of Justice that the service is in crisis\". Shadow justice secretary, Richard Burgon said, “This is only the latest in a number of disturbances across the prison estate. The justice secretary is failing to get this crisis under control.”<ref name=\"Guardian16/12/2016\">HMP Birmingham prison rioters will face 'full force of law', says Truss \"The Guardian\"</ref>\nMichael Spurr of National Offender Management Service Agency claimed drugs, overcrowding, and reduced staffing had put prisons under pressure.<ref name=\"bbc17/12/2016\">HMP Birmingham riot: 240 prisoners to be moved after riot \"BBC\"</ref>\n\nOne inmate in the prison's G wing, which is reserved for sex offenders, reportedly informed his solicitor that, during the disturbance, rioting inmates had attempted to gain access to that section of the facility and that prisoners were \"terrified\" they would be attacked.\n\nOn Friday evening, specialist riot squads from Her Majesty's Prison Service were dispatched to assume control of the situation due to the scale of the disturbance, which had grown to involve more than 600 inmates. By late that day, prison officials were reportedly back in control of the facility. 460 prisoners were moved to other prisons and some caused problems at Hull Prison. The Birmingham riot was described by one source as the worst prison disturbance in a B category prison in the United Kingdom since the 1990 Strangeways Prison riot. The Birmingham riot caused about £2 million worth of damage.<ref name=\"bbc21/12/2016\">HMP Birmingham riot repairs 'will cost £2m'</ref>\n\nThis is the third serious incident within under two months, Riots previously happened at Bedford Prison and Lewes Prison and a subsequent riot happened at Swaleside Prison.\n\nAfter the riot inspectors found violence and illegal drug use were still problematic. Some prisoners felt unsafe. Prison wings damaged during the riot were not reopened until April 2017. There was a further disturbance in September 2017 Prisoners refused to return to their cells and 28 were subsequently moved.\n\n6 prisoners died from January 2018 to late April 2018, one was from natural causes and the others are under investigation. 7 prisoners died during 2017.<ref name=\"BBC28/4/2018\">Six people have died at HMP Birmingham in 2018 \"BBC\"</ref> One prisoner death was self-inflicted. The Howard League for Penal Reform maintains the figure for deaths is the joint highest in England and Wales in 2018, together with HMP Durham, and considers it \"extremely concerning\". Roger Swindells, of the Independent Monitoring Board for Birmingham Prison described problems including overcrowding, with prisoners facing cramped conditions in Victorian cells, also cockroach and rat infestations. There is a high rate of sickness among prison officers and the prison has trouble retaining staff.\n\nIn August 2018 the government announced they were taking Birmingham prison over because it is in a state of crisis. Peter Clarke maintained some prisoners are afraid to leave their cells and described Birmingham Prison as, \"the worst prison he had ever been to.\" Clarke maintained there was a \"dramatic deterioration\" in conditions after the 2016 riot and reported there was a lack of order, where violent people could act with \"near impunity\". Some staff locked themselves in their offices, and parts of the prison were filthy, with blood, vomit and rat droppings on the floor. Clarke described an, \"abject failure\" to manage and deliver the contract at Birmingham. Clarke wrote, \"The inertia that seems to have gripped both those monitoring the contract and delivering it on the ground has led to one of Britain's leading jails slipping into a state of crisis that is remarkable even by the low standards we have seen all too frequently in recent years.\" In 2017 1,147 assaults including fights were recorded at the prison. This was higher than for any other prison in England or Wales that year and five times higher than 2012, the first complete year that G4S ran the prison. \n\nPrisoners effectively ran some wings, staff were afraid to leave their offices, inspectors and NHS staff felt unable to enter some wings due to large amounts of drugs in the atmosphere affecting them. Rory Stewart maintains more should be done to prevent drugs like spice getting into the prison as these drugs cause, “crazy aggressive behaviour”. Steve Gillan of the Prison Officers Association stated, “The secretary of state needs to resign and there now needs to be a full public inquiry into the prison system in England and Wales. We cannot continue like this. Government should now halt any other intention to privatise. The warning signs have been at Birmingham for all to see yet ministers have buried their heads in the sand and chosen to ignore it. They knew Birmingham was struggling before and after the riot [in December 2016] yet chose to do nothing.” Gillan maintained prisons were being privatised for ideological reasons.\n\nClarke refers to the \"disturbing case\" of a troubled prisoner with personal hygiene problems who was \"soaked\" with water from a fire hose by other prisoners. Clarke said, \"We struggle to understand how staff could have allowed this appalling bullying to take place.\" Inspectors found a further \"distressed\" prisoner who sat on \"scruffy material on the springs of his bed\" since the mattress was stolen three days before. Clarke maintains this indicates the, \"day-to-day vulnerability\" of some prisoners. Clarke maintained further, \"It was often difficult to find officers, although we did find some asleep during prisoner lock-up periods,\" and added that \"ineffective frontline management and leadership\" were basic to the prison's problems. \n\nPrisoners did little to conceal use of psychoactive substances or trade in those substances and staff accepted the situation. Prisoners who had taken spice walked around like zombies. There had been three \"likely\" drug-related deaths since the previous inspection. It had been noted that spice and similar drugs were available at Birmingham Prison. Inspectors stated, \"We witnessed many prisoners under the influence of drugs and some openly using and trafficking drugs around the prison. Incidents involving new psychoactive substances (NPS) were routine and we often smelt cannabis on the wings. Shockingly, staff were too often ambivalent and accepting of such incidents.\" Other findings were, the prison was \"exceptionally violent and fundamentally unsafe\", many prisoners and staff lived and worked in fear, frightened, vulnerable prisoners segregated themselves in locked cells but faeces and urine were thrown through their door panels, prisoners could misbehave, \"with near impunity\", many prisoners were living in, \"squalor and little was done to adequately occupy them, leaving many simply to mill around on wings\", Birmingham prison was \"failing in its responsibility to protect the public by preparing prisoners adequately for release, including hundreds of sex offenders\" Peter Clarke wants an independent analysis, \"as to how HMP Birmingham descended into appalling, chaotic conditions.\" The Independent Monitoring Board for the prison stated part of the problem was that the prison reopened to soon after the December 2016 riot. This was because of, \"commercial pressures\" and increasing numbers of prisoners. Chair, Roger Swindells said, \"Re-opening without CCTV on those wings, and with various services not fully functioning and with limited access to education facilities did not assist in provision of a safe stable environment for the men in the prison.\"\n\nPaul Newton, previously governor at Swaleside Prison will be the new governor, there will be 30 more staff, also the prison population will drop from 1,200 to 900. The Independent Monitoring Board wrote in May 2018, \"put simply, the prison fails to provide a safe and decent environment on an almost daily basis\". Notable concerns included violence, large scale prohibited drugs, also \"regularly overcrowded and unfit living conditions\", The board noted further, \"toilets in cells with no screen, a generally dirty, poor environment, litter, objects in stairwells, broken windows, heating broken or excessive, broken showers, lack of kettles and even, on occasion, lack of kit and bedding and cockroaches ever present\". Frances Crook of the Howard League for Penal Reform, was pleased about the news but feared prisoners would probably \"be shipped out in the middle of the night\" causing \"even more overcrowding in other prisons\".\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1881337", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1881337", "title": "Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps", "text": "Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps\n\nThe Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps (NROTC) program is a college-based, commissioned officer training program of the United States Navy and the United States Marine Corps.\n\nA pilot Naval Reserve unit was established in September 1924 at St. John's College in Annapolis, Maryland. It let the Navy test the concept before establishing its regular units. In 1926, the U.S. Department of the Navy established the Naval Reserve Officer Training Corps. Its purpose was to produce a reserve of qualified officers who would be needed for a possible rapid expansion of the military in the case of an unforeseen emergency. A secondary objective was to acquaint college faculty and students with the Navy and its national importance. Sixty Naval Reserve Freshmen were accepted at each of the original units at the University of California, Berkeley, Northwestern University, University of Washington, Harvard University, Yale University, and Georgia Institute of Technology. Captain Chester W. Nimitz commanded the University of California NROTC unit. The first NROTC students received one uniform and (during their junior and senior years) a subsistence allowance totaling $210. They had the option of attending a fifteen-day training cruise each summer for which they would be paid seventy cents per day and a transportation allowance between their college and the ports of embarkation and debarkation. The St. John's College pilot unit disbanded by 1929, but the original six regular units are still active in 2014 (albeit with historical gaps at Harvard and Yale).\n\nUnder the modern U.S. Naval ROTC system, graduates become active duty officers, rather than reserve officers, and are required to serve a term of 5 years for the Navy Option and 4 years for the Marine and Nurse Options. The Naval Reserve Officer Training Corps commissions individuals into either the United States Navy as an Ensign or the United States Marine Corps as a Second Lieutenant. While attending college, these prospective officer candidates are known as Midshipmen. Whereas Naval Academy Midshipmen are on active duty, NROTC Midshipmen are in the Navy Reserve but are on active duty for periods of training during the summer. The primary difference is that NROTC Midshipmen attend an ordinary civilian college or university, whereas Naval Academy Midshipmen attend the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, MD, which is a much more regimented, military environment.\n\nStarting in 2009, the scholarship program was changed to narrowly favor STEM degrees at the expense of the humanities.\n\nThe majority of NROTC Midshipmen join the program immediately after completing high school. Those Midshipmen are either Scholarship or College Program Midshipmen.\n\nScholarship Midshipmen are those who applied to the Navy for an ROTC scholarship (during their senior year of high school, or during early college studies). Some NROTC students have served as enlisted men or women in the Navy or Marine Corps. The highly selective application process involves an extensive written application and an interview with a Navy representative. Applicants must also pass an entrance medical examination process. The Navy pays tuition for Scholarship Midshipmen, educational fees (i.e. lab fees), as well as a stipend for books. All Midshipmen fall under one of three types: Navy Option, Navy Nurse Option, or Marine Option. The Navy does not pay for room and board; however, some schools will offer scholarships to cover at least a portion of room and board. In addition to tuition, the Navy pays a monthly stipend during the school year. As of 2020, the stipend was $250 per month for first-year Midshipmen, with a $50 increase each year after that (i.e. $300/month for sophomores, and so on).\n\nCollege Program Midshipmen are those who join Naval ROTC without a scholarship. They complete all activities and requirements of scholarship midshipmen and if they continue in the program for four years will also be commissioned as Ensigns or Second Lieutenants. They will often be offered a scholarship by the Navy if they perform well academically and within the ROTC program. Because of the technical nature of the Navy, students entering college without a 4-year scholarship who are planning to major in a technical field, such as engineering, science, or math, are more competitive for the scholarships.\n\nThose enlisted in the Navy who are pursuing a commission through the Seaman to Admiral 21 (STA-21) participate in the ROTC program and are referred to as \"Officer Candidates.\" They retain their enlisted pay.\n\nEnlisted Marines participate in ROTC through the Marine Enlisted Commissioning Education Program (MECEP) and are referred to by their rank or by the name of the program, \"MECEP.\" (pronounced mee-sep) MECEP Marines do not have their school paid for by the Marine Corps and generally use the Montgomery GI Bill or the Post-9/11 GI Bill to pay for school. They continue to receive pay in accordance with their rank, however any promotions while they are attending school are considered non-competitive and will be revoked if they fail out of the commissioning program.\n\nMost college NROTC units are only a part-time commitment during a student's course of study at a university or college. There are three basic parts to a student's ROTC commitment in a typical week:\n\nOne or in some cases two days a week are set aside as uniform days, where the midshipmen spend several hours attending military training such as inspections, close-order drill practices, and training lectures (either by officers attached to the NROTC unit or guest lecturers). The training is usually in the late afternoon after most classes have ended for the day, or in early mornings before classes. It is common for Marine Option midshipmen and MECEPs to have an additional training period for Marine-specific training.\n\nUsually one to three physical training sessions are required in a week (depending on the specific NROTC unit), generally early in the morning. It is common for Marine Option midshipmen and MECEPs to have additional physical training days.\n\nIn addition to those activities, there are regularly scheduled classes in Naval Science that must be taken on top of the usual college load. The classes are in Naval history, Naval engineering and weapons, leadership and ethics, and other areas. Besides Naval Science classes, the Navy requires its Midshipmen to complete 2 semesters of calculus, 2 semesters of calculus-based physics, one semester diverse cultures, one year of English grammar and composition, and either National Security Policy or American Military Affairs. The Marine Corps only requires National Security Policy/American Military Affairs classes for its midshipmen.\n\nThere are other miscellaneous activities scheduled occasionally; some are voluntary and some are mandatory.\n\nThere are a few ROTC programs that do not follow this model, and instead require a full-time commitment from midshipmen during the school year. At a Senior Military College, the midshipmen are normally housed together with other ROTC cadets in barracks-like dormitories, a uniform is worn at least 5 days a week, and regular morning and evening formations are mandatory. At The Citadel and the Virginia Military Institute, cadets wear uniforms 7 days a week, live in a barracks, and are restricted to campus during the school week to focus on their studies and military training. Such full-time programs provide a more regimented existence that more closely simulates enlisted military life; they tend to be more demanding than normal college ROTC programs, in that they require extra commitments of time, physical and mental energy, etc. above and beyond most normal ROTC programs. Some midshipmen are drawn to these programs, which have a rich historical tradition behind them. Other students prefer standard NROTC programs, which allow them to focus more of their energy on academics rather than being limited by a regimented military life.\n\nSome notable full-time programs include the Corps of Cadets at The Citadel, Virginia Military Institute, Virginia Tech, Massachusetts Maritime Academy, Texas A&M University, Texas A&M Maritime Academy, SUNY Maritime College, Maine Maritime Academy, California Maritime Academy and Norwich University.\n\nNROTC students who are on scholarship participate in a \"summer cruise\" in the fleet, to get hands-on training with real Navy personnel and equipment. After their freshman year, Midshipmen (both Navy and Marine) travel to either San Diego or Norfolk for CORTRAMID (Career Orientation and Training of Midshipmen). The Midshipmen spend a week in each of the three primary Unrestricted Line communities (Surface, Submarine, and Aviation) as well as a week with the Marine Corps to help them decide which community to join when commissioned.\n\nIn the next two summers, Navy Option scholarship midshipmen spend time with either a surface ship, submarine, or aviation squadron. Aviation cruises are only available to Midshipmen for their First Class Cruise. For each summer cruise, they select which warfare community they would prefer to train with and are given the opportunity to train around the world. The summer cruise in between the sophomore and junior years is referred to as the second-class cruise. They are assigned an enlisted running mate, from whom they acquire a sense of the enlisted experience. The summer cruise in between the junior and senior years of college (known as the First Class Cruise) is required for commissioning, and it focuses on integrating the midshipman into the officer community. Specialty cruises include EOD cruises, SEAL cruises, FOREX cruises (midshipmen are attached to a foreign country's ship), and Navy Nurse Cruises.\n\nMarine Option Midshipmen attend the Marine Corps' Mountain Warfare Training Center for the second summer. In recent years they have been attached to Marine units undergoing the summer training package. They learn high altitude survival techniques and undergo high altitude conditioning. It is often jokingly called \"OCS prep.\" Between the junior and senior years, Marine Option midshipmen attend \"Bulldog,\" Marine Officer Candidate School for six weeks.\n\nCollege Program midshipmen must either obtain the scholarship before their junior year or receive \"advanced standing\". In either case the midshipmen will only attend the first class summer cruise or OCS for Marine Options.\n\nNROTC students are generally issued several types of uniforms, all for them to keep. The standard issue uniform is the poly/wool khaki, while Summer White and Service Dress Blue (commonly known as SDBs) are often seen on college campuses. Midshipmen wear a garrison cover with a fouled anchor for the Khakis, and a combination cover with a fouled anchor and a gold strap with the Whites and SDBs. Also newly issued to Midshipmen are the Navy's new Navy Working Uniform. Finally, Midshipmen are issued coveralls for preparation for their cruise, as well as an \"N\" ballcap and steel toed boots.\n\nThe normal, \"baseline\" service commitment for Scholarship NROTC graduates is eight years, with no less than five served on active duty. The exact commitment will depend on which warfare community a midshipman is selected for. For example, Navy and Marine pilots are generally committed to eight years after their date of winging. Because the training for a Naval Aviator is extensive, this can lead to a commitment of up to 10 years. Naval Flight Officers usually serve a six-year commitment and Submarine Officers usually serve a five-year commitment.\n\nCommitment is also based on whether a midshipman is enrolled in the scholarship or college program. Those midshipmen who are in the college program typically only owe three years of active duty service.\n\nOnce a naval officer completes their active duty commitment, they must serve the rest of their three years in some portion of the Navy Reserve.\n\n\n"}

He was one of the pioneers in the maritime industry and Israeli economy in general.\n\nBorn into a shipping family from Thessaloniki, Greece, Mordechai was the son of Samuel Mano (1880-1962), who owned and operated from Thessaloniki, a fleet of “Maunas”, self-propelled barges, which served the Greek mainland and island ports. In 1932, when Mano was 9, his family immigrated to Mandatory Palestine, as part of the big immigration waves organized by Abba Hushi, an activist and leader of the Jewish Agency, in order to strengthen the Jewish working forces at the port of Haifa.\n\nMordechai Mano received his knowledge and experience in the maritime industry from his father Samuel (1880-1962), who had worked at the shipping docks in Salonika. Samuel and his eldest brother, Morris, worked at the Haifa port till their retirement. Mano began his career as a messenger and a port clerk at the Nisim Meshulam shipping agency, and later at the shipping company Atid (which was established at 1934 by the Burhard family) where he studied all the secrets of the shipping trade. Spending days and nights working and learning every possible aspect of the business, combined with a lot of reading on the subject, Mano soon became an expert. He was known as a pioneer and as a man with vision and a special talent for getting on with people, making important business connections all around the world. One of his big advantages was a gift for languages. Mordechai spoke seven languages fluently (including Turkish and Arabic).\n\nIn 1943, he established a shipping agency in Haifa called Mordechai Mano Shipping Agents on Ha Hazmaut Street, and later moved the company offices to 53 Ha Namal Street. The agency dealt with the free zone trade ships that arrived at Haifa and later purchased its first ship, a small wooden vessel, which was used primarily for the importing of the food products from Turkey in cooperation with the shipping agency Israel Gotesman and Sons, which dealt with the trade in food products during the austerity days of the early nineteen-fifties. \n\nIn 1956, the shipping company Netivei Hayam Hatihon (Mediterranean Seaways) was established in partnership with the Ofer Brothers Group, Mano was the company's administrator and senior partner. The company purchased a number of additional ships: \"“Carmela\" and \"Malka\" (named after his daughters), \"Eyal\", \"Liora\" (named after Yuli Ofer's daughter Liora Ofer) and others. Netivei Hayam Hatihon established new routes and soon became a major carrier of cargo and freight to Israel through the Mediterranean and especially from the Adriatic. \n\nAfter the end of the Suez Crisis, an Israeli government initiative saw Mano organize an operation with the ship \"Panagaya\", in which cement was transferred from Haifa to Eilat as an experimental transition of Israeli cargo and freight. This was recognized as a big success by the government. Mano was personally honored by Golda Meir, former prime minister of Israel. \n\nIn 1965, the ownership of Nativei Hayam Hatichon was divided, and Mano established a new family company called Mano Nativei Yam. Some of the Nativei Hayam Hatichon ships were transferred to the new company with an addition of some chartered ships. The company managed those ships and also had an agency and part of an ownership in the ports of Haifa and Ashdod.\n\nBy 1967, he had already established a prominent ship owning company with a substantial presence in the Mediterranean and global shipping arena.\n\nMano died at the beginning of 1969. He left a wife, Ester Mano, two daughters, Carmela and Malka, two sons, Samuel Mano and Moshe Mano, and a grandson. His eldest son, Samuel, heads the Seagull Maritime company, Moshe is the owner of Mano Maritime, Pessah (Paul) Weissman, Mano's eldest son-in-law, manages the Hadar Maritime company, and Sami Niago, Mano’s son-in-law, manages Carmel Shipping company.\n\nDan Mano, his grandson is an Israeli public figure since starring in the first season of the TV show Survivor\n"}

He is often referred to simply as W. G. Gillies.\n\nGillies was born in Haddington, East Lothian. He had just enrolled at the Edinburgh College of Art, when he was called up for service in World War I with the Royal Engineers. After the War, he returned to the College, and after graduation taught there for over 40 years with other notable Scottish artists including Adam Bruce Thomson. He was Principal of the College from 1959 until his retirement in 1966. In 1922 along with nine fellow students, including William Crozier, William Geissler and William MacTaggart, he founded the 1922 Group, an exhibition society which promoted their works at the New Gallery in Edinburgh for the next ten years.\n\nAssisted by a travelling scholarship, Gillies studied under André Lhote in Paris in 1923 and he went on to visit Italy in 1924. For a brief period after these experiences he worked in a cubist manner, but would later revert to a more traditional style. His cubist influenced works are typified by the 1933 still life, \"Two Pots, Saucer and Fruit\". The arrangement of the objects, which are close together on a tilted table top, are influenced by Cézanne, whereas the understated colours and textures are reminiscent of Braque and Picasso.\n\nIn 1934 Gillies attended an exhibition of Paul Klee's work and was impressed by the childlike qualities and imaginative use of colour that he saw. Klee's influence is clear in Gillies' 1934 work, \"The Harbour\", which depicts the harbour at Anstruther. Gillies has created a grid-like composition, using bold blocks of contrasting colour emphasising the vertical lines of the buildings and the ships masts. This is balanced by the use of rippling horizontal brushstrokes.\n\nAlthough he experimented with portraiture in his early career, Gillies concentrated principally on landscapes and still lifes, frequently depicting the Lothian, Fife and Border regions. Several of his works feature ceramics created by his younger sister, the potter Emma Smith Gillies, who died prematurely in 1936. Both in his prolific output over the course of his career, and in his 40 years of teaching, Gillies influence on Scottish painting of the twentieth century has been profound.\n\n"}

{"id": "1881367", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1881367", "title": "Shakuntala", "text": "Shakuntala\n\nIn Hinduism, Shakuntala (Sanskrit: \"Śakuntalā\") is the wife of Dushyanta and the mother of Emperor Bharata. Her story is told in the \"Mahabharata\" and dramatized by many writers, the most famous adaption being Kalidasa's play \"Abhijñānaśākuntala\" (\"The Sign of Shakuntala\").\n\nRishi Kanva found her in forest as a baby surrounded by Shakunta birds (, \"śakunta\"). Therefore, he named her \"Shakuntala\" (), meaning \"Shakunta-protected\".\n\nIn the Adi Parva of Mahabharata, Kanva says:\n\nShe was surrounded in the solitude of the wilderness by \"śakuntas\",<br>\ntherefore, hath she been named by me Shakuntala (Shakunta-protected).\n\nKing Dushyanta first encountered Shakuntala while travelling through the forest with his army. He was pursuing a male deer wounded by his weapon. Shakuntala and Dushyanta fell in love with each other and got married as per Gandharva marriage system. Before returning to his kingdom, Dushyanta gave his personal royal ring to Shakuntala as a symbol of his promise to return and bring her to his palace.\n\nShakuntala spent much time dreaming of her new husband and was often distracted by her daydreams. One day, a powerful rishi, Durvasa, came to the ashrama but, lost in her thoughts about Dushyanta, Shakuntala failed to greet him properly. Incensed by this slight, the rishi cursed Shakuntala, saying that the person she was dreaming of would forget about her altogether. As he departed in a rage, one of Shakuntala's friends quickly explained to him the reason for her friend's distraction. The rishi, realizing that his extreme wrath was not warranted, modified his curse saying that the person who had forgotten Shakuntala would remember everything again if she showed him a personal token that had been given to her.\n\nTime passed, and Shakuntala, wondering why Dushyanta did not return for her, finally set out for the capital city with her foster father and some of her companions. On the way, they had to cross a river by a canoe ferry and, seduced by the deep blue waters of the river, Shakuntala ran her fingers through the water. Her ring (Dushyanta's ring) slipped off her finger without her realizing it.\n\nArriving at Dushyanta's court, Shakuntala was hurt and surprised when her husband did not recognize her, nor recollected anything about her. She tried to remind him that she was his wife but without the ring, Dushyanta did not recognize her. Humiliated, she returned to the forests and, collecting her son, settled in a wild part of the forest by herself. Here she spent her days while Bharata, her son, grew older. Surrounded only by wild animals, Bharata grew to be a strong youth and made a sport of opening the mouths of tigers and lions and counting their teeth.\n\nMeanwhile, a fisherman was surprised to find a royal ring in the belly of a fish he had caught. Recognizing the royal seal, he took the ring to the palace and, upon seeing his ring, Dushyanta's memories of his lovely bride came rushing back to him. He immediately set out to find her and, arriving at her father's ashram, discovered that she was no longer there. He continued deeper into the forest to find his wife and came upon a surprising scene in the forest: a young boy had pried open the mouth of a lion and was busy counting its teeth. The king greeted the boy, amazed by his boldness and strength, and asked his name. He was surprised when the boy answered that he was Bharata, the son of King Dushyanta. The boy took him to Shakuntala, and thus the family was reunited.\n\nAn alternate narrative is that after Dushyanta failed to recognize Shakuntala, her mother Menaka took Shakuntala to Heaven where she gave birth to Bharata. Dushyanta was required to fight with the devas, from which he emerged victorious; his reward was to be reunited with his wife and son. He had a vision in which he saw a young boy counting the teeth of a lion. His \"kavach\" (arm band/armour) had fallen off his arm. Dushyanta was informed by the devas that only Bharata's mother or father could tie it back on his arm. Dushyanta successfully tied it on his arm. The confused Bharata took the king to his mother Shakuntala and told her that this man claimed to be his father. Upon which Shakuntala told Bharata that the king was indeed his father. Thus the family was reunited in Heaven, and they returned to earth to rule for many years before the birth of the Pandava.\n\n\"The Recognition of Sakuntala\" is a Sanskrit play written by Kalidasa.\n\n\"Sakuntala\" is an incomplete opera by Franz Schubert, which originated late 1819 to early 1820. Italian Franco Alfano composed an opera named \"La leggenda di Sakùntala\" (\"The legend of Shakuntala\") in its first version (1921) and simply \"Sakùntala\" in its second version (1952).\n\n\nIshwar Chandra Vidyasagar created a novel in Sadhu Bhasha, Bengali. It was among the first translations from Bengali. Abanindra Nath Tagore later wrote in the Chalit Bhasa (which is a simpler literary variation of Bengali) mainly for children and preteens.\n\nBy the 18th century, Western poets were beginning to get acquainted with works of Indian literature and philosophy. The German poet Goethe read Kalidasa's play and has expressed his admiration for the work in the following verses:\n\nIn 1808 Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel published a German translation of the Shakuntala story from the \"Mahabharata\".\n\nThe earliest adaptation into a film was the Tamil movie \"Shakuntalai\" featuring M.S.Subbulakshmi in the role of Shakuntala. Bhupen Hazarika made the Assamese film \"Shakuntala\" in 1961. It won the President's Silver Medal and was critically acclaimed. Shakuntala was also made into a Malayalam movie by the same name in 1965. It starred K. R. Vijaya and Prem Nazeer as Shakuntala and Dushyanta respectively. Rajyam Pictures of C. Lakshmi Rajyam and K. Sridhar Rao produced a Shakuntala film in 1966 starring N. T. Rama Rao as Dushyanta and B. Saroja Devi as Shakuntala. It is directed by Kamalakara Kameswara Rao. V. Shantaram also made a Hindi film titled 'STREE' on this story. On the Marathi stage there was a musical drama titled \"Shakuntal\" on the same story.\n\nCamille Claudel created a sculpture \"Shakuntala\".\n\n"}
{"id": "1881374", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1881374", "title": "L.A. Boyz", "text": "L.A. Boyz\n\nL.A. Boyz was a Taiwanese pop/rap group composed of brothers Jeff Huang (黃立成, Huang Licheng) and Stanley Huang (黃立行, Huang Lixing), and their cousin Steven Lin (林智文) formed circa 1991. They are considered to be the first rap group in Taiwanese popular music. They released 13 albums (including 3 compilation albums) starting from their first \"SHIAM! 閃\" in 1992.\n\nThe trio were brought up in Irvine, California and met at its University High School. They first became involved in music through their interest in hip-hop dance moves learnt from parties around Orange County and Los Angeles, and fashion from Compton and South-Central LA. Their dancing, and entry into various competitions, eventually led them to be scouted by a representative of Pony Canyon Records, Taiwan.\n\nL.A. Boyz received their \"big break ... with the demise of the Little Tigers, a cutesy group that ruled the Taiwan pop scene until one of their members got drafted.\" Their distinct sound and use of American slang propelled them to quick success, selling more than 130,000 copies of their first record Shiam. Their second album, released in the same year, was similarly received.\n\nThe L.A. Boyz style was a combination of the \"youthful, innocent\" look prevalent in Taiwanese pop at the time and a \"great stage gimmick\" in their dancing. They were perceived as an appealing hybrid of American and Taiwanese backgrounds. As Steven Lin noted in an interview with the LA Times in 1993, the perception Taiwanese youth had of Los Angeles as a symbol of modern America led them to choose their name (though only one of their members was from the city itself). Their music videos depict their unique style of synchronized breakdancing in clubs and concert halls and various urban environments. Shots of Kung-fu, Chinese New Year Dragons and baseball also feature.\n\nLA Boyz' music was influenced by a wide variety of pop and dance music. In their songs they make prominent references to new jack swing and Bobby Brown as well as techno and rap. A good example of their musical diversity is the song \"Ya!\", which features sampled breakbeats and vocals stings (such as \"yeah, uh-huh\", \"give me a big beat!\", \"drop the mid-range, drop the bass\"). It features transitions in tempo, a semitone key modulation, a Glissando synthesizer line, and a Hip-Hop section. Their song \"I Like It\" is a reinterpretation of the disco band KC and the Sunshine Band song \"That's the Way (I Like It)\" in a hip hop style. Despite being known for their rapping, \"two-thirds of their music is actually a mixture of fast-paced dance-pop and slower, romantic R&B numbers.\" Their lyrical content include finance, their own rapping and dancing skills, American recording artists and genres (as mentioned above), American cartoons (e.g. The Hulk) and romantic love. Their lyrics reference and reflect to their hybrid nationality, an example from their song \"Jump\" – which was an eerily similar clone to Kriss Kross's hit song \"Jump\", imitating their beats, rhythms and melodies. LA Boyz' song had a first verse – \"Jerry's gonna make his rap funky in Chinese/ First you gotta start off with the ABCs (American-born Chinese) / Then you gotta learn it like the Taiwanese\" – is followed closely by a reference to the American pop cultural icon Superman. They also tone down the violent themes and difficult-to-understand slang in the lyrics for it to suit a Chinese-speaking audience. They also sought to identify their local Taiwanese audience (despite having audience in Korea, Japan and Mainland China) by speaking with a strong Taiwanese accent and re-releasing some songs in Hokkien.\n\nThe band's members all worked in film and production of other Taiwanese artists' albums. Despite their success garnering recognition in Singapore's Billboard Awards Best Performance Group category, Hong Kong Billboard Awards Best New Artist category and at Taiwan's own Golden Melody Awards the group eventually split. Jeff Huang returned to the United States and started an internet company that later merged with a Japanese software company in a 60 million dollar deal before once again returning to Taiwan and fronting hip-hop group Machi; brother Stanley went on to establish a successful solo career, winning Best Mandarin Male Singer in the 2005 Golden Melody Awards; and Lin currently works as an orthopedic surgeon in California while still participating in music and film.\n\n\"Jeffrey Huang\"\nMachi Website\n\n\"Stanley Huang\"\n\n\"Steven Lin\"\nSteven Lin Artist Webpage\nSteven Lin blog\n\nLabel: Pony Canyon Records (Taiwan)\nProducer: \nTrack Listing:\n1.閃 Go Posse\n2.愛我好嗎 Won't You Be My Girl? \n3.別客氣 Don't Say You're ⽍歹勢 (Taiwanese) \n4.來電吧 Dial My Number\n5.怎可能 Unbelievable\n6.好兄弟 Buddy Buddy \n7.緣投困仔 Lover's Boy (Taiwanese) \n8.飛越地平線 Drive & Fly\n9.夜魔 Devil's Candy\n10.夏天 Summer Vacation\n\nLabel: Pony Canyon Records (Taiwan)\nProducer: \nTrack Listing:\n1.跳 Jump\n2.季節的歌 Merry Christmas\n3.東方不賴 Oriental Mystery\n4.愛難纏 Love Is A Weird Thing \n5.神魂顛倒 Head Over Heels \n6.心碎洛城 LA Heartbreak \n7.落雨的晚上 Raining Night\n8.城市之間 Between Two Cities \n9.妳說妳會想我 Say You Gonna Miss Me \n10.最後一⽀支慢舞 The Last Dance \n11.閃(Remix) Go Posse (Remix)\n\nLabel: Pony Canyon Records (Taiwan)\nProducer: \nTrack Listing:\n1.Baseball,O-Lay!!

{"id": "1881377", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1881377", "title": "Varhaug", "text": "Varhaug\n\nVarhaug is the administrative centre of Hå municipality in Rogaland county, Norway. The village is located in the district of Jæren and it is the second largest village in Hå municipality after Nærbø. It was also the administrative centre for the former municipality of Varhaug from 1894 until its dissolution in 1964.\n\nThe village was founded in the late 19th century and expanded during the 20th century around the local railway station: Varhaug Station. Varhaug lies approximately from the North Sea coastline. The village of Varhaug lies between the two neighbouring villages of Nærbø and Vigrestad, and the people live in a \"love-hate relationship\" with these villages. There are no one that are more important to beat in a football match.\n\nThe official demonym for a person coming from the village is Varhaugsbu. An unofficial but friendly nickname for people from Varhaug is Trausk (pl: Trausker). Trausk is a word from Jæren, meaning Frog or Toad. The nickname is decades old, and all local villages had one, though Varhaug's nickname is one of the few still somewhat in use. Other words describing a person from Varhaug can be Håbu or Jærbu.\n\nWith an elevation between , Varhaug is the highest elevated village in the municipality.\n\nThe future development of Varhaug is uncertain. Agricultural land protection is a hot topic in the local newspapers since the farm land is so important to the nations food supply. The future policy of the Norwegian Government will decide how much the villages of Jæren are allowed to expand in the future. Maybe high-rise buildings are the answer, maybe Norway decides to rely more on foreign food production or perhaps there will be new villages established east of the prime agricultural land.\n\nBefore Varhaug Station was opened in 1878 as a part of the Jæren Line, there was basically only farms in the area. When the train station was built, a lot of services were located near the station, and people started settling down around the station.\n\nThe name of the village is derived from a farm with the same name, located closer to the sea. It is uncertain why this name was chosen for the train station, but the farms close to the sea have traditionally been wealthy and important in Jæren. Varhaug is a word with two elements, the latter \"haug\" is from the Old Norse word \"Haugr\" and refers in this case to a tumulus. The first \"Var\" is believed to be Old Norse meaning \"stone made\".\n\nVarhaug became the approved name for the village in 1958 by the Norwegian Mapping and Cadastre Authority, though it had been in use long before this.\n\nThe village has a population (2015) of 3,114 which gives the village a population density of . The population has been more or less steadily growing ever since Varhaug Station was opened in 1878. Statistics Norway publish population numbers for every large village but only provides detailed information at the municipality level. Hå municipality has always ranked high on fertility rate compared to the Norwegian average. There is no demographic or geographic factors that indicates that the numbers for the municipality is not representative for the village. In 2008, about two-thirds of the population increase in Hå municipality was from new settlers, the rest was from population growth within. Due to the heavy population increase in Nærbø, it's believed that this number is a bit lower in Varhaug. Still there has been a significant number of asylum seekers, foreign workers and Norwegians from other municipalities settling down in the village.\n\nThe village is located middle of Jæren, which is one of the mildest areas in Norway. This and the flat landscape makes it very suitable for agriculture, compared to other parts of Norway. The flat landscape however makes it pretty windy sometimes. There are normally only a few weeks every year when there is snow. Precipitation is typically about per year and the average temperature is . Temperatures have tended to be higher in more recent years.\nTraditionally, agriculture has been the backbone of the villages economy. But as the village has grown, it gradually becomes less important. Agriculture is still important for all the farms around the village, and the farmers are still being important customers for the shops in the village. The Jæren region has traditionally been and still is well known for the good and hard working craftsmen.\n\nThe biggest employer in Hå municipality is the municipality itself. Most of these workplaces are spread around in the municipality, but the administration is located in this village, meaning it is one of the most important workplaces in Varhaug. Another big employer in Varhaug is Fjordkjøkken AS, a company specializing in producing prefabricated dinner meals for the Norwegian brand Fjordland.\n\nMany people from the village has jobs in the larger nearby cities of Stavanger, Sandnes, and Bryne. However, Hå municipality is trying to create more jobs locally, such as the food industry park in Kviamarka.\n\nThe Sørlandet Line, traditionally the Jæren Line, runs through the village, with the Jæren Commuter Rail serving Varhaug Station. Because of the hourly train service, there are not other scheduled bus services than school buses. County Road 44 is the main road along the coast between Stavanger and Egersund. County Road 504 connects Varhaug and County Road 44 to the European route E39 highway.\n\nVarhaug has one elementary school, Varhaug School, and one lower secondary school, Varhaug Lower Secondary School. There are no upper secondary schools in Varhaug. Varhaug skule was opened in 1958 and combined the school houses of Auestad, Lerbrekk, Odland, Ualand and Ånestad. Varhaug ungdomsskule was constructed in the mid-1980s. Before this the youth had traveled to Vigrestad to go to lower secondary school.\n\nMost competitive sports are arranged through Varhaug Idrettslag.\n\n\"Varhaugbuen\" is a local printed magazine coming out four times a year. The magazine have articles about local history, upcoming or recent happenings or about people from the village. Varhaugbuen is distributed freely to all households in Varhaug, but is also available for free online at varhaugbuen.no.\n\n\n"}

It is also a ward within the formal district of Perry Barr as well as other areas such as Great Barr, Sandwell and Hamstead/Hamstead Village.\n\nHandsworth Wood is regarded as the premier residential area in North West Birmingham, due to the significantly large number of Victorian and imposing detached houses and semi-detached homes. Also the area is highly sought after due to the access to parks such as Handsworth Park, golf clubs and the open spaces of Sandwell Valley Country Park. \n\nHandsworth Wood is regarded by estate agents as upmarket in comparison to the neighbouring district of Handsworth.\n\nHandsworth Wood was the woodland belonging to the manor of Handsworth and lay in the north of the manor. It is the 'woodland half a league long & the same wide' which is cited in the Domesday Book in 1086. \n\nBy the end of the 19th century there was only scattered building development in this rural area, some of it very large houses for the wealthy. Beyond Friary Road/ Handsworth Wood Road was still farmland. It was between the two World Wars and up to the 1950s that Handsworth Wood was developed largely with private housing. It is an area that has maintained its middle-class status to the present.\n\nThe area had its own Railway station until 1941 known as Handsworth Wood railway station. The station site lies in a cutting through Handsworth Park, adjacent to St. Mary's Church.\n\nBirmingham historian Dr. Carl Chinn noted that during World War II the boundary between Handsworth and Handsworth Wood marked the line between being safe and unsafe from bombing, with Handsworth Wood being an official evacuation zone due to its very country like, undeveloped landscape. Due to the affluent residents of the area properties are larger than usual sizes meaning Handsworth Wood was ideal for evacuees etc.\n\nMr Hudson, the singer/songwriter, was born in Handsworth Wood.\n\nJames Watt, the engineer/inventor, lived in Handsworth Wood.\n\nMatthew Boulton also worked alongside James Watt, was born and raised in the area.\n\nThe primary schools in the area include Cherry Orchard Primary School, St Teresa's Catholic Primary School and Grestone Primary School.\n\nThe secondary schools in the area include Hamstead Hall Academy and Handsworth Wood Girls' Academy.\n\nIt is home to 'Hamstead Campus' a privately owned student accommodation.\n\nNearby to Handsworth Wood are the Grammar Schools of King Edward VI Handsworth Girl's Grammar School and Handsworth Grammar School, Soho Road,\n\nHandsworth Wood is home to numerous sports facilities. Handsworth Wood Bowling Club is located on Devonshire Road. The Bridge Trust Cricket Club is on Romilly Avenue. Hamstead Diamonds Tennis Club is located on Craythorne Road. The highly regarded Handsworth Golf Club is also located here with the entrance on Sunningdale Close (off Craythorne Road).\n\nLocal amenities include: St. Mary's Church, Handsworth and Handsworth Park. The Anchorage is a grade II* listed building,\n\nThe area is well served by Bus routes 16, 11C and the 101. The nearest railway station is Hamstead railway station.\n\nThere is a Birmingham City electoral ward called Handsworth Wood comprising part of Handsworth and nearly all of Handsworth Wood made up of distinct cultures and built environments – the salubrious Victorian suburb, consisting of some of the finest Victorian houses in the city, increasingly being refurbished to complement the £9 million restoration of Handsworth Park, and Handsworth Wood dominated by characteristically suburban pre-war semi-detached and detached properties. The ward was formerly known as Sandwell Ward.\n\nThe ward is represented by three Labour councillors in the Birmingham City Council; Gurdial Singh Atwal, Paulette Hamilton and Narinder Kooner.\n\nThe 2001 Population Census recorded that 25,276 people were living in the ward. It has a high percentage of ethnic minorities in the area with the figure being 67.1% (16,975) of the population being of an ethnic minority, mainly of British Indian heritage, as opposed to 29.6% for Birmingham in general.\n\nA large majority of the Handsworth Wood area consists of ethnic minorities with over 50% of residents coming from British Indian.\n\n\n"}

The album was released in 1997 through Outpost Records.\n\nThe band recorded its debut album in October and November 1996 at Woodland Studios in Nashville, Tennessee. Drummer Matt Taul was called away from the studio during the sessions for the birth of his daughter, so session drummer Adam Turgeon filled in on some tracks.\n\nTravis Meeks named Dead Can Dance as an inspiration while working on the album.\n\nThe last song on the album, \"Cling\" is actually a home demo that Meeks recorded on a four-track machine. The entire album is acoustic, with emphasis on guitar, and features dark melodies such as \"Face of the Earth\" and \"Freak\" as well as more upbeat songs like \"The Down Town\" and \"Where I Stand.\"\n\n\"Days of the New\" was a success, selling 1.5 million copies worldwide. Three songs from the album were hits: \"Touch, Peel and Stand,\" \"The Down Town,\" and \"Shelf in the Room.\" \"Touch, Peel and Stand\" was number one on Billboard's Rock Chart for 17 weeks; \"The Down Town\" and \"Shelf in the Room\" were each top 40 hits. Music videos produced for the three singles also found rotation.\n\nShortly after releasing the album, the band went on tour with Metallica and Jerry Cantrell in 1998. Internal problems became publicly evident, however, and soon after concluding the tour, the band split up. Todd Whitener, Matt Taul and Jesse Vest would go on to form Tantric while Meeks formed a new band under the Days of the New name.\n\nReviewing for \"The Village Voice\" in December 1997, Robert Christgau was unenthusiastic about the album: \"As marketing, pure genius. Looks like alt-country, no electric guitars even, yet is actually America's answer to Silverchair. And hey, it's sincere—17-year-old heartland frontman Travis Meeks really is depressed, really has immersed in Soundgarden, really does think it's deep to hook your single to the all-purpose trope 'abuse.' This is why grownups need Hanson. It's also why they need Radish.\"\n\n\n\nAdapted credits from the \"Days of the New\" booklet. Drum credits as per Meeks' official biography.\n\n\n\n\nOn December 1, 1998, Outpost released \"Days of the New: Live\", a VHS featuring concert footage and two music videos. The video includes numerous songs that would be released on future Days of the New albums.\n\n"}

Tinsley played his collegiate career at Iowa State University. Following his senior year he was drafted by the Vancouver Grizzlies with the 27th pick of the 2001 NBA draft, and was immediately dealt to the Atlanta Hawks, and then to the Indiana Pacers on draft night. Tinsley played 11 seasons in the NBA, primarily with the Pacers, as well as the Grizzlies and Jazz.\n\nAs a teen, Tinsley developed his game playing streetball at New York City's Rucker Park. Tinsley's streetball nickname is \"Mel The Abuser\". He played junior college ball at Mt. San Jacinto Community College (MSJC) before breaking onto the national scene at Big 12 Iowa State University.\n\nIn Tinsley's junior year at Iowa State, he received Big 12 Conference Player of the Year honors. He led Iowa State to a No. 2 seed in the NCAA Tournament. The team, along with fellow star Marcus Fizer, reached the Elite Eight before losing to eventual champion Michigan State. In his senior year Tinsley earned First Team All-American honors.\n\nTinsley established himself as the starting point guard under Pacers coach Isiah Thomas. He put up statistics of 9.4 points and 8.1 assists per game in 2001–02. On November 16, 2001, he recorded the 9th five-by-five in NBA history since the 1985–86 season. At 23 years and 261 days, he was the youngest to do so until Andrei Kirilenko in 2003.\n\nTinsley played 73 games for the Pacers in 2002–03, starting 69 of them, and his averages dipped to 7.8 points and 7.5 assists per contest.\n\nThe following year, Rick Carlisle replaced Thomas as the Pacers' head coach, and promoted veteran guard Kenny Anderson to the starting point guard slot, with Anthony Johnson as his backup.\n\nWhen Anderson and Johnson went down with injuries, Tinsley regained his status as a starter. As the Pacers advanced to the 2004 Eastern Conference Finals, Tinsley started all 16 playoff games.\n\nTinsley spent the majority of the 2004–05 season on injured reserve due to a bruised left foot, but the team played its way to a 44–38 record and the sixth seed in the Eastern Conference. Tinsley missed the first four games of the Pacers' first-round series against the Boston Celtics, but made a return in a Game 5 victory. In that game on May 3, 2005, Tinsley made 7 assists, 5 steals, and 6 points, and the 5 steals tied the most among all players during the 2005 postseason and his personal high for the playoffs. Tinsley's injury problems continued during the 2007–08 season; he only played in 39 games, during which he averaged a career-high 8.4 assists.\n\nFor the 2008–09 season, Tinsley was replaced in the starting lineup by point guard T. J. Ford. O'Brien and Pacers' President of Basketball Operations Larry Bird told Tinsley he would not play for the Pacers again and would be traded as soon as possible, then shipped his personal items to Tinsley's home in Atlanta. Tinsley then requested a contract buyout through his agent. Because of the situation where Indiana's insistence on trading and not outright waiving Tinsley meant that no other team offered Indiana anything of value to acquire him (knowing that the Pacers would eventually have to part ways with Tinsley and then he could be picked up at no cost), the NBA Players Association filed a grievance against the Pacers on Tinsley's behalf on February 11, 2009. On July 22, 2009, the Pacers waived Tinsley.\n\nOn November 14, 2009, the Memphis Grizzlies signed Tinsley as a free agent.

Tinsley played eight games with the D-Fenders and averaged 9.9 points, 3.1 rebounds, and 7.6 assists per game.\n\nOn December 12, 2011, Tinsley was signed by the Utah Jazz, along with Keith McLeod, and Trey Gilder.\n\nOn June 29, 2012, the Jazz exercised the team option on Tinsley's contract to keep him under contract for one more season.\n\nOn October 26, 2013, he re-signed with the Jazz.

She is a classically trained musician and a professional singer/songwriter. She was born in Stirling in 1944, and raised on a croft in Argyll from the age of five.\n\nGillies' musical upbringing was wide-ranging. Her maternal grandparents were professional classical violinists, and Gillies learned piano from an early age. While a pupil at Oban High School she was inspired by many of her teachers, especially her English teacher, the poet Iain Crichton Smith, and John Maclean, the Rector (Headmaster) of the school, a native of the Island of Raasay, classical scholar and brother of poet Sorley Maclean, from whom she learned a large number of Gaelic songs and to whom she dedicated her seminal book \"Songs of Gaelic Scotland\" (Birlinn, Edinburgh, 2005).\n\nIn her teens, Gillies sang, danced and played at cèilidhs, concerts and Mòds, and even introduced a touch of Gaelic culture to BBC Radio Scotland's Children's Hour. She also took advantage of the wide variety of amateur musical and theatrical productions which Oban offered, from school-based folk-group, baroque ensemble, debating society and drama productions to local bands, Gilbert and Sullivan productions and public speaking.\n\nIn 1962, three months after leaving Oban High School, she won the coveted Women's Gold Medal for singing at the Royal National Mòd an honour which brought with it a raft of opportunities to perform in concerts, tours, folk-clubs and festivals on both sides of the Border.\n\nHighlights from this early period of Gillies' career include singing at large-scale Gaelic concerts on the official programme of the Edinburgh International Festival (Usher Hall, Leith Town Hall); appearing in the first of many live Hogmanay shows (1964) to an audience of over 20 million people; taking part in an iconic televised folk concert in Glasgow's Kelvin Hall, organised by poet/folklorist Hamish Henderson, singing alongside legendary Scots and Irish traditional performers such as Jeannie Robertson and The Chieftains. Following this appearance Gillies struck up an unlikely but fruitful musical partnership with Jimmy MacBeath, an itinerant worker and singer of Bothy Ballads from the north east of Scotland. During these early years Gillies also gave regular radio recitals of a capella Gaelic song on BBC Scotland, and sang on the early BBC Gaelic black-and-white television series \"Songs all the Way\".\n\nIn 1965 Gillies graduated MA (Celtic and English) from the University of Edinburgh, and went on to complete a post-graduate year as research student/transcriber in the School of Scottish Studies, at a time when the collection of Scotland's precious heritage of Gaelic song was at its peak. Then, in 1966, she left Scotland to pursue classical vocal training in Italy and London. She spent the next five years completing her apprenticeship both as a singer, under the tutelage of German Lieder experts Helene Isepp, Ilse Wolf and Paul Hamburger, and also (to \"have something to fall back on\") as a secondary school teacher of English, History and Music. Having acquired a Postgraduate Certificate in Education from the University of London (PGCE), she went on to teach in a huge, progressive, arts-orientated comprehensive school in Bicester, Oxfordshire, famed for the size and quality of its Music Department: its impressive end-of-term productions involved the whole community and included Wagner's \"Die Meistersinger\" and Verdi's \"Nabucco\" (with Gillies in the rôle of Abigail). It was with very mixed feelings that she resigned her post to concentrate on her professional career.\n\nGillies returned to Scotland in 1971, and has been based there ever since, though her career has taken her to many corners of the world, singing in:\n\n\nHer media “break” came as resident singer on \"Mainly Magnus\" (1971–72) – a 26-week live Saturday night TV chat-show (BBC Scotland) hosted by Magnus Magnusson. Other BBC Scotland TV programmes followed, including the much-loved Gaelic musical series \"'S e ur beatha\" BBC Scotland, on which Gillies sang and introduced traditional performers including Aly Bain, Tom Anderson and Na h-Òganaich.\n\nIn 1973, shortly after the birth of her first child, she starred in a one-off eponymous 50-minute \"special\" programme (BBC2 UK network) with guest star Stefan Grapelli. Showcasing Gillies' wide musical repertoire and also featuring her talent as a storyteller and illustrator, this show gained her the rather ironic title of \"Best TV Newcomer of the Year\", as voted for by readers of the \"Daily Record\" for TRICS, the Television and Radio Industries Club of Scotland. (Even more ironically she was invited back the following year to present the same award to Billy Connolly.)\n\nThe following, though not exhaustive, summary gives an indication of the scope and variety of Anne's television career during this \"high noon\" of her television career, and why Terry Wogan – in Birmingham during his \"Come Dancing\" days – greeted her with the words:“I know who you are. You’re the girl that does more television than all the rest of us put together.”\n\n• \"Anne Lorne Gillies\": another 50-minute “one-off music special” (network/UK: BBC2, for legendary producer Yvonne Littlewood) was followed by a series of six programmes with the same format in which Gillies presented and sang with a stunning array of international guests including the Swingle Singers, The Kings Singers, the Chieftains, Fairport Convention, Scottish Ballet, Juan Martine, Niels-Henning Ørsted Pedersen.\n\n• \"There was a Girl\": a series created for BBC Scotland by the Laurence Olivier Award-winning English dancer Gillian Lynne (choreographer of \"Cats\", \"Phantom of the Opera\", etc. who was created a Dame in 2014). In each programme Anne told a separate love story through music and dance with the help of a troupe of male Broadway dancers, and each featured a male star of film and stage: George Chakiris (American Academy Award-winning actor/dancer, best known for creating the rôle of Bernardo Nuñez, leader of the Sharks, in the Hollywood smash-hit musical \"West Side Story\"), David Hemmings (star of Michaelangelo's Antonioni's enigmatic English film \"Blow-up\"), French actor / dancer Jean-Pierre Cassel (\"Murder on the Orient Express\", \"Oh! What a Lovely War\", \"Prêt-à-Porter\") and Barry Ingham, star of the Royal Shakespeare Company and musicals on Broadway and London's West End (\"Gypsy\", \"Camelot\", \"Aspects of Love\")\n\n• \"Something to Sing About\" (BBC2 UK/network) six 50-minute Light Entertainment programmes co-starring legendary Scottish comedian Chick Murray, actors Patrick Malahide and Jan Wilson, and Scots baritone Peter Morrison.\n\n• \"The Castles of Mar\" (BBC Scotland) location OB series filmed in Royal Deeside from some of the National Trust for Scotland's most iconic castles. Anne sang Scots songs, mainly from the North-East tradition, and introduced some of Scotland's most enduring entertainers, including Andy Stewart, Isla St Clair, Fulton MacKay, Russell Hunter and Iain Cuthbertson\n\n• Many one-off TV shows, including \"Rhythm on Two\" (contrasting the styles of Gillies and Barbara Dickson, BBC2 UK); \"Anna agus Clannad\" (BBC Scotland) – highlighting stylistic similarities and distinctions between the Scots and Irish Gaelic traditions; \"The Puffer’s Progress\": an hour-long film (BBC1 network/UK) shot on location on board a Clyde ‘puffer’ as she steamed slowly along the Crinan Canal, and showcasing Gillies' own original songs – including her “signature song” “The Hills of Lorne”; \"My kind of music\" (BBC1 network/UK) also showcasing Gillies' own songs, including “After the Pantomime”: with special guest star, Alan Price.\n\n• Numerous guest appearances on popular BBC TV series such as \"Castles in the Air\", \"Songs of Scotland\", \"The Max Boyce Show\" and \"Talla a’ Bhaile\"; on, Independent channels, Thingummyjig, \"Sir Harry Secombe’s Highway\"; and of course the live Hogmanay shows (BBC and ITV network/UK) in which Gillies starred regularly, over the years, alongside Scottish stars such as Kenneth MacKellar, Iain Cuthbertson, Alastair MacDonald, Peter Morrison and Annie Ross.\n\n• Children's programmes: Gillies' brief but enjoyable stint as Scottish anchorperson on the \"Multi-coloured Swap Shop \"(presented by Noel Edmonds and Keith Chegwyn) was interrupted by the birth of her third child. Thereafter she was involved in several Gaelic children's series, including \"Bzzz\" which featured twelve original Gaelic pop-songs co-written by Anne and pianist David Pringle.\n\nFrom the late 1980s onwards Gillies increasingly worked as presenter / interviewer of adult programmes, especially those in, or relating to, the Gaelic language: she fronted three series of \"About Gaelic\" (Scottish Television's popular and informative chat-show – an \"introduction to Gaelic culture for non-Gaelic speakers\") and \"Barail nam Boireannach\" – two challenging hour-long Gaelic language versions of Scottish Television's current affairs series \"100 Scottish Women\". She was also a guest presenter on BBC's \"Saturday Night at the Mill\" (where she interviewed, among others, Tippi Hedren, star of Alfred Hitchcock's film \"The Birds\") and, in the 1990s, completed a terrifying 5-day stint chairing Channel Four's live daytime current affairs programme \"Powerhouse\".\n\nMore recently, with the growth of Gaelic-medium television programming, her innumerable appearances have included\n\n\nThroughout her career Gillies has espoused many causes, charitable, cultural and political: she has given her services freely to raise funds and public awareness for many organisations – medical, social, artistic, political – especially those connected to children and Scottish Gaelic culture. In 1983 she was invited to take on the role of Patron of Comhairle nan Sgoiltean Àraich (the Gaelic Voluntary Playgroup Association) and then became a key player in a no-holds barred nationwide campaign to persuade the authorities to recognise the importance of the Gaelic language both within Scotland and at international level: the urgent need to reverse the decline of Gaelic as a spoken language and to protect and develop its rich heritage through its development as a medium of communication on radio and television and, especially, in mainstream education.\n\nIn between raising her own three children she worked tirelessly in support of Gaelic voluntary organisations, raising funds and public awareness, organising events, committees and parental groups, and using her contacts and expertise to persuade all political parties, as well as the educational establishment, to acknowledge the viability and value of Gaelic in the modern world – specifically as a medium of education at every level of education, both formal and in the community. In 1983 she was commissioned by Sabhal Mòr Ostaig (the Gaelic College in Skye) to conduct a large-scale study into “popular attitudes towards Gaelic and its relevance to 20th century Scotland”. Her report led directly to her return to University: first as a full-time post-graduate student in the University of Strathclyde, where she.gained an Additional Qualification as a primary teacher which enabled her fully to support the newly established Gaelic-medium units on both a voluntary and a professional basis. She also attended the University of Glasgow for a part-time Masters’ course in Multicultural Education, which was commuted after one year to a part-time PhD.: Fraser, Anne (1989) “Gaelic in primary education: a study of the development of Gaelic bilingual education in urban contexts”. PhD thesis, University of Glasgow.\n\nShe completed this in record time while simultaneously holding down the post of National Education Development Officer with Comann na Gàidhlig (CnaG), the principal Government-funded language development agency at the time. Gillies' remit with CnaG was the promotion of Gaelic as a medium of education at all levels, from preschool to tertiary; to inform parents, educators, the media, government officials and politicians of all parties of the historical importance of Gaelic to Scotland and the world, and to facilitate its usage in the modern context and continuance for future generations. The work of Anne and her colleagues throughout the Gaelic-speaking community led to a sea-change in the fortunes of the language, with unprecedented levels of official support, its burgeoning usage within the Scottish education system and media, and – vitally – its endorsement and encouragement among native Gaelic-speakers and learners at grassroots level. Massively heartening developments which could not have been predicted when Gillies' own children were growing up.\n\nIn 1991 Gillies was appointed by Govan Initiative Ltd to develop an arts strategy for the enrichment of a disparate and often dispirited area that had suffered from acute social and economic problems since the decline of the shipbuilding industry. She devised a wide array of arts activities designed to address problems of unemployment, homelessness, addiction, disability, and fear of crime. Among these was the Greater Govan Youth Theatre, a network of groups designed to develop skills and overcome social, sectarian and territorial dichotomies. Conscious of the historical presence of a substantial Gaelic-speaking population in Govan, Gillies devised and produced \"Tuathcheòl\" – a televised Gaelic country music series from Glasgow's Grand Old Opry on Govan Road that became popular with audiences throughout Scotland and Ireland.\n\nIn 1996 she was appointed Gaelic Lecturer in the Faculty of Education of the University of Strathclyde.\n\nGillies has served voluntarily on numerous committees and working-parties, including the Scottish Arts Council Music Committee, The Gaelic Books Council and the Curriculum for Excellence Consultative Group on Gaelic.\n\nIn 1990s she became publicly and actively involved in the Scottish National Party (SNP), an organisation with which her family had had ties, both direct and indirect, for many decades (see William Gillies). In 1996 she was elected to the SNP's National Council and National Executive Committee, appointed Cabinet Spokesperson on the Arts, Culture and Gaelic, and then stood as SNP candidate for the Western Isles constituency at the 1997 general election and put her public profile to use throughout Scotland in promoting Devolution.\n\nIn September 1998 she was selected as a candidate for the 1999 European Parliament elections following year by delegates at the SNP's conference.\n\nHer extensive published works include autobiography \"Song of Myself\" (Mainstream, 1992), short stories written under her married name Anne Bree (Polygon, 2000, 2001); Gaelic children's fiction and poetry under her Gaelic name Anna Latharna NicGillìosa (Acair, Brìgh, Stòrlann) and her seminal collection \"Songs of Gaelic Scotland\" (Birlinn) now in its 3rd edition. Published in 2005, \"Songs of Gaelic Scotland\" won the prestigious academic Ratcliff Prize for \"an important contribution by an individual to the study of Folk and Folklore in Great Britain and Ireland\".\n\nShe has also worked as writer / producer of Gaelic programmes at Scottish television, notably on \"Speaking our Language\" – Scottish Television's flagship multimedia adult learning series – and \"Caraidean\", Channel Four's preschool Gaelic learning Series. She also co-wrote \"Reoiteag air Rothan\" / \"The Ice-cream Factory\" for Channel 5.\n\nGillies was elected by the membership of the Association of Speakers’ Clubs of Great Britain as their Speaker of the Year, 2005.\n\nOther awards and honours have included an Honorary Doctorate from the University of Edinburgh; Fellowships from the University of the Highlands and Islands, the Royal Incorporation of Architects in Scotland, and the Association for Scottish Literary Studies; and her appointment in 2009 as Tosgair na Gàidhlig (Gaelic Ambassador) by the Scottish Government.\n\nHer voluntary and charitable work has been recognised by the award of Rotary International's Paul Harris Fellowship.\n\nAnne was inducted into the Scottish Traditional Music Hall of Fame in 2012.\n\nShe left Strathclyde University in 2000, to work freelance again, specifically to address the urgent need for resources (print, electronic etc.) in Gaelic-medium classrooms. She moved to Ayrshire and, along with her husband, Kevin Bree, set up an independent Gaelic multimedia partnership (Brìgh) producing Gaelic books and talking books, television and radio programmes, music CDs, CD-ROMs (educational games and teachers’ packs etc.) She continues to sing, teach and lead master-classes and workshops on Gaelic music on both sides of the Atlantic and appears fairly frequently as a singer / interviewee on BBC Alba and BBC Radio nan Gàidheal.\n\nShe is currently writing a historical novel set in 17th century Scotland, Ireland and France.\n\nAnne Lorne Gillies is married to Kevin Bree. She has three children by her previous marriage to Neil Fraser: Robbie, Marsaili and Rachel. Between them Anne and Kevin have 13 (step)grandchildren. Anne's brother is Prof. William Gillies.\n\n"}

It is currently located in a three-storey building at 20 Ringsend Road in Dublin, Ireland. Originally opened in 1978 by recording engineer Brian Masterson on 22 Windmill Lane and subsequently relocated to its current location at 20 Ringsend Road, Dublin 4, where it still operates as one of Ireland's largest recording studios.\n\nOver the course of its history, it has been used by many notable artists. The original site of the Windmill Lane Studios remained a popular cult symbol for music fans due to the studio's links with the Irish rock group U2; the group's albums to have been fully or partially recorded there include \"Boy\", \"October\", \"War\", \"The Joshua Tree\", \"Pop\", \"All That You Can't Leave Behind\", and \"Zooropa.\"\n\nWindmill Lane Recording Studios was originally opened by recording engineer, Brian Masterson in 1978, and was first located in the Dublin Docklands on Windmill Lane, just off Sir John Rogerson's Quay. It was originally used to record traditional Irish music, notably by Planxty.\n\nHowever, no Irish rock band recorded in the studios until U2. The drums on \"Boy\" were recorded in the reception area of the recording studios, due to producer Steve Lillywhite's desire to achieve \"this wonderful clattery sound\". They had to wait until the receptionist went home in the evenings as the phone rang through the day and even occasionally in the evening.\n\nAfter U2 based themselves at the studios, Van Morrison, Sinéad O'Connor, and Elvis Costello recorded at the studios. Clannad's hit \"Theme from Harry's Game\" was recorded at the studios; this song propelled the band and their singer Moya Brennan into international territories. Status Quo recorded two albums here in 1980, during a tax year away from the UK: \"Just Supposin'\" and \"Never Too Late\", released in 1981.\n\nIn contrast, other bands, such as Thin Lizzy or The Boomtown Rats, went to London or further afield to record their albums.\n\nThe studios were expanded in the 1980s under the supervision of Andy Munro of Munro Acoustics. Much of the work was done specifically for U2's album \"The Joshua Tree\". In 1990 the main studio moved to a new location on Ringsend Road, also in the Docklands .\n\nFollowing the move, the Windmill Lane building continued to house various post-production facilities. These included Windmill Lane Pictures (a video post-production facility), incorporating Number 4 (an audio post-production facility), Trend Studios (audio mastering) and a number of other related services.\n\nThe original studio buildings were covered in graffiti from fans, who had paid pilgrimage from all over the world, many attracted by the studio's historical connection with U2. The original location of the studios were recommended as a tourist attraction by publications such as \"The New York Times\" in 2008.\n\nThe post-production studios at Windmill Lane became the first building in Ireland to buy a Baselight colour grading system on 2 April 2008. The studios have been used for several films, including \"In America\" and \"Get Rich and Die Tryin'\" directed by Jim Sheridan, and has been used for American films made in Ireland, examples of which include \"King Arthur\" and \"Veronica Guerin\".\n\nPlans to construct a six-storey office block on the old site led to criticism from local resident groups in early September 2008.\n\nThe Windmill Lane site was then bought by property companies Hibernia REIT in 2015, who announced in 2014 that it had purchased the loans held against the Hanover Building on Windmill Lane, Dublin, for €20.16 million and an adjoining one acre development site for €7.5 million. A plan was made to develop it into offices, retail spaces and residential units.\n\nThe original Windmill Lane Studios structure was demolished on 3 April 2015, by property investment company Hibernia REIT, with the exception of Open Gallery 3 where U2 recorded. The firm announced plans to retain a 20-metre stretch of the studio wall famous for its fan graffiti. Options for the future of the wall include recreating the wall in the atrium of the new Windmill Lane building, giving the wall to Dublin City Council, U2 or any other interested party for reconstruction or reuse in an alternative setting. Another possibility is donating the wall to a charity so that they can auction pieces of it to U2 fans around the world.\n\nIn 1990, Windmill Lane Studios relocated from its original base on Windmill Lane to its current location on Ringsend Road, Dublin 4.\n\nOrchestras regularly record their music at Windmill Lane Recording Studios, as Studio One is the only recording room in Ireland that can record an 80-piece orchestra apart from Raidió Teilifís Éireann. The scores to many movies have been recorded there: \"\", \"Syng Street\", \"A Room with a View\", \"The Remains of the Day\", \"The Mask\" and \"The Tailor of Panama\"\", The Grifters\", \"My Left Foot\" (both by Elmer Bernstein), \"In America\", and \"A River Runs Through It\".\n\nStudio Two is known for being responsible for a high number of number-one albums, recorded by artists such as Gabrielle, Kylie Minogue and The Spice Girls. Kate Bush partially recorded her 1985 album \"Hounds of Love\" at Windmill Lane Studios. The Waterboys recorded their 1988 album \"Fisherman's Blues\" at Windmill Lane Studios.\n\nThe studio remained empty from 2006 onwards, although reports circulated which linked Van Morrison with purchasing the studio for his own personal use that August. Morrison had previously recorded several albums there, including \"Back on Top\", \"Magic Time\" and \"Pay the Devil\". In January 2008, the studio was used to record \"The Ballad of Ronnie Drew\".\n\nIn 2009, Dale Entertainments Ltd. took over Windmill Lane Recording Studios and updated the studios. Music of all types and genres continue to be recorded here, from pop and electronic to jazz and classical film scores. A multitude of Grammy Award winning albums hang on the walls of the studios inside. Artists and projects recorded here include : U2, David Bowie, Kate Bush, Riverdance, The Rolling Stones, The Cranberries, Metallica, Depeche Mode, The Commitments, Westlife, The Spice Girls, Lady Gaga, The Jonas Brothers, Van Morrison, Kylie Minogue, The Script, Ed Sheeran, Hozier and many more.\n\nIn mid-February 2012, the studio issued an appeal to artists who recorded there to collect their master tapes, stating they will be otherwise be destroyed. The studio noted the tapes, numbering over 1,000 and weighing a tonne, were recorded before digital technology and were both deteriorating and are taking up valuable space. Subsequently, all tapes owned by Island Records were recovered by them.\n\nOn 20 February 2020, the studio launched a visitor experience. President of Ireland Michael D. Higgins was the guest of honour along with key music industry personalities. Guests were treated to a surprise musical performance by Paul Brady and Donal Lunny in the iconic Studio 1.\n\n"}
{"id": "1881411", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1881411", "title": "Days of the New (1999 album)", "text": "Days of the New (1999 album)\n\nDays of the New (also known as the Green album or Days of the New II) is the second self-titled album of Louisville rock band Days of the New. Released on August 31, 1999, it marks the first album following the break up of the original lineup and the last under Outpost. While not nearly as commercially successful as its 1997 predecessor, \"Green\" acquired stronger appreciation by critics and featured two successful singles.\n\nShortly after finishing their 1998 tour with Metallica and Jerry Cantrell, after much turmoil, the original Days of the New split up. Todd Whitener, Matt Taul, and Jesse Vest would go on to form Tantric while Meeks carried on the Days of the New name. In February 1999, it was reported that while his ex-bandmates were looking for a new singer, Meeks was finishing up work on a second album tentatively titled \"Days of the New 2\" with an expected release in late spring or early summer that year. He eventually formed a new band lineup and hired an orchestra for his sophomore effort.\n\nIn contrast to the debut album, which has a more stripped down acoustic style, \"Green\" incorporates many different elements, namely an orchestra and female backing vocals. The darker song writing is also deemphasized in favor of more upbeat melodies as seen in \"Flight Response\" and \"Take Me Back Then.\" Many of the album's songs contain intros and codas to seamlessly carry into the next song. While largely maintaining the acoustic feel of its predecessor (as evidenced by the folk number \"Provider\") \"Green\" even utilizes electronic percussion more commonly found in dance club music, particularly in the track \"Enemy.\" This song, along with \"Weapon and the Wound,\" became the album's radio singles.\n\nA young Nicole Scherzinger put her studies at Wright State University on hold to sing backing vocals for \"Green\". Meeks noted that he wanted a female singer to \"deliver some more world/operatic textures and sounds\" and that her contributions were not buried in the back but instead featured prominently alongside his. Scherzinger performs on “Flight Response,” “The Real,” “Take Me Back Then,” “Phobics of Tragedy,” “Bring Yourself,” and “Last One.” Meeks claims that after touring for the album, the two grew apart creatively and that despite being an \"amazing entertainer,\" she \"didn’t seem to understand music very well.\"\n\nIn June 1999, the band was tentatively planned to tour in Europe in September before a lengthy US tour in the summer of 2000, but this did not pan out. Meeks debuted his new seven-member band lineup on September 4, 1999 at the Ear Xtacy store in Louisville. According to Pollstar, the official tour would begin in Pensacola, Florida on October 22; however, Yahoo! Music stated that same day that touring would run from October 21 in Chattanooga, Tennessee through November 27 in Louisville, Kentucky. The concerts exhibited \"more of a dramatic show\" and \"more of a choreographed direction\" compared to previous Days of the New tours. This included backdrop screen, stage props, and other effects and, in the words of Travis Meeks, wouldn't be \"just a rock 'n' roll show\" but \" more of a sensory-experience thing.\"\n\nAccording to Meeks, the band toured for two months in support of \"Green\" after which he and Scherzinger had a \"small fling.\" Despite her already having a boyfriend, Meeks admits to having had a crush on her during this period. He later expressed interest in working with her again on his much delayed \"Days of the New Presents Tree Colors\".\n\n\"Green\" features two singles. Its lead, \"Enemy,\" charted well and gained music video rotation on MTV. The track introduced Day of the New's new sound to the mainstream with its unique blend of acoustic and electronic elements. A second single, \"Weapon and the Wound,\" features a somber ballad approach heavily showcasing the clarinet. It charted at #10 on Mainstream Rock Tracks but did not achieve the success of its predecessor.\n\nCritics were fairly enthusiastic of \"Green\". Allmusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine named it an AMG Album Pick and praised Meeks' production abilities, calling it a \"definite improvement from his debut.\" Tom Lanham of \"Entertainment Weekly\" gave it a B grade and noted, \"Like Roger Waters, [Meeks] toys with colorful tones and textures and waxes ponderous in a schoolmaster baritone. Some tracks stumble awkwardly, but inventive oomph pulls this naif through.\"\n\nDespite better critical reception, \"Green\" sold poorly compared to the first album. By October 1999, it had sold only 124,000 copies according to SoundScan. It would eventually reach around 450,000 copies sold. Only one song, \"Enemy\", was a major hit, and the second single, a ballad entitled \"Weapon and the Wound,\" charted reasonably well.\n\nAll songs written by Travis Meeks except where noted.\n\n\n\n\n\nSingles - Billboard (North America)\n"}

It includes the former Booths Farm sand quarry, Aldridge Road Recreation Ground, and Kingstanding Circle. The ward borders the Metropolitan Borough of Walsall and areas such as Perry Beeches and Queslett. Parts fall within Great Barr.\n\nThe nearest library serving the ward is Kingstanding Library.\n\nThe area is mainly a housing estate built in the 1930s and 1940s. Before this it was mainly rural farmland.\n\nThe 2001 Population Census recorded that there were 24,073 people living in the ward. 9.4% (2,273) of the ward's population consists of an ethnic minority which is low compared to the average percentage of 29.6% for that of Birmingham.\n\nThe ward of Oscott is represented on Birmingham City Council by Barbara Dring of the Labour Party. \n\nThe ward has adopted a Ward Support Officer.\n\nThe \"Oscott Ward Local Action Plan\" was a locally organised plan to improve the quality of living within the ward during 2004 and 2005.

It is a provincial branch of the Communist Party of Canada.\n\nAlberta had recognized Communist Party speakers and activists starting at the time of the founding of the Communist Party of Canada in 1922. The first years were troubled by uncertainty of its relationship to the radical One Big Union movement, that had originated in Alberta in 1919.\n\nThe post-World War I depression caused many Albertans to seek radical change of the economic system and the Communist Party was a potent force, active in organizing amongst, and lobbying governments on behalf of, the poor unemployed in the cities, struggling farmers and poorly paid urban workers. Its radical views found a good hearing among the immigrant communities who had fled unfair economic conditions in their homelands—Ukrainian, Finnish, Italians and Jews were prominent in the early movement, while British Communist immigrants led the movement due to their facility in the English language and their secure citizenship. Recent immigrants from other lands, even if naturalized, could be deported back to their land of origin due to political activism, and many were.\n\nCommunist Party member Henry Bartholomew, a well-known Communist speaker and lecturer in the city, ran in a 1924 Edmonton by-election under the banner of the Canadian Labour Party, which at the time took in both non-Communists and Communist Party members. He came in a strong third with 29 percent of the vote, and the transferable balloting system in effect at the time gave him more votes in the first round of ballot transfers, so that he was almost in second place, but, held out of the first two spots, he was dropped off and his ballots re-distributed.\n\nThe Communist Party first ran its own candidate in the Edmonton by-election of January 9, 1931. It contested two more by-elections after that, the last of which was a by-election held on October 7, 1937 in the Edmonton electoral district in which Jan Lakeman, leader of the Alberta Communists, finished third. The party has not contested another by-election since but has placed candidates in many general provincial elections, beginning in 1935.\n\nThe federal government, worried about its latent strength, banned the Communist Party of Canada (and its Alberta wing) in the early 1930s and again at the start of World War II.\n\nCommunist Party candidates had some reasonable results under the Single Transferable Vote system that Alberta used between 1924 and 1959, but its candidates rarely made it past the first vote transfer.\n\nThe party has been a very minor force due to Alberta's conservative politics that overtook the province starting in the 1940s. It achieved its best results in the 1940s with a couple of distant second-place finishes. In those elections, it called itself the \"Labor-Progressive Party\" because of the federal government's ban. (see also United Progressive which the party used in the 1940 election in Vegreville)\n\nThe party started using the Communist name again in 1963.\n\nThe Communist Party was less successful than other left wing parties in the province, such as the Labour Party and the Cooperative Commonwealth Federation. In the 1975 provincial election, the Communist Party split the far left wing vote with the Constitutional Socialist Party, and in other elections the Communist Party of Canada (Marxist-Leninist) also ran candidates.\n\nThe Communist Party did not run in the 1967 and 1971 elections. The party has run at least one candidate in every general election since then. In recent years, the Communist Party has not attracted more than a couple candidates with vote totals that rarely top 100 in each electoral district contested.\n\n"}

It is in the civil parish of Bletchley and Fenny Stratford and is categorised by the Office of National Statistics as part of Bletchley. It is in the civil parish of West Bletchley. The A5 forms its eastern and northern boundary; parts of Bletcham Way and Saxon St form its southern boundary. The overall district has five sub districts, divided by Watling St/Denbigh Rd, the 'uptick' of Bletcham Way and Grafton Street, and Saxon Street northbound. The district names are planning designations that have persisted without ever being changed to the style \"North Denbigh\" etc. as is the norm elsewhere in Britain.\n\nThese lands to the east of Watling Street were originally in the manor of Simpson.\n\nThis district, next to the junction of the A5 with the A421, includes the 30,500 all-seater Stadium MK for Milton Keynes Dons F.C. as well as an hotel and retail outlets.\n\nThe football stadium opened in July 2007 and was ready for the start of the 2007/08 season. An indoor basketball arena for the then Milton Keynes Lions basketball team was planned as part of the stadium complex but as of mid-2014 has yet to materialise.\n\nThe major retailers are an Asda supercentre and IKEA superstore, with smaller shops in the MK1 Shopping Park. The superstores were open for business by the end of 2005.\n\nThe first units of the MK1 Shopping Park, constructed later of the Asda and IKEA development, include a McDonald's and KFC on the Saxon Street side of the stadium, with a DW Sports Fitness centre on the Grafton Street side of the stadium.\n\nThe main retail centre of the MK1 Shopping Park opened in December 2012, which comprises Marks and Spencer, Outfit (previously BHS), H&M, New Look, Next, Primark and River Island which opened sites in the shopping park. The latter was developed adjacent to Stadium MK by InterMK and The Crown Estate. InterMK is owned by Pete Winkelman, chairman of the MK Dons.\n\nThe development also includes a newer leisure facility and cinema complex directly behind the stadium, comprising an Odeon IMAX Cinema, Nandos, Bella Italia, TGI Fridays, Prezzo and Frankie and Benny's which opened in late February/early March 2015.\n\nThe MK1 Shopping Park expanded once again, constructing a new five-unit development in the space between the original shopping park and the newer cinema complex. This comprises, at its opening, a JD Sports, Carphone Warehouse and Card Factory. This opened in early December 2017.\n\nThe hotel is a DoubleTree by Hilton Worldwide, part of the stadium complex.\n\nThe development is on the former site of 'Denbigh Sports Ground' and 'Denbigh North Leisure', an entertainment complex which was home to the Sanctuary Music Arena.\n\nDenbigh West is an employment area, best known as the home of Marshall Amplification. It is on the east side of Watling Street, west of Saxon Street..\n\nDenbigh East is another employment area, east of Saxon Street and west of the Grand Union canal.\n\nThis district is an industrial/employment area. The Milton Keynes central sorting office was here, with the post-code MK1 1AA. Many internet mapping sites assumed that this meant that it is the centre of Milton Keynes and mark it according. It is actually about three miles south of Central Milton Keynes (which has the MK9 postcode).\n\nThis is a small area, just north of the stadium. It is mainly industrial, but includes a mosque and a small, isolated, council housing block (that is planned for regeneration in the expansion plans for Milton Keynes).\n\nThe district takes its name from the original 'Marquis of Granby\" inn nearby, as described next.\n\nThe modern industrial district called Denbigh Hall is in West Bletchley rather than in Denbigh, but is mentioned here because its history gives rise to the name Denbigh. A local heritage map shows that it lies on the site of 'Denbigh Farm' It is separated from Denbigh by Watling Street.\n\nThe original Denbigh Hall was an inn on Watling Street, dating from 1710. Family recollections say that it had previously been known as 'the Marquis of Granby' but that it had changed its name in the eighteenth century when the sixth Earl of Denbigh stopped there overnight and was made so comfortable that he declared it his half-way house to London.\nThe inn no longer exists; its site is shown on the 1840 Ordnance Survey as just north of the bridge 158 where the West Coast Main Line crosses Watling Street. A third tale relates that the nobleman was given an axe when he asked for a bill. The same map shows a large private house, 'Denbigh Hall', to the south-east of the innits site is approximately at the junction of Whaddon Way with Melrose Avenue.\n\nNetwork Rail continues to use this name (Denbigh Hall) for its marshalling yards north of Bletchley railway station, near the site of the inn. The West Coast Main Line bridge (number 158) over Watling Street near here bears a plaque that explains that the first phase of the London and Birmingham Railway line terminated here, at Denbigh Hall station. At this point, passengers transferred to stage coaches for onward transfer by road to Birmingham.\n\n"}

It was released for the PlayStation in 1996, and a Microsoft Windows port was developed by Semi Logic Entertainments and released jointly by Crystal Dynamics and Activision in 1997. The game is the first title in the \"Legacy of Kain\" series.\n\nIn \"Blood Omen\", the player follows Kain, a slain nobleman newly resurrected as a vampire. Seeking revenge against his murderers and a cure to his vampiric curse, Kain is tasked with traversing the fictional land of Nosgoth and slaughtering the Circle of Nine, a corrupt oligarchy of godlike sorcerers, but slowly begins to forsake humanity and view his transformation as a blessing.\n\nSilicon Knights designed \"Blood Omen\" as \"a game which adults would want to play\", intending to evolve the action role-playing genre and bring artistic cinema to video game consoles. Reviewers praised its scope and storytelling, but criticized its lengthy loading times. After its release, a dispute arose concerning ownership of its intellectual property rights, after which Crystal Dynamics retained permission to continue the series with their 1999 sequel, \"\".\n\n\"Blood Omen\" is a two-dimensional action-adventure game. The player controls the protagonist, Kain, from a top-down perspective. Gameplay is divided between outdoor traversal and dungeon crawls, entailing hack and slash combat, puzzle-solving, and navigating hazards. To advance the story, Kain must locate and defeat the members of the Circle of Nine—who act as boss enemies—and return their tokens to the Pillars of Nosgoth. Humans, animals, and a variety of fantasy creatures inhabit the game world, whom the player can typically elect to kill outright, or alternatively wound in order to feed on their blood. As a vampire, Kain is required to consume the red blood of living creatures to replenish his health meter, which gradually drains over time, and diminishes more quickly if he sustains damage. When he casts spells or shapeshifts, he expends magic energy—this recovers in time, and can be replenished by drinking the blue blood of ghostly enemies. Conversely, undead opponents relinquish harmful black blood, and demons and mutants yield green blood which poisons Kain, causing his health to deplete at a swifter rate.\n\nOver the course of the main quest, Kain acquires many items and abilities, which facilitate increasingly nonlinear exploration. As he collects blood vials and rune pyramids, Kain's maximum blood and energy capacity rises. By drinking from blood fountains, he receives strength upgrades, faster magic regeneration, and immunity to weather effects. Weapons include iron and fire-elemental swords, a spiked mace, twin axes, and the Soul Reaver, a two-handed flamberge. Suits of iron, bone, chaos, flesh, and wraith armor feature, and each combination of equipment has advantages and drawbacks. Spells, in the form of magical tarot cards, are used in both strategic and practical contexts, their functions ranging from summoning artificial light to mind control and the evocation of lightning storms. Shapeshifting enables Kain to assume the forms of a bat, allowing for immediate travel to checkpoints; a wolf, with enhanced speed and the capacity to jump; a cloud of mist, which enables him to pass through gates and cross water; or a human, with which he can covertly interact with, or bypass, certain non-player characters. There are 100 secrets present in the game, logged if the player uncovers hidden areas, switches, and dungeons; these encompass spirit forges, at which Kain may donate a significant portion of his blood in exchange for powerful battle artifacts. A day and night cycle passes progressively—at night, Kain's attacks become more potent, and during full moon phases, some sealed doors become accessible.\n\n\"Blood Omen\" introduces the land of Nosgoth, a fantasy setting dominated by humans and vampires. The health of the world is inextricably connected to the Pillars of Nosgoth—nine supernatural edifices, each one protected and represented by a human guardian. These sorcerers collectively comprise the Circle of Nine, and if a member dies, a new guardian is called to take their place by the Pillars. Hundreds of years prior to the events of the story, the Circle formed and sponsored the Sarafan, an order of monastic warriors devoted to eradicating the vampire race, and in the game's prologue, the vampire Vorador reacts vengefully by killing six of the guardians and defeating Malek, the Sarafan leader. Though the Sarafan disband, vampires continue to be persecuted.\n\nIn the intervening years, new guardians have been summoned, Nosgoth's surviving vampires have retreated into hiding, and humanity has separated into two opposing factions: the kingdom of Willendorf, inspired by Arthurian legend, and the Legions of the Nemesis, an all-conquering army determined to bring an end to civilization. When the guardian of balance, Ariel, dies at the hands of a mysterious, malevolent entity, her lover Nupraptor the Mentalist turns his powers against his fellow Circle members, tainting the incumbent guardians with irrevocable madness and leaving the Pillars corrupt. To restore balance to Nosgoth, Kain must overcome the Legions and kill the insane sorcerers; as each Circle member is purged and their token returned, their respective Pillar is cleansed, and when he heals all nine Pillars, replacement guardians can be born.\n\nKain (voiced by Simon Templeman), an ambitious, cynical young nobleman murdered and reluctantly raised as a vampire, is the protagonist of \"Blood Omen\". Conceived as an antihero whose nature reflects the story's moral ambiguity, Kain was partially modeled on the character of William Munny from the 1992 Clint Eastwood film, \"Unforgiven\". Mortanius the Necromancer (Tony Jay), an ancient wizard, resurrects Kain in a Faustian bargain, and serves as his enigmatic benefactor and semi-father figure throughout the game. The reclusive and decadent vampire Vorador (Paul Lukather) acts as a mentor and father figure to Kain, encouraging him to accept vampirism, whereas the specter of the deceased balance guardian, Ariel (Anna Gunn), directs Kain in his quest to restore the land. The corrupt guardians—such as Moebius the Time Streamer (Richard Doyle), a devious manipulator of history, and Malek the Paladin (Neil Ross), now an animated suit of armor eternally condemned to protect the Circle following his defeat against Vorador—feature as the villains in the game. Other major characters include King Ottmar (Ross), the ruler of Willendorf; The Nemesis (Jay), a once-benign monarch known as William the Just, turned despot and tyrant; and The Dark Entity (Jay), an otherworldly being capable of demonic possession who is the overall mastermind and a primary antagonist and final boss of \"Blood Omen\" who seeks to topple the Circle and the Pillars and establish the reign in Nosgoth.\n\nDuring a journey, the human nobleman Kain is ambushed and killed by a band of assassins. Mortanius offers him the chance to exact revenge — Kain assents, heedless of the cost, and awakes as a vampire. Once he kills his attackers, Mortanius tells him that, while they were the instruments of his death, they were not the ultimate cause. In search of the truth, and a cure to his vampiric curse, Kain travels to the Pillars of Nosgoth. There, Ariel explains that he has to destroy the Circle of Nine before he can realize peace. Kain begins by tracking down and killing Nupraptor, and then confronts Malek, but their duel ends in a stalemate. To defeat Malek, Kain solicits the advice of the Oracle of Nosgoth. The Oracle forewarns him of the Legions of the Nemesis, and instructs him to seek out Vorador, Malek's old adversary. When the two meet, Vorador welcomes Kain, and offers his assistance, but urges the fledgling to embrace vampirism and refrain from interfering in the affairs of mankind.\n\nHaunted by the elder vampire, who serves as an example of what he will become if he fails to find a cure, Kain persists, and, in a decisive showdown, Vorador vanquishes Malek while Kain kills Bane the Druid and DeJoule the Energist. Later, after he slays Azimuth the Planer and recovers a time-streaming device, Ariel informs Kain that he must instead prioritize the war against The Nemesis, whose armies threaten to conquer Willendorf. Kain convinces King Ottmar to rally his troops against the Legions in a final stand, but the battle proves disastrous. Ottmar perishes, the Willendorf forces are overwhelmed, and Kain, cornered, uses the time-streaming device to escape. He emerges 50 years in the past, and kills the younger version of The Nemesis from this era—the beloved King William the Just—to trigger a temporal paradox which expunges the Legions from the timestream. However, when Kain returns to the present day, he discovers that William's murder has sparked a renewed vampire purge.\n\nThe Oracle of Nosgoth — revealed to be Moebius the Time Streamer, a member of the Circle — leads the genocidal crusade, and, having masterminded Kain's actions from the outset, consummates his trap by executing Vorador. Kain kills Moebius, but is left the last of his kind. At the Pillars, he witnesses Mortanius arguing with Anarcrothe the Alchemist, who reveals that Mortanius is a guardian, and culpable for both Ariel and Kain's deaths. Seduced by The Dark Entity, Mortanius was unwillingly controlled and forced to kill Ariel. To correct the imbalance, he created Kain, a creature potent enough to destroy the Circle. Mortanius slays Anarcrothe, and then succumbs to possession from The Dark Entity (the latter one being responsible behind everything that happened in Nosgoth) whom Kain defeats. With only one Pillar left unrestored, Kain reaches an epiphany: he himself is the final insane Circle member, Ariel's unwitting successor as guardian of balance, culled in the brief interval between her death and the Pillars' corruption. The \"cure\" to vampirism which he sought is his own death.\n\nPlayers can choose whether to heal the world — an ending in which Kain sacrifices his life, ensuring the extinction of the vampires and restoration of Nosgoth — or damn the world, in which case the Pillars collapse, leaving Nosgoth an irredeemable wasteland, with Kain fully embracing his curse and living on as the most powerful entity in the land. The latter choice is considered the canon ending leading to the rest of the series.\n\n\"Blood Omen\" originated as \"The Pillars of Nosgoth\", a game proposal drafted circa 1993 by Silicon Knights president Denis Dyack and art director and writer Ken McCulloch. In 1993, while Silicon Knights completed work on \"Dark Legions\", Dyack met Crystal Dynamics producer Lyle Hall at a conference, and they shared their mutual ambition to build \"epic\" games with bigger budgets and higher expectations than the then-current industry standard. Several publishers were sent \"The Pillars of Nosgoth\", the science fiction concept \"Too Human\", and a third competing Silicon Knights pitch. \"Too Human\" was almost pursued, but Crystal Dynamics—who felt that the high fantasy genre was a preferable choice—made a deal with Silicon Knights to produce \"The Pillars of Nosgoth\". Design work continued for approximately six to eight months before both parties reached agreement on the most suitable video game console to publish for. Hall, who had been \"instantly taken\" by the project, thought that \"it was obvious this game deserved a \"[Legend of] Zelda\"-style take on a vampire action RPG\", and assisted Dyack in convincing Crystal Dynamics to choose the newly announced PlayStation over the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer and Sega Saturn. Dyack and Hall believed that \"Blood Omen\" could help to evolve the action role-playing genre through strong writing and artistic, cinematic flair—Dyack summarized it as a game which adults would want to play.\n\nCentral influences included vampire mythology, William Shakespeare's plays, themes of ethical dilemma in the film \"Unforgiven\", the visceral qualities of the \"Necroscope\" novels, and the intricate plot of \"The Wheel of Time\" book series. Although antiheroes were previously uncommon in action-adventure games, Silicon Knights rejected concerns that the character of Kain was too unconventional and the story too ambitious. The developers endorsed the narrative motif, \"what is evil? Perhaps it is merely a perspective\", and hoped to determine how players would react in \"a world where [they] had to kill innocents to survive\". McCulloch, who wrote the majority of in-game texts, was urged by marketer colleagues to give characters more accessible names—he described some, such as Mortanius, as \"Names from Hell\", which were difficult to get past the \"marketing censor\". Cover art for the historical novel \"The Pillars of the Earth\" served as the inspiration behind the Pillars of Nosgoth. The Soul Reaver sword, which was originally conceived as a weapon for \"Too Human\", was transferred to \"Blood Omen\"'s fictional universe, and would become a mainstay weapon in subsequent games in the \"Legacy of Kain\" series.\n\nThe developers undertook a talent search for the game's voice cast, listening to dozens of tapes submitted by Hollywood voice actors. Before the game's voice-over was recorded, Dyack expressed concern that the actors cast would be unable to convey McCulloch's complex dialogue. He later said, however, that their performances \"blew him away\", commenting that \"after five minutes with Simon Templeman [...] we knew that there was no problem\".\n\n\"Blood Omen\"'s extended 3.5-year development period obliged Silicon Knights to double staff levels, and Crystal Dynamics flew employees to Canada to assist in their design work for over six months—this delegation was left to procure their own off-site accommodation, resulting in \"great personal sacrifice\". Prior to shipping, Activision and BMG Interactive reached arrangements with Crystal Dynamics to manufacture and distribute the product in various territories. In what they described as \"a first in the industry\", Silicon Knights added an opening credit to fully clarify that they were responsible for developing the game's concept, story, and content. \"After Herculean efforts\", having received promotion at the 1995 and 1996 E3 trade fairs, \"Blood Omen\" was released for the PlayStation in November 1996.\n\nActivision and Crystal Dynamics published a Microsoft Windows port, developed by Semi Logic Entertainments, in 1997. Work on a Saturn version was also commenced by Silicon Knights after the initial release. Employees at Crystal Dynamics, including Steve Groll, stated that the Saturn version was completed but that they could not find a publisher willing to release it. The Silicon Knights website insisted that this \"was simply not true\" and that the Saturn version was never finished.\n\n\"Blood Omen\" was named the best game showcased at the inaugural E3 fair by \"DieHard GameFan\" in 1995. A 2011 court filing revealed that it sold at least 320,082 units historically; Silicon Knights claimed it had sold 2 million copies in its lifetime, but did not substantiate this figure. Crystal Dynamics viewed its commercial performance as \"immensely successful\", and remarkable for the time.\n\nReview aggregator site GameRankings assigned the PlayStation version of the game an average rating of 83%. While critics awarded it high praise for its premise, audio, and scope, they commonly cited shortcomings in its graphics and technical aspects. Jeff Gerstmann of GameSpot appreciated its sound design and challenging gameplay, though he disapproved of its overhead perspective. IGN's staff discussed problems with the controls, but referenced the \"intense story\", atmosphere, and longevity of playtime as positives. The reviewer for \"Next Generation\" made a favorable comparison to the 1985 hack and slash game \"Gauntlet\", remarking on \"Blood Omen\"'s unique design elements, and the high production values behind its \"huge and extremely gory\" game world. The four reviewers of \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" were all enthusiastic about the game, citing its morbid tone, epic length, and strong plot. \"GamePro\"s Bro' Buzz remarked that \"The hauntingly compelling storyline triumphs over somewhat plodding action.\" He elaborated that the scrolling is jerky and unpredictable, at times forcing the player to engage in blind dueling along the edge of the screen. However, he highly praised the visual impact of both the cinematics and the backgrounds. 1UP.com's staff lauded the game in their synopsis, saying it offered \"the best plot of any PlayStation game to date\". They acknowledged its \"moody\" graphics and sound design, describing its art as \"beautifully rendered\", and its music as \"genius\".\n\nGameSpot's Greg Kasavin praised Kain as \"the perfect antihero\", and his story as \"unique, involving, and epic in proportion\", but said \"the game itself doesn't quite keep up\", hindered by sluggish controls and technological limitations. Despite deeming its linearity a flaw, Baldric of Game Revolution regarded the plot as intelligent and thoughtful, and commented on the game being \"surprisingly amoral\". Hugh Falk of \"PC Gamer\" echoed a complaint raised by both Gerstmann and \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" that the graphics are excessively dark, and was disappointed in the artificial intelligence, but dismissed these as \"minor\" grievances with the conclusion that \"Blood Omen\" was an excellent entry in the role-playing genre.\n\nThe game's cinematics and voice direction were considered exceptional by many publications, particularly relative to other titles of the day. 1UP.com's writers referred to the cast as \"actual talent\" comparative to other actors in the medium. Some reviewers, though, described the PlayStation iteration's loading times as particularly exorbitant and unsatisfactory. \"Next Generation\" and Bro' Buzz both decried these as \"noticeable and at times intrusive\", while IGN rebuked them as \"agonizing\", but said that they are common to disc-based games, and reasonably unobtrusive in \"Blood Omen\". Dyack rationalized the slowdown as a consequence of the PlayStation's random-access memory constraints on video data. Baldric noted in his review that the Windows port alleviated, but did not fully amend, the issue.\n\n\"Next Generation\" reviewed the PC version of the game, rating it two stars out of five, and stated that \"\"Kain\" for PC can be controlled by keyboard (less than ideal) or joystick (better), but a joypad is still best. Given this, and barring a screaming Pentium, the PC version just isn't nearly as good as what's already available on console.\"\n\n\"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" named \"Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain\" Role-Playing Game of the Year, explaining that, \"This was a close race with \"Suikoden\", but the dark and violent nature of Kain won. ... The excellent voice work, as well as the foreboding and violent cinemas, produced the perfect mood.\"\n\nBy the time \"Blood Omen\" was released, Crystal Dynamics had already secured a deal with Activision to publish a sequel. \"Blood Omen\" did receive a sequel, but its production was impeded by a litigious battle between the game's stakeholders and developer. In an interview conducted shortly after the PlayStation release, Dyack contemplated the possibility of creating a prequel centered around the character of Vorador—referring to it as part of the \"\"Blood Omen\" series\"—but mentioned that it was \"extremely unlikely\" that Silicon Knights would work with Crystal Dynamics again. Subsequently, the relationship between both parties dissolved, and Crystal Dynamics—who had withdrawn from software publishing to focus exclusively on game development—announced their own follow-up in the form of \"\". In 1997, GameSpot divulged that Silicon Knights had filed a lawsuit against their former partner for ownership of the series, requesting an injunction to prevent Crystal Dynamics from publicizing \"Soul Reaver\". Silicon Knights, they reported, accused Crystal Dynamics of plagiarizing their concept for a sequel.\n\nThe dispute was settled in private, with Crystal Dynamics retaining the rights to the game, and permission to create derivative work using its characters, provided they credit Silicon Knights as the developer of \"Blood Omen\" in their sequel. Crystal Dynamics was acquired by Eidos Interactive, who published \"Soul Reaver\" in 1999 to critical acclaim and commercial success. Later, it publicly emerged that \"Soul Reaver\" had never been a Silicon Knights concept. It originated as \"Shifter\"—an unrelated project inspired by Biblical mythology, devised by Crystal Dynamics' Amy Hennig and Seth Carus (both of whom had worked as designers on \"Blood Omen\")—whose team, initially reluctantly, reworked it into a \"Blood Omen\" sequel at the request of company management. Successive titles in what was now the \"Legacy of Kain\" series were produced by Crystal Dynamics and Eidos, whereas Silicon Knights walked away from the franchise to begin work on \"Too Human\", and later \"\".\n\nIn 2012, NeoGAF member Mama Robotnik highlighted public records of the 1997 court case. During the proceedings, Silicon Knights stated that they had ceded the \"Blood Omen\" intellectual property to Crystal Dynamics under \"financial duress\". Among other assertions, they claimed that Crystal Dynamics had breached an agreement in late 1996 by selling certain publishing rights to the game—and any potential sequels—to Activision for $2,000,000. Silicon Knights alleged that Crystal Dynamics had failed to inform them of their intention to leave the publishing business, and had misrepresented themselves to Activision as \"Blood Omen\"'s developer. The documents revealed that Activision commissioned Crystal Dynamics to develop a project codenamed \"\"Kain II\"\", but—dissatisfied with its quality—contracted Silicon Knights to create a competing proposal. Supposedly, Crystal Dynamics then disparaged Silicon Knights to Activision, while directly, and indirectly, approaching some of its staff to join them in working on their prototype.\n\nWhen the case was resolved, control of the \"Legacy of Kain\" trademark belonged to Crystal Dynamics, and \"Kain II\" was either canceled or superseded when \"Shifter\" became \"Soul Reaver\". Though Crystal Dynamics staff who worked on \"Soul Reaver\" declined to comment on the discovery, Dyack had previously affirmed that \"[they] tried to take it over\". He said that \"many people ask us if we like the direction they have gone in but it is so alien to what we created it is pointless to answer now. We understand that some people love the Soul Reaver series and we think that is great. However, it is not what we would ever have done\". In a 2008 interview, he elaborated his sentiment that \"if you look at Legacy of Kain where it is right now -- so diluted, so dysfunctional -- as a property itself, it's pretty much gone in a completely different direction than we would have ever taken it. [...] Even if the developer's good, and I think Crystal Dynamics is not a bad developer, you get this dilution of the content, because the original author is gone\".\n\nOn January 10, 2020, Denis Dyack announced a spiritual successor to Legacy of Kain called Deadhaus Sonata, which is a free-to-play cooperative action role playing video game.\n\n"}

{"id": "1881464", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1881464", "title": "Dental composite", "text": "Dental composite\n\nDental composite resins (better referred to as \"resin-based composites\" or simply \"filled resins\") are types of synthetic resins that are used in dentistry as restorative material or adhesives. Dental composite resins have certain properties that will benefit patients according to the patient's cavity. It has a micro-mechanical retention property that makes composite more effective for filling small cavities where amalgam fillings are not as effective and could therefore fall out (due to the macro-mechanical retention property of amalgam). Synthetic resins evolved as restorative materials since they were insoluble, of good tooth-like appearance, insensitive to dehydration, easy to manipulate and reasonably inexpensive. Composite resins are most commonly composed of Bis-GMA and other dimethacrylate monomers (TEGMA, UDMA, HDDMA), a filler material such as silica and in most current applications, a photoinitiator. Dimethylglyoxime is also commonly added to achieve certain physical properties such as flow-ability. Further tailoring of physical properties is achieved by formulating unique concentrations of each constituent.\n\nMany studies have compared the longevity of resin-based composite restorations to the longevity of silver-mercury amalgam restorations. Depending on the skill of the dentist, patient characteristics and the type and location of damage, composite restorations can have similar longevity to amalgam restorations. (See Longevity and clinical performance.) In comparison to amalgam, the appearance of resin-based composite restorations is far superior.\n\nTraditionally resin-based composites set by a chemical setting reaction through polymerization between two pastes. One paste containing an activator (not a tertiary amine, as these cause discolouration) and the other containing an initiator (benzoyl peroxide). To overcome the disadvantages of this method, such as a short working time, light-curing resin composites were introduced in the 1970s. The first light-curing units used ultra-violet light to set the material, however this method had a limited curing depth and was a high risk to patients and clinicians. Therefore, UV light-curing units were later replaced by visible light-curing systems which used Camphorquinone as a light source and overcame the issues produced by the UV light-curing units.\n\nThe Traditional Period\n\nIn the late 1960s, composite resins were introduced as an alternative to silicates and unfulfilled resins, which were frequently used by clinicians at the time. Composite resins displayed superior qualities, in that they had better mechanical properties than silicates and unfulfilled resins. Composite resins were also seen to be beneficial in that the resin would be presented in paste form and, with convenient pressure or bulk insertion technique, would facilitate clinical handling. The faults with composite resins at this time were that they had poor appearance, poor marginal adaptation, difficulties with polishing, difficulty with adhesion to the tooth surface, and occasionally, loss of anatomical form.\n\nThe Microfilled Period\n\nIn 1978, various microfilled systems were introduced into the European market. These composite resins were appealing, in that they were capable of having an extremely smooth surface when finished. These microfilled composite resins also showed a better clinical colour stability and higher resistance to wear than conventional composites, which favoured their tooth tissue-like appearance as well as clinical effectiveness. However, further research showed a progressive weakness in the material over time, leading to micro-cracks and step-like material loss around the composite margin. In 1981, microfilled composites were improved remarkably with regard to marginal retention and adaptation. It was decided, after further research, that this type of composite could be used for most restorations provided the acid etch technique was used and a bonding agent was applied.\n\nThe Hybrid Period\n\nHybrid composites were introduced in the 1980s and are more commonly known as resin-modified glass ionomer cements (RMGICs). The material consists of a powder containing a radio-opaque fluoroaluminosilicate glass and a photoactive liquid contained in a dark bottle or capsule. The material was introduced, as resin composites on their own were not suitable for Class II cavities. RMGICs can be used instead. This mixture or resin and glass ionomer allows the material to be set by light activation (resin), allowing a longer working time. It also has the benefit of the glass ionomer component releasing fluoride and has superior adhesive properties. RMGICs are now recommended over traditional GICs for basing cavities. There is a great difference between the early and new hybrid composites.\n\nInitially, resin-based composite restorations in dentistry were very prone to leakage and breakage due to weak compressive strength. In the 1990s and 2000s, such composites were greatly improved and have a compression strength sufficient for use in posterior teeth.\nToday's composite resins have low polymerization shrinkage and low coefficients of thermal shrinkage, which allows them to be placed in bulk while maintaining good adaptation to cavity walls. The placement of composite requires meticulous attention to procedure or it may fail prematurely. The tooth must be kept perfectly dry during placement or the resin will likely fail to adhere to the tooth. Composites are placed while still in a soft, dough-like state, but when exposed to light of a certain blue wavelength (typically 470 nm), they polymerize and harden into the solid filling (for more information, see Light activated resin). It is challenging to harden all of the composite, since the light often does not penetrate more than 2–3 mm into the composite. If too thick an amount of composite is placed in the tooth, the composite will remain partially soft, and this soft unpolymerized composite could ultimately lead to leaching of free monomers with potential toxicity and/or leakage of the bonded joint leading to recurring dental pathology. The dentist should place composite in a deep filling in numerous increments, curing each 2–3 mm section fully before adding the next. In addition, the clinician must be careful to adjust the bite of the composite filling, which can be tricky to do. If the filling is too high, even by a subtle amount, that could lead to chewing sensitivity on the tooth. A properly placed composite is comfortable, of good appearance, strong and durable, and could last 10 years or more.\n\nThe most desirable finish surface for a composite resin can be provided by aluminum oxide disks. Classically, Class III composite preparations were required to have retention points placed entirely in dentin. A syringe was used for placing composite resin because the possibility of trapping air in a restoration was minimized. Modern techniques vary, but conventional wisdom states that because there have been great increases in bonding strength due to the use of dentin primers in the late 1990s, physical retention is not needed except for the most extreme of cases. Primers allow the dentin's collagen fibers to be \"sandwiched\" into the resin, resulting in a superior physical and chemical bond of the filling to the tooth. Indeed, composite usage was highly controversial in the dental field until primer technology was standardized in the mid to late 1990s. The enamel margin of a composite resin preparation should be beveled in order to improve the appearance and expose the ends of the enamel rods for acid attack. The correct technique of enamel etching prior to placement of a composite resin restoration includes etching with 30%-50% phosphoric acid and rinsing thoroughly with water and drying with air only. In preparing a cavity for restoration with composite resin combined with an acid etch technique, all enamel cavosurface angles should be obtuse angles. Contraindications for composite include varnish and zinc oxide-eugenol. Composite resins for Class II restorations were not indicated because of excessive occlusal wear in the 1980s and early 1990s. Modern bonding techniques and the increasing unpopularity of amalgam filling material have made composites more attractive for Class II restorations. Opinions vary, but composite is regarded as having adequate longevity and wear characteristics to be used for permanent Class II restorations. Whether composite materials last as long or has the leakage and sensitivity properties when compared to Class II amalgam restorations was described as a matter of debate in 2008.<ref name=\"DOI10.4103/0972-0707.45247\"></ref>\n\nAs with other composite materials, a dental composite typically consists of a resin-based oligomer matrix, such as a bisphenol A-glycidyl methacrylate (BISGMA), urethane dimethacrylate (UDMA) or semi-crystalline polyceram (PEX), and an inorganic filler such as silicon dioxide (silica). Without a filler the resin wears easily, exhibits high shrinkage and is exothermic. Compositions vary widely, with proprietary mixes of resins forming the matrix, as well as engineered filler glasses and glass ceramics. The filler gives the composite greater strength, wear resistance, decreased polymerisation shrinkage, improved translucency, fluorescence and colour, and a reduced exothermic reaction on polymerisation. It also however causes the resin composite to become more brittle with an increased elastic modulus. Glass fillers are found in multiple different compositions allowing an improvement on the optical and mechanical properties of the material. Ceramic fillers include zirconia-silica and zirconium oxide.\n\nMatrices such as BisHPPP and BBP, contained in the universal adhesive BiSGMA, have been demonstrated to increase the cariogenicity of bacteria leading to the occurrence of secondary caries at the composite-dentin interface. BisHPPP and BBP cause an increase of glycosyltransferase in S. mutans bacteria, which results in increased production of sticky glucans that allow S.mutans' adherence to the tooth. This results in a cariogenic biofilms at the interface of composite and tooth. The cariogenic activity of bacteria increases with concentration of the matrix materials. BisHPPP has furthermore been shown to regulate bacterial genes, making bacteria more cariogenic, thus compromising the longevity of composite restorations. Researchers are highlighting the need for new composite materials to be developed which eliminate the cariogenic products currently contained in composite resin and universal adhesives.\n\nA coupling agent such as silane is used to enhance the bond between these two components. An initiator package (such as: camphorquinone (CQ), phenylpropanedione (PPD) or lucirin (TPO)) begins the polymerization reaction of the resins when blue light is applied. Various additives can control the rate of reaction.\n\nResin filler can be made of glasses or ceramics. Glass fillers are usually made of crystalline silica, silicone dioxide, lithium/barium-aluminium glass, and borosilicate glass containing zinc/strontium/lithium. Ceramic fillers are made of zirconia-silica, or zirconium oxide.\n\nFillers can be further subdivided based on their particle size and shapes such as:\n\nMacrofilled fillers have a particle size ranging from 5 - 10 µm. They have good mechanical strength but poor wear resistance. Final restoration is difficult to polish adequately leaving rough surfaces, and therefore this type of resin is plaque retentive.\n\nMicrofilled fillers are made of colloidal silica with a particle size of 0.4 µm. Resin with this type of filler is easier to polish compared to macrofilled. However, its mechanical properties are compromised as filler load is lower than in conventional (only 40-45% by weight). Therefore, it is contraindicated for load-bearing situations, and has poor wear resistance.\n\nHybrid filler contains particles of various sizes with filler load of 75-85% by weight. It was designed to get the benefits of both macrofilled and microfilled fillers. Resins with hybrid filler have reduced thermal expansion and higher mechanical strength. However, it has higher polymerisation shrinkage due to a larger volume of diluent monomer which controls viscosity of resin.\n\nNanofilled composite has a filler particle size of 20-70 nm. Nanoparticles form nanocluster units and act as a single unit. They have high mechanical strength similar to hybrid material, high wear resistance, and are easily polished. However, nanofilled resins are difficult to adapt to the cavity margins due to high volume of filler.\n\nBulk filler is composed of non-agglomerated silica and zirconia particles. It has nanohybrid particles and filler load of 77% by weight. Designed to decrease clinical steps with possibility of light curing through 4-5mm incremental depth, and reduce stress within remaining tooth tissue. Unfortunately, it is not as strong in compression and has decreased wear resistance compared to conventional material. \n\nAdvantages of composites:\n\n\n\nDirect dental composites are placed by the dentist in a clinical setting. Polymerization is accomplished typically with a hand held curing light that emits specific wavelengths keyed to the initiator and catalyst packages involved. When using a curing light, the light should be held as close to the resin surface as possible, a shield should be placed between the light tip and the operator's eyes. Curing time should be increased for darker resin shades. Light cured resins provide denser restoration than self-cured resins because no mixing is required that might introduce air bubble porosity.\n\nDirect dental composites can be used for:\n\nTypes of setting mechanisms:\nChemically cured resin composite is a two-paste system (base and catalyst) which starts to set when the base and the catalyst are mixed together.\n\nLight cured resin composites contains a photo-initiator (e.g. camphorquinone) and an accelerator. The activator present in light activated composite is diethyl-amino-ethyl-methacrylate (amine) or diketone.They interact when exposed to light at wavelength of 400-500 nm, i.e, blue region of the visible light spectrum. The composite sets when it is exposed to light energy at a set wavelength of light. Light cured resin composites are also sensitive to ambient light, and therefore, polymerisation can begin before use of the curing light.\n\nDual cured resin composite contains both photo-initiators and chemical accelerators, allowing the material to set even where there is insufficient light exposure for light curing.\n\nChemical polymerisation inhibitors (e.g. monomethyl ether of hydroquinone) are added to the resin composite to prevent polymerisation of the material during storage, increasing its shelf life.\n\nThis classification divides resin composite into three broad categories based on their handling characteristics:\n\nManufacturers manipulate the handling characteristics by altering the constituents of the material. Generally, the stiffer materials (packable) exhibit a higher filler content whilst fluid materials (flowable) exhibit lower filler loading.\n\nUniversal:\nThis is the traditional presentation of resin composites and performs well in many situations. However, their use is limited in specialised practice where more complex aesthetic treatments are undertaken. Indications include: the restoration of class I, II and III and IV where aesthetics is not paramount, and the repair of non-carious tooth surface loss (NCTSL) lesions. Contraindications include: restoration of ultraconservative cavities, in areas where aesthetics is critical, and where insufficient enamel is available for etching.\n\nFlowable:\nFlowable composites represent a relatively newer subset of resin-based composite material, dating back to the mid-1990s. Compared to universal composite, flowables have a reduced filler content (37–53%) thereby exhibiting ease of handling, lower viscosity, compressive strength, wear resistance and greater polymerisation shrinkage. Due to the poorer mechanical properties, flowable composites should be used with caution in high stress-bearing areas. However, due to its favourable wetting properties, it can adapt intimately to enamel and dentine surfaces. Indications include: restoration of small class I cavities, preventive resin restorations (PRR), fissure sealants, cavity liners, repair of deficient amalgam margins, and class V (abfraction) lesions caused by NCTSL. Contraindications include: in high stress-bearing areas, restoration of large multi-surface cavities, and if effective moisture control is unattainable.\n\nPackable:\nPackable composites were developed to be used in posterior situations. Unlike flowable composite, they exhibit a higher viscosity thereby necessitating greater force upon application to 'pack' the material into the prepared cavity. Their handling characteristics is more similar to dental amalgam, in that greater force is required to condense the material into the cavity. Therefore, they can be thought of as 'tooth-coloured amalgam'. The increased viscosity is achieved by a higher filler content (>60% by volume) – thereby making the material stiffer and more resistant to fracture, two properties that are ideal for materials to be used in the posterior region of the mouth. The disadvantage of the associated increased filler content is the potential risk of introducing voids along the cavity walls and between each layer of material. In order to seal any marginal deficiencies, the use of a single layer of flowable composite at the base of a cavity has been advocated when undertaking Class II posterior composite restorations when using packable composite.\n\nIndirect composite is cured outside the mouth, in a processing unit that is capable of delivering higher intensities and levels of energy than handheld lights can. Indirect composites can have higher filler levels, are cured for longer times and curing shrinkage can be handled in a better way.\nAs a result, they are less prone to shrinkage stress and marginal gaps and have higher levels and depths of cure than direct composites. For example, an entire crown can be cured in a single process cycle in an extra-oral curing unit, compared to a millimeter layer of a filling.\n\nAs a result, full crowns and even bridges (replacing multiple teeth) can be fabricated with these systems.\n\nIndirect dental composites can be used for:\n\nA stronger, tougher and more durable product is expected in principle. But in the case of inlays, not all clinical long-term-studies detect this advantage in clinical practice (see below).\n\nClinical survival of composite restorations placed in posterior teeth are in the range of amalgam restorations, with some studies seeing a slightly lower \nor slightly higher survival time compared to amalgam restorations.\nImprovements in composite technology and application technique make composites a very good alternative to amalgam, while use in large restorations and in cusp capping situations is still debated.\n\nAccording to a 2012 review article by Demarco \"et al.\" covering 34 relevant clinical studies, \"90% of the studies indicated that annual failure rates between 1% and 3% can be achieved with Class I and II posterior [rear tooth] composite restorations depending on the definition of failure, and on several factors such as tooth type and location, operator [dentist], and socioeconomic, demographic, and behavioral elements.\" This compares to a 3% mean annual failure rate reported in a 2004 review article by Manhart \"et al.\" for amalgam restorations in posterior stress-bearing cavities.\n\nThe Demarco review found that the main reasons cited for failure of posterior composite restorations are secondary caries (i.e. cavities which develop subsequent to the restoration), fracture, and patient behavior, notably bruxism (grinding/clenching.) Causes of failure for amalgam restorations reported in the Manhart \"et al.\"review also include secondary caries, fracture (of the amalgam and/or the tooth), as well as cervical overhang and marginal ditching. The Demarco \"et al.\" review of composite restoration studies noted that patient factors affect longevity of restorations: Compared to patients with generally good dental health, patients with poorer dental health (possibly due to poor dental hygiene, diet, genetics, frequency of dental checkups, etc.) experience higher rates of failure of composite restorations due to subsequent decay. Socioeconomic factors also play a role: \"People who had always lived in the poorest stratus [\"sic\"][stratum?] of the population had more restoration failures than those who lived in the richest layer.\"\n\nThe definition of failure applied in clinical studies may affect the reported statistics. Demarco \"et al\" note: \"Failed restorations or restorations presenting small defects are routinely treated by replacement by most clinicians. Because of this, for many years, the replacement of defective restorations has been reported as the most common treatment in general dental practice...\" Demarco \"et al\" observe that when both repaired and replaced restorations were classified as failures in one study, the Annual Failure Rate was 1.9%. However, when repaired restorations were reclassified as successes instead of failures, the AFR decreased to 0.7%. Reclassifying repairable minor defects as successes rather than failures is justifiable: \"When a restoration is replaced, a significant amount of sound tooth structure is removed and the preparation [i.e. hole] is enlarged\". Applying the narrower definition of failure would improve the reported longevity of composite restorations: Composite restorations can often be easily repaired or extended without drilling out and replacing the entire filling. Resin composites will adhere to the tooth and to undamaged prior composite material. In contrast, amalgam fillings are held in place by the shape of the void being filled rather than by adhesion. This means that it is often necessary to drill out and replace an entire amalgam restoration rather than add to the remaining amalgam.\n\nIt might be expected that the costlier indirect technique leads to a higher clinical performance, however this is not seen in all studies. A study conducted over the course of 11 years reports similar failure rates of direct composite fillings and indirect composite inlays. Another study concludes that although there is a lower failure rate of composite inlays it would be insignificant and anyway too small to justify the additional effort of the indirect technique.\nAlso in the case of ceramic inlays a significantly higher survival rate compared to composite direct fillings can not be detected.\n\nIn general, a clear superiority of tooth coloured inlays over composite direct fillings could not be established by current review literature (as of 2013).\n\n"}

His claims that major incidents such as the Port Arthur massacre, terror attacks in Bali and Jakarta and the 2004 Asian tsunami were the work of Israeli and American secret agents gained a measure of notoriety in Australia, America and Indonesia.\n\nJoe Vialls self-published a number of books including \"Deadly Deception at Port Arthur\", \"The Murder of Policewoman Yvonne Fletcher\" and \"Lockerbie and the Bombing of Pan Am 103\", and was the author of hundreds of internet articles.\n\nMany of Vialls' investigations blamed significant world events – such as the 2004 Asian tsunami – on joint CIA–Mossad operations, and Vialls maintained in disclaimers on his site that his reports were written in the interest of public safety. In other investigations, Vialls supposedly proved that such esoteric happenings as the death of Diana, Princess of Wales and a scandal involving the wearing of a swastika by Prince Harry were Zionist plots.\n\nIt has been claimed that much of his published work is anti-Semitic and anti-American in nature.\n\n\nVialls was a self-proclaimed private investigator dedicated to \"exposing media disinformation,\" and made many claims in his reports disputing official explanations for events. The website thewebfairy.com wrote a comprehensive report, rebutting Vialls' claims regarding the crash of American Airlines Flight 77 into the Pentagon on 11 September 2001. The rebuttal centred mainly on Vialls' comparison of the Pentagon crash with an incident in which an Israeli El Al 747-200F cargo plane, flight 1862, crashed into a 12-story apartment block in the Amsterdam suburb of Bijlmer on 4 October 1992.\n\nHe also disputed the official explanation for the bombings of the Australian embassy and Marriott Hotel in Jakarta, Indonesia's capital. Vialls asserted that the explosives that authorities claimed were used in the Indonesian bombings were not powerful enough to have caused the damage and casualties that resulted. He claimed to demonstrate from photographs of the aftermath of each of the bombings, compared to the photographs taken in Northern Ireland where a 1,000 pound IRA bomb did not leave a crater or strip concrete from buildings, that a \"micronuke\" from Mossad's Dimona research and development facility in the Negev desert had been used. Vialls claims a device similar to the smallest United States nuclear weapon known as the Davy Crockett or M-388 round, a version of the W54 warhead, a very small sub-kiloton fission device, was used in the attacks. The Mk-54 weighed about 51 lb (23 kg), with a selectable yield of 10 or 20 tons, which Vialls claimed was consistent with the damage inflicted in Bali and elsewhere. A complete Mk-54 round weighed 76 lb (34.5 kg). One criticism of Vialls' theory was the absence of any radiation in Bali after the explosion. Vialls explained this flaw by arguing that Geiger counters cannot effectively detect alpha radiation, the most likely radiation to be present after the detonation of a plutonium fission bomb, since alpha particles are large and do not penetrate the walls of the Geiger-Muller tubes adequately enough to register radiation. In his investigation of the first Bali bomb, Vialls cited an opinion article in the Jakarta Post, Indonesia's largest English-language newspaper by circulation, written by an expatriate editor at the Post, which expounded a similar theory.\n\nVialls' theories have received popular support among leaders of some Muslim factions in Indonesia, who have cited his theories as fact. Indonesian internet forum \"Swara Muslim\" ('Muslim voice') wrote an opinion piece stating that Vialls' claim that the bombing of the Australian embassy was conducted by the CIA and Mossad was \"based on solid fact.\" Indonesian Muslim cleric Abu Bakar Ba'asyir told Australia's ABC radio that he believed Vialls' theory regarding the first Bali bomb was a correct one.\n\nAfter a period of illness, Vialls was reported to have died at the Royal Perth Hospital in Western Australia on 17 July 2005 of a heart attack.\n\n"}

The spillway from race to river is seen to be still there, and the slots for the removable plank weir can be seen. The riverside walk continues as the John Morris Jones Walkway past the site of Robin Hood Lane ford, across Cotterills Meadow which has been Colebank Playing Field for the last ninety years until it reaches the Grade II Listed water mill, Sarehole Mill at Hall Green. The Coldbath Brook, a tributary of the Cole, drives the mill which is now a museum and one of the inspirations for J. R. R. Tolkien's \"The Lord of the Rings\". The Shire Country Park ranger office is located at Sarehole Mill.\nTolkien and his brother spent their childhood in Birmingham with their widowed mother. They first lived in the hamlet of Sarehole, which Tolkien said were the happiest years of his youth. Sarehole is said to have been the model for The Shire, home to the hobbits. Every year the Tolkien Weekend is held at Sarehole Recreation Ground and Moseley Bog Local Nature Reserve part of the Shire Country Park. 2005 commemorated the 50th anniversary of the release of The Lord of the Rings. Ronald and his brother spent many hours playing around Sarehole Mill and being chased away by the miller's son. The Mill features in \"The Hobbit\" when Bilbo Baggins runs \"as fast as his furry feet could carry him down the lane, past the great Mill, across The Water and then on for a mile or more.\" In the 1960s Tolkien contributed to a public appeal to restore the mill which had become dilapidated. It is now a museum and is the only surviving water mill in the City's ownership.\n\nContinuing to Green Lane ford which, like those at Slade and Scribbers Lane, has been concreted and the wooden footbridge is the latest of many, earlier ones have been swept away by sudden torrents. When the meadow below Green Road was opened as part of the riverside walk in the 1960s, the Cole was re-coursed and two weirs topped by step-stones were installed. Next, the river crosses the A3400, Stratford Road, the site of the former 13th-century Greet Mill, whose pool was the ponded river. In 1914 two brick bridges, over the river channel and a flood-race, were replaced by a two-arched brick bridge with a stone balustrade which allowed tramcars to cross the river and go on to Hall Green. The mill went out of use about 1843, was demolished and forgotten.\n\nBetween Stratford Road and Formans Road, known in the 14th century as Foulemoreslone and which used the Fole- or Fullford (foul ford) the stretch is known as Blackberry Way, being named after consultation with local residents and highly suitable, as this is one of the best blackberry picking sections of The Shire Country Park.\n\nThe river is bridged by the A41, Warwick Road at Greet, there is no documentary evidence for a ford here, and then continues north, passing under the Grand Union Canal and the Chiltern Main Line railway at Hay Mills close to the Ackers trust outdoor pursuits centre.\n"}

The theatre was a permanent home for Barry Jackson's increasingly well established amateur theatre group, The Pilgrim Players, later known as Birmingham Repertory Company. Barry Jackson funded the construction of the theatre and established his professional company there.\n\nArchitect S. N. Cooke, a colleague from the Birmingham School of Art collaborated with Barry Jackson in the creation of the theatre. Both Jackson and Cooke took inspiration from the democratic nature of theatres they had visited in Germany. The design of The Old Rep was particularly influenced by Max Littmann's 1908 Künstlertheater in Munich.\n\nIn 2014, Birmingham Ormiston Academy, also known as BOA, successfully tendered for The Old Rep Theatre.\n\nThe theatre is situated just opposite New Street Station, from which a blue plaque, above the theatre's first floor windows, to Barry Jackson can be seen. Two doors down is Britain's oldest working cinema, the Electric Cinema.\n\nConstruction on the venue began in October 1912 and continued day and night for four months. The Grade II listed building has been well-preserved and still retains many of its original features.\n\nThe theatre opened its doors on 15 February 1913 with a performance of William Shakespeare's \"Twelfth Night\", preceded by a reading from Barry Jackson, of the poem \"The Mighty Line\" by resident playwright John Drinkwater (playwright). The company began what would become more than a century of history with a vision led by Jackson that theatre should \"\"serve as art instead of making that art serve a commercial purpose.\"\" With a wealth of local talent, the theatre produced a rolling bill of plays, both classic texts and new writing.\n\nIn 1917, the Birmingham Repertory Company became a pioneer in the theatre industry by becoming the first UK venue to appoint a female stage manager, Maud Gill. She left a fascinating and entertaining account of her experiences in her autobiography 'See the Players'. She was told that \"\"a woman ought not to be put in charge of stagehands because \"working men\" would not take orders from her, but she decided that, since mothers has been keeping order in the home since the beginning of time, the way to go about it was to treat them as a mother would treat her family. It worked.\"\"\n\nIn 1923, Barry Jackson received a gold medal from the Birmingham Civic Society which was shortly followed by a knighthood in 1925 for his services to the theatre. Sir Barry Jackson's significant role in the Birmingham's arts scene was to be recognised once again in 1955 when he was awarded the freedom of the city.\n\nThe theatre were awarded their first Arts Council England grant in 1954 worth £3,000 which now equates to £77,000. Shortly after in 1960, Barry Jackson met with Birmingham City Council and Arts Council England to guarantee the funding to build a new arts venue. This was eventually agreed in 1968, and plans for the new Rep began to take place.\n\nIn 1971 they moved to a newly built theatre on Broad Street, now known as Birmingham Repertory Theatre, with The Old Rep taken into ownership by Birmingham City Council. However, this wasn't the last time the company would be based at Station Street, returning to The Old Rep between 2011 and 2013 while the Birmingham Repertory Theatre and the Library of Birmingham underwent redevelopment. The company celebrated their centenary year at their original home with a programme of performances, tours and creative activities for the people of Birmingham.\n\nThe Old Rep has played a central role in the early careers of many of the UK's most celebrated actors and theatre-makers. Here are a few of those notable names, who have all performed at The Old Rep.\n\n\n"}

Tolkien and is one of only two working water mills in Birmingham, with the other being New Hall Mill in Walmley, Sutton Coldfield.\n\nBuilt in 1542 on the site of a previous pool. It was once known as \"Bedell's\" or \"Biddle's Mill\" after the name of an early owner. In 1727 it was described as \"High Wheel Mill\".\n\nAs early as 1755, the mill was leased by Matthew Boulton, one of the pioneers of the Industrial Revolution and leading figure of the Lunar Society for scientific experimentation. It is believed he converted the machinery for use in metal working. As well as milling grain it has been used for grinding bones for fertiliser, metal rolling (Matthew Boulton) and wire drawing.\n\nThe current building dates from 1771 and was in use until 1919. Thereafter it fell into a state of disrepair and dereliction. A local community campaign to save the mill was launched when demolition was mooted, and was finally successful with the mill being restored in 1969.\n\nSarehole Mill is open from Easter to the end of October, 12:00 till 16:00 every day except Monday unless Monday is a national holiday in which case it is open, entry £3.00, children under 16 free.\n\nIn April 2012 the mill pond was drained to repair the sluice gates, and in the winter of 2012–13 the heavily silted mill pond was dredged.\n\nIn 2012/2013 Sarehole Mill underwent a £375,000 overhaul of the roof, chimney, millpond, water wheel and machinery were restored to produce flour again. A newly constructed outdoor bread oven is used regularly to bake bread using the flour ground on site. Sarehole Mill has a team of 10 volunteer millers, 15 volunteer gardeners and eight volunteer guides. The site received 17,909 visitors in 2018.\n\nMillers are at work every Wednesday and Sunday if there is enough water. Sarehole Mill produces wholemeal flour which is sold in the mill shop. The flour is also used by local restaurants and bakers.\n\nIn 1852 the water wheels at Sarehole Mill were supplemented by a single cylinder steam engine. Although water would have been the primary energy source powering the mill, the addition of a steam engine would have ensured uninterrupted operation of the mill. Unfortunately the original steam engine was at some point removed, the current engine is of similar size and capacity, being a single cylinder table engine of , albeit currently in a non-functioning state and of unknown manufacturer.\n\nThe current engine was installed as part of the restoration of the mill in 1975. It was formerly used by a sweet manufacturer, Smith Kendon Ltd, at their factories in England and Messina, Italy, where it was used up until 1948. It was donated to the Birmingham Museum of Science and Industry in 1952 before being moved to Sarehole.\n\nJ. R. R. Tolkien lived within 300 yards of the mill at around the turn of century, between the ages four and eight, and would have seen it from his house. The locale at that time was rural Worcestershire farmland and countryside. He has also said that he used the mill as a location in \"The Lord of the Rings\", for the Mill at Hobbiton. In an interview with Guardian journalist, John Ezard in 1966, before the mill's restoration, Tolkien said:\n\nThe grounds nearby host the annual \"Tolkien Weekend\" event that celebrates the life and works of Tolkien. The mill is part of the Shire Country Park.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1881530", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1881530", "title": "Subway Sect", "text": "Subway Sect\n\nSubway Sect were one of the first British punk bands. Although their commercial success was limited by the small amount of recorded material they released, they have been credited as highly influential on the Postcard Records scene and the indie pop genre which followed. \n\nThe core of the band was singer-songwriter, Vic Godard, plus assorted soul fans, who congregated around early gigs by the Sex Pistols until Malcolm McLaren suggested they form their own band.\nSubway Sect were among the performers at the 100 Club Punk Festival on Monday, 21 September 1976 - sharing the bill with Siouxsie and the Banshees, The Clash and the Sex Pistols. The first line-up of Godard on vocals, Paul Packham on drums, Paul Myers on bass and Rob Symmons on guitar lasted for four gigs before Mark Laff replaced Packham. Laff himself then left for fellow punk group Generation X after the White Riot tour. A third drummer, Bob Ward, was recruited, and it is this line-up that can be heard on the band's first John Peel session and also on the single \"Nobody's Scared\". This was the first and only release on Braik Records, a label owned by Bernie Rhodes, who managed both Subway Sect and The Clash. Rhodes subsequently supervised the recording of their debut album at Gooseberry Studios in London, with Clash sound man and producer Mickey Foote at the production helm. At that time the band toured intensively with The Clash and others.\n\nHowever, just as their first album was ready for release, for reasons that remain obscure, Rhodes sacked all the band (except Godard) and Subway Sect mark 1 ceased to exist. The album was never released, although a single from the sessions \"Ambition\" was remixed and released on Rough Trade Records, with the B-side \"Different Story (Rock and Roll Even)\" also taken from the same sessions. \"Ambition\" was ranked at No. 15 among the top \"Tracks of the Year\" for 1978 by \"NME\". A further track \"Parallel Lines\" was released as a track on the \"C81\" cassette produced by \"NME\" magazine. Since then, some monitor copies of tracks from the lost album have come to light on various Subway Sect compilations, including a Motion Records' \"20 Odd Years\" double album anthology, and a CD and CD/EP set \"We Oppose All Rock And Roll\" on Overground Records. Any copies of the actual album tapes appear to no longer exist.\n\nAs a result of 1977 appearances at The Roxy club in London, live recordings were made of Subway Sect performances by Don Letts, the club's disc jockey. Subway Sect appears in Letts' \"Punk Rock Movie\" (1978).\n\nGodard reformed the band and as 'Vic Godard and Subway Sect' finally released their debut album \"What's the Matter, Boy?\" in 1980, following a period of shifting group personnel. The album features many songs written during the previous incarnation of the band, but performed with radically altered arrangements.\n\nBy this time, Godard had become increasingly influenced by early rockabilly, and the \"first wave\" of rock and roll (Sun Records session era Elvis Presley, Eddie Cochran etc.). This was just before the rockabilly revival, and the album was ignored as being 'retro'. Ignoring this, Godard then went further back in time, and subsequent releases (inc. \"Songs for Sale\" – still credited to Vic Godard \"and the Subway Sect\") showed the influence of the \"rat pack\" (Dean Martin, Frank Sinatra), and 1940s swing, many years before these sounds became fashionable again. Faced by dwindling sales and following a solo album (\"T.R.O.U.B.L.E.\") backed by Working Week, Godard left the music business and became a postman.\n\nIn 1982, former Subway Sect members – guitarist Rob Marche, keyboardist Dave Collard, bassist Chris Bostock and drummer Sean McLusky – teamed up with American singer, Dig Wayne and formed the band Jo Boxers.\n\nIn the 1990s a slow Godard revival began. Backed by the re-release of his work on CD and numerous compilation albums, Godard returned to recording, initially under his own name. In 2002, a CD was issued credited purely to Subway Sect, thus reviving the name, if not the original band. Named \"Sansend\", it was a sample and beats heavy collection of new songs, and it was followed three years later by Motion's \"Singles Anthology\", which collected single A and B sides.\n\nOriginal Subway Sect guitarist and bass player, Rob Symmons and Paul Myers resurfaced as The Fallen Leaves in 2004, although Myers has since quit the band. Rob Symmons still performs and records with the band.\n\nIn 2007, a new Subway Sect (featuring on some recordings original members Mark Laff and Paul Myers, as well as former Sex Pistols drummer Paul Cook) released \"1978 Now\", a re-make of the original 1978 album as, Godard indicated, it had originally sounded. In 2011, Myers rejoined Vic Godard and Subway Sect permanently; his first official gig back was at Nambucca in London on 28 October 2011. Further vintage material was recorded in 2012 – again with Paul Cook on drums – and released in 2014 as \"1979 Now\".\n\nAs of 2019, the current Subway Sect line-up of Godard and Johnny Britton with a returned Chris Bostock and Sean McLusky has a new album \"All These Moments\" due for release in 2020, produced by Mick Jones and previewed by single \"How High The Walls\" out on 25 December that year. \n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Urine was used in several ancient cultures for various health, healing, and cosmetic purposes; urine drinking is still practiced today, though there is no proven health benefit to it.

Urine is also consumed as a sexual activity.\n\nSurvival guides such as the \"US Army Field Manual\", The SAS Survival Handbook, and others generally advise \"against\" drinking urine for survival.

{"id": "1881556", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1881556", "title": "Item number", "text": "Item number\n\nIn Indian cinema, an item number or item song is a musical number inserted into a film that may or may not have any relevance to the plot. The term is commonly used within Indian films (Hindi, Kannada, Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam and Bengali) to describe a catchy, upbeat, often sexually provocative dance sequence for a song in a movie. The main aim of an item number is to entertain movie-goers and to lend support to the marketability of the film by being featured in trailers. They are favoured by filmmakers as they afford the opportunity pick potential hit songs from the stocks, since they do not add to the continuity of the plot. It is thus a vehicle for commercial success that ensures repeat viewing.\n\nA female actor, singer, or dancer, especially someone who is poised to become a star, who appears in an item number is known as an item girl (there are item boys as well). However, second-generation South Asian females are more commonly featured in item numbers than males. Item numbers usually feature one or more persons other than the lead actors. Sometimes, established female and male actors will appear in item numbers (a phenomenon billed as a \"special appearance\" by that actor).\n\nAlthough the origin of the term \"item number\" is obscure, it is likely that it derives its meaning from objectification of women. This is because \"item\" in Mumbai film slang is used by Indian men to objectify women. The classic meaning of item number refers to highly sexualized songs with racy imagery and suggestive lyrics. The item number would feature an item girl who appeared in the film as a dancer, usually in a bar or nightclub, and was only in the film for the duration of that song.\n\nUp to the 1970s, Bollywood often relied on a female \"vamp\" character – usually playing the role of a cabaret dancer, \"tawaif\"/prostitute/courtesan, or male gangster's moll – to provide musical entertainment deemed more risqué. While film heroines also sang and danced, it was the vamp who wore more revealing clothes, smoked, drank, and sang sexually suggestive lyrics. The vamp was portrayed as immodest rather than evil, and her dance performances were sexualized by male producers. The trend was started by Cuckoo in films like \"Awaara\" (1951), \"Aan\" (1952) and \"Shabistan\" (1951).\nItem numbers had been featured in Bollywood from as early as the 1930s. Azoorie in the 1930s often performed item numbers; Cuckoo was the next popular item dancer in the late 40s. Her banner year was 1949 when she was featured in over 17 films performing dances. Actress and classical dancer Vyjayanthimala was the one that introduced the classical dance number in Hindi films with her debut film \"Bahar\" (1951). The mixture of classical plus contemporary was popularized by Vyjayanthimala in films such as \"Devdas\" (1955), \"Amrapali\" (1966), \"Madhumati\" (1958), \"Sadhna\" (1958), Sunghursh (1968) etc.\n\nIn the early 50s, Cuckoo introduced the Anglo-Burmese Helen as a chorus girl. In time Helen would come to be the most popular vamp of the late-50s, 60s and 70s, having had performed in scores of item numbers including such popular songs as \"Mera Naam Chin Chin Choo\" from the film \"Howrah Bridge\" (1958), \"Piya Tu Ab To Aaja\" from \"Caravan\" (1971), \"Mehbooba Mehbooba\" from \"Sholay\" (1975) and \"Yeh Mera Dil\" from \"Don \" (1978). The song's tune was also used in Don't Phunk With My Heart, \"O Haseena Zulfon Wali\" from Teesri Manzil and \"Aa Jaane Jaan\". In films like \"Gunga Jumna\" and \"Zindagi\" the actor performed semi-classical Indian dances in songs like \"Tora man bada paapi\" and \"Ghungarwa mora chham chham baaje\". A \"desi\" bar number, \"Mungda\" from \"Inkaar\" was also immensely popular. In addition to her skillful dancing, her anglicised looks too helped further the vamp image. Helen's dominance pushed other vying item number dancers like Madhumati, Bela Bose, Laxmi Chhaya, Jeevankala, Aruna Irani, Sheela R. and Sujata Bakshi into the background and less prestigious and low budget b-movies.\n\nIn the early part of the 1970s actresses Jayshree T., Bindu, Aruna Irani and Padma Khanna entered into what was Helen's monopoly. Another noted feature of this era was the \"tribal and \"banjara\"\" item numbers such as the one in the Dharmendra, Zeenat Aman and Rex Harrison starer \"Shalimar\". Such songs provided the necessary settings for the lead couple's love to bloom.\n\nAround the 1980s the vamp and the heroine merged into one figure and the lead actress had begun to perform the bolder numbers. The craze for \"tribal and \"banjara\"\" item numbers were soon gave way to slick choreography. In the late 1990s, with the proliferation of film songs based television shows, film producers had come to realise that an exceptional way to entice audiences into theaters was by spending excessively on the visualization of songs. Hence regardless of the theme and plot, an elaborate song and dance routine involving spectacularly lavish sets, costumes, special effects, extras and dancers would invariably be featured in a film. It was asserted that this contributed highly to the film's \"repeat value\".\n\nMadhuri Dixit is often considered to be the pioneer of the modern trend. In the late 1980s, the song \"Ek Do Teen\" was added to the movie \"Tezaab\" as an afterthought, but it transformed Dixit and made her a superstar. Her partnership with choreographer Saroj Khan has resulted in numerous hits including the controversial \"Choli ke peeche kya hai\" and \"Dhak Dhak\" (\"Beta\"). Soon after the release of the film \"Khal Nayak\", there were press reports stating that people were seeing the film again and again but only for the song \"Choli Ke Peeche Kya Hai\" that featured Dixit.\n\nAlthough there have been many songs that fit the descriptions of item numbers in the early and mid-1990s, the term itself was coined when Shilpa Shetty danced for \"Main Aai Hoon UP Bihar Lootne\" in the movie \"Shool\". This is perhaps the first time the media actually referred to Shetty as an \"item girl\" and the scene as an \"item number\".\n\nSince 2000, many top Bollywood stars now do item numbers, and many new women entering Bollywood find item numbers a more amenable shortcut to success, as opposed to more traditional roles with no guarantee of eventual stardom. Former item girls in pop songs outside films, Rakhi Sawant and Meghna Naidu, for example, are now in demand and very popular. Today, they are even being given lead roles in movies. As of 2007, Mallika Sherawat had become the most expensive item girl, charging Rs.15 million (roughly US$375,000) for the song \"Mehbooba Mehbooba\" in \"Aap Ka Suroor - The Real Love Story\". Another example is actress Urmila Matondkar, one of the most successful item girls during that time. She was featured in \"Chamma Chamma\" in the 1998 film \"China Gate\". Baz Luhrmann's 2001 film musical, \"Moulin Rouge!\" used a westernized version of this song.\n\nMalaika Arora and Yana Gupta are \"official\" item number dancers and have said in interviews that they don't want to act in movies since they already earn more than enough money just by doing one item number as opposed to full-on roles.\n\nAbhishek Bachchan became the first \"item boy\" with his performance in \"Rakht\"; Shahrukh Khan performed an item number of sorts during the opening credits of \"Kaal\" but later had an item number in a truer sense of the word with \"Dard-e-Disco\" in \"Om Shanti Om\", where he was shot in a more typical \"item girl\" manner, with Khan wearing minimal clothing (though this number did have a connection, albeit tenuous, with the plot of the film). In \"Krazzy 4\", Hrithik Roshan has an item number during the end credits. Ranbir Kapoor made his debut in an item number in \"Chillar Party\" (2011); drawing inspiration from his father Rishi Kapoor's Qawwali song \"Parda Hai Parda\" from \"Amar Akbar Anthony\". In 2005 and 2006 actress Bipasha Basu gave blockbuster hit numbers like No Entry and Beedi Jalaile.\n\nIn the 2007 Telugu film \"Desamuduru\", the song \"Attaantode Ittaantode\" featuring Allu Arjun and Rambha became a chartbuster. In the 2007 film \"Om Shanti Om\", the song \"Deewangi Deewangi\" had guest appearances by over 30 Bollywood stars. In 2008, the makers of \"Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi\" featured Kajol, Bipasha Basu, Lara Dutta, Priety Zinta, and Rani Mukerji playing five leading ladies opposite Shahrukh Khan in the song \"Phir Milenge Chalte Chalte\".\n\nIn 2010, Katrina Kaif featured in \"Sheila Ki Jawani\" from \"Tees Maar Khan\", and Malaika Arora featured in \"Munni Badnaam Hui\" from \"Dabangg\". Parallels were drawn between Katrina and Malaika, as well as between the item numbers, in what was popularly known as the \"Munni vs Sheila\" debate. The songs became so popular, that, soon, more films began incorporating item numbers, and with more top stars now wanting to do them.\n\nIn 2012, Katrina Kaif again featured in an item number \"Chikni Chameli\" sung by Shreya Ghoshal which became a huge hit. In 2013, Deepika Padukone had some success item dancing, performing songs like \"Party On My Mind\" and \"Lovely\". Priyanka Chopra did many songs such as \"Babli Badmaash\", \"Pinky\", and an appearance in Sanjay Leela Bhansali's Goliyon Ki Raasleela Ram-Leela song \"Ram Chahe Leela\", of which became a blockbuster upon release. Mahi Gill, Sonakshi Sinha, and Jacqueline Fernandez made their debut with \"Don't Touch My Body\", \"Thank God It's Friday\" and \"Jadu Ki Jappi\" respectively.\n\nIndian-Canadian actress Sunny Leone performed her first item dance with \"\"Laila\"\" from the 2013 film \"Shootout at Wadala\", followed up with \"Baby Doll\" from Ragini MMS 2. Varun Dhawan made his debut with \"Palat - Tera Hero Idhar Hai\" from the movie Main Tera Hero. In 2017, Sunny Leone featured in the hit item number \"Laila Main Laila\" starring Shah Rukh Khan in the film \"Raees\". It is a recreation of the song \"Laila O Laila\" from the 1980 film \"Qurbani\", which featured actress Zeenat Aman with Feroz Khan in the original musical number.\n\nIn 2017, Anglo-Indian actress Amanda Rosario featured in the hit item number \"Sarkar\" sung by Rani Hazarika from the movie \"Udanchhoo\".\n\nIn 2018, Moroccan-Canadian dancer-actress Nora Fatehi featured in the item song \"Dilbar\" which has become one of the most popular Bollywood music videos of all time. It is a recreation of an item number of the same name from \"Sirf Tum\" (1999), which was composed by Nadeem–Shravan and featured Sushmita Sen as an item girl. The re-created version by Tanishk Bagchi features Middle-Eastern musical sounds. In the music video, Nora Fatehi performs belly dancing, an Arabic dance style that was previously featured in a number of popular Bollywood item numbers, performed by actresses such as Helen in \"Mehbooba O Mehbooba\" from \"Sholay\" (1975), Zeenat Aman in \"Raqqasa Mera Naam\" from \"The Great Gambler\" (1979), Mallika Sherawat in \"Mayya Mayya\" from \"Guru\" (2007), and Rani Mukerji in \"Aga Bai\" from \"Aiyyaa\" (2012). TV and Bollywood Actress Mouni Roy made her debut by \"Nachna Aunda Nahi\". The \"Gali Gali\" track sung by Neha Kakkar, which featured Mouni Roy also, was a huge hit. The international success of \"Dilbar\" inspired an Arabic-language version, also featuring Nora Fatehi. \"Dilbar\" is popular across Southern Asia and the Arab world, with all versions of the song having received more than 1billion views on YouTube, making it the most-viewed song on the T-Series YouTube channel.\n\nItem numbers have been criticized for their gratuitous objectification of women. Item numbers have also been imitated by Mumbai's bar dancers. In respect of the ban on bar dancers in Mumbai, it has even been argued that the morality of bar dancer's imitation of item numbers cannot be questioned without questioning the morality of screening of item numbers in a film in public theatres. It has also been argued that the two are equally amoral as both objectify women for commercial gain, with likely negative effects on the male population.\n\nIn 1993, the Bollywood action thriller \"Khalnayak\" was instantly controversial for its item numbers and risqué song lyrics. While the lyrics of \"Choli Ke Peechhe?\" (\"What's behind the blouse?\") were considered vulgar by some, others defended the song on the ground that it was based on folk traditions. The song eventually set off protests all over the country and a potential ban on the song was debated in the Indian Parliament. The anger and commotion, however, only helped the song and the film become more popular, as many went to the movie theater out of curiosity, to watch Madhuri Dixit perform the song.\n\nIn 2013, the Central Board of Film Certification issued a resolution declaring that item numbers will now be rated as adult content and will be banned from being shown on television channels.\n\n"}

The gorge is approximately 1.5 km long, 60 m deep, and 10 m wide at its lip. The Abhainn Droma flows through Corrieshalloch, below which the landscape opens out into a broad, flat-bottomed glacial trough at the head of Loch Broom.\n\nThe 46 metre-high Falls of Measach (Gaelic: Easan na Miasaich, meaning \"waterfalls of the place of platters\", with reference to the pot-holes worn by the action of the water) can be viewed from a viewing platform and a Victorian suspension footbridge. The gorge has been owned since 1945 by the National Trust for Scotland who manage it and the surrounding area jointly with Scottish Natural Heritage.\n\nCorrieshalloch Gorge is one of the most spectacular gorges in Scotland, and demonstrates how erosion resulting from the rapid melting of glaciers at lead to the formation of deep gorges. The gorge formed at the end of the Quaternary ice age around 10-13,000 years, as the meltwater from ice sheets that covered northern Scotland between 2.6 million and 11,500 years ago exploited existing lines of weakness in the Moine bedrock.\n\nA 25 m long footbridge spans the gorge below the falls. The bridge was constructed by Sir John Fowler, who was also one of the designers of the Forth Bridge. Access to the footbridge is via a 300-metre-long path from the car park on the South side of the gorge. There is a charge of £2 payable using an honesty box at the start of the path. A viewing platform has been installed which projects out into the gorge.\n\nThe bridge was closed to the public in 2010 following the discovery of unacceptable wear and tear, but was reopened in January 2011 after temporary repair work. It was closed again in the winter of 2011/12 for longer term repairs. Shortly before it was due to be reopened in April 2012, consulting engineers discovered cracks in several deck support hangers, and the entire site, including gorge-side paths, was closed until these could be replaced. It fully re-opened in late May 2012 after refurbishment and repairs were completed, however as of 2018 the Trust recommend that no more than 6 people use the bridge at any one time.\n\nThe gorge provides a habitat for plants that have largely disappeared from the surrounding areas due to grazing pressures. The dark, humid walls of the gorge support ferns, feather mosses and sanicle; wood millet, a plant otherwise rare in northwest Scotland. Higher up, the more sunlit slopes support trees such as wych elm, birch, sycamore, Norway maple and beech.\n\nThe wooded parts of the gorge support a population of the cranefly species \"Lipsothrix ecucullata\", which is nationally rare. The larvae of this species inhabit wet, decayed wood, whilst the mature adults inhabit damp deciduous woodlands.\n\nCorrieshalloch Gorge is a national nature reserve (NNR) and a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). The Corrieshalloch Gorge NNR is classified as a Category III protected area by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. It is the smallest of Scotland's 43 NNRs.\n"}

After the original wooden structure of the Rialto Bridge had collapsed repeatedly, it was decided that a stone bridge was necessary. Between 1588 and 1591 da Ponte rebuilt the Rialto Bridge to a design to which he had contributed.\n\nThe design was selected in a contest held by the local authorities under Doge of Venice Pasquale Cicogna. Though Da Ponte is relatively unknown otherwise, the design for the Venice landmark defeated submissions by noted architects of the time, including Michelangelo.\nPlans were offered by famous architects such as Jacopo Sansovino, Andrea Palladio and Giacomo Barozzi da Vignola, but all involved a Classical approach with several arches, which was judged inappropriate to the situation.\n\nThe engineering of the bridge throws considerable weight on its foundations. It was considered so audacious that architect Vincenzo Scamozzi predicted future ruin. However the bridge has defied its critics to become one of the architectural icons of Venice.\n\nIn the construction of this work Antonio was helped by his nephew Antonio Contino, who would also later design the famous Bridge of Sighs (Ponte dei Sospiri).

Tynwald Day attracts thousands of spectators to watch the ceremony and participate in the Tynwald Fair.\n\nTynwald Day, July 5, corresponded to St John's feast day by the Julian calendar, which was the date held to be midsummer day; so Tynwald Day was a midsummer fair.\n\nThe Anglican church in the village is dedicated to St John and the village takes its name from the church. Within the church are reserved seats with name plaques for members of both branches of the Manx parliament, whilst in the adjacent church hall is an exhibition detailing the history of Tynwald.\n\nThe village is dominated by , a steep hill to its south. The Tynwald National Park (also known as the Arboretum) is situated on the east side of the village.\n\nOpposite the church is the site of the ancient pound where stray animals were placed until claimed. If unclaimed after a year and a day they became the property of the Lord of Mann, whilst the recovery fee for reclaimed animals was shared equally between the Lord of Mann and the pound official, the \"pindar\". Also displayed on that site are large stones from a 2300 BC burial chamber found locally.\n\nThe main commercial venture of the village is Tynwald Mills, which claims to be the only department store in the island.\n\nThe village is on the A1 Douglas to Peel road. It is also close to the junction with the A3, which leads in a southerly direction to Foxdale and Castletown, and northerly to Kirk Michael, Ballaugh, Sulby and Ramsey. It is thus conveniently located for access from all parts of the island (even before these roads were built), which is believed to have been a consideration in the original location of Tynwald here.\n\nThe village's railway station has long since closed. In its day it was a major railway junction, in the context of the Isle of Man: it was on the Isle of Man Railway (Peel line), the Manx Northern Railway and the Foxdale Railway. The trackbed of the Isle of Man Railway is now used as a footpath, named the Steam Heritage Trail.\n\nSince 2003, the former St John's School building has been used by the (the Manx language primary school).\n"}

He is known for his appearances with Eastern/Extreme Championship Wrestling, World Championship Wrestling and the World Wrestling Federation as one-half of the tag team The Public Enemy with Rocco Rock. In the course of his career, Grunge held championships such as the ECW World Tag Team Championship and WCW World Tag Team Championship.\n\nGrunge debuted in 1987.\n\nIn 1993 in Woodbridge, New Jersey, Grunge formed a tag team in the UWF with Rocco Rock known as The Public Enemy. This was not the first time they had met though as The Public Enemy faced one another in Austria circa 1991, with Grunge (using the name \"Johnny Rotten\") losing to Rock (using the name \"Cheetah Kid\" and was masked).\n\nIn 1993, The Public Enemy joined Eastern Championship Wrestling, a Philadelphia, Pennsylvania-based promotion soon to be renamed Extreme Championship Wrestling. Between March 6, 1994 and October 28, 1995, The Public Enemy held the ECW Tag Team Championship on four occasions. While in ECW, they were involved in two infamous incidents - the first when the ECW audience hurled folding chairs into the ring until The Public Enemy (both \"unconscious\") were submerged, and the second when the ECW audience invaded the ring to celebrate with The Public Enemy, with the ring collapsing as a result of the additional weight. They were known for their hardcore wrestling style and usage of tables, a gimmick that was later adopted by the Dudley Boyz.\n\nThe Public Enemy's wrestling style was referenced in Weezer's song \"El Scorcho\"; the line \"watchin' Grunge legdrop New Jack through a press table\" was derived from a caption for a photograph of Grunge fighting wrestler New Jack that was published in \"Pro Wrestling Illustrated\".\n\nIn 1996, The Public Enemy joined the Atlanta, Georgia based World Championship Wrestling promotion. They debuted on January 15, 1996, defeating The American Males. On September 23, 1996 in Birmingham, Alabama, The Public Enemy defeated Harlem Heat to win the WCW World Tag Team Championship. Harlem Heat regained the titles on October 1, 1996 in Canton, Ohio.\n\nThe Public Enemy left WCW in 1999, and briefly wrestled for ECW before joining the World Wrestling Federation. Both men made their debut on the February 22, 1999 episode of \"Raw is War\", but were released from the WWF two months later. On July 18 at Bash at the Beach 1999, The Public Enemy returned to WCW and took part in the \"Junkyard Invitational\".\n\nThey then returned to the independent circuit, making appearances with the X Wrestling Federation as The South Philly Posse, where they were managed by Jasmin St. Claire. In the early 2000s, Public Enemy performed for the short-lived i-Generation Superstars of Wrestling among other independent promotions. The team won various independent tag team titles.\n\nFollowing the death of Rocco Rock in 2002, Grunge teamed with his kayfabe brother Joey Grunge as The New Public Enemy throughout August 2003. He also made appearances with Pro-Pain Pro Wrestling (3PW), and participated in a memorial segment for deceased ECW wrestlers at \"Hardcore Homecoming\" on June 10, 2005.\n\nAt the end of 2005, Grunge was preparing for a comeback. His cousin, Jason Ray, who wrestled for Big Japan Wrestling, helped book him for BJW's upcoming spring tour.\n\nGrunge was a neighbor of Chris Benoit and helped Benoit cope with Eddie Guerrero's death in November 2005.\n\nGrunge died at the age of 39 on February 16, 2006 in his residence in Peachtree City, Georgia as a result of sleep apnea complications.\n\n\n\n"}

In the Kabbalah, \"Chokhmah\" is the uppermost of the sephirot of the right line (\"kav yamin\", the \"Pillar of Mercy\") in the Tree of Life. \nIt is to the bottom right of Keter, with Binah across from it. Under it are the \"sephirot\" of Chesed and Netzach. It commonly has four paths going to Keter, Binah, Tifereth, and Chesed. (Some kabbalists attribute a path between Chokhmah and Gevurah.)\n\nProverbs personifies Divine Wisdom, which existed before the world was made, revealed God, and acted as God's agent in creation ( cf. 3:19; ; ). Wisdom dwelt with God (; cf. ; ) and being the exclusive property of God was as such inaccessible to human beings (). It was God who \"found\" wisdom () and gave her to Israel: \"He hath found out all the way of knowledge, and hath given it unto Jacob his servant, and to Israel his beloved. Afterward did he shew himself upon earth, and conversed with men.\" (; ). \n\nAs a female figure (Sir. 1:15; Wis. 7:12), wisdom addressed human beings (Prov. 1:20–33; 8:1–9:6) inviting to her feast those who are not yet wise (Prov. 9:1-6). \nWisdom 7:22b-8:1 is a famous passage describing Divine Wisdom, including the passage:\n\"For she is the breath of the power of God, and a pure influence flowing from the glory of the Almighty: therefore can no defiled thing fall into her. For she is the brightness of the everlasting light, the unspotted mirror of the power of God, and the image of his goodness. And being but one, she can do all things: and remaining in herself, she maketh all things new: and in all ages entering into holy souls, she maketh them friends of God, and prophets.\" (). \nSolomon, as the archetypal wise person, fell in love with Wisdom: \"I loved her, and sought her out from my youth, I desired to make her my spouse, and I was a lover of her beauty.\" ().\n\nAccording to the Bahir: \"The second (utterance) is wisdom, as is written: 'Y-H-W-H acquired me at the beginning of His way, before His deeds of old' (Prov 8:22). And there is no 'beginning' but wisdom.\"\n\nChokhmah, the second of the ten sefirot, is the first power of conscious intellect within Creation, and the first point of 'real' existence, since Keter represents emptiness. According to the book of Job, \"Wisdom comes from nothingness\". This point is both infinitely small, and yet encompasses the whole of being, but it remains incomprehensible until it is given shape and form in Binah.\n\nThe name of God associated with Chokhmah is Yah.\n\nChokhmah appears in the configuration of the \"sefirot\" at the top of the right axis, and corresponds in the \"tzelem Elokim\" (\"the Divine image\") to the left eye, or right hemisphere of the brain.\n\nIn its fully articulated form, Chokhmah possesses two \"partzufim\" (\"faces\" or \"features\"): the higher of these is referred to as \"Abba Ila'ah\" (\"the higher father\"), whereas the lower is referred to as Yisrael Saba (\"Israel, the Elder\"). These two \"partzufim\" are referred to jointly as \"Abba\" (\"father\").\n\nChokhmah is associated in the soul with the power of intuitive insight, flashing lightning-like across consciousness. The \"partzuf\" of \"Abba Ila'ah\" is associated with the power to spontaneously extract such insight from the superconscious realm, whereas the \"partzuf\" of \"Yisrael Saba\" is associated with the power to subsequently direct it into consciousness.\n\nThe \"wisdom\" of Chokhmah also implies the ability to look deeply at some aspect of reality and abstract its conceptual essence till one succeeds in uncovering its underlying axiomatic truth. These seeds of truth can then be conveyed to the companion power of Binah for the sake of intellectual analysis and development.\n\nChokhmah is the primary (\"beginning\") force in the creative process, Creativity, as it is said: \"You have made them all with Chokhmah.\" (Psalms 104:24) The first word of the Torah in Genesis, \"Breishit\" means \"In the beginning (God created the heavens and the earth)\", is translated (Targum Yonatan) as \"With Chokhmah (God created…).\"\n\nChokhmah is also called Fear, 'because it has no measure of boundary, and therefore the mind does not have the power to grasp it'. The book of Job states 'Behold the fear of God is wisdom, and to depart from evil is understanding' (Job 28:28).\n\nIn the array of sefirot in three columns (\"gimel kavim\"), Chokmah is situated at the top of the right column, and corresponds to the right hemisphere of the brain. There are several aspects of Chokhmah:\n\nThe word Chokhmah itself may be broken into two words -- \"koach\" (\"potential\") and \"ma\" (\"what is\"). Thus, Chokhmah means \"the potential of what is\", or, \"the potential to be.\" This aspect of Chokhmah describes the state of Chokhmah in relation to the sefira of Keter. As Chokhmah emanates from Keter, the first dawning of the \"Infinite Light\", it \"appears\" in an obscure and undefined state that is a virtual non-being. Thus the verse states, \"and Chokhmah emerges from nothingness\" (Job 28:12, see Zohar II, 121a, Zohar III, 290a, commentaries). The light of the Ein Sof becomes unified in the world of \"Atziluth\" through clothing itself first in the sefira of Chokhmah. In the soul, Chokhmah is associated with the power of intuitive insight.\n\nIn the Zohar Chokhmah is the primordial point which shines forth from the will of God and thus, is the starting point of Creation. All things are still undifferentiated at this point and only become intelligible at Binah.\nAccording to the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, the name of God associated with Chokmah is Jehovah, the archangel that presides over it is Raziel, the order of angels that reside in it are the Ophanim (the wheels), the Heaven of Assiah associated with it is called Mazloth, implying the fulfillment of destiny, and the mundane chakra associated with it is the Zodiac.\n\nIn Aleister Crowley's \"Liber 777\", Chokhma is represented as The Four twos of the Tarot, Illuminating, Thoth, Vishnu, Joy, Odin, Uranus, Athena, God the Father, Man, Amaranth, Lingam, Hashish, Phosphorus, Musk, and Yang (not a complete list).\n\n\n\n"}

Manus was first bombed by the Japanese on 25 January 1942, the radio mast being the main target. On 8 April 1942 an Imperial Japanese force consisting of the light cruiser \"Tatsuta\", destroyer \"Mutsuki\" and a troop transport ship \"Mishima Maru\" entered Lorengau harbour, and several hundreds of Japanese soldiers of the 8th Special Base Force, swarmed ashore onto Australia's mandated responsibility. With little and limited resources the Australian 4th section withdrew to the jungle. The Japanese established an administrative base and airstrip. In February 1944 the United States and Australian forces launched a six-week campaign to recapture the facility, which was eventually achieved on 18 March 1944.\n\nThe Americans expanded the Japanese base and constructed a huge naval base at nearby Lombrum. An airstrip capable of handling heavy bombers was constructed at Momote and it was here that the invasion to capture the Philippines was staged.\n\nAfter the war the base was scrapped and all equipment was bulldozed into pits or the harbour.\n\nIn 2017 Manus Regional Processing Centre was closed and the hundreds of refugees and asylum seekers who were indefinitely detained there by the Australian Government were moved, many by force, to three new centres in/near Lorengau.

It has been described as \"the most lethal jellyfish in the world\", with at least 63 known deaths in Australia from 1884 to 1996.\n\nNotorious for its sting, \"C. fleckeri\" has tentacles up to long covered with millions of cnidocytes which, on contact, release microscopic darts delivering an extremely powerful venom. Being stung commonly results in excruciating pain, and if the sting area is significant, an untreated victim may die in two to five minutes. The amount of venom in one animal is said to be enough to kill 60 adult humans, \"Cnidaria Envenomation.\" eMedicine.</ref>\n\n\"Chironex fleckeri\" was named after North Queensland toxicologist and radiologist Doctor Hugo Flecker. \"On January 20, 1955, when a 5-year-old boy died after being stung in shallow water at Cardwell, North Queensland, Flecker found three types of jellyfish. One was an unidentified box-shaped jellyfish with groups of tentacles arising from each corner. Flecker sent it to Dr Ronald Southcott in Adelaide, and on December 29, 1955, Southcott published his article introducing it as a new genus and species of lethal box jellyfish. He named it \"Chironex fleckeri\", the name being derived from the Greek \"cheiro\" meaning \"hand\", the Latin \"nex\" meaning \"murderer\", and \"fleckeri\" in honour of its discoverer.\"\n\n\"Chironex fleckeri\" is the largest of the cubozoans (collectively called box jellyfish), many of which may carry similarly toxic venom. Its bell grows to about the size of a basketball. From each of the four corners of the bell trails a cluster of 15 tentacles. The pale blue bell has faint markings; viewed from certain angles, it bears a somewhat eerie resemblance to a human head or skull. Since it is virtually transparent, the creature is nearly impossible to see in its habitat, posing particular danger to swimmers.\n\nWhen the jellyfish are swimming, the tentacles contract so they are about 15 cm long and about 5 mm in diameter; when they are hunting, the tentacles are thinner and extend to about 3 m long. The tentacles are covered with a high concentration of stinging cells called cnidocytes, which are activated by pressure and a chemical trigger; they react to proteinous chemicals. Box jellyfish are day hunters; at night they are seen resting on the ocean floor.\n\nIn common with other box jellyfish, \"C. fleckeri\" has four eye-clusters with 24 eyes. Some of these eyes seem capable of forming images, but whether they exhibit any object recognition or object tracking is debated; it is also unknown how they process information from their sense of touch and eye-like light-detecting structures due to their lack of a central nervous system. During a series of tests by marine biologists including Australian jellyfish expert Jamie Seymour, a single jellyfish was put in a tank. Then, two white poles were lowered into the tank. The creature appeared unable to see them and swam straight into them, thus knocking them over. Then, similar black poles were placed into the tank. This time, the jellyfish seemed aware of them, and swam around them in a figure-eight. Finally, to see if the specimen could see colour, a single red pole was stood in the tank. When the jellyfish apparently became aware of the object in its tank, it was seemingly repelled by it and remained at the far edge of the tank. Following these experiments, the Australian researchers put forward the idea of red safety nets for beaches (these nets are usually used to keep the jellyfish away, but many still get through its mesh). The test was repeated, with similar results, on Irukandji jellyfish, another toxic species of box jelly.\n\n\"Chironex fleckeri\" lives on a diet of prawns and small fish, and are prey to turtles, whose thick skin is impenetrable to the cnidocytes of the jellyfish.\n\nThe medusa is pelagic and has been documented from coastal waters of Australia and New Guinea north to the Philippines and Vietnam. In Australia, it is known from the northern coasts from Exmouth to Agnes Water, but its full distribution outside Australia has not been properly identified. To further confuse, the closely related and also dangerously venomous \"Chironex yamaguchii\" was first described from Japan in 2009. This species has also been documented from the Philippines, meaning the non-Australian records of \"C. fleckeri\" need to be rechecked. Breeding occurs in lower levels of rivers and mangrove channels.\n\"Chironex fleckeri\" is best known for its extremely powerful and occasionally fatal \"sting\". The sting can produce an excruciating pain accompanied by an intense burning sensation, like being branded with a red hot iron. In Australia, fatalities are most often caused by the larger specimens of \"C. fleckeri\".\n\nIn Australia, \"C. fleckeri\" has caused at least 64 deaths since the first report in 1883, but most encounters appear to result only in mild envenomation. Among 225 analyzed \"C. fleckeri\" stings in Australia's Top End from 1991 to 2004, only 8% required hospital admission, 5% received antivenom and there was a single fatality (a 3-year-old child). 26% experienced severe pain, while it was moderate to none in the remaining. Most deaths in recent decades have been children, as their smaller body mass puts them at a higher risk of fatal envenomation. When people do die, it is usually caused by a cardiac arrest occurring within minutes of the sting.\n\nResearchers at the University of Hawaii's Department of Tropical Medicine have found that the venom causes cells to become porous enough to allow potassium leakage, causing hyperkalemia which can lead to cardiovascular collapse and death as quickly as within two to five minutes with an LD50 of 0.04 mg/kg, making it the most venomous jellyfish in the world (to laboratory mice). It was postulated that a zinc compound may be developed as an antidote. Occasionally, swimmers who get stung will undergo cardiac arrest or drown before they can even get back to the shore or boat.\n\n\"Chironex fleckeri\" and other jellyfish, including the Irukandji (\"Carukia barnesi\"), are abundant in the waters of northern Australia during the summer months (November to April or May). They are believed to drift into the aforementioned estuaries to breed. Signs like the one pictured are erected along the coast of North Queensland to warn people of such, and few people swim during this period. Some people still do, however, putting themselves at great risk. At popular swimming spots, net enclosures are placed out in the water wherein people can swim but jellyfish cannot get in, keeping swimmers safe.\n\nUntil 2005, treatment involved using pressure immobilisation bandages, with the aim of preventing distribution of the venom through the lymph and blood circulatory systems. This treatment is no longer recommended by health authorities, due to research which showed that using bandages to achieve tissue compression provoked nematocyst discharge.\n\nThe application of vinegar is recommended treatment because vinegar (4–6% acetic acid) permanently deactivates undischarged nematocysts, preventing them from opening and releasing venom. A 2014 study demonstrated in vitro that while vinegar deactivates unfired nematocysts, there was also an increase in venom concentration in the solution, possibly by causing already-fired nematocysts (which still contain some venom) to release what remained. However, this study has been criticized on several methodological grounds, including that the experiment was done using a model membrane that is much different from (and more simple than) human skin. Also, the researchers did not determine whether the increase in venom concentration was caused by already-discharged nematocysts releasing more venom, or if the venom that was released initially had simply leaked back out through the membrane, thus confounding the concentration measurement. Despite these concerns, diluted acetic acid is still the recommended treatment.\n\n"}

The village is about southeast of Swindon town centre. The settlement along the High Street is Lower Wanborough, while Upper Wanborough is on higher ground to the southwest. The parish includes the hamlets of Horpit (a short distance north of Wanborough) and Foxhill, to the southeast.\n\nThere was a Roman settlement, Durocornovium, slightly northwest of the current village, at a road junction mentioned in the Antonine Itinerary. Being the last \"vicus\" on Ermin Way or Ermin Street before the scarp slope of the Marlborough Downs, Durocornovium was a site where horses were watered before the steep climb off the Oxfordshire plain. Wanborough is just off the Ridgeway National Trail. Development in a strip along the road frontages characterised the village, which reached maximum development in the 4th century.\n\nIn three charters of the ninth century Wanborough is recorded as \"Wenbeorg\". In the Domesday Book it is \"Wemberge\", the 'm' being an evident mistake for 'n'.\n\nThe \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\" records that a battle was fought in 592 AD between Ceawlin, King of Wessex and the Britons, at a place called \"Woddesbeorge\" or \"Wodnesbeorge\", (\"Woden's borough\"). This has given rise to considerable speculation as to whether the battle took place at Wanborough in Wessex, or in Staffordshire at Wednesbury (\"Wodnesbeorge\", or \"Woden's borough\").\n\nThe antiquarian and historian W. H. Duignan stated in 1902: \"Now it is impossible it can be Wanborough [...] 'Wen' [in \"Wenbeorg\"], in the ninth century, could not represent an original Woden. There is only one Wednesbury in England[...]and I suggest that the \"Woddesbeorge\" of three versions of the Chronicle is an error for \"Wodnesbeorge\".\" Modern place-name scholarship tends to agree that the battle took place at Wednesbury.\n\nThe Church of England parish church of Saint Andrew is unusual in having a spire at one end and a tower at the other. There are only three parish churches with this feature in the UK. The others are at nearby Purton and at Ormskirk, Lancashire.\n\nThe village has a primary school and a small post office. The village has five public houses: The Brewers Arms; The New Calley Arms; The Cross Keys; The Harrow; and The Plough. There was also a sixth pub called The Black Horse which closed down early in 2012.\n\nFoxhill had one public house, The Shepherd's Rest which has re-opened as a restaurant serving Indian cuisine and renamed \"The Burj\".\n\nThere is a monthly farmers market in the village hall on the 3rd Saturday of every month, except August where is replaced by the Wanborough Show\n\nRedlands Airfield is a base for microlight aviation and skydiving parachute training.\n\nJames White (1877 – 1927), a financier, property developer, racehorse owner and speculator lived in Foxhill.

This short distance also appears on the electoral map, with each party winning eleven of the 22 districts, while the PS won the most populous, Lisbon and Porto. As a result, the Social Democrats fail to win the absolute majority they had between 1987 and 1995.\n\nAs no Party got an absolute majority, the Social Democrats formed a coalition with the right-wing People's Party. The left-wing Democratic Unity Coalition achieved the lowest result ever, finishing in the third place in its traditional strongholds, Évora and Setúbal. The Left Bloc gained one MP. Turnout was slightly higher than it was in 1999 but remained quite low, marking a growing separation between the politics and the Portuguese people, mainly due to the image of the politicians as corrupts and the idea that all the parties are the same.\n\nVoter turnout was slightly higher than in 1999, as 61.5% of the electorate cast a ballot.\n\nThe Assembly of the Republic has 230 members elected to four-year terms. Governments do not require absolute majority support of the Assembly to hold office, as even if the number of opposers of government is larger than that of the supporters, the number of opposers still needs to be equal or greater than 116 (absolute majority) for both the Government's Programme to be rejected or for a motion of no confidence to be approved.\n\nThe number of seats assigned to each district depends on the district magnitude. The use of the d'Hondt method makes for a higher effective threshold than certain other allocation methods such as the Hare quota or Sainte-Laguë method, which are more generous to small parties.\n\nThe major parties involved and the respective leaders were:\n\n\nJosé Manuel Durão Barroso, leader of the Social Democratic Party, was nominated Prime Minister and formed a coalition government with the People's Party.\n\nThe following table shows the opinion polls of voting intention of the Portuguese voters before the election.

{"id": "1881647", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1881647", "title": "Kaiser-Frazer", "text": "Kaiser-Frazer\n\nThe Kaiser-Frazer Corporation (1947–1951 as Kaiser-Frazer) was the result of a partnership between automobile executive Joseph W. Frazer and industrialist Henry J. Kaiser. In 1947, the company acquired the automotive assets of Graham-Paige, of which Frazer had become president near the end of World War II. Kaiser-Frazer was the only new US automaker to achieve success after World War II, if only for a few years. When Frazer left in 1951, the company renamed itself the Kaiser Motors Corporation and continued until 1955.\n\nThe company was founded on July 25, 1945 and in 1946 K-F displayed prototypes of their two new cars at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in New York City. The Kaiser was of an advanced front wheel drive design while the Frazer was an upscale conventional rear wheel drive car. The production costs and the limited time available prevented the front wheel drive design from entering production, so the new 1947 Kaiser and Frazer shared bodies and powertrains. Being some of the first newly designed cars on the market while the \"Big Three\" were still marketing their pre-war designs, the Kaisers and Frazers made an exciting entrance. Kaiser and Frazer continued to share bodies and engines through 1950 with different exterior and interior trim.\nHenry Kaiser had no automotive marketing experience; Joseph Frazer did, having held various positions with Packard, GM, Chrysler, and Willys-Overland. Kaiser believed in pressing forward in the face of adversity, while Frazer was more pragmatic. As the market for Kaiser-Frazer products slowed in 1949 with the introduction of new designs from the Big Three, Kaiser pushed for more production, creating an oversupply of cars that took until mid-1950 to sell. Kaiser and Frazer had repeated disagreements on how aggressive production should be until, finally, Joseph Frazer left the company in 1951 and the Frazer nameplate was dropped after a short 10,000 unit production run in 1951 that used up the remaining inventory of the 1949-50 bodies. \n\nIn 1952, the Kaiser-Frazer Corporation was renamed Kaiser Motors Corporation and continued building passenger cars through 1955.\n\nIn 1953 Kaiser bought the ailing Willys-Overland company for US$63,381,175 and merged the Kaiser and Willys operations under the name Kaiser-Willys Corporation. The decision was then made to exit the passenger car market, which was accomplished at the end of the 1955 model year. \n\nBy 1956, Willys Motors built only utility vehicles, many for export, and was turning a healthy profit.\n\nIn 1970, the Kaiser Jeep Corporation, as the company had been renamed in 1963, was sold to American Motors Corporation.\n\nProduction of Kaiser-Frazer models was centered at Willow Run, Michigan. Willow Run, the largest building in the world at that time, was built by the U.S. government just prior to World War II for Henry Ford to build B-24 Liberator bombers. Once the war ended, Ford had no interest in the facility, and the War Assets Administration began a search for someone to lease or buy the building. When K-F expressed interest in the facility, the WAA offered them an attractive five-year lease rate. K-F also had manufacturing facilities in Jefferson MI; Long Beach CA; Portland OR; Leaside, Ontario, Canada; Haifa, Israel; Kawasaki, Japan; Mexico City and Rotterdam (known as \"Nekaf\", for Nederlandse Kaiser-Frazer fabrieken). U.S. production was concentrated at Toledo, Ohio, upon the purchase of Willys-Overland starting in 1953; the Willow Run facility was sold to General Motors after GM suffered a disastrous fire at their Livonia, Michigan, Hydramatic automatic transmission plant and needed a facility quickly to resume production.\n\nKaiser includes Custom, Deluxe, Virginian, Carolina and Manhattan sedans, as well as the Traveler 4 door hatchback utility sedan. First post-war production car to offer supercharging (the 1954 Kaiser Manhattan).\n\nHenry J, a small economy car including Corsair and Vagabond.\n\nDarrin, the first production fiberglass sports car in the United States, beating Corvette to market by one month.\n\nFrazer includes Standard, Deluxe and Manhattan sedans and the Vagabond hatchback. The 1951 Frazer Manhattan convertible was the last four-door American convertible until the 1961 Lincoln Continental. Early production 1947 Frazers were marketed and identified as a Graham-Paige product.\n\nWillys, including \"Aero-Willys\" and all sub-trim levels include Aero-Lark, Aero Ace.\n\nJeep, including pick-ups, CJ Vehicles, all steel wagons, Wagoneer and Jeepster models.\n\nAllstate, designed to sell through Sears-Roebuck department stores in the southern United States, was a slightly restyled Henry J. The cars were equipped with Allstate products (tires, battery, etc.). The modest styling changes distinguishing the Allstate from the Henry J were executed by Alex Tremulis, stylist of the 1948 Tucker Sedan.\n\nIn 1951 Argentina sent their emissary, Brigadier General Juan Ignacio San Martín, to the US to convince an auto manufacturer to build cars in Argentina. In 1954 Kaiser was the only one to accept the offer, with the remainder believing the market was too small to justify the investment. Also, they did not have the rugged products Kaiser did. On January 19, 1955 Kaiser and the government of Argentina signed an agreement to permit Kaiser to manufacture automobiles and trucks in Argentina. In February, Kaiser created a wholly owned subsidiary named Kaiser Automotores, the holding company which in turn owned part of the newly created Industrias Kaiser Argentina S.A. (IKA), the manufacturing and marketing arm. Other partners in IKA included the government-owned vehicle manufacturer Industrias Aeronáuticas y Mecánicas del Estado (IAME) and private investors. In August Kaiser applied for and received an import license to bring in 1,021 completed cars, manufacturing equipment and spare parts from the US. Groundbreaking for the new factory was in March 1955 with the first Jeep vehicle rolling out of the plant on 27 April 1956.\nThe new Argentine factory was built in the city of Santa Isabel in the province of Córdoba with the Kaiser Manhattan being rechristened the \"Kaiser Carabela\" — named after a type of Portuguese sailing ship. The US vinyl and fabric interior was replaced with a more rugged leather interior, the speedometer was recalibrated in kilometers with the temperature, oil, and fuel gauge annotations in Spanish and the spring rates were increased to accommodate unimproved Argentine roads. Oddly, the dash castings with annotations for vent, heater, headlight and wiper controls remained in English. No consideration was given to offering an automatic transmission due to the anticipated difficulty in obtaining service in remote towns. Production started on the Carabela on 25 July 1958 and, in the remaining months of that year, 2,158 cars were built. IKA was also building Jeep vehicles at the Cordoba factory and assembled 20,454 Jeeps in 1958 alone. The combined Carabela-Jeep production of 22,612 units was 81% of all vehicles manufactured in Argentina in 1958 with the only competition being the state-run utility vehicle manufacturer IAME. Many have questioned the wisdom of building IKA automobile factory in remote Santa Isabel which was far from ports and transportation hubs but the primary reason is that Córdoba was General San Martín's home province and he had a close, influential relationship with President Juan Perón.\n\nIn 1962 the Carabela, the \"Gran coche argentino\" (the Great Argentine Car), ended production with some 15,000 cars assembled providing elegant transportation for the doctors, bankers and other notables in Argentina. The Carabela had some stable mates in 1960-62 in the form of an Alfa Romeo 1900 sedan derivative named the Bergantin (another type of Spanish sailing ship) and an Argentine-manufactured Renault Dauphine (badged IKA Dauphine). In 1962 Rambler variants licensed from AMC would replace all of these. The final form of the AMC variants was the potent Torino which saw a lot of racing on international circuits. Built until the early 1980s, the Torino was based on the 1964 Rambler American 2-door hardtop and 4-door sedan, but had its own engine, front and rear end styling, and a more European-styled interior. In 1970 Kaiser sold IKA to Renault.\n\nWith the founding of the State of Israel in 1948, the Ford Motor Company sought to invest in the new state, and to facilitate the production of a large number of vehicles Israel would need for the military and the government. Ford announced plans to build an assembly plant in Israel.\n\nWhen Arab nations got word of Ford’s plans, they announced that if Ford didn't cancel the agreement, they’d boycott it by putting the company on the Arab League’s blacklist.\n\nFord pulled out causing a moment of crisis for the Israeli government. While the government was searching for alternatives, Lord Marcus Sieff of London, contacted Efraim Ilin, an Israeli security expert and tycoon, and put him in contact with Hickman Price of Kaiser-Frazer. The company had recently built an automobile plant in Holland, and were planning to build one in Greece. Ilin met Price and negotiated a $2.5 million project. Kaiser-Frazer invested half a million dollars, and Ilin formed a group that invested the other two million dollars.\n\nKaiser production began in Israel in 1951. By 1956, Kaiser-Frazer was responsible for 28% of Israeli exports.\n\nThe factory built Kaiser-Frazer products, along with Mack trucks, under license. By the end of the 1950s, the operation was known as Kaiser-Ilin, named after Efraim Ilin, the Israeli entrepreneur who had negotiated the Haifa plant deal with Hickman Price Jr., the nephew of Joseph P. Frazer. In 1959, Kaiser-Ilin reached an agreement to assemble six-cylinder Studebaker Larks in Haifa, to help potential buyers bypass stiff Israeli duties on imported vehicles. Earlier that year, the Kaiser-Frazer plant at Haifa laid off 400 workers and suspended operations for two weeks because of a lack of parts.\n\nIn 1947 the Dutch company Nederlandse Kaiser-Frazer Fabrieken (NEKAF) was created with a new factory constructed in Rotterdam. NEKAF assembled 6,000 1949 Kaiser knock-down kits imported from the US using some local content (batteries, tires, interior, carpets, glass) and ignition and electrical system parts from France and Great Britain. Kaiser cars were assembled through 1954 with NEKAF exporting to Europe, South America and the Middle East.\n\nUS-built Jeep vehicles were imported into The Netherlands by S.A. Ateliers de La Dyle under an agreement with Willys Overland. Once Willys was purchased by Kaiser, the Willys agreement was transferred to NEKAF. In March 1954 assembly of the Jeep CJ-3B started and was followed by the FC-150, FC-170, the pickup truck, station wagon, CJ-5 and DJ-3A. On 21 January 1955 NEKAF signed a contract with the Royal Netherlands Army to supply 4,000 M38A1 jeeps with the first delivery to the army on 28 May of the same year. The vehicles were knock down kits imported from the US with some local content as with the 1949 Kaiser assembly. NEKAF delivered an additional 1,624 vehicles to the army through 1959 until production was taken over by Kemper & Van Twist Diesel who delivered another 2,237 jeep vehicles through 1963 although these were still commonly known as NEKAFs.\n\nThe NEKAF jeeps differed from the US version by adding side reflectors (white in front and red at the rear), low intensity \"city lights\" on the front fenders and front and rear mounted directional signals. In a bid to reduce the costs, the Ministry of War, having invested already in clothing for the crews, ordered the cabin heaters to be deleted. This modification entailed considerable redesign of the engine cooling unit which eventually led to increased cost of the vehicles (some 12,000 Dutch guilders each). The jeeps, dubbed NEKAF by the military, started to enter service in 1956 and remained so well into the 1990s albeit on reservist duties. The NEKAF jeep saw action in the brief Dutch Indonesian war in 1962, but particularly during the UNIFIL operation in which an armoured infantry battalion participated from 1979 till 1983, the NEKAF turned out to be a robust and reliable vehicle in South Lebanon. Upon withdrawal of the Dutch battalion all UNIFIL NEKAFs were dismantled and sold locally as scrap, save three NEKAFs that were secretly withheld and privately driven back to the Netherlands. One of these sole surviving UNIFIL NEKAFs is now in the collection of the Legermuseum Delft (the Dutch Army Museum).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1881649", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1881649", "title": "Ulmus laevis", "text": "Ulmus laevis\n\nUlmus laevis , variously known as the European white elm, fluttering elm, spreading elm, stately elm and, in the United States, the Russian elm, is a large deciduous tree native to Europe, from France northeast to southern Finland, east beyond the Urals into Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan, and southeast to Bulgaria and the Crimea; there are also disjunct populations in the Caucasus and Spain, the latter now considered a relict population rather than an introduction by man, and possibly the origin of the European population. \"U. laevis\" is rare in the UK, however its random distribution, together with the absence of any record of its introduction, has led at least one British authority to consider it native. NB: The epithet 'white' elm commonly used by British foresters alluded to the \"timber\" of the wych elm.\n\nThe species was first identified, as \"Ulmus laevis\", by Pallas, in his \"Flora Rossica\" published in 1784. The tree is allogamous and is most closely related to the American elm \"U. americana\".\n\nEndemic to alluvial forest, \"U. laevis\" is rarely encountered at elevations above 400 m. Most commonly found along rivers such as the Volga and Danube, it is one of very few elms tolerant of prolonged waterlogged, anoxic ground conditions. The species is threatened by habitat destruction and disturbance in some countries, notably Spain. Flood control schemes are particularly harmful, as seed dispersion is reliant on floods, while abstraction from aquifers lowering ground water levels has compromised the development of the trees.\n\nAlthough not possessed of an innate genetic resistance to Dutch elm disease, the species is rarely infected in western Europe.\n\n\"Ulmus laevis\" is similar in stature to the wych elm, if rather less symmetric, with a looser, untidy, branch structure and less neatly rounded crown. The tree typically reaches a height and breadth of > 30 m, with a trunk < 2 m d.b.h. The extensive shallow root system ultimately forms distinctive high buttresses around the base of the trunk. The bark is smooth at first, then in early maturity breaks into thin grey scales, which separate with age into a network of grey-brown scales and reddish-brown underbark, and finally is deeply fissured in old age like other elms. The leaves are deciduous, alternate, simple ovate with a markedly asymmetric base, < 10 cm long and < 7 cm broad, comparatively thin, often almost papery in texture and very translucent, smooth above with a downy underside. Significantly, the leaf veins do not divide from the central vein to the leaf margin. The leaves are shed earlier in autumn than other species of European elm. \n\nThe tree is most reliably distinguished from other European elms by its long flower stems, averaging 20 mm. Moreover, the apetalous wind-pollinated flowers are distinctively cream-coloured, appearing before the leaves in early spring in clusters of 15-30; they are 3–4 mm across. The fruit is a winged samara < 15 mm long by 10 mm broad with a ciliate margin, the single round 5 mm seed maturing in late spring. The seeds have a generally high rate of germination, 45–60% for Serbian trees examined by Stilinović.\n\nAlthough the species is protandrous, levels of self-pollination can be high The tree can grow very rapidly; where planted in persistently moist soil, trunk width of 13-year-old trees increased by 4 cm per annum at breast height (d.b.h.). The species differs from its closest relative, the American elm, mainly in the irregular crown structure and frequent epicormic shoots, features which also give the tree a distinctive winter silhouette. The American elm also has less acute leaf buds, longer petioles, narrower leaves, and a deeper apical notch in the samara which reaches the seed.\nLike other European elms, natural populations of the European white elm have little innate resistance to Dutch elm disease, although research by Irstea has isolated clones able to survive inoculation with the causal fungus, initially losing < 70% of their foliage, but regenerating strongly the following year. Moreover, the tree is not favoured by the vector bark beetles, which colonize it only when there are no other elm alternatives available, an uncommon situation in western Europe. Indeed, in a study of elm in Flanders, not one example of \"U. laevis\" was found to be afflicted by Dutch elm disease. Research in Spain has indicated that it is the presence of an antifeedant triterpene, alnulin, at a concentration of 200 μg/g {dried bark} which renders the tree unattractive to the beetles. Ergo: the tree's decline in western Europe is chiefly owing to woodland clearance in river valleys, and river management systems eliminating flooding, not disease.\n\nIt was noted by Jouin at Metz, and a century later by Mittempergher and Santini in Italy, that \"U. laevis\" had a very low susceptibility to the elm leaf beetle \"Xanthogaleruca luteola\". Research in Germany has established that the tree is also eschewed by the Zig Zag sawfly \"Aproceros leucopoda\".\n\nElwes observed that trees planted at Ugbrooke in Devon were infested with \"Cacopsylla ulmi\", which he had never found on any other elm in Britain, an affliction confirmed many years later by Richens, who discovered the specimens of \"U. laevis\" grown at Kew were the only elms in the Gardens afflicted by the louse, and the aphid \"Tinocallis platani\".\n\nThe species has a slight to moderate susceptibility to elm yellows.\n\n\"U. laevis\" is essentially a riparian tree, able to withstand over 100 days of continual flooding, although it is intolerant of saline conditions Spanish trees were found to be calcifuge, preferring slightly acid, siliceous soils, and also drought-intolerant, their xylem vessels prone to drought-stress cavitation. In England, the tree failed to prosper in chalk stream valleys, where the soil was predominantly black peat, named 'Adventurers' for the Adventurers' Land SSSI in Cambridgeshire, owing to dehydration in summer. Trees planted in dry ground are notoriously short-lived. \n\n\"U. laevis\" is comparatively weak-wooded, much more so than field elm \"Ulmus minor\", and thus an inappropriate choice for exposed locations. In trials in southern England by Butterfly Conservation, young trees of <5 m height were badly damaged by wind gusts of 40 knots (75 km/h) in midsummer storms.\nThe species was never widely introduced to the United States, but is represented at several arboreta. \"Ulmus effusa\", supplied by the Späth nursery of Berlin, was planted at the Dominion Arboretum, Ottawa, Canada, in 1896, as \"U. pedunculata\". In the Far East, the tree has been planted in Xinjiang province and elsewhere in northern China; planting in Tongliao City is known to have been particularly successful. White elm is also known to have been introduced to Australia.\n\nSince the beginning of the 21st century, the tree has enjoyed a small renaissance in England. A popular larval host plant of the white-letter hairstreak \"Satyrium w-album\" butterfly across Europe, the elm is now being planted by Butterfly Conservation and other groups to restore local populations decimated by the effects of Dutch elm disease on native or archaeophytic elms. The Cheshire Wildlife Trust, for example, planted numerous white elms on its reserves in the former Vale Royal district of the county.\n\n\"U. laevis\" is probably not native to the United Kingdom despite its random occurrence in the countryside, although the date and circumstances of its introduction have not survived. The earliest published references to the tree (as \"U. effusa\", citing Willdenow) were in Sibthorp's \"Flora Oxoniensis\" (1794), and (as \"U. effusa\" but without description) in Miller's posthumously revised \"Gardener's and Botanist's Dictionary\" (1807). The first specimen to be reported in cultivation, in 1838, was at Whiteknights Park, Reading, which featured an elm grove; the tree measured in height, suggesting it had been planted at the end of the 18th century. However, the authenticity of the Whiteknights tree is a matter of contention; it flowered but did not set fertile seed, which suggested to Loudon that it might be \"U. campestris\" (\"U. minor\" 'Atinia'), or, on account of it not producing suckers, possibly \"U. montana\" (:\"U. glabra\"). Moreover, Whiteknights was supplied by the Lee and Kennedy nursery of Hammersmith, which is not known to have stocked \"U. laevis\". A tree at Syon Park identified by Elwes & Henry as \"U. laevis\" was later considered by Bean as more closely resembling \"U. americana\" by dint of its symmetrical branch arching. The species was not reported from the wild until 1943, with the discovery of a tree in a Surrey hedgerow.\n\nIt is possible the tree's distribution was associated with Capability Brown (1716–1783), known to have favoured \"U. laevis\", which he listed among his preferred \"native\" (sic) trees. This could explain the existence of the seven old specimens discovered by Elwes in 1908 on Mount Pleasant within Ugbrooke Park, Devon, designed by Brown in 1761. Ugbrooke is four miles from Mamhead Park, which had earlier been planted with numerous exotic trees, notably holm oak, collected by its owner, merchant Thomas Ball ( d. 1749) during his commercial travels in Europe. Ball's introductions were known to have been marketed by his head gardener William Lucombe, who in 1720 founded the first commercial nursery in the south-west at Exeter, though an account of trees growing at Mamhead by Pince (grandson of Lucombe) in 1835 makes no mention of \"U. laevis\" nor of any other elms. None of Lucombe's early catalogues are known to survive, and thus the introduction of \"U. laevis\" through south Devon cannot be confirmed. However, the tree does not feature in any of the surviving arboreta accessions lists, or catalogues of the larger, nationally famous, nurseries of the day, and its earliest-known mention in commerce remains in the south-west, in the catalogue of the Ford & Please nursery (as \"U. pedunculata\") at Exeter circa 1836. James Main mentions the tree as 'a native of Hungary' and in 1838 only to be met in 'ornamental plantations', but by 1846 was 'becoming available in (UK) nurseries'.\n\n\"U. laevis\", obtained from the Späth nursery of Berlin as \"U. effusa\", was planted in Kew Gardens (1895), in the Ryston Hall arboretum, Norfolk (1914), and, re-propagated, in Cambridge University Botanic Garden (1909). Evidently the tree did not gain in popularity, and was overlooked or ignored by most authors of popular guides to trees in Britain during the 20th century, notably Mabey in his \"Flora Britannica\". The tree is also omitted from Keble-Martin's comprehensive \"Flora of Devon\".\n\nIt is not known whether \"U. laevis\" was introduced to Scotland before the early 20th century. Two of the three specimens supplied by the Späth nursery, Berlin, to the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh in 1902 as \"U. effusa\" may survive in Edinburgh, as it was the practice of the garden to distribute trees about the city; the third specimen was in the garden itself. Other examples can be found in the city, notably in Fettes College grounds opposite Inverleith Allotments, and at the entrance to North Merchiston Cemetery. In Wales, two mature trees with numerous suckers occur in a small wood at Rhydyfelin near Aberystwyth, while another grows at Llandegfan, Anglesey. In Ireland, the tree is represented by a line of four at the Old Rectory, Kells Road, Ardee, County Louth (, girth , October 2009), and in the Channel Islands, by a clump near the well at La Seigneurie (Le Manoir), Sark. \nThe two largest known trees in Europe are at Gülitz in Germany (3.1 m d.b.h.), and at Komorów in Poland (2.96 m d.b.h. in 2011), known as the Witcher (tree). Other veterans survive at Casteau, Belgium (bole-girth 5.15 m), in Rahnsdorf near Berlin (bole-girth 4.5 m) and in Ritvala, Finland (bole-girth 4.49 m).\nA lane of \"Ulmus laevis\" is found at Eibergen, Netherlands (see Gallery below), while a large, mature specimen is found within the Alhambra, Granada.\n\n\"Ulmus laevis\" has very occasionally been planted as an ornamental tree in the UK, and even more randomly in countryside hedgerows. The UK Champion is at Ferry Farm, on the banks of the Tamar at Harewood, Cornwall (27 m high, 1.8 m d.b.h. in 1997). Other examples are few and far between though sometimes of considerable age, surviving amid diseased native elm in Cornwall at Torpoint, and Pencalenick (21 m high, d.b.h. 1.75 m), and near Over Wallop in Hampshire (16 m high, d.b.h. 1.3 m 2016) The largest-known aggregation in England is the ring of 50 trees planted circa 1950 within a ring of common lime around a former ammunition dump on the elevated chalk of Salisbury Plain at Hexagon Wood, Larkhill, about north of Stonehenge. \n\nIn the United States, a tree of 31.4 m (103 ft) in height (2015) grows at 3331 NE Hancock Street in Portland, Oregon; its age is not known.\nThe timber of the white elm is of poor quality, the cross-grain causing problems when machined, and thus of little practical use to man, not even as firewood. The density of the timber is significantly lower than that of other European elms. However, owing to its rapid growth, tolerance of soil compaction, air pollution and de-icing salts, the tree has long been used for amenity planting in towns and along roadsides.\n\n\"U. laevis\" is easily grown from seed sown on ordinary compost and kept well-watered. However, viability can vary greatly from year to year, while the seed is remarkably short-lived. Germination should occur within one week even without heat, the best seedlings attaining as much as half a metre in their first year. Softwood cuttings taken in June is also a reliable method; the cuttings strike very quickly, well within a fortnight, rapidly producing a dense matrix of roots.\nSeveral putative varieties have been identified. A variety \"celtidea\" from what is now the Ukraine was reported by Rogowicz in the middle of the 19th century, but no examples are known to survive. Another variety \"parvifolia\" has been reported from Serbia. 'Simplicidens' is a very rare variety, the only example known to survive is at the National Botanic Garden of Latvia in Salaspils.\n\nCompared with the other European species of elm, \"U. laevis\" has received scant horticultural attention, there being only seven recorded cultivars:\n\nIn Russia other ornamental forms are recognized: f. \"argentovariegata\", f. \"rubra\", and f. \"tiliifolia\". A pyramidal form was reported in 1888 from the Fredericksfelde cemetery in Berlin by Bolle. A line of similar monopodial trees grows (2019) on the island in the Lot at Entraygues, France.\n\"U. laevis\" does not hybridize naturally, in common with the American elm (\"U. americana\") to which it is closely related. However, in experiments at the Arnold Arboretum, it was successfully crossed with \"U. thomasii\" and \"U. pumila\"; no such crosses have ever been released to commerce.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1881655", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1881655", "title": "Quarter guard", "text": "Quarter guard\n\nThe quarter guard is a small detachment of troops that can be used as a ceremonial guard which may be mounted at the entrance of a military unit to pay compliments as required. A quarter guard is to consist of one non-commissioned officer and six or eight other ranks formed up in two ranks. It is technically a minuscule guard of honour.\n\nIn the Indian Army, the quarter guard is the main point of security arrangements for the army camp/garrison Regimental depot. The regimental colours, the armoury and the treasury would be kept in this building. In addition to this, the quarter guard also has a lock-up often in the guardhouse to hold soldiers charged with minor crimes (absent without leave, drunkenness being among the usual crimes).\n\nThe standard guard strength is 6 guards, 1 guard 2/ic (2nd in command - usually a Naik or Lance Naik) and a guard commander (usually a Havildar). Additionally, in some units, a bugler would also be present for calling the various duty calls etc. At the time of emergencies/threats, the strength of the guard would be increased.\n\nThe Armoury is a part of the Quarter Guard. A Quarter Guard is a place of pride for the Army Unit and the guards detailed on duty there are always in ceremonials. A visiting dignitary invariably visits the Quarter Guard. A Quarter Guard is expected to reflect the high standards of the unit. It has some relation with the number of troops in presidential guard. May be a quarter of governor general guard in English empire.\n"}
{"id": "1881658", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1881658", "title": "Glevum", "text": "Glevum\n\nGlevum (or, more formally, Colonia Nervia Glevensium, or occasionally \"Glouvia\") was a Roman fort in Roman Britain that became a \"colonia\" of retired legionaries in AD 97. Today, it is known as Gloucester, located in the English county of Gloucestershire. The name Glevum is taken by many present-day businesses in the area and also by the 26-mile \"Glevum Way\", a long-distance footpath or recreational walk encircling modern Gloucester.\nGlevum was established around AD 48, at an important crossing of the River Severn, and near to the Fosse Way, the early front line after the Roman invasion of Britain. Initially, a Roman fort was established at present-day Kingsholm. Twenty years later, a larger replacement fortress was built on slightly higher ground nearby, centred on present-day Gloucester Cross, and a civilian settlement grew around it. The Roman Legion based here was the Legio II Augusta, as they prepared to invade Roman Wales between 66 and 74 AD.\n\nIn AD 97, the whole area was designated a colonia by the Emperor Nerva. A colonia was the residence of retired legionaries and enjoyed the highest status in the Empire. The legionaries were given farmland in the surrounding district, and could be called upon as a Roman auxiliary armed force.\n\nA large and impressive administrative basilica and forum market-place were built in the town, as well as many fine homes with mosaic floors.\n\nAt its height, Glevum may have had a population of as many as 10,000 people. The entire area around Glevum was intensely Romanised in the second and third centuries, with a higher than normal distribution of villas, as a result of its suitability for the traditional intensive Roman farming methods.\n\nToday, some of the best examples of Roman villas in Britain, including Chedworth villa and Woodchester villa, both famous for their Roman mosaics, are not far from Glevum.\n\nExcavations at Gloucester's New Market Hall in the 1960s showed that Romano-British occupation of the town may have continued in some form into the sub-Roman period, even if the town's population may have been greatly reduced. A new portal in the town's wall was built at the beginning of the sixth century, showing a modest growth of the town after the Battle of Mons Badonicus in 497.\n\nThe \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\" records a King Coinmail (according to the original A-text), who may have come from Gloucester, taking part in the Battle of Dyrham in 577, when the city was conquered by the Anglo-Saxons.\n\n\nhttp://www.glosarch.org.uk/Gloucestercityresearch.html#GLEVUM\n"}
