{"id": "2121913", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2121913", "title": "Monster Mash", "text": "Monster Mash\n\n\"Monster Mash\" is a 1962 novelty song by Bobby \"Boris\" Pickett. The song was released as a single on Gary S. Paxton's Garpax Records label in August 1962 along with a full-length LP called \"The Original Monster Mash\", which contained several other monster-themed tunes. The \"Monster Mash\" single was #1 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart on October 20–27 of that year, just before Halloween. It has been a perennial holiday favorite ever since.\n\nPickett was an aspiring actor who sang with a band called the Cordials at night while going to auditions during the day. One night, while performing with his band, Pickett did a monologue in imitation of horror movie actor Boris Karloff while performing the Diamonds' \"Little Darlin'\". The audience loved it, and fellow band member Lenny Capizzi encouraged Pickett to do more with the Karloff imitation.\n\nPickett and Capizzi composed \"Monster Mash\" and recorded it with Gary S. Paxton, pianist Leon Russell, Johnny MacRae, Rickie Page, and Terry Berg, credited as \"The Crypt-Kickers\". (Mel Taylor, drummer for the Ventures, is sometimes credited with playing on the record as well, while Russell, who arrived late for the session, appears on the single's B-side, \"Monster Mash Party\".) The song was partially inspired by Paxton's earlier novelty hit \"Alley Oop\", as well as by the Mashed Potato dance craze of the era. A variation on the Mashed Potato was danced to \"Monster Mash\", in which the footwork was the same but Frankenstein-style monster gestures were made with the arms and hands.\n\nThe producers made extensive use of foley art for the recording; the sound of a coffin opening was imitated by a rusty nail being pulled out of a board. The sound of a cauldron bubbling was simulated by water being bubbled through a straw, and the chains rattling were simply chains being dropped on a tile floor.\n\nThe song is narrated by a mad scientist whose monster, late one evening, rises from his lab to perform a new dance, with a name implying it is inspired by the Mashed Potato, a popular dance of the early 1960s. The dance becomes \"the hit of the land\" when the scientist throws a party for other monsters, among them classic 1940s horror film icons such as the Wolfman, Igor, Count Dracula and his son. In addition to narrating the song in the Karloff voice, Pickett also impersonated fellow horror film actor Bela Lugosi as Count Dracula with the line, \"Whatever happened to my Transylvania Twist?\" and character actor Peter Lorre as Igor (a role Lorre never played, though he did play numerous deformed eccentrics). The mad scientist says that the twist has been replaced by the Monster Mash, which Dracula embraces by joining the house band, the Crypt-Kicker Five. The story closes with the mad scientist inviting \"you, the living\" to the party at his castle.\n\nThe song was re-released several times and appeared in the U.S. \"Billboard\" charts on two occasions after the original release: August 1970 and May 1973. The BBC had banned the record from airplay in 1962 on the grounds that the song was \"too morbid\". It was re-released in the United Kingdom in 1973, where it peaked at #3 in early October. In the U.S., the record re-entered the Hot 100 on May 5, 1973, peaking at #10 on August 11. On the edition of September 15, 1973 of \"American Top 40\", Casey Kasem mistakenly said that the record had accumulated 40 weeks on the Hot 100, which then would have been the all-time record, only for a listener to inform Kasem later that the record's three weeks on the Hot 100 in 1970 had been included in the 1973 run, thus reducing the total to 37 weeks. The record has not charted on the Hot 100 since then. The 1970 reissue on the Parrot label (Parrot 348) was certified as a Gold record (for sales of over one million copies) on August 28, 1973.\n\nTo celebrate the 1973 release, Bobby and the Crypt-Kickers toured Dallas and St. Louis around the 1973 Halloween holiday. On this tour, the Crypt-Kickers were composed of Brian Ray (now guitarist with Paul McCartney), drummer Brian Englund, keyboardist Don Chambers, singer Jean Ray, and others. \"Monster Mash\" re-entered the British charts again on November 2, 2008 at #60.\n\n\"Monsters' Holiday\", a Christmas-themed follow-up, was recorded by Pickett and released in December 1962, peaking at #30 on the \"Billboard\" chart. The tune was penned by the renowned novelty song composer Paul Harrison.\n\nIn 1974, Buck Owens had re-invented \"Monsters' Holiday\", giving it the title \"It's a Monsters' Holiday\". That song peaked #6 on \"Billboard\" in mid-September of the same year.\n\nIn 1985, with American culture experiencing a growing awareness of rap music, Pickett released \"Monster Rap\", which describes the mad scientist's frustration at being unable to teach the dancing monster from \"Monster Mash\" how to talk. The problem is solved when he teaches the monster to rap. A movie musical based on the song starring Pickett was released in 1995. During the 2004 presidential election, Pickett turned the song into a campaign video and re-titled it \"Monster Slash\", with lyrics by environmental campaigner Peter Altman, in which he critiqued President George W. Bush's environmental policies.\n\nIn 1989, Stuart Hersh began managing Pickett, and upon learning Pickett did not own the master recording to \"Monster Mash\", the pair in 1993 recorded a perfect copy of the original \"Monster Mash\" that they then used to undercut the owners of the track, Universal. According to Hersh, the company was unconcerned with the song's legacy and was instead \"preoccupied with how much money they could get off (the song)\". Pickett was missing out on thousands of dollars in licensing fees, but Hersh and Pickett's goal was not just to make money. They sought instead to help keep \"Monster Mash\" relevant: by ensuring \"Monster Mash\" would be affordable to independent production houses, they ensured it would always have a place in culture.\n\nThe \"Transylvania Twist\", mentioned in the lyrics of \"Monster Mash\", was written into a full song for the film \"Spookley the Square Pumpkin\" (which Pickett narrated) and performed by The Honeydoos, a Pointer Sisters-like girl group of singing melons.\n\nThe backing singers for the record were The Blossoms, led by Darlene Love.\n\nOn the Digital Song Sales chart, the song was peaked at position 27 during 2005, 2007 to 2011 and from 2013 to 2017 and is played annually on the Sirius XM Satellite Radio.\n\nIn 2012, the song ranked #25 on \"Billboard\".\n\n\"Monster Mash\" became a pop music standard, and many cover versions have been recorded over the years.\n\nHorror punk band the Misfits recorded a cover version of \"Monster Mash\" in 1997 as part of a promotion surrounding a DVD release of the 1967 stop motion film \"Mad Monster Party?\". Their version was released as a single in 1999, and a new version was recorded for their 2003 album \"Project 1950\".\n\nThe Misfits recorded their version of \"Monster Mash\" in 1997 in a recording studio in Newark, New Jersey. Bassist Jerry Only later stated that \"The 'Monster Mash' was a no-brainer for the Misfits to cover as a timeless Halloween release. The song was always a childhood favorite of mine.\" The recording was the first time that Only had performed lead vocals for the band, while then-Misfits lead singer Michale Graves provided backing vocals. On October 18, 1997 a live performance of the song was recorded and broadcast from the studio of the New Jersey-based cable television music show \"Power Play\", the same studio in which the song was recorded.\n\nThe Misfits' version of \"Monster Mash\" was used in a cross-promotion campaign arranged by Deluxo and John Cafiero, who had directed the Misfits' music videos for \"American Psycho\" and \"Dig Up Her Bones\", to create awareness of a home video release of the 1967 Rankin/Bass stop motion film \"Mad Monster Party?\". Deluxo had recently acquired the rights to the film in hopes of restoring it, but could not find a quality print. They eventually found a quality 16 mm print and the Misfits hosted a special screening of the film at Anthology Film Archives in New York City, with the \"American Psycho\" music video as an opening featurette. Notable attendees at the screening included members of the Misfits, Cafiero, Marky Ramone, Jimmy Gestapo of Murphy's Law, and executives from both Geffen Records and Roadrunner Records. Deluxo restored \"Mad Monster Party?\" from the 16 mm print and re-released it on VHS in limited numbers. A music video for the Misfits' live recording of \"Monster Mash\" was created interspersing clips from the film with footage from their \"Power Play\" performance, and was intended to be included as a bonus feature on a forthcoming DVD release. However, due to complications over distribution rights, the DVD was not released and the VHS version was discontinued. A DVD version of the film was eventually released in 2003 by Anchor Bay Entertainment, restored from a different 35 mm print.\n\nAs part of the promotional campaign, an image of Boris Karloff as he appears in \"Mad Monster Party?\" was used under license from his daughter Sarah Karloff in artwork for a 7\" vinyl single of the Misfits' version of \"Monster Mash\". Percepto Records used the same image of Karloff for the cover of the film's soundtrack album which was released in September 1998. The Misfits single was intended to be released the following month, but was delayed due to lack of time to properly mix the studio recording. Instead the artwork was used in connection with a free MP3 download of the band's live recording of \"Monster Mash\", available through their website as a \"virtual single\". The image was used again as cover artwork when the finished single was released physically in October 1999 as the first release of the band's new label Misfits Records.\n\nThe Misfits' studio recording of \"Monster Mash\" was included on their 2001 compilation album \"Cuts from the Crypt\". At the insistence of the band's label Roadrunner Records, the live recording was omitted from the album and only the studio version was used. The Misfits recorded a new version of the song, featuring Cafiero on backing vocals, for their 2003 album \"Project 1950\". By this time the band had a new lineup consisting of Jerry Only (bass guitar and lead vocals), Dez Cadena (guitar and backing vocals), and Marky Ramone (drums). Only called this version of the song \"probably the best version we've ever done. I'm really happy with it. We've recorded it several times in the past and this is the hardest hitting version of them all.\" Ramone commented: Monster Mash' always reminded me of Boris Karloff. Our version's a lot faster than the original, which was a slower 4/4 beat. I always liked the way the drums seemed to come in out of nowhere after Igor walked across the room.\" Cadena, meanwhile, remarked that \"If I didn't know any better ['Monster Mash'] could have been written for the Misfits.\"\n\nTwo separate pressings of the Misfits single were released, both issued on 7\" vinyl in 1999. The first pressing had the studio version on both sides and consisted of 1,000 copies: 800 on green vinyl, 100 on red, and 100 on gold. It was sold by the band while on tour and also by mail order through their \"Fiend Club\" fan club and official website. 1,000 promotional CD copies of the studio version were also pressed and used for limited solicitation to radio stations. A second pressing of the vinyl single had the studio version on side A and the live version on side B and consisted of 1,000 copies on glow-in-the-dark vinyl, available exclusively by mail order through the band's website. The single sold out and is no longer in print.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2121919", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2121919", "title": "King Kong Escapes", "text": "King Kong Escapes\n\nKing Kong Escapes, released in Japan as , is a 1967 Japanese-American science-fiction \"kaiju\" film featuring King Kong, co-produced by Toho and Rankin/Bass. The film was directed by Ishirō Honda with special effects by Eiji Tsuburaya and stars Rhodes Reason, Linda Jo Miller, Akira Takarada, Mie Hama, Eisei Amamoto, with Haruo Nakajima as King Kong and Yū Sekida as Mechani-Kong and Gorosaurus. The film is a loose adaptation of the Rankin/Bass Productions Saturday morning cartoon series \"The King Kong Show\" and was the second and final Toho-produced film featuring King Kong. \"King Kong Escapes\" was released in Japan on July 22, 1967 and released in the United States on June 19, 1968.\n\nAn evil genius named Dr. Who creates Mechani-Kong, a robot version of King Kong, to dig for the highly radioactive Element X, found only at the North Pole. Mechani-Kong enters an ice cave and begins to dig into a glacier, but the radiation destroys its brain circuits and the robot shuts down. Who then sets his sights on getting the real Kong to finish the job. Who is taken to task by a female overseer, Madame Piranha, whose country's government is financing the doctor's schemes, and frequently berates him for his failure to get results.\n\nMeanwhile, a submarine commanded by Carl Nelson arrives at Mondo Island, where the legendary King Kong lives. Here, the giant ape gets into an intense fight with a giant dinosaur Gorosaurus and a sea serpent. He falls in love with Lt. Susan Watson (played by Linda Jo Miller) following in the footsteps of Ann Darrow from the 1933 film.\n\nDr. Who subsequently goes to Mondo Island, abducts Kong and brings him back to his base at the North Pole. Kong is hypnotized by a flashing light device and fitted with a radio earpiece. Who commands Kong to retrieve Element X from the cave. Problems with the earpiece ensue and Who has to kidnap Susan Watson, the only person who can control Kong.\n\nAfter Watson and her fellow officers are captured by Who, Madame Piranha unsuccessfully tries to seduce Nelson to bring him over to her side. Eventually Kong escapes and swims all the way to Japan where the climactic battle with Mechani-Kong transpires. The two giants face off at the Tokyo Tower in the finale. Kong prevails and destroys Mechani-Kong and kills Who. Then Kong triumphantly swims back to his island home.\n\n\nThe story is partly a remake of the animated series (itself a retelling of the original 1933 film) about a tamed Kong who is befriended by a boy and directed to fight for the forces of good. That concept (minus the boy) is combined with a mad scientist story with elements from the then-popular spy film genre. The sinister Dr. Who (not to be confused with the British television series, its main character or his film version) is patterned after \"James Bond\" villains Dr. No and Ernst Stavro Blofeld. His partner, Madame Piranha, is an Asian spy played by Mie Hama, fresh from the Bond film \"You Only Live Twice\" (1967). Submarine commander Carl Nelson is similar to Admiral Nelson, commander of the submarine \"Seaview\" in \"Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea\", a series that also featured giant monsters and stories about international espionage.\n\nVeteran voice actor Paul Frees dubbed the voice of Dr. Who in the American release.\n\nIn an interview with Reason on the making of this film, Paul Frees did almost all the male voices for the dub. Frees apparently asked Reason why he was there, and said as a joke: \"Why are you here? I could probably do a better version of you than you could.\".\n\nLinda Miller hated her dubbed voice in the American version, but loved the Japanese voice. She was extremely mad at Mr. Rankin, the producer, for not inviting her to dub her own lines when Rhodes Reason (Nelson) was able to re-dub his. It turned out to work this way because Reason was a part of the Screen Actors Guild, and Linda Miller was only a model, and still residing in Japan at the time (transportation costs to New York would have been prohibitive).\nThe shot of Gorosaurus living on Monster Island seen in the 1969 film \"All Monsters Attack\" was actually stock footage taken from this film.\n\n\nToho reissued the film in 1973 as part of the \"Champion Matsuri\" (東宝チャンピオンまつり), a film festival that ran from 1969 through 1978 and featured numerous films packaged together and aimed at children.\n\nAfterwards it was screened as part of a specialty festival in 1983 called \"The Godzilla Resurrection Festival\" (\"Gojira no Fukkatsu\"). This large festival featured 10 \"Godzilla\"/kaiju films in all (\"Godzilla\", \"King Kong vs. Godzilla\", \"Mothra vs. Godzilla\", \"Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster\", \"Invasion of Astro-Monster\", \"Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla\", \"Rodan\", \"Mothra\", \"Atragon\", and \"King Kong Escapes\").\n\nOutside Japan and the U.S, the film received a wide release in most international markets, where it went by different titles. The film was released in Germany as \"King-Kong, Frankensteins Sohn\" (\"King Kong: Frankenstein's Son\"), in Belgium as \"La Revanche de King Kong\" (\"The Revenge of King Kong\") - a direct translation of the Japanese title, in Italy as \"King Kong il gigante della foresta\" (\"King Kong, the Giant of the Forest\"), in Turkey as \"Canavarlarin Gazabi\" (\"Wrath of the Monsters\"), in Mexico as \"El Regreso de King Kong\" (\"The Return of King Kong\"), in Finland as \"King Kong kauhun saarella\" (\"King Kong on the Island of Terror\"), and in Sweden as \"King Kong på skräckens ö\" (\"King Kong on Terror Island\")\n\nDVD\n\nR1 America - Universal Pictures\n\n\nBlu-ray\n\nThe film opened in the United States in June 1968 on a double feature with the Don Knotts comedy \"The Shakiest Gun in the West\". Contemporary American reviews were mixed. \"New York Times\" film critic Vincent Canby gave it a particularly insulting review, commenting, \"The Japanese ... are all thumbs when it comes to making monster movies like 'King Kong Escapes.' The Toho moviemakers are quite good in building miniature sets, but much of the process photography—matching the miniatures with the full-scale shots—is just bad ... the plotting is hopelessly primitive ...\"\n\nThe July 15, 1968, issue of \"Film Bulletin\", however, gave it a more positive review, saying, \"Grown-ups who like their entertainments on a comic-strip level will find this good fun and the Universal release (made in Japan) has plenty of ballyhoo angles to draw the school-free youngsters in large numbers.\"\n\nToho wanted to use King Kong again after this film. King Kong was included in an early draft for the 1968 film \"Destroy All Monsters\" but was ultimately dropped due to the fact that Toho's license on the character was set to expire. Toho managed to get some use out of the suit, though. The suit was reused to play the character \"Gorilla\" in episode #38 of the Toho giant superhero show \"Go! Greenman\". The three-part episode, titled \"Greenman vs. Gorilla\", aired from March 21, 1974 through March 23, 1974.\n\nToho would bring the character Gorosaurus into the \"Godzilla\" series in \"Destroy All Monsters\", using the same suit from this film. The suit was reused again four years later (at this point in a dilapidated condition) to portray the character in episode #6 of the Toho giant superhero show \"Go! Godman\". The six-part episode, titled \"Godman vs. Gorosaurus\", aired from November 9, 1972 through November 15, 1972.\n\nIn the early 1990s when plans for a \"King Kong vs. Godzilla\" remake fell through, Toho had planned to bring back Mechani-Kong as an opponent for Godzilla in the project \"Godzilla vs. Mechani-Kong\". However, according to Koichi Kawakita, it was discovered that obtaining permission to use even the \"likeness\" of King Kong would be difficult. Kawakita stated: \n\nToho wanted to pit Godzilla against King Kong because \"King Kong vs. Godzilla\" was very successful. However, the studio thought that obtaining permission to use King Kong would be difficult. So, it instead decided to use MechaniKong. Soon afterward, it was discovered that obtaining permission even to use the likeness of King Kong would be difficult. So, the project was canceled. MechaniKong was going to have injectors. A number of people were going to be injected into Godzilla while the robot was wrestling with him. They then were going to do battle with Godzilla from within while MechaniKong continued to do battle with him from without. There were going to be many different strange worlds inside Godzilla. The concept was very much like the one on which \"Fantastic Voyage\" was based.\n\nNotes\nBibliography\n\n"}

{"id": "2121945", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2121945", "title": "Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan", "text": "Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan\n\nSheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan (; born 11 March 1961), colloquially known by his initials as MbZ, is the Crown Prince of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi and Deputy Supreme Commander of the United Arab Emirates Armed Forces. He is seen as the driving force behind the UAE's activist foreign policy and is a leader of a campaign against Islamist movements in Arabia. Due to the ill health of the UAE president Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed, Mohammed bin Zayed was entrusted with most day-to-day decision making of the emirate of Abu Dhabi as the crown prince of Abu Dhabi and most of the presidential public affairs of the state and hence, he is sometimes considered as the UAE's de facto ruler. In 2019, the \"New York Times\" named him as the most powerful Arab ruler. In 2020, the \"New York Times\" called him \"one of the most powerful men on Earth.\" He was also named as one of the '100 Most Influential People' of 2019 by \"Time magazine\".\n\nMohamed bin Zayed was born in Al Ain on 11 March 1961 in what was then the Trucial States. He is the third son of Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, the first President of the United Arab Emirates and ruler of Abu Dhabi, and his third wife, Sheikha Fatima bint Mubarak Al Ketbi. Mohamed's brothers are: Khalifa (the current Ra'is of the UAE), Hamdan, Hazza, Saeed, Isa, Nahyan, Saif, Tahnoun, Mansour, Falah, Diab, Omar, and Khalid (as well as three deceased brothers, Sultan, Nasser, and Ahmed). In addition to these, he has a few sisters. He has five younger full-brothers: Hamdan, Hazza, Tahnoun, Mansour, and Abdullah. They are referred to as Bani Fatima or sons of Fatima.\n\nAl-Nahyan was educated at The Royal Academy in Rabat until the age of 10, where he was a classmate of King Mohammed VI of Morocco. His father Sheikh Zayed sent him to Morocco intending for it to be a toughening experience. He gave him a passport showing a different last name, so that he wouldn’t be treated like royalty. Al Nahyan spent several months working as a waiter in a local restaurant. He made his own meals and did his own laundry, and was often lonely. Al Nahyan described his life back then by saying “There’d be a bowl of tabbouleh in the fridge, and I’d keep eating from it day after day until a kind of fungus formed on the top\". \n\nHe was further educated at schools in Al Ain, Abu Dhabi and a summer at Gordonstoun until the age of 18. In the Emirates, his father Sheikh Zayed inadvertently put an Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood Islamist named Izzedine Ibrahim in charge of his education. \n\nIn 1979, he joined the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst graduating in April 1979. During his time at Sandhurst, he completed a fundamental armor course, a fundamental flying course, a parachutist course, and training on tactical planes and helicopters, including the Gazelle squadron. During his time in Sandhurst, he met and became good friends with Abdullah of Pahang, who would later become the Yang di-Pertuan Agong of Malaysia. They were both officer cadets at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst.\n\nIn the 1980s as a young military officer on holiday in Tanzania, he met the Masai people and saw their customs and the extent of poverty in the country. Upon his return he went to see his father Sheikh Zayed. His father asked him what he had done to help the people he had encountered. Al Nahyan shrugged and said the people he met were not Muslims. Al Nahyan said, “He clutched my arm, and looked into my eyes very harshly. He said, ‘We are all God’s children.’ ” \n\nHe then returned home to the UAE to join the Officers' Training Course in Sharjah. He has held a number of roles in the UAE military, from that of an Officer in the Amiri Guard (now called Presidential Guard) to a pilot in the UAE Air Force.\n\nIn November 2003, his father Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan appointed Sheikh Mohamed as Deputy Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi. Upon the death of his father, Al-Nahyan became Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi in November 2004 and was appointed Deputy Supreme Commander of the UAE Armed Forces in January 2005. Later that month, he was promoted to the rank of General. Since December 2004 he has also been the Chairman of the Abu Dhabi Executive Council, which is responsible for the development and planning of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi and is a member of the Supreme Petroleum Council. He also serves as a special adviser to the President of the UAE, Khalifa bin Zayed Al-Nahyan, his older brother.\n\nAs a result of the ill health of the current UAE President Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed, Al Nahyan welcomes many foreign dignitaries in the capital district of the United Arab Emirates in the city of Abu Dhabi. In November 2010, Al-Nayhan and UAE Foreign Minister Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan welcomed Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh to the UAE for their second state visit. Al-Nahyan also accompanied the Queen and the Duke on a tour of the Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque at the beginning of their visit.\n\nAl Nahyan has played a leading role in the UAE’s foreign policy by facilitating increased engagement with nations outside the MENA region. Al Nahyan and French President Emmanuel Macron share common interests in countering extremism and have formulated a bilateral road map for future partnership. Al Nahyan sought France for increased cooperation and exchange in matters related to education, culture, heritage, economy, investments, energy, space, regional peace and security, defense cooperation, countering extremism, and fighting climate change, among other items. Al Nahyan also sought comprehensive partnership with Singapore and signed memoranda of understanding in which both nations agreed to strengthen cooperation in business, finance, investment, defense, development, and education. They also signed three Memoranda of Understanding in which they agreed to collaborate on environmental protection and sustainable consumption endeavors. \n\nHe has also provided substantial financial aid on behalf of the UAE to strengthen its position on the international stage. In 2018, he traveled to Ethiopia to meet Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed ahead of the first installment of a $3 billion donation from the UAE to Ethiopia, intended to tide over its foreign exchange shortage. Furthermore, the UAE under Al Nahyan's encouragement and initiative, raised funds to provide aid to Somalia during periods of drought.\n\nAl Nahyan also developed new relationships with countries in Eastern Europe. In September 2019, Mohammed bin Zayed made his first official visit to Belarus to held discussions on previous arrangements, issues of mutual interest, and other avenues in various sectors like trade, economy and investment cooperation. Al Nahyan was received at the Independence Palace in Minsk by President Alexander Lukashenko.\n\nAl-Nahyan is also a supporter of Yemen's internationally recognized government after the Yemen civil war and supported the Saudi-led, western-backed intervention in Yemen to drive out Houthi militants after the Houthi takeover in Yemen. During Al-Nahyan's visit to France in November 2018, a group of rights activists filed a lawsuit against the crown prince accusing him of \"war crimes and complicity in torture and inhumane treatment in Yemen\". The complaint filed on behalf of the French rights group AIDL said: \"It’s in this capacity that he has ordered bombings on Yemeni territory.\"\n\n\nAl Nahyan regards the United States as his chief ally and has a strong relationship with United States diplomats including US former Secretary of Defence Jim Mattis and US former national security advisor and counter-terrorism expert Richard A. Clarke. As unpaid advisers, Al Nahyan consults them and follows their advice on combating terrorism and enhancing the UAE's military strength and intelligence. During the Obama administration, Al Nahyan had an initially good relationship with the administration but the relationship deteriorated when Obama had not bothered to consult or even inform the UAE about the Iran nuclear deal. The UAE had a lot at stake, having forced Dubai traders to give up their lucrative business with Iran to comply with the sanctions. According to an Emirati senior adviser “His Highness felt that the U.A.E. had made sacrifices and then been excluded”. Al Nahyan continued talking to Obama regularly and offered him advice. He warned him that the proposed remedy in Syria — Islamist rebels — could be worse than Assad’s tyranny. He also urged Obama to talk to the Russians about working together on Syria. The relationship deteriorated further when Obama made dismissive comments in a 2016 interview in The Atlantic, describing the gulf’s rulers as “free riders” who “do not have the ability to put out the flames on their own”. After the election of Donald Trump, Al Nahyan flew to New York to meet the president-elect’s team and canceled a parting lunch with Obama. \n\nWith Donald Trump in office, Al Nahyan shared similar ideas with Trump regarding Iran and the Muslim Brotherhood, which Trump has sought to move strongly against both. As a child, Al Nahyan's father Sheikh Zayed unknowingly assigned a prominent Muslim Brotherhood member, Ezzedine Ibrahim, as Mohammed's tutor. His tutor attempted an indoctrination that backfired. As Sheikh Mohammed explains, “I am an Arab, I am a Muslim and I pray. And in the 1970s and early 1980s I was one of them,” Prince Mohammed told visiting American diplomats in 2007 to explain his distrust of the Muslim Brotherhood, as they reported in a classified cable released by WikiLeaks. He stated “I believe these guys have an agenda.” Trump also shared Al Nahyan's views over Qatar, Libya and Saudi Arabia, even over the advice of cabinet officials or senior national security staff.\n\n\nAl Nahyan maintains a strong relationship with Russia and its president Vladimir Putin, and has brokered talks between Russia and the Trump Administration. Al Nahyan was named in the final report of special counsel Robert Mueller III on the alleged collusion between Trump campaign and Russia, which the investigation later concluded that there was no collusion between the meeting that occurred with Al Nahyan. Al Nahyan's strong relationship with both Russia and the United States, as well as the influence he wields across both of the superpowers, has led to \"The New York Times\" to label him as the Arab World's \"most powerful ruler\". Putin calls Al Nahyan an \"old friend\", calling him \"a big friend of our country, a big friend of Russia\". Putin and Al Nahyan talk with each other on the phone regularly. In an official state visit to the Emirates, Putin gifted Al Nahyan a Russian gyrfalcon. The UAE also trained the first two Emirati astronauts Hazza Al Mansouri and Sultan Al Neyadi, and successfully launched the first Emirati and first Arab Astronaut Hazza Al Mansouri to the International Space Station with Russian help.\n\nUnder the leadership of Al Nahyan, the UAE built the first peaceful nuclear power reactor, the Barakah nuclear power plant, in the region. The UAE and US signed a bilateral agreement for peaceful nuclear cooperation that enhances international standards of nuclear non-proliferation.\nAl-Nahyan also represented the United Arab Emirates in the Nuclear Security Summit of 2012 and 2014, which were hosted by South Korea and the Netherlands respectively.\n\nThe Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi visited Pope Francis in 2016, and in February 2019, he welcomed the Pope Francis to the UAE, marking the first papal visit to the Arabian Peninsula. Pope Francis's arrival coincided with a conference entitled “Global Conference of Human Fraternity,” hosted under the patronage of Mohamed bin Zayed. The conference featured talks and workshops about how fostering tolerance and mutual understanding could help prevent conflict and extremism. As part of this visit, Pope Francis held the first Papal Mass to be celebrated in the Arabian Peninsula at Zayed Sports City in which 180,000 worshippers from 100 countries, including 4,000 Muslims, were present.\n\nHe has travelled around the world promoting the UAE's theme for 2019: Year of Tolerance. He has also been involved in regional and global efforts to counter violent extremism by speaking with officials in India, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, and other leaders about partnering in such efforts.\n\nIn 2019 the Zayed Global Fund for Coexistence was launched, an initiative that expounds upon the principles and goals detailed in the Human Fraternity Document signed by Pope Francis and Dr Ahmad Al Tayeb, Grand Imam of Al Azhar.\n\nMohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan heads the Abu Dhabi council for economic development (ADCED), which is the economic policy advisory council in Abu Dhabi. Al-Nahyan is also the head of the Mubadala Development Company which, since its establishment in 2002, represents the main investment vehicle for the government of Abu Dhabi. Al-Nahyan is also a Director of the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, the Sovereign wealth fund of Abu Dhabi.\n\nIn addition, he is the head of the Tawazun Economic Council, formerly known as UAE offsets programme bureau established in 1992 and is the head of the Abu Dhabi Education Council which was established in 2005. His efforts in the realm of economic development are aimed at increasing economic diversification in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi. As the head of the UAE offsets group, Al-Nahyan is involved with the task of channelling defence-related investments into profitable projects across different sectors in order to help diversify the economy of the UAE.\n\nAccording to \"The Intercept\" and referencing the hacked emails of Yousef Al Otiaba, an American citizen Khaled Hassen received a $10 million in 2013 for an alleged torture settlement after a lawsuit presented in the federal court in L.A. against three top members of the royal family of Abu Dhabi, including Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan.\n\nHe is the chairman of the Mubadala Development Company which, since its establishment in 2002, represents the main investment vehicle for the government of Abu Dhabi. Mubadala aims to cultivate long-term social and economic benefits for the Emirates through economic diversification and global investment.\n\nIn addition to this, he also serves as Head of the Abu Dhabi Council for Economic Development (ADCED), which is the main economic planning institution in the country. In this capacity, he launched the Sharaka initiative, which seeks to bolster the UAE's private sector and make it easier to conduct business and invest in Abu Dhabi. Under his leadership, ADCED has pursued numerous initiatives to increase entrepreneurship in the UAE.\n\nIn June 2018, he approved a 3-year 50 billion AED stimulus package aimed at facilitating long-term economic benefits for Emiratis and investors alike. He also commissioned a comprehensive review of building regulations in an effort to galvanize urban development.\n\nHe is the Deputy Chairman of the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA), which invests funds on behalf of the people of Abu Dhabi with the goal of diversifying and globalizing the economy. ADIA's portfolio spans more than two dozen asset classes and sub-categories.\n\nHe approved one billion AED's worth of incentive packages for agricultural technology has helped fund projects related to precision farming, agricultural robots, bio-energy, and indoor farming.\n\nMohamed bin Zayed is Vice Chairman of the Supreme Petroleum Council of Abu Dhabi National Oil Company, the primary governing body in charge of Abu Dhabi's hydrocarbon resources. He has overseen the implementation of several development and diversification strategies, particularly those relating to crude oil, gasoline, and aromatics production; gas pricing; and polyolefin capacity.\n\nIn an effort to promote tourism and to diversify the local art scene, Mohamed bin Zayed has supported the construction of art museums—including the Louvre Abu Dhabi and the upcoming Guggenheim Abu Dhabi—as well as cultural heritage sites such as Qasr Al Hosn.\n\nIn June 2009, al-Nayhan and then President Nicolas Sarkozy of France inaugurated an exhibition at the Emirates Palace Hotel, which included works of art purchased for the Louvre Abu Dhabi, as well as loans from the French national museums to mark the beginning of the construction work of the Louvre outpost, located in the cultural district in Saadiyat Island. The museum was inaugurated in November 2017.\n\nAl-Nayhan also stated that he was confident that the Guggenheim Abu Dhabi would be able to \"accumulate a prestigious art collection\" by the time of its opening in 2012.\n\nHis support extends beyond the visual arts to the oral ones. A lover of Nabati poetry, he frequently extends support to local poetry competitions, hosting some of them under his patronage.\n\nThe Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi focused on protecting nature by spearheading the UAE's efforts in protecting wild falcons, bustards, and the Arabian Oryx, and has donated $1 million to an initiative aimed at preventing the power line-related deaths of wild birds. This latter effort is part of launching of the $20-million-dollar Sheikh Mohamed Bin Zayed Raptor Conservation Foundation.\n\nAdditionally, he heads the Mohamed bin Zayed Species Conservation Fund, a philanthropic endowment established that provides targeted grants to individual species conservation initiatives, recognise leaders in the field of species conservation and elevate the importance of species in public discourse. The Fund also aims to inspire additional contributions to species conservation efforts around the world.\n\nA species of woodlizard--\"Enyalioides binzayedi\"—was named after him as the creator of the Mohamed bin Zayed Species Conservation Fund that provided financial support to the expeditions leading to the discovery of the specie in the Cordillera Azul National Park in Peru. In 2017, a rare and majestic specie of maple tree was named after him. \"Acer binzayedii\" is found in the mountainous cloud forest of Jalisco in Western México.\n\nHe has pledged $15 billion towards the development of solar, wind, and hydrogen power technologies in his country. Through Mubadala-owned facility GlobalFoundries, Al Nahyan has helped develop the UAE's semi-conductor manufacturing program, paving the way for advanced technologies, including in the energy sector.\n\nAl Nahyan has also worked on elevating the level of education in the UAE to be on par with the highest international standards, through his position as chairman of the Abu Dhabi Education Council, which was established in 2005 to develop and implement strategies for improving both private and public P-12 and higher education.\n\nAdditionally, he chairs the Emirates Center for Strategic Studies and Research (ECSSR). ECSSR furthers academic engagement with the economic, socio-political, and security issues that are relevant to the region.\n\nHe has helped foster the development of UAE's technology and encouraged a culture of innovation by sponsoring events such as the National Science, Technology and Innovation Festival. He has also founded the Mohamed bin Zayed International Robotics Challenge to transform the UAE into a regional hub for research into robotics and autonomous systems.\n\nIn 2008, the first group of Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed University scholars were selected as part of an initiative with New York University Abu Dhabi, recognising outstanding students in the United Arab Emirates and providing them with special academic and leadership opportunities.\n\nIn 2011, Al-Nahyan and the Gates Foundation pledged $50 million each to fund the purchase and delivery of vaccines for children in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Two-thirds of the total $100 million were given to the GAVI Alliance to purchase and administer the pentavalent vaccine and the pneumococcal vaccine, immunizing approximately 5 million Afghan children against six diseases. The remainder of the donation was allocated to the World Health Organization, which used it to purchase and administer the oral polio vaccine to approximately 35 million children in Afghanistan and Pakistan. The GPEI announced in April 2018 that the UAE had completed the US$120 million commitment made by Al Nahyan by dispersing the final US$12 million of the pledge made at the 2013 Global Vaccine Summit in Abu Dhabi.\n\nHis contributions to global health initiatives also include a $30 million donation to the Roll Back Malaria Partnership to help fight malaria. A month after announcing the donation, Abu Dhabi hosted a global health forum centered on efforts to eliminate worldwide diseases such as malaria, polio, and river blindness.\n\nHe has also gifted 55 million AED to the UN Global Initiative to Fight Human Trafficking.\n\nThe Zayed Charity Marathon, which takes place in New York City, has raised millions of dollars since its inauguration in 2005. The race raises awareness about kidney disease, and the proceeds go to the US's National Kidney Foundation. Al Nahyan launched the event in honor of his father, who received a kidney transplant at the Cleveland Clinic in 2000.\n\nHe has contributed to improving world health by launching the Reaching Last Mile Fund. In 2017, he launched the fund to raise $100 million with the aim of eradicating, eliminating, and controlling preventable diseases that affect the health and economic prospects of the world's poorest people.\n\nAl Nahyan committed $20 million to the Fund. Other contributors include the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the British government. The donations will be managed by the END Fund, a philanthropic investment platform focused on tackling the five most common neglected tropical diseases: river blindness, lymphatic filariasis, polio, malaria, and Guinea worm disease. In addition to this, Al Nahyan announced his intention to found an Abu Dhabi-based research institute to develop policies to combat infectious disease.\n\nUniversity of Texas chair for scientific and medical knowledge in cancer research is named after Al-Nahyan as a result of a funding grant to MD Anderson Cancer Center from Al-Nahyan to support genetic-analysis based research.\n\nA champion of female empowerment, Al Nahyan has supported their increased presence in a number of traditionally male-dominated fields. In April 2019, he welcomed a delegation of female officers from the Military and Peacekeeping Programme for Arab Women, who were undergoing training in Abu Dhabi to prepare for United Nations global peacekeeping operations. He emphasized the importance of the role female officers play in peacekeeping and security operations.\n\nHe has encouraged the presence of women in the public service sector as well. In 2019, he hosted the first certified Emirati women firefighters, emphasizing the role of women as “true partners and contributors to national development” and said they “drive strategic plans for the nation’s present and future.”\n\nFurthermore, he has made it a point to regularly meet with the female representatives of many UAE institutions to express his confidence in their ability to help the nation realize its aspirations.\n\nHe arranged specialized medical care and a transfer to the UK via a UAE air ambulance for Malala Yousafzai after she was shot in the head and neck by the Taliban in October 2012. She received long-term care at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham, UK.\n\nUnder Al Nahyan's direction, UAE officials worked closely with Pakistani authorities to arrange for Malala's specialized care and transfer. In May 2013, on her way to perform Umrah rituals, Malala stopped over in Abu Dhabi to thank the UAE and Al Nahyan for their assistance and support, noting that the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi's role highlighted the humanitarian aspects of Islamic teachings.\n\nAl Nahyan served as an officer in the Amiri Guard (now known as Presidential Guard), as a pilot in the UAE's Air Force, as Commander of the UAE Air Force and Air Defense, and as Deputy Armed Forces Deputy Chief of Staff. In 2005, he was appointed Deputy Supreme Commander of the UAE Armed Forces and was accordingly promoted to Lt. General.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Al Nahyan told Richard Clarke, then an assistant secretary of state, that he wanted to buy the F-16 fighter jet. Clarke replied that he must mean the F-16A, the model the Pentagon sold to American allies. Al Nahyan said no, he wanted a newer model he’d read about in Aviation Week, with an advanced radar-and-weapons system. Clarke told him that that model didn’t exist yet; the military hadn’t done the necessary research and development. Al Nahyan said the UAE would pay for the research and development. The subsequent negotiations went on for years, and according to Clarke “he ended up with a better F-16 than the U.S. Air Force had”.\n\nUnder Al-Nahyan's leadership, he made jujitsu compulsory in schools. In 2014 he established the military draft, forcing young Emiratis to endure a year of boot camp, initially running a pilot project within his own family and making his own daughters run as the sample size by making them endure a boot camp. He invited Maj. Gen. Mike Hindmarsh, the retired former head of Australia’s Special Operations Command, to help reorganize the Emirati military. According to the \"New York Times\", as a result of Al Nahyan's vision, the United Arab Emirates Armed Forces became the best equipped and trained military in the region apart from Israel. Under Al Nahyan's leadership, the United Arab Emirates Armed Forces also became commonly nicknamed as \"Little Sparta\" by United States Armed Forces General and former US defense secretary James Mattis as a result of their active and effective military role despite their small active personnel.\n\nAccording to a 2020 study, Al Nahyan's reforms successfully increased the effectiveness of the UAE military.\n\nA lifelong fan of falconry, the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi established the Mohamed bin Zayed Falconry and Desert Physiognomy School with the goal of promoting and sustaining the ancient tradition by teaching it to new generations of Emiratis. He himself learned the practice from his late father.\n\nIn March 2019, the Special Olympics World Games were hosted in Abu Dhabi. During the Games, Al Nahyan affirmed the importance of solidarity with and empowerment of participants during the event, as well as in their respective countries.\n\nAl Nahyan is married to Sheikha Salama bint Hamdan bin Mohammed Al Nahyan. They married in 1981. They have nine children together, four sons and five daughters.\nHis children are:\n\n\n\n\n"}

Captured, he refused to collaborate with the Germans and the Social Republic, and was interned in a prison camp on the island.\n\nNatta returned to Italy only in August 1945, and joined the PCI in Imperia, dedicating himself to the party full-time. He was in turn a Comune councillor, secretary of the local PCI federation, and in time a leading participant in the party's internal life, becoming a member of its main organs along with Luigi Longo.\n\nA strong supporter of the \"\"Italian road to Socialism\"\", he was close to Enrico Berlinguer, and gained a position in the party Secretariat. In 1969, he drew up the report proposing the expulsion from the party of the \"Manifesto\" group. In 1984, after Berlinguer's death, Natta was elected as party secretary. While still following Berlinguer's party line, he tried to improve the party's tense relations with the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. To this end he supported a trip to the Soviet Union organised by Armando Cossutta, which generated considerable controversy inside the party.\n\nNatta was confirmed as leader during the Florence Congress in 1986, but in 1988 he was forced to resign by a heart attack and was succeeded by Achille Occhetto. Along with Cossutta, he strongly opposed Occhetto's proposal in the historic \"Bolognina split\" to change the party's name. \n\nThe dissolution of the PCI subsequent to Occhetto's victory led to the birth of two different parties, the majority Democratic Party of the Left under Occhetto and the hardline minority Communist Refoundation Party founded by Cossutta, Sergio Garavini, Lucio Libertini and others. Natta, like Pietro Ingrao, chose to remain a member of the main party, as he was not optimistic about the prospects of the new communist party.\n\n"}

It was named for Benjamin Stoddert.\n\n\"Stoddert\" was laid down on 4 July 1918 at San Francisco, California, by the Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation; launched on 8 January 1919; sponsored by Mrs. Gavin McNab; and commissioned on 30 June 1920, Lieutenant Commander Norman Scott in command.\n\n\"Stoddert\" joined Division 33 of the Reserve Destroyer Squadron, Pacific Fleet, and completed fitting-out at Mare Island Navy Yard. Between 14 August 1920 and 7 January 1921, it operated along the coast of California, participating in tactical exercises with Battleship Squadron 5 and the cruiser . It also engaged in antiaircraft practice, target towing, and gun drills off Coronado Island with its own division. On 7 January 1921, it departed San Diego with the Pacific Fleet to join the Atlantic Fleet in the Panama Canal Zone for winter maneuvers farther south. From 22 January to 15 February, the combined fleets held strategic, tactical, and gunnery exercises on a cruise to Valparaíso, Chile, and back to Panama. Following the inter-fleet championships conducted at Balboa, \"Stoddert\" headed north and, on 5 March, reached San Diego, California where it resumed normal operations with Division 33.\n\nIn July, it steamed farther north to the state of Washington where it exercised with . After maneuvers off the coasts of Oregon and California, it entered Puget Sound Navy Yard on 15 December; completed overhaul on 7 February 1922; and, four days later, joined Destroyer Division (DesDiv) 32. It resumed operations along the west coast. Proceeding to the south on 8 February 1923 with the Battle Fleet and Fleet Base Force, \"Stoddert\" took part in maneuvers en route to the Panama Canal Zone to conduct fleet problems to test the defense of the strategic canal. While in Panama during the month of March, the fleet engaged in combined tactical and strategic maneuvers, held experimental torpedo practice, carried out various experimental firings against and finally sank \"Coast Battleship No. 4\", the former . Upon the completion of the combined maneuvers on 30 March, \"Stoddert\" returned to the Bremerton Navy Yard on 22 April.\n\nThe destroyer cruised the Washington coastline until the end of August, visiting Astoria, Tacoma, Seattle, Bellingham, Port Angeles, and Port Townsend. In July, it escorted , in which President Warren G. Harding was embarked. In September, it steamed south to San Diego Harbor where the destroyers of its division formed a circle and scattered flowers on the water in commemoration of the men lost in the Honda Point Disaster.\n\nFrom 22 October 1923 until 2 January 1924, \"Stoddert\" took part in fleet maneuvers and torpedo exercises at San Diego, sailing to the south on 16 January. Transiting the Panama Canal with the Battle Fleet from 18 to 25 January, it was engaged with the Scouting Fleet in maneuvers designed to test the defenses and facilities of the Canal Zone. During the winter, the combined fleets were based at Culebra, and on 22 April 1924, \"Stoddert\" arrived back at San Diego with the Battle Fleet.\n\nCruising with Battle Fleet destroyer squadrons, \"Stoddert\" operated along the west coast, principally at San Diego, San Pedro, Port Angeles, Tacoma, Seattle, and San Francisco, until 27 April 1925, on which date it arrived in Hawaii for exercises with United States Fleet. En route, the fleet engaged in a joint Army and Navy problem which simulated an attack on the Hawaiian Islands by a large overseas force and was designed to test to the fullest extent the defenses of the Hawaiian Islands.\n\nOn 1 July 1925, the destroyer sailed from Pearl Harbor with the Battle Fleet on a good will cruise via Samoa to Australia and New Zealand. The ships visited Melbourne, Dunedin, and Lyttelton, and the officers and men were extensively entertained in all these ports. This visit furthered the amicable relations existing between the United States and Australia and New Zealand. \"Stoddert\" returned to its base at San Diego on 26 September.\n\nIt resumed operations with the Battle Fleet along the west coast, taking time to attend the Navy Day celebration at San Diego from 21 to 27 October 1925 and the Founders Day festivities held at Astoria, Oregon, between 20 July and 23 July 1926. After an overhaul at the Bremerton Navy Yard, it again sailed south, via San Diego, arriving on 22 March 1927 at Balboa where it and joined the Battle Fleet. Maneuvering with the fleet at Guantanamo Bay, Gonaïves, and New York, it went on alone to the Boston Navy Yard for repairs on its way to Hampton Roads where it took part in a presidential review and rejoined its fleet. Transiting the canal between 11 and 17 June, \"Stoddert\" arrived back in San Diego on 25 June for exercises with Destroyer Squadron 11. For the remainder of 1927 and until the end of April 1928, it operated along the west coast, principally at San Diego, San Pedro, Tacoma, Port Townsend, Bremerton, and Port Angeles.\n\nIts one special assignment took it to Honolulu for emergency assistance to the Dole flight, a non-stop airplane race between San Francisco and Honolulu, starting on 16 August 1927. Upon receipt of reports of planes missing, an extensive search was started under the direction of the Commander in Chief, Battle Fleet; Commandant, 12th Naval District; and Commandant, 14th Naval District. A total of 54 ships of the Battle Fleet took part in this search between 17 August and 5 September, covering approximately .\n\nOn 28 April 1928, \"Stoddert\" arrived at Honolulu, via San Francisco, for Battle Fleet exercises at Lahaina, Pearl Harbor, and Hilo with Submarine Divisions 9 and 14.

This was in accordance with the Navy's decision to fit out a unit of three destroyers as radio-controlled light targets for the purpose of conducting Fleet exercises requiring' the use of high speed targets. \"Stoddert\", designated Light Target No. 1, received the initial installation. Its experimental radio control apparatus paved the way for later fitting out of remote-controlled and , and pointed the way for the more elaborate equipment of the famous radio-controlled target ship .\n\nIt was recommissioned on 6 April 1931; reclassified as miscellaneous auxiliary, AG-18, on 30 June 1931 and redesignated DD-302 on 16 April 1932.

{"id": "2121953", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2121953", "title": "Coingate scandal", "text": "Coingate scandal\n\nCoingate is a nickname for the Tom Noe investment scandal in Ohio revealed in early 2005 in part by Toledo, Ohio newspaper \"The Blade\". The Ohio Bureau of Workers' Compensation (BWC) invested hundreds of millions of dollars in high risk or unconventional investment vehicles run by people closely connected to the Ohio Republican Party who had made large campaign contributions to many senior Republican party officials.\n\nThe rare coin investment fund attracted particular scrutiny after it was reported that two coins worth more than $300,000 had been lost. Further investigation then revealed that coins worth $10–$12 million were missing and that only $13 million of the original $50 million invested could be accounted for. Tom Noe was convicted of running a criminal enterprise, the theft of $13 million from the fund, and of keeping a second set of books to cover for it.\n\nIn 1996, the Republican-controlled Ohio General Assembly passed a law that struck the requirement that the Ohio state government invest solely in bonds. Fund managers and other brokers then scrambled to offer their services. \n\nThe Coingate scandal centers on Tom Noe, an Ohio government figure, GOP fundraiser and coin dealer. In a separate fundraising scandal, Noe was indicted by a federal grand jury in late October 2005, charged with violating campaign contribution laws by using strawmen, or proxies, for contributions. On May 31, 2006, Noe pleaded guilty.\n\nIn March 1998, Thomas Noe Inc. was awarded a $50 million investment contract for the Ohio Workers' Compensation fund. The company received $25 million to invest in 1998, and the same again in 2001. Before this, Mr. Noe and his then managers had increased their contributions to Republican candidates by nearly 10 times. By April, according to the February 2006 indictment, Noe had already begun his illegal activities, stealing money from the investment. \"His illegal actions continued until it was shut down this past May\", the indictment said. To manage the investment, Thomas Noe Inc. used a newly created subsidiary of Noe's company Vintage Coins & Collectibles, called Capital Coin (specifically, Capital Coins Ltd. I and Capital Coins Ltd. II). Capital Coin then created subsidiaries Visionary Rare Coins, Numismatic Professionals, Rare Coin Alliance, and one named Karl D. Hirtzinger.\n\nIn 1998, Noe hired Mark Chrans to manage Visionary Rare Coins. Chrans had previously been convicted for fraud and perjury involving money-laundering in coin deals. Noe says he wasn't aware of Chrans's previous convictions. Spokesman Jeremy Jackson of the bureau said the bureau was also unaware of the convictions. In the end, Capital Coin wrote off $850,000 in losses from Visionary Rare Coins, including bad investments, unpaid loans, and advances on coin deals.\n\nIn 2003, Numismatic Professionals bought two coins for $185,000, an 1855 $3 gold coin and an 1845 $10 gold coin, thought to be worth $300,000 at market value. After sending the coins to be certified, they were stolen from the mail on the way back. Police were notified, but they could not determine how the coins were lost and closed the case.\n\nCapital Coin also loaned dealer Delaware Valley Rare Coins in Broomall, Pennsylvania, which is not owned or controlled by Noe, $300,000 from the fund, which the dealer then used for his own business. The dealer used property in New Jersey as collateral. The Ohio newspaper \"The Toledo Blade\" made a public records request to the government to view the mortgage documents. Capital Coin had redacted the records, blacking out the address of the property and the owners. The Ohio attorney general ordered Noe to release the documents, noting \"anyone pledging property as collateral to back publicly funded investments must make their name and address public.\" Lawyers for Capital Coin refused. The case was eventually settled.\n\nOnly $13 million of the original $50 million invested has been recovered to date.\n\nIn March 2006, a sealed-bid auction process was initiated to liquidate all high-risk coin and paper money assets.\n\nAttention first focused on the matter after the April 3, 2005 publication of a story by the \"Toledo Blade\".\n\nOn May 24, 2005, Thomas Noe Inc. was sued by the state of Ohio on behalf of the BWC. The judge granted the Ohio Attorney General's request to immediately freeze the assets and the BWC was given complete control of the coin funds.\n\nOhio state investigators immediately began to check inventory of the various companies, reviewing records and documents at Numismatic Professionals and another subsidiary in Sarasota, Florida. However, investigators were denied access to one of Capital Coin's subsidiaries in Monclova Township and to Delaware Valley Rare Coins. Noe said access was denied to the Ohio location because his lawyers were busy in Colorado and Florida and he said he was initially told the Ohio company was to be searched later. Noe said he neither owns nor controls Delaware Valley Rare Coins, reasoning that this is the reason investigators were denied access.\n\nThe Ohio inspector general became involved and asked to see the coins. $10–12 million worth of coins were apparently unaccounted for.\n\nOn July 13, the Ohio Supreme Court ruled 5-2 that the coin-fund records were public record and should be released, rejecting the state's argument that the information was \"trade secrets\" and exempt from the Ohio Public Records Act. The case was heard by five Ohio appellate court justices, as five of the Supreme Court justices recused themselves having accepted campaign donations from Noe. However, after two weeks, Ohio Attorney General Jim Petro had released only 3 of the 120 boxes of documents. The Toledo Blade, on July 28, filed a motion to find the state in contempt.\n\nOn July 29, The former chief of staff to Governor Bob Taft, Columbus lobbyist Brian Hicks, and his assistant, Cherie Carroll, were convicted of ethics violations in the widening Coingate scandal. Hicks was convicted of failing to disclose cut-rate vacations at Tom Noe's residence in the Florida Keys, and Carroll for accepting free meals from Noe at a downtown Columbus steakhouse.\n\nOn August 18, 2005, Governor Bob Taft pleaded no contest to four misdemeanor violations of state ethics laws. Taft admitted that over seven years he failed to report 45 golf outings provided to him, including a number of events and gifts from Noe, and was assessed a $4000 fine. It was the first time an Ohio governor was ever charged with a crime while in office.\n\nOn February 13, 2006, the Lucas County Court of Common Pleas indicted Noe, along with his business partner, Timothy LaPointe.\n\nAccording to the indictments, among other acts, Noe and LaPointe borrowed coins from other businesses and individuals and fraudulently listed those as belonging to the state during annual audits in 2002, 2003 and 2004.\n\nThe prosecution presented their case in three weeks that Noe stole $2 million for personal use; the defense argued that Noe's government contract allowed him the freedom to use the state's money however he wanted, but called no witnesses. The jury deliberated for three days before delivering their verdict.\n\nOn November 13, 2006, Noe was found guilty of theft, money laundering, forgery and corrupt activity, and the central charge that carries a ten-year mandatory minimum sentence: that he engaged in a pattern of corruption in his management of Ohio's $50 million rare-coin fund investment with the bureau.\n\nOn November 20, 2006, Noe was sentenced 18 years in state prison and ordered to pay fines and restitution. He was fined $213,000, ordered to pay an estimated $3 million for the cost of the prosecution, and ordered to pay restitution to the Ohio Bureau of Workers’ Compensation for the money missing from the rare-coin fund, estimated at $13.7 million.\n\n\n"}

Gilder was the editor of \"Representative Poems of Living Poets\" (with her brother, Joseph Benson Gilder); \"Essays from the Critic\" (with Helen Gray Cone); \"Pen Portraits of Literary Women\"; and \"The Heart of Youth, an anthology\"; as well as the owner and editor of \"The Reader: An Illustrated Monthly Magazine\". \n\nJeannette Leonard Gilder was born in Flushing, New York, October 3, 1849. She was a daughter of the clergyman William Henry Gilder, who died when she was fifteen; and Jane (Nutt) Glider. Her siblings included, Richard Watson Gilder, Joseph Benson Gilder, and William Henry Gilder.\n\nGilder was educated at St. Thomas Hall (woman's collegiate), conducted by her father; and studied at a boarding school in Southern New Jersey for a year or two. Her schooling end at the age of fifteen.\n\nDisliking the occupational options commonly open to women, she instead started working as a researcher for a historian during the Civil War before turning to the periodical industry. From 1869, she was connected with various newspapers in Newark and New York. She began newspaper work in the editorial department of the Newark, New Jersey \"Morning Register\", then conducted by her brother, Richard, and was also the Newark reporter for \"New York Tribune\". She was the New York correspondent of the \"Transcript\"; and also worked for the \"Boston Evening Transcript\", where she used the pen name \"Brunswick\". Gilder became literary editor for \"Scribner's Monthly\" before becoming a drama and music critic for the \"New York Herald\" until 1880.\n\nIn Trenton, New Jersey, she was employed at the state adjutant general's office; in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, at the US Mint; and in 1881, at Newark, New Jersey, she worked as a copyist of the registrar of deeds. In that same year, she and her brother Richard co-founded \"The Critic\", a literary magazine, where she served as an editor from January 1881 to September 1906. Her editor role with \"The Critic\" was shared with her brother Joseph. When \"The Critic\" merged with \"Putnam's Monthly\", she wrote a popular regular column for it called \"The Lounger\".\n\nGilder opposed women's right to vote. In an article titled \"Why I Am Opposed to Woman Suffrage\", printed in May 1894 in \"Harper's Bazaar\", she argued that women were not strong enough to participate in politics. It would be \"too public, too wearing, and too unfitted to the nature of women\", she wrote. She further argued that women would find a \"sufficiently engrossing 'sphere' in the very important work of training her children\". Her novels include \"The Autobiography of a Tom-boy\" (1900) and \"The Tom-boy at Work\" (1904).\n\nAlthough she had no children of her own, Gilder took in four of her brother's children after their mother's death. She was a member of the Colony Club. Gilder died January 17, 1916, at the age of 66, in her home after a stroke brought on by a formation of a blood clot on the brain.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2121979", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2121979", "title": "Jimmy Scott", "text": "Jimmy Scott\n\nJames Victor Scott (July 17, 1925 – June 12, 2014), known professionally as Little Jimmy Scott or Jimmy Scott, was an American jazz vocalist known for his high natural contralto voice and his sensitivity on ballads and love songs.\n\nAfter success in the 1940s and 1950s, Scott's career faltered in the early 1960s. He slid into obscurity before a comeback in the 1990s. His unusual singing voice was due to Kallmann syndrome, a rare genetic disorder that limited his height to until the age of 37, when he grew by . The syndrome prevented him from reaching classic puberty and left him with a high voice and unusual timbre.\n\nJames Victor Scott was born on July 17, 1925 in Cleveland, Ohio, United States. The son of Arthur and Justine Stanard Scott, he was the third child in a family of 10. As a child he got his first singing experience by his mother's side at the family piano and later in church choir. At 13, he was orphaned when his mother was killed by a drunk driver.\n\nLionel Hampton gave him the nickname \"Little Jimmy Scott\" because he looked young and was short and of slight build. His phrasing made him a favorite of artists including Billie Holiday, Ray Charles, Frankie Valli, Dinah Washington, and Nancy Wilson.\n\nHe rose to prominence as Little Jimmy Scott in the Lionel Hampton band as lead singer on \"Everybody's Somebody's Fool\", recorded in December 1949. It became a top ten R&B hit in 1950. Credit on the label went to \"Lionel Hampton and vocalists\"; Scott received no credit on any of the songs. A similar event occurred several years later when his vocal on \"Embraceable You\" with Charlie Parker, on the album \"One Night in Birdland\", was credited to the female vocalist Chubby Newsom.\n\nIn 1963 his girlfriend, Mary Ann Fisher, who sang with Ray Charles, helped him sign with Tangerine, Charles's label, and record the album \"Falling in Love is Wonderful\". The album was withdrawn while Scott was on his honeymoon because he had signed a contract with Herman Lubinsky; it would be 40 years before the album was reissued. Scott disputed the contract he had with Lubinsky, who had loaned him to Syd Nathan at King for 45 recordings in 1957–58. Another album, \"The Source\" (1969), was not released until 2001.\n\nScott's career faded by the late 1960s, and he returned to his native Cleveland to work as a hospital orderly, shipping clerk, and elevator operator. He returned to music in 1989 when manager Alan Eichler arranged for him to share a late-night bill with Johnnie Ray at New York's Ballroom. When Scott sang at the funeral of his friend, songwriter Doc Pomus, the event further renewed his career. Afterwards Lou Reed invited him to sing backup on the song \"Power and Glory\" on Reed's 1992 album \"Magic and Loss\".\n\nAlso in attendance at Pomus's funeral was Seymour Stein, founder and operator of Sire, which released Scott's 1992 album \"All the Way\", produced by Tommy Lipuma and featuring Kenny Barron, Ron Carter, and David \"Fathead\" Newman. Scott was nominated for a Grammy Award for the album.\n\nScott released \"Dream\" in 1994 and the album \"Heaven\" in 1996. His next work, an album of pop and rock interpretations entitled \"Holding Back the Years\" (1998), was produced by Gerry McCarthy and Dale Ashley. Released in the US by Artists Only in October 1998, it peaked at No. 14 on the \"Billboard\" Jazz Albums chart. In Japan, it won the \"Swing Journal\" Award for Best Jazz Album of the Year (2000). The title track marked the first time in his career that Scott overdubbed his harmony vocal tracks. \"Holding Back the Years\" features cover art by Mark Kostabi, liner notes by Lou Reed, and includes versions of \"Nothing Compares 2 U\" (written by Prince), \"Jealous Guy\" (John Lennon), \"Almost Blue\" (Elvis Costello), and \"Sorry Seems to Be the Hardest Word\" (Elton John & Bernie Taupin).\n\nIn 1999, Scott's early recordings for Decca were released on CD, as were all of his recordings with Savoy from 1952 to 1975 in a three-disc box set. In 2000, Scott signed with Milestone and recorded four albums, each produced by Todd Barkan with guests such as Wynton Marsalis, Renee Rosnes, Bob Kindred, Eric Alexander, Lew Soloff, George Mraz, Lewis Nash, and Scott's touring and recording band, The Jazz Expressions. He released two live albums recorded in Japan. During 2003–04, PBS aired \"If You Only Knew\", a documentary produced and directed by Matthew Buzell that won film festival awards and the Independent Lens award.\n\nScott and his wife Jeanie lived in Las Vegas, Nevada, after purchasing a house in 2006, having previously lived in Euclid, Ohio, for 10 years.\n\nOn May 10, 2014, Scott's final recording session took place in the living room of his home. The track was recorded for Grégoire Maret's album \"Wanted\" and was a song Maret wrote for him titled \"The 26th of May\".\n\nScott died in his sleep at his home in Las Vegas on June 12, 2014, at the age of 88. He was buried in Knollwood Cemetery in Mayfield Heights, Ohio.\n\nScott performed at the inaugurations of Presidents Eisenhower (1953) and Clinton (1993). On both occasions, Scott sang \"Why Was I Born?\". Later, he appeared with the lounge music group Pink Martini and continued to perform until his death.\n\nHe received the NEA Jazz Masters award (2007) from the National Endowment for the Arts, the Living Legend Award from the Kennedy Center, the Pioneer Award from NABOB (National Association of Black Owned Broadcasters), and the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Jazz Foundation of America (2010).\n\nScott's recording of \"If I Ever Lost You\" can be heard in the opening credits of the HBO movie \"Lackawanna Blues\". He was also mentioned on \"The Cosby Show\" (season 2, episode 25), when Clair and Cliff Huxtable bet on the year in which \"An Evening in Paradise\" was recorded. On August 17, 2013, at Cleveland State University, he was inducted into inaugural class of the R&B Music Hall of Fame.\n\nIn July 2014, shortly after his death, a portion of East 101st Street in Cleveland was renamed Jimmy Scott Way in his honor.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

While with Stirling he was called up to the provincial rugby union sides Glasgow Warriors and Caledonia Reds.\n\nWhilst playing for Stirling against Melrose, McLaren was given a 26-week ban by the Scottish Rugby Union for being found to have kicked Craig Chalmers in the head, in a ruck. Stirling County had claimed that slow-motion video evidence proved that while Chalmers had, indeed, been kicked, the act had not been deliberate. The SRU stated that it was their intent for a 26-week ban for kicking to the head to be mandatory. At the rugby union ban, McLaren once again took up rugby league.\n\nAt the time rugby league had switched to a summer sport in Britain. McLaren signed for Wakefield Trinity Wildcats in 1997.

Her research about the effects of industrial work, low wages, and long hours on workers, particularly women and child labor, had a major effect on United States labor law. In 1908, she compiled a major amicus curiae brief for the United States Supreme Court case \"Muller v.

He attended Dartmouth College, where he got his first writing job, as a film reviewer for the campus newspaper, and where he also joined the Young Communist League. He graduated from Dartmouth in 1940.\n\nIn February 1941, Bernstein was drafted into the U.S. Army. Eventually attaining the rank of Sergeant, he spent most of World War II as a correspondent on the staff of the Army newspaper \"Yank\", filing dispatches from Iran, Palestine, Egypt, North Africa, Sicily and Yugoslavia. He wrote of his experiences in Palestine in an article entitled \"War and Palestine\".\n\nBernstein wrote a number of articles and stories based on his experiences in the Army, many of which originally appeared in \"The New Yorker\". These were collected in \"Keep Your Head Down\", his first book, published in 1945.\n\nBernstein first came to Hollywood in 1947, under a ten-week contract with writer-producer-director Robert Rossen at Columbia Pictures. Following that stint, he worked for a while for producer Harold Hecht, which resulted in his first screen credit, shared with Ben Maddow, for their adaptation of the Gerald Butler novel \"Kiss the Blood Off My Hands\" for the 1948 Universal film. He subsequently returned to New York, where he continued writing for \"The New Yorker\" and other magazines, and eventually found work as a scriptwriter in the early days of live television. In 1950, because of his numerous left-wing political affiliations and related activities, his name appeared in the notorious publication Red Channels, and as a result he found himself blacklisted. Throughout the 1950s, however, he managed to continue writing for television, both under pseudonyms and through the use of \"fronts\" (non-blacklisted individuals who would permit their names to appear on his work). In this manner, he contributed to several notable TV programs of the era, including \"Danger\", the CBS News docudrama series \"You Are There\" and the mystery series \"Colonel March of Scotland Yard\". (It has been incorrectly stated in some sources that Bernstein's blacklisting resulted from \"unfriendly\" testimony given to \"HUAC\" in 1951, but in fact he was not subpoenaed by the Committee until the late 1950s, and never actually testified.)\n\nHis screenwriting career began to rebound from the blacklist when director Sidney Lumet hired him to write the screenplay for the 1959 Sophia Loren movie \"That Kind of Woman\". From then on Bernstein was able to work openly on films such as \"Paris Blues\" (1961) and \"Fail-Safe\" (1964). He also contributed, without receiving credit, to the screenplays of \"The Magnificent Seven\" (1960) and \"The Train\" (1964), and was one of several writers who worked on the script for the ill-fated \"Something's Got to Give\", which was left uncompleted at the time of the death of its star, Marilyn Monroe, in 1962.\n\"Paris Blues\" marked his first feature film collaboration with director Martin Ritt, a friend since the 1940s (and himself a victim of the Hollywood blacklist); they subsequently worked together on \"The Molly Maguires\" (1970), which Bernstein also co-produced with Ritt, and \"The Front\" (1976). The latter film, a dramatic comedy about a restaurant cashier (played by Woody Allen) with no real talent or political convictions who is hired to act as a \"front\" for blacklisted television writers during the 1950s, earned Bernstein an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Screenplay and the WGA Award for Best Drama Written Directly for the Screen. The same year, Bernstein also made a cameo appearance in Allen's film \"Annie Hall\".\n\nThe following year he was nominated for the WGA for Best Comedy Adapted from Another Medium for \"Semi-Tough\" and again in 1979 he was nominated for a BAFTA Award for Best Screenplay for \"Yanks\". In 1980, he stepped behind the camera as director of his only feature film, \"Little Miss Marker\", a remake of \"the 1934 film\" based on the Damon Runyon story of the same name. He also wrote and directed one segment of the 1991 made-for-TV movie \"\".\n\nIn 1996, Bernstein published the book \"Inside Out: A Memoir of the Blacklist\".

{"id": "2122024", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2122024", "title": "Eva Gonzalès", "text": "Eva Gonzalès\n\nEva Gonzalès (April 19, 1849 – May 6, 1883) was a French Impressionist painter.\n\nEva Gonzalès was born in Paris and became introduced to sophisticated literary and art circles at an early age by her father, writer Emmanuel Gonzalès. In 1865, at age sixteen , Eva Gonzales began her professional training and art lessons in drawing from the society portraitist Charles Chaplin. Through her father’s connections as a founding president of the Société des gens de lettres, she met a variety of members of the Parisian cultural elite, and from a young age was exposed to the new ideas surrounding art and literature at the time.\n\nGonzalès is best known for her starting out as a pupil of the artist Édouard Manet in February 1869. This relationship was formed by poor reviews that Manet received about his Salon entries, which made him hesitant to openly discuss his work; however, something about Eva's presence brought Manet out of his shell. Manet is said to have begun a portrait of her at once, which was completed in March 1870 and exhibited as \"Mlle E.G.\" at the Paris Salon in that year. Unfortunately, her debut submissions to the Salon, also in 1870, were overshadowed by the presence of Manet's portrait. In the \"Portrait of Eva Gonzales\", Manet depicts her working at an easel, yet her stiff posture and expensive dress are clearly unfit for creating artwork. This depiction of her likely caused some critics to perceive her simply as a young, decorative model who was working with an older established male painter. Gonzalès was Manet's only formal student and also modeled for several members of the Impressionist school. Manet's \"Mlle E.G.\" was discussed more than Gonzalès' oeuvre at her own 1885 retrospective and at the Galerie Daber's exhibition for her work in 1950.\n\nGonzales' style aligns very closely to that of Manet's Spanish period, slight changes were made through the years as her forms of art consisted of discipline with a sober palette. The subjects she chose to use, were a representation of everyday life, that was deeply transpired by being under Chaplin's guidance.\n\nDuring 1871, Manet pursued the incorporation of the more brilliant colors and active surfaces of the Impressionists within his work. Meanwhile, Gonzales decided to retain the neutral color schemes and precise contours of the sixties, while leaving her pastels in softer tones that created a lighter palette for her to work with. Gonzales' work may not be regarded as innovative, but it still holds charm and a sense of sincere personal expression that gives it significant value. Despite her association of being one of Manet's student, her work still carries meaning and progressing in the direction that perfectly aligned with her temperament.\n\nGonzalès' work was celebrated by Salon reviewers for the inherent intuition with which she approached art, as well as her technical skill. At one point she listed herself as a student of Charles Chaplin with her submissions to the Salon, perhaps as a method to be taken more seriously. Much of her work became characterized through Salon reviews with the discussion of her \"feminine technique\" and her \"seductive harmony.\" However, her large-scale painting, \"Box at the Théâtre des Italiens\" (1874), was characterized by the Salon jury as having \"masculine vigor,\" which led them to reject it with questions as to her painting's authenticity. Nevertheless, her work was reviewed positively by a variety of critics. Louis Leroy, Jules Castagnary, and Émile Zola praised the work she successfully showed at the Salons. Furthermore, the art critic Maria Deraismes championed Gonzalés for producing paintings which challenged the way female painters were viewed and separated from the art scene in Paris.\n\nLike Édouard Manet, Gonzalès never exhibited in the Impressionist exhibitions in Paris, but she is considered part of the group because of her painting style. While studying under Manet, Gonzalès' self-portraits suggest that she was exploring her individuality and identity as an artist by presenting subtle correctives to Manet's version of her. Until 1872, she was strongly influenced by Manet but later developed her own, more personal style. This can be seen in works such as \"Enfant de Troupe\" (1870), which is a nod to Manet's \"Le Fifre\" (1866), while many of her later paintings involved portraits of her sister, Jeanne. It was common of Gonzales to use her family members, particularly her husband and her sister, Jeanne Gonzalès, as models in her work.\n\nIn 1879, after a three-year engagement, she married Henri Guérard, a graphic artist and Manet's engraver. The couple had a son named Jean Raimond in April 1883, shortly before receiving news of the death of Manet. During the Franco-Prussian War she sought refuge in Dieppe.\n\nHer work was exhibited at the offices of the art review \"L'Art\" in 1882 and at the Galerie Georges Petit in 1883.\n\nIn 1883, Gonzelès died in childbirth at the age of thirty-four, five days after the death of her teacher, Edouard Manet, which left her son to be raised by his father and her sister, Jeanne, who later became Guerard's second wife. Since her death, exhibitions of Gonzales work were held at the Salons de La Vie Moderne (1885), the Salon d'Automne (1907), at several galleries in Paris. Her work has also been exhibited in 1952 at the Musée National des Beaux-Arts, Monte Carlo.\n\nEva Gonzales' paintings have been purchased by the French government along with private collectors. Out of all her works, the broadest representation of her oeuvre can be spotted in the collection of her son and his heirs.\n\nSome other accomplishments that she has had throughout her career , include the newspaper \"L'Art\" purchasing her pastels and receiving recognition in England, Belgium, and France.\n\nBayle, Paule, \"Eva Gonzales,\" \"La Renaissance,\" June 1932.\n\nMathey, Francois, \"Six femmes peintres,\" Paris, 1951, 8.\n\nMonaco, \"Eva Gonzales exposition,\" catalog by Claude Roger -Marx, 1952.\n\nMoreau- Nelaton, E.., \"Manet raconte par luimeme,\" Paris, 1926, I.\n\nParis , Salons de la Vie Moderne, Catalogue des peinntures et pastels de Eva Gonzales, preface by Philippe Burty, essay by Theodore de Banville, 1885.\n\nParis, Galerie Bernheim- Jeune, \"Eva Gonzales,\" 1914.\n\nParis, Galerie Marcel Bernheim, \"Eva Gonzales, exposition retrospective,\" catalog by Paul Bayle, 1932.\n\nParis, Galerie Daber, \"Eva Gonzales retrospective,\" catalog by Alfred Daber, 1959.\n\nRoger-Marx, Claude, \"Eva Gonzales,\" short essay by Theodore de Banville, Paris, 1950.\n\n\"Little Soldier\"\n\nExhibitions:\n\nSalon of 1870: \"Eva Gonzales retrospective,\"\n\nGalerire Daber, Paris, 1959.\n\nLiterature:\n\nKarl Berrand, \" Salon de 1870,\" \"L' artiste,\"\n\nApril–June 1870, 319; Roger-Marx, n.p.,\n\nRewald, 240-41 and note 4, 268; Genevieve Lacambre and Jacqueline Rohan-Chabot, \"Le Musee de Luxembourg en 1874,\" Paris, 1974.\n\n\n"}

After World War II, he became one of the leading members of the party, representing the most pro-Soviet Union tendency; his belief in that country as the \"\"Leading state\"\" of communism led him to criticise Enrico Berlinguer. Later in life, although he did not regret the choice he made, Cossutta considered that he was mistaken in opposing Berlinguer.\n\nOpposed to Achille Occhetto's 1991 proposal to dissolve the PCI, he founded, together with Sergio Garavini, Nichi Vendola and some others, the Communist Refoundation Party, of which he became the president. When Fausto Bertinotti, secretary of the party, voted against a motion of confidence to the 1996 government of Romano Prodi, Cossutta opposed his stance, and left the party along with Oliviero Diliberto and others to found the Party of Italian Communists.\n\nAfterwards, Cossutta was president of the Party of Italian Communists, and Member of Parliament.

{"id": "2122036", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2122036", "title": "WNVT", "text": "WNVT\n\nWNVT, virtual channel 23.3 (UHF digital channel 42), is a World Channel-affiliated television station licensed to Spotsylvania Courthouse, Virginia, United States and serving the Richmond metropolitan area. The station's transmitter is located in the Richmond suburb of Bon Air in Chesterfield County. WNVT is operated in a pair with Culpeper-licensed WNVC (virtual channel 41.3, UHF digital channel 46), which serves the Charlottesville area from a transmitter atop Carters Mountain. The two stations are owned by Richmond-based Commonwealth Public Broadcasting Corporation.\n\nWNVT first signed on March 1, 1972 on channel 53 as Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) member station \"Northern Virginia Public TV\". The station was licensed to Goldvein, Virginia and served the Virginia side of the Washington, D.C. television market. \n\nCommonwealth Public Broadcasting Corporation, then known as the Central Virginia Educational Television Corporation, purchased the station in 1974. \n\nAs WNVT's transmitter was located in Independent Hill, Virginia, in rural Prince William County to the south of the Washington metropolitan area, reception in the more populated portions of Northern Virginia was difficult. Translator W14AA went on the air from Arlington in 1976 to increase coverage. WNVT began building WNVC in 1981, and received special permission to broadcast Congressional hearings over W14AA.\n\nWNVT originally operated from Northern Virginia Community College. When the station was under construction, the school offered an associate of arts in broadcast engineering technology.\n\nFairfax-licensed WNVC signed on in May 1983 on channel 56, after being known as WIAH during the construction process. W14AA was sold in late 1981 and still broadcasts today as WMDO-CD. As the Washington market already had two full-service PBS stations in WETA-TV and WMPT, WNVC did not operate as a repeater of WNVT. Instead, it continued W14AA's coverage of Congress, along with State Department briefings, the Virginia General Assembly, county and local governments, school boards and fire districts. At the time, WNVC was billed as the only public television station independent of PBS in the nation.\n\nOn weekends in the late 1980s, WNVC had an unusual reputation for sports coverage. The station showed as many syndicated college basketball games as possible, including from the NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament in the era before every game was on national television. As there was generally only demand for Big East and Atlantic Coast Conference games in Washington, WNVC picked up games from major and minor conferences in other regions for relatively low cost. Its noncommercial status in turn freed it from the prospect of having to sell advertising for games that were likely to draw microscopic audiences. Director of development Mike Baker went on air during commercial breaks and halftimes with live appeals for donations. This stream of programming began to dry up in the early 1990s, when CBS and ESPN began national coverage of the entire tournament and increased coverage of regular-season games.\n\nWNVC rebranded as \"World View TV\" on September 1, 1994, carrying international television programming in multiple languages and local ethnic programming on the weekends. At launch, the station's most popular program was the Russian state newscast \"Vremya\", shown live at 9 p.m. Moscow Time (1 p.m. Eastern). \n\nWNVT continued as a standard PBS member station through 1999. Beginning January 1, 2000, WNVT disaffiliated from PBS, reverting to an educational independent station during the day. WNVT also began relaying Canadian cable-television channel MuchMusic in afternoons and evenings.\n\nIn 2001, the two stations became known as MHz Networks, with WNVC becoming MHz1 and WNVT becoming MHz2. WNVT's daily educational programming was branded as \"MHz Learn\", and it continued relaying MuchMusic in the evenings. \n\nIn 2003, WNVT became digital-only on channel 30 due to the cost of running both analog and digital signals simultaneously in its largely rural coverage area. The station dropped MuchMusic in 2003 for the Russian-language programming service \"Russian World TV\". The Russian programming was dropped in 2005.\n\nWNVC signed on its digital signal on channel 57 later in 2004. On September 1, 2008, WNVC ceased broadcasting in analog permanently and took its digital signal silent temporarily to relocate to channel 24. Rather than continuing with their own programming lineups, the two stations placed a total of eight digital subchannels on their two signals, largely consisting of relays of international satellite channels. The lineup expanding to ten on June 12, 2009 and the current twelve on August 1, 2012. Both stations changed their virtual channel number to 30, with WNVC broadcasting 30.1 through 30.6 due to its better coverage of the Washington metropolitan area, and WNVT broadcasting 30.7 through 30.12.\n\nMHz Networks' national multicast channel MHz WorldView was always carried on 30.1. The last set of channels included TRT World, CGTN America, CGTN Documentary, Africa Today TV, France 24, CNC World, Arirang, TeleSUR, Deutsche Welle, and Vietnet. Previous channels included NHK World, BVN, Al Jazeera English, Blue Ocean Network, SABC News International, NTA, Ethiopian Television, RT America, RT Spanish, VTV4, Euronews, CNC World, and TRT Türk. Two months before the end of broadcast operations in Washington, on February 1, 2018, RT America was dropped from WNVC's signal, apparently due to concerns that MHz Networks or CPBC would be required to register under the Foreign Agents Registration Act.\n\nIn 2013, Commonwealth Public Broadcasting Corporation spun off the MHz Networks unit and sold the WNVC and WNVT towers. CPBC remained in control of the stations' licenses and MHz Networks programmed them under contract. \n\nCPBC announced on March 31, 2017 that it had sold the licenses of WNVC and WNVT in the Federal Communications Commission's ongoing spectrum reallocation auction for $182 million. CPBC did not see a need to continue running the two over-the-air signals, as the Washington market is already served by public television stations WETA-TV, WHUT-TV, and WMPT, and it would prefer to focus on local and PBS programming. \n\nBoth stations indicated they would continue over-the-air operations by sharing the channel of another station. CPBC stated it would attempt to find an in-market sharing partner, but was unable to do so, instead choosing to share with its own WCVE-TV in Richmond and its Charlottesville satellite WHTJ.\n\nThe two stations suspended operations from their existing transmitter sites in Independent Hill (WNVT) and Merrifield (WNVC) at midnight on March 31, 2018 and immediately moved to the transmitters of their respective sharing partners. The stations' cities of license were required to remain in the Washington market and moved to Spotsylvania Courthouse and Culpeper, respectively. Responsibility for programming the stations reverted to CPBC.\n\nMHz Networks announced that it would move its twelve streams of programming to local cable operators. However, cable providers were not willing to carry the channels without the force of must-carry rules that apply to over-the-air stations, and MHz was unable to reach a deal to lease subchannels from another station. Consequently, MHz WorldView became unavailable over-the-air in the broadcaster's home market. The company has since announced it would shut down its over-the-air service on March 1, 2020. On February 3, WNVT and WNVC converted to being member stations of World Channel, a news/documentary network that is also aired on most PBS member stations.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2122055", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2122055", "title": "Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr", "text": "Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr\n\nMuhammad ibn Abi Bakr () was the son of Abu Bakr and a companion of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. His mother was Asma bint Umays, who was a widow of Ja'far ibn Abi Talib prior to her second marriage with Abu Bakr. He became the adopted son of Ali, the fourth Rashidun Caliph and the first Imam of Shia Muslims, and became one of his generals.\n\nHe was a son of Abū Bakr aṣ-Ṣiddīq from his marriage with Asma bint Umays. When Abu Bakr died, Asma bint Umays married Ali bin Abi Talib. Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr had a son named, Qasim ibn Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr. Qasim ibn Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr's wife was called Asma and she was the daughter of Abdu'l-Rahman ibn Abu Bakr who was Abu Bakr's other son. The daughter of Qasim ibn Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr and Asma was called Fitima (Umm Farwah)..\n\nAfter the Battle of Siffin, Ali ibn Abi Talib appointed Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr as the Governor of Egypt, then a newly conquered province of the Islamic empire. In 658 CE (38 A.H.), Mu'awiya ibn Abi Sufyan, the then Governor of Syria, sent his general 'Amr ibn al-'As and six thousand soldiers against Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr. He hadn't proved himself to be a good governor, Lazley hazleton writes \"Muhammad AbuBakr - Aisha's half brother-had proved a weak governor. Ali himself ruefully acknowledged that he was \"an inexperienced young man\". Muhammad asked Imam Ali for help. Ali is said to have instructed his foster son to hand the governorship over to his best general and childhood friend, Malik al-Ashtar, whom he judged better capable of resisting Amr ibn al-As. However, Malik died on his way to Egypt. The Shi'a and Institute for Shia Ismaili Studies in London's Shia'ism researcher Wilferd Madelung believe that Malik was poisoned by Muawiyah I.\n\nIbn Abu Bakr was eventually defeated by 'Amr ibn al-'As. 'Amr's soldiers were ordered to capture him and bring him alive, to Muawiyah I. However, a soldier named Mu'awiya ibn Hudayj is said to have quarreled with the prisoner and killed him out of hand. Ibn Hudayj was so incensed at Ibn Abu Bakr that he put his body into the skin of a dead donkey and burned both corpses together, so that nothing should survive of his enemy. However, Shi'a accounts say that the Muawiyah I who later became the first Umayyad Caliph was the actual killer of Ibn Abu Bakr. His grave is located in a mosque in Cairo, Egypt.\n\nMuhammad ibn Abu Bakr was a pious Muslim who supported the Rightly Guided Caliph, Ali ibn Abi Talib. He had spent considerable time in Egypt and was part of the delegation that complained about the activities of the governor of Egypt to the third Caliph Uthman ibn Affan. The Caliph promised to immediately dismiss the Egyptian governor and replace him with Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr. However, after sensing betrayal from Uthman ibn Affan (but actually perpetrated by Marwan ibn al-Hakam) against the Muslim petitioners from Egypt, Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr rushed back with the petitioners to Madinah where he initially took part in the uprising against Uthman ibn Affan. After realizing his error in getting involved in the Siege of Uthman, he repented and withdrew from the uprising, although he had already led the group of rebels inside Uthman ibn Affan's residence.\n\nThe history is related as follows:\n\nA group of seven hundred Egyptians came to complain to Caliph Uthman ibn Affan about their governor Ibn Abi Sarh's tyranny, so Uthman ibn Affan said: \"Choose someone to govern you.\" They chose Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr, so Uthman ibn Affan wrote credentials for him and they returned. On their way back, at three days' distance from Madinah, a messenger caught up with them with the news that he carried orders from Uthman ibn Affan to the governor of Egypt. They searched him and found a message from Uthman ibn Affan to ibn Abu Sarh ordering the death of Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr and some of his friends. They returned to Madinah and besieged Uthman ibn Affan. Uthman ibn Affan acknowledged that the camel, the servant, and the seal on the letter belonged to him, but he swore that he had never written nor ordered the letter to be written. It was discovered that the letter had been hand-written by Marwan ibn al-Hakam.\n\nThe Shi'a highly praise Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr for his devotion to `Ali and his resistance to the other rulers who were usurpers. Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr was a pious Muslim who supported the Imam of his time, Ali ibn Abi Talib, even though his sister Aisha opposed `Ali in the battle of Jamal, Ibn Abu Bakr was faithful to his stepfather. And he was in Ali's army in the Battle of Jamal and later it was Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr who escorted Aisha back to Madina. His grand daughter Fatima \"(Umm Farwah)\" was wife of Imam Muhammad al-Baqir. Thus Shia Imam after Imam Muhammad al-Baqir were his descendants from the mother side, starting with the great legal doctor of the Shia, Hanafi and Maliki Sunnis, Imam Ja'far al-Sadiq .\n\nAccording to a Shia Muslim author:\n\n`Ali loved Muhammad Ibn Abu Bakr as his own son and his death was felt as another terrible shock. `Ali prayed for him, and invoked God's blessings and mercy upon his soul.\n\nBoth of Abu Bakr's sons Abdu'l-Rahman ibn Abu Bakr and Mohammed ibn Abu Bakr openly opposed Muawiya\n\nThe appointment of Yazid was unpopular in Madina. Sahih Al Bukhari Volume 6, Book 60, Number 352, Narrated by Yusuf bin Mahak:\n\nMarwan had been appointed as the governor of Hijaz by Muawiya. He delivered a sermon and mentioned Yazid bin Muawiya so that the people might take the oath of allegiance to him as the successor of his father (Muawiya). Then 'Abdur Rahman bin Abu Bakr told him something whereupon Marwan ordered that he be arrested. But 'Abdur-Rahman entered 'Aisha's house and they could not arrest him. Marwan said, \"It is he ('AbdurRahman) about whom Allah revealed this Verse: 'And the one who says to his parents: 'Fie on you! Do you hold out the promise to me..?'\" On that, 'Aisha said from behind a screen, \"Allah did not reveal anything from the Qur'an about us except what was connected with the declaration of my innocence (of the slander).\"\n\nIbn Katheer wrote in his book the Al-Bidayah wan-Nihayah \nthat \"in the year 56 AH Muawiyah called on the people including those within the outlying territories to pledge allegiance to his son, Yazeed, to be his heir to the Caliphate after him. Almost all the subjects offered their allegiance, with the exception of Abdur Rahman bin Abu Bakr (the son of Abu Bakr), Abdullah ibn Umar (the son of Umar), al-Husain bin Ali (the son of Ali), Abdullah bin Az-Zubair (The grandson of Abu Bakr) and Abdullah ibn Abbas (Ali's cousin). Because of this Muawiyah passed through al-Madinah on his way back from Makkah upon completion of his Umrah Pilgrimage where he summoned each one of the five aforementioned individuals and threatened them. The speaker who addressed Muawiyah sharply with the greatest firmness amongst them was Abdurrahman bin Abu Bakr as-Siddeeq, while Abdullah bin Umar bin al-Khattab was the most soft-spoken amongst them.\n\nTheir sister Asmā' bint Abu Bakr was just as out spoken. Asma's son, Abdullah, and his cousin, Qasim ibn Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr, were both grandsons of Abu Bakr and nephews of Aisha. When Hussein ibn Ali was killed in Karbala, Abdullah, who had been Hussein's friend, collected the people of Mecca and made the following speech:\n\nO people! No other people are worse than Iraqis and among the Iraqis, the people of Kufa are the worst. They repeatedly wrote letters and called Imam Hussein to them and took \"bay'at\" (allegiance) for his caliphate. But when Ibn Zeyad arrived in Kufa, they rallied around him and killed Imam Hussein who was pious, observed the fast, read the Quran and deserved the caliphate in all respects.\n\nAfter his speech, the people of Mecca also joined Abdullah to take on Yazid. When he heard about this, Yazid had a silver chain made and sent to Mecca with the intention of having Walid ibn Utbah arrest Abdullah ibn al-Zubayr with it. In Mecca and Medina Hussein's family had a strong support base, and the people were willing to stand up for them. Hussein's remaining family moved back to Madina. Eventually Abdullah consolidated his power by sending a governor to Kufa. Soon Abdullah established his power in Iraq, southern Arabia, the greater part of Syria and parts of Egypt.\n\nYazid tried to end Abdullah's rebellion by invading the Hejaz, and he took Medina after the bloody Battle of al-Harrah followed by the siege of Mecca. But his sudden death ended the campaign and threw the Umayyads into disarray, with civil war eventually breaking out. This essentially split the Islamic empire into two spheres. After the Umayyad civil war ended, Abdullah lost Egypt and whatever he had of Syria to Marwan I. This, coupled with the Kharijite rebellions in Iraq, reduced his domain to only the Hejaz.\n\nAbdullah ibn al-Zubayr was finally defeated by Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan, who sent Al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf. Hajjaj was from Ta'if, as were those who had killed Hussein. In his last hour, Abdullah asked his mother Asma what he should do. Asma replied to her son:\nYou know better in your own self that if you are upon the truth and you are calling towards the truth go forth, for people more honourable than you were killed and have been killed, and if you are not upon the truth, then what an evil son you are, you have destroyed yourself and those who are with you. If you say what you say, that you are upon the truth and you will be killed at the hands of others then you will not truly be free, for this is not the statement of someone who is free... How long will you live in this world, death is more beloved to me than this state you are on, this state of weakness.\n\nThen Abdullah said to his mother after she had told him to go forth and fight: \"I am afraid I will be mutilated by the people of Sham. I am afraid that they will cut up my body after they have killed me.\" She said: \"After someone has died, it won't make any difference what they do to you if you have been killed.\" Abdullah said to his mother:\n\nI did not come to you except to increase myself in knowledge. Look and pay attention to this day, for verily, I am a dead man. Your son never drank wine, nor was he fornicator, nor did he wrong any Muslim or non-Muslim, nor was he unjust. I am not saying this to you to show off or show how pure I am but rather as an honour to you.\nAbdullah then left by himself on his horse to take on Hajjaj. Hajjaj's army defeated and Abdullah on the battlefield in 692. He beheaded him and crucified his body. He said, \"No one must take down his body except Asma. She must come to me and ask my permission, and only then will his body be taken down.\" Asma refused to go and ask permission to take down her son's body. It was said to her, \"If you don't go, his body will remain like that.\" She said, \"Then let it be.\" Eventually Hajjaj came to her and asked, \"What do you say about this matter?\" She replied, \"Verily, you have destroyed him and you have ruined his life, and with that you have ruined your hereafter.\"\n\nThe defeat of Abdullah ibn al-Zubayr re-established Umayyad control over the Empire.\n\n\n\n"}

The book is a biography of the Thoroughbred racehorse Seabiscuit. It won the William Hill Sports Book of the Year and was adapted as a feature film in 2003. It has also been published under the title: \"Seabiscuit: The True Story of Three Men and a Racehorse.\" The author has been praised for her ability to convey a sense of historical times. The 2003 film \"Seabiscuit\" was adapted from the book.\n\n\"Seabiscuit: An American Legend\" enjoyed near universal acclaim, with most praise centering on the compelling nature of the story and expert storytelling of Hillenbrand, who had done much research. Praising her accounts of the races, the \"Sports Illustrated\" writer Ron Fimrite said, \"She writes about the confusion, turbulence and artistry of a race with the same grasp of sound and movement that Whitney Balliett brings to jazz in his 'New Yorker' profiles [...] no mean accomplishment.\" The \"Economist\" found \"the research is meticulous, the writing elegant and concise, so that every page transports you back to the period,\" and Jim Squires of the \"New York Times\" likewise called her research \"meticulous.\" \"Newsweek\" noted that \"what chiefly distinguishes this account is the straightforward pleasure Hillenbrand takes in the accomplishments of her heroes, two-footed and four-footed alike.\" \"People\" magazine said that \"Hillenbrand's jargon-free language makes the races--and the period--exhilarating.\" More conservatively, Karen Valby with \"Entertainment Weekly\" found \"Hillenbrand's account ... saddled by loosely connected anecdotes and confused scene-setting,\" finally giving the book a grade of a \"B\". William Nack, the author of \"Secretariat: The Making of a Champion\", stated: \"You had clearly created a world, and you had done so with a distinctly lyrical feel and touch.\" \n\n\n"}

It is the taller of a two tower complex that contains class-A office space connected at ground level by a two-story promenade containing retail space connecting to the shorter Hyatt Regency Albuquerque hotel tower. At 22 stories it is the tallest building in New Mexico. The hotel tower, with 20 \nstories, is the state's second tallest building at . Their similar height, color, and pyramidal roofs make them the focal point of the Albuquerque skyline.\n\nAlbuquerque Plaza complex was designed by Hellmuth, Obata & Kassabaum and built in 1990.\n\nThe Albuquerque Plaza development was built by BetaWest Properties, a commercial real estate subsidiary of US West and sister company of the Mountain Bell telephone company. The company was planning a new office tower to replace the old Mountain Bell building, which was originally built in 1953 as a Fedway department store and was notable for having New Mexico's first escalator. Concurrently, the city was planning a major expansion of the Albuquerque Convention Center and convinced BetaWest to add a luxury hotel to the proposed development. In order to secure the hotel deal, the city gave BetaWest $10 million in loans, a seven-year exemption on property taxes for the hotel, and a three-year catering concession for the convention center. Designed by HOK Architects, the planned development consisted of a 22-story office tower and 20-story hotel tower connected by a shared base. Construction began in early 1988 with the demolition of the Mountain Bell building and was completed in the summer of 1990. The total cost of the project was $100 million.\n\nWith the real estate market struggling in the early 1990s, US West began selling off many of its commercial properties. Both of the Albuquerque Plaza towers were sold to Crescent Real Estate Equities of Fort Worth in 1995 for $69 million, though US West kept its offices in the building. In 2005 the office tower was sold to a local investment group, now under the umbrella of Allegiance Realty of Charlotte, North Carolina. Meanwhile, the Hyatt was sold to an out-of-state investor. In 2013, Allegiance was able to purchase the hotel tower as well, putting both towers back under the same ownership.\n\nAlbuquerque Plaza is tall and has 22 stories, making it New Mexico's tallest building by both height and floor count. The tower, roughly square in plan with angular projections, is situated at the southeast corner of the block and contains of class-A office space. It rises 20 stories above a two-story base which is shared with the Hyatt Regency hotel. The first floor contains a retail promenade, while the second floor houses banquet and conference rooms. The complex was designed by HOK Architects and is an example of postmodern architecture. It is constructed from reinforced concrete with pink granite trim, and both towers are capped with distinctive pyramidal roofs which contain mechanical equipment.\n\nAt the building's main entrance is a bronze sculpture by Glenna Goodacre called \"Sidewalk Society\" which depicts nine life-sized people engaged in various activities on the street corner. The sculpture was commissioned by the building's developer and unveiled in 1991. The racial politics of the piece have attracted some criticism, especially a scene apparently depicting a Hispanic man with a hard hat being given instructions by a white supervisor, but the overall reception of the work was mostly positive.\n\nWhen it opened, the building's main tenant was US West, occupying floors 4–12. Several other floors were occupied by law firms. By 1995, other major tenants included Bank of America and General Services Administration (GSA) offices. From 1998 to 2015, the building contained the headquarters of Bank of Albuquerque, a subsidiary of BOK Financial. Another large tenant was the Bureau of Indian Affairs, which left in 2007. In 2015, the building reportedly housed around 25 office tenants with about 800 employees, including several major local law firms as well as the GSA offices.\n\nFrom 1991 to 1998, the tower had a Bank of America logo to go along with the bank branch on the first floor. In 1998 the branch was one of several included in a government-mandated sale to BOK Financial, establishing the subsidiary Bank of Albuquerque. The Bank of Albuquerque logo was replaced with the current U.S. Eagle Federal Credit Union signage in 2015.\n\nIn addition to providing downtown Albuquerque with of commercial office space, the tallest building in New Mexico is also one of the state’s most sustainable structures. Albuquerque Plaza, utilizes a hybrid thermal energy storage system from CALMAC. The system helps alleviate the building’s dependence on the electric grid, cut carbon emissions and reduces the energy required to cool its occupants. For over 20 years, shifting the electric demand used to cool the building from on-peak to off-peak hours has saved the property over on electric utility bills. In 2002, the Bank of Albuquerque Tower was awarded BOMA’s “Office Building of the Year” award, which considers energy conservation as part of its judging criteria.\n\n"}

Much of his life was spent living abroad.\n\nHe was born at Pavlovsk, Imperial Russia, son of George I of Greece and his queen, Olga, a Russian grand duchess by birth. He was the youngest of their eight children, being twenty years younger than their oldest child, Constantine. He was called \"Christo\" in the family. His older brothers were future King Constantine I, George, Nicholas and Andrew. Prince Christopher’s nephew Philip, son of his brother Andrew, married the future Queen Elizabeth II, then Princess Elizabeth.\n\nChristopher, like his siblings, was a polyglot, speaking Greek, English, Danish, Russian, French, and Italian. The siblings spoke Greek to one another, and used English with their parents. The parents, however, spoke German to each other.\n\nThe Greek royal family maintained close relations with the Danish royal family, to which they also officially belonged. The Hellenic royal line was a cadet branch of the Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg dynasty which had mounted the throne of Denmark in 1863.\n\nWhen Christopher came of age he joined the Hellenic Navy, although apparently he would rather have studied the piano. While a young man, he was apparently offered no fewer than three different thrones - those of Portugal, Lithuania, and Albania - but he declined them all, as he did not wish the stress of royal duties.\n\nHe was briefly engaged to Princess Alexandra, 2nd Duchess of Fife in about 1910 (Alexandra's mother, Princess Louise, Duchess of Fife, was a daughter of King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra of the United Kingdom, herself an older sister of George I of Greece, Christopher's father). The engagement was terminated when disapproving parents learned of the liaison.\n\nOn 1 January 1920, Christopher married a very wealthy American widow, Nonnie May \"Nancy\" Stewart Worthington Leeds, at Vevey, Switzerland. His bride, a once-divorced and once-widowed commoner at least a decade older than the prince, was nonetheless recognised as Christopher's dynastic wife by his family (at the time of the engagement and wedding, the Greek royal family lived frugally in exile, and as Christopher was last in the dynasty's order of succession, any children he fathered would not impact the succession rights of other Greek dynasts). Her fortune, estimated in the tens of millions of dollars, was inherited from her second husband, a tin millionaire, and substantially eased the Greek royal family's exile during the 1920s. The wedding followed a six-year engagement while the royal court-in-exile negotiated the terms and arrangements of the marriage.\n\nShortly after their marriage, Princess Anastasia developed cancer, and died in London on 29 August 1923, leaving no children from this marriage. Prince Christopher did, however, have a stepson, William Bateman Leeds Jr (1902–1971), who had, in 1921, married Princess Xenia Georgievna of Russia. She was Christopher's niece through his elder sister, Marie of Greece, Grand Duchess George of Russia.\n\nPrince Christopher later remarried; his second wife was Princess Françoise of Orléans (25 December 1902 – 25 February 1953).\n\nFrançoise was a daughter of Jean d'Orléans, Duc de Guise, Orléanist pretender to the throne of France, by his wife/first cousin, Isabelle d'Orléans. Isabelle was, in turn, a daughter of Philippe, Comte de Paris by his wife and first cousin, Infanta Isabel de Orléans y Borbon.\n\nThe couple were married in 1929 in Palermo, Italy; the civil ceremony was on 10 February, and the religious one on 11 February. They were childless for a decade, then one child was born to Françoise: Prince Michael of Greece and Denmark was born in Rome in 1939, shortly before Prince Christopher's death.\n\nIn 1927, Prince Christopher paid a visit to the Long Island home of William and Xenia Leeds, who were his step-son and niece, respectively. Xenia had taken an interest in the strange case of a woman, Anna Anderson, who claimed to be Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia, youngest daughter of the last Tsar of Russia, Nicholas II.\n\nAs Prince Christopher explained, \"That was her story, and, fantastic as it was, there were many who believed then − and still believe − in her, among them one or two members of the Imperial Family.\" He went on, \"Dozens of people who had known the Grand Duchess Anastasia were brought to see the girl in the hope that they might be able to identify her, but none of them could come to any definite conclusion.\" Prince Christopher described her, \"In the first place she was unable to speak Russian, which the Grand Duchess Anastasia, like all the Czar's children, had talked fluently − and would only converse in German.\"\n\nSumming up, he said of her, \"The poor girl was a pathetic figure in her loneliness and ill health, and it was comprehensible enough that many of those around her let their sympathy over-rule their logic... She was unable to recognise people whom the Grand Duchess Anastasia had known intimately, and her descriptions of rooms in the different palaces and of other scenes familiar to any of the Imperial Family were often inaccurate.\"\n\nPrince Christopher recorded his thoughts on monarchy and those aspiring to it: \"Nothing under the sun would induce me to accept a Kingdom. A crown is too heavy a thing to be put on lightly. It has to be worn by those born to that destiny, but that any man should willingly take on the responsibility, not being constrained by duty to do so, passes my comprehension.\" \n\nPrince Christopher of Greece died on 21 January 1940, aged 51.\n\n\n"}

From colonial times, the sole official language was English, but the 1997 Constitution gave equal status, for the first time, to Fijian and Hindustani, alongside English.\n\nThere is considerable debate as to whether Fijian, and possibly also Hindi, should be compulsory school subjects. In May and June 2005, a number of prominent Fiji Islanders called for the status of Fijian to be upgraded; the present Education Minister, Ro Teimumu Kepa endorsed calls for it to be made compulsory, as did Great Council of Chiefs Chairman Ratu Ovini Bokini. Similar calls came from Misiwini Qereqeretabua, the Director of the Institute of Fijian Language and Culture, and from Apolonia Tamata, a linguistics lecturer at Suva's University of the South Pacific, who both said that recognition of the Fijian language is essential to the nation's basic identity, as a unifying factor in Fiji's multicultural society.\n\nFiji Labour Party (FLP) leader Mahendra Chaudhry also endorsed the call for Fijian to be made a national language and a compulsory school subject, provided that the same status be given to Hindi - a position echoed by Krishna Vilas of the National Reconciliation Committee.\n\nAcademic and former Education Minister Taufa Vakatale said that she supported making Hindi available in all schools, but considered that Fijian should get priority. \"\"If the Indians in the country lost their language, there is a whole continent of people in India who would still have the language,\"\" she said. \"\"In the whole world only 330,000 people know how to speak in Fijian and if it is lost, there is nowhere it can be revived from, that is why the Fijian language is very important to preserve.\"\"\n\nA investigation by the Rewa Provincial Council, made public on 23 November 2005, revealed that 26 percent of indigenous children in the first and second grades of nine Rewa schools could not speak their own language. The council was exploring ways to redress this area of concern.\n\nVice-President Ratu Joni Madraiwiwi added his own voice on 9 January 2006 to the campaign to make Fijian a compulsory subject. Addressing the 72nd annual meeting of the Fijian Teachers Association in Suva, Madraiwiwi said that it was dangerous to assume that Fijian children would automatically learn their own language. His parents' generation had emphasized prioritizing English on the assumption that Fijian could be learned later, but this had resulted in a generation knowing little Fijian, and unless the language was made compulsory at all levels of primary education, it would be lost to the next generation, he said.\n\nKamlesh Arya, President of the Arya Pratindhi Sabha organization, said on 29 June 2005 that language was the window by which people could appreciate and absorb tradition, and that making both Fijian and Hindustani compulsory school subjects would promote social and cultural understanding between the two races. His organization taught Fijian to Indo-Fijian students in primary schools at its own expense, he said. Given the geographical and numerical limitations of the Fijian language, it needed to be given special attention on its own merit.\n\nParliamentarian Gaffar Ahmed of the FLP spoke out on 4 August 2005 in favour of establishing Fijian as the national language. \"\"To achieve national unity, multi-cultural and multi-racial harmony, we should have one common language which must be taught at all schools,\"\" he told the House of Representatives. He said that his own inability to speak Fijian was his greatest handicap as a Fijian citizen.\n\n"}

It is one of two living species in the genus \"Lepidochelys\" (the other one being \"L. olivacea\", the olive ridley sea turtle).\n\nThis species of turtle is called Kemp's ridley because Richard Moore Kemp (1825-1908) of Key West was the first to send a specimen to Samuel Garman at Harvard. However, the etymology of the name \"ridley\" itself is unknown. Prior to the term being popularly used (for both species in the genus), \"L. kempii\" at least was known as the \"bastard turtle\".\n\nAt least one source also refers to Kemp's ridley as a \"heartbreak turtle\". In her book \"The Great Ridley Rescue\", Pamela Philips claimed the name was coined by fishermen who witnessed the turtles dying after being \"turned turtle\" (on their backs). The fishermen said the turtles \"died of a broken heart\".\n\nKemp's ridley is the smallest of all sea turtle species, reaching maturity at carapace length and weighing only . Typical of sea turtles, it has a dorsoventrally depressed body with specially adapted flipper-like front limbs and a beak. Kemp's ridley turtle is the smallest of the sea turtles, with adults reaching a maximum of in carapace length and weighing a maximum of . The adult has an oval carapace that is almost as wide as it is long and is usually olive-gray in color. The carapace has five pairs of costal scutes. In each bridge adjoining the plastron to the carapace are four inframarginal scutes, each of which is perforated by a pore. The head has two pairs of prefrontal scales. Hatchlings are black on both sides. Kemp's ridley has a triangular-shaped head with a somewhat hooked beak with large crushing surfaces. This turtle is a shallow-water benthic feeder with a diet consisting primarily of crabs. This is the only species that nests primarily during the day, with 95% of all nesting occurring in Mexico in the state of Tamaulipas.\n\nKemp's ridley sea turtle generally prefers warm waters, but inhabits waters as far north as New Jersey. These turtles migrate to the Gulf of Mexico and the western Atlantic, where they often inhabit the waters off Louisiana, among other states that border the gulf .\n\nIts geographic range includes the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico. Almost all females return each year to a single beach—Rancho Nuevo in the Mexican state of Tamaulipas—to lay eggs. The females arrive in large groups of hundreds or thousands in nesting aggregations called \"arribadas\", which is a Spanish word for \"arrivals\".\n\nSome travel as far away as the coast of Ireland, and two individuals managed to journey as far as the coasts of Devonshire.\n\nKemp's ridley turtle feeds on mollusks, crustaceans, jellyfish, fish, algae or seaweed, and sea urchins. Juvenile Kemp's ridleys primarily feed on crabs.\n\nJuvenile turtles tend to live in floating sargassum seaweed beds for their first years. Then they range between northwest Atlantic waters and the Gulf of Mexico while growing into maturity.\n\nThese turtles change color as they mature. As hatchlings, they are almost entirely a dark purple, but mature adults have a yellow-green or white plastron and a grey-green carapace. They reach sexual maturity at the age of 10-12.\n\nThe nesting season for these turtles is April to August. They nest mostly on a 16-mile beach in the Mexican state of Tamaulipas and on Padre Island in the US state of Texas, and elsewhere on the Gulf coast. They mate offshore. Gravid females land in groups on beaches in what is commonly called an \"arribada\" or mass nesting. They prefer areas with dunes or, secondarily, swamps. The estimated number of nesting females in 1947 was 89,000, but shrank to an estimated 7,702 by 1985.\n\nFemales nest two or three times during a season, keeping 10 to 20 days between nestings. Incubation takes 45 to 70 days. On average, around 110 eggs are in a clutch. The hatchlings' sex is decided by the temperature in the area during . If the temperature is below 29.5 °C, the offspring will be mainly male.\n\nHunting first depleted the numbers of Kemp's Ridley sea turtle, but today, major threats include habitat loss, pollution, and entanglement in shrimping nets.\n\nMexico first protected Kemp's ridleys in the “2018s”. In the United States, Kemp's ridley turtle was first listed under the Endangered Species Conservation Act of 1970 on December 2, 1970, and subsequently under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) of 1973. A binational recovery plan was developed in 1984, and revised in 1992. A draft public review draft of the second revision was published by NOAA Fisheries in March 2010. This revision includes an updated threat assessment.\n\nOne mechanism used to protect turtles from fishing nets is the turtle excluder device (TED). Because the biggest danger to the population of Kemp's ridley sea turtles is shrimp trawls, the device is attached to the shrimp trawl. It is a grid of bars with an opening at the top or bottom, fitted into the neck of the shrimp trawl. It allows small animals to slip through the bars and be caught while larger animals, such as sea turtles, strike the bars and are ejected, thus avoiding possible drowning. \nIn September 2007, Corpus Christi, Texas, wildlife officials found a record of 128 Kemp's ridley sea turtle nests on Texas beaches, including 81 on North Padre Island (Padre Island National Seashore) and four on Mustang Island. The figure was exceeded in each of the following 7 years (see graph to 2013, provisional figures for 2014 as at July, 118.). Wildlife officials released 10,594 Kemp's ridley hatchlings along the Texas coast that year. The turtles are popular in Mexico, as boot material and food.\nSome Kemp's ridleys were airlifted from Mexico after the 1979 blowout of the Ixtoc 1 rig, which spilled millions of gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nSince April 30, 2010, 10 days after the accident on the \"Deepwater Horizon\", 156 sea turtle deaths were recorded; most were Kemp's ridleys. Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries biologists and enforcement agents rescued Kemp's ridleys in Grand Isle. \"Most\" of the 456 oiled turtles that were rescued, cleaned, and released by US Fish and Wildlife Service were Kemp's ridleys.\n\nOf the endangered marine species frequenting Gulf waters, only Kemp's ridley relies on the region as its sole breeding ground.\n\nAs part of the effort to save the species from some of the effects of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, scientists took nests and incubated them elsewhere; 67 eggs were collected from a nest along the Florida Panhandle on June 26, 2010, and brought to a temperature-controlled warehouse at NASA's Kennedy Space Center, where 56 hatched, and 22 were released on 11 July 2010.\n\nThe overall plan was to collect eggs from about 700 sea turtle nests, incubate them, and release the young on beaches across Alabama and Florida over a period of months. Eventually, 278 nests were collected, including only a few Kemp's ridley nests.\n\n\n"}

He played college football at the University of Miami after transferring from Kilgore College.\n\nOn September 9, 2007, Everett sustained a fracture and dislocation of his cervical spine that his doctors characterized as \"life-threatening\" the day after the injury, and stated it is likely to leave him with permanent neurological impairment. However, on September 11, 2007, Everett showed significant movement in his arms and legs, which led doctors to speculate that he might eventually be able to walk again. Indeed, Everett walked in public for the first time at Ralph Wilson Stadium before the home finale against the New York Giants on December 23, 2007.\n\nEverett attended Thomas Jefferson High School in Port Arthur, Texas, where he was a three-year letterman in football. As a senior, he won Class 5A All-State honors in 2000.\n\nKevin Everett attended Kilgore College in Kilgore, Texas for two years, where he was a two-time first-team All-Southwest Junior College football conference pick, ranked the second best junior college player in the nation. As a sophomore, he caught 18 passes for 310 yards and 2 touchdowns.\n\nHe subsequently transferred to the University of Miami. Everett left Miami as the 86th overall pick by the Buffalo Bills in the third round of the 2005 NFL Draft.\n\nIn 2005, Everett became the second tight end the Buffalo Bills brought to the team in as many years, after Tim Euhus was drafted in 2004. Everett struggled with injuries almost from his first day of play with the Bills, having missed the 2005 season after suffering a torn knee ligament on the first day of 2005 minicamp. He was placed on the physically unable to perform list on August 10, 2005, and on injured reserve on November 30.\n\nEverett returned to play in 2006, where he participated on special teams for most of the season. He made his first career start on September 10, 2006 at New England, with the Bills opening in a two-tight end set. On October 1 of that same year, Everett made his first career NFL reception, gaining one yard on a deflected pass.\n\nOn September 9, 2007, in Week 1 of the 2007 NFL season, while attempting to tackle Denver Broncos' kickoff return man Domenik Hixon, Everett sustained a neck injury that resulted in his transport off the field by ambulance and emergency surgery at Millard Fillmore Gates Hospital. The injury was described as a cervical spine injury. Following the lengthy surgery, Everett's agent, Brian Overstreet, expressed hope that the injured player would be able to walk, but also reported Everett's movement as \"sparse.\" Aside from his eyes, Everett had not shown any signs of movement on the field after sustaining the injury. It was announced that he would spend one or two days under sedation as doctors evaluate the severity of his injury.\n\nIn a televised September 10 press conference, Buffalo Bills team medical director Dr. John Marzo described Everett's injury as a fracture and dislocation of the cervical spine, resulting in injury to the spinal cord. Orthopedic surgeon Dr. Andrew Cappuccino of Buffalo Spine Surgery, and member of the Buffalo Bills medical staff, was Everett's attending surgeon, and described the injury to Everett's spinal cord as a \"scissoring\" or \"pinching\" injury, caused by dislocation of the third and fourth cervical vertebrae.\n\nCappuccino repaired a fracture between the third and fourth vertebrae in a procedure that included a bone graft, the insertion of a plate and four screws in Everett's spinal column, and the relief of pressure on the spinal cord. Cappuccino reported that, immediately after the injury, Everett could not feel anything below his shoulders, but the morning after surgery, he had some voluntary movement in his legs, and could feel pressure \"down to his feet.\" However, Cappuccino gave the player a \"statistically very small\" chance of walking again.\n\nCappuccino originally stated that he believed Everett would sustain \"permanent\" neurological damage, and used terms such as \"bleak\" and \"dismal\" to describe the outlook for a case he frankly described as \"life-threatening\", giving Everett less than a 5-10% chance of regaining full utilization of his physical capabilities.\n\nUntil September 11, Everett remained on a respirator, but was able to breathe on his own while it was briefly turned off. Cappuccino described Everett's respiratory risks as among the issues he described as \"life-threatening\" as well as how techniques, such as intravenous methods to reduce Everett's body temperature in an attempt to reduce the swelling, were performed in order to make operation easier. Cappuccino described Everett as an \"NFL athlete [with] a warrior's mentality,\" who showed concern primarily for his family, and who asked doctors to do everything they could for him.\n\nWIVB-TV, the CBS affiliate in Buffalo, reported on September 11 that Everett had regained voluntary movement in his arms and legs, a huge improvement compared to the prognosis given the previous day. Later, ESPN reported that Kevin's doctors were more optimistic with the strength of movements he gained; they claimed that he may be able to possibly walk out of the hospital. Dr. Barth Green, neurological surgery department chair at the University of Miami School of Medicine, said \"based on our experience, the fact that he's moving so well, so early after such a catastrophic injury means he will walk again.\" When asked about Everett's chances for full recovery, Green replied that, while \"not 100 percent predictable,\" it was \"feasible that he could lead a normal life,\" and credited the hypothermic treatment of intravenous ice-cold saline, administered within minutes of Everett's injury, as having been a significant factor in minimizing the damage. Green referred to this method as an \"ice-pack for his spinal cord.\" \n\nOn September 12, a report by Dr. Cappuccino and supporting neurosurgeon Dr. Kevin J. Gibbons was released via press conference that was shown live on ESPN. Gibbons reported that Kevin had been able to slightly move his arms and legs and also wiggle his toes. However, he could not move his hands. When asked about the report that Dr. Barth Green had made the day before in which Green stated that Everett would most likely walk out of the hospital, Cappuccino said that it was just an opinion and that walking out of the hospital was \"not a realistic goal\" at this point. Gibbons said that right now, the only thing they were concerned about was getting Kevin to walk again. Also in that report, it was stated that Kevin had been taken off the respirator and was able to breathe on his own. On September 14, \"Fox Sports\" reported that Everett had begun to regain movement in his right hand. On September 17, 2007, he regained movement in both hands and was steadily regaining strength in his legs, and on September 20, Dr. Barth Green told the Associated Press that Everett will be able to stand and walk within weeks, and perhaps sooner.\n\nAs of October 1, 2007, Everett had been relocated to Houston, near his family and off-season home, where he will begin a long rehabilitation that doctors believe will lead to his eventually walking again (they are \"optimistic\") and possibly even making a full recovery. Working in his favor are his age, the incomplete nature of the spinal cord injury, his constitution, and exceptional physical condition at the time of injury, as well as the rapid treatment he received. On October 16, it was reported that Everett has been able to walk \"to an extent.\" During the broadcast it was announced Everett had been released from his Houston hospital to resume rehab as an outpatient.\n\nOn December 7, Everett was able to walk on his own power, but he did not have full movement. Everett appeared on the cover of the December 17 issue of \"Sports Illustrated\", which contains an article on his injury, rehabilitation and recovery. On Sunday, December 23, 2007, Kevin walked publicly on the field of Ralph Wilson Stadium in front of a number of fans for the home finale against the New York Giants. Coincidentally, Domenik Hixon was on the Giants at the time of the game after being released by the Broncos. On January 31, 2008, Everett accepted NFL commissioner Roger Goodell's invitation to sit with him at Super Bowl XLII. That day, he also appeared on Oprah, clearly able to walk under his own power.\n\nOn April 9, 2008 Everett underwent more surgery to relieve persistent pain in his neck. On May 12, 2008 Everett was waived by the Buffalo Bills to allow him to be eligible to immediately apply for lifetime disability benefits. The Bills kept Everett on the active roster prior to waiving him to ensure that he completed three full NFL seasons, allowing him to qualify for a full pension. On July 20, 2008 Everett was awarded the Jimmy V award for perseverance at the 2008 ESPY Awards for his heroic recovery from neck injury that threatened his chances of walking again, defying the odds and \"never giving up\"—something Jim Valvano said himself at the 1993 ESPY Awards. Everett was the grand marshal and gave the command to start engines for NASCAR Nationwide Series Zippo 200 at Watkins Glen on August 9, 2008.\n\nIn an article on buffalobills.com from 2012, Everett was interviewed in a story titled \"Kevin Everett Five Years Later\". “These five years shot by so fast it’s unbelievable to tell you the truth,” Everett told Buffalobills.com. “They’ve been fast because I’ve been staying busy.” “I’m glad people still remember me,” he said. “I wish they could remember me for making touchdowns and making big plays for the Bills, but they still remember me as a person and what I went through in my life. So I very much appreciate that and I love every fan out there that supports me.” While the desire to play still flares up from time to time, it doesn’t keep Everett from getting close to the game.\n\n"}

His artwork has been shown in galleries internationally, and he has been a resident DJ at venues such as the Knitting Factory.\n\nDavid J has released a number of singles and solo albums, and in 1990 he released one of the first No. 1 hits on the newly created Modern Rock Tracks charts, with \"I'll Be Your Chauffeur\". His most recent single, \"The Day That David Bowie Died\" entered the UK vinyl singles chart at number 4 in 2016. The track appears on his latest double album, \"Vagabond Songs\".\n\nDavid John Haskins was born on 24 April 1957 in Northampton, England. He is the elder brother of Kevin Haskins, also a musician and member of Bauhaus and Love and Rockets.\n\nJ was a founding member of the highly influential English post-punk band Bauhaus in 1978, playing bass. David J wrote the lyrics of several Bauhaus songs (including their first single, \"Bela Lugosi's Dead\"). He sang backing vocals on many songs, and sang lead on \"Who Killed Mr. Moonlight?\". Bauhaus first broke up in 1983, reforming periodically at later times.\n\nHis first venture outside of Bauhaus was a collaborative single, \"Armour\" / \"Nothing\", with artist and poet René Halkett, of the original Weimar Bauhaus school of art and design.\n\nHe began writing music for a solo career while still in the band, and continued after the band's break-up, releasing the dark \"Etiquette of Violence\" and \"Crocodile Tears and the Velvet Cosh\", and played bass on two Jazz Butcher albums (\"A Scandal in Bohemia\" and \"Sex and Travel\"), both of which he also produced. J was also a part of the very short-lived band The Sinister Ducks, which included saxophonist Alex Green and comics writer Alan Moore. J also released an EP that was intended as a soundtrack to Moore's graphic novel \"V for Vendetta\". In 1996, he once again collaborated with Moore alongside musician Tim Perkins when the trio recorded two spoken-word-with-music CDs, \"The Grand Egyptian Theatre of Marvels\" and \"The Birth Caul\".\n\nIn 1985, J, his brother Kevin Haskins, and Daniel Ash, all former members of Bauhaus, formed Love and Rockets; J once again played bass guitar and also shared songwriting and vocal duties with guitarist Daniel Ash. His most notable lead vocal from this period was the minor hit \"No New Tale to Tell\". J maintained his solo career during breaks from Love and Rockets, releasing \"Songs from Another Season\" and \"Urban Urbane\" after his band's success with the single \"So Alive\". He also released one of the first No. 1 hits from the newly created Modern Rock Tracks charts, with \"I'll Be Your Chauffeur\". J participated in a Bauhaus reunion in 1998. Love and Rockets broke up in 1999, after seven albums. Following what was billed as a one-off performance of Bauhaus at the 2005 Coachella concert festival, Bauhaus reformed for a successful tour of the Americas in late 2005 and Europe in early 2006 as well as a final album, \"Go Away White\".\n\nJ has also appeared on releases by Porno for Pyros and Jane's Addiction, and co-wrote the latter's 2003 album title track, \"Strays\".

Sello) (1789–1831) was a German botanist and naturalist. He was one of the earliest European scientific explorers of Brazil, and a major collector of Brazilian flora.\n\nFriedrich Sellow was born on March 12, 1789. He was the eldest son of Carl Julius Samuel Sello, the gardener of the Royal Court of Potsdam. After learning the gardening profession with relatives, Sellow went to work and study in the Botanical Garden of Berlin under the patronage of its director, Carl Ludwig Willdenow (1765–1812). In 1810 Sellow travelled to Paris to study. Here he attended scientific lectures by Georges Cuvier and Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, and worked at the \"Jardin des Plantes\". \n\nIn the next year, with recommendations and financial assistance from Alexander von Humboldt (1769–1859), Sellow traveled to the Netherlands and England, coming in contact with the most prominent botanists of the time. During the Napoleonic Wars Sellow avoided France and the rest of continental Europe, accepting an invitation by the Russian consul Baron von Langsdorff (1774–1852), to be part of a scientific expedition the baron was organizing in Brazil. (Langsdorff was serving at the time as a diplomat in Rio de Janeiro.) In 1814, with the financial backing of British botanists, and after having made meticulous preparations, Sellow sailed to Rio de Janeiro. There, he and his colleagues were well received by the Portuguese colonial government, and Sellow soon began receiving a generous annual salary as an official naturalist. Sellow learned to speak Portuguese, and carried out initially smaller excursions in the environs of Rio de Janeiro; including, from 1815 to 1817, an expedition led by the German prince Maximilian zu Wied-Neuwied (1782–1867). From these expeditions Sellow collected many specimens which he sent back to London. One of these was \"Salvia splendens\", known as Lee's scarlet sage, which became popular as an ornamental summer flower in England and Germany. \n\nFurther financing from Prussia allowed Sellow to undertake numerous other expeditions in southern Brazil and Uruguay during the next 11 years; he traveled into the unexplored regions of the country, and collected thousands of plants, seeds, wood samples, insects and minerals. In the tradition of independent 19th century naturalists, he sent these collections to botanical gardens in Brazil, Portugal, England and Germany. Among the seed specimens of South American ornamental plants sent by Sellow were \"Begonia cucullata\" (pearl begonia), and the white-petaled \"Petunia axillaris\" (wild white petunia) which were soon popular in Europe, particularly across Germany, Switzerland and Austria, and were planted on balconies of homes. \n\nIn one of his ethnographic expeditions, Sellow accompanied the diplomat Ignaz Maria von Olfers (1793–1872), who later became the first general manager of the Royal Prussian museums. Some of Sellow's scientific collections from Uruguay and Brazil are divided between the Museum of Natural History of Berlin, the Ethnological Museum of Berlin, and the Museum of Natural History of Vienna. These collections include, in addition to botany, many zoological preparations, insects, shells, ethnographic drawings and original diaries. \n\nIn October 1831, Sellow met an unfortunate and untimely end by drowning in a river when only 42 years old. His versatile and rich contribution to the botanical knowledge of Brazilian flora remained largely forgotten until recently, when his name was honored with \"Sellowia\", a botanical journal published in Itajaí, Brazil. \n\n"}

This assertion is supported by the philosophy of friction ridge identification, which states that friction ridge identification is established through the agreement of friction ridge formations, in sequence, having sufficient uniqueness to individualize.\n\nFriction ridge identification is also governed by four premises or statements of facts:\n\nPeople can also be identified from traces of their DNA from blood, skin, hair, saliva, and semen by DNA fingerprinting, from their ear print, from their teeth or bite by forensic odontology, from a photograph or a video recording by facial recognition systems, from the video recording of their walk by gait analysis, from an audio recording by voice analysis, from their handwriting by handwriting analysis, from the content of their writings by their writing style (e.g. typical phrases, factual bias, and/or misspellings of words), or from other traces using other biometric techniques.\n\nSince forensic identification has been first introduced to the courts in 1980, the first exoneration due to DNA evidence was in 1989 and there have been 336 additional exonerations since then. Those who specialize in forensic identification continue to make headway with new discoveries and technological advances to make convictions more accurate.\n\nBody identification is a subfield of forensics concerned with identifying someone from their remains.\n\nFeet also have friction ridges like fingerprints do. Friction ridges have been widely accepted as a form of identification with fingerprints but not entirely with feet. Feet have creases which remain over time due to the depth it reaches in the dermal layer of the skin, making them permanent. These creases are valuable when individualizing the owner. The concept of no two fingerprints are alike is also applied to foot creases. Foot creases can grow as early as 13 weeks after conception when the volar pads begin to grow and when the pads regress, the creases remain. When foot crease identification is used in a criminal case, it should be used in conjunction with morphology and friction ridges to ensure precise identification. There is record of foot crease identification used in a criminal case to solve a murder. Sometimes with marks left by the foot with ink, blood, mud, or other substances, the appearance of creases or ridges become muddled or extra creases may appear due to cracked skin, folded skin, or fissures. In order to truly compare morphological feature, the prints of feet must be clear enough to distinguish between individuals.\n\nThe two basic conceptual foundations of forensic identification is that everyone is individualized and unique. This individualization belief was invented by a police records clerk, Alphonse Bertillon, based on the idea that \"nature never repeats,\" originating from the father of social statistics, Lambert Adolphe Jacques Quetelet. The belief was passed down through generations being generally accepted, but it was never scientifically proven. There was a study done intending to show that no two fingerprints were the same, but the results were inconclusive. Many modern forensic and evidentiary scholars collectively agree that individualization to one object, such as a fingerprint, bite mark, handwriting, or ear mark is not possible. In court cases, forensic scientists can fall victim to observer bias when not sufficiently blinded to the case or results of other pertinent tests. This has happened in cases like \"United States v. Green\" and \"State v. Langill\". Also, the proficiency tests that forensic analysts must do are often not as demanding to be considered admissible in court.\n\nForensic DNA analysis can be a useful tool in aiding forensic identification because DNA is found in almost all cells of our bodies except red blood cells. Deoxyribonucleic acid is located in two different places of the cell, the nucleus; which is inherited from both parents, and the mitochondria; inherited maternally. Similar to fingerprints, an individual’s DNA profile and characteristics are unique. Forensic identification using DNA can be useful in different cases such as determining suspects in violent crimes, solving paternity/maternity, and identifying human remains of victims from mass disasters or missing person cases. It is also used to link suspects or victims to each other or to crime scenes. When a sample is located at a crime scene, it must be collected, processed, and transported, along with a chain of custody, to the laboratory for analysis, so that if a DNA profile is generated it can be accepted in court. Proper evidence collection and preservation is crucial to ensure evidence is not being contaminated. Main procedures investigators must use when packaging biological material is allowing the evidence to air dry and then package into paper bags. Plastic bags should never be used on biological evidence because it could degrade DNA or lead to bacterial growth. \n\nDNA can be sourced from biological material such as semen, blood, saliva, feces, urine, teeth, bone, and hair that is left behind from an individual. There are different presumptive and confirmatory tests used for each type of biological material found at a scene. Presumptive tests are quick, sensitive and are relatively specific to bodily fluids that give the analyst an idea of what might be present. Confirmatory tests confirm what the biological sample is. In addition to looking for biological material at a crime scene, pieces of evidence can also be examined and analyzed for the presence of DNA. Evidence pieces that may have the presence of DNA could include clothing, bedding, weapons, masks, gloves, among many others. This is attributed to touch DNA, where only minute samples are left after an object has been touched. It is defined as “evidence with no visible staining that would likely contain DNA resulting from the transfer of epithelial cells from the skin to an object.” A forensic scientist can attempt to obtain a DNA profile from the sample with as few as six cells. \n\nThe first step in the DNA process with a piece of evidence is extraction. Extraction is a technique used to remove the DNA from the cell. The next step would be quantification which determines how much DNA is present. The third step is amplification in order to yield multiple copies of DNA. Next is separation, to separate the DNA out to use for identification. Finally, the analyst can now complete analysis and interpretation of the DNA sample and compare to known profiles. \n\nAn unknown sample found at a crime scene is called a questioned sample. A known sample can be taken either from a suspect or found in a database. The FBI’s database used for DNA is CODIS, Combined DNA Index System. It has data at three levels: local, state, and national. The national level data is stored in NDIS, National DNA Index system. CODIS/NDIS allows analysts to compare their questioned DNA profile among those of arrestees, convicted offenders, and other unknown samples to try and produce investigative leads. If questioned and known samples are similar, statistics and interpretation will then be completed. The DNA profile will be compared to a population database and a random match probability will be determined. Random match probability is defined as the chance that an individual selected randomly from a population will have an identical DNA profile to the markers tested. If they do not equal each other, they are not a match, termed exclusion. \n\nDuring DNA typing, several markers are examined, termed loci. When more markers are examined, this could result in either a greater probability that two unrelated individuals will have different genotypes or adds to the confidence of connecting an individual to an unknown sample.  One locus difference between a questioned and known sample is enough to exclude that suspect as the contributor. \n\nThe FBI has identified 13 core STR loci that are effective for human identification. STR is short tandem repeats which are short DNA regions in the genome and are 2-6 base pairs in length. STR is common in forensic analysis because they are easily amplified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and they have unique variation among individuals for human identification. PCR is the technique of copying DNA by making millions of copies. When all 13 core loci are tested on a DNA profile, the random match probability is more than one in a trillion. \n\nSince DNA was first used in a criminal investigation in 1986, it has aided investigators to solve many cases. DNA profiling is one of the most important tools in forensics and continued research will increase its ability and accuracy to provide more techniques for the future. \n\nThere are many different applications for wildlife forensics and below are only some of the procedures and processes used to distinguish species.\n\nSpecies identification: The importance of species identification is most prominent in animal populations that are illegally hunted, harvested, and traded, such as rhinoceroses, lions, and African elephants. In order to distinguish which species is which, mtDNA, or mitochondrial DNA, is the most used genetic marker because it's easier to type from highly decomposed and processed tissue compared to nuclear DNA. Additionally, the mitochondrial DNA has multiple copies per cell, which is another reason it's frequently used. When nuclear DNA is used, certain segments of the strands are amplified in order to compare those to segments of mitochondrial DNA. This comparison is used to figure out related genes and species proximity since distant relatives of animals are closer in proximity in the gene tree. That being said, the comparison process demands precision because mistakes can easily be made due to genes evolving and mutating in the evolution of species.\n\nDetermination of geographic origin: Determining the origin of a certain species aids research in population numbers and lineage data. Phylogenetic studies are most often used to find the broad geographic area of which a species reside. For example, in California seahorses were being sold for traditional medicinal purposes and the phylogenetic data of those seahorses led researchers to find their origin and from which population they came from and what species they were. In addition to phylogenetic data, assignment tests are used to find the probability of a species belonging to or originating from a specific population and genetic markers of a specimen are utilized. These types of tests are most accurate when all potential population's data have been gathered. Statistical analyses are used in assignment tests based on an individual's microsatellites or Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphisms (AFLPs). Using microsatellites in these studies is more favorable than AFLPs because the AFLPs required non-degraded tissue samples and higher errors have been reported when using AFLPs.\n\nDomestic animals such as dogs and cats can be utilized to help solve criminal cases. These can include homicides, sexual assaults, or robberies. DNA evidence from dogs alone have helped over 20 criminal cases in Great Britain and the U.S. since 1996. However, there are very few laboratories that are able to process and analyze evidence or data from domestic animals. Forensics can be used in animal attacks as well. In cases such as dog attacks, the hair, blood, and saliva surrounding the wounds a victim has can be analyzed to find a match for the attacker. In the competitive realm, DNA analysis is used in many cases to find illegal substances in racehorses by urine samples and comparisons of STRs.\n\n\n\nSometimes, manufacturers and film distributors may intentionally leave subtle forensic markings on their products to identify them in case of piracy or involvement in a crime.

{"id": "2122364", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2122364", "title": "The Black Sleep", "text": "The Black Sleep\n\nThe Black Sleep is a 1956 American independent horror film directed by Reginald LeBorg, and written by John C. Higgins from a story by Gerald Drayson Adams. It stars Basil Rathbone, Lon Chaney Jr., John Carradine, Bela Lugosi, and Akim Tamiroff. Tor Johnson appears in a supporting role. The film was produced by Aubrey Schenck and Howard W. Koch, as part of a four-picture finance-for-distribution arrangement with United Artists.\n\nThe film was released as a double feature with the 1955 British film \"The Creeping Unknown\". \"The Black Sleep\" was re-released in 1962 under the title \"Dr. Cadman's Secret\".\n\nSet in England in 1872, the story concerned a prominent, knighted surgeon whose wife has fallen into a coma caused by a deep-seated brain tumor. Due to medicine's state of the art at the time, he does not know how to reach the tumor without risking brain damage or death to the woman he loves, so he undertakes to secretly experiment on the brains of living, but involuntary, human subjects who are under the influence of a powerful Indian anesthetic, Nind Andhera, which he calls the \"Black Sleep\". Once he has finished his experiment, surviving subjects are revived and placed, in seriously degenerated and mutilated states, in a hidden cellar in the gloomy, abandoned country abbey where he conducts his experiments.\n\nProduced during 1955, the film was released to theaters in the early summer of 1956. This was just ahead of the TV syndication, through Screen Gems, of two decades of Universal monster movies, under the package title Shock Theater. Writer Higgins, director LeBorg, and stars Rathbone, Chaney, Carradine, and Lugosi had all been significantly associated with Universal horror films or related B movies. \"The Black Sleep\" is similar to Universal's two \"houseful\" of monster films released in the mid-40s, \"House of Frankenstein\" and \"House of Dracula\", only relying on a completely new cadre of human monsters.\n\nAmongst contemporary reviews, \"Variety\" wrote that the film \"plays the horror tale fairly straight so what's happening is not too illogical until the finale wrapup, when all restraint comes off and the melodramatics run amok. ...Basil Rathbone is quite credible as the surgeon, enough so that the brain operations he performs will horrify many viewers\"; and \"The Motion Picture Exhibitor\" noted that \"Rathbone has a grand time as the mad scientist, assisted nobly by some of the best names in the horror field. Audiences should be frightened plenty, and past experience proves that this can mean good grosses... Sure, a lot of it is corny, but it is all good fun in a grisly, frightening manner.\"\n\n\"The Black Sleep\" was released by Kino on Blu ray in 2016 and contains audio commentary by Tom Weaver and David Schecter.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2122365", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2122365", "title": "Incredible Universe", "text": "Incredible Universe\n\nIncredible Universe was the name of a chain of American consumer electronics stores in the early to mid-1990s. A typical Incredible Universe was of sales floor and warehouse, stocking around 85,000 items.\n\nThe operation was conceived by former Tandy CEO John Roach. Many internal corporate philosophies of Disney theme parks were borrowed; in an Incredible Universe store, retail departments were \"scenes\", employees were \"castmembers\", customers were \"guests\", uniforms were \"costumes\", and so forth. The company was a joint venture between Tandy Corporation and Trans World Entertainment.\n\nThe stores featured a large rotunda area with an actual stage where sales presentations, product demonstrations, autograph signings, or even occasional musical acts were performed, and various retail departments (software, music and video, and accessories) were accessible from this rotunda. Moving through the rotunda area would lead one to the main storefront where larger consumer electronics and computers were sold.\n\nA store would also generally contain from four to eight sound rooms where particular combinations of audio/video equipment could be demonstrated, and some stores contained McDonald's restaurants (the Wilsonville, Oregon store contained a Pizza Hut) and temporary day care facilities where parents could leave their small children while they shopped.\n\nMany stores also had a second floor which housed a cafeteria for the staff as well as training and demo rooms. The training rooms were used for demonstrating new product from vendors to the staff as well as public training on computers, software, and audio/video gear for purchase. Rounding out the computer department was a computer upgrade center which could add new memory, a sound card, or a modem in just a few minutes.\n\nInitially, two stores were opened, in Arlington, Texas, and Wilsonville, Oregon; when these proved profitable, parent company Tandy, an electronics company, decided to expand quickly opening an additional 15 stores. In the mid-1990s, Incredible Universe was a sponsor of the Texas Rangers, Sacramento Kings, Dallas Stars, Dallas Sidekicks and Dallas Mavericks professional sports franchises. During this time, however, with the growth of other retail outlets such as Best Buy, the market became more competitive, and the expense of operating such large facilities resulted in an overall lack of profitability for the entire enterprise.\n\nOf the 17 stores, only six were ever consistently profitable; these six stores were sold to California company Fry's Electronics in 1996. The others were all closed in that same year. As the buildings were so large, they could not be readily adapted to other business purposes, and buyers were so scarce that Tandy sold the empty buildings for mere pennies on the dollar. In 1996, the Incredible Universe stores lost $90 million, and in 1997, Tandy announces the closing of 17 Incredible Universe stores. Tandy officials say \"the stores were profitable but not 'viable.' One of the former Incredible Universe sites located in Houston, Texas was acquired and redeveloped by Houston Community College which became the HCC Southwest campus. Another, in Woodbridge, Virginia, became a manufacturing plant for General Dynamics' line of amphibious war fighting vehicles, from 2002 to 2012; it was later adapted to Gander Mtn. and Floor & Decor stores. The Westbury, Long Island store was converted into a Target and no longer has the 'signature' look (bowed front) of an Incredible Universe. The Sandy, Utah store was converted to a Costco warehouse. The Auburn, Washington location, situated on the north side of the Supermall of the Great Northwest, was converted to a Sam's Club in 1999, retaining the original Incredible Universe façade. The location closed without warning in early 2018; the site is currently unused. The Lone Tree, Colorado store became a Great Indoors, until that chain closed in 2012, at which point it converted to a Sears Outlet, though that eventually closed as well, leaving the property vacant. The Hollywood, Florida location remained empty for some time, but was eventually converted to a Home Depot which it remains to this day. The Columbus, Ohio location was converted into a Garden Ridge (now At Home) while the northern half of the parking lot was used to build a Dave & Buster's.\n\n"}

He began his work in the profession of journalism at the old \"Brooklyn Daily Eagle\" at the age of 18. Redmont was a reporter and telegraph editor on the Herkimer, NY Evening Telegram in 1940 and 1941. After World War II broke out, he enlisted in the Marines and served as a Combat Correspondent in the Marshall Islands. During and immediately after the war, he served as head of the News Division of the Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs (OCIAA), sometimes known as \"the Rockefeller Agency.\"\n\nRedmont, who has a reading and speaking knowledge of French and Spanish, began his work as a foreign correspondent during his Pulitzer Traveling Fellowship in Europe and later in Mexico City. He was bureau chief for World Report (later U.S. News & World Report), in Buenos Aires in the late 1940s, during the dictatorship of Juan Peron and his wife Evita Peron, and Paris in the early 1950s. Continuing his reporting from Paris, he was head of the English desk of the Agence France-Presse for many years. In 1961, Redmont served as President of the Anglo-American Press Association.\n\nRedmont's broadcasting career began with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) and continued with Westinghouse Broadcasting Corporation (Group W). During his time as Paris correspondent for Group W, he was granted an interview by a leading North Vietnamese diplomat in Paris, breaking the story which led to the Paris peace negotiations. Redmont also covered the rise and fall of Charles De Gaulle, the Prague Spring and Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia, the Six-Day War and the Yom Kippur War, and the struggles for human rights of Andrei Sakharov, Anatoly Sharansky, and other Soviet dissidents. He covered other major stories in Europe, the Middle East, Latin America, and the former USSR.

David Cass and Karl Shell coined the term \"sunspots\" as a suggestive and less technical way of saying \"extrinsic random variable\".\n\nThe idea that arbitrary changes in expectations might influence the economy, even if they bear no relation to fundamentals, is controversial but has been widespread in many areas of economics. For example, in the words of Arthur C. Pigou,\n'Sunspots' have been included in economic models as a way of capturing these 'extrinsic' fluctuations, in fields like asset pricing, financial crises, business cycles, economic growth, and monetary policy. Experimental economics researchers have demonstrated how sunspots could affect economic activity.\n\nThe name is a whimsical reference to 19th-century economist William Stanley Jevons, who attempted to correlate business cycle patterns with sunspot counts (on the actual sun) on the grounds that they might cause variations in weather and thus agricultural output. Subsequent studies have found no evidence for the hypothesis that the sun influences the business cycle. On the other hand, sunny weather has a small but significant positive impact on stock returns, probably due to its impact on traders' moods.\n\nIn economics, a sunspot equilibrium is an economic equilibrium where the market outcome or allocation of resources varies in a way unrelated to economic fundamentals. In other words, the outcome depends on an \"extrinsic\" random variable, meaning a random influence that matters only because people think it matters. The sunspot equilibrium concept was defined by David Cass and Karl Shell.\n\nWhile Cass and Shell's 1983 paper defined the term sunspot in the context of general equilibrium, their use of the term sunspot (a term originally used in astronomy) alludes to the earlier econometric work of William Stanley Jevons, who explored the correlation between the degree of sunspot activity and the price of corn. In Jevons' work, uncertainty about sunspots could be considered intrinsic, for example, if sunspots have some demonstrable effect on agricultural productivity, or some other relevant variable. In modern economics, the term does not indicate any relationship with solar phenomena, and is instead used to describe random variables that have no impact on the preferences, allocations, or production technology of a general equilibrium model. The modern theory suggests that such a nonfundamental variable might have an effect on equilibrium outcomes if it influences expectations.\n\nCass and Shell refer to Keynes' \"animal spirits\", and to the notion of self-fulfilling prophecy to illuminate their use of the term \"extrinsic uncertainty\". Formally however they define it as any variable that does not directly affect the fundamentals of the economy.\n\nMuch work on sunspot equilibria aims to prove the possible existence of equilibria differing from a given model's competitive equilibria, which can result from various types of extrinsic uncertainty. The sunspot equilibrium framework supplies a basis for rational expectations modeling of excess volatility (volatility resulting from sources other than randomness in the economic fundamentals). Proper sunspot equilibria can exist in a number of economic situations, including asymmetric information, externalities in consumption or production, imperfect competition, incomplete markets, and restrictions on market participation.\n"}

His father was a country doctor who collected oriental art and encouraged art in his son. After studying for three years at the Imperial Art Academy in Tokyo, Iwamatsu was expelled for insubordination and missing a military drill. He then joined a group of progressive artists, sympathetic to the struggles of ordinary workers and opposed to the rise of Japanese militarism. The antimilitarist movement in Japan was highly active at the time within many professional groups and crafts, and artists' posters protesting the Japanese aggression in China were widespread. Following the Japanese invasion of Manchuria, however, the Japanese government began heavy handed suppression of domestic dissent including the use of arrests and torture by the Tokkō (Special Higher Police).\n\nBoth Iwamatsu and his pregnant wife, Tomoe, were imprisoned and brutalized for their opposition to the militaristic government. In 1939, they left Japan for the United States so Iwamatsu could avoid conscription into the Japanese Army and to study art, leaving behind their son Mako (born 1933). After Pearl Harbor, Iwamatsu joined the U.S. Army and went to work as an artist for the United States Office of War Information (OWI) and, later, the Office of Strategic Services (OSS). It was then that he first used the pseudonym Taro Yashima, out of fear there would be repercussions for Mako and other family members if the Japanese government knew of his employment. After the war, he and his wife were granted permanent resident status by an act of the U.S. Congress. Soon after they had their second child, Momo, while living in New York City. Iwamatsu was able to return to Japan and collect Mako in 1949.\n\n\"The New Sun\", published in 1943 under the name Taro Yashima, was a 310-page autobiographical picture book for adults about life in pre-war statist Shōwa Japan, including details of the harsh and inhumane nature of his imprisonment for his participation in anti-militarist groups in the 1930s. \n\nIts sequel, \"Horizon is Calling\", published in 1947, was in the same format—usually one picture per page, with one or two lines of text. The 276-page book continues the story of his life in Japan under military rule, this time with added Japanese text. In the book, Yashima describes the operations of the Tokkō and the ongoing industrialization of Japan for war in the 1930s. During one passage, he mourns the loss of his esteemed teacher \"Mr. Isobe\", who had been killed in action after being drafted into military service. A kindly teacher of the same name also appears in Yashima's award winning children's book from 1956, \"Crow Boy\". The book concludes with musings about leaving Japan to study art overseas.\n\nYashima began writing and illustrating children's books early in the 1950s, under the pseudonym he had used in the OSS. His children's book \"Crow boy\" won the Children's Book Award in 1955. The picture books \"Crow Boy\" (1955), \"Umbrella\" (1958), and \"Seashore Story\" (1967) were all runners-up for the Caldecott Medal, and they were later designated as Caldecott Honor Books. The annual award by professional librarians recognizes the illustrator of the \"most distinguished American picture book for children\". \n\nIn 1963, on the topic of writing for children, Yashima wrote \"Let children enjoy living on this earth, let children be strong enough not to be beaten or twisted by evil on this earth”.\n\nYashima returned to his home village of Nejime, visiting childhood classmates and familiar scenes that he depicted in several of his children's picture books. He and filmmaker Glenn Johnson produced a 26-minute documentary in 1971, hosted and narrated by Yashima, entitled \"Taro Yashima's Golden Village\".\n\n\nThe Yashimas moved from New York to Los Angeles in 1954, where they opened an art institute.\n\nHe was the father of renowned actor and voice actor Iwamatsu Makoto and actress Momo Yashima.\n\nHe died in Glendale Memorial Hospital in 1994.\n\n"}

It is headed and presided by the Chairperson of the National Assembly of Bulgaria.\n\nThe Assembly administers the publication of the \"State Gazette\", Bulgaria's gazette of record.\n\nBy the Constitution, the National Assembly is inaugurated by the eldest elected member of Parliament. On the first day of sitting, he or she presides over the election of the Speaker (Chairperson) and two deputies.\n\nOnce elected, the Speakers retain their party allegiances, which means that they remain as MPs and are allowed to take part in debates and voting.\n\n121 MPs must be present in order for any session to commence, and 50%+1 of those present must vote \"for\" any point of order or bill to be approved.\n\nMinisters may be chosen from among the MPs or they may be experts outside Parliament. All MPs picked to be Cabinet ministers lose their MP status, and other members from their party are called up to Parliament to fill the seats they vacate.\n\nParliament sits Wednesday to Friday, and sessions begin at 9 am. Parliamentary committees sit in the afternoons.\n\nThe Chamber is made up of 286 seats, all facing the 5-seat speaker's bench in a 26 x 11 arrangement. In front of the Speaker, also facing the chamber, is the pulpit, in front of which is the stenographers' desk.\n\nParties sit in parliamentary groups, loosely following the rule that the political left sit to the Speaker's left and the political right to his right. Generally, the largest parties choose the left, right or centre wings of the chamber, with smaller blocks accommodating themselves wherever convenient. Individual MPs will sometimes sit entirely outside their block or stand, and, since compulsory electronic registration was implemented, may even vote from any seat in the house.\n\nTo the speaker's right, also facing the chamber, is a section with 17 seats reserved for the Cabinet, any of whom may or may not be present at any time during a parliamentary session. Any of them may, however, be called up by Parliament at any time if needed.\n\nIn addition to the ordinary National Assembly, a Grand National Assembly (\"Велико народно събрание\", \"Veliko narodno sybranie\") may be convened in order for matters of special jurisdiction, such as: 1) Adoption of a new Constitution; 2) Amendment of certain articles of the Constitution, e.g. those related with the basic civil rights; 3) Changes in the territory (gain or loss) of the Republic, etc. Before the World War II the Grand National Assembly was also competent in electing the Regency of the Bulgarian Kingdom if the tzar had not come to age. The First and the Third Grand National Assemblies also elected the first two Bulgarian monarchs after the liberation from Ottoman rule – Prince (Knjaz) Alexander Battenberg and Prince (Knjaz) Ferdinand Saxe Coburg-Gotha.\n\nAs an organ, the Grand National Assembly was introduced with the Tarnovo Constitution of 1879, abolished in 1947 and reintroduced with the 1991 constitution. In different constitutional provisions, it was constituted by a different number of representatives. According to the 1991 Constitution, it consists of 400 deputies (as opposed to 240 in the ordinary one). The 1991 Constitution was adopted by the Seventh Grand National Assembly and was composed of 200 members being elected by proportional representation and the other 200 under a first-past-the-post voting system. The Constitution provides that the elections for Grand National Assembly shall be conducted in the same manner as those for the Ordinary National Assembly.\n\nA qualified majority of 2/3 during three voting procedures on separate dates is required for a decision to be made. The Grand National Assembly can also serve as an ordinary National Assembly, taking care of regular legislative activities, in urgent cases only. After it has concluded its work on the matter for which it was elected, the Grand National Assembly is dissolved \"ex lege\" and the President of the Republic shall appoint elections for an ordinary National Assembly.\n\nA total of seven Grand National Assemblies have been in operation in Bulgaria, the last one from 10 July 1990 to 12 July 1991 adopting the current constitution.\n\nThe National Assembly's main building has been proclaimed a monument of culture for its historic significance. Situated in downtown Sofia, it was designed in Neo-Renaissance style by Konstantin Jovanović.\n\nDue to insufficient space in the main building at Parliament Square, some administrative offices of the National Assembly are now housed by the former headquarters of the Bulgarian Communist Party, located at the Largo. There has been a proposal that the entire National Assembly be permanently moved to the old Party house building, with its inner courtyard being converted into an interior space for the plenary chamber.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2122426", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2122426", "title": "The Innocence Mission", "text": "The Innocence Mission\n\nThe Innocence Mission is an indie folk band composed of Karen Peris (née McCullough), her husband (and fellow guitarist) Don Peris, and Mike Bitts (on bass guitar). The band was formed in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, when the members met during a Catholic school production of \"Godspell\". Although all members of the band have contributed to their music, Karen Peris is their main writer.\n\nBefore being signed to a record label, the band originally played local clubs, events and at Lancaster Catholic High School (the alma mater of the band members). Their self-titled debut album was released in 1989 on A&M Records and was produced by Larry Klein, then-husband of Joni Mitchell. Recorded in Mitchell's Los Angeles studio, the album spent 10 weeks on the Billboard charts, peaking at #167 in 1990. Klein also produced their 1991 follow up, \"Umbrella.\"\n\nTheir third A&M album, \"Glow\" (1995), was produced by Dennis Herring, who had previously produced two records for Camper Van Beethoven. This album is a departure from Klein's heavier production style. Herring's lighter touch gave more emphasis to the group's guitar work and to Karen's vocals and lyrics. \"Glow\" contains songs that appear on the soundtracks of the films \"Empire Records\" and \"Dream for an Insomniac\", as well as the television series \"Party of Five\". The album's second track, \"Bright as Yellow,\" peaked at #33 on Billboard’s Modern Rock Tracks. After the band completed the recording of a follow-up album to \"Glow\", A&M Records was bought by Universal Music Group. The group decided to mutually part ways with the label, shortly before it was merged with other companies to form Interscope-Geffen-A&M. \n\n1999's \"Birds of My Neighborhood\" inaugurated The Innocence Mission as they are today, following three albums as a quartet that drew comparisons to The Sundays and 10,000 Maniacs. When drummer Steve Brown left to become a chef, Karen Peris (guitars, piano, pump organ, accordion, voice), Don Peris (guitars, drums, voice) and Mike Bitts (upright bass) forged ahead with an orchestral and sometimes cinematic folk-pop sound, which they felt was truer to their real nature – in any case, a sound rich in atmosphere, innately sad, but ultimately hopeful. The album was followed by the release of \"The Lakes of Canada\" EP, which contains a remix of \"Snow\" by Icelandic electronic group GusGus, the band's only remix thus far.\n\nThe 2000 release, \"Christ Is My Hope\", featuring folk songs and hymns that had inspired them over the years, was independently distributed by their own label, LAMP, with all proceeds from sales of the record being donated to hunger relief charities. An exclusive one-album deal signed with independent label WhatAreRecords? saw \"Small Planes\" following a year later. \n\nTheir first album on Badman Records in the US and Agenda in Europe, \"Befriended\", was released in 2003 and was followed a year later by a collection of lullabies, standards, traditional and classical songs called \"Now the Day Is Over\". Recorded over two weeks in August 2004, the album contained their well-known cover of Henry Mancini's \"Moon River.\" Badman Records acquired license to re-master and re-issue the then-out-of-print \"Birds of My Neighborhood\" album in 2006.\n\n\"We Walked in Song\" was released in 2007 and included the song \"Brotherhood of Man\", which appeared in two acclaimed films: the documentary \"The Human Experience\" and the short film \"Weathered\", starring Tony Hale and Nicole Parker, which also featured a new version of the song \"Our Harry\". Also on this album are \"Happy Birthday\" and closing song \"Over the Moon\", both of which are featured in the Julia Roberts film \"Fireflies in the Garden\".\n\nOn June 6, 2008, \"Bright as Yellow\" was played as the official NASA wake-up call for the crew of Space Shuttle mission STS-124 on flight day 7.\n\n\"Street Map\" was released in December 2008 and was the second record to be distributed independently on their own LAMP label, while their eighth studio album, \"My Room in the Trees\", was released on July 13, 2010. Their ninth studio album, \"Hello I Feel the Same\", was released on October 17, 2015, followed by \"Sun on the Square\" in 2018. Their next studio album, \"See You Tomorrow\", is due for release on January 17, 2020.\n\nDon Peris has recorded four solo albums: \"Ten Silver Slide Trombones\" (2001), the mostly instrumental \"Go When the Morning Shineth\" (2006), which features a vocal contribution from Karen Peris on \"North Atlantic Sand\", and an instrumental solo guitar album, \"Brighter Visions Beam Afar\" (2007), which raised money for local food banks. His fourth studio album, \"The Old Century\", was released on May 7, 2013. Karen Peris released her first solo album, \"Violet\", on December 3, 2012. The ten-song album was performed mainly on piano, and features six instrumental compositions. Don Peris appears as guitarist on two songs, while the couple's two children performed violin and viola on a further two songs. A version of the album containing two bonus tracks, \"First Days in the City\" and \"Getting Here\", was released in Japan through P-Vine Records on May 15, 2013.\n\nSufjan Stevens calls The Innocence Mission \"moving and profound\", adding, “What makes Karen Peris’ lyrics so remarkable is the economy of words, sensory language, concrete nouns – everyday objects take on tremendous meaning.”\n\n\n\n\n"}

The Gold Coast Oceanway is a shared use pedestrian and cyclist pathway on the Gold Coast, connecting the Point Danger lighthouse on the New South Wales and Queensland border to the Gold Coast Seaway. The network includes of poor, medium and high quality pathways.\n\nThis came after severe erosion from Cyclone Oswald washed away and damaged millions in beachfront infrastructure and oceanway paths.\n\nSocial issues associated with oceanway investment include equity, disability and crime prevention (CPTED). As cities grow, the value of coastal property increases and fewer people can afford to live near the beach. As cities grow even larger the carparks along the beach start to overflow and roads leading to coastal areas become increasingly congested.\n\nOne growth model is just to keep expanding the size of carparks whenever they get full, leading to concern about 'paving paradise' as expressed in the song \"Big Yellow Taxi\".\n\nAnother growth model is that beach experiences become increasingly enjoyed by only richer people as the average person cannot afford to overcome the congestion and property value barriers of visiting the beaches as a regular part of their lifestyle. Often local resident groups oppose investment that attracts additional people to visit 'their' beach (known as fortress coast attitudes). Due to local opposition, it is often necessary for a brave politician to champion the cause before a commitment is made to invest into higher capacity foreshore areas. An example is Jim Soorley who championed the cause of the Riverwalk for Brisbane.\n\nThe Gold Coast City Council has developed standards for major foreshoreways including the 'Gold Coast Oceanway'. The standards include chapters about landscaping, connectivity, visual analysis, safety risk assessment and CPTED, width, geometry, construction materials, finishes and colour, path jointing detailing, line marking, intersections and crossing treatments, lighting, signage, furniture, public art, vegetation, and equitable access.\n\nThe 'Gold Coast Oceanway' includes a number of different sections including\n\nTravel times and distances for walking journeys along the Gold Coast Oceanway have been calculated.\n\nThere are viewing platforms at popular outlooks all along the Oceanway that are accessible for people with a disability and the entire route is serviced by Surfside Buses.\n\nThe Gold Coast Oceanway logo is made up of a number of elements including\n\nOn Saturday 23 January 2009, Gold Coast City Council advertised for the supply of community bike hire services along the Gold Coast Oceanway between the Broadbeach and Rainbow Bay SLSCs. Although a few submissions were received, Council did not award a contract. Reasons included significant gaps in the Oceanway network (Surfers South) and a desire to evaluate the success of the citycycle scheme in Brisbane.\n\nThe Gold Coast City Council has a program to invest into the quality and capacity of the Gold Coast Oceanway. It is already possible to enjoy walking and cycling along the full Gold Coast Oceanway corridor from Point Danger to the Gold Coast Seaway but many sections are narrow and of low quality.\n\nIn March 2008 works commenced on the Palm Beach Parklands including a new upgraded section of Oceanway between Lacey's Lane and Tarrabora Reserve.\n\nIn July 2008 a new section of Oceanway pavement was completed between the Sheraton Mirage Hotel and Seaworld on The Spit.\n\nIn June 2008, funding from the innovative Wave highrise building in Broadbeach allowed completion of the Oceanway between Kurrawa Parklands and First Avenue, Broadbeach.\n\nIn July 2018, Council commenced construction of the 1.7 km missing link of the Oceanway from Tugun to Bilinga. The section of Oceanway pathway opened by Christmas 2018.\n\nIn September 2008 works commenced on improving the Southern Points Oceanway between Greenmount and Bilinga. In 2009 the Oceanway was completed between Kirra Point and North Kirra and in 2010 the Oceanway was extended up to Bilinga SLSC.\n\nThere are many places where a realignment of the Oceanway traffic routes from the landward side of beachfront buildings to the beachfront itself would allow a superior pavement to be constructed. Beachfront residents are concerned that opening up the public land between their houses and the beach will detract from enjoyment of their property, citing in particular CPTED and coastal erosion concerns.\n\nGold Coast City Council is considering proposals to invest into the quality and capacity of the Gold Coast Oceanway at northern Palm Beach. A controversial area is the TD23A Oceanway between Tallebudgera Drive and 23rd Avenue. The current route for pedestrians is along the busy Gold Coast highway. A new pavement is proposed for the dune front area. Residents who currently enjoy beach front property are concerned about CPTED. In 2009, Council resolved to put construction of this section of the Oceanway on hold due to the opposition of beachfront property owners. In 2019 Council was preparing to construct the TD23A Oceanway\n\nOpening up public access along the beachfront between Flat Rock and Elephant Rock Currumbin has been debated in the community for over a decade. There has been petitions both in support and opposition to opening the public road reserve along the beach so the public can walk along the dunes. The Friends of Currumbin have been quoted in the Sun Newspaper as in support of the public's right of access to the road reserve. Local beachfront property owners are lobbying politicians to ensure the road reserve remains for their exclusive beachfront enjoyment. Opponents to public access along FERO have submitted a formal legal injunction that questions the right of local government to allow people to walk along a public road reserve. In 2010 the FERO section of Oceanway was completed as a turf walkway.\nThe Gold Coast Oceanway has received a number of awards including\n\n"}

It was named for Beaufort, South Carolina, where it was signed in 1787.\n\nIt set the boundary to be the thalweg (centerline) of the Savannah River, extending north into the Tugalo River (now spelled Tugaloo), and up to the headwater of its primary tributary. At that time, the area had not been fully surveyed, thus the somewhat ambiguous wording. If that headwater point was south of Georgia's border with North Carolina (nominally latitude 35°N), then South Carolina would claim everything north of a due-west line from that point, and south of 35°N, as far west as the Mississippi River. This claim was shown on some maps of the time, though it never took effect.\n\nAs it later was discovered, the primary tributary of the Tugalo is the Chattooga River, which does originate in North Carolina. In 1787 the area was Cherokee territory and not considered part of either state. The Treaty of 1816 officially extended the states' frontier northeast up the Chattooga River, where it remains the current boundary.\n\nThe other issue addressed was the islands in the rivers, which the treaty assigned to Georgia, but in the two rivers (Savannah and Tugalo) known to be the border at the time. In these cases, the thalweg is drawn through the center of the more northerly (actually northeasterly) channel, curving gradually around the island. This part of the treaty was the subject of some later border disputes between the two states.\n\nThere have been two cases before the U.S. Supreme Court regarding the interpretation of this treaty. (The court has original jurisdiction in such cases.)\n\nThe first \"Georgia v. South Carolina\" case in 1922 was regarding the islands in the Tugaloo, which was not explicitly named in the treaty because that was prior to its discovery. Although the treaty prescribes the northerly branch as the boundary, and the Chattooga flows in a perpendicular direction (putting Rabun County, Georgia on the north side and Oconee County, South Carolina on the south), Georgia was given the islands as in the lower rivers.\n\nThe second case of the same name was in 1989 and was more complex, regarding a Georgia island that had become a South Carolina peninsula due to dredging. Although South Carolina was in adverse possession of the land, Georgia lost this case due to acquiescence, rather than as a matter of the treaty's wording.\n\nAn 1876 case, \"South Carolina v. Georgia\", was about dredging for navigation around an island in the river at the port city of Savannah, and not about the boundary location. Georgia won this case, allowing it to widen the shipping channel on the Savannah side at the expense of water flow to the South Carolina boundary side.\n\nThe legal status of this treaty, given that the later U.S. Constitution of 1789 made interstate treaties unconstitutional, is now that of an interstate compact. Just as such compacts must be ratified by the U.S. Congress, this treaty was ratified by the Confederation Congress, and is still considered to be legally binding.\n\n"}

During its run, it was also shown on Cartoon Network, and afterwards its reruns landed on Toon Disney's Jetix block. An Arabic translation has been airing on MBC 3 since early 2006. There have been several toys and video games based on the series. The series ended on July 8, 2005 just five episodes away from its 100th.\n\n<onlyinclude></onlyinclude>\n\nJackie Chan, an archaeologist in this series, gets caught up in a conflict between government agency Section 13 and a criminal syndicate known as \"the Dark Hand.\" Led by Valmont, the Dark Hand is collecting magical talismans to reanimate an ancient draconic demon known as Shendu. Jackie also has to keep an eye on his adventurous niece, Jade, who has just flown in from Hong Kong. Jackie Chan, Jade, and his uncle must do all they can to stop evil from obtaining these powerful talismans and must embark on many missions to save the world from evil.\n\nThere are twelve mystical talismans of the Chinese zodiac (Rooster, Ox, Snake, Sheep, Rabbit, Rat, Dragon, Horse, Monkey, Dog, Pig and Tiger). Each possessing different mystical abilities and powers:\n\nAll of the talismans were created 900 years ago when ancient and good chi wizards imprisoned Shendu in a stone tablet, dividing his powers into 12 talismans.\n\nTohru has reformed and is studying as Uncle's apprentice.

In order to keep track of where he is, the Demons place a curse on him, forcing his ghost to stay in whatever body he possesses. Shendu goes after Jackie, but accidentally possesses Valmont instead. Through never-ending conflict, Valmont is forced to work along with Shendu to release the Demon Sorcerers from their confinement. \nThis season also introduces the Dark Chi Wizard Daolon Wong.\n\nSome episodes in this season occur out of order or depict events that occurred during the first season but were never shown. This is most notable due to the fact that Tohru is still working for the Dark Hand and Shendu is still in his stone body. Other episodes, while having been aired throughout the main story arc, may not have aired in chronological order, given that some channels premiered all the demon arc episodes before the other episodes in this season. Although The Dark Hand appears in Showdown In The Old West and Enter The Cat, Chow does not.\n\nHere is an explanation of the above chronology confusion (provided by one of the show's producers): the Demon Portal arc consists of 13 episodes for the Saturday morning time slot. The other 26 episodes of Season 2 were standalone adventures (that possibly aired in Kids WB's afternoon slot). These included the 3 \"Lost Talisman\" episodes (Through the Rabbit Hole; The Warrior Incarnate; Snake Hunt). Kids WB was so enamored with the Talismans from the first season that the show's producers devised a way to revisit 3 of them in new episodes, by concocting \"missing timeline\" incidents. In theory, these 3 episodes could be dropped in beside their related episodes in Season One. Furthermore, some episodes of the Season 2 Demon Portal arc originally aired out of sequence order. The following lists the correct order the Demon Portal arc was intended to be viewed.\n\nJCA#201 - The Stronger Evil\nJCA#202 - The J-Team\nJCA#203 - Jade Times Jade\nJCA#205 - And He Does His Own Stunts\nJCA#206 - Queen of the Shadowkhan\nJCA#204 - Rumble in the Big House\nJCA#209 - Demon in Di-Skies (aka Tale of a Demon Tail)\nJCA#207 - Shanghai Moon\nJCA#208 - Armor of the Gods\nJCA#210 - The New Atlantis\nJCA#211 - The Eighth Door\nJCA#212 - Demon World - Part One\nJCA#213 - Demon World - Part Two\n\nDaolon Wong and the Dark Hand simultaneously attack Section 13 in search of the Talismans. In an attempt to stop them, Jackie accidentally destroys the Talismans but this scattered their power around the world, this time to reside in host animals. Now, Jackie must find the most noble animal of each zodiac symbol before Daolon Wong takes possession of the scattered powers.\n\n\"The Oni Masks\" saga: In an attempt to free himself from prison, Daolon Wong attempts to re-summon the Shadowkhan, only to awaken Tarakudo, the Lord of all Oni and King of the Shadowkhan. Jackie and co must now locate the nine Oni masks which contain the souls of Tarukudo's generals and therefore allow the wearer to summon a different tribe of Shadowkhan. This season also introduces Drago, Shendu's son from the future who seeks to fulfill his father's goals by bringing forth the Age of Dragons, as well as Strikemaster Ice and his two cronies DJ Fist and MC Cobra. A running joke in this season is that Hak Foo wanted the masks but someone else always got them, and when he did get one his Shadowkhan were tiny.\n\nIn the fifth and final season, Drago escapes from Section 13 and double-crosses Shendu, and it's another race around the world as Jackie must locate seven cursed objects of the Immortals that imprisoned Shendu's siblings, The Demon Sorcerers (Drago's aunts and uncles) which are all imbued with their Demonic Power before Drago does. The Dragon Talisman is shown in the background of every episode.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2122515", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2122515", "title": "Periodate", "text": "Periodate\n\nPeriodate is an anion composed of iodine and oxygen. It is one of a number of oxyanions of iodine and is the highest in the series, with iodine existing in oxidation state +7. Unlike other perhalogenates, such as perchlorate, it can exist in two forms: metaperiodate and orthoperiodate . In this regard it is comparable to the tellurate ion from the adjacent group. It can combine with a number of counter ions to form periodates, which may also be regarded as the salts of periodic acid.\n\nPeriodates were discovered by Heinrich Gustav Magnus and C. F. Ammermüller; who first synthesised periodic acid in 1833.\n\nClassically, periodate was most commonly produced in the form of sodium hydrogen periodate (NaHIO). This is commercially available, but can also be produced by the oxidation of iodates with chlorine and sodium hydroxide. Or, similarly, from iodides by oxidation with bromine and sodium hydroxide:\n\nModern industrial scale production involves the electrochemical oxidation of iodates, on a PbO anode, with the following standard electrode potential:\n\nMetaperiodates are typically prepared by the dehydration of sodium hydrogen periodate with nitric acid, or by dehydrating orthoperiodic acid by heating it to 100 °C under vacuum.\n\nThey can also be generated directly from iodates by treatment with other strong oxidizing agents such as hypochlorites:\n\nPeriodate can exist in a variety of forms in aqueous media, with pH being a controlling factor. Orthoperiodate has a number of acid dissociation constants.\n\nThe ortho- and metaperiodate forms also exist in equilibrium.\n\nFor this reason orthoperiodate is sometimes referred to as the dihydrate of metaperiodate, written ; however, this description is not strictly accurate as X-ray crystallography of HIO shows 5 equivalent I–OH groups.\n\nAt extremes of pH additional species can form. Under basic conditions a dehydration reaction can take place to form the diperiodate (sometimes referred to as mesoperiodate).\n\nUnder strongly acid conditions periodic acid can be protonated to give the \"orthoperiodonium\" cation.\n\nIn both the ortho- and metaperiodate the iodine is hypervalent, as it forms more bonds than would classically be allowed. This has been explained in terms of dative bonds, confirming the absence of double bonding in these molecules.\n\nExact structures vary depending on counter ions, however on average orthoperiodates adopt a slightly deformed octahedral geometry with X-ray diffraction showing I–O bond lengths of 1.89 Å. Metaperiodates adopt a distorted tetrahedral geometry with an average I–O distance of 1.78 Å.\n\nPeriodates can cleave carbon–carbon bonds on a variety of 1,2-difunctionalised alkanes. The most common example of this is diol cleavage, which was also the first to be discovered (Malaprade reaction).\nIn addition to diols, periodates can cleave 1,2-hydroxy ketones, 1,2-diketones, α-keto acids, α-hydroxy acids, amino acids, 1,2-amino alcohols, 1,2-diamines, and epoxides to give aldehydes, ketones, and carboxylic acids.\n\nAlkenes can also be oxidised and cleaved in the Lemieux–Johnson oxidation. This uses a catalytic loading of osmium tetroxide which is regenerated in situ by the periodate. The overall process is equivalent to that of ozonolysis.\n\nCleavage reactions proceed via a cyclic intermediate called a periodate ester. The formation of this may be affected by pH and temperature but is most strongly effected by the geometry of the substrate, with \"cis\"-diols reacting significantly faster than \"trans\"-diols. The reactions are exothermic and are typically performed at 0 °C. As periodate salts are only readily soluble in water reactions are generally performed in aqueous media. Where solubility is an issue periodic acid may be used, as this is soluble in alcohols; phase transfer catalysts are also effective in biphasic reaction mixtures. In extreme cases the periodate may be exchanged for lead tetraacetate which reacts in a similar manner and is soluble in organic solvents (Criegee oxidation).\n\nPeriodate cleavage is often utilized in molecular biochemistry for the purposes of modifying saccharide rings, as many five- and six-membered sugars have vicinal diols. Historically it was also used to determine the structure of monosaccharides.\n\nPeriodate cleavage may be performed on an industrial scale to form dialdehyde starch which has uses in paper production.\n\nPeriodates are powerful oxidising agents. They can oxidise catechol to 1,2-benzoquinone and hydroquinone to 1,4-benzoquinone. Sulfides can be effectively oxidised to sulfoxides. Periodates are sufficiently powerful to generate other strong inorganic oxidisers such as permanganate, osmium tetroxide\nand ruthenium tetroxide.\n\nPeriodates are highly selective etchants for certain ruthenium-based oxides.\n\nSeveral staining agents use in microscopy are based around periodate (e.g. periodic acid–Schiff stain and Jones' stain)\n\nPeriodates have also been used as oxidising agents for use in pyrotechnics. In 2013 the US Army announced that it would replace the environmentally harmful chemicals barium nitrate and potassium perchlorate with sodium metaperiodate for use in their tracer ammunition.\n\nPeriodate is part of a series of oxyanions in which iodine can assume oxidation states of −1, +1, +3, +5, or +7. A number of neutral iodine oxides are also known.\n\n"}

As a French military officer, Dugué held a succession of posts from 1699 to 1726 at France's settlements on the Gulf Coast and on the Mississippi River in present-day Illinois. He served at various times as commander of outposts at Mobile, Natchez, Louisiana, and the area known as the Illinois Country during his military career.\n\nDugué was a cousin and fellow officer of brothers (Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne de Bienville and Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville), with whom he served on expeditions during French colonization in North America. Their achievements included capturing English fortifications in Canada, and founding the colonies at Mobile and New Orleans.\n\nIn 1719, Dugué led an expedition to the area south of present-day St. Louis. Eighteen miles north of the Jesuit mission at Kaskaskia, he established an outpost that he named Fort de Chartres. The fort became the center of military and civilian activity in the area known as Upper Louisiana and the Illinois Country. From 1724-1726, Dugué served in New Orleans as Governor of Louisiana in the first French era after his predecessor Bienville returned to France for an extended period of time.\n\nWhile commandant of Fort de Chartres, Dugué conveyed land nearby to his nephew, Ste. Therese Langlois, who founded the town of Prairie du Rocher (\"Prairie of the Rock\") on the site. The town is one of the oldest French colonial communities to survive into the 21st Century in the American Midwest.\n\nLike several other French colonial commanders, Dugué was recalled to France in the 1720s to answer charges of mismanagement. He was then replaced as governor of Louisiana by Étienne Périer in 1727. He lost his military commission, but was later awarded a pension by the king. He died in France on June 7, 1736.\n\nRegarding the name \"Dugué\", translation errors and imprecision led to several spellings, including \"Duguay\", \"Dugay\" and \"Duqué\". The name \"Boisbriand\", which refers to the family's property in Canada, also appears as \"Boisbriant\". Sometimes, this name is used alone. Thus, \"Pierre Dugué, sieur de Boisbriand\" is sometimes identified as simply \"Sieur de Boisbriand\" or even \"Pierre Boisbriand\" (or \"Boisbriant\") in contemporary texts.\n\n"}

Written by Robert Mark Kamen, Mark Miller, and Harvey Weitzman, it is about a young soldier returning home from World War II who is looking to settle down and start a family with the woman he impulsively married just before enlisting. After learning she is not what he imagined her to be, he heads north alone to Sacramento in search of work. Along the way he meets a beautiful young woman who is heading home from college to her family vineyard to help with the grape harvest. When he learns she is pregnant and was abandoned by her boyfriend, he offers to stand in as her husband so she can face her Old World domineering father. During his stay at the vineyard, they fall in love and face the angry rejection of her father together. The film is based on the 1942 Italian film \"Four Steps in the Clouds\", written by Piero Tellini, Cesare Zavattini, and Vittorio de Benedetti.\n\nIn 1945, after World War II, United States Army Sgt. Paul Sutton returns to San Francisco to reunite with his wife, Betty, whom he married, following a whirlwind courtship, the day before he departed for the Pacific. The war has left him with emotional scars, and he experiences flashbacks on a regular basis.\n\nPaul's reunion with Betty is strained, especially after he discovers that, although he has written her \"almost every day\", she stopped reading them after the first few, and keeps the hundreds of unopened letters in a footlocker. He is determined to make a go of the marriage, however, and hopes to establish a new career for himself. She insists he continue to sell chocolates door-to-door, and he sets off to Sacramento. En route, he meets fellow train passenger Victoria Aragon, a graduate student whose Mexican-American family owns a vineyard in the Napa Valley. When Victoria is accosted by two men on their bus to Sacramento, Paul intervenes and ends up beating up the men in self-defense. After all three men are kicked off the bus as a result, Paul finds a crying Victoria alone, further down the road. When he learns she is pregnant by her professor, Paul offers to introduce himself to her very traditionalist family as her husband.\n\nVictoria's father, Alberto, is infuriated, not only that she married a man below her social standing, but without his permission as well. Paul's initial plan to quietly slip away and continue on his journey, leaving her family to believe he abandoned her, is derailed when her grandfather, Don Pedro, encourages him to stay and help with the harvest. During the harvest, Paul (an orphan) grows closer to the family and learns the joys that come with their tradition, roots, and way of life. He and Victoria try to ignore their growing attraction and feelings for each other, but with little success. However, his honor prompts him to attempt to salvage his marriage and return home, but when he does he discovers Betty is involved with another man. She has applied for an annulment, to which he happily agrees, and he returns to the Aragon estate to ask Victoria to marry him.\n\nWhen Paul returns, an argument with an angry and drunk Alberto leads to a disastrous fire which destroys the vineyard. However, Paul remembers one plant that may still have its roots intact, races off to retrieve it, and bring them back to the family. The disaster (as well as Paul's bravery and dedication during it) has brought Alberto to realize his errors, so when Paul returns with the plant, Alberto accepts him, telling him that this is \"his family\" and \"his roots\". They set out to replant and rebuild with the help of their newest member.\n\n\nThe screenplay for the film was written by Robert Mark Kamen, Mark Miller, and Harvey Weitzman. It was based on the 1942 Italian film \"Four Steps in the Clouds\", written by Piero Tellini, Cesare Zavattini, and Vittorio de Benedetti.\n\nPrincipal photography took place on location among the wineries of Napa Valley and in the towns of Napa, St. Helena, and Sonoma. The Napa wineries included Mayacamas Vineyards and Mount Veeder Winery. The St. Helena wineries included Beringer Vineyards, the Redwood Cellar of the Charles Krug Winery, and the Duckhorn Vineyards. In Sonoma, the Haywood Vineyards was also used.\n\nAdditional filming outside the Napa Valley region took place in San Pedro, the harbor to the south of Los Angeles. The wine festival scene was actually staged in the Large Courtyard of Pasadena City Hall in Pasadena, east of Los Angeles.\n\n\nThe film score was written by Maurice Jarre, and included four songs:\n\nStarting with a budget of $20 million, the film earned $50,008,143 in gross revenue in the United States.\n\nRoger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" gave the film four out of four stars, his highest rating, writing:\nMick LaSalle of the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" wrote:\nOn the other hand, Hal Hinson of the \"Washington Post\" called it \"a phenomenally atrocious movie—so bad, in fact, that you might actually manage to squeeze a few laughs out of it...The film has the syrupy, Kodak magic-moment look of a Bo Derek movie, and pretty much the same level of substance.\"\n\n\"Variety\" described the film as \"a glossy, fairy-tale romance that's longer on wishfulness than believability\" and \"a modest but sharply-mounted comedy/melodrama.\"\n\nAs of March 2019, \"A Walk in the Clouds\" holds a rating of 44% on Rotten Tomatoes from 27 reviews with the consensus: \"\"A Walk in the Clouds\" aims for sweeping period romance, but quickly unravels thanks to a miscast leading man and a story that relies on cheap melodrama.\"\n\nMaurice Jarre won the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score.\n\n"}

{"id": "2122523", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2122523", "title": "Moral luck", "text": "Moral luck\n\nMoral luck describes circumstances whereby a moral agent is assigned moral blame or praise for an action or its consequences even if it is clear that said agent did not have full control over either the action or its consequences. This term, introduced by Bernard Williams, has been developed, along with its significance to a coherent moral theory, by Williams and Thomas Nagel in their respective essays on the subject.\n\nBroadly speaking, human beings tend to correlate, at least intuitively, responsibility and voluntary action. Thus, the most blame is assigned to persons for their actions and the consequences they entail when we have good cause to believe that both:\n\nConversely, there is a tendency to be much more sympathetic to those who satisfy any of the following conditions:\n\nParenthetically, the above criteria do not correlate exactly with moral praise – while it may be true that one can, and should assign a good deal of moral praise to those who had performed a good action, or an action entailing good consequences, completely on their own volition and uncoerced, it is debatable that the same distinction holds for involuntary actions that happened to turn out well or happened to produce good outcomes.\n\nThis correlation between responsibility and voluntary action is acceptable to most people on an intuitive level; indeed, this correlation is echoed in American and European law: for this reason, for example, manslaughter, or killing in self-defense carries a significantly different type of legal punishment (i.e., formalized moral blame) than premeditated murder.\n\nGiven the notion of equating moral responsibility with voluntary action, however, moral luck leads to counterintuitive solutions. This is illustrated by an example of a traffic accident. Driver A, in a moment of inattention, runs a red light as a child is crossing the street. Driver A tries to avoid hitting the child but fails and the child dies. Driver B also runs a red light, but no one is crossing and only gets a traffic ticket. \n\nIf a bystander is asked to morally evaluate Drivers A and B, they may assign Driver A more moral blame than Driver B because Driver A's course of action resulted in a death. However, there are no differences in the controllable actions performed by Drivers A and B. The only disparity is an external uncontrollable event. If it is given that moral responsibility should only be relevant when the agent voluntarily performed or failed to perform some action, Drivers A and B should be blamed equally. This may be intuitively problematic, as one situation resulted in a death.\n\nThomas Nagel (1979) identified four kinds of moral luck in his essay. The kind most relevant to the above example is \"resultant moral luck\".\n\nResultant moral luck concerns the consequences of actions and situations. In the above example, both drivers were affected by resultant moral luck in that a particular set of circumstances turned out in two different ways: in one situation, a pedestrian appeared on the road; in the other, the pedestrian did not.\n\nCircumstantial moral luck concerns the surroundings of the moral agent. The best-known example is provided in Nagel's essay. Consider Nazi followers and supporters in Hitler's Germany. They were and are worthy of moral blame either for committing morally reprehensible deeds or for allowing them to occur without making efforts to oppose them. But, if in 1929, those people were moved to some other country, away from the coming hostilities by their employers, it is quite possible that they would have led very different lives, and we could not assign the same amount of moral blame to them. It is down, then, to the luck of the circumstances in which they find themselves.\n\nConstitutive moral luck concerns the personal character of a moral agent. There can be little argument that education, upbringing, genes and other largely uncontrollable influences shape personality to some extent. Furthermore, one's personality dictates one's actions to some extent. Moral blame is assigned to an individual for being extremely selfish, even though that selfishness is almost certainly due in part to external environmental effects.\n\nCausal moral luck, which equates largely with the problem of free will, is the least-detailed of the varieties that Thomas Nagel describes. The general definition is that actions are determined by external events and are thus consequences of events over which the person taking the action has no control. Since people are restricted in their choice of actions by the events that precede them, they should not be held accountable or responsible for such actions.\n\nThomas Nagel has been criticized by Dana Nelkin for including causal moral luck as a separate category, since it appears largely redundant. It does not cover any cases that are not already included in constitutive and circumstantial luck, and seems to exist only for the purpose of bringing up the problem of free will.\n\nSome philosophers, such as Susan Wolf, have tried to come up with \"happy mediums\" that strike a balance between rejecting moral luck outright and accepting it wholesale. Wolf introduced the notions of rationalist and irrationalist positions as part of such a reconciliation.\n\nThe rationalist position, stated simply, is that equal fault deserves equal blame. For example, given two drivers, both of whom failed to check their brakes before driving, one of them runs over a pedestrian as a consequence while the other does not. The rationalist would say that since both of the drivers were equally at fault in failing to check their brakes, it should make no difference that one of them was lucky in not hitting a pedestrian while the other was unlucky – moral fault is independent of consequence. Since the fault here is equal, the agents should receive equal blame.\n\nThe consequentialist position argues that equal fault need not deserve equal blame, as blame should depend on the consequences. By this logic, the lucky driver certainly does not deserve as much blame as the unlucky driver, even though their faults were identical.\n\nWolf combines these two approaches in trying to reconcile the tensions associated with moral luck by introducing the concept of a virtuous agent. A virtuous agent should accept that they have a special connection with the consequences of their actions, including equal-fault cases (such as the lucky/unlucky drivers above), and even in no-fault cases. This argument essentially retains the rationalist claim that equal fault is equally deserving of blame while also retaining the consequentialist claim that different outcomes should result in moral agents feeling and acting differently.\n\nIt is important to underline the distinction between internal and external moral blame or praise. Wolf believes that the outsiders should blame the lucky and unlucky drivers equally despite their intuition that the two of them should not feel equally bad (i.e., the unlucky driver that ran over a pedestrian should feel worse). \"However\", the unlucky driver themselves should voluntarily accept the notion of the special connection between their actions and the unfortunate consequences, and assign more blame to themselves than the lucky driver should.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2122524", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2122524", "title": "Black Cat Track", "text": "Black Cat Track\n\nThe Black Cat Track or Trail is a rough overland track in Morobe Province, Papua New Guinea. It runs from the village of Salamaua on the coast of the Huon Gulf, south into the mountains to the township of Wau. In the 21st century despite being a difficult journey it became a hiking destination for international trekkers.\n\nThe name is taken from the Black Cat Gold Mine in Wau. It is also known as the Skindawai Track.\n\nThe track started out in the 1920s and 30s as a trail for prospectors seeking to get rich on the gold in Wau. They traveled from the port Salamaua on a treacherous 3 to 4-day hike through leech-infested territory, a trail that recently has been described as \"suitable only for masochists and Israeli Paratroopers\".\n\nBefore Errol Flynn (who grew up in Australia and New Guinea) became an actor in 1933, he hiked this trail and commented that it was a rigorous march through leech-infested jungle, in constant fear of ambush, and lying awake at night wondering \"whether that crawly sound you heard a few feet away might be a snake, a cassowary or maybe only a wild boar razorback ... I have seen Central Africa, but it was never anything like the jungle of New Guinea.\"\n\nOn 8 March 1942 in World War II, the town of Salamaua was captured by the Japanese. They had tried to take Port Moresby by sea, but were defeated in the Battle of the Coral Sea. Now they were going to take it by land. They tried to take the capital by going over the Owen Stanley mountain range, by the Kokoda Track, basing the operation out of Salamaua. They almost made it this time but were pushed back 30 miles short of the city, in a series of bloody battles. After this they converted Salamaua into a major supply base. After a few months had passed, they made their final attempt at Port Moresby, the Black Cat Trail. If they could capture the Allied Air Base in Wau, they could launch an offensive on the capital that would have overwhelmed the Australians, Americans, and Papua New Guinea Militia stationed there.\nThe Japanese attacked in force, but the Australian 17th Brigade, under Major-General Stanley Savige, held out until reinforcements (The three independent companies 2/3rd, 2/5th and 2/7th) arrived. Then on 23 April, the allies struck back along the trail, taking it until the hills called The Pimple, and Observation Hill. The Japanese were firmly entrenched there. The 2/7th attacked The Pimple, with mortar support, after it had been strafed by four aircraft, but the Japanese were too firmly entrenched, and the Australian advance was halted. The next day, they attacked again, supported by aircraft and the 1st mountain battery, limited to fifty rounds a gun, but again the attack failed. On 7 May, they attacked again, but again were driven back. Then on 9 May, the Japanese launched their own attack in the Pimple area. They surrounded the foremost Australian Company and started closing in. The Australians were not relieved until the afternoon of 11 May. By this time they had withstood eight attacks from parts of two Japanese battalions. The following day, they took The Pimple, supported by field guns, where before there had been only two mountain batteries.\n\nThe 2/3rd battalion had been pressing along while the 2/7th tried to take The Pimple, and in early May, they came to the Bobdubi Ridge. Seeing that it was only lightly held, they attacked it, and captured it on 4 May. They then held off all Japanese trying to retake it. From Bobdubi, the 2/3rd battalion severely harassed the Japanese. Their tactics were so successful that Major-General Savige had to tell them not to attempt too much, as \"premature commitments in the Salamaua area could not be backed at present by an adequate force.\" Then on 14 May, the Japanese launched a full-scale attack, supported by guns and mortars, forcing the Australians to withdraw. On the 15th, over 100 Japanese planes attacked Australian positions in three raids, and on the 17th and 18th they raided the Wau airdrome.\n\nIn late May the 2/6th battalion arrived to relieve the 2/7th, and the 15th brigade headquarters and another battalion of that brigade started arriving in Savige's area. In mid June, the allies started acting as if they were going to attack Salamaua, but really the target was Lae, on the other side of the Huon Gulf. The Japanese fell for this and on the 19th and 20th, they seemed to anticipate an attack, and started patrolling aggressively. The plan worked as planned, but the allies didn't attack until early September. On 26 August, General Milford relieved Savige, with his 5th division headquarters. Salamaua was captured on 11 September 1943, a week after the Lae offensive began. Five days later Lae was taken.\n\nThe Black Cat Track is a tough course recommended only for \"very fit and experienced trekkers\".\n\nOn 10 September 2013 a trekking expedition was attacked by bandits known as \"Rascals.\" Two expedition porters were killed in the attack, and another died from the effects of wounds inflicted during the attack. Six people were arrested. The expedition's porters were targeted much more than the international trekkers, and the attack is believed to have been caused by a grudge related to money and the hiring of porters from different villages along the trekking route.\n\n"}

It is located at the northern end of the Southport Spit where the Nerang River enters the Pacific Ocean. \nThe channel was constructed between 1984 and 1986, primarily to facilitate the safe passage of sea-faring vessels. The passage was previously known as the Southport Bar. The mouth of the Nerang River was once located further south in Broadbeach. The main driving force for this movement is the northward drift of sand along the coast. This northward drift was responsible for the unstable and shifting conditions of the bar, which made crossing it so hazardous for small boats. The southern training wall of the Gold Coast Seaway is the northern end of the Gold Coast Oceanway.\n\nTwo rock walls to stabilise the position of the entrance were constructed. To reduce the entry of ocean swells the breakwater walls were aligned 15 degrees north of east and increasing the length of the southern wall. Models indicated that the western shores of the Broadwater would need further protection from waves. Wave Break Island was constructed from dredged material to act as a barrier.\n\nThe channel is 250 metres wide. The mean depth is 11 m and it has a maximum depth of 20 m. During outgoing tides, excess treated wastewater from four sewage treatment plants is released into the channel.\n\nGold Coast Seaway enjoys the world's first permanent sand bypassing system, which currently delivers all sand that arrives at the Gold Coast Seaway across the entrance and into the Moreton Bay Marine Park. Up to 500 cubic metres of sand can be moved per hour. The Gold Coast Shoreline Management Plan is reviewing this practice and examining the concept of Island welding to determine if 85% of the sand (80,000 cubic metres per year) can be sustainably recycled to Surfers Paradise. This system works by pumping the sand through the jetty and delivers it away to clear the channel.\n\nPromising a result of \"no dingoes,\" Mayor Ron Clarke has proposed building a tunnel under the Seaway, which would link to South Stradbroke Island. His controversial proposal is based upon an end result of making Stradbroke into Australia's premiere eco-tourist destination.\n\nGold Coast Seaway is a popular diving and fishing location. Many surfers and body boarders regularly paddle across the seaway on their boards from the mainland to South Stradbroke Island. Popular surfing sites include the sand pumping jetty on the mainland and the sand pumping outlets on South Stradbroke Island.\n\n\n"}

The book became an international best-seller during the 1960s debate about the morality of the World War II area bombing of the civilian population of Nazi Germany. The book is no longer considered to be an authoritative or reliable account of the Allied bombing and destruction of Dresden during February 1945.\n\nThe book, an international best seller when published in the 1960s, is based on a series of 37 articles about strategic bombing during World War II titled \"Wie Deutschlands Städte starben\" (\"How Germany's Cities Died\") which Irving wrote for the German journal \"Neue Illustrierte\".\n\nIn the first edition, Irving estimated that the two RAF raids and the first USAAF raid combined were \"estimated authoritatively to have killed more than 135,000 of the population [of Dresden]...\" and the \"documentation suggests very strongly that the figure was certainly between a minimum of 100,000 and a maximum of 250,000\". In 1965, General Ira C. Eaker identified the number as 135,000.\n\nIrving's first edition figures became widely accepted and were used in many standard reference works. In later editions of the book over the next three decades, he gradually adjusted the figure to:\n\nAccording to Richard J. Evans, an expert witness for the defence at the 2000 libel trial of Deborah Lipstadt, Irving based his estimates of the dead at Dresden on the word of one individual, Hans Voigt, who provided no supporting documentation, used forged documents, and described one witness named Max Funfack as Dresden's Deputy Chief Medical Officer. Funfack had made it clear by letter to Irving on 19 January 1965 that he had not been either the Chief or Deputy Chief Medical Officer in Dresden, that he had no knowledge of any documentation about the number of people who were killed in the bombing, and during the war he had only heard rumours, which varied greatly, over the number of people who were killed in the raids.\n\nThe writer Kurt Vonnegut (who witnessed the bombing of Dresden from the basement of a slaughterhouse as a prisoner of war) used \"The Destruction of Dresden\" as a source for the 1969 novel \"Slaughterhouse Five\" where he wrote that he emerged from the slaughterhouse to discover that \"135,000 Hansels and Gretels had been baked like gingerbread men\".\n\n"}

The estuary reaches from the locality of in the south, to the southern section of the UNESCO World Heritage Listed Moreton Bay in the north. Separated via the Seaway from the Coral Sea by a thin strip of land called Stradbroke Island, the original body of water was a lagoon created from water deposited from the Nerang River. Part of the Broadwater is contained within the Moreton Bay Marine Park.\n\nThe entrance of the Nerang River was at Main Beach in the late 19th century but by the 1980s had moved about northwards. The Seaway was completed in 1986 to stabilise the location of the Nerang River Entrance. Its construction has allowed greater tidal flows. This has created a larger tidal range within the Broadwater with lower low tides. Towards the northern end of the broadwater the Pimpama River enters. The broadwater is very large and contains lots of species of marine life. Gold Coast Ferries operates a number of services across the waterway.\n\nThe Broadwater has undergone dramatic changes since the 1970s including the construction of an extensive number and network of artificial waterways that account for up to 90% of Australia's canal estates. Positioned in one of the fastest growing regions in the developed world, urbanisation surrounding the Broadwater is expected to continue. The region has important biodiversity values that have led to areas of the Broadwater listed as an international Ramsar site and inclusion to international migratory bird arrangements. The Broadwater provides a vital function in the provision of feeding, spawning and nursery sites for recreationally and commercially important finfish species.\n\nThe Broadwater catchment includes a number of watercourses including the Logan/Albert, Coomera, Pimpama and Nerang Rivers. Creeks such as the Loders, Biggera and Behm and Wasp also flow into the estuary.\n\nThe most common seagrass species in the body of water is \"Zostera muelleri\" which grows in the shallower parts. \"Halophila ovalis\" and \"Halophila spinulosa\" are also found in the deeper waters of the Broadwater.\n\nCaptain Patrick Logan was the first European to discover this southern entrance to Moreton Bay. In the early 1880s the first Southport Pier was opened to the public. On 26 November 1925, the Jubilee Bridge opened to pedestrian and vehicular traffic, becoming the first bridge to be erected in the Broadwater area. The bridge provided direct access between Southport and Main Beach and offered an alternative to, and eventually replaced, the ferry services which had transported passengers from the jetty, in the vicinity of later day Barney Street, across the water at the point where the Nerang River meets the Broadwater.\n\nIn 1966-1967, the Jubilee Bridge was replaced by the Gold Coast Bridge, colloquially known as the Sundale Bridge due to its proximity to the Sundale Shopping Centre. The two bridges were on different alignments and, for a period of time, both were in place until the demolition of the earlier bridge commenced. The Jubilee Bridge was on an east-west alignment commencing at Queen Street, Southport before ending in the vicinity of the Southport Yacht Club at Main Beach on the southern bank of the Nerang River. The Gold Coast Bridge was on a north-south alignment following the path of the Gold Coast Highway. The Gold Coast Bridge has since been joined by a bridge for light rail on its western side and a pedestrian bridge on its eastern side.\n\nConstruction of the Gold Coast Seaway was undertaken between 1984 and 1986. Plans for a cruise ship terminal and resort on Wave Break Island were rejected by the Queensland Government in 2015.\n\nThe Broadwaterway is a foreshoreway along the foreshores of the Gold Coast Broadwater.

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Detroit Tigers, Texas Rangers, and Seattle Mariners over his 5-year major league career. Shelton is a cousin of Washington Redskins quarterback Alex Smith.\n\nBefore entering professional baseball, he played at Cottonwood High School, Salt Lake Community College, and the University of Utah. While playing with Utah, Shelton was named to the Mountain West Conference All-Tournament Team as a junior.\n\nShelton was drafted by the Pittsburgh Pirates in the 33rd round, although he never made the team's 40-man roster. Unprotected, he was selected by the Detroit Tigers in the Rule 5 draft. In 2004, he played sparingly because the Tigers had to keep him on their roster because of the Rule 5 rules. He only batted 57 times.\n\nWhile in Detroit, due to his red hair and prodigious batting, he had earned various nicknames, such as \"Red Pop\" (a reference to the Detroit-made Faygo beverage) from the Tiger faithful. Tigers play-by-play commentators Rod Allen and Mario Impemba often called him \"Big Red\" or \"Orange Crush.\"\n\nOn April 15, 2004, Shelton made his major league debut with the Detroit Tigers as a pinch hitter against the Toronto Blue Jays. He went hitless in two at-bats as Roy Halladay pitched a complete game shutout against the Tigers.\n\nIn , Shelton hit nine home runs in the first 13 games of the season; this made him the fastest player in American League history to reach that mark at that point in a season. He also became the fourth player in baseball history to hit at least nine home runs in his team's first 13 games; he trails only Mike Schmidt in , Larry Walker in , and Luis Gonzalez in in that regard. He earned the American League Player of the Week accolade for April 3, 2006. Shelton's power dropped significantly after April, however, and on July 31, 2006, he was optioned to Triple-A Toledo to make room for Sean Casey, whom the Tigers had acquired from Pittsburgh in a trade-deadline deal. On September 1, Shelton was recalled back to Detroit as an emergency catcher for Iván Rodríguez.\n\nDuring spring training, Shelton started and finished spring training with the Tigers and by the end of spring training there was one spot left on the team's roster and the fight was between Marcus Thames and Chris Shelton. Shelton did not make the roster, which left him heading to Toledo for the 2007 season.\n\nOn December 5, 2007, Shelton was traded to the Texas Rangers for Freddy Guzmán, and on January 14, , designated for assignment in order to make room for Kazuo Fukumori, a veteran reliever from the Japanese leagues. His contract was then purchased on April 29, 2008, from the Triple-A Oklahoma RedHawks, again by the Texas Rangers, when Jason Botts was designated for assignment. On June 26, 2008, the strikeout prone Shelton was designated for assignment to make way for Chris Davis. He cleared waivers, and was reassigned once more to the RedHawks. Shelton became a free agent at the end of the season.\n\nOn December 8, 2008, Shelton signed a minor league contract with the Seattle Mariners. He batted .460 during 2009 spring training (.534 OBP, .720 SLG), second on the team among players with at least 30 at-bats, but did not break camp with the major-league club. On July 10, 2009, the Seattle Mariners called up Shelton to add more pop on the bench and he came through with the game-winning run on July 12 delivering the winning run in a Seattle Mariners win. Shelton was designated for assignment by the Mariners on August 1, 2009. His contract was then purchased on August 5, 2009, from the Triple-A Tacoma Rainiers.\n\nHe was granted free agency on October 15, .\n\nShelton signed a minor league contract on December 8, 2009 with Houston Astros\n\nShelton became a free agent after the 2010 season. On February 20, 2011, he signed a minor league contract with the New York Mets for the 2011 season.\n\nShelton was released before the season began at Triple A for the New York Mets minor league team.\n"}
{"id": "2122553", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2122553", "title": "Kettuvallam", "text": "Kettuvallam\n\nKettuvallam is a house boat widely used in the Indian state of Kerala. These have thatched roof covers over wooden hulls. The traditional kettuvallam is mainly used for promoting Kerala tourism.\n\nIn the Malayalam language \"kettu\" means \"to tie\" and \"vallam\" means boat – the two together make the local name \"kettuvallam”. Each houseboat is constructed using the ancient principles and techniques of boat building by the local carpenters using 'Anjili' wood. Coir ropes are used for tightening the wooden planks together.\n\nBoats in a variety of shapes and sizes have traditionally been the main means of transport of men and materials in the Kerala backwaters since olden days. In particular, the house boats were used to ship rice and spices and other goods between Kuttanad and the Cochin port. It was a three-day affair in those days. A standard house boat, which could be about 100 feet long, can hold up to 30 tons, about as much as three big lorries can carry. For the royalty these boats even became comfortable living quarters. It was the important mode of transportation in coastal Kerala just because of its accessibility to the most remote areas. However, the scenario changed. Motorized road, rail and air transportation scored over the slow and staid country boat, with people opting for speed.\n\nA kettuvallam is about 100 feet in length and has a width of around 13 feet in the middle. The materials that go into the making are local and ecofriendly; bamboo poles, coconut fibre, ropes, bamboo mats, carpets etc. The main wood used is \"Anjili\" (\"Artocarpus hirsuta\"). There are houseboats with fully furnished single room, double room and triple rooms.\n\nThe hull is a series of wooden planks, long cut and carved, tied together using coir with coconut fibers stuffed in between. The hull which is made of hundreds of fine but heavy-duty planks of jack-wood is held together absolutely by coir knots (not a single nail is used). This framework is then coated with a caustic black resin extracted from boiled cashew kernels. And it lasts for generations. The kettuvallam is motorised and is steered in deep waters by means of oars. Long bamboo poles or 'punts' are used to propel in shallow areas. Bamboo beams sprouting off on the sides are used as footholds for the same. Bamboo is used for the framework of the roof and splits of bamboo are used for weaving mat for roofing.\n\nBasically the kettuvallam was designed to transport cargo and as such many design changes had to be made to make it a tourist vehicle. The height of the roof was increased to get sufficient headroom. A plank was laid all through the length for ease of walking and comfortable seating, to reduce the disadvantages of the curved shape of the hull. Windows and other openings were provided for light, airflow and view. The entrance is provided in the centre of the linear axis with a top hung panel.\n\nMost of the latest designs have incorporated three bedrooms with toilets, a living space and kitchen. Of course, there are variations. Some have a lesser number of bedrooms but with a large living space and maybe a deck balcony at the roof level. Normally, the platforms that cantilever from the hull are used as balconies. Innovative changes have been made to accommodate modern fittings. For fixing the toilet seats, shower tray and ceramic floor finish a concrete slab is laid at the floor level. These toilettes are made of steel cabinets with a network of steel meshes on which beneficial bacteria are grown with the help of a catalyst named actizyme. These bacteria feed upon human excreta and produce a harmless germ free colourless byproduct. The soil outlets of the toilet seats are taken through the hull and let out to the flowing water beneath. The use of bio-toilette is common nowadays. Thus the backwater canals are not polluted. The water for use is stored in a plastic tank kept at the top portion of the main body connecting to the kitchen and toilets. The pipes, tank and other synthetic materials are covered with coir or panambu to maintain the aesthetic quality of the eco-friendly materials.\n\nModern houseboats have been designed to meet the Green Palm/Gold Star Certifications by the Department of Tourism, Government of Kerala, which has recently enacted regulations, stipulating the standards of Kerala houseboats or Kettuvallams.\n\nYears ago, A. G. Sudhakaran built steel fishing and Kochi's first-ever `junkar' that plied between Fort Kochi and Vypeen. Subsequently, Samudra Shipyard (P) Limited, Aroor, managed by his sons, has given shape to another innovative holiday idea - a traditional kettuvallam made out of fibreglass. This is the first of its kind in India.\n\nKerala was placed among the `50 destinations of a lifetime' by National Geographic Traveler in a special collectors' issue released just before the turn of the millennium.\n\nThe Hindu wrote, \"A cruise along the mirror-still lagoons, picture-book lakeside, palm-fringed canals and shimmering rivulets of `God's Own Country' is the most enchanting holidaying experience in the country. With a cruise along the palm-fringed waterways turning to be part and parcel of holidayers' itinerary, the traditional kettuvallam has emerged as the mascot of Kerala Tourism.\"\n\nMore than 900 kettuvallams ply the backwaters and there are various routes which are popular among the tourists.\n\nAlappuzha is the citadel of house boats. There are some 120 of them, well maintained and perfected as luxury liners there. The house boats have all the creature comforts of a good hotel: well-furnished bedrooms, modern hygienic toilets, cosy living rooms, a beautiful kitchen and in some cases even a balcony for angling. The crew of a kettuvallam comprises two oarsmen and a cook. Fresh food, cooked in inimitable Kuttanadan style is the rage of the international tourists. Tourists can opt for a day cruise or an overnight stay in a houseboat. Most tourists prefer to stay overnight in a houseboat or kettuvallam as it offers a holistic backwater experience.\n\nTour operators had been coming out with innovative options. The Kannur District Tourism Council has launched a `Nadi Darshan' (river viewing) programme in association with a private resort at Kattampalli as an initiative to popularise the kettuvallam for tourism promotion and as effort to let people know more about the Valapattanam River, one of the largest rivers in the region and the life stream of the district.\n\nA seafood eatery has been opened in a kettuvallam on Kaloor- Kadvanthra Road. \n"}

She graduated in 1918 from Wheaton College in Norton, Massachusetts. She worked for the Women's Division of the U.S. Employment Service of the Department of Labor, and was the first woman appointed to the Democratic National Committee in 1925. She was also the editor of the \"Woman's National Democratic Committee's Bulletin\" (1929–32), and the first woman to chair the Federal Prison for Women Board.\n\nFinally, she was a strong supporter of the arts and served as chair of the President's Music Committee's Person-to-Person Program (1957–1963). In 1966 she donated her personal property, Wolf Trap Farm, to the National Park Service. This farm would go on to become Wolf Trap National Park for the Performing Arts, where Shouse would serve as founder until her death in 1994.\n\nCatherine Filene was born on June 9, 1896, in Boston, Massachusetts, to Abraham Lincoln Filene and the former Thérèse Weill. Born into a wealthy merchandising family, her grandfather William Filene founded Filene's department store, and her mother started the Boston Music School for Underprivileged Children.\n\nWhen Shouse was an undergraduate student at Wheaton College, she convened a lecture series. It was the first Intercollegiate Vocational Conference for Women. The focus of the conference was to make jobs more accessible for women. The lecture series was held at Wheaton College and it initiated annual vocational conferences at Wheaton College until the 1950s. Shouse then proceeded to found Wheaton's first Vocational Bureau, which assisted alumnae in locating employment. In 1917, Shouse was able to utilize experience acquired through her undergraduate and her prior activist activities. She was employed by the Women's Division of the United States Employment Service of the Department of Labor. Shouse was hired as the assistant to the chief. Three years later (1920), she published her original work, \"Careers for Women\", which Shouse revised in 1934. Her personally signed first copy is housed in Hood College's Catherine Filene Shouse Career Center. Hood College named their career center after Shouse after her substantial contribution which enabled the college to obtain most of their modern technological equipment for worldwide career information.\n\nPresident Calvin Coolidge appointed Shouse chair of the Federal Prison for Women in 1926. She was the first woman to occupy this position and immediately began to transform the system. Shouse established job training and rehabilitation programs. Three years later (1929), Shouse created the Institute of Women's Professional Relations. This organization hosted national conferences that highlighted opportunities for women with education beyond high school. In 1925, Shouse was the first woman to be appointed to the Democratic National Committee. Four years later, she served as editor of the Women's National Democratic Committee's Bulletin from 1929 to 1932.\n\nShouse was a prolific supporter of the arts. She was a volunteer fundraiser for the National Symphony Orchestra. Candlelight Concerts in Washington, D.C., were organized and sponsored by Shouse from 1935 to 1942 in order to supplement the National Symphony Orchestra's salaries. She was the first to do such. From 1957 to 1963, Shouse served as chair of the President's Music Committee's Person-to-Person Program. During her tenure, the program produced annual national and international performances. Under Shouse's direction, the President's Music Committee's Person-to-Person Program organized the first International Jazz Festival in 1962, which was one year after Shouse donated forty acres of her farm at Wolf Trap to the American Symphony Orchestra (1961).\n\n1935 Member, Board of Directors, Community Chest, Washington.\n\n1947 Trustee, Filene Foundation (Boston)\n\n1949 Elected to Board of National Symphony Orchestra Association; vice president, 1951–68; honorary vice president, 1968\n\n1952–63 Board, National Arbitration Association.\n\n1955 Board, Lincoln Filene Center of Citizenship and Public Affairs, Tufts University.\n\n1965–72 Board, Opera Society of Washington.\n\n1968 Board, Wolf Trap Foundation.

Shouse believed children should have the opportunity to learn about nature and animals and she wanted her children to be closer to nature than would be possible living in her urbanized Georgetown residence.\n\nConsequently, she set out to look for a farm. Shouse – who was short on money but long on conviction – got into her car in 1930, with a friend visiting from Boston, and drove out of Georgetown into Virginia. Shouse encountered large tracts of farmland in Vienna, Virginia. She asked a man who was standing in the road if any of the land was for sale. The man replied, \"Nothing for sale. Everybody keeps his land because the division was made after the American Civil War, 52 acre properties, and because of them we don't want any strangers coming in.\" Undeterred, Shouse continued to look for properties. That evening however, while reading through the classified ads in the newspaper, she came across a property for sale advertisement. It was the exact farm she inquired about earlier that day. In February 1930, Shouse bought The Wolf Trap Farm for $5,300.00.\n\nInitially, Shouse grew oats, wheat, alfalfa and other farm items for family and friends. However, at the advent of and during World War II, Shouse's Wolf Trap Farm fed many more. Fresh produce (and food in general) was scarce during the war years and scores of people were allowed to take advantage of Wolf Trap.\n\nWolf Trap also frequently hosted notable foreign and domestic political figures. In a 1994 interview, Shouse recalls, \"I remember the night…that Lord Halifax, the British Ambassador, called and told me, 'I'll bring Dumbarton Oaks British representatives to dinner tomorrow night with you. They haven't seen a whole ham, a whole chicken, or much food of any kind since the beginning of the war.' They came on an August evening….and the Lord Halifax watched their eating and drinking because the next morning was the Dumbarton Oaks meeting of the many countries, and you know the Dumbarton was the predecessor of the United Nations.\"\n\nDuring World War II, Wolf Trap became a haven for many American soldiers on leave. According to Shouse, \"During the war it became an oasis for many of the people on leave. And General [Omar] Bradley came back from the big horrible battle and that horrible experience that our people had in Luxembourg. He was here. General [George C.] Marshall came out ... Wolf Trap meant a great deal, not only to the people here, but to people that were abroad.\"\n\nWhen Shouse bought Wolf Trap, it came with a dilapidated farmhouse on the property. Shouse used the last of her savings to buy the initial plot of land. Thus, Shouse along with family and friends physically renovated the house (and property) themselves, using whatever resources they could get their hands on. She also added to the initial property. Whenever she obtained extra money, Shouse would buy adjacent plots of land to add to Wolf Trap. Before long, Wolf Trap was 168 acres.\n\nWhile Shouse was alive, Wolf Trap was enjoyed by countless people from many nations and from myriad backgrounds. Shouse often brought disabled and disadvantaged children from Washington, D.C., to Wolf Trap to give them hayrides. Multitudes of people would come to Wolf Trap to enjoy a walk through the woods, picking laurel, etc. Shouse wanted people to be able to enjoy Wolf Trap even when she was no longer here.\n\nTo ensure that her dream would become a reality, Shouse approached the Secretary of the Interior Stewart Udall and asked, \"You have many parks for recreation, but you have nothing in the performing arts. And people find through performing arts their balance in tense times, their joys in their everyday life. Do you want Wolf Trap?\" That initial conversation with the Secretary of the Interior led to Shouse donating Wolf Trap to the federal government. The United States government officially accepted Wolf Trap in 1966 and designated it as a national park for the performing arts under the jurisdiction of the National Park Service – the first of its kind.\n\nAs the founder of Wolf Trap National Park for the Performing Arts, Shouse helped lead its development into one of the most prominent performing arts venues in the Washington D.C. area from the beginning. During the construction of the Filene Center—named after Shouse's parents, Mr. and Mrs. Lincoln Filene—in 1971, Shouse even visited and assisted workers on site, even offering sandwiches and other refreshments when possible. Shouse also helped design the Filene Center, working closely with renowned architects John H. MacFadyen and Edward F. Knowles to create a state-of-the-art venue that would still be able to \"retain the unspoiled atmosphere of the setting.\n\nIn Wolf Trap's early years, Shouse also frequently traveled the world to scout talent and performers, including persuading the Chinese government to allow the Performing Arts Company of the People's Republic to perform at Wolf Trap in 1978.\n\nIn 1982, at age 85, Shouse led a rigorous effort to rebuild the Filene Center, Wolf Trap's main performing arts venue, after it was destroyed by a fire that April. In addition to helping convince the federal government to donate $9 million to the project, Shouse helped to raise an additional $15 million from other sources for the effort. While the new Filene Center would be completed and re-opened in 1984, Shouse also helped salvage the 1982 and 1983 seasons by leading the construction of the Meadow Center, an enormous tent where performances would take place during these two years.\n\nIn 1991, Shouse was reportedly close to breaking ties with Wolf Trap over a dispute relating to the park's 20th anniversary. In honor of the anniversary, Shouse planned to put on a television special to celebrate the occasion, a plan shut down by the Wolf Trap Foundation's executive committee due to budget constraints (although the special would be resurrected later that year). Nevertheless, Shouse didn't resign and would stay with Wolf Trap until her death three years later.\n\nOn December 14, 1994, Shouse died of heart failure at her winter home in Naples, Florida on at the age of 98.\n\nNot only were Shouse's talents and abilities acknowledged and appreciated by local communities and organizations, her gifts were honored and utilized by many United States presidents. In addition to her appointment by President Calvin Coolidge to chair the first Federal Prison for Women, at the request of President Herbert Hoover, Shouse organized the Washington Hungarian Relief Fund and raised a half-million dollars in less than a month (1956). Shouse was appointed by President Dwight D. Eisenhower to chair the President's Music Committee from 1957 to 1963.\n\nPresident Eisenhower also appointed Shouse to the first board of trustees of the National Cultural Center (1958). President Nixon reappointed Shouse to that position in 1962. In 1964, the National Cultural Center was renamed The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts following the 1963 assassination of President John F. Kennedy. President Richard Nixon appointed Shouse to the Board of Trustees of the renamed Kennedy Center for a ten-year term in 1970. During that time, Shouse also served on the Executive and Building Committees of the Kennedy Center. Shouse was appointed to the Pennsylvania Avenue Development Commission in 1973 by President Nixon. She was appointed to the official commissions on women's rights by Presidents Ronald Reagan, Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, and John Kennedy. Last but not least, in 1975 President Gerald Ford appointed Shouse to the Commission on Presidential Scholars.\n\nIn addition to her presidential appointments, Shouse was appointed to the first Virginia Commission of the Arts and Humanities in 1968, by Governor Mills E. Godwin Jr.. In 1971, Shouse was reappointed to that position by Governor Linwood Holton.\n\n1918 B.A., Wheaton College, Norton, Massachusetts\n1923 M.Ed., Harvard University Graduate School of Education\n\n1963 Doctor of Humanities, Tufts University\n1964 Doctor of Humanities, Wheaton College\n1971 Doctor of Laws, American University\n1975 Doctor of Humanities, George Washington University\n1975 Doctor of Humanities, Bucknell University\n1975 Doctor of Music, The New England Conservatory of Music\n1977 Doctor of Humanities, Catholic University\n1977 Doctor of Humanities, College of William and Mary\n1979 Doctor of Humane Letters, University of Maryland\n1981 Doctor of Humanities, Hood College\n1983 Doctor of Letters, Gonzaga University\n1984 Doctor of Music, Shenandoah College & Conservatory of Music\n1986 Doctor of Humane Letters, Marymount University\n\nIn 1977, Shouse was presented with the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Gerald Ford, and was awarded the National Medal of Arts in 1994. In 2007, she was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame.\n\nShouse received myriad other awards, including the Living Legacy Award from the Women's International Center, the Vienna (Austria) Medal of Honor for Assistance to Austrian Youth, and the City of Paris Award (both in 1949). She was the first woman to receive the German Federal Republic's Commander's Cross of Merit (1954), and Shouse was named by Queen Elizabeth II, Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (1976).\n\nIn 1971, Shouse was named Honorary Park Superintendent by the National Park Service, United States Department of the Interior. She also received the Humanitarian Award from the National Recreation and Park Association in 1972 and the Conservation Service Award from the U.S. Department of the Interior in 1973.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2122568", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2122568", "title": "Seawind International Seawind", "text": "Seawind International Seawind\n\nThe Seawind is a family of composite, four-seat, amphibian airplanes that all feature a single tail-mounted engine, produced in kit forms and as fully built up aircraft in Canada and the United States.\n\nThe Seawind design originated in Canada, where the prototype, (C-GFNL), flew for the first time on 23 August 1982. Later development and production was carried out by Seawind International of Haliburton, Ontario, Canada, before the rights were acquired by SNA and production moved to Kimberton, Pennsylvania, United States. The major production versions of the Seawind line consist of the kit-built Seawind 2000 and Seawind 3000 United States and the Seawind 300C under development by Seawind LLC, also of Kimberton, Pennsylvania. The Seawind 3000 was introduced in 1993.\n\nThe Seawind 300C is intended to be the certified production version and is derived from the kit-built Seawind 3000. It incorporates many changes required to conform to the certification standards. The company indicated that certification flight testing would continue after the crash of the prototype on August 16, 2007, but did not actually resume until early 2010. Certification flight testing continued through the summer and autumn of 2011 with fixes introduced for problems with adverse yaw, lateral stability, ineffective rudder trim at low power settings, pitch damping, roll/yaw damping, high rotation forces on takeoff and the stall prevention system. As of mid-2014 certification was not yet complete.\n\nProduction of Seawind 3000 kits was suspended in 2002 to concentrate on certification of the 300C and the kits are no longer available.\n\nThe Seawind is most distinctive for its engine pod, which juts forward from the leading edge of the very large vertical fin. The design is also noted for its long, low profile and sleek curves made practical by composite construction.\n\nThe Seawind is relatively quiet for the crew, primarily because the engine is above and behind the cabin and the exhaust is routed up and aft. Some amphibian aircraft use a pusher propeller arrangement, which causes the exhaust to pass through the propeller plane which can increase noise. The Seawind uses a conventional tractor propeller arrangement that avoids this issue.\n\nThe cabin is very wide for an airplane of this type and seats 4 adults. A factory option replaces the aft executive bucket seats with seating for 3 children. The wide cabin also supports a large instrument panel, allowing installation of virtually any avionics.\n\nThere are three cargo compartments: under the nose deck ahead of the canopy, behind the rear seats in the cabin, and the tailcone.\n\nThe wing uses a constant-chord NASA NLF airfoil drooped at the ends. The wingtips provide some endplate effect to increase ground effect and reduce induced drag. They also serve as wingtip floats. The wing has a reflexed (negative angle of attack) trailing edge to reduce drag at cruise.\n\nThe Seawind 2000 and 3000's retractable landing gear is hinged to the side of the hull and folds up into the wing for flight and water operations. The certified landing gear is a trailing link-type, fully mounted in the wing.\n\nAn electric/hydraulic powerpack provides hydraulic power for the flaps, landing gear and nose-wheel steering. The hydraulic pack and battery are located in the nose compartment.\n\nFuel is gravity fed from the main tanks to a header tank to supply the engine. Optional long range tanks in the wing tips have electric pumps to transfer fuel to the main tanks. Fuel can also be pumped from side to side to correct any lateral imbalance.\n\nSteering on land is provided by differential braking. Hydraulic nose-wheel steering is available as an option. A retractable water rudder is slaved to the air rudder for water operation.\n\nThe Seawind was originally designed in the late seventies in Haliburton, Ontario. Seawind kits were developed and sold by SNA Inc. of Kimberton, Pennsylvania, United States. Seawind LLC was formed to certify the Seawind design as a complete aircraft and market it as the Seawind 300C. The Seawind 300C factory is located in Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Quebec, Canada.\n\nThe Seawind 2000 was the first kit prototype, powered by a Lycoming IO-360 engine. Although top and cruise speeds were respectable, SNA felt that the aircraft needed more power. A engine was installed, as well as several modifications, to create the Seawind 3000.\n\nIn addition to the larger engine, the Seawind 3000 had changes to the hull and step configuration. The Seawind 2000 canopy was hinged to allow opening from either side while the 3000 was hinged to open at the back.\n\nThe Seawind 3000 first flew in late March 1993. The first prototype crashed during testing on 3 April 1993 with test pilot Bob Mills and SNA president Dick Silva on board. After several routine tests, they attempted to simulate an engine-out situation reducing the engine power and setting the prop pitch to high. However, due to a malfunction, the propeller went into reverse pitch. This caused excessive drag and prevented the propeller from windmilling. The crew attempted to reach the runway but, due to the high descent rate and reverse thrust, they landed in rough terrain short of the runway at approximately , hitting several boulders on two sides of an embankment. The crash forces were estimated to be in excess of 20Gs. Although the aircraft suffered extensive damage, both crew suffered only muscle strains. The crash also showed the strength of the composite structure and, in particular, the vertical fin/engine pylon arrangement. Some skeptics had felt this was a potential weak point in the Seawind design, although the pylon is capable of 15G vertical and 20G forward loading, more than twice the certification requirement.\n\nThe prototype was rebuilt with a non-reversible constant speed propeller and testing resumed in December 1993.\n\nSNA estimated that it would take the average builder 2000 hours to complete a Seawind 3000 kit. A \"Kwick Kit\" option was also available, which provided some of the major components pre-assembled to reduce the build time to approximately 1600 hours.\n\nA standard kit was $59,900 USD in 1999. A Kwick Kit cost an extra $14,500 USD. SNA estimated that it would cost $40,000-65,000 USD for the necessary components not included with the kit. A fully assembled Seawind kit with instruments typically cost over $200,000 USD.\n\nThe first customer built Seawind 3000 was completed in mid-1994.\n\nThe Seawind 300C was developed from the 3000 and incorporated many changes needed to conform to the Canadian CAR 523 standards. Flight testing was commenced in Canada as the aircraft is intended to be manufactured at the plant at Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Quebec. Reciprocal certification in the USA under FAR 23 is intended to follow Canadian certification.\n\nThe 300C was undergoing certification testing when the prototype crashed near Winnipeg, Manitoba, on August 16, 2007 killing test pilot Glenn Ralph Holmes. At the time of the accident, the company indicated it would shut down, but in October 2007 stated that test flying would continue once additional personnel were hired and additional funding secured.\n\nIn July 2008 the company announced that was still pursuing certification and commencement of production, a task it stated would require US$4 million.\n\nIn September 2008 the company announced that it had raised $1.2 million but required $800,000 to recall employees to work. The company indicated that it had two Seawind prototypes available which could be used to complete the certification flight test program. Regarding the timeline to restart the flight testing and production, company president Dick Silva stated in September 2008, \"There is a limit to how long we can go without resuming the project. Time is our enemy.\"\n\nIn April 2009 Silva announced that the company had found sufficient funding to restart, would rehire staff and intended to have a replacement prototype ready to fly by the beginning of August 2009, with the aim of completing the certification of the 300C. The company also stated that investigation into the crash of the prototype ruled out in-flight failures or other problems with the aircraft.\n\nThe August 2009 date to recommence flight testing was not met and the aircraft was then forecast to start flight testing by contract National Research Council test pilots in February 2010, though this date was not met either. In early March 2010, Seawind announced the rollout of the test aircraft and the imminent start of taxi tests. The Seawind finally flew again later that month and was transferred to the NRC facility in Ottawa. Silva publicly announced that certification would be complete in June 2010 and that he was seeking funding for the stages beyond that, including production. By June 2010 the flight testing had just commenced with re-instrumentation and solving a landing gear door flutter issue. By the end of 2010 certification flight testing had identified two problem areas, loss of rudder effectiveness in power-off spins and lack of flap effectiveness. The former problem was to be addressed with stick shaker and stick pusher systems, labeled the \"Stall Prevention System\", and the latter with revised flap hinge geometry to achieve a more effective slot. Flight testing continued in the spring of 2011 with testing for flutter as well as damage tolerance and fatigue testing was completed. Testing of the Stall Prevention System and water handling followed.\n\nIn April 2011 the company announced that it had 50 Seawind 300C orders, that the final design configuration was frozen as a result of progress in the certification test flying and that the company only lacked funding to start building pre-production aircraft. The final design included a \"stall prevention system\" that will prevent the aircraft from stalling or spinning. By June 2011 the company still confirmed that they had 50 orders.\n\nCertification flight testing continued through the summer and autumn of 2011 with fixes for problems with adverse yaw, lateral stability, ineffective rudder trim at low power settings, pitch damping, roll/yaw damping, high rotation forces on takeoff and the stall prevention system. The aircraft had still not conducted water trials. Of the certification process the Flight Analyst Designated Airworthiness Representative, John Taylor, said \"It should be recognized that the Seawind has a very unconventional configuration and as a consequence, has at times been a very challenging configuration to make compliant with FAR Part 23 certification requirements.\"\n\nAfter a delay of a year to address issue the prototype Seawind was returned to Ottawa for further flight testing in August 2012.\n\nIn the fall of 2012 Silva wrote that the company had suffered years of set-backs because of their dealings with Canada Revenue Agency (CRA). The company had been moved from the United States because of financial incentives available in Canada that would make aircraft certification affordable. Delays in CRA processing resulted in the company running out of operating capital between 2007 and 2009. In the end CRA denied most of the tax refunds the company had applied for. Silva wrote \"This fiasco has put over a 1 million dollar hole in our budget, which was needed to complete certification. We were intent on raising at least the total of the $1,000,000 which we need to complete but which is being withheld by the CRA, who was doing everything possible to make us fail. We don’t know why and they won’t be honest with us.\" Silva continued, \"Once the CRA turned down our 2009 refund, common business sense says slow down and preserve capital until you are sure you will receive the money. Then when the CRA jerked us around for two more years and held up two refund applications, you know they are not your friend even though they repeatedly claim 'they are from the government and here to help us'. Every week for a year, they said they would give us an answer in two weeks only to ask for more papers and to repeat the cycle. MORAL OF THE STORY: Don’t trust them. Don’t believe their website. Don’t come to Canada if you have to depend on them.\"\n\nIn September 2013 the company announced that the stick shaker/pusher system test certification flying had been completed and all that remained for certification was performance documentation. The company also confirmed that it still retained 50 orders for the aircraft.\n\nBy the fall of 2014 the company announced that certification water testing was still incomplete, the company lacked funds to commence production and was seeking investors.\n\nFurther delays were caused by an accident during land test flying when the National Research Council test pilot crashed the prototype from during a simulated engine failure and recovery test on 24 October 2014. The prototype was repaired but the National Research Council lacked a pilot with sufficient seaplane experience to complete that phase of the certification. The company had to find and install a new data acquisition system and the first one installed did not work right and had to be replaced. The company hired Canadian astronaut Bjarni Tryggvason, who completed the test flying work. The company announced that flight testing had been completed on 18 November 2016 and that all that remained to finish certification was completing and submitting the paperwork to Transport Canada and raising the funds to commence production. The company stated that it still retained 43 orders for the aircraft.\n\nOn 9 January 2019 Richard Silva, the head of the company and driving forced behind the certification process died at age 82. The company indicated that efforts to certify the design would continue, but by early 2020 the company website claim that development would continue had been removed and the \"news\" section blanked.\n\nIn September 2007 there were 13 Seawind 2000 and 3000 amateur-builts registered in Canada and 58 in the USA. Due to kits purchased some time ago being completed, this number is expected to increase over the next few years, minus any aircraft destroyed in accidents.\n\n\n<br>\n<br>\n"}

{"id": "2122574", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2122574", "title": "Pang Tong Shrine and Tomb", "text": "Pang Tong Shrine and Tomb\n\nThe Pang Tong Shrine and Tomb, also known as the Dragon and Phoenix Shrine and the Valley of the Fallen Phoenix, is a shrine and tomb located in Baimaguan Town (白馬關鎮), Luojiang County, Deyang City, Sichuan Province, China. The shrine and tomb was constructed for Pang Tong (179–214), an adviser to Liu Bei, the founding emperor of the state of Shu Han in the Three Kingdoms period. On 25 May 2006, the shrine and tomb became part of the sixth batch of Major Historical and Cultural Sites Protected at the National Level.\n\nPang Tong was from Xiangyang Commandery (襄陽郡; present-day Xiangyang, Hubei). He initially served as a minor official in Nan Commandery (南郡; around present-day Jingzhou, Hubei) before becoming an adviser to the warlord Liu Bei in 209. In the early 210s, he accompanied Liu Bei on a campaign to seize control of Yi Province (covering present-day Sichuan and Chongqing) from the warlord Liu Zhang. He was killed by a stray arrow in a battle at Luo County (雒縣; north of present-day Guanghan, Sichuan) in 214.\n\nPang Tong's death is dramatised in the 14th-century historical novel \"Romance of the Three Kingdoms\". In the novel, Zhang Ren, a military officer serving under Liu Zhang, sets up an ambush outside Luo County. Liu Bei offers his horse, Dilu, to Pang Tong out of kindness before the battle. Pang Tong leads a group of soldiers to attack Luo County and passes through the ambush area. Zhang Ren recognises Dilu and mistakes its rider for Liu Bei, so he orders his archers to fire arrows at the rider. Pang Tong is hit by several arrows and dies on the spot. His place of death is called \"Valley of the Fallen Phoenix\".\n\nThe tomb and shrine was constructed by Liu Bei in 214 after Pang Tong's death. It is also called \"Baima Temple\" (白馬寺; literally \"White Horse Temple\") because it is located in Baimaguan Town (白馬關鎮; literally \"White Horse Gate Town\"). It is also known as \"Dragon and Phoenix Shrine\" because there are statues of Pang Tong and Zhuge Liang inside. Pang Tong and Zhuge Liang were nicknamed \"Young Phoenix\" and \"Sleeping Dragon\" respectively and they served as Liu Bei's advisers.\n\nThe shrine and tomb was damaged over time but was restored in 1691 during the reign of the Kangxi Emperor in the Qing dynasty. As of today, the shrine has a large gate, a main hall, two side halls and a pavilion, with the tomb situated beside it. There are two large cupressaceae trees inside the shrine which are said to have been planted by Zhang Fei, a general serving under Liu Bei. A couplet pasted on the doors reads, \"Even though it was obvious that the Late Emperor (Liu Bei) favoured the Fallen Phoenix (Pang Tong), the Sleeping Dragon (Zhuge Liang) was still given the opportunity to be the long-serving minister.\" Pang Tong's biography, written by Chen Shou in the third century, is carved on a stone wall behind the main hall.\n\nOn 25 May 2006, the shrine and tomb became part of the sixth batch of Major Historical and Cultural Sites Protected at the National Level.\n\n"}
{"id": "2122578", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2122578", "title": "Too Much Joy", "text": "Too Much Joy\n\nToo Much Joy is an American alternative rock music group. The band formed in the early 1980s in Scarsdale, New York.\n\nThe original members were Tim Quirk (vocals), Jay Blumenfield (guitar, vocals), Sandy Smallens (bass, vocals) and Tommy Vinton (drums). During 1982-1983 Tommy LaRussa temporarily replaced Vinton as drummer. Smallens departed on amicable terms in 1994; producer William Wittman joined on bass guitar and vocals after Smallens's departure. Blumenfield was also in Fields Laughing (who released an EP in 1985 on Stonegarden Records) and Smallens was also in Beauty Constant (whose \"Like The Enemy\" LP was issued in 1987), Wittman continues to play with Cyndi Lauper.\n\nThe band, originally called The Rave, took the name Too Much Joy after a phrase Quirk found written down after his first mushroom trip.[]\nAfter the success of their third album \"Cereal Killers\", TMJ released several other studio albums, but none achieved the same popular success. In 1997, TMJ announced a hiatus, saying that the commercialism of the music business had taken the \"joy\" out of performing. Too Much Joy emptied its vaults in 1999 and 2001 to produce the album \"Gods and Sods,\" composed of studio outtakes and demos from the period between \"Mutiny\" and \"...Finally\" and the live album, \"Live at Least\". The later incarnation of the band briefly reunited in the early 2000s to record the one-off holiday single, \"Ruby Left a Present Underneath the Christmas Tree.\" Although TMJ remains inactive, if not technically defunct, its members have since formed the sometimes overlapping subprojects The ITS, Surface Wound, and Wonderlick.\nTMJ found themselves with celebrity fans Penn and Teller, to the point where Teller directed the video for \"Donna Everywhere\". Penn liked the guys in the band so much that he took the opportunity to jam with them in the studio when the opportunity presented itself.\n\nWhile never officially broken up, the entire band performed for the first time in 10 years on May 4, 2007 at the Knitting Factory in New York City. The opening band, The Final Stand, included Tommy Vinton's son Tommy on drums and Sandy Smallens' son Ziya on bass, followed by New Jersey's The Impulse. Both TMJ bassists, Sandy Smallens and William Wittman, took part in the performance, trading between second guitar and bass. The concert was a celebration of drummer Tommy Vinton's retirement from the NYPD.\n\nThe band later recorded \"We Are The Clash\" for \"Recutting the Crap, Volume One,\" an album paying tribute to The Clash released by Crooked Beat Records in Alexandria, Virginia.\n\nTMJ were sued by Bozo the Clown for including a sample taken from a Bozo the Clown album in the intro to the song \"Clowns\" on the independent release of \"Son of Sam I Am\". The five-second sample (\"I found something in one of my pockets. It was about as big as your shoe, but it was shaped like a rocket!\") was pulled from the track when the album was re-released by Warner Bros. Records.\n\nIn 1990, the members of Too Much Joy were taken aback to learn that hip-hop group 2 Live Crew had been arrested on obscenity charges in Florida, and that a record store owner had been arrested for selling their music. In response, the band planned a protest concert in which several acts would cover a 2 Live Crew song in Miami. Failing to drum up much commitment among other bands, Too Much Joy themselves played a number of selections from the Crew's \"As Nasty As They Wanna Be\" album, and wound up spending a night in jail. Tim Quirk recalled the incident in an interview with \"The A.V. Club\". \n\nLead singer Quirk was detained by the Secret Service after a performance where he made a joke about strangling President Clinton. Although the band believed that President Clinton's daughter, Chelsea Clinton, was in the audience at the time, reality was that the Secret Service contingent was there to 'protect' an obscure foreign ambassador.\nIt being a longstanding Too Much Joy tradition to tell an obvious lie in the break section of their version of the L.L. Cool J song, \"That's A Lie\", Quirk explained at some length that the band was well aware of the presence of agents with coily cords in their ears and that the Secret Service was \"not famous for their sense of humor\". So it was explained further that the song was called \"That's A Lie\" and that the band is known to tell a lie at this point in the song at which point \"my friends will jump in and sing 'that's a lie'... so If I were to, for example, say that I voted for President Clinton but when I see him eviscerating the Bill of Rights it makes me want to strangle him, you'll understand that I don't mean it because...\" and then the band came in singing \"that's a lie\". This would have been the end of the story but apparently the Secret Service felt obligated to take it as a serious \"threat\". Two hours later, at the end of the show, they detained the band and questioned Quirk until they were satisfied that the band was not in fact on a mission to assassinate Clinton. Apparently they never heard, over the noise of the crowd, that Tim had announced the next song (\"I Want To Poison Your Mind\") as \"I Want To Poison The President.\"\n\nTMJ was compared to musical contemporaries They Might Be Giants and Barenaked Ladies because of its unconventional style, grassroots fan appeal, and quirky yet honest and insightful lyrics like: \n\nWe sleep on floors and live on crumbs,<BR>\nWe're a bunch of ugly bums.<BR>\nA great idea when we were smashed...<BR>\nTurning anger into cash.<BR>\nWe ain't seen much, but we don't starve<BR>\nWe drive around in our moms' cars<BR>\nTo create, you must destroy.<BR>\nSmash a glass and cry... Too Much Joy<BR>\n\"Theme Song\", (Cereal Killers, 1991)\nThe band's first LP, entitled \"Green Eggs and Crack\" was released in 1987 on the small Stonegarden label; it collected material the band had recorded during the previous four years during college breaks, as well as during their senior year of high school for Quirk, Blumenfield and Smallens and freshman year for LaRussa. LaRussa appears as drummer for \"James Dean's Jacket\" and \"Don Quixote.\" All other tracks have Vinton on drums. Allmusic describes the album's songs as \"often extremely clever and catchy,\" although \"clearly the work of over-educated, under-employed, upper-middle class kids with far too much time on their hands\". [] When the album was re-released in 2002, \"The Onion\" called it \"a thinly produced, underwhelming record recorded by teenagers, and charming mostly for reasons revolving around sentiment and potential\", while the band's Quirk described the long out-of-print record as the perfect legend: \"a cool title that people could talk about and search for without any real chance of ever actually hearing it\". But college radio's attraction to quirky songs like \"Drum Machine\" paved the way for a wider reception for the band's subsequent recordings.\n\nThe band's next release, on the independent Alias label, was \"Son of Sam I Am\" in 1989. This album was rereleased by Giant/Warner Brothers in 1990 with two extra tracks: \"If I Was a Mekon\" and \"Seasons in the Sun\" and minus the introduction to Clowns (see above).\n\nThis album features the crowd favorite L.L. Cool J cover \"That's A Lie\" and was always performed with \"The Big Lie\", which was a lie composed for the show or tour that seemed reasonably plausible (throwing keys into the audience for the after party at the Holiday Inn for example).\n\nToo Much Joy's 1991 LP \"Cereal Killers\", released by Warner Bros. Records, met with some popularity on college radio and alternative radio stations rotations all over the U.S., with the song \"Good Kill\" featuring the rising hip-hop star KRS-One. The single \"Crush Story\" made it to No. 17 on the U.S. Modern Rock chart in 1991. This album features the epicenter of the \"Joy\" universe by offering \"Theme Song\" which is sung drunkenly at the end of Too Much Joy shows by band and fans alike.\n\nAmerican music essayist Robert Christgau gave the album an A- and wrote, \"After a year of sleeping on floors, stealing wives, and expressing solidarity with 2 Live Crew, their music is thicker, tougher, hookier, sometimes even a tad overproduced. And their lyrics are still what it's there for. So smart they have dumb people sniffing about the Dead Milkmen, they have their moments of empathy, social responsibility, self-knowledge, and so forth.

It is located on Central Avenue some east of Downtown. At , the 17-story tower was the tallest building in New Mexico when completed in 1963. It is now the fifth tallest building in the state, and the tallest outside of Downtown Albuquerque. The building was developed by the Del Webb Corporation and designed by the architectural firm of Flatow, Moore, Bryan, and Fairburn. For most of its history the tower housed a succession of bank branches.\n\nThe tower was built by the Del Webb Corporation and originally housed the East Central branch of the First National Bank of New Mexico. The original name of the building was First National Bank Building East to avoid confusion with the bank's main building downtown. Groundbreaking ceremonies took place on July 12, 1961, and the bank was officially opened for business on February 16, 1963. During construction, the builders reportedly attached numbers to the side of the building to prevent drivers from being distracted by trying to count the number of floors.\n\nWhen completed, the tower surpassed the New Mexico Bank & Trust Building to become the tallest in New Mexico. Its construction, far from the existing highrises downtown, reflected an ongoing shift of people and capital from Albuquerque's decaying city center to the more suburban Northeast Heights. The building was intended to become the focal point of a new urban development called First National Bank Center, though ultimately only one other tower was built, an adjacent 10-story office building that once housed the headquarters of Microsoft. With urban renewal efforts underway downtown, the new highrise lost its title as the city's tallest building to the National Building just three years after opening, though it remains the tallest building in the city outside of Downtown.\n\nThe First National Bank branch originally occupied the first two floors of the building, while the basement housed the vaults and lock boxes, an event room, and a cafe. The top two floors were reserved for the members-only Albuquerque City Club. The club facilities included a bar, dining room, beauty salon, and saunas on the 16th floor, and a gymnasium and rooftop deck \"for dancing, sunbathing and other outside activities\" on the 17th floor. The club went out of business after only two years and its space was eventually converted into two residential penthouses, which remained in place as of 2015 along with a rooftop racquetball court.\n\nFirst National Bank was purchased by First Security Bank in 1993, and the building's name and signage changed accordingly. The tower was renamed again in 2001 when Bank of the West bought the branch. Bank of the West vacated the building in 2012. It is used by various State departments.\n\nThe Bank of the West Tower was designed by the Albuquerque firm of Flatow, Moore, Bryan, and Fairburn, which was also responsible for the nearly identical Del Webb Building in Phoenix (later extensively remodeled). The building has 17 above-ground floors and a basement level, giving a total of of floor space. The frame was constructed from poured-in-place reinforced concrete and employed post-tensioned girders to distribute the weight of each floor to the tower's exterior columns and central core, allowing for a column-free interior. The post-tensioning system also reduced the overall height of each story, allowing the developers to add an extra floor without changing the planned height.\n\nThe building's ground floor features pillars faced with gray Italian marble framing 28 large plate glass windows. The lobby and banking hall were originally finished in gray and cream-colored marble with walnut and aluminum trim, while \"a dark green Grecian marbleized vinyl covering\" was used on the upper floors. The elevator lobbies were decorated with fifteen murals by Alice Garver depicting various aspects of New Mexico history, including indigenous peoples (second floor), covered wagons (10th floor), the Atomic Age (16th floor), and the Duke of Alburquerque (17th floor). Like much of Garver's work, the murals were fragile and have not survived.\n\nOn the exterior, white paint and tinted glass were used to reduce the building's cooling load. Each spandrel is faced with gold ceramic tile, which architect Max Flatow described as containing actual 23-karat gold, saying \"We would be a richer society if we used our precious things on buildings instead of burying them in the ground.\" Approximately 2.5 million of the one inch square tiles were required to cover the building. The exterior of the tower is also decorated with gold-colored aluminum screens on the eleventh floor.\n\nThe top of the building originally featured the text \"FIRST NATIONAL BANK\" in illuminated green letters on all four sides. This was replaced in 1993 with \"FIRST SECURITY BANK\" in red lettering, and then in 2001 with the Bank of the West logo. As of 2012 the building no longer features any exterior signage.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2122581", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2122581", "title": "Attwenger", "text": "Attwenger\n\nAttwenger (formed 1990) is a musical duo from Linz, Austria. The group is made up of drummer Markus Binder and button accordion player Hans-Peter Falkner; both members also sing.\n\nAttwenger's music is an unusual combination of Upper Austrian folk music and hip-hop, with lyrics sung (and rapped) in Upper Austrian dialect. Falkner often plays his accordion through effects pedals to give his instrument a distorted timbre similar to that of an electric guitar. Binder sometimes uses drum machines.\n\nThe duo has toured Europe, Zimbabwe (1993), Siberia, Pakistan, Vietnam, and Malaysia (1995). In 2003 they won an Amadeus Austrian Music Award, in the category \"FM4 Alternative Act des Jahres\" (alternative act of the year). Of the group, the noted BBC DJ John Peel (1939-2004) said, \"I have no idea what it's all about, but I like the general noise a great deal.\"\n\nAttwenger worked together with Fred Frith, the Boban Marković Orkestar, and Austrian hip-hop group Texta.\n\nThe lyrics contain several word plays, most of them are impossible or hard to translate or explain to Non-Austrians (some even to Non-Upper Austrians)\nSome of the word plays are English related, especially in the album titles:\n\n\"song\" is, aside from its English meaning the Austrian dialect word for \"to say\".\n\n\"sun\" (spoken: soon) is Austrian dialect for \"Sonne\", which in English again, means \"sun\".\n\n\"dog\" in Austrian dialect means \"day\", and the German word for \"dog\" is \"Hund\". The song on the album contains the line \"da dog der is a hund\" - \"the day is a dog\". This has no meaning in English, but in Austria the saying that \"something \"is a Hund\"\" relates to something being difficult, or not working out as expected.\n\nAn example for a word play that can be translated into English, also characterizing the general message transmitted by Attwenger, can be found on \"dog\": \"A jeder mensch zöd, a jeder mensch zöd sei göd\" - \"Every man counts, every man counts his money\".\n\nAnother one is part of the song \"Gedscho\" on \"sun\", where the line \"geht scho (wieder)\" (\"It's ok, I can still make it.\") evolves into \"geht scho wieder weida\" (\"Look, it continues\").\n\nThe overall style changed continuously during their works, their first 2 albums, \"most\" and \"pflug\" were basically cover versions of traditional upper Austrian folk songs, played in punk style, with only slightly changed or adapted lyrics, spoken as rap.\n\n\"luft\" (Air) was the first step away from tradition, as for the first time they wrote their own lyrics, in the sense of Austrian poet Ernst Jandl, some of the songs dealing with environmental and social issues. In the music the amount of distortion and feedback became painfully dominant, making \"luft\" maybe the most challenging album to listen to.\n\n\"song\" was the next step in the development of Attwenger. Totally free of the noisiness and punky elements, the album contains three songs clocking in at around 15 minutes, which can be best compared to ethno or dub music, and a six-second word rap titled \"Es gibt Wiederholungen\" (\"There are repeats\"). For the first time plenty of electronic samples were used, and the lyrics were used rather as instrument than as carrier of message. The lyrics for each song consist only two or three sentences, whose words are only slightly varied (thus getting a different meaning), and repeated like mantras, sounding very similar to the accompanying mouth harp.\n\n\"sun\" and \"dog\" represent another change of style, on one hand, the band returns to shorter songs, more aggressively addressing political and social criticism in their lyrics. The punkish style of the early days has returned to a small extent, but also hip-hop and trip-hop-elements have found their way into the music. The two albums also show increasing amount of melody, with some of the songs actually sung, rather than spoken.\n\n\n\n"}

Western Australia. It is operated by Transperth and is connected with the feeder bus services that utilise the adjacent bus terminal in Midland.\n\nMidland station was opened on 8 October 1968 by Minister for Transport & Railways Ray O'Connor as a replacement for Midland Junction station when the main Eastern Railway was being converted to dual gauge.\n\nIt originally had four narrow gauge platform faces, three terminating and one through. A separate platform was provided for the standard gauge line 150 metres away. One of the terminating lines was lifted in the 1990s and in February 2001, the through line converted to dual gauge allowing \"The Prospector\" to call at the main station.\n\nIn the 2010s the Midland Redevelopment Authority (MRA) had advocated the relocation of the station east to be in line with Cale Street, the site of the original Midland Junction station. The MRA also desired an extension of the Midland line to Bellevue, which would take on a primarily park and ride function, to allow for land around Midland station to be redeveloped. There have been previous attempts to extend the line to Bellevue.\n\nIn 2018 Western Australia's Metronet project announced that the Government would receive a Project Definition Plan in late 2018 with the project's proposed details to enable an investment decision. In January 2020 it was announced that the current train station will be demolished and replaced with a new station located between Helena and Cale Streets. The relocation of the station was required to accommodate the extension to Bellevue, where a new railcar manufacturing facility will also be built. The new station is expected to be completed in late 2022 or mid-2023.\n\nThe station has a single through standard gauge side platform served by Transwa's \"AvonLink, MerredinLink\" and \"Prospector\" services, and Great Southern Rail's \"Indian Pacific\" and two narrow gauge bay platforms used by Transperth Midland line services.\n"}

It was released on May 2, 1987 by Arista Records. It was produced by Narada Michael Walden, and written by George Merrill and Shannon Rubicam, of the band Boy Meets Girl, who had previously written the number-one Whitney Houston hit \"How Will I Know.\"\n\nThe song received mixed reviews from critics, who praised her vocal but critiqued musical arrangement comparing it to her own \"How Will I Know\" and Cyndi Lauper's \"Girls Just Want to Have Fun.\" The song won the Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance at the 30th Grammy Awards. The single was a commercial success, topping the charts in 13 countries including Australia, Italy, Germany and the UK. In the US, it became her fourth consecutive number one single and sold over one million copies, making it her first platinum single in the US; and her biggest hit in that country at the time. It was eventually surpassed by her version of \"I Will Always Love You\", five years later in 1992.\n\n\"I Wanna Dance with Somebody\" was written by George Merrill and Shannon Rubicam, who wrote Houston's 1985 song \"How Will I Know, which became successful, and as a result, they were asked to come up with another song for Houston's then-new album. Originally the song that gave Merrill and Rubicam their British top ten success as Boy Meets Girl, \"Waiting For a Star to Fall\" was intended by the duo to be a song for Houston. The duo sent it to Arista Records, but they passed on it citing it was not suitable for Houston. Undeterred by this minor setback, the pair continued working on finding a song that would be ideal for Houston and was inspired to come up with \"I Wanna Dance with Somebody.\" Later on, Rubicam explained the idea behind the song:\nBut, the song did not impress the producer Narada Michael Walden, who had produced \"How Will I Know.\" He took a little more persuading with regard to the song's potential, and at first was not too keen on having Houston record it, as he felt it was too \"country and western sounding.\" He said of it,\n\nFor the song's production, a Roland TR-808 was used to produce the drum machine percussion.\n\n\"I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)\" received mixed reviews from critics. Vince Aletti of \"Rolling Stone\" magazine, in a review of the album \"Whitney\", criticized the song, commenting that \"not taking any chances, the songwriters [Merill Griffith and Shannon Rubicam] have simply come up with a clever anagram of their original hit [How Will I Know], and [Narada Michael] Walden has glossed it over in an identically perky style. The strategy is not so different from that behind Hollywood's blockbuster sequels: this is 'How Will I Know II'.\" \"Los Angeles Times\"'s pop music critic, Robert Hilburn described the song as \"a deliciously raucous tune with a bit of the synthesizer underpinning and giddy zest of Cyndi Lauper's 'Girls Just Want to Have Fun.'\"\n\nIn his review of \"Whitney\", Jon Pareles of \"The New York Times\" gave a negative comment, writing that listening to \"I Wanna Dance with Somebody\" and \"You're Still My Man,\" another track on the album was like \"watching television while someone fiddles with color controls.\" In 2006, \"Slant Magazine\" ranked the song at #88 in their 100 Greatest Dance Songs, commenting that \"with its parenthetical title, gummy bassline, schmaltzy horns, tinkling keyboards, and half-step key changes, [the song] is definitive '80s dance-pop.\" However, the song begins in G-flat major and changes key by a whole step, not a half-step, to A-flat major just after the final bridge.\n\n\"I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)\" won the award for \"Favorite Pop/Rock Single\" at the 15th American Music Awards on January 25, 1988. Additionally, Houston won the Grammy award for \"Best Pop Vocal Performance, Female\" with the song at its 30th ceremony on March 2, 1988, where she received a total of three nominations. The music video for the song was nominated for \"Best Music Video\" at the 2nd Soul Train Music Awards on March 30, 1988.

It entered the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, the issue dated May 16, 1987, at number 38, her highest debut in the 1980s. Six weeks later, it reached the top spot of the chart, making it Houston's fourth number-one single in the United States, the issue date of June 27, 1987 ― the same day that Houston's album \"Whitney\" debuted at number one on the \"Billboard\" 200 (formerly \"Top Pop Albums\") the first time ever by a female artist.

The song reached number one on the Hot 100 Single Sales chart for two weeks, and on the Hot 100 Airplay chart for three weeks, her longest run at that time. The single also peaked at number one on the Hot Adult Contemporary and the remixed dance / club version by Steve Thompson and Michael Barbiero became Houston's first chart-topper on the \"Billboard\" Hot Dance/Club Play Songs, staying on the top position of the charts for three weeks and two weeks, respectively. In addition, it reached a peak of two on the \"Billboard\" Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart (formerly \"Hot Black Singles\"), the issue date of July 4, 1987.

(The number of sales required to qualify for gold and platinum discs was higher prior to January 1, 1989. The thresholds were 1,000,000 units (gold) and 2,000,000 units (platinum), reflecting a decrease in sales of singles.

It was ranked second on the \"RPM\" Year-End Top 100 Singles chart for 1987. The single was later certified Gold by the Canadian Recording Industry Association (CRIA) on February 29, 1988.\n\nInternationally, the song was a massive hit, becoming her most successful single at the time. It reached number one in fourteen countries. The song debuted at number 10 on the UK Singles Chart, the week ending date of May 23, 1987. Two weeks later, it reached number one on the chart, the week ending June 6, 1987, becoming her second UK number-one single. The single was certified Gold by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) on August 1, 1987, for shipments of 400,000 copies. According to The Official Charts Company, it has sold 760,000 copies in the United Kingdom. The single also topped the singles chart in Belgium for three weeks, the Netherlands for four weeks, Germany for five weeks, Italy for a week, Norway for seven weeks, Sweden for six weeks and Switzerland for six weeks, and peaked inside top five in Austria and Ireland. This popularity of the single across Europe led to the song topping the European Hot 100 Singles chart for eight weeks. It became Houston's second number-one single on the Australian \"Kent Music Report\" chart, staying at the top for five weeks. The song also peaked at number one on the New Zealand Singles Chart and remained there for four weeks, making it Houston's first number-one single in the country.\n\n\"I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)\" the single sold 4.2 million copies worldwide. After her death, the single returned to the Billboard Hot 100 debuting at number 35 the same week \"I Will Always Love You\" re-entered at number 7, giving Houston two posthumous Top 40 hits.\n\nThe video for \"I Wanna Dance with Somebody\" was directed by Brian Grant and choreographed by Arlene Phillips, who also worked with Houston on the music video for \"How Will I Know\". The video features Houston in a pink dress and a continuous shot of a purple backdrop that never changes its angle of vision. In the intro of this video, Houston just finishes a performance onstage. She walks backstage, and the scene is intercut with more vivid, colorful images of her. The song then explodes into its beginning, with myriad locations and various outfits by Houston, as dancers trying to impress her as she dances. Towards the end of the song she manhandles a guy, who has a mixture of a look of shock and surprise asking him \"Don't you wanna dance say you wanna dance\". It has over 150 million views as of July, 2019 on YouTube.\n\nHouston performed the song on almost all of her world and regional tours.\nShe premiered the song during the later shows of The Greatest Love World Tour in 1986, before its official release of the next year, introducing the song along with \"Didn't We Almost Have It All\" as new tunes from her upcoming album. During her European promotion for a new album in April–May 1987, Houston performed the song on various TV shows such as (Italian TV entertainment programme), Montreux Golden Rose Rock Festival: IM&MC Gala (May 15, 1987), and Top of the Pops (May 21, 1987), where she sang live, unlike some other performers who lip-synced on the programme.\n\nMoment of Truth World Tour in 1987-1988 had Houston performing it as the finale song of the tour. She performed the song without back-up dancers on the North American leg (1987), and with four dancers on the European leg of the tour (1988). Two different performances of the song were taped in Saratoga Springs, New York on September 2, 1987 and at Wembley Arena in London, United Kingdom in May 1988.

On the tour, five different performances of the song were taped and televised; four was on the South American leg of the tour in 1994―Brazil, Chile, Argentina and Venezuela―and one was in Johannesburg, South Africa, broadcast live via satellite on HBO, November 12, 1994; the concert titled \".\" Houston performed the song at a 25-minute pregame show of the 1994 FIFA World Cup Final at Rose Bowl in Los Angeles, broadcast in more than 180 countries on July 17, 1994.\n\n\"I Wanna Dance with Somebody\" was included in the setlist on two regional tours, The Pacific Rim Tour (1997) and The European Tour (1998). During the 1999 My Love Is Your Love World Tour, the remix version of the song was performed as a part of \"1980s Dance Medley\" along with \"How Will I Know.\" One performance of the song on the tour was taped in Sopot, Poland and broadcast live on Polish TV channel TVP1 on August 22, 1999. In 2000, she performed the song as a similar version of '99 tour's on Arista Records 25th Anniversary Celebration, taped at Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles on April 10, and broadcast on May 15 on NBC.\n\nThe song was used in the 2018 American romantic teen comedy-drama film Love, Simon and was also included on the film's soundtrack.

Afterwards, KSOL segued into a 72-hour loop of \"Wild Thing\" by Tone Lōc.\n\nOn February 13, 1992, at 3 p.m., 107.7 FM flipped to Rhythmic Contemporary, branded as \"WiLD 107.\" The first song on \"WiLD\" was \"D.M.S.R\" by Prince. For the first year and a half, the station retained the old KSOL call letters.\n\nAllen Shaw's Crescent Communications bought the station in December 1993 for $13.5 million. KSOL's call letters were changed to KYLD the following year. The company also purchased 99.1 in San Jose from Viacom, and began simulcasting KYLD's programming in the South Bay, in order to help fill 107.7's signal limitations. Program Director Rick Thomas and Music Director Michael Martin set a plan in motion to overtake KMEL; they came up with a strategy of playing \"old school\" and up tempo freestyle/dance songs like those heard on heritage San Jose radio station HOT 97.7. KMEL moved from rhythmic to urban contemporary at the same time, and the two stations battled with each other throughout the mid-1990s.\n\nAt 12:01 a.m. on July 2, 1997, KYLD moved to 94.9 FM. 107.7 and 94.9 would simulcast until Midnight on July 7, when 107.7 FM, now with the KSAN call letters, began stunting with construction noises and song clips as a prelude to a flip to classic rock at Noon on July 11.\n\nOn March 13, 2000, at 3 p.m., after playing \"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road\" by Elton John, the station relaunched as \"The Bone,\" playing classic rock with a harder edge. To initiate this change, the station played AC/DC \"A to Z,\" all 154 songs the band had recorded at that point, aired in alphabetical order.\n\nWith the demise of rival rock station KSJO in 2004, the station adopted a mainstream rock format. The playlist shifted back toward classic rock in April 2017. Bands in KSAN's playlist include classic rock acts such as The Rolling Stones, Pink Floyd, The Who, and Led Zeppelin, plus Southern rock such as Lynyrd Skynyrd and The Eagles, as well as alternative rock, punk rock, and grunge like Alice in Chains, Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Stone Temple Pilots, The Offspring and Green Day. In addition, the station also included hard rock and heavy metal music such as Rush, Van Halen, Metallica, Black Sabbath, and AC/DC. The weekday on-air staff at The Bone consisted of morning team Lamont & Tonelli, as well as Chasta, steve Seaweed and Zakk.\n\nIn early 2016, Steven Seaweed's \"All Request Hot Lunch\" was cancelled by the program director. In August, Lejf Jaeger left the Bone. He had been part-time weekends for ten years. With his departure, \"Local Licks\" was also removed from the programming. In April 2017, several classic rock artists were added to the playlist including The Beatles, Cream, and John Mellencamp.\n\nSteven Seaweed retired on July 1, 2017 after 44 years of being a Bay Area DJ, the last 20 of which had been with KSAN.\n\nThroughout the NFL season, the station broadcasts San Francisco 49ers games. While co-owned KNBR and KTCT are the primary flagship stations for the team, KSAN also airs the games.\n\nKSAN (FM) is rebroadcast on the following FM Booster:\n\nKSAN broadcasts in the HD Radio format with the following stations:\n\nFrom 2016 to 2018, the HD2 channel carried the Nash FM country music network.\n\n"}

{"id": "2122628", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2122628", "title": "Herrera v. Collins", "text": "Herrera v. Collins\n\nHerrera v. Collins, 506 U.S. 390 (1993), was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States ruled by 6 votes to 3 that a claim of actual innocence does not entitle a petitioner to federal \"habeas corpus\" relief by way of the Eighth Amendment's ban on cruel and unusual punishment.\n\nOn September 29, 1981, Texas Department of Public Safety Officer David Rucker was shot and killed along a stretch of highway a few miles north of Brownsville, Texas in the Rio Grande Valley. Rucker's body, discovered by a passer-by, was lying beside his patrol car. He had been shot in the head. Around the same time, Los Fresnos Police Officer Enrique Carrisalez observed a speeding vehicle traveling on the same road away from where Rucker's body had been found. Carrisalez and his partner turned on the patrol car's flashing red lights and pursued the vehicle, which pulled over. Carrisalez took a flashlight and walked toward the car. The driver of the vehicle opened his door and exchanged words with Carrisalez before firing at least one shot at Carrisalez' chest. He died nine days later. Leonel Torres Herrera was arrested a few days later and was charged with the capital murder of both Carrisalez and Rucker. \n\nBefore he died, Carrisalez also identified Herrera as the person who shot him from a single photograph shown to him in the hospital (not a photo array). The license plate of the vehicle from which the gunman emerged was traced back to Herrera's live-in girlfriend, a car that local law officers knew Herrera drove on occasion. Carrisalez' partner testified that only one person was in the car when Carrisalez was shot.\n\nOther evidence showed that Herrera's Social Security card had been found alongside Rucker's patrol car on the night he was killed. Splatters of blood on the car identified by Carrisalez' partner as the vehicle involved in the shootings were found to be type A blood, the same as Rucker's. Blood on Herrera's pants and wallet was likewise discovered to be type A. Last, a handwritten letter was found on Herrera when he was arrested which \"strongly implied\" that he had killed Rucker.\n\nIn January 1982, Herrera was tried for the murder of Carrisalez. At the trial, Carrisalez' partner identified Herrera as the person who shot Carrisalez. The jury found Herrera guilty of the capital murder of Carrisalez, for which he was sentenced to death. Later that year, Herrera pleaded guilty to the murder of Rucker.\n\nHerrera filed a petition for writ of \"habeas corpus\" in federal court, claiming that new evidence demonstrated he was actually innocent of the murder of Carrisalez. Herrera included two affidavits with his petition from Hector Villarreal, an attorney who had represented Herrera's brother, Raul Herrera, Sr., and Juan Franco Palacious, Raul Herrera's former cellmate. Both affidavits claimed that Raul Herrera, who was murdered in 1984, had told them that he had killed Rucker and Carrisalez. Leonel Herrera claimed that the new evidence showed that he was actually innocent, and that executing an innocent person would constitute cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment.\n\nTwo questions were presented for the Supreme Court's review:\n\n\nChief Justice William Rehnquist’s majority opinion held that a claim of actual innocence based on newly discovered evidence did not state a ground for federal \"habeas\" relief. Herrera had claimed that, because the new evidence demonstrated innocence, his execution would violate the Eighth Amendment’s ban on cruel and unusual punishment which applied to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment. Rehnquist’s opinion noted that “[f]ew rulings would be more disruptive of our federal system than to provide for federal \"habeas\" review of freestanding claims of actual innocence.” Rehnquist’s opinion, although not explicitly holding that the Eighth Amendment does not prohibit executing an innocent person, emphasized that Herrera was not raising a constitutional violation. In discussing what relief Herrera would be entitled to were he to succeed on his claim of “actual innocence,” Rehnquist wrote:\n\nWere petitioner to satisfy the dissent's ‘probable innocence’ standard…the District Court would presumably be required to grant a conditional order of relief, which would in effect require the State to retry petitioner 10 years after his first trial, not because of any constitutional violation which had occurred at the first trial, but simply because of a belief that in light of petitioner's new-found evidence a jury might find him not guilty at a second trial.\n\nRehnquist’s opinion also held that Texas courts’ refusal to even consider Herrera’s newly discovered evidence did not violate due process and suggested that Herrera file a clemency petition with the Texas Board of Pardon and Paroles.\n\nJustice O'Connor wrote a concurring opinion. Although she joined the majority opinion, in her concurring opinion, O'Connor wrote that \"the execution of a legally and factually innocent person would be a constitutionally intolerable event.\" Dispositive for Justice O'Connor, however, was that \"[Herrera was] not innocent in any sense of the word.\" O'Connor took the position that Herrera could not be \"legally and factually innocent\" because he \"was tried before a jury of his peers, with the full panoply of protections that our Constitution affords criminal defendants. At the conclusion of that trial, the jury found [Herrera] guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\" O'Connor reiterated the majority's conclusion that the execution of an innocent person was not unconstitutional by assuming that there was no constitutional issue raised:\n\nConsequently, the issue before us is not whether a State can execute the innocent. It is, as the Court notes, whether a fairly convicted and therefore legally guilty person is constitutionally entitled to yet another judicial proceeding in which to adjudicate his guilt anew, 10 years after conviction, notwithstanding his failure to demonstrate that constitutional error infected his trial.\n\nO'Connor concluded by asserting that the majority did not hold that the Constitution permits the execution of an actually innocent person.\n\nAntonin Scalia joined the majority, but added in passing that he found no basis, either in the Constitution or in case law, to conclude that executing an innocent but duly convicted defendant would violate the Eighth Amendment. He sharply criticized the dissenting justices' appeal to conscience:\n\nIf the system that has been in place for 200 years (and remains widely approved) \"shocks\" the dissenters' consciences … perhaps they should doubt the calibration of their consciences, or, better still, the usefulness of \"conscience shocking\" as a legal test.\n\nJustice Blackmun, joined by Justices Stevens and Souter, dissented. Blackmun believed that \"[n]othing could be more contrary to contemporary standards of decency or more shocking to the conscience than to execute a person who is actually innocent.\" Blackmun would have remanded the case to the district court for a determination as to whether a hearing should be held and to resolve the merits of Herrera's claim of actual innocence.\n\nChastising the majority for its circumspection, Blackmun wrote, \"We really are being asked to decide whether the Constitution forbids the execution of a person who has been validly convicted and sentenced, but who, nonetheless, can prove his innocence with newly discovered evidence,\" and he took note of \"the State of Texas' astonishing protestation to the contrary.\"\n\nBlackmun argued that the majority's concern with a new trial being less reliable than the original trial missed the point. The question was not whether a new trial would be more reliable than the first trial; it was whether, in light of the new evidence, the first trial was sufficiently reliable to allow the State to execute Herrera. Blackmun would have held that in order to be entitled to relief, a death-sentenced inmate should have to be able to demonstrate that he is probably actually innocent; Blackmun distinguished this from the lower standard of probable reasonable doubt, which is applied to procedural default issues.\n\nFour months after the Court's ruling, Herrera was executed. His last words were: \"I am innocent, innocent, innocent. . . . I am an innocent man, and something very wrong is taking place tonight.\"\n\n\n"}

As the country's leading conservative paper, \"La Nación\"'s main competitor is the centrist \"Clarín\".\n\nThe paper was founded on 4 January 1870 (replacing the former publication \"Nación Argentina\"), by former Argentine President Bartolomé Mitre and associates. Until 1914, the managing editor was José Luis Murature, Foreign Minister of Argentina from 1914-1916. Enjoying Latin America's largest readership until the 1930s, its daily circulation averaged around 350,000, and exceeded only by \"Crítica\", a Buenos Aires tabloid. The 1945 launch of \"Clarín\" created a new rival, and following the 1962 closure of \"Crítica\", and the 1975 suspension of \"Crónica\", \"La Nación\" secured its position as the chief market rival of \"Clarín\".\n\nSome of the most famous writers in the Spanish-speaking world: José Martí, Miguel de Unamuno, Eduardo Mallea, José Ortega y Gasset, Rubén Darío, Alfonso Reyes, Jorge Luis Borges, Mario Vargas Llosa and Manuel Mujica Láinez have all appeared regularly in its columns.\n\nOriginally published in Bartolomé Mitre's home (today, the Museo Mitre), its offices were moved a number of times until, in 1929, a Plateresque headquarters on Florida Street was inaugurated. The publishing group today is headquartered in the Bouchard Plaza Tower, a 26-storey Post-modern office building developed between 2000 and 2004 over the news daily's existing, six-storey building.\n\nThe director of \"La Nación\", Bartolomé Mitre (the founder's great-great-grandson), shares control of ADEPA, the Argentine newspaper industry trade group, and of Papel Prensa, the nation's leading newsprint manufacturer, with Grupo Clarín. The newspaper was part of the conflict between Kirchnerism and the media, when Lidia Papaleo denounced, endorsed by the Kirchners, that they would have been forced to sell Papel Prensa under torture during the Dirty War. Judge Julián Ercolini acquitted him in 2016, pointing that there was no evidence to support the claim.\n\nIn early 2012, \"La Nación\" bought ImpreMedia, the publisher of \"El Diario-La Prensa\", \"La Opinión\" and other US-based Spanish-language newspapers. On October 30, 2016, \"La Nación\" announced a change in its printing format, with weekday editions now being printed as tabloids and weekend editions retaining the traditional broadsheet format.\n\nIn 2019, the Society for News Design named \"La Nación\" as the World's Best Designed Newspaper, sharing the award together with \"The Sunday Times\" and \"The New York Times\".\n\n\"La Nación\"'s daily circulation averaged 165,166 in 2012, and still represented nearly 20% of the daily newspaper circulation in Buenos Aires; the paper is also distributed nationwide and around the world.\n\nAccording to third-party web analytics providers Alexa and SimilarWeb, La Nación's website is the 9th and 17th most visited in Argentina respectively, as of August 2015. SimilarWeb rates the site as the 4th most visited news website in Argentina, attracting almost 32 million visitors per month.\n\n"}

As a young man, he entered the Colégio Abílio, run by the Baron of Macaúbas, Abílio César Borges, where he was a good student, and the editor of school journal \"O Archote\". In 1879, he was transferred to Colégio Pedro II, where he wrote his first book, \"Uma Tragédia no Amazonas\".\n\nIn 1881 he moves to São Paulo in order to graduate in Law, where he was influenced by the Abolitionist and Republican ideals, and befriended Abolitionist Luís Gama. He wrote for many journals of São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, frequently under pen name Rapp, but he had many others, such as Pompeu Stell, Um moço do povo, Lauro, Fabricius, Raul D., Raulino Palma.

He had already been personally slandered for his allegedly closet homosexuality — something which led him to challenge his former friend, the poet Olavo Bilac, to a duel in 1892; he had also broken other friendships in the same resounding fashion.

{"id": "2122652", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2122652", "title": "Página/12", "text": "Página/12\n\nPágina/12 is a newspaper published in Buenos Aires, Argentina. It was founded on May 25, 1987, by journalist Jorge Lanata in association with writer Osvaldo Soriano and Alberto Elizalde Leal. His first president was businessman Fernando Sokolowicz, in 1994 \"Grupo Clarín\" supposedly owned a share; Lanata claimed in a 2007 interview that businessman Rudy Ulloa (a businessman close to former President Néstor Kirchner) also owned a share. Since 2016 the newspaper is property of Grupo Octubre, an Argentine multimedia company created and directed by Víctor Santa María, president of the Justicialist Party in the Buenos Aires city.\n\nThe publishers also distribute a supplement covering Rosario area news, \"Rosario/12\", since 1991.\n\nAccording to in house surveys, 58% of the newspaper readership is between 18 and 52 years old and belong to the medium and medium high socio economic groups: AB and C1/C2 \n\nThe name of the paper comes from the fact that its preliminary editions as it was being developed had 12 pages. The name had already been chosen, thus the publishers opted to reserve the twelfth page for reports or news stories of central importance. Another version holds that the paper was going to be called \"Reporter\" but when the owners went to register the name, they were told that the name was taken. They then decided to count the number of pages in order to choose a name.\n\nWith a stark design, a daily circulation of 10,000 copies and a size of 16 pages that doubled within a few weeks, the paper was a sharp contrast with other Argentinian newspapers due to its progressive orientation, its in-depth articles (each one occupying more than a page on average) and rich analysis. Inspired by the French paper Libération, its style contrasted with the conventional Argentine press, where a higher priority was placed on showcasing a wide variety of information as opposed to more probing reports.\n\nThe editorial staff included journalists such as Horacio Verbitsky, writers Tomás Eloy Martínez, Osvaldo Soriano and José María Pasquini Durán, Juan Gelman, Eduardo Galeano, Osvaldo Bayer, Rodrigo Fresán, Alan Pauls, Juan Forn, Eduardo Berti, Ernesto Tenembaum, Homero Alsina Thevenet, José Pablo Feinmann, Juan Sasturain Miguel Repiso (Rep) who since the release of first edition has been in charge of illustrating the back cover and various sections of the paper, have been regular contributors. The first manager was Jorge Lanata, later replaced by Ernesto Tiffenberg.\n\nThe newspaper had a close relation with the governments of Néstor and Cristina Kirchner, and received huge amounts of state advertising as a result. Cristina Kirchner made a speech during the 25th anniversary of the foundation of the newspaper in 2012, praising the editorial line, journalists and authorities. She said that \"there is a true cultural battle. We'll keep fighting in all fields, and Página/12 too. They will only defeat us when we cease to fight\". She made reference to a conspiracy theory, frequent in the \"Relato K\", that considers that the Kirchners were attacked by a cabal of hegemonic groups.\n\nMauricio Macri was elected president in 2015, ending the Kirchnerite regime, and the advertising scheme that benefited Página/12. The newspaper had to seek private advertising as a result. The newspaper was also bought by Víctor Santa María, president of the Justicialist Party in the Buenos Aires city, and president of the Suterh union. Santa María had used the union funding to start the \"Octubre\" group, which also includes the newspaper \"Diario Z\", the magazines \"Caras y Caretas\" and \"Planeta urbano\" and two radios.\n\nPágina/12 is a Kirchnerite newspaper. The owner Víctor Santa María considers that, although it is not a complete advocate of the Kirchners, the newspaper supports most of their policies. In turn, it is also against the policies of the president Mauricio Macri.\n\nSanta María considers that media independence and journalistic objectivity do not exist.\n\nWhen Julio Nudler, who was the head of the economic department of Página/12, impeached the chief of the Kirchner cabinet with corruption allegations in 2004 the directorate of Página/12 refused to publish an article of Nudler. Nudler accused Página/12 of censorship and the article was finally published, with an added note from his colleague Horacio Verbitsky stating that some of the data in the article was wrong.\n\nThe government of the Kirchners favored Página/12 with a huge portion of the advertising media selection. State advertising was destined to media politically aligned to the Kirchners, instead of to the most sold ones; this was used as a reward to such media for their political support. The Kirchner administration ceased to release full numbers of this operation in 2009. As of 2010, the partial numbers released revealed that Página/12 received 33.9 million pesos, 26.5% of the total advertising. The media of Sergio Szpolski, also a vocal supporter to the Kirchners, got 21% of the total, and both of them combined received the 47.5% of all the advertising. In contrast, Clarín, the highest sold newspaper, only got 12.9 million, 10% of the total advertising. Mauricio Macri was elected president in 2015, and redefined the advertising scheme. Página/12 received 3.2 million in 2017 under the new scheme. Víctor Santa María considers that this is a campaign of defamation by a cabal of hegemonic groups, and that the freedom of the press is in danger. He was supported by a number of former populist Latin American presidents, who wrote a manifesto against the perceived censorship against Página/12.\n\nWhen Jorge Bergoglio was elected as Pope Francis, Página/12 published renewed allegations about his actions during the Dirty War. However, due to the Pope's popularity in Argentina, Cristina Kirchner made what the political analyst Claudio Fantini called a \"Copernican shift\" in her relations with him and fully embraced the Francis phenomenon. Página/12 then removed their controversial articles about Bergoglio, written by Horacio Verbitsky, from their web page, as a result of this change.\n\nA 2012 comic strip titled \"An Adventure of David Gueto\" featured a parody of a DJ, asking the prisoners of a Nazi concentration camp to dance, and a caricature of Adolf Hitler approved the idea, adding that \"if they are relaxed, you get a better soap\". Sergio Widder, director for Latin America office of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, said: \"This so-called parody is beyond offensive. As a newspaper that has been a champion for human rights and fight against racism since its foundation, we expect the editors of Pagina/12 to immediately and publicly apologize for this distortion of history. Pagina/12 'Young Culture' section would better serve its youthful readers by teaching them the importance of preserving the memory of the Nazi genocide through remembrance, education and prevention of human rights violations\".

The station is owned by Entercom. Its transmitter is off Wolfback Ridge Road on Mount Beacon in the Marin Headlands near Sausalito, California. The studios and offices are located on Battery Street in downtown San Francisco.\n\nThe 97.3 MHz frequency signed on the air as KWBR-FM, dedicated September 14, 1947. The station was owned by the Warner Brothers of Oakland (of no relation to the film studio), with studios and transmitter on the side of Twin Peaks. It was a sister station of KWBR-AM (earlier known as KLS and the current day KMKY 1310 AM.\n\n97.3 FM was home to Family Radio's KEAR starting in 1956. On September 13, 1978, Family Radio purchased a much stronger frequency, which saw KEAR and the religious format move to 106.9, as part of a three-way deal that also saw KCBS-FM move from 98.9 MHz to 97.3 MHz. KCBS-FM, known as \"97K,\" programmed a hot adult contemporary format. Over the years, the station evolved in more of a classic hits direction. For a time, 97K aired the syndicated \"American Top 40\", a countdown show starring Casey Kasem.\n\nOn January 25, 1982, at midnight, KCBS-FM became KRQR, \"The Bay Area Rocker,\" with a hard-edged album-oriented rock (AOR) format, to compete against leading rock station KMEL. The first song played under the KRQR call sign was \"I'm a Rocker\" by Bruce Springsteen. KRQR's harder approach helped start a long run as a dominant rock station. The year was a busy one for Bay Area rock stations. In May of that year, KSFX dropped rock and went to a talk format as KGO-FM. A month later, on August 23, KQAK switched to rock as \"The Quake\". And in September, KFOG dropped beautiful music for a more eclectic mix of rock.\n\nEven with four AOR stations in San Francisco, in addition to two more in San Jose, KRQR still dominated amidst the stiff competition. KQAK was the first to give up, dropped AOR in April 1983. The station switched to modern rock. KRQR and KFOG put lots of pressure on the tightly-formatted KMEL, which flipped to CHR in 1984.\n\nKRQR's rock format continued throughout the 1980s and up to 1993, when it moved to more of a classic rock direction. By 1995, the hard rock format was in decline across the country, as modern rock was on the rise. To combat this, the station evolved back to a more current direction in February 1996. However, this failed to turn around ratings, and on June 5, 1996, at 3 PM, KRQR flipped to KLLC, \"Alice 97.3,\" with a Modern AC format. The flip to \"Alice\" made the station one of the first in the U.S. to air the format. KLLC gradually evolved into Hot AC in 2010.\n\nOn February 2, 2017, CBS Radio announced it would merge with Entercom. The merger was approved on November 9, 2017, and was consummated on the 17th.\n\nThe station's most popular show has been in weekday morning drive. Originally known as \"The Sarah and Vinnie Show\", it was hosted by Sarah Clark (a.k.a. Sarah Emily Lyman) and Vinnie Hasson, then known as Vinnie Crackhorn, until he was fired in 2002 due to problems with alcohol. After a several month search for a replacement for Vinnie, the station selected Mike Nelson, a.k.a. \"The DJ with No Name,\" to become the co-host of the renamed \"Sarah and No-Name Show.\" After 6 years, Nelson was let go by station management on July 17, 2008, who announced that Vinnie would re-team with Sarah starting on August 4, 2008, returning the show's name to \"The Sarah and Vinnie Show.\" Nelson later returned to his previous station, Live 105, as the host of the morning show before becoming a part of KFOG's morning show in 2015.\n\nKLLC is rebroadcast on the following FM Booster:\n\nKLLC broadcasts in the HD Radio format. Its HD2 subchannel originally carried an automated chill music format, known as \"Chill with Alice.\" According to the radio industry website RadioStats.Net, KLLC has the most visited site of its kind in the United States.\n\nOn October 11, 2018, KLLC-HD2 switched to Radio.com's LGBTQ talk and EDM dance music format, branded as \"Out Now.\" On November 1, 2018, the station rebranded as \"Channel Q\".\n\nThe station sponsors three seasonal concerts each year: the free \"Summerthing\" show in June and the \"Now and Zen Fest\" in September, both in Golden Gate Park, and \"Alice in Winterland\" in December. Featured acts have included Alanis Morissette, Duran Duran, Five for Fighting, Smash Mouth, and Train.

BARC is a multi-disciplinary research centre with extensive infrastructure for advanced research and development covering the entire spectrum of nuclear science, engineering and related areas.\n\nBARC's core mandate is to sustain peaceful applications of nuclear energy, primarily for power generation. It manages all facts of nuclear power generation, from theoretical design of reactors to, computerised modelling and simulation, risk analysis, development and testing of new reactor fuel materials, etc. It also conducts research in spent fuel processing and safe disposal of nuclear waste. Its other research focus areas are applications for isotopes in industries, medicine, agriculture, etc. BARC operates a number of research reactors across the country.\n\nThe Government of India created the Atomic Energy Establishment, Trombay (AEET) on 3 January 1954. It was established to consolidate all the research and development activity for nuclear reactors and technology under the Atomic Energy Commission. All scientists and engineers engaged in the fields of reactor designing and development, instrumentation, metallurgy and material science etc., were transferred with their respective programmes from the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR) to AEET, with TIFR retaining its original focus for fundamental research in the sciences. After Homi Jehangir Bhabha's death in 1966, the centre was renamed as the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre on 22 January 1967.\n\nThe first reactors at BARC and its affiliated power generation centres were imported from the west. India's first power reactors, installed at the Tarapur Atomic Power Station were from the United States.\n\nThe primary importance of BARC is as a research centre. The BARC and the Indian government has consistently maintained that the reactors are used for this purpose only: Apsara (1956; named by the then Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru when he likened the blue Cerenkov radiation to the beauty of the Apsaras), CIRUS (1960; the \"Canada-India Reactor\" with assistance from the US), the now-defunct ZERLINA (1961; Zero Energy Reactor for Lattice Investigations and Neutron Assay), Purnima I (1972), Purnima II (1984), Dhruva (1985), Purnima III (1990), and KAMINI.\n\nThe plutonium used in India's 1974 Smiling Buddha nuclear test came from CIRUS. The 1974 test (and the 1998 tests that followed) gave Indian scientists the technological know-how and confidence not only to develop nuclear fuel for future reactors to be used in power generation and research, but also the capacity to refine the same fuel into weapons-grade fuel to be used in the development of nuclear weapons. \n\nBARC also designed and built India's first Pressurised water reactor at Kalpakkam, a 80MW land based prototype of INS Arihant's nuclear power unit, as well as the Arihant's propulsion reactor.\n\nIndia is not a part of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), citing concerns that it unfairly favours the established nuclear powers, and provides no provision for complete nuclear disarmament. Indian officials argued that India's refusal to sign the treaty stemmed from its fundamentally discriminatory character; the treaty places restrictions on the non-nuclear weapons states but does little to curb the modernisation and expansion of the nuclear arsenals of the nuclear weapons states.\n\nMore recently, India and the United States signed an agreement to enhance nuclear cooperation between the two countries, and for India to participate in an international consortium on fusion research, ITER (International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor).\n\nThe BARC also conducts research in biotechnology at the Gamma Gardens, and has developed numerous disease resistant and high-yielding crop varieties, particularly groundnuts. It also conducts research in Liquid Metal Magnetohydrodynamics for power generation.\n\nOn 4 June 2005, with the goal of encouraging research in basic sciences, BARC started the Homi Bhabha National Institute. Research institutions affiliated to BARC(Bhabha Atomic Research Centre) include IGCAR (Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research), RRCAT (Raja Ramanna Centre for Advanced Technology), and VECC (Variable Energy Cyclotron Centre).\n\nPower projects that have benefited from BARC expertise but which fall under the NPCIL (Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited) are KAPP (Kakrapar Atomic Power Project), RAPP (Rajasthan Atomic Power Project), and TAPP (Tarapur Atomic Power Project).\n\nThe Bhabha Atomic Research Centre in addition to its nuclear research mandate, also conducts research in other high technology areas like accelerators, micro electron beams, materials design, supercomputers, and computer vision among the few. The BARC has dedicated departments for these specialised fields. BARC has designed and developed, for its own use an infrastructure of supercomputers, Anupam using state of the art technology.\n\n"}

In pursuit of its mandate DAE has established several research and development centres, grant-in-aid institutions and has taken in its fold several existing grant-in-aid institutions. All research institutions under the umbrella of the DAE have been pursuing academic programme right from their inception. Considering continued expansion of atomic energy programme and considering the fact that the DAE institutions are engaged in human resource development programmes, the DAE Science Research Council recommended in 2003 that the DAE should establish a university level institution. After completing all formalities, Prime minister of India, Manmohan Singh, announced the approval of the government of India for setting up of HBNI on June 4, 2005. It is named after the late Indian physicist Homi J. Bhabha.

To cater to increased demand of manpower, Training Schools were established at other places and all Training Schools offer a well designed one year intensive programme for fresh engineers and scientists. This provides the students a very sound academic base in nuclear science and technology. For historical reasons, the name \"Training School\" continues, though given the depth and range of courses, it functions as a graduate school.\n\nCourses are conducted at all CIs and at BARC Training schools at:\n\nHBNI encourages students to take courses at other reputable institutes and provide for credit transfer. In particular, students regularly take additional courses at Indian Institute of Technology Bombay or Indian Institute of Technology Madras.\n\nThe National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) ranked Homi Bhabha National Institute 41 overall in India and 26 among universities in 2018.

The airport is owned and operated by the Chattanooga Metropolitan Airport Authority. It is a Class C airport serviced by Chattanooga Approach. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2019–2023 categorized it as a small-hub primary commercial service facility.\n\nThe first scheduled airline flight in Tennessee took place in Chattanooga in 1928 at \"Marr Field\", dedicated in December 1919, named for Walter L. Marr, off present-day Amnicola Highway. Chattanooga was a stopover on the Contract Air Mail route served by Interstate Airlines between Atlanta and Chicago. Charles Lindbergh, the world-famous aviator who had piloted the \"Spirit of St. Louis\" over the Atlantic Ocean in May 1927, flew into Marr Field on October 5, 1927.\n\nIn 1930, due to the interest and foresight of John Lovell, a new Chattanooga Airport opened with an unpaved runway at its present location and was named \"Lovell Field\" in his honor. In 1936, the landing area was expanded and runways paved as a part of the New Deal's Works Progress Administration (WPA). The original terminal building was built at that time.\n\nDuring World War II Lovell Field was a military training facility. Growth in aviation in the 1950s led to a transfer of airport operations to the City of Chattanooga and airport expansion with a new runway, the primary runway today. The original terminal building, dating from the 1930s, was expanded in 1950 and 1955 by the city before being replaced by a new terminal in 1964.\n\nThe Airport's ownership was transferred from Chattanooga to the Chattanooga Metropolitan Airport Authority (CMAA) in July 1985.\n\nThe current passenger terminal, designed by Gensler, opened in 1992.\n\nIn 2011, a 1 megawatt solar farm located on the southwest corner of the airfield was constructed. An additional 1.1 megawatts were added to the solar farm in the summer of 2013. By 2017, the farm was providing approximately 90% of the airport's electricity.\n\nChattanooga Metropolitan Airport was home to the 241st Engineering Installation Squadron (241 EIS) of the Tennessee Air National Guard until late 2010, when the squadron moved to a Bonny Oaks facility near the airport.\n\nLovell Field covers and has two asphalt runways: 2/20 is 7,400 x 150 ft (2,256 x 46 m) and 15/33 is 5,575 x 150 ft (1,699 x 46 m).\n\nChattanooga Metropolitan Airport has one concourse with five gates. Airline service is provided by United Express, Delta Air Lines, American Eagle, and Allegiant Air. The largest aircraft currently serving the airport are the A319/A320 and MD-80 series operated by Allegiant Air and Delta Air Lines respectively. Delta had flown a mainline service from 1947 until withdrawing in 1995 after 48 years in favor of affiliates like Atlantic Southeast Airlines operating smaller regional jets, such as the CRJ-200. Delta subsequently decided to resume its mainline service flights, including DC-9s, to Chattanooga in September 2012.\n\nGeneral aviation is serviced by Wilson Air Center FBO. The general aviation ramp is in two locations, one on the South side of the main terminal and the other to the North. The locations are referred to as \"Air North\" and \"Air South.\" General aviation can find service at either location. In August 2011, Wilson Air Center opened a facility on the west side of the field.\n\n\n"}

Its slogan was \"A World of Information in a few words\".\n\nUnder the original name of \"The Buenos Ayres Herald\", it was founded on 15 September 1876 by Scottish immigrant William Cathcart. At first it consisted of a single sheet with advertising on the front and mostly shipping coverage on the back. When Cathcart sold the paper a year later, it changed from a weekly to a daily format, focusing on more typical newspaper content, but always with a large shipping section. It quickly became the main source of local information for the English-speaking population of Buenos Aires.\n\nIn 1925 the Rugeroni brothers, Junius Julius and Claude Ronald, bought the paper.\n\nThe Evening Post Publishing Company from Charleston, South Carolina, United States, purchased a controlling interest in Junius Rugeroni's holdings in 1968. \n\nDuring the military dictatorship in Argentina (1976–1983) \"The Buenos Aires Herald\", under the direction of the British journalist Robert Cox, was the only local media that told the story of the forced disappearances of people from the opposition to the regime. Due to this, Cox was detained for a while and his family received threats, and an attempt was made to kidnap his wife. This forced him to leave the country with his family in 1979. Following these departures, the threats continued against Cox's replacement, James Neilson and against Dan Newland as the newspaper's main editorial writers.\nThe newspaper's opposition against the military regime between 1976 and 1983 led to constant threats. Staff writer Andrew Graham-Yooll was forced into exile. At the time, Graham-Yooll was also writing for the British \"Daily Telegraph\". He returned to \"The Buenos Aires Herald\" as editor-in-chief in 1994.\n\nColumnist Eric Ehrmann wrote for the paper during the transition from dictatorship to democracy (1985–1990) under the editorships of Dan Newland, James Neilson and others. His articles discussed the proliferation risks associated with the controversial Condor (Tammuz) medium range guided missile system being built by Argentina and Iraqi Ba'ath Party strongman Saddam Hussein along with European companies, and controversial dual-use issues that caused Argentina to ratify the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. Ehrmann was simultaneously writing columns about Southern Cone politics for the American periodicals \"The Christian Science Monitor\" and \"National Review\". \n\nIn 1998, the Evening Post Publishing Company became the sole owner of the newspaper. On 15 December 2007 the Argentine businessman Sergio Szpolski bought the newspaper and added it to his multimedia holdings. Almost a year later, Szpolski sold it to Amfin, which publishes the financial newspaper \"Ámbito Financiero\". In February 2015 Grupo Indalo became the majority owner.\n\nIn January 2015, Damián Pachter, a journalist for the \"Herald\"s online version, broke the news of prosecutor Alberto Nisman's death to the country on Twitter. Nisman died in mysterious circumstances the day before he was set to give details at Congress regarding his legal charges against President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner for allegedly covering up the investigation into the 1994 AMIA Jewish community centre bombings. Pachter's source remains unknown, and the journalist fled Argentina for Israel subsequently, saying he feared for his life. Journalists at the paper's editorial office later said that Patcher never told them that he had been threatened, and that he said that he was leaving the newspaper because of health problems.\n\nOn Friday 28 July 2017 the last edition of the only English-language daily newspaper in Latin America was published. The paper had moved to weekly publication after the last daily edition on 26 October 2016, shedding most of its staff after \"facing difficulties for a while now\", but with the drop in circulation it was not able to survive financially.\n\nThe \"Buenos Aires Herald\" had a Berliner format, with supplements:\n\n"}

KSJO airs a Bollywood music radio format branded as Bolly 92.3. It is owned by Universal Media Access. The studios and offices are on Hellyer Avenue in San Jose.\n\nKSJO has an effective radiated power of 32,000 watts. Its transmitter is in Santa Teresa County Park south of downtown San Jose. KSJO's signal is limited due to a height above average terrain of only 136 meters (446 feet). Some Bay Area FM stations have towers three times that height. KSJO-FM1, a 67-watt booster station, simulcasts KSJO in Pleasanton, California. KSJO broadcasts in the HD Radio hybrid format.\n\nKSJO is the second call sign assigned in San Jose, initially applied to both an AM station (now KLIV) and an FM station. The FM station began broadcasting in 1947 on 95.3 FM. By 1949, KSJO was airing on both 95.3 FM and 1590 AM. In November 1957, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) approved KSJO-FM's application to move to 92.3 MHz. The move was made in 1959.\n\nRon Hayes worked for KSJO in the mid-1950s before launching his acting career.\n\nPrior to 1968, KSJO was owned by SRD Broadcasting, consisting of Scott Elrod of San Francisco, Don Bekins of Bekins Van Lines and Richard \"Dick\" Garvin. As freeform rock was growing in popularity, with Tom Donahue's KMPX in nearby San Francisco becoming a national trendsetter, KSJO dropped jazz, starting in the evening only at first with Mark Williams and Jim Hilsabeck. After a few months Elrod and team brought in Bob Sobelman, a radio veteran, to GM the station and Larry Mitchell, a top L.A. program director, took over the helm. \"The Light from Below\" was one of the early slogans but did not live long (\"below the San Francisco Bay\"). The format was pure free-form progressive rock. The previous simple female-sex-symbol logo morphed into a red-white-and-blue logo and bumper sticker designed by Diane Roberts of Los Gatos, and the announcing staff was all-male for many years. Brief stint program directors included Bill Slator and Dick Kimball but for 5 plus years Douglas (Droese) was the program director, remaining so until the Sterling buy out in 1974. The station was later sold to Sterling Recreation Organization (SRO) of Seattle, Washington.\n\nFor much of its history, KSJO was locked in a bitter rivalry with KOME, which also flipped to rock in 1971. At one point, in the early 1970s (September 1974 through June 1975), KSJO briefly switched to a Top 40 format, before returning to rock. By the end of the decade, KOME had surpassed KSJO in the ratings.\n\nThe rock war heated up when stations in San Francisco started changing to the format. KSAN was the main San Francisco competitor throughout the 1970s, and more stations arrived. In the mid- to late-1970s, KSJO was known for its outrageous morning show. Advertising Director Perry White (Hartline) partnered with Michael \"Mother Deal\" to make morning news fun for the 'rocker' audience. With DJ Tawn Mastrey as Musical Director, KSJO helped usher in New Wave and Punk Music to the Bay Area. At one point, in late 1982, four different stations in San Francisco alone were programming the format, in addition to KSJO and KOME.\n\nHowever, in 1982, led by broadcast veteran Jack Chunn, KSJO started to dominate the Rock Radio scene in San Jose (and with respectable ratings to the north in San Francisco and to the south in Monterey/Santa Cruz). Program Director Larry 'Baby Lee Roy' Hansen assembled a strong group of air personalities including Trevor Ley and Jim Taylor (mornings), Ken Anthony (afternoons), Nicki Stevens (evenings) and Jim Seagull (overnights). Combined with strong marketing and a guerrilla street presence from promotions director Bob Jenkins and assistant Rodney Whitaker, KSJO dominated as 'The Bay Area's Home for Rock & Roll' for most of the 1980s.\n\nNarragansett Broadcasting out of Providence, Rhode Island purchased the station from Sterling Recreation Organization in 1985 and installed former KOME General Sales Manager, Gary Rodriguez as General Manager. Gary Rodriguez brought in from KOME Dana Jang as Operations Manager and Michael Hernandez as Sales Manager. Laurie Roberts joined from KOME to perform morning drive along with Ted Kopulos, also a KOME mainstay. Former KOME air personality, Gary T. joined for afternoon drive with overnights performed by Dave Numme from KZAP in Sacramento.\n\nKSJO is credited with airing the first-ever AIDS radiothon in 1987, raising $25,000 for a San Jose AIDS hospice. Considering their reputation as a macho rock station, this was a complete departure for a day, but audience response was upbeat and KSJO promoted a candid dialogue about HIV/AIDS with their 18-34 audience, the most sexually active group in the U.S. Program Director Ken Anthony and morning personality Paul 'Lobster' Wells organized the event with mid day host Zeb Norris, afternoon personality Laurie Roberts, promo director Bob Jenkins and assistants Martyn Wright and Mike Russell. Several rock stars donated their time and merchandise to help raise funds, including Neil Young, Ronnie Montrose, Mark Andes of Heart, Neal Schon of Journey, Paul Kantner of Jefferson Airplane and Jimmie Vaughan of the Fabulous Thunderbirds.\n\nBy 1994, KOME had flipped to modern rock and KSJO was the stand-alone AOR station in Santa Clara Valley. Also, many of the San Francisco rock stations had long changed to different formats as well. KSJO rode a wave of popularity during the decade due primarily to the appeal of morning personalities Lamont and Tonelli. By 1998, KSJO's signal was simulcast on three other separate stations (located near 92.3 on the dial) around the San Francisco Bay Area: 92.7 KXJO in Alameda/Oakland, 92.7 KMJO in Marina and 92.1 KFJO in Walnut Creek.\n\nAs the new millennium arrived, KSJO's fortunes started to slide. Lamont and Tonelli were signed away by KSAN-FM in late 2002, and KXJO was sold to a separate entity that same year, flipping to a CHR format. KSJO's ratings started to slide as the demographics of the Bay Area changed. An increasingly large local Hispanic population and the rise of Hip Hop helped to chip away at the heritage rock station. Radio veteran Dave Wohlman was named PD in 2004 and began the task of re-inventing the rock legend with a new staff, sound and direction.\n\nKSJO's owner, iHeartMedia (then Clear Channel Communications), had instituted an ambitious initiative to introduce more Spanish-language programming into various markets across the country. When the Walnut Creek simulcast station, KFJO, became KABL in 2004, many speculated that KSJO would soon drop rock for a Spanish-language format. The end came unannounced at 7 PM on October 28, 2004, when KSJO, after 35 years as a rock station, played its last song, \"Mexican Radio\" by Wall of Voodoo, and immediately launched a new Mexican oldies format as \"La Preciosa\". Longtime listeners were angered at the sudden loss of the Bay Area's last remaining active rock station.\n\nOn August 4, 2008, Clear Channel placed the station's assets into an entity called the Aloha Station Trust in order to sell off the station. This was due to Clear Channel being above the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) ownership limits. These limits were imposed when Clear Channel was officially taken private by Bain Capital Partners on July 30, 2008.\n\nOn September 18, 2009, KSJO picked up the \"Channel 104.9\" modern rock format from KCNL, branded as \"Channel 92.3\". The staff consisted of Joe Sib in the mornings, Jessie on middays, MegaTanner (formerly on KITS in San Francisco), and Teddy and Chris. \"La Preciosa\", meanwhile, was moved to 104.9.\n\nUnlike many Alternative stations, Channel 92.3 focused on new music and Alternative classics from the '70s and the '80s, with not as much emphasis on the '90s.\n\nOn November 10, 2010, RadioInsight announced that Principle Broadcasting Network San Jose, LLC, which owns brokered ethnic stations in various cities, made an agreement with Clear Channel's Aloha Station Trust to buy KSJO. Principle also owns KLOK in San Jose. The sale was completed on February 28, 2011; at this time, the staff of KSJO was let go, and the station ran without airstaff, playing a broad-based alternative format dubbed \"SALT: Save Alternative\". It also included heavy promotions of savealternative.com.\n\nOn March 16, 2011, former Channel 92.3 hosts Teddy and Madden were invited back to give the station and its alternative rock format a proper send-off. At 10 AM, KSJO launched a new Chinese-language format branded as China 92.3. Save Alternative continued to stream online at savealternative.com and also added a simulcast on 104.9 HD-2. In addition, Save Alternative was broadcast on 104.9 KCNL every Saturday and Sunday night from 8 PM until midnight. (Save Alternative was discontinued on-air in May 2012, when KCNL was sold to the USC and flipped to KDFC's classical format but the format remains online and can be listened to at savealternative.com.)\n\nKSJO began broadcasting dance music on its HD2 sub-channel in June 2011.\n\nOn May 1, 2012, the station rebranded as \"U92.3 The Universal FM,\" also called \"La Universal 92.3 FM.\" The station developed and aired a number of programs in Spanish, Chinese, Russian, Vietnamese and Persian.\n\nIn November 2013, KSJO-HD2 ended its dance music format and re-introduced the S*ALT (Save Alternative) alternative rock format. Later on, live programming from S*ALT was featured several times a week on KSJO.\n\nOn April 30, 2014, U92.3 broadcasters were given notifications to leave within 30 days as the station had been leased to an unnamed bidder. The bidder was revealed to be Cumulus Media, who planned to air country music under Cumulus' new Nash FM branding.\n\nOn May 25, 2014, at 9:03 PM, following the end of U92.3 programming, KSJO began stunting with the sound of a fictional train named \"The Night Train 923\" leaving from Nashville. It also featured a conductor taking the tickets of country stars while saying that the time of arrival would come the next day at 9:23 AM, as well as the Nash FM instrumental jingles and bits of music from the artists \"admitted.\" The launch of \"Nash FM\" came at the time promised, with \"How Country Feels\" by Randy Houser being the first song played.\n\nOn March 1, 2016, Cumulus Media moved KSJO's Nash FM format to the HD2 subchannel of KSAN after Cumulus decided to end its deal with Universal. It was replaced with Bollywood music, billing itself as \"Bolly 92.3,\" one of the first of its kind in the United States to feature music and artists from the Bollywood genre.\n\nKSJO is rebroadcast on the following FM Booster:\n\n\n"}

A small section is west-central Georgia, in the region around Columbus. This is bordered by area code 334 to the west in Alabama, area code 478 to the east, area code 229 to the south, and metro Atlanta's 404, 678, 770, and 470. It does not border the landline area of 404, only the cellphone area.\n\nThe major section of 706 wraps around from Rome in northwest Georgia, east through the mountains past Dahlonega, meeting its narrowest point at Toccoa, then broadening south to Athens and Augusta. It touches Alabama's area code 256/938 and 334 on the far west, Tennessee's area code 423 on the northwest, North Carolina's area code 828 and Upstate South Carolina's area code 864 to the north-northeast, and midlands area codes 803 and 839 to the east, and middle Georgia's 478 and metro Atlanta as above.\n\nIt was created in 1992 as a split from 404, and was Georgia's first new area code in 38 years. Previously, 404 had served the northern half of the state, roughly everything from Columbus and Augusta northward to the Tennessee and North Carolina borders. After the split, 404 was retained by the metro area.\n\nOriginally, 706 completely wrapped around the inner ring of the Atlanta metropolitan area. It also included a number of southern exurbs of Atlanta. However, the residents of these areas felt chagrin at no longer being associated with 404. Shortly after 706 commenced service, BellSouth returned several of these areas to 404. The boundary was redrawn in such a way that Columbus and the surrounding area was cut off from the rest of the 706 territory, making 706 one of the few area codes that is not contiguous. However, 404 had been close to exhaustion even after the creation of 706, and the return of the southern exurbs forced the Georgia Public Service Commission to switch most of Atlanta's suburbs over to 770 sooner than it had planned.\n\nIn June 2005, the GPSC announced that 706 had nearly exhausted its capacity for new telephone exchange prefixes. The supply of numbers was further limited because the 706 territory includes portions of three LATAs that spill into adjacent states. The Atlanta LATA, which includes Columbus, spills into Alabama. The northern portion is split between the Atlanta and Chattanooga LATAs. The Augusta LATA spills into South Carolina. On June 24, 2005, the NANPA assigned area code 762 for this purpose. However, the Columbus area was not large enough for its own area code, but was too large to stay in 706. For this reason, it was decided to make 762 an overlay, with 10-digit dialing to be allowed on September 3. On April 1, 2007, 10-digit dialing became mandatory in the 706/762 territory.\n\nThis is the third time that the GPSC has flip-flopped on its policy for deciding how new area codes would be assigned. Atlanta's suburbs were split into 770, but then both 404 and 770 were overlaid with 678, and cellphones (originally 404 only) can now have any of those no matter where in the metro area. Southern Georgia was then split three ways instead of an overlay.\n\nDespite the rapid growth in 706/762's main section (particularly the northern portion), it is nowhere near exhausting. Under current projections, it is expected to remain in its unusual, non-contiguous state until after 2049. \n\nPrior to 1990, area code 706 covered regions of Mexico.\n\nBanks, Burke (part with area code 478), Chattooga, Catoosa, Chattahoochee, Clarke, Columbia, Dade, Dawson, Elbert, Fannin, Franklin, Floyd Gilmer, Glascock, Gordon, Greene, Habersham, Hancock, Harris, Hart, Heard, Jackson, Jasper, Jefferson (part with area code 478), Jenkins, Lincoln, Lumpkin, Madison, McDuffie, Meriwether, Morgan, Murray, Muscogee, Oconee, Oglethorpe, Putnam, Rabun, Richmond, Stephens, Talbot, Taliaferro, Towns, Troup, Union, Upson (part with area code 478), Walker, Warren, White, Whitfield, and Wilkes\n\n\n"}

Since World War II, public access to the White House grounds has been increasingly restricted. During the mid-1990s, the fence was expanded by one block to move traffic farther from the White House to prevent damage from any car bomb.

{"id": "2122738", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2122738", "title": "Russell Conwell", "text": "Russell Conwell\n\nRussell Herman Conwell (February 15, 1843 – December 6, 1925) was an American Baptist minister, orator, philanthropist, lawyer, and writer. He is best remembered as the founder and first president of Temple University in Philadelphia, as the Pastor of The Baptist Temple, and for his inspirational lecture, \"Acres of Diamonds\". He was born in South Worthington, Massachusetts.\n\nThe son of Massachusetts farmers, Conwell left home to attend the Wilbraham Wesleyan Academy and later Yale University. In 1862, before graduating from Yale, he enlisted in the Union Army during the American Civil War. Conwell desired to enlist in the war effort shortly after its outbreak in 1861, but could not initially gain the approval of his father, Martin Conwell. His abolitionist father ultimately changed his mind, allowing Conwell to enlist in Company \"F\" of the 27th Massachusetts Volunteers, better known as the \"Mountain Boys\". Conwell and the Mountain Boys served in North Carolina and first engaged the enemy at Kinston, North Carolina. There Conwell gained a reputation for self-sacrifice.\n\nDuring the \"Gum Swamp\" expedition, he returned to the battlefield to retrieve the bodies of two of his deceased soldiers, and later during the same campaign purposefully drew enemy fire upon his position – resulting in his being shot in the shoulder – in order to gain a tactical advantage on his Confederate adversaries. On September 25, 1862 he was commissioned as a captain (to rank from September 9, 1862) and placed in command of Company F of the 46th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment. He was mustered out of service, along with his regiment, on July 29, 1863.\n\nAfter his nine-month enlistment, Conwell returned home to Massachusetts to convalesce after contracting a dangerous fever that plagued him throughout the summer of 1863. Upon regaining health, he volunteered for a three-year enlistment in the Second Massachusetts Artillery and was commissioned as a captain in command of Company D on September 9, 1863. He then returned to North Carolina and was placed in command of a fort in Newport Barracks. After his soldiers there had not been paid for three months, Conwell requested and received permission to travel to Newberne to secure remuneration for his men. While he gained permission to cross enemy lines, he did not secure a permit to be absent from this post, nor did it appear that the 21-year-old Conwell understood the distinction. Twenty miles into his trip, Conwell learned that Confederate forces attacked and overran his company's position. When subsequently reported that the absence of Union officers contributed to the loss, Conwell was placed under arrest and detained in Newberne pending an investigation. It is for this incident Conwell has been accused of desertion by his detractors. Conwell was mustered out of the 2nd Massachusetts Heavy Artillery on May 20, 1864. While he claimed that he was later reinstated by General James B. McPherson, no military records confirm his statement.\n\nTwo months into his detention, and prior to the completion of the investigation, Conwell was assigned to Nashville, Tennessee, in June 1864 to join General MacPherson's movement against Atlanta. During the battle of Kennesaw Mountain, now Lieutenant-Colonel Conwell's arm and shoulder were broken during battle from an exploding artillery shell. While recovering from this injury, the atheist Conwell converted to Christianity in large part due to the heroism exhibited by his loyal private assistant, John H. Ring.\n\nUpon recovering from this latest injury, Colonel Conwell was assigned to Washington with a dispatch to General Logan. But Conwell's health compelled him to resign and retire from service, whereupon he received an honorable discharge, as well as a certificate for faithful and patriotic service from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.\n\nAfter the Civil War, Conwell studied law at the Albany Law School. Over the next several years, he worked as an attorney, journalist, and lecturer first in Minneapolis, then in Boston. Additionally, during this period, he published about 10 books, including campaign biographies of Ulysses S. Grant, Rutherford B. Hayes, and James A. Garfield. In 1880, he was ordained as a Baptist minister and took over a congregation in Lexington, Massachusetts.\n\nAlexander Reed, a leader of the Grace Baptist Church of Philadelphia, had heard Conwell preach when he visited him at Lexington, Massachusetts, and recommended that Conwell become a pastor for his congregation. The official \"call\" was made on October 16, 1882.\n\nConwell first preached there in the lower room of the basement, later deemed the Lecture Room, because the Upper Main Audience Room was yet unfinished. The church building was later dedicated by Conwell on December 3, 1882.\n\nThe December 4, 1882 issue of \"The Public Ledger\" reported the following about the new minister and church:\nConwell ended evening services by holding an hour of prayer, leading song services, and giving commentary relevant to his sermons. The musical pastor often performed a solo piece during evening services.\n\nReverend Conwell was known to share an anecdote that during this time, he was asked to officiate at the funeral of a young girl named Hattie May Wyatt. She had lived near a church where the Sunday School was very crowded, and wanted to help the church raise funds to expand. When she passed away from diphtheria, she had saved 57 cents to contribute to the cause. The girl's mother told Reverend Conwell that Hattie May had been saving money to help build a bigger church and gave him the little purse. Reverend Conwell had the 57 cents turned into 57 pennies, told the congregation the story of little Hattie May, and sold the pennies for a return of about $250. In addition, 54 of the 57 pennies were returned to Reverend Conwell, and he later put them up on display.\n\nOn June 28, 1886, a nearby house at the corner of Broad and Berks streets, referred to as The Temple because the property owner did not want the house to be called a church until the mortgage was fully paid, was investigated for purchase by the Wiatt Mite Society, which was organized for the purpose of taking the 57 cents and enlarging on them sufficiently to buy the property for the Primary Department of the Sunday school. A few days later, the congregation agreed to purchase the lot. The first payment for the lot was the 57 cents. The property was conveyed to the church on January 31, 1887. In that same house, the first classes of Temple College, later Temple University, were held. The house was later sold to allow Temple College to move and the Baptist Temple (now the Temple Performing Arts Center) to grow, and still more of that money went towards founding the Samaritan Hospital. This story so touched Conwell that he repeated it many times.\n\nIn September 1887, at the Centennial celebration of the United States Constitution, money received from the Wiatt Mite Society was given \"for the success of the new Temple\". This was the first time the name \"Temple\" was used in place of the church name.\n\nIn 1888, the youth group considered becoming a worldwide organization. The pastor was a speaker at a Christian Endeavor convention. Conwell was very impressed by the purpose and enthusiasm of the group. He later recommended the Christian Endeavor to the youth group of the church. On September 10, 1888, the Society of Christian Endeavor was finally organized. The Christian Endeavor youth groups continued to meet at the Church until the 1960s.\n\nCharles M. Davis, a young deacon, approached the pastor with his desire to preach; however, Davis had little education and was without sufficient funds to continue his studies. Conwell agreed to tutor him. Over the next few days, seven prospective students met with Conwell, and Temple College was conceived. Ultimately, Conwell became Dr. Conwell, president of the college, now known as Temple University.\n\nAs the membership continued to grow to over one thousand and the Sunday School to even greater numbers, a larger facility was needed. Consequently, on March 29, 1889, a contract was negotiated to build the new church. The ground was broken for the new building on March 27, 1889, and the cornerstone was laid on July 13, 1889.\n\nOn February 15, 1891, Conwell preached his last sermon in the old church at Marvine and Berks Streets. He preached the first sermon at the new building on March 1. Sixty people were baptized in the afternoon, and several addresses were given. The Rev. L. B. Hartman, the first minister, was present. The celebration continued throughout the week, and the church was filled to capacity for all of its services. The new church later became known as The Baptist Temple.\n\nThe congregation of the church continues today as the Grace Baptist Church.\n\nThe original inspiration for \"Acres of Diamonds\", his most famous essay, occurred in 1869 when Conwell was traveling in the Middle East. The work began as a speech, \"at first given,\" wrote Conwell in 1913, \"before a reunion of my old comrades of the Forty-sixth Massachusetts Regiment, which served in the Civil War and in which I was captain.\" It was delivered as a lecture on the Chautauqua circuit prior to his becoming pastor of the Grace Baptist Church in Philadelphia in 1882 and was first published in book form in 1890 by the John Y. Huber Company of Philadelphia. Before his death in 1925, Conwell would deliver it over 6,152 times around the world.\n\nThe central idea of the work is that one need not look elsewhere for opportunity, achievement, or fortune; the resources to achieve all good things are present in one's own community. This theme is developed by an introductory anecdote, credited by Conwell to an Arab guide, about a man who wanted to find diamonds so badly that he sold his property and went off in futile search for them. The new owner of his home discovered that a rich diamond mine was located right there on the property. Conwell elaborates on the theme through examples of success, genius, service, or other virtues involving ordinary Americans contemporary to his audience: \"dig in your own backyard!\"\n\nIn \"A People's History of the United States\", historian Howard Zinn comments that the message was that anyone could get rich if he tried hard enough, while implying that Conwell held elitist attitudes by quoting the following from his speech:\n\nConwell's capacity to establish Temple University and his other civic projects largely derived from the income that he earned from this speech. The book has been regarded as a classic of New Thought literature since the 1870s. After Conwell's death, proceeds from this speech were dedicated to the Sunday Breakfast Association, a homeless shelter in Philadelphia.\n\nOther works by Conwell include:\n\nConwell's name lives on in the present-day Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary, in South Hamilton, Massachusetts, an interdenominational evangelical theological seminary formed in 1969 by the merging of two former divinity schools, Conwell School of Theology of Temple University in Philadelphia and Gordon Divinity School in Wenham, Massachusetts.\n\nRussell Conwell Middle Magnet School in Philadelphia bears his name as well. The school yearbook is entitled \"Acres of Diamonds\". Temple University's football team wear diamond decals on their helmets and diamond trim on their collars to reference Conwell's \"Acre of Diamonds\" speech.\n\nThe film \"Johnny Ring and the Captain's Sword\" (1921) is based upon Conwell's writings regarding his experiences in the Civil War.\n\nThe elementary school in Worthington, Massachusetts, his home town, bears his name.\n\n"}

It grows on plants and their fruit, but also environmental objects, like fences, garden furniture, stones, even cars. The mold benefits from either a sugary exudate produced by the plant or fruit, or if the plant is infested by honeydew-secreting insects or sap suckers. \n\nSooty mold itself does little if any harm to the plant. Treatment is indicated when the mold is combined with insect infestation.\n\nSooty mold is a collective, self-descriptive term for a number of different fungi; it is a black, powdery coating adhering to plants and their fruit or environmental objects. \nThe ecology of the different species, their interactions, relationship to the host have been little understood. A chance observation of a Microcyclospora tardicrescens inhibiting the growth of the fruit pathogen \"Colletotrichum fioriniae\" in dual culture tests, yielded trichothecolone acetate and its (S)-7-hydroxy derivative as active principles for the interaction between \"M. tardicrescens\" and \"C. fioriniae\". \n\nGenera causing sooty molds are \"Alternaria\", \"Cladosporium\", \"Aureobasidium\", \"Antennariella\", \"Limacinula\", \"Scorias\", \"Meliola\", and \"Capnodium\".\n\nSooty mold grows particularly well on plants that produce a sugary exudate, if they are infested by honeydew secreting insects such as aphids, scales and the whitefly, or when infested by insects that suck sap from the host plant.\n\nSooty mold is commonly seen on the leaves of ornamental plants such as azaleas, gardenias, camellias, crepe myrtles, Mangifera and laurels. Karuka is affected by sooty mold caused by \"Meliola juttingii\". Plants located under pecan or hickory trees are particularly susceptible to sooty mold, because honeydew-secreting insects often inhabit these trees. The honeydew can rain down on neighboring and understory plants. Occasionally citrus may exude sweet sticky secretions and sooty molds can grow on these.\n\nThe fungus itself does little harm to the plant; it merely blocks sunlight, and very rarely may stunt a plant's growth and yellow its foliage. Thus, sooty mold is essentially a cosmetic problem in the garden, as it is unsightly and can coat most of a plant in a matter of days or weeks. \n\nThe simplest form of non-chemical control is to wipe and wash affected plant parts with lukewarm water and soap, insecticidal soap or dish soap, one tablespoon per gallon of water; strong soaps or detergents may damage the plant. This can also be sprayed if the plant is large but is much less effective than when combined with physical removal. After allowing the soap to sit for a while the sooty mold is rinsed off with a hose/ water. Sooty mold will regrow, unless the underlying reason for its growth is eliminated. \n\nChemical control of sooty mold itself is not needed. If sap-sucking pests are responsible for the honeydew on which the mold is growing, there are several options:\n\nUsing formulations of neem oil, which is an organic broad spectrum pesticide, insecticide, fungicide and miticide controls mites and insects such as whitefly, aphid, scale, and mealy bugs, and additional fungus diseases like black spot, rust, mildew, and scab. Neem oil can be used on house plants, flowers, vegetables, trees, shrubs and fruit indoors and outdoors. Neem oil is biodegradable and has not been shown to be toxic to mammals, birds, bees, earthworms, or beneficial insects.\n\nSynthetic insecticides such as the organophosphates acephate (orthene), malathion, or diazinon can be used in severe cases but read the labels for approved crops and the number of days to wait to harvest.\n\n"}

Released on July 27, 1981, the album reached number one on the US \"Billboard\" 200 in September of that year. \"Bella Donna\" was awarded platinum status by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on October 7, 1981, less than three months after its release, and in 2004 was certified quadruple-platinum. \"Bella Donna\" spent nearly three years on the \"Billboard\" 200 from July 1981 to June 1984. The album has sold over 4 million copies in the US alone with approximately a million copies since 1991 in the US according to Nielsen Soundscan. It is Nicks' best-selling album to date.\n\nThe album spawned four substantial hit singles during 1981 and 1982: the Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers-penned duet \"Stop Draggin' My Heart Around\" (#3), the Don Henley duet \"Leather and Lace\" (#6), her signature song \"Edge of Seventeen\" (#11) and country-tinged \"After the Glitter Fades\" (#32). Nicks was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame for the second time in 2019 on the strength of this album.\n\n\"Bella Donna\" would mark the beginning of Nicks' trend of calling upon her many musician friends and connections to fully realize her sparse demo recordings. Along with friends Tom Petty and Don Henley, Nicks brought in session musician Waddy Wachtel, Bruce Springsteen's E-Street Band pianist Roy Bittan, and Stax session man Donald \"Duck\" Dunn of Booker T. & the MGs. Though \"Bella Donna\"s personnel list includes some 20 musicians, the album is very much Nicks' own work, with all but one of the songs on the record written by her. The album also marked the first recording featuring Nicks' backing vocalists, Sharon Celani and Lori Perry, who still record and tour with Nicks today.\n\nThe album was also included in the \"Greatest of All Time \"Billboard\" 200 Albums\" chart.\n\nNicks began work on \"Bella Donna\" in 1979, in between sessions for her third album as part of Fleetwood Mac, \"Tusk\", released in October that year. Nicks recorded various demo versions of songs early and mid-1980 but these recordings were not used on the album. Following the end of the \"Tusk\" tour on September 1, 1980, work with a full band of other musicians commenced under producer Jimmy Iovine.\n\nRecording sessions continued until the spring of 1981 when the final songs for the album were completed: \"Edge of Seventeen\" and \"Stop Draggin' My Heart Around\". The 10-song, 42-minute album \"Bella Donna\" was released in the summer of 1981. A number of finished songs did not make it on the album, including \"Blue Lamp\", which was released instead on the \"Heavy Metal\" soundtrack later in 1981, and \"Sleeping Angel\", released on the \"Fast Times at Ridgemont High\" soundtrack in 1982. These two songs were included on Nicks' \"Enchanted\" boxed set in 1998, along with another unused \"Bella Donna\" session song, \"Gold and Braid\". Three more songs from these sessions, \"If You Were My Love\", \"Belle Fleur\" and \"The Dealer,\" were finally released on Nicks' 2014 album \"\".\n\nOn her \"Enchanted\" boxed set release in 1998, remastered versions of some \"Bella Donna\" tracks ran noticeably longer in some instances, notably \"Leather And Lace\".\n\nVideo footage of the album sessions can be found on the DVD portion of Nicks' 2007 retrospective release \"Crystal Visions – The Very Best of Stevie Nicks\".\n\nRhino released an expanded version of \"Bella Donna\" on November 4, 2016. This includes three discs. The first disc is the remastered original album. The second disc includes outtakes, alternative versions, demos and more. The third disc consists of live tracks from Nicks' \"White Wing Dove\" tour 1981, recorded at the Fox Wilshire Theatre in Los Angeles, California on December 13, 1981.\n\n(*) denotes previously unreleased\nBand\n\nAdditional musicians\n\nTour Band (2016 Deluxe Edition Disc 3)\n\nPhotography\n\nProduction\n\nNicks underwent a short national tour in support of the album, starting on November 28, 1981 and finishing on December 13, 1981. The final night at The Wilshire Fox Theatre in Beverly Hills was recorded by HBO for a television special and later released on VHS and Laser Disc video in many territories by CBS/Fox in 1982 as \"White Wing Dove – Stevie Nicks in Concert\". The whole show was recorded, but only 9 tracks (\"Gold Dust Woman\", \"Gold And Braid\", \"I Need to Know\", an edited \"Outside The Rain\", \"Dreams\", \"Stop Draggin' My Heart Around\", \"Sara\", \"Edge of Seventeen\" and \"Rhiannon\") were shown on the TV special and released to video. \n\nThe live performance of \"Leather And Lace\" was, however, used as a video promo for the single release (even though it was a solo version and did not feature Don Henley), and did surface on the 1986 VHS collection \"I Can't Wait\", which featured six of Nicks' promo-clips between 1981 and 1985. These six promos were released on DVD as a special feature to the Australian issue of \"Fleetwood Mac – Mirage Tour\" in 2007.\n\nOn the 2016 Bella Donna Deluxe Edition, 14 tracks from the show - the ten aforementioned songs as well as \"Angel\", \"After the Glitter Fades\", \"Bella Donna\", and \"How Still My Love\" - were remastered and released (Disc 3), with \"Outside the Rain\" being restored to its full version. Previously, only two tracks (\"Edge of Seventeen\" and \"Gold And Braid\") were found on the 1998 boxset \"The Enchanted Works of Stevie Nicks\". \"Blue Lamp\" and \"Think About It\" were recorded and received audio broadcast on radio but were not televised, and as such have never been officially released.\n\nNicks' 2007 retrospective \"Crystal Visions – The Very Best of Stevie Nicks\" included the full live 1981 clip of \"Edge of Seventeen\" on the DVD supplement, with optional commentary from Nicks. She admits that her tears at the end of the song were due to her thoughts of having to join Fleetwood Mac in France the following day to begin recording the \"Mirage\" album, one of the key reasons why the 1981 tour was so short.\n\nThe \"White Wing Dove\" performance remains unreleased in its entirety, although it has been circulating for many years amongst fans as a bootleg.\n\nTour set list\n\nTour dates\n\n"}

{"id": "2122783", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2122783", "title": "Pop Warner", "text": "Pop Warner\n\nGlenn Scobey Warner (April 5, 1871 – September 7, 1954), most commonly known as Pop Warner, was an American college football coach at various institutions who is responsible for several key aspects of the modern game. Included among his innovations are the single and double wing formations (precursors of the modern spread and shotgun formations), the three point stance and the body blocking technique. Fellow pioneer coach Amos Alonzo Stagg called Warner \"one of the excellent creators\". He was inducted as a coach into the College Football Hall of Fame as part of its inaugural class in 1951. He also contributed to a junior football program which became known as Pop Warner Little Scholars, a popular youth American football organization.\n\nIn the early 1900s, he created a premier football program at the Carlisle Indian Industrial School—a federally-funded, off-reservation Indian boarding school. He also coached teams to four national championships: Pittsburgh in 1915, 1916, and 1918 and Stanford in 1926. In all, he was head coach at the University of Georgia (1895–1896), Iowa Agricultural College and Model Farm (1895–1899), Cornell University (1897–1898 and 1904–1906), Carlisle (1899–1903 and 1907–1914), Pittsburgh (1915–1923), Stanford (1924–1932) and Temple University (1933–1938), compiling a career college football record of 319–106–32. Predating Bear Bryant, Eddie Robinson, and Joe Paterno, he once had the most wins of any coach in college football history.\n\nWarner was born April 5, 1871 on a farm in Springville, New York. He was the son of William Warner, a cavalry officer in the American Civil War, and schoolteacher Adaline Scobey. In 1878 a railroad came to Springville, and four years later the family moved to a house on East Main Street.\n\nPlump as a child, Warner was sometimes known as \"Butter\". He began playing baseball at an early age, and was a skilled pitcher. Nobody in town owned a football; his only exposure to the new sport at a young age was with an inflated cow's bladder, and as few knew the rules, the game more resembled soccer. Warner's East Main Street house attracted a number of friends; when a neighbor told his mother that the boys' play would damage her lawn, she replied: \"I'm raising boys, not grass\".\n\nIn 1889 at 19 years old Warner graduated from Springville-Griffith Institute and joined his family in moving down to Wichita Falls, Texas, to work on their new purchased cattle and wheat ranch totaling over hundreds of acres. Aside from ranching, Warner got a job assisting a tinsmith. He was already interested in art as a child — learning how to paint watercolor landscapes, and as a tinsmith he learned how to use tools to make things like cups, teapots, baking pans, and lanterns.\n\nIn 1892, Warner returned to Springville and began to use his cowboy experience to gamble on horse races. Although he had no interest in college, soon after coming back he attended Cornell Law School, as he lost all of his money at the races. Later Warner wrote \"I dare not write to my father and tell him I was broke\" — he felt that the only way to get funds was to inform his father that he decided to study law. His father, who had always wanted him to be a lawyer, sent him $100 (approximately $2,500 in 2016).\n\nEventually, Warner became known as \"Pop\" because he was one of the oldest students at Cornell. Warner graduated from Cornell in 1894 and began working as an attorney in Buffalo, New York. This job only lasted for a few months.\n\nOn Warner's train ride to Ithaca (the site of Cornell), he met Carl Johanson, then Cornell's football coach, who was impressed by Warner's weight (200 pounds). Johanson practically ordered Warner to attend practice. This happened even though Warner admitted that he had never handled a real football.\n\nDespite his commitment to football, at the time Warner's true passion was baseball. During one of his first practices at Cornell he badly injured his shoulder and never played serious baseball again. Warner also participated in track and field and was the school's heavyweight boxing champion for two years.\n\nDuring his three years at Cornell, Warner played as a guard on the football team. Even though he graduated in the spring of 1894, he returned as a post-graduate and was named captain of the 1894 team, which had a 6–4–1 record.\n\nDue to the then-tradition of alumni coming back to assist their undergraduate teams in rivalry games, Cornell's coach Marshall Newell left for several weeks to assist Harvard in its rivalry game with Yale. As a captain, Warner was put in charge during the coach's absence. It was during this time that Warner came up with his first original play: Three backs who normally protected the rusher would fake a run to one side, while the quarterback kept the ball and would hand it to the runner, who now had an open field to run through on the other side. During the first, in-game execution of the play, Warner carried the ball and was able to run clear for 25 yards. However, as Warner was a guard and not a runner, he was incorrectly holding the ball, and fumbled upon being tackled.\n\nIn the spring of 1895, Warner was asked for a reference to fill the vacant head coaching position at Iowa Agricultural College, in Ames, Iowa. Instead of giving a reference, Warner himself applied for the job and received an offer for $25 (approximately $670 in 2016) a week. At the same time, he decided to apply to other schools and received an offer of $34 (approximately $915 in 2016) per week from the University of Georgia in Athens, Georgia. Because Iowa State began its season in August—almost one and a half months prior to the beginning in Georgia, Warner was able to work out a deal. For $150 (approximately $4,000 in 2016), he would coach in Iowa from August until the second week of September; and then head to Georgia and begin coaching there.\n\nUltimately, not only did Warner end up coaching at Iowa State before his time at Georgia; but while in Athens, he also received weekly updates from Iowa and sent back telegraphs with detailed advice for the following week. One story recounts that in the middle of September (just before leaving for Georgia), Warner took his team north west for a previously agreed-upon game against the Butte Athletic Club of Butte, Montana. Apparently overconfident, Warner bet the entire sum of his Iowa State wages — $150 (approximately $4,000 in 2016), on his team's victory. At halftime, his team trailed 10–2 against a clearly superior team. Warner decided to enter the game, filling in at the guard position. Though this had a positive impact, it was not sufficient as his team still lost 12–10. In order to try and make up for losing all of his Iowa State wages, Warner worked out a deal where, for $30 (approximately $800 in 2016), he would stay in contact with Iowa State while at Georgia.\n\nSoon after Warner left for Georgia, Iowa State had its first official college game of the season. In Evanston, just north of Chicago, underdog Iowa State defeated Northwestern 36–0. A \"Chicago Tribune\" headline read, \"Struck by a Cyclone\". Since then, Iowa State teams have been known as the Cyclones. The team finished with three wins and three losses and, like Georgia, retained Warner for the following season. In 1896, Iowa State had eight wins and two losses. Despite leaving Georgia for Cornell in 1897, Warner remained head coach at Iowa State for another three years, posting winning records.\n\nIn Warner's first season at Georgia, he was hired at a salary of $34 per week. The school was a charter member of the Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association (SIAA), the first athletic conference in the South. The football team had three wins and four losses, including a loss to North Carolina from a not-yet-legal forward pass. He was rehired at a salary of $40 per week, and the next season Georgia had one of the school's first great teams. With an undefeated record, the team won its first conference title. It also avenged the loss to North Carolina, winning 24–16, \"For the first time in Southern football history the football supremacy of Virginia and North Carolina was successfully challenged.\"\n\nDuring those two years Warner also played two games against John Heisman, another future coaching legend. Heisman was the head coach at Auburn University, and they faced each other in the 1895 and 1896 games of the \"Deep South's Oldest Rivalry,\" an annual confrontation which has continued to the present day. In 1895, the Auburn Tigers defeated the Bulldogs 12–6. The Auburn team was led by quarterback Reynolds \"Tick\" Tichenor, known for his punt returns. Tichenor had executed the first \"hidden-ball trick\" in an earlier Auburn game against Vanderbilt, and used it again against Georgia. The next year, Tichenor faced Georgia's Richard Von Albade Gammon, a star quarterback in his first year under Warner. Both quarterbacks played well and, unlike the previous year, Warner's team won 16–6. The second touchdown came right after the first onside kick in the South.\n\nAfter Georgia's outstanding 1896 performance, Warner returned to his \"alma mater\" Cornell at twice his Georgia salary. While remaining head coach at Iowa State, he coached Cornell to records of 5–3–1 in 1897 and 10–2 in 1898; in the latter season, Cornell outscored its opponents 296–29. Despite its 1898 success, tension existed within the team, as its assistant coach (backed by a large proportion of the players) lobbied to replace Warner. Acknowledging an issue with his leadership, Warner resigned.\n\nIn 1904, after five years at Carlisle (see below), Warner returned to Cornell but his 1904 team featuring Clemson transfer James Lynah was little improved over the previous year. The following two years were better, with the 1905 team losing to undefeated champion Penn by one point. Their game next year was a scoreless tie, and Cornell lost only one game that season (to Princeton).\n\nAfter leaving Cornell the first time, Warner became head coach of the football team at Carlisle Indian Industrial School in 1899, a flagship Indian boarding school founded to teach children and young men skills to advance in American society. Its late-nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century football teams were nationally prominent, and Warner was paid $1,200 (approximately $33,000 in 2016), an exceptionally high salary for a coach at the time.\n\nHis previous Cornell team once faced Carlisle, and he was impressed by his opponent's approach to the game. Since the players were outweighed by every other team in the nation, they relied on speed and agility instead of size and physical force. Despite those strengths, Cornell won the game 23 to 6. The referee was a former Cornell graduate and was accused of helping out Cornell during the game. After the match, and in addressing the journalists, Warner acknowledged that there was assistance from the referee. He stated that \"We outscored 'em but we didn't defeat 'em, if you follow me.\" It has been said that after that game he considered Carlisle to be the future of college football.\n\nThe head coach dealt with young players who differed from the white, East-Coast students with whom he had previously worked. At the beginning, he used the then-customary coaching methods of rough language and a strict routine. The Native American students were unaccustomed to such an approach, and several key players stopped attending practices. Warner adjusted his technique, saying that he \"found I could get better results. I don't think I ever swore at a player from that time. Maybe I did a little cussing, now and then, but never at players.\"\n\nHis coaching brought immediate improvement. In 1897 and 1898, the Carlisle teams had 6–4 records. In 1899 (Warner's first year), Carlisle won nine and lost two games—to the country's two best teams: Harvard and Princeton. That year saw Carlisle's first major victory, against one of the \"Big Four\" teams, beating Penn 16–5. At the end of the season, the school played Columbia at the Polo Grounds in New York City, a premier sports venue at the time, defeating them 42–0. The Columbia game was the first time that a crouching start, a form of what is now known as a three point stance, was used by the running backs. Before Warner's innovation, the stance for a back before the ball was snapped was bent forward with his feet well apart and his hands on his knees. Warner realized that if his players took a stance similar to the one taken by sprinters, the legs would be bent, the back leaning forward, with one hand on the ground and the other arm cocked back to the thigh/hip region. Like with sprinters, this similar stance maximized the speed of his players. Shortly after, it became the standard football stance for both backs and linemen.\n\nAt the end of 1899, Warner was appointed the school's athletic director and his salary more than doubled. A track-and-field program was started that year. Warner knew little about the sport; to prepare as coach he bought every book available and consulted Jack Moakley and Mike Murphy, two of the era's leading head coaches. The program was successful; running was a Native American tradition, and students from the Southwest were known for their stamina in long-distance races.\n\nWarner's next two years were less fruitful. The 1900 football team went 6–4–1, losing three games to the Big Four, and the 1901 season was a losing one, with Carlisle posting a 5–7–1 record. The following year, the team posted an improved 8–3 record, when Warner began implementing double (lateral) passes. Carlisle's quarterback Jimmy Johnson would make a lateral pass to the halfback running towards the sideline, bringing the defense with him as he tossed the ball back to the fast-running Johnson.\n\nIn 1902, Warner played one professional football game for the Syracuse Athletic Club during the first World Series of Football at Madison Square Garden. In the first professional indoor football game, Syracuse defeated the heavily favored New York team. During the series, Warner was seriously cut on the side of his head. Although he laughed it off at first, the injury turned out to be more serious and he was replaced with Blondy Wallace for the rest of the series. For the tournament, Warner and the other team members earned $23 (approximately $816 in 2016), although the expected share was $300 (approximately $8,000 in 2016) per player; it was a financial failure.\n\nCarlisle's 1903 season was a success, with only two losses. The 12–11 defeat by Harvard is known for the \"hunch-back\", or \"hidden-ball\", play which Warner learned from Heisman; he had a tailor sew elastic bands into the waists of several players' jerseys before the game so the play could be executed. It was used during a Harvard kickoff; when the ball was caught, Carlisle formed a circle around the returner and pushed the ball up the back of the player's (altered) jersey. Carlisle then broke the huddle and spread out in different directions. Each player except the returner (who had the hidden ball) pretended to carry the football. The ruse confused the Harvard players, who scrambled to find the ball carrier, and the returner (ignored, with both hands free) ran untouched into the end zone. Warner's next step was a brief return to Cornell.\n\nAfter three years at Cornell, Warner returned to Carlisle. He considered his second stint there his best. From 1907 to 1914, the team won ten or more games a season five times.\n\nDuring this time at Carlisle, Warner made several significant contributions to football offense, including the body block technique and the single- and double-wingback formations. Under Warner, Carlisle quarterback Frank Mount Pleasant and fullback Pete Hauser became two of the first regular spiral passers in football (the forward pass was legalized in 1906). In 1908 he introduced the technique of body blocking, instead of blocking with the shoulders.\n\nWarner considered the 1907 Carlisle team \"about as perfect a football machine as I ever sent on the field\". The team posted a 10–1 record, outscored opponents 267–62 and pioneered an elegant, high-speed passing game; it was one of the first teams to regularly throw the ball deep downfield. For the first time in 11 years, Carlisle defeated Harvard on the road 23–15. Carlisle also won 26–6 over Penn. In the second play of the Penn game, Hauser threw a 40-yard spiral pass, hitting his receiver in stride. At the time such a pass was stunning and unexpected, and is considered by one journalist to be an evolutionary step in the game. The 1907 season is known for Warner's first use of the single-wing formation, characterized by laterals, trap and counter runs, and passing.\n\nAccording to Sally Jenkins, in her Sports Illustrated article on Carlisle:To take advantage of the Indians' versatility Warner drew up a new offense ...\"the Carlisle formation,\" but later it would be known as the single wing. It was predicated on one small move: Warner shifted a halfback out wide, to outflank the opposing tackle, forming something that looked like a wing. It opened up a world of possibilities. The Indians could line up as if to punt – and then throw. No one would know whether they were going to run, pass or kick. For added measure Warner taught his quarterbacks to sprint out a few yards to their left or their right, buying more time to throw. The rest of the players flooded downfield and knocked down any opponent who might be able to intercept or bat away the pass.\n\nThe 1907 team included a young Jim Thorpe, considered one of the greatest athletes who ever lived. Thorpe weighed just , light for a football player. Warner played him as a substitute, encouraging him to put his time into track and field. By 1909, Warner had Thorpe competing in track and field and he won 14 events. In 1911, Thorpe began training for the upcoming Olympics, and won gold medals in the pentathlon and decathlon at the 1912 Olympic Games in Stockholm.\n\nCarlisle football had another standout year in 1911, posting an 11–1 record. Thorpe had grown to , big enough to be a starter. The team defeated Harvard 18–15, with Thorpe scoring all of Carlisle's field goals. Walter Camp selected Thorpe as a first-team All-American. According to one source, Thorpe was \"recognized as the greatest player of the year and a man whose kicking is likely to revolutionize the game\".\n\nWarner considered the 1912 team brilliant and adaptive, and experimented with new plays and formations. In its game against Army, Warner's team introduced a wrinkle to the wing-back system. According to Francis J. Powers, author of a book that concentrated on Warner's approach to football:\n\nWarner had both halfbacks close to the line and flanking the defensive tackles. That was the start of the double wingback offense, which enjoyed tremendous popularity until the T formation was modernized with the man in motion. The double wing became the most effective of all systems for effective forward passing since it permitted the quick release of four receivers down the field.\n\nCarlisle dominated the next two years, with the 1912 and 1913 teams losing only one game each. Warner's salary increased to $4,500 (approximately $107,000 in 2016) per season.\n\nIn January 1913 a newspaper article revealed that Thorpe had played minor league baseball in North Carolina in the summer of 1908 with the Rocky Mount Railroaders, causing the International Olympic Committee to rescind the gold medals that he had won in the decathlon and pentathlon in the 1912 Olympics (after Thorpe’s death the medals were posthumously reinstated). Warner denied that he knew about Thorpe playing baseball professionally, and he and Moses Friedman, the Carlisle superintendent, drafted a statement for Thorpe to sign in which Thorpe took all the blame onto himself. Steve Sheinkin, the author of Undefeated – Jim Thorpe and the Carlisle Indian School Football Team, characterizes Warner’s and Friedman’s behavior as “scrambling to save their own hides.”\n\n\"Thorpe had never tried to hide his participation in baseball. He’d told Superintendent Friedman before leaving campus in 1909, and had talked about it ever since coming back. 'I never made any secret about it.' Thorpe later said. 'I often told the boys, with the coaches listening, about things that happened while I was at Rocky Mount.' There’s simply no way Pop Warner didn’t know about Thorpe’s summer baseball. After all they’d accomplished together, all they’d been through, this was the moment Thorpe needed Warner the most. This was Warner’s chance to stand by Thorpe’s side. He didn’t do it. To Jim’s teammates, this was nothing less than a knife to the back.\" Gus Welch, one of Thorpe’s teammates, said, “Mr. Warner is a good football coach,” but a man with no principle.”\n\nIn 1914 there was an administrative change in Washington, with federal money considered better spent in the Midwest than on schools like Carlisle. Many students left, and this affected the team (which had a 5–10–1 record). After that season, Warner left Carlisle to become head coach at Pittsburgh.\n\nWhen Warner arrived at the University of Pittsburgh in 1915, the 128-year-old school was on a new campus with 3,900 students. He inherited a team in good shape, full of future All-Americans, and coached the Pittsburgh Panthers to their first undefeated season. Six of their eight games (all shutouts) were played at home on Forbes Field, including a 45–0 victory over Carlisle. Warner coached his Pitt teams to 29 straight victories, and is credited with three national championships (1915, 1916 and 1918). Coaching Pittsburgh from 1915 to 1923, he compiled a 60–12–4 record.\n\nAlthough the 1915 season was a success, the next year's team was one of the greatest of Warner's career. The Panthers were again undefeated and, like the previous year, six of the eight games were shutouts. Thirty-two of their 35 players were from Western Pennsylvania, near Pittsburgh. The team scored 255 points, conceding 25. Warner considered the team an improvement because its defense was more dominant than the previous year's. The Panthers were the consensus national champions, and Warner became recognized as one of football's greatest coaches.\nIn 1917 the United States entered World War I, and some players (including Andy Hastings and Jimmy Dehart) entered military service. Pittsburgh played an undefeated full season despite the war, although it was not awarded the national championship. Although the team lacked the previous year's punch, it dominated the opposition. A key aspect of its success was the opposing coaches' inability to address Warner's evolving strategies; according to Powers, \"His reverse plays were a mystery, although Pop always was willing to explain them in detail to any other coach\".\n\nFaculties had to step in to stop a decisive, postseason national championship game with John Heisman's undefeated Georgia Tech team. The game was postponed until the following season, giving Tech the 1917 national championship (the first for any Southern school). On November 23, 1918 the two teams played at Pittsburgh. At the stadium where the game was to be played, the locker rooms were next to each other, with only a thin wall separating the two teams prior to the game. Heisman was first to begin an inspirational speech and it was said that he passionately described both heroes of Ancient Greece as well as the tragedy of a soldier found in his armor among the ruins of Pompeii. Because of Georgia Tech's players silence the speech was crystal clear on the other side of the wall. Upon its finish Warner smiled and quietly told his players \"Okay, boys. There's the speech. Now go out and knock them off.\" Pittsburgh defeated Georgia Tech 32–0.\nThe 1918 season was cut short at the end of November due to the continuing effects of World War I and the influenza pandemic. Only five games were played, and the season's final game was in Cleveland against the Naval Reserve. Warner's first loss at Pitt, it was one of the most controversial games in school history. According to Warner and several reporters covering the game, Pitt was robbed by the officials. The referees said that the timekeeper's watch was broken, ended the first half before Pitt was able to score and allowed the Reserves extra time in the fourth quarter to pull ahead, 10–9. Although he refused to acknowledge the loss, Warner's 29-game winning streak came to an end. Moon Ducote kicked the 41-yard, game-winning field goal for the Naval Reserve, and Warner called him \"the greatest football player I ever saw\". Despite the loss, a number of selectors named the 4–1 1918 Panthers national champion. The team was led by freshman running back Tom Davies, who averaged 150 yards per game over his four-year career.\n\nThe 1919 season began with high expectations; World War I was over, and key players had returned from service. However, things did not go Warner's way; at the beginning of the season, problems with the offensive line and on the flanks became apparent. Their first defeat was at Syracuse, where the Orangemen won 20–3. The 1919 Panthers had six wins, two losses and one tie.\n\nThey were undefeated in 1920, with ties against Syracuse and undefeated Penn State. In 1921 the team's record dipped to 5–3–1, but Pitt made college football history on October 8, 1921. Harold W. Arlin announced the first live radio broadcast of a college football game in the United States from Forbes Field on KDKA, as the Panthers defeated West Virginia 21–13 in the annual Backyard Brawl.\n\nAlthough Warner announced before the 1922 season that he was leaving to take the head-coaching position at Stanford, he honored his contract and remained at Pitt through 1923. The 1922 team had an 8–2 record, and the season ended with the Panthers taking their first cross-country train trip to defeat Stanford 16–7 in Palo Alto (coached by two Pitt assistants, sent ahead by Warner). Andrew Kerr became head coach at Stanford during Warner's last two years at Pitt. Warner's final season was his worst at Pitt, as the Panthers stumbled to a 5–4 record in 1923. However, the Warner era ended on a high note with a 20–3 victory over Penn State on November 29.\n\nFootball on the Pacific Coast had been on the rise since the late 1910s. Early in 1922, Warner signed a contract with Stanford University in which he would begin coaching in 1924 (after his contract with Pitt expired). Health concerns, a significant pay raise and the rising status of Pacific Coast football made Warner make the big change. Years later, he wrote:I felt my health would be better on the Pacific coast. Weather conditions at Pittsburgh during the football season are rather disagreeable, and much of the late season work had to be done upon a field which was ankle deep in mud. At the close of every season I would be in poor physical condition, twice being rendered incapable of coaching while I recuperated in a hospital. Doctors advised me that the climate of the Pacific coast would be much better for a man of my age and in the work in which I was engaged.\n\nIn 1924, Warner began his nine-year tenure at Stanford University. When he began coaching, Stanford was one of nine teams in the Pacific Coast Conference (PCC). Warner inherited a notable squad from the previous year, including Ernie Nevers (whom Warner considered his greatest player) and All-American ends Ted Shipkey and Jim Lawson.\n\nA season highlight was the final game against Stanford's arch-rival California at California Memorial Stadium, the last game of the regular season. Before the game, both teams were undefeated and Stanford had not beaten California since 1905. Nevers did not play due to a broken ankle. Late in the game, California was leading 20–3; California coach Andy Smith, sure the game was over, began substituting regular players. Warner seized the opportunity to combine passing with the trick plays for which he was known (a fake reverse and a full spinner), and Stanford made a comeback. The game ended in a 20–20 tie.\n\nBecause the game was California's second tie, Stanford was chosen to play in the Rose Bowl on New Year's Day against the University of Notre Dame's Fighting Irish coached by Knute Rockne. Like Warner, Rockne is considered one of the greatest coaches in football history. According to journalist Allison Danzig, \"With the exception of Knute Rockne of Notre Dame, Pop Warner was the most publicized coach in football.\" The game was thus a test of two different and highly influential systems of football: \"the Warner system with the wing backs, unbalanced line and gigantic power [and the] Knute Rockne system with its rhythmic, dancing shift, lightning speed, balanced line and finely timed blocking\". Notre Dame's backfield was composed of the renowned Four Horsemen. Nevers played all 60 minutes of the game, and rushed for (more yardage than the Four Horsemen combined). Warner's offense moved the ball but was unable to score, and Notre Dame won 27–10.\n\nDuring the 1925 season, Stanford lost just one PCC game (to Washington); California was finally defeated, 27–7. It was the first year of a new rivalry, with coach Howard Jones and the University of Southern California (USC) team. In their first game, at the Los Angeles Memorial Colosseum, Stanford scored twice in the first half but had to hold off the charging Trojans in a 13–9 win. Because of the loss to Washington, Warner's team was not invited to the Rose Bowl.\n\nStanford won all its 1926 games, crushing California 41–7 and narrowly defeating USC 13–12. Warner's team was invited to the Rose Bowl to play Alabama. Like the game against the Fighting Irish, Stanford dominated but the result was a 7–7 tie. After the game, both teams were recognized as national champions by a number of publications.\n\nThe 1927 season was one of underachievement and ultimate success. Stanford lost its third game to non-conference St. Mary's College. Stanford's next loss was against non-conference Santa Clara. The game against USC was a 13-to-13 tie.\n\nHowever, that year, Stanford defeated California 13–6. The game included a bootleg play, the invention of which some credit to Warner. Powers stated that,\nStanford put the game on ice in the fourth period when Pop introduced the bootlegger play, which was to be widely copied and still is in use. On the original bootlegger, Warner made use of Biff Hoffman's tremendous hands. Hoffman would take the pass from center and then fake to another back. Keeping the ball, he would hide it behind him and run as though he had given it to a teammate. Sometimes defensive players would step out of Hoffman's path, thinking he was going to block. Hoffman \"bootlegged\" for the touchdown against California ...\n\nDespite the two losses, Stanford finished the season as PCC co-champion. They were invited to the 1928 Rose Bowl against Pitt, Warner's former team now coached by protégé Jock Sutherland. Warner broke his losing Rose Bowl streak, defeating Sutherland 7–6. The win was Warner's last appearance at the Rose Bowl.\n\nThe 1929 season is known for Warner's regular use of the hook and lateral, a play that involves a receiver who runs a curl pattern, catches a short pass and immediately laterals the ball to another receiver running a crossing route. According to the October 25, 1929 \"Stanford Daily\", \"The trickiness that Pop Warner made famous in his spin plays and passing is very evident ... The frosh have been drilling all week on fast, deceptive forward and lateral pass plays, and together with the reverses will have a widely varied attack\". That season brought Warner his second straight loss to Jones, with Stanford defeated by the Trojans 7–0. USC won the conference, and went to the Rose Bowl. Jones went on to win every year thereafter, including 1932, Warner's last season at Stanford. Because of the five consecutive defeats, Warner was severely criticized by Stanford alumni. In all, Warner and Jones played eight games; Jones won five, Warner two and one was a tie. Against Stanford's main rival, California, Warner won five games, tied three and lost one.\n\nWarner left Stanford for Temple University in Philadelphia, his final head-coaching job, after the 1932 season. He was paid $75,000 (approximately $1,300,000 in 2016) for five years, one of the largest salaries ever offered a coach at the time. The 1934 team was undefeated during the regular season, losing to Tulane in the first Sugar Bowl. A star of the game was Dave Smukler, whom Warner considered one of his great fullbacks.\n\nIn later years Warner said he regretted his decision to leave Stanford for Temple, and left because of concern about the school's changing funding priorities. The university leadership was planning to make Stanford primarily a graduate school; because of an increase in the number of junior colleges in California, the administration saw less need for undergraduate instruction at Stanford. Because fewer students were admitted, higher grade requirements for incoming students made admission more difficult and student athletes began enrolling at USC and California instead of Stanford. Warner soon realized that he had made the wrong decision; due to the economic effects of the Great Depression, the number of applicants to Stanford decreased significantly and athletes were again admitted. Temple upset the Florida Gators, coached by future Temple coach Josh Cody, 20–12 in Warner's last game.\n\nWhile coaching at Temple, Warner continued living in Palo Alto (where Stanford is located). After his 1938 retirement he was immediately recruited as an advisor to Dudley DeGroot, a center at Stanford and head coach at San Jose State University (near Palo Alto). Officially an advisor, Warner was immediately put in charge of the offense. According to Powers, \"DeGroot had been using a single back offense but Pop immediately changed to the double wing, much to the doubts of San Jose players. However, the formation began to click and San Jose not only enjoyed an undefeated season but was the highest scoring team in the nation.\" That year the San Jose State Spartans played against College of the Pacific, coached by Amos Alonzo Stagg. It was the first time the two coaches had met since 1907, when Warner was coaching Carlisle and defeated Stagg's University of Chicago 18–4. Warner and DeGroot's San Jose State defeated Stagg's Pacific Tigers, 39–0.\n\nWarner married the former Tibb Lorraine Smith in Springville on June 1, 1899. He smoked Turkish Trophy cigarettes and drank alcohol; his trainers were instructed to supply him with \"cough medicine\".\n\nWarner always enjoyed painting in watercolors. According to an art exhibition review in \"The Stanford Daily\", Warner relied on painting to put him through law school at Cornell. He also had a woodworking shop in his garage.\n\nHe retired from San Jose State (and coaching) in 1940. Warner died on September 7, 1954, at age 83 in Palo Alto from throat cancer. Tibb Warner died on November 4, 1961.\n\nFor his contributions to football, the American Football Coaches Association (AFCA) gave Warner its Amos Alonzo Stagg Award in 1948. His name is widely known for the Pop Warner Little Scholars program, which began in 1929 as the Junior Football Conference in Philadelphia to keep children busy and out of trouble. In 1934, soon after Warner joined Temple, he agreed to the program's renaming as the Pop Warner Conference. As of 2016, about 325,000 children between the ages of 5 and 16 are mentored.\n\nAndrew Kerr, who was an assistant to Warner at Pittsburgh and Stanford, said he considered Warner \"the greatest creative genius in American football.\" Morris Bishop, a Cornell professor of history, wrote that Warner \"caused more rule changes than all the other coaches combined.\"\n\nWarner invented the single and double wing formations, the three-point stance, and the modern body block technique. He introduced several plays, such as the trap run, the bootleg, the naked reverse, and the screen pass. He was among the first to use the huddle, to number plays, and to teach the spiral pass and spiral punt. He improved shoulder and thigh pads; and was the first to utilize adjustable fiber, rather than cotton. He also had his own helmet color-coding: red for backs and white for ends.\n\nWarner's coaching tree includes:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2122804", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2122804", "title": "List of proposed states of Australia", "text": "List of proposed states of Australia\n\nProposals for new Australian states have been numerous since the late 19th and early 20th centuries; however, to date, no states have been added to Australia since Federation in 1901. Many proposals have suggested an Aboriginal state which would resemble the Inuit territory of Nunavut in Canada, while others have suggested incorporating New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Fiji, East Timor and New Caledonia as new states. Other proposals suggest making the Northern Territory and/or Australian Capital Territory states.\n\nSection 124 of the Constitution of Australia provides for the establishment or admission of new states to the Federation. It may also increase, diminish, or otherwise alter the limits of a state, form new states by separating territory from an existing state, or join multiple states or parts of states, but in each case it must have the approval of the parliaments of the states in question.\n\nThere were proposals for new colonies in the 19th century that did not come about. North Australia was briefly a colony between February and December 1846. The Journal of the Royal Geographical Society published \"Considerations on the Political Geography and Geographical Nomenclature of Australia\" in 1838, in which the following divisions were proposed:\n\n\nThese proposed states were geometric divisions of the continent, and did not take into account soil fertility, aridity or population. This meant that central and western Australia were divided into several states, despite their low populations both then and now.\n\nThere was also a proposal in 1857 for the \"Seven United Provinces of Eastern Australia\" with separate provinces of Flinders Land, Leicharts (sic) Land (taken from the name of Ludwig Leichhardt) and Cooks Land in modern day Queensland (also named from James Cook).\n\nProposed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the state of Auralia (meaning \"land of gold\") would have comprised the Western Australian Goldfields, the western portion of the Nullarbor Plain and the port town of Esperance. Its capital would have been Kalgoorlie.\n\nHowever, the population in the modern region of Goldfields-Esperance is currently lower than that of the Northern Territory, and there is little evidence of recent support, although the idea of a state centred around Kalgoorlie was proposed in 2003.\n\nFrom 1927 to 1931, the Northern Territory was divided into Central Australia and North Australia, with the border at the 20th parallel south. Both territories were reincorporated as the Northern Territory at the end of this period.\n\nDuring the process of Portuguese decolonisation in East Timor in 1974, a political party was formed called ADITLA \"Associação Democrática para a Integração de Timor Leste na Austrália\" (Democratic Association for the Integration of East Timor into Australia) by local businessman Henrique Pereira. It found some support from the ethnic Chinese community, fearful of independence or integration with Indonesia but was disbanded when the Australian government rejected the idea in 1975.\n\nAlso known as the Illawarra Territory, this proposed new state would consist of the Illawarra region centred on Wollongong on the New South Wales south coast. Originally this idea arose after disagreements between local landowners and migrants from Sydney in the mid-19th century. However the idea has continued in various incarnations ever since with most movements proposing the state's capital be situated in \"Illawarra City\", or the amalgamation of the Shellharbour and Kiama local government areas.\n\nThis proposed state would take in the northern part of New South Wales from Taree to the Queensland Border, mainly in the north east, and excluding most of north west NSW.\n\nPapua New Guinea is physically closest of any country to geographically remote Australia, with some of the Torres Strait Islands just off the main island of the country. Its Southern part became an Australian colony in 1902, while its Northern part was seized by Australia from Germany in 1914 and administered as a \"C\" Mandate of the League of Nations from 1920. Both territories were amalgamated after Second World War into a single Australian colony. In 1953, the editor of the conservative \"Quadrant\" magazine, Professor James McAuley, wrote that the territory would be \"a coconut republic which would do little good for itself\", and advocated its \"perpetual union\" with Australia, with \"equal citizenship rights\", but this was rejected by the Australian government. Papua New Guinea was granted self-government and full independence in 1975.\n\nThis proposed colony resulted from a movement in the 1860s to create a new colony that incorporated the isolated western Victoria and south-eastern South Australia regions centred on Mount Gambier and Portland. A petition was presented to Queen Victoria, but was rejected.\n\nThere was a small movement in the 1940s to create a new state in south-east New South Wales and north-east Victoria. The proposed state would have reached from Batemans Bay on the coast to Kiandra in the Snowy Mountains, and as far south as Sale in Victoria. The proposed state capital was Bega. Despite calls from local advocacy groups for a Royal Commission into the idea, it was met with little success.\n\nSince 2000, proposals for reorganisation have continued to be put forward. For instance, in 2003, Bryan Pape suggested a reorganisation into about twenty states, each with Senate representation.\n\nRepublicanism, changing mineral wealth and tax distribution have been seen as reasons to revisit federation. Proposals include redivision between the local, state and federal levels of government, either consolidation or fragmentation. It has been argued that new technologies in service delivery are enablers of greater decentralisation or are a reason for greater efficiency in centralisation.\n\nThere are also supporters of an Aboriginal state, along the lines of Nunavut in Canada. The Aboriginal Provisional Government was established in 1990 for the purpose; Paul Coe sued the Commonwealth for Aboriginal sovereignty (\"Coe v Commonwealth\" [1979] HCA 68) and see Kevin Gilbert 'Treaty 88'. All advocated for an Aboriginal state. Agence France Presse (21 August 1998) claims Australia blocked a United Nations resolution calling for the self-determination of peoples, because it would have bolstered support for an Aboriginal state within Australia. Among those supporting such a state are the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation.\n\nSupporters of the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) believe the ACT, with a population only slightly less than that of Tasmania, is under-represented in the Australian Parliament. This movement is small and no prominent political figures have given it their support. Furthermore, the wording of s.125 of the Australian Constitution states that the ACT must remain a territory and cannot become a state.\n\nNew England is a region of New South Wales and a proposed state. Some supporters also propose a \"River-Eden\" state in the south of NSW.\n\nThere have been several proposals for New Zealand to become the seventh state of Australia. One proposal, suggested humorously by the Liberal Senator Ian Macdonald, is that New Zealand's North Island and South Island could become the seventh and eighth states of the Commonwealth. New Zealand was one of the colonies asked to join in the creation of the Commonwealth of Australia, even by the time the \"Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act\" 1900 (Imp) was enacted, that law still provided for New Zealand to be one of the potential states of Australia. As ties have grown closer, people have made proposals for a customs union, currency union and even a joint defence force. New Zealand and Australia enjoy close economic and political relations, mainly by way of the Trans-Tasman Travel Arrangement, Closer Economic Relations (CER) free trade agreement signed in 1983 and the Closer Defence Relations agreement signed in 1990. In 1989, former Prime Minister of New Zealand Sir Geoffrey Palmer said that New Zealand had \"gained most of the advantages of being a state of Australia without becoming one\". The two countries, along with the USA, are in ANZUS, but New Zealand's opposition to nuclear weapons has weakened this treaty.\n\nIn 1788, Arthur Phillip assumed the position of Governor of New South Wales, claiming New Zealand as part of New South Wales. In 1835 a group of Māori chiefs signed the \"Declaration of Independence\", which established New Zealand as a sovereign nation. A few years later the Treaty of Waitangi re-established British control of New Zealand. The Federal Council of Australasia was formed with members representing New Zealand, Victoria, Tasmania, South Australia and Fiji. Although it held no official power it was a step into the establishment of the Commonwealth of Australia.\n\nIn 1890, there was an informal meeting of members from the Australasian colonies, this was followed by the first National Australasian convention a year later. The New Zealand representatives stated it would be unlikely to join a federation with Australia at its foundation, but it would be interested in doing so at a later date. New Zealand's position was taken into account when the Constitution of Australia was written up. New Zealand did not join because of fears of racist laws towards the Māori from the treatment of the Australian Aboriginal people. Australia, in an attempt to sway New Zealand to join, gave Māori the right to vote in 1902, while Australian Aboriginal people did not fully gain the right to vote at national elections until 1962. In 1908 and 1912, Australia and New Zealand sent Australasians teams to the Olympic Games. New Zealand and Australian soldiers fought together in 1915 under the name ANZAC.\n\nAustralian academic Bob Catley wrote a book titled \"Waltzing with Matilda: should New Zealand join Australia?\", a book arguing that New Zealand should become one with Australia, which was described by New Zealand political commentator Colin James as \"a book for Australians\". In December 2006, an Australian Federal Parliamentary Committee recommended that Australia and New Zealand pursue a full union, or at least adopt a common ANZ currency and more common markets. The Committee found that \"while Australia and New Zealand are of course two sovereign nations, it seems... that the strong ties between the two countries – the economic, cultural, migration, defence, governmental and people-to-people linkages – suggest that an even closer relationship, including the possibility of union, is both desirable and realistic.\" This was despite the Australian Treasurer Peter Costello and New Zealand Minister of Finance Michael Cullen saying that a common currency was \"not on the agenda\".\n\nA 2010 UMR research poll asked 1000 people in Australia and New Zealand a series of questions relating to New Zealand's becoming the seventh state of Australia. One quarter of the people thought it was something to look into. Over 40% thought the idea was worth debating. More Australians than New Zealanders would support such a move.\n\nA leading factor for the proposal of New Zealand as a state of Australia is the major economic benefits it could bring. However, free trade and open borders now appear to be the maximum extent of public acceptance of the proposal. There are many family connections between the two nations, with around 500,000 New Zealanders living in Australia and 60,000 Australians living in New Zealand as of 2013. Peter Slipper, a former Member of Australia's Parliament, once said, \"It's about how can we improve the quality of living for people on both sides of the Tasman\" when referring to the proposal.\n\nConcerns have been expressed about the need for a common currency, about changes to the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty, and about the retention of the administrative and political recognition of the ancestral rights of the indigenous Maori population under the Treaty of Waitangi.\n\nA number of disparities that could lead to conflict including the current constitutions (written in Australia, unwritten in New Zealand), the status of political rights (constitutionally entrenched in Australia but not in New Zealand). Some New Zealanders feel they have established a national identity, one which they feel they may lose if they became part of Australia. Others argue New Zealand is too far away from the mainland of Australia.\n\nOne proposal is that Queensland should be divided by the 22nd parallel with the boundary running just south of Sarina on the coast to the Northern Territory border between Boulia and Mount Isa, and the capital would be Sellheim, near Charters Towers, to overcome rivalry between Mackay, Townsville and Cairns. The name Capricornia has been proposed for this state.\n\nAccording to \"The Courier-Mail\" in 2010, the majority of North Queensland Mayors were in favour of the separation from Queensland proper. Only two of the hundred delegates at the NQ Local Government Association meeting were against the proposal – the two being Mayor Val Schier (Cairns) and Mayor Ben Callcott (Charters Towers).\n\nPilbara and Kimberley are northern regions of Western Australia, some supporters propose that the two regions could create a new state called North West Australia or Pilbara Kimberley.\n\nThe Northern Territory (NT) is the most commonly mentioned potential seventh state. In a 1998 referendum, the voters of the Northern Territory rejected a statehood proposal that would have given the territory three Senators, rather than the twelve held by the other states, although the name \"Northern Territory\" would have been retained. With statehood rejected, it is likely that the Northern Territory will remain a territory for the near future, though former Chief Minister Clare Martin and the majority of Territorians are said to be in favour of statehood. The main argument against statehood has been the NT's relatively low population, and the fact that ordinarily, statehood would give the NT the same number of senators as every other state, despite the largest state New South Wales having over thirty times its population. This means that whilst one NSW senator represents more than 600,000 people, one NT senator would represent approximately 20,000.\n\nAn alternative name for the new state would be North Australia, which would be shared by two historic regions.\n\nThe matter was raised again in July 2015, with a further referendum in 2018 being mooted.\n\nRiverina is also a proposed state, in the River Murray region, on the border between New South Wales and Victoria. The Division of Riverina is currently a smaller area than traditional Riverina, which would include the Division of Farrer. Along with the ACT, it is one of the few landlocked proposed states.\n\n"}

It was built in the 1880s after the B&O lost access to its previous route to Philadelphia, the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad (PW&B). The cost of building the new route, especially the Howard Street Tunnel on the connecting Baltimore Belt Line, led to the B&O's first bankruptcy. Today, the line is used by CSX Transportation for freight trains.\n\nIn 1838, the B&O began service from Baltimore to Philadelphia using the new PW&B line. Connecting trackage in Baltimore ran from the B&O's Mount Clare terminal east along Pratt Street and East Falls Avenue to the PW&B's President Street Station. From there the PW&B ran east on Fleet Street and Boston Street before leaving onto its own right-of-way.\n\nIn 1881, the B&O attempted to gain control of the PW&B, but lost the stock battle to the Pennsylvania Railroad, which informed the B&O that it would lose access to the PW&B line in 1884. This forces the B&O to build a new route to Philadelphia. It acquired the Delaware Western Railroad, which had a charter but no track, merged it into the Baltimore & Philadelphia (called the Philadelphia Branch in Maryland) in 1883, and began construction. The line was in full operation by 1886.\n\nExcept at its two ends, the line was built within a few miles to the northwest of the PW&B. At the Baltimore end, the line ended in the Canton neighborhood, with a car ferry across the Patapsco River to Locust Point. At the Philadelphia end, the new line crossed the PW&B and its old alignment (part of the Philadelphia and Reading Railway's branch to Chester) and crossed to the east side of the Schuylkill River on the new B&O Railroad Bridge, just south of the Grays Ferry Bridge. A branch split there towards the Delaware River, while the main line continued north along the Schuylkill, with a station downtown, and then passed through the Art Museum Tunnel to Park Junction with the Philadelphia and Reading Railway's main line; this tunnel, the last part of the line to be finished, opened on December 15, 1886.\nThe Reading, originally using the Junction Railroad west of the Schuylkill to access its Chester branch, obtained trackage rights over the Baltimore and Philadelphia, and the B&O obtained trackage rights over the Reading's lines from Philadelphia to Jersey City, New Jersey, across the Hudson River from New York City. (This route via the Reading originally ran via the main line, Port Richmond Branch, North Pennsylvania Railroad, North Pennsylvania Railroad Delaware River Branch, Delaware and Bound Brook Railroad and Central Railroad of New Jersey, later using the shortcut of the Philadelphia, Newtown and New York Railroad and New York Short Line Railroad rather than the North Pennsylvania.) The Baltimore and New York Railway and Staten Island Rapid Transit Railway provided their own freight terminal, at St. George on Staten Island.\n\nThough a surface alignment through downtown Baltimore was authorized by the Maryland legislature, the B&O instead obtained a charter for the Baltimore Belt Line to provide a completely grade-separated route. This new route entered the long Howard Street Tunnel at Camden Station, running north under downtown, and then turning east through two shorter tunnels to a junction with the Philadelphia Branch at Bay View Yard. The Baltimore Belt Line was completed in 1895, and its expenses drove the B&O to bankruptcy in 1896.\n\nThe last passenger trains ran through the tunnel and over the Baltimore and Philadelphia in 1958; since then all traffic has been freight. The route is now operated by CSX as its Philadelphia Subdivision.\n\nfrom East Side Junction to wharves and yards along the Delaware River on the east side of Philadelphia.\nextending both north and south of a connection to the main line at Eddystone, Pennsylvania along Crum Creek. Served Leiper's quarry to the north and the Baldwin Locomotive Works to the south.\nfrom the east end of Wilsmere yard (later, from Elsmere Junction) into Wilmington, Delaware to a station at Market Street. Provided passenger and freight service from downtown Wilmington.\nfrom a junction on the Market Street Branch across the Christina River to Third Street Dock. Served industries on the south side of the river.\nfrom Landenberg Junction (at the west end of Wilsmere yard) to Landenberg, Pennsylvania. Later the Wilmington and Western Railroad.\nbuilt from Childs, Maryland to Providence, Maryland by the Lancaster, Cecil and Southern Railroad.

It is native to the Indian subcontinent and widespread as a cultivated plant throughout the Southeast Asian tropics.\n\n\"Tulsi\" is cultivated for religious and traditional medicine purposes, and for its essential oil. It is widely used as a herbal tea, commonly used in Ayurveda, and has a place within the Vaishnava tradition of Hinduism, in which devotees perform worship involving holy basil plants or leaves.\n\nThe variety of \"Ocimum tenuiflorum\" used in Thai cuisine is referred to as Thai holy basil ( \"kaphrao\"); it is not the same as Thai basil, which is a variety of \"Ocimum basilicum\".\n\nHoly basil is an erect, many-branched subshrub, tall with hairy stems. Leaves are green or purple; they are simple, petioled, with an ovate, up to -long blade which usually has a slightly toothed margin; they are strongly scented and have a decussate phyllotaxy. The purplish flowers are placed in close whorls on elongate racemes. \n\nThe three main morphotypes cultivated in India and Nepal are Ram tulsi (the most common type, with broad bright green leaves that are slightly sweet leaves), the less common purplish green-leaved (Krishna \"tulsi\") and the common wild \"vana tulsi\".\n\nDNA barcodes of various biogeographical isolates of tulsi from the Indian subcontinent are now available. In a large-scale phylogeographical study of this species conducted using chloroplast genome sequences, a group of researchers from Central University of Punjab, Bathinda, have found that this plant originates from North-Central India.\n\nTulsi leaves are part in the worship of Vishnu and his avatars and some other deities, including, Krishna and Rama, and other males Vaishnava deities, such as Hanuman and some brahmanas. \"Tulsi\" is a sacred plant for Hindus and is worshipped as the avatar of Lakshmi. Traditionally, \" tulsi\" is planted in the center of the central courtyard of Hindu houses or maybe grown next to Hanuman temples.\n\nThe ritual lighting of lamps each evening during \"Kartik\" includes the worship of the \"tulsi\" plant, which is held to be auspicious for the home. Vaishnavas traditionally use Hindu prayer beads made from tulsi stems or roots, which are an important symbol of initiation. They have such a strong association with Vaishnavas, that followers of Vishnu are known as \"those who bear the tulsi round the neck\".\n\nTulsi Vivah is ceremonial festival performed anytime between Prabodhini Ekadashi (the eleventh or twelfth lunar day of the bright fortnight of the Hindu month of Kartik) and Kartik Poornima (the full moon of the month). The day varies regionally.\n\n\"Tulsi\" (Sanskrit:-Surasa) has been used in Ayurveda and Siddha practices for its supposed treatment of diseases. Its benefit is to cure common cold.\n\nFor centuries, the dried leaves have been mixed with stored grains to repel insects.\n\nSome of the phytochemical constituents of \"tulsi\" are oleanolic acid, ursolic acid, rosmarinic acid, eugenol, carvacrol, linalool, β-caryophyllene (about 8%).\n\nTulsi essential oil consists mostly of eugenol (~70%) β-elemene (~11.0%), β-caryophyllene (~8%) and germacrene (~2%), with the balance being made up of various trace compounds, mostly terpenes.\n\nThe genome of the tulsi plant has been sequenced and reported as a draft, estimated to be 612 mega bases, with results showing genes for biosynthesis of anthocyanins in \"Shyama Tulsi\", ursolic acid and eugenol in \"Rama Tulsi\".\n\n"}

Both Charles Dickens and Mark Twain have described it as \"the most beautiful street in America.\" Much of the avenue is included in the Hillhouse Avenue Historic District, which extends to include houses on adjacent streets.\n\nThe avenue is named for James Hillhouse (1743–1832) (and his son James Abraham Hillhouse, 1789–1841), innovator in land use in New Haven, who began the program of tree planting that gave New Haven its nickname, \"The Elm City\", and who laid out the Trumbull Plan for Yale College and the Grove Street Cemetery.\n\nHillhouse Avenue was initially called Temple Avenue, and was staked out, wide, by Hillhouse employee, and later Yale president, Jeremiah Day, in 1792. The avenue ran from the Green at Temple Street to a hilltop location where James Abraham Hillhouse built the family mansion, \"Highwood\" (later called \"Sachem's Wood\"), in 1828. The houses along the wide avenue were set back with room for trees creating a park-like effect. The elms which once shaded the street were lost to Dutch Elm disease, but mature oak trees have largely taken their place.\n\nThe avenue was privately owned until 1862. Because of the nature of the street, its lots, and its orientation to the nine-square-grid of New Haven (the nation's first planned city), Hillhouse Avenue is sometimes considered to be the first suburb in the United States.\n\nThe Hillhouse mansion was razed in 1942 in accordance with a directive in the will of James Abraham Hillhouse's daughter, Isaphene. In time, Hillhouse Avenue came to be divided into an upper, residential area, and a lower portion for public buildings and the Farmington Canal. It is now just two blocks long, running from Grove to Sachem. The upper portion of the avenue, along with the adjacent blocks (and the Dana House), was designated the Hillhouse Avenue Historic District on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985.\n\nYale now owns all of the properties on Hillhouse Avenue except for St. Mary's Church and its parish house. Many of the mansions of the upper area have been converted for use by the economics department, Cowles Foundation, School of Management, and other academic departments, and have been completely restored. Lower Hillhouse primarily includes university buildings, a number of them formerly part of the Sheffield Scientific School. There are several houses designed by architects Ithiel Town, Henry Austin and Alexander Jackson Davis. The area at the end of the avenue where Hillhouse's mansion stood is now part of the Science Hill section of Yale's campus.\n\nNotable buildings on Hillhouse Avenue that are included in the historic district are:\nBuildings on lower Hillhouse Avenue, outside of the historic district, include:\n\nSignificant properties not on Hillhouse Avenue, but included in the historic district, include:\n\n\n\n"}

His illustrations appear on CD covers, magazines, newspapers, and print advertisements.\n\nWith Daniel Clowes, Pete Friedrich and Rick Altergott, Mort Todd contributed stories and art to \"Psycho Comics\". He sold his first screenplay for a TV pilot called \"The Ultimates\" to a German production company while still a teenager. The pilot was produced, but never distributed, and stars a young Clowes as a teen rock 'n' roll superhero. Mort also wrote and penciled some stories for Clowes' \"Lloyd Llewellyn\" series from Fantagraphics. Around then he started freelancing for DC Comics, Marvel Comics, Kitchen Sink, Myron Fass, and many other smaller publishers.\n\nSince 1984, he illustrated all eight volumes of Back From The Grave (Crypt Records), a compilation series of obscure proto-punk rock from the 1960s. The original art to the cover of Volume One is on permanent display at the Cornell University Punk Archive Collection.\n\nIn 1985, Todd became editor-in-chief of \"Cracked\" magazine. There he signed artist Don Martin after a 32-year career at \"Mad Magazine\". Todd also published some of the earliest mainstream work of Altergott, Clowes, and Peter Bagge.\n\nFor Globe Communications, Todd created the comics magazine \"Monsters Attack!\", which featured horror comics and articles about movies. It ran five issues (Sept. 1989 - Dec. 1990), with Todd involved with the first four.\n\nTodd launched the imprint AAA, which published the first authorized collection of Bill Ward's pin-ups in \"W.O.W. (World of Ward)\". AAA also published a bilingual humor comic called \"Pepito\" with stories by writer George Gladir.\n\nIn 1994, Todd launched a line of music comics called Marvel Music at Marvel Comics, working with such artists as Kiss, Rob Zombie, The Rolling Stones, KRS-One, and the estates of Elvis Presley and Bob Marley. Some of the talent working on these books included Neil Gaiman, Kyle Baker, Dan Barry, Severin, Colan, and Morrow.\n\nWhile at Marvel, Todd also edited a series of pre-Comics Code horror and giant monster reprints (\"Curse of the Weird\" and \"Monster Menace\"), and developed the oversized \"Comic Book\" by Ren & Stimpy-creator John Kricfalusi.\n\nIn 2005, Todd rejoined \"Cracked\" magazine, this time as a contributing editor, but left after several months.\n\nTodd has written and illustrated for the new \"Tales from the Crypt\" comic series, and completed new comic books featuring \"Lucy Hell, Devilgirl\", \"The Secret Society\", and the French/English language \"Mr. Krime\", the last written by Martyrs of Pop's Jean-Emmanuel Dubois.

{"id": "2122856", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2122856", "title": "Terconazole", "text": "Terconazole\n\nTerconazole is an antifungal drug used to treat vaginal yeast infection. It comes as a lotion or a suppository and disrupts the biosynthesis of fats in a yeast cell. It has a relatively broad spectrum compared to azole compounds but not triazole compounds. Testing shows that it is a suitable compound for prophylaxis for those that suffer from chronic vulvovaginal candidiasis.\n\nTerconazole is approved to treat vulvovaginal candidiasis (vaginal thrush). It works as a broad spectrum antifungal and has shown to be an effective first-line treatment against other \"Candida\" species. It also shows effectiveness against dermatomycoses in animal models.\n\nA review found that short-term rates for intravaginally administered azole treatments shows cure in 80% of cases in a short term follow-up and 66% over long term follow-up. In a double-blind study by Slavin in 1992, terconazole showed a 75% mycological cure over a short-term period (7–14 days) and 100% mycological cure over a long-term period (28–34 days). This study focused on the drug as an 80 mg vaginal suppository, taken three times overnight by 10 women. In another placebo-controlled, double blind study by Schmidt et al., the efficacy of different concentrations of terconazole creams were tested. Cream was applied for three days to 24 women between the ages of 18–60. The results showed 0.8% terconazole mycologic cure rates were 83.3% within 1–3 days of starting treatment, 83.3% within 8–11 days of treatment and 58.3% within 30–35 days of treatment. The suppository is more effective after a long-term follow-up than terconazole as a cream or other intravaginal treatments.\n\nThe most common side effects of terconazole include headaches, vulvar/vaginal irritation, rash, itching, burning or discomfort. Other side effects may include abdominal pain or cramps, dysmenorrhea, chills, fever and allergic reactions. Flu-like symptoms have been recorded in those that take suppositories greater than 160 mg. May cause birth defects if used in the first trimester.\n\nTerconazole is not considered hazardous when handled under normal conditions. It is generally non-flammable and non-carcinogenic. Generally is non-toxic, however, can emit toxic fumes when dust is set alight. Can cause respiratory distress as dust. Can be absorbed by embryo within the first trimester of pregnancy and cause birth defects. Cross inhibition shows that there may be some toxicity.\n\nTerconazole may interact with the spermicide nonoxynol-9. A precipitate is formed upon combination of both drugs. Terconazole may weaken latex-based condoms.\n\nTerconazole is a triazole ketal with broad-spectrum antifungal/antimycotic tendencies.\n\nTerconazole synthesis synologous with ketoconazole except for the fact that triazole and not imidazole heterocyclic ring is used, and that isopropyl group instead of acetamide.\n\nTerconazole has the chemical formula CHClNO. The chemical name for terconazole is 1-{[(2\"S\",4\"S\")-2-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-{[\"p\"-(4-isopropyl-1-piperazinyl)phenoxy]methyl}-1,3-dioxolan-2-yl]methyl}-1\"H\"-1,2,4-triazole. Terconazole has a melting point of 126.3 °C (259.34 °F). The molecular weight of terconazole is 532.462 g/mol. Terconazole is synthesized using two chemical compounds: \"cis\"-[2(bromomethyl)-2-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,3-dioxolan-4-yl] methyl benzoate and the sodium salt of triazole, created by mixing triazole with sodium hydride. These are put in a solution and catalyzed using dimethyl sulfate at 1300 °C (2372 °F) to give many different types of triazole derivatives. These are purified using alcohol and chromatography. Terconazole is non-reactive except when exposed to strong oxidizing agents or strong bases due to the nitrogen attached to the triazole ring. It has been found to be photosensitive.\n\nTerconazole binds to the heme iron component on the cytochrome P450 enzyme lanosterol of fungi, also known as CYP3A4. The gene ERG11 controls lanosterol creation. Lanosterol is found within the yeast plasma membrane. It is a class of methylsterol. Within a normal yeast cell, lanosterol is demethylated using 14α-demethylation. This process creates zymosterol: a major constituent in the ergosterol biosynthesis pathway for the creation of cell membrane constituents in yeast. This structure provides the membrane with fluidity. This occurs by transforming lanosterol into 4,4'-dimethyl cholesta-8,14,24-triene-3-β-ol. This stops respiration by prohibiting reduction of NADH to NAD. This stops biosynthesis of cell membrane products as well as transport and catabolism. Eventually, membrane fluidity and activity of membrane bound enzymes become depleted. It has also been shown to inhibit morphologic change of yeast as well as cell adherence and is directly toxic to yeast. Terconazole targets fungi specifically since humans do not use lanosterol in this pathway. This process does not affect all fungi such as \"Pneumocystis jirovecii\", which lacks lanosterol.\n\nAbsorption of terconazole is 5–8% in patients that have had a hysterectomy and 12–16% in other patients. In those that administered 0.8% terconazole, plasma concentrations of the drug remained quite low with the peak plasma concentration being 0.006 mcg at 6.6 hours. Those metabolism rates show similar results in pregnant vulvovaginal candidiasis, non-pregnant vulvovaginal candidiasis and healthy women. The half-life of terconazole in blood is recorded to be around 6.9 hours over a range of 4–11.3 hours). Radioactivity of plasma terconazole is low compared to terconazole at 0.6%. Excretion of radioactivity is via two routes, renal (32–53%) and fecal (47–52%). Metabolism is extensive and is highly protein bound (94.9%) with the degree of binding being independent of drug concentration.\n\nIn 1940, the first commercial antifungal drug, called amphotericin B, was available on the market, replacing rare and expensive treatments. It was effective in its function but was very toxic and only used for serious infections. The drug was infused into the bloodstream and could cause kidney damage and other side effects. The first azole compounds to replace this treatment were synthesized in the late 1960s and early 1970s and administered to humans under strict care. These compounds were imidazoles, a molecule containing two non-adjacent nitrogen atoms in a 5 membered ring. The first oral antimycotic imidazole, called ketoconazole, was available on the market in 1981. Triazole based drugs came shortly after and quickly gained popularity due to its broader spectrum of antifungal activity and less toxicity. Terconazole was the first triazole-based antifungal drug synthesized for human use. Janssen Pharmaceutica developed it in 1983. Previously, all triazole based drugs targeted fungal infections related to plants from \"Candida\" species. Since creation, terconazole has been superseded by second-generation triazoles due to their even broader spectrum and higher activity levels against resistant pathogens like \"Aspergillus spp.\" It is still used as a treatment in cases of resistance to other drugs.\n\nTerconazole is a white, odourless powder. It can be purchased commercially in the following forms:\n"}

The Thaksin government endorsed the candidacy of its own foreign minister, Surakiart Sathirathai, who ended up third choice behind Shashi Tharoor of India and Ban Ki-Moon of South Korea, the eventual winner. Following the 2006 military coup in Thailand, there was speculation that the military government would switch Thailand's candidate from Surakiart to Surin.\n\nOn 18 June 2007, the Thai cabinet unanimously endorsed the recommendation of the Thai Foreign Ministry that Surin Pitsuwan be nominated as the Thai candidate for Secretary-General of ASEAN. He was confirmed by the ASEAN Foreign Ministers during their 40th annual meeting in Manila in July 2007 and succeeded Ong Keng Yong from Singapore on 1 January 2008. His term of office was five years. \"The Economist\" magazine, commenting that most secretaries-general are \"usually a senior regional official rewarded with the post as the crowning boondoggle in a career of not rocking the boat\", states that Surin is different in that he seeks an activist role in member states. Surin Pitsuwan was the first ASEAN Secretary-General with significant political experience.\n\nOn 1 January 2013, he handed over his post to Le Luong Minh, the next ASEAN Secretary-General. On 17 January he announced that he would be ready to take over Thailand's education ministry \"if given the chance\".\n\nSurin's tenure at ASEAN saw the rise of the regional organization into an important global player in international affairs. \"He will be a hard act to follow\", said Professor Amitav Acharya of the American University in Washington D.C. Under Surin's stewardship, Acharya said, ASEAN moved away from the principle of \"non-interference in the internal affairs\" of member states that had been used by some to deflect criticisms of their human rights records, and the grouping succeeded in setting up its own Human Rights Commission. The change in direction followed Surin's advocacy of a policy of \"flexible engagement\" towards Myanmar when he was Foreign Minister from 1997 through 2000. The policy called for increasing interactions with Myanmar leaders when they took steps towards reform, and building people-to-people contacts between nations. Prior to that, ASEAN had been criticized by some for its policy of \"constructive engagement\", which detractors said was simply a cover for business persons to ignore government repression. Acharya said that Surin would be remembered for guiding the grouping through challenging times, including the opening up of Myanmar, the United States entry into the East Asia Summit, and rising tensions over the South China Sea. \"He was the most active, open and globalized ASEAN secretary-general ever\", he said. An editorial in the \"Jakarta Post\" lauded Surin as the most effective of the 12 secretary-generals in the group's history.\n\nSince 2003, he was a member of the board of trustees for The Asia Foundation.\n\nSince October 2013, Surin served as on the board of the Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue (HD), a private diplomacy organization whose mission is to prevent armed violence through mediation and dialogue.\n\nSurin was a member of the Commission on Human Security, a member of the Advisory Board of the International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty, and a member of the World Commission on the Social Dimension of Globalization.\n\nSurin's eldest son, Fuadi Pitsuwan, announced the formation of the Surin Pitsuwan Foundation in 2019. The foundation will focus on three areas: education, diplomacy, and human security. The foundation will provide scholarships to ASEAN students to study abroad, within and without the region, to spur ASEAN integration and encourage academic excellence. The foundation will fund diplomacy programs in interfaith dialogue and conflict resolution to further ASEAN integration. On human security, the foundation will assist in disaster relief and respond to development needs that will help secure the future of ASEAN's citizens.\n\nSurin died on 30 November 2017 of heart failure. He collapsed while preparing to address the Thailand Halal Assembly 2017 in Bangkok. He was 68.\n\n\n\n\n"}

A great number of Jews had reached Sicily after Pompey's 63 BC sacking of Jerusalem.\n\nAfter the enslavement under Roman rule, Jews in Sicily eventually assimilated into society, working in professions such as philosophy, medicine, artisanal pursuits, and farming.\n\nThe exact number of Jews in Sicily at the time of expulsion is not certain, However, some have put the number of Jewish refugees at 36,000.\nAlso, in 1492, it is known the Jewish populations of Palermo, Messina, and several other cities were considerable, and that there were \"Giudeccas\", or Jewish settlements, in over 50 places in Sicily, ranging in anywhere population from 350 to 5,000. At their height, Jewish Sicilians probably constituted from five to eight percent of the island's population.\n\nMuslims had ruled much of the Iberian Peninsula since the first invasion in 711. By the late Middle Ages, Christian kings had begun to wage war on the Moors and recapture some of the peninsula. After the marriage of Ferdinand II of Aragon to Queen Isabella I of Castile, the Moors were finally forced out of Granada in 1492, completing the so-called Reconquista of the Iberian Peninsula.\n\nIn 1479 Sicily and Malta came under Aragonese rule. In 1492, as part of an attempt to maintain Catholic orthodoxy and purify their kingdom of Moorish influence, Ferdinand and Isabella ordered the forced expulsion or conversion of all Jews on pain of death. The date of the expulsion was extended from 18 September 1492 to 12 January 1493, in order to allow the extortion of opportunist tax levies.\n\nMany Sicilian Jews fled to the neighboring mainland of Calabria, where the Spanish Inquisition caught up with them again fifty years later. Not all of the Sicilian Jews departed. A small number of Sicily's Jewish community converted to Catholicism and remained on the island.\n\nThe great part of the Sicilian Jewish community fled to the Ottoman Empire, especially to what is since the twentieth century Greece, Cyprus and Turkey. They were well received there. The settlements of these Jews were in Greece and Turkey were large enough great to build their own congregations and to print books.\n\nThe Jews have never returned en masse to Sicily. However, in 2005, for the first time since the Expulsion, a Passover seder was conducted in Sicily (in Palermo), held by the Milanese progressive Rabbi.\n\n\n\n"}

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on September 24, 1995. In the episode, the film version of the comic book series \"Radioactive Man\" is shot in Springfield. Much to Bart's disappointment, the part of the hero's sidekick, Fallout Boy, goes to Milhouse. When he tires of the long hours required to shoot the film, Milhouse quits the role, forcing the filmmakers to cease production and return to Hollywood.\n\nThe episode was written by John Swartzwelder and directed by Susie Dietter. Mickey Rooney guest starred as himself in the episode. \"Radioactive Man\" was the first episode of \"The Simpsons\" to be digitally colored. The episode features cultural references to the \"Batman\" television series, the 1995 film \"Waterworld\", and the song \"Lean on Me\" by Bill Withers. \n\nSince airing, the episode has received positive reviews from fans and television critics. It acquired a Nielsen rating of 9.5, and was the fourth-highest-rated show on the Fox network that week.\n\nBart and Milhouse are thrilled to learn a film version of their favorite comic book series, \"Radioactive Man\", is being produced in Springfield. Several Springfield Elementary students audition for the role of Fallout Boy when tryouts are held at their school. After Bart is rejected for being an inch too short, Milhouse is cast as Fallout Boy opposite Rainier Wolfcastle as Radioactive Man. When Milhouse's parents hear their son will play Fallout Boy, they buy expensive items because they expect to \"start living in the fast lane\" now that their son is a Hollywood movie star.\n\nDisappointed at losing the role, Bart remains Milhouse's friend and confidant. Milhouse soon sours on the long hours and multiple takes required to shoot the film and disappears during filming of the most expensive scene. Production is suspended while the townspeople search for Milhouse. Bart finds him in his tree house, where former child star Mickey Rooney unsuccessfully tries to convince Milhouse to finish the film. Once they realize that Rooney is unsuitable to replace Milhouse as Fallout Boy, the bankrupt producers shelve the film and return to Hollywood.\n\nThe episode was written by John Swartzwelder, and directed by Susie Dietter. When Dietter read through his first script, she did not find it very funny because of all the visual gags. Once the animatic was finished, she thought: \"Hey, this is really funny!\"\n\nThis is the first episode of \"The Simpsons\" to be digitally colored. The duties of that task went to USAnimation, who would later work on \"The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular\". Digital coloring would not be attempted again until season 12's \"Tennis the Menace\", and again in season 14's \"Treehouse of Horror XIII\". The show permanently switched to digital coloring later in that same season, beginning with \"The Great Louse Detective\".\n\nMickey Rooney guest starred as himself in the episode. Nancy Cartwright recalls in her autobiography \"My Life as a 10-Year-Old Boy\" that Rooney recorded his lines with the other actors. Although he was late for the session, she comments that he was \"so full of pep\" and very enthusiastic about the role.\n\nThe Radioactive Man character is based on Batman, and several scenes in the episode reference the \"Batman\" television series from the 1960s. A \"Radioactive Man\" antagonist, The Scoutmaster, is based on actor/comedian Paul Lynde. The scene in the new \"Radioactive Man\" film where Radioactive Man and Fallout Boy are captured in Aquaworld is a reference to the 1995 film \"Waterworld\". The director of the \"Radioactive Man\" film says: \"That Milhouse is going to be big, Gabby Hayes big!\", in reference to the American actor Gabby Hayes. Moe Szyslak, the bartender of Moe's Tavern, says that he, as a kid, played the part of Smelly on \"The Little Rascals\", until he killed Alfalfa for stealing his schtick. Bill Withers' song \"Lean on Me\" from 1972 is played at the end of the episode.\n\nIn one scene, Comic Book Guy sends a message to other Internet nerds about who will star in the new \"Radioactive Man\" film, two of whom are the nerds Homer met in \"Homer Goes to College\", and one is Prince dressed in a purple suit. The last nerd is Curtis Armstrong with an appearance resembling his \"Revenge of the Nerds\" character Booger. The usenet newsgroup which he posts the message to (alt.nerd.obsessive) is a reference to the alt.tv.simpsons newsgroup.\n\nIn its original broadcast, \"Radioactive Man\" finished 51st in the ratings for the week of September 18 to September 24, 1995. It acquired a Nielsen rating of 9.5. The episode was the fourth-highest-rated show on the Fox network that week, following \"The X-Files\", \"Beverly Hills, 90210\", and \"Melrose Place\".\n\nSince airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from fans and television critics. \n\nThe authors of the book \"I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide\", Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, called the episode a \"wonderful pastiche\" on the Tim Burton Batman films, and added that Milhouse is an obvious candidate for Fallout Boy. \n\nDVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson enjoyed the episode, but he does not consider it a \"classic\". He said that it offers \"more than a few amusing bits\", and added that \"spoofing the movie business isn't anything new, but the show does it well in this solid program\". \n\nJennifer Malkowski of DVD Verdict considered the best part of the episode to be when Krusty tries to prove the \"range\" of different characters he can portray to the casting director. The website concluded its review by giving the episode a grade of A-.\n\nNancy Basile of About.com named it one of her twenty favorite episodes of the series, and said that she thinks the friendship between Bart and Milhouse in the episode is \"endearing\" and \"touching\". She added that she thinks the episode \"pokes fun at Hollywood very effectively\", and that \"To top it off, funny favorite characters Rainier Wolfcastle [...] and Lionel Hutz are also in the episode.\" \n\nGraham Beckwith of \"The Lantern\" singled out Rainier Wolfcastle's line \"My eyes! The goggles do nothing!\" from the episode as one of \"The Simpsons\" \"greatest one liners\". \n\n\"Total Film\"s Nathan Ditum ranked Rooney's performance as the eighth-best guest appearance in the show's history, commenting that he is \"desperately funny and self-effacing as a parody of his fallen child-star self.\"\n\n"}

The song was published by Box and Cox Publications (ASCAP).\n\nThe song celebrates the coconut shy (coconut toss) at funfairs, and the catchy chorus is the call of the showman \"standing underneath the flare\" (of gaslight), inviting the public to \"roll a bowl a ball a penny a pitch.\" The ball is tossed or bowled (as in cricket) or pitched at the coconuts with the object of knocking one off its stand.\n\nIn 1950, the song was a top-ten hit in the U.S. for Freddy Martin And His Orchestra with vocalist Merv Griffin and sold over three million copies. The following year, it was a number-25 hit for Danny Kaye.\n\nIt was a staple song of the \"Billy Cotton Band Show\" on British radio and television. The song is still played over the public address at Cambridge United football matches after home wins.\n\nThe song appeared in \"I Could Go On Singing\" (1963), Judy Garland's last film. A portion of the song also appeared in Disney's 1994 \"The Lion King\" (sung by Rowan Atkinson). Nicolas Cage also sang part of this song in \".\" Ringo Starr sang an impromptu version of the song in \"Magical Mystery Tour\", The Beatles' TV special broadcast by the BBC on 26 December 1967.

In the first episode of the 1977 sitcom \"Mind Your Language\" it is mentioned that a professor went crazy and sang this song.\n\nSwedish performer Povel Ramel wrote a Swedish version of the song in 1950. This version, \"Far jag kan inte få upp min kokosnöt\" (\"Dad I can't crack my coconut open\"), has little to do with the original. It is sung by a little boy who, in the course of his attempts to open his resilient coconut, disfigures his mother, demolishes the family's furniture, and finally blows their house up. This version also features prominently in the film \"My Life as a Dog\" (1985), as well as in the Swedish version of \"The Lion King\". The song is also known in Finland from the versions by and M. A. Numminen, \"Kuinka saisin rikki kookospähkinän\", which feature a similar tragicomic story.\n\nIn 1980, the Muppet Show produced a slight variation of the song for their fourth episode of the show's fifth season.\n\nThe 2011 British 3D computer-animated family film \"Gnomeo & Juliet\" also includes a portion of the song.\n"}
{"id": "2122881", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2122881", "title": "Moby Dick (1956 film)", "text": "Moby Dick (1956 film)\n\nMoby Dick is a 1956 film adaptation of Herman Melville's 1851 novel \"Moby-Dick\". It was directed by John Huston with a screenplay by Huston and Ray Bradbury. The film starred Gregory Peck, Richard Basehart, and Leo Genn.\n\nThe music score was written by Philip Sainton.\n\nIn order to create a visual effect reminiscent of old whaling prints, a black and white print was superimposed on a color print.\n\nSet in 19th-century New England, the story follows the whaling ship \"Pequod\" and its crew. Leading them is Captain Ahab, who was almost killed in an encounter with the \"great white whale\", Moby Dick, which bit off much of his left leg. Now he is out for revenge. With the crew that has joined him, Ahab is out to destroy the huge sperm whale sea mammal, but his obsession with vengeance is so great that he cannot turn back, eventually leading to the death of Ahab and all of his crew, save his newest able seaman, Ishmael.\n\n\nPeck was initially surprised to be cast as Ahab (part of the studio's agreement to fund the film was that Huston use a \"name\" actor as Ahab). Peck later commented that he felt Huston himself should have played Ahab. Huston had long wanted to make a film of \"Moby-Dick\", and had intended to cast his own father, actor Walter Huston as Ahab, but he had died in 1950. Peck went on to play the role of Father Mapple in the 1998 television miniseries adaptation of Melville's novel, with Patrick Stewart as Ahab.\n\nWelles later used the salary from his cameo to fund his own stage production of \"Moby Dick\", in which Rod Steiger played Captain Ahab.\n\nGregory Peck, comparing his performances in this film and the 1998 \"Moby Dick\" miniseries, said he liked the miniseries better because it was more faithful to the novel.\n\nDuring a meeting to discuss the screenplay, Ray Bradbury informed John Huston that regarding Melville's novel, he had \"never been able to read the damned thing\". According to the biography \"The Bradbury Chronicles\", there was much tension and anger between the two men during the making of the film, allegedly due to Huston's bullying attitude and attempts to tell Bradbury how to do his job, despite Bradbury being an accomplished writer. Bradbury's novel \"Green Shadows, White Whale\" includes a fictionalized version of his writing the screenplay with John Huston in Ireland. Bradbury's short story \"Banshee\" is another fictionalized account of what it was like to work with Huston on this film. In the television adaptation of the story for \"The Ray Bradbury Theater\" the Huston character was played by Peter O'Toole and the Bradbury surrogate by Charles Martin Smith.\n\nThe film was bankrolled by brothers Walter, Harold, and Marvin Mirisch, who financed Huston's \"Moulin Rouge\". The Mirisches made a deal with Warner Bros. in order to release the film. Under the agreement, WB would distribute \"Moby Dick\" for seven years, after which all rights would revert to the Mirisch brothers' company, Moulin Productions.\n\nThe film began shooting in Wales at Fishguard and Ceibwr Bay, Fishguard at Huston's request. Parts of the movie were shot at the sea in front of Caniçal, a traditional whaling parish in Madeira Islands, Portugal, with real action of whaling, done by whalers of Madeira Island. It was also filmed in Las Canteras beach, Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Canary Islands, Spain. Captain Alan Villiers commanded the ship for the film.\n\nMany exterior scenes set in New Bedford were shot on location in Youghal, Co. Cork, Ireland. The town has a public house, originally called Linehan's and at that time owned by Paddy Linehan, whose exterior appears in the movie. It was renamed Moby Dick's shortly after filming by Linehan. It is still owned and run by the Linehan family and boasts a fine collection of photographs taken of the cast and crew during the making of the film. While there, John Huston used the bar as his headquarters to plan each day's filming. The town's harbor basin, in front of Moby Dick's bar, was used to stand in as New Bedford's harbor, and some local people appear as extras in the ship's departure scene. Youghal's nineteenth century lighthouse also appears in a scene of the \"Pequod\" putting to sea (at sunset) on her fateful voyage.\n\nA myth that was put to rest in cinematographer Oswald Morris' autobiography, \"Huston, We Have a Problem\", is that no full-length whale models were ever built for the production. Previous accounts have claimed that as many as three 60-foot rubber \"white whales\" were lost at sea during filming, making them \"navigational hazards\". In fact the titular whale shown in the film was constructed by Dunlop in Stoke-on-Trent, England. Moby Dick was 75 ft long and weighed 12 tons, and required 80 drums of compressed air and a hydraulic system in order to remain afloat and operational. However the artificial whale came loose from its tow-line and drifted away in a fog. Peck confirmed in 1995 that he was aboard the prop. According to Morris, after the prop was lost the \"Pequod\" was followed by a barge with various whale parts (hump, back, fin, tail). 90% of the shots of the white whale are various size miniatures filmed in a water tank in Shepperton Studios in Surrey, near London. Whales and longboat models were built by a special effects man, August Lohman, working in conjunction with art director Stephen Grimes. Studio shots also included a life-size Moby jaw and head - with working eyes. The head apparatus which could move like a rocking horse was employed when actors were in the water with the whale. Gregory Peck's last speech is delivered in the studio while riding the white whale's hump (a hole was drilled in the side of the whale so Peck could conceal his real leg).\n\nThe \"Pequod\" was portrayed by, appropriately, the \"Moby Dick\". Built in England in 1887 as the \"Ryelands\", the ship came into the hands of the film industry in the 50s, and was also used in \"Treasure Island\". It was destroyed by fire in Morecambe, England in 1972. The schooners used were \"Harvest King\" and \"James Postlethwaite\", both from Arklow, Ireland.\n\nThe film went overbudget, from $2 million to around $4.4 million, which crippled Moulin Productions; \"Moby Dick\" was ultimately sold to United Artists in order to recoup some of the Mirisch brothers' debt (Warner Bros. still distributed the film, corresponding to their original licensing agreement; When the agreement ended, United Artists took over the film's distribution rights. After UA was acquired by MGM in 1981, the latter studio assumed distribution and currently holds the film’s copyright). \"Moby Dick\" did not recoup its budget upon its initial release.\n\nPeck and Huston intended to shoot Herman Melville's \"Typee\" in 1957, but the funding fell through. Not long after, the two had a falling-out. According to one biography, Peck discovered to his disappointment that he had not been Huston's choice for Ahab, but in fact was thrust upon the director by the Mirisch brothers to secure financing. Peck felt Huston had deceived him into taking a part for which Peck felt he was ill-suited. Years later, the actor tried to patch up his differences with the director, but Huston, quoted in Lawrence Grobel's biography \"The Hustons\", rebuked Peck (\"It was too late to start over\", said Huston) and the two never spoke to each other again. Nevertheless, Huston's daughter Anjelica confirmed in a 2003 \"Larry King Live\" interview that her father had \"adored\" Peck.\n\nIn the documentary accompanying the DVD marking the 30th anniversary of the film \"Jaws\", director Steven Spielberg states his original intention had been to introduce the Ahab-like character Quint (Robert Shaw), by showing him watching the 1956 version of the film and laughing at the inaccuracies therein. However, permission to use footage of the original film was denied by Gregory Peck as he was uncomfortable with his performance.\n\nAt the age of four, Anjelica Huston met Peck dressed as Ahab when she visited the set of her father's film. Decades later, she and Peck would meet again and become close friends with each other until the latter's death.\n\nThe film has an 84% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with the consensus that \"It may favor spectacle in place of the deeper themes in Herman Melville's novel, but John Huston's \"Moby Dick\" still makes for a grand movie adventure.\" Bosley Crowther of \"The New York Times\" called it \"a rolling and thundering color film that is herewith devoutly recommended as one of the great motion pictures of our times ... Space does not possibly permit us to cite all the things about this film that are brilliantly done or developed, from the strange, subdued color scheme employed to the uncommon faithfulness to details of whaling that are observed.\" \"Variety\" wrote, \"Essentially it is a 'chase' picture with all the inherent interest thereby implied and yet not escaping the quality of sameness and repetition which often dulls the chase formula.\" The review also found that \"Peck often seems understated and much too gentlemanly for a man supposedly consumed by insane fury.\" Edwin Schallert of the \"Los Angeles Times\" found the film to be \"something less than really great,\" although it \"has great moments, and is amazingly individual in its art, various phases of its drama, and notably in characters.\" Richard L. Coe of \"The Washington Post\" called it \"one of the rare ones, the sort of picture people will remember and rank as one of the screen's classics ... Not only is the film immensely exciting in purely screen terms, it is a haunting philosophical study.\" \"Harrison's Reports\" praised the \"excellence of the production values\" but noted, \"It is not until the last few reels, where a violent battle to the death takes place between the whale and the crew, that the action becomes highly exciting. This fierce combat with the whale has been staged in thrilling fashion and is the highlight of the film, but it is not enough to compensate for the lack of excitement in the preceding reels.\" John McCarten of \"The New Yorker\" called it \"a fine, big, elementary job that misses the mystical Melville by several nautical miles but affords us an almost completely satisfactory tour of the bounding main.\" \"The Monthly Film Bulletin\" wrote, \"The physical excitements of the adventure story which is the superstructure of Melville's book are all admirably done. Where Huston has failed is in suggesting the mysticism of the book and the ominous influence of Moby Dick himself. The great white whale is no 'portentous and mysterious monster ... the gliding great demon of the seas of life'; he is often, only too clearly made of plastic and electronically controlled. Without this presence and motivation much of the story loses its significance.\"\n\n\n\n\n"}

When he resigned as abbot on June 16, 1433 he was seventy-eight years old, giving his approximate birth year as 1355.\n\nHe became a Benedictine around 1380, and the portrait of him in the \"Squarcialupi Codex\" shows him in a Benedictine black cassock. On March 8, 1401 he took the post of abbot at S. Martin al Pino. Before 1417 he became the rector at Orbetello, a post he probably retained until around 1427. In the first decade of the 15th century, probably close to 1410, while in Florence, he supervised the compilation of \"Squarcialupi Codex,\" the single most important source of music in Italy in the 14th century.\n\nPaolo died in Florence. Since his will was dated September 21, 1436, he either died on that date or later, at an extremely advanced age (eighty-one) for the time.\n\nMost of Paolo's music was published in modern editions in the 1970s, making it easily available, and as a result he has received more than the usual amount of critical attention. His music had both progressive and conservative aspects. While most of his surviving music is secular, and all of it vocal, two sacred compositions (a \"Benedicamus Domino\" for two voices, and a \"Gaudeamus omnes in Domino\" for three) have also survived. How much is lost is impossible to guess, but the 14th century saw an explosion of interest in notated secular music in Italy, and the proportional survival of his secular to sacred work may well represent the actual trend.\n\nHis secular compositions are of three types: thirteen madrigals, forty-six \"ballate\" (some of which are fragmentary, and others of which have the ascription to Paolo erased in the source), and five miscellaneous secular songs. All of his music is for two or three voices, and all is datable through sources or stylistic features to the period before 1410. Whether he did any composing after 1410 is not known.\n\nThe most puzzling question about any source of Paolo's music is the presence in the \"Squarcialupi Codex,\" the compilation of which he probably supervised, of thirty-two pages, all with his name on the top, his portrait in the front, and containing nothing but empty staves. It has been suggested that his music was not available by the deadline for completion; but yet the blank pages remain. Hoppin (p. 466) suggests that Paolo actually was outside of Florence when the manuscript was compiled, in the service of Cardinal Angelo II Acciaioli, and this may account for the missing music.\n\nPaolo's madrigals combine Italian and French notation, and show considerable influence of the Avignon mannerist school of the \"ars subtilior\" in their complex and intricate rhythmic patterns; however most of them are for only two voices, a conservative choice. The \"ballate\" are more progressively done overall; most are for three voices, and are lyrical, melodic, but yet use some of the extreme rhythmic intricacies of the \"ars subtilior\" school. The influence of Landini, hard to avoid for any Florentine composer late in the 14th century, is evident both in the madrigals and the \"ballate.\"\n\n\n"}

It is one of the Formosan languages, a geographic group of Austronesian languages, and is subdivided in five dialects: Isbukun, Takbunuaz, Takivatan, Takibaka and Takituduh. Isbukun, the dominant dialect, is mainly spoken in the south of Taiwan. Takbunuaz and Takivatan are mainly spoken in the center of the country. Takibaka and Takituduh both are northern dialects. A sixth dialect, Takipulan, became extinct in the 1970s.\n\nThe Saaroa and Kanakanabu, two smaller minority groups who share their territory with an Isbukun Bunun group, have also adopted Bunun as their vernacular.\n\nLi (1988) splits the Bunun dialects into 3 main branches — Northern, Central, and Isbukun (also classified as Southern Bunun). Isbukun, the prestige dialect, is also the most divergent dialect. The most conservative dialects are spoken in the north.\n\n\nBunun was originally spoken in and around Sinyi Township (Xinyi) in Nantou County (De Busser 2009:63). From the 17th century onwards, the Bunun people expanded towards the south and east, absorbing other ethnic groups such as the Saaroa, Kanakanabu, and Thao. Bunun is spoken in an area stretching from Ren-ai Township in Nantou in the north to Yan-ping Township in Taitung in the south. Isbukun is distributed throughout Nantou, Taitung, and Kaohsiung. Takbanuað is spoken in Nantou and southern Hualien County. Takivatan is spoken in Nantou and central Hualien. Both Takituduh and Takibakha are spoken in Nantou.\n\nOrthographic notes:\n\nNotes:\n\nNotes:\n\nBunun is a verb-initial language and has an Austronesian alignment system or focus system. This means that Bunun clauses do not have a nominative–accusative or absolutive–ergative alignment, but that arguments of a clause are ordered according to which participant in the event described by the verb is 'in focus'. In Bunun, four distinct roles can be in focus: \nWhich argument is in focus is indicated on the verb by a combination of prefixes and suffixes .\nMany other languages with a focus system have different marking for patients, instruments and beneficiaries, but this is not the case in Bunun. The focussed argument in a Bunun clause will normally always occur immediately after the verb (e.g. in an actor-focus clause, the agent will appear before any other participant) and is in the Isbukun dialect marked with a post-nominal marker \"a\".\n\nBunun has a very large class of auxiliary verbs. Concepts that are expressed by auxiliaries include:\nIn fact, Bunun auxiliaries express all sorts of concepts that in English would be expressed by adverbial phrases, with the exception of time and place, which are normally expressed with adverbial phrases.\n\nTakivatan Bunun has the following word classes (De Busser 2009:189). (\"Note\": Words in open classes can be compounded, whereas those in closed classes cannot.)\n\n\n\nBunun is morphologically agglutinative language and has a very elaborate set of derivational affixes (more than 200, which are mostly prefixes), most of which derive verbs from other word classes. Some of these prefixes are special in that they do not only occur in the verb they derive, but are also foreshadowed on a preceding auxiliary. These are called lexical prefixes or anticipatory prefixes and only occur in Bunun and a small number of other Formosan languages.\n\nBelow are some Takivatan Bunun verbal prefixes from De Busser (2009).\n\nIn short:\n\nA more complete list of Bunun affixes from De Busser (2009) is given below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTakivatan Bunun personal pronoun roots are (De Busser 2009:453):\n\nThe tables of Takivatan Bunun personal pronouns below are sourced from De Busser (2009:441).\n\nIskubun Bunun personal pronouns are somewhat different (De Busser 2009:454).\nTakivatan Bunun has the following demonstrative roots and affixes (De Busser 2009:454):\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTakivatan Bunun also has definitive markers.\n\n"}

It was directed by Stephen Hopkins and stars Geoffrey Rush as Sellers, Miriam Margolyes as his mother Peg Sellers, Emily Watson as his first wife Anne Howe, Charlize Theron as his second wife Britt Ekland, John Lithgow as Blake Edwards, Stephen Fry as Maurice Woodruff and Stanley Tucci as Stanley Kubrick.\n\nThe film won the Golden Globe Award for Best Miniseries or Television Film and Rush won Best Actor – Miniseries or Television Film. It also won nine Primetime Emmy Awards, including Outstanding Lead Actor in a Miniseries or Movie for Rush.\n\nThe film shows Peter Sellers as a complex and tormented genius, whose success as a film star concealed his difficult and relatively unhappy private life. This \"troubled life\" is the primary focus of this biopic, which personalizes \"one of the greatest comic actors in the history of the British cinema,\" and shows the many masks he wore and characters he played as an actor.\n\nThe film makes clear that much of his success and identity were dependent initially on his domineering and doting mother. Eventually this success, first in radio and eventually in film, led to his succumbing to destructive mood swings and insecurity, and contributed to the deterioration of his marriages. Discovering his gift for comedy, his ego began to undermine his personal relationships with friends and co-workers. His personality became more turbulent. His own personality often merged with that of his film characters, and his self-learned skill as a method actor was used to mask his real self.\n\n\nMany familiar faces have small roles in the film: Edward Tudor-Pole (former Tenpole Tudor lead singer and second presenter of \"The Crystal Maze\") plays Spike Milligan and \"The League of Gentlemen\"s Steve Pemberton plays Harry Secombe. Mackenzie Crook of \"The Office\" also has a small role as a luxury automobile salesman and Richard Ayoade from \"The IT Crowd\" in a bit-part as a photographer. Ray Ellington was played by his son, Lance Ellington.\n\nThe role of Sellers was acted by Geoffrey Rush, \"who approached the role with the enthusiasm of a hungry child in a candy store\", notes a reviewer. Rush impersonates most of the important characters that Sellers played in his film career. Director Blake Edwards is played by John Lithgow, and the film exposes some of the behind-the-scenes personality conflicts between Sellers and Edwards, which contributed to their unhappy and tumultuous working relationship, despite the success of their films. In the interview for the film, included on the DVD, Edwards credited Rush with portraying Sellers' characters with uncanny similarity to the real Peter Sellers, and in 2004 claimed that it was the best acting he had ever seen Rush perform.\n\nRush stated in interviews that the film was itself structured to be reminiscent of a Peter Sellers film. However, it was darker than Sellers' actual films since it depicted Sellers' troubled experiences in his life (including his tantrums and mental instability). This included at various times Rush (as Sellers) dressing up to play other characters in his life (several were ultimately edited out, but are included within the special features on the DVD). In these instances he broke the fourth wall to give a monologue to the audience.\n\nRoger Lewis: \"It was the melancholia of Sellers I was drawn to; all those shuffling little ghostly figures he used to play in Boulting brothers films, or Clouseau, with those soulful, mournful brown eyes. For all the success and the women, he is rather a lonely and melancholic figure. And that is what redeems him.\" Hollywood was immediately interested in adapting Lewis's biography. In the mid-1990s Madonna's company Maverick bought the rights, but the Sellers project did not get off the ground. Many different writers worked on the screenplay, among them Lee Hall; eventually the writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely came up with a script to tell the story. Director Stephen Hopkins ultimately distanced himself from Lewis's book, and said he was inspired by Sellers's 16mm home movies, which were featured in a 1995 BBC \"Arena\" documentary, \"The Peter Sellers Story\", directed by Peter Lydon.\n\nAlthough intended as a television production, the film was given a limited theatrical release in the United Kingdom and was also theatrically released in a number of other countries including Spain, Italy, Ireland, New Zealand and Australia. The film achieved its highest theatrical success in Australia, earning close to US$1 million at the box office.\n\nThe \"Belfast Telegraph\" notes how the film captured Sellers's \"life of drugs, drink, fast cars and lots and lots of beautiful women\". Although the film was widely praised by critics, both Lord Snowdon and Britt Ekland were highly critical of the film and the enactment of Sellers; Ekland believed that the film left the audiences with the wrong impression, saying \"the film leaves you with the impression that Peter Sellers was essentially a likeable man when in reality he was a monster. He may have been a brilliant actor, but as a human being he had no saving graces at all\". Snowdon disagreed with Ekland's verdict, and with the film, and stated that Sellers \"had a light touch, a sense of humour, I can't bear to see him portrayed as somebody who was apparently without either ... The man on the screen is charmless, humourless and boring - the one thing you could never say about Peter.\"\n\n\"The Life and Death of Peter Sellers\" was nominated for the Palme d'Or at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival. The film won the Golden Globe Award for Best Miniseries or Television Film and Geoffrey Rush won for Best Actor – Miniseries or Television Film. Rush also won the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Miniseries or Television Movie and the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Miniseries or Movie.\n\n\n"}

Its alumni include journalists at \"The New York Times\", \"The Washington Post\", and \"The Wall Street Journal\", as well as Pulitzer Prize winners.\n\n\"The Daily Princetonian,\" nicknamed the 'Prince', was the second college newspaper in America to publish daily. The paper, founded in 1876 as a biweekly publication named The Princetonian, became \"The Daily Princetonian\" in 1892 when it became a daily newspaper.\n\nProduced by a staff of nearly 200 undergraduate students, the organization has an annual budget of more than $600,000. The \"Prince\" has a daily print circulation of 2,000 and its website receives roughly 2,500 hits every day.\n\nThe \"Prince\" is fully independent from Princeton University. It is directed by a graduate board of trustees, consisting of former editors and business staffers. The paper supports itself financially and does not receive financial support from the university or from alumni donations. The paper currently has an endowment of 1.3 million dollars. No staff member on the 'Princetonian' is paid.\n\nThe \"Daily Princetonian\"'s offices are housed at 48 University Place, Princeton, N.J., on the western edge of the university's main campus. The paper's editorial staff consists entirely of Princeton students. Daily operations at the \"Prince\" are run by the editor-in-chief, who directs the editorial side of the paper, and the business manager, who directs the business and financial side. The business manager and the editor-in-chief report independently to the newspaper's board of trustees, in order to prevent business and editorial matters from mixing.\n\nThe editor-in-chief and business manager are chosen in December and appoint the remainder of their respective boards. Those boards take control of the newspaper with the beginning of the second semester, in February. The editorial boards serve for two semesters. Typically, the editor-in-chief and business manager begin their service in the spring of their junior year and complete their service in the winter of their senior year. This staggered system was created in part to allow graduating seniors time to finish their senior theses.\n\nThe first woman elected editor of the \"Prince\" was Anne C. Mackay-Smith, Class of 1980; Judy E. Piper, Class of 1976, was the first woman business manager; Taylor Jean-Jacques, Class of 2020, was the first Black (and Black woman) business manager.\n\nThe staff is grouped into several sections, including news, sports, opinion, photography, copy editing, multimedia, design, business and web.\n\nIn December 2006, Larry DuPraz, a long-time employee of the newspaper who directed its publication and guided its editors from 1946 to 1987, died from heart disease at the age of 87. In 2012, the paper's digitized archives was formally launched and named in his honor.\n\nIn January 2007, the \"Prince\" caused controversy when it published a fictitious editorial in its \"joke issue\" regarding the Jian Li lawsuit. Some Asian groups complained for its use of offensive stereotypes, which included portrayals of Asian-Americans as people who cook greasy food and wash clothes. The \"Prince\" issued a statement concerning its motivations and expectations for the piece, stating that it did not mean to be offensive but rather satirical.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He is noted for the position that evolutionary processes need to be considered in determining how the mind deals with symbolic information and language. In particular, he suggests that explicit, algorithmic processes (the computational theory of mind) may be inadequate to understanding how the mind works\n\nHe is also known as the proponent of the mimetic theory of speech origins.\n\nHe received his degrees in Canada, culminating in his Ph.D. in neuropsychology from McGill University in 1968. Following three years on the faculty of Yale School of Medicine, he joined the faculty of Queen's University at Kingston in 1972 and is still professor emeritus at Queen's. In the fall of 2005, Donald became the founding chair of the cognitive science department at Case Western Reserve University. He has since retired as the chair of that department and is currently an adjunct professor within the university.\n\nMerlin Donald is widely known as the author of two books on human cognition, \"Origins of the Modern Mind\" and \"A Mind So Rare\".\n\nHis central thesis across these works is that the human capacity for symbolic thought arises not from the evolution of a language-specific mental module, but out of evolutionary changes to the prefrontal cortex affecting the executive function of the primate brain. The enhanced attentional, metacognitive, and retrieval capacities that resulted from these changes made hominids immensely more capable of dealing with social complexity than their ancestors. He concludes that what drove brain expansion was not the cognitive demands of toolmaking or spatial mapping of the environment, but the growth in the size of the social group, that imposed greater demands on memory.\n\nIn Donald's account, these changes amounted to the evolution of a completely novel cognitive strategy: a symbiosis between brain and culture. The human brain, he argues, is adapted to function expressly in a complex symbolic culture; it cannot realize its potential unless it is immersed in a complex network of communication and symbolic representation. This inextricable relationship between biology and culture also, he proposes, has interesting ramifications for the future of human cognitive development in light of the continuing development of technologies that support and change our relationship with symbolic thought and culture.\n\n\"Origins of the Modern Mind\" proposes a three-stage development of human symbolic capacity through culture:\n\n\nDonald suggests that the increasing reliance on external memory media in this third stage, which applies in varying degrees to most people in the developed world, may have profound effects on our cognitive development and behavior:The externalization of memory was initially very gradual, with the invention of the first permanent external symbols. But then it accelerated, and the numbers of external prepresentational devices now available has altered how humans use their biologically given cognitive resources, what they can know, where that knowledge is stored, and what kinds of codes are needed to decipher what is stored... When we study literate English-speaking adults living in a technologically advanced society, we are looking at a subtype that is not any more typical of the whole human species, than, say, the members of a hunter-gatherer group. What would our science look like if it had been based on a very different type of culture? The truth is, we don't know, but it would profit us greatly to find out, because the human cognitive system, \"down to the level of its internal modular organization\", is affected not only by its genetic inheritance, but also by its own peculiar cultural history.

He was born in Newton, New Jersey, and raised in St. Louis, Missouri. He dropped out of high school in his junior year and enlisted in the United States Army. He then served a one-year tour of duty in Vietnam as a radio repairman. Beginning his second tour on November 12, 1967, he was assigned to the 161st Assault Helicopter Company, holding the rank of Specialist Four. Serving as a crew chief aboard an OH-23 Raven observation helicopter, his pilot was Warrant Officer One Hugh Thompson, Jr. and his door-gunner was Specialist Four Lawrence Colburn, both of whom would also be acclaimed for their heroism at My Lai.\n\nIn the early morning hours of March 16, 1968, Andreotta's OH-23 encountered no enemy fire over My Lai 4. Spotting two possible Viet Cong suspects, Thompson forced the Vietnamese men to surrender and flew them off for a tactical interrogation. He also marked the location of several wounded Vietnamese with green smoke, a signal that they needed help.\n\nReturning to the My Lai area at around 0900 after refueling, the crew noticed that the people they had marked were now dead. Out in a paddy field beside a dike 200 meters south of the village, they marked the location of a wounded young Vietnamese woman. Thompson and his crew watched from a low hover as Captain Ernest Medina (C Company Commander, 1st Battalion, 20th Infantry Regiment) came up to the woman, prodded her with his foot, and then shot and killed her.\n\nThompson then flew over an irrigation ditch filled with dozens of bodies. Shocked at the sight, he radioed his accompanying gunships, knowing his transmission would be monitored by many on the net: \"It looks to me like there's an awful lot of unnecessary killing going on down there. Something ain't right about this. There's bodies everywhere. There's a ditch full of bodies that we saw. There's something wrong here.\"\n\nMovement from the ditch indicated to Thompson that there were still people alive in there. Thompson landed his helicopter and dismounted. David Mitchell, a sergeant and squad leader in 1st Platoon, C Company, walked over to him. When asked by Thompson whether any help could be provided to the people in the ditch, the sergeant replied that the only way to help them was to put them out of their misery. Second Lieutenant William Calley (1st Platoon Leader, C Company) then came up, and the two had the following conversation:\n\nThompson took off again, and Andreotta reported that Mitchell was now executing the people in the ditch. Furious, Thompson flew over the northeast corner of the village and spotted a group of about ten civilians, including children, running toward a homemade bomb shelter. Pursuing them were soldiers from the 2nd Platoon, C Company. Realizing that the soldiers intended to murder the Vietnamese, Thompson landed his aircraft between them and the villagers. Thompson turned to Colburn and Andreotta and told them that if the Americans began shooting at the villagers or him, they should fire their M60 machine guns at the Americans: \"Y'all cover me! If these bastards open up on me or these people, you open up on them. Promise me!\": Thompson then dismounted to confront the 2nd Platoon's leader, Stephen Brooks. Thompson told him he wanted help getting the peasants out of the bunker:\n\nBrooks declined to argue with him, even though as a commissioned officer he outranked Thompson.\n\nAfter coaxing the 11 Vietnamese out of the bunker, Thompson persuaded the pilots of the two UH-1 Huey gunships (Dan Millians and Brian Livingstone) flying as his escort to evacuate them. While Thompson was returning to base to refuel, Andreotta spotted movement in an irrigation ditch filled with approximately 100 bodies. The helicopter again landed and the men dismounted to search for survivors. After wading through the remains of the dead and dying men, women and children, Andreotta extracted a live boy, and handed him up to Colburn and Thompson. As Thompson described it:\n\n\"Glenn Andreotta—if there was a hero, I don’t like that word, but if there was a hero at My Lai—it was Glenn Andreotta, because he saw movement in that ditch, and he fixed in on this one little kid and went down into that ditch. I would not want to go in that ditch. It’s not pretty. It was very bad. I can imagine what was going through his mind down there, because there was more than one still alive—people grabbing hold of his pants, wanting help. \"I can’t help you. You’re too bad [off].\" He found this one kid and brought the kid back up and handed it to Larry, and we laid it across Larry and my lap and took him out of there. I remember thinking Glenn Andreotta put himself where nobody in their right mind would want to be, and he was driven by something. I haven’t got the aircraft on the ground real stable. He bolted out of that aircraft into this ditch. Now he was a hero. Glenn Andreotta gave his life for his country about three weeks later. That’s the kind of guy he was, and he was a hero that day.\"\n\nThompson flew the survivor to the ARVN hospital in Quang Ngai.\n\nUpon returning to their base at about 1100, Thompson heatedly reported the massacre to his superiors. His allegations of civilian killings quickly reached Lieutenant Colonel Frank Barker, the operation's overall commander. Barker radioed his executive officer to find out from Captain Medina what was happening on the ground. Medina then gave the cease-fire order to Charlie Company to \"knock off the killing\".\n\nAndreotta was killed shortly after the events at My Lai while serving in B Company (the \"Warlords\") of the 123rd Aviation Battalion of the Americal Division (the 161st Assault Helicopter Company had been reorganized into the 123rd Battalion in January 1968). On April 8 he was serving as the door-gunner aboard OH-23 helicopter 62-03813, along with crew chief Specialist Five Charles M. Dutton and pilot First Lieutenant Barry Lloyd.\n\nViet Cong activity was reported 10 kilometres southwest of Quang Ngai City, and their scout helicopter was ordered to accompany two gunships to that location and flush out and destroy the enemy. Andreotta was killed outright by small-arms fire from the ground, a single shot to his head. Then a Vietnamese 12.7 mm anti-aircraft machine gun began firing on the scout, destroying both the swashplate and control panel. Dutton was covered in burning Avgas when the craft finally hit the ground, and a Vietnamese soldier ran towards the wreckage and shot him, before retreating—leaving a wounded Lloyd lying in shock where he had been thrown from the impact. He was rescued by Warrant Officer One Michael Banek's UH-1 Huey and taken to Chu Lai. The helicopter was officially declared \"Destroyed by Fire\" by the US Military on April 11, although both Andreotta's and Dutton's bodies were recovered.\n\nSoon after he was killed by hostile fire, Andreotta received a posthumous Bronze Star for his part in rescuing children at My Lai. The citation falsified what happened at My Lai by saying the children had been \"hiding in a bunker located between friendly forces and hostile forces engaged in a heavy firefight.\" It went on to say \"Andreotta's willingness to risk his life for innocent children and his bravery in action reflect great credit upon himself, his unit, the Americal Division, and the United States Army.\" Hugh Thompson's signature was forged on the eyewitness report. Andreotta received a posthumous Courage of Conscience Award for his unusual bravery and compassion in helping, along with helicopter crew members Hugh C. Thompson Jr. and Lawrence Coburn, to save civilian lives during the My Lai massacre in Vietnam in 1968.\n\nAndreotta was posthumously awarded the Soldier's Medal in 1998 for his bravery in stopping the My Lai Massacre, along with Lawrence Colburn and Hugh Thompson, Jr.. Since his mother was in ill health at the time, she accepted his award at her home at a later date. \"It was the ability to do the right thing even at the risk of their personal safety that guided these soldiers to do what they did,\" then-Major General Michael Ackerman said at the ceremony. The three \"set the standard for all soldiers to follow.\" Additionally on March 10, 1998, Senator Max Cleland (D-GA) entered a tribute to Thompson, Colburn and Andreotta into the record of the U.S. Senate. Cleland said the three men were, \"true examples of American patriotism at its finest.\"\n\nHis name appears on the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Wall on panel 48E, line 50. In 1999, his name was among nearly a million sent aboard the Stardust spacecraft.\n\n"}

{"id": "2123003", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2123003", "title": "Dryas iulia", "text": "Dryas iulia\n\nDryas iulia (often incorrectly spelled \"julia\"), commonly called the Julia butterfly, Julia heliconian, the flame, or flambeau, is a species of brush-footed (or nymphalid) butterfly. The sole representative of its genus Dryas, it is native from Brazil to southern Texas and Florida, and in summer can sometimes be found as far north as eastern Nebraska. Over 15 subspecies have been described.\n\nIts wingspan ranges from 82 to 92 mm, and it is colored orange (brighter in male specimens) with black markings; this species is somewhat unpalatable to birds and belongs to the \"orange\" Mullerian mimicry complex.\n\nThis butterfly is a fast flier and frequents clearings, paths, and margins of forests and woodlands. It feeds on the nectar of flowers, such as lantanas (\"Lantana\") and shepherd's-needle (\"Scandix pecten-veneris\"), and the tears of caiman, the eye of which the butterfly irritates to produce tears. Its caterpillar feeds on leaves of passion vines, including \"Passiflora affinis\" and yellow passionflower (\"P. lutea\") in Texas.\n\nIts mating behavior is complex and involves a prolonged courtship whose outcome appears to be controlled by the female. This raises questions pertaining to the occurrence of the evolution of sexual conflict.\n\nThe species is popular in butterfly houses because it is long-lived and active throughout the day. However, the caterpillars are spiky and may cause a skin rash.\n\n\"D. iulia\" is characterized by elongated orange wings with black wing markings that vary by subspecies. Black markings are mainly located near the wing tips. Male Julia butterflies can be identified by their brighter orange color, compared to the duller orange exhibited by females . Images of many Julia butterfly subspecies can be found at the bottom of the page.\n\n\"D. iulia\" is common in the tropical and subtropical areas of North, Central, and South America. In South America, throughout countries like Brazil, Ecuador, and Bolivia, the Julia butterfly is commonly distributed. The butterfly is also widespread throughout a number of the Caribbean islands, with endemic subspecies located in Cuba, Dominica, the Bahamas, and Puerto Rico, among others. Moving further north, the species can be commonly witnessed in Central America up into Texas and Florida (and can occasionally be found to move into the Nebraska area during the summer). The geographic distribution of \"D. iulia\" overlaps with the ranges of other butterflies which sometimes leads to conflict. For example, the ranges of \"D. iulia\" and the gulf fritillary overlap; in some cases, gulf fritillaries can sometimes be subjected to competition and fighting from \"Dryas iulia moderata\" when the two species have breeding populations in similar areas and within the same geographic range.\n\n\"D. iulia\" prefer open, sunny breaks in the subtropical and tropical forests it inhabits. The butterfly is also common in open areas such as gardens, cattle grazing lands, and forest clearings, due to human impact. \"D. iulia\" can be found on a few main hostplants (or shrubs in Latin America) including the passion vine of the family Passifloraceae.\n\n\"D. iulia\" flights take place throughout the year in southern Florida and southern Texas, but especially during the fall. The butterfly in its U.S. range has been seen to occasionally migrate as far north as Nebraska. However, south of its United States range, the Julia butterfly generally does not migrate. The butterfly's flight pattern can be fast or slow, and is usually seen around the middle story of their forest habitat.\n\n\"D. iulia\" larvae feed on \"Passiflora\" plants almost exclusively, specifically those of subgenuses \"Astrophea\" (also known as \"Passiflora\"), \"Polyanthea\", \"Tryphostemmatoides\", and \"Plectostemma\".\n\nAs adults, male and females feed differently based on their reproductive needs. As mentioned further down, males engage in mud-puddling behavior in order to gain valuable minerals for their spermatophores. They have also been seen to agitate the eyes of caimans and turtles in order to produce tears that the butterflies can drink. Observations of this from points 1500 km apart, were probably the first time scientific observations were coordinated via films broadcast on terrestrial television.\n\nFemales, meanwhile, besides visiting certain flower species for their nectar – like \"Lantana\" and \"Eupatorium\" (as both male and female \"D. iulia\" butterflies do) – also use pollen from flowers to gain nutrients needed for egg production.\n\n\"Passiflora vines\" and \"D. iulia\" (among other \"Heliconian\" butterflies) have shown strong evidence of coevolution, as the butterflies attempt to gain better survival for their laid eggs and the plants attempt to stop their destruction from larval feeding. Many members of the genus \"Passiflora\" have evolved to produce very tough, thick leaves that are hard to break down by the caterpillars. Some \"Passiflora\" vines have gone further by producing small leaves that look like a perfect place for the butterflies to lay eggs, but break off at the stem within a few days, carrying the \"D. iulia\" eggs with them. Other \"Passiflora\" vines actually mimic eggs of the butterfly species that use it as a hostplant, so that a passing butterfly thinks the plant already has eggs on it and consequently does not oviposit. The butterflies have thus evolved to be more discerning in their egg placement, and better able to detect strategies used by their host plant, the \"Passiflora\"\n\nMud-puddling is a peculiar social behavior engaged in by a number of butterfly species, including \"D. iulia\". It involves male butterflies crowding around damp ground in order to drink dissolved minerals through a process of water filtration. During copulation, the male butterfly uses minerals in his spermatophore, which must be replenished before the following mating. When a male finds a suitable spot for the behavior, other males can quickly join and hundreds of butterflies may become attracted to the site. Multiple species may join the group, but the butterflies do not evenly distribute between species. Instead, \"D. iulia\" and others usually remain near members of their own species.\n\n\"D. iulia\" butterflies are part of the “orange” Mullerian mimicry complex, one of the similar \"Heliconian\" species that employ this protective tactic. \"Passifloracae\", the primary food source of \"D. iulia\" caterpillars, contains trace amounts of cyanide. This has led to the development of cyanogenic glycosides that make the butterfly unpalatable to its predators, which come from a mixture of storage from their hostplant and larval synthesis. The mimicry in \"D. iulia\" involves other butterfly species having evolved to look similar to the Julia butterfly in order to convey their presumed unpalatability.\n\nJulia butterfly eggs tend to be a light yellow color when laid, which turns to a darker orange or brown shade before hatching. Each of the butterfly's eggs are separately laid onto new leaf tendrils of its host plant, usually the passionflower vine.\n\nThe egg of the butterfly measures about 1.2 mm in height and 1.0 mm in diameter. They have approximately 20 vertical ridges and 13 horizontal ridges.\n\n\"D. iulia\" caterpillars eat slots into the leaves of their hostplant once they emerge from their egg. However, they do not have nests in their hostplants. They instead use the remaining part of the leaf as a protected area to rest on.\n\nThe caterpillars of the Julia butterfly have pink, gray, and black coloration throughout their body with maroon and cream patches. Long, branched, black spines also cover their entire body. A cream-colored, inverted Y-shaped mark can be seen on the front of the caterpillar's head.\n\nLarvae emit noxious chemicals in their larval stage because of the trace cyanide in their hostplant. This makes the larvae unpalatable to certain bird species, especially tanagers.\n\n\"D. iulia\" have five larval stages, and at the fifth the larva becomes a pupa. The pupa of the Julia butterfly is grayish white in color, and somewhat resembles a dead leaf.\n\nAfter emerging from their chrysalis, the male Julia butterfly spends the majority of its time looking for mates. At night, the butterfly roosts close to the ground, either in a small group or alone. \"D. iulia\"’s adult lifespan lasts for less than a month.\n\nCourtship behavior in \"D. iulia\" involves a very specific sequence of steps that can be categorized into three sequential phases: an aerial phase, an air-ground phase, and a ground phase. The observed courtship steps are outlined in detail below:\n\nFirst, the male \"D. iulia\" approaches the female from behind. Then, the female takes flight, with the male flying in front of and above the female. This position is taken by the male so that the female can smell the male's scent scales and become sexually stimulated. Next, the female attempts to fly higher than the male, which can be seen as an anti-copulatory behavior, before landing. After that, the male \"D. iulia\" continues to beat his wings above and in front of the female, while both face the same direction. The female butterfly then opens and vibrates her hind wings and front wings. Her hind wings are fully opened while her forewings are only partially so. At the same time, the female emits scent glands from her raised abdomen. The male then beats his wings behind and then in front of the female once again. If the female is satisfied by the courtship, she lowers her abdomen and shuts her wings in preparation for mating.\n\nMating can occur within two weeks of the Julia butterfly's exit from the chrysalis. As adults, male \"D. iulia\" spend the majority of their time searching for females to mate with. Females of this butterfly species can mate four times in their lifetime, which is unusual for female \"Heliconius\" butterflies who generally mate just once.\n\nMany mating behaviors in \"D. iulia\" are sex-specific, and can include receptive and non-receptive behaviors by the females of the species. Some female behaviors regarded as showing non-receptiveness include abdomen raising and overflight, in which the female attempts to fly higher than the male during the aerial phase of courtship. On the other hand, a female behavior such as shutting her wings has been found to be a key receptive behavior. For males, persistence did not seem to be a key driver of success, as behaviors performed by persistent males such as hovering over the female did not often lead to copulation.\n\nThe inability of persistent males – meaning, those that carried on extended courtship behavior – to increase copulation has led to researchers theorizing female copulation acceptance as the primary determinant of successful copulation in \"D. iulia\". For example, the only male behavioral acts found to be indicative of successful copulation occurred in response to signals of female receptiveness.\n\nJulia butterfly copulation is always terminated by the males after the ground phase. The female remains at the mating site as the male flies away. This raises the idea of an evolutionary basis for this behavior based on a conflict of interests between males and females of the species. This conflict arises because of a difference in reproductive interests between the male and the female that has its beginnings in anisogamy. Sexual selection studies favor forms of sexual conflict such as this one to be one of the major sources of speciation in certain insects.\n\nThe methods of mate selection (by which a female accepts or denies a male suitor) are not completely understood. Some studies have reported the sexual dimorphism (of color and body size) of the butterfly as a key factor that may suggest an evolutionary basis towards understanding sexual selection. \"D. iulia\" male butterflies have been seen to chase females of butterfly species with similar visual cues, which has led researchers to believe that these visual recognition strategies form the basis of sexual partner selection in this species. However, more research is needed to identify how different aspects of \"D. iulia\"’s physical features factor into mate selection.\n\nWhen \"D. iulia\" are caterpillars, they can cause a skin rash on humans if touched. This is likely from the yellow liquid that is produced from the tips of the long, black spines that cover its body, which is emitted as a predator deterrent related to their cyanogenic glycosides\n\n\"D. iulia\" are commonly admired for their coloration. As a diurnal species of butterfly that is quite active during the day, Julia butterfly are often found in butterfly houses. One butterfly house in Phuket, Thailand, obtained Julia butterflies from an exporter butterfly farm in Costa Rica and released them during Buddhist ceremonies and weddings. The released butterflies have now colonized areas of Thailand and Malaysia and established a wild population. \"D. iulia\" are now too widespread in the region to eradicate.\n\nListed alphabetically:\n\n"}

{"id": "2123033", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2123033", "title": "Hasan Buzurg", "text": "Hasan Buzurg\n\nShaikh Hasan, called \"Buzurg\" (\"The Great\"), was the first of several de facto independent Jalayirid rulers of Iraq and central Iran. He was the son of Husain and Öljetey. His sister Soyurghatmish Khatun was married to Öljaitü Khan.\n\nHasan Buzurg was married to Baghdad Khatun, the daughter of Amir Chupan. Chupan later became the most influential person at the court of Abu Sa'id Mirza. However, the Ilkhan soon became enamored with Baghdad Khatun, and sought to have her divorce Hasan Buzurg. Chupan sent the two of them to Qarabagh in an attempt to rid Baghdad Khatun from Abu Sa'id's mind, but the effort failed, and Baghdad Khatun was forced to marry the Ilkhan. After the murder of Coban in 1327, Baghdad Khatun and the Grand Vizier Ghiyas al-Din ibn Rashid al-Din competed for influence over Abu Sa'id. Ghiyas al-Din spread a rumor that Baghdad Khatun and Hasan Buzurg were plotting against the Ilkhan; Hasan Buzurg was arrested in 1332. His mother convinced the Ilkhan to spare his life, and he was imprisoned in the castle of Kemah. In 1333, however, he was cleared and was sent to become governor of Rûm. During Abu Sa'id's lifetime, Hasan Buzurg was also called upon by Ghiyas al-Din to help stop rampant tax abuses in eastern Iran.\n\nFollowing the death of Abu Sa'id, several parties competed for the Ilkhanid throne. In 1336 Hasan Buzurg saw his chance and raised a child, Muhammad Khan, to claim the position. On July 24 Hasan Buzurg and Muhammad met the forces of Musa Khan and 'Ali Padshah in the Ala-Tagh area; Musa was defeated and 'Ali Padshah killed. Hasan Buzurg pursued Musa on his way to Baghdad and created many losses for his enemy. He then proceeded to Tabriz, where he married the granddaughter of Coban and the wife of Abu Sa'id, Dilshad Khatun, who was pregnant with Abu Sa'id's daughter. Meanwhile, the amirs in Khurasan adopted their own candidate for Ilkhan, Togha Temür. Togha set off in 1337 to subdue western Persia. Azarbaijan and 'Iraq-i 'Ajam were taken. In March he arrived before Sultaniyeh, the former capital of the Ilkhans, and Hasan Buzurg withdrew to Caucasian Albania. Musa's forces, initially battling Togha's, now joined the invader. Togha and Musa met Hasan Buzurg at Soghurlug in the Maragheh area on June 15; Hasan defeated them, took Musa prisoner shortly after, and executed him. Togha gave up the campaign and withdrew to eastern Persia.\n\nShortly afterwards, however, several descendants of Coban united under his grandson Hassan Kuchak, who used a slave to impersonate his father in order to legitimatize his cause. The Chobanids battled with Hasan Buzurg on July 16, 1338 at Naushahr in the Alataq area. Hasan Buzurg was defeated; his puppet khan, Muhammed, was killed. Shortly afterwards, the Chobanids conquered Azarbaijan. A peace was declared, but Hasan Buzurg sought to be rid of the Chobanid threat. He offered the Ilkhanid throne to Togha Temur, who invaded early in 1339. Hassan Kuchak, however, offered the hand of Sati Beg in marriage, and when Togha responded warmly to the proposal, he forwarded the letters to Hasan Buzurg. The latter, enraged, halted his expedition to support Togha, who was forced to withdraw during the summer of that year.\n\nFollowing his abandonment of Togha Temur, Hasan Buzurg recognized Jahan Temur, a grandson of Gaykhatu, as Ilkhan. The conflict with the Chobanids again boiled over, and Hasan Buzurg and Jahan Temur met Hassan Kuchak and his new puppet Suleiman Khan in battle on the Jaghatu. There Hasan Buzurg was defeated on June 26, 1340. He fled to Baghdad; following which he declared Jahan Temur deposed. With the Chobanids continuing to press him, Hasan Buzurg again recognized Togha Temur’s suzerainty, and struck coins in his name. After he stopped recognizing Togha in 1344, he still did not proclaim himself independent, and ruled with the title of ulus beg, as a mere governor, simply leaving the Ilkhan throne unfilled. Nevertheless, this marks the beginning of effectively independent Jalayirid rule.\n\nFor the rest of his reign Hasan Buzurg attempted to deal with the Chobanids. He managed to form an alliance with Hassan Kuchak’s uncle Surgan, as well as the governor of Diyarbakır and the Mamluk Sultanate, but Surgan was soon convinced to abandon the alliance, and the Mamelukes withdrew shortly after. He also offered assistance to another of Hassan Kuchak’s uncles, Yagi Basti, as well as to Mas’ud Shah of the Injuids, in their attempt to expel Hassan Kuchak’s cousin Pir Hosayn from Shiraz. The murder of Hassan Kuchak in 1343 did not provide much relief, for his brother Malek Ashraf sent an army to conquer Baghdad in 1347. Jalayirid forces, however, inflicted heavy losses on the force, which was forced to retreat by the summer. While Malek Ashraf and the Chobanids would survive until 1357, their threat to the Jalayirids was diminished. Hasan Buzurg continued to play an influential part in Persian politics; he assisted the Injuid Abu Ishaq against the Muzaffarids, helping him restore his rule in Isfahan in 1353. The latter, however, destroyed the Injuids in 1357.\n\nHasan Buzurg died in 1356. He was succeeded by his son, Shaikh Awais Jalayir. In addition to Avais, he was the father of Amir Zahid.\n\nHasan Buzurg seemed intent on restoring unity to the Ilkhanate. This is evidenced by the fact that he used the title of ulus beg all of his life, and raised several men as Ilkhans instead of ruling in his own name. Furthermore, he attempted to unify Persia; he had sent a Muhammad-I Mulai to act as governor of Khurasan, for example; the latter was later executed by Togha Temür’s military commander Arghun Shah. In attempting to maintain the Ilkhanate, he ultimately failed, and in some ways accelerated its disintegration, by preventing other forces such as the Chobanids from gaining more influence. However, he set up a strong state that would rule over Iraq and parts of Persia for over half a century, a state that would become even more powerful under his successor Shaikh Avais.\n\nHasan Buzurg is also remembered for his friendship with Safi-ad-din Ardabili (d. 1334) of the Ardabili tariqa. This evolved into the Safaviyya movement and Ardabili's descendants would found the Safavid dynasty. After Hasan Buzurg's death, the Jalayirids continued to maintain good relations with the Arbadili order. Later on, many of Hasan Buzurg's accomplishments would be accredited to his friendship with Safi al-Din.\n\n"}

The music was written by Jerry Garcia and John Dawson and the lyrics are by Robert Hunter. It is the second track of the Dead's 1970 album \"American Beauty\".\n\nAccording to band confederate Amy Moore, the song was partially inspired by rakish Grateful Dead road manager/advance man Rock Scully and his entanglements with various women, including longtime common-law wife Nicki Scully; the \"child\" invoked in the penultimate verse was a homage to Acacia Scully, a child from Nicki Scully's previous relationship who was adopted by the manager.\n\nThe song is largely acoustic, like most of \"American Beauty\". It is known for the guitar riff Garcia plays in the bass register, which is a descending G major scale (G F# E D C B A G). The song is among the most covered songs written by the Grateful Dead; Hunter later stated, \"that was the closest we've come to what may be a classic song.\"\n\nThe song was introduced in concert on March 20th, 1970 at the Capitol Theatre in Port Chester, NY. Following the group's October 1974-June 1976 touring hiatus, the song was performed in a significantly slower arrangement with extended guitar and keyboard solos. Loggins and Messina, whose version of the song was slowed down, might have inspired the Dead to do the same. In more recent history, Phil Lesh and Friends have performed a more uptempo version similar to the original.\n\nHunter plays a slightly different version on his album (released only in LP format) \"Jack O'Roses\". He adds a final verse:\n\n\"You can borrow from the Devil/\nYou can borrow from a friend/\nBut the Devil'll give you twenty/\nWhen your friend got only ten\"\n\n\n"}

The purpose of a bright-line rule is to produce predictable and consistent results in its application. The term \"bright-line\" in this sense generally occurs in a legal context.\n\nBright-line rules are usually standards established by courts in legal precedent or by legislatures in statutory provisions. The Supreme Court of the United States often contrasts bright-line rules with their opposite: balancing tests (or \"fine line testing\"), where a result depends on weighing several factors—which could lead to inconsistent application of law or reduce objectivity.\n\nIn the United States, there is much scholarly legal debate between those favoring bright-line rules and those favoring balancing tests. While some legal scholars, such as former Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, have expressed a strong preference for bright-line rules, critics often argue that bright-line rules are overly simplistic and can lead to harsh and unjust results. Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer noted that there are circumstances in which the application of bright-line rules would be inappropriate, stating that \"no single set of legal rules can ever capture the ever changing complexity of human life.\" Over the course of the last three decades, many bright-line rules previously established in U.S. jurisprudence have been replaced with balancing tests.\n\nSome observers consider the holding in Miranda v. Arizona to constitute a bright-line rule. The majority opinion in that case required law enforcement to advise a criminal suspect of certain rights whenever two conditions were met: 1) the suspect was in custody, and 2) the suspect was about to be interrogated.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2123051", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2123051", "title": "Ulster and Delaware Railroad", "text": "Ulster and Delaware Railroad\n\nThe Ulster and Delaware Railroad (U&D) was a railroad located in the state of New York. It was often advertised as \"The Only All-Rail Route to the Catskill Mountains.\" At its greatest extent, the U&D extended from Kingston Point on the Hudson River, through the Catskill Mountains to its western terminus at Oneonta, passing through the counties of Ulster, Delaware, Schoharie and Otsego.\n\nDuring the early 19th century waterways formed the principal transportation network in New York. An important point on this network was Rondout. Located at the confluence of Rondout Creek and the Hudson River, in 1828 it became the eastern terminus of the Delaware and Hudson Canal. Here cargo and passengers were transferred from canal boats to the larger vessels navigating the Hudson.\n\nBy the end of the Civil War, railroads were pre-empting waterways as the preferred method of transportation. Thomas Cornell, founder of the Cornell Steamboat Company and a resident of Rondout, was among those who noticed. Although Cornell made plenty of money from shipping, he planned a railroad that would bring supplies from towns in central or western New York to his port in Rondout. So Cornell chartered the Rondout and Oswego on April 3, 1866, with himself as the first president.\nWith the work of surveying and acquiring rights of way completed, construction started in 1868. Cornell decided to construct this new railroad of 62- and 70-pound rail. It would go from Rondout to the busy city of Oneonta on the upper Susquehanna River, and then to Oswego on the shore of Lake Ontario. The R&O at long reached the summer vacation resort of Olive Branch, near the town of Shokan, on September 30, 1869. By the next year, the first train was run and the railroad was finally operational.\n\nIn 1870 the railroad was extended to Phoenicia, where the railroad built a stucco station across Esopus Creek from the village. The same year, ownership of the railroad was transferred to John C. Brodhead and the line reached the small town of Big Indian. By 1871 construction reached Dean's Corners (now Arkville) (where it would eventually join the Delaware and Northern). However, the R&O folded upon completing construction to Roxbury, and the task of constructing the remainder of the route was left to its newly organized successor, the New York, Kingston & Syracuse (NYK&S).\nIt was a successful railroad, with plenty of passengers coming from surrounding towns and larger cities. Steamboat passengers could dock at Rondout and transfer to the railroad. Later, passengers could also transfer at Kingston, first via the Wallkill Valley Railroad (1872), then via the West Shore Railroad (1881), and much later via the New York, Ontario and Western Railway (1902). From the boats, it was a short walk to the R&O station to transfer to the train. Freight was also very well-handled. Much of the freight income was made from coal shipped along the D&H Canal from the Moosic Mountains near Carbondale, Pennsylvania, to the port at Rondout. There were also vegetables, fruit, and milk from the farms in the Catskills.\n\nWhile steadily grading to Moresville (present-day Grand Gorge), the great number of curves and grades created a problem, as more digging, ties and rails meant greater costs to complete the remainder of the railroad. The railroad couldn't make enough money to pay the debt and continue building the railroad, so in 1872 Cornell appointed John A. Greene to be president pro tempore for a period of 10 years. Greene was expected to have the railroad finished to the town of Oneonta by 1874, pay all of the debts, and withstand future debts of as much as $700,000. However, the railroad was slowly losing money and eventually had to reduce service before going bankrupt in 1872. Later that year, it was re-organized as the New York, Kingston and Syracuse Railroad to continue with the project.\n\nAfter the Rondout and Oswego railroad became bankrupt in 1872, it was quickly re-organized as the New York, Kingston and Syracuse Railroad (NYK&S), directed by George Sharpe. The plan of extending to Oswego was now omitted, and the new plan was to extend to Oneonta and make a sharp turn north to Earlville, where the line would make a connection with the recently constructed Syracuse and Chenango Valley Railroad. Construction of the railroad had begun immediately, and the railroad was extending very quickly. As of 1872, it had already reached the towns of Roxbury, Gilboa, and Stamford, with the first train arriving in the village of Stamford late that year.\n\nThis increased service provided the first real rail route into the Catskill Mountains, benefiting both passenger and freight customers. The railroad was further benefited by the many connections to other railroads, enabling passengers from as far away as New York City to visit the Catskills (via the newly constructed Wallkill Valley Railroad and its connection to the Erie Railroad). Another boon to business was a ferry that ran across the Hudson to Rondout from Rhinebeck with a Rhinebeck and Connecticut Railroad and New York Central and Hudson River Railroad station (the current Amtrak station) connecting the cities of Hartford, Connecticut, Providence, Rhode Island, and Boston, Massachusetts, to the region.\n\nThe town (and later city) of Kingston, New York (centrally located on the Hudson River) was profitable to the railroad, due to the large number of industries of the area, including cement, concrete, bricks and bluestone. Kingston was also a popular passenger stop, as people would rely on the railroad to take them around the Catskills to jobs at mills and small factories.\n\nAlthough this prosperity seemed good, there was bad news as well. The NYK&S still wasn't profitable enough to avoid bankruptcy. So in 1873, the NYK&S designated the Farmers Loan and Trust Company as trustee for the first-mortgage bondholders of the railroad. While this helped for a brief time, it was only another two years until even the trustee finally couldn't manage the railroad's problems. The railroad became bankrupt in 1875 and was sold by foreclosure to the bank. It was re-organized as the Ulster and Delaware Railroad later that year.\n\nCornell got the idea for another railroad that would start at the U&D junction in Phoenicia and go up along the Stony Clove Valley to the bustling village of Hunter. He decided to name it the Stony Clove and Catskill Mountain Railroad. Unlike the U & D, it would utilize a narrow gauge which theoretically would be cheaper to build and operate. Construction started on the railroad during 1881, with Cornell's son-in-law, Samuel Decker Coykendall, supervising construction. Originally planned as a summer-only operation serving the Ulster County communities of Phoenicia and Chichester, and the Greene County villages of Lanesville, Edgewood, and Hunter, the service was expanded to year-round operation. In addition to the major stations, there was a flagstop at Stony Clove Notch and a station between the Notch and Hunter called Kaaterskill Junction Station (originally Tannersville Junction Station), at the junction of the Kaaterskill Railway.\n\nThe difference in gauge between the U&D and SC&CM caused difficulties in transferring rolling stock from the mainline. So, in 1882, the two companies installed a Ramsey car-transfer apparatus in the yard at Phoenicia. This device allowed the standard-gauge equipment to be run on the narrow-gauge line. With the apparatus, the transfer only required about eight minutes, saving the railroads much time and money.\n\nIndustries on this line included the William O. Schwartzwalder Furniture Factory, in the company-owned hamlet of Chichester. Other large companies included the Fenwick Lumber Company in Edgewood and the Horatio Lockwood & Company Furniture Factory in Hunter. The railroad was acquired by the U&D in 1892, and these industries now had a new railroad to transport their products.\n\nThe New York Central acquired the U&D in 1932. In its latter years (the early 1950s) one morning train a day (except Sundays) ran on the route from Kingston to Phoenicia and Oneonta and one afternoon train in the east-bound direction from Oneonta back to Kingston. Passenger service on the route ended by the end of 1954.\n\nStarting at Kingston Point, Milepost 0, the Trolley Museum of New York operates the remaining trackage in Kingston east of the CSX River Line, up to about Milepost 2.4. The line in this section is owned by the City of Kingston and leased to the Trolley Museum. The Trolley Museum emphasizes the preservation of the use of trolleys and restoration of the former U&D Rondout Yard. It built a new engine house and shop in 1987, and the idea of rebuilding the utility building and the station has been suggested. The museum currently operates from MP 0, Kingston Point, to MP 1, Rondout Yard, with a branch along the Strand. The track from MP 2.4 to 2.8 has been removed and the right-of-way sold to private parties.\n\nThe line easements \"for railroad purposes\" from Kingston to the Delaware County line are owned by Ulster County, which acquired them from Penn Central in 1979 in lieu of back taxes. The Catskill Mountain Railroad leases this portion from Ulster County for tourist operations between Phoenicia and Cold Brook Station. Trackage between Kingston and Cold Brook was cleared of debris, and is being upgraded between Kingston and Phoenicia; the line is in service from Kingston Plaza to milepost 7.8 and from MP 21.3 (Bridge C30) to 27.9. The Catskill Mountain Railroad commenced operations in Kingston in December 2008. One bridge in need of repair separates the two ends of the railroad at MP 21.3 (Bridge C30). On August 28, 2011, Bridge C30 was washed away due to flooding from Hurricane Irene, severing the Phoenicia operation from the Kingston operation.\n\nThe line between Phoenicia and Highmount, also leased by the Catskill Mountain Railroad, is isolated by six washouts west of Phoenicia, and has not supported a train since regular service ended on October 2, 1976. However, a section of the line between Giggle Hollow and Highmount was cleared of debris in 2006. Another section from Big Indian to Shandaken was cleared in 2009.\n\nThe D&U currently operates tourist trains from Highmount to Roxbury. D&U's operations are limited to the Arkville-Roxbury section as the line to Highmount is out of service due to a weak bridge abutment east of Arkville.\n\nIn Roxbury, the Roxbury Station is being restored by the Ulster & Delaware Railroad Historical Society. Roxbury is the birthplace of railroad baron Jay Gould.\n\nThe Ulster & Delaware Railroad Historical Society owns former New York, Ontario & Western Railway (NYO&W) \"Bobber\" Caboose #8206, built at the NYO&W Middletown Shops in 1906, and former BEDT 14, an H. K. Porter, Inc Locomotive Works 0-6-0T steam locomotive, built in August 1920 at their facility in Pittsburgh. Both are presently being restored by the Society.\n\nThe Delaware County railbed from Highmount to Bloomville, a distance of , is owned by the Catskill Revitalization Corporation. The track ends at Hubbell Corners, where it becomes the Catskill Scenic Trail.\n\nIn Delaware County, the Halcottville Station, MP 53.0, was severed, with the passenger side moved a few hundred feet, where it serves as a shed on private property, and the freight side moved to Arkville, where it is now a tool shed for D&U. Both the Arkville and Fleischmanns stations have been razed, but the freight houses have survived. D&U uses the Arkville freight house as its passenger station. The Kelly's Corners station was acquired by NYSDOT in 1964 and bulldozed during the reconstruction of State Route 30. The station at Stamford has been restored and is owned by the CRC, owners of D&U and used for offices. The stations at South Kortright, MP 81.5, East Meredith, MP 97.9, and Davenport Center, MP 103.2, are currently private dwellings, with the railbed in front of them also being privately owned.\n\nInterstate 88 was planned during the 1970s to extend from Schenectady to Binghamton, New York, although the original plans suggested that it extend to New England and near the Atlantic Coast. The portion that was constructed covers a portion of the U&D's railbed in the town of Oneonta, where it connects with New York State Route 28.\n\nThe South Gilboa Station, MP 70.6, is the only station on the remainder of the U&D, and it is in poor condition. It is still in its original spot, between the Delaware County stations of Grand Gorge and Stamford. The old right-of-way in front of it is part of the Catskill Scenic Trail. It is also one of two U&D railroad stations that is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Town of Gilboa Historical Society has proposed that the South Gilboa station should have a full cosmetic restoration. However, this is only a proposal, and it is unknown whether or not it will occur.\n\nThe final station at Oneonta, MP 106.9, was part of a tourist line called the \"Delaware and Otsego Railroad\" that was created soon after that portion was abandoned, during the late 1960s. It ran trains from Oneonta station to a bridge that crossed Charlotte Creek a little way from the old site of the West Davenport Station. It is currently a pub/restaurant called \"The Depot\". The line from Bloomville, MP 86.2, to Oneonta, MP 107, was abandoned in 1965, with rails removed in 1967, and is currently owned by private owners (mostly abutting landowners).\n\nThe Greene County portion of the branches, which were torn up in 1940, along with the smaller portion of the branches in Ulster County, remain as overgrown paths and bridge abutments, with an occasional road covering the right of way. New York State Route 214 overlaps the former alignment at Stony Clove Notch. However, a section of the line from Bloomer Road to Clum Hill Road in Tannersville has been converted into a rail trail, known locally as the \"Huckleberry Trail\". There are also a few bridge piers, such as one on the southern side of Esopus Creek in Phoenicia, one in Chichester (both in Ulster County), and two in Edgewood.\n\nThere are only two surviving stations on what used to be the branches. The Hunter Station, branch MP 2.5, is now a private dwelling. The Haines Falls Station, branch MP 18.5, is currently the headquarters of the Mountain Top Historical Society.\n\nThe coaches that ran on the Narrow Gauge Division had been built by Jackson & Sharp Co. in 1881 and 1883. Between August 1899 & June 1900, they were sold to F. M. Hicks & Co. of Chicago, Illinois. In May 1901, Hicks resold four of the coaches to the White Pass and Yukon Route (WP&YR ##218, 220, 222, and 224). Under White Pass ownership, these cars have been rebuilt several times. They remain in operation. After all of the rebuildings under White Pass ownership, about all that remains of the original cars are the architecture and the superstructure frames.\n\n"}

The Basilica venerates Blessed Virgin Mary, under her title Our Lady of the Pillar praised as \"Mother of the Hispanic Peoples\" by Pope John Paul II. It is reputed to be the first church dedicated to Mary in history.\n\nLocal traditions take the history of this basilica to the dawn of Christianity in Spain attributing to an apparition to Saint James the Great, the apostle who is believed by tradition to have brought Christianity to the country. This is the only reported apparition of Mary to have occurred before her believed Assumption.\n\nMany of the kings of Spain, many other foreign rulers and saints have paid their devotion before this statue of Mary. Saint John of the Cross, Saint Teresa of Ávila, Saint Ignatius of Loyola, and Blessed William Joseph Chaminade are among the foremost ones.\nThe Basilica of Our Lady of the Pillar is one of two minor basilicas in the city of Zaragoza, and is co-cathedral of the city alongside the nearby La Seo de Zaragoza. The architecture is of Baroque style, and the present building was predominantly built between 1681 and 1872.\n\nAccording to ancient local tradition, soon after the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus, Saint James was preaching the Gospel in Spain, but was disheartened because of the failure of his mission. Tradition holds that on 2 January 40 AD, while he was deep in prayer by the banks of the Ebro, the Mother of God appeared to him and gave a column of jasper and instructed him to build a church in her honor: \"This place is to be my house, and this image and column shall be the title and altar of the temple that you shall build.\"\n\nAbout a year after the apparition, James is believed to have had a small chapel built in Mary's honor, the first church ever dedicated to her. After James returned to Jerusalem, he was executed by Herod Agrippa in about 44 AD, the first apostle to be martyred for his faith. Several of his disciples took his body and returned it for final burial in Spain.\nThis first chapel was eventually destroyed with various other Christian shrines, but the statue and the pillar stayed intact under the protection of the people of Zaragoza.\n\nNumerous churches have been built upon this site through the years. The tiny chapel built by Saint James later gave way to a basilicalike enclosure during Constantine I's time; subsequently being transformed into Romanesque, then Gothic then Mudéjar styles. The venerated shrines at Zaragoza date to the Christian Reconquest by King Alfonso I in 1118. A church in the Romanesque style was built under the pontificate of Pedro de Librana who is also credited with the oldest written testimonial to the Virgin at Zaragoza. A tympanum on the south wall of this Romanesque church still stands.\n\nThe Romanesque church was damaged by fire in 1434, and reconstruction began in the Mudéjar Gothic style. A Gothic-style church was built in the 15th century but only a few parts of it remain intact or were later restored, including the choir stand and the altarpiece in alabaster by Damián Forment.\n\nThe present spacious church in Baroque style was begun in 1681 by Charles II, King of Spain and completed in 1686. The early constructions were supervised by Felipe Sanchez and were later modified by Francisco Herrera the Younger under John of Austria the Younger. In 1725, the Cabildo of Zaragoza decided to change the aspect of the Holy Chapel and commissioned the architect Ventura Rodríguez, who transformed the building into its present dimensions of 130 meters long by 67 wide, with its eleven cupolas and four towers. The area most visited is the eastern part of the chapel, because this is where the Holy Chapel by Ventura Rodríguez (1754) is built, which houses the venerated image of the Virgin. Around the Holy Chapel are the vaults or domes painted with frescoes by Francisco Goya: \"The Queen of Martyrs\" and \"Adoration of the Name of God\". By 1718 the church had been vaulted over. However, it was not until 1872 that the final touches were put to these vaults, when the main dome and the final spire were finished.\n\nDuring the Spanish Civil War of 1936–1939 three bombs were dropped on the church but none of them exploded. Two of them are still on show in the Basilica.\n\nNotable choirmasters include the Baroque composer Joseph Ruiz Samaniego.\n\nThe statue is wooden and 39 cm tall and rests on a column of jasper.\nThe tradition of the shrine of El Pilar, as given by Our Lady in an apparition to Sister Mary Agreda and written about in \"The Mystical City of God\", is that Our Lady was carried on a cloud by the angels to Zaragoza during the night. While they were traveling, the angels built a pillar of marble, and a miniature image of Our Lady. Our Lady gave the message to St James and added that a church was to be built on the site where the apparition took place. The pillar and the image were to be part of the main altar. The image was crowned in 1905 with a crown designed by the Marquis of Griñi, and valued at 450,000 pesetas (£18,750, 1910).\n\nThe building, which can be seen from the nearby Ebro River, is a large rectangle with a nave and two aisles, with two other all-brick chapels, thus giving the whole a typically Aragonese touch. It is illuminated by large oculi, characteristic of the monuments of the region from the 17th century onwards. Twelve enormous pillars support the vaults of the nave and aisles; the whole is topped by domes, as are the chapels.\n\nThe chapels within the Basilica include:\n\nThe first organ was built in 1463 by Enrique de Colonia. In 1537, Martín de Córdoba built another organ with the intent to compete with the one at the La Seo.\n\nGuillermo de Lupe and his son Gaudioso restructured the larger organ between 1595 and 1602; he had done the same for an organ in the Cathedral of the Savior of Zaragoza in 1577.\n\nIn 1657, there were several organs in the church, of many sizes and offering many possibilities. As a result, the musical activity reached a peak in the Spanish Golden Age; however, it began to decline toward the end of the 19th century.\n\nIn the Middle Ages, a minstrel accompanied singers with a dulcian. Polyphony in the Cathedral-Basilica of Our Lady of the Pillar was first documented in the mid-17th century, played by a \"tenor\" and a \"contrabajón\". In the late 1600s, an orchestra composed of minstrels agreed to work for the Church of Santa María la Mayor, the predecessor of the Cathedral-Basilica.\n\nThe feast of Our Lady of the Pillar, celebrating the first apparition of Mary to Hispanic people, is on October 12. This coincides with the Día de la Hispanidad and the date of Columbus's discovery of the New World. Every nation of Hispanic colonial origin has donated national vestments for the fifteenth-century statue of the Virgin, which is housed in the chapel. Pope John Paul II praised El Pilar as \"Mother of the Hispanic Peoples\" during both his visits to the Basilica.\n\nIt was declared \"Bien de Interés Cultural\" in 1904.\n\n\n"}

Kent, is a Professor in the Department of Sociology at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. He researches new religious movements, and has published research on several such groups including the Children of God (also known as The Family), the Church of Scientology, and newer faiths operating in Canada.\n\nKent graduated from the University of Maryland, College Park in 1973, with a B.A. degree in Sociology and a minor in Social and Political Theory In 1978, he was awarded a Master's Degree in the History of Religions, from American University. Kent was also awarded an M.A. in 1980 from McMaster University with a focus in religion and modern Western society and a minor in Indian Buddhism; he was granted a Ph.D. in religious studies in 1984 from the same institution. From 1984 to 1986, Kent held an Izaac Walton Killam Postdoctoral Fellowship in the sociology department at the University of Alberta.\n\nJohn H. Simpson writes in a chapter of Lori G. Beaman's 2006 book \"Religion and Canadian Society\" that Kent \"finds himself on the cult side of the cult/new religious movement divide.\" Simpson recommends Kent for further reading on the group Children of God, also referred to as \"The Family\", and notes: \"He has done extensive research on new religious movements and argues that we need to be careful about minimizing the risks of involvement with such groups. His work is a good example of the issues taken up by scholars who focus on 'cults.'\" Kent has devoted significant study to the Children of God, and the group's founder David Berg. He has researched testimony of individuals that have alleged Satanic ritual abuse, in a period from the 1930s to 1980s. Kevin J. Christiano notes in the book \"Sociology of Religion: Contemporary Developments\" that Kent's research \"shows that the Bible and biblical themes provide the primary references for the articulation of abuse\", noting that \"purported cult ceremonies particularly used biblical references and metaphors.\" Irving Hexham commented about Kent in a 2001 article in \"Nova Religio\", \"The one exception to the generally neutral tone of Canadian academics and their rejection of anticult rhetoric is Stephen Kent, who has been outspoken in his criticism of many new religions, particularly Scientology, and who works closely with various anticult groups. Although Kent's views are widely known, few Canadian academics agree with his findings and most disagree quite strongly because of his tendency to use the testimony of ex-members.\" Sociologist Anson Shupe and Susan J. Darnell characterised Kent as \"eccentric\", stating that research and police enquiries into the allegations of satanic ritual human sacrifice had proved them to be unfounded. Criminologist Michael Salter, however, views Kent's work on ritual abuse more favorably.\nWith fellow sociologist Theresa Krebs, Kent has written about instances of \"when scholars know sin\". In their book \"Denying History\", authors Michael Shermer and Alex Grobman note \"Sociologists are aware of the problem of a researcher's 'co-option' by a group–a cult or New Age religion, perhaps– whereby the scholar, in entering a group and spending considerable time with its members, publishes a paper or book that is not as objective as he or she may believe.\" Shermer and Grobman cite Kent and Krebs' work, commenting \"In fact, the sociologists Stephen Kent and Theresa Krebs have identified numerous cases of 'when scholars know sin,' where allegedly nonpartisan, unbiased scholars find themselves the unwitting tools of religious groups striving for social acceptance and in need of the imprimatur of an academic.\"\n\nKent's research of Scientology has focused on its organization, the Rehabilitation Project Force (RPF). His extensive study of Scientology's history and practices led him to conclude that as a result of relatively young people becoming involved with the organization in the 1960-70s, some 2nd-generation Scientologist children have left the group in \"waves\". Kent has commented to the media about Scientology's RPF, and Scientology's \"Ethics\" system, as well as its affiliated organization Narconon. He has published articles concerning Scientology and Hollywood, and commented that Scientology uses celebrities as \"public relations officers for Scientology, and part of their mission is to represent Scientology to the outside world and to other governments.\" According to \"CBS News\" \"He's considered one of the foremost experts on Scientology. But inside the church, he's considered an anti-religious extremist who has been paid to testify against the church in court.\" The Editor-in-Chief of \"The Village Voice\" referred to Kent as an academic \"who studies Scientology in depth\", and the \"St. Petersburg Times\" referred to Kent as \"an expert on the group\". Kent has testified as an expert witness for parties suing organizations affiliated with Scientology, and subsequently Scientologists picketed outside of his University of Alberta office. Religious studies scholar J. Gordon Melton and Church of Scientology spokesperson Leisa Goodman have both questioned the accuracy of Kent's scholarship. Kent responded to both critics, noting their breaches of ethics and poor research practices.\n\nSociologist Lorne Dawson has criticized Kent's work for his use of ex-member testimony. In response to Dawsons and other critics who have issues with ex-member testimony, Kent argues that former member accounts provide outsider insights not available to members who misattribute divine authority to leaders in high demand religious groups Additionally, the methodological considerations raised by Dawson do not end at ex-member testimony, given that much of his critique was \"prepared at the request of the Church of Scientology\" as part of his employment as an expert witness. Relying on member testimony raises the important issue of how researchers' sympathies influence their work. As part of their response to a general call for a critical sociology of religion, Thomas J. Josephsohn and Rhys H. Williams argue that sociology of religion's focus on the beneficial aspects of religion has tended to ignore \"some significant and darker aspects of religion such as violence, terrorism, prejudice, and social closure\".\n\nKent's book \"From Slogans to Mantras: Social Protest and Religious Conversion in the Late Vietnam Era\" was published in 2001 by Syracuse University Press. In the book, Kent explored how political activists from the period of the Vietnam War later turned to alternative religious movements including Hare Krishnas, Transcendental Meditation, Scientology, and the Unification Church. In 2003 it was cited by \"Choice\" as an outstanding academic title that should be owned by every library.\n\n\"Publishers Weekly\" described \"From Slogans to Mantras\" as a \"lucid and economical study\", noting that Kent had examined the convergence between the interest of American youth in radical politics and protest and the pursuit of \"unusual, cultish, spiritual traditions.\" James A. Overbeck wrote in \"Library Journal\" that the work is recommended for academic and public libraries, mentioning that Kent utilized personal narratives and alternative press in the book. Doni Whitsett reviewed the book in \"Cultic Studies Review\", writing that it contained informative content, and is an easy read free of sociological jargon which made it more accessible to non-expert readers. However, Whitsett also stated that it would have been interesting to compare those who did not choose the route of the ex-members described in the book and to analyze the differences inherent in these two subsets of individuals. Jill K. Gill reviewed the book in \"Humanities and Social Sciences Online\" and also commented on its readability, stating that it was succinctly written and engaging.\n\nPeter W. Williams reviewed the book in \"The Journal of American History\" and provided a less positive review, saying that the book was a \"mildly interesting and useful footnote to the sixties\" but that he wished the book had gone further than that. Massimo Introvigne, president of pro-NRM advocacy group CESNUR also gave the work a critical review for what he described as \"the author's well-known harsh criticism of NRMs\" (new religious movements).\n\nIn 2003, Kent's book \"From Slogans to Mantras\" was cited by \"\" as an \"Outstanding Academic Title\" that should be owned by every library. Kent was recognized by his students at the University of Alberta in 2009. He received a \"Graduate Student Supervisor Award\" from the Graduate Students' Association on March 12, 2009. In April 2010, Kent received the \"Bill Meloff Memorial Teaching Award\" given by the Department of Sociology at the University of Alberta. He stated he would utilize the US$ 1,000 award to \"update the department's DVD collections in the sociology of deviance and the sociology of religion\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The railway was completed in 1928, and links the towns of George and Knysna in the Western Cape, South Africa. The scenic route took 3 hours, following the rugged coastline of the Garden Route, passing through Victoria Bay, Wilderness, Goukamma, and Sedgefield before ending by crossing a bridge over the lagoon in Knysna. \n\nIt was declared an officially preserved railway in 1992, carrying about 40,000 passengers per year at the time. A decade later, it carried 115,000 passengers per year, 70% of whom were foreign tourists.\n\nThe trains were usually pulled by SAR Class 19D steam locomotives, of 4-8-2 wheel arrangement with Vanderbilt-like \"torpedo\" tenders, although SAR Class 24 steam engines were also used occasionally. When dry conditions in the summer increase the risk of wildfires, diesel locomotives (SAR Class 32s) were used instead.\n\nDuring August 2006 the line was damaged due to heavy flooding. As of November 2006 it was rescheduled to run between George and Mossel Bay (with a stop at Hartenbos).\n\nIn 2007, the train's owners, Transnet Limited, announced that the train was not regarded as part of its core business, and initiated a tender process to dispose of the train to a new owner/operator. In August 2010, Transnet announced that they had not found an operator, and the train would cease operating. The Western Cape Provincial MEC for Finance, Economic Development and Tourism, Alan Winde, said that he was resolved to keep this heritage tourism asset operational. \n\n, the line is still closed. In May 2018 after a miniature steam locomotive mounted to a trolley crossed the causeway into Knysna in February 2018, it was revealed in the British Magazine \"Heritage Railway\" that while there is ongoing discussion between Transnet and a private enterprise called \"Classic Rail\" there remains no agreement to franchise the line and re-open it for tourist traffic.\n\nIn 2008, the train and the Kaaiman's River Bridge were featured in a television advertisement for Stella Artois.\n\n"}

She is considered as one of the best present-day female singers in Mainland China, having sold more than 10 million albums. She is also noted for her buoyant and forthright personality. She has been a judge of Chinese TV singing shows such as \"The Voice of China\".\n\nNa was born in Shenyang, Liaoning. She is an ethnic Manchu, a descendant of the noble Yehe Nara clan of the Qing dynasty. She became a member of the Liaoning Juvenile Broadcasting Chorus in 1979, and the Shenyang Singing and Dancing Troupe in 1983. Na won several national singing contests in the 1980s, and received vocal training from the famous composer Gu Jianfen ().\n\nNa's father was a doctor, and wanted Na to have a good education and become a doctor when she grew up. However, Na exhibited a natural talent for singing, and was determined to become a singer instead.\n\nNa began her recording career in 1988 in Taiwan and Hong Kong. In 1991 she released her first album entitled \"A single woman like me\" (), which had a very moderate reception. Two years later, in 1993, she released a new album called \"I hope my dreams come true\" () which was not very popular either.\n\nShe released her first major album \"Dreaming With You\", in 1994. Following the release of that album, she released several additional albums, becoming one of the most popular Mandarin-language artists of Mainland China.\n\nAt the 1998 \"Spring Festival Gala\" show hosted by CCTV, Na sang a duet \"Meet in '98\" () with Faye Wong. Wong had already achieved fame in Hong Kong and elsewhere, but the performance with Na brought her to superstar status in China itself.\n\nNa had a relationship with Chinese footballer Gao Feng and a son by him, they separated in 2005. She married Meng Tong in 2006, and they had a daughter in 2007.\n\nAlthough she devoted time to her family and children from 2002 to 2009, she never quit the stage, and had a prominent role at the closing ceremony of the Beijing 2008 Summer Olympics.\n\nAt the close of 2009 she performed the concert \"20 Years of Na\", a retrospective of her stage career, at the Capital Gymnasium. Although her 2009 single \"The Journey of Love\" topped the charts wherever it was released, her early song \"Follow Your Instinct\" remains her favourite.\n\nAfter a hiatus of nearly nine years, Na returned to the music scene in 2011, releasing a new album called \"So... What?\". The album reached the number one position on both the mainland China and Taiwan album charts.\n\nIn 2012, Na became a coach and judge on the first season of the popular television singing show \"The Voice of China\", along with Yang Kun, Liu Huan and Yu Chengqing. She returned to the judges panel in 2013 for \"the show's second season\", along with Wang Feng, Zhang Hui-mei and Yu Chengqing. Na continued being a judge on the third and fourth season of that show with Wang Feng, Yang Kun, Zhou Jielun and Yu Chengqing.\n\nIn 2016, Na appeared on the first season of the show \"Sing!

The team was also the first baseball club to visit the White House in 1865 at the invitation of President Andrew Johnson.\n\nEstablished on August 14, 1855, Atlantic was a founding member of the National Association of Base Ball Players in 1857. In 1859, with a record of 11 wins and 1 loss, Atlantic emerged as the recognized champions of baseball. Atlantic held the championship through the 1861 season, albeit in controversial fashion. In a third and deciding game with Excelsior of Brooklyn, Excelsior was leading 8–6 and had men on base, but was forced to withdraw by a rowdy crowd of Atlantic partisans and gamblers. The game was declared a draw, and the championship retained by Atlantic.\n\nAtlantic held the championship again through the 1861 season, which was shortened due to the American Civil War, before finally surrendering it to archrival Eckford of Brooklyn in 1862. Atlantic recaptured the pennant in 1866 with a season record of twenty wins, no defeats, and a single tie as the only blemish on its record. \n\nAtlantic went undefeated in 1865 with an 18–0 record, sweeping series against chief rivals Mutual of New York and Athletic of Philadelphia. Great players of this era included Joe Start, Dickey Pearce, Charlie Smith, Fred Crane, and Tom Pratt. Atlantic's 36-game winning streak was finally broken in June, 1866 by Irvington, NJ. Atlantic retained the pennant that year by splitting a two-game series with Athletic of Philadelphia and declining to schedule a series with Union of Morrisania. Atlantic did surrender the title to Union in 1867.\n\nWhen Atlantic defeated Eckford to regain the pennant in 1869, Atlantic had already lost to the Cincinnati Red Stockings. This allowed Atlantic to claim the championship over the undefeated Cincinnati club under the \"challenge\" format of the National Association of Base Ball Players, which resembled modern boxing championship rules rather than a league or tournament format. This outcome undoubtedly contributed to the tremendous anticipation when Cincinnati came to Brooklyn with an 89-game winning streak to meet the Atlantics on June 14, 1870 at Atlantic's home Capitoline Grounds. An estimated crowd of fifteen thousand paid 50 cents a piece to see Atlantic win 8–7 in extra innings in one of the most significant games in baseball history. Atlantic surrendered the title later in the year, though, to Mutual.\n\nAfter the 1865 season, the Atlantics became the first baseball team to visit the White House. Arthur Gorman, one of the founders of the Washington Nationals Base Ball Club and an acquaintance of President Andrew Johnson, organized a tournament featuring his team, the Athletic Base Ball Club of Philadelphia and the Atlantics. Philadelphia refused to play in the final game as they would not receive any of the gate revenue and left. Having known President Johnson since his days as a page in the United States Senate, Gorman offered to take the visiting team to the White House to meet the President. Brooklyn accepted and visited on August 30, 1865.\n\nAtlantic had been among the first clubs to declare themselves professional when allowed to do so in 1869. However, when the major professional clubs formed the National Association of Professional Base Ball Players in 1871, Atlantic declined to field a team. As a result, their best players, including George Zettlein, Bob Ferguson, Joe Start and Lip Pike, jumped to other clubs.\n\nWhen Atlantic did join the professional circuit in 1872, it was unable to reestablish itself as a leading club, suffering losing records in each of its four seasons in the league. Atlantic was not invited to join the National League when that circuit was formed in 1876, but continued to play an independent schedule until at least 1882.\n\nA remnant Atlantic was invited to join the upstart American Association in 1882 but failed to satisfy the requirements for doing so. For many years afterwards, the term \"Atlantic batting\" referred to a big inning, especially late in the game.\n\nSource for season records: Wright (2000) has published records for dozens of NABBP teams each season, relying on a mix of game and season records in contemporary newspapers and guides. Dozens of leading clubs by number of matches are included, as are many others. The records do not consistently cover either all games played or all championship matches between NABBP members.\n\n\nThe 1865 Atlantics are said to have been on the first ever baseball card. The only known card was archived at the Library of Congress since the 1880s, when the photographer Charles Williamson submitted the photo for copyright. It remained the only copy of this \"card\" known to exist until 2013, when another card was found in an old photo album at a yard sale. The 148-year-old team photo was sold to an unnamed bidder for $92,000.00 when it went up for auction on February 6, 2013 in Maine.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2123122", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2123122", "title": "Freeway service patrol", "text": "Freeway service patrol\n\nA freeway service patrol (motorist assistance patrol, roadway service patrol, safety service patrol, highway assistance patrol, or a courtesy patrol) is a variety of programs implemented by government agencies, typically state Highway Patrols or Departments of Transportation, to reduce traffic congestion and improve highway safety by having specially marked and equipped vehicles patrol designated sections of roadway and provide incident management and motorist assistance at trouble spots they encounter. In some states, the program name is the generic term, as with California's Freeway Service Patrol; in others, the program has an individualized name, as with Indiana's Hoosier Helper program.\n\nFreeway service patrols are typically incorporated into a city or region's intelligent transportation system if it has one, and the United States Department of Transportation has included them as a market package in the National ITS Architecture, designated EM04. That designation emphasizes the role that these patrols can serve in incident or emergency management.\n\nThe first freeway service patrol in the United States with continuous regular operations was started in 1960 in Chicago, Illinois. In 1998 the Texas Transportation Institute conducted a study of 54 freeway service patrols in the United States and found that approximately 64% had been started since 1990. \n\nDespite freeway service patrols' inclusion in the National ITS Architecture, and their increasingly widespread use, there has been no standardization as to how they are operated. Their scope, in terms of number of vehicles on patrol, operating hours, and mileage patrolled, can vary widely. The patrol may operate only during peak hours, with only 30 or 40 operating hours per week, or may operate all 168 hours during a week, as the West Virginia Courtesy Patrol once did. Likewise, the sort of vehicle used in the patrol varies, but may include light-duty pickup trucks, heavy-duty trucks, minivans, or wreckers. In all cases, the vehicle will be marked as a part of the freeway service patrol, and in some states a freeway service patrol vehicle is legally defined as an emergency vehicle. Variation also exists in the role that the agency or agencies responsible for a patrol plays in its operations. For instance, California's Freeway Service Patrol program consists of privately owned and operated wreckers that have contracts with the state, whereas Georgia's HERO program is run directly by the Georgia Department of Transportation: its vehicles are state property and its operators state employees.\n\nThe variation in freeway service patrol operating characteristics may be considered an example of form follows function, reflecting the relative importance each program assigns to such goals as motorist assistance, incident management, and traffic control. In general, though, the purpose of a freeway service patrol is to use rapid response to reduce traffic congestion. Like many ITS technologies, they are considered a much more cost-effective method to do that than highway construction, especially in metropolitan areas where land for highway expansion is either unavailable or prohibitively expensive. Using such methods as assigning a dollar value to drivers' time and to the exhaust emissions of vehicles stuck in traffic, studies through the early and mid 1990s estimated the benefit-cost ratio for some freeway service patrols may be as high as 36.2:1. Freeway service patrols are also seen as a way to develop goodwill towards the community in which they operate and the government responsible for them.\n\nAlthough motorist surveys reveal that programs, once in place, are extremely popular with the general public, proposed freeway service patrols have met opposition from various groups. Most recently, a proposed freeway service patrol in Hawaii has been placed on hiatus due to objections from a private tow truck company. The towing and recovery industry has been the source of opposition to previous proposals for freeway service patrols, as have small-government advocates.\n"}
{"id": "2123123", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2123123", "title": "Characterizations of the category of topological spaces", "text": "Characterizations of the category of topological spaces\n\nIn mathematics, a topological space is usually defined in terms of open sets. However, there are many equivalent characterizations of the category of topological spaces. Each of these definitions provides a new way of thinking about topological concepts, and many of these have led to further lines of inquiry and generalisation.\n\nFormally, each of the following definitions defines a concrete category, and every pair of these categories can be shown to be \"concretely isomorphic\". This means that for every pair of categories defined below, there is an isomorphism of categories, for which corresponding objects have the same underlying set and corresponding morphisms are identical as set functions.\n\nTo actually establish the concrete isomorphisms is more tedious than illuminating. The simplest approach is probably to construct pairs of inverse concrete isomorphisms between each category and the category of topological spaces Top. This would involve the following:\n\n\n\"Objects\": all topological spaces, i.e., all pairs (\"X\",\"T\") of set \"X\" together with a collection \"T\" of subsets of \"X\" satisfying:\n\n\n\"Morphisms\": all ordinary continuous functions, i.e. all functions such that the inverse image of every open set is open.\n\n\"Comments\": This is the ordinary category of topological spaces.\n\n\"Objects\": all pairs (\"X\",\"T\") of set \"X\" together with a collection \"T\" of subsets of \"X\" satisfying:\n\n\n\"Morphisms\": all functions such that the inverse image of every closed set is closed.\n\n\"Comments\": This is the category that results by replacing each lattice of open sets in a topological space by its order-theoretic dual of closed sets, the lattice of complements of open sets. The relation between the two definitions is given by De Morgan's laws.\n\n\"Objects\": all pairs (\"X\",cl) of set \"X\" together with a closure operator cl : \"P\"(\"X\") → \"P\"(\"X\") satisfying the Kuratowski closure axioms:\n\n\n\"Morphisms\": all \"closure-preserving functions\", i.e., all functions \"f\" between two closure spaces\n\nsuch that for all subsets formula_6 of formula_7\n\n\"Comments\": The Kuratowski closure axioms abstract the properties of the closure operator on a topological space, which assigns to each subset its topological closure. This topological closure operator has been generalized in category theory; see \"Categorical Closure Operators\" by G. Castellini in \"Categorical Perspectives\", referenced below.\n\nSimilar to the Kuratowski closure axioms approach, one can also define a topological space as a set formula_7 together with a relation formula_10 between points and subsets (formula_11 intuitively expresses that using the elements of formula_6 one can get arbitrarily close to formula_13) satisfying\n\n\"Objects\": all pairs (\"X\",int) of set \"X\" together with an interior operator int : \"P\"(\"X\") → \"P\"(\"X\") satisfying the following dualisation of the Kuratowski closure axioms:\n\n\n\"Morphisms\": all \"interior-preserving functions\", i.e., all functions \"f\" between two interior spaces\n\nsuch that for all subsets formula_6 of formula_31\n\n\"Comments\": The interior operator assigns to each subset its topological interior, in the same way the closure operator assigns to each subset its topological closure.\n\n\"Objects\": all pairs (\"X\",\"N\") of set \"X\" together with a neighbourhood function \"N\" : \"X\" → \"F\"(\"X\"), where \"F\"(\"X\") denotes the set of all filters on \"X\", satisfying for every \"x\" in \"X\":\n\n\n\"Morphisms\": all \"neighbourhood-preserving functions\", i.e., all functions \"f\" : (\"X\", \"N\") → (\"Y\", \"N\"') such that if \"V\" is in \"N\"(\"f\"(\"x\")), then there exists \"U\" in \"N\"(\"x\") such that \"f\"(\"U\") is contained in \"V\". This is equivalent to asking that whenever \"V\" is in \"N\"(\"f\"(\"x\")), then \"f\"(\"V\") is in \"N\"(\"x\").\n\n\"Comments\": This definition axiomatizes the notion of neighbourhood. We say that \"U\" is a neighbourhood of \"x\" if \"U\" is in \"N\"(\"x\"). The open sets can be recovered by declaring a set to be open if it is a neighbourhood of each of its points; the final axiom then states that every neighbourhood contains an open set. These axioms (coupled with the Hausdorff condition) can be retraced to Felix Hausdorff's original definition of a topological space in Grundzüge der Mengenlehre.\n\nThe category of topological spaces can also be defined via a convergence relation between filters on \"X\" and points of \"x\". This definition demonstrates that convergence of filters can be viewed as a fundamental topological notion. A topology in the usual sense can be recovered by declaring a set \"A\" to be closed if, whenever \"F\" is a filter on \"A\", then \"A\" contains all points to which \"F\" converges.\n\nSimilarly, the category of topological spaces can also be described via net convergence. As for filters, this definition shows that convergence of nets can be viewed as a fundamental topological notion.

In a career that spanned more than 50 years, she portrayed acerbic maids, secretaries, teachers, busybodies, nurses, and battle-axe neighbors and relatives, almost invariably to comic effect.\n\nFreeman was born in Chicago. She began her career as a child, dancing in her parents' vaudeville act. After a stint studying music at the University of California, Los Angeles, she went into acting full-time, working on the stage, and finally entering films in 1948. In 1946, she was a founding member of the Circle Players at The Circle Theatre, now known as El Centro Theatre. Freeman was a Democrat who supported Adlai Stevenson during the 1952 presidential election.\n\nFreeman made her film debut in \"Wild Harvest\" (1947). Freeman's most notable early role was an uncredited part in the 1952 musical \"Singin' in the Rain\" as Jean Hagen's diction coach Phoebe Dinsmore.\n\nBeginning with the 1954 film \"3 Ring Circus\", Freeman became a favorite foil of Jerry Lewis, playing opposite him in 11 films. These included most of Lewis's better known comedies, including \"The Disorderly Orderly\" as Nurse Higgins, \"The Errand Boy\" as the studio boss's wife, and especially \"The Nutty Professor\" as Millie Lemon. Over 30 years later, she made a brief appearance in \"\".\n\nOther film roles included appearances in \"The Missouri Traveler\" (1958), the horror film \"The Fly\" (1958), the Western spoofs \"Support Your Local Sheriff!\" (1969) and \"Support Your Local Gunfighter\" (1971), and appearances in a spate of comedies in the 1980s and 1990s. Freeman played Sister Mary Stigmata (referred to as The Penguin) in John Landis' \"The Blues Brothers\" and \"Blues Brothers 2000\", had cameos in Joe Dante's \"Innerspace\" and \"\" (as tipsy cooking host Microwave Marge), as a foul-mouthed apartment building manager in Dragnet and a gangster mother in \"\".\n\nIn addition to teaching acting classes in Los Angeles, Freeman was a familiar presence on television. In 1958–59, she appeared three times on \"Buckskin\", a children's program set in a hotel in a fictitious Montana town. She appeared from the 1950s until her death in regular or recurring roles on many sitcoms, including six episodes of \"The Bob Cummings Show\" (as Bertha Krause), \"Topper\" (as Katie the maid), and \"The Donna Reed Show\" (as Mrs. Celia Wilgus, the Stones' busybody next door neighbor). In 1964 she appeared in 5 episodes of \"The Lucy Show\". Later, she was cast on \"Hogan's Heroes\" as Frau Gertrude Linkmeyer, General Burkhalter's sister, who longed to wed Colonel Klink. In 1973, she had a co-starring role with Dom DeLuise in the sitcom \"Lotsa Luck\" (based on the British sitcom \"On the Buses\"). \n\nShe appeared in several episodes of \"Wagon Train\", \"Funny Face\" (as Mrs. Kate Harwell), \"I Dream of Jeannie\" (as a grouchy supervisor in a fantasy preview of Major Nelson's future, and later as a hillbilly), the short-lived prehistoric sitcom \"It's About Time\" (as Mrs. Boss), and as the voice of Peg Bundy's mom, an unseen character on \"Married... with Children\". She played a female arm wrestler on \"Mama's Family\". \n\nFreeman played Sgt Carter’s mother in a 1969 episode of \"Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.\", as well as appearing as a different character in a 1968 episode of the same series. She also starred with Phil Silvers in \"The Beverly Hillbillies\" in episodes 25 and 26 of season 8 and episodes 2 and 3 in season 9. She also made a first season appearance playing the wife of a couple who take the Clampetts to court, falsely accusing them of reckless driving and causing injuries to the couple (Season 1, Episode 32).\n\nShe remained active in her last two years with a regular voice role on \"As Told by Ginger\", a voice bit in the animated feature film \"Shrek\", and a guest appearance on the sitcom \"Becker.\" She received a Tony Award nomination and a Theatre World Award for her role as Jeannette Burmeister in the musical version of \"The Full Monty\". In her final episode of \"As Told by Ginger\", Season 2's \"No Hope for Courtney\", Freeman's character retires from her teaching job although Carl and Hoodsey try convincing her to return to work. The script originally was written to have Mrs. Gordon return to Lucky Elementary School but Freeman died before the episode was finished. The script was then re-written, and Mrs. Gordon died as well. The episode was dedicated in Freeman's memory. The dedication came at the end of the episode after the announcement that Elaine Gordon had died and Carl was crying. The screen faded to black and a title card said \"In Memory of Kathleen Freeman\".\n\nWeakened by illness, Freeman was forced to leave the \"Full Monty\" cast. Five days later, she died of lung cancer at age 82 at Lenox Hill Hospital. She was cremated and her ashes interred in a niche at Hollywood Forever Cemetery. She never married and she had no children. British reports of her death mentioned her long-time companion Helen Ramsey, but U.S. obituaries did not.\n\n"}

{"id": "2123140", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2123140", "title": "Illustrations of the rule against perpetuities", "text": "Illustrations of the rule against perpetuities\n\nThe fertile octogenarian and the unborn widow are two legal fictions from the law of real property (and trusts) that can be used either to invoke the rule against perpetuities to make an interest in property void or, alternatively and much more frequently, to demonstrate the seemingly bizarre results that can occur as a result of the rule. The rule itself, simply stated, makes a future interest in property void if it can be logically proven that there is some possibility of the interest not vesting or failing within 21 years after the end of a life in being at the time the interest is created. \n\nThe fertile octogenarian is a fictitious character that comes up when applying the rule against perpetuities. The rule presumes that anyone, even an octogenarian (i.e., someone between 80 and 90 years of age) can parent a child, regardless of sex or health. For instance, suppose that a will devises a piece of land known as Blackacre \"to A for her life, and then to the first of A's children to reach 25 years of age.\" A is, at the time the will is probated, an 85-year-old woman. In applying the rule against perpetuities, an imaginative lawyer will argue (and a court must accept under the common law rule itself) that A could have a child in her 86th year and then in her 87th year all of A's other children could die, then in her 88th year A herself could die. Because the interest will not vest until her new child reaches 25 years of age, which cannot happen until more than 21 years after A and her other children (together who form the \"lives in being\" to which the rule refers) have all died, the rule against perpetuities makes the entire gift \"to the first of A's children to reach 25 years of age\" void. A will hold Blackacre for life, and then the property will revert to the person whose will transferred it to A in the first place. (Actually, it will go to that person's estate, since the will was probated only after his death.)\n\nWhile it is true that there is often no statutory maximum age limit to perform an adoption, and adopted children are often treated the same as natural children, so an 86-year-old woman who adopts a newborn child is legally in the same position as an 86-year-old woman who gives birth, the fertile octogenarian rule predates the laws allowing legal adoption.\n\nThe legal fiction of the fertile octogenarian assumes that a living person, regardless of sex, age, or physical condition, will always be capable of having more children, thus allowing an interest to vest 21 years after all the lives in being at the time of the grant are dead. Couples have been known to marry in their late eighties.\n\nIn certain places this assumption will be limited to a fixed age set by statute. Furthermore, many jurisdictions have discarded old common-law fictions such as the \"fertile octogenarian.\"\n\nA related legal fiction, which assumes that a living person is fertile at birth, is known as the precocious toddler.\n\nThe unborn widow poses a similar seemingly silly but logical problem. Suppose that property is left \"to A for life, then to his widow for life, then to A's issue.\" Because the gift to A's widow cannot be resolved until A dies, the law will consider the possibility that, after the property is left to A, he marries a woman who was not born at the time the gift was made. For instance, it is possible that in 1950 the property is left to A, in 1955 a woman B is born, and in 1975 A and B marry each other (neither having issue at the time). Furthermore, it is possible that A will die, say in 1980, and his widow B will outlive him for more than 21 years. Suppose that she dies in 2005. B was not a life in being at the time of the transfer, and the only remaining \"validating life\" under the rule against perpetuities is A, who has been dead for 25 years by this time. The gift to A's issue does not vest until his widow dies, and since that could theoretically happen more than 21 years after the death of all lives in being at the time of the transfer, the transfer to A's issue is invalid from the start. \n\nNote that changing the word \"issue\" to \"children\" makes the gift valid: Since the class of \"A's children\" is closed and completely cognizable at the time of A's death (plus a gestation period as allowed by the rule), A's children no longer have a vested remainder subject to open; upon A's death, they now have an indefeasibly vested remainder, which is outside the scope of the Rule against Perpetuities. On the contrary, the class of \"A's issue\" is subject to expand long after A's death, so their future interest remains that of a vested remainder subject to open, which is within the scope of the rule. B cannot serve as the life in being for A's issue because B was not yet born, i.e., not \"a life in being,\" at the time of the transfer. Because her death could (as explained above) be more than 21 years after A's death, the result is that the gift to A's issue violates the rule because it is possible that the gift will vest more than 21 years after the end of \"all lives in being at the time the gift was created\".\n\nThe problem of the unborn widow is a frequently used illustration of the Rule's complexities. Suppose that a woman, A, wants to devise her estate to her son B and his wife, and then to their children.\n\nA's devise might look something like this:\n\nThough this seems like a reasonable devise, it actually violates the Rule because there is a possibility, however remote, that the interest to \"B's children then living\" will vest more than 21 years after the deaths of all lives in being.\n\nSuppose B is married without children at the time of the devise. Suppose further that B's wife were to die or B were to divorce. If B were to remarry to someone who was born \"after\" the devise, the new wife would not be a life in being at the time of the devise. Similarly, any children born to B and his new wife would also not be lives in being at the time of the devise. If B's new wife were to outlive him (making her his widow) and survive him by more than 21 years, then the interest to \"B's children then living\" would not vest until after the perpetuities period expired (21 years after the death of B, the only relevant life in being at the time of the devise), because only upon the death of the widow can one ascertain who are \"B's children then living.\"\n\nAlternately, if B is not married at the time of the devise and B were to get married afterwards, again the wife could not be a \"life in being\" since she is not identifiable at the time of the devise. Similarly to the previous case, she could outlive B by more than 21 years, voiding the grant to their children (who also could not be lives in being because they would have been born after the devise was made).\n\nHowever, if the last interest were simply to \"B's children,\" rather than to \"B's children then living,\" it would vest upon B's death because at that time all of B's children would be ascertainable. In this instance, the devise would be valid under the Rule.\n\nOther hypothetically relevant possibilities which almost never actually occur but have been invoked by lawyers or courts to invalidate transfers under the rule against perpetuities include the slothful executor (a situation where the executor of the estate does not probate the will for many years after the testator's death), the magic gravel pit (a transfer to be made as soon as a gravel pit is out of gravel may not vest for hundreds of years), the war that never ends (a transfer to be made at the end of a war might never happen), and other similar situations.\n\nBecause these hypothetical scenarios show how a reasonable gift can be voided based on so unlikely an outcome, they have generated much criticism among legal scholars, resulting in the abrogation of the rule against perpetuities by statute in many jurisdictions. Many U.S. States have adopted laws mollifying the application of the rule by requiring courts to \"wait and see\" for a period of years, sometimes as long as 360 years (which effectively negates the possibility of litigation ensuing during the life of any person alive at the same time of the author of the will).\n\nSome jurisdictions have ameliorated specific problems of the rule by creating statutory presumptions to counter those problems. Under such statutes, for example, a woman is presumed to no longer be fertile after a particular age (typically 55), and a gift to a person's widow or widower is presumed to vest in whoever was that person's spouse at the time of the gift.\n\nThese rules have also long been a target of legal humorists.\n"}

{"id": "2123148", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2123148", "title": "Civic virtue", "text": "Civic virtue\n\nCivic virtue is the harvesting of habits important for the success of the community. Closely linked to the concept of citizenship, civic virtue is often conceived as the dedication of citizens to the common welfare of their community even at the cost of their individual interests. The identification of the character traits that constitute civic virtue has been a major concern of political philosophy. The term \"civility\" refers to behavior between persons and groups that conforms to a social mode (that is, in accordance with the civil society), as itself being a foundation of society and law.\n\nCivic virtues are historically taught as a matter of chief concern in nations under republican forms of government, and societies with cities. When final decisions on public matters are made by a monarch, it is the \"monarch's\" virtues which influence those decisions. When a broader class of people become the decision-makers, it is then their virtues which characterize the types of decisions made. This form of decision-making is considered superior in determining what best protects the interests of the majority. Aristocratic oligarchies may also develop traditions of public lists of virtues they believe appropriate in the governing class, but these virtues differ significantly from those who are generally identified under the category of civic virtue, stressing martial courage over commercial honesty. Constitutions became important in defining the public virtue of republics and constitutional monarchies. The earliest forms of constitutional development can be seen in late medieval Germany (see Communalism before 1800) and in the Dutch and English revolts of the 16th and 17th centuries.\n\nIn the classical culture of Western Europe and those places that follow its political tradition, concern for civic virtue starts with the oldest republics of which we have extensive records, Athens and Rome. Attempting to define the virtues needed to successfully govern the Athenian \"polis\" was a matter of significant concern for Socrates and Plato; a difference in civic vision ultimately was one of the factors that led to the trial of Socrates and his conflict with the Athenian democracy. The \" Politics\" of Aristotle viewed citizenship as consisting, not of political rights, but rather of political duties. Citizens were expected to put their private lives and interests aside and serve the state in accordance with duties defined by law.\n\nRome, even more than Greece, produced a number of moralistic philosophers such as Cicero, and moralistic historians such as Tacitus, Sallust, Plutarch and Livy. Many of these figures were either personally involved in power struggles that took place in the late Roman Republic, or wrote elegies to liberty which was lost during their transition to the Roman Empire. They tended to blame this loss of liberty on the perceived lack of civic virtue in their contemporaries, contrasting them with idealistic examples of virtue drawn from Roman history, and even non-Roman \"barbarians\".\n\nTexts of antiquity became very popular by the Renaissance. Scholars tried to gather as many of them as they could find, especially in monasteries, from Constantinople, and from the Muslim world. Aided by the rediscovery of the virtue ethics and metaphysics of Aristotle by Avicenna and Averroes, Thomas Aquinas fused Aristotle's cardinal virtues with Christianity in his \"Summa Theologica\" (1273).\n\nHumanists wanted to reinstate the ancient ideal of civic virtue through education. Instead of punishing sinners, it was believed that sin could be prevented by raising virtuous children. Living in the city became important for the elite, because people in the city are forced to behave themselves when communicating with others. A problem was that the proletarianization of peasants created an environment in cities where such workers were hard to control. Cities tried to keep the proletarians out or tried to civilize them by forcing them to work in poor houses. Important aspects of civic virtue were: civic conversation (listening to others, trying to reach an agreement, keeping yourself informed so you can have a relevant contribution), civilized behavior (decent clothing, accent, containing feelings and needs), work (people had to make a useful contribution to the society). Religion changed. It became more focused on individual behavior instead of a communion of people. The people who believed in civic virtue belonged to a small majority surrounded by \"barbarity\". Parental authority was popular, especially the authority of the monarch and the state.\n\nCivic virtue was very popular during the Enlightenment but it had changed dramatically. Parental authority began to wane. Freedom became popular. But people can only be free by containing their emotions in order to keep some space for others. Trying to keep proletarians out or putting them in a poor house was not done anymore. The focus was now on educating. Work was an important virtue during the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, but the people who worked were treated with contempt by the non-working elite. The 18th century brought an end to this. The advancing rich merchants class emphasized the importance of work and contributing to society for all people including the elite. Science was popular. The government and the elites tried to change the world and humanity positively by expanding the bureaucracy. Leading thinkers thought that education and the breach of barriers would liberate everybody from stupidity and oppression. Civic conversations were held in societies and scientific journals.\n\nCivic virtue also became a matter of public interest and discussion during the 18th century, in part because of the American Revolutionary War. An anecdote first published in 1906 has Benjamin Franklin answer a woman who asked him, \"Well, Doctor, what have we got – a Republic or a Monarchy?\" He responded: \"A Republic, if you can keep it.\" The current use for this quotation is to bolster with Franklin's authority the opinion that republics require the cultivation of specific political beliefs, interests, and habits among their citizens, and that if those habits are not cultivated, they are in danger of falling back into some sort of authoritarian rule, such as a monarchy.\n\nAmerican historian Gordon S. Wood called it a universal 18th-century assumption that, while no form of government was more beautiful than a republic, monarchies had various advantages: the pomp and circumstances surrounding them cultivated a sense that the rulers were in fact superior to the ruled and entitled to their obedience, and maintained order by their presence. By contrast, in a republic, the rulers were the servants of the public, and there could therefore be no sustained coercion from them. Laws had to be obeyed for the sake of conscience, rather than fear of the ruler's wrath. In a monarchy, people might be restrained by force to submit their own interest to their government's. In a republic, by contrast, people must be \"persuaded\" to submit their own interests to the government, and this voluntary submission constituted the 18th century's notion of civic virtue. In the absence of such persuasion, the authority of the government would collapse, and tyranny or anarchy were imminent.\n\nAuthority for this ideal was found once more among the classical, and especially the Roman, political authors and historians. But since the Roman writers wrote during a time when the Roman republican ideal was fading away, its forms but not its spirit or substance being preserved in the Roman Empire, the 18th-century American and French revolutionaries read them with a spirit to determine how the Roman republic failed, and how to avoid repeating that failure. In his \"Reflections on the Rise and Fall of the Antient Republicks\", the English Whig historian Edward Wortley Montagu sought to describe \"the principal causes of that degeneracy of manners, which reduc'd those once brave and free people into the most abject slavery.\" Following this reading of Roman ideals, the American revolutionary Charles Lee envisioned a Spartan, egalitarian society where every man was a soldier and master of his own land, and where people were \"instructed from early infancy to deem themselves property of the State... (and) were ever ready to sacrifice their concerns to her interests.\" The agrarianism of Thomas Jefferson represents a similar belief system; Jefferson believed that the ideal republic was composed of independent, rural agriculturalists rather than urban tradesmen.\nThese widely held ideals led American revolutionaries to found institutions such as the Society of the Cincinnati, named after the Roman farmer and dictator Cincinnatus, who according to Livy left his farm to lead the army of the Roman republic during a crisis, and voluntarily returned to his plow once the crisis had passed. About Cincinnatus, Livy writes:\n\nCivic virtues were especially important during the 19th and 20th century. Class and profession greatly affected the virtues of the individual, and there was a general division about what the best civic virtues were. Additionally several major ideologies came into being, each with their own ideas about civic virtues.\n\nConservatism emphasized family values and obedience to the father and the state. Nationalism carried by masses of people made patriotism an important civic virtue. Liberalism combined republicanism with a belief in progress and liberalization based on capitalism. Civic virtues focused on individual behavior and responsibility were very important. Many liberals turned into socialists or conservatives in the end of the 19th century and early 20th century. Others became social liberals, valuing capitalism with a strong government to protect the poor. A focus on agriculture and landed nobility was supplanted by a focus on industry and civil society.\n\nAn important civic virtue for socialists was that people be conscious of oppression within society and the forces which uphold the status quo. This consciousness should result in action to change the world for the good, so that everybody can become respectful citizens in a modern society.\n\nNational Socialism, the German variant of twentieth century fascism whose precepts were laid out in Adolf Hitler's Mein Kampf, classified inhabitants of the ideal nation into three main hierarchical categories, each of which had different rights and duties in relation to the state: citizens, subjects, and aliens. The first category, citizens, were to possess full civic rights and responsibilities. Citizenship would be conferred only on those males of pure racial stock who had completed military service, and could be revoked at any time by the state. Only women who worked independently or who married a citizen could obtain citizenship for themselves. The second category, subjects, referred to all others who were born within the nation's boundaries who did not fit the racial criteria for citizenship. Subjects would have no voting rights, could not hold any position within the state, and possessed none of the other rights and civic responsibilities conferred on citizens. The final category, aliens, referred to those who were citizens of another state, who also had no rights:\n\nA number of institutions and organizations promote the idea of civic virtue in the older democracies. Among such organizations are the Boy Scouts of America, and Civil Air Patrol whose U.S. oath, Cadet Oath and Cadet Honor Code reflect a goal to foster habits aimed at serving a larger community:\n\nBoy Scouts of America Scout Oath:\n\nBoy Scouts of America Scout Law:\nCadet Oath:\nAir Force Academy Cadet Honor Code:\nInstitutions that might be said to encourage civic virtue include the school, particularly with social studies courses, and the prison, namely in its rehabilitative function.\n\nOther, later phenomena associated with the concept of civic virtue include \"McGuffey's Eclectic Readers\", a series of primary school textbooks whose compiler, William Holmes McGuffey, deliberately sought out patriotic and religious sentiments to instill these values in the children who read them. William Bennett, a Reagan administration cabinet member turned conservative commentator, produced \"\" in 1993, another anthology of literary materials that might be considered an attempt to update McGuffey's concept.\n\nConfucianism, which specifies cultural virtues and traditions which all members of society are to observe, in particular the heads of households and those who govern, was the basis of Chinese society for more than 2000 years and is still influential in modern China. Its related concepts can be compared to the Western idea of civic virtue.\n\n\n\n"}

In 2007, the league included 185 schools involving nearly 2,400 teams.\n\nThe mission of the Public Schools Athletic league is to provide opportunities for educating students in physical fitness, character development and socialization skills through an athletic program that fosters teamwork, discipline and sportsmanship.\n\nDuring the 2014–15 school year, the PSAL distributed approximately $27 million to fund over 45,000 student-athletes at hundreds of New York City schools.\n\nThe genesis of the Public Schools Athletic League (PSAL) came from the appointment in early 1903 of Dr. Luther Halsey Gulick as director of physical training for the New York public school system. Compared to other major cities, the athletics program for the New York boroughs were backwards, underdeveloped, and rife with corruption. Gulick found \"semi-truant\" boys playing baseball for schools they did not attend, and that there was much unsportsmanlike conduct and dishonesty on the playing fields. Only a small percentage of actual students participated in athletics. He saw a serious need for reform and devised a grandiose plan to form a new league—the PSAL—that would involve most of the student population, grade school and high school, and working with two influential New Yorkers—General George W. Wingate (a member of the City Board of Education) and James E. Sullivan (secretary of the Amateur Athletic Union)—presented it in October 1903 to the superintendent of schools, William H. Maxwell. He, with the concurrence of the school board, approved of Gulick's plan.\n\nAlthough the PSAL received sanction by the board of education, it was set up as a private corporation that would not receive public tax money. The founders of the league recruited the businessmen of New York City to serve on the league's board of directors and also become paying members of the league, and also solicited contributions from prominent benefactors. The league was organized into 22 districts (expanded to 25 by 1910), in which each district league administered athletic programs for elementary and high schools within their district. One member of each district league served on the Elementary Games committee and one member of each district league served on the High School Games committee. These committees governed all general matters pertaining to the league. Championships were held at the district, borough, and city levels. By 1914, the Board of Education was fully funding the PSAL.\n\nThe league began with an athletic extravaganza held at Madison Square Garden on December 26, 1903. It involved 1,040 boys, mostly elementary school students, in basketball and track and field events. Among the high schools, Commerce won the track and field meet and Flushing won the basketball tournament. In the spring the league held its first outdoor high school track and field championship, won by Brooklyn Boys.\n\nEach year thereafter the high school league expanded by adding citywide championships in additional sports. In the school year of 1906-07 cross country and soccer was added, and the 1907-08 school year saw the addition of rifle marksmanship, swimming, tennis, and baseball. The expanded activity of the PSAL served to kill off all the previous leagues by 1908.\n\nRowing was added in the spring of 1907, and several schools, mainly Commerce and Clinton, competed each Memorial Day in the Harlem Regatta. The schools had difficulty getting the use of shells, however, and in 1915 the PSAL withdrew sponsorship. In the 1909-10, lacrosse was added and after World War I golf, handball, fall rifle marksmanship, and ice hockey were added.\n\nFootball was not a part of the league's program in its early years. The PSAL chose not sponsor football, because the intent of the league was to involve the average athlete in athletics, and football was considered a sport for athletic elites. The Long Island, Metropolitan, and various borough leagues continued to run the football championships for a couple or so years. In the fall of 1905 the New York newspapers began crowning schools with the titular \"Greater New York\" championship in football. This procedure lasted until about the fall of 1913, when the number of football contenders made it impossible to schedule sufficient games to decide on one champion. Thereafter the newspapers contented themselves with crowning borough champions. Finally, the PSAL began sponsoring football competition by boroughs in the fall of 1919, but no official championships were recognized. The newspapers basically crowned the borough champions in football.\n\nThe premier athletic powers in the league were spread over the boroughs and in the different sports. In the Bronx one of the premier powers was DeWitt Clinton, which took more than its share of trophies in the basketball, swimming, track and field, tennis, and football. In Manhattan was Stuyvesant, which rivaled Clinton in basketball, swimming, and track and field, and Commerce, which rivaled Clinton in basketball and football. Townsend Harris produced more than its share of swimming championships.\n\nIn Brooklyn, Manual Training succeeded Long Island League alumnus Brooklyn Boys' as the borough's power, taking loads of titles in track and field, cross country, lacrosse, and soccer. Another Long Island League alumnus, Erasmus Hall, emerged as a football and swimming power. In the 1920s New Utrecht became the premier power in track and field, taking most the indoor and outdoor titles that decade. The school continued to dominate the sport well into the 1930s.\n\nQueens produced such powers as Jamaica (in ice hockey and rifle marksmanship), Richmond Hill (in golf), and Flushing (in cross country and track and field). Besides Clinton, the Bronx could boast of Morris, which dominated rifle marksmanship early on and took several national championships, and also did well in soccer and tennis. Evander Childs did well in golf, rifle, swimming, and tennis. On Staten Island (Richmond Borough), Curtis became a power in cross country, golf, and soccer.\n\nIn the late 1920s and early 1930s new athletic powers came to the forefront, such as Jefferson, Textile, Brooklyn Technical High School, Monroe, and Madison. Handball and fencing were added to the league program. The Great Depression of the 1930s cut somewhat into the PSAL program, and some sports were discontinued.\n\nSome notable coaches in the PSAL are William Lopez, Jack Dammon, Dwayne \"Tiny\" Morton, Ruth Lovelace and Robert Sprance.\n\nThe following is a list of the sports that the PSAL currently runs under its program\n\n\n\n\n\nIn August 2006, New York City Public Advocate Betsy Gotbaum released a report titled \"Making the Team: Gender Inequality in New York City PSAL Sports Teams.\" The report stated \"all types of high schools favored boys sport teams opportunities\" and that \"the PSAL sports schedule discriminated against girls.\" It also stated that several women's sports were scheduled during the \"off-season\" of that sport, while the men's counterparts played during the traditional season. The report alleged that the PSAL was in violation of Title IX of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. In 2009 the PSAL moved girl's soccer from the spring to the fall season, lining up with the boy's soccer season, after the threat of a lawsuit from the New York Civil Liberties Union on behalf of three athletes. In 2010, the National Women's Law Center filed a lawsuit with the Office for Civil Rights of the United States Department of Education, claiming that the NYCDOE provided inadequate opportunities for female high school sports compared to those for males. The complaint alleged many public high schools in the city did not offer any girls teams in several sports, a violation of Title IX. Other urban school districts involved in the suit included those of Chicago and Houston. In 2015, the ensuing federal investigation concluded that the NYCDOE violated TItle IX by failing to provide an equal opportunity for female students to participate in sports.\n\nIn May 2014, the founder of the Small Schools Athletic League, David Garcia-Rosen, filed a civil rights complaint with the United States Department Of Education against the PSAL, alleging that they were in violation of Title XI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The complaint included dozens of charts that illustrated students who attend schools with the highest percentages of students of color had the fewest opportunities to participate in PSAL sports, while the schools with the most white students had as many as 44 PSAL teams. \"The New York Times\" called the PSAL's response to this complaint a \"statistical delusion.\"\n\nAt a May 28, 2014 City Council budget hearing, 100 students wearing jerseys inside out presented Deputy Chancellor Grimm with thousands of petitions demanding equitable access to the PSAL for students of color.\n\nIn November 2014, Garcia-Rosen filed a second complaint with the US Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights alleging that the PSAL continued to violate Title XI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by not providing students of color with equitable access to a diverse range of PSAL sports teams.\n\nOn November 20, 2014, student-athlete Jason Puello sued the PSAL in New York State Supreme Court, alleging that the PSAL's age rules are \"arbitrary and capricious.\"\n"}

One purported reason behind this is that he wanted to marry a daughter of current dermatology chairman, Ferdinand Ritter von Hebra, and advance in the society, which he could not have done being of Jewish faith. This seems unlikely because he married Martha Hebra and converted to Catholicism several years prior to changing his name, by which time he was already well established in the Vienna University faculty and a close associate of her father, Ferdinand. A more plausible explanation is based on his own comments to colleagues that he changed his name to avoid confusion with five other similarly named physicians on the Vienna faculty. Rumors about the sincerity of both his marriage and his concerns about his Jewish ancestry may have arisen through professional jealousy (William Dubreuilh (1857–1935), first professor and chairman of dermatology in Bordeaux: \"On disait de Kaposi qu´il avait pris la fille de Hebra, sa maison, sa chaire et sa clientèle, laissant le reste à son beau-frère Hans Hebra.\" - \"It was said of Kaposi that he had taken the daughter of Hebra, his home, his chair and his clientele, leaving the rest to his brother-in-law, Hans Hebra.\")\n\nIn 1855, Kaposi began to study medicine at the University of Vienna and attained a doctorate in 1861. In his dissertation, titled \"Dermatologie und Syphilis\" (1866) he made an important contribution to the field. Kaposi was appointed as professor at the University of Vienna in 1875, and in 1881 he became a member of the board of the Vienna General Hospital and director of its clinic of skin diseases.\n\nTogether with his mentor, Ferdinand Ritter von Hebra, he authored the book \"Lehrbuch der Hautkrankheiten\" (Textbook of Skin Diseases) in 1878. Kaposi’s main work, however, was \"Pathologie und Therapie der Hautkrankheiten in Vorlesungen für praktische Ärzte und Studierende\" (Pathology and Therapy of the Skin Diseases in Lectures for Practical Physicians and Students), published in 1880, which became one of the most significant books in the history of dermatology, being translated to several languages. He is credited with the description of xeroderma pigmentosum, a rare genetic disorder now known to be caused by defects in nucleotide excision repair (\"Ueber Xeroderma pigmentosum. Medizinische Jahrbücher, Wien, 1882: 619–633\"). Among other diseases, Kaposi was the first to study Lichen scrofolosorum and Lupus erythematosus. In all, he published over 150 books and papers. He is widely credited with advancing the use of pathologic examination in the diagnosis of dermatologic diseases.\n\nHis name entered into the history of medicine in 1872, when he described for the first time Kaposi's sarcoma, a cancer of the skin, which he had discovered in five elderly male patients and which he initially named \"idiopathic multiple pigmented sarcoma\". More than a century later, the appearance of this disease in young gay men in New York City, San Francisco and other coastal cities in the United States was one of the first indications that a new disease, now called AIDS, had appeared. Kaposi's sarcoma is a tumor that is caused by a virus, Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus or KSHV, discovered in 1993. Kaposi's sarcoma is now the most commonly reported cancer in parts of sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nAccording to his biographer, Dr. J.D. Oriel, \"in his lifetime, Moritz Kaposi was acknowledged as one of the great masters of the Vienna School of Dermatology, a superb clinician and renowned teacher\". While his mentor, Ferdinand von Hebra, is considered the \"father of dermatology\", Kaposi was one of the first to establish dermatology on its anatomical pathology scientific basis. He became the chairman of the Vienna School of Dermatology, after Hebra's death in 1880.\n\n\n"}

Other possible source is from the old Tagalog word \"balayang\" which means \"wood\".\n\nTagalog literatures in Balayan were lost and destroyed at the coming of the Spaniards. Jesuit Father Chirino testified they found (300) three hundred pre-colonial manuscripts in Balayan but to facilitate them the propagation of the Roman Catholic faith, early Jesuit missionaries destroyed the records.\n\nScholars and historians believed that Tagalog songs: \"Kumintang\" and \"Kundiman\" originated from Balayan. Spanish writer and historian Wenceslao E. Retana recorded the lyrics of a popular Kundiman when he visited Batangas in 1888.\n\nBalayan has a close affinity to early history. The towns position on the basin of a good harbour was one of the reasons it became the first lands for local settlements in the Philippines, with existing records of local indigenous residents exchanging barter goods with Chinese traders dating back to the mid-14th century.\n\nIt was once the capital of a Moro Sultanate named \"Bon-bon\" whose area includes Mindoro to Cavite and even some parts of Metro Manila. The indigenous inhabitants of Balayan has close ties with the Brunei Sultanate of Maynilad under the leadership of Rajah Sulayman I and his uncle Rajah Matanda. There are historical accounts that Rajah Sulayman I stayed on this area when he tried to battle the Spaniards around Intramuros.\n\nDespite the presence of Spanish forces protected by the newly built stonefort in nearby Maynilad or Manila, Fort Santiago and Fort Intramuros Philippines, due to its natural harbor, a number of areas around the archipelago were often become launching grounds of counterattacks from the seafaring Moro people.\n\nThese events prompted local Spanish officials to set up a fort to prevent yearly Moro counterattacks.\n\nBalayan is a lowland town in western Batangas.

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nThe Augustinian church of Bauan was founded as a \"visita\" (small chapel without a resident priest) in 1590 on the slopes of Mount Macolod, along Taal Lake's southern shore. The resident priest of Taal, Father Diego de Avila would visit periodically and attend to the spiritual needs of the settlement.\n\nFive years after the establishment of the ecclesiastical mission of Bauan, a giant cross made of anubing was found in a Diñgin (a place of worship) near the town of Alitagtag. In 1790, Castro y Amoedo found a Tagalog document in the Bauan Cathedral Archives, signed by \"25 Indio elders\", stating the cross was made around 1595, as protection from ghosts surrounding the Tolo fountain. Subsequent miracles were associated with this cross. On 3 May, the 2.5 m tall cross was brought to the Chapel of Alitagtag. A golden sun, with a human face, and radiating rays was added, while the devout would cut away pieces of the cross to make talisman replicas. The elders also thought the cross protected the town from pestilence, locusts, drought, volcanic eruptions, and Moro pirates.\n\nToday, the traditional folk dance of Bauan, subli, is a religious homage to the Cross of Alitagtag. The dance is performed at a \"sambahan\" (place of worship), two of which are natural grottos along the shore of Taal Lake, and one of which is called Diñgin.\n\nBauan became an independent parish on 12 May 1596, but was re-annexed to Taal, its \"matriz\" (mother town), because of too few \"tributos\" (taxpayers). Due to Taal Volcano eruptions, the town moved to Durungao (lookout point), led by Father Jose Rodriguez, in 1662. The town moved again in 1671 to Loual, along Taal's \"Seno de Bauan\". An earthquake struck the town in 1677. In 1689, Father Nicolas de Rivera helped the town build its third church. In 1690, Father Rivera, with the help of the Taal parish priest Father Simon Martinez, moved the town to the seaside, its present location. However, a typhoon destroyed the church in 1692.\n\nA fourth stone church was built from 1695 to 1710. The current church was built in 1762 by Father Jose Victoria and Don Juan Bandino. A fort was built in 1775 to protect the town from Moro raids.\n\nFr. Jose Vitoria introduced the cultivation of indigo in Bauan while building the present church. This was continued until 1856 during the administrations of Fr. Jose Trevino and Fr. Hipolito Huerta. It was completed under the supervision of Fr. Felipe Bravo in 1881. From there until 1894, final decorations were supervised by Fr. Moises Santos and Fr. Felipe Garcia. The church is said to be the most artistically built in the province of Batangas during that time. Father Bravo was also an imminent botanist who put up a museum of natural history and collected rare books that were lost when the church was razed by fire during the Philippine revolution against Spain in 1898. The church was probably rebuilt and again destroyed by fire in 1938. It has been restored since then.\n\nIn March 2019, the Black Nazarene visited the church to help funds for rebuilding after the church was damaged in the 2017 Batangas earthquakes.\n\nThe town of Bauan used to encompass a much more extensive area.

The municipality was named after Captain Roberto Lemery, a commanding officer of the local garrison. He took command of the local military outpost until his death in 1856.\n\nDuring the early part of the 18th century, adventurous settlers from Taal, northern Mindoro and southern Cavite were attracted to the vast plain near the shores of Balayan Bay because of its abundance in fish and other marine life. Salting and drying fish became their major occupation due to the great demand of salted and dried fish by the people of Cavite, Mindoro, Laguna and Batangas. People came in great numbers to join the settlers, and the village became populous. The place was first called \"Punta\", meaning \"point\". In 1818, the village of Punta was converted into one of the barrios of the Municipality of Taal. It was later renamed \"San Geronimo\".\n\nIn 1858, the barrio of San Geronimo became officially known as Lemery, after Captain Roberto Lemery, a commanding officer of the local military garrison. Captain Lemery was known for his deep ties with the community. Although he was tasked with instructing the military personnel assigned to the garrison, he went out of his way to immerse himself with the locals. He formed relationships with heads of the local church to learn the local language and cultivate harmony among the populace. When he died in 1856, the locals wished for the town to be renamed in honor of Captain Lemery.\n\nIn 1862, Lemery and its surrounding barrios were separated from the Municipality of Taal. It became a district municipality through the efforts of Candida Cesario Valenzuela, Manuel Cabrera, Policarpio Mariño and Domingo Agoncillo. Jose Cabrera became the First \"Gobernadorcillo\" of the newly created town.\n\nThe local military garrison was officially incorporated into the \"Guardia Civil\" upon the latter’s creation in 1868. This newly-formed organization was a gendarmerie tasked with law enforcement in the Philippines. It operated under the Spanish Army and Spanish colonial government and remained the \"de facto\" police force in the entire Philippines until its independence from Spain in 1898.\n\nFor economic considerations, Lemery was again annexed to Taal in 1904. Finally by virtue of \"Executive Order 1549\" of the Philippine Civil Commission, it became an independent municipality in 1907.\n\nAccording to the Philippine Statistics Authority, the has a land area of constituting of the total area of Batangas.\n\nLemery is politically subdivided into 46 barangays.

At the 2010 census, 1,862,165 people resided within its administrative area of and 757,647 in its built-up (\"or metro\") area made up of 3 out of 6 urban districts (including Jiguan, Hengshan and Chengzihe). Jixi is on the Muling River about from the border with Russia's Primorsky Krai and from Khanka Lake. The mayor of Jixi is Zhang Changrong () since June 2015. The area is one of the important coal mining bases in China. A crater on asteroid 253 Mathilde was named after the city.\n\nJixi was ruled by the Jurchen and Goguryeo people. By the Shang dynasty, dwellers here had begun to communicate with people in the Central Plain. It was in the Han dynasty that primitive agriculture in this region had made great progress. During the Tang dynasty, Jixi was under the control of the Balhae. As the Manchus conquered the territories occupied by the Ming dynasty in 1644, the basin of the Amur River was blocked in order to protect the Manchu people's place of origin. In this period, the population of the Jixi region experienced a sharp decrease. In 1662, the Kangxi Emperor ordered the general of Ninguta to dominate the territory. Since a large number of people engaged in reclaiming wasteland and collecting ginseng, Jixi and the whole Ussuri River basin gradually became the base for medicinal materials.\n\nIn the second half of the 19th century, as Czarist Russia advanced through Siberia and reached the Sea of Okhotsk, the Qing officials like General Tepuqin () made a proposal to open Manchuria for farming in order to oppose the conquest of Russia, and so the Qing government forsook the policy of blockading on the Northeast region of China. A large number of the Han Chinese, especially from the Shandong Peninsula and Zhili, migrated into Manchuria. The Qing government set up Mishan Prefecture in this territory in 1908. Coal resources were discovered constantly in Jixi during this period. In September 1914, a merchant named Yuan Dazhang () from Mukden was approved to set up the Mixi Coal Mine Company, which represents the regular production of coal in Jixi. However, construction of Chinese Eastern Railway one of the provisions brought a nucleus of Russian Jews to northern Manchuria. In January 1924, Muling Coal Mine Corporation was operated jointly by the Jewish businessman Solomon L. Skidelsky and the Jilin Province government. The headquarters of the company was located on Ashihe Street, Nangang District, Harbin. The output of Muling Colliery has reached 1.6 million tons in 1931. Since The Japanese invasion of Manchuria began on September 19, 1931, the whole of Manchuria was seized by Japan following the Mukden Incident, and in 1932, a sympathetic government, Manchukuo, was established. The Jixi region then became a colony of the Japanese. On December 15, 1935, Jixi Railway Station's construction was completed by South Manchuria Railway(SMR). On September 1, 1941, the Manchukuo government established Jining County (). The first mayor of the county was Kubota Yutaka (). The Japanese settlers brutally slaughtered more than 100 thousand miners in the Jixi mining area, leaving several mass graves in Didao. On August 9, 1945, Togashi Ichiro (), the conductor of Didao Colliery, ordered the destruction of the coalpits in Hengshan, Didao and Muling as the Soviet Red Army closed in.\n\nOn August 12, 1945, the Soviet Army captured Jining County, and the Military Headquarters commanded the Jixi mining area to resume production. On October 18, 1947, Jixi Mining Bureau was founded in order to control the collieries and the Coal Mine Machinery Factory. On July 30, 1949, the Northeast Executive Committee allowed Jining County to change its name to Jixi County, which was administered by Songjiang Province. On June 19, 1954, Jixi County was administered by Heilongjiang Province as the Songjiang Province became part of Heilongjiang province.\n\nDuring the First Five-Year Plan of China, several industrial projects including Chengzihe No.9 subvertical and the Chengzihe Coal Washery were constructed. By 1956, the population of Jixi had reached 234,154, and the output of coal rose to 5 million tons per year. On December 18, 1956, the State Council of China decided to set up Jixi City (Prefectural-Level) instead of Jixi County, administering 5 districts including Jiguan, Didao, Mashan, Hengshan and Lishu. On March 7, Jixi City was formally established. In 1970, Chengzihe District was established. In 1983, Jidong County was put under Jixi's administration. The coal-mining industry was developing rapidly during the 1970s and 1980s. By 1991, the total coal output of Jixi ranked second in the Chinese Mainland. In the 1980s, Mishan and Hulin were incorporated into Jixi's jurisdiction. Jixi has reached its current domain.\n\nJixi is located at the southern edge of the Sanjiang or Three Rivers Plain.

The economy of Jixi is mainly constructed around rich coal resources. Jixi is estimated to have about 8 billion tons of coal reserves, ranking 2nd out of 13 prefectures and prefecture-level cities in Heilongjiang Province. Coal chemical industry, metallurgy and machinery are predominant. The environmental protection industry, agriculture and tourist industries are also developing rapidly in recent years. However, Coal still accounts for the main part of the entire economic system. Other pillar industries in Jixi include pharmaceuticals, food manufacturing, non-metal products and electricity production and supply. Large industrial companies are hosted in Jixi such as Huawei Wood and Heilongjiang Rixin Food, which is mainly engaged in edible fungus processing. The food company has annual processing capacity of 2,500 tons of edible fungus. The graphite reserves of Jixi amount to 780 million tons, ranking first in all of Asia.

Within roughly an hour's drive is the Qi Lin Shan () scenic area.\n\nA few hours east of the city within the Jixi administrative region is the Russian lake and river border, a number of points along which are popular summer destinations for tourists in particular:\n\nHutou Fortress was a Japanese military base of the Kwantung Army in northeast China on the Sino-Soviet border which is known as \"Oriental Maginot Line\". The Japanese built a large scale military fortress in Hutou, since it was regarded, by the leader of Kwantung Army, as a dagger facing the defensive line between Vladivostok and Khabarovsk. On August 26, 1945, the Soviet Red Army finally captured the Fort. As the Hutou battle ended, Japan's unconditional surrender came 11 days later. Only 53 of the 1,400 Japanese soldiers survived one of the last campaigns of the Second World War. A Study on the Hutou Fortress Battle between Japan and the Soviet Union took place in 2009, by the Social Science Academy of Heilongjiang Province, entitled \"The end of World War II\".\n\nUssuri River is the largest tributary of Amur River(Heilong River) on its right and an important boundary river between China and Russia.

The population density was .\n\nThe townsfolk are predominantly Roman Catholic, with minorities belonging to other religious groups like the Iglesia ni Cristo, United Methodist Church, Baptist denominations, Jehovah's Witnesses, Jesus is Lord Church and Members Church of God International.\n\nIts economy is primarily agricultural with coffee, coconut and banana as the major crops. Fish culture, with milkfish and tilapia being the major culture species, is also practiced in the coastal barangays of Nangkaan, Lumang Lipa and Kinalaglagan. Piggery and poultry farms from backyard to large scale operation represent a big part of the town's economy. Supporting the town's agribusiness are two feed mills namely, MAGICORP and AICOM.\n\nSeveral banks (Mataasnakahoy Rural Bank, Lipa Development Bank, Savings and Loan Association of Mataasnakahoy) serve the townspeople. Small businesses like stores and groceries abound and the town center has a flea market (\"talipapa\" or \"tiangge\") where fresh fish, meat and vegetables are available daily and a pharmacy, Generika Drugstore. Several small garment factories partly fuel the town's business activity. Telephone service and internet access are already available.\n\nResidential subdivisions (Victomar, Crisanta Homes, Immaculate Conception Village, Sinforosa and Monte Vista among others) have started real estate development in the town. Gawad Kalinga (a free house and lot project for the poor sponsored by the religious organisation Couples for Christ) is also established in Barangay Bubuyan.\n\nElected officials (2019-2022):\n\nThe town is easily accessible via Lipa City though passenger jeepneys plying the route from dawn (3:00 AM) till night (9:00 PM). It is also accessible via the national road through a two-kilometer concrete road along the southern boundary of Fernando Air Base. Tricycles are available for going around town and the innermost Barangays.\n\nSeveral resorts operate in different barangays and the town is starting to be known for these resorts. Shercon Resort, the first one which ventured in this line of business, is located in Barangay San Sebastian. Subsequently, El Madero in Barangay II and Galilee Place (Barangay San Sebastian) and La Virginia in Barangay Manggahan started operation.\n\nMataasnakahoy celebrates its town fiesta every January 3. The series of activities leading to the celebration starts several days before the actual fiesta and this would consist of sporting events, singing contests, street dancing competitions and the likes. The actual feast would be observed with food (not to mention, alcoholic drinks) in almost every household. The celebration is almost a sort of annual reunion among relatives and friends. Marching bands, usually hired or sponsored by the barangay officials, go all over the town with their music adding to the already reverberating songs and sounds from rented videoke machines of some households. The celebration is usually concluded by a variety show in the town plaza with invited performers and popular names in the show business and this would usually last till early morning of the next day.\n\nThe town also celebrates various religious feasts with mass and processions. The Holy Week (week before Easter Sunday) is observed solemnly by the townsfolks. Religious families usually sponsor a \"pabasa\" which relates the passion of the Christ in hymns (in agonizing and melodramatic tempo) usually with loudspeakers. Several processions are also conducted within this week. Easter Sunday concludes this celebration.\n\nAll Saint's Day (November 1) is observed by throngs of people going to cemetery to visit the burial site of the departed relatives. Flowers, candles and prayers are brought to each burial site by the living relatives who are sometimes even coming from far places.\n\nThe feast of Our Lady of Immaculate Conception (December 8), the town's patron saint, is also a well observed celebration. There is usually a mass and a procession around town with elaborate fireworks. There will also be food in the church for the religious and the parishioners.\nAs is everywhere in the Philippines, the town celebrates a very long Christmas Season. This starts with the elaborate Christmas decorations being displayed as early as November 2 and lasting until early January. There will be lanterns, posters, Santa Claus, Christmas trees, Christmas lights and any decor imaginable helping to boost the festive atmosphere. On Christmas Day (December 25), kids will be going around asking for their godparents' and relatives' blessings which can also be interpreted as asking for Christmas gifts.\n\nThe town is home to several secondary schools: La Purisima Concepcion Academy (Barangay II), Holy Trinity School of Padre Garcia, Bats., Mataasnakahoy Branch Inc. (Barangay IV), Mataasnakahoy National High School (Barangay IV), Bayorbor National High School (Bayorbor), Mataasnakahoy Senior High School (Bayorbor) and Mother Chiara Biagiotti School (Santol).\n\n\n"}

His work included projected DVD installations, Type C prints, and collaborative film projects.\n\nBlake graduated from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago with a BFA in 1993 and the California Institute of the Arts with an MFA in 1995.\n\nHis work was selected for the Whitney Biennial in 2000, 2002 and 2004. His \"Winchester\" series, inspired by the story of Sarah Winchester and the Winchester Mystery House, was shown at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art in 2005. He also was selected to participate in the Renaissance Society group exhibition, \"All the Pretty Corpses\", in 2005.\n\nBlake also created the painted abstract hallucination scenes in the 2002 Paul Thomas Anderson film \"Punch-Drunk Love\", and contributed artwork and video for Beck's album \"Sea Change.\" Blake was also involved in creating and commissioning a soundtrack album called \"The Forty Million Dollar Beatnik\" with Neil Landstrumm and Mike Fellows in 2000 on Scandinavia Records and Pork Salad Press to accompany an LA drawings/script show by Blake of the same title.\n\nHis work is held in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art.\n\nBlake was the boyfriend of filmmaker, cultural critic and computer game designer Theresa Duncan. In February 2007, the couple moved from Los Angeles to New York City, and resided in the East Village. He was also the son of Anne Schwartz Delibert and the brother of Adrienne Morningstar Delibert.\n\nOn July 10, 2007, Blake found Duncan dead in their apartment, the result of an apparent suicide. On July 17, 2007, Blake was reported missing off New York's Rockaway Beach in Queens. According to media reports, a woman had called 911 to report that she saw a man walking out into the ocean. Blake's clothes and wallet were reportedly found along with a suicide note that referred to Duncan. On July 22, 2007, Blake's body was found by a fisherman in the waters off Sea Girt, New Jersey. Blake's cause of death was presumed to be suicide by drowning.\n\nAccording to statements by acquaintances of the couple that have appeared in published reports (including an article in the January 2008 \"Vanity Fair\"), Blake said that he and Duncan were being followed and harassed by Scientologists prior to his disappearance. Blake also included his allegations of harassment by Scientologists and others in a 27-page \"chronicle\" he prepared for a lawsuit he planned to file.\n\nOn November 30, 2008 the \"New York Post\"'s Page Six reported that Bret Easton Ellis is writing a screenplay about Duncan and Blake. Director Gus Van Sant signed on as a consultant for the movie, which is being produced by Braxton Pope and Kevin Frakes.\n\nThe \"Law & Order\" episode \"Bogeyman\" in season 18 is loosely based on the deaths of Duncan and Blake. In the episode, the body of the character paralleling Theresa Duncan has forensic evidence that calls into question her suicide, while the Jeremy Blake parallel character survives his suicide attempt. A legal case against him is disrupted by the cult group Systemotics, resulting in a near mistrial followed by a plea accepted after the ADA implies both he and the judge are connected to Systemotics.\n\nThe nightclub Bungalow 8, which operated in New York City from 2001 to 2009, was named for Blake's 1998 video work.\n\nDavid Berman, a frontman of the band Silver Jews, wrote a song called \"My Pillow is the Threshold\" for Blake after Duncan's suicide.\n\n"}

{"id": "2123234", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2123234", "title": "Torsion dystonia", "text": "Torsion dystonia\n\nTorsion dystonia, also known as dystonia musculorum deformans, is a disease characterized by painful muscle contractions resulting in uncontrollable distortions. This specific type of dystonia is frequently found in children, with symptoms starting around the ages of 11 or 12. It commonly begins with contractions in one general area such as an arm or a leg that continue to progress throughout the rest of the body. It takes roughly 5 years for the symptoms to completely progress to a debilitating state.\n\nThe disease is caused by a genetic disorder which results in a defect in a protein called Torsin A. A mutation in the DYT1 gene causes the loss of an amino acid, glutamic acid, in the Torsin A protein. Torsin A is an evolutionarily conserved AAA+ ATPase. The defective protein creates a disruption in communication in neurons that control muscle movement and muscle control. This mutation is most usually inherited from a parent, but can occur sporadically. The disease is caused by a dominant allele, meaning that the person affected needs only one copy of the mutated DYT1 gene to have symptoms. However, only 30 to 40 percent of those that do have the gene actually have symptoms, leading researchers to believe that there are other factors involved.\n\nThere are several types of torsion dystonia that affect different areas of the body. However, it is unknown if the gene that causes Early Onset Torsion Dystonia is responsible for the other dystonias as well.\n\n\nThere is no cure for torsion dystonia. However, there are several medical approaches that can be taken in order to lessen the symptoms of the disease. The treatment must be patient specific, taking into consideration all of the previous and current health complications. The doctor that creates the treatment must have intimate knowledge of the patients’ health and create a treatment plan that covers all of the symptoms focusing on the most chronic areas.\n\nThe first step for most with the disorder begins with some form of physical therapy in order for the patient to gain more control over the affected areas. The therapy can help patients with their posture and gain control over the areas of their body that they have the most problems with.\n\nThe second step in the treatment process is medication. The medications focus on the chemicals released by neurotransmitters in the nervous system, which control muscle movement. The medications on the market today are anticholinergics, benzodiazepines, baclofen, dopaminergic agents/dopamine-depleting agents, and tetrabenazine. Each medication is started on a low dosage and gradually increased to higher doses as the disease progresses and the side effects are known for the individual.\n\nA more site-specific treatment is the injection of botulinum toxin. It is injected directly into the muscle and works much the same way the oral medications do—by blocking neurotransmitters. The injections are not a treatment for the disease, but are a means to control its symptoms. \nA fourth option in the treatment for the symptoms of torsion dystonia is surgery. Surgery is performed only if the patient does not respond to the oral medications or the injections. The type of surgery performed is specific to the type of dystonia that the patient has.\n\nThe disease is more commonly found amongst Ashkenazi Jews. The occurrence of torsion dystonia in the Ashkenazi Jewish population as stated by the Department of Epidemiology and Public Health of Yale University School of Medicine in New Haven, CT; \"Reports dating to the beginning of this century describe Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) families with multiple cases of ITD either in siblings (Schwalbe 1908; Bernstein 1912; Abrahamson 1920) or in parents and offspring (Wechsler and Brock 1922; Mankowsky and Czerny 1929; Regensberg 1930). The first comprehensive evaluation of the mode of inheritance of ITD in Jewish and non-Jewish families was described by Zeman and Dyken (1967), who concluded that the disorder was inherited as an autosomal dominant with incomplete penetrance in both populations. Although they concluded that the gene frequency was higher in the AJ population than in non-Jews, no difference in mode of inheritance or disease mechanism was construed.\"\n\nA 1969 study of torsion dystonia patients found an average IQ 10 points higher than controls matched for age, sex and ethnic background.\n"}

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nSeveral bus services provide transportation to and from Nasugbu. Jeepneys from Tagaytay City also enter and leave the town at a scheduled time. Within the town, tricycles are the main mode of transport.\n\nAccording to legend, a group of Spanish soldiers was allowed by their commander to go on a sightseeing tour of the friendlier villages on the western coast of Batangas. The group came upon a native couple cooking rice in a \"palayok\" (clay pot), the lid of which rattled over the steaming rice. In Spanish, the group leader asked the woman: \"\"¿Cómo se llama este pueblo?\"\" (\"What is this place called?\") The woman, who knew no Spanish, thought that the stranger was asking about her pot of rice. \"\"Nasubo na po iyan, eh, kaya ganyan\"\" (\"The rice has been eaten; that is why it is like that,\") she replied. The Spaniard repeated the word \"nasubo\" and nodding his head towards his companions, introduced the word to them. The village henceforth began to be called by that name. Although no historical documents can support this legend, it is the most common story one hears when asking how the town got its name.\n\nAccording to the Philippine Statistics Authority, the has a land area of constituting of the total area of Batangas.\n\nNasugbu is bounded on the north by the municipalities of Maragondon, Magallanes and Alfonso in the province of Cavite; on the east by the Batangas municipalities of Laurel, Calaca and Balayan; on the south by the Batangas municipalities of Lian and Tuy; and on the west by the South China Sea.\n\nEntering the town proper via the national highway, one passes fields of sugar cane, corn and rice fields, hills and mountains. The terrain slopes downwards to the South China Sea. Because of its rolling terrain and coastline location, agriculture (sugarcane, rice, corn, vegetables, coconut, fruits) and aquaculture are Nasugbu's main industries.\n\nNasugbu is politically subdivided into 42 barangays, all classified as rural except for Barangays 3, 5 and 11 in the poblacion.\n\nThe climate of Nasugbu falls under the first type of classification, Type I, characterized by two pronounced seasons: Dry season from November to April and wet season for the rest of the year. The annual average temperature in the municipality is . January is the coolest month having an average temperature of , while April is the warmest month registering an average temperature of .\n\nIn the , Nasugbu had a population of . The population density was .\n\nMost of the people in Nasugbu are Tagalogs. In recent years, there's been a noticeable increase of Visayans in Barangay Wawa and other barangays. The main language spoken is Tagalog, and a significant number now speaks Cebuano. Due to the historic relevance of the town, a small number of families speak Spanish. Many among the educated class speak English.\n\nA great majority of Nasugbugueños are Catholics. Although there is a legislated separation of church and state in the Philippines, the town fiesta on December 3 is a holiday. Nasugbu is also one of the most important centres of the Roman Catholic Church in the Archdiocese of Lipa. Though officially called Vicariate I, it is sometimes called the Vicariate of San Francisco Xavier in honour of the town's patron saint. Some barangays have their own respective patron saints and celebrate a feast day other than that of Saint Francis Xavier's.\n\nWith the growing number of Catholic faithfuls in the town, it has been proposed that Saint Francis Xavier Parish would be divided into two. The proposed new parish is to be called the Parish of San Antonio de Padua and would have its parochial church at barangay Kaylaway. As of today, San Antonio de Padua functions as parish with its own council and ministries.\n\nThe minority belong to other minor religions like the indigenous Iglesia ni Cristo; The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons); Evangelical Christianity and the UCCP.\n\nIn Presidential Decree 1520, president Ferdinand Marcos declared some areas of the municipality as a potential tourism area. Since then, Nasugbu has had a tourism industry focused primarily on its beaches. Its proximity to Manila makes it a popular choice.\n\nSome economic highlights are the development of Nasugbu's agro-industrial industry (feed mills, meat processing and poultry-growing) by building more farm-to-market roads. Hiking in the mountains and virgin forests around Nasugbu is popular. One particular spot, Karakawa, is a series of multi-tiered naturally formed rock pools hewn out of the mountain. The smallest pool is about the size of a jacuzzi while the biggest measures about 25 square meters. The pools are more than 6 meters deep, and one can catch fish in the pools.\n\nAt the moment, because of its rolling terrain and coastline location, agriculture (sugarcane, rice, corn, vegetables, coconut, fruits) and aquaculture are Nasugbu's main industries. It is home to the Central Azucarera Don Pedro, one of the country's largest sugar producers.\n\nBeing home to one of the largest sugar milling companies of the country, the production of sweets is a significant portion of the local economy. Nasugbu is the only town in Luzon which hosts a \"bibingkahan\" (rice cake area) in its public market. There are at least 10 kinds of rice cakes that are found only in Nasugbu, in addition to the varieties that could be found elsewhere in the country. Many Nasugbugueños, even those who do not do much cooking, take pride in making a variety of sweets such as sweetened yam, sweetened coconut and similar products.\n\nNasugbu West Central School is the largest elementary school in the Southern Tagalog region. Other elementary schools in the town proper include Lourderette School, Pedagogia, Saint Paul's and Creative Dreams School. Most barangays have their own grade schools, and some in recent years also have high schools, as in Bilaran and Kaylaway.\n\nNasugbu Institute, founded in 1932, is a private high school. Nasugbu also hosts the high school campus of the Batangas State University, known locally as the Apolinario R. Apacible School of Fisheries (or simply \"Fisheries\"). It was formerly a fishery school with courses including Fish Culture, Fish Capture, and Fish Preservation, but was later attached to the Batangas State University. Presently, aside from Fishery courses, the school also offers other courses like Nutrition and Dietetics, Nursing, Education and Tourism. Other relatively new high schools are Nasugbu Christian Faith Academy, Adelaido A. Bayot Memorial School and the RB Cordero Academy. Other schools in Nasugbu include Nasugbu East Central School, Nasugbu West Central School, Nicolites Montessori School, Pantalan Elementary School and Bilaran Elementary School and many others.\n\nThe town is home to the Nasugbu Auditorium, where many cultural activities regularly are held. It is the town's primary theatre and showcases not only plays but also concerts of popular artists and bands.\n\nThere are no historical documents recounting Nasugbu's foundation. The earliest written records of the place are of the founding by the Jesuits of the Parish of St. Francis Xavier in 1852.\n\nNasugbu did not become an important commercial center due to the proximity of Balayan.\n\nThe first historical account of this town relates to when a native tribesman, known only as Matienza, led his fellow Nasugbugueños, together with some natives from the nearby Lian, in revolt against a large land grant to the Roxases. This revolt failed. This happened in the latter part of the 19th century.\n\nNasugbu was not as much irrigated as the fields of nearby towns, making it one of the towns that suffered much when the town of Lipa was besieged on 18 June 1896. Ten days later the effects for the people of Nasugbu were so dire that the Gobernadorcillo authorised taking 1000 pesos from the treasury of Lipa to provide a rice subsidy for the Nasugbugueños.\n\nWhen the revolution officially started in Batangas in September 1896, an organised revolt also broke out in the town of Nasugbu, together with the towns of Balayan, Lian, Talisay and Lemery seven weeks later. The \"Revolt of Nasugbu\" was led by Luciano San Miguel and was one of the largest revolts in the province. However, on 12 December 1896, San Miguel unknowingly led his men into a trap, and Nasugbu suffered the greatest number of casualties in the revolution.\n\nIn September 1898, the town of Cauit (Cavite) declared independence from Spanish rule. This made the life of the Caviteños more tumultuous than before. Due to this, the people of the nearby town of Alfonso invaded the Roxas estate and started to harass the tenants there. Although the municipal officials of Nasugbu responded quickly and complained to their counterparts in Cavite, the citizens were already defying authority.\n\nDuring times of war, Batangas was administered by the Governor General and the right of habeas corpus was suspended, resulting in more casualties.\n\nThe Dark Age of Nasugbu was compensated by a great archaeological discovery. According to the National Museum of the Philippines, a group of scientists found a wooden cow a year before the Second World War. Knowing that it was of great significance to the history of the country, the cow was immediately handed over the National Museum, but it did not survive the destruction of the war. However, a year after the war, a new archaeological artifact was excavated in the nearby town of Calatagan, which in turn became the most important prehistoric artifact of the country.\n\nNasugbu's greatest contribution to the archaeological world is the San Diego Ship Wreck, discovered by a group of scientists in 1991 with the cooperation of the governments of France, the United States and the Philippines.\n\nIn his book, \"Los Succesos de las Islas Filipinas\", Fr. Antonio de Morga wrote that being the Admiral of the Islands, he tried to defend the country from Dutch soldiers, who was then under the leadership of Admiral Oliver Van Noort. but since de Morga had very little experience in warfare, he led the \"San Diego\" to sink somewhere south of Manila Bay. It was the first ever recorded battle between two European powers in Asian waters.\n\nThis eventful sinking of the \"San Diego\" happened at the dawn of 14 December 1600. Although the fight resulted in a draw, the news of the sinking reached every main city of the Old World. According to the chronicles, the ship contained so much food and battle gear that there was no room for people that would operate them.\n\nDe Morga, however, failed to give the exact location of the wreck. The ship remained sunk in Nasugbu waters for almost 500 years until its 1991 discovery. To date, it remains the country's most important submarine archaeological finding. From it, the National Museum of the Philippines was able to collect about 5000 artifacts representing a time capsule of Asia, Europe and the Americas.\n\nThe artifacts include Asian jars and ceramics from Vietnam and China, weaponry from Japan (like sabres) and Portugal (like cannons and gilded articles believed to come from Iberoamerica. According also to the National Museum, the wreckage contained some of the world's best preserved astrolabes.\n\nThe artifacts were also exhibited in France in 1995 and Germany in 1996, returning to Manila for the celebration of the centennial of Philippine independence in 1998. Today, the \"San Diego\" collection remains the most extensive collection in the National Museum, occupying a large portion of the building's first floor and the whole second floor.\n\nNasugbu is the site of the first recorded naval battle between European troops in Southeast Asia — at Fortune Island to the west of the town.\n\nOn August 3, 2007, by \"Executive Order 647\", President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo declared Nasugbu, known for its white sand beach resorts, a special tourism zone, mandating the formation of a private sector-led \"Nasugbu eminent persons group\" to oversee development. The Nasugbu Special Tourism Zone will cover areas included in the Nasugbu Tourism Development Plan prepared by the municipal government and validated by the Philippine Tourism Authority (PTA). SM Investments Corp. (SMIC) plans to construct a 59 km² resort, the Hamilo Coast, at the NSTZ. SMIC will also establish a ferry service from the Manila Bay terminal of the SM Central Business Park in the Mall of Asia to Hamilo Coast, due to be operational by 2008. Also included in the tourism zone are Punta Fuego and Mounts Palay-Palay–Mataas-na-Gulod Protected Landscape where Mount Pico de Loro is located.\n\nLast May 2016 elections Antonio \"Tony\" Barcelon won the mayoralty seat.\n\n\n"}

He and Rizal were friends during the time when they were fighting for the Philippine's independence from Spain.\n\nIt is bounded on the north by Lipa City, east by San Antonio, south by Rosario and west by Lipa City and Rosario.\n\nThe town was originally part of Rosario and known as \"Lumang Bayan\" or \"Sambat\".

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nRosario is considered as among the interior municipalities of the Batangas Bay Region comprising eleven municipalities and two cities whose catchment areas drain into the Batangas Bay. The town is also dubbed as \"The Rice Granary of Batangas\".\n\nAccounts show that the origin of Rosario was a Christian settlement along the coast of Lobo. The settlement became prey to the pirate raids during the Moro wars of the 18th century.\n\nThe Moro or pirate raids forced the inhabitants of the settlement to the safety of the ravine and forest on the north-west bank of Kansahayan River (now the Municipality of Taysan). Here the settlement was relocated. However, at the height of the Moro Wars in the second half of the 18th century, the vicious Moro raids reached Kansahayan. In one of their forays the Parish Priest is said to be among those slain.\n\nThe inhabitants decided to leave Kansahayan. They headed farther north holding a novena and praying the rosary in the process of their flight. On the 9th night of the novena, the fleeing inhabitants reached the river bank of Tubig ng Bayan (a river originating from Lipa) in now the town of Padre Garcia. Here they finally settled. Living in peace and prosperity, the grateful town’s people erected a stone church south of the river bank in honor of their benefactress, the Lady of the Most Holy Rosary Parish. The town was named \"Santo Rosario\".\n\nSanto Rosario was razed to the ground during the Philippine-American War. In the early American military occupation of Santo Rosario, a cavalry officer, Captain Ed H. Boughton, came upon the big spring at the foot of Tombol Hill. He decided to relocate the town west of the spring, where Rosario's population center is now.\n\nOfficial records show that on June 9, 1902, a council of prominent citizens of the town met under a mango tree beside Tombol Spring. On the spot they formally organized the municipal government of Rosario. The following assumed the first key positions of the town government:\n\n\nA wealthy landowner, Don Antonio Luansing donated for the town's public buildings and plaza.\n\nLocal historians were not unanimous as the exact date of the founding of this town. Certainly it was among those organized by the ecclesiastical authorities after the creation of Batangas as a province in 1581. It is generally believed to have come to the existence in 1687 while still located along the coast of Lobo during the term of Don Nicolas Morales as \"gobernadorcillo\". Originally, Rosario comprised the whole parts of the municipalities of Lobo, Taysan, Ibaan, San Juan de Bolbok and the entire municipality of Padre Garcia.\n\nThe old settlement in Kansayahan now bears the name of Pinagbayanan, a thriving marketing post in the municipality of Taysan. The old town site of Santo Rosario had been named Lumang Bayan before it was renamed Padre Garcia when the latter was created and carved out Rosario in 1950 as a separate municipality.\n\nRosario is located at .\n\nAccording to the Philippine Statistics Authority, the has a land area of constituting of the total area of Batangas.\n\nRosario is politically subdivided into 48 barangays. Malaya was formerly known as \"Munting Tubig\".\n\nFor purposes of community organization and effective delivery of social development projects, the Office for Sustainable Development under supervision of the Office of the Municipal Mayor in 1995, divided the 48 barangays into 8 barangay clusters with 6 member barangays each.\n\nThis system was patterned after the resolutions traditionally passed by the Sangguniang Bayan as part of its organizational plan following the general elections when new members are elected into office for a new term.\n\nConsequently, the barangay cluster arrangement was adopted and served as the framework for land use development strategies enunciated under the \"Comprehensive Land Use Plan of Rosario, Batangas for Planning Period 2000-2010 (CLUP)\".\n\nIn the , Rosario had a population of .

{"id": "2123246", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2123246", "title": "Army of Me", "text": "Army of Me\n\n\"Army of Me\" is a song recorded by Icelandic musician Björk for her second studio album \"Post\" (1995). It was released on 21 April 1995 by One Little Indian as the lead single from the album. The song was written and produced by Björk and Graham Massey, who helped her in producing and writing the majority of her third album. Lyrically, the industrial rock song was inspired by the damaging behavior of Björk's brother, and in the lyrics she tells him to stand up and to regain control of his life. It was well received by music critics, who noted its darkness and praised Björk's energy. \"Army of Me\" was a commercial success and the first single from Björk to enter the top 10 on the UK Singles Chart.\n\nBjörk premiered the song on some gigs during the Debut Tour before the release of the album. She performed it in a series of TV appearances, and notably, for the first time on \"Top of the Pops\" with Skunk Anansie. Additionally, the song was performed on every date of the Post Tour. The song was featured on Björk's compilation album, \"Greatest Hits\" (2002).\n\nThe song's accompanying music video was the product of another collaboration between Björk and Michel Gondry. It features the singer driving an enormous vehicle through a city, fighting with a gorilla for re-obtaining a diamond and putting a bomb in a museum to free a boy. In 2005, Björk, to help the UNICEF, released a charity benefit compilation entitled \"\", which featured a series of covers and remixes by artists from all over the world.\n\n\"Army of Me\" was written in 1992 by Björk and Graham Massey, during one of the first recording sessions for \"Debut\", along with \"The Modern Things\", but Björk decided to put the songs on hold and to wait for releasing them. Even so, Björk performed the songs during some dates on her Debut Tour. The singer further explained the song: \"Imagine you're in a club full of heavy metal types and grunge people; 'Army of Me' is like someone's granny blasting out over the PA and saying, 'Snap out of it! Stop whining! Wash your hair! Smarten yourself up!\n\nThe single was released on April 21, 1995 as a two-CD edition. The first CD contained the Icelandic version of \"You've Been Flirting Again\" and the cave version of \"Cover Me\", both from \"Post\". The cave version of \"Cover Me\" was recorded in a cave in Bahamas, and sounds of flying bats can be heard in the background. The single also contained \"Sweet Intuition\", a song composed by Björk and Black Dog, whose lyrics will be the base of the composing for another song written by Björk for Madonna: \"Bedtime Story\". The second CD contained, among other remixes, a version of \"Army of Me\" which features Skunk Anansie. The track was recorded and mixed in less than 7 hours, as recalled by the band, and features Björk making heavy use of screaming vocals.\n\nThe lyrics of the song are about Björk's brother, as revealed by the singer, and show Björk daring him to move up and find a job to keep his life on, and also for him to not fall into bad things and learn to defend himself: \"It's actually written to a relative of mine who had been a bit out of order for a while. I'm not sure why I wrote it. Maybe I felt that \"Debut\" had been such a polite, shy album – there was a side of me that was so shy and such a beginner, I was very flattered when everyone loved Debut but also a bit confused because it wasn't really me. Maybe 'Army Of Me' was an attempt to balance it out.\"\n\nThe song samples the drum line of \"When the Levee Breaks\" by Led Zeppelin. The song is dominated by a heavy bass line and features synthesizer. Mim Udovitch has described the song as \"grinding techno fusion\". The verses' melody and bass line are in Locrian mode, which is unusual for a pop song; the chorus features a Dø-Db-Cm chord progression.\n\nEric Handerson of Slant Magazine found that the song \"provocatively merges a Weather Report-esque jazz-fusion bass riff with a heavy-timbered rock drumbeat to match her contemptuous vocal delivery ('Self-sufficience, please!')\" Natalie Curtis described the song as \"inelegant\", on a similar note, Mim Udovitch of \"Rolling Stone\" dubbed it as \"ominous, anthemic\", with Lou Stathis of MTV stating that \"Army Of Me\" is \"booming, martial-march techno\". According to Brantley Bardin of \"Details\", \"Army of Me\" is \"the album’s straightest song, a manifesto about self-sufficiency\", while for Liz Hoggard of \"The Observer\", the track is \"brutal yet tender\". Stuart Maconie of \"Q\" magazine praised the song by stating that its lyrics carries \"bold and refreshing sentiments for a rock song. Refreshingly Icelandic sentiments\", and further stating that \"'Army Of Me' not only sounds fabulous—Led Zeppelin and techno welded together into a surging, operatic whole—but possesses a briskly pull-yourself-together tone. 'Stand up, you’ve got to manage ... /You're all right, there's nothing wrong / ... get to work / and if you complain once more, you'll meet an army of me\".\n\nIn a very positive review, Heather Phares of AllMusic stated that \"Atypical in its relative starkness and darkness, 'Army of Me' casts Björk against type as a warrior goddess fed up with whining, instead of her usual cyber-pixie persona. The first single from 1995's otherwise buoyant Post and a featured track on the \"Tank Girl\" soundtrack, as well as in the film. The song's pounding industrial beat, menacing synth bass, and unusually aggressive lyrics ('And if you complain once more / You'll meet an army of me') stand in sharp contrast to the rest of the album and to most of her previous work. However, 'Army of Me' seems like a precursor of the dark, introspective tone and sparse electronica arrangements of Björk's next album, 1997's \"Homogenic\". The song was also turned into another video collaboration between Björk and her longtime director, Michael Gondry. The clip depicts Björk as a tank girl of sorts who goes to the dentist (which happens to be a gorilla) to have a sore tooth pulled—only to have it turn into a giant diamond, which she uses to fuel her tank. Like the song, it all makes sense in Björk's surreal, intellectually playful way\". According to \"The New York Times\" writer Joy Press, Army of Me' is so menacing and inorganic-sounding it verges on industrial rock\", and in a review, \"Pulse!\" defined the song \"a staggering juggernaut of a track\". While reviewing \"Post\", Andy Smith of \"The Providence Journal\" stated that \"\"Post\" is an eclectic affair, opening with the assertive industrial clang of Army of Me.\n\nIn 1995, \"Army of Me\" won an Icelandic Music Award for Song of the Year. The song was also ranked number 316 in \"Blender\" magazine's \"The 500 Greatest Songs Since You Were Born\". In 2012, the song was ranked number 71 in Consequence of Sound's \"Top 100 Songs Ever\".\n\nFor the music video of the song, Björk collaborated again with French film director Michel Gondry, who'd directed her video for \"Human Behaviour\" in 1993. (Gondry and Björk would continue their collaboration until 2011 when the video for \"Crystalline\" was released.) In the odd and surreal music video, Björk is the driver of a tanker truck. The singer \"said that she wanted to capture that 'tanker-truck' feeling, the sense of a big machine grinding unstoppably through town\" and further stated: \"I thought I should be driving a very, very big truck to try to wake this person who's asleep, so I get the biggest truck in the world, and I'm so mad I've got metallic teeth, because when you're really angry, you grind your teeth. So I have to go to the dentist, who tries to steal away from me a diamond I don't know I have.\"\n\nThe dentist is actually a gorilla, and Björk explained:\nBjörk and her label declined to use footage from the film \"Tank Girl\" (which features the track on its soundtrack) in the music video for \"Army of Me\".\n\nThe first seconds of the music video show a young man in cryonic slumber. It then cuts to Björk, wearing a black karate gi, driving a large vehicle through a city. The passers-by seem to ignore the mass of the vehicle. The vehicle begins to sputter and slow, prompting Björk to check the motor. Before floating off the vehicle, she turns to the camera and shows metallic teeth. The vehicle's engine assembly consists of a mouth in which all of the teeth appear rotten, comically exaggerated by a shaggy-looking man engulfed in a stench-cloud crawling out of the mouth and offending passers-by.\n\nBjörk touches her cheek, appearing to have a toothache, and proceeds to a nearby dentist's office. While she is going to the room of the dentist, her image appears reflected in a series of mirrors that make it impossible to distinguish her real self. She is examined by the dentist, an anthropomorphic gorilla, who discovers a diamond in her mouth. The dentist attempts to steal the diamond for himself, but Björk leaps onto his back and pummels him, and, retrieving the diamond, escapes the office. She takes the diamond back to her vehicle, all the while it multiplies in size until she is barely able to carry it. Björk tosses the diamond into the vehicle's mouth, apparently correcting its earlier affliction.\n\nShe then drives to a museum and proceeds inside, carrying a satchel containing a bomb. Sneaking past the museum's guards, she places the bomb on one of the exhibits - the young man seen in the beginning of the video lying on an altar in a deep sleep. She then bolts toward the museum's exit, concerning the guards and other patrons. She makes it out of the building just moments before the bomb explodes. After the explosion, she re-enters the building to find the man from the altar, who appears to have been just wakened by the blast. Björk hugs him, crying teardrops of jewels.\n\nThe video was well received by critics. Tim Walker of \"The Independent\" thought that \"catchy, commercial song that was utterly original, and she's easily beautiful enough to have taken advantage of her sexuality in the video, but instead she got Michel Gondry to make a brilliant promo about her going to a gorilla dentist to get a huge diamond pulled out of her mouth\". Gondry's visual imagery was heavily praised: \"Gondry is a treat with visual details in defining his realities, and he provides in 'Army of Me'. The museum sequence furnishes an example: Before Björk bombs it, there are many artworks on the walls, each piece reflecting the apparent banality of the museum. One area shows a person observing a work which is a painting of a person in an art museum observing a work. After the explosion, everything is torn apart, bathed in smoke. Björk comes and retrieves her loved one, crying small diamonds onto his shoulder.\"\n\nThe ending of \"Army of Me\" music video depicted Björk bombing an art museum, and due to a recent terrorist bombing in Oklahoma City, MTV removed it from its playlist before it even aired. However, within weeks it was broadcast, but cut off before the bomb goes off. There exists some version of the music video which censored the explosion of the bomb, and some showing \"To Be Continued\" at the end.\n\nIn 1995, The video was nominated for two MTV Video Music Awards, one for Best Special Effects in a Video and one for International Viewer's Choice Awards – MTV Europe, losing the former to \"Love Is Strong\" by The Rolling Stones and the latter to \"Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me\" by U2.\n\nThe song was performed in a few live shows. Björk premiered the song a day before the release of the single, on April 20, 1995, on \"Top of the Pops\", with the Skunk Anansie. This particular performance featured additional vocals by Skin. Björk performed the song live on Italian musical show \"Festivalbar\" and on \"The White Room\", along with \"I Miss You\".\n\nThe song was performed on the Debut Tour before the official release. The performance on the Post Tour was called \"explosive\" by Adrien Begrand of PopMatters and was released on \"Live Box\", in the Post Live CD, with the same performance being released on Björk's video \"Live at Shepherds Bush Empire\". The song was performed on the Vespertine World Tour, where it was accompanied by Zeena Parkins. The performance was called \"extra-gritty\" and the accompaniment of Parkins was described as giving the song \"fresh urgency\".\n\nThe song was performed on the Greatest Hits Tour and on the Volta Tour, with the latter performance being included on \"Voltaïc\", both in the live version recorded at the Olympic Studios in London, and in the DVD \"Live in Paris\".\n\nThe song was performed again in summer 2012 in Lollapalooza Chile as part of the Biophilia Tour replacing most of the instrumental part with a Tesla coil.\n\nThe song received a wide coverage from other artists. German metalcore band Caliban covered this song on their 2006 album \"The Undying Darkness\". The female vocals on the chorus were recorded by Tanja Keilen. Belgian metal band Silent covered this song on their 2005 self-titled demo. The alternative metal/post-hardcore band Helmet recorded a cover of \"Army of Me\" which was released on a \"Music for Our Mother Ocean\" benefit compilation. The Australian metal band Many Machines on Nine covered \"Army of Me\" on their self-titled 2000 EP. A jazz cover was released by the Yaron Herman Trio on their album \"A Time for Everything\" in 2007. Abandoned Pools, an alternative rock band have also covered the song, which is available on \"The Reverb EP\". Powerman 5000 released a cover of this song on their \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly Vol. 1\" compilation. Sin, a French industrial band, covered the song, available on \"Errare Digital Est\", Recall 2003. Oliver Weers, a Danish rock vocalist made semi-famous by his participation in the Danish \"X Factor\" in 2008, released a heavy metal-style cover version of \"Army of Me\" in 2008 on an album entitled \"Get Ready\". Australian alternative metal band Beanbag covered the song on their 2001 second album \"Welladjusted\". English rock band Drama recorded a cover of the song to perform at the 2010 UK Live & Unsigned regional final in Manchester, March 7. Polish progressive metal/post-metal band Proghma-C recorded a cover version on their debut album \"Bar-do Travel\", 2009. French progressive metal band Klone also recorded a cover of the song as a bonus track on their 2010 album \"Black Days\". Italian nu metal band Exilia recorded a cover of this song on their album \"Can't Break Me Down\" in 2005.\n\nIn 2005, Björk opened a contest to choose from various remixes for the song, to release a compilation to help raise funds for charity. Over 600 remixes were submitted and Björk was helped in the choosing of the tracks by fellow writer and composer Graham Massey. The compilation, called \"\" was released in May 2005 and as of January 2006, the album had raised around £250,000 to help UNICEF's work in the south east Asian region.\n\nIn addition to appearing in \"Tank Girl\" in 1995, the song was included in the soundtrack of \"Sucker Punch\" with further instrumentation by Skunk Anansie and remixing by Marius de Vries. The song has also been used in an episode of The Handmaid's Tale, and more recently in the second episode of the first season of A Discovery Of Witches.\n\nThese are the formats and track listings of major single releases of \"Army of Me\".\n\n\n\n\nCredits adapted from \"Post\" album liner notes.\n\nSeveral other remixes (and covers) appear on \"\".\n\n"}

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nThe town is known for its baroque church and the Pinagbayanan excavation, the most important archaeological site in the municipality.\n\nIn the years 1698 until 1836, San Juan was just a barrio of the large town of Rosario located in the eastern part of Batangas. From 1837, the government of San Juan was governed by tinientes or Deputies with term of one to two years. However, when San Juan was recognized as a separate town in 1843, the position of tinientes was replaced by Cabezas de Barangay serving one for each new barrio. It was only in 1848 when the Spanish government officially recognized the independence of San Juan from its mother town of Rosario, and was given the name San Juan de Bocboc. \n\nSan Juan was headed by a Gobernadorcillo in 1864. The first Goberdanorcillo was Don Camilo Perez, a prominent citizen who initiated the separation of San Juan from Rosario. He is considered as the founder of the town, and was honored for his contribution in public works and peace and order in the newly created town.\n\nOn October 28, 1883, San Juan experienced a major disaster due to continuous winds and intense storm rain. Huge flood from the Bancoro and Bangbang Rivers hit the town resulting to the destruction of houses, drowning of livestocks and planted crops, and the devastation of the church and its convent. In 1886, the flooding become worse in the town. The parish priest had to erect a temporary church and convent in a site seven kilometers away from the town. \n\nOn January 18, 1886, the officials of the town initiated the transfer of the new town to Calitcalit. The transfer of the Lumang Bayan to its present location was approved by Governor General Valeriano Weyler on December 12, 1890, during the administration of Gobernadorcillo Benedicto De Villa. San Juan de Bocboc was renamed as Bolbok by the virtue of Act No. 2390 dated February 28, 1914. In the early years of 1920, Bolbok was then renamed as San Juan, in honor of San Juan Nepomuceno, the town’s patron saint.\n\nSan Juan is located at , at the easternmost part of Batangas province. North of San Juan is the neighboring town of Candelaria, with Malaking Ilog River defining its geographical boundary. Tayabas Bay lies east and the hills on the eastern portion separate it from the towns of Lobo and Rosario.\n\nAccording to the Philippine Statistics Authority, the has a land area of constituting of the total area of Batangas.\n\nSan Juan is politically subdivided into 42 barangays.\n\nIn the , San Juan had a population of .

According to RA 7916 or the Special Economic Zone Act of 1995, ecozones are selected areas with highly developed or which have the potential to be developed into agro-industrial, industrial, tourist/recreational, commercial, banking, investment and financial centers. \n\nSan Juan is a tourist destination known for its white-sand beaches. The tourism and aquaculture industries provide jobs to the town's people and income to the town economy.\n\nBecause of its fertile land, the municipality is one of the top suppliers of agricultural products in the province.\n\nThe town has also a coconut wine and pottery industry.\n\nHere's the list of the total annual income, assets, expenses and equity of San Juan since 2015, according to the Annual Audit Reports of the Commission on Audit: \n\nThe 2019 local elections in San Juan was held on May 13, 2019 resulting to the election of the new municipal mayor and municipal vice mayor.

{"id": "2123252", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2123252", "title": "Global motion compensation", "text": "Global motion compensation\n\nGlobal motion compensation \"(GMC)\" is a motion compensation technique used in video compression to reduce the bitrate required to encode video. It is most commonly used in MPEG-4 ASP, such as with the DivX and Xvid codecs.\n\nGlobal motion compensation describes the motion in a scene based on a single affine transform instruction. The reference frame is panned, rotated and zoomed in accordance to GMC warp points to create a prediction of how the following frame will look. Since this operation works on individual pixels (rather than blocks), it is capable of creating predictions that are not possible using block-based approaches.\n\nEach macroblock in such a frame can be compensated using global motion (no further motion information is then signalled) or, alternatively, local motion (as if GMC were off). This choice, while costing an additional bit per macroblock, can improve prediction quality and therefore reduce residual.\n\nBecause the transforms used in global motion compensation are only added to the encoding stream when used, they do not have a constant bitrate overhead. A predicted frame which uses GMC is called an S-frame (sprite frame) while a predicted frame encoded without GMC is called either a P-frame, if it was predicted purely by previous (past) frames, or a B-frame if it was predicted jointly with past and future frames (an unpredicted frame encoded as a whole image is referred to as an I-frame).\n\nDivX \nOffers 1 warp-point GMC encoding: This enables easier hardware support in DivX certified and non-certified devices.\nBut as 1 warp-point GMC limits the global transform to panning operation only (since panning can be described using blocks), this implementation rarely improves video quality.\n\nXvid \nOffers 3 warp-point GMC encoding: As a result, it currently has no hardware support.\n\nGMC failed to meet expectations of dramatic improvements in motion compensation, and as a result it was omitted from the H.264/MPEG-4 AVC specification - designed as a successor to MPEG-4 ASP. Most of GMC's benefits could be obtained via better motion vector prediction. GMC also represents a large computational cost during encoding which yields relatively minor quality improvements.\n\nDue to the extra decoding CPU cost of global motion compensation, most hardware players do not support global motion compensation.\n\n"}

It borders the cities of Calamba to the north, Los Baños to the north-east, Alaminos to the east, Tanauan and Malvar to the west, and Lipa to the south.\n\nSanto Tomas is the hometown of Philippine Revolution and Philippine-American War hero Miguel Malvar, the last Filipino General to surrender to the Americans. On September 7, 2019, the Republic Act 11086, or the City Charter of Santo Tomas, was ratified on a plebiscite by the electorate of Santo Tomas.\n\nThe patron of Santo Tomas is Saint Thomas Aquinas, patron of Catholic schools, whose feast day is celebrated every March 7.\n\nThe then-municipality of Santo Tomas was founded in 1666, with Captain Manuel Melo as its first head. Originally, it was composed of a large \"Poblacion\". When the Spanish friars arrived, their first and foremost objective was to construct a church near the river to satisfy their propensity for water. Thus, the present site of the Roman Catholic Church was chosen, near the San Juan River. As years went by, more houses were built around the church. This became the center of the Poblacion.\n\nOther groups of houses were scattered all over the area. They were given such odd names as \"Kabaong\", because the stones along the road were coffin shaped; \"Putol\" because the trail was cut by a creek that crossed over it, \"Aptayin\", because \"apta\" of fine shrimps were found in the brook, \"Biga\", because biga trees abounded there, and \"Camballao\", because twin rivers divided the place. These different unit groups comprised the barrios of the town.\n\nThe natives were by nature God-fearing, peaceful and obedient. The conquerors did not much have difficulty in enforcing decrees and orders. One such irrevocable decree was to change the original names of the barrios to the names of Saints in the Catholic Calendar and to place each them under its patrotonio, the former \"Pook\" and \"Aptayin\" were joined together and called San Bartolome, \"Kabaong\" was changed to San Vicente, \"Biga\" to Santa Anastacia, and \"Camballao\" to San Isidro Sur and Isidro Norte. The whole town was given the name of \"Santo Tomas de Aquino\", a high Prince of the Dominican Order to where most of the first friars belonged. As time went by, more barrios were added to the list each with an assumed name of a saint.\n\nFrom the year 1666, the head of the town had different titles. He was variously known as \"Captain\" from 1666 to 1782; \"Alcalde\" from 1783 to 1788; \"Gobernadorcillo\" from 1789 to 1821; \"Presidente Local\" from 1822 to 1899; \"Presidente Municipal\" from 1900 to 1930; and \"Municipal Mayor\" from 1931 to the present. \n\nIn 2015, Nelson P.

Its poblacion (central business district) is designated as a National Historical Landmark. The municipality is known as the Balisong and Barong Tagalog Capital of the Philippines. The town is home to hundreds of heritage structures dating from the Spanish colonial period. Scholars have been pushing for its inclusion in the UNESCO World Heritage List.\n\nThe town of Taal was founded by Augustinian friars in 1572. In 1575, the town transferred later to the edge of Domingo lake, now Taal Lake in 1575. In 1754, Taal Volcano erupted endangering the town of Taal which stood at present day San Nicolas. Threatened by the new danger, the townspeople, together with the Augustinian Francisco Benchucillo, sought refuge in the sanctuary of Caysasay.\n\nIn 1955 the northern barrios of San Nicolas, Gipit, Bangin, Pansipit, Calangay, Sinturisan, Talang, Abilo, Balete, Bancora, Saimsim, Maabud, Mulawin, Tambo, Calumala, Alasas, Calawit, and Pulangbato were separated from Taal and formed into the municipality of San Nicolas.\n\nAccording to the Philippine Statistics Authority, the has a land area of constituting of the total area of Batangas.\n\nA dominant feature of the province of Batangas is Taal Lake. It covers an area of and is drained by Pansipit River down into Balayan Bay. Pansipit is one of the major ecological highways that allow migration of two fish species: \"maliputo\" (\"Cranx ignobilis\") and \"muslo\" (\"Cranx marginalis\") which are unique to lake Taal. Adult fish migrate to the sea from Taal Lake via Pansipit River and Palanas River in Lemery. The \"tawilis\" (\"Harengula tawilis\") is a freshwater sardine also endemic to Taal lake.\n\nTaal has two seasons: dry from November to April, and wet during the rest of the year. The lowest minimum temperature does not drop below while the highest maximum temperature of occurs from March to July of each year.\n\n\nTaal is politically subdivided into 42 barangays.\n\nIn the , Taal had a population of . The population density was .\n\nThe first census in 1903 recorded a total population of 17,525. The 2007 population was 51,459 growing at 2.44% annually over the previous 7 years, with 7,961 households. By 2010, the population slightly increased to 51,503.\n\nSince the Spanish period, the people of Taal lived by farming and commerce. The main produce are cotton, cacao and sugar which are made through the use of crude sugar mill called \"trapeche\". Weaving and embroidery of barong and \"camisa\" (blouses) made from piña are popular home industries. Local embroidery businesses later expanded their products to include curtains, piano covers, pillow cases, table cloth, table napkins and bed covers, adding more fame already earned by Taal embroidery.\n\nOther products produced in the town are: balisong (fan knife) and various food treats such as the \"panocha\" (peanut brittle candy) and \"suman salehiya\" (a sweet \"suman\"), \"tapa\" (cured pork product) and the local longganisa, all of which are available at the public market.

From Vasse's name is taken the name the Vasse, an early name for Busselton, for the land adjacent to where the incident occurred, the town of Vasse, and also a number of geographical features in the area including Vasse River and Vasse Inlet.\n\nBorn in Dieppe and baptised Timothée Thomas Joseph Ambroise Vasse, Vasse was a helmsman second class on the \"Naturaliste\" during the 1801–04 expedition of the \"Géographe\" and \"Naturaliste\" under Nicolas Baudin, which explored much of the south west coast of New Holland (now Western Australia). On 30 May 1801, the expedition anchored in a bay that they named Géographe Bay, and a party went ashore. On the evening of 8 June, during the onset of a wild storm, an attempt was made to return the landed party to the ships. One of the ships' boats was anchored beyond the surf, and ropes were used to haul people from the shore to the boat. Vasse, who was said to be a strong swimmer but was also said in some reports to have been drunk, was lost in the heavy surf and presumed drowned.\n\nA number of stories subsequently emerged that claimed that Vasse had survived. Some time between 1804 and 1807, a rumour that Vasse had survived appeared in some Paris newspapers. Vasse was reported to have been washed ashore, walked south, and been picked up by an American whaler which took him as far as the English Channel. He was then said to have been arrested by an English ship, and incarcerated in an English jail. According to François Péron, enquiries into the story concluded that it was a fabrication.\n\nIn 1838, George Fletcher Moore questioned some of the local Indigenous Australians and was told that Vasse had not drowned. Moore wrote in his diary:\nMoore initially published this story in a letter to \"The Perth Gazette\".\n\nIn 1841, Georgiana Molloy related a different story of Vasse's survival in a letter to Captain James Mangles, but gave no provenance for her version of events.

He was the son of Hasan Buzurg and the Chobanid Dilshad Khatun.\n\nShortly after Shaikh Awais Jalayir succeeded his father, the old enemy of the Jalayirids, the Chobanids, were overrun by the forces of the Golden Horde under Jani Beg in 1357. Malek Asraf was executed, and Azerbaijan was conquered. Following Jani Beg’s withdrawal from Azerbaijan, as well as his son Berdi Beg’s similar abandonment of the region in 1358, the area became a prime target for its neighbors. Shaikh Awais Jalayir, who at first had recognized the sovereignty of the Blue Horde, decided to take the former Chobanid lands for himself, even as a former amir of Malek Asraf’s named Akhichuq attempted to keep the region in Mongol hands. Despite a campaign that ended prematurely, as well as the brief conquest of Azerbaijan by the Muzaffarids, Uvais conquered the area in 1360. In addition to Baghdad, he could now boast Tabriz as a large city under his control.\n\nDuring his reign, Shaikh Awais Jalayir sought to increase his holdings in Persia. He became involved in the power struggles of the Muzaffarids, supporting Shah Mahmud in his efforts against his brother Shah Shuja. Shah Mahmud married one of Shaikh Awais Jalayir’s daughters, and received support around 1363 in his conquest of Shiraz. In 1364 Shaikh Awais Jalayir campaigned against the Shirvan Shah Kai-Ka’us, but a revolt begun by the governor of Baghdad, Khwaja Mirjan, forced him to return to reassert his authority. In 1366 Shaikh Awais Jalayir marched against the Black Sheep Turkmen, defeating their leader, Bairam Khwaja, at the battle of Mush. Later, he defeated the Shirvan Shah, who had attacked Tabriz twice in the meantime. In an effort to extend further east, he fought against Amir Vali, who ruled in Astarabad, and defeated him in Ray. When his brother Amir Zahid died in Ujan, however, he was forced to turn back. The governorship of Ray was trusted in the hands of a Qutlugh Shah, who was followed two years later by ‘Adil Aqa.\n\nDue to his campaigns, Shaikh Awais Jalayir spent much time in Persia, and he died in Tabriz in 1374; Baghdad, however, remained his capital. During his lifetime, the Jalayirid state reached its peak in power. In addition to his military adventures, which were considerable, he was known for his attempts to revive commercial enterprise, which had suffered heavily in the past years, in the region, as well as his patronage to the arts. His chronicler, Abu Bakr al-Qutbi al Ahri, wrote of Shaikh Awais Jalayir’ deeds in the \"Tarikh-i Shaikh Uvais\". Shaikh Awais Jalayir was succeeded by his son Shaikh Hasan Jalayir.\n\n\n\n"}

It is a native to Australia where it roams woodlands, eating insects and seeds at, or near, ground level. Apostlebirds often travel in groups of about 12; for this reason they were named after the Biblical apostles, the twelve chief followers of Jesus Christ.\n\nOriginally described by ornithologist John Gould in 1837, its specific epithet is Latin \"cinerea\" \"grey\". In its own genus \"Struthidea\", it is placed in the family known as the mud-nest builders or Corcoracidae, written as Grallinidae in older books before the removal of the genus \"Grallina\" to the wagtail family. It is one of two remaining species, with the white-winged chough (\"Corcorax melanorhamphos\"), which differs in appearance but exhibits many behavioural similarities. The mudnest builder family Corcoracidae itself is now placed in a narrower \"core corvine\" group, which contains the crows and ravens, shrikes, birds of paradise, fantails, monarch flycatchers, and drongos.\nThe apostlebird was named after the Biblical apostles, the twelve followers of Jesus Christ. In fact, the species travel in family groups of between 6 and 20, which may coalesce with other family groups into large feeding flocks of over 40. Their gregarious nature, and harsh scolding/grating calls have led to a plethora of colloquial names. They can be known locally as \"lousy jacks\" (due to heavy louse infestations), \"happy jacks\", \"happy families\" and \"CWA birds\". The last name is mildly derogatory, referring to the supposed resemblance of apostlebird's constant chatter to a Country Women's Association meeting. \"Grey jumper\" is an alternate name.\n\nMeasuring around 33 cm (13 in) in length, the apostlebird is a predominantly dark grey bird with a long black tail tinted greenish in sunlight. The grey feathers on the head, neck and breast are brushed with paler grey-white and the wings are brownish. The legs and bill are black and the eyes brown or white.\n\nThe natural range is across inland eastern Australia, from the mallee regions of northern Victoria and eastern South Australia, north through New South Wales and central-western Queensland to the Gulf Country. There is an isolated population in the Northern Territory. Dry open woodland is the preferred habitat, especially \"Callitris\" in New South Wales and \"Casuarina\" in Queensland, and Lancewood-Bulwaddi communities in the Northern Territory.\n\nApostlebirds are a socially living, cooperative breeding species with each breeding group generally containing only one breeding pair, the rest being either their helper offspring, kin or unrelated adult birds. Most group members help construct a mud nest, share in incubation of the eggs, and defense of the nest. Once the eggs are hatched, all members of the group help feed the chicks and keep the nest clean.\n\nApostlebirds are a fission-fusion society. In winter, birds flock in larger groups, and as breeding season approaches winter groups break into smaller breeding groups. This change in group size is a consequence of breeding groups merging in the winter and breaking apart again in the summer breeding season. Breeding groups use small, non overlapping home ranges around the nest site, while winter ranges are larger with groups freely interacting with other groups.\n\nBreeding season is from August to December. The nest is a deep cup-shaped structure made of grasses held together with mud or sometimes manure in a tree fork up to seven or eight metres above the ground. Three to five pale blue-white eggs sparsely splotched with brown and lavender shades are laid measuring 22 mm x 29 mm. They are tapered oval in shape.\n\nApostlebirds are not listed as threatened on the Australian Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. However, their conservation status varies from state to state within Australia. For example:\n\n"}

This movement became a success when a model schoolhouse was constructed in the present poblacion of the Municipality of Tingloy sometime in 1921.\n\nDuring the second Regular Session of the third Congress of the Republic of the Philippines, the barrios of Tingloy, Maricaban, Papaya, Pisa, Gamao, and Talahib were separated from the Municipality of Bauan and constituted into the newly created municipality of Tingloy.

Land cultivation of sugarcane farms is on a tenancy basis hereby the tenants share 50% of the production cost and obtains 50% of the income. Sugar is harvested, hauled and brought to the nearby sugar milling companies in the towns of Balayan and Nasugbu. Sugarcane farming is thus the main source of livelihood of the people. It also provides employment for cane cutters, weepers, and haulers who are paid either on a daily or per tone of cane basis.\n\nOther major commercial crops are mango (mainly the Indian variety), and cassava. Fruit-bearing trees and vegetable crops are also planted in the fields, backyards, and home gardens to supply household demands, and augment income.\n\nTuy's original festival was the Salagubang (a kind of root and leaf-eating beetle) Festival. This celebration, however, was discontinued and eventually so replaced due to obvious acceptability reasons by the annual Kambingan (goats and their by-products) Festival.\n\nThe Kambingan Festival is the local way of honoring their town, and a town plaza night food market where people can buy foods and enjoy free net-surfing thru Wi-Fi connection.\n\nInhabitants also celebrate the Mamang-os (sugar cane) Festival for having a good harvest of sugarcane every year.\n\nLand transportation facilities are available in the municipality like public utility jeepneys, light vehicles, trucks, motorcycles, buses, tricycles, trailers, & heavy trucks. Public utility jeepneys are the dominant land transports plying the Balayan-Tuy-Nasugbu routes, and vice versa. Tricycles are the most used public utility that serve the population in different barangays of the municipality. Buses also link the town to Manila and Batangas City.\n\nTuy has eight bridges, all of which are constructed of concrete. Of these eight bridges, six are national, while the other two are provincial.\n\nThe municipality has three telephone systems, as of 2011. One is being operated by Western Batangas Telecommunication System, the other by Digitel. and the other by Globe. A telegraph office dispatches messages thru telegrams. Its office is located at the ground floor of the municipal building together with the post office with one post master, one mail sorter, and two letter carriers who serve the municipality.\n\nAs of 2011, cell phones use keep on spreading, as well as the internet connectivities that the same cell phone service providers offer, namely Digitel, Globe, and PLDT/Smart, among other telecommunication companies.\n\nTuy has no college or tertiary level school and depends mainly on their vocational education system hosted by the municipality.\n\nThere are 3 secondary level schools, mainly Jose Lopez Manzano NHS, Our Lady of Peace Academy, Bolboc NHS, Talon Family Farm School, Tuy NHS, I.B. Calingasan Memorial Institute, and Santiago de Guzman NHS.\n\nThere are also numerous elementary and pre-elementary schools in Tuy, aside from the ones built mainly for each barangay.\n\nAll newspapers, magazines, comics, and other periodicals available in the National Capital Region (NCR) reach the municipality, physically, and through the net, including those available internationally. Likewise, radio, television sets, computer gadgets, and the like in the locality have good and clear receptions of the programs aired in the mass media, and likewise provided in the internet.\n\n"}

In her youth she was caught up in the Christian revival sparked by the preacher Edward Irving but implemented in a milder manner by Rev. Story of Rosneath. She became deeply religious, unusually so, even for the educated classes. She became distant from her own family in both sentiment and geography when she went to stay in Scotland with the Dunlop family at Keppoch House, near Helensburgh. Early in 1829, she accepted a marriage proposal from Captain John Molloy, and they were married on 6 August of that year. Shortly afterward, the Molloys sailed for the Swan River Colony in Western Australia on board the \"Warrior\". The couple then decided to join with a number of other settlers in forming a new subcolony at Augusta.\n\nUntil 1836, Georgiana Molloy's life was one of great hardship, typical of early settlers in Western Australia but unfamiliar to one of her social class in England. The trials of a settler's life were relentless and Georgiana birthed her first and most of her subsequent babies without medical assistance. She lost her first child shortly after birth and later her only son drowned in a well. She was vigorous in body, mind and soul and applied herself to the subsistence life. Initially she felt disdain for the local native flora. However, in December 1836, she received a letter from Captain James Mangles, asking her to collect botanical specimens for him. This letter was to fire in Georgiana a great passion for botany. Thereafter, together with her husband John Molloy, and local indigenous women, she spent nearly all of her leisure time in collecting, collating and documenting botanical specimens of the South West of Western Australia. This area is considered one of the 25 hotspots for biodiversity in the world.\n\nMangles had arranged for a number of people in the colony to collect specimens for him, but had been disappointed with the results. The specimens sent by James Drummond, a professional botanist, were poorly packed and carelessly labelled, and seeds consistently failed to germinate. Other collectors were more careful but largely unskilled. In contrast, Molloy's collections were \"full of pressed plants mounted and set out with delicacy and precision, and carefully numbered... showing great evidence of care and cleanliness in the sorting\" (Hasluck 1955). Mangles broke up Molloy's collections, sending seeds to a number of horticulturists and botanists throughout England. A number of horticulturists had great success growing from Molloy's seeds, and many new species were described. John Lindley, Professor of Botany at University College London, for example, described many new species from her collections, including \"Corymbia calophylla\". In the GBIF collections of specimen data databased from many contributing herbaria show just 25 specimens collected by her. However, eight of these are types: \"Boronia ovata\", \"Drosera menziesii\", \"Diuris carinata\", \"Diuris corymbosa\", \"Caladenia gemmata\", \"Caladenia unguiculata\", \"Caladenia hirta\", and \"Boronia dichotoma\".\n\nIn 1839 the Molloy family moved to the Busselton district. Georgiana Molloy was visited by botanists Ludwig Preiss in 1839 and Drummond in 1842. She continued to collect seed, making use of the knowledge of the local Indigenous Australians, and she taught herself the rudiments of botany from books sent to her by Mangles.\n\nGeorgiana Molloy suffered bouts of ill health after each of her pregnancies. Following the birth of her seventh child, she fell ill and failed to recover. On 8 April 1843, three months after the birth, she died. It was a long and dreadful death with Molloy suffering greatly. She was bed-ridden from December 1842 until her death in April the following year during the Australian summer. On hearing of her death, George Wailes, a horticulturist who had been most successful in growing from Molloy's seeds, wrote to Mangles\nMolloy did not receive much recognition for her contributions to the description of the Western Australian flora. The shrub \"Boronia molloyae\" was named in her honour, as was a street in the Canberra suburb of Cook. Molloy island, also named after her, is located in the Hardy Inlet at the junction of the Blackwood and Scott Rivers north of the mouth of the Blackwood River at Augusta. Her specimens are held at the University of Cambridge Herbarium, The Herbarium of the Royal Botanic Gardens Kew, the Herbarium of the Botanic Garden and Botanical Museum Berlin-Dahlem, and the Herbarium of the University of Montpellier. She has a school (Georgiana Molloy Anglican School) named after her in the Busselton suburb of Yalyalup. Three biographies have been published; \"Georgiana Molloy, Portrait with Background\" by Alexandra Hasluck; \"An All Consuming Passion: Origins, Modernity and the Australian Life of Georgiana Molloy\" by William J. Lines and, most recently, \"Georgiana Molloy, the mind that shines\" by Bernice Barry.\n\nGeorgiana Molloy wrote a number of diaries and many letters which have provided a unique personal narrative. They are held at the Battye Library in Perth, Western Australia and the Cumbria Archive Centre in Carlisle, UK. Many of her letters are cross-written due to the shortage of paper in the isolated colony of Augusta.\n\nGeorgiana Molloy was added to the Anglican Church of Australia 1995 Calendar where her name appears on April 8th, as a \"pioneer church leader and botanist from Western Australia\". She may be commemorated in church on that day in Matins and Evensong and at the Holy Communion.\n\n"}
{"id": "2123310", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2123310", "title": "Jazelle", "text": "Jazelle\n\nJazelle DBX (direct bytecode execution) is an extension that allows some ARM processors to execute Java bytecode in hardware as a third execution state alongside the existing ARM and Thumb modes. Jazelle functionality was specified in the ARMv5TEJ architecture and the first processor with Jazelle technology was the ARM926EJ-S. Jazelle is denoted by a \"J\" appended to the CPU name, except for post-v5 cores where it is required (albeit only in trivial form) for architecture conformance.\n\nJazelle RCT (Runtime Compilation Target) is a different technology and is based on ThumbEE mode and supports ahead-of-time (AOT) and just-in-time (JIT) compilation with Java and other execution environments.\n\nThe most prominent use of Jazelle DBX is by manufacturers of mobile phones to increase the execution speed of Java ME games and applications. A Jazelle-aware Java virtual machine (JVM) will attempt to run Java bytecode in hardware, while returning to the software for more complicated, or lesser-used bytecode operations. ARM claims that approximately 95% of bytecode in typical program usage ends up being directly processed in the hardware.\n\nThe published specifications are very incomplete, being only sufficient for writing operating system code that can support a JVM that uses Jazelle. The declared intent is that only the JVM software needs to (or is allowed to) depend on the hardware interface details. This tight binding facilitates that the hardware and JVM can evolve together without affecting other software. In effect, this gives ARM Holdings considerable control over which JVMs are able to exploit Jazelle. It also prevents open source JVMs from using Jazelle. These issues do not apply to the ARMv7 ThumbEE environment, the nominal successor to Jazelle DBX.\n\nThe Jazelle extension uses low-level binary translation, implemented as an extra stage between the fetch and decode stages in the processor instruction pipeline. Recognised bytecodes are converted into a string of one or more native ARM instructions.\n\nThe Jazelle mode moves JVM interpretation into hardware for the most common simple JVM instructions. This is intended to significantly reduce the cost of interpretation. Among other things, this reduces the need for Just-in-time compilation and other JVM accelerating techniques. JVM instructions that are not implemented in Jazelle hardware cause appropriate routines in the Jazelle-aware JVM implementation to be invoked. Details are not published, since all JVM innards are transparent (except for performance) if correctly interpreted.\n\nJazelle mode is entered via the BXJ instructions. A hardware implementation of Jazelle will only cover a subset of JVM bytecodes. For unhandled bytecodes—or if overridden by the operating system—the hardware will invoke the software JVM. The system is designed so that the software JVM does not need to know which bytecodes are implemented in hardware and a software fallback is provided by the software JVM for the full set of bytecodes.\n\nThe Jazelle instruction set is well documented as Java bytecode. However, ARM has not released details on the exact execution environment details; the documentation provided with Sun's HotSpot Java Virtual Machine goes as far as to state: \"For the avoidance of doubt, distribution of products containing software code to exercise the BXJ instruction and enable the use of the ARM Jazelle architecture extension without [..] agreement from ARM is expressly forbidden.\"\n\nEmployees of ARM have in the past published several white papers that do give some good pointers about the processor extension. Versions of the ARM Architecture Reference Manual available from 2008 have included pseudocode for the \"BXJ\" (Branch and eXchange to Java) instruction, but with the finer details being shown as \"SUB-ARCHITECTURE DEFINED\" and documented elsewhere.\n\nThe Jazelle state relies on an agreed calling convention between the JVM and the Jazelle hardware state. This application binary interface is not published by ARM, rendering Jazelle an undocumented feature for most users and Free Software JVMs.\n\nThe entire VM state is held within normal ARM registers, allowing compatibility with existing operating systems and interrupt handlers unmodified. Restarting a bytecode (such as following a return from interrupt) will re-execute the complete sequence of related ARM instructions.\n\nSpecific registers are designated to hold the most important parts of the JVM state: registers R0–R3 hold an alias of the top of the Java stack, R4 holds Java local operand zero (pointer to codice_1) and R6 contains the Java stack pointer.\n\nJazelle reuses the existing program counter PC or its synonym register R15. A pointer to the \"next\" bytecode goes in R14, so the use of the PC is not generally user-visible except during debugging.\n\nJava bytecode is indicated as the current instruction set by a combination of two bits in the ARM CPSR (Current Program Status Register). The \"T\"-bit must be cleared and the \"J\"-bit set.\n\nBytecodes are decoded by the hardware in two stages (versus a single stage for Thumb and ARM code) and switching between hardware and software decoding (Jazelle mode and ARM mode) takes ~4 clock cycles.\n\nFor entry to Jazelle hardware state to succeed, the JE (Jazelle Enable) bit in the CP14:C0(C2)[bit 0] register must be set; clearing of the JE bit by a [privileged] operating system provides a high-level override to prevent application programs from using the hardware Jazelle acceleration. Additionally, the CV (Configuration Valid) bit found in CP14:c0(c1)[bit 1] must be set to show that there is a consistent Jazelle state setup for the hardware to use.\n\nThe BXJ instruction attempts to switch to Jazelle state, and if allowed and successful, sets the \"J\" bit in the CPSR; otherwise, it \"falls through\" and acts as a standard BX (Branch) instruction. The only time when an operating system or debugger must be fully aware of the Jazelle mode is when decoding a faulted or trapped instruction. The Java program counter (PC) pointing to the next instructions must be placed in the Link Register (R14) before executing the BXJ branch request, as regardless of hardware or software processing, the system must know where to begin decoding.\n\nBecause the current state is held in the CPSR, the bytecode instruction set is automatically reselected after task-switching and processing of the current Java bytecode is restarted.\n\nFollowing an entry into the Jazelle state mode, bytecodes can be processed in one of three ways: decoded and executed natively in hardware, handled in software (with optimised ARM/ThumbEE JVM code), or treated as an invalid/illegal opcode. The third case will cause a branch to an ARM exception mode, as will a Java bytecode of 0xff, which is used for setting JVM breakpoints.\n\nExecution will continue in hardware until an unhandled bytecode is encountered, or an exception occurs. Between 134 and 149 bytecodes (out of 203 bytecodes specified in the JVM specification) are translated and executed directly in the hardware.\n\nLow-level configuration registers, for the hardware virtual machine, are held in the ARM Co-processor \"CP14 register c0\". The registers allow detecting, enabling or disabling the hardware accelerator (if it is available).\n\n\nA \"trivial\" hardware implementation of Jazelle (as found in the QEMU emulator) is only required to support the BXJ opcode itself (treating BXJ as a normal BX instruction) and to return RAZ (Read-As-Zero) for all of the CP14:c0 Jazelle-related registers.\nThe ARMv7 architecture has de-emphasized Jazelle and \"Direct Bytecode Execution\" of JVM bytecodes. In implementation terms, only trivial hardware support for Jazelle is now required: support for entering and exiting Jazelle mode, but not for executing any Java bytecodes.\n\nInstead, the \"Thumb Execution Environment\" (ThumbEE) was to be preferred, but has since also been deprecated. Support for ThumbEE was mandatory in ARMv7-A processors (such as the Cortex-A8 and Cortex-A9), and optional in ARMv7-R processors. ThumbEE targeted compiled environments, perhaps using JIT technologies. It was not at all specific to Java, and was fully documented; much broader adoption was anticipated than Jazelle was able to achieve.\n\nThumbEE was a variant of the Thumb2 16/32-bit instruction set. It integrated null pointer checking; defined some new fault mechanisms; and repurposed the 16-bit LDM and STM opcode space to support a few instructions such as range checking, a new handler invocation scheme, and more. Accordingly, compilers that produced Thumb or Thumb2 code could be modified to work with ThumbEE-based runtime environments.\n"}

The art of \"sanjo\" is a real crystallization of traditional Korean melody and rhythm which may have been handed down by rote generation after generation. \nThe drummer who beats the \"janggu\" also makes \"chuimsae\" (exclamations) in order to please the audience.\nThe audience can also express their excited feeling with \"chuimsae\" while listening to \"sanjo\". A big \"chuimsae\" indicates a good performance, so the musician can make a better performance. Like \"pansori\", \"chuimsae\" plays an important role in \"sanjo\". Without \"chuimsae\", the music is meaningless. \"Chuimsae\" connects musician and audience during a \"sanjo\" performance. Almost every Korean traditional musical instrument is used in \"sanjo\": gayageum, geomungo, daegeum, haegeum, piri, taepyeongso, ajaeng, danso.\n\n\"Sanjo\" was said to be developed around 1890 by Kim Chang-jo (1865–1920) for the \"gayageum\". Thereafter, it was expanded to other traditional Korean instruments, including the \"geomungo\" and Korean flutes. Its early development was informed by other genres of traditional music, including \"pansori\", \"sinawi\", and the performances of Korean shamanism.\n\n\"Daegeum sanjo\", played on the \"daegeum\" (a traditional Korean transverse flute) was developed in the 1920s. It has since become one of the most popular forms of \"sanjo\". Its leading practitioner today is Yi Saenggang.\n\nSanjo is traditionally identified as a form of \"minsogak\", or folk music.\n\nThe composition of \"sanjo\" varies depending on the people, instruments and time. However, usually \"sanjo\" starts with a slow \"jinyangjo\" rhythm (hangul: 진양조장단; very slow rhythm used in \"pansori\" or \"sanjo\") and becomes faster, ending with a very fast rhythm like a \"danmori\" rhythm and creating enthusiasm in the audience. Starting from a slow rhythm, the audience can gradually sink into the melody of the song. \"Sanjo\" expresses various aspects of the player. \"Sanjo\"s are not fixed music. The musician can make new music with original variations. \"Sanjo\" has endless melodies in which musicians make new compositions that change with the times.\n\n\n\n"}

It is also a part of the Biosphere Reserve of Südost-Rügen.\nThe name translates as \"the monks' estates\". In 1252, Jaromar II, Prince of Rügen sold the area to the Cistercian monks of Eldena Abbey, which was founded by one of his predecessors, Jaromar I, Prince of Rügen in 1199 and by that time also belonged to the Danish Principality of Rügen. To separate the monks' possessions from the rest of the island, a ditch was dug between Baabe and Sellin, known as \"Mönchsgraben\" (\"monks' ditch\"). Today, a large wooden gate built upon the bridge over the \"Mönchsgraben\" marks the entrance to the \"Mönchgut\" peninsula.\n\nThe peninsula is composed of several headlands such as \"Reddevitzer Höft\", the \"Kleiner Zicker\" and the \"Großer Zicker\". The bay between the headlands is called Having. Off-shore to the east of the peninsula lies the island Greifswalder Oie.\n\nWhile the residents of the area earlier supported themselves through fishing and marine activities, today the area is primarily geared toward tourism. One main attraction is the local history museum in Göhren, an open-air museum located on historical settlements. Here there is also a display of the elaborate local costumes, which Mönchgut is well known for.\n\nIn 1806, Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden started to construct the town of Gustavia on the peninsula, but had to abandon the project when France occupied Mönchgut during the Napoleonic Wars.\n\nMönchgut also features the final station of the narrow-gauge railway the Rasender Roland.\n"}

His uncle, Kélé Monson Diabaté, was considered a master griot, and Massa Makan Diabaté once said that he owed much to his uncle's teaching: \"I am what Kèlè Monson wanted me to be when he initiated me into the Malinké oral tradition. And I’ll say that I betrayed him by writing novels. I’m the child of Kélé Monson, but a traitorous child.\" Diabaté began training as a griot at the age of seven, though his training would later be interrupted to allow him to study in Guinea. He eventually moved to Paris, where he studied history, sociology, and political science before working for a number of international organisations such as UNICEF or UNESCO.\n\nReturning to Mali, Diabaté settled into an administrative post in Bamako. His early works \"Janjon et autres chants populaires du Mali\" (\"Janjon and other popular songs of Mali\", 1970), \"Kala Jata\" (1970), and \"L'aigle et l'épervier ou la geste du Soundjata\" (\"The Eagle and the Sparrowhawk or the Gesture of Soundjata\", 1975), were French-language versions of Malinké epics and folktales. In 1971, \"Janjon\" was awarded the Grand prix littéraire d'Afrique noire, bringing Diabaté his first international recognition. His trilogy of novels \"Le lieutenant\", \"Le coiffeur\", and \"Le boucher de Kouta\" (\"The Lieutenant\", \"The Barber\", and \"The Butcher of Kouta\", 1979–1982) won the 1987 Grand prix international de la Fondation Léopold Sédar Senghor.\n\nMassa Makan Diabaté died in Bamako on January 27, 1988. The Malian government has named two high schools after him, one in Bamako and the other in his home region of Kayes.\n\nAlthough a griot himself, Diabaté came to see his contemporaries as parasites and beggars who often perverted history and abused their roles in pursuit of wealth: “After Mali’s independence, griots became, in my opinion, what I would a call a parasite.” The state of griots was a key theme in his work. In \"L'assemblée des djinns,\" he elucidates his concerns through one of his characters:\n“The griots died before the arrival of the Whites, when our kings, instead of uniting against a common danger, tore each other to shreds. Today’s griots are nothing more than public entertainers who sing the praises of just about anybody… Chief of the Griots!...But griots no longer exist.”\nHowever, Diabaté also believed that the image of the griot was reparable, and he saw literature as a catalyst to achieving that end. While he perhaps derived his initial legitimacy due to his belonging to the Malinké oral tradition, he sought to return the role of the griot to its former glory by betraying that tradition in favour of the written word.\n\nDiabaté’s biographer, Cheick M. Chérif Keïta, views Diabaté’s life, and many of his works, as the result of a dialectic between two opposing forces, \"Fasiya\" and \"Fadenya\":\n\"Fasiya\" represents the artist's attachment to the forms and practices that existed in society before his birth… \"Fasiya\" is a centripetal force in that it drives the artist to create within a tradition in accordance with the canons embodied by his father and paternal lineage. The second force is \"Fadenya\", the instinct to compete with and rebel against those models of past times, embodied by the father and paternal lineage… it is this desire to distinguish oneself from one's ancestors that promotes the creation of new forms of expression and the individual discovery of new aesthetics.\nDiabaté took on the role of griot as this was assigned to him by his lineage. In his younger years, as is often the case, \"Fasiya\" was dominant. But given Diabaté’s evaluation of contemporaneous griots, it is no surprise that he sought distinction by abandoning the oral tradition, and temporarily his homeland. \"Fadenya\" is, however, ultimately positive, as competition is a creative force. When he returned to Mali, drawn back by his commitment to the community and country that raised him, his \"Fasiya\", that which he created was incorporated into the tradition. By introducing the written word to the keepers of the oral tradition, Diabaté effectively changed the canons.\n\nThis dialectic of \"Fasiya\" and \"Fadenya\" is a defining characteristic of the Malian hero, the paradigm of which being the \"Epic of Sundiata Keita\", and Diabaté features it prominently in his own novels. For example, in \"Le boucher de Kouta\", the protagonist, a butcher, sells donkey meat to his clients without telling them despite the fact that it is against Muslim norms to eat donkey meat. The butcher is, in this sense, abandoning his traditional role and responsibilities. However, the residents of Kouta benefit greatly from the availability of affordable meat. Diabaté demonstrates that sometimes norms must be broken, and tradition must be betrayed, in order to effect positive change.\n\n\n\nOther references:\n\nNotes:\n"}

{"id": "2123403", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2123403", "title": "Petrus Christus", "text": "Petrus Christus\n\nPetrus Christus ( 1410/1420 – 1475/1476) was an Early Netherlandish painter active in Bruges from 1444, where, along with Hans Memling, he became the leading painter after the death of Jan van Eyck. He was influenced by van Eyck and Rogier van der Weyden and is noted for his innovations with linear perspective and a meticulous technique which seems derived from miniatures and manuscript illumination. Today, some 30 works are confidently attributed to him. The best-known include the 1446 \"Portrait of a Carthusian\" and c. 1470 Berlin \"Portrait of a Young Girl\", both are highly innovative in presentation of the figure against detailed, rather than flat, backgrounds.\n\nChristus was an anonymous figure for centuries, his importance not established until the work of modern art historians. Giorgio Vasari barely mentions him in his biographies of painters, written in the Renaissance, and near contemporary records merely list him amongst many others. In the early to mid-nineteenth century, Gustav Waagen (who identified him in Francophile language as \"Pierre Christophsen\") and Johann David Passavant were important in establishing Christus's biographical details and in attributing works to him.\n\nChristus was born in Baarle, near Antwerp and Breda. Long considered a student of and successor to Jan van Eyck, his paintings have sometimes been confused with those of van Eyck. At the death of van Eyck in 1441, it is thought that Christus took over his master's workshop. Christus purchased his Bruges citizenship in 1444, exactly three years after van Eyck's death, taking advantage of a decree set down by Philip the Good allowing in men indebted to him after the Bruges Revolt of 1436–38. Had he been an active pupil in van Eyck's Bruges workshop in 1441, he would have received his citizenship automatically after the customary period of one year and one day. Christus may have been van Eyck's successor in the Bruges school, but perhaps not his pupil. Recent research reveals that Christus, long seen only in his predecessor's light, was an independent painter whose work shows just as much influence from, among others, Dirk Bouts, Robert Campin and Rogier van der Weyden.\n\nIt is unknown whether Christus visited Italy, and brought style and technical accomplishments of the Northern European painters directly to Antonello da Messina and other Italian artists, but it is known that his paintings were purchased by Italians. A document testifying to the presence of a \"Piero da Bruggia\" (Petrus from Bruges?) in Milan may suggest that he visited that city at the same time as Antonello, and the two artists may even have met. This might account for the remarkable similarities between the \"Portrait of a Man\" attributed to Christus in the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and many of Antonello's portraits, including the supposed self-portrait in the National Gallery in London. It would also explain how Italian painters learned about oil painting and how Northern painters learned about linear perspective. Antonello, along with Giovanni Bellini, was one of the first Italian painters to use oil paint like his Netherlandish contemporaries. And Christus' \"Virgin and Child Enthroned with Saints Francis and Jerome\" in Frankfurt, seemingly dated 1457 (the third digit is illegible), is the first known Northern picture to demonstrate accurate linear perspective. \n\nThe composition of a \"Lamentation\", now at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, seems so closely inspired a marble relief by Antonello Gagini in the cathedral at Palermo that it has been suggested that the picture may have been painted for an Italian client.\n\nA late work, the reserved \"Portrait of a Young Girl\" belongs among the masterworks of Early Netherlandish painting, marking a new development in Netherlandish portraiture. It no longer shows the sitter in front of a neutral background, but in a concrete space defined by the background wall panels. Christus had already perfected this format in his two portraits of 1446. The unknown woman, whose exquisite clothing suggests that she might come from France, radiates an aura of discretion and of nobility, while appearing slightly unreal in the elegant stylization of her form.\n\nChristus died in Bruges in 1475 or 1476. Hans Memling succeeded him as the next great painter in Bruges.\n\nChristus produced at least six signed and dated works, which form the basis for any other attributions to him. These are: the \"Portrait of Edward Grymeston\" (on loan to the National Gallery, London, 1446), the Portrait of a Carthusian (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, 1446), the so-called \"St. Eligius in His Shop\" (Metropolitan Museum of Art Robert Lehman Collection, New York, 1449), the \"Virgin Nursing the Child\" (now in the Koninklijk Museum voor Schone Kunsten, Antwerp, 1449), the so-called \"\"Berlin Altar Wings\"\" with the Annunciation, Nativity, and Last Judgment (Gemäldegalerie, Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, 1452), and the \"Virgin and Child Enthroned with Saints Jerome and Francis\" (Stadelsches Kunstinstitut, Frankfurt-am-Main, 1457?—the digits are not clear). In addition, a pair of panels in the Groeningemuseum in Bruges (showing the Annunciation and Nativity) bears a date of 1452, but its authenticity is suspect.\n\n\n"}

Individual volumes of \"Kaze Hikaru\" have been ranked in listings of best-selling manga of the week in Japan; the entire series has sold over six million copies in Japan after the release of the 35th volume in March 2014.\n\nWriting for Manga Life, Ryan Lewis described \"Kaze Hikaru\" as \"a unique title\", praising its engaging story, plot, and characters. Comics Village's Lori Henderson described the manga as \"an enjoyable read\", and said it is interesting because it shows the history and culture during the Shogunate. It was elected one of the \"Most Underrated\" manga along with \"\" and \"Saturn Apartments\"; Eva Volin stated that despite the necessity for the reader to know something about that period of Japanese history, the reader will \"fall in love\" with the characters \"as they deal with the fall of the samurai way and the rise of modern warfare\". Pop Culture Shock's reviewer Katherine Dacey described \"Kaze Hikaru\" as \"an action-filled drama in the vein of \"The Rose of Versailles\" or \"They Were Eleven\"\", and she praised the political nature of the series because Watanabe discusses the gender constraints in Japan. Reviewing the ninth volume, Isaac Hale, also from Pop Culture Shock, commended the series for keeping the same humor that it had at the beginning. Hale said the art was a \"high point\" of the manga; he described the character designs as \"attractive and unique\" but he criticized the main character's gender indecision. Matthew Alexander from Mania.com appreciated the story's historical setting and the theme of \"a woman in a man's world.\" \n\nAccording to Anime News Network's Rebecca Silverman, one of the strengths of \"Kaze Hikaru\" is \"the meticulous research and fidelity to history that Taeko Watanabe maintains\". Silverman praised the manga for being \"[r]ich with detail but never overwhelming and full of likeable (and hateable) characters\", and said that \"this is \"shoujo\" that goes just a bit beyond the norm to bring us a story that we can really sink our teeth into\". Holly Ellingwood from Active Anime compared the manga to \"Rurouni Kenshin\" and \"Peacemaker Kurogane\", and lauded the series for showing the reader the reality of that historical period. Leroy Douresseaux from Comic Book Bin described it as \"James Clavell meets Colleen McCullough\", and praised Watanabe's artwork, which he said creates \"expressive characters and Oscar-worthy costume design\". Douresseaux also said the faces of Watanabe's characters \"are so captivating that they have a hypnotic effect on the reader\", and that it is impossible to not love them.\n\nSheena McNeil of Sequential Tart called \"Kaze Hikaru\" a \"fantastic read for any genre\", praising its strong female lead, romance, art and comedy. Later, it compared \"Kaze Hikaru\" with a novel, and praised the fact that each character has an important role in the series. In a review of Volume 12, Patti Martinson criticized the series for being \"soap opera-ish\", but said she was still enjoying the characters and the plot. Two volumes later, Holly von Winckel criticized the manga's male characters for looking like women and for its unevenly distributed dialogue balloons. Marissa Sammy said the 15th volume was \"far richer in plot and appeal\" than earlier volumes. Wolfen Moondaughter said that when reading the 18th volume she felt she was reading three \"tankōbon\", and that there was \"a lot packed into this manga\".\n\n"}

He was influenced by Carl Freiherr von Rokitansky, one of the founders of modern pathological anatomy.\n\nWhile still a young man, Hebra wrote one of the most influential books on dermatology of all times, the \"Atlas der Hautkrankeiten\" (\"Atlas of skin diseases\"), with phenomenal illustrations by two of the leading medical illustrators of Austria, Anton Elfinger (1821–1864) and Carl Heitzmann (1836–1896).\n\nIn 1844 Ferdinand von Hebra discovered the cause of scabies.\n\nIn the second half of the 19th century, Hebra introduced resurfacing and restoring skin with chemical peel. He used exfoliative agents, like phenol, croton oil, nitric acid in various cautious combination for treating freckles and skin irregularities.\n\nAn early supporter of Ignaz Semmelweis and the editor of a leading Austrian medical journal, Hebra announced Semmelweis's discovery that handwashing with chloride of lime reduces the incidence of puerperal fever in the December 1847 and April 1848 issues of the Viennese medical journal. Hebra claimed that Semmelweis's work had a practical significance comparable to that of Edward Jenner's introduction of cowpox inoculations to prevent smallpox.\n\nDue to Semmelweis's suffering from severe depression and other mental problems, János Balassa signed a document which committed him to a mental institution, and on 30 July 1865 Hebra, under the pretense of taking him to visit one of Hebra's \"new Institutes\", lured Semmelweis into a Viennese asylum for the insane located in the Lazarettgasse (\"Landes-Irren-Anstalt in der Lazarettgasse\"). On arrival there, Semmelweis guessed what was happening and tried to leave, but he was forcibly subdued by the asylum's guards and died two weeks later from a gangrenous wound which may have been caused by the struggle.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2123449", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2123449", "title": "Justice Department (animal rights)", "text": "Justice Department (animal rights)\n\nThe Justice Department (JD) was founded in the United Kingdom by animal rights activists who declared they were willing to use a diversity of tactics up to and including violence against their opponents. Initially calling for \"\"abusers to have but a taste of the fear and anguish their victims suffer on a daily basis\"\", activists established a separate idea from adhering to the Animal Liberation Front's (ALF) guidelines of non-violent resistance, similar to that of the Animal Rights Militia (ARM).\n\nThe first recorded action took place during Christmas 1993, when pipe bombs in poster tubes were sent to Shamrock Farm, a supplier of primates for animal experimentation. The group had formed the same leaderless-resistance model as the ALF, which consists of small, autonomous, covert cells acting independently. Members of the Justice Department are thought to be both supporters of the far-right and the far-left who engage in a common interest, which is animal rights.\n\nThe name has also been used in the United States with activists claiming hundreds of attacks in the UK against animal testing companies, their suppliers, animal researchers, hunters (including the Royal Family), and even the British National Party HQ. By sending explosive devices and razor blades in the post, and leaving incendiary devices on shelves, \"The Independent\" labeled the political violence \"\"the most sustained and sophisticated bombing campaign in mainland Britain since the IRA was at its height.\"\" with the FBI declaring them to be \"\"the most dangerous animal activists in operation\".\n\nThe group formed the same leaderless-resistance model as the ALF, consisting of small, autonomous, covert cells acting independently. A cell may consist of just one person. The name is used as a tag to claim responsibility for supporters of the Justice Department concept, rather than to denote an actually existing organization. The animal liberation movement in the 1990s believed there to be less than 30 individuals as part of the Department, operating in separate cells of five or fewer people; living normal lives, normal jobs and an uncommon stereotype of a squatter.\n\nIn \"The Independent\" newspaper it was claimed that the Justice Department is regarded as the \"terrorist wing\" of the Animal Liberation Front (ALF). Some ALF activists reject the association, telling the newspaper: \"\"You cannot be in favour of animal rights and at the same time attack people because at the end of the day people are animals, too.\"\"\n\nBy 1995, security forces grew concerned over not just the scale of the campaign, but also the sophistication of activists. The technology used in the bomb making was compared to that of the IRA, with hoax bombs designed to frighten the public rather than harm, although sometimes capable of maiming or killing. At the time Deputy Assistant Commissioner John Howley, overall head of both the Special Branch and the anti-terrorist branch, claimed it was not terrorism because there was no clear motive to overthrow the government.\n\nThe existence of activists calling themselves the Justice Department or Animal Rights Militia (ARM), another name used by violent activists, reflects a struggle within the radical animal rights movement in general, between those who believe violence is justified, and those who insist the movement should reject it in favour of nonviolent resistance. Furthermore criticism from the mainstream animal rights movement includes comparing animal rights and the struggles to abolish slavery and emancipate women, which the League Against Cruel Sports thinks is \"\"stupid and naive\"\".\n\nWhile the ALF is a non-violent group, Robin Webb has noted that some people may simultaneously be involved in actions staged by the Justice Department, the ALF and the ARM, since:\n\nSteven Best has coined the term \"extensional self-defense\" to describe actions carried out in defense of animals by human beings acting as \"proxy agents.\" He argues that, in carrying out acts of extensional self-defense, activists have the moral right to engage in acts of sabotage or even violence. Extensional self-defense is justified, he writes, because animals are \"so vulnerable and oppressed they cannot fight back to attack or kill their oppressors.\" Best argues that the principle of extensional self-defense mirrors the penal code statues known as the \"necessity defense,\" which can be invoked when a defendant believes that the illegal act was necessary to avoid imminent and great harm. In testimony to the Senate in 2005, Jerry Vlasak stated that he regarded violence against Huntingdon Life Sciences as an example of extensional self-defense.\n\nThe first recorded Justice Department action took place during Christmas 1993, when two foot-long poster tubes with explosive devices were sent to Shamrock Farm, a supplier of primates for animal research; the action carried claims of HIV-infected needles. Eleven more devices were intercepted by Special Branch at sorting offices with one that was not recovered. It targeted the manager of GlaxoSmithKline in Hereford, who was also a member of the RSPCA's animal experimentation advisory board and Institute of Animal Technicians council. He opened the package which exploded in his face. Days later the group targeted Boots in Cornwall, publicly stating that they had replaced products on their shelves with devices. Boots issued an alert to their eleven hundred stores after one customer bought one of the products and contacted the police who deactivated the device.\n\nActivists working as the Justice Department have sent out letter bombs and envelopes rigged with poisoned razor blades. In 1994, a rat trap equipped with razor blades was sent to Prince Charles after he took his sons on their first foxhunt. Tom King, a former Defence Secretary, was sent an incendiary device, which failed to explode, after he defended foxhunting during a debate in parliament. Michael Howard, at the time Home Secretary, also received one.\n\nShortly after, the group set fire to two boats belonging to the owner of Garetmar kennels (formally known as Cottagepatch) in Hampshire and sent two videos disguised incendiary devices to the Boots store in Cambridge, which was intercepted, and another to the British National Party (BNP) HQ in South London; injuring Alfred Waite. Another round of devices by the now quite violent group were claimed to be \"increasingly sophisticated and random\" yet again injured staff, this time of ferry company Stena Sealink, which were attacked in Gloucestershire, Oxford, Edinburgh and Kent, in connection with the live exports trade. This resulted in ferry companies involved in live exports pulling out because of fear for their staff and their safety. Bloodsports enthusiast and hunt master Nick Fawcett was also one of the main targets of the Justice Department receiving several JD packages, with police blowing two up outside his home.\n\nThe Justice Department in April were then accused of sending four letter bombs from London to senior politicians William Waldegrave (the then Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food) and again to Tom King (a former Defence Secretary), a fur warehouse in Glasgow and an animal testing company in Edinburgh. Mr Waldegrave was targeted at his family farm in Chewton Mendip, Somerset, but the device was spotted by a postman and dismantled by a bomb disposal team. This was due to his apparent lack of action on banning the live exports trade and veal crates, with booby-trapped razor blades sent to his home in January, threatening letters and protests from animal rights activists. The campaign was condemned by Compassion in World Farming, while Mr Waldegrave dismissing the actions as \"stupidity\". The other bombs were intercepted at Westminster, a postroom and at the fur company in a controlled explosion.\n\nIn January, the group claimed responsibility for sending envelopes with blades soaked in rat poison to 80 researchers, hunting guides, and others in the United States, and in British Columbia and Alberta, Canada. David Barbarash, a Vancouver-based activist who became North American spokesman for the Animal Liberation Front, was charged in connection with the attacks, but the case against him was dropped. Threats pursued in March, after the Department claimed sending out another 87 booby-trapped envelopes. the letter said: \"\"It is unfortunate such drastic actions must be taken but in war, people die,\" \"And we haven't even started yet.\"\".\n\nIn August after a few years of inactivity, a US-based group sent razor blades and a picture of a bomb from New York City to Knox County Mink Farm, Ohio. Previously targeted by the ALF in 1996 when they released 8,000 from the premises, they warned the farm that they had a year to \"\"get out of the bloody fur trade\"\" and release all their mink, signed by the \"Justice Department Anti-Fur Task Force\".\n\nBy October the group had prepared 83 envelopes containing razor blades and a strongly worded warning, sent from Las Vegas, urging primate researchers in Oregon to end their work by Autumn 2000. They were warned; \"\"If you do not heed our warning, your violence will be turned back on you.\"\" by the activists. No injuries were reported from the attacks, but the FBI swiftly classified them as the most dangerous animal activists in operation. The packages were received by researchers from UCSF, Stanford University, University of Washington, Tulane University and elsewhere. A special agent labelled the activity animal enterprise terrorism.\n\nA new round of threats was investigated by the FBI in November after \"The Justice Department of UCLA\" claimed they sent HIV-infected razors to UCLA neuroscientist, animal researcher and Speaking of Research member David Jentsch. He received razor blades and a threatening note law enforcement claim. The North American Animal Liberation Press Office posted an anonymous communiqué from the group, who claimed they carried out the action because Jentsch uses primates for government-funded testing of drug addiction.\n\nSince 2006, activists have claimed numerous acts of sabotage, vandalism, criminal damage and firebombing against UCLA faculty or property, on and off campus, including the Animal Liberation Brigade setting fire to his car in March 2009. According to the university, Jentsch studies methamphetamine addiction, tobacco dependence in teenagers, and the cognitive disabilities affecting schizophrenia patients, with much of his work funded by the National Institutes of Health.\n\nRelating to the video disguised devices that were sent to Stena Sealink, a Coventry man, Guerjeet Aujla, was arrested by the Anti Terrorist Squad and was classified as a Category A prisoner and Justice Department bomber after clues were found in his bedroom linking him to the devices. In the case, the judge believed that he was not responsible for the other attacks, only those to the ferry company, and that his guilty plea showed genuine remorse. He was sentenced to six years imprisonment, the lowest possible sentence the judge was able to pass concerning the attacks that caused harm to individuals.\n\n\n"}

It is commonly white to grey or black in color, with a specific gravity that ranges from 2.2 to 2.5. It is used in the production of sharpening stones. It occurs in parts of Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Texas, as well as in Japan and parts of the Middle East. The name \"novaculite\" is derived from the Latin word \"novacula\", meaning a sharp knife, dagger, or razor in reference to its use in sharpening.\n\nNovaculite beds are present in the Ouachita Mountains of Arkansas and Oklahoma, and in the Marathon Uplift and Solitario regions of Texas. Novaculite is very resistant to erosion and the beds stand out as ridges in the Ouachita Mountains. There are also occurrences in Japan, Syria, Lebanon, and Israel.\n\nThe novaculite beds of the south-central United States were deposited in the Ouachita Geosyncline, a deep-water marine trough, during Silurian to early Mississippian time. Sedimentation consisted primarily of siliceous skeletal particles of marine organisms such as sponge spicules and radiolaria, and very fine-grained, wind-blown quartz particles; there was very little argillaceous sedimentation during novaculite deposition. The novaculite beds were later subjected to folding and uplift, and probably low-grade metamorphism, during the Ouachita orogeny in early Pennsylvanian time.\n\nBecause novaculite is very hard and dense, it has been mined since prehistoric times, first for use as arrow and spear points, and later to make sharpening stones. Novaculite-rich sharpening stones from Arkansas are called \"Arkansas stones\"; stones produced in the Ottoman empire (Syria, Lebanon, and Israel) were called \"Turkey stones\"; and novaculite stones were also produced in Japan.\n\nThe weathered upper strata of Arkansas novaculite, known as tripoli or \"rotten stone\", are rich in silica and have found a niche market as a performance additive or filler in the coatings, adhesives, sealants, and elastomer industries. Tripoli is mined just east of Hot Springs, Arkansas by the Malvern Minerals Company.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2123470", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2123470", "title": "Calbayog", "text": "Calbayog\n\n', officially the ', (Waray: \"Siyudad san Calbayog\"; ; ) and often referred to as Calbayog City, is a in the province of , . According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nIt lies along the coastal region of the province stretching about from the northern tip of the island and from southern boundaries.\n\nIt is the sixth largest city in terms of land and water areas in the Philippines. The first crowned city of Region 8 (\"Eastern Visayas\") and the nineteenth city of the Philippines. In 2010, Calbayog has 35,126 households with a population of 172,778 people, making up 23.6% of the total population of the province of Samar. Calbayog is one of the commercial trade centers in Eastern Visayas. Calbayog is subdivided into three major districts: Calbayog, Tinambacan and Oquendo.\n\nCalbayog's early history has been associated with the introduction and spread of Catholicism in the country. Calbayog started as one of the small settlements in the Island of Samar, an area assigned to the Jesuit missionaries. Jesuit chroniclers, as early as the 17th century, notably Fr. Ignacio Alcina, wrote many accounts about it and its people. Jesuit records and reports referred to the settlement initially as Ibatan and Jibatang (Hibatang). In the annual report of 1739 the name Calbayog appeared for the first time. Fr. de Huerta, a 19th-century Franciscan writer, noted in his work \"Estado Geografico\" that in earlier times, Calbayog was called Tiayban for having been founded near a river of the same name. Then it was transferred due to a flood to the shore of the Hibatang River, whose name it took. Then again the settlers transferred to the place that they permanently occupied and took the name Calbayog.\n\nHibatang had already been a small settlement at the beginning of the 17th century. It slowly occupied a prominent place among the several small settlements. It became a \"visita\" (a large barrio with a chapel, similar to a chapelry in Britain) of Capul under the jurisdiction of the Parish priest of that town. The church of Calbayog were built from a scree formation near Malajog, shortest distance is now the Malabungto bridge. After the expulsion of the Jesuit missionaries from the Philippines in the 18th century, the administration of the parishes in Samar was handed over to the Franciscan friars.\n\nCalbayog as a town and parish during the Spanish period was composed of several villages, the most populated of which are called visitas. Calbayog grew from visita size and became a pueblo (town). It was created a separate parish in 1785. Separated from the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the parish priest of Capul, it was later given its own minister, becoming a religious center. Its parish priests cared for the spiritual needs of the people living in what are now Calbayog City, the municipalities of Santa Margarita, Santo Niño and Almagro. By the late 19th century a number of visitas became the poblaciones when new towns were created from Calbayog. They were Caybago (later called Oquendo), Santa Margarita, Weyler (later called Tinambacan) and Santo Niño.\n\nIn 1878, Calbayog was hit by a cholera epidemic, killing almost one half of the total population. Fr. Sebastian Cordova was forced to leave to save himself from the disease, bringing Biktoy with him as his sacristan. In Manila, Biktoy was a working student, serving the convent without sacrificing his studies. One year after his graduation, Fr. Cordova recommended Biktoy work for the Spanish Army. He was trained and accepted as a corporal. After a year, he was promoted and commissioned to become the second lieutenant in the infantry battalion of the Spanish Army. His first deployment and jurisdiction as an officer was in the whole Visayan Region.\nAfter the exile of Rizal in Dapitan, the Katipunan was born in Binondo, Manila. Andres Bonifacio and his men moved heaven and earth to fight against the Spanish government then led by Gob. Heneral Polavieja. The katipunan expanded its membership from Luzon down to the Visayas Region, thereby increasing the number of Katipuneros in a span of one year. Sensing the secret plan of the Katipunan to overthrow the government, the Spanish authorities raided a Binondo printing press where subversive documents were found and confiscated. One of the documents seized was the list of members of the Katipunan. The name Benedicto Nijaga was one in the list, being the collector of revolutionary funds in the area. Upon learning of the arrests, Governor Polavieja ordered the arrest of all suspected members of the Katipunan. Nijaga was arrested together with twelve other katipuneros while campaigning for revolutionary funds. Shortly after they were jailed and reportedly tortured, a trial ensued, reminiscent of that of Rizal and other Filipino nationalists. The 13 men were convicted and sentenced to death. On January 11, 1897, the thirteen were taken to Bagumbayan field under heavy guard. Just before sunrise, the men were executed. \n\nColegio-Seminario de San Vicente de Paul (now Christ the King College and St. Vincent de Paul Seminary) was established in 1905 and La Milagrosa Academy was established in 1910.\n\nOn April 10, 1910, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Calbayog was created by virtue of the Papal Bull of Pope Pius X, comprising the islands of Samar and Leyte. Calbayog became the episcopal see of the diocese.\n\nIn 1942, the Japanese Army occupied Calbayog city. In 1945 the city was finally liberated by the Philippine Commonwealth troops and the guerrillas who had continued the fight against the Japanese throughout World War II. It was only much later that other dioceses in the region were created.\nRepublic Act No. 328, otherwise known as the City charter of Calbayog was signed into law on July 15, 1948 by then President Elpidio Quirino. The first set of city officials, incumbent municipal officials of the place, were sworn in on October 16, 1948. The city comprises the territorial jurisdiction of the former Municipalities of Calbayog, Oquendo and Tinambacan.\n\nIn January 2008 Roberto Navidad, a Regional Trial Court (RTC) judge was shot dead in Calbayog City outside a drugstore at the corner of Gomez Street and Nijaga Boulevard. As of 2008, the crime was unsolved. He was the 15th judge to be ambushed in the Philippines since July 20, 1999 (the 14th under the Arroyo government).\n\nThe city has a total land area of as of 2007 which is 0.29% of the Philippines total land area, 3.79% of the regional land area, 6.12% of the island of Samar and 14.56% of the Samar province area.\n\nForty percent of the city's land area are plain and hilly terrains with elevation ranging from above sea level. The rest are rugged mountain ranges with elevations from above sea level. Flooding is minimized because of many rivers, brooks, streams and natural water conveyors that flow towards the sea.\n\nCalbayog experiences a variety of wind types: Amihan (northeastwind), Timog (southwind), Habagat (southwestwind), Canaway (northwest wind), Cabunghan (east wind), Dumagsa (southeast wind) and Salatan (west wind).\n\nCalbayog has well distributed rainfall throughout the year, except during the summer months of February through May, when most parts of the city are dry. The highest rainfall intensity recorded is per hour. Heavy downpour is seldom experienced in the locality, therefore making Calbayog potentially appropriate for protective agricultural investment.\n\nThe city's 157 barangays are grouped in three districts.\n\nThe district is located in the southern and eastern boundaries of the city and is the main political and commercial district of the city. The district is bounded to the north by the Oquendo and Tinambacan districts, to the south by the municipality of Santa Margarita and to the east by Matuguinao. The district comprises 84 barangays and has a population of 103,051 (2015 census) with a land area of about .\n\nThe Tinambacan district is located along the northern boundaries of the city, it is bounded to the north by the municipality of San Isidro, to the south by the Calbayog district and to the east by the Oquendo district. The district comprises 27 barangays and has a population of 46,157 (2015 census) with a land area of .\n\nThe Oquendo District is located along the northeastern boundaries of the city, it is bounded to the north by Lope De Vega, to the south by the Calbayog district, to the east by Silvino Lobos and to the west by the Tinambacan district. The district comprises 46 barangays and has a population of 34,643 (2015 census) with a land area of .\n\nAccording to the 2015 census, Calbayog has a population of 183,851 making up 23.6% of the entire population of Samar Province as of August 1, 2015.\n\nAbout 80% of the population speaks the Waray-Waray language, 15% Cebuano, 2% Tagalog, 1% Masbatenyo and 2% other languages. English and Tagalog are widely used in the business and educational sectors.\n\nCalbayognons are predominantly Roman Catholic, and the city has been the see of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Calbayog since 1910, when it was split from the diocese of Cebu (now an archdiocese).\n\nSmall minority groups of other Christians are also present in the city, and it has a notable Muslim presence.\n\nCalbayog serves as the commercial, industrial and fishing center of the province of Western Samar, it is currently one of the tigers among the urban centers of Region 8. Its income totaled approximately PHP 77 Million in 2014, making it the third \nhighest-income city in Region 8. Calbayog City is the principal outport (abaca and copra are shipped here) for the province's northern plains. It also serves as a main Coco Oil producer, as international vessels regularly dock at a port owned by Samar Coco at Barangay Malajog.\n\nThere are fourteen banks operating in the city, including RCBC, PNB, Greenbank, Eastwest Rural Bank, UCPB, CitySavings Bank, Rural Bank of Calbayog City, Landbank, OK Bank, MetroBank and Asia United Bank.\n\nThe land area of the city is generally divided into agriculture and forestry areas. Agricultural lands are subdivided into production, built-up area, protection land, mangrove, severe erosion area, and watershed forest reserve; while forest lands are further subdivided into open canopy, logged-over areas, built-up and protection areas.\n\nLargely an agricultural city, 57,654.07 hectares (or 63.85%) is used for agriculture while 32,645.93 hectares (or 36.15%) are forest lands. Its major products are copra, abaca, rice, vegetables, corn, rootcrops, fruits, bamboo and nipa, with the overall total quantity (mt.) of 28,330.428.\n\nCalbayog is an exporter of fish and other marine products. Fisheries contribute to the economic revenues of the city. Major species abound such as mackerels, sardines, squids, prawns, crabs, shells, oysters and others.\nFish processing such as smoking, salting and drying are small scale industries operating in the locality. Fresh catch are exported in huge volume on a daily basis throughout the country. Samar Sea, with a fishing ground of , is a vast resource for agriculture and maritime fish farming activities. \n\nAquatic resources like waterfalls or a water rapids are develop in here too, this image is one of the many sources of Potable Drinking Water here in the City, this Dam is used for NAWASA and is currently being develop for a higher electric production by its water turbine electric generator. The more community use water for sanitation, hygienic purposes, watering plants, irrigation the higher is the electrical capacity.\n\nThe forest land of Calbayog has an area of 6,327.91 hectares. Happy Valley and Seven Hills are remote areas with barangays producing forest products like rattan, nito, cogon, bamboo and others. These are adequate supply of raw materials for export oriented products.\n\nLocal sources revealed that forest land have dramatically dwindled. The remotest forest areas have been depleted with the traditional slash-and-burn farming, poachers and illegal loggers invading the resource thereby endangering valuable species and wildlife. Some are even entirely wiped out. Intensified programs by concerned agencies are now in motion to save forest resources, including reforestation and tree planting.\n\nProduction of livestock and poultry products is another industry that enjoys the major concern of the city through the Tri-District program, a centerpiece program of the present government. Breeding centers were opened to develop superior genetic stocks and upgrading of carabao and dispersal program were established to accelerate livestock production. Dressed chickens are now exported throughout the region especially in Masbate, with an average of 2,000 heads daily. The investment of Swift Foods Inc., which has been operating in the city for almost five years, and the operation of Solmar Dressing Plant supply poultry products which is now expanding its market in Central Visayas and Luzon. \n\nThe waray-waray rice heavy machineries milling and packing processing center.\n\nNature has made Calbayog replete with mineral deposits. Unprocessed or natural marble is found in coastal barangays. Manganese, which is chiefly used in the form of ferromanganese in steel making, is similarly available in the area. It was however purposely left untouched to supposedly preserve the natural balance of the area. Sand and gravel are also supplied to meet local construction needs, though barely enough as some areas are banned from extraction in order to protect existing structures.\n\nConstructed in 2013, the Calbayog Land Transport Terminal and Calbayog Public Market is situated within the perimeter. Newly constructed industries and institutions are located here. This is for the preparation of becoming a Regional Center of the Island of Samar.

By its pre-colonial denotation, it means to praise, extol or eulogize spirits of gods. The word does not only ascribe to the ritual or \"hadang\" as an activity to gratify the gods, but likewise hadang as the offering or the sacrifice.\n\nSarakiki as a ritual dance per se is a dance-offering of the Warays to their deity or deities which traces its roots to pre-colonial religious beliefs. Calbayognons held that spirits occupied a position of command over the power of nature which may inflict harm or do good in society. Rituals to please these spirits were held during feasts and other occasions like planting and harvest season, drought and in times of dreadful epidemics. The ceremony could last a couple of days. It involved the entire villagers who offered (manok) sacrifices to venerate the spirits. Traditionally, our forefathers make use of patani ug ugis nga manok (black feather and white feather chicken) as the offering in veneration of the spirits.\n\nIn the context of cultural development, the term Sarakiki is adapted to describe the significance of the movements used in the famous dance \"kuratsa\", a courtship dance eminent to all Calbayognons. Today \"kuratsa\" is the most popular dance form consummated in all celebrations most especially during wedding jovialities. Sarakiki is likewise place forth in songs particularly the SADA-SADA an event of merriment in the evening before a wedding ceremony, which redound to one of our most well-liked tradition, the so-called pamalaye or pamamanhikan. Another confirmation is the thumbs-up form of the Calbayognons while dancing which represents the tahud. During the 1st Grand National Streetdance Competition – Aliwan Fiesta on May 1–3, 2003, participated by 26 famous festivals in the country,the Sarakiki-Hadang Festival of Calbayog City won the 3rd prize. Sarakiki-Hadang Festival is celebrated in Calbayog City every year from September 1 to 8 under the auspices of the City Arts And Culture Office. \n\nGuin sasalin-urog san bulan san oktobre dyes (10) kutob oktubre desisais (16), ini nga selibrasyon nag papamatood san anibersaryo san syudad san calbayog. \nPinaagi sine durudilain nga mga aktibidadis an guin papasidungug san syudad pinaagi san mga opisyalis ngan iba pa nga mga pribadu nga sikto.

This festival is specially pursued and initiated by the descendants of the early settlers in the community called \"Tagalugan\" referring to Tagalog speaking migrants from Cavite City during the Spanish era. The celebration is prominently highlighted by the presence of \"kubol\" or sea-shanties made up of bamboo and coconut palm leaves. The devotees dance their way from the local Chapel as they bring out the image and pass by the different \"kubols\" until reaching the main \"kubol\" where a simple ceremony is conducted. The date of celebration though is not very prominent because of the confusion of the actual festival day which falls every second Sunday of November.\n\n\"Calbayog Ko\" is a famous folk song in the city composed by Jose Cinco Gomez. It serves as a symbol of the love of Calbayognons to their city and it serves as the \"anthem\" of the city. It is even sung before the office in the city hall start their duties.\n\nQuarterly Orange and Azure (blue); 1st a rope Argent (white); 2nd a Cross and Bishop's staff Argent (white); 3rd in middle chief a pair of shells Or (yellow), three fishes Argent (white) from fess point down to nombril point, and barry wavy Argent (white); 4th a Coconut tree proper (natural color) upon ground Vert (green).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nList of hospitals:\n\n\n\n\n"}
