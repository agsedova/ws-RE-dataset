{"id": "1794683", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1794683", "title": "Águeda", "text": "Águeda\n\nÁgueda () is a city and a municipality in Portugal. According to the Portuguese 2011 census, the municipality of Águeda had 47,729 inhabitants, in an area of 335.27 km². The city proper had a population of 14,504 (2001 data), while the remainder is distributed in 11 parishes, within the Baixo Vouga Subregion.\n\nÁgueda has been a municipal seat since 1834 and has had official city status since 1985. It was built on a foundation of successive Celt, Turduli and Lusitanian inhabitants since 370 BC.\n\nAncient occupation of this area dates back to the Bronze Age, marked by diverse megalithic monuments, including the archaeological site at Cabeço do Vouga, an important Roman military fortification along routes from Olissipo (Lisbon) to Bracara Augusta (Braga).\n\nIn the 9th Century, Águeda was a prosperous borough, with stable commerce and an active port that supported local and regional businesses. It was mentioned in documents from 1050 to 1077, by its primitive name \"Casal Lousado\" (), or by its anglicized forms: \"Anegia\", \"Agatha\" and \"Ágada\"; by the 9th Century, this settlement was referred to as \"Ágata\". In a document dated 1050, there is mention of several villages situated within the current borders, many with names originating from Arab languages.\n\nÁgueda never achieved a foral during the Middle Ages, in contrast to its neighbors, it was considered regal lands and dominions of the monasteries of Lorvão and Vacariça. It functioned as an ancillary center on the road to Santiago de Compostela, and the river-side village was most certainly visited by Queen Isabel (S. Elizabeth of Portugal) in 1325, during her customary pilgrimages to the religious center.\n\nA new phase of settlement occurred after the establishment of the Kingdom of Portugal, from the 11th–12th century: although its inhabitants prospered, and had many privileges, their representatives from Aveiro in the Cortes of Évora (1451), never requested a foral declaration. King D. Manuel I included Águeda in a general foral granted to Aveiro, in 1515, but was only, later, provided a separate charter.\n\nIn 1834, Águeda ascended to the category of municipal seat, as a consequence of the Portuguese Liberal Revolution, when major administrative reforms were initiated. Its important political place and strategic politico-military position allowed Águeda to support military troops during the second French Invasion, when it functioned as military hospital. Resulting from the administrative reform, Águeda began its political career in the shadow of great change, and many of its citizens were important land reformers. The municipality of Águeda was established on 31 December 1853, and integrated many older \"concelhos\" of medieval origins long since extinct, including Aguada de Cima, Castanheira do Vouga and Préstimo.\n\nAs a frontier city located between the sea and land, it occupies a privileged position, serviced by both railroads and an expanding road network. These advancements allowed the economic and social development of the region and placed Águeda in an important position, resulting in its growth and development. On 14 August 1985, Águeda was elevated to the category of city by law.\n\nThe municipality of Águeda is administratively integrated into the district of Aveiro, in the former region of Beira Litoral; it is located from Lisbon, from Porto and from Aveiro.\n\nIt is situated in the hydrographic basin of the River Vouga, limited in the north by the Vouga, the south by the river Cértima, to the east by the Serra do Caramulo (Caramulo mountains) and west by the lowlands of the Ria de Aveiro. These frontiers establish Águeda in a central position, in a transition zone between the coastal zones and interior, thus affording the municipality with various socio-economic advantages. In addition to the mentioned rivers, the area is also delimited by the River Marnel, and the tributaries of the River Águeda: the River Alfusqueiro, Agadão and Dornes ravine.\n\nThe Pateira de Fermentelos, shortly known as \"Pateira,\" is a natural lake located within the triangle of the municipalities of Águeda, Aveiro and Oliveira do Bairro, before the confluence of the Cértima and Águeda rivers. It is the largest natural lake in the Iberian peninsula, rich in diverse species of bird, fish and aquatic plants.\n\nBetween 1991 and 2001, the population resident in Águeda increased 11.3%; these were primarily in parishes of Segadães (32.9%), Aguada de Cima (32.8%) and Recardães (20.8%), while there was a 32.9% decrease in the population. Population density increased in the parishes of Águeda, Recardães, Aguada de Baixo, Fermentelos and Trofa, while parishes closer to the interior (such as Agadão, Préstimo, Castanheira do Vouga and Macieira de Alcoba) were less concentrated.\n\nSince the implementation of the national administrative reform in January 2013, the municipality includes 11 civil parishes (\"freguesias\"), resulting from the politico-administrative fusion of several of the former 20 parishes. These parishes handle local-level administrative tasks, which include provision of municipal and social services and are detailed in the following table:\n\nÁgueda is twinned with:\n\nÁgueda is an important commercial and industrial center, located in an extremely fertile area. The gastronomical and economical region where it is inserted, known as the Bairrada, encompasses many of the local civil parishes and is well known for its vineyards and wine industry, as well as its suckling roasted pig (\"Leitão Assado à Bairrada).\"\n\nIt has also developed a strong industry, mainly based on the production of motorized and common bicycles and on civil construction. In 2001, 60% of the resident population was employed in the secondary sector, yet between 1991–2001 there has been a 53% increase in those employed in tertiary sector, while there has been a 78.4% decrease in secondary sector throughout the municipality.\n\nPart of the \"litoral\" area, the region is crossed by elements of the north-south Porto-Lisbon roadway, and served by intramunicipal roads connecting it with Albergaria-a-Velha (in the north), Oiã (in the south), along the A25 and EN333, and the major EN1/IC2 motorway, that produces the major traffic influx of the region. To reach Águeda, there are essentially three distinct roadways: the EN230 (that connects Aveiro to Caramulo), the EN333 (linking Oiã to the A25, in Talhadas) and the EN336, by way of the EN230 to Mortágua. Still further, the municipality is crossed in the north by the A25, that links Aveiro and Vilar Formoso, resulting in reduced traffic along the EN1/IC2 and EN333.\n\nEven within the municipality, a line of railway lines of the Vouga line, that links Aveiro and Sernada do Vouga, provides daily direct commuter service to railstops within the region.\n\nThere are several sites of cultural significance and landscapes within the municipality that the local authority has attempted to preserve in order to promote tourism; resulting in the establishment of infrastructures and services to preserve these examples of local patrimony.\n\n\n\nAmong its traditional artisan products, the region is recognized for its traditional clay pottery, handmade baskets, knitted craft-works and tannery products.\n\nThe suckling roasted pig in the style of Bairrada is the most significant contribution to gastronomy in the region, although sweets are not far behind: \"pasteis de Águeda\" ('), \"barriga de freira\", \"fuzis\" and \"sequilhos\", in addition to the \"padas da Veiga\". Other common dishes in this region: \"chanfana\", \"rojões\", \"carne à lampantana\" or \"caldeirada de peixe\" ('), all great meals that are accompanied by local wines and sparkling drinks from the cellars of the Bairrada region.\n\nAlongside to the handmade production and the gastronomy, Águeda is also known for its cultural traditions. There are several ethnographical groups and cultural associations representing many local civil parishes and also important choirs, such as the \"Orfeão de Águeda\".\n\nThe municipality promotes many sport-related activities in the communities of Águeda, in order to foster participation and improve healthy living throughout its parishes. These initiatives include a walking and running program (Centro \"Municipal de Marcha e Corrida\"), support for many athletic clubs and leagues within its borders and the maintenance and operation of a municipal pool for local residents.\n\n\n\nApart from those athletes mentioned above, the municipality has been the residency of many importance citizens, including:\n\n\n"}

Aqua Films' Verónica Cura was the executive producer and Enrique Piñeyro was the producer.\n\nThe drama is based on the experiences of Enrique Piñeyro, former airline pilot turned whistle-blower, who became a film actor-director, and of the August 31, 1999 LAPA (\"Líneas Aéreas Privadas Argentinas\") airline accident.\n\nThe LAPA Boeing 737-200 plane, LAPA flight 3142, went into flames after crashing into a mound in midtown Buenos Aires, causing the death of 65 people, and severely injuring 17. The film's basic theme: the general corrosive deregulation, the greedy cost-cutting corporations, and the corrupt government officials, found in the Argentine airline industry. The film is named after the NATO phonetic alphabet version of the identifier of the accident aircraft, LV-WRZ (\"Lima Victor – Whisky Romeo Zulu\")\n\nThe picture opens with the District Attorney (Adolfo Yanelli), listening to voices from a recording in the black box retrieved from an air disaster. The docudrama then tells the story of director Enrique Piñeyro, who plays himself as T, a principled pilot at LAPA, an Argentine airline, upset over his company's disregard of basic safety regulations in order to save money.\n\nWhen T complains, he is labeled a troublemaker by the airline company. Soon he's chastised by his fellow pilots. When things get worse he walks out of the cockpit after multiple navigational instruments are inoperative and refuses to fly. The company simply replaces him and gets another pilot to fly. Increasingly frustrated and worried about a crash, T finally writes an angry letter to his superiors, warning that a crash is inevitable if action is not taken.\n\nThe letter is leaked to the media, and the airline is sold, but the new owners want Pineyro to retract his statement. Complicating matters, their public relations person is Marcela (Mercedes Morán), a love interest from his youth. Even though Marcela is married, T pursues her. T's story is inter-cut with the District Attorney who is looking into the LAPA flight 3142 crash, and starts receiving death threats. Yanelli's character manages to bring the company’s chief executives and the Argentine Air Force authorities before a criminal court, establishing a unique precedent in commercial aviation history.\n\n\nThe picture was first presented at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 10, 2004. It opened wide in Argentina on April 21, 2005.\n\nThe film screened at various film festivals, including: the San Francisco International Film Festival, in April, 2005 the Biarritz La Cita Film Festival, France; the Flanders International Film Festival; Belgium; the Wisconsin Film Festival, United States; the Seattle International Film Festival; the World Film Festival of Bangkok; the Havana Film Festival; and others.\n\nThe film is a fictional reproduction of the background of LAPA Flight 3142 as seen through the eyes of Enrique Piñeyro, who was a LAPA pilot from 1988 to 1999.\n\nPiñeyro resigned from his position in June 1999 – two months before the accident occurred- after voicing his concerns about the LAPA's safety policy. Regarding his motivation for making the film, Piñeyro said:\n\nAccording to producers, due to the nature of the film, a lot of the filming was done in secret. This was especially true when they filmed in airline areas. Some shots were taken with telephoto lenses.\n\nFilm critic Pamela Troy liked the acting in the film and wrote, \"Much more than a whistle blowing thriller, this beautifully made film is a powerful critique of profit-making over concern for human life.\"\n\nCritic Scott Foundas, writing for FIPRESCI believes the film achieved Enrique Piñeyro's exact goal. He wrote, \"\"Whisky Romeo Zulu\" ...emerges as a stirring, if obvious piece of agitprop that achieves exactly what it sets out to achieve. That is to say it works the audience up into an angry lather, and you emerge from the theater never wanting to set foot on another airplane again — at least, not if you feel you may have paid less than fair market value for the ticket.\" However, Foundas did not like the flashbacks to Piñeyro’s childhood which he called \"gooey and nostalgic.\"\n\nThe film critic for Seattle's \"The Stranger\", Andrew Wright, liked Piñeyro's directorial debut, and wrote, \"[D]irector Enrique Piñeyro's utterly damning docudrama comes off as both a searing factual indictment of Argentina's passenger-flight standards, and a crackerjack thriller in its own right...It also helps that he proves to be an instinctive filmmaker, employing an intriguingly fractured, minutely detailed take on the material, which hopscotches between events leading up to the easily avoidable incident, and a harried investigator's efforts to make sense of the flight recordings afterward.\"\n\nWins\n\nNominations\n\n"}

It claims a circulation of 8,000 and readership of more than 30,000. Its sole source of revenue is advertising. It is issued during the weekdays during the spring and fall semesters.\n\nThe \"Kentucky Kernel\" was preceded by several student newspapers, with the earliest dating to 1892. From 1908 to 1915, the University of Kentucky's student newspaper was called The Idea, but it became the \"Kentucky Kernel\" following a naming contest in 1915. The first issue produced under the \"Kernel\" name was published September 16, 1915.\n\nThe paper had become an eight-page weekly by 1923, and it became a Monday-Friday daily newspaper in 1966.\n\nIn 1972, the \"Kernel\" formally established its editorial and financial independence from the University of Kentucky administration.\n\nThe \"Kernel\" operates out of the Grehan Journalism Building, which is located in central campus and also is the home of the School of Journalism and Telecommunications and the Department of Communication. The Grehan Building was completed in 1951 and named to honor Enoch Grehan, the founder of the school's Department of Journalism and one of its first faculty members.\n\nSeveral prominent journalists worked at the \"Kernel\" while they were students, including current Associated Press Chief White House Correspondent Terence Hunt, former \"National Geographic\" photographer Sam Abell, current \"Chicago Tribune\" Washington correspondent William Neikirk and current \"New York Times\" South Africa correspondent Michael Wines.\n\nThe writer Bobbie Ann Mason also worked at the \"Kernel\".

It was originally located in West Kallang.\n\nSince its adoption of the Integrated Programme in 2007, it has nurtured three President's Scholars, and is one of the leading co-educational high schools in Singapore in terms of academic results. It is also one of the largest government schools in Singapore in terms of physical area.\n\nOn 14 October 1956, in the midst of the Chinese middle schools riots, the Ministry of Education established the predecessor of Dunman High School, Kallang West Government Chinese Middle School, along with other schools like River Valley High School and Hua Yi Secondary School. It was renamed Dunman High School after Thomas Dunman.\n\nIn the 1956 riots, Chinese middle-school students who subscribed to the communist ideology staged sit-ins and demonstrations, disrupted classes, and in effect shut their schools down. The function of the newly established Kallang West Government Chinese Middle School was to allow students who had no wish to be embroiled in communism to have a place to study. The premises of a newly built primary school at Mountbatten Road were loaned, and the initial enrolment included about 100 boys from The Chinese High School, with 10 teachers. In December 1957 the school moved to Dunman Road and was renamed \"Dunman Government Chinese Middle School\".\n\nIn 1979, the school was selected to be one of the nine Special Assistance Plan (SAP) secondary schools. The school was renamed \"Dunman High School\" and began to offer both English and Chinese languages at the first-language level. When the Music Elective Programme (MEP) was introduced by the MOE in 1982, DHS was selected to implement the programme for musically gifted students.\n\nIn 1990, the school expanded its physical area by taking over the neighbouring former premises of Dunman Secondary School at Dunman Road. It then became a single-session school (previously the school was divided into the \"morning session\" and \"afternoon session\" so that two classes of students could share a classroom). It was one of six schools to go autonomous in 1994. The school moved to its current location in Tanjong Rhu on 27 May 1995. It was made the 7th Gifted Education Programme centre in Singapore in 1997.\n\nA time capsule was launched on the opening ceremony of DHS's 50th anniversary celebrations on 31 March 2006. The time capsule will be opened in 2031 on Dunman High's 75th anniversary. Items such as the DHS uniform and the 2006 student handbook were placed in it. A letter by the current Principal of the school was also included. In addition, a Heritage Run was organised that day. There were also performances, including a dance by the school's Chinese Society, and a drumming performance by the percussionists from Chinese Orchestra and Symphonic Band. A 50th anniversary song, written by Kelvin Ang Chin Yuan, was played by Clara Ng Yi Wen and sung by the school.\n\nFrom 2005, the school offered implemented a customised version of the 6-year Integrated Programme called the Dunman High Programme (DHP), which allows all students to bypass the O-Level examinations and directly take the A-Level examinations. To meet the needs of the Integrated Programme, the school moved to a holding school in the former Raffles Junior College at Mount Sinai in December 2006 to allow for upgrading of the current site at Tanjong Rhu.\n\nThe land area of the expanded campus increased from four hectares to seven hectares, making Dunman High School one of the biggest government-aided schools in Singapore. In December 2008 the classrooms, general office and staff rooms of the Tanjong Rhu campus were completed, and the school moved back to the Tanjong Rhu campus. On 2 January 2009 the school opened to a new year with an opening ceremony named \"Homecoming\" (回家) to welcome students and staff to the upgraded campus.\n\nOn 5 September 2017, Dunman High was featured in an episode of Channel 8's \"When The Bell Rings\" documentary series. This eight episode documentary series featured eight Special Assistance Plan (SAP) Schools in Singapore, and told stories of their transformation through the times. The episode on Dunman High was the last episode to be aired.\n\nOn 21 September 2018, the Ministry of Education announced that the final two remaining schools offering the IP - Dunman High School and River Valley High School - would be participating in the Joint Admissions Exercise in future.\n\nDunman High School's Chinese name \"Démíng\" (德明) is a transliteration of \"Dunman\". The meaning of its name in Chinese is derived from a line in the \"Book of Rites\" (大学之道，在明明德) which is a statement that has influenced the Emperors of the Han, Tang and Song dynasties in Imperial China. It can be roughly translated as \"the Dao (path) to the greatest learning lies in understanding the brightest virtues\".\n\nThe school crest of Dunman High School was designed by the late Chen Jen Hao, its second principal, and Liu Kang, a pioneer in local fine art and former art teacher of the school. The two Chinese characters read, from right to left, \"\"Dé míng\"\", the Chinese name of the school. The characters are written in seal script.\n\nThe red colour symbolises passion and the drive for success. The blue colour signifies peace and dignity, while the circular border represents wholeness and unity, as well as the pursuit of universality, as defined in the Confucian classic \"Book of Rites\".\n\nDunman High School preserved its school song in Mandarin Chinese. The lyrics were originally written as a prose by a chemistry teacher of the school in 1953.\n\nDunman High School is currently one of the largest government schools in Singapore in terms of physical area.\n\nIncorporated within the six-year Dunman High Programme (DHP) are the Junior High (Secondary) and Senior High (DJC) sections, which leads to the Singapore-Cambridge GCE Advanced Level examination. The school-wide Integrated Programme offered enables students to bypass the Singapore-Cambridge GCE Ordinary Level examination that is taken in the Special/Express course. Dunman High Junior High uses a Grade Point Average scoring system, with the following scoring system. As of 2019, the scoring system for Junior High students has been updated to include B+ and C+ grades.\n\nDHS also organises academic competitions and conferences, both for its students and external participants. A variety of academic programmes, hosted by both the school as well as the Ministry of Education, are offered to students with the potential to excel.\n\nVarious special programmes are offered in the school, such as the Bicultural Studies Programme (BSP), the Art Elective Programme (AEP) and the Music Elective Programme (MEP). These programmes offer a degree of specialisation that is generally not attainable in the standard curriculum, enabling students in the school to explore respective fields to a greater degree. On top of these programmes, Dunman High also offers a wider variety of GCE 'A' Level Examination subjects, including the newly included subject H2 Translation, as well as courses like H2 China Studies in Chinese. Extensive support and guidance is available for students who are interested in furthering their interests with H3 subjects.\n\nSpecial Programmes offered in school are listed below:\n\nDunman High School offers Co-curricular Activities (CCAs), including competitive sports, uniformed groups, musical groups and clubs and societies. The school's traditional forte has been Chinese orchestral music. The Uniformed Groups have a strong presence in Dunman High School, with Saint John Ambulance Brigade, Scouts, Girl Guides and National Police Cadet Corps achieving honours.\n\nThe Co-curricular Activities (CCAs) offered by Dunman High School is listed below:\n\nSports and Games\n\nPerforming Arts\n\nUniformed Groups (Junior High)\n\nClubs and Societies\n\nStudent Interest Groups (Senior High)\n\nThe student council is the student welfare body that work closely with the school committee to bring forth initiatives and changes for the school. They are also responsible for the daily functions of the school.\n\nIt is not officially affiliated with any other school. However, it holds an annual sports meet with Chung Cheng High School (Main), Ngee Ann Secondary School and Temasek Secondary School called the Four-School Combined Athletics Meet since 1980, in which students aged 13 to 16 from the four schools compete in Track & Field events. The original four schools were Dunman, Chung Cheng High School (Main), Chung Cheng High School (Branch) (now Chung Cheng High School (Yishun)) and Yuying Secondary School.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Succeeding his cousin Vakhtang II, David's rule actually extended only over the eastern part of the kingdom, whereas western Georgia had been under the Imeretian branch of the House of Bagrationi since 1259.\n\nIn 1295, he supported Baidu Khan in an internal conflict in the Ilkhanate. However, Baidu was killed and Ghazan became a khan. Ghazan ordered the Georgian king to arrive to his capital Tabriz. Remembering the fate of his father, David refused to comply and began preparations for war. Ghazan Khan responded with a punitive expedition, and ravaged the country. Supported by the Mongols, Ossetes attacked Shida Kartli province and occupied the Liakhvi River gorge. David entrenched himself in the Mtiuleti mountains and defeated a large Mongol force in a desperate guerilla fighting at Tsikare. Then, the Khan declared him deposed and appointed David's younger brother Giorgi V as king in 1299.\n\nAlthough backed by the Mongol forces, the power of Giorgi did not extend out of the Georgian capital Tbilisi, and the Khan replaced him by another brother, Vakhtang III, in 1302. The new king led a Mongol army against David, but could not penetrate deeply into the largely mountainous provinces held by the rebels, and a truce was negotiated. David was recognized as joint sovereign with his brother and received the princedom of Alastani in the southern province of Javakheti. He developed friendly relations with the Egyptian Mamluks, the traditional rivals of the Ilkhanate, and, mediated by Byzantium, achieved the restoration of the Monastery of the Cross in Jerusalem to the Georgian Orthodox and Apostolic Church in 1305.\n\nDavid was married twice, first to the Mongol princess Oljath, and then to a daughter of the Georgian nobleman Hamada Surameli.

With a construction history dating to 1836, it was one of the oldest surviving wood-frame textile mills in the state prior to a 1994 fire which led to its demolition. The mill complex was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.\n\nThe Saxony Mill complex stood at the western end of Rockville's industrial area, occupying the lowest water privilege in the town on the Hockanum River. It was located at the western end of West Main Street, at its junction with West Street. The site is now a public park. The mill consisted of seven connected structures, most of brick and masonry, built between 1836 and the 1970s. The main (original) mill building was a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure with a distinctive five-story bell tower rising from the center of its front facade. The remaining structures, all built with load-bearing masonry walls, were added after c. 1870.\n\nThe oldest portion of the mill, the northern section of the main building, was built in 1836. The Saxony Mill Company was founded in 1838 as a joint-stock company organized by that mill's proprietors. The mill at first produced satinet, a woolen material developed as a less-expensive alternative to fine woolens which were then only available from England. The mill went through a series of owners who used the complex in different aspects of textile production until 1951, when most of Rockville's mills were closed. The main mill was enlarged in 1861, and various additions were made in the early decades of the 20th century. Most recently operated by Plastifoam, a suspicious fire on July 25, 1994 did extensive damage to the then-vacant building and surrounding buildings, and disrupted power to thousands of people. The remaining structure was demolished a short time later. The site is now a municipal park.\n\n"}

The population in 2011 was 25,252, in an area of 158.83 km². It had 19,687 eligible voters in 2006.\n\nIn 1117, D. Teresa, Countess of Portucale, and mother of Afonso Henriques the first king of Portugal, donated to the nobleman Gonçalo Eriz the lands that constitute Albergaria-a-Velha. As part of the donation the nobleman was obligated to maintain open a hospice for poor travels. The document referred to this shelter for the travelling poor, or \"albergaria\", and thus the area was known as \"Albergaria\".\n\nLater, the Carta do Couto de Osselôa was discovered that definitely identified both the first document to refer to Portugal as a \"Kingdom\" and at the same figured in the identification of Albergaria-a-Velha as an administrative unit of the country. The Bishop of Coimbra, D. Egas, in 1258, ordered this document to be transcribed in order to conserve it. Also, because it was the older \"Albergaria\", owing to the existence of Albergaria-a-Nova, the community began to be referred to as \"Albergaria-a-Velha\" (meaning Portuguese for \"older\").\n\nThe first references to Albergaria as town, developed in the 16th Century, with the erection of an obelisk in the municipal square, around the location of the first hospital. It was ordered erected at the hospital by the Lisbon government on 27 May 1629.\n\nThe municipality was created in 1834, when the older municipality of Aveiro was dismembered, and the new administrative divisions Loure, Albergaria-a-Velha and Vale Maior reconstituted. Just after this reconstitution, the parish of Alquerubim (Paus) was annexed to Albergaria-a-Velha, and later the parishes of Branca, Ribeira de Fráguas ( both around 1855), Angeja and Frossos (in 1854) were incorporated.\n\nThe municipality of Albergaria-a-Velha is located in the transition zone between the coastal municipalities of Murtosa, Aveiro, Estarreja and Ílhavo and the more mountain communities in the interior.\n\nAdministratively, the municipality is divided into 6 civil parishes (\"freguesias\"):\n\nThe fertile lands of Albergaria-a-Velha have been historically a center of agriculture and cattle-raising, so much so, that it has been erroneously considered an agricultural community. In fact, the secondary sector represents 56.2% of the activity within the municipality, while the primary sector occupies 13.6% of the economic activity. This secondary sector includes basic industrial businesses involved in metallurgy, industrial textiles and lumber industries. These companies are primarily small- to medium-size enterprises with less than 20 employees.\n\nMost of the transformative sectors are concentrated in the parishes of Albergaria-a-Velha and Branca, representing about 90% of the secondary sector. The urbanized are of the parish of Albergaria-a-Velha is the primary beneficiary of these industries; its geo-strategic position in the center of the municipality and industrial zone provides the region with incubator affects. Activities such as metallurgy and fabrication, equipment production, transformation of lumber goods, paper production, the fabrication and restoration of furniture, as well as the production of ceramics, provide Albergaria-a-Velha with a diversified economic base.\n\nWater Mills Route\n\nThe Water Mills predominate in Albergaria-a-Velha - a municipality with the largest number of inventoried water mills in Europe - constituting one of the most important elements of the rural landscape throughout the entire municipality. These are elements with high patrimonial value that delight the eyes of their citizens and all the visitors that dare to explore them.\n\nAlbergaria-a-Velha is a land of traditions made of water, bread and mills. The Water Mills Route is currently made up of 11 clusters in a total of 14 mills with 19 couples of millstones, distributed in different parishes of the county.\n\nThe mill was one of the central places in the life of a rural community, where the memories of once, are still very much alive in the daily rituals of the millers and in the endless spinning of their millstones and casters. Although there are mills throughout the municipality, it is along the Rio Caima that we have the units of greatest expression and importance, since the more stable flow allowed permanent work. However, also in the rivers Fílveda and Jardim, in the streams of Albergaria-a-Velha, Fontão, Frias, Fial and Mouquim and in the countless corgas and ditches of all the parishes, there are traces or records of more than three and a half hundred mills, indicating the importance that the mill activity had in the region.\n\nThese mills were built mainly in the 18th and 19th centuries, using local construction materials. Situated on the banks of rivers and streams, they took advantage of the water force of the watercourses, diverting it by taking it directly to the cube where the pressure was increased by the effect of gravity, feeding the feathers of the wooden caster and making it rotate.\n\nThe force generated by this action is transmitted by the axis, generating the force to move the stone wheels. Many of them were mills of several owners, so they were used according to a schedule previously agreed between all their users.\n\nHere the local crops were mainly ground, with particular emphasis on corn and wheat. These mills were also used for the husking of rice produced in the Baixo Vouga region, using cork slabs that covered the millstones, which reduced their abrasive effect.\n\n"}

The population in 2011 was 29,150, in an area of 216.63 km². It had 26,915 eligible voters. The city of Anadia is part of Arcos e Mogofores parish. The city itself had a population of 3,034 in 2001, while Arcos e Mogofores parish has about 5,000.\n\nThe history of the municipality is poorly documented before the Roman era, although some vestiges of early Paleolithic (Monte Crasto, Carvalhais and Vila Nova de Monsarros), Neolithic (Moita) and Iron Age (Monte Crasto) artifacts have been studied in this area. But remnants of Roman era artifacts have been isolated in many parts of the municipality, including Aguim, Avelãs de Caminho, Avelãs de Cima, Mogofores, Moita, Óis do Bairro, São Lourenço do Bairro, Vila Nova de Monsarros, Vilarinho do Bairro and, especially, in Anadia (Monte Crasto) and Sangalhos. In addition to domestic ceramic evidence, this early villages in this area existed along the cross roads between the major Roman towns of the time: Olissipo (Lisbon) and Cale (Porto). This continues to be a source of investigation and theories as to the local importance.\n\nAlthough there may have existed organized communities during this period, it was only during the Medieval Age when documentation began to appear. As such, the villages of São Lourenço do Bairro (883), Arcos (943), Sangalhos (957), Vila Nova de Monsarros (1006), Levira (1020), Vilarinho do Bairro (1020), Samel (1020), Monsarros (1064), Moita (1064), Tamengos (1064), Horta (1064), Anadia (1082), Quintela (1082), Óis do Bairro (1086), Aguim (1101), Mata (1131), Avelãs de Baixo (1132), Figueira (1138), Ferreiros (1138), Ancas (1143), Mogofores (1143), Sá (1143) and Paredes do Bairro (1143), where documented in local land registries and referenced in court records.\n\nWith about five centuries of populational existence, the area of Anadia developed over successive mutations in administrative domain. The region, during its formative age, was not developed from the implementation of forals as was the traditional method of instituting land development. But, in the historical Aveiro district on three forals were instituted to promote development: Ferreiros, Fontemanha and Vale de Avim (centers that were part of the older parish of Moita). There have been posterior references to forals conceded in this area (in Avelãs de Caminho, for example), but they were insufficiently explained to indicate that the forals were more than mere local or defensive contracts between the Crown and/or the peoples of the area. Further, there were erroneous references to \"older forals\" by contemporary authors, in particular case, the municipalities of Aguim and Anadia. At the beginning of the 16th century, during the administrative reforms of King Manuel I, the king did not forget the coastal central region, and allocated several forals. In 1514, the municipalities of Anadia, Avelãs de Cima, Vilarinho do Bairro, Carvalhais (which included Ferreiros, Fontemanha and Vale de Avim), São Lourenço do Bairro, Aguim, Sangalhos, Pereiro (the parish of Avelãs de Cima), Óis do Bairro, Mogofores, Avelãs de Caminho, Boialvo (parish of Avelãs de Cima) and Vila Nova de Monsarros; in 1519 Paredes do Bairro was granted a writ and then in 1520 forals for Mogofores and Óis do Bairro were established.\n\nThe municipality of Anadia is located in the Beira Litoral area of the Centro Region, in an area of the Baixo Vouga referred to as the Bairrada, an area traditionally representative of the district of Aveiro. Anadia is situated geographically between the municipalities of Águeda and Oliveira do Bairro (in the north), Mealhada (to the south) and bordered by the municipal borders of Cantanhede (in the west) and Mortágua (in the east).\n\nAnadia is in the heart of Bairrada, a fertile agricultural and viticulture area, which has recently stagnated in terms of population. Anadia municipality has one city: Anadia (which is in the parish of Arcos) and one town: Sangalhos. Curia, a village in Tamengos parish is a popular tourist spa with hotels, restaurants and a park with a lagoon.\n\nAdministratively, the municipality is divided into 10 civil parishes (\"freguesias\"):\n\n\n\n\n"}

Sultan Selim III set about preparations for war with Russia after positively receiving Sebastiani. The Russian emperor, Alexander I, was alarmed by these developments as he had already deployed a significant force to Poland and East Prussia to fight the advancing French forces under Emperor Napoleon I. Alexander requested British assistance in keeping Turkey out of the war.\n\nThe British army was far too small and inadequate to impose the will of the Coalition on the Ottomans, so it naturally fell to the powerful Royal Navy to meet Russia's requests. The ships immediately available for the task were HMS \"Canopus\", HMS \"Standard\", HMS \"Thunderer\", HMS \"Glatton\", and the two bomb ships HMS \"Lucifer\" and HMS \"Meteor\", under the command of Vice-Admiral Cuthbert Collingwood, commander-in-chief of the British Mediterranean Fleet, sailed for the Dardanelles and made preparations for the upcoming assault.\n\nIn the meantime, the British ambassador to Constantinople, Arbuthnot, demanded that the Ottoman government evict Sebastiani, and added that should the Ottomans resist the ultimatum, the Mediterranean fleet would attack.\n\nThe actual force that had been chosen by Collingwood to carry out the operation was small—only eight ships-of-the-line and four frigates. In addition, four Russian ships-of-the-line under Admiral Dmitry Senyavin were sent to support the British, but did not join Duckworth until after the exit from Dardanelles was made. Admiral Duckworth, who commanded the British, was under orders to bombard Constantinople and seize the Turkish battle fleet.\n\nIn anticipation of a war between Russia and Turkey, Britain had sent Sir Thomas Louis from Cadiz on 2 November 1806 into the Mediterranean Sea. He reached Tenedos, near the Dardanelles Strait, on 21 November, made a brief trip to Constantinople and returned to the Straits. Turkey had declared war on Russia on 30 December 1806, and Britain sent Admiral Sir John Duckworth in \"Royal George\" 100 guns from Cadiz on 15 January 1807 into the Mediterranean Sea. Picking up \"Windsor Castle\" 98 guns and \"Repulse\" 74 guns from Gibraltar and \"Pompée\" 74 and \"Ajax\" 74 from Malta as replacements for the Russian fleet under Seniavin, which was still in the Adriatic, Duckworth proceeded to Tenedos. Despite the British ultimatum, on December 27 Selim declared war on Russia. On 29 January 1807, the frigate \"Endymion\" of 40 guns left Constantinople, evacuating the British ambassador and all British residents. A formal declaration of war had not yet been sent by London and the two powers were still technically allied.\n\nOn February 10, Duckworth's fleet concentrated at the mouth of the Dardanelles. It met Louis's ships and returned to Tenedos on 1 February, where Duckworth's ships met up. Still not technically at war, the Turkish delayed Duckworth with token negotiations. The presence of British and Russian vessels at the mouth of the Dardanelles caused Sebastiani and his French engineering officers to begin the improvement of the Turkish shore batteries.\n\nOn 11 February, the fleet, with Duckworth in command, left Tenedos, but for a week could not enter the Straits because of lack of wind. \"Ajax\" caught fire on 14 February, ran aground on Tenedos, and blew up on 15 February.\n\nFinally, on 19 February the ships sailed up the Dardanelles, where they were fired on by the forts at the entrance (fire was returned by the bombs), then the castles further up (fire was returned by the fleet). However, the absence of significant numbers of Turkish troops owing to the end of Ramadan meant the batteries were ineffective and the fleet quickly reached the Sea of Marmara.\n\nJust above the castles lay a 64-gun ship, frigates of 40, 36, 36, and 32 guns, sloops of 22, 18, 10 and 10 guns, 2 brigs and 2 gunboats. As the British fleet approached, one of the brigs left and sailed further up for Constantinople. After \"Royal George\" passed, anchoring some 3 miles further up, \"Pompée\", \"Thunderer\", \"Standard\", \"Endymion\" and \"Active\" attacked the Turkish vessels and a new fortification being built nearby. 1 sloop and 1 gunboat were captured and others forced ashore and destroyed by British boats. Duckworth then ordered marines under Edward Nicolls to land and seize the shore batteries, and as the Turkish gunners tried to flee from an island they called Brota, the Royal Marines captured two guns.\n\nAt 5pm the fleet sailed for Constantinople, leaving \"Active\" behind to finish up. British casualties in this action were 10 killed and 77 wounded. After suffering extensive damage, Duckworth withdrew without ever attempting a bombardment of Constantinople.\n\nOne of the batteries deployed by the Turks against the British Fleet was armed with a medieval 18.6 ton cast bronze piece with 63 cm diameter stones used for projectiles, known as the Dardanelles Gun. The piece had been cast in 1464 on the model of bombards used in the 1453 Siege of Constantinople and now resides in Fort Nelson.\n\nDuckworth sailed off Constantinople for a week and a half, hoping the Turkish fleet would come out and fight, but it did not. Releasing the sloop on 2 March, he returned through the Dardanelles to Tenedos on 3 March. On the way, the fortifications again fired on the British, who lost 29 killed and 138 wounded. At Tenedos he was met by Seniavin, who had left Corfu on 22 February.\n\nHe did not make a second attempt on the Dardanelles—a decision that earned him criticism, but was probably reasonable considering the powerful shore batteries. An attempt to seize the Turkish fleet would have probably failed and resulted in much higher British casualties.\n\nThe entire operation was a failure, resulting in heavy losses of 42 killed, 235 wounded, and 4 missing. Long after France and Russia had made peace and Senyavin had defeated the Turkish fleet at Dardanelles on 10–11 May 1807, the Ottomans would remain at war with Russia, draining a significant portion of the Russian army, which also became involved in operations against Sweden in the Finnish War, and later in the resumption of hostilities against France in 1812.\n\nThe Royal Navy fleet included:\n\nVanguard Division\ncommanded by Rear-Admiral Sir Thomas Louis\n\nMain Division\ncommanded by Vice-Admiral Sir John Thomas Duckworth\n\nRear Division\ncommanded by Rear-Admiral Sir Sidney Smith\n\n\n\n"}

It is an herbaceous perennial native to woodland and rocky slopes in eastern North America, prized for its red and yellow flowers. It readily hybridizes with other species in the genus \"Aquilegia\".\n\nThe plant is tall. The fern-like leaves are lobed and grouped in threes, growing from the base and off the flowering stems. The flowers are long and have yellow petals with a red spur and red sepals. They appear in late spring (usually in May and June), nodding on stems above the leaves. The round end of the spur contains nectar, which is sought by butterflies and hummingbirds.\n\nThe caterpillars of Columbine Duskywing (\"Erynnis lucilius\") feed on the leaves.\n\n\"Aquilegia canadensis\" is a highly decorative plant, valued for its attractive foliage and showy flowers. For this reason it is widely grown outside its native region, in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. In the UK it has been awarded the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.\n\nThe plant is easily propagated from seed, and blooms the second year from sowing. It is relatively long lived in the garden. It grows well in shade, and in sun with proper moisture.\n\nThe cultivar 'Little Lanterns' is half the height of the species.\n\nNative American tribes used various parts of red columbine in herbal remedies for ailments such as headache, sore throat, fever, rash caused by poison ivy, stomatitis, kidney and urinary problems, and heart problems. Native American men also rubbed crushed seeds on their hands as a love charm.\n\nCanada columbine contains a cyanogenic glycoside, which releases poisonous hydrogen cyanide when the plant is damaged.\n\nUSA (AL, AR, CT, DC, DE, FL, GA, IA, IL, IN, KS, KY, MA, MD, ME, MI, MN, MO, MS, NC, ND, NE, NH, NJ, NY, OH, OK, PA, RI, SC, SD, TN, TX, VA, VT, WI, WV), Canada (MB, NB, ON, QC, SK)\n\nWetland is an extremely valuable but limited resource in the USA. The Wetland Indicator Status is used to determine which native plant species can provide information about the presence of wetland in a given area. Essentially if a plant thrives in a particular area, it means there is a greater likelihood of wetland there. \"Aquilegia canadensis\" is one such species.\n\n\n"}

In 1967 they were chosen by Otis Redding to play as his backing band and were tutored for that role by Al Jackson, Jr., Booker T. Jones, and the other members of Booker T. & the M.G.'s. Their first single, \"Soul Finger\", was issued on April 14, 1967, reaching number 3 on the US \"Billboard\" R&B Singles chart and number 17 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. \n\nOn December 10, 1967, Redding and four members of the band—Jimmie King (born June 8, 1949; guitar), Ronnie Caldwell (born December 27, 1948; electric organ), Phalon Jones (born 1948; saxophone), and Carl Cunningham (born 1948; drums)—and their partner, Matthew Kelly, died when their airplane crashed into Lake Monona, near Madison, Wisconsin, while attempting to land at Truax Field. Redding and the band were scheduled to play their next concerts in Madison. Trumpeter Ben Cauley was the only survivor of the crash. Bassist James Alexander was on another plane, as the plane carrying Redding held only seven passengers. Cauley and Alexander rebuilt the group.\n\nThe re-formed band consisted of Cauley; Alexander; Harvey Henderson, saxophone; Michael Toles, guitar; Ronnie Gorden, organ; Willie Hall, drums; and later Larry Dodson (formerly of fellow Stax act the Temprees), lead vocals.

It was released on October 30, 2002 in North America and a week later in Europe.\n\nA spin-off from the \"Age of Empires\" series, \"Age of Mythology\" takes some of its inspiration from mythology and legends of the Greeks, Egyptians, and Norse, rather than from actual historical events. Many gameplay elements are similar to the \"Age of Empires\" series. Its campaign follows an Atlantean admiral, Arkantos, who is forced to travel through the lands of the game's three cultures, hunting for a cyclops who is in league with Poseidon against Atlantis.\n\n\"Age of Mythology\" was commercially successful, going platinum four months after its release after selling over one million units. In 2003, it was followed by an expansion pack, \"\". On May 8, 2014, \"Age of Mythology: Extended Edition\" was released for Windows via Steam. This was followed by a second expansion pack, \"Age of Mythology: Tale of the Dragon\", released on January 28, 2016.\n\nLike many other real-time strategy games, \"Age of Mythology\" is based on defeating enemy units and towns, building your own units and towns, and training villagers and fighters. In this way, players are able to defeat and conquer rival towns and civilizations. Players advance their tribe through four \"Ages\": starting in the Archaic Age, the player may upgrade to the Classical Age, the Heroic Age, and finally, the Mythic Age. Each upgrade to a higher Age unlocks new units and technologies for the player, which strengthens their settlement. However, upgrading requires a sum of resources to be paid and a certain prerequisite building to be constructed.\n\nThere are three playable cultures in \"Age of Mythology\": the Greeks, Egyptians, and Norse. Each culture has three \"major gods\"—important deities such as Ra, Zeus, or Odin. The player chooses their major god before the game begins. Every time a player advances to the next age, a \"minor god\" is selected. Minor gods are slightly less significant historically than their major counterparts. Some minor gods include Bast and Aphrodite. All gods grant the player unique technologies, myth units, and a unique \"god power\"—A one-time special ability that can either damage an opponent, or benefit the player that uses it.\n\nThere are four major resources in \"Age of Mythology\": food, wood, gold, and favor; unlike previous games by Ensemble Studios, this game does not include the stone resource. Resources can be used to train units, construct buildings, and research technologies, among other things. Civilian units—namely, the Greek villagers, Norse gatherers and dwarfs, the Egyptian laborers, and fishing boats—are used to gather resources. Hunting animals, gathering berries, harvesting livestock, farming, and fishing are all methods by which food can be gathered. Wood is gathered only by chopping down trees, and gold is gathered from either gold mines or from trade. Players can purchase upgrades that increase the rate of gathering these resources. Favor is acquired in different ways by different cultures: Greek players gain it by having villagers pray at temples; Egyptian players earn it by building monuments; and Norse players receive it by fighting/hunting animals or by possessing heroes. Resources can be exchanged at a player's market, with the exception of favor.\n\nEvery unit in the game takes up between one and five \"population slots\". Building additional houses or Town Centers—the main building in a player's town—increases the population capacity, up to a maximum of 300.\n\nUnits can be classified into seven categories; infantry, archers, cavalry—the three of which are broadly classified as human units—siege units, naval units, heroes, and myth units (monsters and other creatures from mythology).\nThe rock-paper-scissors model governs most units in battle. For example, infantry do additional damage to cavalry, cavalry do additional damage to archers, and archers do additional damage to infantry. The same rock-paper-scissors formation exists in the three different types of naval units—arrow ships, siege ships, and hammer ships. Siege units are generally exempt from the rock-paper-scissors model but are instead able to destroy buildings easily while being vulnerable to cavalry attacks. Heroes are extremely effective against myth units, which in turn do large amounts of damage against human units. Heroes are also able to collect relics, which grant the player additional economic or military bonuses when deposited in a player's temple. Most units can be upgraded, making them better at certain tasks.\n\nBuildings in \"Age of Mythology\" can generally be split into three categories: economic, military, and defensive. The most important economic building is the Town Center, which is similar to the building of the same name in the \"Age of Empires\" series games. Most civilian units are trained at the Town Center, as are some improvements. Most importantly, players advance Age via the building. The Town Center provides 15 population slots, and building additional houses will earn the player 10 additional slots per house. In the Heroic Age, players may claim settlements (unclaimed Town Centres) for additional population slots. In some cases owning all town centres will trigger a countdown to victory. Other economic buildings include the farm and market.\n\nBuildings are able to research improvements, as well as provide resources for the player. All units except civilians and myth units are trained at military buildings. These buildings differ in name and purpose between culture, but all are able to train similar units. Military buildings are also used to research military specific technologies, such as armor upgrades, and attack improvements.\n\nWalls and towers are defensive structures, which are not able to train units, and are used only for the purposes of defense. They are able to research some upgrades, although these are generally only useful to the building performing the research. Another type of building available to players, is a Wonder: a grand building that represents an architectural achievement of the civilization. In certain game modes, once a player builds a wonder, a ten-minute countdown begins. If the wonder is still standing after the countdown ends, the player who built the wonder wins.\n\nThe \"Age of Mythology\" editor is far more advanced than that of its predecessor, the \"\" scenario editor. As well as standard unit placement facilities, the editor allows units to be overlapped, and it facilitates for large mountains, and steep terrain. Triggers, a popular aspect of scenario design in \"\", are also present in \"Age of Mythology\"'s editor, as well as cinematics and other special effects.\n\nUnlike the campaign modes in \"Age of Empires\" and \"\", \"Age of Mythology\" only has one central campaign, \"Fall of the Trident\". The campaign is significantly longer than campaigns in previous games, with a total of 32 scenarios.\n\nMultiplayer is a highly popular aspect of \"Age of Mythology\". Most multiplayer games are played through Ensemble Studios Online (ESO), or via a direct LAN or IP connection.\n\n\"Age of Mythology\" included unlimited free multiplayer accounts on ESO. it is no longer possible to create new accounts but access to already created ones is still possible. Similar in function to Blizzard Entertainment's Battle.net, ESO allows players to play matches, as well as chat with other players.\n\nIn multiplayer games, there are seven different game types available, all of which are provided as standard with the game: \"Supremacy\"—the standard game mode—includes randomly generated map and all gameplay aspects; \"Conquest\" is similar to Supremacy, but victory is only possible by defeating all other players; in \"Deathmatch\" players begin the game with high resources, but the game is otherwise the same as Supremacy; in \"Lightning\", the gameplay is identical to Supremacy, but the game plays at twice the normal speed; in \"Nomad\" mode, players start with one civilian unit, and no Town Center, and must build up on a settlement; the goal of \"King of the Hill\" is to control a monument in the center of the map for a set period of time; and in \"Sudden Death\", a player loses if their Town Center is destroyed, and they fail to rebuild it within a set period of time.\n\nMultiplayer tournaments and LAN parties are popular throughout the world, with many players visiting computer gaming lounges to participate.\n\nAtlantean admiral and war hero Arkantos arrives at Atlantis after several years of warfare to see his son, Kastor. However, he is ordered by the Atlantean councillor and theocrat, Krios, to sail to Troy to assist Agamemnon in the Trojan War. Just then, the island is attacked by krakens and the Black Sails, a group of pirate bandits led by the minotaur Kamos, a fierce enemy of Arkantos. After the trident from Poseidon's statue gets stolen, Arkantos raids the pirate settlement on a nearby island, where he recovers the trident, although Kamos escapes on a leviathan and vows revenge. Arkantos sends the trident back to Atlantis and sails away, leaving Kastor behind against the latter's wishes.\n\nArkantos travels to Troy to assist Agamemnon. After a series of skirmishes against Troy, fighting alongside Ajax and Odysseus, they devise the plan involving the Trojan Horse, and swiftly win the war. Afterwards, Ajax recommends Arkantos to sail to Ioklos to repair his ships, which are too heavily damaged for the trip back to Atlantis. When they arrive, the port has been raided by bandits, who have imprisoned the centaur Chiron. After rescuing Chiron, he reveals that the leader of the bandits is a man named Kemsyt.\n\nChiron takes them north to locate the other prisoners, who are being forced to dig up an entrance to the underworld by Gargarensis, a cyclops warlord and commander of both Kemsyt and Kamos. The heroes destroy Gargarensis's base and confront him, but he escapes to the underworld of Erebus using the entrance. The heroes follow Gargarensis into the underworld, where they find him trying to burst open a large door in the stone with a huge battering ram. Cautious of his motives, they destroy the ram. Gargarensis confronts them and causes a cave to collapse before escaping, forcing the heroes to find another way out. With the help of the dead, they reach three temples dedicated to the Greek gods Poseidon, Zeus, and Hades. Arkantos prays to Atlantis's patron Poseidon for help but receives none. He then prays to Zeus, who creates a staircase to the surface.\n\nReaching the surface, they find themselves in Egypt, where they help a Nubian mercenary leader named Amanra in fighting Kemsyt, who is there to steal a relic that Amanra's men are excavating. She reveals that the Egyptian god Osiris has been killed by Set, who aids Gargarensis. Amanra plans to reunite Osiris's body parts scattered throughout the desert, bringing him back. During this time. Arkantos falls asleep and is met by Athena in his dreams, who reveals Gargarensis's motives:\n\nAges before, the Earth was ruled by the Titans under Kronos. Zeus stopped Kronos and imprisoned him in Tartarus, behind adamantine doors. However, Poseidon, who is envious of Zeus's power, is trying to free Kronos and the Titans in order to destroy Zeus so he could claim the throne. Gargarensis is aiding him because Poseidon and Kronos have promised him immortality as a reward. Athena asks Arkantos to stop Gargarensis at all costs, as Zeus himself cannot interfere.\n\nIn order to stop him, Arkantos travels with Ajax, while Amanra and Chiron go their separate ways to find the pieces of Osiris. Amanra goes north, where she finds Kemsyt's fortress on an island. With the aid of nearby villagers, she captures the piece he had stolen, but Kemsyt escapes. Chiron finds and recovers another piece hidden beneath a giant tamarisk tree, and is aided by Norsemen, who are trying to stop Ragnarok. Meanwhile, Arkantos and Ajax find the last piece in Kamos's main fortress. Arkantos raids the fortress, secures the piece, and mortally wounds Kamos with a spear, who falls to his death.\n\nThe heroes gather all the pieces outside Osiris's pyramid, which protects another gate to Tartarus. Osiris is resurrected and defeats Gargarensis's army but the cyclops escapes, heading north to the Norselands, the location of another Tartarus gate.\n\nFollowing Gargarensis, Ajax and Arkantos find Odysseus's wrecked ship on the coast of an island, and so decide to land to look for him. Upon landing, both men are turned into boars by the sorceress Circe. They proceed to rescue Odysseus and his men, who have also been cursed, destroying her fortress in the process and reversing the curse. Odysseus continues his journey home, while Arkantos and Ajax continue north.\n\nWhen they reach the frozen Norselands, they are given directions to the underworld by dwarf brothers Brokk and Eitri in return for repelling giants from their forge. Later, an elderly man named Skult gives them a banner to unite the Norse clans. However, the Norsemen are instead enraged, and the heroes are forced to defeat their chieftains in combat. The flag turns out to be the banner of the evil giant Folstag and the plan a trick by Skult, who is actually the god Loki in disguise, another ally of Gargarensis.\n\nWith the help of the valkyrie Reginleif, who sent the Norsemen to Egypt, the heroes locate Gargarensis and the Tartarus gate. Inside the Norse underworld Niflheim, they are pursued by fire giants until Chiron sacrifices himself to hold them off, saving his friends. While Gargarensis is trying to knock down the gate, Brokk and Eitri have been rebuilding Thor's hammer (shattered by Loki), that upon completion seals the gate. Back on the surface, they confront Gargarensis with the help of Odysseus, who has made a detour to help them, and the cyclops is captured and beheaded.\n\nArkantos sails back to Atlantis. When he brings out Gargarensis's head to tie it to the mast in victory, he finds the head is actually Kemsyt's, another trick by Loki. Gargarensis is still alive and is trying to break the final gate holding Kronos, which is located at the centre of Atlantis. Gargarensis has captured and fortified Atlantis, and Poseidon himself has possessed a statue in the city center to protect him. Arkantos builds a wonder to Zeus and gains his blessing, giving him god-like power and enabling him to confront Gargarensis and the living statue at the temple of Poseidon. With his new powers, Arkantos defeats the statue, and Gargarensis is impaled by its trident as it collapses. All of Atlantis then collapses into the ocean, along with Arkantos. While the remaining heroes sail away with the surviving Atlanteans, Athena revives Arkantos and rewards him by making him a god.\n\nAn official campaign, \"The Golden Gift\", was released as a download on Microsoft's website. The campaign follows the adventures of Brokk and Eitri, the dwarves who appeared in the initial campaign. The plot unfolds with both dwarves planning to create a giant golden boar as an offering to the Norse god Freyr. While working separately, Brokk is approached by Skult (also from \"Fall of the Trident\") who warns him that Eitri is making preparations to create the boar without his brother, of which Eitri is also told the same about Brokk. As both brothers race to complete the boar in the great forge, Skult steals the finished piece and holds it in Loki's fortress. The brothers eventually assault the base, and the boar is retrieved and successfully offered to Freyr.\n\nEnsemble Studios began work on their first fully 3D engine at the same time as their development of \"\". Named the BANG! Engine, this was announced in January 2001, for use in a new game, codenamed \"RTSIII\". \"RTSIII\" was eventually revealed as \"Age of Mythology\". In developing \"Age of Mythology\", Ensemble Studios decided to move away from the center of the \"Age of Empires\" series history, to avoid becoming stale and repetitive. This allowed them to work with new ideas and concepts.\n\nFollowing the announcement of the game for September 2002, a trial version was released. It contained five scenarios of the game's campaign, and two random maps. In the trial version, the player can only select Zeus, but there are nine gods available in the full version of the game. There was debate during \"Age of Mythology\"s construction concerning the unbalanced nature of god powers and how to make them \"fair\" while still maintaining an element of fun in them. It was concluded that the best way to make it fair for everyone was to limit the use of god powers to one a game. \"Age of Mythology\" underwent a large amount of beta-testing during its developmental phase, as Ensemble Studios attempted to create a more balanced and competitive game than its predecessors. Greg T. Street commented that one of the reasons \"Age of Mythology\" became so popular was because the development team spent many hours working on the game through active testing, rather than just taking advice from a \"faceless drone in another building\".\n\nThe official soundtrack was released on October 22, 2002, under the record label \"Sumthing Else\". The score was written by Stephen Rippy and Kevin McMullan. Rippy cites musicians such as Peter Gabriel, Tuatara, Bill Laswell, Talvin Singh and Tchad Blake as inspirations for the soundtrack. The musical work done on \"Age of Mythology\" was unlike anything Rippy had done before; an example of this was \"writing for a seventy-piece orchestra and then flying out to Washington to record it\".\n\nMusic 4 Games' reviewer, Jay Semerad, heaped \"Age of Mythology\"s soundtrack with praise. He summarized his review by declaring: \"In all, the Age of Mythology soundtrack is an experience that should not be missed. It's easily one of my favorite soundtracks from this past year.\" Semerad was also astonished, and appreciative, of the use of instruments such as the ney flute, tabla and toy piano, all of which he said produced \"some innovative analog and synthesized electronic effects\". His only critique was that at times some of the background melodies were \"bound to a simple harmonization\", and lacking any \"real bold or innovative purpose\".\n\n\"Age of Mythology: The Titans\" is an expansion to \"Age of Mythology\", released on September 30, 2003. The expansion added a new culture, the Atlanteans, as well as several new units, including titans. Critics and fans received the expansion with enthusiasm, although its ratings were slightly lower on average than those of the original version.\n\n\"Age of Empires: Mythologies\" is a spin-off of \"\", but with the unique mythology-based gameplay elements of \"Age of Mythology\". It was developed by Griptonite Games for the Nintendo DS.\n\n\"Age of Mythology: Extended Edition\" is a compilation that includes the main game and \"The Titans\" expansion. It adds Steamworks integration, Twitch support, an enhanced observer mode, native HD widescreen and improved water and lighting. It was released on May 8, 2014. The Extended Edition was developed by SkyBox Labs.\n\nOn September 18, 2015, a new expansion was announced, \"Tale of the Dragon\". It was co-developed by SkyBox Labs and Forgotten Empires, the latter having worked on new expansions for \"Age of Empires II\". The expansion added a new culture, the Chinese, with the major gods Fuxi, Nüwa, and Shennong. The expansion also features a new campaign and multiplayer maps, as well as other features. It was released on January 28, 2016.\n\nIn the United States, \"Age of Mythology\" sold 870,000 copies and earned $31.9 million by August 2006, after its release in October 2002. It was the country's 10th best-selling computer game between January 2000 and August 2006. Combined sales of the game and its \"Titans\" expansion had reached 1.3 million units in the United States by August 2006. \"Age of Mythology\" received a \"Gold\" sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 200,000 copies in the United Kingdom.\n\n\"Age of Mythology\" received critical acclaim, reaching an estimated one million units sold within five months of its release. The game was nominated for the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences' Interactive Achievement Awards for Computer Game of the Year and strategy computer game of the year.\n\n\"Age of Mythology\"s graphics were praised by the majority of reviewers. IGN reviewer Steve Butts stated that \"some fantastic effects and believable animations make this one a joy to watch. The differences between the armies and environments are awesome.\" As such, he gave the graphics a rating of 9 out of 10. Meanwhile, GameSpot reviewer Greg Kasavin also rated the graphics 9 out of 10, stating that \"\"Age of Mythology\" is a great-looking game, filled with bright colors and carefully detailed animations.\" Game Revolution also appreciated \"Age of Mythology\"s graphics, stating in their review that the \"new 3D landscape looks good\", and including graphics as one of the positives in the review summary. PC Gamer reviewer William Harms admired the graphics, \"The environments, units, and buildings are packed with detail,\" and excitedly commented on the effects: \"What really impressed me, though, were the game's animations. When a Minotaur smacks a dude with his club, the schmoe goes flying, skids on the ground, and then bounces back into the air.\"\n\nThe game's soundtrack was also praised by reviewers, although several commented that it was repetitive and predictable at times. IGN described it as \"great, if repetitive, music\", whilst Game Revolution declared that the sound \"really showcases Ensemble's continued attention to detail\", before going on to praise the audio snippets in various languages.\n\nIGN was pleased with \"Age of Mythology\"s campaign, and not bothered by its length. Instead, they stated that \"the meaningful and engaging single player campaign provides a nearly flawless experience.\" However, GameSpot was slightly critical of it, claiming that \"while some of the campaign missions do feature some unusual circumstances or objectives that change, the game's story isn't incredibly engaging.\" This was compromised by stating that \"Age of Empires\" fans wouldn't expect an amazing campaign; they would \"make a beeline for the game's random map mode, anyway.\" PC Gamer elaborated more on the campaign however, saying: \"many of the missions are extremely well-crafted\", and that \"sprinkled throughout these encounters are moments of genuine comedy — a truly delightful surprise.\" However, they still found reasons to criticize: \"Regrettably, most of \"AoM\"s missions suffer from one recurring, frustrating problem: a severe case of 'build base-itis.'\" The reviewer elaborated: \"I know base-building is inherent to the genre, but even the most ardent fan will be put off by just how much there is. What's most disappointing is that \"AoM\"s setting really lends itself to imaginative mission design — and I don't think the designers took full advantage of the backdrop, which is a shame.\"\n\nThe editors of \"Computer Games Magazine\" named \"Age of Mythology\" the fourth-best computer game of 2002, and called it \"an amazingly well-balanced game, both in terms of its pacing and its mix of standard historical and fantastical units\". It was a nominee for \"PC Gamer US\"s \"2002 Best Real-Time Strategy Game\" award, which ultimately went to \"\".\n\n\"Age of Mythology\"s artificial intelligence (AI) was used by four Austrian researchers—Christoph Hermann, Helmuth Melcher, Stefan Rank and Robert Trappl—in a study into the value of emotions in real-time strategy games. According to the abstract, \"We were interested whether incorporating a simple emotional model to an existing bot-script improves playing strength.\" The results of the study determined that of the four bots they tested, the neurotic bot was most capable of defeating \"Age of Mythology\"s default AI, followed by the aggressive one. Neither bot was defeated by the standard AI, but the neurotic bot won, on average, twenty five percent more rapidly. Plans were made to extend the research in the future by pitting the neurotic bot against a human player.\n\n\n"}

He is also the creator and showrunner of the critically acclaimed anthology series \"American Crime\". His most recent work is the documentary film \"\". \n\nRidley was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and was raised from the age of seven in Mequon, Wisconsin, with an ophthalmologist father, John Ridley, III, and a mother, Terry Ridley, who was a special education teacher for Milwaukee Public Schools. He has two sisters and is the middle sibling.\n\nRidley graduated from Homestead High School in Mequon, Wisconsin in 1982. He enrolled in Indiana University but transferred to New York University. There, he graduated with a bachelor's degree in East Asian languages. The subject wasn't applicable to his career, but it sparked his intellectual interests. Ridley is Christian.\n\nFollowing college, Ridley spent a year living and traveling in Japan. Then, he returned to New York and began performing standup comedy in New York City, and he made appearances on \"Late Night with David Letterman\" and \"The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson\". Moving to Los Angeles in 1990, he began writing for such television sitcoms as \"Martin\", \"The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air\", and \"The John Larroquette Show\".\n\nAfter both writing and directing his film debut, the 1997 crime thriller \"Cold Around the Heart\", he and Oliver Stone co-adapted Ridley's first novel, \"Stray Dogs\" (still unpublished when Stone bought the rights) into the 1997 Stone-directed film \"U Turn\", which was released slightly earlier than \"Cold Around the Heart\". Ridley went on to write the novels \"Love Is a Racket\" and \"Everybody Smokes in Hell\". His novel \"Spoils of War\" was adapted into the 1999 David O. Russell-directed \"Three Kings\". Ridley's original script was rewritten by Russell and Ridley, with Ridley receiving a \"story by\" credit negotiated among himself, Russell, and the releasing studio, Warner Bros. Ridley then became a writer and a supervising producer on the NBC crime drama \"Third Watch\". His other novels are \"The Drift\", \"Those Who Walk in Darkness\", and \"A Conversation with the Mann\". He also wrote the graphic novel \"The American Way\".\n\nFrom 2000 to 2010, he was a commentator and blogger for NPR. His blog was \"Visible Man\", a play on Ralph Ellison's \"Invisible Man\".\n\nHis work as screenwriter also includes \"12 Years a Slave\", \"Red Tails\", and \"Undercover Brother.\" His script for \"12 Years a Slave\" won the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay, making Ridley the second African American to win the award, after Geoffrey S. Fletcher (for \"Precious\", based on the novel \"Push\" by Sapphire).\n\n, he was developing an ABC television series involving an existing Marvel Comics character.\n\nOn April 16, 2018, it was announced that Ridley would direct and write an adaptation of his graphic novel \"The American Way\" produced by Blumhouse Productions.\n\nOn June 4, 2018, it was announced that Ridley would direct a feature film adaptation of the Robert Silverberg short story, \"Needle in a Timestack\" produced by Bron Studios. The film will feature performances from Leslie Odom Jr., Freida Pinto, Cynthia Erivo, and Orlando Bloom.\n\nIn December 2007, during the Writers Guild of America strike against the major production studios, Ridley opted for WGA membership as a dues-paying non-member, or \"fi-core,\" making him eligible to submit scripts to the studios while the strike was ongoing. In an op-ed published in the \"Los Angeles Times\", Ridley expressed his frustration at the direction the strike had taken and the WGA's crushing of internal dissent: \"After 15 years of being told shut up, sit down and be part of the groupthink, I decided I did not belong in the guild. The guild has a way to option out. I took the option.\" The guild later retaliated by making his screenplay for \"12 Years a Slave\" ineligible for a WGA Award.\n\n\n\n\n\nRidley is married to wife Gayle, a former script supervisor.

{"id": "1794731", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1794731", "title": "Regine Hildebrandt", "text": "Regine Hildebrandt\n\nRegine Hildebrandt (née Radischewski; 26 April 1941 – 26 November 2001) was a German biologist and politician (Social Democratic Party of Germany).\n\nRegine Radischewski was born in Berlin during the war, the second of her parents' two recorded children. Her father was a pianist who worked as an accompanist at the National Ballet Academy.\n\nHer mother would later own a small tobacconist shop. When she was two the family were evacuated from central Berlin to countryside far to the east of Germany, and shortly after that they were bombed out, losing most of their material possessions.\nThe war ended in May 1945 and the family ended up back in Berlin. For the first five or six years of her schooling she attended a school in a western occupation zone of the city (\"West Berlin\"), but as the political division between the Soviet occupation zone and the western occupation zones became more stark and, it seemed, more permanent, her parents opted on her behalf for a school in the Soviet zone in what had by now become known as East Berlin. The family home was in the city centre along Bernauer Straße (\"\"Bernau Street\"\") which formed the (initially hard to spot) political border between East Berlin and West Berlin, and afforded Regine a ring-side seat in the cold wall drama until September 1961 when the family were forcibly relocated in connection with the building of the Berlin Wall. In October 1961 she co-founded and joined the at Berlin's (Protestant) Cathedral, which now flourished under the musical direction of a man called Herbert Hildebrand.\n\nFrom 1959-64, she studied biology at the Humboldt University in East Berlin.\n\nShe had never joined the Free German Youth (FDJ/\"Freie Deutsche Jugend\"), which was in effect the youth wing of the young country's ruling SED party. Her failure to join seems to have been a result of timetable clashes involving her commitment to singing in the church choir. Failure to enroll in the FDJ had nevertheless led to her application for the university course to be initially rejected; and subsequent failure as an adult to become a Party Member would constrain her career opportunities right up until 1989.\n\nBetween 1964 and 1978 Regine Radischewski worked in a management position involving Quality Control in the pharmacology department of VEB , a major conglomerate in East Berlin. Hildebrandt combined her responsibilities in the pharmaceuticals department with a medicines research project at the Humboldt University which led to her receiving her doctorate in 1978. In 1978 she took a senior research position at Berlin's Centre for the Study of Metabolism Illnesses and Diabetes, heading up the Diabetes department until 1990. During this period she had numerous research papers published.\n\nDuring these years she also found time, in 1966 to marry , brother of the musical director of the choir in which they sang. The two had known each other through the church since 1950: they had also been near neighbours, with a shared childhood experience of living along the East–West front-line before 1961. The marriage produced three children, born in 1969, 1971 and 1974. Her research career left her with enough space to devote time to the family, which was very important to her. Her husband later recalled that they ate together each evening six days per week, and on Sundays had a family lunch in the middle of the day after getting back from church. When she died, aged 60, she would still be living with younger family members in a large \"multi-generational family house\" they had been able to have built after 1990.\n\nThe family participated the political life of the one-party dictatorship only when they felt they had to. They did not vote in the country's sham elections because §22 of the constitution did not oblige them to vote (although the resulted, typically, in a reported turnout of 99.74%). Regine Hildebrand did join the national Trade Union Federation (FDGB/\"Freier Deutscher Gewerkschaftsbund\") because not to have done so would have deprived her research colleagues of vital funding. When fraternal tanks appeared on the streets of Prague to crush political reform, the Hildebrandts joined in a protest demonstration outside the Czechoslovak embassy in Berlin.\n\nThey would write letters of protest to the Party Central Committee and to Neues Deutschland, the party's mass-circulation official daily newspaper. Hildebrand assiduously read Neues Deutschland and followed other official media, if only to keep herself up to date with The Party's politically correct linguistic contrivances of the moment. The family never owned a television set, but news came from radio programmes broadcast from West Berlin or London, and from friends who visited from the west and were permitted (unlike East German citizens) to return to the west afterwards.\n\nThe summer of 1989 brought a dramatic change in her life when she, together with her husband, Jörg, was among the co-founders of Democracy Now, which sought an alliance of Christians and critical Marxists \"to think about our future, to think about a society based on solidarity\". \n\nOn 12 October 1989 she joined the Social Democratic Party (SPD) which (in East Germany) had been re-founded five days earlier. The Hildebrandts valued the embracing compassionate socialism of the moderate left which had been nurtured and demonstrated by iconic (western) SPD figures from the recent past such as Kurt Schumacher and Willy Brandt. A year later, following reunification, in October 1990 the party would merge formally with the West German Social Democratic Party (SDP).\n\n1990 was the year in which, for rather less than a year, she became an important Social Democratic participant in the national politics of the German Democratic Republic (GDR). National elections in the GDR had traditionally operated according to a single list system which offered the voters only one list of (carefully preselected) candidates. Anyone wishing to vote against the list could do so by placing the ballot paper in a separate ballot box while the officials looked on: few did. But on 18 March 1990 the German Democratic Republic conducted its first (and as matters turned out, last) democratically configured general election. The Social Democrats took 21.9% of the vote which entitled them to 88 seats in the country's first freely elected National legislative assembly (\"Volkskammer\"). One of the seats went to Hildebrand, representing the Berlin electoral district. She also joined the coalition government of Lothar de Maizière, serving between April and August 1990 as the East German Minister for Labour and Social Affairs.\n\nA political decision had been taken to convert East German currency into western Marks at a one-for one rate (except in respect of very large amounts), and Hildebrandt's priority as a government minister was tackling growing unemployment in east Germany, following economic disruption associated with the ongoing reunification process.\n\nThe governing coalition started to splinter in August 1990 leading to the withdrawal of the Social Democrats from it, as a result of which Regine Hildebrandt terminated her career as a government minister at the national level. The next month, however, in 1990 she was elected to the national committee of the SPD (for the whole of Germany, even though national reunification would not be formally enacted till October).\n\nHildebrandt now became a key SPD figure in the state politics of Brandenburg. In October 1990, the state tier of government was reintroduced to what had been the German Democratic Republic, and as part of the process elections took place for a new state parliament in Brandenburg on 26 October. Hildebrandt and then appointed to under minister-president Manfred Stolpe: from 1 November 1990 onwards she served as Brandenburg's Minister for Labour, Social affairs, Health and Women, in effect an expanded version of the ministerial portfolio she had been handling nationally earlier in the year.\n\nShe was a popular and effective minister, often hitting the headlines with less than diplomatic outbursts, always charmingly reasonable but also forcefully persuasive with key colleagues when, as often happened, issues within her ministerial ambit came down to arguments about funding. In the popular media she frequently attracted the soubriquet \"Mother Courage\".\n\nIn the 1999 Brandenburg state election the Social Democrats lost their absolute majority and minister-president Manfred Stolpe prepared to form a \"grand coalition\" with the centre-right CDU party. Hildebrand was already seriously ill and had strongly campaigned for an alternative alliance, with the left-wing PDS. She resigned from the state government.\n\nThe Hildebrandts and the state prime minister Manfred Stolpe had known one another since the 1960s through their church connections, though they had not been aware at every level of Stolpe's complicated and possibly at times collaborative relationship with the Ministry for State Security during the years of the dictatorship. After her resignation from the government Hildebrand and Stolpe would continue to treasure one another's friendship, and remain political allies, until Hildebrandt's death in 2001.\n\nNationally in December 1999 and again in November 2001, a few weeks before she died, Hildebrand topped the polls in the elections to the of the Social Democratic Party.\n\nIn July 1996 it became known that Regine Hildebrandt had breast cancer. She died at age 60 on 26 November 2001 in Woltersdorf, Brandenburg.\n\n"}

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a Grade II* listed building, having been designated on 25 February 1952, and has been described as \"the most refined little building in Manchester\".\n\nThe library was established as a result of a meeting of Manchester businessmen in 1802 which resolved to found an \"\"institute uniting the advantages of a newsroom and a library\"\". A visit by four of the men to the Athenaeum in Liverpool inspired them to achieve a similar institution in Manchester. Money was raised through 400 subscriptions from Manchester men and the library opened in 1806.\n\nThe library, mainly focused on 19th-century literature, was designed by Thomas Harrison, architect of Liverpool's Lyceum and built by one of the founders, David Bellhouse. Its first secretary, Peter Mark Roget, began his thesaurus here.\n\nToday the ground floor is tenanted by \"The Bank\", a public house that takes its name from the Bank of Athens that leased the property in 1921. The library occupies what became the first floor with its entrance on Charlotte Street.\n\nThe library, was the first Greek Revival building in the city. Its interior was inspired by John Soane. The library has a rectangular plan and is constructed in sandstone ashlar on a corner site at 57 Mosley Street. It has two storeys and a basement and roof space. Its facade on Mosley Street has a three-bay pedimented loggia with four Ionic columns set slightly forward and steps between the columns. Under the loggia are two entrance doors and three square windows at first floor level.\n\nThe Charlotte Street facade has an entrance into the loggia with a square window above and another on the first floor. A five-bay colonnade of Ionic semi-columns has tall sashed windows on the ground floor in each bay and square window above at first floor level. The attic storey is behind a pilastered parapet. Originally the reading room was on the ground floor and the library occupied the remainder of the ground floor and a mezzanine gallery. A glass-domed ceiling was inserted at gallery level in about 1920 to separate the new tenants from what remained of the library.\n\nThe Portico Library, in conjunction with its cultural partners and funders, hosts a series of literary prizes throughout the year to celebrate writers and poets from Northern England and beyond. The Portico Prize for Literature was established in 1985 and awarded biennially to a work of fiction or poetry and a work of non-fiction set wholly or mainly in the north of England. The library launched the Sadie Massey Award to celebrate the North West's young writers in 2015.\n\nThe library's first chairman was John Ferriar and its secretary was Peter Mark Roget. Other notable members include John Dalton, Reverend William Gaskell, Sir Robert Peel and more recently Eric Cantona.\n\n"}

Over his more than 40-year career, he appeared in more than nine hundred productions on stage and screen.\n\nBorn in Dade City in Pasco County, near Tampa, Florida, Roberts began his acting career on the stage, first appearing on Broadway in May 1931 before making his motion picture debut in \"Gold Bricks\", a 1936 two-reel comedy short released by 20th Century-Fox. He appeared in numerous films in secondary parts and returned to perform on Broadway in such productions as \"Twentieth Century\", \"My Sister Eileen\", and \"Carnival in Flanders\" until he began making guest appearances on television series. After appearing on Gale Storm's \"My Little Margie\" in 1956, he became part of several television series for which he is best remembered. In a show that was the precursor to \"The Love Boat\", Roberts played the ship's captain for four years in Storm's next hit, \"Oh! Susanna\", which aired on CBS and ABC from 1956 to 1960. He guest-starred in scores of series, including the western-themed crime drama, \"Sheriff of Cochise\", the western series, \"My Friend Flicka\", \"The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp\" (as Texas cattle baron Shanghai Pierce), and \"The Travels of Jaimie McPheeters\", and Brian Keith's Cold War drama, \"Crusader\". Roberts appeared on four episodes of the CBS legal drama, \"Perry Mason\", including the role of murderer Arthur Janeel in the 1961 episode, \"The Case of the Malicious Mariner.\" \n\nDuring the middle 1960s, Roberts was one of the most recognizable faces on television, and had recurring roles concurrently on a number of popular programs, including:\n\n\nIn the 1940s and 1950s, Roberts was a regular in many films noir, including \"Force of Evil\" (1948), \"He Walked by Night\" (1948), \"Nightmare Alley\" (1947), \"The Brasher Doubloon\" (1947), \"Borderline\" (1950) and \"The Enforcer\" (1951). In 1953, he appeared as Vincent Price's character's crooked business partner (and first victim) in \"House of Wax\". In 1956 he was Colonel Sam Sherman in \"The First Texan\". In 1962 Roberts appeared as John Kemper on the TV western \"Lawman\" in the episode titled \"Heritage of Hate.\" \n\nHe also appeared in the neo-noirs \"The Outfit\" (1973) and \"Chinatown\" (1974). He also had a small role in the hit 1963 Stanley Kramer comedy, \"It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World\" as a police officer. Unfortunately, his role was cut from later television and movie versions to reduce running time. However, because of an interest in restoring \"IAMMMMW\" to its original length, Roberts' brief role has seen life again in versions made for laserdisc and extended-length DVDs.\n\nRoberts appeared in an episode of the situation comedy \"A Touch of Grace\" in 1973. His last television appearance was on the 21 January 1974 CBS broadcast of \"Here's Lucy\". In that installment, \"Lucy Is N.G. As An R.N.\", Roberts played a veterinarian.\n\nRoberts died in Los Angeles, California, of a heart attack on 28 May 1975 and was interred at Greenwood Memorial Park in Fort Worth, Texas.\n\n"}

It offers a Juris Doctor and three Master of Laws programs, including one that is exclusively online, as well as a combined J.D./M.B.A. with San Diego State University.\n\nThe school is not approved by the American Bar Association (ABA), following the ABA's withdrawal of approval in December 2019. However, it is currently approved by the California State Bar’s Committee of Bar Examiners. As a result, graduates are generally not able to take the bar or practice law outside of California.\n\nThe Thomas Jefferson School of Law was founded in 1969 as the San Diego campus of the Western State University College of Law and operated as such until 1995, when it became independent. It joined the Association of American Law Schools in 2008. In January 2011, TJSL moved to a new, building located in the East Village district of downtown San Diego. In 2018, the school announced it would vacate its building as a cost-cutting measure, moving into an office building in downtown San Diego.\n\nTJSL received approval from the American Bar Association (ABA) in 1996. The ABA revoked the school's accreditation on June 10, 2019. This followed a public censure by the ABA in 2018 and a 2017 decision to place the school on probation for being out of compliance with the ABA requirement that schools admit only students who appear capable of earning a J.D. degree and passing the bar examination. In October 2018, TJSL became a California state accredited school, allowing its students to take the California Bar Exam.\n\nThe program offers Master of Laws (LL.M.), Master of Science of Law (M.S.L) and JSD \"Doctor of Laws or Juridical Science\" degrees. Certificate Programs in International Financial Centers, United States Taxation, E-commerce, Anti-Money Laundering & Compliance, and Trusts and Estate Planning are available. Faculty for the program are generally part-time and populated with industry professionals. Students begin classes in August, attend the three-year, full-time program or the four-year, part-time program, and can accelerate graduation one semester by taking additional classes during the summer. Day and evening classes are offered.\n\nThe July 2019 California bar pass rate for TJSL graduates was 22% for first time takers and 18% for repeat takers, vs. statewide averages of 71% and 36%, respectively.\n\nThe ranking of the School of Law by \"U.S. News & World Report\" is not published, as U.S. News does not publish the ranking of schools that fall below 145.

Law School Transparency estimated debt-financed cost of attendance for three years at $297,652.\n\nAccording to \"U.S. News & World Report\", the average indebtedness of 2018 graduates who incurred law school debt was $196,607 (not including undergraduate debt), and 92% of 2018 graduates took on debt. The average indebtedness of graduates who incurred law school debt is second-highest among US law schools. The school's Associate Dean for Student Affairs has attributed the average debt level to the school's admittance of immigrants and those who are the first in their family to attend law school—people who are statistically more likely to lack individual or family resources.\n\nAccording to Thomas Jefferson School of Law's official 2018 ABA-required disclosures, 19% of the Class of 2018 obtained full-time, long-term, JD-required employment nine months after graduation.\n\nIn 2013, the National Law Journal reported the college has the worst unemployment rate after graduation (31.5%) amongst all law schools in the country.\n\nIn January 2011, a \"New York Times\" article about the inability of many recent law school graduates to get jobs discussed Thomas Jefferson's claim that 92% of the class of 2009 was employed within nine months of graduation. The school's claim was based on a survey of the class of 2009. (Under ABA rules, 25% of graduates who do not participate in employment surveys are counted as employed.). The Wall Street Journal also ran a story in June 2012 listing TJSL as one of the 'bottom five' schools for 2011 graduate employment.\n\nIn May 2011, Anna Alaburda filed a class-action lawsuit against her alma mater, alleging that the law school had committed fraud by publishing deceptive post-graduation employment statistics and salary data in order to bait new students into enrolling. Alaburda, a 2008 honors graduate, claimed that despite having graduated at the top of her class and passed the California bar exam, she was unable to find suitable legal employment, and had racked up more than $150,000 in student loan debt. This is the first time a law school would stand trial for allegedly inflating its employment statistics. The jury found in favor of TJSL with a 9–3 verdict.\n\nSince Fall 2012, TJSL has operated a lawyer incubator program called the Center for Solo Practitioners. The incubator provides space and support for selected alumni who are going into solo practice. It is also intended to help serve under-represented communities.\n\nAt the 2013 annual meeting of the American Bar Association, the Center for Solo Practitioners was honored with an ABA award in recognition of \"successful implementation of a project or program specifically targeted to solo and small-firm lawyers.\"\n\nIn 2009, TJSL initiated an Intellectual Property Fellowship Program for students with undergraduate or advanced degrees in the hard sciences or engineering. The TJSL Center for Law and Intellectual Property has course offerings in copyright, patent, trademark and unfair competition law as well as cyberspace law, biotechnology law and bioethics, telecommunications and media law, and sports and entertainment law.\n\nThe Center for Global Legal Studies offers a specialized program in international law.\n\nThe Center for Law and Social Justice is a research and teaching program in areas of public policy and law in its field.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1794747", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1794747", "title": "Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street", "text": "Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street\n\nSweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (often referred to simply as Sweeney Todd) is a 1979 musical with music and lyrics by Stephen Sondheim and a book by Hugh Wheeler. It is based on the 1973 play of the same name by Christopher Bond.\n\n\"Sweeney Todd\" opened on Broadway in 1979 and in the West End in 1980. It won the Tony Award for Best Musical and Olivier Award for Best New Musical. It has since had numerous revivals as well as a .\n\nThe character of Sweeney Todd had its origins in serialized Victorian popular fiction, known as \"penny dreadfuls\". A story called \"The String of Pearls\" was published in a weekly magazine during the winter of 1846–47. Set in 1785, the story featured as its principal villain a certain Sweeney Todd and included all the plot elements that were used by Sondheim and others ever since. The murderous barber’s story proved instantly popular – it was turned into a play before the ending had even been revealed in print. An expanded edition appeared in 1850, an American version in 1852, a new play in 1865. By the 1870s, Sweeney Todd was a familiar character to most Victorians.\n\nSondheim’s musical was, in fact, based on Christopher Bond’s 1973 spooky melodrama, which introduced a psychological background to Todd’s crimes. In Bond's reincarnation of the character, Todd was the victim of a ruthless judge who raped his young wife and exiled him to Australia. Sondheim first conceived of a musical version of the story in 1973, after he went to see Bond's ghoulish take on the story at Theatre Royal Stratford East.\n\nBond's sophisticated plot and language significantly elevated the lurid nature of the tale. Sondheim once noted, “It had a weight to it . . . because [Bond] wrote certain characters in blank verse. He also infused into it plot elements from Jacobean tragedy and \"The Count of Monte Cristo\". He was able to take all these disparate elements that had been in existence rather dully for a hundred and some-odd years and make them into a first-rate play.”\n\nSondheim felt that the addition of music would greatly increase the size of the drama, transforming it into a different theatrical experience, saying later:What I did to Chris' play is more than enhance it. I had a feeling it would be a new animal. The effect it had at Stratford East in London and the effect it had at the Uris Theater in New York are two entirely different effects, even though it's the same play. It was essentially charming over there because they don't take Sweeney Todd seriously. Our production was larger in scope. Hal Prince gave it an epic sense, a sense that this was a man of some size instead of just a nut case. The music helps to give it that dimension.Music proved to be a key element behind the impact of \"Sweeney Todd\" on audiences. Over eighty percent of the production is set to music, either sung or underscoring dialogue. The score is one vast structure, each individual part meshing with others for the good of the entire musical machine. Never before or since in his work has Sondheim utilized music in such an exhaustive capacity to further the purposes of the drama.\n\nSondheim decided to pair one of the most nightmarish songs (Sweeney Todd's \"Epiphany\") with the comic-relief of \"A Little Priest\". This pair of songs at the end of Act I was the most significant musical addition which Sondheim made to Bond’s version of the story. In the play, Sweeney Todd’s mental collapse and the subsequent plan for Lovett's meat pies take place in less than half a page of dialogue, much too quickly to convey the full psychological impact, in the view of scholar Larry A. Brown. Sondheim's version more carefully reveals the developing ideas in Sweeney Todd and Mrs. Lovett's demented minds.\n\nSondheim has often said that his \"Sweeney Todd\" was about obsession – and close friends seemed to instinctually agree. When Sondheim first played songs from an early version of the show for Judy Prince (wife of the show's director), she told him: \"Oh God – I didn't know this was what [\"Sweeney Todd\"] was about. It's nothing to do with Grand Guignol. It's the story of your [own] life.\"\n\nWhen Sondheim first brought the idea for the show to director Harold Prince, his frequent collaborator, Prince was uninterested, feeling it was a simple melodrama that wasn't very experimental structurally. However, Prince soon discovered a metaphor in which to set the show, making what Sondheim had originally envisioned as \"a small horror piece\" into a colossal portrait of the Industrial Revolution, and an examination of the general human condition of the time as it related to men like Sweeney Todd. Said Sondheim, \"Hal's metaphor is that the factory turns out Sweeney Todds. It turns out soulless, defeated, hopeless people. That's what the play's about to him; Sweeney Todd is a product of that age. I think it's not. Sweeney Todd is a man bent on personal revenge, the way we all are in one way or another, and it has nothing whatsoever to do with the time he lived in, as far as I'm concerned.” However, Sondheim accepted Prince's vision as a different way to do the show, and as an opportunity to do the show on a large scale, knowing that small-scale productions could be done at any time. \n\nOn the stage of the Uris Theater in New York, this tale of horrors was transformed into a mountain of steel in motion. Prince's scenic metaphor for \"Sweeney Todd\" was a 19th-century iron foundry moved from Rhode Island and reassembled on the stage, which critic Jack Kroll aptly described as \"part cathedral, part factory, part prison, that dwarfed and degraded the swarming denizens of the lower orders.\"\n\nWhen it came to casting, Sondheim thought stage veteran Angela Lansbury would add some needed comedy to the grim tale as the lunatic Cockney shopkeeper, but Lansbury needed to be convinced. She was a star by the late 1970s, and, as she pointed out to Sondheim, \"Your show is not called 'Nellie Lovett', it's called 'Sweeney Todd'. And I'm the second banana.\" To convince her, Sondheim \"auditioned,\" writing a couple of songs for her, including the macabre patter song, \"A Little Priest.\" And he gave her the key to the character, saying \"I want Mrs. Lovett to have a music hall character.\" Lansbury, who had grown up in British music hall, immediately got it. \"Not just music hall ... but dotty music hall\", as she put it. After she was formally confirmed in the role, she relished the opportunity, saying that she loved \"the extraordinary wit and intelligence of [Sondheim's] lyrics.\"\n\nCanadian actor and singer Len Cariou was Sondheim's personal choice to play the tortured barber. In preparation for the role, Cariou (who was studying with a voice teacher at the time) asked Sondheim what kind of range he needed to have in the role. Cariou told him he was prepared to give Sondheim a couple of octaves to deal with, and Sondheim immediately replied, \"That would be more than sufficient.\"\n\nWith Prince absorbed in staging the mammoth production, Lansbury and Cariou were left largely to their own when it came to developing their characters. They worked together on all their scenes, both of them creative actors who were experienced in giving intense performances. \"That cuckoo style of playing Mrs. Lovett, that was pretty much Angela ... She invented that character\", Cariou said. She recalled, \"I just ran with it. The wide-openness of my portrayal had to do with my sink or swim attitude toward it. I just figured hell, I've done everything else on Broadway, I might as well go with Mrs. Lovett.\"\n\nIt is said that on opening night Harold Clurman, the doyen of American theatre critics, rushed up to Schuyler Chapin, former general manager of the Metropolitan Opera, demanding to know why he had not put it on at the Met. To which Chapin replied: \"I would have put it on like a shot if I'd had the opportunity. There would have been screams and yells but I wouldn't have given a damn. Because it is an opera. A modern American opera.\"\n\nThe citizens of London, who act as a Greek chorus throughout the play, drop a body bag and pour ashes into a shallow grave. Sweeney Todd rises forth (\"The Ballad of Sweeney Todd\"), and introduces the drama.\n\nIn 1846, young sailor Anthony Hope and the mysterious Sweeney Todd, whom Anthony has recently rescued at sea and befriended, dock in London. A beggar woman sexually solicits them, appearing to recognize Todd for a moment (\"No Place Like London\"), and Todd shoos her away. Todd obliquely relates some of his troubled past to Anthony: he was a naive barber, \"removed...from his plate\" by a corrupt judge who lusted after Todd's wife (\"The Barber and His Wife\"). Leaving Anthony, Todd enters a meat pie shop on Fleet Street, where the owner, the slatternly widow Mrs. Lovett, laments the scarcity of meat and customers (\"Worst Pies in London\"). When Todd asks after the empty upstairs apartment, she reveals that its former tenant, Benjamin Barker, was transported on false charges by Judge Turpin, who, along with his servant, Beadle Bamford, then lured Barker's wife Lucy to the Judge's home and raped her (\"Poor Thing\").\n\nTodd's reaction reveals that he is himself Benjamin Barker. Promising to keep his secret, Mrs. Lovett explains that Lucy poisoned herself and that their then-infant daughter, Johanna, became the Judge's ward. Todd swears revenge on the Judge and Beadle, and Mrs. Lovett presents Todd with his old collection of sterling silver straight razors, which persuades Todd to take up his old profession (\"My Friends\" and \"The Ballad of Sweeney Todd\" – reprise). Elsewhere, Anthony spies a beautiful girl singing at her window (\"Green Finch and Linnet Bird\"), and the beggar woman tells him that her name is Johanna. Unaware that Johanna is his friend Todd's daughter, Anthony is immediately enamored (\"Ah, Miss\"), and he pledges to return for her, even after the judge and Beadle threaten him and chase him away (\"Johanna\").\n\nIn the crowded London marketplace, flamboyant Italian barber Adolfo Pirelli and his simple-minded young assistant Tobias Ragg pitch a dramatic cure-all for hair loss (\"Pirelli's Miracle Elixir\"). Todd and Lovett soon arrive; as part of his plan to establish his new identity, Todd exposes the elixir as a sham, challenges Pirelli to a shaving competition and easily wins (\"The Contest\"), inviting the impressed Beadle for a free shave (\"The Ballad of Sweeney Todd\" – reprise 2). Several days later, Judge Turpin flagellates himself in a frenzy over a growing lust for Johanna, but instead resolves to marry her himself (\"Johanna – Mea Culpa\").\n\nTodd awaits the Beadle's arrival with mounting impatience, but Mrs. Lovett tries to soothe him (\"Wait\"). When Anthony tells Todd of his plan to ask Johanna to elope with him, Todd, eager to reunite with his daughter, agrees to let them use his barbershop as a safehouse. As Anthony leaves, Pirelli and Tobias enter, and Mrs. Lovett takes Toby downstairs for a pie. Alone with Todd, Pirelli drops his Italian accent and reveals that he is Daniel O'Higgins, Benjamin Barker's former assistant; he knows Todd's true identity and demands half his income for life. Todd overpowers and kills O'Higgins by slitting his throat (\"Pirelli's Death\" and \"The Ballad of Sweeney Todd\" – reprise 3). Meanwhile, Johanna and Anthony plan their elopement (\"Kiss Me\"), while the Beadle recommends Todd's grooming services to the Judge so that the judge may better win Johanna's affections (\"Ladies in Their Sensitivities\").\n\nPanicked at first on learning of Pirelli's murder, Mrs. Lovett swipes his leftover coin purse and then asks Todd how he plans to dispose of the body. Suddenly, the judge enters; Todd quickly seats him and lulls him with a relaxing conversation (\"Pretty Women\"). Before Todd can kill the judge, however, Anthony re-enters and blurts out his elopement plan. The angry judge storms out, vowing never to return and to send Johanna away. Todd drives Anthony out in a fit of fury and, reminded of the evil he sees in London, resolves to depopulate the city by murdering his future customers since all people deserve to die: the rich to be punished for their corruption, and the poor to be relieved of their misery (\"Epiphany\"). While discussing how to dispose of Pirelli's body, Mrs. Lovett is struck by a sudden idea and suggests that they use the bodies of Todd's victims in her meat pies, and Todd happily agrees (\"A Little Priest\").\n\nSeveral weeks later, Mrs. Lovett's pie shop has become a successful business, and Toby works there as a waiter (\"God, That's Good!\"). Todd has acquired a special mechanical barber's chair that allows him to kill clients and then send their bodies directly through a chute into the pie shop's basement bakehouse. Casually slitting his customers' necks, Todd despairs of ever seeing Johanna, while Anthony searches London for her (\"Johanna – Quartet\"). Anthony finds Johanna locked away in a private lunatic asylum, but barely escapes being placed under arrest by the Beadle. After a day of hard work, while Todd remains fixated on his revenge, Mrs. Lovett envisions a seaside retirement (\"By the Sea\"). Anthony arrives to beg Todd for help to free Johanna, and Todd, revitalized, instructs Anthony to rescue her by posing as a wigmaker intent on purchasing inmates' hair (\"Wigmaker Sequence\" and \"The Ballad...\" – reprise 4). However, once Anthony has departed, Todd sends a letter informing the Judge that Anthony will bring Johanna to his shop just after dark, and that he will hand her over (\"The Letter\").\n\nIn the pie shop, Toby tells Mrs. Lovett of his skepticism about Todd and his own desire to protect her (\"Not While I'm Around\"). When he recognizes Pirelli's coin purse in Mrs. Lovett's hands, she distracts him by showing him the bakehouse, instructing him how to work the meat grinder and the oven before locking him in. Upstairs, she encounters the Beadle at her harmonium; he has been asked by Lovett's neighbors to investigate the strange smoke and stench from the pie shop's chimney. Mrs. Lovett stalls the Beadle with \"Parlor Songs\" until Todd returns to offer the Beadle his promised \"free shave\"; Mrs. Lovett loudly plays her harmonium to cover the Beadle's screams above as Todd dispatches him. In the basement, Toby discovers hair and fingernails in a pie he has been eating, just as the Beadle's fresh corpse comes tumbling through the chute. Terrified, he flees into the London sewers below the bakehouse. Mrs. Lovett then informs Todd that Toby has found out about their secret and must be dealt with.\n\nAnthony arrives at the asylum to rescue Johanna, but is exposed when Johanna recognizes him. Anthony draws a pistol given to him by Todd, but cannot bring himself to shoot Jonas Fogg, the corrupt asylum owner; Johanna grabs the pistol and kills Fogg. As Anthony and Johanna flee, the asylum's freed inmates prophesy the end of the world, while Todd and Mrs. Lovett hunt through the sewers for Toby, and the beggar woman fears what has become of the Beadle (\"City on Fire/Searching\"). Anthony and Johanna (now disguised as a sailor) arrive at Todd's empty shop. Anthony leaves to seek a coach after he and Johanna reaffirm their love (\"Ah Miss\" – reprise). Johanna hears the beggar woman entering and hides in a trunk in the barbershop. The beggar woman seems to recognize the room. Todd enters and tries to force her to leave as she again seems to recognize him (\"Beggar Woman's Lullaby\"). Hearing the Judge outside, a frantic Todd kills the beggar woman, sending her body down the chute barely a moment before the Judge bursts in. Todd assures the Judge that Johanna is repentant, and the Judge asks for a quick splash of cologne. Once he has the Judge in his chair, Todd soothes him with another conversation on women, but this time he alludes to their \"fellow tastes, in women at least\". The Judge recognizes him as \"Benjamin Barker!\" just before Todd slashes his throat and sends him hurtling down the chute (\"The Judge's Return\"). Remembering Toby, Todd starts to leave, but, realizing he has left his razor behind, returns just as the disguised Johanna rises, horrified, from the trunk. Not recognizing her, Todd attempts to kill her, just as Mrs. Lovett shrieks from the bakehouse below, providing a distraction for Johanna to escape. Downstairs, Mrs. Lovett is struggling with the dying Judge, who claws at her. She then attempts to drag the beggar woman's body into the oven, but Todd arrives and sees the lifeless face clearly for the first time: the beggar woman is his wife Lucy. Todd is horror-struck, accusing Mrs. Lovett of lying to him. Mrs. Lovett frantically explains that Lucy did indeed poison herself, but she lived, though the attempt left her insane. Mrs. Lovett confesses she loves Todd. Todd then feigns forgiveness, dancing manically with Lovett until hurling her into the raging fires of the oven, burning her alive. Full of despair and in shock, Todd embraces the dead Lucy. Toby, now quite insane, crawls up from the sewer babbling nursery rhymes to himself. He picks up Todd's fallen razor, and slits Todd's throat. As Todd falls dead and Toby drops the razor, Anthony, Johanna and some others break into the bakehouse. Toby, heedless of them, begins turning the meat grinder, crooning Mrs. Lovett's previous instructions to him (\"Final Scene\").\n\nThe ensemble cast, soon joined by the risen Todd and Mrs. Lovett, sing a reprise of \"The Ballad of Sweeney Todd\" warning against revenge (though admitting that \"everyone does it\"). Tearing off their costumes, the company exits. Todd sneers at the audience for a moment and vanishes.\n\n\nNotes on the songs:\n\n\n\nThe original production premiered on Broadway at the Uris Theatre on March 1, 1979 and closed on June 29, 1980 after 557 performances and 19 previews. Directed by Hal Prince and choreographed by Larry Fuller, the scenic design was by Eugene Lee, costumes by Franne Lee and lighting by Ken Billington.

The production was nominated for nine Tony Awards, winning eight including Best Musical. Dorothy Loudon and George Hearn replaced Lansbury and Cariou on March 4, 1980.\n\nThe first national U.S. tour started on October 24, 1980, in Washington, D.C. and ended in August 1981 in Los Angeles, California. Lansbury was joined by Hearn and this version was taped during the Los Angeles engagement and broadcast on The Entertainment Channel (one of the predecessors of today's A&E) on September 12, 1982. This performance would later be repeated on Showtime and PBS (the latter as part of its \"Great Performances\" series); It was later released on home video through Turner Home Entertainment, and on DVD from Warner Home Video. The taped production was nominated for five Primetime Emmy Awards in 1985, winning three including Outstanding Individual Performance in a Variety or Music Program (for George Hearn).\n\nA North American tour started on February 23, 1982, in Wilmington, Delaware, and ended on July 17, 1982, in Toronto, Ontario. June Havoc and Ross Petty starred.\n\nThe first London production opened on July 2, 1980, at the West End's Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, starring Denis Quilley and Sheila Hancock along with Andrew C. Wadsworth as Anthony, Mandy More as Johanna, Michael Staniforth as Tobias, Austin Kent as Judge Turpin, Dilys Watling as the Beggar Woman, David Wheldon-Williams as Beadle Bamford, Oz Clarke as Jonas Fogg, and John Aron as Pirelli. The show ran for 157 performances. Despite receiving mixed reviews, the production won the Olivier Award for Best New Musical in 1980. The production closed on November 14, 1980.\n\nThe first Broadway revival opened on September 14, 1989 at the Circle in the Square Theatre, and closed on February 25, 1990 after 189 performances and 46 previews. It was produced by Theodore Mann, directed by Susan H. Schulman, with choreography by Michael Lichtefeld. The cast featured Bob Gunton (Sweeney Todd), Beth Fowler (Mrs. Lovett), Eddie Korbich (Tobias Ragg), Jim Walton (Anthony Hope) and David Barron (Judge Turpin). In contrast to the original Broadway version, the production was designed on a relatively intimate scale and was affectionately referred to as \"Teeny Todd.\" It was originally produced Off-Broadway by the York Theatre Company at the Church of the Heavenly Rest from March 31, 1989 to April 29, 1989. This production received four Tony Award nominations: for Best Revival of a Musical, Best Actor in a Musical, Best Actress in a Musical and Best Direction of a Musical, but failed to win any.\n\nIn 1993, the show received its first London revival at the Royal National Theatre. The production opened originally at the Cottesloe Theatre on June 2, 1993, and later transferred to the Lyttleton Theatre on December 16, 1993, playing in repertory and closing on June 1, 1994. The show's design was slightly altered to fit a proscenium arch theatre space for the Lyttleton Theatre. The director was Declan Donnellan and the Cottesloe Theatre production starred Alun Armstrong as Todd and Julia McKenzie as Mrs. Lovett, with Adrian Lester as Anthony, Barry James as Beadle Bamford and Denis Quilley (who had originated the title role in the original London production in 1980) as Judge Turpin. When the show transferred, Quilley replaced Armstrong in the title role. Sondheim praised Donnellan for the \"small 'chamber' approach to the show, which was the composer's original vision for the piece.\" This production received Olivier Awards for Best Musical Revival, Best Actor in a Musical (Armstrong) and Best Actress in a Musical (McKenzie), as well as nominations for Best Director and two for Best Supporting Performance in a musical.\n\nIn 2004, John Doyle directed a revival of the musical at the Watermill Theatre in Newbury, England, running from July 27, 2004 until October 9, 2004. This production subsequently transferred to the West End's Trafalgar Studios and then the Ambassadors Theatre. This production was notable for having no orchestra, with the 10-person cast playing the score themselves on musical instruments that they carried onstage. This marked the first time in nearly ten years that a Sondheim show had been presented in the commercial West End. It starred Paul Hegarty as Todd, Karen Mann as Mrs. Lovett, Rebecca Jackson as The Beggar Woman, Sam Kenyon as Tobias, Rebecca Jenkins as Johanna, David Ricardo-Pearce as Anthony and Colin Wakefield as Judge Turpin. This production closed February 5, 2005.\n\nIn spring 2006, the production toured the UK with Jason Donovan as Todd and Harriet Thorpe as Mrs. Lovett.\n\nA version of the John Doyle West End production transferred to Broadway, opening on November 3, 2005 at the Eugene O'Neill Theatre with a new cast, all of whom played their own instruments, as had been done in London. The cast consisted of: Patti LuPone (Mrs. Lovett/Tuba/Percussion), Michael Cerveris (Todd/Guitar), Manoel Felciano (Tobias/Violin/Clarinet/Piano), Alexander Gemignani (Beadle/Piano/Trumpet), Lauren Molina (Johanna/Cello), Benjamin Magnuson (Anthony/Cello/Piano), Mark Jacoby (Turpin/Trumpet/Percussion), Donna Lynne Champlin (Pirelli/Accordion/Flute/Piano), Diana DiMarzio (Beggar Woman/Clarinet) and John Arbo (Fogg/Double bass). The production ran for 349 performances and 35 previews, and was nominated for six Tony Awards, winning two: Best Direction of a Musical for Doyle and Best Orchestrations for Sarah Travis who had reconstructed Jonathan Tunick's original arrangements to suit the ten-person cast and orchestra. Because of the small scale of the musical, it cost $3.5 million to make, a sum small in comparison to many Broadway musicals and recouped in nineteen weeks. A national tour based on Doyle's Broadway production began on August 30, 2007 with Judy Kaye (who had temporarily replaced LuPone in the Broadway run) as Mrs. Lovett and David Hess as Todd. Alexander Gemignani also played the title role for the Toronto run of the tour in November 2007.\n\nMichael Ball and Imelda Staunton starred in a new production of the show that played at The Chichester Festival Theatre, running from September 24 to November 5, 2011. Directed by Jonathan Kent, the cast included Ball as Todd, Staunton as Mrs. Lovett, James McConville as Tobias, John Bowe as Judge Turpin, Robert Burt as Pirelli, Luke Brady as Anthony, Gillian Kirkpatrick as Lucy Barker, Lucy May Barker as Johanna and Peter Polycarpou as Beadle Bamford. It was notably set in the 1930s instead of 1846 and restored the oft-cut song \"Johanna (Mea Culpa)\". The production received positive reviews from both critics and audience members and transferred to the Adelphi Theatre in the West End in 2012 for a limited run from March 10 to September 22, 2012. Comedian Jason Manford made his musical debut as Pirelli from July 2 to 28 and August 15, 18 and 24, 2012 while Robert Burt appeared at Glyndebourne Festival Opera.The West End transfer received six Laurence Olivier Award nominations of which it won the three; Best Musical Revival, Best Actor in a Musical for Ball and Best Actress in a Musical for Staunton.\n\nCameron Mackintosh produced the West End transfer of the Tooting Arts Club production the show which ran at Harrington's Pie Shop in Tooting, London in October and November 2014.

The cast included Jeremy Secomb as Sweeney Todd, Siobhan McCarthy as Mrs. Lovett, Nadim Naaman as Anthony, Ian Mowat as the Beadle, Duncan Smith as the Judge, Kiara Jay as Pirelli and the Beggar Woman, Joseph Taylor as Tobias and Zoe Doano as Johanna.\nThe Tooting Arts Club production transferred to Off-Broadway, transforming the Barrow Street Theatre into a working re-creation of Harrington's pie shop. Previews began February 14, 2017 before officially opening night on March 1. Like the London production, the transfer was directed by Bill Buckhurst, designed by Simon Kenny and produced by Rachel Edwards, Jenny Gersten, Seaview Productions, and Nate Koch, executive producer, in association with Barrow Street Theatre. The opening night cast featured four members of the London cast: Jeremy Secomb as Sweeney Todd, Siobhan McCarthy as Mrs. Lovett, Duncan Smith as the Judge and, Joseph Taylor as Tobias, alongside Brad Oscar as the Beadle, Betsy Morgan as Pirelli and the Beggar Woman, Matt Doyle as Anthony and Alex Finke as Johanna. In April 2017, five of the cast members left the show, replaced by Norm Lewis as Sweeney Todd, Carolee Carmello as Mrs. Lovett, John-Michael Lyles as Tobias, Stacie Bono as The Beggar Woman and Pirelli, and Jamie Jackson as Judge Turpin. After Norm Lewis left, he was replaced by Hugh Panaro in the titular role. Other changes include Michael James Leslie as Judge Turpin. The production was extended and closed on August 26, 2018.\n\nThe State Opera of South Australia presented Australia's first professional production in Adelaide in September 1987.

It was directed by Christopher Ashley with choreography by Daniel Pelzig.\n\nIrish tenor David Shannon starred as Todd in a highly successful Dublin production of the show at the Gate Theatre, which ran from April 2007 through June 2007. The production employed a minimalistic approach: the cast consisted of a small ensemble of 14 performers, and the orchestra was a seven-piece band. The look of the production was quite abstract. \"The Sunday Times\" wrote that \"The black backdrop of David Farley's rough hewn set and the stark minimalism of Rick Fisher's lighting suggest a self-conscious edginess, with Shannon's stylised make-up, long leather coat and brooding countenance only adding to the feeling.\" When a character died, flour was poured over them.\n\nThe 2008 Gothenburg production premiered on May 15, 2008 at The Göteborg Opera. The show was a collaboration with West End International Ltd. The cast featured Michael McCarthy as Sweeney Todd and Rosemary Ashe as Mrs Lovett and David Shannon this time as Anthony.

The cast featured Rod Gilfry and Franco Pomponi (Sweeney Todd) and Caroline O'Connor (Mrs Lovett).\n\nThe Lyric Stage Company of Boston produced a run in September and October 2014 with the company's Artistic Director Spiro Veloudos staging and directing the show. The cast included Christopher Chew as Sweeney Todd and Amelia Broome as Mrs. Lovett.\n\nQuebec City-based Théâtre Décibel produced the French-speaking world-premiere of the show.

Notably the 2004 production starred Mark Delavan and Elaine Paige. The show was also performed by Opera North in 1998 in the UK starring Steven Page and Beverley Klein, directed by David McVicar and conducted by James Holmes.\n\nIn the early 2000s, \"Sweeney Todd\" gained acceptance with opera companies throughout the United States, Canada, Japan, Germany, Israel, Spain, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and Australia. Bryn Terfel, the popular Welsh bass-baritone, performed the title role at Lyric Opera of Chicago in 2002, with Judith Christian, David Cangelosi, Timothy Nolen, Bonaventura Bottone, Celena Shaffer and Nathan Gunn. It was performed at the Royal Opera House in London as part of the Royal Opera season (December 2003 – January 2004) starring Sir Thomas Allen as Todd, Felicity Palmer as Mrs. Lovett and a supporting cast that included Rosalind Plowright, Robert Tear and Jonathan Veira as Judge Turpin.

This concert also played in San Francisco, from July 19, 2001 to July 21, with the San Francisco Symphony. Hearn and LuPone were joined once again by Harris, Gaines, Aler and Olsen as well as new additions Victoria Clark, Lisa Vroman and Timothy Nolen. This production was taped for PBS broadcast and won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Classical Music-Dance Program. The same production played at the Ravinia Festival in Chicago on August 24, 2001, with most of the cast from the preceding concerts, except for Plishka and Clark, who were replaced by Sherrill Milnes and Hollis Resnik.\n\nIn 2014, Price directed a new concert production, returning to Avery Fisher Hall with the New York Philharmonic on March 5–8 with Bryn Terfel as Todd, Emma Thompson as Mrs. Lovett, Philip Quast as Judge Turpin, Jeff Blumenkrantz as The Beadle, Christian Borle as Pirelli, Kyle Brenn as Tobias, Jay Armstrong Johnson as Anthony, Erin Mackey as Johanna and Audra McDonald and Bryonha Marie Parham sharing the role of The Beggar Woman.

The concert was again filmed for broadcast on PBS as part of their Live from Lincoln Center series and was first aired on September 26, 2014. The production was nominated for three Primetime Emmy Awards, winning one for Outstanding Special Class Program. This production transferred to London Coliseum Theatre for 13 performances from March 30 through April 12, 2015. The cast included original members like Terfel, Thompson and Quast, as well as new actors like John Owen-Jones and Rosalie Craig.\n\nDavid Cuevas produced the first Mexican production of \"Sweeney Todd\".

It stars Johnny Depp as Todd (Depp received an Oscar nomination and a Golden Globe Award for his performance), Helena Bonham Carter as Mrs. Lovett, Alan Rickman as Judge Turpin, Sacha Baron Cohen as Signor Pirelli, Jamie Campbell Bower as Anthony Hope, Laura Michelle Kelly as The Beggar Woman, Jayne Wisener as Johanna, Ed Sanders as Toby, and Timothy Spall as Beadle Bamford. The film was well-received by critics and theatregoers and also won the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy.\n\nStephen Sondheim believes that \"Sweeney Todd\" is a story of revenge and how it consumes a vengeful person. He has asserted, \"…what the show is really about is obsession.\" Unlike most previous representations of the story, the musical avoids a simplistic view of devilish crimes. Instead, the characters’ “emotional and psychological depths” are examined, so that Sweeney Todd is understood as a victim as well as a perpetrator in the ‘great black pit’ of humanity.\n\nSondheim's score is one of his most complex, with orchestrations by his long-time collaborator Jonathan Tunick. Relying heavily on counterpoint and angular harmonies, its compositional style has been compared to Maurice Ravel, Sergei Prokofiev, and Bernard Herrmann. Sondheim also utilizes the ancient Dies Irae in the ballad that runs throughout the score, later heard in a melodic inversion, and in the accompaniment to \"Epiphany\". According to Raymond Knapp, \"Most scene changes bring back 'The Ballad of Sweeney Todd', which includes both fast and slow versions of the 'Dies Irae'\". He also relies heavily on leitmotif – at least twenty distinct ones can be identified throughout the score.\n\nDepending on how and where the show is presented, it is sometimes considered an opera. Sondheim himself has described the piece as a \"black operetta\", and indeed, only about 20% of the show is spoken; the rest is sung-through.\n\nIn his essay for the 2005 cast album, Jeremy Sams finds it most relevant to compare Sondheim's work with operas that similarly explore the psyche of a mad murderer or social outcast, such as Alban Berg's \"Wozzeck\" (based on the play by Georg Büchner) and Benjamin Britten's \"Peter Grimes\" (1945). On the other hand, it can be seen as a precursor to the later trend of musicals based on horror themes, such as \"The Phantom of the Opera\" (1986), \"Jekyll & Hyde\" (1997), \"Little Shop of Horrors\" (1982) and \"Dance of the Vampires\" (1997), which used the description of the trend, \"grusical\", as its commercial label. Theatre critic and author Martin Gottfried wrote on this subject: \"Does so much singing make it an opera? Opera is not just a matter of everything being sung. There is an operatic kind of music, of singing, of staging. There are opera audiences, and there is an opera sensibility. There are opera \"houses\". \"Sweeney Todd\" has its occasional operatic moments, but its music overall has the chest notes, the harmonic language, the muscularity, and the edge of Broadway theater.\"\n\nDonal Henahan wrote an essay in \"The New York Times\" concerning the 1984 New York City Opera production: \"The difficulty with \"Sweeney\" was not that the opera singers were weaklings incapable of filling the State Theater with sound – Miss Elias, who was making her City Opera debut, has sung for many years at the Metropolitan, a far larger house. The other voices in the cast also were known quantities. Rather, it seemed to me that the attempt to actually sing the Sondheim score, which relies heavily on a dramatic parlando or speaking style, mainly showed how far from the operatic vocal tradition the work lies. The score, effective enough in its own way, demanded things of the opera singers that opera singers as a class are reluctant to produce.\"\n\nThe original Broadway pit consisted of a 26 piece orchestra. (The number of percussionists may vary for different shows, though the percussion book is written for two players).\n\nAn alternate orchestration is available from Music Theatre International for a 9 piece orchestra. It was written by Jonathan Tunick for the 1993 London Production.\n\nOriginal orchestrator Jonathan Tunick revised his large orchestration for the 1993 London revival, adding a dirtier, grittier texture to the score's arrangements.\n\n2012 London Revival: 15 piece orchestra.\n\nAn original Broadway cast recording was released by RCA Red Seal in 1979. It included the Judge's \"Johanna\" and the tooth-pulling contest from Act I, which had been cut in previews. It was selected by the National Recording Registry for preservation in 2013.\n\nA performance of the 1980 touring company was taped before an audience in 1981 at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in Los Angeles during the first national tour, with additional taping done in an empty theatre for a television special. The resulting program was televised on September 12, 1982, on The Entertainment Channel. It was later released on both VHS and DVD.\n\nOn 2 July 1994, the Royal National Theatre revival production starring Denis Quilley and Julia McKenzie was broadcast by the BBC. Opera North's production was also broadcast by the BBC on March 30, 1998 as was the Royal Opera House production in 2003.\n\nIn 1995, the Barcelona cast recorded a cast album sung in Catalan. This production was also broadcast on Spanish television.\n\nThe 2000 New York City Concert was recorded and released in a deluxe 2-CD set. This recording was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Musical Show Album.\n\nIn 2001, the same concert was held in San Francisco with the same leads and minor cast changes. It was also videotaped and broadcast on PBS, and then was released to VHS and DVD in 2001.\n\nThe 2005 Broadway revival also was recorded. The producers originally planned only a single-disk \"highlights\" version; however, they soon realized that they had recorded more music than could fit on one disk and it was not financially feasible to bring the performers back in to re-record. The followings songs were cut: \"Wigmaker Sequence\", \"The Letter\", \"Parlor Songs\", \"City on Fire\", and half of the final sequence (which includes \"The Judge's Return\"). This recording was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Musical Show Album.\n\nThe 2012 London revival was recorded and released on April 2, 2012 in the UK and April 10, 2012 in the United States.\n\n"}
{"id": "1794749", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1794749", "title": "Karabakh Khanate", "text": "Karabakh Khanate\n\nThe Karabakh Khanate ( – \"Xānāt e Qarebāq\", ) was a semi-independent Turkic khanate on the territories of modern-day Armenia and Azerbaijan established in about 1748 under Iranian suzerainty in Karabakh and adjacent areas. The Karabakh khanate existed until 1806, when the Russian Empire gained control over it from Iran. The Russian annexation of Karabakh was not formalized until the Treaty of Gulistan in 1813, when, as a result of Russo-Persian War (1804–13), Fath-Ali Shah of Iran officially ceded Karabakh to Tsar Alexander I of Russia. The khanate was abolished in 1822, after a few years of Russian tolerance towards its Muslim rulers, and a province, with a military administration, was formed.\n\nOn May 14, 1805 amidst the still ongoing Russo-Persian War of 1804–1813, Ibrahim Khalil Khan and the Russian general Pavel Tsitsianov signed an agreement transferring the Karabakh khanate under Russian dominion. However, the agreement was of little value, as the borders were changing constantly up to the end of the war in 1813. Following the Russian violation of the agreement that recognized Ibrahim Khalil Khan and his descendants as rulers of Karabakh in perpetuity, by abolishing the khanate in 1822, a military administration had been formed. Russian control was decisively confirmed with Iran by the Treaty of Turkmenchay of 1828.\n\nThe precursor of the Karabakh khanate, the Safavid province of Karabagh, was one of the provinces established in the northern part of the Safavid Empire. The Safavid shah of Iran Tahmasp I (r. 1524-1576) granted the governance of the province to a branch of the Qajars, the Ziyadoglu, in 1540. It was initially founded in the lowland part of Karabakh (\"Karabakh Steppe\"), away from the lands currently known as Nagorno-Karabakh. According to a prominent historian who hailed from the Karabakh Khanate - Mirza Adigozal Bey; \"The power of the Karabakh beylerbeylik covered a vast territory – from the Georgian border near “Sinig Korpu” Bridge (currently “red Bridge”) to Khudafarin Bridge on the Araz river. However, following the collapse of Safavid Empire and the death of Nader Shah Afshar in 1747, the Safavid domain split into several khanates with various forms of autonomy. During this period, Panah-Ali khan Javanshir of Karabakh consolidated his local power by establishing a \"de facto\" independent khanate and subordinating the five Armenian meliks (princes) in the region, which were referred to as \"Khamsa\" (\"five\" in Arabic), with support of the Armenian prince Melik Shahnazar II Shahnazarian of Varanda, who first accepted Panah-Ali Khan's suzerainty.\n\nThe capital of the khanate was first the castle of \"Bayat\" in 1748, in the Karabakh Steppe, followed by the newly built town of Panahabad in 1750–1752. During the reign of Ibrahim-Khalil khan, son of Panah-Ali khan, Panahabad became a large town and was renamed to Shusha, apparently after the name of a nearby Armenian village Shushi, known also as Shushikent, Shoshi or Shosh. Later, Panah Ali khan expanded the territory of Karabakh khanate subjugating territory of Karabakh, Meghri, Tatev, Karakilise, Kafan in Zangezur, and Nakchivan Khanate.\n\nIn less than a year after Shusha was founded, the Karabakh khanate was attacked by Mohammad Hasan Khan Qajar, one of the major claimants to the Iranian throne. During the Safavid rule, Karabakh was for almost two centuries governed by the Turkic-speaking clan of Qajar, as they were appointed governors of the Ganja-Karabakh province. It was due to that, that Mohammed Hasan Khan Qajar considered Karabakh his hereditary estate.\n\nMohammad Hasan Khan besieged Panahabad, but soon had to retreat because of the attack on his own domain by one of his major opponents to the Iranian throne, Karim Khan Zand. His retreat was so hasty that he even left his cannons under the walls of Shusha fortress. Panah Ali khan counterattacked the retreating troops of Mohammad Hasan Khan and even briefly took Ardabil across the Aras River in Azerbaijan.\n\nIn 1759, the Karabakh Khanate underwent a new attack from Fath-Ali Khan Afshar, ruler of Urmia. With his 30,000-strong army Fatali khan also managed to gain support from the meliks (feudal vassals) of Jraberd and Talysh (Gulistan), however melik Shahnazarian of Varanda continued to support Panah Ali Khan. The siege of Shusha lasted for six months and Fatali khan eventually had to retreat.\n\nIn 1761, Karim Khan Zand allied with Panah Ali Khan of Karabakh to defeat Fat'h Ali Khan Afshar of Urmia, who earlier subordinated the khanates of Karabakh, Marageh, and Tabriz.\n\nIn 1762, during his war with Kazem Khan of Qaradagh, Panah Khan submitted to Karim Khan Zand, who was consolidating different Khans under his Rule and was bout to besiege Urmia. After the fall of the city, Karim took Panah Khan among the hostages to Shiraz, where he soon died. Panah-Ali Khan's son Ibrahim-Khalil Khan was sent back to Karabakh as governor.\n\nUnder Ibrahim-Khalil khan Javanshir, the Karabakh khanate became one of the strongest entities of the South Caucasus and Shusha turned into a big town. According to travelers who visited Shusha at the end of 18th-early 19th centuries the town had about 2,000 houses and an approximate population of 10,000.\n\nIn the summer of 1795, Shusha underwent a major attack by Agha Mohammad Khan Qajar, son of Mohammad Hasan khan who attacked Shusha in 1752. Aga Mohammad Khan Qajar's goal was to end with the feudal fragmentation and to restore the old Safavid imperial domain. For this purpose he also wanted to proclaim himself shah (king) of Iran. However, according to Safavid tradition, the shah had to control the South Caucasus and southern Dagestan before his coronation. Therefore, Karabakh khanate and its fortified capital Shusha were the first and major obstacle to achieve these ends.\n\nAga Mohammad Khan Qajar besieged Shusha with his 80,000 strong army. Ibrahim Khalil khan mobilized the population for a long-term defense. The number of militia in Shusha reached 15,000 and women fought alongside the men. The Armenian population of Karabakh also actively participated in this struggle against the invaders and fought side by side with Muslim population jointly organizing ambushes in the mountains and forests.\n\nThe siege lasted for 33 days. Not being able to capture Shusha, Agha Mohammad Khan ceased the siege and advanced to Tiflis (present-day Tbilisi), which, despite desperate resistance, was occupied and exposed to unprecedented destruction, with many thousands of its inhabitants carried off to mainland Iran.\n\nIn 1797, Agha Mohammad Khan Qajar, who by that time had already managed to declare himself Shah, and had swiftly either re-occupied or re-subjugated the entire Caucasus that previously made up part of Iran for centuries, decided now to carry out a second attack on Karabakh, as its khan was not letting him nor his armies enter the city. Nevertheless, the khan of Karabakh had already been paying regular tribute to Agha Mohammad Khan since the aftermath of the first attack in 1795.\n\nIn this new siege, Agha Mohammad Khan devastated the surrounding villages near Shusha. The population could not recover from the previous 1795 attack and also suffered from a serious drought which lasted for three years. The artillery of the enemy also caused serious losses to the city defenders. Thus, in 1797 Aga Mohammad Khan succeeded in seizing Shusha and Ibrahim Khalil Khan was forced to flee to Dagestan.\n\nHowever, several days after the seizure of Shusha, Agha Mohammad Khan was killed in enigmatic circumstances by his bodyguards. Ibrahim-Khalil Khan returned Agha Mohammad Shah's body to Tehran, and in return, the new king Fath-Ali Shah Qajar (r. 1797-1834) appointed him the governor of Karabakh and married his daughter Agha Beyim. Agha Baji, as she came to be called, was brought to court accompanied by her brother Abol' Fath Khan, and became Fath' Ali Shah's twelfth wife; highly respected at the court, for some reason remained a virgin.\n\nDuring the rule of Ibrahim-Khalil khan, the Karabakh khanate grew in importance and established ties with other neighbouring khanates. In 1805, an agreement was made between the Karabakh khanate and the Russian Empire. According to this agreement, the Karabakh khan recognized supremacy and dominance of the Russian Empire, gave up his right to carry out independent foreign policy, and took obligation to pay the Russian Treasury 8 thousand gold roubles a year. In its turn, the Czarist government took obligation not to infringe upon the right of the legitimate successors of the Karabakh khan to administer the internal affairs of their possessions.\n\nHowever, in the same year, Russians reneged on the agreement, apparently acting on suspicion that Ibrahim-Khalil Panah Khan was a traitor. He was killed near Shusha together with some members of his family by Major Lisanevich.\n\nThe Russian Empire finally gained control over Karabakh through the Treaty of Gulistan (1813) and Treaty of Turkmenchay (1828) after defeating Iran in the Russo-Persian Wars.\nIn 1822 Russian Empire abolished the khanate. A Karabakh province was created in its place, administered by Russian officials.\n\nThe descendants of Panah Khan subsequently scattered around Iran with some remaining. Abdul Wakil Panah Khan became the Emir of Greater Khorasan.\n\nAbul-Fath Khan Javanshir, was one of the sons of the Ibrahim-Khalil Javanshir, that through his sister brother-in-law of Fath-Alī Shah Qajar. In the First Russo-Persian War Abul-Fath Khan supported the Iranians and fought on the side of the crown prince Abbas Mirza. After Karabakh was ceded to Russia; and even before it, Abul-Fath Khan withdrew from Karabakh along with his fellow tribesmen, and Abbās Mirza made him governor of Dezmār. Dezamār lay on a southern tributary of the Aras, which flowed into the main river at Ordubad. In the years following 1813 Abul-Fath Khan smuggled his warriors back across the Aras into southern Karabakh and took up residence in the village of Garmī (eight farsangs south of Shusha). Presumably this must have been done with the connivance of his brother Mahdiqoli Khan Javanshir, who had succeeded his father in 1806 as governor of Shusha in the service of the Russians. In 1818, long before the outbreak of the Second Russo-Persian War, Abbas Mirza invaded the territory to which the Russians laid claim and which was de facto under their sovereignty; supported by 100 horsemen, he brought Abul-Fath Khan back by force. What happened to Abul-Fath Khan thereafter is not known; he does not appear to have taken part in the battles of the Second Russo-Persian War. His brother Mahdī-qolī Khan crossed into Iranian soil in 1822. Under the terms of the peace of Torkmanchay in 1828, the whole of Karabakh was finally ceded to Russia.\n\nKarabakh Khanate never had a permanent army, but those who were a certain age and had the ability to serve in the military were written in special register. When it was necessary, soldiers were called together with local landlords, maliks and beks. The persons whose names were included in the register with volunteers created the Army of Karabakh Khanate, but they were deployed only in cases of real war or emergency. Sometimes, especially in urgent circumstances, the soldiers from Dagestan were invited and joined to companies. For example, when Agha Muhammad Khan Qajar seized Shusha for 33 days, part of soldiers who were defending Shusha were soldiers from Dagestan. \nDuring ruling of Ibrahim Khalil Khan the Army Register contained more than 12.000 names. All spendings of army during the campaign was paid by Khan.\n\nThere were in total three rulers of the khanate, all members of the Javanshir clan;\n\n\nIn 1822 the Khanate of Karabakh was abolished, and absorbed into the Russian Empire.\n\n\n\n"}

The signs most associated with infertility are Gemini, Leo. In addition, Aries, Sagittarius, and Aquarius are also believed to quite often have problems in matters of reproduction and are therefore considered \"semi-barren\".\n\nWilliam Lilly (1647) in CHAPTER CXVIII of his book \"Christian Astrology\" described the signs as follows:\n\nAries: By reason Mars, a sterill planet hath that for his house, and the Sun for Exaltation, is rather a Sign of Barrennesse than otherwise.<br>\nTaurus: Is reputed more fruitful than barren, being the house of Venus, who is fruitful, and the exaltation of the Moon.<br>\nGemini: Is adjudged barren, being the house of Mercury, who discerns nothing of himself.<br>\nCancer is the most fruitful and bountiful Sign, it being the house of the Moon, and the exaltation of Jupiter.<br>\nLeo: Is reputed barren, being the house of the Sun, and Lyons bring forth Young rarely.<br>\nVirgo: Signe, for Mayds of themselves produce few Births &c.<br>\nLibra: Rather a Signe of fecundity, it being the house of Venus, and Saturn his exaltation.<br>\nScorpio: Though the house of Mars, yet generally accepted for fruitful.<br>\nSagittarius: Ever conceived fruitfull, because the house of Jupiter.<br>\nCapricorn: A Signe of few children inclining to barrennesse.<br>\nAquarius: Without doubt more fruitful than barren.<br>\nPisces: Very fecund and prolificall, being the House of Jupiter and exaltation of Venus, its Signe of many Children.\n\nIn \"The Anthology\" Valens is translated as describing Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius, Capricorn and Aquarius as either \"unfruitful\", \"unprolific\" or \"barren.\" Contrarily he refers to Taurus as \"the wealth-bringing zoidion of the cosmos\" and Libra and Scorpio as signs of property loss. He made no statement regarding the fruitfulness of Leo or Libra, possibly meaning that he regards those two signs as neutral or perhaps semi-barren/semi-fruitful.\n\nMost modern astrologists no longer ascribe to this premise.\n"}
{"id": "1794755", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1794755", "title": "Heinz Rühmann", "text": "Heinz Rühmann\n\nHeinrich Wilhelm \"Heinz\" Rühmann (; 7 March 1902 – 3 October 1994) was a German film actor who appeared in over 100 films between 1926 and 1993. He is one of the most famous and popular German actors of the 20th century, and is considered a German film legend. Rühmann is best known for playing the part of a comic ordinary citizen in film comedies such as \"Three from the Filling Station\" and \"The Punch Bowl\". During his later years, he was also a respected character actor in films such as \"The Captain from Köpenick\" and \"It Happened in Broad Daylight\". His only English-speaking movie was \"Ship of Fools\" in 1964.\n\nRühmann was born in Essen as the son of a restaurateur. He started his acting career during the early 1920s and appeared in numerous theatres in Germany during the following years. His role in the 1930 movie \"Die Drei von der Tankstelle\" (\"The Three from the Filling Station\") led him to film stardom. He remained highly popular as a comedic actor (and sometime singer) throughout the 1930s and early 1940s. He remained in Germany and continued to work during the Nazi period, as did his friend and colleague, Hans Albers.\n\nDuring the 1933-45 period, he acted in 37 films and directed four. After January 1933, Rühmann did not speak openly about German politics, but instead kept himself as neutral as possible. He never stated a word against or towards the Nazis in the press, although he had been a supporter of democracy. In 1938, he divorced his Jewish wife Maria Bernheim, who then left Germany and travelled to Stockholm where she married a Swedish actor. The divorce caused Rühmann to be accused by some of wanting to secure his career; however, the marriage had probably already fallen apart, and some sources say that he wanted to protect his wife with the divorce. After 1945, Bernheim defended her ex-husband against accusations of opportunism. His second wife, Hertha Feiler, whom he married shortly after, had a Jewish grandfather, a fact that caused Rühmann problems with the Nazi cultural authorities. Rühmann retained his reputation as an apolitical star during the entire Nazi era.\nDuring the war years, Rühmann, like others, was co-opted by the State in some films. His role as lead actor in the comedy \"Quax the Crash Pilot\" was supposed to distract the populace from the war. In 1941, under the direction of Reichsfilmkammer president Carl Froelich, Rühmann played the title role in \"Der Gasmann\", about a gas-meter reader who is suspected of foreign espionage. In 1944, the premiere of \"Die Feuerzangenbowle\" was forbidden by the Nazi film censor for \"disrespect for authority\". Through his good relationships with the regime, however, Rühmann was able to screen the film in public. He brought the film to the Führerhauptquartier Wolfsschanze for a private screening for Hermann Göring and others. Afterward, Göring was able to get the ban on the film lifted by Adolf Hitler. A nostalgic comedy of mistaken identities, the film was probably the most popular film of his career and later became a cult hit among college students. As a \"state actor\", the highest title for an actor during the Nazi era, Rühmann was not drafted into the Wehrmacht. He did have to take the basic training to become a military pilot, but for the State, Rühmann was more valuable as an actor and he was spared having to take part in the war effort. In August 1944, Joseph Goebbels put Rühmann on the Gottbegnadeten list of indispensable actors.\n\nRühmann was a favorite actor of Holocaust diarist Anne Frank, who pasted his picture on the wall of her room in her family's hiding place during the war, where it can still be seen today. The enormous range of Rühmann's popularity during the Nazi era is illustrated by the fact that he was also a favorite actor of Adolf Hitler and his propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels.\n\nRühmann had a difficult time resuming his career after the war, but by the mid-1950s, the former comedian had established himself again as a star, only this time as Germany's leading character actor. In 1956, Rühmann starred in the title role of the internationally acclaimed picture \"Der Hauptmann von Köpenick\" (\"The Captain of Köpenick\"), the true story of a Prussian cobbler, Wilhelm Voigt, who dressed up as an army officer and took over the town hall in Köpenick. In the days of the German Empire, the army had an exalted status and Voigt embarrassed the army officers and civil servants who obeyed him without question. Rühmann was also the leading man in the 1960 film version of \"The Adventures of the Good Soldier Schweik\", after the novel by Czech author Jaroslav Hašek. He also played the role of Father Brown in three German films during the 1960s. In 1965, Rühmann was brought to Hollywood by producer Stanley Kramer for a supporting role as a German Jew in his all-star movie \"Ship of Fools\".\n\nHis wife Hertha Feiler died in 1970 and Rühmann married his third wife Hertha Droemer in 1974. In his later years, he also worked as a recitator for German television. His last film was \"Faraway, So Close!\" (1993) by Wim Wenders, in which he played an old fatherly chauffeur named Konrad. Rühmann died in October 1994, aged 92 years. He was buried in Berg-Aufkirchen, Bavaria. His popularity with German audiences continues: In 1995, he was posthumously awarded the Goldene Kamera as the \"Greatest German Actor of the Century\"; in 2006, a poll voted him number one in the ZDF TV-show \"Unsere Besten - Favorite German Actors\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He entered politics in 1970 at the age of 18, joining the Czechoslovak Socialist Party, a member party of the Czechoslovak National Front. He reached the lower levels of the party hierarchy before leaving the party in 1986.\n\nParoubek spent his one-year military service as an army food services supervisor in the southern Bohemian city of Prachatice. After graduating in 1976, Paroubek worked as a manager for several state companies including ().\n\nIn 1979, as an executive committee member of the Czechoslovak Socialist Party, one of the puppet parties of the Communist regime, he attracted the attention of the communist state secret police (StB). He met agents three times in meetings where he allegedly expressed loyalty to the communist government and disagreement with opposition groups such as Charter 77. He was assigned the code name \"Roko\", after his pet parakeet, but never actually signed a cooperation agreement with the secret police, and after 1982 the cooperation ceased, as Paroubek \"did not have enough potential and contacts\".\n\nFollowing the Velvet Revolution in November 1989, Paroubek joined the re-established Social Democratic Party (ČSSD), and was given an executive post by chairman Jiří Horák. In 1993 he stood for chairmanship of the party but was defeated by Miloš Zeman. In 2000, he placed fourth in elections to the Senate of the Czech Republic in the Prague 8 district. Paroubek held senior positions in the Prague municipal government for over 14 years.\n\nIn August 2004 Paroubek was appointed Minister of Regional Development in the government of Stanislav Gross. After a government crisis in early 2005 related to Gross's personal financial affairs, Paroubek succeeded him to become the 6th Prime Minister of the Czech Republic on 25 April 2005. On 13 May 2005, Paroubek's government passed a vote of confidence in the chamber of deputies, with all 101 coalition-party members supporting the government and the 98 opposition members and one independent voting against. Paroubek's government, which was little changed from Gross's, led the country until the parliamentary elections of June 2006.\n\nOn 30 July 2005, the CzechTek free techno party was broken up by around 1,000 riot police using tear gas and water cannons, claiming the event participants had damaged private property. The police actions left around 80 people and several police officers injured, leading to public protests in front of the Czech interior ministry. Paroubek had spoken in favour of the action beforehand and subsequently defended it, stating that the participants were \"not dancing children but dangerous people\", but was criticised for the raid by President Václav Klaus. Opposition parties and the media condemned the government, with some drawing comparisons between the actions of Paroubek's government and crackdowns against students by the communist government in 1989.\n\nParoubek was selected as the election leader for the 2006 elections and at a ČSSD party congress in mid-May was elected uncontested as the new chairman with 90% of the vote. The election campaign was highly combative due to deep animosity between ČSSD, the conservative Civic Democratic Party (ODS), and their respective party leaders.\n\nIn May 2006, a report by Jan Kubice, head of the Czech Police's organized crime unit, was released. The so-called \"Kubice Report\" accused Paroubek of having links with the criminal underworld, as well as participating in a murder cover-up, attempts to derail police investigations and attempting to criminalise investigating officers. The report was initially classified and was presented to the proper commission of the Chamber of Deputies of the Czech Parliament, but was made public four days before election day. Paroubek responded by accusing the opposition ODS of conspiracy and \"putschist\" tactics, and vowed to punish those responsible if elected. After the election Paroubek stated that \"ODS did not abhor breaking many laws and did it on purpose four days before the elections to avoid establishing of this evident and repeated breaking of legal order. (...) I feel a duty to announce that democracy in this country incurred a hard intervention comparable maybe only with February 1948. Only with the difference that a blue totalitarianism looms.\" Paroubek later publicly apologized for these comments.\n\nAlthough opinion polling put support for ČSSD at around 10% when Stanislav Gross resigned as Prime Minister, the party eventually received 32.3% in the elections and finished runner-up to ODS.\n\nOn 9 September Paroubek released a document claiming it showed that the ODS planned to discredit him. Paroubek refused to name the source of this paper.\n\nAfter the 2006 elections, Paroubek remained as leader of ČSSD in opposition, and stayed in this post until his resignation immediately after the result of the 2010 legislative election was announced on 29 May 2010. Although the Social Democrats became the largest party in the Chamber of Deputies after the election, they were unable to form a governing coalition and Paroubek subsequently resigned as leader of the party.\n\nOn 9 October 2008, an official launch party was held for Paroubek's book \"The Czech Republic, Europe and the world through the eyes of a social democrat\" () in the Monarch restaurant in Prague. Shortly after the end of the event there was an altercation between two of the guests, businessman Bohumír Ďuričko and Václav Kočka jr., the son of a carousel operator. Kočka was killed in the incident. Ďuričko was convicted of the murder and sentenced to 12.5 years in prison. Jiří Paroubek initially distanced himself from the incident and claimed he did not know Ďuričko and had not invited him to the event. However, relations between Paroubek and Ďuričko had been publicly known since at least 2005, when Paroubek had planned to spend the holidays with Ďuričko's family, but cancelled the plans when it became known that Ďuričko was a communist secret service agent.\n\nOn 7 October 2011, Paroubek left ČSSD and in the same month founded a new party called National Socialists – 21st Century Left. Following the party's failure to win any seats in the Chamber of Deputies in the 2013 election, Paroubek announced his resignation from the party and retirement from politics in November 2014.\n\nIn 2017, Paroubek repeatedly attempted to rejoin the Social Democratic Party. However, his bids were vetoed by local and regional party representatives. In June 2018, Paroubek wanted to stand as a Social Democrat candidate in the 2018 Senate elections. However, his nomination was blocked by the party committee. He subsequently stood as an independent candidate.\n\nIn February 2018, Paroubek stated that he plans to run in the next Czech presidential election. He decided to run in the 2018 Senate election in Ostrava. He sought the nomination of ČSSD but subsequently ran as an independent. He received 7% of the vote and finished in 7th place, failing to win the seat.\n\nJiří Paroubek's Cabinet\n\n"}

The structure was built during the Early Bronze Age (21st century BCE) but had crumbled to ruins by the 6th century BCE of the Neo-Babylonian period, when it was restored by King Nabonidus.\n\nIts remains were excavated in the 1920s and 1930s by Sir Leonard Woolley. Under Saddam Hussein in the 1980s, they were encased by a partial reconstruction of the façade and the monumental staircase. The Ziggurat of Ur is the best-preserved of those known from Iran and Iraq, besides the ziggurat of Dur Untash (Chogha Zanbil). It is one of three well preserved structures of the Neo-Sumerian city of Ur, along with the Royal Mausolea and the Palace of Ur-Nammu (the \"E-hursag\").\n\nThe ziggurat was built by King Ur-Nammu, who dedicated it in honour of Nanna/Sîn in approximately the 21st century BCE (short chronology) during the Third Dynasty of Ur. The massive step pyramid measured in length, in width and over in height. The height is speculative, as only the foundations of the Sumerian ziggurat have survived.\n\nThe ziggurat was a piece in a temple complex that served as an administrative center for the city, and which was a shrine of the moon god Nanna, the patron deity of Ur.\n\nThe construction of the ziggurat was finished in the 21st century BCE by King Shulgi, who, in order to win the allegiance of cities, proclaimed himself a god. During his 48-year reign, the city of Ur grew to be the capital of a state controlling much of Mesopotamia. Many ziggurats were made by stacking mud-bricks up and using mud to seal them together.\n\nKing Nabonidus, the last king of the Neo-Babylonian Empire in the 6th century BCE, after \"finding little left but the last stage and nothing to guide him as to the monument's original appearance\", had it restored in seven stages rather than three.\n\nThe remains of the ziggurat were first discovered by William Loftus in 1850. The first excavations at the site were conducted by John George Taylor (mistakenly credited as \"J. E. Taylor\") in the 1850s, leading to the identification of the site as Ur.\nAfter World War I, preliminary excavations were performed by Reginald Campbell Thompson and Henry Hall. The site was extensively excavated in the 1920s by Sir Leonard Woolley by appointment of the University Museum of the University of Pennsylvania and the British Museum in the period of 1922 to 1934.\n\nThe remains of the ziggurat consist of a three-layered solid mass of mud brick faced with burnt bricks set in bitumen. The lowest layer corresponds to the original construction of Ur-Nammu, while the two upper layers are part of the Neo-Babylonian restorations. The façade of the lowest level and the monumental staircase were rebuilt under the orders of Saddam Hussein.\n\nThe ziggurat was damaged in the Gulf War in 1991 by small arms fire and the structure was shaken by explosions. Four bomb craters can be seen nearby and the walls of the ziggurat are marred by over 400 bullet holes.\n\nAs of 2008, the site is under the supervision of curator Dief Mohssein Naiif al-Gizzy.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1794780", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1794780", "title": "Louise of Hesse-Kassel", "text": "Louise of Hesse-Kassel\n\nLouise of Hesse-Kassel (, ; 7 September 1817 – 29 September 1898) was Queen of Denmark by marriage to King Christian IX of Denmark.\n\nShe was a daughter of Prince William of Hesse-Kassel and Princess Charlotte of Denmark. Louise of Hesse lived in Denmark from the age of three.\n\nAs a niece of King Christian VIII, who ruled Denmark between 1839 and 1848, Louise was very close to the succession after several individuals of the royal house of Denmark who were elderly and childless. As children, her brother Frederik Wilhelm, her sisters and she were the closest relatives of King Christian VIII who were likely to produce heirs. It was easy to see that the agnatic succession from King Frederick III of Denmark would probably become extinct within a generation. Louise was one of the females descended from Frederick III of Denmark, and she enjoyed the remainder provisions of the succession (according to the Semi-Salic Law) in the event that his male line became extinct. She and her siblings were not agnatic descendants of the House of Oldenburg and the Dukes of Schleswig-Holstein, thus ineligible to inherit the twin duchies, since there existed a number of agnatic lines eligible to inherit those territories.\n\nLouise was married at the Amalienborg Palace in Copenhagen on 26 May 1842 to her second cousin Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glucksburg. He was soon selected as hereditary prince of Denmark and later ascended the throne of Denmark as King Christian IX. The marriage greatly strengthed Christian's efforts to secure the Danish throne, since it joined two competing claimants whose children would have an enhanced connection to the ancient bloodlines of the Danish monarchy. Louise and Christian lived a quiet family life. Louise's mother and siblings renounced their rights to the Danish throne to her. Louise herself in turn renounced her rights to the throne to her spouse Christian. In 1852, this succession order was confirmed by the Nordic countries and foreign powers in London.\n\nIn 1847, Prince Christian was, with the approval of Europe's Great Powers, chosen as successor to the Danish throne by Christian VIII (who did not expect his only surviving son, the future Frederick VII, to father dynastic sons). This choice of heir was made more dynastically palatable by the fact that, thanks to the mass renunciations of the Hesses, Christian's wife Louise became the heiress eventual to the crown, meaning that the couple's children would be heirs to the throne both by right of international treaty and by compliance with the \"Lex Regia\". This resolved the succession to the Danish crown, but not Denmark's claim on the twin duchies of Schleswig and Holstein. German Holstein's historic law of succession was Salic and could not so easily be reconciled with Christian's claim so long as the Augustenborgs survived and Prussia offered itself as the international champion of German nationalism. The result of this conflict was the Second War of Schleswig.\n\nOn 3 July 1853, King Frederick VII confirmed this succession. By that act, Louise and Christian became Crown Princess and Crown Prince of Denmark. Louise had a tense relationship with King Frederick VII, who contradicted the succession of her spouse, and whose marriage to the non-royal Louise Rasmussen she did not approve of. Therefore, the King and the Crown Prince couple did not see each other very often.\n\nOn 15 November 1863, Louise and Christian became Queen and King of Denmark. The relationship between Louise and Christian seems to have been at least partially a marriage of love, and is described as happy: she supported him in his struggle to be acknowledged as heir to the throne of Denmark, and the couple became strongly attached to each other during the years of succession struggle. Her loyalty is said to have been of great importance to him, and Christian is described as dependent upon her intelligence, judgment and psychological strength, all of which were considered to be superior to his own. Their life style is described as simple and puritan, and as this suited the contemporary view of an exemplary family life, the royal family was regarded as a morally correct role model. Because of this, the pregnancy of her unmarried daughter Thyra in 1870 became a burden; Louise took control of the situation and hid it from public knowledge by sending Thyra to give birth abroad, keeping the whole affair a family secret.\n\nAs queen, Louise lived a life isolated from the people and did not seek a relationship with or recognition from the public. She took no part in state affairs; her political interests focused on the arranged dynastic marriages of her children and were affected by her anti-German views. The high status marriages she arranged for her children secured the newly established Danish dynasty international status, connecting Denmark to Great Britain, Russia, Sweden and Greece. Known as \"The Mother-in-law of Europe,\" her annual family gatherings at Bernstorff and Fredensborg attracted more attention every year and made her a popular symbol of family life. Significant events in her life included her wedding anniversary on 26 May 1867, when she received great public praise; her birthday celebration of 1887; the wedding anniversary of 1892, and her 80th birthday in 1897.\n\nThe great dynastic success of Louise's six children was to a great extent a result of Louise's own ambitions rather than the efforts of her husband Christian IX. Some have compared Louise's dynastic capabilities with those of Queen Victoria. \n\nShe was interested in music and painting. She acted as the patron of artists such as Elisabeth Jerichau Baumann. Some of Louise's own paintings were exhibited and given as gifts to members of other royal dynasties.\n\nLouise supported 26 different charity organizations. Among them were Vallø stift; \"Kronprinsesse Louises praktiske Tjenestepigeskole\" (The Servant Girls' School of Crown Princess Louise) and the \"Dronning Louises Børnehospital\" (Queen Louise's Children's Hospital). In 1857, she founded the \"Louisestiftelsen\" (Louise Foundation), an orphanage for girls with the purpose of raising them to a life of domestic servants, which illustrated her deeply conservative ideals. Her most known project, and one which she herself referred to as her most important, was the \"Diakonissestiftelsen\" (The Deaconess Foundation) in 1863, which introduced the Deaconess profession in Denmark. In 1891, she initiated the \"Foreningen til Oprettelse af Friskolebørneasyler i Kbh.s Arbejderkvarter\" (Foundation for the Establishment of Charter school's Asylums in the Labour Quarters of Copenhagen). She founded the \"Belønnings- og Forsørgelsesforeningen\" (The Reward- and Self-supporting Foundation) in 1881, supported domestic servants by providing financial aid to the ill, during unemployment and in retirement. Louise was deeply conservative, and her charitable work has been interpreted as a fear of socialism and the growing workers movement. \n\nDuring her last years, she became deaf, and her needs were taken care of by two deaconesses from the Deaconess institution she founded. Louise was queen for 35 years, longer than any other Danish queen before her.\n\nOn her death in 1898, she was interred in Roskilde Cathedral near Copenhagen.\n\nLouise had the following six children with Christian. Eventually, they had thirty-nine grandchildren.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1794785", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1794785", "title": "Korean royal court cuisine", "text": "Korean royal court cuisine\n\nKorean royal court cuisine (\"Joseon Wangjo Gungjung yori\") was the style of cookery within Korean cuisine traditionally consumed at the court of the Joseon Dynasty, which ruled Korea from 1392 to 1910. There has been a revival of this cookery style in the 21st century. It is said that twelve dishes should be served along with rice and soup, with most dishes served in \"bangjja\" (bronzeware).\n\nCollectively known as \"gungjung eumsik\" during the pre-modern era, the foods of the royal palace were reflective of the opulent nature of the past rulers of the Korean peninsula. The opulent nature of the royalty is evidenced in examples as far back as the Silla kingdom, where a man-made lake (Anapji Lake, located in Gyeongju), was created with multiple pavilions and halls for the sole purpose of opulent banquets and a spring fed channel, Poseokjeong, was created for the singular purpose of setting wine cups afloat during the writing of poems.\n\nReflecting the regionalism of the kingdoms and bordering countries of the peninsula, the cuisine borrowed from each of these areas to function as a showcase. The royalty had the finest regional delicacies sent to the palace. Although there are records of banquets pre-dating the Joseon period, the majority of these records note a vast variety of foods without mentioning the specific foods present. The meals cooked for the royal family were not seasonal, like a commoner's meal. Instead, they varied significantly day to day. The eight provinces were represented each month in turn in the royal palace by ingredients presented by their governors. This gave the cooks a wide assortment of ingredients to use for royal meals.\n\nFood held a very important place in Joseon period. Official positions were created within the Six Ministries (\"Yukjo\", 육조) that were charged with all matters related to procurement and consumption of food and drink for the royal court. The Board of Personnel (\"Ijo\", 이조) contained positions specific for attaining rice for the royal family. The Board of Rites (\"Yejo\") were responsible for foods prepared for ancestor rites, attaining wines and other beverages, and medicinal foods. There were also hundreds of slaves and women who worked in the palace that had tasks such as making tofu, liquor, tea, and \"tteok\" (rice cakes). The women were the cooks to the royal palace and were of commoner or low-status families. These women would be split into specific skill sets or \"bureaus\" such as the Bureau of special foods (\"Saenggwa-bang\", 생과방) or the Bureau of cooking foods (\"Soju-bang\", 소주방). These female cooks may have been assisted by male cooks from outside the palace during larger banquets when necessary.\n\nFive meals were generally served in the royal palace each day during the Joseon period, and records suggest this pattern had existed from antiquity. Three of these meals would be full-course meals, while the afternoon and after dinner meals would consist of lighter fare. The first meal, \"mieumsang\" (미음상), was served at sunrise on days when the king and queen were not taking herbal medicines. The meal consisted of rice porridge (\"juk\", 죽) made with ingredients such as abalone (\"jeonbokjuk\"), white rice (\"huinjuk\"), mushrooms (\"beoseotjuk\"), pine nuts (\"jatjuk\"), and sesame (\"kkaejuk\"). The side dishes could consist of \"kimchi\", \"nabak kimchi\", oysters, soy sauce, and other items. The porridge was thought to give vitality to the king and queen throughout the day.\n\nThe \"sura\" (수라) were the main meals of the day. Breakfast was served at ten in the morning and the evening meals were served between six and seven at night. The set of three tables (\"surasang\", 수라상), were usually set with two types of rice, two types of soup, two types of stew (\"jjigae\"), one dish of \"jjim\" (meat stew), one dish of \"jeongol\" (a casserole of meat and vegetables), three types of \"kimchi\", three types of \"jang\" (장) and twelve side dishes, or called 12 cheop (12첩). The meals were set in the \"suragan\" (수라간), a room specifically used for taking meals, with the king seated to the east and the queen to the west. Each had their own set of tables and were attended by three palace servant women known as \"sura sanggung\" (수라상궁). These women would remove bowl covers and offer the foods to the king and queen after ensuring that the dishes were not poisoned.\n\nThis Korean food heritage has been inscribed by the government as Important Intangible Cultural Property No. 38. Han Bongnyeo (한복려 ; 韓福麗) is the current Living National Treasure as the keeper of this property.\n\nThe \"surasang\" should be served with three tables and a hotpot. The largest round table at the right upper corner is the main table which contains main bowl, soups and stews, dishes, side dishes and fermented stored dishes. The small round table at the left upper corner contains red \"sura\", \"gomtang\" or thick meat broth, dessert, tea, empty dishes and bowls. This table is also used to store the covers of bowls and dishes used in the main table. The rectangular table in the right lower corner contains eggs, sesame oil, various raw vegetables and several sauces. The hotpot at the left lower corner is heated with charcoal, and usually contains \"jeongol\" such as \"sinseollo\".\n\nThe setting was as follows:\n\nA, B, C: surasanggung (수라상궁)\n\n\nSura (수라) is a bowl of boiled rice and grains. Two kinds of \"sura\" must always be served. This includes \"white sura\".\n\nJuk () and mieum (미음) or eung-i (응이) are types of rice porridge usually served in the morning. \"Juk\" is thicker than \"mieum\" in texture, latter of which is similar to the Western gruel.\n\nGuksu () are noodles that are prepared with buckwheat or wheat flour, with the former being preferred.\n\nMandu (만두) are boiled or steamed dumplings. \"Mandu\" dough is made from either wheat flour or buckwheat.

If seasoned with \"gochujang\", they are called \"gamjeong\". \"Jochi\" is seasoned with salt or salted shrimp. Other varieties include:\n\nJjim (): steamed or boiled beef, pork, and fish seasoned with vegetables. Seon () is steamed vegetables, tofu, and fish stuffed with fillings made with beef or chicken and onions.\n\nJeongol and sinseollo are similar to Western stew or Chinese hotpot. \"Sinseollo\" (which is a variety of \"jeongol\") is boiled in meat stock with various vegetables and mushrooms in a specific cooking pot with holes. \"Jeongol\" and \"sinseollo\" are served with a burner.\n\nSaengchae (생채) is like a salad seasoned with salt, vinegar, soy sauce, or mustard sauce.\n\nNamul (나물) are any variety of steamed vegetables seasoned with hot pepper, garlic, green onion, salt, and sesame or perilla oil.

Known by her World Championship Wrestling ring name Kimberly Page, she was the leader of The Nitro Girls and the valet for her then-husband wrestler Diamond Dallas Page. She appeared in \"Playboy\" newsstand pictorials from 1994 to 1999, and has been featured in \"Iron Man\" magazine for her fitness workouts.\n\nKimberly Bacon was born on New Year's Day in Chicago, Illinois, but grew up in Fort Myers, Florida. Shortly before she graduated from Auburn University with a degree in public relations and journalism in 1990, Kimberly met Page Falkinburg (Diamond Dallas Page) at his Florida nightclub in December 1989 when she was 20 years old, and started dating shortly after. Falkinburg was then a manager in World Championship Wrestling, while Kimberly graduated with a master's degree in advertising from Northwestern University in 1991 and worked in the industry for a brief time before joining him in the wrestling business.\n\nShe appeared on the covers of both \"Physical\" (January 2003) and \"Iron Man\" (November 2003).\n\nHer first WCW television appearance was in 1994, shortly after she became Page's regular valet, she was known as The Diamond Doll. Before then, she worked as a public relations coordinator, account executive, aerobics instructor and waitress.\n\nPage was engaged in a feud with Dave Sullivan, who objected to how Page treated her. Page won that feud but ended up losing Kimberly in a match to Johnny B. Badd at the WCW World War 3 pay-per-view event in 1995. Badd promptly freed her and she became his valet, simply going by the name of Kimberly. After Mero departed for the World Wrestling Federation, she became The Booty Babe for The Booty Man, who had recently shed his \"Zodiac\" gimmick and left the Dungeon of Doom. The gimmick lasted until late 1996.\n\nKimberly did not appear on WCW programming again until March 1997's Uncensored, when she rejoined Page (now a face after having refused to join the New World Order) as part of his feud with \"Macho Man\" Randy Savage, who had interrupted a Gene Okerlund interview with Page. Miss Elizabeth then flashed an NWO-defaced centerfold of Kimberly from the 1997 edition of \"Playboy's Nude Celebrities,\" after which Kimberly herself appeared from backstage having been spray-painted off-screen by the NWO. The segment was also the first public revelation of Page and Kimberly being an actual married couple.\n\nAfter the Page/Savage feud ended, Kimberly formed The Nitro Girls in July. They danced during breaks on \"WCW Monday Nitro\" to entertain the fans. The Nitro Girls were given their own official website, while she and several members appeared in a non-nude pictorial in the September 1998 issue of \"Penthouse\", and filmed a 1999 pay-per-view. In February 1999, Kimberly became involved in an angle in which she was being stalked by Scott Steiner, which culminated in Page attacking Steiner in the arena parking garage on the February 8 episode of \"WCW Monday Nitro\" as Steiner followed her to her car; Steiner then stole the car with Kim inside, and attempted to run over Page in the garage. He then threw Kimberly (actually a stunt-woman) from the car, and she was later taken away in an ambulance.\n\nIn October 1999, Kimberly again accompanied Page to the ring as his valet. On the November 1, 1999 episode of WCW Monday Nitro she departed the Nitro Girls and later took part in a match against David Flair at Mayhem on November 21. In 2000, she turned heel on Page to join Vince Russo and Eric Bischoff's New Blood stable. In the storyline, she decided it was \"\"all about me\"\" instead of Page, and it was hinted she was romantically involved with Bischoff. She had brief feuds with Miss Elizabeth and Miss Hancock, and was also briefly paired with Mike Awesome, before her departure from WCW in June 2000.\n\nShe and Diamond Dallas Page amicably separated in July 2004, then divorced in 2005.\n\nWhile living in Atlanta, Page took acting jobs at the Alliance Theatre, then moved to Los Angeles to pursue acting as a career. Her first film role was a deleted scene in 2001's \"Rat Race\" that was included in the DVD extras, and her first starring role was in 2004's \"The Scam Artist\".\n\nShe played Catwoman in the 2004 short fan film \"Grayson\" and in 2005 appeared on \"\" as Horatio Caine's murdered girlfriend in the episode \"Under Suspicion\".

{"id": "1794797", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1794797", "title": "Dynamic enterprise modeling", "text": "Dynamic enterprise modeling\n\nDynamic enterprise modeling (DEM) is an enterprise modeling approach developed by the Baan company, and used for the Baan enterprise resource planning system which aims \"to align and implement it in the organizational architecture of the end-using company\".\n\nAccording to Koning (2008), Baan introduced dynamic enterprise modelling in 1996 as a \"means for implementing the Baan ERP product. The modelling focused on a Petri net–based technique for business process modelling to which the Baan application units were to be linked. DEM also contains a supply-chain diagram tool for the logistic network of the company and of an enterprise function modelling diagram\".\n\nTo align a specific company with dynamic enterprise modeling, the organizational structure is blueprinted top-down from high-level business processes to low-level processes. This blueprint is used as a roadmap of the organization, that is compatible with the structural roadmap of the software package. Having both roadmaps, the software package and the organizational structure are alienable. The blueprint of an organizational structure in dynamic enterprise modeling is called a reference model. A reference model is the total view of visions, functions, organizational structures and processes, which together can be defined as a representative way of doing business in a certain organizational typology.\n\nThe DEM reference model consists of a set of underlying models that depict the organizational architecture in a top-down direction. The underlying models are:\n\n\nTogether these models are capable of depicting the total organizational structure and aspects that are necessary during the implementation of the dynamic enterprise modeling. The models can have differentiations, which are based on the typology of the organization (i.e.: engineer-to-order organizations require different model structures than assemble-to-order organizations. To elaborate on the way that the reference model is used to implement software and to keep track of the scope of implementation methods, the business control model and the business process model will be explained in detail.\n\nThe business control model exists of the business functions of the organization and their internal and external links. Basic features in the model are:\n\n\nNext to interaction between two business functions, interaction can also exist between objects that are not in the scope of the reference model. These objects can be external business functions and agents.\n\nAgents on the other hand are entities similar to business functions with the exception that they are external of the business (i.e.: customers and suppliers).\nSubroutines of processes can be modeled in the Business Control Model to take care of possible exceptions that can occur during the execution of a process (i.e.: delay handling in the delivery of goods).\n\nIn addition to business functions that consist of the main processes of the organization, management functions exist.\n\nHaving this reference, the main processes of the organization can be captured in the Business Control Model. The main functions of the organization are grouped in the business functions, which consist of the processes that are part of the specific business function. Interactions between the business functions are then depicted using the request-feedback loops.\n\nA business control model is constructed according to a set path.\n\nAfter creating the main business functions within the business control model, the several business functions are detailed out.\n\nAfter high-level detail definitions, the business functions are decomposed to lower-level detail definitions to make the business control model alienable to the lower models within the reference model, for this practice, mainly the Business Process Model. In the Business Process Model the processes are elaborated until the lowest level of detail. Given this level of detail, the Baan software functionality is then projected on the processes, depicted in the Business Process Model.\n\nThe modeling of processes in DEM, modeling the business process model is done using \"Petri net building blocks\". DEM uses 4 construction elements:\n\n\nThese 4 construction elements enables the modeling of DEM models. The modeling is due to a set collection of modeling constraints, guiding the modeling process in order to have similarly created models by different modelers. Control activities exist in different structures in order to set different possible routes for process flows. The used structures for control activities are:\n\nOR means one of the two starting job tokens can be used or both, XOR means only one of the tokens can be used to create the output job token.\n\nThe example below demonstrates the modeling of the concept of marriage and divorce using Petri net building blocks. \n\nUsing an embedded method brings the power that the method is designed to implement the software product that the method comes with. This suggests a less complicated usage of the method and more support possibilities.\nThe negative aspect of an embedded method obviously is that it can only be used for specific product software. Engineers and consultants, operating with several software products, could have more use of a general method, to have just one way of working.\n\n\n\n"}

In the 1960s it moved to the outskirts onto a multi building site. In addition to the academic curriculum the schools includes drama, music, sport and a combined cadet force.\n\nKing Edward's School Bath was judged as \"excellent\" in every category in the school's 2015 Independent Schools Inspectorate (ISI) report. The report noted that \"The school's extra-curricular provision is outstanding\", \"Achievements outside the curriculum are both numerous and outstanding\" and \"The quality of the pupils' achievements and learning is excellent\".\n\nThe school was ranked as one of the top four independent schools in the south west by \"The Sunday Times Schools Guide\", Parent Power Survey based upon 2016 academic results.\n\nThe school was founded in 1552 under laws set out in the Charities Act of 1545, which had been passed by Henry VIII to use funds from the dissolution of the monasteries to replace monastic grammar schools such as that run by Bath Abbey. The Mayor of Bath and one of the members of parliament for Bath, Edward Ludwell, petitioned Edward VI for land previously owned by the priory, to establish the school, initially in Frog Lane, and support ten poor people, which also prevented the crown from selling off the land previously held by the priory. In 1580s the school moved to a disused church building by the north gate of the city. The city corporation misappropriated the considerable funds form the land granted under Letters Patent, failing to maintain or improve the school until it was exposed in the Court of Chancery in 1734. Around 1750 a new building was erected for the school in Broad Street.\n\nThe secondary school relocated from its site at Broad Street in central Bath in the 1960s to a site at North Road in the southeastern edge of the city, previously occupied by St Christopher's Preparatory School. The junior school (7- to 11-year-olds) remained on the Broad Street site until the summer of 1990 (often mis-quoted as 1986, possibly due to errors originally made in an architectural report from the early 2000s and repeated by the local Planning Office) when it transferred to a new building in the North Road school grounds. The old Broad Street site, which was built in 1754 by Thomas Jelly and is a Grade II* Listed building, remains empty. In 1997 an application to turn the building into a public house by Samuel Smith Brewery was refused. A scheme for use as a hotel has also been withdrawn. The building remains on the Heritage at Risk Register but work to repair the roof has reduced the risk to the property. Proposals to use it as a temporary shelter for the homeless were rejected in 2018, by the brewery, claiming that work would be \"commencing very soon\".\n\nIn the 1990s, while Peter Winter was Headmaster the school took the steps towards full co-education. In 2005 there were plans to move the 'pre-preparatory' school, located in Weston, Bath, on to the North Road site. However, for a range of reasons it never materialised. In 2008 the school achieved the best examination results of Bath schools for A level and GCSE examination results.\n\nThe Senior and Junior School is situated on a 19-acre campus, with views across Bath. The school is made up of several buildings. The main block (Q) is the primary building used for English, Maths, Music, Physics and Chemistry. The main block also incorporates the Wroughton Theatre. Nethersole House, which was built in the 19th century, now houses the Religious and Philosophical Studies department, Classics, History, Business Studies and Economics and Learning Support, as well as the Headmaster's Study and Reception. The Holbeche Centre is home to the Sixth Form centre, as well as Art and Design & Technology classrooms. The Porter Library, now the home of the Geography department since the completion of the Wessex Building in 2015, is next door. The sports hall at the bottom of the site is used for assemblies, as well as sports. The senior school opened a new building (B Block) in September 2008 which accommodates many of the major departments including Biology, Modern Languages and ICT. The Wessex Building is located to the north of Nethersole House and was opened in 2015 by the Earl of Wessex and holds the Library, dining hall and a conference suite. The school opened its newest sporting facility, an all-weather pitch, in November 2016 by Rio Olympic gold medalist, Crista Cullen. In 2019 the schools newest facility was opened. The Rose is a new drama centre with state of the art technology and facilities. It is located at the bottom of the school below the lower entrance.\n\nThe school includes both drama and music departments. The drama department puts on a school play each year and recent performances have included Fiddler on the Roof and Pride and Prejudice. There is also a lower school play which is aimed for pupils in years 7 to 9 and regularly has casts of up to 80 pupils which recently included The Wind in the Willows and Disney's Beauty and The Beast. The School has also recently introduced LAMDA exams and taken a show to the Edinburgh Fringe.\n\nIn late 2017 the school performed \"Pop the Musical\", a show written by the school based on a book by author Catherine Bruton, who teaches English at the school.\n\nThe Music department currently has over 20 instrumental and choral groups of varying musical styles. The school has partnerships with Bath Abbey and Bath's resident orchestra, Bath Philharmonia Orchestra, with annual concert performances in Bath’s historical venues including The Assembly Rooms and the Guildhall.\n\nEvery year the Music department organises the KES Musical Festival which includes concerts throughout Bath as well as numerous performances and concerts in the school itself. The Senior Orchestra was also the overall winner for orchestral music in the Mid Somerset Festival in 2006, 2007, 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012.\n\nThe school has a further 17-acre site at nearby Bathampton, which is home to the school's playing fields and sports pavilion. The major games are rugby, hockey, cricket and netball. Minor sports include athletics, cross-country, tennis, football, rounders, badminton, dance, gymnastics and table tennis. Former England rugby coach Andy Robinson used to teach rugby, physical education and mathematics at the school while he was playing (amateur rugby) for Bath Rugby Club.\n\nIn previous years the school had competitive netball squads over a range of school years. In particular, the under 19 squad came third at the national finals in both 2009 and 2010. Alternative sports such as jiu jitsu and squash are also played.\n\nThe school also has a Combined Cadet Force (CCF) which was formerly affiliated with the Light Infantry is now affiliated to the King's Royal Hussars (Royal Armoured Corps). Having been founded in 1900, King Edward's CCF is one of the oldest CCF contingents in the country. In recent years the CCF has also included cadets from Beechen Cliff School and from 2015 to 2019 it also welcomed pupils from Hayesfield Girl School. Pupils, both girls and boys, may join the CCF from year 9 onwards and enjoy a range of activities each week developing skills which can be put into practice on a number of excursions, including multi-day CCF-run exercises on Army training grounds, as well as Combined Cadet Force and Army Cadet Force-run camps throughout the year, in each March, September, July and November.\nIn 2019 the CCF formed a Corps of Drums, and since then has been taking cadets on ACF and CCF-run music training camps.\nThe Cadet Force is one of the cadet forces which are involved in Bath's annual Remembrance Sunday ceremonies, involving attending the main ceremonial parade and a march through the city streets, which has since 2019 included performance by the Corps of Drums.\n\nKing Edward's School and Wagwer School in Kenya are global development partnership schools, part of the Department for International Development (DFID) initiative, which seeks to encourage an understanding and knowledge of the world though exchange visits and joint curricular work. Under the scheme which is sponsored by the British Government teachers from Kenya are able to visit KES and teachers from KES are able to visit Wagwer.\n\nThe school also runs exchange programmes with schools in Aix-en-Provence (France), Braunschweig (Germany) and Pamplona (Spain).\n\nThe school also produced two Olympians who represented Great Britain for the 2012 London Olympic Games.\n\nIn 2001, the school made national headlines after 26 pupils were taught the wrong Shakespeare play (\"Hamlet\") in preparation for an A-level examination. The mistake was only realised after the pupils had entered the examination hall. The OCR exam board decided to award their marks according to previous papers and coursework.\n\nIn 2002, a 14-year-old girl had to be taken to hospital with alcohol poisoning during a trip to France.\n\nFormer pupils of the school are called Old Edwardians and include:\n"}

He lived in exile from Singapore after facing lawsuits from Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore's first Prime Minister. He was educated at Saint Joseph's Institution in Singapore and at the Middle Temple in London, and was a Visiting Fellow at Harvard Law School.\n\nSeow was born on 11 October 1928 in Singapore. He joined the Singapore Legal Service in 1956 and rose through the ranks to become the Solicitor-General in 1969, a position he held until 1971. Seow led a Commission of Inquiry in the Secondary IV examination boycott by Chinese students in 1963. For his work, Seow was awarded the Public Administration (Gold) Medal. He eventually left the public service and entered private law practice in 1972.\n\nIn 1985, Seow defended Tan Mui Choo (whose name was mistakenly reported as \"Choo Choo\" in the Malaysian press), Adrian Lim's first wife and accomplice in the Toa Payoh ritual murders, while she was on trial. Tan was eventually executed after an unsuccessful appeal against her conviction and death sentence.\n\nIn 1973, Seow was suspended from law practice for 12 months by the Chief Justice, Wee Chong Jin, for allegedly breaching an undertaking given on behalf of his junior law partner to the Attorney-General, Tan Boon Teik. Nevertheless, he was later elected as a member of the Council of the Law Society in 1976 and became its President in 1986.\n\nSeow's new appointment led to a falling-out with Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore's first Prime Minister, after he became embroiled in the politics surrounding the role of the Law Society. He had envisaged a restoration of the role of the Law Society to comment on legislation that the government churned out without any meaningful parliamentary debate, to which Lee took special exception. As a result, Lee caused special legislation to be passed that deprived the Law Society of any power to comment on legislation unless specifically asked to by the government. Seow stood for the 1988 general election as a member of the opposition Workers' Party team that contested in Eunos Group Representation Constituency against the ruling People's Action Party (PAP). However, his team managed to secure 49.11% of valid votes and lost marginally to the PAP.\n\nJust before the election, on 6 May 1988, Seow was detained without trial under the Internal Security Act for 72 days. He was accused of having received political campaign finance from the United States to promote democracy in Singapore. According to his account, he was subjected to torture, including sleep deprivation and intensely cold air conditioning. Later, while awaiting trial for alleged tax evasion, he left for the United States for health treatment and disregarded numerous court summons to return to stand trial. Subsequently, he was convicted \"in absentia\". While living in exile, Seow spoke at events organised by Singaporean student societies in universities outside of Singapore.\n\nIn a 1989 interview in London, Seow told \"The Sunday Times\" that he would return to Singapore to face tax evasion charges.\n\nOn 16 October 2007, Amnesty International issued a public statement mentioning Seow as one of two prominent Singaporean lawyers who were penalised for exercising their right to express their opinions. Amnesty International also called him a \"prisoner of conscience.\"\n\nOn 8 October 2011, Seow and Tang Fong Har publicly addressed a Singapore Democratic Party forum via teleconferencing. The Singapore police investigated the legality of the event on the following day.\n\nSeow died on 21 January 2016 at the age of 87. Chee Soon Juan, the secretary-general of the Singapore Democratic Party, announced the news of Seow's death on his Facebook page. Seow was survived by two sons, Ashleigh and Andre, and two daughters, Ingrid Annalisa and Amara. Ingrid and Ashleigh are from his Finnish wife, Rauni Marjatta Kivilaakso, who died in 1988 after a long battle with cancer.\n\nIn the semi-autobiography, \"To Catch a Tartar: A Dissident in Lee Kuan Yew's Prison\", Seow wrote about his career in the Singapore Legal Service, opposition politics and his personal experience of being detained by the Internal Security Department. He also accuses the Singaporean government of authoritarianism and human rights abuse under Lee Kuan Yew's administration. The book also contains a foreword by Devan Nair, the third President of Singapore, that is equally critical of the Singaporean government. Seow also wrote another book, \"The Media Enthralled\", which describes how he believes the Singaporean government undermined freedom of the media and turned the media into pro-government mouthpieces. He is also the author of \"Beyond Suspicion? – The Singapore Judiciary\" that explores key cases in which the Singaporean judiciary has bowed to political pressure.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1794838", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1794838", "title": "Gerundive", "text": "Gerundive\n\nIn Latin grammar, a gerundive () is a verb form that functions as a verbal adjective.\n\nIn Classical Latin, the gerundive is distinct in form and function from the gerund and the present active participle. In Late Latin, the differences were largely lost, resulting in a form derived from the gerund or gerundive but functioning more like a participle. The adjectival gerundive form survives in the formation of progressive aspect forms in Italian, Spanish and Brazilian Portuguese and some southern/insular dialects of European Portuguese. In French the adjectival gerundive and participle forms merged completely, and the term \"gérondif\" is used for adverbial use of \"-ant\" forms.\n\nThere is no true equivalent to the gerundive in English; the closest translation is a passive to-infinitive non-finite clause such as \"books to be read\". That reflects the most common use of the Latin gerundive, to combine a transitive verb (such as \"read\") and its object (such as \"books\"), usually with a sense of obligation.\nAnother translation is the recent development of the \"must-\" prefix as in \"a must-read book\".\n\nThe Latin gerundive is a form of the verb. It is composed of \nFor example\n\nRelated gerund forms are composed in a similar way with nominal inflexional endings.\n\nIn principle, the gerundive could express a wide range of meaning relationships: 'capable of, 'prone to', 'ripe for' (killing, dying, rising, rolling etc). Some gerundives have much the same meaning as present participles: \"secundus\" 'following'; \"oriundus\" 'arising, descended from'; \"volvendus\" 'rolling'. Originally it could express active or passive meaning, and therefore could be used with verbs in intransitive as well as transitive use. However, the great majority of gerundive forms were used with passive meaning of transitive verbs.\n\nThe gerundive could be used as either a predicative or an attributive adjective. However, attributive use was rare, largely confined to verbs expressing approval or disapproval. The predicative use invited a secondary meaning of obligation (a meaning not shared with the gerund). Thus:\n\nThis sense of obligation with passive meaning is by far the most common use of the gerundive. Thus it has been equated with a future passive participle.\n\nA neuter form without a noun may function as an impersonal expression, for example: \"addendum\" 'something to be added'; \"referendum\" 'something to be referred back'. These are not gerund forms; the -um form of the gerund is used only after prepositions. The plural forms without nouns such as \"agenda\" 'things to be done' are also adjectival gerundives; the gerund has no plural form.\n\nFor details of the formation and usage of the Latin gerundive, see and .\n\n\nIn Late Latin, the distinction between gerundive and future participle was sometimes lost. Thus, gerundive \"moriendi\" is found for \"morituri\" 'about to die'. Conversely, future particles \"recepturus\" and \"scripturus\" are found for \"recipientus\" and \"scriptures\". More regularly, the gerundive came to be used as a future passive participle. Eventually the gerundive in the nominative case came to substitute for the present participle.\n\nThe term is occasionally used in descriptions of English grammar, to denote the present participle used adjectivally or adverbially e.g. 'take a running jump'. That form, ending in \"-ing\", is identical to that of the English gerund, but it is generally called a gerund when it is used as a noun, not as an adjective or adverb e.g. 'the running of the deer'.\n\nIn Old Irish, a form known in the literature as the \"verbal of necessity\" is used as the predicate of the copula in the function of the Latin gerundive, e.g. \"\" \"the things that are to be admired\".\n\nThe term \"gerundive\" may be used in grammars and dictionaries of Pali, for example the Pali Text Society's Pali-English Dictionary of 1921-25. It is referred to by some other writers as the \"participle of necessity\", the \"potential participle\" or the \"future passive participle\". It is used with the same meaning as the Latin gerundive.\n\nIn the east African Semitic language Tigrinya, \"gerundive\" is used to denote a particular finite verb form, not a verbal adjective or adverb. Generally, it denotes completed action that is still relevant. A verb in the gerundive can be used alone or serially with another gerundive verb. In the latter case, it may sometimes be translated with an adverbial clause: \"bitri hidju kheydu\" (literally, \"a-stick he-took-hold-of he-began-walking\") means \"while holding a stick, he is walking\", i.e. \"he is carrying a stick\". See Tigrinya verbs.\n\nThe following pages provide definitions or glosses of the term \"gerundive\":\n"}

She developed an interest in jazz from an early age, through her father's collection of 78rpm records, becoming \"obsessed\" with big band singers like Ella Fitzgerald and big bands like Joe Loss. She took music lessons, first on the electronic organ, then more formally on clarinet, before studying music at Wolverhampton University. While at university, Teal found herself without a clarinet for an unexpected examination. Deciding to sing instead, she not only got her \"best grades ever\", but discovered that she loved singing in public. After graduation, she started a career in advertising, singing in her spare time with amateur and semi-professional bands.\n\nTeal's break came when she was asked to stand in for Stacey Kent at a weekend festival in Llandrindod Wells. This led (after some determined self-promotion, in which she drew upon her advertising skills) to a three-album contract with the jazz label Candid Records. Her popularity soared, with appearances on radio and television bringing her to the attention of a wider public, and in 2004 she released her first album for Sony Jazz in what was the biggest recording deal by any British jazz singer. \"Don't Talk\" topped the jazz charts and entered the UK Top 20 UK Albums Chart.\n\nWhile the majority of her recordings are cover versions of standards, her albums feature original songs and contemporary cover versions, notably a cover of \"California Dreaming\" by The Mamas & the Papas. This song attracted the attention of BBC Radio presenter Michael Parkinson, garnering significant publicity during her period with Candid Records.\n\nTeal has toured throughout the UK and the world, with her pianist, trio, mini big band, or Hollywood Orchestra. She has worked with the Hallé Orchestra, BBC Concert Orchestra, RTÉ Concert Orchestra, and the John Wilson Orchestra as well as other top big bands. In August 2017, she produced and presented her third concert for The Proms. Swing No End featured two big bands and many special guests. It was broadcast on BBC Radio 2, BBC Radio 3, and televised on BBC Four.\n\nFrom 2006-2013 Teal presented the BBC Radio 2 show, \"Big Band Special\".

Sandberg has been a member of the Norwegian parliament since 1997 (since 2005 from the Sør-Trøndelag constituency, and before that from Nord-Trøndelag), and served as chair of the parliamentary standing committees on Justice, and Transport and Communications. He has additionally held the position of first deputy leader of the Progress Party from 2006 to 2018. In 1997 he was convicted of assault and battery of an asylum seeker. His status as a convicted felon has made him controversial in Norwegian politics.\n\nAn outspoken politician with a blue-collar working background, Sandberg has stoked controversy on numerous occasions, and has been described, by former party chairman Carl I. Hagen as well as the media, as the \"proto-typical Progress Party person\" ().\n\nSandberg was born in Levanger, Nord-Trøndelag to self-employed businessman Rolf Sandberg (1926–2010) and part-time worker Rannveig Ertsås (1930–2006). He has three siblings, sister Mona, and brothers Harald and Stig (Stig committed suicide in 1997).\n\nHe has described his upbringing as \"rough\", partly due to his father, who he describes as being \"incredibly strict and manipulative\". According to Sandberg, his father would regularly lock him up in the outhouse or the cellar as punishment. He would also resort to corporal punishment on his siblings regularly. So great was the abuse, that Sandberg claims: \"Had my father acted like that today, child welfare would have been there. And it would have been an immediate takeover by the child protection services\".\n\nAfter finishing Upper Secondary school, he held numerous different jobs including as a bartender and waiter at a Ski resort in Ustaoset, and later as a process operator at Norske Skog Skogn from 1982 to 1997, where he became the local trade union representative. In 1981 he settled in Levanger. Sandberg was in the service of UNIFIL in Southern Lebanon in 1986 during the Lebanese civil war, where he worked as a cook.\n\nSandberg modestly started his career in the Progress Party by lending his name to the party's local list in Levanger, as a favour to a friend, for the 1987 municipal election, but surprisingly ended up securing a seat in the municipal assembly. He had originally joined the party after meeting resistance from public regulations when trying to build a house earlier in the 1980s. He was a member of the Nord-Trøndelag county council from 1995 to 1997, until the 1997 parliamentary election in which he secured the party nomination, beating his friend (and future minister) Robert Eriksson. During the election campaign, he attended BBQs and events through the whole constituency in a borrowed Volvo 240 with only party stickers as election material. He ended up, winning the seat, with 140 votes ahead of the Center Party favourite Marit Arnstad.\n\nServing as a member of the Storting since 1997, the first terms from Nord-Trøndelag, he has since 2005 been represented from the neighbouring county of Sør-Trøndelag. Sandberg chaired the parliamentary Standing Committee on Justice from 2009 to 2013, and from 2005 to 2009 chaired the Standing Committee on Transport and Communications. He became deputy leader of the Progress Party in 2006.\n\nWhile being central in the negotiations leading to the Progress Party joining the Solberg Cabinet after the 2013 election, Sandberg claimed to have turned down offers for two different cabinet positions. On 28 October 2013, Sandberg announced that he was stepping down as deputy leader of the party in 2014, citing a \"...lack of motivation to continue the work\", but in early 2014 retracted his statement and said he would continue.\n\nShortly after making his later retracted announcement to step down as deputy leader, Sandberg published his political autobiography \"Mot min vilje - oppklaringen av et politisk liv\" (\"Against my will - clarification of a political life\"), in which he severely criticised several members of the Progress Party, as well as the political direction the party had taken following the 2011 Norway attacks.\n\nOn 16 December 2015 Sandberg was appointed Minister of Fisheries in Solberg's Cabinet.\n\nOn 20 March 2018 Sandberg was appointed as acting Minister of Justice, Public Security and Immigration in Solberg's Cabinet after Sylvi Listhaug resigned. He was later succeeded by Tor Mikkel Wara.\n\nSandberg has been highly critical of newer prisons such as the Halden prison, which he claims to have \"hotel-standard\", this according to him being a mockery against most people. He has also been critical of the fact that the prison have better facilities than most public nursing homes and child protection institutions. In addition he has claimed that criminal foreigners and Eastern European gangs \"laugh\" at the Norwegian prison conditions.\n\nSandberg proposed in 1999 that the government should be able to expel foreigners from Norway if their children committed serious crimes. In 2002 he proposed a complete stop of immigration from countries outside the Schengen Area.\n\nIn 2003, Sandberg stated that \"different races, religions and cultures must not be mixed\" if there are to be a \"harmonious society in Norway\", leading to strong reactions from other politicians. Sandberg in addition claimed to have backing for his statements from the chief of police, which caused the chief of police to strongly distance herself from Sandberg's claims. Sandberg also made the claim that ethnic Norwegians would soon become a minority in Norway.\n\nThe same year he also proposed to introduce electronic tags on asylum seekers to stop them from escaping while their asylum application is processed. Sandberg has also feared the growth of Muslims in Norway, and claimed that certain areas could eventually be subdued to Sharia law.\n\nSandberg has been accused of stirring up anti-Roma sentiment by stating, in 2013: \"At the borders, police can [under existing laws] stop organized groups of Roma, Bulgarians or French because we know from experience that these people disrupt the peace and it has also been proven that many of them engage in criminal activities.\"\n\nIn 2007 Sandberg claimed Al Gore of being \"a big fraud\", a \"Christian-fundamentalist\" and \"super-capitalist who have earned over 600 million NOK on the climate cause\".\n\nSandberg in 2014 claimed Norway's Crown Prince Haakon of being a \"leftist\", which he says has strengthened his position against the monarchy.\n\nHe made headlines when in January 1997 he headbutted and punched an asylum seeker from Yugoslavia in the face after the latter had called him \"pale-white, fat and rich\" and \"racist\". Sandberg was fined 3,000 NOK.\n\nIn mid-autumn 2006, Sandberg, who then was his party's spokesman for transport, was caught driving at a speed of 100 km/h in a 60 km/h zone i Målselv in Troms fylke, for which he got a suspended sentence of 21 days, lost his driver's license for eight months and was fined NOK 9,000.\n\nOn 12 December 2006 Sandberg addressed the Norwegian parliament having consumed three shots of Akvavit and a beer. The president of the parliament, Thorbjørn Jagland, said that \"to address parliament under the influence of alcohol is something one just does not do. It has got to do with respect for parliament and for one self\". The incident caused a media sensation. As a result of this incident, subsequent intense pressure from the media, heavy workload and losing his mother around the same time, Sandberg later wrote that he slipped into a depression, and that he contemplated suicide, only to be saved at the last minute by a phone call from his fiancé. Sandberg would later claim that Thorbjørn Jagland himself had been consuming red wine along with the rest of the presidency at the time, before they voted in parliament.\n\nIn November 2011, in the middle of a public Labour-Progress feud and a heated session in parliament, Sandberg accused the Labour Party of exploiting the Utøya massacre for political gain. This caused Labour party member Helga Pedersen to storm out of the parliament, apparently weeping, while others left the session. Sandberg immediately apologized for the comments, which was accepted. Party leader Siv Jensen also publicly apologized on Sandbergs behalf the next day, before launching another attack at the Labour Party leadership.\n\nDuring the Progress Party's annual congress in 2013, according to newspaper \"Verdens Gang\", Sandberg had to be pulled off another senior party member after Sandberg reportedly had forced the other politician against a wall while shouting angrily at him. The dispute was thought to be part of a years-long internal dispute in the party's Troms chapter.\n\nIn late July 2018 Sandberg went on an unannounced private vacation to Iran while still serving as Minister of Fisheries. Accompanying him on the trip was 28-year old Bahareh Letnes (née Nasserabad), an Iranian-born woman who had immigrated to Norway in her teens and subsequently was adopted by a Norwegian couple. Maritime business newspaper Fiskeribladet first reported on the case and wrote that Letnes was registered as the owner of a company involved in the exporting of seafood. Multiple politicians reacted to the news and questioned Sandberg's relation to Letnes, whether a conflict of interest existed, as well as whether the trip was approved by the prime ministers office. Sandberg explained that the trip as planned last-minute after his initial plan to vacation in Turkey was scrapped, this was due to an ongoing conflict with his estranged wife and that he informed the prime minister only after he had arrived in Iran.\n\nPrime Minister Erna Solberg later informed the Storting that Sandberg had violated government regulations by not notifying his ministry about the vacation. Criticism towards Sandberg also increased after it was revealed that he had declined the security briefing that the Norwegian Police Security Service usually provide for Norwegian politicians who travel to countries where there is a high risk of espionage. Sandberg proceeded to break protocol by bringing his work phone along to Iran, and while he first claimed that he had hardly used it, he had in fact sent 153 text messages and made 22 phone calls. Many politicians, including party colleges Mazyar Keshvari and Christian Tybrig-Gjedde, also criticised Sandberg for seemingly \"glorying\" the Iranian regime when he appeared on a radio show where he spoke warmly of Iran as a travel destination. The criticism also increased when it was revealed that Sandberg, in February 2018, had accompanied Letnes to an event organized by the Iranian embassy in Norway that celebrated the Iranian revolution of 1979.\n\nAfter weeks of mounting pressure from the media, opposition and fellow politicians Sandberg resigned as cabinet minister and First deputy leader of the Progress Party on 13 August.\n\nSandberg has on several occasions been the victim of physical assaults. In January 2008, Sandberg was physically assaulted by being gripped by the throat and kicked by a man outside the Norwegian parliament. He managed to escape as Socialist Left politician Hallgeir Langeland happened to be nearby and came to his rescue. In July the same man, who had mental problems and had been given residence permit in Norway on humanitarian grounds, also punched down Labour Party politician Knut Storberget.\n\nOn another occasion, three men approached him, along with his political aide at a restaurant in Oslo, and according to Sandberg \"was ready to attack\", the situation was resolved when the men were evicted from the restaurant and Sandberg was promptly whisked out the back-door. On 27 March 2009, he was attacked by three youths while riding the tram in Oslo. The attack ceased when fellow passengers came to his rescue, the attackers fled before the police arrived.\n\nWhile working at Ustaoset in 1976, he met Danish waitress Ulla Kjær Frandsen. They have two children together. He married his first wife, Line Miriam Sandberg (née Haugan) on 7 August 2010. Together they have a son. He used to divide his time three-way between his parliamentary office in Oslo, his parliamentary constituency in Sør-Trøndelag and his home in Lenvik, Troms, on the island of Senja, where he used to live with his family. The commute from his home in Senja, which covers a 3,160 km long flight, was called \"one of Norway's most extreme daily commutes\" as he commuted the trip on a daily basis during the weeks of the 2013 government coalition negotiations. In May 2018 Sandberg separated from his wife and relocated from their home in Senja to a flat in Mandal. In August 2018 Sandberg confirmed that he was in a relationship with businesswoman Bahareh Letnes and that they were in the process of moving in together.\n"}

Subsequent to it, he has been a doctoral student and an interpreter.\n\nHe travelled to Germany in 1997, and to the Netherlands at least as recently as 2000. The supervision of his PhD thesis in development economics was completed in 2006.\n\nHe read physics at Nanyang University and upon graduating he worked briefly as a secondary school teacher and then as a graduate assistant at his alma mater.\n\nAs a member of the Barisan Sosialis he was elected member of the Legislative Assembly for Jurong Constituency in 1963, being nominated as the candidate in replacement of a colleague who had been arrested by the government of Singapore. Concurrent with his holding of office, he worked as a university physics professor.\n\nHe was banned permanently from entering Malaysia in the wake of a political speech he delivered to the Perak division of the Labour Party of Malaysia on 24 April 1966.\nIn July 1966, he was convicted for publishing a \"seditious article\" in the Barisan's Chinese-language newspaper. In the same month, he was arrested with 25 others and charged with unlawful assembly for his participation in a demonstration against United States involvement in the Vietnam War that resulted in open confrontation with police. It has been noted that he was active among peace campaigners calling for an end to the US bombing of Indochina during the Vietnam War in the 1960s.\n\nIn early October 1966, he and eight other Barisan Sosialis MPs boycotted the Parliament over the decision by the ruling People's Action Party (PAP) to split from Malaysia. This was part of the Barisan's strategy to protest \"undemocratic acts\" of the Government, by carrying their struggle against the PAP outside of Parliament. He declared that the means of the struggle would be \"street demonstrations, protest meetings, strikes\".\n\nOn 8 October 1966, he led an illegal protest march of 30 supporters to Parliament House and handed a letter to the Clerk of the House demanding a general election be held under eight named conditions, with the release of all political detainees and the revocation of all \"undemocratic\" laws.\n\nOn 29 October 1966, he and 22 other Barisan Sosialis leaders were arrested pursuant to powers afforded by the Internal Security Act. The official statement released by the Government alleged that Barisan's attempt to arouse a mass struggle outside of parliament was prejudicial to the stability of Singapore. The round of arrests was the second one conducted by the government, including those occurring as part of Operation Coldstore in 1963. Chia was specifically detained for his role in organising and leading the street procession on 8 October.\n\nThe other detainees were released eventually after they each signed a document promising to renounce violence and sever ties with the Communist Party of Malaya (CPM). However, he refused as he felt that signing such a document would imply that he was affiliated with the CPM and, in his own words: \"to renounce violence is to imply you advocated violence before. If I had signed that statement I would not have lived in peace.\" Thus, in time, and without ever being the subject of an indictment or a criminal trial, he became one of the longest-serving political prisoners in the world – with some consequent restrictions upon his civil rights remaining in place for a total of more than 32 years subsequent to his initial arrest. The length of his detention has been compared to that of Nelson Mandela, who was imprisoned for a total period longer than 27 years subsequent to his arrest, trial and convictions for treason, sabotage and other political crimes.\n\nHe was deprived of Singapore citizenship in February 1968 as he could not produce a birth certificate to substantiate his claim that he was born in Singapore in 1933. He was served with a Banishment Order in August 1968.\nHe remained detained in the Queenstown Remand Prison \"awaiting deportation\" until 1976, when the Banishment Order was dropped and he was served with a fresh detention order under the ISA in June that year.\n\nDuring his incarceration, he spent substantial time in solitary confinement at the Whitley Road Detention Centre. In late 1978, Amnesty International confirmed that he was detained at the Moon Crescent Detention Centre located within the grounds of Changi Prison.\n\nIn 1982, he was moved out of prison and into a series of government halfway houses.\n\nIn 1985, the government of Singapore asserted that the purpose of his detention related to the allegation that he had been a member of the CPM and suggested that he was therefore willing to participate in anti-Singapore political violence and terrorism.\n\nOn 17 May 1989, he was released from 23 years of imprisonment without charge or trial on the mainland, and instead confined to a one-room guardhouse on Sentosa where he was required to pay the rent on the pretext that he was then a \"free\" man. He was also required to purchase and prepare his own food. As he had no money, he was offered a job as the assistant curator of Fort Siloso on the West of the island. He refused the offer on the understanding that it was a government civil service position in which he may, as a result, be \"muzzled\" from talking to the media without official permission. Instead, he negotiated an arrangement where he worked as a freelance translator for the Sentosa Development Corporation. About that time he made the following remarks about the circumstances of his continuing detention and the culture of politics in Singapore in general:\n\nIn 1990, there was some relaxation of the restrictions applying to him. Chia has stated his belief that representations by Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany in the mid-1980s played some part in the Singaporean government's decision to soften its stance in regard to him.\n\nIn 1992, he was allowed to return to the mainland and visit the home of his parents, but was still placed under restrictions on travel, activities and associations.\n\nIn November 1997, restrictions were further relaxed to an extent that allowed him to accept a fellowship from the Hamburg Foundation of the German government for politically persecuted persons. He subsequently spent a year in Hamburg studying economics, politics, and German language. He was also permitted to change his address and to seek employment without prior permission of the director of Singapore's Internal Security Department.\n\nIn August 1998, he underwent a prostate operation in Singapore.\n\nIn November 1998, it was reported that the source of his income was the work that he performed as a freelance translator.\n\nOn 27 November 1998, all remaining restrictions were nullified. He thus formally regained rights to make public statements, address public meetings, and participate in political activity. He immediately called upon the Government to repeal the Internal Security Act and expressed his interest in becoming involved in political activity.\n\nOn 27 November 1998, Amnesty International issued a public statement that restrictions on \"Singapore's longest serving prisoner of conscience\" had been lifted. Amnesty International considered the announcement to be more than thirty years' overdue.\n\nIn late 2000, he was pursuing a master's degree in development studies at the Institute of Social Studies in The Hague and expected to complete those studies and return to Singapore in December of that year.\n\nIn 2006 the supervision of his PhD thesis through the Institute was completed and he has been conferred his doctorate.\n\nA March 2008 version of his staff profile at the ISS describes his position as \"Project assistant to the project MPA in Governance, Surinam\".\n\nIn late 2011 he was awarded the Lim Lian Geok Spirit Award at a public ceremony in Kuala Lumpur.\n\nIn 2015 he was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1794863", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1794863", "title": "LGBT rights in Iran", "text": "LGBT rights in Iran\n\nLesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people in the Islamic Republic of Iran face legal challenges not experienced by non-LGBT residents. While people can legally change their sex, sexual activity between members of the same sex is illegal and can be punishable by death.\n\nLGBT rights in Iran have come in conflict with the penal code since the 1930s. In post-revolutionary Iran, any type of sexual activity outside a heterosexual marriage is forbidden. Same-sex sexual activities are punishable by imprisonment, corporal punishment, or execution. Gay men have faced stricter enforcement actions under the law than lesbians.\n\nTransgender identity is recognized through a sex reassignment surgery. Sex reassignment surgeries are partially financially supported by the state. Some homosexual individuals in Iran have been pressured to undergo sex reassignment surgery in order to avoid legal and social persecution. Iran carries out more sex reassignment surgeries than any other country in the world after Thailand.\n\nAround 250 BC, during the Parthian Empire, the Zoroastrian text Vendidad was written. It contains provisions that are part of sexual code promoting procreative sexuality that is interpreted to prohibit same-sex intercourse as sinful. Ancient commentary on this passage suggests that those engaging in sodomy could be killed without permission from a high priest. However, a strong homosexual tradition in Iran is attested to by Greek historians from the 5th century onward, and so the prohibition apparently had little effect on Iranian attitudes or sexual behavior outside the ranks of devout Zoroastrians in rural eastern Iran.\n\nThere is a significant amount of literature in Persian that contain explicit same-sex illustrations. A few Persian love poems and texts from prominent medieval Persian poet Saadi Shirazi's \"Bustan\" and \"Gulistan\" have also been interpreted as homoerotic poems.\n\nUnder the rule of Mohammad Reza Shah, the last monarch of the Pahlavi dynasty, homosexuality was tolerated, even to the point of allowing news coverage of a same-sex wedding. Janet Afary has argued that the 1979 Revolution was partly motivated by moral outrage against the Shah's government, and in particular against a mock same-sex wedding between two young men with ties to the court. She says that this explains the virulence of the anti-homosexual oppression in Iran. After the 1979 Revolution, thousands of people were executed in public, including homosexuals.\n\nSince the 1979 Revolution, the legal code has been based on Islamic law. All sexual activities that occur outside a traditional, heterosexual marriage (i.e., sodomy or adultery) are illegal. Same-sex sexual activities that occur between consenting adults are criminalized and carry a maximum punishment of death—though not generally implemented. Rape, whether same-sex or opposite-sex, often results in execution, but is related to adultery and sodomy in Iran's penal code rather than being classified as \"sexual assault\". The death penalty is legal for those above 18, and if a murder was committed, legal at the age of 15. Approved by the Parliament on July 30, 1991, and finally ratified by the Guardian Council on November 28, 1991, articles 108 through 140 distinctly deal with same-sex sexual activities and their punishments in detail.\n\nAccording to Articles 108 to 113, sodomy (\"lavāt\") can in certain circumstances be a crime for which both partners can be punished by death. If the participants are adults, of sound mind and consenting, the method of execution is for the judge to decide. If one person is non-consenting (i.e., rape), the punishment would only apply to the rapist. A non-adult who engages in consensual sodomy is subject to a punishment of 74 lashes. Articles 114 to 119 assert that sodomy is proved either if a person confesses four times to having committed sodomy or by the testimony of four righteous men. Testimony of women alone or together with a man does not prove sodomy. According to Articles 125 and 126, if sodomy, or any lesser crime referred to above, is proved by confession and the person concerned repents, the judge may request that he be pardoned. If a person who has committed the lesser crimes referred to above repents before the giving of testimony by the witnesses, the punishment is quashed. The judge may punish the person for lesser crimes at his discretion.\n\nAccording to Articles 127, 129, and 130, the punishment for female same-sex sexual activity (\"mosāheqe\") involving persons who are mature, of sound mind and consenting, is 50 lashes. If the act is repeated three times and punishment is enforced each time, the death sentence will apply on the fourth occasion. Article 128 asserts that the ways of proving female same-sex sexual activity in court are the same as for sodomy. Article 130 says that both Muslims and non-Muslims are subject to the punishment. According to Articles 132 and 133, the rules for the quashing of sentences, or for pardoning, are the same as for the lesser male homosexual offenses. According to Article 134, women who \"stand naked under one cover without necessity\" and are not relatives may receive a punishment of 50 lashes.\n\nAt the discretion of the Iranian court, fines, prison sentences, and corporal punishment are usually carried out rather than the death penalty, unless the crime was a rape.\n\nThe charges of same-sex sexual activity have in a few occasions been used in political crimes. Other charges had been paired with the sodomy crime, such as rape or acts against the state, and convictions are obtained in grossly flawed trials. On March 14, 1994, famous dissident writer Ali Akbar Saidi Sirjani was charged with offenses ranging from drug dealing to espionage to homosexual activity. He died in prison under disputed circumstances.\n\nSome human rights activists and opponents of the government in Iran claim between 4,000 and 6,000 gay men and lesbians have been executed in Iran for crimes related to their sexual orientation since 1979. According to The Boroumand Foundation, there are records of at least 107 executions with charges related to homosexuality between 1979 and 1990. According to Amnesty International, at least 5 people convicted of \"homosexual tendencies\", three men and two women, were executed in January 1990, as a result of the government's policy of calling for the execution of those who \"practice homosexuality\".\n\nIn a November 2007 meeting with his British counterpart, Iranian member of parliament Mohsen Yahyavi admitted that the government in Iran believes in the death penalty for homosexuality. According to Yahyavi, gays deserve to be tortured, executed, or both.\n\nRape (\"tajāvoz\", \"zenā be onf\") is punishable by death by hanging. Ten to fifteen percent of executions in Iran are for rape. The rape victim may settle the case by accepting compensation (\"jirat\") in exchange for withdrawing the charges or forgiving the rapist. This is similar to \"diyya\", but equal to a woman's dowry. A woman can also receive \"diyya\" for injuries sustained. Normally, the rapist still faces tazir penalties, such as 100 lashes and jail time for immoral acts, and often faces further penalties for other crimes committed alongside the rape, such as kidnapping, assault, and disruption of public order.\n\nOn July 19, 2005, Mahmoud Asgari and Ayaz Marhoni two teenagers from the province of Khorasan were convicted by the court of having raped a 13-year-old boy were publicly hanged. The case attracted international media attention, and the British LGBT group OutRage! alleged that the teenagers were executed for consensual homosexual acts and not rape. It was disputed in the media as to whether the executions of the two teenagers, or that of three other men who were executed in 2011 in the province of Khuzestan, were punishment for other crimes or carried out specifically because of their same-sex sexual activity. Human Rights Watch, while condemning the executions of the juveniles, stated \"there is no evidence that this was a consensual act\", and observed that \"the bulk of evidence suggests that the youths were tried on allegations of raping a 13-year-old, with the suggestion that they were tried for consensual homosexual conduct seemingly based almost entirely on mistranslations and on cursory news reporting magnified by the Western press\". It also stated that it was \"deeply disturbed by the apparent indifference of many people to the alleged rape of a 13-year old\".\n\nAnother controversial execution was that of Makwan Moloudzadeh on December 6, 2007. He was convicted of \"lavāt be onf\" (sodomy rape) and executed for raping three teenage boys when he was 13, even though all witnesses had retracted their accusations and Moloudzadeh withdrew a confession. As a 13-year-old, he was ineligible for the death penalty under the law in Iran. Despite international outcry and a nullification of the death sentence by Chief Justice Ayatollah Seyed Mahmoud Hashemi Shahrud, Moloudzadeh was hanged without his family or his attorney being informed until after the fact. The execution provoked international outcry since it violated two international treaties signed by the government in Iran that outlaw capital punishment for crimes committed by minors—the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child.\n\nFew consenting participants of sodomy (\"lavāt\") are sentenced to death, but prior to 2012, both partners could receive the death penalty. On March 15, 2005, the daily newspaper \"Etemad\" reported that the Tehran Criminal Court sentenced two men to death following the discovery of a video showing them engaged in sexual acts. Another two men were allegedly hanged publicly in the northern town of Gorgan for sodomy in November 2005. In July 2006, two youths in north-eastern Iran were hanged for \"sex crimes\", probably consensual homosexual acts. On November 16, 2006, the State-run news agency reported the public execution of a man convicted of sodomy in the western city of Kermanshah.\n\nOn January 23, 2008, Hamzeh Chavi, 18, and Loghman Hamzehpour, 19, were arrested in Sardasht, West Azerbaijan, for homosexual activity. An on-line petition for their release began to circulate around the internet. They apparently confessed to the authorities that they were in a relationship and in love, prompting a court to charge them with \"mohārebe\" (\"waging war against God\") and \"lavāt\" (sodomy).\n\nThere were two reported crackdowns in Isfahan, Iran's third-largest city. On May 10, 2007, Isfahan police arrested 87 people at a birthday party, including 80 suspected gay men, beating and detaining them through the weekend. All but 17 of the men were released. Those who remained in custody were believed to have been wearing women's clothing. Photos of the beaten men were released by the Toronto-based Iranian Railroad for Queer Refugees. According to Human Rights Watch, in February 2008, the police in Isfahan raided a party in a private home and arrested 30 men, who were held indefinitely without a lawyer on suspicion of homosexual activity.\n\nIn April 2017, 30 men were arrested in a raid in Isfahan Province, \"charged with sodomy, drinking alcohol and using psychedelic drugs\".\n\nSame-sex marriage and civil unions are not legally recognized in Iran. Traditional Iranian families often exercise strong influence in who, and when, their children marry and even what profession they chose. Few LGBT Iranians come out to family for the fear of being rejected. No legislation exists to address discrimination or bias motivated violence on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity.\n\nTraditional Iranian families tend to prohibit their children from dating, as it is not a part of Iranian culture, although this has become somewhat more tolerated, among liberals. In 2004, an independent film was released, directed by Maryam Keshavarz, that examined the changing mores of Iranian youth when it comes to sex and dating.\n\nGay Iranian couples are often afraid to be seen together\n\nAs Article 20 in Clause 14 states, a person who has done a sex reassignment surgery can legally change their name and gender on the birth certification upon the order of court.\n\nThose who are in favor of legitimately being able to reassign one's sex surgically utilize article 215 of Iran's civil code, stating that the acts of every person should be subject to rational benefit, meaning gender reassignment surgery would be in the best interest of whomever is appealing for governmental support. Caveats, however, include the need to have medical approval from a doctor that supports a dissonance between assigned gender and their true gender.\n\nAlthough legally recognized by the current Supreme Leader in Iran, Grand Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Grand Ayatollah Yousef Madani Tabrizi addresses gender reassignment surgery as \"unlawful\" and \"not permissible by Sharia (Islamic law)\". Reasons for his contestation include the altering of God's creation and disfiguration of vital organs as being unlawful.\n\nIn Islam, the term \"mukhannathun\" (\"effeminate ones\") is used to describe gender-variant people, usually transgender people who are transitioning from male to female. Neither this term nor the equivalent for \"eunuch\" occurs in the Quran, but the term does appear in the Hadith, the sayings of Muhammad, which have a secondary status to the central text. Moreover, within Islam, there is a tradition on the elaboration and refinement of extended religious doctrines through scholarship.\n\nWhile Iran has outlawed homosexual activity, Iranian Shia thinkers such as Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini have allowed for transsexuals to reassign their sex so that they can enter heterosexual relationships. This position has been confirmed by the current Supreme Leader of Iran, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and is also supported by many other Iranian clerics. The state will pay a portion of the cost for a gender reassignment operation.\n\nSince the mid-1980s, the Iranian government has legalized the practice of sex reassignment surgery (under medical approval) and the modification of pertinent legal documents to reflect the reassigned gender. In 1983, Khomeini passed a fatwa allowing gender reassignment operations as a cure for \"diagnosed transsexuals\", allowing for the basis of this practice becoming legal. This religious decree was first issued for Maryam Khatoon Molkara, who has since become the leader of an Iranian transsexual organization. Hojatoleslam Kariminia, a mid-level Islamic cleric in Iran, is another advocate for transsexual rights, having called publicly for greater respect for the rights of Iranian transsexuals. However, transsexuality is still a taboo topic within Iranian society, and no laws exist to protect post-operative transsexuals from discrimination.\n\nSome homosexual individuals in Iran have been pressured to undergo sex reassignment surgery in order to avoid legal and social persecution. Tanaz Eshaghian's 2008 documentary \"Be Like Others\" highlighted this. The documentary explores issues of gender and sexual identity while following the personal stories of some of the patients at a gender reassignment clinic in Tehran. The film was featured at the Sundance Film Festival and the Berlin International Film Festival, winning three awards. Sarah Farizan's novel \"If You Could Be Mine\" explores the relationship between two young girls, Sahar and Nisrin, who live in Iran through gender identity and the possibility of undergoing gender reassignment surgery. In order for the two to be in an open relationship, Sahar considers surgery to work within the confines of law which permits relationships after transitioning due to the relationship being between a male and female.\n\nIn 2002, a book entitled \"Witness Play\" by Cyrus Shamisa was banned from shelves (despite being initially approved) because it said that certain notable Persian writers were homosexuals or bisexuals.\n\nIn 2004, the government in Iran loaned an Iranian collection of artwork that was locked away since the 1979 Revolution by the Tate Britain gallery for six months. The artwork included explicit homoerotic artwork by Francis Bacon and the government in Iran stated that upon its return, it would also be put on display in Iran.\n\nIn 2005, the Iranian Reformist paper \"Shargh\" was shut down by the government after it interviewed an Iranian author, living in Canada. While the interview never mentioned the sexual orientation of Saghi Ghahreman, it did quote her as stating that, \"sexual boundaries must be flexible... The immoral is imposed by culture on the body\". The conservative paper \"Kayhan\" attacked the interview and the paper, \"Shargh has interviewed this homosexual while aware of her sick sexual identity, dissident views and porno-personality.\" To avoid being permanently shut down, the paper issued a public apology stating it was unaware of the author's \"personal traits\" and promised to \"avoid such people and movements.\"\n\nThe government in Iran does not allow a political party or organization to endorse LGB rights. Vague support for LGBT rights in Iran has fallen to a handful of exiled political organizations.\n\nThe Green Party of Iran has an English translation of its website that states, \"Every Iranian citizen is equal by law, regardless of gender, age, race, nationality, religion, marital status, sexual orientation, or political beliefs\" and calls for a \"separation of state and religion\".\n\nThe Worker Communist Party of Iran homepage has an English translation of its manifesto that supports the right of \"All adults, women or men\" to be \"completely free in deciding over their sexual relationships with other adults. Voluntary relationship of adults with each other is their private affair and no person or authority has the right to scrutinize it, interfere with it or make it public\".\n\nThe leftist Worker's Way, the liberal Glorious Frontiers Party, and the center-right Constitutionalist Party of Iran have all expressed support for the separation of religion and the state, which might promote LGBT rights.\n\nIn 1972, scholar Saviz Shafai gave a public lecture on homosexuality at the Shiraz University and in 1976 would research sexual orientation and gender issues at Syracuse University. In the 1990s, he joined the first human rights group for LGBT Iranians, HOMAN, and continued his work until he died of cancer in 2000.\n\nIn 2001, an online Iranian LGBT rights organization called \"Rainbow\" was founded by Arsham Parsi, a well-known Iranian gay activist, followed by a clandestine organization named the \"Persian Gay and Lesbian Organization\". As of 2008, this group has been renamed as the \"Iranian Railroad for Queer Refugees\" (IRQR). While the founder of this group had to flee Iran and continue his work as an exile, there is an underground LGBT rights movement in Iran.\n\nAli Mafi, an openly gay Iranian-born comedian started his career in 2016. In all his shows, Ali mentions his status as an Iranian citizen and his commitment to being proud of who he is regardless. Ali currently resides in San Francisco, California, which hosts a prominent gay community.\n\nIn 2007, the Canadian CBC TV produced a documentary that interviewed several LGBT Iranians who talked about their struggles.\n\nDuring protests against the outcome of the Iranian election in July 2009, it was reported that several openly gay Iranians joined crowds of protesters in the United Kingdom and were welcomed with mostly positive attitudes towards LGBT rights.\n\nIn 2010, a group of LGBT activists inside Iran declared a day to be Iran Pride Day. The day is on the fourth Friday of July and is and celebrated annually in secret.\n\nAs of 2012, OutRight Action International develops an online resource for LGBTIQ Iranians in Persian.\n\nJoopeA organized the \"Iran in Amsterdam Pride\" as the \"Iran Boat\" () in the Amsterdam Gay Pride festival in 2017 and 2018. The Iran Boat won the \"Best of Pride Amsterdam 2018\" () award.\n\nDespite the deeply conservative character of the government in Iran, its efforts to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS have been quite progressive. The first official reports of HIV/AIDS in Iran were reported in 1987, and a government commission was formed, albeit it was not until the 1990s that a comprehensive policy began to arise.\n\nIn 1997, Dr. Arash Alaei and his brother, Kamiar, were given permission to open up a small office for HIV/AIDS research among prisoners and with a few years, despite public protests, they helped open the first general HIV/AIDS clinics. A booklet was approved, with explanation of condoms, and distributed to high school students. By the late 1990s, a comprehensive educational campaign existed. Several clinics opened up to offer free testing and counseling. Government funds were allocated to distribute condoms to prostitutes, clean needles and drug rehabilitation to addicts and programs aired on television advocating the use of condoms. While there are shortages, medication is given to all Iranian citizens free of charge.\n\nThe Alaei brothers were joined in their educational campaign by Dr. Minoo Mohraz, who was also an early proponent of greater HIV/AIDS education, who chairs a research center in Tehran. Along with government funding, UNICEF has funded several Iranian volunteer based groups that seek to promote greater education about the pandemic and to combat the prejudice that often follows Iranians who have it.\n\nIn June 2008, the Alaei brothers were detained, without charge, by the government in Iran, after attending an international conference on HIV/AIDS. The government has since accused the two doctors of attending the conference as part of a larger plotting to overthrow the government.\n\nIn 2007, the government in Iran stated that 18,320 Iranians had been infected with HIV, bringing the official number of deaths to 2,800, although critics claimed that the actual number might've been much higher. Officially, drug addiction is the most common way that Iranians become infected.\n\nWhile educational programs exist for prostitutes and drug addicts, no educational campaign for LGBT has been allowed to exist. In talking about the situation Kaveh Khoshnood stated, \"Some people would be able to talk about their own drug addiction or their family members, but they find it incredibly difficult to talk about homosexuality in any way\". \"If you're not acknowledging its existence, you're certainly not going to be developing any programs [for gays]\".\n\nSome middle-class Iranians have received an education in a Western nation. There is a small population of gay Iranian immigrants who live in Western nations.\n\nIn 2001, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights rejected a plea from an Iranian man who escaped from an Iranian prison after being convicted and sentenced to death for the crime of homosexual activity. Part of the problem with this case was that the man had entered the country illegally and was later convicted of killing his boyfriend, after he discovered that he had been unfaithful.\n\nIn 2005, the Japanese government rejected an asylum plea from another Iranian gay man. That same year, the Swedish government also rejected a similar claim by an Iranian gay man's appeal. The Netherlands is also going through a review of its asylum policies in regard to Iranians claiming to be victims of the anti-gay policies in Iran.\n\nIn 2006, the Netherlands stopped deporting gay men back to Iran temporarily. In March 2006, Dutch Immigration Minister Rita Verdonk said that it was now clear \"that there is no question of executions or death sentences based solely on the fact that a defendant is gay\", adding that homosexuality was never the primary charge against people. However, in October 2006, after pressure from both within and outside the Netherlands, Verdonk changed her position and announced that Iranian LGBTs would not be deported.\n\nThe United Kingdom came under fire for its continued deporting, especially due to news reports documenting gay Iranians who committed suicide when faced with deportation. Some cases have provoked lengthy campaigning on behalf of potential deportees, sometimes resulting in gay Iranians being granted asylum, as in the cases of Kiana Firouz and Mehdi Kazemi.\n\nIran's state media have shown their hatred toward homosexuality on many occasions. In particular, \"Mashregh News\", a news website \"close to the security and intelligence organizations\", has described homosexuals in an article as \"individuals who have become mentally troubled in natural human tendencies, have lost their balance, and require psychological support and treatment\".\n\nOne outlet, the website of Press TV, an English-language TV news channel owned by the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting, formerly had a written policy that banned homophobic comments.\n\nIn 2007, former president of Iran Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, speaking to Columbia University, stated that \"In Iran, we don't have homosexuals\", though a spokesperson later stated that his comments were misunderstood.\n\nIn a November 2007 meeting with his British counterpart, Iranian member of parliament Mohsen Yahyavi admitted that the government in Iran believes in the death penalty for homosexuality. According to Yahyavi, gays deserve to be tortured, executed, or both.\n\nIn June 2019, in a press conference held in Tehran between Mohammad Javad Zarif Minister of Foreign Affairs and Heiko Maas Minister of Foreign Affairs, openly gay German journalist Paul Ronzheimer of the tabloid Bild asked Zarif \"Why are homosexuals executed in Iran because of their sexual orientation?\", to which Zarif defended the execution of gay people on 'moral principles' by responding that his \"society has principles. And we live according to these principles. These are moral principles concerning the behavior of people in general, and that means that the law is respected and the law is obeyed.\"\n\nChildrenThe review noted many concerns, including discrimination against girls; children with disabilities; unregistered, refugee, and migrant children; and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex (LGBTI) minors.\n\nActs of Violence, Discrimination, and Other Abuses Based on Sexual Orientation and Gender IdentityThe law criminalizes consensual same-sex sexual activity, which is punishable by death, flogging, or a lesser punishment. The law does not distinguish between consensual and nonconsensual same sex intercourse, and NGOs reported this lack of clarity led to both the victim and the perpetrator being held criminally liable under the law in cases of assault. The law does not prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. \nSecurity forces harassed, arrested, and detained individuals they suspected of being gay or transgender. In some cases security forces raided houses and monitored internet sites for information on LGBTI persons. Those accused of “sodomy” often faced summary trials, and evidentiary standards were not always met. Punishment for same-sex sexual activity between men was more severe than between women. \nAccording to international and local media reports, on April 13 at least 30 men suspected of homosexual conduct were arrested by IRGC agents at a private party in Isfahan Province. The agents reportedly fired weapons and used electric Tasers during the raid. According to the Canadian-based nonprofit organization Iranian Railroad for Queer Refugees, those arrested were taken to Dastgerd Prison in Isfahan, where they were led to the prison yard and told they would be executed. The Iranian LGBTI activist group 6Rang noted that, following similar raids, those arrested and similarly charged were subjected to forced “anal” or “sodomy” tests and other degrading treatment and sexual insults.\n\nThe government censored all materials related to LGBTI issues. Authorities particularly blocked websites or content within sites that discussed LGBTI issues, including the censorship of Wikipedia pages defining LGBTI and other related topics. There were active, unregistered LGBTI NGOs in the country. Hate crime laws or other criminal justice mechanisms did not exist to aid in the prosecution of bias-motivated crimes.\n\nThe law requires all male citizens over age 18 to serve in the military but exempts gay and transgender women, who are classified as having mental disorders. New military identity cards listed the subsection of the law dictating the exemption.\n\nAccording to 6Rang this practice identified the men as gay or transgender and put them at risk of physical abuse and discrimination.\nThe government provided transgender persons financial assistance in the form of grants of up to 45 million rials $1,240 and loans up to 55 million rials $1,500 to undergo gender reassignment surgery. Additionally, the Ministry of Cooperatives, Labor, and Social Welfare required health insurers to cover the cost of such surgery. Individuals who undergo gender reassignment surgery may petition a court for new identity documents with corrected gender data, which the government reportedly provided efficiently and transparently. NGOs reported that authorities pressured LGBTI persons to undergo gender reassignment surgery.\n\n\n"}

The word is a portmanteau of the words \"sutgarak\" (, \"spoon\") and \"jeotgarak\" (, \"chopsticks\"). The \"sujeo\" set includes a pair of oval-shaped or rounded-rectangular metal (often stainless steel) chopsticks, and a long handled shallow spoon of the same material. One may use both at the same time, but this is a recent way to speed eating. It is not considered good etiquette to hold the spoon and the chopstick together in one hand especially while eating with elders. More often food is eaten with chopsticks alone. Sometimes the spoon apart from chopsticks is referred to as \"sujeo\".\n\nChopsticks may be put down on a table, but never put into food standing up, particularly rice, as this is considered to bring bad luck since it resembles food offerings to at a grave to deceased ancestors. The spoon may be laid down on the rice bowl, or soup bowl, if it has not been used. As food is eaten quickly, and portions are small, little time is spent in putting eating utensils down.\n\nCases for \"sujeo\" in paper or Korean fabrics were often embroidered with symbols of longevity and given as gifts, particularly at weddings. They are now sold as souvenirs.\n\n"}

A number of these pieces of these have won major awards.\n\nSome principal forms of online interactive video that have emerged are listed below.\n\nA number of interactive video technologies have been developed in the last few years that utilize a new way of encoding videos allowing users to add clickable hotspots to video.\n\nThere are also technologies that allow video producers to insert questions, calculations, results, lead capture, and personality assessments directly into the video experience. Interactivity that used to require post-production is now available to any video creator for their existing video content.\n\nIn April 2012, Canadian fashion retailer ssense.com partnered with interactive video technology company, WIREWAX, to release an interactive music video, featuring Iggy Azalea, Diplo and FKi, which was conceived from the outset as a marriage of art and commerce. All the styles featured in the video could be bought by clicking on the stars wearing them at any time the viewer saw an 'S' tag. The video was discussed on fashion blogs and in print.\n\nCustomizable videos allow the user to adjust some variables and then play a video customised to the user's particular preferences. However the user does not actually interact with the video while it is playing. Recent examples of this form of video include:\n\nConversational videos allow the user to interact with a video in a turn-based manner, almost as though the user was having a simple conversation with the characters in the video. Recent examples include:\n\nExploratory videos allow the user to move through a space or look at an object such as an artwork from multiple angles, almost as though the user was looking at the object in real life. The object or space is depicted using video loops, not still, creating a more \"live\" feel. Recent examples include:\n\nAside from online use, interactive video may be found in a variety of applications, as listed below.\n\nThe term interactive video or interactive movie sometimes refers to a nowadays uncommon technique used to create computer games or interactive narratives. Instead of 3D computer graphics an interactive image flow is created using premade video clips, often produced by overlaying computer-generated material with 12-inch videodisc images (where the setup is known as \"level III\" interactive video, to distinguish it from \"level I\" or videodisc-only, and \"level II\" requiring specially made videodisc players that support handheld-remote-based interactivity without using an external computer setup). The clips can be animation like in the video game \"Dragon's Lair\" or live action video like in the video game \"Night Trap\". Compared to other computer graphics techniques interactive video tends to emphasize the looks and movement of interactive characters instead of interactivity.\n\nInteractive video has been used in interactive cinema presentations.\n\nIn 2008 YouTube added Video Annotations as an interactive layer of clickable speech-bubble, text-boxes and spotlights. Users may add interactive annotations to their videos and by that a new trend of interactive videos arose, including choose-your-own-adventure video series, online video games using YouTube videos, spot-the-difference-game videos, animal-dubbing and more.\nIn 2009 YouTube added a community aspect to its Video Annotations feature by allowing video owners to invite their friends and community to add annotations to their movies.\n\nAround 2010 YouTube released the interactive takeovers, certain channels had the opportunity to integrate an iFrame experience enabling them to include interactive videos. Some of the most successful takeovers were done by brands such as Samsung, Tipp-Ex or Chrome.\n\nIn 2014, video marketing platform Innovid was awarded a U.S. patent for interactive video technology.<br>\n\nIn 2017, the interactive video agency Adways created a specific format called InContent that enables to add interactive ads on a live stream for Roland-Garros.\n\nDocumentary filmmakers have leveraged interactivity to communicate ideas about technology in new ways. One such example is the Peabody Award-winning \"Do Not Track,\" created by Brett Gaylor.\n\nContemporary interactive video artists like Miroslaw Rogala, Greyworld, Raymond Salvatore Harmon, Lee Wells, Camille Utterback, Scott Snibbe, and Alex Horn have extended the form of interactive video through the dialog of gesture and the participatory involvement of both active and passive viewers. Perpetual art machine is a video art portal and interactive video installation that integrates over 1000 international video artists into a single interactive large scale video experience.\n\nA number of interactive video cell phone games have been developed over the last several years.\n\nTechnically VJing is also about creating a stream of video interactively. this involves the user/operator to mix video clips, runtime plugins, and FX to the music's mood, bpm, and vibe.\n\nThe human-computer interaction (HCI) research community as well as the multimedia research community have published several works on video interaction tools.

She was named for Secretary of the Navy Nathan Goff, Jr.\n\n\"Goff\", built by the New York Shipbuilding Corporation, was launched 2 June 1920; sponsored by Mrs. Nathan Goff, widow of the former Secretary of the Navy; and commissioned at the Philadelphia Navy Yard on 19 January 1921, Lieutenant, junior grade Rodman D. deKay in command.\n\nFor the first 2 years of her long service, \"Goff\" operated along the Atlantic coast, conducting battle practice and exercises in the yearly Caribbean fleet maneuvers as well as off the East Coast. In September 1922, the destroyer was detached from this duty and assigned to the Atlantic Fleet, European Waters. Departing Norfolk, Virginia on 14 October 1922, she cruised primarily in the eastern Mediterranean, putting in at ports in Turkey, Bulgaria, Russia, Egypt, Palestine, Syria, Greece, and Romania. It was a period of great unrest in the Balkans and eastern Mediterranean: Greece and Turkey were at war, various powers were scrambling to consolidate after World War I and gain control over the now-defunct Ottoman empire, and Russia, although still wracked by the Russian Revolution and its aftermath, was seeking further territory and an outlet to the Mediterranean. The presence of American men-of-war amidst this tension assisted various relief agencies working to mitigate the damage from past and present wars as well as protect American lives, interests, and property. Refugees from the Greek and Turkish conflict were frequently evacuated and cared for by the American fleet, and \"Goff\" participated in this humanitarian service, particularly at Marsina, where from 18 to 20 July 1923 she supervised evacuation of hundreds of Turkish refugees.\n\nReturning to the United States on 11 August, \"Goff\" engaged in battle problems and tactical exercises off the East Coast and then on 3 January 1924 joined the Scouting Fleet for winter battle practice with the combined fleets in the Caribbean, \"Goff\" returned to Norfolk, Virginia for further exercises and on 5 January 1925 sailed for Pearl Harbor, arriving 24 April for fleet battle exercises. She returned to New York 17 July. This established pattern of coastwise exercises and fleet maneuvers was broken in the fall of 1926, as \"Goff\" and engaged in rescue work on the Isle of Pines, Cuba, which had been devastated by the hurricane of 19–20 October. Flying in stores via \"Milwaukee's\" planes and sending their own doctors and medical supplies ashore, the two American ships gave aid to the stricken island and its predominantly American population.\n\nAfter overhaul, \"Goff\" returned to the Caribbean in January 1927 with the Special Service Squadron. Civil war was underway in Nicaragua, and ships of the American fleet cruised along the coast to protect American lives and property, and to evacuate American citizens if necessary. From Nicaragua, \"Goff\" returned to her regular routine along the Atlantic coast, tactical exercises spiced by winter maneuvers in the Caribbean, a pattern to which she held for several years.\n\nRoutine was interrupted by occasional special tasks, the most notable of which came in June 1927. \"Goff\" was part of the flotilla which steamed out from the East Coast to greet and escort and her special passenger, Charles Lindbergh, as he returned from his transatlantic flight to a hero's welcome in New York. \"Goff\" also in June 1930 carried the President-elect of Colombia from Newport, Rhode Island to West Point. She decommissioned at the Philadelphia Navy Yard on 13 January 1931.\n\nRecommissioning 2 March 1932, Lieutenant Commander Walter M. Wynne commanding, \"Goff\" spent the following year cruising along the East Coast training naval reserve crews. Revolution again flared up in the Caribbean, and \"Goff\" returned there 5 October 1933 to protect Americans in Cuba, where the conflict was located. Departing Cuba 2 April 1934, \"Goff\" resumed maneuvers along the East Coast until 9 November 1935, when she joined the Pacific Fleet at San Diego, California. She remained in the Pacific, operating along the coast and taking part in Hawaiian exercises, until 4 January 1939, when she departed San Diego for New York. Arriving there 20 April, \"Goff\" again cruised the East Coast training reserves until 8 September, when she entered New England waters on Neutrality Patrol.\n\nAfter overhaul and refitting for European duty at New York, \"Goff\" joined Destroyer Division 55 at Ponta Delgada, Azores, on 29 June 1940 to take her place as flagship of the division. Cruising to Portugal, \"Goff\" and her division operated out of Lisbon, engaging in various exercises before returning to Norfolk 21 September.\n\nJoining DesDiv 67 as flagship, \"Goff\" escorted from New London, Connecticut to Balboa, Panama Canal Zone, arriving 31 October to take up Caribbean patrol and guard duty for the Panama Canal. After America's entry into the war in December 1941, \"Goff\" remained in the Caribbean to do double duty, as both a convoy escort and patrol vessel. This area was heavily trafficked by German U-boats, and the undermanned Allied convoys (as many as 25 merchantmen with only four escorts) frequently provided easy targets. Night attacks by German submarines cost convoys which \"Goff\" was escorting a total of eight merchantmen sunk and several others seriously damaged. The destroyer was worked hard: she was out on patrol and convoy duty 10 days at a time and then in port only long enough to refuel and resupply; when this could be done at sea, it was. Escorts were at a premium as the Allies struggled to maintain their supply lines.\n\n\"Goff\" finally had her chance to inflict real damage on the German U-boats as she left the Caribbean on 16 June 1943 and put in at New York for a long-needed overhaul. At Norfolk on 27 July, she joined , and to form an offensive antisubmarine patrol which conducted two highly successful patrols across the Atlantic. The close coordination between the carrier's planes and her destroyer screen was effective, during the period \"Goff\" was with the carrier, 27 July-9 November 1943, they made two voyages from Norfolk to Casablanca and were credited with sinking no fewer than eight U-boats. These patrols came to a dramatic conclusion when on 1 November Borie rammed and sunk a U-boat, but was herself fatally damaged in the process. For these two patrols \"Goff\" was awarded a Presidential Unit Citation (US).\n\nAfter brief overhaul at New York, \"Goff\" returned to Atlantic escort duty as on 28 November she and \"Barry\" convoyed , loaded with aeronautical supplies and personnel, from Norfolk to Casablanca and then on to Reykjavík, Iceland, returning to New York on 31 December. \"Goff\" spent the first 7 months of 1944 with \"Albemarle\", shepherding the tender safely to San Juan, Trinidad and Tobago, Casablanca, Recife, Brazil, and Avonmouth, England, before putting in at Boston, Massachusetts on 13 July 1944 for overhaul.\n\nRepairs completed, \"Goff\" engaged in antisubmarine practice at Casco Bay, Maine, and then on 28 August sailed for Key West, arriving 3 days later. At the Florida port she was attached to the Fleet Sound School and served in a variety of duties, including antisubmarine work, harbor guard, and target vessel for ships and planes in training. The destroyer departed Key West for Philadelphia on 9 June 1945, arriving there 2 days later.\n\n\"Goff\" decommissioned at Philadelphia on 21 July 1945, after 24 years of service, and was struck from the Navy Register on 13 August 1945. Sold to the Boston Metal Salvage Company, Baltimore, Maryland, on 30 November 1945, she was resold to the Northern Metal Company, Philadelphia, on 30 November 1945 and later scrapped.\n\n\"Goff\" received two battle stars for service in World War II.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1794901", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1794901", "title": "Accelerograph", "text": "Accelerograph\n\nAn accelerograph can be referred to as a strong-motion instrument or seismograph, or simply an earthquake accelerometer. They are usually constructed as a self-contained box, which previously included a paper or film recorder (an analogue instrument) but now they often record directly on digital media and then the data is transmitted via the Internet.\n\nAccelerographs are useful for when the earthquake ground motion is so strong that it causes the more sensitive seismometers to go off-scale. There is an entire science of strong ground motion, that is dedicated to studying the shaking in the vicinity of earthquakes (roughly within about 100 km of the fault rupture).\n\nAccelerographs record the acceleration of the ground with respect to time. This recording is often called an accelerograms, strong-motion record or acceleration time-history. From this record strong-motion intensity measures (IMs, also called parameters) can be computed. The simplest of which is peak ground acceleration (PGA). Other IMs include Arias intensity, peak ground velocity (PGV), for which the accelerogram needs to be integrated once, peak ground displacement (PGD), for which double integration is required. Often a response spectrum is computed to show how the earthquake would affect structures of different natural frequencies or periods. These observations are useful to assess the seismic hazard of an area.\n\nAs well as their engineering applications, accelerograms are also useful for the study earthquakes from a scientific viewpoint. For example, accelerograms can be used to reconstruct the detailed history of rupture along a fault during an earthquake, which would not be possible with seismograms from standard instruments because they would be too far away to resolve the details. An example of an accelerograph array that was established to improve knowledge of near-source earthquake shaking as well as earthquake rupture propagation is the Parkfield Experiment, which involved a massive set of strong motion instrumentation.\n\nWithin the accelerograph, there is an arrangement of three accelerometer sensing heads. In recent low-cost instruments these are usually micro-machined (MEMS) chips that are sensitive to one direction. Thus constructed, the accelerometer can measure full motion of the device in three dimensions.\n\nUnlike the continually recording seismometer, accelerometers nearly always work in a triggered mode. That means a level of acceleration must be set which starts the recording process. For analogue and older digital instruments this makes maintenance much more difficult without a direct Internet connection (or some other means of communication). Many trips have been made to accelerometers after a large earthquake, only to find that the memory was filled with extraneous noise, or the instrument was malfunctioning.\n\nAccelerometers are used to monitor the response of structures to earthquakes. Analysis of these records along with the shaking recorded at base of the structure can improve building design, through earthquake engineering.\n"}
{"id": "1794902", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1794902", "title": "Pin group", "text": "Pin group\n\nIn mathematics, the pin group is a certain subgroup of the Clifford algebra associated to a quadratic space. It maps 2-to-1 to the orthogonal group, just as the spin group maps 2-to-1 to the special orthogonal group.\n\nIn general the map from the Pin group to the orthogonal group is \"not\" onto or a universal covering space, but if the quadratic form is definite (and dimension is greater than 2), it is both.\n\nThe non-trivial element of the kernel is denoted −1, which should not be confused with the orthogonal transform of reflection through the origin, generally denoted −\"I\".\n\nThe pin group of a definite form maps onto the orthogonal group, and each component is simply connected: it double covers the orthogonal group. The pin groups for a positive definite quadratic form \"Q\" and for its negative −\"Q\" are not isomorphic, but the orthogonal groups are.\n\nIn terms of the standard forms, O(\"n\", 0) = O(0,\"n\"), but Pin(\"n\", 0) and Pin(0, \"n\") are in general not isomorphic. Using the \"+\" sign convention for Clifford algebras (where formula_1), one writes\nand these both map onto O(\"n\") = O(\"n\", 0) = O(0, \"n\").\n\nBy contrast, we have the natural isomorphism Spin(\"n\", 0) ≅ Spin(0, \"n\") and they are both the (unique) non-trivial double cover of the special orthogonal group SO(\"n\"), which is the (unique) universal cover for \"n\" ≥ 3.\n\nThere are as many as eight different double covers of O(\"p\", \"q\"), for \"p\", \"q\" ≠ 0, which correspond to the extensions of the center (which is either \"C\" × \"C\" or \"C\") by \"C\". Only two of them are pin groups—those that admit the Clifford algebra as a representation. They are called Pin(\"p\", \"q\") and Pin(\"q\", \"p\") respectively.\n\nEvery connected topological group has a unique universal cover as a topological space, which has a unique group structure as a central extension by the fundamental group. For a disconnected topological group, there is a unique universal cover of the identity component of the group, and one can take the same cover as topological spaces on the other components (which are principal homogeneous spaces for the identity component) but the group structure on other components is not uniquely determined in general.\n\nThe Pin and Spin groups are \"particular\" topological groups associated to the orthogonal and special orthogonal groups, coming from Clifford algebras: there are other similar groups, corresponding to other double covers or to other group structures on the other components, but they are not referred to as Pin or Spin groups, nor studied much.\n\nIn 2001, Andrzej Trautman found the set of all 32 inequivalent double covers of O(\"p\") x O(\"q\"), the maximal compact subgroup of O(\"p\", \"q\") and an explicit construction of 8 double covers of the same group O(\"p\", \"q\").\n\nThe two pin groups correspond to the two central extensions\nThe group structure on Spin(\"V\") (the connected component of determinant 1) is already determined; the group structure on the other component is determined up to the center, and thus has a ±1 ambiguity.\n\nThe two extensions are distinguished by whether the preimage of a reflection squares to ±1 ∈ Ker (Spin(\"V\") → SO(\"V\")), and the two pin groups are named accordingly. Explicitly, a reflection has order 2 in O(\"V\"), \"r\" = 1, so the square of the preimage of a reflection (which has determinant one) must be in the kernel of Spin(\"V\") → SO(\"V\"), so formula_4, and either choice determines a pin group (since all reflections are conjugate by an element of SO(\"V\"), which is connected, all reflections must square to the same value).\n\nConcretely, in Pin, formula_5 has order 2, and the preimage of a subgroup {1, \"r\"} is \"C\" × \"C\": if one repeats the same reflection twice, one gets the identity.\n\nIn Pin, formula_5 has order 4, and the preimage of a subgroup {1, \"r\"} is \"C\": if one repeats the same reflection twice, one gets \"a rotation by 2π\"—the non-trivial element of Spin(\"V\") → SO(\"V\") can be interpreted as \"rotation by 2π\" (every axis yields the same element).\n\nIn 1 dimension, the pin groups are congruent to the first dihedral and dicyclic groups:\n\nIn 2 dimensions, the distinction between Pin and Pin mirrors the distinction between the dihedral group of a 2\"n\"-gon and the dicyclic group of the cyclic group \"C\".\n\nIn Pin, the preimage of the dihedral group of an \"n\"-gon, considered as a subgroup Dih < O(2), is the dihedral group of a 2\"n\"-gon, Dih < Pin(2), while in Pin, the preimage of the dihedral group is the dicyclic group formula_8.\n\nThe resulting commutative square of subgroups for Spin(2), Pin(2), SO(2), O(2) – namely \"C\", Dih, \"C\", Dih – is also obtained using the projective orthogonal group (going down from O by a 2-fold quotient, instead of up by a 2-fold cover) in the square SO(2), O(2), PSO(2), PO(2), though in this case it is also realized geometrically, as \"the projectivization of a 2\"n\"-gon in the circle is an \"n\"-gon in the projective line\".\n\nIn 3 dimensions the situation is as follows. The Clifford algebra generated by 3 anticommuting square roots of +1 is the algebra of 2×2 complex matrices, and Pin(3) is isomorphic to SO(3) × \"C\". The Clifford algebra generated by 3 anticommuting square roots of -1 is the algebra formula_9, and Pin(3) is isomorphic to SU(2) × \"C\". These groups are nonisomorphic because the center of Pin(3) is \"C\" while the center of Pin(3) is \"C\" × \"C\".\n\nThe center of Pin(n,0) = Pin is \"C\" when n is even, \"C\" × \"C\" when n = 1 mod 4, and \"C\" when n = 3 mod 4. The center of Pin(0,n) = Pin is \"C\" when n is even, \"C\" when n = 1 mod 4, and \"C\" × \"C\" when n = 3 mod 4. For \"p\", \"q\" ≠ 0 the center of Pin(p,q) is an extension of either \"C\" × \"C\" or \"C\" by \"C\".\n\nThe name was introduced in , where they state \"This joke is due to J-P. Serre\".\nIt is a back-formation from Spin: \"Pin is to O(\"n\") as Spin is to SO(\"n\")\", hence dropping the \"S\" from \"Spin\" yields \"Pin\".\n\n"}

As of September 2012, the transit center is served by six TriMet bus routes.\n\nThe transit center is located at 47 NE Holladay Street where it intersects NE Wheeler Avenue; the MAX station platforms are under an Interstate 5 overpass. The station serves the Rose Quarter area, which includes the Moda Center and the Memorial Coliseum located just to the northwest. The station has three platforms—two side platforms plus an additional island platform and track used as train storage and during special events.\n\nThe former Portland Vintage Trolley car barn is located on the north side of the platforms and connects to the tracks just to the east of the station. It has since been converted into a maintenance facility for TriMet workers. Bus service from the surrounding stops serves much of North and Northeast Portland.

{"id": "1794929", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1794929", "title": "Military geography", "text": "Military geography\n\nMilitary geography is a sub-field of geography that is used by the military, as well as academics and politicians, to understand the geopolitical sphere through the military lens. To accomplish these ends, military geographers consider topics from geopolitics to physical locations’ influences on military operations and the cultural and economic impacts of a military presence. On a tactical level, a military geographer might put together the terrain and the drainage system below the surface, so a unit is not at a disadvantage if the enemy uses the drainage system to ambush it, especially in urban warfare. On a strategic level, an emerging field of strategic and military geography seeks to understand the changing human and biophysical environments that alter the security and military domains. Climate change, for example, is adding and multiplying the complexity of military strategy, planning and training. Emerging responsibilities for the military to be involved in: protection of civilian populations (Responsibility to protect), women and ethnic groups; provision of humanitarian aid and disaster response (HADR); new technology and domains of training and operations, such as in cybergeography, make military geography a dynamic frontier.\n\nMilitary geography has a long and practical history. For example, \"Imperial Military Geography\" in 1938 shows how a colonial empire approach to military geography could describe the geographical setting of empire, the responsibilities and the resources that could be mobilised for national or imperial needs. Environmental determinism, regional geography, geographic information systems and geography more generally have all evolved and entwined over hundreds of years.\n\nCanadian, South African and Australian military geography (Pearson et al. 2018) is inconspicuous compared to the United States and British traditions.\n\nThere are important links to peace studies and particularly notable was Australian Professor Griffith Taylor who espoused Geopacifics as, \"an attempt to base the teachings of freedom and humanity upon real geographical deductions; it is humanized Geopolitics\" and later observed that, ...\"so few geographers are prepared to explore public problems which touch on geography as much as on most other disciplines. This is certainly the case with the problem of world peace.\" \n\nRussian colonel N. S. Olesik terms the field of analyzing the complex urban environment in particular “military geo-urbanistics.” In the open country, units only deal with terrain, weather, and the enemy. In urban warfare, the terrain is more complex, filled with many structures and transformations of the land by the inhabitants, which restrict visibility from the air and create obstacles to ground units. Spaces may be narrow, and convoys may be restricted to certain routes between buildings, where they face roadside bombs and ambushes.\n\nUnits must work with or work around local people, some of whom may cooperate and others of whom may oppose, while others are neutral or caught between the two factions. Guerilla fighters may count on an enemy's unwillingness to bomb or fire on heavily populated areas.\n\nSeveral types of terrain and associated climate are prevalent, each affecting combatants differently.\n\nIn an arid climate, as in many desert areas across the globe, sand is a main concern. Sand can hamper an army's attempts to remain hydrated, sapping moisture from skin; sand also jams machinery including the firing mechanisms of firearms.\n\nTerrain is usually fairly flat, though in some regions there are vast, rolling sand dunes. The desert environment can also contain mountains; as in Afghanistan and in certain areas around Israel. Due to the ongoing conflicts in the Middle East, the U.S. military has redesigned the uniforms for the different branches of service. All of the uniforms have a digital camouflage pattern that is very effective in the desert environment, and the boots have been changed from the standard polished black boots to light brown colored suede leather boots. These boots are cooler under the intense heat of the desert sun.\n\nThe conditions of these regions are basically the opposite of those found in desert regions. There are thousands of flora and fauna, and there is always moisture present which presents its own difficulties. The moisture speeds up the rotting processes as well as causing wounds to become infected much easier because of all of the bacteria that live in the water. With proper filtration systems an army should have no problem keeping hydrated.\n\nThe densely packed trees and underbrush provide concealment from the air as well as from the ground. Ambushes can be easily conducted in this environment just like they can in an urban environment. The jungle can also contain mountains, but these mountains are organized differently from those that exist in the desert. The jungle mountains have far more plant life, and are usually much more difficult to ascend. Helicopters have been proven as a very useful means of transportation over jungle and forested areas; Vietnam was, of course, the testing ground for this. Tanks and other vehicles have difficulty maneuvering through and around the densely packed trees, and most military aircraft fly too fast to accurately observe the ground through the trees.\n\nThis type of warfare is not based on a geographical design, but is based on the drastic differences in this particular climate. During war it is much harder to remain warm than it is to remain cool. Even Forested areas can, and many do, experience winter weather conditions. For this specific type of combat there are soldiers that are specifically trained to fight under the conditions individual to the winter season. These conditions call for a drastically thicker and thus warmer uniform, and the weapons even need to be refitted with the proper devices to ensure that they will operate in the cold.\n\nNo two mountains are alike, but there is less oxygen at higher altitude. Fighting up a mountain can be very treacherous. There can be avalanches, rockslides, cliffs, and ambushes from higher up the slopes, and there are almost guaranteed to be caves somewhere in the mountain, as in Afghanistan.\n\nMud is a universal menace to all armies. While it does not hamper the use of air power, it does slow, and sometimes stops, ground movements all together. The most common season for mud across the globe is spring. Following the thawing of winter's snow and the addition of the rains that the season brings, the ground becomes very soft and almost any military vehicle would get bogged down if not properly equipped. The mud is not always dependent on the spring. Rather, in some parts of the world, they are determined by the monsoons.\n\nEven today, there is still a problem of piracy on the world's oceans. One of the most commonly thought of areas for this criminal activity is off the coast of Somalia. There has always been the constant threat of small and fast attack craft coming out to greet a vessel as it passes through the waters between Africa and the Middle East. Another region that piracy occurs, and it can be of a much larger scale, is in and around the Indonesian islands and off the coasts of the Asian mainland. Here the pirates have been able to capture much larger prizes, and they pose a much larger threat to the security of economic interests of many countries. Pirates operate from bases that are concealed, but they must be on the waterfront in a country that is either ignorant of their activity, or worse, are paid to overlook it.\n\nTo deal with the pirates, if an American vessel is attacked, the U.S. Navy has multiple assets to deal with the situation. If the pirates know an attack is imminent, it may be more logical to bomb their base with aircraft from one of the carriers. However, more often than not, the U.S. Navy would opt for secrecy and send in a smaller force, such as the U.S. Navy SEALS, to eliminate the threat.\n\nIn the concerns of a seaport, especially if it is a goal to either capture or defend it, there are more difficulties than in defending a city that is in land. With a harbor there is also the threat from the sea in addition to the land and the air. A harbor is always a key objective for an army to capture when an invasion is commenced. The sooner the harbor can be captured, the sooner it can be used to bring in massive amounts of reinforcements and material. The trouble is to capture the harbor before the enemy can sabotage it by blocking the entrance with wreckage or by deploying mines throughout the harbor. Defending the harbor is a treacherous task because odds are that the enemy can observe your position from both the air and the sea. The harbor is on the periphery of the defense network of many nations, and even more so if the navy is either deployed or nonexistent. The best ways to defend the harbor are to have military airfields in close vicinity, to have naval units based in the harbor on a permanent basis, and to be ready to make the harbor unusable by the enemy if they should overcome your defenses.\n\nThe same rules apply to this category as to the preceding one with the exception of the mines. Here there is almost no need for anti-vehicle mines, and so, the defenses could be planned without much concern for an armored attack.\n\nThe Middle East is, of course, the most obvious place that comes to mind when we think of valuable resources that major nations may compete over when supplies begin to fall around the world. The first Gulf War was an example of the United States’ willingness to go to war to protect its access to the rich oilfields of the Persian Gulf. The strong military presence there influenced some leaders to aid the United States with cheap oil, but over time those forces began to be viewed as a threat to the Muslim world. The attacks of September 11, 2001, have brought new hostilities to the region with the invasions of both Afghanistan and Iraq. Other hotspots around the globe centering on oil are the areas around Venezuela, the Caspian Sea region, and possibly the offshore oil deposits around Vietnam and China. In today's age, especially for people living in developed countries, it is hard to believe that there are other resources that can potentially cause a war.\n\nThe most precious and most needed resource of all is water, and in some parts of the world, that is a very expensive resource to obtain. The most obvious areas that conflict may arise over disputes for water supplies would be in the desert, but at the moment oil is the most valuable liquid in the Middle East. However, oil will not always be there, and if those people are going to survive, they must have water. Several times, countries that are upriver have threatened to build dams across the rivers in order to cut off the country down river, starving that particular country of its water supply. This has been the case with both the Nile and the River Jordan, and the results in both cases have been the same: the countries that are down river have threatened retaliation if such an event should occur. As our global warming trend continues, our weather patterns will continue to shift, and that means that some places will fall into a severe drought. These people may become desperate when they do not have the resources to obtain water if such a disaster should occur.\n\nWater is not the only resource on this planet that is found to be a necessity. The forests are as well. These densely wooded regions of the world are constantly shrinking, and as the oil runs out, people will need to keep warm in the winter. Odds are that they will return to using wood as a primary fuel source for keeping warm. As the forests shrink, neighboring countries will turn on each other for this resource in order to appease their populations. The forests of Latin America and the Pacific Islands are the key hotspots for this resource; this is in part due to the already tense situations in and around those regions because of growing tensions over global oil supplies.\n\nIn 2002's Die Another Day, the term \"conflict diamonds\" is at the heart of the film's plot. In the film, the diamonds are the currency that is used to fund illegal weapons deals, and are used to fund the construction of the Icarus space weapon. The portrayal of the use of the diamonds that come out of Africa holds true in many cases. The term “conflict diamonds” is applied to those diamonds that are not sold through an internationally recognized company. They are “conflict diamonds” because warlords in Africa fight for these diamonds in order to sell them to acquire larger wealth and new weapons for continued fighting. The same is true for the gold fields in southern Africa. There are many warlords that would love to have control of the vast wealth of the mines in order to further fund their lucrative endeavors.\n\nThe United States Department of Defense maintains a larger number of domestic and foreign military bases than all other countries combined. Closing redundant military bases in the United States often has a negative economic impact on local communities. Analysts at the Pentagon respond to budget limitations by identifying installations that have become obsolete for various reasons. Sometimes the needs for the location are no longer prevalent in defense strategies or the installation's facilities have fallen into disrepair. That is the case with the smaller Reserve and National Guard facilities that dot every state. The personnel on the committees responsible for determining closures also observe the economic impact that their decisions will have on the communities surrounding the installations. If 40,000 people are employed because of the installation, either directly or indirectly, it is more likely that that facility will remain open, but only if there is nowhere for the 40,000 people that would lose their jobs. Those people could end up on welfare, thus becoming just as much of a draw on revenue as they were as employees.\n\nOutside of the United States, some countries are strongly vying for inclusion in strategic treaties such as NATO. These countries, many of which are in Eastern Europe, want to join NATO for the mutual advantages of defense and the possibility for foreign bases to be constructed on their soil. These bases, if they were to be built, would bring fiscal resources that those nations would not get without the bases. Sometimes foreign bases are viewed as a good thing. In other regions, a strong political stance may be taken against the construction of foreign military bases, often for sovereignty issues.\n\nDue to the subfield of military geography's perceived connection to traditional or classical geopolitics, a field which has since the end of the Cold War been largely rejected as a research focus by proponents of the popular schools of both critical geography and Marxist or radical geography, military geography has experienced a decline in popularity in academic circles. This is true particularly in institutions unaffiliated with or unconnected to military or governmental organizations. As a result, although there do exist some popular nonfiction writers of geography without academic credentials in the field who touch on military strategy or tactics, there are presently few practicing military geographers or students of military geography in academia. Similarly, there have been few major texts on military geography published specifically for a civilian academic audience since the early 2000s. More recently, in a 2014 article published in the journal \"Critical Military Studies\", the authors Rech et al. suggest a revival of the field in line with critical geography and critical geopolitics. One earlier example of this school of thought has been Woodward's 2004 text \"Military Geographies\". However, given the postmodern bias of critical geographical studies as well as critical geography academics' tendency to proudly claim for themselves a politically radical or anti-authoritarian slant in their research, this form of a revival of military geography seems unlikely to provide sound recommendations for or detailed analyses of major geopolitical events. This shift in focus would also make military geography less likely to fruitfully inform governmental policy or military strategy, as well as potentially limit the ability of academics to provide their expertise to members of the general public interested in studying or reading about the geographic aspects of military strategy.\n\nThe revival of geography and military geography as a sub-discipline is a remarkable trend since 2000 with a number of key geopolitical, international relations, historical geography and geographical approaches being developed. The American Association of Geographers and Institute of Australian Geographers have interest groups that continue to develop the sub-discipline of military geography. At the American Association of Geographers meeting in 2018 a committee gathered evidence about militarism and military geography.\nIn 2018 \"Australian Contributions to Strategic and Military Geography\" outlined a new Australian approach and included chapters on themes and specific regions.\n\n\n\n"}

In 1940, at age 15, Greer suffered from a facial palsy, which paralyzed the left side of her face. She recovered, but the condition may have contributed to her \"patented look\" and \"a calm, quizzical gaze and an enigmatic expression that would later lead RKO to promote her as 'The Woman with the Mona Lisa smile'.\" She claimed that the facial exercises used to overcome the paralysis taught her the importance of facial expression in conveying human emotion.\n\nOn December 4, 1945, Greer had her name legally changed to Jane Greer by a court in Los Angeles. She said of her previous name: \"Mine is a sissy name. It's too bo-peepish, ingenueish, for the type of role I've been playing. It's like Mary Lou or Mary Ann.\"\n\nA beauty-contest winner and professional model from her teens, Greer began her show-business career as a big-band singer. She sang in Washington, DC, with the orchestra of Enric Madriguera. She \"sang phonetically in Spanish\" with the group.\n\nHoward Hughes spotted Greer modeling in the June 8, 1942, issue of \"Life\", and sent her to Hollywood to become an actress. Hughes lent her to RKO to star in many films (another source says Greer's husband, Rudy Vallee, \"helped her get out of her contract with Hughes and secure another pact with RKO Studios\") including \"Dick Tracy\" (1945), \"Out of the Past\" (1947), \"They Won't Believe Me\" (1947), and the comedy/suspense film \"The Big Steal\" (1949), with \"Out of the Past\" co-star Robert Mitchum. Hughes refused to let her work for a time; when she finally began film acting, she appeared in \"You're in the Navy Now\" (1951), \"The Prisoner of Zenda\" (1952), \"Run for the Sun\" (1956), and \"Man of a Thousand Faces\" (1957). In 1984, she was cast in \"Against All Odds\", a remake of \"Out of the Past\", as the mother of the character she had played in 1947. In 1952, Greer obtained a release from her contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios. She said, \"When there is a good role at MGM, the producers want Lana or Ava. There is no chance for another actress to develop into important stardom at the studio\".\n\nGreer's noteworthy roles in television included guest appearances on episodes of numerous shows over the decades, such as \"Alfred Hitchcock Presents\", \"Bonanza\", \"Quincy, M.E.\", \"Murder, She Wrote\", and a 1975 gig with Peter Falk and Robert Vaughn in an episode of \"Columbo\" titled \"Troubled Waters\". She even got to make fun of \"Out of the Past\" in a parody with Robert Mitchum on TV's \"Saturday Night Live\" in 1987. Greer joined the casts of \"Falcon Crest\" in 1984 and \"Twin Peaks\" in 1990 in recurring roles until her retirement in 1996.\n\nGreer was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1634 Vine Street for her contributions to the motion picture industry. The star was dedicated on February 8, 1960.\n\nJane Greer married Rudy Vallee on December 2, 1943, in Hollywood, but they separated after three months and divorced on July 27, 1944. On August 20, 1947, Greer married Edward Lasker (1912–1997), a Los Angeles lawyer and businessman, with whom she had three sons, Alex, Steven, and Lawrence, a movie producer (\"WarGames\", \"Sneakers\"). Greer and Lasker divorced in 1967. Frank London (an actor and dialogue coach) was Greer's domestic partner from 1965 until his death in 2001, six months before Greer died. Greer was a lifelong Democrat and supported Adlai Stevenson during the 1952 presidential election. Greer was Catholic.\n\nGreer died of cancer on August 24, 2001, at the age of 76, in Bel Air, Los Angeles. Her body was interred at Los Angeles' Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1794960", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1794960", "title": "LGBT rights in Croatia", "text": "LGBT rights in Croatia\n\nLesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) rights in Croatia have expanded in recent years, but LGBT persons may still face some legal challenges not experienced by non-LGBT residents. The status of same-sex relationships was first formally recognized in 2003 under a law dealing with unregistered cohabitations. As a result of a 2013 referendum, Croatia's Constitution defines marriage solely as a union between a woman and man, effectively prohibiting same-sex marriage. Since the introduction of the Life Partnership Act in 2014, same-sex couples have effectively enjoyed rights equal to heterosexual married couples in all aspects except full adoption rights, where a \"partner-guardianship\" was introduced to provide same-sex couples with a mechanism similar to step-child adoption. Croatia bans all discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression. Croatia has the most advanced LGBT rights in the Slavic World according to ILGA-Europe.\n\nCentre-left, centre, and green political parties have generally been the main proponents of LGBT rights, while right-wing, centre-right political parties and movements close to the Roman Catholic Church have been in opposition to the extension of rights. In 2015, the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association (ILGA) ranked Croatia 5th in terms of LGBT rights out of 49 observed European countries, which represented an improvement compared to the previous year's position of 12th place. Croatia is among 11 member countries that make up a LGBT Core Group at U.N. on Ending Violence and Discrimination.\n\nThere is no record of how homosexuality was regarded in the Kingdom of Croatia that existed between the years 925 and 1102, after which Croatia entered a personal union with the Kingdom of Hungary. The Penal Code established on 27 May 1852 in the Habsburg Kingdom of Croatia (the first modern one in Croatian language) did not specify homosexuality as a crime. A subsequent draft of the new Penal Code for 1879 for the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia suggested male homosexual acts be punished with up to five years of prison, but the draft was never formally adopted.\n\nDuring World War II, homosexual persons were prosecuted under various fascist regimes, but there is no record of organized persecution of homosexuals in the fascist Independent State of Croatia, whose laws did not explicitly contain a regulation directed against them. The communist Yugoslav Partisans, however, issued several death sentences during the war against partisans whose homosexuality was revealed.\n\nDuring the period when Croatia was part of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, male homosexual acts were made illegal and punishable with up to two years of prison under the Penal Code of 9 March 1951. However, the repression of homosexuals in Yugoslavia effectively began immediately after the end of the war. Homosexuals, labeled by communists as \"enemies of the system\", were also prohibited from joining the Communist Party of Yugoslavia.\n\nThis situation changed when Croatia and other republics gained more control over their own legislature. Constitutional reforms in Yugoslavia in 1974 resulted in the abolishment of the federal Penal Code, allowing every republic to create its own. The Socialist Republic of Croatia created its own Code in 1977, and decriminalized homosexual activity. The Croatian Medical Chamber removed homosexuality from its list of mental disorders in 1973 – four years before the introduction of the new Penal Code, and seventeen years before the World Health Organization did the same. Even though being a member of Yugoslavia meant Croatia was a communist country, it was never under the Iron Curtain, thus making it a relatively open country that was influenced by social changes in the wider developed world.\n\nThe 1980s brought more visibility to LGBT people. In 1985, Toni Marošević became the first openly gay media person, and briefly hosted a radio show on the \"Omladinski radio\" radio station that dealt with marginal socio-political issues. He later revealed that he had been asked on several occasions by the League of Communists of Croatia to form a LGBT faction of the party. The first lesbian association in Croatia, the \"Lila initiative\", was formed in 1989, but ceased to exist a year later.\n\nThe 1990s brought a slowdown in terms of the progression of LGBT rights mainly as a result of the breakup of Yugoslavia followed by the Croatian War of Independence when many Croatian LGBT people, then involved in various feminist, peace and green organizations, joined the anti-war campaign within Croatia. Following Croatian independence, in 1992 the first LGBT association under the name of LIGMA was officially formed. This only lasted until 1997 as the socio-political climate of the time proved hostile to the advancement of gay rights. The most significant event that occurred in the 1990s was the equalization of the age of consent for all sexual activity in 1998 (both heterosexual and homosexual). The situation stagnated until 2000 when a new government coalition, consisting mainly of parties of the centre-left and led by Ivica Račan, took power from the HDZ after their ten-year rule. The new government coalition brought attention to rights of LGBT citizens of Croatia with the introduction of the Same-sex community law in 2003.\n\nThe 2000s proved a turning point for LGBT history in Croatia with the formation of several LGBT associations (with the Rijeka-based lesbian organisation LORI in 2000 and ISKORAK in 2002 being among the first); the introduction of unregistered cohabitations; the outlawing of all anti-LGBT discrimination (including recognition of hate-crime based on sexual orientation and gender identity); and the first gay pride event in Zagreb in 2002 during which a group of extremists attacked a number of marchers. Despite that, later marches drew thousands of participants without incidents. Several political parties as well as both national presidents elected in 2000s have shown public support for LGBT rights, with some politicians even actively participating in Gay Pride events on a regular basis.\n\nIn early 2005 the Sabor rejected a registered partnerships proposal put forward by Šime Lučin (SDP) and the independent Ivo Banac. Lucija Čikeš MP, a member of the then-ruling HDZ, called for the proposal to be dropped because \"the whole universe is heterosexual, from the atom and the smallest particle; from a fly to an elephant\". Another HDZ MP objected on the grounds that, \"85% of the population considers itself Catholic and the Church is against heterosexual and homosexual equality\". However, the medical and physical professions, and the media more generally rejected these statements in opposition, warning that all the members of the Sabor had a duty to vote according to the Constitution which bans discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation.\n\nIn 2009, the governing Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) party passed a controversial law restricting access to in vitro fertilisation (IVF) solely to married couples and heterosexual couples who could prove that they had been cohabitating for at least three years. HDZ initially attempted to pass the law restricting access to IVF solely to married couples, but due to strong public pressure HDZ amended the proposed law to allow access to IVF for non-married heterosexual couples as well. The Catholic Church actively supported the first legislative proposal, arguing that access to IVF should only be granted to married couples. As HDZ is a self-declared Christian democratic party, the then Minister of Health and Social Welfare, Darko Milinović, indicated that the government took the Church's position on the matter seriously.\n\nIn 2009, the European Committee on Social Rights found several discriminatory statements in a biology course text-book mandatory in Croatian schools. It ruled that the statements violated Croatia's obligations under the European Social Charter.\n\nThe 2010s have been marked with a second annual gay pride event in Croatia in the city of Split, a third in Osijek, and the return in 2011 of the centre-left coalition sympathetic to gay rights after the eight-year rule by the conservative-led coalition. The Croatian Government also introduced a Life Partnership Act which makes same-sex couples effectively equal to married couples in everything except full adoption rights. In November 2010, the European Commission's annual progress report on Croatia's candidacy to the EU stated the number of homophobic incidents in Croatia provided concern, and that further effort had to be made in combating hate crime. A 2010 resolution by the European Parliament expressed \"concern at the resentment against the LGBT minority in Croatia, evidenced most recently by homophobic attacks on participants in the LGBT Pride parade in Zagreb; urges the Croatian authorities to condemn and prosecute political hatred and violence against any minority; and invites the Croatian Government to implement and enforce the Anti-Discrimination Law”.\n\nIn December 2011, the newly elected Kukuriku coalition government announced that the modernisation of the IVF law would be one of its first priorities. Proposed changes to the law would allow single women, whose infertility was treated unsuccessfully, access to IVF as well. Other changes were also proposed concerning the freezing of embryos and the fertilization of eggs. The Catholic Church immediately indicated its public oppositions to these changes, stating that they had not been involved in the discussions as much as they should like to have been. The Church subsequently initiated a petition against the legislation, but the Minister of Health, Rajko Ostojić, announced that the law would be going ahead with no compromises. When asked about his attitude on lesbian couples having access to IVF Ostojić said: \"Gay is OK!\" On 13 July 2012, the new law came into force with 88 MPs voting in favour, 45 voting against, and 2 abstentions. A number of HNS MPs who are also members of the ruling coalition wanted lesbian couples to be included in the legal change as well, and expressed disappointment that their amendment was not ultimately accepted. Since the new law only allowed access to IVF to women who were either married or single and infertile, the law excluded lesbian couples. However, the government justified the exclusion by arguing that the legislative change was only intended to deal with the issue of infertility.\n\nIn July 2012, the Municipal Court in Varaždin dealt with a case of discrimination and harassment on the grounds of sexual orientation against a professor at the Faculty of Organization and Informatics at the University of Zagreb. The case was the first report of discrimination based on sexual orientation in accordance with the Anti-Discrimination Act. The court found that there had indeed been discrimination and harassment against the victim in the workplace, and the Faculty was prohibited from further hindering the victim's professional advancement.\n\nA lobby group established in 2013, \"In the Name of the Family\", led the call to change the Croatian national constitution so that marriage can only be defined as a union between a man and a woman. The Roman Catholic Church played a prominent role in this political campaign, and Cardinal Josip Bozanić of Zagreb issued a letter to be read in churches reminding people that \"Marriage is the only union enabling procreation\". Subsequently, a national referendum was held on 1 December 2013 where voters approved the change. Franko Dota, a gay rights activist, criticised the results, arguing that it was intended \"to humiliate the gay population, and to strike against the progress of the past decades\". Stephen Bartulica, a proponent of the referendum and a professor at the Catholic University of Croatia, countered that \"the vote was an attempt to show that there is strong opposition\" to \"gay marriage and adoption by gays\". The prime minister, Zoran Milanović, was unhappy that the referendum had taken place at all, saying, \"I think it did not make us any better, smarter or prettier.\"\n\nOn 1 March 2013, the Minister for Science, Education and Sports, Željko Jovanović, announced that his ministry would begin an action to remove all homophobic content from books used in both elementary and high schools. He wanted to especially target religious education books (religious education in Croatian schools is an optional course).\n\nOn 11 May 2012, Milanović announced a further expansion to the rights of same-sex couples through a new law which would replace the existing unregistered cohabitation legislation. The Sabor subsequently passed the \"Life Partnership Act\" on 15 July 2014. This law effectively made same-sex couples equal to heterosexual married couples in everything except adoption rights. An institution similar to step-child adoption called \"partner-guardian\" was created to deal with the care of children.\nIn March 2014, it was announced that Croatia had granted asylum for the first time to a person persecuted on the basis of their sexual orientation – a young man from Uganda who had fled the country as a result of the Uganda Anti-homosexuality Act.\n\nThe first life partnership in Croatia took place in Zagreb on September 5, 2014 between two men. Within a year of the Sabor passing the law 80 life partnerships were conducted. By the end of 2016 that number had risen to 174. In October 2018, it was reported that a total of 262 life partnerships had been conducted in Croatia between September 2014 and June 2018.\n\nIn May 2016, Zagreb Pride published the first Croatian guide for same-sex couples, LGBT parents and families named \"We Have a Family!\". The publication was intended for informing same-sex partners and LGBT parents and contains information about life partnership, same-sex couples rights and the possibilities of planning LGBTIQ parenting in Croatia, as well as parenting stories written based on the experience of actual Croatian LGBT parents. The publication was financed by the European Union and the Government of Croatia.\n\nIn December 2016, scientists Antonija Maričić, Marina Štambuk, Maja Tadić Vujčić and Sandra Tolić published a book \"I'm Not Gay Mom, I'm Mom\" in which they presented results of their research on the position of the LGBT families in Croatia, first such in the country. It provides insight into the types and characteristics of family communities, the quality of parenting, family climate and quality of relationships, a psychosocial adaptation of children, as well as experiences of stigmatization and discrimination and support in the contemporary Croatian society.\n\nThe organization \"Rainbow Families\" () gathers LGBT couples and individuals who have or want to have children. It was organized by Zagreb Pride in 2011 as an informal group for psychosocial support led by psychologists Iskra Pejić and Mateja Popov. It was formally registered with the Ministry of Public Administration in 2017. In 2018, it gathered around 20 LGBT families with children. On 18 January 2018, Rainbow Families published the first picture book depicting same-sex couples with children in the Balkans, titled “My Rainbow Family”. It was authored by Maja Škvorc and Ivo Šegota, and illustrated by Borna Nikola Žeželj. The picture book depicts thumbnails from the lives of two children girl Ana, who has two dads, and boy Roko, who has two mothers. The aim of the picture book was to strengthen the social integration of children with same-sex parents and to promote tolerance and respect for diversity. It's intended for children of preschool age. The first edition of 500 copies was printed with the financial support of the French Embassy to Croatia and distributed for free to interested citizens and organizations. Since the entire first edition was distributed almost immediately, the organization started a crowdfunding campaign with an intention to collect funds for publishing 1000 new free hardback copies in both Croatian and English, as well as 1000 copies of a new coloring book. In just under 24 hours, they surpassed 2 targeted goals and received more than $7,000 of initial $3,000 goal.\n\nSame-sex sexual activity was legalised in 1977 setting the age of consent at 18 for homosexuals and 14 for heterosexuals. The age of consent was then equalised in 1998 when it was set at 14 by the Croatian Penal Code for everyone, and later raised to 15 for both homosexuals and heterosexuals with the introduction of a new Penal Code on 1 January 2013. There is an exemption to this rule if the age difference between the partners is three years or less.\n\nSame-sex relationships have legally been recognized since 2003, when the Same-sex community law was passed. The law granted same-sex partners who have been cohabiting for at least 3 years similar rights to those enjoyed by unmarried cohabiting opposite-sex partners in terms of inheritance and financial support. However, the right to adopt was not included, nor any other rights included under family law – instead separate legislation has been created to deal with this point. In addition it was not permitted to formally register these same-sex relationships, nor to claim additional rights in terms of tax, joint property, health insurance, pensions etc.\n\nAlthough same-sex marriages have been banned since the 2013 constitutional referendum, the twelfth government of Croatia introduced the Life Partnership act in 2014, which granted same-sex couples the same rights and obligations heterosexual married couples have, excluding the ability to adopt children.\n\nTo step into a life partnership, there are several conditions that have to be met:\n\nFurthermore, an informal life partnership is formed if two partners are in a continuous relationship for three or more years. This type of interpersonal relationship grants the same rights a domestic partnership provides to unmarried heterosexual couples.\n\nFull LGBT adoption in Croatia is legal for both individuals and partners regardless of sexual orientation.\n\nThe Medically Supported Fertilization Law () limits access to IVF to married heterosexual couples and single women whose infertility has been unsuccessfully treated, which effectively excludes same-sex couples. Contrariwise, Article 68 of the Life Partnership Act grants life partners the same rights (and obligations) married heterosexual couples have concerning health insurance and healthcare, and prohibits \"adverse treatment of life partnerships\" in the same areas.\n\nA life partner who is not a legal parent of their partner's child or children can gain parental responsibilities on a \"temporary\" or \"permanent\" basis. As part of a \"life partnership\", the parent or parents of a child can \"temporarily\" entrust their life partner (who is not a biological parent) with parental rights. If those rights last beyond 30 days, then the decision must be certified by a notary. Under this situation, while the parental rights endure then the parent/parents and the life partner must agree collectively on decisions important for the child's well-being. In case of a dissolution of a life partnership, the partner who is not the biological parent can maintain a personal relationship with the child provided the court decides it is in the child's best interest.\n\n\"Partner-guardianship\" is a mechanism created under the Life Partnership Act that enables a life partner who is not a biological parent to gain \"permanent\" parental rights, and is thus similar to step-child adoption. Such a relationship between the non-parent life partner and the child may be continued if the parent-partner dies (under the condition that the other parent has also died), is considered unknown, or has lost their parental responsibilities due to child abuse. However, the non-parent life partner can also ask for the establishment of partner-guardianship while the parent-partner is alive under the condition that the other parent is considered unknown or has lost parental responsibilities due to child abuse.\n\nThe partner-guardian receives full parental responsibility as is the case with step-child adoption, and is registered on the child's birth certificate as their partner-guardian. Partner-guardianship is a \"permanent\" next-of-kin relationship with all the rights, responsibilities, and legal standing as that of a parent and a child. The first case of a partner-guardianship was reported in July 2015.\n\nIn December 2018, the Croatian Parliament passed The Act on Fostering with 72 votes for, 4 against and 6 abstainers.™Croatian gay rights groups slammed a new law that blocks same sex couples from becoming foster parents, although ahead of the vote, more than 200 prominent Croatian psychologists and sociologists in a statement voiced hope that lawmakers would not be led by \"prejudices and stereotypes\" and deprive children of a chance to be paired with foster parents \"regardless of their sexual orientation.\" The activists vowed to fight it in the country's top court. Afterwards, Mladen Kožić and Ivo Šegota, a gay couple aspiring to become foster parents, wrote an open letter to the government saying that by \"refusing to include life partners' families in the law ... you further boosted stigma and gave it a legal framework.\" The law came into effect on January 1, 2019. On 20 December 2019 it was reported that aforementioned couple did win a court battle that allowed them to become foster parents. Zagreb Administrative Court annulled previous decisions including the refusals of the Center for Social Welfare and the ministry. The court decision is final, and no appeal is allowed. Their attorney Sanja Bezbradica Jelavić stated: \"The court's decision is binding, and an appeal is not allowed, so this judgment is final. The written ruling has not yet arrived, but as stated during the announcement, the court accepted our argument in the lawsuit, based on Croatian regulations and the European Convention on Human Rights. As a result, the court ordered the relevant government agencies to implement the new decision in accordance with the judgment. We believe that the agencies will respect the court decision.\" However, despite this decision, Center for Social Welfare rejected their application for the second time. The case was put before the Constitutional Court of Croatia, and on the 7th of February 2020 it reached the decision that same-sex couples have the right to be foster parents. In its summary, the Constitutional Court of Croatia says:\"The Constitutional Court found that the impugned legal provisions which left out (‘silenced’) a certain social group produces general discriminatory consequences against same-sex persons living in formal and informal life partnerships, which is constitutionally unacceptable.\" The president of the Constitutional Court of Croatia Miroslav Šeparović further stated:\"“The point of this decision is that opportunity to provide foster care service must be given to everyone under the same conditions, regardless of whether the potential foster parents are of same-sex orientation. This does not mean that they are privileged, but their foster care must be allowed if they meet the legal requirements.” The Constitutional Court did not repeal the challenged legal provisions, arguing that this would create a legal loophole, but stated unequivocally that the exclusion of same-sex couples from foster care was discriminatory and unconstitutional, and provided clear instructions to the courts, social welfare centers, and other decision-making bodies regarding these issues and indicated they must not exclude applicants based on their life partnership status. Constitutional judges stressed that, despite not intervening in the legal text, \"courts or other competent bodies that directly decide on individual rights and obligations of citizens in resolving individual cases are obliged to interpret and apply laws in accordance with their meaning and legitimate purpose, to make those decisions on the basis of the constitution, laws, international treaties and other sources of law.\" 9 judges voted for this decision, and 4 were against. 2 out of those 4 were of an opinion that Sabor should be allowed to change the current Foster Care act, and the other 2 were of an opinion that the law did not discriminate same-sex couples.\n\nGender transition is legal in Croatia, and birth certificates may be legally amended to recognise this. Up until June 2013 the change of gender always had to be stated on an individual's birth certificate. However, on 29 May 2012 it was announced that the government would take extra steps to protect transsexual and transgender people. Under the new rules, the undertaking of sex reassignment surgery no longer has to be stated on an individual's birth certificate, thus ensuring that such information remains private. This is also the case for people who have not formally undergone sex reassignment surgery, but have nevertheless undertaken hormone replacement therapy. The change in the law was proposed by the Kukuriku coalition while they were in opposition in 2010, but was categorically rejected by the ruling right-wing HDZ at the time. The new law took effect on 29 June 2013.\n\nThe 2008 Anti-Discrimination Law includes sexual orientation, gender identity and gender expression on the list of protected categories against discrimination when it comes to access to either public and private services, or to access to establishments serving the public.\n\nOther anti-discrimination directives that prohibit discrimination based on gender, gender expression, and/or sexual orientation have been included in various pieces of legislation since 2003:\n\nSince 2006, the country has had hate crime legislation in place which covers sexual orientation. The law was first applied in 2007, when a man who violently attacked the Zagreb Pride parade using Molotov cocktails was convicted and sentenced to 14 months in prison. On 1 January 2013 new Penal Code has been introduced with the recognition of a hate crime based on a gender identity.\n\nLGBT associations Zagreb Pride, Iskorak and Kontra have been cooperating with the police since 2006 when Croatia first recognized hate crimes based on sexual orientation. As a result of that cooperation the police have included education about hate crimes against LGBT persons in their training curriculum in 2013. In April of the same year the Minister of the Interior, Ranko Ostojić, together with officials from his ministry launched a national campaign alongside Iskorak and Kontra to encourage LGBT persons to report hate crimes. The campaign has included city light billboards in four cities (Zagreb, Split, Pula, and Osijek), handing out leaflets to citizens in those four cities, and distributing leaflets within police stations across the country.\n\nAccording to the regulations of the Croatian institute for transfusions (\"Hrvatski zavod za transfuzijsku medicinu\"), people who practised sexual acts with the persons of the same sex are banned from donating blood.\n\nLGBT persons are not banned from participation in military service. Ministry of Defence has no internal rules regarding LGBT persons, but it follows regulation at the state level which explicitly prohibits discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. Some media reports have suggested that most gay men serving in the military generally decide to keep their sexual orientation private, but there have also been reports suggesting that the Croatian Armed Forces take discrimination very seriously and will not tolerate homophobia among its personnel.\n\nThe only known case of discrimination in the Croatian Army is the 1998 case of recruit Aldin Petrić from Rijeka. In July 1998, Petrić answered his draft summons and reported to the barracks at Pula where he told to his senior officer in a private conversation that he was gay however that information quickly spread through the barracks which resulted in Petrić being subjected to abuse by his fellow soldiers and other officers. Petrić repeatedly asked to be transferred to another barracks but his requests were not met. On July 22, Petrić was dismissed from the army because of \"unspecified disturbance of sexual preference\" (Code F65.9 from the 1992 ICD-10 Classification of Mental and Behavioral Disorders of the World Health Organization, which however hasn't specifically cited homosexuality as psychological disorder). Following Petrić's dismissal from Army, his parents found out about his homosexuality and expelled him from home. Petrić then sued Ministry of Defense for damages, citing \"discriminatory policies, official impunity for the suffered abuse, and psychological trauma\". In October 1998, the Ministry summoned Petrić once again in order for him to complete his military service which he refused fearing for his life. Afterwards Petrić sought and received political asylum in Canada.\n\nThe 2010 European Social Survey found that 38% of Croatians agreed with the statement that \"gay men and lesbians should be free to live their own lives as they wish\".\n\nA poll in June 2011 showed that 38.3% of citizens supported the holding of gay pride events, while 53.5% remained opposed. However, a majority (51.3%) did not believe it was right to ban such events – while 41,2% thought they should be.\n\nA June 2013 opinion poll suggested that 55.3% stated would vote yes in an upcoming referendum to constitutionally prohibit same-sex marriage; with 31.1% voting no. However, in the event, almost 40% of the national population decided not to participate in the referendum.\n\nA poll from November 2013 revealed that 59% of Croats think that marriage should be constitutionally defined as a union between a man and a woman, while 31% do not agree with the idea.\n\nAfter the Life Partnership Act was passed in 2014, the opposition and groups opposed to LGBT rights claimed many registrars will wish to be exempted from performing life partnerships at registrars offices, and that private businesses such as florists, bakers or wedding planners will be forced to provide services to gay and lesbian couples. The deputy head of Zagreb City Office for General Administration Dragica Kovačić claimed no cases of registrars wishing to be exempted is known. There are 30 registrars in the City of Zagreb in charge of marriages and life partnerships, and at the registrars' meeting nobody raised an issue. Additionally, a survey was conducted in which private businesses were randomly phoned, asking whether they would refuse to provide services to gay and lesbian couples. Every business surveyed stated they would offer their services to those couples.\n\nA survey of 1000 people conducted in 2014 showed that 45.4% of respondents are strongly against and 15.5% are mainly against the legalisation of same-sex marriage in Croatia. 10.1% were strongly in favour, 6.9% mostly in favour, and 21.2% were neutral.\n\nA survey conducted during the presidential campaign in December 2014 by the daily newspaper Večernji list found that 50.4% of people thought that the future president should support the current level of LGBT rights in Croatia, while 49.6% thought they shouldn't.\n\nEurobarometer Discrimination in the EU in 2015 report concluded the following: 48% of people in Croatia believe that gay, lesbian, and bisexual people should have the same rights as heterosexual people, and 37% of them believe same-sex marriages should be allowed throughout Europe.\n\nWhen asked about having a gay, lesbian or bisexual person in the highest elected political position results were as follows: 40% of the respondents were comfortable with the idea, 13% moderately comfortable, 6% indifferent, 38% uncomfortable, and 3% didn't know. When asked the same question about transgender or transsexual person results were as follows: 33% were comfortable with the idea, 15% moderately comfortable, 40% uncomfortable, 6% indifferent, and 5% didn't know.\n\nFurthermore, when asked how they would feel if one of their colleagues at work were gay, lesbian or bisexual results were as follows: 48% respondents felt comfortable about the idea, 11% moderately comfortable, 31% uncomfortable, 5% indifferent, 4% said it depends, and 1% didn't know. When it comes to working with a transgender or transsexual person results were as follows: 44% felt comfortable with the idea, 12% moderately comfortable, 31% uncomfortable, 6% were indifferent, 3% it would depend, and 4% didn't know.\n\nThat a transgender or transsexual person should be able to change their civil documents to match their inner gender identity was agreeable to 44%, disagreeable to 39%, and 17% didn't know.\n\n64% of respondents agreed that school lessons and material should include information about diversity in terms of sexual orientation, and 63% agreed the same about gender identity.\n\nIn May 2016 ILGA published a survey about attitudes towards LGBT people conducted in 53 UN members (12 of those were European countries, including Croatia). When asked whether homosexuality should be a crime, 68% of people in Croatia strongly disagreed with that (second highest percentage after the Netherlands where 70% of people strongly disagreed), 4% somewhat disagreed, 19% were neutral, 4% somewhat agreed, and 5% strongly agreed (the lowest percentage of people who strongly agreed among European countries included in the survey). Furthermore, when asked whether they would be concerned about having a LGBT neighbor, 75% of people said they would have no concerns, 15% would be somewhat uncomfortable, and 10% very uncomfortable.\n\nThe most recent poll by Pew Research Center published in May 2017 shows that 31% of Croatians are in favor of same-sex marriage, while 64% oppose the idea. Support was higher among non-religious people (61%) than among Catholics (29%). Younger people are more likely than their elders to favor legal gay marriage (33% vs. 30%).\n\nThe capital city Zagreb is home to the biggest gay scene, including gay clubs and bars, plus many other places frequently advertised as gay-friendly. Zagreb is also home to the first LGBT centre in Croatia, and the \"Queer Zagreb\" organization, that among many other activities promotes equality through the Queer Zagreb festival, and Queer MoMenti (an ongoing monthly film program dedicated to LGBT cinema). Croatia's second LGBT centre was officially opened in Split on 24 May 2014, and the third one in Rijeka on 16 October 2014 called \"LGBTIQ+ Druga Rijeka\". Other places that host LGBT parties, and are home to gay-friendly places such as bars, clubs, and beaches are Rijeka, Osijek, Hvar, Rab, Rovinj, Dubrovnik etc.\n\nThe first pride in Croatia took place on 29 June 2002 in the capital city of Zagreb. Public support is growing and number of participants is also increasing rapidly year after year, but the marches have also experienced violent public opposition. In 2006, the march had a regional character, aimed at supporting those coming from countries where such manifestations are expressly forbidden by the authorities. The 2011 manifestation was the biggest Pride rally in Croatia at the time, and took place without any violent incidents. It was also reported that the number of policemen providing security at the event was lower than had been the case in previous years. As of summer 2019, the 2013 event was the biggest one so far, with 15,000 participants.\n\nThe first LGBT pride in Split took place on 11 June 2011. However, the march proved problematic as official security was not strong enough to prevent serious incidents, as a result of which LGBT attendees had to be led to safety. Several hundred anti-gay protesters were arrested, and the event was eventually cancelled.\nSoon after the event, sections of the national media voiced supported for LGBT attendees, calling on everyone to \"march in the upcoming Zagreb Pride\". On 9 June 2012, several hundred participants marched in Rijeka, the third largest city in Croatia. The march was organised to support Split Pride. A second attempt at holding an event in 2012 was more successful, after receiving public support from the Croatian media, national celebrities, and politicians. Five ministers from the government and other public figures participated. In 2013, the march went ahead without a single incident, and it was the first time in Croatia that the mayor of the city participated.\n\nThe first LGBT pride march in Osijek took place on 6 September 2014. It was organized by the Osijek LGBT association LiberOs. There were no incidents, and over 300 people attended. The Minister of the Economy, as well as Serbian and Greek LGBT activists attended.\n\nOn 27 May 2013, around 1,500 participants in Zagreb marched in support of marriage equality from the park of Zrinjevac to St. Mark's Square, the seat of the Croatian Government, Croatian parliament, and the Constitutional Court of Croatia. On 30 November 2013, one day before the referendum took place, around a thousand people marched in the city of Zagreb in support of marriage equality. Marches of support also took place in Pula, Split, and Rijeka gathering together hundreds of people.\n\nThe first ever Trans Inter march in the Balkans took place in Zagreb on the 30th of March 2019. Around 300 people marched through the streets of Zagreb calling for better protection of intersex children, and general end to discrimination. Guest from Slovenia, Serbia, Romania, Germany, United Kingdom, Switzerland, and Bosnia and Herzegovina joined the march. It was organized by Trans Aid, Trans Network Balkans, and Spektra. The march took place without any incidents.\n\nThe former Croatian President, Ivo Josipović, has given strong support to full LGBT rights, along with several other popular celebrities and centre-left political parties such as the Social Democratic Party of Croatia (SDP), the Croatian People's Party-Liberal Democrats (HNS), the Croatian Social Liberal Party (HSLS), ORaH, and the Labour Party. After Josipović was elected, he met with LGBT associations several times. On 1 June 2012, he published a video message giving support to the 2012 Split Pride and the further expansion of LGBT rights. He also condemned the violence at the 2011 Split Pride, calling it unacceptable and arguing that the next Split Pride should not experience the same scenario. In October 2013 at a reception at the Presidential Palace he welcomed the newly appointed Finnish ambassador and his life partner to Croatia.\n\nVesna Pusić, a member of HNS, is very popular within the Croatian LGBT community. She has been active in improving LGBT rights while being a member of successive governments. A former member of the SDP, current president of ORaH and a former Minister for Environment and Nature Protection in the Kukuriku coalition Mirela Holy has also been a notable long-time supporter of LGBT rights, and has participated in every LGBT Pride event so far.\n\nOther supporters of LGBT rights in Croatia are Rade Šerbedžija, Igor Zidić, Slavenka Drakulić, Vinko Brešan, Severina Vučković, Nataša Janjić, Josipa Lisac, Nevena Rendeli, Šime Lučin, Ivo Banac, Furio Radin, Darinko Kosor, Iva Prpić, Đurđa Adlešič, Drago Pilsel, Lidija Bajuk, Mario Kovač, Nina Violić, former Prime Minister Ivica Račan's widow Dijana Pleština, Maja Vučić, Gordana Lukač-Koritnik, pop group E.N.I. etc.\n\nDamir Hršak, a member of the Labour party, who has publicly spoken about his sexual orientation and has been involved in LGBT activism for years, is the first openly gay politician to become an official candidate for the first European Parliament elections in Croatia, held in April 2013. He had criticized the current coalition government for not doing enough for the LGBT community, and said that his party would not make concessions, and is in favour of same-sex marriage.\n\nConservatives such as Ruža Tomašić have also indicated that same-sex couples should have some legal rights. The Croatian President Kolinda Grabar-Kitarović while against same-sex marriage, did indicate her support for the Life Partnership Act praising it as a good compromise. She also included sexual minorities in her inaugural speech, and said she would support her son if he was gay. During the referendum, the conservative former Prime Minister, Jadranka Kosor, voted in favour of presenting the issue before the Constitutional Court, and against the proposed Constitutional change. This was a change from her previous position on homosexuality and same-sex marriage where she had been known for being against the expansion of LGBT rights, and subsequently voted \"homophobe of the year\" in 2010 by visitors of the website \"Gay.hr\" after stating that homosexuality is not natural, and that same-sex marriages should never be legal. She also supported the Life Partnership Act.\n\nOn 16 June 2011, 73 professors and associates of Zagreb Faculty of Law signed a statement initiated by the professor Mihajlo Dika, in which they expressed their full support for 2011 Zagreb Pride, and their support for the authorities in preventing and sanctioning behavior endangering equality and fundamental rights and freedoms of Croatian citizens effectively and responsibly. They also condemned hooligans that attacked the participants of the 2011 Split Pride.\n\nThe largest conservative party in Croatia, the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ), remains opposed to LGBT rights. HDZ MPs voted against the proposed law on unregistered cohabitations, and against the Life Partnership Act. Since Croatian independence, HDZ has managed to form a majority in the Sabor on its own or with coalition partners in 6 out of 8 Parliamentary elections (1992, 1995, 2003, 2007, 2015, 2016). The party has, nevertheless, enacted several laws that ban discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity as part of the negotiation process prior to the accession of Croatia to the European Union. The Croatian Democratic Alliance of Slavonia and Baranja (HDSSB), a regionalist and right wing populist party formed in 2006 is also opposed to LGBT rights. During the Parliamentary debate on the Life Partnership Act, Dinko Burić, HDSSB MP stated his opposition to the law: \"\"For us, being gay is not ok!\"\" He also added that this is his party's official stand on LGBT rights. HDSSB MPs supported the 2013 referendum by having the word FOR on top of their laptops in Parliament. Contrary to that, the president of Croatian Democratic Alliance of Slavonia and Baranja (HDSSB) Dragan Vulin expressed his support for equal rights for same-sex couples in everything except adoption during the 2016 parliamentary election campaign.\n\nRuža Tomašić, leader of the Croatian Conservative Party has expressed her opposition to same-sex marriage on the grounds that Croatia is a majority Catholic country, but at the same time expressed her support for same-sex couples to receive equal rights to married couples in everything except adoption. Her former deputy from the HSP dr.Ante Starčević, Pero Kovačević, said that the 19th century Croatian politician Ante Starčević after whom the party has been named would not have opposed LGBT rights, and would have supported same-sex marriage. This was said in response to the youth-wing of the party organizing an anti-gay protest. The group later published an official letter expressing outrage to Kovačević's opposition to the protest.\n\nThe Roman Catholic Church in Croatia has also been an influential and vocal opponent to the extension of LGBT rights in the country. After the first LGBT Pride in Split in 2011 some Catholic clergy even attempted to explain and justify the violence that had occurred during the Pride march. Dr. Adalbert Rebić argued that injured marchers had \"got what they were asking for\". Meanwhile, Ante Mateljan, a professor in the Catholic Theology College, openly called for the lynching of LGBT marchers.\n\nThe Catholic Church has also engaged at a political level, notably in providing public and vocal support for the 2013 referendum to define marriage in Croatia (and thus effectively reinforcing the existing prohibition on marriage between two people of the same gender). It was actively involved in collecting signatures for the petition to force a constitutional change. Cardinal Josip Bozanić encouraged support for the proposed constitutional amendment in a letter read out in all churches where he singled out heterosexual marriage as being the only union capable of biologically producing children, and thus worthy to be recognised.\n\nA conservative group \"In the Name of the Family\", formed in 2013, was the initiator of the 2013 referendum. The group opposes same-sex marriage, and any other form of recognition for same-sex unions. The most prominent member of the group, Željka Markić, opposed the Life Partnership Act claiming it was same-sex marriage under a different name, and thus a violation of the Constitution. She argued that the partner-guardianship institution proved most problematic under law. The Minister of Administration, Arsen Bauk, responded that the government would not be changing the law on this point, while giving a reminder that the Constitutional court had made clear that defining marriage as a union between a man and a woman in the Constitution must not have any negative effects on any future laws on recognising same-sex relationships (if not marriage).\n\nCroatia is a major tourist centre. Around 200.000 LGBT tourists visit Croatian annually. Destinations such as Dubrovnik, Hvar, Rab, Krk, Rovinj, Rijeka and Zagreb are advertised as gay-friendly.\n\nThe city of Rab has been a popular destination among gay tourists since the 1980s, and in 2011 it has officially become the first gay-friendly destination to advertise itself as such in Croatia. Director of the Rab Tourist Board Nedjeljko Mikelić stated: \"Our slogan is – Happy island, and our message is happiness and holding hands, so feel free to hold hands whether you are a same-sex couple, a heterosexual couple, a mother and a daughter, a couple in love. Nothing negative will happen to you on this island, and you will be happy.\"\nIn July 2008 a gay couple from South America married in Hvar. \nIn June 2012, the Croatian Minister of Tourism Veljko Ostojić welcomed all gay tourists to Croatia, and supported Split Pride.\n\nOn the Gay European Tourism Association (GETA) website there are more than 50 gay and gay-friendly hotels and destinations in Croatia.\n\n"}
{"id": "1794963", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1794963", "title": "Hague School", "text": "Hague School\n\nThe Hague School is a group of artists who lived and worked in The Hague between 1860 and 1890. Their work was heavily influenced by the realist painters of the French Barbizon school. The painters of the Hague school generally made use of relatively somber colors, which is why the Hague School is sometimes called the \"Gray School\".\n\nAfter the great periods of Dutch art in the Golden Age of the 17th century, there were economic and political problems which diminished activity in art. The fine arts in the Netherlands enjoyed a revival around 1830, a time now referred to as the Romantic period in Dutch painting. The style was an imitation of the great 17th-century artists. The most widely accepted paintings of this period were landscapes and paintings which reflected national history. Andreas Schelfhout was a painter of landscapes, especially winter scenes, but also woodlands and the dunes between The Hague and Scheveningen. His best known pupils included Wijnand Nuyen, Johan Barthold Jongkind, and Jan Hendrik Weissenbruch. Schelfhout's friend and occasional collaborator Hendrik van de Sande Bakhuyzen principally composed pastoral landscapes like those of Golden Age master Paulus Potter, but trained several prominent Hague School artists, notably his son Julius van de Sande Bakhuyzen, Willem Roelofs, , Hubertus van Hove, and Weissenbruch. Wijnand Nuyen was one of the best of the romantic artists of the time and he had a great influence on Weissenbruch and Johannes Bosboom.\n\nArt training at that time was usually in the form of drawing schools, with no painting classes. Many young artists who later became members of the Hague School were frustrated by this and scattered to various places to receive the training they desired. Gerard Bilders left the Hague Academy of Drawing and completed training with the Swiss animal painter, Charles Humbert. Paul Gabriël went to Kleve, just over the German border, to study with the landscape painter Barend Cornelis Koekkoek. Jozef Israëls, unsatisfied with the academies at Groningen and Amsterdam, left for Paris to attend classes at the studio of François-Édouard Picot. Jacob Maris left the Hague Academy for the corresponding institution in Antwerp and from there he went to study with Ernest Hébert in Paris. His brother Matthijs Maris studied with Nicaise de Keyser in Antwerp. Hendrik Willem Mesdag left Groningen to perfect his skills in Brussels under Willem Roelofs. He also received additional instructions from Lawrence Alma-Tadema, who would later move to England.\n\nIn the 1830s artists like Théodore Rousseau, Jean-François Millet, Charles-François Daubigny, and Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot found their way to Barbizon, a forested area near Fontainebleau. The emphasis of their work here was on painting nature as they saw it - Barbizon was not a school but a community of artists. This gave rise to the well known Barbizon school and their example was followed in the 1850s by a few Dutch painters who gathered in Oosterbeek in order to work in the surrounding countryside.\n\nThese painters had been influenced by the artists of the Barbizon School and emulated them by registering their impressions with rapid strokes of color. Johannes Warnardus Bilders, father of Gerard Bilders, moved to Oosterbeek in 1852 and attracted many pupils: Anton Mauve, a cousin-in-law of Vincent van Gogh, the Maris brothers (Jacob, Willem and Matthijs) in the summer, as well as the regular visitors Willem Roelofs and Paul Gabriël. Some of these artists, such as Jozef Israëls, Jacob Maris and Jan Hendrik Weissenbruch visited Barbizon to paint there.\n\nThere was a slight connection between the \"Düsseldorf Art Association\" when an exhibition on \"Fishing in Scheveningen\" occurred. It concerned such artists as , , and Andreas Achenbach.\n\nThe call of the Düsseldorf painters' school attracted artists of the Hague school, such Johannes Bosboom and J. W. Bilders. At the beginning of his career Jozef Israëls went on a study trip to Düsseldorf. Also Julius van de Sande Bakhuyzen and Philip Sadée came to Düsseldorf. The Düsseldorf academy was famous as a training center for her scenery and histories painting. The bright colour order which distinguishes those paintings is unmistakable.\n\n Gerard Bilders had been seeking something of the kind in his own work, but on visiting the national Exhibition in Brussels in 1860, he found what he had been looking for: a colored gray tonality, or as he put it \"the impression of a warm, fragrant gray.\" The muted tones and warm gray that Bilders found here was certainly discussed with his friends in Oosterbeek and found its way into the work of the young Hague School painters.\nThe migration of these artists to The Hague began in the late 1860s. Hendrik Willem Mesdag was the first, moving there in 1869. Jacob Maris returned to The Hague in 1870 after the family's experience in Paris in the Franco-Prussian War. That same year Jozef Israëls came to The Hague, as did Anton Mauve. Willem Maris, Johannes Bosboom and Weissenbruch had always lived there. For Mesdag, the move marked the end of his student days in Brussels. For Maris it meant a break with the Paris dealers, who would not let him paint what he wanted. Friendship played an important role in this group of painters and whenever one of them was invited to take part in a major exhibition, he would arrange for his friends to also submit work. The outside world was thus presented with a picture of a united artistic and stylized front. The gray tonality was to become one of the characteristics of the Hague School.\nThe name \"Hague School\" was coined in 1875 by a critic, Jacob van Santen Kolff, who used the phrases \"a new way of seeing and depicting things\", \"intent to convey mood, tone takes precedence over color\", \"almost exclusive preference for so-called 'bad weather' effects\", and \"gray mood.\" The Hague School artists were less interested in a faithful portrayal of what they saw than in conveying the atmosphere and impression of the moment. They painted in mostly in subdued colors, with a penchant for gray. That is why the Hague School is sometimes also called the Gray School.\n\nThe painters of the Hague School conducted some of their artistic discussions as member of the Pulchri Studio, which had been founded in 1847 by Bosboom, Willem Roelofs and J. H. Weissenbruch at the home of the Hague painter Lambertus Hardenberg. Growing discontent among the young artists in The Hague about the apparently insufficient opportunities for training and development was the reason for establishing the Pulchri Studio. Many members of the Hague School served on the board of the Pulchri Studio, so that the society became a bastion of the school for many years.\n\nOver the years, the artists of the Hague School changed. Jacob Maris enriched his palette with vivid brushwork, especially in his Amsterdam town views. Jozef Israëls had completely abandoned his anecdotal manner and somber coloring. J. H. Weissenbruch blurred the details in his later work, painting beach scenes and landscapes in magnificently conceived planes of color with an almost abstract quality. Willem Maris became the painter of light he had always tried to be, producing summer meadows with sunlight sparkling on the water and cattle—the quintessence of the Dutch landscape. Matthijis Maris' further development was also remarkable, albeit tragic. Despite the support of family and friends, he led a solitary existence. He worked for years on his paintings of brides and portraits of children, which became increasingly hazy and dreamy until finally becoming completely detached from reality.\n\nBy the mid-1880s the united front of the Hague School began to crumble. The character of the city of The Hague changed as it became larger. The small fishing village of Scheveningen changed as new suburbs were built and factories transformed the area. Weissenbruch and Roelofs found The Hague to be growing too fast and retreated to the polders to continue painting.\n\nAnton Mauve and Jozef Israëls became active in the Laren School which perpetuated aspects of the Hague School. Albert Neuhuys, Hein Kever and Evert Pieters, were especially active there between 1880 and 1900. Realistic interiors of Laren farm houses, as well as plein air landscapes were the preferred subjects of the paintings. Anton Mauve was particularly active in the latter and his views of the heathlands were quite popular with American art lovers.\nWhile The Hague was becoming too large for some, it was too small for others who became influential in the Amsterdam Impressionism group which developed there. This movement drew on city life for its subject matter, although the contrast with the Hague School was less pronounced than is occasionally suggested. This group included some who are designated below as members of the second generation of the Hague School such as George Hendrik Breitner, Isaac Israëls (son of Jozef Israëls), Willem Bastiaan Tholen and Willem de Zwart (also known as William Black). In addition, Willem Witsen, Floris Verster, Jan Hillebrand Wijsmuller and Jan Toorop have some background with the Hague School and are considered to be in the Amsterdam Impressionism movement.\n\nAlthough not usually associated with the Hague School, Johan Jongkind was called a forerunner of impressionism who influenced Eugène Boudin, who later was mentor to Claude Monet. Others who had at least a tangential connections with the artists of the Hague School are Charles Rochussen, Richard Bisschop and Lawrence Alma-Tadema.\n\nAround the 1890s in France, impressionism was followed by post-impressionism, which places greater emphasis on the form, structure and content of the painting. This movement, too, was picked up in the Netherlands, resulting in a Dutch post-impressionism and introducing abstract elements and cubism into modern painting. Famous examples are Vincent van Gogh, who received his first art training from Anton Mauve, as well as Piet Mondrian, who initially painted in the manner of the Hague School and then in a variety of styles and techniques documenting his search for a personal style.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is often served as a starter at formal Scottish dinners but is also widely served as an everyday dish across the northeast of Scotland.\n\nLocal recipes for Cullen skink have several slight variations, such as the use of milk instead of water or the addition of single cream.

Cullen skink was traditionally served with bread.\n\nIt has been described as \"smokier and more assertive than American chowder, heartier than classical French bisque.\"\n\nCullen skink appears in many traditional Scottish cookery books and restaurant and hotel menus throughout Scotland, the rest of the UK and abroad.

The word \"Bad\" meaning \"spa\" was added to the name in 1921. \nOn 22 March 1945, during a heavy air raid on Hildesheim, Bad Salzderfurth was hit by several bombs and two houses in Goettingstrasse were destroyed.\nBad Salzdetfurth was officially awarded \"town\" status in 1949.\n\nEach of the villages incorporated in 1974 has its own history and its own traditions.\n\nBjörn Gryschka (independent politician) was elected the new mayor in January 2019, succeeding Henning Hesse (SPD).\n\nThere are various sights in the town itself and in each of the villages. There are many well-preserved half-timbered houses in the old town centre, such as the Miners' Guild Hall dating from 1898, and in the village of Wesseln. The Catholic Church of St. Gallus at Detfurth was built in a classicist style in the period 1772 to 1779.

Both male and female same-sex sexual activity are legal in Slovakia, but households headed by same-sex couples are not eligible for the same legal protections available to opposite-sex couples. While Slovakia grants same-sex couples limited legal rights, namely in the area of inheritance, the country does not recognise same-sex marriage or civil unions. Slovakia, unlike its neighbour, the Czech Republic, holds more conservative views on issues dealing with LGBT rights.\n\nSlovakia possesses comprehensive anti-discrimination laws covering sexual orientation and gender identity, among others, in areas such as employment, goods and services, education, health services, hate crimes and hate speech. Gays and bisexuals are allowed to serve openly in the Slovak Armed Forces. Additionally, attitudes towards members of the LGBT community are slowly becoming more accepting, in line with worldwide trends.\n\nA 2007 poll showed that two-thirds of Slovaks believe that homosexuality should be accepted by society, while another Pew Research Center poll from 2017 showed evenly split support for same-sex marriage. Opinion polls have reported a trend in support for same-sex marriage and civil unions, with a majority of Slovaks now favouring the latter, and a narrow plurality favouring full marriage.\n\nSame-sex sexual activity was legalized in 1962, after scientific research from Kurt Freund led to the conclusion that homosexual orientation may not be changed (see the history of penile plethysmograph). The age of consent was equalized in 1990 (to 15; it had previously been 18 for homosexuals).\n\nThere is no legal recognition of same-sex unions in Slovakia. On 4 June 2014, the Slovak Parliament approved a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage, with 102 deputies for and 18 deputies against the legislation.\n\nIn 2018, the Freedom and Solidarity party prepared a bill to legalise registered partnerships, which would have granted same-sex couples some of the benefits and responsibilities of marriage. President Andrej Kiska has called for more discussion on this issue. The proposal failed in September 2018.\n\nIn June 2018, the European Court of Justice ruled that EU members states must grant married same-sex couples, where at least one partner is an EU citizen, full residency rights. Slovak officials quickly announced compliance with the ruling.\n\nSince 2018, Slovak law has recognised a \"close person\", defined as a sibling or a spouse; a family member or a person in a relationship shall be considered under law a \"close person\" \"if an injury suffered by one of them is reasonably felt by the other person as an injury suffered by him or her.\" Only limited rights are granted, namely in the area of inheritance.\n\nSlovak law allows any person to adopt. However, persons who are not married to each other may not adopt the same child. This means that for unmarried couples only one partner may adopt a child.\n\nThe \"Anti-Discrimination Act\" () was adopted in 2004, in requirement with European Union protocols on anti-discrimination in its member states. The Act, broadened in 2008, made it illegal to discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation and \"gender identification\" in a wide variety of areas, including employment, education, housing, social care and the provision of goods and services. Article 2 of the law reads as follows:\nIn May 2013, the Criminal Code was amended to include sexual orientation as a ground for hate crimes, allowing penalty enhancements where a crime is motivated by homophobia. Additionally, hate speeches on the basis of sexual orientation are outlawed.\n\nTransgender people in Slovakia have been allowed to change legal gender since 1995, but require undergoing sex reassignment surgery and sterilization, divorce if married, and receive a medical diagnosis to do so.\n\nGay and bisexual men are allowed to donate blood, provided they haven't had sex in a year.\n\nSlovakia's first gay pride event took place on 22 May 2010 in Bratislava. A crowd of about a thousand were confronted by anti-gay right-wing groups. While the National and Bratislava's municipal police forces kept the two sides apart, several anti-gay protesters were able to infiltrate the event and throw stones at speakers and disperse tear gas into the crowd. Pride demonstrators had to cancel their march through the city center, but were able to cross the Danube under police protection. Twenty-nine persons were arrested. The event has since improved its security measures and it has been supported by many foreign embassies.\n\nThere is a small gay scene in Slovakia with a few bars and clubs in Bratislava.\n\nA 2006 European Union poll showed that 19% of Slovaks supported same-sex marriage, however, a 2015 survey found that more than 50.4% of Slovaks would vote in favor of same-sex registered partnerships.\n\nA 2007 Pew Global Attitudes Project survey recorded that 66% of Slovaks believed that homosexuality should be accepted by society.\n\nA 2016 opinion poll conducted by FOCUS found that 27% of Slovaks supported same-sex marriage.\n\nIn 2017, the \"Iniciatíva Inakosť\" conducted a survey enquiring into the lives of Slovak LGBT people. The survey found that 52% were irreligious, while 33% were Roman Catholics, 6% were Evangelicals and 2% were Greek Orthodox. However, 56.5% considered religion \"important\" in their lives. When divided by political ideology, 58.5% considered themselves either \"very liberal\" or \"liberal\". Only 2.5% considered themselves \"conservative\", and 18% said they were \"centrist\". Freedom and Solidarity and Progressive Slovakia were the most popular political parties among LGBT people. With regards to coming out, most respondents said it had been \"positive\". 71% and 52% of sisters and brothers respectively were accepting of their coming out. 54% of mothers, 42% of fathers and 49.5% of grandparents responded the same, and a significant number (including 28.5% of fathers and 29% of grandparents) were indifferent. Furthermore, 78% of respondents considered their relationship with their partner as \"serious\", but less than half were willing to hold their hand in public. However, many respondents reported low self-esteem, anxiety, depression, alcohol abuse and suicidal feelings.\n\nAccording to a 2017 Pew Research Center poll, 47% of Slovaks supported same-sex marriage, while another 47% were opposed and 6% were undecided. This was the highest level of support ever recorded, and the second highest among Eastern European countries, behind the Czech Republic at 65%. Among 18-34-year-olds, opposition to same-sex marriage was 42%.\n\n"}

{"id": "1794981", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1794981", "title": "Piazza Fontana bombing", "text": "Piazza Fontana bombing\n\nThe Piazza Fontana bombing () was a terrorist attack that occurred on 12 December 1969 when a bomb exploded at the headquarters of \"Banca Nazionale dell'Agricoltura\" (the National Agricultural Bank) in Piazza Fontana (near the \"Duomo\") in Milan, Italy, killing 17 people and wounding 88. The same afternoon, three more bombs were detonated in Rome and Milan, and another was found unexploded.\n\nOn 25 April 1969 a bomb exploded at the Fiat booth at a Milan trade fair, in which five people were injured. There was also a bomb discovered at the city's central station. The explosion at Piazza Fontana was not the first, but part of a well-coordinated series of attacks.\n\nThe Piazza Fontana bombing was initially attributed to Italian anarchists. After over 80 arrests were made, suspect Giuseppe Pinelli, an anarchist railway worker, died after falling from the fourth-floor window of the police station where he was being held. Serious discrepancies existed in the police account, which initially maintained that Pinelli had committed suicide by leaping from the window during a routine interrogation session. Three police officers interrogating Pinelli, including Commissioner Luigi Calabresi, were put under investigation in 1971 for his death, but a later inquiry ending October 25, 1975 concluded that there were no wrongdoings regarding Pinelli's death: public prosecutor Gerardo D'Ambrosio established that his fall had been caused by fainting and losing balance, tired after three days of intense questioning.\n\nDespite being exonerated (he was not in the room when Pinelli fell), the far-left organisation \"Lotta Continua\" held Calabresi responsible for the death of Pinelli, and in 1972 he was murdered by left-wing militants in revenge. Adriano Sofri and Giorgio Pietrostefani, former leaders of Lotta Continua, were convicted of plotting Calabresi's assassination, while members Ovidio Bompressi and Leonardo Marino were sentenced for carrying it out.\n\nAnarchist Pietro Valpreda was also arrested after a taxi driver, called Cornelio Rolandi, identified him as the suspicious-looking client he had taken to the bank that day. After his alibi was judged insufficient, he was held for three years in preventive detention before being sentenced for the crime. In 1987 he was acquitted by the supreme Court of Cassation for lack of evidence.\n\nThe far-right Neo-fascist organization \"Ordine Nuovo\", founded by Pino Rauti, came under suspicion. On 3 March 1972 Franco Freda, Giovanni Ventura and Rauti were arrested and charged with planning the terrorist attacks of 25 April 1969 at the Trade Fair and Railway Station in Milan, and the August 8 and August 9, 1969 bombings of several trains, followed by the Piazza Fontana bombing.\n\nIn 1987, after a number of trials, the Court of Cassation ruled that despite evidence linking Freda, Ventura, and others to the Piazza Fontana bombing, it could not be determined for certain who planned it, nor who carried it out. The Court confirmed the convictions of Freda and Ventura in relation to the bombs placed in Padua and Milan, for which they each received a sentence of 16 years.\n\nAlso in 1987 the Milanese Guido Salvini reopened the investigation based on new evidence. Martino Siciliano, a member of \"Ordine Nuovo\", decided to cooperate when presented with a taped telephone conversation between Delfo Zorzi and some associates which contained the observation that, \"the Siciliano problem could be solved with a 9 caliber gun\". Siciliano said that he had been present at a meeting with Zorzi and Carlo Maria Maggi in April 1969, in the Ezzelino bookstore in Padua owned by Giovanni Ventura, when Freda announced the program of the train bombings. Despite a death threat from Pino Rauti, electrician Tullio Fabris testified that he had supplied Freda with primers and timers.\n\nCarlo Digilio, confessed explosives expert and advisor to the \"Ordine Nuovo\" in the Veneto was convicted in June 2001, which was subsequently upheld on appeal in March 2004. Digilio displayed instances of memory loss after suffering a stroke in 1995. His subsequent confusion regarding dates and events led to the Court declaring him an unreliable witness.\n\nIn a 2004 trial of neo-fascists the Milan Court of Appeal attributed the Piazza Fontana bombing to Freda and Ventura. However, since they had been acquitted in 1987 they could not be retried.\n\nIn 1998, Milan judge Guido Salvini indicted U.S. Navy officer David Carrett on charges of political and military espionage for his participation in the Piazza Fontana bombing et al. Salvini also opened up a case against Sergio Minetto, an Italian official of the U.S.-NATO intelligence network, and \"collaboratore di giustizia\" (Uncle Otto), who served as the CIA coordinator in Northeastern Italy in the sixties and seventies. The newspaper \"la Repubblica\" reported that Carlo Rocchi, CIA's man in Milan, was discovered in 1995 searching for information concerning Operation Gladio.\n\nGeneral Gianandelio Maletti, the head of SID (), and a member of the secret \"masonic\" society P2 was found responsible for obstructing the investigation and withholding information during the first trial in Catanzaro. In an effort to protect extreme right-wing groups, Maletti destroyed a report concerning the Padua cell of \"Ordine Nuovo\" and arranged for potential witnesses to leave the country. Maletti subsequently emigrated to South Africa.\n\nCaptain Antonio Labruna, of SID, was also implicated in aided and abetting the departure of witnesses Marco Pozzan and Giannettini Guido. Maletti and Labruna were convicted in January 1987.\n\nSeveral elements brought the investigators to the theory that members of extreme right-wing groups were responsible for the bombings:\n\n\nMain stages of the trial:\n\n\nThe supreme Court of Cassation sentenced two members of the Italian secret services – General Gian Adelio Maletti (1 year of jail) and Captain Antonio Labruna (10 months) – to having misled the investigation and acquitted Marshal Gaetano Tanzilli, accused of perjury.\n\n\nStefano Tringali, accused of abetting, benefited from the prescription after being sentenced to one year in prison in the appeal trial.\nThe Supreme Court rejected as «false» Digilio's «alleged affiliation with US services». The Court found that in 1969 the Venetian group of Zorzi and Maggi organized the attacks, but it is not proven their participation in the massacre of 12 December.\nThe Court certifies that Martino Siciliano (another Ordine Nuovo's pentito) attended to the assembly with Zorzi and Maggi in April 1969, in the library Ezzelino of Padua, where Freda announced the program of the train bombings. But since those bombs didn't kill nobody, it's not evidence the involvement of Zorzi and Maggi in the next subversive strategy of Freda and Ventura, and in the other acts of terrorism. The tragic events of 12 December 1969 didn't represent a loose cannon, but were the result of a subversive operation enrolled in a program subversive well settled.\n\nThe bombing was the work of a right wing group, \"Ordine Nuovo\" (\"New Order\"), whose aim was to prevent the country falling into the hands of the left-wing by duping the public into believing the bombings were part of a communist insurgency.\n\nA 2000 parliamentary report published by the Olive Tree coalition (an alliance of the Communist Party and the Democratic Party of the Left) claimed that \"U.S. intelligence agents were informed in advance about several right-wing terrorist bombings, including the December 1969 Piazza Fontana bombing in Milan and the Piazza della Loggia bombing in Brescia five years later, but did nothing to alert the Italian authorities or to prevent the attacks from taking place.\" It also alleged that Pino Rauti (current leader of the MSI Fiamma-Tricolore party), a journalist and founder of the far-right Ordine Nuovo (New Order) subversive organization, received regular funding from a press officer at the U.S. embassy in Rome. \"So even before the 'stabilising' plans that Atlantic circles had prepared for Italy became operational through the bombings, one of the leading members of the subversive right was literally in the pay of the American embassy in Rome\", the report says.\n\nPaolo Emilio Taviani, the Christian Democrat co-founder of Gladio (NATO's stay-behind anti-Communist organization in Italy), told investigators that the SID military intelligence service was about to send a senior officer from Rome to Milan to prevent the bombing, but decided to send a different officer from Padua in order to put the blame on left-wing anarchists. In an August 2000 interview with \"Il Secolo XIX\" newspaper Taviani said that he did not believe the US Central Intelligence Agency was involved in organising the Milan bomb. However he alleged \"It seems to me certain, however, that agents of the CIA were among those who supplied the materials and who muddied the waters of the investigation.\"\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1794986", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1794986", "title": "Relapse Records", "text": "Relapse Records\n\nRelapse Records is an American independent record label based in Upper Darby, Pennsylvania. It was founded by Matthew F. Jacobson in 1990. The label features many grindcore, death metal, and sludge metal artists.\n\nThe label was started by Matthew F. Jacobson in August, 1990 in his parents' basement in Aurora, Colorado. The first two releases on the label were 7-inch singles by the bands Velcro Overdose and Face of Decline, closely followed by three death metal bands that would become among the biggest on the label, Deceased, Suffocation, and Incantation.\n\nAfter this, Jacobson became acquainted with William Yurkiewicz Jr., who became his partner in the record label. Yurkiewicz had founded his own record label, which was soon to release albums from the bands General Surgery, Disrupt, Destroy, Misery, and Yurkiewicz's own band Exit-13. The two joined forces to create Relapse Records, aiming to release high-quality, professionally packaged extreme music.\n\nIn 1991, the label moved their headquarters to Millersville, Pennsylvania. In 1992, the label expanded its range with the creation of its subsidiary label called Release Entertainment, which specializes in experimental, ambient, industrial, and noise titles. With continued growth came a mail-order/wholesale operation that soon became the largest underground distribution center for all things metal in the United States . The mail-order service carried a wide array of extreme music recordings and merchandise, as well as publications from around the world.\n\nThroughout the years Relapse has continued to grow and sign on more influential artists from a broader range of genres. In 1996, Relapse unveiled the Resound Music Resource Guide. Resound gave fans direct access to the label's roster through interviews and reviews, as well as being part mail-order catalog.\n\nIn 1998, Relapse opened a promotions office in Berlin, as well as establishing a German Distribution deal. In 2003, Relapse held a music festival - the Relapse Contamination Festival took place on January 18 and 19 at the Trocadero Theatre in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and featured various Relapse artists. In 2000, the label relocated to Upper Darby, outside of Philadelphia and began plans to include a physical record store . In June 2001, the label opened their first record store off of South Street in Philadelphia.\n\nIn 2010, Relapse announced that they had done a deal with intellectual property lawyer Eric Greif and Perseverance Holdings Ltd. to take over Chuck Schuldiner's catalog and the Death and Control Denied names internationally. Death's 1995 sixth studio album, Symbolic was excluded from the deal as the rights for said record remain with Roadrunner Records.\n\nOn August 5, 2011, Relapse announced a pay what you want partnership with Moshpit Tragedy Records, which will see one mp3 album from the Relapse catalog issued weekly through MoshpitTragedy.com.\n\nThe label specializes in various types of heavy metal. Recently, with the increasing popularity of extreme metal, Relapse Records has ostensibly become more mainstream, with bands on their roster frequently appearing on the front cover of the magazine \"Kerrang!\" and video plays on TV music channels, along with some albums charting on the \"Billboard\" 200. The word has also been spread by the sponsorship of such festivals as the Milwaukee Metalfest.\n\nIt would be hard however to label the company as dealing in one specific style or another, as there are artists of such a wide variety on their roster, ranging from stoner rock and hardcore bands through to grindcore and death metal all the way to retro thrash metal and doom.\n\nAlthough much of the music released on Relapse is from bands in various punk and metal subgenres, the label has also released records from several artists in other genres, including math rock (Don Caballero), shoegazing (Nothing, Cloakroom), post-punk (Publicist UK), space rock (Zombi), stand-up comedy (Brian Posehn) and synthwave (Survive).\n\nThe officially licensed reissues the label has also released also adds many other genres into their style.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1794996", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1794996", "title": "Thomas Harrison (architect)", "text": "Thomas Harrison (architect)\n\nThomas Harrison (7 August (baptised) 1744 – 29 March 1829) was an English architect and bridge engineer who trained in Rome, where he studied classical architecture. Returning to England, he won the competition in 1782 for the design of Skerton Bridge in Lancaster. After moving to Lancaster he worked on local buildings, received commissions for further bridges, and designed country houses in Scotland. In 1786 Harrison was asked to design new buildings within the grounds of Lancaster and Chester castles, projects that occupied him, together with other works, until 1815. On both sites he created accommodation for prisoners, law courts, and a shire hall, while working on various other public buildings, gentlemen's clubs, churches, houses, and monuments elsewhere. His final major commission was for the design of Grosvenor Bridge in Chester.\n\nSome of Harrison's designs, including his buildings at Lancaster Castle, were Gothic in style, but most were Neoclassical, particularly those at Chester Castle. He was regarded at the time, and since, as a major influence in the emergence of the Greek Revival in British architecture. A bridge he designed at the start of his career, and another towards the end of his career, incorporated innovative features; Skerton Bridge was the first substantial bridge in England to have a flat roadway, and the Grosvenor Bridge was the longest single-arched masonry bridge in the world at the time of its construction. Many of Harrison's structures have survived, most of them now designated by English Heritage as listed buildings. Despite his work being nationally admired he spent his entire career in northwest England, visiting London only occasionally; most of his buildings were in Lancashire, Cheshire, and the nearby counties.\n\nThomas Harrison was born in Richmond, Yorkshire, England, the son of a joiner, also named Thomas. His precise date of birth is not known, but it is likely that he was baptised on 7 August 1744. Little is known about his early life, other than he attended Richmond Grammar School, and it is presumed that he worked with his father. In 1769 he was sponsored by a local landowner, Sir Lawrence Dundas of Aske Hall, to join George Cuitt (who later became a landscape painter) to study in Rome. Here he studied at the Accademia di San Luca, and during his seven years in Rome, amongst other activities, made drawings of Roman structures, including temples and Trajan's Column. In 1770 Harrison submitted a design to Pope Clement XIV for converting the Vatican Cortile del Belvedere into a museum for antique statues. This was \"favourably received but not in the end adopted\". Three years later he entered the Accademia's competition to re-plan the Piazza del Popolo. His design was unsuccessful, but it was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1777. Following the failure of this design to be accepted, he petitioned the pope, and was awarded gold and silver medals, and made Accademico di Merito. He was then commissioned by the pope to alter the sacristy of St Peter's, but the pope died before the work started. Harrison returned to England in 1776, probably via France, as he made drawings of buildings in Nîmes and Paris. He produced designs for a bridge and a road in London, which were not accepted, and he returned to Richmond in 1778.\n\nThe major works executed by Harrison at the start and end of his career were bridges: Skerton Bridge in Lancaster and Grosvenor Bridge in Chester, both of which incorporated innovative features. In 1782 he won the first prize in a competition to design a bridge to cross the River Lune at Lancaster and to replace a medieval bridge. After some amendments to the design, the foundation stone was laid in June 1783, and Skerton Bridge was completed in September 1787, at a cost of £14,000 (). The bridge was carried on five elliptical arches, and was the first in England to have a flat road surface. Harrison subsequently received further commissions for bridges, including St Mary's Bridge in Derby (1788–93), Harrington Bridge near Sawley, Derbyshire (1789–90), and Stramongate Bridge in Kendal, Cumbria (1791–94), followed by smaller bridges in Lancashire and Cheshire. He was appointed unofficially as the bridge master of Lancashire, and having carried out the duties of country surveyor for Cheshire since 1800, was officially appointed to the post in 1815. Harrison's later bridges in Cheshire included the Mersey Bridge at Warrington (1812–17), and Cranage Bridge near Holmes Chapel (1815–16). These were the only bridges he designed to be built in timber rather than in stone, and both have been replaced. They were the first bridges of their type to be built in England, and were his only bridges to be regarded as \"failures\". During his career, Harrison was consulted about the design of other bridges in the country.\n\nTowards the end of his career, Harrison worked on two bridges in Chester. At the time the only road crossing over the River Dee was the medieval Old Dee Bridge, which was becoming inadequate for the increasing volume of traffic. In 1825 Harrison added three new arches on the upstream side of the bridge, and built a footway that was corbeled-out, also on the upstream side. Meanwhile, negotiations had been underway for a much more substantial bridge. In 1825 an Act of Parliament was passed for the Grosvenor Bridge to be built downstream from the Old Dee Bridge. To provide access to the new bridge, properties, including a church, had to be demolished, and Harrison was involved in designing the new approach to the bridge, which was named Grosvenor Street. He also prepared three different plans for the bridge, one in iron, the others in stone; one of the stone bridges had three arches, the other a single arch spanning . The single-arch bridge would be the longest single-arch stone bridge in the world at the time, and there were doubts about its stability. Harrison's design was supported by the engineers James Trubshaw and John Rennie, and Trubshaw made a limestone model of the bridge to confirm its stability. By this time Harrison was aged over 80, and in 1826 he resigned from the commission. Later that year the design was costed by Thomas Telford, and the town council subsequently accepted the design. Trubshaw was in charge of the construction, with Jesse Hartley as his clerk-of-works. The foundation stone was laid in 1827 by the Earl of Grosvenor (after whose family the bridge was named), and work began the following year. It was formally opened in 1832 by the future Queen Victoria, and traffic began to cross it the following year. The total cost of the bridge was just under £50,000 (). Harrison did not live to see it completed, as he died in 1829.\n\nAround the time that Harrison was involved in the construction of Skerton Bridge, he received other commissions for work in Lancaster. These included the addition of a clock tower to the Town Hall, the addition of a tower and spire to St John's Church, and the building of Bridge Houses on the east side of Skerton Bridge. In October 1786 Harrison was asked to prepare plans for substantial improvements to Lancaster Castle; in January that year he had also won the competition for major improvements to Chester Castle. He worked on both projects simultaneously for the next 30 years, and beyond that until 1815 in Chester, where he added further new buildings. In both projects he designed buildings for prisoners and prison staff, courtrooms and a Shire Hall. Both towns already had gaols, but there was a national move in the later part of the 18th century to improve them, following the campaigns by penal formers led by John Howard. Amongst these reforms were the separation of men and women, and of criminals and debtors, which were incorporated into Harrison's designs.\n\nHarrison did not create an overall plan for his work on the site; a series of plans for different buildings were prepared and building works continued until 1792. The new buildings had to be placed between the existing medieval castle buildings, including the keep, towers and the gatehouse. Harrison decided to design them with Gothic motifs, such as battlements and windows with pointed heads. Construction started in 1788, and the first building to be completed was the Keeper's House, standing to the right of the gatehouse. The next substantial building to be completed was the Female Felon's Prison on the other side of the gatehouse. He designed an arcade on the south side of the keep to give some shelter to the debtors as they walked round their courtyard. He later added two storeys to provide more accommodation for debtors, and completed the Male Felon's Prison to the north of the keep. By 1794 these buildings and other improvements had cost £10,853 (), more than had been expected. By 1795 Harrison had moved from Lancaster to Chester, from where he continued to supervise the work on both sites. At Lancaster this work included rebuilding the Crown Court and the Shire Hall. At that time the Crown Court was held in the medieval hall of the castle, and civil cases were held in the Shire Hall in the keep. The new buildings form a symmetrical group to the west of the keep, and were completed in 1798, although the internal decoration and furnishings were not finished until some years later by Joseph Gandy. The Crown Court is a simple rectangular room, measuring about by high and wide. The Shire Hall has a plan of half a polygon about in diameter. Six Gothic columns support a panelled vault covering the main part of the courtroom. Around the perimeter is an arcade, and the judge's bench has an elaborate canopy in Coade stone. The precise cost of these buildings is unknown, but in 1807 an estimate of more than £40,000 () was given.\n\nIn contrast with Lancaster, Harrison was able to prepare an organised plan for the gaol, as it was to be built on a new site behind the Elizabethan Shire Hall on land sloping down to the River Dee. Also in contrast to Lancaster, the buildings were to be in Neoclassical style. The Gaoler's House would stand behind the Shire Hall, overlooking the exercise courtyards. Inside the semi-octagonal perimeter wall of the site would stand two-storey blocks to house the prisoners. The site was staked-out in November 1786, but nothing could be done until the necessary Act of Parliament was passed the following July. Work started on the prisoners' accommodation early in 1789 and on the Goaler's House in early 1792, and was completed two years later. Plans were then put in place for a new Shire Hall to replace the Elizabethan building, which was completed in 1802. The Shire Hall was another structure in which Harrison made innovations, in this case the use of Greek architectural motifs. Its façade is about long and high, in nineteen bays with two storeys. At its centre is a Doric-style portico with twelve columns, projecting forwards by about . Its interior contains a semi-circular courtroom with a diameter of . Its curved wall has a colonnade of ten Ionic columns, and on each side of the judge's bench are two similar columns. The room has a coffered semi-dome.\n\nIn addition to courts, and now a gaol, Chester Castle also housed a garrison of soldiers. The forecourt of the Shire Hall formed a parade ground for the garrison, and Harrison designed two new buildings for the soldiers. On the west side of the parade ground he built an Armoury, and on the east side a matching block, with more utilitarian buildings behind, to act as the Barracks. Both of the blocks consists of a two-storey building in nine bays, the fronts of which are decorated with Ionic half-columns about high. Harrison's final building in the complex was a monumental gateway or Propylaea at the entrance to the forecourt. This consists of a central block, with two lateral pavilions that originally served as guardhouses. The central block has a portico extending some in front of the pavilions, with a double colonnade of four Doric monolithic columns standing high. Above them is a triglyph frieze, and a low attic. The pavilions are lower than the central block, and decorated at their front with two Doric half-columns between pilasters. At the back the pavilions project beyond the central block and have four Doric columns. The structure, which was built between 1813 and 1815, contains 22 monolithic columns.\n\nThe first gentlemen's club to be designed by Harrison was the Lyceum in Liverpool. This contained a newsroom, a coffee house, and new premises for the Liverpool Library. It was the first building in Liverpool to incorporate Greek motifs in its design. It includes one of the earliest recessed porticoes in England, and its exterior includes Doric and Ionic columns. Inside the building, the library is a circular room about in diameter; it is top-lit with a dome. The newsroom and coffee room measure about by . The club was built between 1801 and 1802 at a cost of £11,000 (). In 1803 building commenced in Manchester of the Portico Library, which also incorporated a gentlemen's club, and introduced Greek motifs to the city. Like the Liverpool club, it contains a recessed portico with Ionic columns and half-columns. The interior measures about by ; the ground floor was used as the newsroom, the library books were arranged around a gallery, and again it was top-lit with a dome. The building was completed in 1806 and cost about £6.800 (). The third gentlemen's club was the Commercial News Room in Chester, with three Ionic half-columns on its main front. The newsroom measures about by . It opened in 1808, and is smaller than the other club's, costing about £2,700 (). All the gentlemen's clubs are still in existence, but two major buildings Harrison designed in Manchester have not survived. The Theatre Royal was built in 1806–07 at a cost of about £12,000 (); it could seat 1,020 people, but was destroyed by fire in 1844. Harrison also designed the Manchester Exchange to replace an earlier building with the same purpose. It contained a newsroom, library, dining room, and post office. The exchange was built between 1806 and 1809, and had a semi-circular front decorated with Doric half-columns, but it has since been superseded by a larger building.\n\nWhile Harrison was working on Lancaster and Chester castles, he was also involved with domestic projects, four of them around Edinburgh in Scotland. The first consisted in making alterations to Gosford House for the 7th Earl of Wemyss. There is circumstantial evidence that he also designed the mausoleum in the grounds of the house, but a definite attribution cannot be made. This commission led, through personal contacts, for further work. The first was to build Kennet House near Clackmannan (now demolished) for Sir Thomas Dundas; it was Harrison's first major house. He then made extensions to Broomhall, a house near Dunfermline, for Thomas Bruce, 7th Earl of Elgin. Finally in Scotland, Harrison prepared plans for another new house, Colinton House near Edinburgh, for the banker Sir William Forbes. Following this, Harrison is credited with the design of Quernmore Park Hall, near Lancaster, for Charles Gibson, a house built between 1795 and 1798.\n\nIn 1804 Harrison made a series of plans for the rebuilding of Lowther Hall in Westmorland, but these were not accepted. However he was successful with his plans to enlarge and remodel Gredington, a house in North Wales, for Lord Kenyon, executed between 1807 and 1811 at a cost of £6,675 (). Between 1808 and 1810 Harrison converted three rooms on the west side of the first floor of Tabley House, near Knutsford, Cheshire, into a picture gallery for Sir John Fleming Leicester. This was followed by a series of new houses, Oughtrington Hall, near Lymm, Cheshire, Woodbank, on the edge of Stockport (then in Cheshire), Glan-yr-Afon in Llanferres, North Wales, Dee Hills House in Chester, and Grove House in Allerton near Liverpool.\n\nIn 1820 Harrison designed Watergate House on a corner site in Watergate Street, Chester; it is one of the largest private houses in the town. The entrance to the house is on the corner, leading to a circular lobby and a square entrance hall, which is top-lit by a dome with a lantern. Harrison's last commission for a country house in Cheshire was his design for Tilstone Lodge near the village of Tilstone Fearnall; this has a \"porte-cochère\" supported by four Doric columns. At about this time Harrison was also designing alterations to the east wing of Chirk Castle in North Wales. In late 1821 he was commissioned to work on Hardwick Grange near Hadnall in Shropshire for Rowland Hill, 1st Viscount Hill, which involved alterations to the front of the house, and the addition of a new dining-room. At the request of the owner, this was in Gothic style; the house has since been demolished. In 1822–23 Harrison built a house for himself, St Martin's Lodge in Nicholas Street, Chester, which consists of a simple villa. His last work for a private client was again for Roland Hill, a building called the Citadel in Hawkstone Park, Shropshire. It was built as a dower house for his mother, and has the appearance of a small castle, with three circular battlemented towers.\n\nOnly a small proportion of Harrison's work was on churches. In 1804 he re-faced the south side of St Peter's Church in Chester, and he carried out further alterations to the church in 1813. Between 1805 and 1806 he redesigned the nave of St John the Baptist's Church in Whittington, Shropshire, which had been badly damaged in a storm. He did design one new church, the Wesleyan Methodist Church in St John Street, Chester, which was built in 1811. Although his design was used for the exterior, the internal decoration and fittings were planned by his main contractor, William Cole, and the church has been much altered since. In 1810 came the commission for what is described as \"without doubt his [Harrison's] best work at a church\", to rebuild the steeple of the Church of Our Lady and Saint Nicholas, Liverpool. Earlier that year the spire on the medieval tower had collapsed, destroying the tower in the process. The work was completed in 1815 at a cost of over £22,000 (). The steeple has a height of , its buttresses rising above the top of the tower as pinnacles, the open-work spire being supported by flying buttresses. Harrison also designed a domed ceiling for St Paul's Church in Liverpool, but this has since been demolished.\n\nBetween 1814 and 1816 a chapel was built to Harrison's design at West Hall, High Legh to replace an earlier chapel. This was a simple building that burnt out in 1891, some of its fabric being incorporated into a new church on the site, St John's Church. In 1818 the Right Revd George Henry Law, Bishop of Chester, asked Harrison to carry out work on the south transept of Chester Cathedral, which was showing signs of instability. This work involved building deep buttresses at the south end of the transept, and giving some attention to the gutters.\n\nHarrison designed a variety of other structures, one of the most important of which was the replacement of Northgate in Chester, at the suggestion of Earl Grosvenor, mayor of the city in 1807. The other three gateways, Eastgate, Bridgegate, and Watergate, which carried the footway of the City Walls over the medieval entrances to the city, had been replaced during the 18th century. The earl wanted the structure to be designed in Gothic style, but Harrison advised that it would be more fitting to the adjacent Roman walls for it to be Neoclassical, and after much debate this was accepted. The gateway consists of three arches, a wide central arch for vehicles, and two narrower arches for pedestrians, incorporating pairs of monolithic Doric columns. Harrison then designed Denbighshire Infirmary in North Wales, built between 1810 and 1813, and in about 1820 he made some internal alterations to the Chester Exchange. In 1820 Harrison was consulted by Magdalen College, Oxford, about improvements to New Building, a block of the college built in 1733, and on other alterations. His plans for New Building were adopted, and the additions were made in 1824 at a cost of £2,600 ().\n\nHarrison was also involved in the building of a series of monuments. His first commission was to design the Jubilee Tower on the summit of Moel Famau, the highest point of the Clwydian Range in North Wales, to celebrate the Golden Jubilee of George III in 1810. This consisted of an obelisk in two stages on a broad base. The obelisk collapsed in 1862, and the base was remodelled in 1970 to make a viewing platform. The design of Lord Hill's Column in Shrewsbury, Shropshire, has been attributed to Harrison, but this is incorrect. The architect was Edward Haycock, but Harrison did make alterations to the design, changing the style of the column, and adding a pedestal with statues of lions; and Harrison did supervise the construction. Harrison designed The Marquess of Anglesey's Column in Llanfairpwll on Anglesey to commemorate the feats of Henry Paget, 1st Marquess of Anglesey. This was constructed in 1816–17 at a cost of nearly £2,000 (). His last memorial was a ceremonial gateway, the Admiralty Arch, at Holyhead, also on Anglesey, to commemorate the landing there of George IV in 1821. It consists of an archway with Doric columns, and cost £600 (), and was opened in 1824.\n\nHarrison married Margaret Shackleton at Lancaster Priory in 1785. The couple had three children who survived childhood; a son, John, who died in 1802, and two daughters. Harrison died aged 85 at his home, St Martin's Lodge, Chester, in 1829. He was buried in the churchyard of St Bridget's Church, Chester, but his remains were moved to Blacon Cemetery when the churchyard was cleared in about 1964. His estate amounted to £6,000 ().\n\nAn additional arch was added to Skerton Bridge in about 1849 to allow for the passage of the \"Little\" North Western Railway (since closed) beneath it. The bridge continues to be used by heavy traffic. A survey in 1995 concluded that the bridge is still strong enough to carry vehicles ten times the weight of the heaviest vehicles of the time it was built. Grosvenor Bridge remains in use, carrying the A483 road over the River Dee, and is still the longest single-span masonry bridge in Britain.\n\nOther than the smaller bridges, almost all the structures designed by Harrison have been designated as listed buildings by English Heritage, Cadw, or Historic Scotland. Some of the buildings he completely designed (rather than altered) have been listed at the highest levels, Grade I in England and Wales, and Category A in Scotland. Grade I includes buildings that \"are of exceptional interest, sometimes considered to be internationally important\"; only 2.5% of listed buildings are in this Grade. Category A consists of \"buildings of national or international importance, either architectural or historic, or fine little-altered examples of some particular period, style or building type\", and includes about 7% of the Scottish listed buildings. These structures are, in Chester, Grosvenor Bridge, and Northgate, and in Scotland, the Mausoleum at Gosford House, and Colinton House. Lancaster Castle as a whole is listed at Grade I, and at Chester Castle four of Harrison's buildings are listed separately at this Grade: the main block containing the Shire Hall, the Propylaea, and the two blocks flanking the forecourt.\n\nA number of Harrison's structures in England and Wales are listed at Grade II*, the middle grade for those that are \"particularly important buildings of more than special interest\"; 5.5% of all listed buildings are Grade II*. They include Skerton Bridge, Bridge Houses, Lancaster, St Mary's Bridge, Derby, Quernmore Park Hall, the Lyceum in Liverpool, The Portico Library in Manchester, Woodbank in Stockport, the Marquess of Anglesey's Column, Watergate House in Chester, and the Citadel at Hawkstone Park.\n\nThat Harrison was a fine innovative designer of bridges is evidenced by the continuing successful use by modern heavy traffic on Skerton and Grosvenor Bridges, and on St Mary's Bridge in Derby. As an architect, the editors of the Cheshire volume of the \"Buildings of England\" series describe him as \"one of the most important of Cheshire's architects\". Harrison's first biographer, Arthur Blomfield, said he was \"almost, if not quite, the first architectural genius in the kingdom\".\n\nAlthough most of his designs were in Neoclassical style, he also created buildings in Gothic style, for example at Lancaster Castle, and Hardwick Grange. Nevertheless, he is considered to be one of the main influences in the Greek Revival of architecture in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. The architectural historian Giles Worsley describes him as \"the first English architect to grasp the full potential of the Greek Revival\", and David Watkin says he is the \"finest\" of the architects who revived the forms of Greek architecture. Of the Shire Hall in Chester Castle, Worsley says it is \"the first serious monument of the Greek Revival\". Writing about Harrison's designs at Chester Castle, Pevsner says \"What he [Harrison] has achieved here is one of the most powerful monuments of the Greek Revival in the whole of England\".\n\nHarrison spent the whole of his career in the northwest of England and, other than his houses in Scotland and his work in Oxford, his works were confined to Lancashire, Cheshire, Shropshire, Cumbria, Derbyshire, and North Wales. He was never a member of the Royal Academy or any other London-based institution, and only a rare visitor to London once his practice was established. Nevertheless, Charles Cockerell (later to become the president of the Royal Institute of British Architects) said of him in 1828 that he was \"undoubtedly the noblest genius in architecture we have had\".\n\n\nSome of Harrison's drawings and plans are held in the Cheshire Record Office, including that of Trajan's Column, together with his design for the Piazza del Popolo, and drawings of buildings in France.<br>\nThe model is still in existence, and is on show in Castle Drive. The model has been listed by English Heritage at Grade II.<br>\nIn this context, the term \"felon\" was applied to convicted criminals who had not been sentenced to death, and could not be transported.<br>\nHarrison's wooden model of the plan is still in existence, and is in the care of the Cheshire Museum Service.<br>\nThere is no doubt about the attribution to Harrison of Woodbank, Dee Hills House, and Grove House; that of Oughtrington Hall is likely; but that of Glan-yr-Afon is more uncertain.\n"}
{"id": "1794997", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1794997", "title": "Bransbury", "text": "Bransbury\n\nBransbury is a hamlet in Hampshire, England, part of the parish of Barton Stacey. The nearest village is Barton Stacey (where the 2011 census was included), halfway between Winchester and Andover; there is a junction for Bransbury on the A303 towards Exeter. Bransbury has twenty-two dwellings: a collection of agricultural workers’ cottages with gardens of generous proportions, Bransbury Manor, which dates from the 18th century, and Bransbury Mill. The Crook and Shears Inn public house was converted into a dwelling in the late 20th century. The hamlet straddles the River Dever.\n\nThe road from Barton Stacey to Bransbury is prone to pooling water, because of its position on the flood plain.\n\nThe Anglo-Saxon Chronicles and Charters are the first written records (855 A.D.) that Bransbury is mentioned in.\n\nThe Andyke in Bransbury is an Iron Age ditch and bank survival of a promontory fort with evidence of round houses, and is a Historic England Scheduled Monument. The course of the Roman road which crosses the parish via Bransbury Common can be traced from Winchester to Marlborough and beyond towards Cirencester. There is also evidence of a Roman camp east of Manor Farm, with the remains of ditches and banks. Further evidence of Romano-British inhabitants was found in 1977 with the discovery of a ‘plank’ burial of a young woman between Barton Stacey and Bransbury.\n\nThe manor of Bransbury has been farmed from at least the time of Domesday and was granted by Henry VIII to the Dean and Chapter of Winchester and their successors for a yearly rent. The four terraced houses known as The Barracks are Grade II listed buildings. Development in recent times has been limited to the conversion of farm buildings.\n\nBransbury is home to the multi-award-winning Delicate Owl, a business that hand makes organic soap and beauty products.\n\nThere is a holiday cottage for rent in Bransbury - the Old Granary. Next to Bransbury Manor, it is pet friendly. It is popular with visiting fishermen and their families, and the acclaimed Dever Springs Fishery is a short walk away.\n\nBransbury common is a large stretch of common land between Bransbury and Newton Stacey. It is classified as a SSSI and a nature conservation area. It consists of broadleaved, mixed, and yew woodland, fenland, marshland, swamp, and has the river Dever joining the river Test. It consists of 392 acres of common land and disused water meadows embracing a remarkable range of grass and sedgeland that is probably unparalleled in southern England. It is also a public access area that is subject to the Countryside Right of Way (CRoW) Act 2000.\n\nThe common is popular with walkers, who admire the broad and bushy riverside pasture with views of Harewood Forest. The path is ill-defined in places, and it is advisable to keep close to the left edge of the common to avoid the marsh. The common is very popular with birdwatchers, and often has cows grazing on it.\n"}
{"id": "1795006", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1795006", "title": "Inner class", "text": "Inner class\n\nIn object-oriented programming (OOP), an inner class or nested class is a class declared entirely within the body of another class or interface. It is distinguished from a subclass.\n\nAn instance of a normal or top-level class can exist on its own. By contrast, an instance of an inner class cannot be instantiated without being bound to a top-level class.\n\nLet us take the abstract notion of a codice_1 with four codice_2s. Our codice_2s have a specific feature that relies on being part of our codice_1. This notion does not represent the codice_2s as codice_2s in a more general form that could be part of any vehicle. Instead, it represents them as specific to a codice_1. We can model this notion using inner classes as follows:\n\nWe have the top-level class codice_1. Instances of class codice_1 are composed of four instances of the class codice_2. This particular implementation of codice_2 is specific to a car, so the code does not model the general notion of a wheel that would be better represented as a top-level class. Therefore, it is semantically connected to the class codice_1 and the code of codice_2 is in some way coupled to its outer class, being a composition unit of a car. The wheel for a particular car is unique to that car, but for generalization, the wheel is an aggregation unit to the car.\n\nInner classes provide a mechanism to accurately model this connection. We can refer to our codice_2 class as codice_15, codice_1 being the top-level class and codice_2 being the inner class.\n\nInner classes therefore allow for the object orientation of certain parts of the program that would otherwise not be encapsulated into a class.\n\nLarger segments of code within a class might be better modeled or refactored as a separate top-level class, rather than an inner class. This would make the code more general in its application and therefore more re-usable but potentially might be premature generalization. This may prove more effective, if code has many inner classes with the shared functionality.\n\nIn Java there are four types of nested class:\n\n\nInner class The following categories are called \"inner classes\". Each instance of these classes has a reference to an \"enclosing instance\" (i.e. an instance of the enclosing class), except for local and anonymous classes declared in static context. Hence, they can implicitly refer to instance variables and methods of the enclosing class. The enclosing instance reference can be explicitly obtained via codice_19. Inner classes may not have static variables or methods, except for compile-time constant variables. When they are created, they must have a reference to an instance of the enclosing class; which means they must either be created within an instance method or constructor of the enclosing class, or (for member and anonymous classes) be created using the syntax codice_20.\n\n\n\nLocal inner classes are often used in Java to define callbacks for GUI code. Components can then share an object that implements an event handling interface or extends an abstract adapter class, containing the code to be executed when a given event is triggered.\n\nAnonymous inner classes are also used where the event handling code is only used by one component and therefore does not need a named reference.\n\nThis avoids a large monolithic method with multiple if-else branches to identify the source of the event. This type of code is often considered messy and the inner class variations are considered to be better in all regards.\n\n"}
{"id": "1795010", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1795010", "title": "The Bouncer (video game)", "text": "The Bouncer (video game)\n\nThe game tells the story of three bouncers in the fictional city of Edge on a rescue mission to save their young friend from the Mikado Group, a solar technology megacorporation owned by the megalomaniacal Dauragon C. Mikado. The game is structured like a \"playable action movie,\" with the plot unfolding differently depending on which character the player chooses for specific gameplay sequences.\n\n\"The Bouncer\" was Square's first game on the PlayStation 2, and although it received considerable press coverage before its release, and was greatly anticipated as one of the marquee titles in the first batch of PS2 games, it was met with poor sales and mixed reviews.\n\nControls in \"The Bouncer\" are similar to those in the \"Tobal\" series. Certain buttons denote high, middle, and low attacks, whilst others are used for jumping attacks, blocking, and special moves. Players have a health meter during gameplay, which, if depleted, means the player dies. Players also have a limited amount of guard points available to them, although this is not represented by an onscreen meter. As the player blocks, the amount of guard points diminish. When they are gone completely, the player can no longer block.\n\nThe game's combat uses ragdoll physics, which allows characters to be launched several feet into the air, making it possible to juggle enemies by striking them repeatedly. Enemies can also be thrown or otherwise knocked into one another, causing all of them to take damage at once.\n\n\"The Bouncer\" is structured as a series of short gameplay segments interspersed with cinematic cutscenes that tell the game's story. With the Active Character Selection (ACS) system, when a cutscene concludes, the player is given the choice to control one of the three protagonists and proceed onto the next gameplay segment. The player then controls this character for the duration of the level, whilst the other two characters are controlled by the AI. At the conclusion of each gameplay segment, the player is able to spend Bouncer Points (BP), the game's equivalent of experience points, using the Point Exchange System. BPs can be used to boost the character's statistics (health, power and guard) and unlock new fighting moves. Spending BPs allows the character to level up, with their rank graded on a letter scale from G to A, and finally, an S-Rank.\n\nTypical gameplay in \"The Bouncer\" consists of the player fighting groups of enemies using hand-to-hand combat techniques. Occasionally, one of the AI-controlled bouncers will do a taunt, prompting a button-press to activate a team attack (\"Trinity Rush\") which damages all enemies on screen. However, the Trinity Rush is ineffective against some bosses. In some instances, the player is also tasked with activities other than fighting, such as running through a series of hallways to avoid being caught in a flood, finding a keycard, or fooling enemies into thinking the player is one of them. In general, a gameplay segment ends when the player has either defeated all of the enemies in the area, has defeated a boss enemy, or has achieved a set goal.\n\nIn addition to the main Story Mode, there is also a single-player survival mode. Spanning ten stages and fifty enemies, every time the player survives a round, the gameplay gets progressively difficult. At the start of each stage, the player's health bar does not return to full, but remains where it was at the end of the previous stage.\n\n\"The Bouncer\" supports the PlayStation 2 multitap accessory, and the game's multiplayer Versus Mode supports up to four players simultaneously in the \"Battle Royal\" mode. Battle Royal can also be played by a single player against three AI-controlled opponents, or by two players against two AI-controlled opponents.\n\nVoiced by (English): Paul Stephen<br>Voiced by (Japanese): Takahiro Sakurai\n\nA bouncer at the bar Fate, Sion is the game's main protagonist.

A kind man, he adopted Dauragon when he found him wandering the city streets in a storm.\n\nAs each bouncer has their own unique story, how the game develops depends on which characters are selected for each level. Only by playing through the game as all three characters can the complete story be revealed.\n\nThe game begins with a news report on Mikado's new solar powered generator satellite, which uses a large mirror to generate electricity from solar rays. It then converts the electricity to microwave radiation, which it beams back to a ground station on Earth, which subsequently converts it back to electricity and distributes it around the planet. Meanwhile, Leann receives a message that Mikado have located Dominique. She expresses surprise that \"they beat us to it,\" and rushes out.\n\nAt Fate, Dominique celebrates Sion's one year anniversary as a bouncer by giving him a pendant. However, Mikado Special Forces led by Mugetsu storm the bar and abduct her. Volt says they will have taken her to the Mikado Building, and Kou calls Leann, learning there is a train heading for the building in thirty minutes. Leann promises she will back him up in her ship, the \"Orage\". Kou, Sion and Volt catch the train, which is carrying rocket fuel for the launch of the satellite. On board, they meet Echidna, who is shocked to see Volt. They fight and defeat her, and she jumps from the train into a river.\n\nMeanwhile, the \"Orage\" attacks the train, causing the brakes to malfunction. The trio detach the car containing the rocket fuel and jump from the train, which crashes into the station underneath the Mikado Building. They work their way up the building and find Dominique in a dome structure. Nearby, Kaldea is playing the piano. After a moment, she gets up and morphs into a panther. Meanwhile, Dauragon orders Wong to transport Dominique to the shuttle \"Galeos\". Wong protests, telling Dauragon he is using the Mikado Group for evil, something of which his father would not approve. Dauragon attacks Wong as the trio enter, and the dying Wong tells them Dauragon must be stopped. Dauragon then reveals that Dominique is his sister. He and the panther attack the trio, defeating them, and the floor falls out underneath them.\n\nThe game then cuts to the past as a young Dauragon arrives at a hospital, telling them his sister is dying. However, they turn him away. As he walks through the rain, a limousine pulls up alongside him, and Master Mikado and Wong get out, taking Dauragon and Dominique with them. Later, Mikado adopts Dauragon as his heir. After Mikado dies, Dauragon takes over the company, with Wong praising him for the man he has become, saying he would have made his father proud.\n\nMeanwhile, Sion wakes up in a storage room. Fighting his way through the building, he encounters the black panther, who leads him to a computer terminal, where he finds a file on Kaldea. Vaguely remembering her as childhood friend who was supposedly killed in an industrial accident at Mikado, Sion realizes Dauragon has been experimenting on humans. However, she is now older than him, with the file stating \"the one drawback with our present technology is the treatment ages the subject cells approximately 10 biological years.\" Sion also finds a picture of Dominique under a locked file. Meanwhile, Volt wakes up strapped to a table. He breaks free and also fights his way through the building. Elsewhere, Kou wakes up in a locker room and steals a guard's uniform, sneaking through the corridors to the upper floors.\n\nSion soon finds Dominique, but is ambushed by Mugetsu. Volt and Kou arrive and Mugetsu is defeated. The trio escape with Dominique but are soon confronted by a group of PD-4s. However, a signal is sent from an orbiting satellite, and Dominique is revealed to be a robot. She easily destroys the enemies and then collapses. Mugetsu arrives and once more takes Dominique, heading to the \"Galeos\". Volt reveals he knew Dominique was a robot, explaining she was created in the image of Dauragon's dead sister. He also reveals that he was once the personal guard of Master Mikado.\n\nAs they head to the \"Galeos\", they encounter Echidna. They fight and defeat her, but Volt spares her life as she admits killing Master Mikado and framing Volt for the murder. The \"Galeos\" takes off, but as it leaves, it is attacked by a group of fighters led by Leann, who tells the trio to use an airship to catch up to it. They again confront Mugetsu, this time they defeat Mugetsu by knocking him over of the aircraft carrier, the flames from the \"Galeos\" engines scorch Mugetsu's body and he is thrown back by a searing wave and falls into the ocean. Meanwhile, on board the \"Galeos\", Dominique is hooked up to a computer, with Dauragon using her circuitry to have the satellite fire massive lasers down onto the earth, beginning with the hospital that turned him away as a boy.\n\nThe trio make it inside the \"Galeos\", where they again encounter the panther. They defeat it, and it transforms into Kaldea. Depending on character selection:\n\n\nIn the command center of the \"Galeos\", Dauragon explains that he plans to provide unlimited energy to those who will follow him and destroy those who will not. The trio attack and kill him, releasing Dominique from the computer. If Kaldea survived the previous fight, she tells them the \"Galeos\" is designed to split into two after leaving Earth. She leads them to the back half of the ship, and sacrifices herself to save Sion and Dominique. The front half of the ship rams and destroys the satellite, with the back half returning safely to Earth.\n\nSeveral weeks later, all has returned to normal. Sion says he will tell Dominique she is a robot when the time is right. Depending on character selection:\n\n\nIf Sion has been selected as the playable character in the final fight against Dauragon, the game ends with a scene showing his initial meeting with Dominique.\n\nThe game was announced at the Spring Tokyo Game Show in March 1999, where it was revealed as Square's first PlayStation 2 title. On July 12, 1999, IGN reported that Square was working on three PlayStation 2 games; an unknown game, a \"Final Fantasy\" game and a fighting game, which was thought to be \"Ehrgeiz 2\". Footage of the game was subsequently shown at the SIGGRAPH Convention in August, at which time the game was still thought to be \"Ehrgeiz 2\". The footage showed the three main characters, which at that time were two men and one woman, fighting a group of ninja in a café. However, on August 23, MagicBox.com reported the game was not a sequel, but an original story. The title of the game was revealed on September 10, when Sony announced the PlayStation 2 launch titles.\n\nA non-playable demo was shown at the Fall Tokyo Game Show in September. IGN reported \"Square's \"Seamless Action Battle System\" means that players will roam from adventure sequence to fighting sequence without intermittent FMVs or cutscenes that look out of place; the adventure aspects blend seamlessly into massive street brawls involving as many ten characters.\" GameSpot were also very enthusiastic about the early footage from the game, writing \"\"The Bouncer\" is arguably one of the strongest visual demonstrations of the PlayStation 2 hardware thus far. Designed to appear as though you're controlling characters in a movie, \"The Bouncer\"s camera movements and special effects truly appear as though they're straight out of a Hollywood creation.\"\n\nAt the Spring Tokyo Game Show in March 2000, Square showed only a ten-second clip of the game, and revealed no new screenshots or information. They also had no release date, leading some journalists to speculate there may be problems behind the scenes. At E3 in May, Square showed some new footage from the game, although they still did not provide a playable demo. IGN was underwhelmed with the new material, feeling there appeared to be too many cutscenes in relation to actual gameplay. On July 13, GameSpot revealed the game's character designs were being handled by Tetsuya Nomura, and the game would receive a simultaneous North American/Japanese release in late 2000. However, on September 1, IGN reported DreamFactory were having difficulty working with the PlayStation 2's hardware, and the game had been pushed back to January 2001.\n\nOn September 19, IGN revealed that the game would feature Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound for the FMV cutscenes, and Square were attempting to use 5.1 sound for gameplay sections as well. GameSpot revealed more details about the game on September 20, including the three available modes of play: Story, Versus and Survival. They reported that Square expected the story mode to take players roughly seven to eight hours to complete thoroughly.\n\nOn September 21, IGN published a roundtable interview with members of the development team; character designer Tetsuya Nomura, composers Noriko Matsueda and Takahito Eguchi, and co-director Takashi Tokita. The developers outlined the gameplay mechanics, the branching story, the versus and survival modes, the music, the character design, and the challenges of working on the PlayStation 2 for the first time. Tokita claimed the most difficult aspect of the game's creation was working with the PlayStation 2's hardware. The team also said the gameplay was partially derived from DreamFactory's \"Ehrgeiz\" and \"Tobal\" games, while graphically, the atmosphere was developed with the use of filters and lighting.\n\nOn November 13, Square announced a Japanese release date of December 23. On December 18, they confirmed a North American release date of January 30, 2001, although this was quickly pushed back to March.\n\n\"The Bouncer\" was the first PlayStation 2 game to feature Dolby 5.1 sound, which was used specifically for the FMV sequences. In addition, it features voice acting with subtitles in both English and Japanese. Because the game was being considered for a North American release early in production, the English voices were recorded first. The Japanese voices were recorded and incorporated later to \"provide more of a DVD quality to the game.\"\n\n\"The Bouncer\" was scored by Noriko Matsueda and Takahito Eguchi. The game contains several vocal themes, including the original Japanese ending theme song \"Forevermore\" (\"Owaranaimono\"), performed by Reiko Noda, and the English-language theme song \"Love Is the Gift\", performed by Shanice Wilson. Takashi Tokita has commented that the lyrics of \"Love Is the Gift\", heard during the closing credits, signify the game's overall theme.\n\nTwo separate soundtracks were released; one in Japan and one in North America. The Japanese version, \"The Bouncer Original Soundtrack\", is a 2-disc, 29-track album, published on March 23, 2001 by DigiCube.\n\nThe North American version, \"The Bouncer Original Video Game Soundtrack\", is a single disc, 21-track album, published on March 26, 2001 by Tokyopop Soundtrax.\n\n\"The Bouncer\" received \"mixed or average reviews,\" and holds an aggregate score of 66 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on twenty reviews.\n\nWith the consideration of its high-profile development team, as well as the fact that it was a front-runner PlayStation 2 release, \"The Bouncer\" was highly anticipated. However, the game was perceived as a disappointment by many, and was largely seen as mediocre. Numerous aspects from the E3 trailer, such as destructible scenery, were removed in the final game, possibly in order to get the game out in time to be among the first batch of PlayStation 2 titles. Much of the criticism, however, fell on the gameplay. IGN found the controls average and the camera angles to become a major issue in the later portions of the game, where the player is confined to tight spaces. The game was also seen as having an excessive amount of cutscenes and load screens. GameCritics' Brad Galloway, for example, argued actual gameplay constitutes less than one third of the game's length.\n\nIGN's Douglass C. Perry reviewed an import version of the game prior to its release in North America, and was disappointed with the lack of depth, but impressed by other aspects. He praised the graphics, character design and CGI cutscenes. He was also impressed with the \"glowing\" effect used throughout the game; \"DreamFactory employs a \"Playboy\"-like filter that smoothes out every single bit on the screen. The effect is consistent throughout the game, and rids the PS2 of aliasing or flickering, but also provides a unique gloss that's never been used before with such success.\" He concluded that, \"despite the disappointments, I am absolutely having a great time with The Bouncer.\" In his official review of the game upon its North American release, Perry scored it 7 out of 10, writing \"The game is a letdown, but not a catastrophic one. [...] It's a good game, not a great one, and it's worth a look.\" He referred to Story Mode as a \"mixed bag of good ideas executed ineffectively,\" although he praised multiplayer mode. He concluded \"\"The Bouncer\" is not the next messiah, it's not the next wave of fighting, and frankly, it's not the paradigm for anything really new, except perhaps incredible-looking graphics. These things said, \"The Bouncer\" is a decent game. It's not horrible, it's not brilliant. It's pretty average.\"\n\nIn his look at the import version, GameSpot's Miguel Lopez called the game \"little more than a glorified and highly cinematic version of \"Final Fight\" using dated \"Tobal\" animations.\" He called the graphics \"quite competent,\" but was highly critical of the game's length, estimating a player could play thought the entire game in forty-five minutes or less, if they skipped cutscenes. In his full review, Jeff Gerstmann scored the game 6.7 out of 10. Of the graphics, he said \"Everything, from the characters to the backgrounds, looks absolutely incredible.\" However, he concluded \"\"The Bouncer\" makes a great showpiece for the PlayStation 2. It looks and sounds incredible. However, the ease and extremely short length of the game, matched with other problems like horrific camera angles and lack of a multiplayer story mode, make \"The Bouncer\" fair, at best.\"\n\nGame Revolution's Brian Gee awarded the game a C+. He wrote, \"It's easy to tell what the developers focused on, because \"The Bouncer\" is obviously one of the best-looking games on a console to date. Near flawless animations and picture perfect visuals make it a great choice to show off the sleek Sony super machine to your friends. Once the game begins, though, \"The Bouncer\" sheds it's [sic] pretty boy image and gets down and dirty.\" He was critical of the controls and the absence of a lock-on feature. Like other critics, he also had problems with the camera and the ratio of cutscenes to gameplay. He concluded \"Though many will undoubtedly be disappointed by \"The Bouncer\"s inability to live up to the hype, others will find a fancy beat 'em up to pass a few hours. Its flashy graphics are at least worth taking a look at, but its many problems just might keep it from a place in the collection.\"\n\n\"GamePro\" were more impressed, scoring the game 4.5 out 5, and writing \"\"The Bouncer\" slickly combines copious amounts of hard-hitting moves with a stellar story line all in a visually stunning world.\"\n\nBlake Fischer reviewed the PlayStation 2 version of the game for \"Next Generation\", rating it two stars out of five, and stated that \"\"The Bouncer\" manages to look good, but don't let that fool you into thinking that it's very fun.\"\n\n\"The Bouncer\" was not a commercial success. In its debut week in Japan, it sold 158,727 units, debuting as the fifth highest selling game across all systems. It went on to sell 219,858 units by the end of 2000, finishing as the 53rd highest selling game of the year, across all systems, and the 9th highest selling PlayStation 2 game of the year. It sold an additional 126,123 units in 2001, for a total of 345,981 units sold.\n\n"}

It is only available in selected primary & secondary schools. In a SAP school, several subjects may be taught in the mother tongue, alongside other subjects which are taught in English. Currently SAP schools only cater to those studying the Mandarin mother tongue, although theoretically, future SAP schools for other mother tongues are a possibility.\n\nSpecial Assistance Plan schools (or SAP schools, ) refers to schools that offers the Special Assistance Plan. The SAP is offered at both primary (elementary) school level as well as secondary (high school) level, in Special Assistance Plan primary schools () and Special Assistance Plan high schools () respectively.\n\nA student's admission to a SAP school (or any secondary school for that matter) is decided based on their results in the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE). To enter a SAP school, a student must achieve a PSLE aggregate score that puts him in the top 10% of his cohort, with an 'A' grade for both the mother tongue and English. This means that only a relatively small group of students who are academically and linguistically strong may enter a SAP school. Consequently, SAP schools have a reputation of being the \"elite\" group of secondary schools in the country, alongside independent and autonomous schools. This stems from the Singaporean tradition of effective bilingualism in the education of the elite students from SAP schools. Some students, regardless of whether they are in a SAP school, are offered a chance at effective trilingualism in secondary education starting from age 13. The first language, English, is the international language of commercial and the administrative and legal language of Singapore, a former British colony. The mother tongue reflects the cultural and ethnic identity or in recent times, the linguistic curiosity of the students, e.g. Malay and Indian students who opt to study Mandarin as second Language in Singapore. The \"third languages\" are foreign languages which are considered by MOE to be \"economically, politically and culturally vital\", such as Japanese (for those with higher PSLE scores in Chinese than English), German (for those with higher PSLE scores in English than Chinese) and French (for those with higher PSLE scores in English than Chinese).\n\nMany SAP schools were historically Chinese language medium schools, i.e. they taught all academic subjects in Mandarin (including science and mathematics), and which may have taught English as a foreign language. Following Singapore's independence in 1965, the government recognised four official languages in Singapore (English, Mandarin Chinese, Malay and Tamil), but clearly designated English as the main language of basic and higher education, government and law, science and technology as well as trade and industry. This is reflected in the Bilingual Policy which came into effect in 1966. While according official recognition to the languages of different ethno-linguistic communities in Singapore, it sought to promote English as a neutral common language to unite a culturally diverse nation of immigrants. English was also held to be the language of international higher education, science/technology and commerce. As such, it was indispensable to Singapore, given her ambition to become a 'Global City', articulated as early as 1972.\n\nAs English Language gained importance, more parents inclined to send their child to English-medium schools, which adversely affected enrollment of Chinese-medium schools. In 1977, admission to Chinese-medium elementary schools made up only 10 per cent of the nation's cohort, which increasingly reflected the increasingly critical status of the Chinese-medium schools, in stark contrast over a decade. The need to preserve traditional Chinese schools with rich heritage and culture became a pressing agenda for the government, with raising English standards and attracting capable students into such schools a key priority, as pointed out by then Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew.\n\nIn 1979, the Ministry of Education (MOE) designated nine Chinese-medium secondary schools as Special Assistance Plan (SAP) schools. These schools were intended to provide top-scoring primary school leavers with the opportunity to study both English and Mandarin to high levels of competence. Also, these schools were to preserve the character of traditional Chinese-medium secondary schools and allay fears that the Government was indifferent to Chinese language and culture amid declining enrolments in Chinese-medium schools. The selected schools were given additional teaching resources and given assistance to run classes with a lower student-to-teacher ratio.\n\nThe programme was deemed highly successful with five of the designated schools consistently attaining top ten positions in the secondary school ranking in the 1990s, outperforming several established English-medium schools. This supported the Government to further expand the programme to two other institutions with strong Chinese heritage, including Nan Chiau High School, which was initially listed as an SAP school candidate in 1978. Six top performing SAP high schools are also approved by the Ministry of Education to offer Integrated Programme (IP) to their full cohort, with The Chinese High School, Nanyang Girls' High School being the piloting schools with Hwa Chong Junior College in 2004, followed by River Valley High School in 2006 and Dunman High School in 2008. Catholic High School and CHIJ St. Nicholas Girls' School were approved to offer Joint Integrated Programme in 2013 with Singapore Chinese Girls' School.\n\nWith rapid economic development and exposure to Western, particularly American popular culture and values in the 1970s and 1980s, Singapore began to change from a lower income, poorly educated society to a more confident, educated, vocal and individualistic society. Around the same time, in the 1980s, the world was witnessing the rise of Japan and the Asian newly-industrialised economies or NIEs, of which Singapore was one. Economically, America appeared unable to compete with rising Asian manufacturing competitors, especially Japan and was facing budget deficits. Singapore politicians from the dominant People's Action Party synthesised these various situations and developed certain ideas that came to be known as the Asian Values discourse.\n\nAccording to this line of argument, Singapore, along with Taiwan, Hong Kong, South Korea and Japan, had succeeded so spectacularly in no small part because of their shared Confucianist cultural heritage, which emphasised values such as hard work, education, family unity, deference and loyalty to authority figures, community spirit (in contrast to Western individualism), etc.\n\nTo better sell this argument to a multi-ethnic population where the non-Chinese / non-'Confucianist' communities formed at least a quarter of the population, the discourse was re-branded 'Asian Values', rather than Confucian Work Ethic. In Singapore, traditional Asian culture was seen as a source of the nation's economic success thus far. As such, the government embarked on programmes and campaigns to promote traditional culture, including the revitalised \"Speak Mandarin Campaign\" (targeted at English rather than dialect speakers, as was historically the case) as well as SAP schools.\n\nThe SAP school programme is periodically criticised in the national media by Singaporeans who are concerned about the ethnic segregation that it inevitably promotes. SAP schools only offer Mother Tongue lessons in only one language (Mandarin). This may be unfair in the eyes of some since other Mother Tongue Languages are not placed at an equally high pedestal as compared to Mandarin, having no specialised programmes to promote those languages. In addition, several other subjects may also be taught in Mandarin (subjects that are usually related to Chinese culture – e.g. Chinese literature, the history of China and Chinese/English translation studies).\n"}

After receiving his university education at Magdalene College, Cambridge (honours degree and doctorate), Bourgeois spent two years at the Royal College of Music, studying composition with Herbert Howells and conducting with Sir Adrian Boult.\n\nFrom 1971 to 1984, Bourgeois was a lecturer in music at Bristol University, and director of the National Youth Orchestra from 1984 to 1993. In 1980 he began conducting the Sun Life Band (now the Stanshawe Band of Bristol), which was his introduction to brass bands. In 1994 Bourgeois was appointed Director of Music at St Paul's Girls School, London, a position previously held by a number of noted composers, including Gustav Holst and Herbert Howells.\n\nAfter retiring from this post in 2002 he and his wife settled in Mallorca. Following her death in 2006, he remarried in 2008 and moved to New York City, but returned to the United Kingdom in 2009. He also conducted for various orchestras. His symphonies included \"Jabbervocky-Extravaganza\" (1963) and the symphonic fantasy \"The Astronauts\" (1969). For his \"Symphony of Winds\", the First International Conference for Conductors, Publishers and Composers awarded him with their main commission in 1981. He also chaired Composer's Guild of Great Britain and served as the artistic director of Bristol Philharmonic Orchestra. He founded the National Youth Chamber Orchestra of Great Britain in 1988. He was also a member of the Music Advisory Panel of the Arts Council.\n\nBourgeois was a prolific composer for brass bands and wind bands. His works in that area included two Concerti for Brass Band, the Concerto Grosso, \"Blitz\", \"Diversions\", \"Serenade\", \"The Devil and the Deep Blue Sea\", and \"Apocalypse\". Reviewing Bourgeois's \"Sonata for Trombone\", David Vinning of Trombone.org wrote: \"Bourgeois is a skilled composer who knows how to write for the trombone and this piece is a major new work sure to become popular.\" Bourgeois's first band work was a concerto, adapted from a flute concerto. He has also played the tuba.\n\nBourgeois's first symphony, which he composed at the age of 18, was positively reviewed in \"The Guardian\" by Stanley Sadie, the future editor of \"Grove's Dictionary\". By 2009, Bourgeois had written 44 symphonies, well beyond the number composed by Havergal Brian, and a larger number than were produced by most 19th and 20th century composers. In an interview with Alan Rusbridger of \"The Guardian\", he said that the symphonies came \"tumbling out.\" By the time of his death in 2017, he had 116 symphonies to his name.\n\nBourgeois also composed music for the television movie \"The Crucible\", the short documentaries \"Thirty Million Letters\" (1963) and \"The Driving Force\" (1966), the TV series \"The Barchester Chronicles\", Mansfield Park (1983), and the \"Buddyboy\" episode of the TV series \"Beasts\".\n\nHis first wife, the violinist Jean Bourgeois, died of motor neuron disease on 27 November 2006. She had played in the BBC National Orchestra of Wales and was also a piano teacher. Since returning to the UK from the USA in 2009, Bourgeois had lived in Wool, Dorset, with his second wife, Norma Bourgeois. He died on 6 September 2017 in Poole, Dorset, and is survived by his wife Norma.\n\nOrchestral and Choral Music\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1795024", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1795024", "title": "Foire Brayonne", "text": "Foire Brayonne\n\nThe Foire Brayonne is a music and cultural festival held each summer in Edmundston, New Brunswick since 1985. The Foire is sometimes considered the biggest French festival held in Canada outside the province of Quebec. It is usually held in August, at several locations in Edmundston.\n\nThe first festival was held in 1979 and up to 1985 was a 10-day event. Today the festival is running strong with five days of activities for all ages. It is held the week before the New Brunswick Civic Holiday, which is the first Monday of August.\n\nThe name \"Foire Brayonne\" stems from the word \"foire\" which is French for fair. \"Brayonne\" is the feminine form of the French word \"Brayon\" which is the name given to residents of Edmundston and the surrounding Madawaska County area. There have been many disputes as to why this term is used.\n\nThe word is defined as someone who mixes (such as pancakes or laundry). However, some historians dispute the term when it comes to the people of Edmundston. They refer to their ancestors' harvesting of reeds from the Saint John River valley. These were known as \"braye\" (which they used to weave baskets and make brooms). Therefore the term \"brayon\" means harvester of braye. Some believe the name may refer to the \"Pays de Bray\" region in Normandy (northwestern France). Having left this region for Quebec, the descendants made their way over generations to the Saint John River valley. The name perhaps provides a link to their native homeland.\n\nMany local dishes are served during the festival such as the ploye, which is a pancake type mix of water and buckwheat flour. There is chicken stew which is chicken mixed with dumplings and potatoes. They enjoy cretons: a pork-based pate.\n\nAlthough not a local dish, there's teriyaki on a stick where a thin piece of meat is dipped into a mix of teriyaki and barbecue sauce, grilled over an open fire. It was introduced in the late 90s and has become a foire favorite.\n\nThe foire relies on sponsorships and grants to offer a low entrance fee. A five-day pass to all shows was available for $35 (in 2014). Compared to similar festivals, the foire is arguably one of the best deals of its kind.\n\nPeople wishing to know more about the area's rich history can visit \"La promenade de la Republique\", which is an exposition on how life in the area was during the Victorian era.\n\nA large park for kids offers live shows, inflatable games, and the opportunity to paint kid's faces and have their picture taken with Typique, a child-friendly porcupine which the region has a rich history of.\n\nOther attractions include an outdoor mass celebrating the French culture's loyalty to the Catholic faith, a large parade, car shows, sporting competitions, and an arts and crafts flea market.\n\nOne of the foire's major attractions has been live concerts. Here is a partial list of artists who have appeared at the foire:\n\n\nOne of the most interesting events at the Foire Brayonne is the Party du Parking. The idea for this party was brought forward by committee member Jo-Anne Volpé, who in 1987, asked city officials about having a large party in the city's parking lot. Despite their reservations, city officials agreed. Today, more than 20 years later, the Party du Parking is one of the most enduring and successful events of the Foire Brayonne. Hundreds of people from all walks of life come to this event simply to experience it, as it has a large word-of-mouth and cult following.\n\nEvery year thousands of people gather on the Friday evening of the Foire in the parking lot in downtown Edmundston. Food, beverages, and live entertainment is offered. Although sometimes imitated by other festivals in the United States and Canada, it is the largest one of its kind in New Brunswick. It has sometimes been compared to Mardi Gras due to its large gathering and party atmosphere. What makes the Party du Parking so special is that, despite having thousands of people gathered into one small spot, the party is in a very controlled environment. Very few, if any, arrests are made and almost everyone attending the Party du Parking are well behaved, despite the amount of alcohol people tend to consume on that night.\n\nThe Foire Bayonne is sometimes criticized by the Acadian people as not promoting the culture as a vital part of French New Brunswick, as most of them feel that the term Brayons is but a legend. Despite this the foire has always included Acadian acts and encourages local Acadian talent. In 2008 the foire's closing festivities added an Acadian touch with 1755 and Le Grand Dérangement. Fayo and George Belliveau are some of the Acadian acts who performed.\n\nThe Edmundston area, despite having a large population of Acadian ancestry, has always been a separate culture from the rest of French New Brunswick. It has become the second largest majority French speaking city outside of Quebec. Most of the francophones there are from Quebec ancestry, compared to the rest of French New Brunswick which are direct descendants of the first French people to colonise North America in 1604 in what is now Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. Quebec was not founded until four years late.\n\nBecause of the high Quebec ancestry in the Edmundston area and its close proximity to the Quebec border, area residents are in some cases considered by Acadians as non-resident Quebecers.\n\nSome \"Brayons\" do not want to be compared to Acadians or Quebecers and ardently call themselves independent \"Brayons\" from \"P'tit Sault\" (the original name for Edmundston), which designates the smaller rapids of the river.\n\n\nThe current director is Cindy Couturier.\n\n"}
{"id": "1795025", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1795025", "title": "Phi Beta Sigma", "text": "Phi Beta Sigma\n\nPhi Beta Sigma Fraternity, Incorporated (ΦΒΣ) is an intercollegiate, international historically African-American Greek letter fraternity. It was founded at Howard University in Washington, D.C. on January 9, 1914, by three young African-American male students with nine other Howard students as charter members. The fraternity's founders, Abram Langston Taylor, Leonard Frances Morse, and Charles Ignatius Brown, wanted to organize a Greek letter fraternity that would exemplify the ideals of \"Brotherhood, Scholarship and Service\" while taking an inclusive perspective to serve the community as opposed to having an exclusive purpose. The fraternity exceeded the prevailing models of Black Greek-Letter fraternal organizations by being the first to establish alumni chapters, to establish youth mentoring clubs, to establish a federal credit union, to establish chapters in Africa, and establish a collegiate chapter outside of the United States, and is the only fraternity to hold a constitutional bond with a predominantly African-American sorority, Zeta Phi Beta (ΖΦΒ), which was founded on January 16, 1920, at Howard University in Washington, D.C., through the efforts of members of Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity.\n\nThe fraternity expanded over a broad geographical area in a short amount of time when its second, third, and fourth chapters were chartered at Wiley College in Texas and Morgan State College in Maryland in 1916, and Kansas State University in 1917. Today, the fraternity serves through a membership of more than 200,000 men in over 700 chapters in the United States, Africa, Europe, Asia, and the Caribbean. Although Phi Beta Sigma is considered a predominantly African-American Fraternity, its membership also consists of diverse college-educated men of African, Caucasian, Hispanic, Native American and Asian descent. According to its Constitution, academically-eligible male students of any race, religion, or national origin may join while enrolled at a college or university through collegiate chapters, or professional men may join through an alumni chapter if a college degree has been attained, along with a certain minimum number of earned credit hours.\n\nPhi Beta Sigma Fraternity, Incorporated is a member of the National Pan-Hellenic Council (NPHC) and the North American Interfraternity Conference (IFC or NIC). The current International President is Michael Cristal, and the fraternity's headquarters are located at 145 Kennedy Street, NW Washington, D.C.\n\nIn the summer of 1910, after a conversation with a recent Howard University graduate in Memphis, Tennessee, A. Langston Taylor formed the idea to establish a fraternity and soon after, enrolled into Howard University in Washington, D.C. Once there, Taylor began to set his vision of a brotherhood into action. In October 1913, Taylor and Leonard F. Morse had their initial conversation about starting a fraternity. As a result, Charles I. Brown was named as the third member of the founding group. By November 1913, a committee was established to begin to lay the foundation of what was to become Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity. Soon after the first committee meeting, Taylor, Morse, and Brown chose nine associates to assist them with the creation of the fraternity. Those men were the first charter members of the organization.\n\nOn January 9, 1914, the permanent organization of Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity was established in the Bowen Room of the 12th Street Y.M.C.A Building in Washington, D.C. On April 15, 1914, the Board of Deans at Howard University officially recognized Phi Beta Sigma and the following week \"The University Reporter\", Howard University's student publication, made known the news.\n\nThe first two years of the fraternity's existence would see them organize and maintain a Sunday school program, led by A.H. Brown, open a library and art gallery to the public, the foundation of the Benjamin Banneker Research Society, and also the Washington Art Club. In addition to their impact to the Washington, D.C. Community, the members of Sigma were also impacting the campus of Howard University. Abraham M. Walker was elected associate editor of the Howard University Journal. The following year, Walker and Founder A. Langston Taylor, were elected Editor-in-Chief and circulation manager respectively. Other members were also taking leadership positions as W.F. Vincent, William H. Foster, John Berry, Earl Lawson, among others, were presidents of the Debating Society, the college YMCA, the Political Science Club, and the Athletic Association respectively. On the athletic field, captain John Camper and J. House Franklin were standout football players for Howard University.\n\nIn the spring of 1915, the fraternity was seeking to further its intellectual pool. As a result, several affluent African-American scholars Dr. Edward P. Davis, Dr. Thomas W. Turner, T.M. Gregory, and Dr. Alain Leroy Locke, were inducted into the Fraternity. On March 5, 1915, Herbert L. Stevens was initiated, in turn making him the first Graduate member of Phi Beta Sigma.\nA year after the establishment of Phi Beta Sigma, the Fraternity saw that the scope of Sigma needed to be expanded beyond just Washington, D.C. and Howard University. On November 13, 1915, Beta chapter was chartered at Wiley College in Marshall, Texas by graduate member Herbert Stevens. Beta chapter became the first chapter of any African-American Greek-lettered organization to be chartered south of Richmond, Virginia. As Phi Beta Sigma continued its expansion in the Eastern and Southern United States, other national fraternities were beginning to take notice.\n\nOn December 28, 1916, Phi Beta Sigma hosted the fraternity's first conclave in Washington, D.C. 200 members representing three collegiate chapters, Alpha, Beta and Gamma (established at Morgan State College) were in attendance. As a result of the 1916 conclave, an official publication for the Fraternity was authorized and member W.F. Vincent was elected as the National Editor.\n\nPhi Beta Sigma responded to a \"call to arms\" in 1917 as the United States entered the First World War. No definite study has ever been made as to the participation of Phi Beta Sigma members in World War I. However, the Alpha chapter had about seventy members in uniform. The troubles of membership affected several chapters beyond the Alpha chapter; other chapters of Sigma were so depleted that only the Alpha chapter showed any signs of activity, and the National Office ceased to function. The General Board was forced to re-organize as a result of death and other dislocations brought on by the war. Fraternity President I. L. Scruggs would ask fraternity founder and then National Treasurer A. Langston Taylor to contact members as soon as they re-appeared in civilian clothes. It was through the efforts of Taylor that the fraternity was able to continue and proceed to operate financially as numerous Sigma men served on the European battle front.\n\nBy February 1920, Phi Beta Sigma had expanded to ten active chapters. During the December 1919 Conclave, Phi Beta Sigma's first conclave after the war, A. Langston Taylor was given approval from the General Board to assist in the organization of what was to become Phi Beta Sigma's sister sorority\n\nIn the spring of 1919, Sigma member Charles Robert Samuel Taylor - then a student at Howard University - shared with fellow student Arizona Cleaver his idea for a sister organization to the fraternity. Cleaver then presented this idea to fourteen other Howard Women; and with the help of Charles Taylor and Sigma Founder A. Langston Taylor, work began to establish the new sorority. With permission from the Howard University administration, Zeta Phi Beta Sorority held its first official meeting on January 16, 1920. The founders and charter members of the Sorority consisted of Arizona Cleaver (Stemons), Viola Tyler (Goings), Myrtle Tyler (Faithful), Pearl Anna Neal, and Fannie Pettie (Watts). The five founders chose the name Zeta Phi Beta. The similar names of both Sigma and Zeta are intentional in nature, as the ladies adopted the Greek letters 'Phi' and 'Beta' to \"seal and signify the relationship between the two organizations\".\n\nThe newly established Zeta Phi Beta Sorority, Inc. was given a formal introduction at the Whitelaw Hotel by their Sigma Counterparts, Charles R. and A. Langston Taylor. The two Sigma Brothers had been a source of advice and encouragement during the establishment, and throughout the early days. of Zeta Phi Beta As National Executive Secretary of Phi Beta Sigma, Charles Taylor wrote to all Sigma chapters requesting they establish Zeta chapters at their respective institutions. With the efforts of Taylor, Zeta added several chapters in areas as far west as Kansas City State College; as far south as Morris Brown College in Atlanta, Georgia; and as far north as New York City.\n\nThe 1920s also witnessed the birth of the Harlem Renaissance - a flowering of African-American cultural and intellectual life that began to be absorbed into mainstream American culture. Phi Beta Sigma fraternity brother Alain LeRoy Locke is unofficially credited as the \"Father of the Harlem Renaissance.\" His philosophy served as a strong motivating force in keeping the energy and passion of the Movement at the forefront. In addition to Locke, Sigma brothers James Weldon Johnson and A. Philip Randolph were participants in this creative emergence, led primarily by the African-American community based in the neighborhood of Harlem in New York City.\n\nOn January 31, 1920, Phi Beta Sigma was incorporated in the district of Washington, D.C. and became known as Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity, Incorporated.\n\nIn November 1921, the first volume of the \"Phi Beta Sigma Journal\" was published. The journal was the official organ of the fraternity; Eugene T. Alexander was named its first editor. The following month, the fraternity held its 1921 Conclave at Morris Brown College in Atlanta, Georgia. This conference saw the first-ever inter-fraternity conference between Phi Beta Sigma and Omega Psi Phi. This would lead to the first inter-fraternity council meeting between the two organizations the following spring in Washington, D.C.\nIn 1922, Founder Taylor called for the assembly of the Black Greek-lettered organizations of Howard University to discuss the formation of a governing council. Although the efforts of Taylor failed on that particular day, they would sow the seeds for what was to become the National Pan-Hellenic Council eight years later.\n\nIn March 1924, the name of the fraternity's official publication, \"The Phi Beta Sigma Journal\", was changed to \"The Crescent Magazine\". The magazine's name change was suggested by members of the Mu chapter at Lincoln University to reference the symbolic meaning of the crescent to the fraternity. At the 1924 conclave, a special exhibit introduced the concept of the \"Bigger and Better Negro Business\". This would lead to the establishment of Bigger and Better Business as a national program at the 1925 conclave. At the 1928 Conclave, held in Louisville, Kentucky, the tradition of branding the skin with a hot iron, as a part of the initiation process was officially sanctioned by the fraternity.\n\nAt the 1929 Conclave held in New York City, Dr. Carter G. Woodson was invited as a guest speaker and saw the creation of the Distinguished Service chapter. The fall of 1929 saw the crash of the nation's stock markets. Like many other organizations during this period, Phi Beta Sigma faced financial difficulties. With brothers faced with financial worries, some members were forced to leave their respective institutions due to lack of funds to continue their educations; several chapters became inactive. The fraternity saw its income drastically shrink to the point of nearly disappearing completely. As a result of the bank closures, the remaining funds of the fraternity were frozen.\n\nAs the nation came to terms with the Great Depression, Phi Beta Sigma and its members continued to implement programs to support the black community. In February 1930, the General Board met in New York City and appointed then vice president of the Eastern Region, Dr. T. H. Wright, as head of the new Bigger and Better Business program. The first objective of Phi Beta Sigma's new program was to call upon colleges to provide business courses for its students. The fraternity went forward with its plans to implement the bigger and better business program and aid as many financially strapped chapters as possible through scholarships for brothers.\n\nLater that year, at the 1930 Conclave held in Tuskegee, Alabama, northern region vice president C. L. Roberts suggested that instead of a yearly meeting, the annual conclaves should be held once every two years. It was also at this conclave that brother George Washington Carver delivered an impassioned and emotional speech to the brothers in attendance.\n\nFraternity brother A. Phillip Randolph, who organized the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, played a role in the amendments to the Railway Labor Act in 1934. As a result, railway porters were granted rights under federal law. This victory and the continuing work of Randolph and the BSCP led to the Pullman Company contract with the union, which included over $2 million in pay increases for employees, a shorter workweek, and overtime pay. 1934 also marked the birth of Social Action as a national program and the return of founder A. Langston Taylor to the forefront of Sigma. Brother Emmett May was elected as the first director of the social action initiative.\n\nThe 1935 Atlanta Conclave saw yet another meeting between Sigma and Omega Psi Phi fraternities. Omega founders Edgar Amos Love and Oscar James Cooper brought greetings to the brothers in attendance of the conference on behalf of the members of Omega Psi Phi. The following year, the general board approved the fraternity's affiliation with the already established National Pan-Hellenic Council. in continuation of Sigma's Social Action initiative, brothers of Sigma were actively involved the Chicago meeting of the National Negro Congress.\n\nAs Phi Beta Sigma prepared for the Silver (25th) Anniversary, a special search was made for lost founder Charles I. Brown. The search would yield no results as to the fate or location of Founder Brown. The 1939 conclave marking the 25th anniversary of the fraternity was held on the campus of Howard University.\n\nAt the 1941 Conclave in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the fraternity became a permanent member of the National Negro Business League. At the same conclave Brother A. Phillip Randolph announced a proposed march on Washington, D.C., to protest racial discrimination in defense work and the armed forces. This proposed march would lead then president of the United States Franklin D. Roosevelt to create the Committee on Fair Employment Practice and issue Executive Order 8802 which barred discrimination in governmental and defense industry hiring.\n\nDue to the outbreak of the Second World War no Conclaves were held, although some brothers in various regions were able to assemble independently of the General Board.\nAt the fraternity's first spring conclave in 1944, the fraternity voted to support the United Negro College Fund. 1949 would mark the reunion of two of the founders of Sigma: A. Langston Taylor and Leonard F. Morse.\n\nThe 1940s and 1950s would show the continued expansion of Phi Beta Sigma. In 1949, the fraternity became an international organization with the chartering of the Beta Upsilon Sigma graduate chapter and the Gamma Nu Sigma graduate chapter in Monrovia, Liberia. The fraternity would extend its international chapters into Geneva, Switzerland, with the chartering of the Gamma Nu Sigma graduate chapter in 1955.\n\nAs the struggle for the civil rights of African Americans renewed in the 1950s, Sigma men held positions of leadership among various civil rights groups, organized protests, and proposed the March on Washington of 1963. In Atlanta, A. Phillip Randolph helped with the establishment of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) in 1957. Randolph and fraternity brother John Lewis would later be involved with the 1963 March on Washington, Randolph as a key organizer and Lewis as a speaker representing the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC).\n\nIn 1961, Phi Beta Sigma brother James Forman joined and became the executive secretary of the then newly formed Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. From 1961 to 1965 Forman, a decade older and more experienced than most of the other members of SNCC, became responsible for providing organizational support to the young, loosely affiliated activists by paying bills, radically expanding the institutional staff, and planning the logistics for programs. Under the leadership of Forman and others, SNCC became an important political player at the height of the Civil Rights Movement.\n\nDuring the Selma to Montgomery marches, Brothers Hosea Williams and John Lewis (U.S. politician) led a 54-mile protest march from Selma to the capital of Alabama: Montgomery. Lewis became known nationally for his prominent role in the marches and became a Congressman as a Democrat from Georgia. During police attacks on the peaceful demonstration Lewis was beaten mercilessly, leaving head wounds that are still visible today.\n\nPhi Beta Sigma brothers Huey P. Newton & Bobby Seale established the revolutionary left-wing Black Panther Party. Originally the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense, their goal was the protection of African-American neighborhoods from police brutality in the interest of African-American justice. As one of the many advocates of The Black Power Movement, the Black Panthers were considered part of one of the most significant social, political, and cultural movements in U.S. history. \"The Movement['s] provocative rhetoric, militant posture, and cultural and political flourishes permanently altered the contours of American Identity.\"\n\nIn 1970, brother Melvin Evans was elected the first governor of the United States Virgin Islands. In 1979, Phi Beta Sigma celebrated its 65th anniversary Conclave in Washington, D.C. In 1983, Sigma brother Harold Washington became the first African-American mayor of the city of Chicago, Illinois. In 1986, the Fraternity opened the Phi Beta Sigma Federal Credit Union which is open to members of the Fraternity, members of the sister sorority, Zeta Phi Beta, their families, and their respective Regions and chapters. With the establishment of the credit union, Phi Beta Sigma became the first NPHC organization to offer such an entity to its members.\n\nIn 1989, the Fraternity celebrated its Diamond Jubilee in Washington, D.C. Also in that year, brother Edison O. Jackson became the president of Medgar Evers College in Brooklyn, New York. In 1990, two Sigma brothers made significant firsts in their respective fields as Brothers Charles E. Freeman and Morris Overstreet were elected the first district judge of the Illinois Supreme Court and first African-American elected by popular vote to a statewide office in the state of Texas respectively. In 1995, the fraternity was the only NPHC organization involved with the planning and support of the Million Man March as brother Benjamin Chavis Muhammad served as national coordinator of the March.\n\nIn 2001, Sigma brother Rod Paige became the first African-American Secretary of Education. At the 2003 conclave, in Memphis, Tennessee, the fraternity added Projects S.W.W.A.C & S.A.T.A.P as national programs in attempts to combat cancer and teenage pregnancy. In addition to those projects, the fraternity added Project Vote and the Phi Beta Sigma Capital Hill Summit under the social action umbrella. At the 2007 conclave in Charlotte, North Carolina the fraternity introduced the Sigma Wellness initiatives as the latest national programs.\nThe 2009 Conclave in New Orleans saw former President William Jefferson Clinton accept honorary member invitation to Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity.\"\n\nThe Fraternity noticed abuse of its trademark by the clothing designer Ralph Lauren in early January 2020. That designer incorporated the Fraternity's name along with other symbolism on the fabric of pants offered for sale on its website. The Fraternity objected and explained in a cease-and-desist letter that such usage was in violation of trademark and was not developed as Fraternity-approved sportswear. \"Black Enterprise magazine\" profiled this controversy in a January 2020 article.\n\nThe founders deeply wished to create an organization that viewed itself as \"a part of\" the general community rather than \"apart from\" the general community. They believed that each potential member should be judged by his own merits rather than his family background or affluence... without regard of skin tone or texture of hair. They wished and wanted their fraternity to exist as part of even a greater brotherhood which would be devoted to the \"inclusive we\" rather than the \"exclusive we.\" The fraternity's defiance of stereotypes that have plagued other organizations indeed goes back to the founders themselves with their careful and deliberate building of the fraternity by promoting a membership with diverse backgrounds.\n\nFrom its inception, the Founders also conceived Phi Beta Sigma as a mechanism to deliver services to the general community. Rather than gaining skills to be utilized exclusively for themselves and their immediate families, the founders of Phi Beta Sigma held a deep conviction that they should return their newly acquired skills to the communities from which they had come. This deep conviction was mirrored in the Fraternity's motto, \"Culture For Service and Service For Humanity.\"\n\nToday, Phi Beta Sigma has blossomed into an international organization of leaders. The fraternity has experienced unprecedented growth and continues to be a leader among issues of social justice as well as proponent of the interests of minority communities, the needy, the oppressed, and the youth. No longer a single entity, the Fraternity has now established the Phi Beta Sigma Educational Foundation, the Phi Beta Sigma Housing Foundation, the Phi Beta Sigma Federal Credit Union, a notable youth auxiliary program, \"The Sigma Beta Club,\" and the Phi Beta Sigma Charitable Outreach Foundation.\n\nPhi Beta Sigma's Constitution states that race, religion, and national origin are not criteria for membership. Membership is predominantly African-American in composition, with members in over 650 collegiate and alumni chapters in the United States, District of Columbia, Germany, Switzerland, The Bahamas, Virgin Islands, South Korea, Japan and countries in Africa. Since its founding in 1914, more than 185,000 men have joined the membership of Phi Beta Sigma.\nA chapter name ending in \"Sigma\" denotes a graduate chapter. No chapter of Phi Beta Sigma is designated Omega, the last letter of the Greek alphabet, and deceased brothers are referred to as having joined The Omega chapter.\n\nThrough the years, members of Phi Beta Sigma have been involved in incidents related to hazing, although now denounced by the fraternity, incidents have been discovered of pledges being subjected to activities which in some case have resulted in serious injury and even death. Prior to 1990, the Crescent Club was the official pledge club of Phi Beta Sigma and potential candidates interested in becoming a member of the fraternity would join the pledge club before being fully initiated. In response to the increasing number of lawsuits stemming from allegations and incidents related to hazing, Phi Beta Sigma and other members of the National Pan-Hellenic Council jointly agreed to disband pledging as a form of admission. In an attempt to eliminate Hazing from these organizations, each revised its orientation procedures and developed the Membership Intake Process.\n\nIn 2012, then Phi Beta Sigma International President Jimmy Hammock, along with the National Action Network, led by Sigma member Al Sharpton, launched a coalition whose aim was to combat hazing culture not just within the black Greek Lettered Organizations, but also the broader community at large. The coalition, also pledged their support of federal anti-hazing legislation that was being spearheaded by United States House of Representatives member Frederica Wilson. As part of the campaign, the fraternity developed anti-hazing training materials, held a town hall meetings, facilitated workshops and encouraged local chapters to participate in the annual National Anti-Hazing Awareness Day. Phi Beta Sigma's efforts to eliminate hazing from the fraternity continue as local chapters are now mandated to participate in anti-hazing awareness workshops.\n\nIn 1992, a pledge at Southern University (Baton Rouge) went blind after being intentionally hit on the head with a frying pan by a member of the fraternity.\n\nIn 1996, the fraternity was sued by a former pledge and football player at the University of Georgia for violating hazing laws. As a pledge, he was hospitalized with bruises to his buttock and torn blood vessels due to being paddled by fraternity members. Three members were arrested and pled guilty to hazing and battery charges.\n\nIn 1998, a pledge at Southern Illinois University was struck in the chest by several members of the fraternity which caused him to suffer from a severe asthma attack.\n\nIn 2006, seven Sigmas were arrested for beating pledges from the University of South Carolina. One known pledge was hospitalized due to the severe beatings and torment.\n\nIn 2009, Donnie Wade Jr., a student at Prairie View A&M University, died of extreme exhaustion due to illegal hazing activity while he was pledging the fraternity. His family filed a $97 million lawsuit against the fraternity and the chapter was temporarily expelled from campus for several years.\n\nIn 2012, seven members (six students and one staff member) of the fraternity were banned from the campus of Wiley College after reports surfaced of the brutal and dangerous hazing practices pledges had to go through.\n\nIn 2014, a former Francis Marion University student won a $1.6 million lawsuit against the fraternity after suffering acute kidney injury due to being severely beaten throughout his pledge process. Nine Phi Beta Sigma members were arrested.\n\nIn 2015, the fraternity was kicked off the campus of Salisbury University until Spring 2017. The university had received several anonymous complaints of pledges being beaten with paddles, forced to drink alcohol, and being harassed.\n\nPhi Beta Sigma Fraternity's membership includes many notable members who are involved in the fields of arts and entertainment, business, civil rights, education, health, law, politics, science, and sports. The fraternity's membership roster includes heads of state Benjamin Nnamdi Azikiwe, Kwame Nkrumah, William Tolbert, and William V.S. Tubman, the past presidents of Nigeria, the Republic of Ghana, and Liberia respectively. Other notable members include scientist George Washington Carver, the first black Rhodes Scholar Alain LeRoy Locke, Black Panther Party founder Huey P. Newton, organizer of the Million Man March Benjamin Chavis Muhammad, civil rights activists Hosea Williams and the Rev. Al Sharpton, musicians The Original Temptations, actor Terrence Howard, television personality Al Roker, professional athletes Myron M Guyton, Jessie Small, (Aaron Jones], Jerry Rice, Emmitt Smith, Hines Ward, Richard Sherman and Ryan Howard, the Philadelphia Phillies first baseman and award-winning actor Blair Underwood.\n\nListed below are the thirty-five International Presidents since the 1914 institution of the office\n\nThe Conclave is the legislative power of Phi Beta Sigma. During a conclave year, delegates representing all of the active chapters from within the seven regions of the Fraternity meet in the chosen city. The Conclave-or fraternity convention- is currently held biannually and usually co-hosted by the alumni and collegiate chapters of the chosen city. During the convention, members of the General Board – the administrative body of the fraternity-are elected and appointed. The General Board may act in the interest of the Fraternity when the Conclave is not in session. In addition, seminars, social events, concerts, an international Miss Phi Beta Sigma Pageant, Stepshow, and oratorical contests are also held during the week-long conference. Throughout the years, notable individuals such as George Washington Carver, Dr. Carter G. Woodson, and NFL quarterback Charlie Batch were speakers at past Conclaves.\n\nThe Current General board is composed of The International President, First Vice-President, Second-Vice President, Treasurer, General Counsel, a Distinguished Service Chapter Representative, the regional directors, the immediate past-president, two collegiate members at large, and director of collegiate affairs. The offices of Second-Vice President and collegiate member at large are reserved positions on the general board for collegiate (undergraduate) members to hold. In addition, the Editor of The Crescent Magazine, Director of publicity, and the National Executive Director make up the members of the General Board. The latter-mentioned members are appointed to their positions and do not hold voting powers.\n\nEstablished at the 1929 Conclave, the Distinguished Service Chapter is the highest honor bestowed on a member of Phi Beta Sigma. Membership in the Distinguished Service Chapter must be recommended and approved by the awardees Chapter, Region, and by the General Board of the Fraternity prior to entry. One must meet the following criteria in order to be considered for this honor:\n\n\nBrother Jesse W. Lewis holds the distinction of being voted in as the DSC's 1st member (1929).\n\nPhi Beta Sigma Fraternity organizes its chapters according to their regions in the United States and abroad. The seven regions are each led by a regional director and a regional board. A comprehensive list of regions is shown below:\n\nPhi Beta Sigma aims their focuses on issues that greatly impact the African-American community and the youth of the nation. The Phi Beta Sigma national programs of Bigger and Better Business, Education and Social Action are realized through the Fraternity's overarching program, Sigma Wellness, adopted in 2007. Through its national mentoring program for males ages 8–18, the organization provides opportunities for the development of young men as they prepare for college and the workforce.\n\nThe organization's partnerships with the American Cancer Society, March of Dimes, Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Boy Scouts of America and the Thurgood Marshall College Fund speaks to its mission to address societal ills including health disparities and educational and developmental opportunities for young males.\n\nAs told by Dr. I. L. Scruggs (excerpts from \"Our Cause Speeds On\"):\n\nThe Bigger and Better Business serves as an umbrella for other national initiatives involving business. The program's goals include supporting minority businesses, increasing communication with sigma brothers involved with business, and instilling sound business principals and practices to members of the community. Project S.E.E.D. (Sigma Economic Empowerment Development) is the foremost Bigger and Better Business Program. The program was developed to help the membership focus on two important areas: Financial Management and Home ownership.\n\nThe founders of Phi Beta Sigma were all educators in their own right. The genesis of the Education Program lies in the traditional emphasis that the fraternity places on Education. During the 1945 conclave in St. Louis, Missouri, the fraternity underwent a constitution restructuring which led to the birth of the Education as a National Program.\n\nThe National Program of Education focuses on programming and services to graduate and undergraduates in the fraternity. Programs such as scholarships, lectures, college fairs, mentoring, and tutoring enhance this program on local, regional and national levels.\n\nProject S.E.T. (Sigma Education Time) is focused on increasing grade point averages and graduation rates of collegiates throughout the nation. The program aims to help with job readiness, choosing a career path {3–5 year outlook}, interviewing techniques, negotiating and entrepreneurship.\n\nThe Sigma Beta Club provides mentoring, guidance, educational tutorial assistance and advise to young men between ages 6 to 18. Created in 1950, it was the first youth auxiliary group of any of the National Pan-Hellenic Council organizations.\n\nPhi Beta Sigma has from its very beginning concerned itself with improving the general well-being of minority groups. In 1934, a well-defined program of Social Action was formulated and put into action. Elmo M. Anderson, then president of Epsilon Sigma chapter (New York) formulated this program calling for the reconstruction of social order. It was a tremendous success. It fit in with the social thinking of the American public in those New Deal years.\n\nIn the winter of 1934, Sigma brothers Elmo Anderson, James W. Johnson, Emmett May and Bob Jiggets presented the Social Action proposition to the Conclave in Washington, D.C. The idea was adopted as a national program at the same conclave. Anderson is credited as \"The Father of Social Action\".\n\nThe fraternity's five main social action programs are Project Vote, Sigma Wellness, Sigma Presence on Capitol Hill, and projects S.W.W.A.C. and S.A.T.A.P.P.\n\n\"Project S.W.W.A.C.\" (Sigmas Waging War Against Cancer) is a concentrated and coordinated effort to reduce the incidence of cancer in the African-American community. Through a partnership with the American Cancer Society, the goal of Project S.W.W.A.C. is to increase awareness, with a strong emphasis on early detection and prevention of prostate and colorectal cancer. \"Project S.A.T.A.P.P.\" is a collaborative venture with the March of Dimes Birth Defects Foundation to address the alarming rise in teenage pregnancy. The \"Sigma Wellness Project\" is focused on living healthier lifestyles through education. The goal of \"Project Vote\" is to register and educate citizens and encourage members of the community to participate in the democratic process. The \"Sigma Presence on Capitol Hill Program\" is focused on presenting Sigma members the opportunity to discuss many of the critical issues facing our communities with members of the U.S. Congress.\n\nIn the early 1950s, Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity developed a youth auxiliary group. Under the direction of Dr. Parlett L. Moore the Sigma Beta Club was founded. While as National Director of Education, Brother Moore was concerned about our changing needs in our communities and recognized the important role that Sigma men could play in the lives of our youth. On April 23, 1954, the first club chapter was organized in Montgomery, AL. Throughout its existence, Sigma Beta Club has been an essential part of the total organizational structure of many of the Alumni chapters of Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity, Inc. and offers men of Sigma a unique opportunity to develop wholesome value, leadership skills, and social and cultural awareness of youth at a most critical stage in the youth's personal development. The Sigma Beta Clubs' principles of focus emphasize Culture, Athletics, Social and Educational needs. Sigma Beta Club programs are geared to meet the needs of its members, but at the same time provide them with a well-rounded outlook that is needed to cope with today's society. Phi Beta Sigma is confident that investing in our youth today will produce effective leaders of tomorrow. Sigma Beta Clubs also provide services to youths in their communities. Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity, Inc.'s interest in fostering the development of youth into effective leaders has been realized in the establishment of strong and productive Sigma Beta Club all across the country.\n\nThe Sigma History Museum was a traveling exhibition created in 2001 by Sigma brothers Mark Pacich, Louis W. Lubin, Jr. and Ahab El’Askeni. The museum's initial goal was to dispel the discrepancies of the Fraternity's history, by collecting as many newspaper articles, Crescent Magazines, Conclave Journals, autographs, pictures, etc., as possible. With the help of many Sigma members, in addition to families and friends of Sigmas brothers, some impressive artifacts of the history of the Fraternity were discovered. Among those artifacts, pictures of Sigma Founder A. Langston Taylor; historical pictures from the 1914, 1915, and 1916 yearbooks at Howard University; original letters; Conclave banners; and interviews with Sigma Brother Decatur Morse, son of Sigma Founder Leonard F. Morse, Samuel Proctor Massie II, son of an Alpha chapter charter member, Samuel P. Massie, Robert L. Pollard II, son of Sigma brother Col. Robert L. Pollard who joined Sigma in 1919, and Dr. Gregory Tignor, son of Sigma brother Madison Tignor who also joined Sigma in 1919. The exhibit has been displayed in many cities including; Orlando, Philadelphia, Detroit, Memphis, and Las Vegas.\n\nOn July 16, 2014, as part of the fraternity's centennial celebration, a permanent museum was opened at the Phi Beta Sigma International Headquarters in Washington D.C. As a result, Phi Beta Sigma became the first Historically Black Greek Lettered fraternity to open its own museum.\n\nThe assets of the museum have grown since the initial display in 2000. The most coveted possession yet to be acquired are the first 2 issues of the \"Phi Beta Sigma Journal\". The museum is only 14 issues away from having every Crescent magazine ever printed.\n\n\n"}

It can be described as a variation (which may arise due to mutation or alteration in the genomic loci) that can be observed. A genetic marker may be a short DNA sequence, such as a sequence surrounding a single base-pair change (single nucleotide polymorphism, SNP), or a long one, like minisatellites.\n\nFor many years, gene mapping was limited to identifying organisms by traditional phenotype markers. This included genes that encoded easily observable characteristics such as blood types or seed shapes. The insufficient number of these types of characteristics in several organisms limited the mapping efforts that could be done. This prompted the development of gene markers which could identify genetic characteristics that are not readily observable in organisms (such as protein variation).\n\nSome commonly used types of genetic markers are:\n\nMolecular genetic markers can be divided into two classes a) biochemical markers which detect variation at the gene product level such as changes in proteins and amino acids and b) molecular markers which detect variation at the DNA level such as nucleotide changes: deletion, duplication, inversion and/or insertion. Markers can exhibit two modes of inheritance, i.e. dominant/recessive or co-dominant. If the genetic pattern of homo-zygotes can be distinguished from that of hetero-zygotes, then a marker is said to be co-dominant. Generally co-dominant markers are more informative than the dominant markers.\n\nGenetic markers can be used to study the relationship between an inherited disease and its genetic cause (for example, a particular mutation of a gene that results in a defective protein). It is known that pieces of DNA that lie near each other on a chromosome tend to be inherited together. This property enables the use of a marker, which can then be used to determine the precise inheritance pattern of the gene that has not yet been exactly localized.\nGenetic markers are employed in genealogical DNA testing for genetic genealogy to determine genetic distance between individuals or populations. Uniparental markers (on mitochondrial or Y chromosomal DNA) are studied for assessing maternal or paternal lineages. Autosomal markers are used for all ancestry.\n\nGenetic markers have to be easily identifiable, associated with a specific locus, and highly polymorphic, because homozygotes do not provide any information. Detection of the marker can be direct by RNA sequencing, or indirect using allozymes.\n\nSome of the methods used to study the genome or phylogenetics are RFLP, AFLP, RAPD, SSR. They can be used to create genetic maps of whatever organism is being studied.\n\nThere was a debate over what the transmissible agent of CTVT (canine transmissible venereal tumor) was. Many researchers hypothesized that virus like particles were responsible for transforming the cell, while others thought that the cell itself was able to infect other canines as an allograft. With the aid of genetic markers, researchers were able to provide conclusive evidence that the cancerous tumor cell evolved into a transmissible parasite. Furthermore, molecular genetic markers were used to resolve the issue of natural transmission, the breed of origin (phylogenetics), and the age of the canine tumor.\n\nGenetic markers have also been used to measure the genomic response to selection in livestock. Natural and artificial selection leads to a change in the genetic makeup of the cell. The presence of different alleles due to a distorted segregation at the genetic markers is indicative of the difference between selected and non-selected livestock.\n\n\n"}

They are sometimes referred to as quadrupedian, or four-footed signs because they represent animals that walk on all four legs. These animals are inarticulate, which means they have voices, but their power of speech is not developed. Individuals who are strongly influenced by the bestial signs quite often have speech impediments and a larger than usual amount of body hair.\n\nThe bestial signs in the zodiac are Aries, Taurus, Leo and Capricorn. Because they are not able to express themselves in the manner that they would like, they often become frustrated at their inability to fully communicate. Individuals strongly affected by these signs quite often have difficulty reading and writing as well as speaking, and therefore need extra tuition to help them to overcome those hurdles.\n"}

{"id": "1795037", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1795037", "title": "Educational entrance examination", "text": "Educational entrance examination\n\nAn entrance examination is an examination that educational institutions conduct to select prospective students for admission. It may be held at any stage of education, from primary to tertiary, even though it is typically held at tertiary stage.\n\nFrance is the country that surely uses the most competitive examinations. Some education professionals tend to say that the \"Concours Général\" (not mandatory, as the Baccalauréat is) in the last year of High School (Lycée) is the most difficult to take worldwide with only 250 places in all subjects for 15,000 applicants (there is a failure rate of 98,3%). There are also an entrance competitive examination in order to enter medicine studies: (1 preparation year, 10 mandatory years after competitive exam, failure rate of 85%); \"grandes écoles\" of engineering (2 preparation years, 4 mandatory years after competitive exam, failure rate of approx. 50%), and \"grandes écoles\" of business (2 preparation years, 3 mandatory years after competitive exam, failure rate of approx. 25%). In France, the fact of having succeeded in one competitive exam is highly recognized by the society, and shows you are part of the national elite.\n\nIn India, entrance examinations are chiefly confined to medicine, engineering, and management. These range from the BITS Pilani admission test and IIT-JEE where only one in a hundreds can hope to get admission to state level entrances which are many and varied. The stiff competition has led to a situation where many students neglect their school studies and focus solely on 'entrance coaching' which is time-consuming and expensive. This has led many states to scrap the entrances and base admissions on the school leaving marks which, unfortunately are none too reliable. Experts point out that in a country where many different boards are present common entrances are essential, but application skills rather than cramming should be stressed on. Frequent changes in the pattern of examination are essential since sticking to a 'standard text' or 'standard pattern' alone will favour the coaching industry and the rote-learners.\n\nEntrance Examinations in India trace their roots to the University of Calcutta, which when established in 1857, introduced the practice to decide eligibility for admission. In that exam, one student was passed in every four candidates. From Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka only 219 students were qualified. Only 162 were passed from the Bangladesh, Pakistan, Assam, Tripura, Meghalaya, Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha, Uttar Pradesh, Madhaya Pradesh. In the absence of a standardized school graduation examination, the University's entrance examinations were used as a substitute, known later as Matriculation examinations. Post-independence India has different systems of education whose syllabus and examination process are governed by both central and state-based statutory boards. Grades 10 and 12 which mark the culmination of secondary and higher secondary education, have standardized final examinations, referred to as the Secondary School Leaving Certificate (SSLC) examination after grade 10 (class X) and the Higher Secondary Examination(HSC) after grade 12.\n\nOne-half of British universities have lost confidence in the grades that are awarded by secondary schools, and require many applicants to sit for a competitive entrance examination or other aptitude test. According to the Schools Minister, “strong evidence has been emerging of grade inflation across subjects” in recent years.\n\nDue to coronavirus presence in many countries which embraced school closures either on state or national scale, some entrance examinations for high schools were eventually cancelled to reduce the stress of students and the possibility of coronavirus infection impact during the attendance.\n\n"}
{"id": "1795039", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1795039", "title": "Use-centered design", "text": "Use-centered design\n\nUse-centered design is a design philosophy in which the focus is on the goals and tasks associated with skill performance in specific work or problem domains, in contrast to \"user-centered design\" approach, where the focus is on the needs, wants, and limitations of the end user of the designed artifact.\n\nBennett and Flach (2011) have drawn a contrast between dyadic and triadic approaches to the semiotics of display design. The classical 'user-centered' approach is based on a dyadic semiotic model where the focus is on the human-interface dyad. This approach frames 'meaning' as a process of interpreting the symbolic representation. That is, meaning is constructed from internal information processes. From this dyadic perspective, the design goal is to build interfaces that 'match' the users internal model (i.e., match user expectations).\n\nIn contrast, the 'use-centered' approach is based on a triadic semiotic model that includes the work domain (or ecology) as a third component of the semiotic system. In the triadic system, the work domain provides a ground for meaning outside of the human information processing system. In this, triadic semiotic system, the focus is on the match between the constraints in the work domain and the mental representations. From this 'use-centered' approach the goal is to design displays that 'shape' the internal mental representations so that they reflect validated models of the work domain. In other words, the goal is to shape user expectations to conform with the validated 'deep structure' of the work domain. In doing this, work analysis (e.g., Vicente, 1999) and multi-level means ends representations of work domain constraints (i.e., Rasmussen's Abstraction Hierarchy) are the typical methods used to specify the 'deep structure' of a work domain. By building configural display representations that conform to this deep structure -- it is possible to facilitate skilled interactions between the human and the work domain.\n\nThus, an emphasis on 'use' rather than 'user' suggests a more problem-centered focus for interface design. Note that it remains important to respect the real limitations of human information processing systems through the use of graphical displays that support efficient chunking of information. However, the main point is that the organization MUST be consistent with the demands of the work or problem domain, if the interactions that result are expected to be skillful. In the end, the representations must be 'grounded' in the use-domain!\n\nC.S. Peirce is the inspiration for the triadic model of semiotics. Peirce was interested in the fixation of belief relative to pragmatic demands of everyday experiences. Peirce also introduced the construct of 'abduction' as an alternative to classical logic (deduction and induction). The 'use-centered' approach assumes abduction as the appropriate model for problem solving. Thus, use-centered design focuses on supporting the closed-loop dynamic of learning from experience. That is, by acting on hypotheses and simultaneously testing those hypotheses in terms of the practical consequences of the actions that they guide. The convergence, stability, and robustness of abduction processes depend critically on the information coupling between perception and action. When the coupling is rich an abduction system will typically converge on 'beliefs' that lead to pragmatically successful (i.e., satisfying) interactions (i.e., skilled interactions). This is the ultimate goal of use-centered design - to support skilled interactions between a person and a work domain.\n\nUse-centered design was first coined by John Flach and Cynthia Dominguez (Flach, J. M. & Dominguez, C. O. (1995). Use-centered design: Integrating the user, instrument, and goal. Ergonomics in Design, 3, 3, 19–24.)\nBennett, K.B. and Flach, J.M. (2011) Display and Interface Design.

To embody all perfections, therefore, God must embody the good in \"both\" characteristics, and cannot be limited to one, because a God limited to one would suffer the limits of the one, and lack the good in the other.\n\nFor instance, there is a \"good\" in being just, and also a good in being merciful. In being just, God determines that the good are rewarded and the evil are punished. In being merciful, God forgives those who sin. It follows, therefore, that a God that was \"only\" just or \"only\" merciful would be less than perfect. Dipolar theism holds that a perfect God must embody the good in \"both\" of those characteristics. Thus, a perfect God has the \"good\" characteristics of justice \"and\" the good characteristics of mercy.\n\nAlternatively, there is good in having absolute power, and good in leading by persuasion. For a God to be perfect, he cannot rule solely by predestination, because then he would lack the good possessed by a God who led by persuasion. God must therefore embody the \"good\" in both power and persuasion. From this conclusion, some reject the existence of an omnipotent God.\n\nThose rejecting dipolar theism argue that it fails to distinguish between what we \"think\" God is and what God \"actually\" is. Just because we think God should be a certain way to embody our idea of perfection does not mean God embodies those characteristics in reality. \n\nThis critique is analogous to the critique of Anselm's ontological argument by Gaunilo: \"Just because I can imagine a perfect island does not mean that it actually exists. Things are what they are no matter what I think they should be.\"\n"}

He received his secondary education at Linköping gymnasium and matriculated at Uppsala University in 1763. In Uppsala he became student of the philologist Johan Ihre and the Latinist Petrus Ekerman (who was also inspector of the Ostrogothian Nation).\n\nHe worked as a tutor for a noble family in Livonia 1764-1766, came back to Uppsala where he completed his magister degree in 1770. After having worked as a docent and a librarian at the university library, he became an extraordinary professor in 1779 and was appointed to the Skyttean professorship of Eloquence and Political Science in 1781, after the death of his teacher Johan Ihre. Axelsson Lindblom published a History of Roman Literature (\"Illustriores linguæ Romanæ critici\") and collaborated with Ihre on a \"Lexicon Latino-Svecanum\", which he was eventually to complete in 1790. He published prolifically historical, literary and other topics, but is not regarded as particularly original in his scholarly production.\n\nAxelsson Lindblom was a favorite of Gustavus III, who made him bishop of Linköping in December 1786, in spite of the fact that he wasn't even ordained, a situation remedied a few days after the appointment. As bishop he succeeded Uno von Troil, who had been made archbishop, and in 1805 he succeeded von Troil as archbishop of Uppsala as well, an appointment which also made him Pro-Chancellor of the University.\n\nHe was elected a member of the Swedish Academy in 1809, and was awarded a knighthood in the Order of Seraphim in 1818. His children were raised to the nobility with a change of name to \"Lindersköld\".\n\n"}

He was one of the early guardians of Duke William II in his minority. Had Lord Brionne not been murdered, the senior house of de Clare would probably have been titled de Brionne. Lord Brionne was the first to be known by the cognomen Crispin because of his hair style which stood up like the branches of a pine tree.\n\nGilbert de Brionne was son of Geoffrey, Count of Eu, who was an illegitimate child of Richard I of Normandy. He inherited Brionne, becoming one of the most powerful landowners in Normandy. Gilbert was a generous benefactor to Bec Abbey founded by his former knight Herluin in 1031. When Robert I died in 1035, his illegitimate son William inherited his father's title and several powerful nobles, including Gilbert of Brionne, Osbern the Seneschal and Alan of Brittany, became William's guardians.\n\nA number of Norman barons, including Ralph de Gacé, refused to accept William as their leader. In 1040 an attempt was made to kill William but the plot failed. Gilbert however was murdered while he was peaceably riding near Eschafour. It is believed two of his killers were Ralph of Wacy and Robert de Vitot. This appears to have been an act of vengeance for the wrongs inflicted upon the orphan children of Giroie by Gilbert, and it is not clear what Ralph de Gacé had to do in the business. Fearing they might meet their father's fate, Gilbert's sons Richard and Baldwin were conveyed by their friends to the court of Baldwin V, Count of Flanders. His children would accompany Duke William on his conquest of England and his descendants would become one of the most powerful noble families in the British isles. They would rule over vast lands in modern-day Ireland, Scotland, and England and become powerful Marcher Lords.\n\nThrough his eldest son, Gilbert was ancestor of the English house of de Clare, of the Barons FitzWalter, and the Earls of Gloucester (see Earl of Gloucester) and Hertford (see Earl of Hertford). After Gilbert's death, his uncle William I became Count of Eu whereas Brionne reverted to the duke.\n"}
{"id": "1795085", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1795085", "title": "Mark Robins", "text": "Mark Robins\n\nMark Gordon Robins (born 22 December 1969) is an English football manager and former player. He is the manager of League One club Coventry City.\n\nAs a player, he was a striker from 1986 to 2005. After starting his career with Manchester United, he went on to play in the Premier League for Norwich City and Leicester City before playing in the Football League with Reading, Manchester City, Walsall, Rotherham United, Bristol City, Sheffield Wednesday and in Europe with FC Copenhagen, Ourense and Panionios. He finished his career in the Conference National with Burton Albion and was capped six times for the England under-21 side. In 2007, he became manager of Rotherham United, and joined Barnsley in the same capacity in 2009, before leaving in 2011, following differences between him and the board.\n\nRobins played a very important part in winning the FA Cup for Manchester United in 1990, which was the first trophy of manager Alex Ferguson's reign at the club, scoring the winning goal in the semi-final replay against Oldham Athletic. United were playing away from home against Nottingham Forest (one of the most successful cup teams of the late 1980s and early 1990s) on 7 January 1990, in a third round FA Cup tie. It was widely speculated in the media (but perennially denied by then-Chairman Martin Edwards) that under-pressure United manager Alex Ferguson would have been sacked had United lost and gone out of the Cup, as they were 15th in the league by this stage and had already been eliminated from the League Cup. Instead, Robins came off the bench late into the game and scored the winning goal from a Mark Hughes cross. That goal was a turning point in the history of the football club — Ferguson would keep his job and go on to achieve an unmatched run of success at the club over the next 23 years.\n\nIn that season, Robins scored seven First Division goals and a further two in the FA Cup, bringing his tally that season to nine in all competitions. His goal in the FA Cup third round also had the distinction of making him the player to score the first goal of the 1990s for Manchester United. He also scored one of United's two goals in the semi-final replay where they beat Oldham Athletic.\n\nHe was second only to Mark Hughes in the goalscoring charts at Old Trafford, while Hughes's regular strike-partner Brian McClair had managed a mere five goals and it was starting to look as though Robins would displace McClair as the club's regular second striker. However, McClair recovered his goalscoring form in 1990–91, and Robins managed only 19 First Division appearances and four goals. He was, however, in the squad that won the European Cup Winners' Cup that season. September was a good month for him, as he scored twice in a 3–2 home win over QPR in the league and the winning goal in a visit to Luton Town.\n\nHowever, the 1991–92 season was a frustrating one for Robins as he played just twice in the league, failing to score, and in total made just eight appearances in all competitions. His only goals that season came in the League Cup second round at home to Portsmouth, when he scored twice in a 3–2 win at Old Trafford. When the opportunity for a place back in the first team arose in April as United were being overhauled by Leeds United in the title race, Robins was injured and unavailable for selection.\n\nTwo wry forms of consolation for Robins in a frustrating season came during the first half of the campaign. On 30 October 1991, he scored twice in their 3–1 win over Portsmouth in the League Cup third round, putting them on course for a strong run in the competition which culminated in them winning it for the very first time. On 19 November 1991, he collected a European Super Cup winner's medal (as a non playing substitute) as United beat Red Star Belgrade in the game at Old Trafford.\n\nAt the end of the season, he asked to be transfer listed.\n\nHe left Manchester United for Norwich City for a fee of £800,000 where he played an important role in some of the club's greatest successes, including the remarkable win in the Olympiastadion against Bayern Munich in the UEFA Cup.\n\nIn his first game his two goals helped Norwich defeat Arsenal 4–2 at Highbury on the opening day of the first ever Premier League season. The Canaries were 2–0 down with a quarter of the game remaining before Robins scored the club's first Premier League goal in the 69th minute, followed swiftly by goals from wingers David Phillips and Ruel Fox, before Robins completed a 4–2 triumph with an 84th-minute goal.\n\nHe helped them qualify for the UEFA Cup at the end of the 1992–93 season, in which Norwich finished third in the Premier League, having led the league at several stages and featured in the title race until well into April, before his old club Manchester United finally won the title. His 1993–94 season was interrupted by a serious injury, and coincided with a slump in form for Norwich, who finished 12th after spending most of the first half of the season in the top five.\n\nIn 1994–95, after falling out with Norwich manager John Deehan, he was sold to Leicester City, but was unable to prevent them from being relegated to Division One. He did, however, help them win promotion back to the Premier League via the play-offs in 1995–96, and win the League Cup in 1996–97, when they finished ninth in the Premier League. While at Leicester Robins was loaned out to FC Copenhagen and Reading.\n\nLeicester loaned Robins to Copenhagen in 1996. Even though Robins only played six games for FC Copenhagen he managed to become a legend at the club because of a very good scoring streak which helped the club through a tough time. Among the FC Copenhagen supporters him and his then attacking partner Michael Manniche got the nicknames \"Batmanne and Robins\" which you can read in the fan clubs debate forum Sidelinien. The duo are still known as this among the FC Copenhagen supporters which you can see at the official Facebook page for FC Copenhagen. Robins also got another nickname in Denmark, \"Rubinen\", which means the ruby.\n\nAfter leaving Leicester in January 1998 Robins had further spells abroad playing for Spanish side Ourense and Greek side Panionios. While at Panionios he had a brief loan spell back in England for Manchester City, however this was disrupted by injury. \n\nRobins returned to England when he signed for Walsall in the summer of 1999, and went on to score 8 goals in 46 appearances in his one season at the club. \n\nAfter one season at Walsall Robins signed for Rotherham United in the summer of 2000. Ironically he made his debut for the club against Walsall and scored two goals as his former side won 3-2. He went on to score 26 goals in all competitions in his first season at Rotherham, including a hat-trick in a 4-3 win over Swindon Town. In February 2003 Robins was loaned to Bristol City. He scored on his debut for the club in a Football League Trophy tie against Cambridge United. In his brief spell at Bristol City he scored 5 goals in 8 appearances and helped his side reach the 2003 Football League Trophy Final. However by the time of the final he was recalled by Rotherham and unable to take part. Bristol City went on to win the final in his absence.\n\nAfter falling out of favour at Rotherham Robins joined Sheffield Wednesday in December 2003. As he had done at Bristol City Robins made an impressive debut for his new club in the Football League Trophy; scoring twice as Wednesday defeated Carlisle United.\n\nRobins ended his playing career at Conference side Burton Albion, whom he joined after leaving Sheffield Wednesday in 2004. He stayed at Burton until leaving to take up an assistant manager role at Rotherham United in January 2005.\n\nRobins made his debut for the England under-21s at the Toulon Tournament in May 1990. He started the opening group game against Portugal as England lost 1−0. In the next game, he scored five goals against France in the 7−3 win, then followed that up with a goal against Russia as England qualified for the final. Robins played the whole game in the final as England beat Czechoslovakia to lift the trophy. On 11 September, he scored in the friendly against Hungary as England ran out 3−1 winners at The Dell. His last appearance was in the defeat against Poland during qualifying for the 1992 UEFA European Under-21 Championship. Overall, Robins made six appearances for the U21s and scored seven goals.\n\nRobins joined Rotherham United in June 2000 as a player and subsequently as assistant manager, under manager Alan Knill. However, by the end of February 2007, the Millers sat 13 points adrift of safety, making the threat of relegation almost inevitable. This resulted in Knill being sacked on 1 March, with Robins becoming caretaker manager. After a spell of three wins in six games while in charge as caretaker manager, and moving the club off the bottom of League One, Robins' position was made permanent on 6 April 2007. Robins gained much praise for his first two seasons with the Millers. The first saw Rotherham consistently in the automatic promotion places until a late dip in form, and the second almost brought promotion despite a 17-point deduction imposed by the Football League. Robins also attracted many high calibre players to the Don Valley Stadium, including League 2 player of the season Nicky Law and prolific goalscorer Adam le Fondre.\n\nRobins was appointed as the new manager of Barnsley on 9 September 2009, succeeding Simon Davey. After his first game in charge, the Championship club sat at the bottom of the table looking likely candidates for relegation. By Christmas, Robins had taken them a full nine points clear of the relegation zone and on a run of eight games unbeaten. This was followed by a poor spell towards the end of the season, and Barnsley finished 18th in the table. Robins resigned from his job at the end of the 2010–11 season, because of differences with the board.\n\nOn 19 September 2012, Robins was appointed as the new manager of Coventry City, signing a three-year deal. His first game was a 2–1 home defeat against Carlisle United at the Ricoh Arena. \n\nRobins became a fan-favourite catapulting them up the league from relegation battlers to true play-off contenders all in the short time that he had been at the club.\n\nRobins took the club to the Area Final of the Football League Trophy which left the club two games away from Wembley. Coventry City also had to face two Premier League clubs away from home during his time. The first, being Arsenal in the League Cup third round, which resulted in a 6–1 defeat and the second being Arsenal's North London rivals Tottenham Hotspur which ended as a 3–0 loss, knocking the Sky Blues out the FA Cup third round.\n\nRobins was first linked with the vacant Doncaster Rovers position and various other clubs but nothing really came of this interest and he told the Sky Sports cameras before the JPT Semi-Final game against Preston North End that 'it's (Coventry City) in my blood'. However, on 12 February, Coventry City released a statement saying they had allowed Robins to go into talks with Huddersfield Town about their vacant managerial position.\n\nOn 14 February 2013, Robins was unveiled as the new manager of Huddersfield Town on a rolling contract. His first game in charge came three days later, a 4–1 defeat to Wigan Athletic in the FA Cup fifth-round at John Smith's Stadium. On 19 February 2013, Robins took charge of his first league match as Huddersfield manager, a 6–1 defeat away from home against Nottingham Forest. Robins earned his first win as Huddersfield manager on 26 February 2013, a 1–0 victory against Burnley at Turf Moor. Robins made sure that Huddersfield avoided relegation to League One on the final day of the 2012–13 season after drawing 2–2 with Barnsley.\n\nAfter surviving the following season, Robins and Huddersfield mutually agreed to part company after the first game of the 2014–15 season, a 4–0 home defeat to Bournemouth.\n\nOn 13 October 2014, Robins was appointed manager of League One club Scunthorpe United. After a run of two wins in eight games, Robins was sacked by Scunthorpe on 18 January 2016, leaving the club six points above the League One relegation zone.\n\nOn 6 March 2017, Coventry City re-appointed Robins as manager with immediate effect, the day after the sacking of previous manager Russell Slade.\n\nAgainst all the odds, on 2 April 2017, Robins lead Coventry to a 2-1 victory over Oxford United in the Checkatrade Trophy Final at Wembley. Robins won his first promotion as a manager after leading Coventry to a sixth-place finish in the 2017-18 EFL League Two, and winning the play-offs at Wembley. Over the course of the 2017-18 EFL League Two season, Robins broke numerous records as Coventry City Manager including: first top six finish in 48 years, first promotion in 51 years and most points in a season. Robins' achievements gained much plaudits from local press and fans alike, when considering Coventry City had only moved down the Football League since relegation from the Premier League in 2001.\n\nThe win in the League Two Play Off Final, represented Coventry's third competitive win at Wembley and Robin's second trophy in just over a year.\n\nIn October 2019 he signed a new contract with the club.\n\nManchester United\n\nLeicester City\n\nIndividual\n\nCoventry City\n\n"}

He played with Manchester United, Celtic and Bristol Rovers, among others. He represented his country at under 21 level.\n\nMartin started his career in the Manchester United youth system. In 1990, he scored the only goal in the FA Cup final replay against Crystal Palace. This was one of just two goals Martin scored in his entire United career. The other goal, his first, came 16 months earlier in the 3–1 defeat of West Ham at Upton Park.\n\nHis debut came on 9 May 1988 as a substitute in a 2–1 home league win over Wimbledon and he made his breakthrough at left back the following season following the departure of Arthur Albiston. By the time of his first United goal, in a 3–1 win at West Ham United in the league of 21 January 1989, he was a regular feature in the United squad.\n\nHe played in 32 out of 38 league games in the cup winning 1989–90 campaign, but managed just 14 league games the following season as Clayton Blackmore established himself as United's regular left-back, with Denis Irwin joining as a right-back, and Martin struggled against a back injury.\n\nHe did not make the squad for the side that won the European Cup Winners Cup a year later, although he did play in multiple games en route to the final. The arrival of Paul Parker that summer increased the competition for full-back places.\n\nHe managed just one league appearance in 1991–92 and did not make the squad for the Football League Cup winning team. However, he did collect a European Super Cup winner's medal on 19 November 1991 when he featured in their 1–0 triumph over Red Star Belgrade at Old Trafford, though he was substituted in the 71st minute in favour of Ryan Giggs.\n\nHe failed to make a single league appearance in 1992–93 season, when they won the first FA Premier League title. His final league appearance came on 23 October 1993 in a 1–0 Premier League win over Everton at Goodison Park, as United were on course for retaining the league title. They also went on to win the FA Cup that season. 1993–94 saw the introduction of squad numbers in the Premier League, and Martin made one appearance in the number 21 shirt. His final competitive appearance for the club was on 27 October 1993 in a 5–1 home win over Leicester City in the third round of the League Cup.\n\nTowards the end of his time at Manchester United, Martin regularly captained the reserve side.\n\nMartin played a total of 108 games and scored two goals for United before he left Old Trafford in January 1994 to join Celtic, where he suffered a broken leg within months of his arrival. He played just 19 times in the league in more than two years as Celtic failed to overhaul Rangers, who were league champions of Scotland in each of three seasons that Martin spent north of the border. Celtic's only major honour during Martin's time there was the Scottish FA Cup in 1995, but he didn't make the squad for that game.\n\nHe finally left Celtic in 1996 and signed for Bristol Rovers, from where he later had a loan spell with Huddersfield Town. He retired from professional football in 1998.\n\nHe then moved to the semi-professional League of Wales team Bangor City, Glossop North End and then to NEWI Cefn Druids in 2006.\n\nMartin retired from football in 2008, and currently works with young people helping them to gain qualifications, access college and get apprenticeships or employment in the West Cheshire area.\n\nHe also helps with the coaching of the Chester FC under 16's youth team.

The school consists of an elementary school, a middle school, and a high school, all located on the Chōfu campus. There is also an early learning center (nursery-kindergarten) for children aged 3–5 located in the Roppongi Hills complex in downtown Tokyo. Instruction is in English and follows an American-style curriculum. About two thirds of the school's students are the children of citizens of a wide variety of countries who are on temporary assignment in Japan, and the remaining one third are Japanese students who speak English. The campus is fenced in, resulting from heightened security measures taken after the September 11 attacks, with campus surroundings including the Nogawa Park and the neighborhood of Tama. The \"Good Schools Guide International\" called ASIJ \"an impressive school, not only for its size and facilities but also for its strong sense of where it is going.\"\n\nOfficially founded in 1902, The American School in Japan was started by a group of women who recognized the need for a school among the growing foreign community. Beginning life in rented rooms in the Kanda YMCA, the Tokyo School for Foreign Children, as it was then known, quickly attracted a growing numbers of students from around the world and soon needed to move to a more permanent home in Tsukiji. In 1921, the school moved to a new 3 story building in Shibaura. The building was deemed unsafe after the Great Kanto earthquake, and classes resumed on the Friends Mission compound in Shiba, in the former home of the Bowles family.\n\nIn the early 1920s Frank Lloyd Wright, who was in Tokyo building the Imperial Hotel, drew designs for a proposed new campus, as did Antonin Raymond. Although neither of the designs were constructed, Raymond assisted in the move and repurposing of some buildings when the school moved to Nakameguro in 1927. In 1933, local expatriate architect William Merrell Vories was asked to design and build a new main concrete building for the campus, which was completed in 1934. After closing during the war years, the school reopened in 1946. The current campus in Chofu was opened in 1963.\n\nA series of major improvements to the main campus began in the late 1990s, with seismic updates, a new elementary school gym, and an expansion to the high school which included a redesigned entrance. A new cafeteria building with classrooms and administrative offices on the second and third floors opened in 2003. In 2004, the school's Early Learning Center opened in Roppongi Hills, moving from Nakameguro. A new theater complex opened in 2005. Between 2006 and 2009, athletic fields and playgrounds were upgraded and solar panels were installed. Between 2010 and 2013, a series of changes designed by Paul Tange addressed campus traffic flow, added new athletic facilities (including raised tennis courts with covered bus drop-off below, and replaced the Multipurpose Room, along with the Elementary music and art classrooms with the CADC (Creative Art Design Center) which not only houses the music and art classrooms, but also houses multiple rooms for the high school and middle school Design Technology classes, a Japanese Culture center, and holds multiple meeting rooms.\n\nIn March 2014, the school publicly announced that a teacher, Jack Moyer, had sexually abused students during his tenure from 1963~1988. He also continued to be involved in the school's 7th grade Miyake outdoor program until 2002, when the erupting island volcano ended that locale for the program. The school stated that the current administration and board had found out about this abuse in November 2013. However, victims of Moyer allege that past administrators were informed as far back as 1968. The school says that it has no record of this earlier reporting. Moyer committed suicide in 2004. Alumni called on the school to commission an independent investigation into a possible years-long cover-up by the school's administration over the abuse allegations. The school announced on 4 June 2014 that it had contracted the law firm Ropes & Gray to conduct an independent investigation into the allegations against Moyer and how ASIJ responded to the allegations.\n\nIn June, 2015, the ASIJ Board of Directors released a letter admitting that an independent investigation found that Jack Moyer's abuse of students was extensive and that the abuse was covered up by faculty and administrators for years. The board apologized for the harm this has caused and promised to release the report in English and Japanese by mid-June, 2015. The full report, released by Ropes & Gray LLP on June 15, 2015, concluded \"[i]n light of all of the evidence we have examined, it is apparent to us that Moyer was\na serial pedophile who, in our assessment, sexually abused female ASIJ students\". Lawyers for 13 of the victims also released their report on June 15, 2015.\n\nASIJ follows a broadly American curriculum and 17 Advanced Placement courses are offered for high school juniors and seniors. There is a Japanese language program, which begins in the first grade. Other languages taught are Spanish and Chinese. All the students in the Elementary School must learn Japanese for one period every other day. There are 50 different levels in the Japanese classes.\nThe Early Learning Center's philosophy is heavily influenced by the Reggio Emilia Approach and the curriculum is project based. The elementary school uses the Columbia Writing Program and Everyday Math program in addition to curriculum units developed by faculty.\nIn 2012, ASIJ joined Global Online Academy, a consortium of leading independent schools that offers courses taught by consortium member teachers to member school students. GOA courses are designed to give students an opportunity to offer their local perspective to global issues.\n\nSAFE, Student Action for the Environment, has been recycling paper for over a decade, approximately 20 tons last year. The school started keeping baseline data on energy usage and garbage volumes in 2007 when they began composting cafeteria waste and campus leaves using earthworms. The compost is used to fertilize the gardens and greenery around campus. Used cooking oil is donated to Revo International to produce biodiesel fuel.\n\nReflective paint on building roofs, reflective film on windows, the installation of more double pane windows and LED lighting were largely accomplished in 2008. In 2009, with the help of government funding and private and corporate donors, the school installed solar panels on top of the gym and pool buildings which have a maximum capacity of 80 kW/h. ASIJ also promotes energy conservation each year by not turning on the heat or air-conditioning during October and April, aka NO HEAT-NO COOL months, and has reduced PET bottle consumption by promoting the use of water bottles such as SIGG and replaced regular PET bottles in vending machines with Coca-Cola's I Lohas bottles. Since the 2007-2008 school year, ASIJ has reduced annual energy consumption on campus by 25.1% with a goal of 30% by the end of 2013.\n\nA 2010-2011 carbon footprint audit by ECO3 Design has given the school new goals to replace heavy-oil boilers and install a ground source heat exchange system.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1795103", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1795103", "title": "Response spectrum", "text": "Response spectrum\n\nA response spectrum is a plot of the peak or steady-state response (displacement, velocity or acceleration) of a series of oscillators of varying natural frequency, that are forced into motion by the same base vibration or shock. The resulting plot can then be used to pick off the response of any linear system, given its natural frequency of oscillation. One such use is in assessing the peak response of buildings to earthquakes. The science of strong ground motion may use some values from the ground response spectrum (calculated from recordings of surface ground motion from seismographs) for correlation with seismic damage.\n\nIf the input used in calculating a response spectrum is steady-state periodic, then the steady-state result is recorded. Damping must be present, or else the response will be infinite. For transient input (such as seismic ground motion), the peak response is reported. Some level of damping is generally assumed, but a value will be obtained even with no damping.\n\nResponse spectra can also be used in assessing the response of linear systems with multiple modes of oscillation (multi-degree of freedom systems), although they are only accurate for low levels of damping. Modal analysis is performed to identify the modes, and the response in that mode can be picked from the response spectrum. These peak responses are then combined to estimate a total response. A typical combination method is the square root of the sum of the squares (SRSS) if the modal frequencies are not close. The result is typically different from that which would be calculated directly from an input, since phase information is lost in the process of generating the response spectrum.\n\nThe main limitation of response spectra is that they are only universally applicable for linear systems. Response spectra can be generated for non-linear systems, but are only applicable to systems with the same non-linearity, although attempts have been made to develop non-linear seismic design spectra with wider structural application. The results of this cannot be directly combined for multi-mode response.\n\nResponse spectra are very useful tools of earthquake engineering for analyzing the performance of structures and equipment in earthquakes, since many behave principally as simple oscillators (also known as single degree of freedom systems). Thus, if you can find out the natural frequency of the structure, then the peak response of the building can be estimated by reading the value from the ground response spectrum for the appropriate frequency. In most building codes in seismic regions, this value forms the basis for calculating the forces that a structure must be designed to resist (seismic analysis).\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the ground response spectrum is the response plot done at the free surface of the earth. Significant seismic damage may occur if the building response is 'in tune' with components of the ground motion (resonance), which may be identified from the response spectrum. This was observed in the 1985 Mexico City Earthquake where the oscillation of the deep-soil lake bed was similar to the natural frequency of mid-rise concrete buildings, causing significant damage. Shorter (stiffer) and taller (more flexible) buildings suffered less damage.\n\nIn 1941 at Caltech, George W. Housner began to publish calculations of response spectra from accelerographs. In the 1982 EERI Monograph on \"Earthquake Design and Spectra\", Newmark and Hall describe how they developed an \"idealized\" seismic response spectrum based on a range of response spectra generated for available earthquake records. This was then further developed into a design response spectrum for use in structural design, and this basic form (with some modifications) is now the basis for structural design in seismic regions throughout the world (typically plotted against structural \"period\", the inverse of frequency). A nominal level of damping is assumed (5% of critical damping).\n\nFor \"regular\" low-rise buildings, the structural response to earthquakes is characterized by the fundamental mode (a \"waving\" back-and-forth), and most building codes permit design forces to be calculated from the design spectrum on the basis of that frequency, but for more complex structures, combination of the results for many modes (calculated through modal analysis) is often required. In extreme cases, where structures are either too irregular, too tall or of significance to a community in disaster response, the response spectrum approach is no longer appropriate, and more complex analysis is required, such as non-linear static or dynamic analysis like in seismic performance analysis technique.\n\n\n\n"}

In addition to studying computer science at MIT (graduating with a B.S. in Computer Science & Electrical Engineering in 1977), he also distinguished himself on the wrestling team, where he was the 1976 NCAA Division III runner-up the heavyweight division, and in stage productions, the most successful of which was \"A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum\", in which he played Miles Gloriosus.\n\nAfter graduation he worked in Manhattan as a computer professional, while also attending the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal as an alternate in the heavyweight wrestling team. His preparation for the 1980 Olympics in Moscow was cut short when the United States boycotted the event. He also won the Bronze Medal in the international competition held in Tehran in 1978.\n\nThe 6'6\" (198 cm), 340-pound (154 kg) wrestler was spotted in the New York Athletic Club by a casting director, which led to his role as the fearsome \"Terror\", leader of the Fordham Baldies, in the 1979 Philip Kaufman film \"The Wanderers\". He continued to juggle his careers in film and information technology while also singing frequently with the Amato Opera in New York, studying to become a Heldenbaritone, and teaching computer programming at Manhattan Community College. He is perhaps best known for his role as Grossberger in \"Stir Crazy\" with Richard Pryor and Gene Wilder, which was released in December 1980 and has been regularly shown on TV over the years. Erland was also featured in the 1987 Arnold Schwarzenegger film \"The Running Man\", which was his last film appearance. He played Dynamo, a sadistic stalker who announces his presence by singing an aria from Mozart's \"Marriage of Figaro\" and electrocutes his victims. He once turned down a film role because he did not want to shave his head as he did for \"The Wanderers\" and \"Stir Crazy\".\n\nErland Van Lidth De Jeude married Annette Friend on September 22, 1986, with whom he had one son, Christiaan. His brother Philip Van Lidth De Jeude, who was featured in the Dutch children's film \"Abeltje\" (released November 1998) as the Generalissimo, originally sang as a baritone and then as a dramatic tenor in both Europe and the United States, and sister Philine van Lidth de Jeude is a dramatic soprano and free-lance photographer.\n\nHe was born into the Dutch noble family Van Lidth De Jeude and held the predicate of untitled nobility \"Jonkheer\" (comparable to the archaic usage of the British \"Esquire\" and cognate to the German \"Junker\").\n\nVan Lidth De Jeude died of heart failure in September 1987 at age 34, a few months after finishing work on \"The Running Man\".\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1795137", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1795137", "title": "CocoRosie", "text": "CocoRosie\n\nCocoRosie is an American musical group formed in 2003 by sisters Bianca \"Coco\" and Sierra \"Rosie\" Casady. The sisters were born and raised in the United States, but formed the band in Paris after reconnecting for the first time in years. Their music has been described as \"freak folk\" and \"New Weird America\", and incorporates elements of pop, blues, opera, electronica, and hip hop.\n\nCocoRosie began as a duo, with Sierra singing, playing the guitar, piano and harp, and Bianca singing and manipulating various children's toys, electronic, percussion instruments, wind Instruments, as well as other exotic noisemakers. They subsequently added various backing musicians, usually a bassist, keyboardist, and beatboxer. They have been a very active touring group, playing across Europe, North and South America, and elsewhere. They have released six full-length albums: \"La maison de mon rêve\" (2004), \"Noah's Ark\" (2005), \"The Adventures of Ghosthorse and Stillborn\" (2007), \"Grey Oceans\" (2010), \"Tales of a GrassWidow\" (2013), and \"Heartache City\" (2015).\n\nThey are vocal feminists and published a feminist magazine in 2013, \"Girls Against God.\"\n\nSierra Casady was born in Iowa, and Bianca was born in Hawaii. When Sierra was about five years old and Bianca was three, their parents separated. The girls lived with their mother, Christina Chalmers, an artist and singer of Syrian Orthodox ancestry who grew up in Iowa. They moved to new towns almost every year, living in Hawaii, California, New Mexico, and Arizona. Because their mother believed that the girls would learn more doing art in the \"real world\" than in school, neither sister finished high school. Chalmers nicknamed her daughters \"Rosie\" (Sierra) and \"Coco\" (Bianca), from which the musical act takes its name.\n\nThe Casady sisters are now estranged from their father, Timothy Casady, an Iowa farmer and teacher who became interested in Native American religion and shamanism. As children, the sisters spent summers with him, while he took part in \"vision quests\". The girls did not enjoy these experiences at the time, but later came to appreciate some of the things that interested him.\n\nIn 1998, at about age 18, Sierra moved to New York City. Two years later, she moved into a tiny apartment in the Montmartre district in Paris, France, to pursue a career as an opera singer, studying at the Conservatoire de Paris. During this period, Sierra lost contact with Bianca, who was living in New York City. Bianca studied linguistics and sociology, and pursued her passion of visual arts and writing.\n\nIn 2003, Bianca joined Sierra in Paris. The pair spent a summer producing music in Sierra's bathroom, chosen as the most acoustic and isolated room in the apartment. The songs feature vocals from both women, acoustic guitar played by Sierra and various other improvised instruments. The songs were compiled into their debut album \"La maison de mon rêve\".\n\n\"La maison de mon rêve\" was originally intended to be distributed among a close circle of the artists' friends. However, in 2004 the group was signed to the independent label Touch and Go Records which released the lo-fi album.\n\nCocoRosie released their second album, \"Noah's Ark\", in 2005. The album includes collaborations with Anohni from Antony and the Johnsons (\"Beautiful Boyz\"), Devendra Banhart (\"Brazilian Sun\"), and French rapper Spleen (\"Bisounours\"). The album was recorded in a variety of locations as the sisters traveled. The album's cover, a drawing by Bianca of three unicorns having sex while one of them vomits drops corresponding to the color spectrum, was selected by \"The Guardian\" and Pitchfork Media as one of the worst album covers of all time.\n\nIn 2006, Sierra started a side project, Metallic Falcons, with friend Matteah Baim. The project is signed to Voodoo Eros Records, a new label started by Bianca with business partner Melissa Shimkovitz. Bianca also opened the Voodoo Eros Museum Of Nice Items, an art gallery and performance space in New York City (123 Ludlow St) most recently home to an exhibition of Bianca's art \"Red Bone Slim VS. Itself: an Exhibition of Drawings\".\n\nCocoRosie's third full-length studio album, \"The Adventures of Ghosthorse and Stillborn\", was released on April 10, 2007. It was produced by Valgeir Sigurðsson, Björk's longtime collaborator. The songs are about the Casady sisters' family and their deceased brother. It was recorded at their mother's farm in the Camargue region of France. The album's cover is a photo by Pierre et Gilles that features Sierra as two women, and Bianca in drag. In a 2008 interview with AfterEllen.com, Bianca expressed surprise that many people do not realize she is queer, given that she frequently performs in drag.\n\nIn May 2007, while touring in support of \"The Adventures of Ghosthorse and Stillborn\", the band was involved in an incident which resulted in the cancellation of the remainder of the North American leg of the tour. No official explanation was released; vague and unconfirmed reports claimed that unidentified members of the band were arrested and deported while crossing the Canada–US border.\n\nOn May 13, 2008, CocoRosie released a new single entitled \"God Has a Voice, She Speaks Through Me\". The song was released digitally and as a 7\" picture disc single (limited to 3000 pieces). The B-side of the 7\" features a short and untitled song, which merely consists of noises. Though the picture on the B-side of the vinyl has lyrics from the song \"Hairnet Paradise\", which was previously only performed live, the actual song on the recording is very different.\n\nThe duo spent much of 2008 writing and recording in various locations such as New York city, Réunion, Paris and Berlin where they also teamed up with artist Neda Sanai that is the spoken word voice on the song \"R.I.P Burn Face\". In 2009, CocoRosie's relationship with Touch and Go Records became unclear. A self-released EP entitled \"Coconuts, Plenty of Junk Food\" was made available for sale exclusively at CocoRosie shows on June 3, 2009. The band was named the 16th most influential artist of the decade by betterPropaganda in 2009.\n\nCocoRosie signed with Sub Pop records in 2010. Their fourth full-length album, \"Grey Oceans\", was released on May 11, 2010.\n\nOn June 5, 2012, CocoRosie released their double A-Side 7\" single, \"We Are On Fire\", with Touch and Go Records. The cover art for the new single was a Twin Rivers collaboration between Bianca and Jesse Hazelip. Their fifth album, \"Tales of a GrassWidow\", was released in the United States on May 27, 2013 on the City Slang record label.\n\nOn February 6, 2015, the duo confirmed via their Twitter account that a new record was in the works. Bianca also later confirmed on Twitter of an upcoming solo album. In August 2015, CocoRosie announced the new album, \"Heartache City,\" was set for release in late 2015. The duo also released a behind the scenes video on their YouTube account of themselves in the studio recording two songs for the album, \"Hairnet Paradise\" and \"Big and Black.\" On July 10, 2015, CocoRosie released a live version of a new song entitled \"Heartache City\" on their SoundCloud account, with the studio version to be released on their upcoming sixth album, . Shortly after, CocoRosie posted the full album to stream on their SoundCloud page. It was premiered on The Fader. The duo also released the music video for new song \"Lost Girls\" on Facebook. The album was eventually released in October 2015.\n\nIn October 2015, Bianca announced details of her solo project, Bianca Casady and the C.i.A, also featuring Takuya Nakamura (bass guitar and trumpet), Doug Wieselman (clarinet and e-guitar), Lacy Lancaster (drums), Jean-Marc Ruellan (piano) and Bino Sauitzvy (dance).\n\nCocoRosie have been frequent collaborators of American avant-garde theater director Robert Wilson (director), composing scores to his award-winning international productions including \"Peter Pan\" at the Berliner Ensemble, \"The Fairy Tales of Pushkin\" in Moscow and \"Edda\" at the Norske Theater in Oslo. They have also performed at The Watermill Center.\n\nThe duo released a new single entitled \"Smoke 'em Out,\" featuring Anohni, on January 17, 2017, as a protest song against the presidential election of Donald Trump, while also confirming they have started work on a new album.\n\nIn 2005, sound illustrator Frédéric Sanchez used \"Brazilian Sun\", \"Not for Sale\" and \"Good Friday\" as part of the soundtrack he created for Miuccia Prada's spring 2006 show. The piece was called \"Coco Rosie Through the Looking Glass\". In 2008, music by CocoRosie was used in a Swedish rendition of Shakespeare's \"Hamlet\" at the Royal Dramatic Theatre (Dramaten), with Jonas Malmsjö playing Prince Hamlet.

It is usually sung by bass-baritones such as Hans Hotter, Theo Adam or Bryn Terfel. Wagner himself calls this voice type \"Hoher Bass\" (high bass) rather than baritone. In his opera scores he distinguishes between the two so that Wolfram in \"Tannhäuser\" is labelled \"Bariton\", whereas Wotan in \"Die Walküre\" is called \"Hoher Bass\". Wolfram is a much more lyrical part than Wotan, and normally the same singer would not have both parts on his repertoire.\n\nHeldenbaritone parts are different from dramatic baritone parts in Italian operas (such as Scarpia in Puccini's \"Tosca\" or Iago in Verdi's \"Otello\") in that the Italian parts have a much higher tessitura and the vocal line is much more like that of a dramatic tenor, whereas the Wagner Heldenbariton is in effect a bass singer with a high register and only occasionally stretch to the high notes of the dramatic Italian baritone. Other Heldenbaritone parts include Kaspar in Weber's \"Der Freischütz\", Jochanaan in Strauss' \"Salome\" and the title role in Verdi's \"Falstaff\".\n"}
{"id": "1795147", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1795147", "title": "Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice (Saudi Arabia)", "text": "Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice (Saudi Arabia)\n\nThe Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice (), abbreviated CPVPV and colloquially termed \"hai’a\" (committee), is a Saudi government religious authority charged with implementing the Islamic doctrine of \"hisbah\". It traces its modern origin to a revival of the pre-modern official function of \"muhtasib\" (market inspector) by the first Saudi state (1745–1818). The committee was established in 1976 in its current form, with the main goal of supervising markets and public morality. It has been assisted by volunteers, and often described as Islamic religious police. It has been called mutawa, mutaween and by other similar names in English-language sources, with various translations.\n\nIn the early 2010s, the committee was estimated to have 3,500-4,000 officers on the streets, assisted by thousands of volunteers, with an additional 10,000 administrative personnel. Committee officers and volunteers have been known to patrol public places, with volunteers focusing on enforcing strict rules of hijab, segregation between the sexes, and daily prayer attendance. Officers were authorized to pursue, detain and interrogate suspected violators prior to the 2016 reforms.\n\nThe name of the committee has also been translated as \"Committee for the Propagation of Virtue and the Elimination of Sin\", abberviated CAVES. They are known colloquially as \"hai’a\" (literally \"committee\", also transliterated as \"Haia\" or \"Hayaa\").\n\nIn academic sources, committee officers or the volunteers have also been called by several Arabic terms derived from the root \"ṭ-w-ʿ\", including \"mutaṭawwiʿūn\" (, volunteers), \"muṭawwiʿ\" (, one who compels obedience), and \"muṭāwiʿa\" (no literal translation given). These words are etymologically related to the Quranically derived terms \"muṭṭawwiʿa\" and \"mutaṭawwiʿa\" (those who perform supererogatory deeds of piety). English-language press has used the names \"mutawa\" and \"mutaween\".\n\nThe committee's rationale is based on the classical Islamic doctrine of \"hisba\", which is associated with the Quranic injunction of \"enjoining good and forbidding wrong\", and refers to the duty of Muslims to promote moral rectitude and intervene when another Muslim is acting wrongly. In pre-modern Islamic history, its legal implementation was entrusted to a public official called \"muhtasib\" (market inspector), who was charged with preventing fraud, disturbance of public order and infractions against public morality. This office disappeared in the modern era everywhere in the Muslim world, including Arabia, but it was revived by the first Saudi state (1745–1818) and continued to play a role in the second (1823–87), due to its importance within Wahhabi doctrine. Under the third Saudi state, the most zealous followers of Ibn Sa'ud were appointed as \"muhtasibs\", but their severity caused conflict with the local population and foreign pilgrims. In response, committees were established in Riyadh and Mecca in 1932 to check their excesses. In 1976 the committees were united under an official of ministerial rank, acting under direct royal command. The unified \"Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice\" is mainly responsible for supervising markets and public order. It has been assisted by volunteers, who enforce attendance of daily prayers and gender segregation in public places.\n\nIn 2009, the CPVPV created and formalized a special \"Anti-Witchcraft Unit\" to \"educate the public about the evils of sorcery, investigate alleged witches, neutralize their cursed paraphernalia, and disarm their spells\". The unit also had a hotline on the CPVPV website for Saudis to report any magic to local officials.\n\nIn January 2012, Abdul Latif Abdul Aziz al-Sheikh was appointed head of the mutaween. He \"holds the rank of cabinet minister and reports directly to the king\". His agency employs more than 4,000 \"field officers\" and reportedly has another 10,000 administrative personnel. Its 2013 budget was the equivalent of $390 USD million.\n\nThe Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice enforces traditional Islamic morality by arresting or helping to secure the arrest of people who engage in conduct that violates Islamic principles and values. They are tasked with enforcing conservative Islamic norms of behavior defined by Saudi authorities. They monitor observance of the dress code and ensure that shops are closed during prayer times. In some instances, they broke into private homes on suspicion of untoward behavior, though this attracted criticism from the public and the government.\n\nUpon being appointed head of the CPVPV, Abdul Latif Abdul Aziz al-Sheikh identified \"five areas the religious police should focus on\": preserving Islam, preventing blackmail, combating sorcery, fighting human trafficking, and ensuring that no one disobeys the country’s rulers.\n\nSaudi mutaween are often accompanied by the regular police, but also patrol without police escort. They recently launched a website on which un-Islamic behavior can be reported.\n\nWhile on patrol, the duties of the Mutaween include, but are not restricted to:\n\n\nThe punishment for such offenses is severe, often involving beatings and humiliation, and foreigners are not excluded from arrest. The mutaween encourage people to inform on others they know who are suspected of acting unvirtuously, and to punish such activities.\n\nIn 2010, a 27-year-old Saudi man was sentenced to five years in prison, 500 lashes of the whip, and a SR50,000 fine after appearing in an amateur gay video online allegedly taken inside a Jeddah prison. According to an unnamed government source, \"The District Court sentenced the accused in a homosexuality case that was referred to it by the Commission for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice (the Hai’a) in Jeddah before he was tried for impersonating a security man and behaving shamefully and with conduct violating the Islamic teachings.\" The case started when the Hai’a’s staff arrested the man under charges of practicing homosexuality. He was referred to the Bureau for Investigation and Prosecution, which referred him to the District Court.\n\nAmong the Western practices suppressed by the mutaween is the celebration of Valentine’s Day. Condemning the festivities as a \"pagan feast\", Mutaween inspect hotels, restaurants, coffeehouses, and gift shops on 14 February to prevent Muslim couples from giving each other Valentines or other presents. The sale of red roses, red stuffed animals, red greeting cards and other red gift items is banned, according to store owners. These items are confiscated, and those selling them subject to prosecution.\n\nThe children's game \"Pokémon\" was banned in 2001. The sale of the fashion doll Barbie was banned as a consumer product for posing a moral threat to Islam, stating: \"Jewish Barbie dolls, with their revealing clothes and shameful postures, accessories and tools are a symbol of decadence to the perverted West. Let us beware of her dangers and be careful.\" Fulla dolls were designed and approved as more acceptable.\n\nIn 2006 the police issued a decree banning the sale of dogs and cats, also seen as a sign of Western influence. The decree which applies to the Red Sea port city of Jeddah and the holy city of Mecca bans the sale of cats and dogs because \"some youths have been buying them and parading them in public,\" according to a memo from the municipal affairs ministry to Jeddah’s city government. In 2013 two Saudi men were arrested for giving \"free hugs to passersby\".\n\nIn December 2010 it was reported by Arab News that the Hai'a had launched a massive campaign against \"sorcery\" or \"black magic\" in the Kingdom. The prohibition includes \"fortune tellers or faith healers\". (Some people executed for sorcery following the announcement include a man from Najran province in June 2012, a Saudi woman in the province of Jawf, in December 2011, and a Sudanese man executed in September 2011. A Lebanese television presenter of a popular fortune-telling programme was arrested while on pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia and sentenced to death, though after pressure from the Lebanese government and human rights groups, he was freed by the Saudi Supreme Court.)\n\nIn May 2012, the head of the mutaween, Abdul Latif Abdul Aziz al-Sheikh, stated that anyone using social media sites, such as Twitter, \"has lost this world and his afterlife\".\n\nAccording to authors Harvey Tripp and Peter North, mutaween became involved in the city planning of the Eastern Province industrial city of Jubail sometime in the 1980s and 1990s. Halfway through the construction of that city the mutaween visited the engineering drawing office several times, first to insist that all planning maps included the direction of Mecca. On their second visit they ordered that city sewage lines (already built) not flow in the direction of Mecca. After being convinced that the curvature of the earth prevented this, the mutaween returned to insist that the drainage pipes of toilets inside the city's buildings also not violate this principle. The mutaween's demands came despite the fact that no Saudi building code mentioned their requirement and no other Saudi cities met it. While a good deal of the planners' and engineers' time was spent responding to the mutaween's concerns, the mutaween never returned to approve the contractor's solution and no pipes ended up having to be unearthed and redirected, leaving Tripp and North to conclude that Mutaween's \"point\" was not to protect Mecca but to demonstrate the supremacy of religion in Saudi Arabia to foreign builders.\n\nThe offices of Saudi Aramco, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, and foreign embassies are off limits to mutaween.\nNot off limits are personnel of Saudi government agencies. \"Hai’a\" have been known to detain government officials, (A male government employee minder of American journalist Karen Elliott House was detained for mixing of the sexes, causing her to wonder that \"a government employee following the instructions of his ministry runs afoul of that same government's religious police.\")\n\nOn 11 April 2016, the Saudi Council of Ministers issued a new regulation that limits the jurisdiction of the Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice.\n\nThe new regulation has 12 clauses; most notable of them are:\n\nOne of the most widely criticized examples of mutaween enforcement of Sharia law came in March 2002, when 15 young girls died of burns or smoke asphyxiation by an accidental fire that engulfed their public school in Mecca. According to two newspapers, the religious police forcibly prevented girls from escaping the burning school by locking the doors of the school from the outside, and barring firemen from entering the school to save the girls, beating some of the girls and civil defense personnel in the process. Mutaween would not allow the girls to escape or to be saved because they were 'not properly covered', and the mutaween did not want physical contact to take place between the girls and the civil defense forces for fear of sexual enticement. The CPVPV denied the charges of beating or locking the gates, but the incident and the accounts of witnesses were reported in Saudi newspapers such as the \"Saudi Gazette\" and \"Al-Iqtisaddiyya\". The result was a very rare public criticism of the group.\n\nIn May 2003, \"Al-Watan\", a Saudi reform newspaper published several reports of people being mistreated by the police force, including the story of one woman from a remote southern town who had been beaten and held in solitary confinement for riding alone in the back of a taxi.\n\nIn May 2007, a man alleged to have alcohol in his home (Salman Al-Huraisi) was reported by \"Arab News\" to have been arrested and beaten to death in his own home by CPVPV members in the Al Oraija district of Riyadh. \"The father of the deceased said that commission members continued to beat his handcuffed son, even though he was already covered in blood, until he died\" at the Oraija CPVPV center in Riyadh. Another man who died while in custody of the CPVPV was Ahmed Al-Bulawi. He was a driver for a woman with whom he was accused of being in a state of seclusion (when a man and an unrelated woman are together) and died after being taken to a CPVPV center in Tabuk in June 2007. According to Irfan Al-Alawi, \"in both cases, the families of the victims took the mutawiyin to court, and in both instances (as in others) charges against the mutawiyin were postponed indefinitely or dropped.\"\n\nA case of \"sorcery\" that led to a sentence of death which was overturned was that of Ali Hussain Sibat, the Lebanese host of the popular TV call-in show aired on satellite TV across the Middle East. Sibat was arrested in Medina by the CPVPV in May 2008, while visiting Saudi Arabia to perform the Umrah pilgrimage. Sibat was charged with \"sorcery\" for making predictions and giving advice to the audience on his show. On 9 November 2009, after court hearings not open to the public or a defense lawyer Sibat was sentenced to death. The case was upheld on appeal but after an international outcry was overturned by the Supreme Court on 11 November 2010. The case was controversial in part because neither the defendant or \"victims\" were Saudis, and the \"crime\" was not committed in Saudi Arabia.\n\nMutaween suppression of religious activity by non-Muslims in Saudi Arabia is also controversial. \"Asia News\" alleges that \"at least one million\" Roman Catholics in the kingdom are being \"denied pastoral care ... none of them can participate in mass while they are in Saudi Arabia ... Catechism for their children – nearly 100,000 – is banned.\" It reports the arrest of a Catholic priest for saying mass. On 5 April 2006 a Catholic priest, \"Fr. George [Joshua] had just celebrated mass in a private house when seven religious policemen (muttawa) broke into the house together with two ordinary policemen. The police arrested the priest and another person.\"\n\nIn August 2008, a young Saudi woman who had converted to Christianity was reportedly burnt to death after having her tongue cut out by her father, a member of the Committee, though it was not an officially sanctioned act of punishment.\n\nIn January 2013, the CPVPV marched into an educational exhibit of dinosaurs at a shopping center, \"turned off the lights and ordered everyone out, frightening children and alarming their parents\". It was not clear why the exhibit—which had been \"featured at shopping centres across the Gulf for decades\"—was closed, and Saudis speculated irreverently as to the reason on Twitter.\n\nIn September 2013 the entrance of a Saudi religious police building \"was intentionally set on fire by assailants\", according to the Hai'a. No one was hurt and no further information was provided by the police. In early 2014, the head of Hai'a, Sheikh Abdul Latif al-Sheikh was quoted in the \"Okaz\" daily newspaper as saying that \"there are advocates of sedition within the Commission\" for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice, and promised to remove them.\n\nIn 2009, the head of the Hai'a in Mecca, Sheikh Ahmad Qasim al Ghamdi, stated that there was nothing wrong with men and women mixing in public places, and instructed his mutawa'a to not interfere with mixing. However religious conservatives pressured the national head of the Hai'a to fire him. \"Within hours of the firing of the Sheikh Al Ghamdi, the Hai'a issued an embarrassing retraction: `The information sent out today concerning administrative changes at some Hai'a offices, particularly those concerning Mecca and Hail, was inaccurate and the administration has requested editors not to publish it.`\" However the firing and the retraction of the firing became \"major news\". \"Outraged conservatives went to Sheiksh Al Ghamdi's home, demanding to `mix` with his females... still other outraged opponents scrawled graffiti on his home,\" according to journalist Karen Elliott House.\n\nOther accusations leveled at the CPVPV include that some of its members have been involved in political subversion, and/or are ex-convicts/prisoners who became Hafiz (i.e. memorized the Quran) to reduce their prison sentences. Author Lawrence Wright has written of a conflict between the Mutaween and at least one allied imam and Turki bin Faisal Al Saud, the head of the Presidency of General Intelligence (Al Mukhabarat Al A'amah) between 1977 and 2001. After an imam denounced a female charitable organizations run by some of Turki's sisters and accused them of being \"whores\" during a Friday sermon, Turki demanded and received an apology. He then \"secretly began monitoring members of the muttawa. He learned that many of them were ex-convicts whose only job qualification was that they had memorized the Quran in order to reduce their sentences.\" But Turki believed they had become \"so powerful\" they \"threatened to overthrow the government.\"\n\nAnother instance when the CPVPV has opposed the Saudi government came in 2005 when the Minister of Labor announced a policy of staffing lingerie shops with women. The policy was intended to give employment to some of the millions of adult Saudi women unhappily stuck at home (only 14.6% of Saudi women work in the public and private sectors in the Kingdom), and to prevent mixing of the sexes in public (\"ikhtilat\"), between male clerks and women customers. Conservative Saudis opposed the policy maintaining that for a woman to work outside the house was against her fitrah (natural state). The few shops that employed women were \"quickly closed\" by the \"Hai'i\" who supported the conservative position.\n\nHowever, in 2011, during the Arab Spring, King Abdullah issued another decree giving lingerie shops—and then shops and shop departments specializing in other products for women, such as cosmetics, \"abayas\" and wedding dresses—one year to replace men workers with women. Further clashes followed between conservatives and \"Hai'a\" men on the one hand, and the ministry, women customers and employees at female-staffed stores on the other. In 2013, the Ministry and the \"Hai'a\" leadership met to negotiate new terms. In November 2013, 200 religious police signed a letter stating that female employment was causing such a drastic increase in instances of \"ikhtilat\", that \"their job was becoming impossible.\"\n\nAccording to one journalist with many years of experience in Saudi Arabia, Karen Elliott House, the Hai’a are sometimes used to balance the policies of the government; specifically a loose rein on the Hai'a acts to calm the displeasure of the strong religious conservative forces in Saudi society. \nWhen the king dismissed a member of the Council of Senior Religious Scholars in 2009 for condemning gender mixing at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, he compensated for it by doing \"nothing to curb the country's religious police from roaming the kingdom's streets and harassing ordinary Saudis mixing with anyone of the opposite genders\".\n\nAccording to the US Library of Congress Country Studies, mutawwiin \"have been integral to the Wahhabi movement since its inception. Mutawwiin have served as missionaries, as enforcers of public morals, and as `public ministers of the religion` who preach in the Friday mosque. Pursuing their duties in Jiddah in 1806, the mutawwiin were observed to be `constables for the punctuality of prayers ... with an enormous staff in their hand, [who] were ordered to shout, to scold and to drag people by the shoulders to force them to take part in public prayers, five times a day.`\" Robert Lacey describes them as \"vigilantes\". \"The righteous of every neighbourhood [that] banded themselves together into societies for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice.\"\n\nAccording to a study by Michael Cook, based on \"Wahhabi writings and rulers' decrees\" the role of commanding good and forbidding wrong developed a prominent place during the second Saudi emirate, and the first \"documented instance of a formal committee to enforces the duty dates to 1926\", when the official Saudi newspaper in Mecca published the news of its establishment.\nIn 1976, the Al al-Sheikh director of the Committee gained a seat on the Saudi cabinet, strengthening its prestige.\n\nFollowing the November–December 1979 Grand Mosque Seizure, when religion became more conservative in Saudi Arabia, \"people noticed that imams and religious folk seemed to have more money to spend ... with the religious police benefiting most obviously from government injections of cash. They started to appear in imposing new GMC vans, with their once humble local committees of mutawwa ... taking on the grander, `Big Brother` aura of their original, collective name -- Al Hayah, `the Commission`. They developed attitude to match.\" \n\nThey were still, however, \"essentially volunteers engaged in their own variety of social work.\"\n\nThe deaths of 15 young girls in 2002 in Mecca from the mutaween's refusal to let them leave a burning school was widely publicized and damaged the mutaween's image.\n\nIn May 2006 it was announced that the committee would no longer be allowed to interrogate those it arrests for behavior deemed un-Islamic. Prior to this, commission members enjoyed almost total power to arrest, detain, and interrogate those suspected of violating the Sharia.\n\nIn June 2007 the Saudi mutaween announced \"the creation of a 'department of rules and regulations' to ensure the activities of commission members comply with the law, after coming under heavy pressure for the death of two people in its custody in less than two weeks\". The governmental National Society for Human Rights criticised the behaviour of the religious police in May 2007 in its first report since its establishment in March 2004. In May 2006 the Interior Ministry issued a decree stating that \"the role of the commission will end after it arrests the culprit or culprits and hands them over to police, who will then decide whether to refer them to the public prosecutor.\"\n\n\"Time\" magazine ran a report about the mutaween in August 2007. It noted that \"a campaign using text messages sent to mobile phones is calling on a million Saudis to declare that '2007 is the year of liberation.'\" Despite statements of reform, the mutaween turned down \"Time\"'s request for interviews.\n\nAt the beginning of October 2012, during the Arab Spring, Abdul Latif Abdul Aziz Al-Sheikh announced that the powers of the mutawiyin would be significantly restricted. According to Irfan Al-Alawi,They will be barred from making arrests, conducting interrogations, or carrying out searches without a warrant from the local governor. They will no longer stand at the entrances of shopping malls to keep women out who do not adhere to the Wahhabi dress code or who are not accompanied by “approved” men—husbands, siblings, or parents. \"Community volunteers\", who were the original mutaween, were forbidden from joining Hai’a men on their rounds and pursuing, chastising, and interrogating miscreants, as \"a religious duty\". Field officers were also ordered to \"approach people with a smile,\" and forbidden from using their \"private e-mails, cellphones, or social media accounts to receive and act on anonymous tips.\"\n\nOutside Saudi Arabia, in Iran, the Guidance Patrol functions as the country's main public religious police, imposing Islamic dress codes and norms in public. The Taliban regime, or Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, also had a \"Ministry of the Propagation of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice\" with a very similar religious policing function. The Taliban are thought to have borrowed the Saudi policing policy not only because they also had a strict Sharia law policy, but because of alleged financial and diplomatic support from Saudi Arabia. According to a Pakistani journalist who spent much time among the Taliban, the Taliban who had been to Saudi Arabia before taking power in Afghanistan \"were terribly impressed by the religious police and tried to copy that system to the letter\".\n\n"}

On its summit stands an Iron Age hill fort, which is a Scheduled Ancient Monument.\n\nHill forts developed in the Late Bronze and Early Iron Age, roughly the start of the 1st millennium BC. The reason for their emergence in Britain, and their purpose, has been a subject of debate. It has been argued that they could have been military sites constructed in response to invasion from continental Europe, sites built by invaders, or a military reaction to social tensions caused by an increasing population and consequent pressure on agriculture. The dominant view since the 1960s has been that the increasing use of iron led to social changes in Britain. Deposits of iron ore were located in different places to the tin and copper ore necessary to make bronze, and as a result trading patterns shifted and the old elites lost their economic and social status. Power passed into the hands of a new group of people. Archaeologist Barry Cunliffe believes that population increase still played a role and has stated \"[the forts] provided defensive possibilities for the community at those times when the stress [of an increasing population] burst out into open warfare. But I wouldn't see them as having been built because there was a state of war. They would be functional as defensive strongholds when there were tensions and undoubtedly some of them were attacked and destroyed, but this was not the only, or even the most significant, factor in their construction\".\n\nThe hill fort is known, in archaeological circles, as Cadbury-Congresbury in order to differentiate it from the Cadbury Castle hillfort in South Cadbury. It appears to have been constructed in the Iron Age when one or more ramparts, with walls and ditches, were built on the steep slopes of the hill to defend an area covering some eight and a half acres. The remains of Iron Age round houses may still be seen inside. The hill fort was refortified around 400 and occupation extended into the sub-Roman period, from which much imported pottery has been recovered. It has been suggested that this was the monastery of Saint Congar after whom Congresbury was named.\n\nExcavation took place between 1968 and 1973, and was published in 1992 Mediterranean imports were found with 173 A-ware and 547 B-ware sherds and around 48 glass vessels. These suggest that the hill was the site of an elite settlement.\n\nCadbury Hill is a designated Local Nature Reserve. In 2009, a 19th-century agricultural stock pond – previously hidden by undergrowth – was restored by the Yatton & Congresbury Wildlife Action Group (YACWAG). The Local Nature Reserve comprises ancient semi-natural woodland, scrub and unimproved grassland. Species of interest include marsh tit, noctule bat, slow worm, wood anemone, bluebell, betony, small scabious, rock rose, small leaved lime. On the northern limestone slope grow hundreds of common spotted orchids. The hill fort itself has many ant hills, which are visited by green woodpeckers.\n\nThe grassy plateau of the hill fort is owned and managed by Yatton and Congresbury Parish Councils and the rest, including a car park and former landfilled quarry, by North Somerset Council.\n\n"}

There were separate grants for Dissenters in England and for Presbyterian clergy in Ireland. The money originally came from the monarch's privy purse as an \"ex gratia\" donation, but it later became an annual grant voted by Parliament.\n\nThe Irish \"Regium Donum\" originated in a grant of £1,200 pa to Presbyterian clergy in the north of Ireland made by William III in 1690 as a reward for the loyalty of Presbyterians during the war in Ireland following the Glorious Revolution. Queen Anne, when instituting \"Queen Anne's Bounty\" to augment poor Anglican livings, also added another £800 pa to assist Presbyterian clergy in the rest of Ireland (an offer of similar assistance to English Dissenting Ministers was declined). The Irish Regium Donum was discontinued in 1869, when the Anglican Church of Ireland was disestablished.\n\nThe English \"Regium Donum\" was instituted in 1723, originally £500 pa to allow the payment of pensions of widows of Dissenting Ministers, but later increased to £1,000 pa to also cover augmentation of income of living ministers. From Charles II onwards, there had been earlier royal donations to Dissenting clergymen, but political motives were suspected, and a proposed grant of £1,000 pa by Queen Anne was declined. The \"Regium Donum\" was originally not publicised, and one eighteenth-century critic saw it as a secret bribe to Dissenters to support Sir Robert Walpole and to buy off any agitation against the civil disabilities of Dissenters (e.g. the Test and Corporation Acts).\n\nReform of royal finances by Pitt the Younger resulted in the \"Regium Donum\" becoming a grant voted by Parliament, rather than a charge upon the Civil List. In principle, this changed it from an ex gratia payment to a forced donation by taxpayers (including those opposed to the religious views of those supported): the \"Regium Donum\" was therefore henceforth opposed (on the grounds of consistency) by some advocates of the disestablishment of the Church of England. There was growing opposition by organised Dissent; because of this, the government announced in 1851 that the \"Regium Donum\" would not be voted in subsequent years.\n"}

One example of this process is that of parrot fishes which bite off pieces of coral, digest the living tissue, and excrete the inorganic component as silt and sand. However, the term \"coral\" in \"coral sand\" is used loosely in this sense to mean limestone of recent biological origin; corals are not the dominant contributors of sand particles to most such deposits. Rather, remnant skeletal fragments of foraminifera, calcareous algae, molluscs, and crustaceans can predominate. Because it is composed of limestone, coral sand is acid-soluble. \n\nCoral sand mining is a significant industry in some areas, and can have damaging environmental effects. Over 500,000 tons of coral sand are mined annually from Mauritius. Many Comoros beaches have been scarred by sand mining. Over 250 tons of shells and corals were exported from Tanzania in 1974. Exploitive collection has moved from the depleted areas off Tanzania and Kenya to the islands of Zanzibar and Mafia.\n\nSuch extensive mining can be very harmful to reef ecosystems and beaches.\n\nIn an effort to prevent damage from reef sand mining, the Convention on international trade in endangered species urged parties to the convention to work for the conservation and sustainable use of the coral reef ecosystems.\n\n"}

It is a National Nature Reserve and a Special Area of Conservation. Part of it is a Geological Conservation Review site and an area of is Oxenbourne Down, which is designated a Local Nature Reserve. Part of it is a Scheduled Monument.\n\nIt is a chalk hill and one of the highest points in Hampshire. It is also the highest point on the chalk ridge of the South Downs and the second highest point in the South Downs National Park after Blackdown in the Western Weald. Although only high, it qualifies as one of England's Marilyns. It is located within the borders of the Queen Elizabeth Country Park.\n\nThe name Butser comes from the Old English Bryttes Oran meaning Briht's slope. Oran or Ora is Old English for flat topped hill and/or steep slope.\n\nThe flat summit is surrounded by a number of spurs. Iron Age ditches and banks divide the spurs from the summit although the purpose of these earthworks is unclear.\n\nThere is evidence of lynchet farming on the southeast side of the hill. The age of the lynchets is unknown but Roman pottery has been brought to the surface by rabbit holes.\n\nThere are aerial masts on the hill.\n\nThe hill was purchased by Hampshire County Council in 1966. Prior to the purchase the summit was used for growing wheat but now the only farming activity is grazing.\n\nButser Hill has a rich variety of flora and fauna located upon the hill. Butser Hill is in the top twenty Hampshire chalk grassland sites for its rich vascular flora, and is the richest chalk grassland site in Hampshire in terms of its bryophyte (125 species) and lichen (82 species) flora. As well as this, over 30 species of butterfly have been recorded, including populations of Duke of Burgundy and the Silver-spotted Skipper, making the area an important conservation area for many butterfly species.\n\nThere is an annual Fell Run called the Butser Hill Challenge that involves running up and down the hill three times.\n\nA spur of Butser Hill known as Little Butser was the original home of the Butser Ancient Farm experimental archaeology project.\n\nButser Hill has been a primary hang-gliding site since the early-1970s.\n\n"}

The Caldecott Medal was named in his honour. He exercised his art chiefly in book illustrations. His abilities as an artist were promptly and generously recognised by the Royal Academy. Caldecott greatly influenced illustration of children's books during the nineteenth century. Two books illustrated by him, priced at a shilling each, were published every Christmas for eight years.\n\nCaldecott also illustrated novels and accounts of foreign travel, made humorous drawings depicting hunting and fashionable life, drew cartoons and he made sketches of the Houses of Parliament inside and out, and exhibited sculptures and paintings in oil and watercolour in the Royal Academy and galleries.\n\nCaldecott was born at 150 Bridge Street (now No 16), Chester, where his father, John Caldecott, was an accountant, twice married with thirteen children. Caldecott was his father’s third child by his first wife, Mary Dinah Brookes. In 1848, the family moved to Challoner House, Crook Street, Chester, and in 1860 to 23 Richmond Place, Boughton, a village just outside the city. \n\nFrom his early childhood, Caldecott drew and modelled, mostly animals. His main education came with five years at the King's School, Chester, a grammar school then in the cathedral precinct in the city centre, which he left at the age of fifteen. In that same year, 1861, he first had a drawing published, a sketch of a disastrous fire at the Queens Railway Hotel in Chester, which appeared in the \"Illustrated London News\", together with his account of the blaze.\n\nOn leaving school, Caldecott went to work as a clerk at the offices of the Whitchurch & Ellesmere Bank in Whitchurch, Shropshire, and took lodgings at Wirswall, a village near the town. When he was out on errands, he was either walking or riding around the countryside, and many of his later illustrations incorporate buildings and scenery of Cheshire and that part of Shropshire.\n\nCaldecott’s love of riding led him to take up fox hunting, and his experiences in the hunting field and his love of the chase bore fruit over the years in a mass of drawings and sketches of hunting scenes, many of them humorous.\n\nAfter six years at Whitchurch, Caldecott moved to the head office in Manchester of the Manchester & Salford Bank. He lodged variously in Aberdeen Street, Rusholme Grove and at Bowdon. He took the opportunity to study at night school at the Manchester School of Art and practised continually, with success in local papers and some London publications. It was a habit of his at this time, which he maintained all his life, to decorate his letters, papers and documents of all descriptions with marginal sketches to illustrate the content or provide amusement. A number of his letters have been reprinted with their illustrations in \"Yours Pictorially\", a book edited by Michael Hutchings. In 1870, a painter friend in London, Thomas Armstrong, put Caldecott in touch with Henry Blackburn, the editor of \"London Society\", who published a number of his drawings in several issues of the monthly magazine.\n\nEncouraged by this evidence of his ability to support himself by his art, Caldecott decided to quit his job and move to London; this he did in 1872 at the age of 26. Within two years he had become a successful magazine illustrator working on commission. His work included individual sketches, illustrations of other articles and a series of illustrations of a holiday which he and Henry Blackburn took in the Harz Mountains in Germany. The latter became the first of a number of such series.\nHe remained in London for seven years, spending most of them in lodgings at 46 Great Russell Street just opposite the British Museum, in the heart of Bloomsbury. While there he met and made friends (as he did very readily) with many artistic and literary people, among them Dante Gabriel Rossetti, George du Maurier (who was a fellow contributor to \"Punch\"), John Everett Millais and Frederic Leighton. His friendship with Frederic (later Lord) Leighton led to a commission to design peacock capitals for four columns in the Arab room at Leighton's rather exotic home, Leighton House in Kensington. (Walter Crane designed a tiled peacock frieze for the same room.)\n\nIn 1869 Caldecott exhibited a picture in the Royal Manchester Institute. He had a picture exhibited in the Royal Academy for the first time in 1876. He was also a watercolourist and was elected to the Royal Institute of Painters in Water Colours in 1882.\n\nIn 1877 Edmund Evans, who was a leading colour printer using coloured woodblocks, lost the services of Walter Crane as his children's book illustrator and asked Caldecott for illustrations for two Christmas books. The results were \"The House that Jack Built\" and \"The Diverting History of John Gilpin\", published in 1878. They were an immediate success; so much so that Caldecott produced two more each year for Evans until he died. Many of Evans’ original printing blocks survive and are held at St Bride Library in London. The stories and rhymes were all of Caldecott's choosing and in some cases were written or added to by himself. In another milieu Caldecott followed \"The Harz Mountains\" with illustrations for two books by Washington Irving, three for Juliana Ewing, another of Henry Blackburn's, one for Captain Frederick Marryat and for other authors. Among well known admirers of his work were Gauguin and Van Gogh.\n\nRandolph continued to travel, partly for the sake of his health, and to make drawings of the people and surroundings of the places he visited; these drawings were accompanied by humorous and witty captions and narrative.\nIn 1879 he moved to \"Wybornes\", a house near Kemsing in Kent. It is there that he became engaged to Marian Brind, who lived at Chelsfield about seven miles away. They were married on 18 March 1880 and lived at \"Wybornes\" for the next two years. There were no children of the marriage. In the autumn of 1882 the Caldecotts left Kent and bought a house, \"Broomfield\", at Frensham in Surrey; they also rented No 24 Holland Street, Kensington. By 1884, sales of Caldecott's \"Nursery Rhymes\" had reached 867,000 copies (of twelve books) and he was internationally famous.\n\nCaldecott's health was generally poor and he suffered much from gastritis and a heart condition going back to an illness in his childhood. It was his health among other things which prompted his many winter trips to the Mediterranean and other warm climates. It was on such a tour in the United States of America in 1886 that he was taken ill again and died. He and Marian had sailed to New York and travelled to Florida in an unusually cold February; Randolph was taken ill and died at St. Augustine. He was not quite 40 years old. A headstone marks his grave in the cemetery there.\n\nSoon after his early death, his many friends contributed to a memorial, which was designed by Sir Alfred Gilbert. It was placed in the crypt of St Paul's Cathedral, London. There is also a memorial to him in Chester Cathedral.\n\nGleeson White wrote of Caldecott:\nG. K. Chesterton wrote in a Caldecott picture book that he presented to a young friend:\n\nFor Maurice Sendak \"Caldecott's work heralds the beginning of the modern picture book. He devised an ingenious juxtaposition of picture and word, a counterpoint that never happened before. Words are left out—but the picture says it. Pictures are left out—but the word says it.\" Sendak also appreciated the subtle darkness of Caldecott's work: \"You can't say it's a tragedy, but something hurts. Like a shadow passing quickly over. It is this which gives a Caldecott book—however frothy the verses and pictures—its unexpected depth.\"\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is the SNES equivalent of the \"Star Wars\" NES game. \"Super Star Wars\" features mostly run and gun gameplay, although it has stages which feature other challenges, such as driving a landspeeder or piloting an X-wing. It also features multiple playable characters with different abilities.\n\nThe game was followed by two sequels based on the subsequent \"Star Wars\" films, \"\" (1993) and \"\" (1994).\n\n\"Super Star Wars\" generally follows the plot of \"Star Wars\", although some allowances were made to adapt the story to suit an action game. For example, instead of simply buying C-3PO and R2-D2 from the Jawas, Luke Skywalker must fight his way to the top of a Jawa sandcrawler while leaping from a series of moving conveyor belts. Brief cutscenes between levels tell an abbreviated version of the film's story through written text. Later stages allow the player to control smuggler and pilot Han Solo or Chewbacca the Wookiee. The game also features several vehicle-based levels in which the player takes control of an X-Wing or a landspeeder.\n\nMost of the stages consist of run and gun and platforming gameplay, with several different upgrades available to the standard blaster weapon. Luke can also wield a lightsaber after acquiring it from Obi Wan Kenobi. The end of the game has players reenacting Luke's Death Star trench run to destroy the Death Star, with Darth Vader confronting the player in his TIE Advanced x1.\n\nArtist Jon Knoles did the visual designs for the characters, while Harrison Fong drew the backgrounds. Fong recounted that he did very little concept drawing before rendering the characters on the computer \"because everybody knew what the \"Star Wars\" characters looked like.\" Originally, the game design was planned to give the characters a dark black outline around their bodies. However, this idea was abandoned, as it was thought to make the characters too cartoonish-looking.\n\nThe \"Kalhar Boss Monster\" is based on one of the chess pieces R2D2 plays with on the Millennium Falcon in the film. There was a trash compactor level that was deleted from the game due to lack of cartridge space. An image was published in an issue of Electronic Gaming Monthly around the time of the game's release.\n\nThe game's audio contains scores from the movie, which were all arranged by Sculptured Software's in-house musician Paul Webb. According to Webb, he was given the original handwritten scores that John Williams had created. Paul then used the company's in-house music software to convert the scores onto the SNES's 8-channel sound chip. The game's instrument samples were taken from the Ensoniq EPS and EPS16 keyboards.\n\nA PC port of \"Super Star Wars\" was in the works since 1994, by Danish game company Brain Bug and produced by Softgold. The game was almost completed, and was well into the playtesting phase, but in 1995 LucasArts decided to halt the development and cancel the release. An unfinished version of this port was leaked onto the internet, but as of 2015 LucasArts has not yet released the game into public domain.\n\nA Mega Drive version was in the works by Sega Interactive from late 1992 to some point in 1993, when it was cancelled for unknown reasons. An early prototype's ROM was dumped in 2020.\n\n\"Entertainment Weekly\" wrote that \"If you've ever fantasized about piloting an X-wing fighter into the heart of the Death Star, now you can do it—in simulated 3-D as well as reenact the movie's key plot developments.\"\n\n\"Super Star Wars\" was awarded Best Action/Adventure Game of 1992 by Electronic Gaming Monthly, as well as Best Movie-to-Game.\n\n\"Super Star Wars\" was re-released in November 1996 as part of Nintendo's Player's Choice series.\n\nThe game was released for the Wii Virtual Console on August 10, 2009.\n\nThe game was digitally re-released on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita on November 17, 2015 and in the UK on November 24, 2015.

It is situated at the banks of Ganges and was former capital of Bengal Subah under Mughal governor, Man Singh I.\n\nRajmahal region was earlier ruled by Raja Mal sub-group of Mal Paharia tribes. Earlier this place was known as \"Agmahal\" and is surrounded by Rajmahal hills on one side and river Ganges on another side. The region was also known as 'Daman-i-Koh' during Mughal rule.\n\nIn 1576, Battle of Rajmahal was fought between Mughal Emperor, Akbar and Sultan of Bengal, Daud Khan Karrani of Karrani Dynasty. After war, Daud Khan was captured and later executed by the Mughals.\n\nLater, after the conquest of Odisha in 1592, Raja Man Singh I, Mughal governor of Bengal Subah came at Rajmahal. He chose the site for his capital in 1595–96 because of its strategic command of the Teliagarhi Pass and the Ganges River. In 1608, the capital of Bengal was transferred to Dacca (now Dhaka, Bangladesh). Raja Man Singh I, also renamed the town as 'Akbarnagar' in to tribute to Emperor Akbar and he also constructed palace, garden and mosque on behalf of Mughal rulers.\n\nIn 1639, Rajmahal regained its glory and was once more made the capital of Bengal by Shah Shuja, governor of Bengal Subah and second son of Emperor Shah Jahan. It continued as the seat of the Mughal Viceroy up to 1660 and a mint town till 1661.\n\nIn 1757, Battle of Plassey was fought between Robert Clive and Nawab of Bengal, Siraj-ud-Daulah where Nawab lost the war due to treachery of Mir Jafar and he fled from Murshidabad towards Patna. During his halt at Rajmahal, Siraj-ud-Daulah was captured by Mir Jafar's son Miran and was murdered at the site.\n\nBattle of Udhwa nala at Rajmahal was fought between Mir Qasim, and Britosh in 1763. Nawab Mir Qasim was defeated by the British and fled with his family to the Rohtas (Bihar), but was not able to hide at the Rohtasgarh Fort.\n\nDuring British rule, Permanent Settlement was passed in 1793 and it forced the landlords to improve productivity of the land. The Santals were increasingly used for land reclamation and improvement and further Santals got permanently settled in the region. British also constructed Neel-Kothi for process and storage of Neel (Indigo) which was used for dying cotton cloth.\n\nLater, Daman-i-Koh became the origin of Santhal Rebellion and leaders like Sidhu and Kanhu Murmu, Chand and Bhairab,etc and they fought against the British colonial authority and the corrupt zamindari system mobilizing more than 10,000 Santhals.\n\nPlant Fossil bearing Inter-trappean beds of Rajmahal Formation nearby has been declared the National Geological Monuments of India by the Geological Survey of India (GSI), for their protection, maintenance, promotion and enhancement of geotourism.\n\n India census, Rajmahal had a population of 22,514. Males constitute 52% of the population and females 48%. Rajmahal has an average literacy rate of 62.70%, lower than the national average of 74.04%: male literacy is 68.73%, and female literacy is 56.06%.

{"id": "1795200", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1795200", "title": "Candidate gene", "text": "Candidate gene\n\nThe candidate gene approach to conducting genetic association studies focuses on associations between genetic variation within pre-specified genes of interest and phenotypes or disease states. This is in contrast to genome-wide association studies (GWAS), which scan the entire genome for common genetic variation. Candidate genes are most often selected for study based on \"a priori\" knowledge of the gene's biological functional impact on the trait or disease in question. The rationale behind focusing on allelic variation in specific, biologically relevant regions of the genome is that certain mutations will directly impact the function of the gene in question, and lead to the phenotype or disease state being investigated. This approach usually uses the case-control study design to try to answer the question, \"Is one allele of a candidate gene more frequently seen in subjects with the disease than in subjects without the disease?\" Candidate genes hypothesized to be associated with complex traits have generally not been replicated by subsequent GWASs. The failure of candidate gene studies to shed light on the specific genes underlying such traits has been ascribed to insufficient statistical power.\n\nSuitable candidate genes are generally selected based on known biological, physiological, or functional relevance to the disease in question. This approach is limited by its reliance on existing knowledge about known or theoretical biology of disease. However, more recently developed molecular tools are allowing insight into disease mechanisms and pinpointing potential regions of interest in the genome. Genome-wide association studies and quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping examine common variation across the entire genome, and as such can detect a new region of interest that is in or near a potential candidate gene. Microarray data allow researchers to examine differential gene expression between cases and controls, and can help pinpoint new potential genes of interest.\n\nThe great variability between organisms can sometimes make it difficult to distinguish normal variation in SNP from a candidate gene from disease-associated variation. In analyzing large amounts of data, there are several other factors that can help lead to the most probable variant. These factors include priorities in SNPs, relative risk of functional change in genes, and linkage disequilibrium among SNPs.\n\nIn addition, the availability of genetic information through online databases enables researchers to mine existing data and web-based resources for new candidate gene targets. Many online databases are available to research genes across species.\n\nBefore the candidate-gene approach was fully developed, various other methods were used to identify genes linked to disease-states. These methods studied genetic linkage and positional cloning through the use of a genetic screen, and were effective at identifying relative risk genes in Mendelian diseases. However, these methods are not as beneficial when studying complex diseases for several reasons:\n\n\nDespite the drawbacks of linkage analysis studies, they are nevertheless useful in preliminary studies to isolate genes linked to disease.\n\nA study of candidate genes seeks to balance the use of data while attempting to minimize the chance of creating false positive or negative results. Because this balance can often be difficult, there are several criticisms of the candidate gene approach that are important to understand before beginning such a study. For instance, the candidate-gene approach has been shown to produce a high rate of false positives, which requires that the findings of single genetic associations be treated with great caution.. \n\nOne critique is that findings of association within candidate-gene studies have not been easily replicated in follow up studies.For instance, a recent investigation on 18 well-studied candidate genes for depression (10 publications or more each) failed to identify any significant association with depression, despite using samples orders of magnitude larger than those from the original publications. In addition to statistical issues (e.g. underpowered studies), population stratification has often been blamed for this inconsistency; therefore caution must also be taken in regards to what criteria define a certain phenotype, as well as other variations in design study.\n\nAdditionally, because these studies incorporate \"a priori\" knowledge, some critics argue that our knowledge is not sufficient to make predictions from. Therefore, results gained from these 'hypothesis-driven' approaches are dependent on the ability to select plausible candidates from the genome, rather than use an anonymous approach. The limited knowledge of complex disease can result in 'information bottleneck', which can be overcome by comparative genomics across different species. This bias can also be overcome by carefully choosing genes based on what factors are most likely to be involved in phenotype.\n\nThese critiques are important to remember as one examines their experimental approach. With any other scientific method, the candidate gene approach itself is subject to critique, but still proven to be a powerfully effective tool for studying the genetic makeup of complex traits.\n\nThe candidate gene approach is a powerful tool to studying complex diseases, particularly if its limitations are overcome by a wide complementary approach. One of the earliest successes in this field was finding a single base mutation in the non-coding region of the APOC3 (apolipoprotein C3 gene) that associated with higher risks of hypertriglyceridemia and atherosclerosis. In a study by Kim et al., genes linked to the obesity trait in both pigs and humans were discovered using comparative genomics and chromosomal heritability. By using these two methods, the researchers were able to overcome the criticism that candidate gene studies are solely focused on prior knowledge. Comparative genomics was completed by examining both human and pig QTL through a method known as GCTA (genome-wide complex trait analysis), which allowed the researchers to then map genetic variance to specific chromosomes. This allowed the parameter of heritability to provide understanding of where phenotypic variation was on specific chromosomal regions, thus extending to candidate markers and genes within these regions. Other studies may also use computational methods to find candidate genes in a widespread, complementary way, such as one study by Tiffin et al. studying genes linked to type 2 diabetes.\n\nMany studies have similarly used candidate genes as part of a multi-disciplinary approach to examining a trait or phenotype. One example of manipulating candidate genes can be seen in a study completed by Martin E. Feder on heat-shock proteins and their function in \"Drosophila melanogaster\". Feder designed a holistic approach to study Hsp70, a candidate gene that was hypothesized to play a role in how an organism adapted to stress. \"Drosophila\" is a highly useful model organism for studying this trait due to the way it can support a diverse number of genetic approaches for studying a candidate gene. The different approaches this study took included both genetically modifying the candidate gene (using site-specific homologous recombination and the expression of various proteins), as well as examining the natural variation of Hsp70. He concluded that the results of these studies gave a multi-faceted view of Hsp70. The manipulation of candidate genes is also seen in Caspar C. Chater's study of the origin and function of stomata in \"Phsycomitrella patens\", a moss. PpSMF1, PpSMF2 and PpSCRM1 were the three candidate genes that were knocked down by homologous recombination to see any changes in the development of stomata. With the knock down experiment, Chater observed that PpSMF1 and PpSCRM1 were responsible for stomata development in \"P. patens.\" By engineering and modifying these candidate genes, they were able to confirm the ways in which this gene was linked to a change phenotype. Understanding the natural and historical context in which these phenotypes operate by examining the natural genome structure complemented this.\n\n"}

Baugh has claimed to have discovered human footprints alongside dinosaur footprints near the Paluxy River in Texas. Baugh promotes creationism as the host of the \"Creation in the 21st Century\" TV program on the Trinity Broadcasting Network. \n\nThe scientific community considers his claims pseudoscience. The creationist groups Answers in Genesis and Answers in Creation have characterized his claims as incorrect or deceptive. Baugh claims to have multiple doctorates, all of which are from unaccredited schools. He was also the president and a graduate of Pacific International University, an unaccredited university located in Springfield, Missouri.\n\nBorn in Kenedy, Texas, Baugh graduated in 1955 from Abilene High School in Abilene, Texas. He formerly appeared on Trinity Broadcasting Network program \"Creation in the 21st Century\". Baugh was also the president and a graduate of the Pacific International University.\n\nIn 1984, Baugh started the Creation Evidence Museum in a double-wide trailer in Glen Rose, Texas, near Dinosaur Valley State Park, to promote creationism. The museum exhibits have been strongly criticized by scientists as incorrectly identified dinosaur prints, other fossils, or outright forgeries.\nIn 2008, a descendant of a family that found many original Paluxy River dinosaur tracks in the 1930s claimed that her grandfather had faked many of them. Others, such as purported dinosaur claws, were identified by University of Texas at Austin paleontologist Wann Langston as crocodile teeth.\n\nIn 1996, Baugh presented his \"man-tracks\" in the widely criticized program \"The Mysterious Origins of Man\". Creationist Ken Ham, of Answers in Genesis, criticized the claims in a review titled \"Hollywood's 'Moses' Undermines Genesis,\" regarding Baugh: \"According to leading creationist researchers, this evidence is open to much debate and needs much more intensive research. One wonders how much of the information in the program can really be trusted!\" He also has been given television exposure by the tele-evangelist Kenneth Copeland. He has authored several self-published books on such topics as the age of the universe, dinosaurs coexisting with humans and critiques of evolution.\n\nIn 2001 Baugh and Creation Evidence Museum were featured on \"The Daily Show\" where Baugh likened human history to The Flintstones and the show poked fun at his claims about the hyperbaric biosphere, pterodactyl expeditions, and dinosaurs.\n\nHe is a promoter of intelligent design. In 2002 he appeared with William A. Dembski at a conference in Texas and has built his more recent web material around ID and Dembski.\n\nBoth scientists and creationists have criticized Baugh's claims. Between 1982 and 1984, several scientists (including J.R. Cole, L.R. Godfrey, R.J. Hastings, and S.D. Schafersman) examined Baugh's purported \"mantracks\" as well as others provided by creationists in the Glen Rose Formation. In the course of the examination, \"Baugh contradicted his own earlier reports of the locations of key discoveries\" and many of the supposed prints \"lacked human characteristics.\" After a three-year investigation of the tracks and Baugh's specimens, the scientists concluded there was no evidence of any of Baugh's claims or any \"dinosaur-man tracks\".\n\nOn September 27, 1984, Al West, a Baugh co-worker for two years, who followed the mantrack claims since 1974, and friend of Glen Kuban, publicly announced that Baugh \"never had evidence for manprints as claimed.\" Gayle Golden, writer for \"The Dallas Morning News\", reported that Baugh \"paid $10,000 for his Moab skeleton and confirmed that Baugh knew at their purchase that the bones had already been dated at 200-300 years. However Baugh later claimed that the bones were found in Cretaceous deposits.\"\n\nOne of Baugh's more famous claims, aside from the dinosaur tracks, is the London Hammer, an alleged out of place artifact of an \"18th century miner's hammer\" found in million-year-old Ordovician rock (he has also claimed it is in Cretaceous rock) found in 1934 from London, Texas. Baugh asserted this as evidence against scientifically known ways that rocks form. However, laboratory tests discounted his claim about the hammer's being formed in the rock. J.R. Cole wrote, \"The stone concretion is real, and it looks impressive to someone unfamiliar with geological processes. How could a modern artifact be stuck in Ordovician rock? The answer is that the concretion itself is not Ordovician. Minerals in solution can harden around an intrusive object dropped in a crack or simply left on the ground if the source rock (in this case, reportedly Ordovician) is chemically soluble.\"\n\nIn July 2008, Baugh was in contact with Alvis Delk and James Bishop, who claimed to have found a dinosaur-human print fossil. Baugh bought the \"fossil\" from Delk who used the money to pay his medical bills. On the authenticity of the claims, reporter Bud Kennedy noted, \"since no scientists were involved, about all we really know so far is that the museum has a new rock.\" This was deemed \"not a convincing human footprint in ancient rock\" by biologist Glen J. Kuban and called a \"blatant fake\" by biologist PZ Myers.\n\nCreationist organizations such as Answers in Genesis have criticized Baugh's claims saying he \"muddied the water for many Christians. . . . People are being misled.\" Don Batten, of Creation Ministries International wrote: \"Some Christians will try to use Baugh's 'evidences' in witnessing and get 'shot down' by someone who is scientifically literate. The ones witnessed to will thereafter be wary of all creation evidences and even more inclined to dismiss Christians as nut cases not worth listening to.\" Answers in Genesis (AiG) lists the \"Paluxy tracks\" as arguments \"we think creationists should NOT use\" [emphasis in original]. Also Answers In Creation reviewed Baugh's museum and concluded \"the main artifacts they claim show a young earth reveal that they are deceptions, and in many cases, not even clever ones.\"\n\nIn his 1992 book \"Panorama of Creation\", Baugh claims that a layer of metallic hydrogen surrounded the early earth. Furthermore, he professes that hexagonal water, or, \"Creation water\" as he calls it, is capable of healing. Such claims have been addressed by scientists as pseudoscience, and his hypotheses and credentials are not accepted in academia.\n\nBaugh has claimed several college degrees, at one point professing to earning three doctorates, when no evidence exists that he even graduated from high school. All three \"doctorates\" are from unaccredited \"schools.\" One is an honorary \"Doctor of Philosophy in Theology\" from the non-accredited California Graduate School of Theology. His claimed 1989 \"doctorate\" and master's degrees in archaeology come from the non-accredited Pacific International University, of which Baugh was also the president. His dissertation titled \"Academic Justification for Voluntary Inclusion of Scientific Creation in Public Classroom Curricula, Supported by Evidence that Man and Dinosaurs Were Contemporary\" was reviewed by Brett Vickers who criticized its \"descriptions of his field-work on the Paluxy river 'man-tracks', speculation about Charles Darwin's religious beliefs and phobias, and biblical evidence of Adam's mental excellence.\" In 2005, Baugh claimed to have completed another doctorate in theology from the unaccredited Louisiana Baptist University.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1795211", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1795211", "title": "Ragged school", "text": "Ragged school\n\nRagged schools were charitable organisations dedicated to the free education of destitute children in 19th century Britain. The schools were developed in working-class districts. Ragged schools were intended for society's most destitute children. Such children, it was argued, were often excluded from Sunday School education because of their unkempt appearance and often challenging behaviour. The London Ragged Schools Union was established in April 1844 to combine resources in the city, providing free education, food, clothing, lodging and other home missionary services for poor children. Although the London Ragged School Union did not extend beyond the metropolis, its publications and pamphlets helped spread ragged school ideals across the country. They were phased out by the final decades of the 19th century.\n\nWorking in the poorest districts, teachers (who were often local working people) initially utilized stables, lofts, and railway arches for their classes. The majority of teachers were voluntary, although a small number were employed. There was an emphasis on reading, writing, arithmetic, and study of the Bible. The curriculum expanded into industrial and commercial subjects in many schools. It is estimated that about 300,000 children went through the London ragged schools alone between 1844 and 1881.\n\nThe Ragged School Museum in the East End of London shows how a ragged school would have looked; it is housed in buildings previously occupied by Dr Thomas Barnardo. The Ragged School Museum provides an idea of the working of a ragged school, but Thomas Barnardo's institution differed considerably in practice and philosophy from those schools accountable to the London Ragged School Union.\n\nSeveral different schools claim to have pioneered truly free education for impoverished children. For many of the destitute children of London, going to school each day was not an option. From the 18th century onwards, schools for poor children were few and far between. They had been started in areas where someone had been concerned enough to want to help disadvantaged children towards a better life.\n\nIn the late eighteenth century Thomas Cranfield offered free education for poor children in London. While he was a tailor by trade, Cranfield's educational background included studies at a Sunday school on Kingsland Road, Hackney. In 1798, he established a free children's day school on Kent Street near London Bridge. By the time of his death in 1838, he had established 19 free schools providing services for children and infants living in the lower-income areas of London. These opportunities and services were offered days, nights, and on Sundays, for the destitute children of poor families throughout London.\n\nJohn Pounds, a Portsmouth shoemaker, provided important inspiration for the movement. At the age of twelve Pounds' father arranged for him to be apprenticed as a shipwright. Three years later, he fell into a dry dock and was crippled for life after damaging his thigh. Unable to work as a shipwright, John became a shoemaker and, by 1803, had his own shop in St Mary Street, Portsmouth. In 1818, Pounds, known as the \"crippled cobbler\", began teaching poor children without charging fees. He actively recruited children and young people to his school. He spent time on the streets and quays of Portsmouth making contact and even bribing them to come with the offer of baked potatoes. He began teaching local children reading, writing, and arithmetic. His reputation as a teacher grew and he soon had more than 40 students attending his lessons. He also gave lessons in cooking, carpentry and shoemaking. Pounds died in 1839. Pounds quickly became a figurehead for the schools; his ethos was used as an inspiration for the later movement.\n\nIn 1841 Sheriff Watson established a school in Aberdeen, Scotland. In contrast to the earlier efforts of Pounds and Cranfield, Watson used compulsion to increase attendance at the institution. Watson was frustrated by the number of children who committed a petty crime and faced him in his courtroom. Rather than sending them to prison for vagrancy, Watson established a school for boys. As a law official, the sheriff arrested the vagrant children and enrolled them in school.\n\nThe Industrial Feeding School opened to provide reading, writing and arithmetic. Watson believed that gaining these skills would help the boys rise above the lowest level of society. It was not confined to the 'three R's', however, as the young scholars also received instruction on geology. Three meals a day were provided and the boys were taught useful trades such as shoemaking and printing. A school for girls followed in 1843. In 1845, the schools were integrated. From here, the movement spread to Dundee and other parts of Scotland.\nThe same year that Watson established his school in Aberdeen, the Field Lane ragged school began in Clerkenwell, London. Historians have debated how connected the movement was between England and Scotland. E.A.G. Clark argued that 'the London and Scottish schools had little in common except their name'. More recently, Laura Mair has demonstrated that literature, philosophy and passionate individuals were shared between schools. She writes that 'schools forged significant links across cities and countries that disregarded physical distance'. It was S. R. Starey, the secretary of the Field Lane ragged school, who first applied the term 'ragged' to the institutions in an advert he submitted to \"The Times\" seeking public support.\n\nAlthough the Edinburgh Original Ragged School, established by the Reverend Thomas Guthrie in April 1847, was not the first ragged school in Scotland, Guthrie was later acknowledged as a core leader of the movement. His 'Plea for Ragged Schools', published in March 1847 to garner the public's support for a school in the city, laid out his indisputable arguments that proved highly influential. Guthrie was first introduced to the idea of ragged schools in 1841, while acting as the Parish Minister of St. John's Church in Edinburgh. On a visit to Anstruther in Fife, he saw a picture of John Pounds in Portsmouth and felt inspired and humbled by the cobbler's work.\n\nIn April 1844, Locke, Moutlon, Morrison, and Starey formed a steering committee to address the social welfare needs of the community. On 11 April 1844, at 17 Ampton Street off the Grays Inn Road, they facilitated a public meeting to determine local interest, research feasibility, and establish structure. This was the birth of the Ragged Schools Union. In 1944, the Union adopted the name \"Shaftesbury Society\" in honour of the 7th Earl of Shaftesbury. In 2007, the Society was merged with John Grooms, taking the new name of Livability.\n\nMr Locke of the Ragged School Union called for more help in keeping the schools open. Many petitions for funding and grants were made to Parliament to assist with educational reform. He asked the government to give more thought to \"preventing crime,\" rather than punishing the wrongdoers. He said the latter course only made the young criminals worse.\n\nIn 1840, the Mission used the term \"ragged\" in its Annual Report to describe their establishment of five schools for 570 children. In the report, the Mission reported that their schools had been formed exclusively for children \"raggedly clothed\". The children only had very ragged clothes to wear and they rarely had shoes. In other words, they did not own clothing suitable to attend any other kind of school.\n\nSeveral people volunteered and offered their time, skills, and talents as educators and administrators of the ragged schools. Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 7th Earl of Shaftesbury was one of Britain's greatest social reformers, whose broad-ranging concerns included education, animal welfare, public health and improving working conditions.\n\nIn 1844 Lord Shaftesbury became the president of the ragged schools. He used his knowledge of the schools and refuges and his understanding of the living conditions among low-income families to pursue changes in legislation. He served as the president of the London Ragged School Union for 39 years. In 1944 the Union adopted the name \"Shaftesbury Society\" in his honour. Shaftesbury maintained his commitment to the Ragged Schools and educational reform until his death in 1885.\n\nIn 1843, Charles Dickens began his association with the schools and visited the Field Lane Ragged School. He was appalled by the conditions, yet moved toward reform. The experience inspired him to write \"A Christmas Carol\". While he initially intended to write a pamphlet on the plight of poor children, he realised that a dramatic story would have more impact.\n\nDickens continued to support the schools, donating funds on various occasions. At one point, he donated funds, along with a water trough, stating that it was \"so the boys may wash and for a supervisor\"! (from a letter to Field Lane). He later wrote about the school and his experience there in \"Household Words.\" In 1837, he used the street called Field Lane as a setting for Fagin's den in his classic novel, \"Oliver Twist.\"\n\nBy 1844, there were at least 20 free schools for the poor, maintained through the generosity of community philanthropists, the volunteers working with their local churches, and the organisational support of the London City Mission. During this time, it was suggested that it would be beneficial to establish an official organisation or society to share resources and promote their common cause.\n\nIn April 1844 the London Ragged School Union was founded during a meeting of four men to pray for the city's poor children. Starey, the secretary of Field Lane school, was present. There was a massive growth in the numbers of schools, teachers and students. By 1851, the number of educators would grow to include around 1,600 persons. By 1867, some 226 Sunday Ragged Schools, 204-day schools and 207 evening schools provided a free education for about 26,000 students. However, the schools were heavily reliant on volunteers and continually faced problems in finding and keeping staff. Women played an important role as volunteer teachers. A newspaper report on the progress of the schools announced that 'the most valuable teachers in ragged schools are those of the female sex'.\n\nThe ragged school movement became respectable, even fashionable, attracting the attention of many wealthy philanthropists. Wealthy individuals such as Angela Burdett-Coutts gave large sums of money to the London Ragged School Union. This helped to establish 350 ragged schools by the time the 1870 Education Act was passed. As Eager (1953) explains, \"He [who? Antecedent not clear.]gave what had been a Nonconformist undertaking, the cachet of his Tory churchmanship – an important factor at a time when even broad-minded (Anglican) churchmen thought that Nonconformists should be fairly credited with good intentions, but that cooperation (with them) was undesirable\".\n\nThe success of the ragged schools definitively demonstrated that there was a demand for education among the poor. In response, England and Wales established school boards to administer elementary schools. However, education was still not free of fees. After 1870 public funding began to be provided for elementary education among working people.\n\nSchool boards were public bodies created in boroughs and parishes under the Elementary Education Act 1870 following campaigning by George Dixon, Joseph Chamberlain and the National Education League for elementary education that was free from Anglican doctrine. Members to the board were directly elected, not appointed by borough councils or parishes. As the school boards were built and funded, the demand for ragged schools declined. The Board Schools continued in operation for 32 years. They were officially abolished by the Education Act 1902, which replaced them with local education authorities.\n\nFounded in 1990, a Ragged School Museum occupies a group of three canalside buildings on Copperfield Road in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets that once housed the largest ragged school in London; the buildings had previously been used by Dr Thomas Barnardo.\n\nBarnardo arrived in London in 1866, planning to train as a doctor and become a missionary in China. In London, he was confronted by a city where disease was rife, poverty and overcrowding endemic and educational opportunities for the poor nonexistent. He watched helplessly as a cholera epidemic swept through the East End, leaving more than 3,000 Londoners dead and many destitute. He gave up his medical training to pursue his local missionary works and in 1867, opened his first ragged school, where children could gain a free basic education. Ten years later, Barnardo's Copperfield Road School opened its doors to children, and for the next thirty-one years it educated tens of thousands of children. It closed in 1908, by which time enough government schools had opened in the area to serve the needs of local families.\n\nThe buildings, originally warehouses for goods transported along the Regent's Canal, then went through a variety of industrial uses until, in the early 1980s, they were threatened with demolition. A group of local people joined together to save them and reclaim their unique heritage. The Ragged School Museum Trust was set up and the museum opened in 1990.\n\nThe museum was founded to make the history of the ragged schools and the broader social history of the East End accessible to all. An authentic Victorian classroom has been set up within the original buildings, in which 14,000 children each year experience a school lesson as it would have been taught more than 100 years ago.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1795228", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1795228", "title": "Pronucleus", "text": "Pronucleus\n\nA pronucleus (plural: pronuclei) is the nucleus of a sperm or an egg cell during the process of fertilization. The sperm cell becomes a pronucleus after the sperm enters the ovum, but before the genetic material of the sperm and egg fuse. Contrary to the sperm cell, the egg cell has a pronucleus once it becomes haploid, and not when the sperm cell arrives. Sperm and egg cells are haploid, meaning they carry half the number of chromosomes of somatic cells, so in humans, haploid cells have 23 chromosomes, while somatic cells have 46 chromosomes. The male and female pronuclei don't fuse, although their genetic material does. Instead, their membranes dissolve, leaving no barriers between the male and female chromosomes. Their chromosomes can then combine and become part of a single diploid nucleus in the resulting embryo, containing a full set of chromosomes.\n\nThe appearance of two pronuclei is the first sign of successful fertilization as observed during in vitro fertilisation, and is usually observed 18 hours after insemination or ICSI. The zygote is then termed a \"two-pronuclear zygote\" (2PN). Two-pronuclear zygotes transitioning through 1PN or 3PN states tend to develop into poorer-quality embryos than ones who remain 2PN throughout development, and may be significant in embryo selection in IVF.\n\nThe pronucleus was discovered the 1870s microscopically using staining techniques combined with microscopes with improved magnification levels. The pronucleus was originally found during the first studies on meiosis. Edouard Van Beneden published a paper in 1875 in which he first mentions the pronucleus by studying the eggs of rabbits and bats. He stated that the two pronuclei form together in the center of the cell to form the embryonic nucleus. Van Beneden also found that the sperm enters into the cell through the membrane in order to form the male pronucleus. In 1876, Oscar Hertwig did a study on sea urchin eggs because the eggs of sea urchins are transparent, so it allowed for much better magnification of the egg. Hertwig confirmed Van Beneden's finding of the pronucleus, and also found the formation of the female pronucleus involves the formation of polar bodies.\n\nThe female pronucleus is the female egg cell once it has become a haploid cell, and the male pronucleus forms when the sperm enters into the female egg. While the sperm develops inside of the male testes, the sperm does not become a pronucleus until it decondenses quickly inside of the female egg. When the sperm reaches the female egg, the sperm loses its outside membrane as well as its tail. The sperm does this because the membrane and the tail are no longer needed by the female ovum. The purpose of the cell membrane was to protect the DNA from the acidic vaginal fluid, and the purpose of the tail of the sperm was to help move the sperm cell to the egg cell. The formation of the female egg is asymmetrical, while the formation of the male sperm is symmetrical. Typically in a female mammal, meiosis starts with one diploid cell and becomes one haploid ovum and typically two polar bodies, however one may later divide to form a third polar body. In a male, meiosis starts with one diploid cell and ends with four sperm. In mammals, the female pronucleus starts in the center of the egg before fertilization. When the male pronucleus is formed, after the sperm cell reaches the egg, the two pronuclei migrate towards each other. However, in brown alga Pelvetia, the egg pronucleus starts in the center of the egg before fertilization and remain in the center after fertilization. This is because the egg cells of brown alga Pelvetia, the egg pronucleus is anchored down by microtubules so only the male pronucleus migrates towards the female pronucleus.\n\nThe calcium concentration within the egg cell cytoplasm has a very important role in the formation of an activated female egg. If there is no calcium influx, the female diploid cell will produce three pronuclei, rather than only one. This is due to the failure of release of the second polar body.\n\nThe formation of the zygote starts with the fusion of both the inner and outer nuclei of the male and female pronuclei. It is unknown if one of the pronuclei start the combination of the two, or if the microtubules that help the dissolution of membranes commence the action. The microtubules that make the two pronuclei combine come from the sperm’s centrosome. There is a study that strongly supports that microtubules are an important part of the fusion of the pronuclei. Vinblastine is a chemotherapy drug that affects both the plus and minus ends of microtubules. When Vinblastine is added to the ovum, there is a high rate of pronuclear fusion failure. This high rate of pronuclear fusion failure highly suggests that microtubules play a major role in the fusion of the pronucleus. In mammals, the pronuclei only last in the cell for about twelve hours, due to the fusion of the genetic material of the two pronuclei within the egg cell. Many studies of pronuclei have been in the egg cells of sea urchins, where the pronuclei are in the egg cell for less than an hour. The main difference between the process of fusion of genetic materials in mammals versus sea urchins is that in sea urchins, the pronuclei go directly into forming a zygote nucleus. In mammalian egg cells, the chromatin from the pronuclei form chromosomes that merge onto the same mitotic spindle. The diploid nucleus in mammals is first seen at the 2-cell stage, whereas in sea urchins it is first found at the zygote stage.\n"}

Sent to England by Pope Julius II, he became Latin secretary to Henry VII of England and a prebendary of Salisbury.\n\nBorn into one of the oldest families in Lucca (de Herena, also known as \"della Rena\"), he was later given the hellenized name \"Ammonio\". At the University of Bologna, he studied under Oliverius Jontus of Montegallorum, a teacher there from 1494 to 1498. Ammonio then went to Rome. By 1506, he was in England, probably travelling with Silvestro Gigli, another Luccanese, who had been sent by Pope Julius II in 1505 to give gifts to Henry VII and who became bishop of Worcester. In 1509 he became Latin secretary to William Blount, Lord Mountjoy, and by 1511 he was secretary to Henry VIII. That year, in Paris, Erasmus showed Blount the manuscript of a book of Ammonio's poems dedicated to Blount, who thought the dedication was too excessive and asked that it be changed. That was done, and Erasmus soon had the book printed.\nOn February 3, 1512, he received a prebend in the Cathedral of St. Stephen, Westminster, and later received a canonry at Worcester. Also in 1512, he was with the English expeditionary force in France when it won the Battle of the Spurs. On April 12, 1514, he became an English citizen, and in 1515 Pope Leo X appointed him subcollector of papal taxes in England, after Ammonio had conspired against Polydore Vergil for the post. Not yet 40 years old, Ammonio died suddenly in 1517 of the \"sweating sickness\" in London.\n\nThe complete poems of Ammonio were published by Clemente Pizzi in 1958.\n\nAmmonio met Erasmus when the latter visited England in 1506–1507, and they renewed their friendship from 1509–1511 after Erasmus returned from a trip to Italy. At some point they stayed together at the home of Thomas More. From 1511 to 1517 they exchanged more than 40 letters on many topics, ranging from the poor wine at Cambridge to international affairs. Ammonio helped Erasmus in his struggles to get papal permission to be free from some of the restrictios of his religious order and to gain financial security. On April 9, 1517, in the presence of Johannes Sixtinus at St. Stephen's in Westminster, and on behalf of Pope Leo X, Ammonio absolved Erasmus of all censures caused by not wearing the habit of his order. On August 19 of that year, Thomas More wrote to Erasmus, informing him of Ammonio's death.\n"}

Emmis, based on the Hebrew word for Truth, Emet was founded by Jeff Smulyan in 1980. Emmis has owned many radio stations, including KPWR and WQHT, which have notoriety for their Hip Hop Rhythmic format as well as WFAN, which was the world's first 24-hour sports talk radio station. In addition to radio, Emmis has invested in TV, publishing, and mobile operations around the United States.\n\nIn 1980, Emmis Broadcasting founder Jeffrey Smulyan purchased his first radio station, WSVL-FM Shelbyville, Indiana. In July 1981, Smulyan changed the format from country music to adult contemporary and renamed the station WENS and later to WLHK. \n\nIn 1982, Emmis acquired WLOL in Minneapolis, MN and quickly became a top contender for ratings. \n\nAround 1984, the company bought Magic 106 in Los Angeles, California; at the time, L.A. Lakers player \"Magic\" Johnson was an early spokesperson for the station. Emmis also bought KSHE in St. Louis in the same year.\n\nIn early 1986, Emmis changed Magic 106, which focused on traditional top 40 rock, to Power 106 KPWR, which would focus on dance, top40, and shock-jock talk. \n\nIn 1987, Emmis made a series of purchases including WQHT, WYNY, and WNBC in New York, WKZX-FM in Chicago, WJIB in Boston, WKUU and KXXX in San Francisco, and KKHT-FM in Houston. They also acquired WAVA-FM in Washington, D.C. from the Doubleday Broadcasting Company. Both KPWR and WQHT would pioneer the urban contemporary rhythmic format. Emmis transformed WHN into the world's first all-sports radio station, WFAN.\n\nIn 1988, Emmis entered the world of publishing. Emmis purchased Indianapolis Monthly and added WKQX in Chicago to its radio portfolio. Also, Emmis acquired five NBC radio stations in 1988.\n\nChairman and CEO Jeff Smulyan purchased the Seattle Mariners Major League Baseball team in 1989.\n\nEmmis kicked off the 1990s by selling KKHT-FM in Houston to Nationwide Communications in May 1990.\n\nIn 1991, Emmis sold two more stations: WLOL to Minnesota Public Radio and KXXX, San Francisco, to Alliance Broadcasting. Also in 1991, KMGG became KPWR, \"Power 106\" and became the first rhythmic contemporary-focused top 40 formatted outlet. \n\nIn 1992, Emmis sold WFAN, New York, to Infinity for $70M, which was one of the highest prices ever paid for an AM radio station. Emmis also sold WAVA-FM, Washington D.C., to Salem Broadcasting and WJIB, Boston, to Greater Media. In the same year, Jeff Smulyan sold the Seattle Mariners to Nintendo.\n\nEmmis grew its publishing portfolio by adding Atlanta Magazine in 1993. In the same year, Emmis launched its second hip hop station in America, Hot 97. Emmis' Q101 in Chicago moved into an Alternative Rock Format.\n\nIn 1994, the company purchased WIBC and WKLR in Indianapolis from the Horizon Broadcast Corporation and WRKS in New York City from the Summit Communications Group. WKLR was changed from an oldies format to a classic hits format with the call letters of WNAP in September 1994. Emmis became a public company, EMMS on NASDAQ, with an IPO on March 4, 1994. \n\nThe following year, 1995, WQHT and KPWR were among the top rated radio station in each of their markets. This resulted in a record-breaking accomplishment where Emmis was the first company to own top rated radio stations in the top 2 markets. Later in 1996, WHHH (formerly WTLC-AM/FM) became top rated for Urban Adult Contemporary.\n\nEmmis entered the world of international radio in 1997 when the company was awarded a license to operate in Hungary, Sláger Radio, which debuted #1 nationwide and remained the country's most popular national radio station until the Hungarian government revoked the license in 2009. Emmis added Cincinnati Magazine to its publishing group, as well as KIHT-FM and KPNT-FM in St. Louis to its rock collection.\n\nIn 1998, Emmis Broadcasting changed its name to Emmis Communications and moved into its current headquarters on Monument Circle in Indianapolis. Emmis acquired a lot of media in the same year including Texas Monthly, WRXP in New York, WTHI and WWVR in Terre Haute, and six television stations in Honolulu, New Orleans, Green Bay, and Mobile, Alabama, from SF Broadcasting and in Terre Haute, Indiana, and Ft. Myers, Florida, from Wabash Valley Broadcasting RadioNow was launched in Indianapolis as a Top 40 format. \n\nTo round out the century, Emmis purchased Country Sampler Magazine in 1999 and Liberty Media purchased 2.7 million shares of Emmis for approximately $150M.\n\nIn 2005, Emmis changed the format of its first radio station from its long-term adult contemporary format to country, and the call letters were changed from WENS to WLHK. Emmis was also named one of \"Fortune\"s 100 Best Companies to Work For. In March of that year, Emmis Communications and 98.7 KISS-FM, New York, celebrated Women's History Month by introducing their first annual salute to Phenomenal Women (also referred to as the Phenomenal Woman Awards).\n\nn 2006, Emmis flipped KZLA Los Angeles to Adult Rhythmic Contemporary as \"KMVN, Movin' 93.9\". The move gave Emmis a companion station to complement KPWR. However, on April 15, 2009, KMVN switched to Spanish-language programming, KXOS, under a seven-year Local Marketing Agreement with Grupo Radio Centro of Mexico City.\n\nOn June 9, 2009, Emmis announced it had formed a strategic alliance with StreamTheWorld, the radio industry's streaming technology and services company, to put all Emmis radio stations on a new streaming platform.\n\nOn January 12, 2011, the share price of Emmis stock surged 42% as insiders speculated that the company could be close to selling off several of its radio stations. In its January, 2011 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company reported that it had the necessary cash to survive through February, 2011. \"Absent asset sales, which the company is actively pursuing,\" Emmis attorneys stated in the regulatory filing, \"the company believes it is unlikely it will be able to maintain compliance with the financial covenants after Sept. 1, 2011\".\n\nOn August 16, 2013, Emmis launched the NextRadio smartphone app on HTC One Android phones from Sprint. A deal struck between the radio industry and Sprint facilitated the launch which subsequently enabled FM radio support for the app on additional Android devices available on the Sprint wireless network.\n\nOn October 12, 2016, Emmis announced that it would sell its radio stations in the Terre Haute cluster to Midwest Communications and DLC Media. Midwest Communications would acquire WTHI-FM and the intellectual property of WWVR while DLC Media would acquire WFNF, WFNB and the broadcast license for WWVR. Midwest Communications would also sell WDKE to DLC Media to stay under FCC ownership limits. The sale was consummated on January 27, 2017.\n\nOn March 1, 2017, Emmis annoumced it had sold four of its magazines (\"Atlanta\", \"Cincinnati\", \"Los Angeles\", and \"Orange Coast\") to Hour Media Group, LLC for $6.5 million. It also sold \"Texas Monthly\" to Genesis Park, LP for $25 million.\n\nOn May 9, 2017, Emmis announced that it ould sell KPWR to The Meruelo Group for $82.75 million. The announcement came after Emmis made a deal in April with its lenders to seek $80 million worth of divestments by January 2018 to amend its credit agreement. The Meruelo Group began operating the station under an LMA on July 1, 2017, until the sale was consummated on August 1, 2017.\n\nOn January 30, 2018, Emmis announced it would leave the St. Louis market, selling KSHE and KPNT to Hubbard Broadcasting, and KFTK and KNOU to Entercom.\n\nIn June 2019, Emmis announced that it would sell its controlling stake in its Austin stations to its minority partner Sinclair Telecable Inc. (d/b/a Sinclair Communications, unrelated to Sinclair Broadcast Group).\n\nOn July 1, 2019, Emmis announced that it would sell its New York City stations WQHT and WBLS to Mediaco Holding—an affiliate of Standard General—for $91.5 million, a $5 million promissory note, and a 23.72% stake in the new company. Mediaco Holding will be a public company, and Emmis will continue to manage the stations. The sale was completed November 27, 2019.\n\nCurrent clients include: Astral Media, Corus Entertainment, Emmis Radio, Greater Media, Lincoln Financial Media, and Renda Broadcasting,\n\nEmmis Interactive was sold to Marketron in October 2012.\n\n\n\nThe NextRadio smartphone app was developed by Emmis, with support from the National Association of Broadcasters, to take advantage of mobile devices with activated internal FM receivers. NextRadio allows users of select FM-enabled smartphones to listen to live broadcast FM radio while receiving supplemental data such as album art, program information, and metadata over the internet. Launched in August 2013 through a radio industry agreement with Sprint Corporation, the app was preloaded on select devices and was also available for download in the Google Play Store.\n\nThe NextRadio app is powered by TagStation, an Emmis-developed cloud data service for enhanced radio broadcasting. TagStation allows broadcasters a web-based platform for managing supplemental content for delivery to the NextRadio app, HD Radio receivers, and connected car dashboards.\n\nDuring the quarter ended November 30, 2018, Emmis decided to dramatically reduce the scale of operations in TagStation, LLC and NextRadio, LLC. In connection with this decision, the company recognized $1.2 million of severance related to the termination of 35 employees. Emmis Chairman and CEO Jeff Smulyan said on the company’s second quarter earnings call that Emmis was “unwilling and unable” to continue funding the NextRadio and TagStation businesses.\n\n\n\n\nEmmis announced on September 9, 2008 that it had teamed up with digital radio network [[WorldBand Media]] and would be using the \"[[HD Radio|HD-3]]\" subchannels to produce programming for the [[South Asia]]n communities in Chicago (on WLUP), Los Angeles (on KPWR), and New York (on WQHT), and would include a combination of local and international content that should be available by mid-October 2008.\n\nIn May 2005, Emmis announced its intent to sell some or all of the 16 television stations they owned at the time. In August 2005, the company announced the sale of nine television stations, as well as four more in October, an additional station in May 2006, another station in February 2007, and its final station in May 2008. Emmis no longer owns any television stations.\n\nStations are arranged alphabetically by state and by [[city of license]].\n\n\"Notes:\"\n\nNotes:\n\n\n\n\n[[Category:Emmis Communications radio stations| ]]\n[[Category:1980 establishments in Indiana]]\n[[Category:American companies established in 1980]]\n[[Category:Companies based in Indianapolis]]\n[[Category:Companies listed on NASDAQ]]\n[[Category:Magazine publishing companies of the United States]]\n[[Category:Mass media companies established in 1980]]\n[[Category:Mass media companies of the United States]]\n[[Category:Radio broadcasting companies of the United States]]"}

Many are red coloured and are known as red bugs and some species are called cotton stainers because their feeding activities leave an indelible yellow-brownish stain on cotton crops. A common species in parts of Europe is the firebug, and its genus name \"Pyrrhocoris\" and the family name are derived from the Greek roots for fire \"pyrrho-\" and bug \"coris\". Members of this family are often confused with, but can be quickly separated from, Lygaeidae by the lack of ocelli (simple eyes) on the top of the head.\n\nThe membrane of the forewing has one or two cells from which about 7-8 branching veins emerge that may have branches that fuse together (anastomose) while the main veins reach the margins of the wing. They have three tarsal segments. They can be very difficult to separate from some members of the family Largidae, which also share some of these characters and belong to the same super family. Largids tend to have the edge of the pronotum (the top of the first thoracic segment) rounded but the taxonomic feature for separating them is the found only in females; female largids have the sixth visible (actually the seventh) abdominal segment appearing to be split in the middle whereas female pyrrhocorids have this undivided. A few bugs in the family Rhopalidae have similar colors (e.g., \"Corizus hyoscyami\") but they have ocelli, as do lygaeids. The scutellum is small and triangular. The antennae are made up of four segments with the second segment longer than the third. The beak-like mouthpart or rostrum has four segments and tip reaches at least the base of the middle pair of legs. Some species have the wing reduced so that the abdomen is visible from above. More detailed distinguishing features that are usually visible only under a microscope include a much reduced scent gland opening on the mid-thoracic segment. There are three sensory hairs or trichobothria on the abdominal segments 3 to 6 and two such hairs on the seventh segment.\n\nThe genus \"Myrmoplasta\" is found in the African and Oriental regions and is somewhat unusual in having highly reduced wings and appearing ant-like or myrmecomorphic. Males and females differ in their foreleg morphology, but such sexual dimorphism is also found in a few other genera.\n\nMost species feed on seeds or fruits particularly of plants belonging to the Malvales but a few feed on rotting debris including dead animal matter. A few species are predatory; \"Raxa nishidai\" is a predator of another pyrrhocorid, \"Melamphaus faber\", while \"Antilochus coquebertii\" feeds on other bugs including \"Dysdercus cingulatus\". A few are important crop pests. One species, \"Dysdercus suturellus\", is well known in the southern cotton growing regions of the United States while \"Dysdercus cingulatus\" occurs on cotton in tropical Asia. They damage cotton bolls by staining as well as by cutting the fibres.\n\nThere are numerous genera within the family and these include:\n"}

It includes several species of cardamom, especially black cardamom. Plants of this genus are remarkable for their pungency and aromatic properties.\n\nAmong ancient writers, the name \"amomum\" was ascribed to various odoriferous plants that cannot be positively identified today. The word derives from Latin \"amomum\", which is the latinisation of the Greek ἄμωμον (\"amomon\"), a kind of an Indian spice plant. Edmund Roberts noted on his 1834 trip to China that \"amomum\" was used as a spice to \"season sweet dishes\" in culinary practice.\n\n\"See List of \"Amomum\" species for a complete list.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1795277", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1795277", "title": "Insertion (genetics)", "text": "Insertion (genetics)\n\nIn genetics, an insertion (also called an insertion mutation) is the addition of one or more nucleotide base pairs into a DNA sequence. This can often happen in microsatellite regions due to the DNA polymerase slipping. Insertions can be anywhere in size from one base pair incorrectly inserted into a DNA sequence to a section of one chromosome inserted into another. The mechanism of the smallest single base insertion mutations is believed to be through base-pair separation between the template and primer strands followed by non-neighbor base stacking, which can occur locally within the DNA polymerase active site. On a chromosome level, an \"insertion\" refers to the insertion of a larger sequence into a chromosome. This can happen due to unequal crossover during meiosis.\n\nN region addition is the addition of non-coded nucleotides during recombination by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase.\n\nP nucleotide insertion is the insertion of palindromic sequences encoded by the ends of the recombining gene segments.\n\nTrinucleotide repeats are classified as insertion mutations and sometimes as a separate class of mutations.\n\nInsertions can be particularly hazardous if they occur in an exon, the amino acid coding region of a gene. A frameshift mutation, an alteration in the normal reading frame of a gene, results if the number of inserted nucleotides is not divisible by three, i.e., the number of nucleotides per codon. Frameshift mutations will alter all the amino acids encoded by the gene following the mutation. Usually, insertions and the subsequent frameshift mutation will cause the active translation of the gene to encounter a premature stop codon, resulting in an end to translation and the production of a truncated protein. Transcripts carrying the frameshift mutation may also be degraded through Nonsense-mediated decay during translation, thus not resulting in any protein product. If translated, the truncated proteins frequently are unable to function properly or at all and can possibly result in any number of genetic disorders depending on the gene in which the insertion occurs. Methods to detect DNA sequencing errors were developed.\n\nIn-frame insertions occur when the reading frame is not altered as a result of the insertion; the number of inserted nucleotides is divisible by three. The reading frame remains intact after the insertion and translation will most likely run to completion if the inserted nucleotides do not code for a stop codon. However, because of the inserted nucleotides, the finished protein will contain, depending on the size of the insertion, multiple new amino acids that may affect the function of the protein.\n\n"}
{"id": "1795280", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1795280", "title": "Meenaxi: A Tale of Three Cities", "text": "Meenaxi: A Tale of Three Cities\n\nMeenaxi: A Tale of Three Cities (or Meenaxi) is a 2004 Hindi film directed by M.F. Husain and starring Tabu, Kunal Kapoor and Raghuvir Yadav. The film is centered on Hyderabad novelist Nawab (Yadav) who is suffering from writer's block. After five years and no stories, Nawab comes across an unconventional muse, Meenaxi (Tabu). The three cities referred to in the title are Hyderabad, Jaisalmer and Prague. The film features an acclaimed score and soundtrack by A.R.Rahman.\n\nIt is semi-autobiographical in some respects. There are allusions to Husain's own experiences with his muse, Madhuri Dixit, with whom he made his previous film, \"Gaja Gamini\" (2000). The film was screened in the Marché du Film section of the 2005 Cannes Film Festival.\n\nNawab, a popular Hyderabadi novelist, is suffering from a classic case of writer's block. Five years have passed, and stories of substance seem to have dried up. Then, almost providentially, Nawab comes across a young woman named Meenaxi. She's enigmatic and individualistic – and not quite willing to perform the part of a passive muse. But that doesn't deter a rejuvenated Nawab from giving her different personae – she can be the mysterious perfume trader of Hyderabad, the exotic desert bloom of Jaisalmer or the orphaned Maria of Prague. Inexorably, she consolidates her command over the novelist. She dismisses his renewed attempts at writing as insubstantial and hackneyed, plunging him into a state of deeper despair. She is scathingly critical about his story and is amused by one of his characters, the lovelorn and awkward Kameshwar. Finally, as Nawab strives on a new page all over again, Meenaxi comments that perhaps the book is in vain. In any case, it is much too late. The writer must survive and live, if he can, without her support, inspiration and criticism.\n\n\nA.R. Rahman has composed the music on lyrics written by Rahat Indori, M. F. Husain, and Sukhwinder Singh. The music for \"Meenaxi\" was released on 24 January 2004 creating great controversies regarding the song \"Noor-Un-Ala\" which had lyrics directly adapted from the Quran. The soundtrack of the movie got high appreciations from the critics. Rahman composed some of his career best songs for it. The background score was also composed by Rahman. Rahman goes completely into Qawwali rhythms for Hyderabad, a rustic, earthy, Arabic rhythms for Jaisalmer and a rich lavish strings for Prague and brings out the essence and cultures of the three cities through his enticing scores.\n\nThe initial lines of \"Chinnamma Chilakamma\" give a feel of Telugu peppy number, but as Sukhwinder Singh picks up his lines, a Hyderabadi accent is revealed. The lyrics are penned by Sukhwinder Singh. \"Rang Hai\" is like a rustic mysterious cry of a woman. Alka Yagnik is the main vocalist whilst Lebanese singer Dallinda provided additional vocals. \"Dhuan Dhuan\" is a sultry and seductive number sung by Asha Bhonsle. Additional vocals is by Kunal and percussions by Rahman's usual associate Sivamani. A.R. Rahman said about recording of this song at the filmfare: \"For one song, we started with no tune and no lyrics either. One afternoon I bumped into Lataji and Ashaji in London. I asked Ashaji if she'd do a song with me the next day. She had to go to Scotland the next day. But she returned in a few days and we finished the track \"Dhuan Dhuan\" in four hours in London.\" \"Yeh Rishta\" is a melody sung by Reena Bhardwaj who has previously worked with Rahman in a chartbuster song for the Tamil movie \"Baba\". It was later reused by Rahman in the Tamil movie \"Sakkarakatti\" as \"Naan Epodhu\" with the same singer which then became a chartbuster. It was picturised as Tabu's solo entrance piece in the film. \"Do Kadam\" is highly regarded as one of Rahman's best compositions. This song is sung by Sonu Nigam with lyrics provided by Rahat Indori. \"Planetbollywood\" referred to this song as the best from Sonu Nigam. The controversial song \"Noor-Un-Ala-Noor\" is a Sufi style song sung by Murtaza Khan and Qadir Khan, together called Khan brothers. Lyrics for the song was by M. F. Hussain which slightly adapted the Quranic verses honourung Allah to honour the lead character Meenaxi. M. F. Hussain wrote in \"The Hindu\" about this song, \"There is a qawwali written by me and sung by classical musicians Ustad Ghulam Mustafa and his son for which Rahman has tuned unusual music. The film opens with this qawwali, the picturisation of which is a major highlight...The qawwali is exultant about the presence of the light and what a light it is! It is a Sufi thought, a thought that keep us going even when there is pitch darkness.\"\n\n\"Cyclist's Rhythm\" and \"Potter's Village\" were instrumentals composed by A. R. Rahman with percussions by Sivamani and flute by Navin Kumar in the former and percussions by Hossam Ramzy and strings by John Themis in the latter.\n\nThe soundtrack for \"Meenaxi\" has received positive reviews from critics and fans. Since the film bombed at the box office due to controversies created, the soundtrack, too, remained unnoticed. But the tracks such as \"Yeh Rishta\" and \"Chinnamma Chillakkamma\" became chartbusters when they were reused in the 2008 Tamil movie \"Sakkarakatti\".\n\nThe audio was released on 24 January 2004 creating controversy regarding the song \"Noor-Un-Ala\" which had lyrics directly taken from the Quran. The movie was pulled from cinemas a day after some Muslim organisations raised objections to the song. The All-India Ulema Council complained that the Qawwali song was blasphemous. The council was supported by Muslim organisations like the Milli Council, All-India Muslim Council, Raza Academy, Jamiat-ul-Ulema-e-Hind and Jamat-e-Islami. Husain's son stated that the words were a phrase referring to divine beauty that were being sung for the central character played by Tabu. He said there was no intention to offend. Following the wave of protests the enraged artist pulled his movie from theatres.\n\n"}
{"id": "1795286", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1795286", "title": "Bragança District", "text": "Bragança District\n\nBragança District ( ; ) is a traditional political division of Portugal, in the northeast corner bordering on Spain (Castile and Leon and Galicia) , covering 7.4% of the nation's continental landmass. The capital of the district, Bragança, is from Porto, the second largest town in Portugal, from the Spanish town of Zamora and from Salamanca, also in Spain. Bragança is administratively divided in twelve municipalities and 299 parishes located in the north-eastern part of Trás-os-Montes. , the total resident population was approximately 136,252. It is bordered by Spain (Castile and Leon and Galicia) in the north and northeast, Vila Real District in the west, Viseu District in the southwest and Guarda District in the south.\n\nDuring the Roman era, the territory was part of the much larger province of Gallaecia, dependent administratively on Astorga and the gold, iron and silver trade route. Although names similar to Bragança appeared around 666 B.C. (Wamba) or 569 A.D. (Council of Lugo), a territory identifiable as \"Bragança\" only appeared after the Celts who baptised one of their main settlements \"Brigantia\", in the second century, which was later Latinized to \"Bragança\". But this settlement was limited.\n\nThe region's name was derived from the traditional feudal history of the northern region: the Bragançãos family of Castro de Avelãs were the basis of this lineage that included Fernão Mendes, who later married the Infanta Sancha (daughter of Afonso Henriques), inheriting the region on the death of the King. The Bragançãos would maintain their hold on the region until 1258, when Afonso III transferred the title to Nuno Martins, but the name \"Braganção\" would continue to influence the region. Eventually, the King Afonso V established the Dukedom of the \"Duchy of Braganza\" for his uncle, Afonso, Count of Barcelos to strengthen the ties of the crown to the land. When the royal House of Braganza ascended to the throne of Portugal (through John IV), the significance of \"Bragança\", as the hereditary seat of the Kings and Emperors of Portugal was sealed.\n\nThe district of Bragança was constituted upon the creation of the district system on 25 April 1835; a creation of the Liberal government, it was inspired by the French \"départements\", with the objective to \"\"facilitate the action of government...and permit access to the authorities\"\". The establishment of the districts was primarily done to counteract the centralizing tendencies of the governmental authority.\n\nThe district is composed of two distinct regions described in terms of its geographic differences: the northern areas, with the higher altitudes constitute the \"Terra Fria Transmontana\" (\"Cold lands\"), and the Alto Trás-os-Montes, where the landscape is dominated gentler slopes of the plateau; and the southern areas, the \"Terra Quente Trasmontana\" (\"Hot Lands\"), where the climate is milder, marked by the valleys of the Douro River and its tributaries. Its area allows a wide diversity of landscapes, and the district is known for its climatic differences (nine months of winter and three of heat), its rugged geomorphology, an aging population and urban to rural migration of its residents over time.\n\nIt is the Douro River that characterizes the geography, dividing the borders within the district, its southern frontier and extreme northeast borders with Spain. It is in the Douro valley that the lowlands of the district are primarily located, although almost all are 400 metres above sea level, with the exception of the municipality of Mirandela and its rivers. In addition to the Douro, the rivers of the district run north to south (or northeast to southwest) within the Douro watershed. The principal rivers are the Tua River, which springs from the mountains of Mirandela, at the confluence of Tuela and Rabaçal Rivers, and the Sabor River, which springs in Spain, and crosses the eastern part of the district. Both rivers have a network of tributaries, such as the Baceiro River (feeding the Tuela), the Mente River (serving the Rabaçal), and the Azibo River (supporting the Sabor).\n\nThe mountain ranges divide these water courses: the Serra da Nogueira (approximately 1320 metres) separates the Tuela and Sabor valleys; more to the south, the Serra de Bornes (1199 metres), in the municipalities of Macedo de Cavaleiros and Alfândega da Fé separate the Tua and Sabor Rivers; to the east, the columns of the Serra do Mogadouro (997 metres) separate the Sabor and Douro; and in the north, at the border with Spain, the largest mountains in the region the Serra da Coroa (1274 metres), north of Vinhais, and the Serra de Montesinho (1400 metres) at the frontier, shield the Spanish autonomous communities from Portugal. A major part of the dams in the district are located along the Douro; the Valeira, Pocinho, Saucelle, Aldeadávila, Bemposta, Picote and Miranda Dams, along the main river, and the Azibo, Nuzedo de Baixo and Rebordelo, along its tributaries.\n\nBragança includes several natural sanctuaries, such as the \"Parque Natural de Montesinho\", the \"Parque Natural do Douro Internacional\", and the \"Paisagem Protegida da Albufeira do Azibo\", oasises in the northwest part of the peninsula.\n\nConsisting of twelve municipalities, the district of Bragança is the fifth largest district of Portugal: \n\nOne of 18 Portuguese districts, this administrative division serves to define electoral units for proportional representation in national elections; administrative centres for police, courts and other public orders; and some local offices of ministries. Although Bragança has a Civil Governor, nominated by the Ministry of Home Affairs (), his/her role is limited to issues of public security, and local governance.\n\nSummary of election results from the district of Bragança (1976–2019)\n!rowspan=2|Parties!!%!!S!!%!!S!!%!!S!!%!!S!!%!!S!!%!!S!!%!!S!!%!!S!!%!!S!!%!!S!!%!!S!!%!!S!!%!!S!!%!!S!!%!!S\n!colspan=2 | 1976\n!colspan=2 | 1979\n!colspan=2 | 1980\n!colspan=2 | 1983\n!colspan=2 | 1985\n!colspan=2 | 1987\n!colspan=2 | 1991\n!colspan=2 | 1995\n!colspan=2 | 1999\n!colspan=2 | 2002\n!colspan=2 | 2005\n!colspan=2 | 2009\n!colspan=2 | 2011\n!colspan=2 | 2015\n!colspan=2 | 2019\n!

Local gastronomy, which includes Mirandês beef, embutidos, lamb, sheep and poultry, \"cascas com casulos\", trout, the bread, cheese and honey, as well as a range of sweets and pastries, are rich representations of this zone. Unlike tourism in central Portugal, the region is sought for its unspoiled nature and rural tourism; its agrarian lifestyle, although an important part of its enchantment, supports the local population, primarily in cattle-raising, dairy production and cultivation of rye and wheat.\n\nIn the urban areas, particularly the municipal seats, the primary economic activities predominate, including the public-sector institutions, commerce and industry.\n\nThe difficulty in communication and interconnection between markets was always a problem in this region, resulting in few investments and economic development. Tourism still remains the sector of the economy that has potential to improve development, and fix a transient population.\n\nLeonese language was widely spoken in the territory, but today, there are few who speak the language (which is primarily concentrated in the communities near Rio de Onor, Guadramil and along the northeast to southeast frontier with Spain). Mirandese, a local variant, is commonly observed in the regions of the District, particularly around Miranda do Douro, and has resulted in its official recognition by the Portuguese Parliament.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1795292", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1795292", "title": "Vila Real District", "text": "Vila Real District\n\nThe District of Vila Real ( ) is a district of northern Portugal. With an area of 4,239 km², the district is located east of the port city of Porto and north of the Douro River. Vila Real has always belonged to the historical province of Trás-os-Montes. Approximate population in the 2001 census was 230,000. The population has shown negative rates in recent years due to emigration and aging. Many of the villages have lost population and have become deserted while the district capital has gained in population. It is bordered by Spain (Galicia) in the north and east, Braga District and Porto District in the west, Viseu District in the south and Bragança District in the east.\n\nVila Real is a rugged area of low mountains and narrow valleys. Historically it had always been cut off from the coast by the Marão, Gerês, and Cabreira mountains until a highway was cut through in the eighties. Due to poor soil, agriculture has always been a struggle, although wine grapes are produced in the south near the Douro River. Potatoes, corn, and rye have always been the traditional crops, as well as limited dairy farming. Extensive areas are covered in pine forest. Granite and the manufacture of mineral water—the waters of Vidago and Pedras Salgadas are nationally famous—are two important industries.\n\nThere was formerly a narrow gauge railway (the Corgo line) which linked the town of Vila Real with Peso da Régua on the Douro River. Until 1990 the railway reached as far north as Chaves. The remaining, southern part of the Corgo line closed in 2009.\n\nThe largest towns are all very small, when compared to provincial capitals in neighboring Spain. When we talk about population of urban centers two figures are used in Portugal, one number for the concelho or municipality, which can be as large as 1,720.6 km² (Odemira in the district of Beja) or as small as 8.11 km² (São João da Madeira in the district of Aveiro), and another number for the main urban center itself. Often it is difficult to determine which parishes make up the urban center and which make up the rest of the concelho. Official census figures give populations of concelhos and not urban centers, so this can be misleading. Often the head of the municipality can be relatively small with most of the population residing in rural parishes. Chaves, for example has 12,000 in the urban parishes (2) and 29,000 in 49 rural parishes for a total municipality population of 41,000.\n\nIn order of population, Vila Real capital has roughly 25,000 in the urban parishes, Chaves 12,000, followed by Valpaços, Peso da Régua, and the other seats of concelhos, all of which have fewer than 10,000 inhabitants.\n\nThe population density of the district is sparse, 54 people per square kilometer. Most of this population lives in the concelhos of the south—Vila Real, Santa Marta, Régua, Sabroso, and Alijó. The area between the district capital and the Douro river is especially more densely populated, with Régua having a population density of 212 per km², and Santa Marta with 128. There is a relatively populated area east of the capital. North the population clusters follow the Corgo river valley with many small villages on the river valley or veiga south of Vila Pouca. The geological fault linking Vila Pouca with Chaves is also quite populated. Then north and south of Chaves population density increases (68 per km²). The area to the west—the Barroso—or to the east—Serra do Brunheiro is sparsely inhabited. Montalegre has a population density of 22 per km², although the number of small villages scattered across the area gives a different impression. A closer look shows that many of the houses are no longer lived in and many have been abandoned.\n\nMuch of this population still lives in villages, many of which have fewer than 100 inhabitants. Over seventy-five percent of the population in fact lives in centers with fewer than 5,000 people, which is the cutoff point for urbanization. If we take the total population of 230,000 in 1991 and single out the largest centers with more than 10,000 people—Chaves, and Vila Real—whose total population is under 30,000, we can see that over seventy five percent of the population is rural or semi-rural. \nThis lack of middle-sized urban centers in the province is a reflection of the loss of population of the region as a whole over the last twenty years, due to lack of job possibilities. It also means that the Transmontano still has a rural lifestyle and all that this implies in cultural habits, including outlook towards education, innovation in business, and acceptance of different ideas.\n\nThe district is composed of 14 municipalities:\n\n\nSummary of election results from Vila Real district, 1976-2019\n!rowspan=2|Parties!!%!!S!!%!!S!!%!!S!!%!!S!!%!!S!!%!!S!!%!!S!!%!!S!!%!!S!!%!!S!!%!!S!!%!!S!!%!!S!!%!!S!!%!!S\n!colspan=2 | 1976\n!colspan=2 | 1979\n!colspan=2 | 1980\n!colspan=2 | 1983\n!colspan=2 | 1985\n!colspan=2 | 1987\n!colspan=2 | 1991\n!colspan=2 | 1995\n!colspan=2 | 1999\n!colspan=2 | 2002\n!colspan=2 | 2005\n!colspan=2 | 2009\n!colspan=2 | 2011\n!colspan=2 | 2015\n!colspan=2 | 2019\n!

{"id": "1795295", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1795295", "title": "Meton of Athens", "text": "Meton of Athens\n\nMeton of Athens (; \"gen\".: Μέτωνος) was a Greek mathematician, astronomer, geometer, and engineer who lived in Athens in the 5th century BC. He is best known for calculations involving the eponymous 19-year Metonic cycle which he introduced in 432 BC into the lunisolar Attic calendar. Euphronios says that Colonus was Meton's deme.\n\nThe metonic calendar incorporates knowledge that 19 solar years and 235 lunar months are very nearly of the same duration. Consequently, a given day of a lunar month will often occur on the same day of the solar year as it did 19 years previously. Meton's observations were made in collaboration with Euctemon, about whom nothing else is known. The Greek astronomer Callippus expanded on the work of Meton, proposing what is now called the Callippic cycle. A Callippic cycle runs for 76 years, or four Metonic cycles. Callippus refined the lunisolar calendar, deducting one day from the fourth Metonic cycle in each Callippic cycle (i.e., after 940 synodic lunar periods had elapsed), so as to better keep the lunisolar calendar synchronized with the seasons of the solar year.\n\nThe world's oldest known astronomical calculator, the Antikythera Mechanism (2nd century BC), performs calculations based on both the Metonic and Callipic calendar cycles, with separate dials for each.\n\nThe foundations of Meton's observatory in Athens are still visible just behind the podium of the Pnyx, the ancient parliament. Meton found the dates of equinoxes and solstices by observing sunrise from his observatory. From that point of observation, during the summer solstice, sunrise was in line with the local hill of Mount Lycabetus, while six months later, during the winter solstice, sunrise occurs over the high brow of Mount Hymettos in the southeast. So from Meton's observatory the Sun appears to move along a 60° arc between these two points on the horizon every six months. The bisector of the observatory's solstitial arc lies in line with the Acropolis. These topological features are important because the summer solstice was the point in time from which the Athenians measured the start of their calendar years. The first month of the new year, Hekatombaion, began with the first new moon after the summer solstice.\n\nMeton appears briefly as a character in Aristophanes' play \"The Birds\" (414 BC). He comes on stage carrying surveying instruments and is described as a geometer.\n\nWhat little is known about Meton is related by ancient historians. According to Ptolemy, a stela or table erected in Athens contained a record of Meton's observations, and a description of the Metonic cycle. None of Meton's works survive.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1795303", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1795303", "title": "Water (1985 film)", "text": "Water (1985 film)\n\nWater is a 1985 British comedy film directed by Dick Clement and starring Michael Caine. It was scripted by Clement and Ian La Frenais.\n\nThe story is set in the fictional Caribbean island and British colony of Cascara. Widely ignored by the British Government, media, and general public, local Governor Baxter Thwaites is having an easy life in his small and peaceful colony. That peace is disturbed when an abandoned oil rig starts delivering water - at the standard of the finest table water brands (and laxative companies, as it contains a substance that makes you \"shit like clockwork\"). Different parties, including Downing Street, the Cascara Liberation Front, the White House, French bottled water producers, and Cuban guerrillas take interest in the future of the island and threaten to destroy the cosy way of life enjoyed by the island's inhabitants.\n\nThe plot spoofs some elements of the comedies \"Carlton-Browne of the F.O.\" (1958) and \"Passport to Pimlico\" (1948) and the then-recent invasions of the Falkland Islands and Grenada.\n\nThe film stars Caine as Baxter Thwaites, a Governor who has 'gone native' (similarly to his role in \"The Honorary Consul\"), and Billy Connolly as local biracial activist Delgado, supported by the last performance of Leonard Rossiter, as Sir Malcolm Leveridge, and one of the last performances of Fulton Mackay.\n\n\nThe film is largely set on the fictional island of Cascara. In the film an oil well is re-opened and discovered to have mineral water with a 'slight laxative effect'. The island's name itself is a play on this as Cascara is the name of a plant (scientific name Rhamnus purshiana) which has laxative properties.\n\nThe film was one of three movies that HandMade Films intended to shoot in 1984, the others being \"A Private Function\" and a comedy from John MacKenzie, \"The Travelling Man\" (which ultimately would not be made). It was written by the experienced comedy duo Ian La Frenais and Dick Clement, who had just made \"Bullshot\" (1983) for HandMade.\n\nLe Frenais and Clement had made a television pilot in the USA with Bill Persky who came up with the idea of a fictional British colony in the Caribbean which sought independence. The three of them wrote a screenplay which Persky wanted to direct (he had made the film \"Serial\" (1980)) but they were unable to raise finance. Then when Clement and Le Frenais made \"Bullshot\" for Handmade they showed the script to Dennis O'Brien, head of the studio. \"It was Denis who absolutely loved the script and really responded to it and said, 'Let's do it',\" said Clement.\n\nClement and Le Frenais wrote another draft of the script and sent it to Michael Caine, who loved it and wanted to make the film. Clement says, \"We were thrilled because we knew that meant we would get the film made, and suddenly it was a go project.\"\n\n\"I guess it was like an Ealing film,\" said Clement, \"but it was not a conscious effort to recreate that style. I can see the analogies with something like \"Passport to Pimlico\".\"\n\nDenis O'Brien liked to use members of Monty Python in HandMade films and offered the role of Sir Malcolm Leveridge to John Cleese. Cleese read the script and turned it down; Leonard Rossiter played the role instead, in what turned out to be Rossiter's last film.\n\nThe movie started filming in May 1984. The same month \"A Private Function\" also went into production and people who worked on that film felt their budget was sacrificed in order to fund \"Water\".\n\nShooting took place mostly on Saint Lucia. There were few filmmaking facilities so items had to be shipped there by sea. Studio work was done at Shepperton Studios in London and the oil rig scenes were shot in Devon.\n\nAt the time Billy Connolly was an emerging comedian, much admired by Denis O'Brien. \"They were always trying to put him into a movie because Denis was convinced that Billy Connolly was the funniest man in Britain,\" said Clement. \"He was way ahead of the pack there.\" O'Brien insisted that Connolly be in \"Bullshot\" and \"Water\". \"He was actually cast before anybody else,\" said Clement.\n\nBilly Connolly later recalled the making of the movie. \"We went to Heathrow to fly out, and fly out we did. Not knowing that - there were no mobile phones then of course - they were racing up to tell us not to go. That the money had fallen through. But by the time the plane landed in Saint Lucia, they'd got the money again!\"\n\nThe BBC television presenter Paul Heiney had a small part in the film as part of the \"In At The Deep End\" series.\n\nDick Clement later said, \"We were rewriting the ending as we went along and that's never good... In hindsight, I always think you need to get those decisions out of the way before you get on the set. But, on the whole, it was a good shoot. Michael Caine was a fantastic trouper on the film, he was really a joy to work with, enormously supportive. I can’t be more appreciative of his work on it and how professional he was. In a way, Michael had the straightest part in the film, he was almost the straight man. He kept saying to me, 'You realise I'm having to carry all the plot here?'\"\n\nConnolly said Caine \"taught me so much, about how to be generous to other actors. We were climbing up a hill and we were being filmed from the top. Suddenly he went, oh! My leg! And he spoiled a whole take. So they said we're doing it again, and he whispered to me 'next time, move further to the right, they can't see you'. He was lovely.\"\n\nGeorge Harrison normally did not get too involved in production of HandMade's films. However he helped out on \"Water\" by appearing in the concert at the end and getting his friends Eric Clapton and Ringo Starr to appear. \"George was very leery of appearing in his own company's movies,\" says Clement, \"that was a big help to the film. We called in a few favours and, obviously, the Harrison connection didn't hurt. We hoped that scene would be a big selling tool for the movie... didn't work out that way but it was a good idea.\"\n\nThe concert scene was shot in a single day at Shepperton Studios. Clapton, Starr and Harrison were paid the musician's minimum rate for a playback session on set.\n\nThe soundtrack principally featured reggae music by Eddy Grant and was released by Ariston Records.\n\nThe Singing Rebel's Band consists of Eric Clapton, George Harrison, Ray Cooper, Jon Lord, Mike Moran, Chris Stainton and Ringo Starr, with backing singers Jenny Bogle and Anastasia Rodriguez. It spoofs The Concert for Bangladesh organised by Harrison in 1971.\n\nThe film was released in London in January 1985. It was briefly in the top ten box office listing - along with \"A Private Function\" - but soon dropped out. It failed to recoup its costs and could not find an American distributor. When it was released there in April 1986 it failed at the box office there too.\n\nThe film received a mixed review in the \"New York Times,\" which read in part \"The folks who packaged this put-on operated on the theory that a lot of eccentric people doing nutty things produce hilarity. The ingredient missing from the fitfully amusing conglomeration of characters is a character for the whole. In kidding everything, the movie leaves us uncertain about whether anything is being seriously kidded.\"\n\nThe \"Los Angeles Times\" called it \"so refreshingly funny that you're tempted to forgive its tendency to run dry in its last half hour... boasts some of the wittiest lines heard on screen since \"A Private Function\".\"\n\nDick Clement later reflected:\nI'm happier with \"Bullshot\" than I am with \"Water\". I think \"Water\" just misses. I feel it's not quite connecting in the right way. I look back on it and I'm fairly uncomfortable. For me I always did have a problem with fictional countries or places, I always like things rooted a little bit more in reality. I have a feeling that kind of thing works perhaps in fiction, but I always find that film is a very literal medium, you've got to sell stuff on the screen and I think it was larger than life in a way that isn't quite comfortable on screen and I don't think I pulled it off... And again in hindsight as much as I love Billy Connolly I think a black guy in that part would have been better. I think that would've helped the credibility of making it a Caribbean island.\nMichael Palin later said the financial failure of the film \"was a bit of a turning point in HandMade Films, that \"Water\" was such a disaster and yet so much money was put into it. Somehow the luck ran out because judgement up to that time had been pretty good.\"\n\n\"Water\" was first released on home video by Paramount Home Video on 1 February 1987. The film received its first DVD edition in North America in 2006, courtesy of Anchor Bay Entertainment.\n\n"}

She rose to fame with the release of her 1999 single from her second album \"Screamin' for My Supper\". The single was a number one hit in New Zealand, as well as reaching the top 5 of the US Adult Contemporary and Top 10 on the \"Billboard\" Adult Top 40 charts.\n\nThe albums \"Seesaw\" and \"Live in Amsterdam\" by Hart and Joe Bonamassa debuted at number 1 on the Billboard Blues Album Chart, a chart she has now topped six times. Hart has had two number 1 singles in Denmark, \"As Good as It Gets\" and \"Learning to Live\", as well a double platinum-selling album, \"Leave the Light On\".\n\nHart's first album with Bonamassa, \"Don't Explain\", went gold in the Netherlands, while their 2014 collaboration \"Seesaw\" was nominated for a Grammy Award, and gave Hart her first Blues Music Award nomination in the category 'Best Contemporary Blues Female Artist'.\n\nHart was born and raised in Los Angeles, California. As a 4-year-old, she began to play piano. At first, she concentrated on classical works by Bach and Beethoven, but as she grew older, she also began to play pieces by artists such as Etta James, Otis Redding and Led Zeppelin.\n\nRegarding her childhood in an interview with Don Wilcock, Hart stated, \"When I was a kid, my dad left me in a bad way, and what fucked me up the most was that he would be in the lives of my other sisters and brothers, but he wouldn't be in mine.\" At the age of 20, Hart lost her sister from complications of AIDS.\n\nHart entered L.A.'s High School for the Performing Arts in 10th grade as a vocal and cello major. At the prompting of a classmate, she soon began singing during open mic nights in the Belly Room of the Comedy Store.\n\nHart began playing clubs in Hollywood at the age of 15, and eventually enlisted bassist Tal Herzberg and guitarist Jimmy Khoury for \"Beth Hart and the Ocean of Souls\", which was recorded in 1993. It includes \"Am I the One\" (which later appeared on her first official record \"Immortal\") and a pop-rock cover of the Beatles' \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\". The first released album with the Beth Hart Band, \"Immortal\", was released in 1996 through Atlantic, scanning 13,000 copies and featured the single \"God Bless You\". It also included \"Am I the One\", a fan favorite that ended up on her first DVD that was released in 2005. After touring the record, including at Lollapalooza in 1996, the Beth Hart Band disbanded due to infighting.\n\nIn 1993, Hart appeared on Ed McMahon's \"Star Search\", ultimately winning the Female Vocalist competition. Hart has stated that winning the show did not land her a record deal due to the stigma associated with performing on the show, and that she had burned through the prize money she received by the time she struck a deal with Atlantic Records.\n\nHart's debut solo album, \"Screamin' for My Supper\" was released in 1999, and featured \"LA Song (Out of This Town)\", a No. 1 hit in New Zealand, as well as a Top 10 Adult Contemporary chart hit in the US. The song also aired during Episode 17 of the 10th and final season of \"Beverly Hills, 90210\". At the same time, Hart was singing the lead role in \"Love, Janis\", an off-Broadway musical based on Joplin's letters home to her mother.\n\nHart's follow-up album, \"Leave the Light On\", was released in 2003 via Koch Records, after being dropped by Atlantic presumably due to Hart's drug addiction. While still successful in New Zealand, the album saw her breakthrough in the European market, with the single \"Learning to Live\" reaching number 1 in Denmark, while the album achieved a 2x Platinum certification. \"Learning to Live\" was also used as the theme song to \"Losing It with Jillian\" on NBC. In 2003, she became the first and only musician to feature as backing vocalist for a Deep Purple song (\"Haunted\", released on the Bananas album).\n\nTwo years later in 2005, Hart released her first live album, \"Live at Paradiso\", which was recorded at a former church in Amsterdam, and released both as a CD and a DVD. It featured a variety of Hart's self written songs and a cover of \"Whole Lotta Love\" by \"Led Zeppelin\". Hart appears on Toots Thielemans' album \"One More For the Road\" on the track \"I Gotta Right To Sing The Blues\", which was released in 2006.\n\nHart's fourth solo studio album \"37 Days\" was released in Europe in July 2007, and eventually as a DVD as well. The album debuted at No. 1 in Denmark and spent two weeks at the top, her first album to top a national chart, and additionally reached a Gold certification in the country. The record was her last on a major label (Universal), though it solidified her European commercial success.\n\nHer fifth solo studio album \"My California\" was released in 2010, and was her first on Provogue Records. Hart delivered music to the end-scene of the last episode of season 6 of \"Californication\", with the title song of this record \"My California\". On August 23, 2012, her song \"Take It Easy on Me\" from \"My California\" was used in the first episode of the eighth series of the BBC TV drama \"Waterloo Road\". On July 31, 2012, the album was released in the United States. On the same date, she released an EP titled \"Introducing Beth Hart\".\n\nDuring this time, Hart collaborated with Slash on \"Mother Maria\", released on the iTunes version of Slash's 2010 solo album, \"Slash\", and additionally collaborated with rapper Born on his single \"It Hurts\", released in February 2012. Following her tour with Jeff Beck in 2006 through the United States, she appeared with him again in December 2012, at the Kennedy Center Opera House, along with a group of blues/rock musicians, performing \"I'd Rather Go Blind\" in tribute to Buddy Guy, who received a 2012 Kennedy Center Honor for his lifetime of contributions to American culture. The performance received a standing ovation from President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama, and led to the collaboration with Buddy Guy, where he recorded the song \"What You Gonna Do About Me\" with Beth Hart for his album \"Rhythm & Blues\".\n\nIn 2011, Hart collaborated with blues guitarist Joe Bonamassa on their first co-release \"Don't Explain\", an album of blues classics. The album reached number 3 on the Billboard Blues Album Chart and also went gold in the Netherlands. She additionally provided vocals for the track \"No Love on the Street\" on Bonamassa's \"Dust Bowl\", which was released the same year.\n\nThe following year, Hart's release \"Bang Bang Boom Boom\" became one of her biggest commercial successes, appearing on the charts of at least 10 countries, as well as becoming her first to chart on the \"Billboard\" Blues Album Chart, climbing to Number 3. She worked with producer Kevin Shirley, whom she collaborated with for the first time on the album \"Don't Explain\". The album was released the following year in the United States.\n\nIn 2013, the duo Beth Hart and Joe Bonamassa released \"Seesaw\", again produced by Kevin Shirley. The album rose to number 8 on the Billboard Top Independent Album Chart. In 2014 Hart was nominated for a Grammy Award for \"Seesaw\" and she was also nominated for a Blues Music Award in the category 'Best Contemporary Blues Female Artist'. The album additionally holds her highest peak position on the Billboard 200, reaching the Top 50.\n\nHart's second live album/DVD, Live in Amsterdam, was also recorded in Amsterdam, Netherlands, this time at the Royal Carre Theatre. Hart and Joe Bonamassa went on a mini European tour of five shows (Bergen, Norway - London, UK - Antwerp, Belgium - Amsterdam, Netherlands), of which two were at the Carre Theatre. Both nights were recorded and released on the DVD/LP/CD \"Live in Amsterdam\" in 2014.\n\nIn 2014, she performed with Jeff Beck during his Australian tour as a supporting act, in addition to joining him on stage during his set.\n\nHart's seventh solo studio album \"Better Than Home\", was released on April 13, 2015 in Europe and on the following day in the US. The recording process was \"painful\" for Hart: the album was produced by Michael Stevens, whose cancer diagnosis pressured Hart into completing the recording of the album in just five days. In addition to this, she entered a psych ward twice while making the album. Nevertheless, the lead single \"Mechanical Heart\" charted at number 1 in the \"iTunes Blues\" song list, and the album entered the album charts in the Netherlands at number 1. In the USA the album entered both the Billboard Blues Charts and iTunes Blues Charts at number 1. The album also charted in other countries: number 11 in Germany and 33 in the UK. On January 29, 2016, Hart and Jeff Beck released the single \"Tell Her You Belong To Me\" worldwide on iTunes, after performing the song live on \"Jools' Annual Hootenanny\" in 2015/2016 on BBC Two. They also performed \"Nutbush City Limits\" on the show as well. At the end of 2015, Mojo magazine ranked the album as the fourth best blues album of the year, while Hart appeared as one of the narrators for the documentary film \"Unity\".\n\nHart released her eighth studio album, \"Fire on the Floor\", on October 14, 2016, in Europe, New Zealand and Australia. For the rest of the world it was released on February 3, 2017, to coincide with her tour. Hart wrote all songs herself, except for \"Let's Get Together\" (with Rune Westberg) and \"Fat Man\" (with Glen Burtnik). The title track was released first followed by \"Love Is a Lie\", which is the official first single off the album.\n\nOn January 26, 2018, Beth Hart and Joe Bonamassa released \"Black Coffee\", again produced by Kevin Shirley. The album debuted at number 1 on the US Blues Chart, and also in the Dutch album top 100.\n\nOn November 30, 2018, Hart released a live concert recording, \"Live at the Royal Albert Hall\", as a live album and as a video release on Provogue Records/Mascot Label Group. The recordings were captured in May 2018 when she performed at the Royal Albert Hall.\n\nHart released her ninth solo studio album, \"War in My Mind\", on September 27, 2019, through Provogue/Mascot Label Group.\n\nHart is known for her \"visceral\", \"gritty\", \"soaring\" and \"dynamic\" contralto vocals. Hart is not only a versatile vocalist, she also plays piano, guitar, cello, bass guitar and percussion.\n\nDescribing his collaborator's performance at Blues Ball Festival in Switzerland, Joe Bonamassa told Music Radar: \"I was totally knocked out by Beth. Here's this lady who's acting like I'm the cool one, and meanwhile I'm thinking, Man, she's got it all. She's the new Janis Joplin, Tina Turner - the real deal, you know?\"\n\nHart is married to her road manager Scott Guetzkow, and currently resides in Los Angeles. Her manager is David Wolff. Hart has struggled with drug addiction and bi-polar disorder, but has taken control of her life and medical issues through religion and practicing transcendental meditation.\n\nAt the 56th Annual Grammy Awards, Hart received a nomination for Best Blues Album with \"Seesaw\", ultimately losing to Ben Harper and Charlie Musselwhite's \"Get Up!\". Hart has been nominated at the Blues Music Awards for five consecutive years, ultimately winning the \"Instrumentalist - Vocals\" category in 2018.\n\n"}

This code uses an \"Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian\" (ALE) formulation on an unstructured mesh, allowing one to designate whether material should flow through a stationary mesh (pure Eulerian), whether the mesh should move with the material (pure Lagrangian), or whether the mesh should be allowed to move independently of the material motion (arbitrary). The arbitrary formulation permits a simulation to proceed in Lagrangian fashion until the mesh becomes too highly distorted. Points in the most deformed regions of the mesh are then repositioned to reduce the distortion to acceptable levels. This reduces the overall computational expense of a purely Lagrangian approach while being more accurate than the traditional Eulerian method.\n"}

It provides scheduled air service to 27 destinations in Asia, including China, Japan, Korea, Cambodia, Vietnam, U.S. Territories, Taiwan and Thailand. The airline's main hub at Hong Kong International Airport uses a fleet that consists exclusively of the Airbus A320 family. In 2016, the airline became a founding member of the U-FLY Alliance.\n\nThe head office of HK Express is located at One Citygate in Tung Chung, Lantau.\n\nHong Kong Express Airways Limited was incorporated on 10 March 2004, with the former Chinese name (), added on 21 April 2004. The airline was owned by Macau casino entrepreneur Stanley Ho. In July 2004, Hong Kong's helicopter operator Heli Hong Kong officially announced plans to commence fixed-wing operation via Hong Kong Express, to become Hong Kong's fourth passenger airline. It was planning to introduce regional jet services to secondary cities in mainland China and was in negotiations with Bombardier and Embraer for the lease of several 50- or 70-seat regional jets. In April 2005, the airline was granted permission to transport passengers, cargo and mail from Hong Kong to selected destinations in China and permitted to apply for traffic rights to serve 15 Chinese cities. The next month, it received approval to operate scheduled air services to five cities in China, including Chongqing, Guangzhou, Hangzhou, Nanjing and Ningbo. The airline had its Air Operator's Certificate varied in July 2005 for the operation of Embraer 170 aircraft. The same month, it took delivery of its first of four 76-seat twin-jet Embraer 170, leased from General Electric Commercial Aviation Services (GECAS), and became the Asian launch operator of this regional jet. Two more aircraft were delivered in 2005, with the remaining delivered in May 2006.\n\nThe airline's initial use of its first Embraer 170 was on charter services to Taichung, Taiwan, on 3 September 2005. \nThe first scheduled passenger services began to Guangzhou on 8 September 2005, with services to Hangzhou and Ningbo following in October 2005 and December 2005, respectively. On 19 November 2005, Hong Kong Air Transport Licensing Authority (ATLA) granted the airline additional licences to operate scheduled services to 16 destinations in mainland China, as well as Koh Samui, Okinawa, Siem Reap and Taichung. Scheduled passenger services to Chiang Mai and Chongqing were inaugurated on 22 June 2006 and 31 July 2006, respectively.\n\nOn 3 August 2006, HNA Group, the parent company of Hainan Airlines, announced a finalised agreement to acquire a 45 percent stake in Hong Kong Express; this followed an earlier purchase of a 45 percent holdings in CR Airways in June. Under the terms of the agreement, the airline would remain a Hong Kong registered airline and there would be no changes to the current operations. Analysts said that the HNA Group had the weakest international network amongst all the mainland airlines. By purchasing both Hong Kong Express and CR Airways, it would enable Hainan Airlines to expand internationally via its junior partners from Hong Kong.\n\nOn 23 January 2008, the airline was the third Hong Kong carrier permitted by the Civil Aviation Department to operate flights to and from Beijing and Shanghai. To facilitate the expansion, it announced that six Boeing 737-800 would be added to its fleet before the end of the year.\n\nOn 26 June 2013, Hong Kong Express announced its intention to transform into a low-cost carrier (LCC), and renamed to \"HK Express\", under the direction of the deputy CEO Andrew Cowen. Hong Kong Express' first flights as a LCC commenced October 27, 2013, to five destinations in Asia. The airline has since added routes to Tokyo, Penang, Osaka, Fukuoka, Seoul and Busan. There are plans for the airline's fleet to increase by five Airbus A320 in 2014, taking the total number of aircraft to 11 within the year and with a longer term aim of having over 30 Airbus A320 by 2018.\n\nOn 19 July 2017, during the annual Hong Kong Book Fair, HK Express launch an activities planning service known as U-Explore in collaboration with Hong Kong-based travel activities booking platform, Klook.\n\nOn 9 November 2017, HK Express was banned by the Civil Aviation Department from adding new flights, routes or aircraft until 30 April 2018. This followed the cancellation of 18 flights to Osaka, Nagoya and Seoul during National Day Golden Week that year, affecting about 2,000 passengers. However, the delivery of four new aircraft was later permitted, provided they were used on existing routes only.\n\nCathay Pacific executives confirmed in late February 2019 that it was in \"active discussions\" about its interest of a full or partial takeover of HK Express from current owner HNA Group, although an agreement had yet to be reached at the time.\n\nOn 25 March 2019, the \"South China Morning Post\" reported that Cathay Pacific had agreed to buy the airline.\n\nOn 27 March 2019, Cathay Pacific agreed to take over HK Express for HK$4.93 billion (US$628 million), with the transaction to close by the end of 2019. At the time, HK Express operated 23 Airbus A320 aircraft on 25 routes from Hong Kong to Japan and Southeast Asia with a net asset value of HK$1.12 billion, while the airline recorded a profit of HK$60 million in 2017, but recorded a loss of HK$141 million in 2018. The acquisition will be paid with HK$2.25 billion in cash and HK$2.68 billion in promissory loan notes, and HK Express will subsequently withdraw from U-FLY Alliance. By the time the acquisition transaction is completed, HK Express will become Cathay Pacific's wholly owned subsidiary. Following the acquisition, Cathay Pacific has stated that it intends to continue the operation of HK Express as a stand-alone low-cost carrier separate from its existing full-service operations.\n\nHowever, according to the announcement, a firm of solicitors acting for a shareholder of an intermediate holding company of HK Express, has contested the seller's entry into an agreement for the transaction. It also states that Cathay Pacific has the right to terminate the share purchase if proceedings are commenced to prevent the transaction. The contesting party is widely believed to be the chairman and the major shareholder of HK Express, Zhong Guosong, who has clarified that he has no intention to sell the company and will potentially launch legal action regarding the sale.\n\nOn 19 July 2019, Cathay Pacific announced the acquisition of Hong Kong Express Airways has been completed. HK Express is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Cathay Pacific. However, HK Express will continue to operate as a low-cost carrier stand-alone airline.\n\nHKExpress has announced to suspend all flight operations from 23 March to 30 April 2020 due to the reduced demand caused by the Wuhan Coronavirus.\n\nThese destinations are currently served by HK Express.\n\n, the HK Express fleet consists of the following aircraft:\n\nHK Express has previously operated the following aircraft:\n\n\nThe original livery features a white fuselage with a blue engine and wingtip. The words \"Hong Kong Express\" are painted under the windows, with its former name \"\" at the rear door.\n\nThe second livery features the standard HNA Group Airline livery, almost identical with the livery of Hong Kong Airlines, with the golden bauhinia design on its logo. The only difference is the word \"Express\" in block letters painted under the windows.\n\nThe current livery of Hong Kong Express is followed by the logo redesign of the airline. It features a white fuselage with a purple and red theme, and has a Hong Kong city silhouette in purple on the tail.\n\nOn 14 April 2016, Hong Kong Express launched a loyalty programme named \"Reward-U\". Flights and gifts can be redeemed on the official website. The programme is free to join, only individuals two years old or above can join the programme. Each eligible Hong Kong Dollar spend earns ten points, but U-Biz passengers can earn 20 points per dollar spent. At most five members can form a reward-U crew to consolidate the points. Reward-U will be will officially cease its operations on 1 January 2020, merging with AsiaMiles.\n\nIn 29 September 2017, HK Express suddenly cancelled 18 flights to Osaka, Nagoya and Incheon on 1 and 8 October without any notice. Because the flights cancelled cover the National Day of China and Mid-Autumn Festival Holidays, 2070 passengers were affected. HK express felt extremely sorry for the inconvenience caused, and proposed a series of alternative solutions for the affected passengers like travelling on another airline, changing travel date, changing destination and full refund. Civil Aviation Department was unsatisfied by the behavior of HK Express, and requires the airline to submit a detailed report regarding the causes, short-term and long-term solutions to the incidents.\n\nIn July 2018, HK Express was found posting advertisements under street signposts, with QR codes available for citizens to scan for information and participate in games to win prizes. The advertisements did not show the airline's name nor its logo, however names of Japanese places were shown. District council members said that these materials may cause chaos and mislead citizens, due to Highways Department strictly prohibits organisations from posting anything on their signposts. HK Express apologised for organising this activity, and stopped the activity on 18 July 2018, and removed the advertisements.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1795340", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1795340", "title": "LGBT rights in Ecuador", "text": "LGBT rights in Ecuador\n\nLesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people in Ecuador may face some legal challenges not experienced by non-LGBT residents. Both male and female same-sex sexual activity are legal in Ecuador, but same-sex couples and households headed by same-sex couples are not eligible for the complete legal protections available to opposite-sex married couples.\n\nIn 1998, Ecuador became one of the first countries in the world to constitutionally ban discrimination based on sexual orientation. Since 2008, civil unions with all of the rights of marriage (except for adoption) have been available to same-sex couples. Additionally, transgender people under the 2016 \"Gender Identity Law\" may change their legal gender solely based on self-determination, without undergoing surgery. Ecuador is also one of the few countries in the world to have banned conversion therapy.\n\nIn 2013, gay activist Pamela Troya filed a lawsuit to strike down the country's same-sex marriage ban. The lawsuit focused mostly on the Inter-American Court of Human Rights' ruling in \"Atala Riffo and Daughters v. Chile\" and its 2018 opinion on same-sex marriage. The \"Atala\" case has caused bans on same-sex marriage in Mexico to be struck down and Chile pledging to legalise same-sex marriage. Additionally, in January 2018, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights ruled that same-sex marriage is a human right protected by the American Convention on Human Rights. As a result, on 12 June 2019, the Constitutional Court ruled in a 5–4 vote in favor of same-sex marriage, legalising it in Ecuador.\n\nConquest by the Spanish from the mid-16 century onwards introduced Christianity, specifically Roman Catholicism, and religious mores condemning homosexuality as \"sinful\" and \"immoral\" to the region now known as Ecuador. As such, society has typically viewed homosexuality pejoratively. However, this is, or at least was, not the case for many of the indigenous peoples; among them, the Shuar. While the Europeans and the West have typically regarded anal intercourse as a sign of effeminacy, the Shuar perceived it as a sign of trickery. The \"passive\" partner () and the \"active\" partner () were not regarded as feminine. A Shuar myth, known as the story of the fox and the jaguar, involves the fox deceiving the jaguar into having anal sex, but after having discovered the trickery the jaguar chases the fox and bites him.\n\nThe Inca Empire's perception of homosexuality is unclear and is the subject of ongoing debate. Most modern-day documentation about the Incas stems from the Spanish Inquisition. These reports suggest that male homosexuality was punished in the south and centre of the Inca Empire, possibly by death, but was tolerated in the north. According to certain sources, homosexuality and cross-dressing were tolerated \"acts of worship\", commonly practised in religious rituals and temples. were cross-dressing shamans, tasked with performing rituals in honour of Chuqui Hinchay, a jaguar dual-gender god. Effeminate men were called or by the Incas. Lesbian relationships seem to have been highly regarded by Inca society. Lesbians (known as ) enjoyed many privileges and could even participate in combats and were given the possibility of maintaining promiscuous relations between themselves.\n\nSame-sex sexual activity has been legal in Ecuador since 1997 when the Constitutional Tribunal, in \"Case No. 111-97-TC\", overturned the first paragraph of Article 516 of the Penal Code, which criminalized sexual activities between persons of the same sex.\n\nThe age of consent in Ecuador is 14, regardless of gender or sexual orientation.\n\nArticle 67 of the Ecuadorian Constitution adopted in 2008 limited marriage to the union of a man and a woman. However, article 68 provides that same-sex couples in stable and monogamous unions shall enjoy the same rights and obligations as married couples, except for adoption.\nThe stable and monogamous union between two persons without any other marriage ties who have a common-law home, for the lapse of time and under the conditions and circumstances provided for by law, shall enjoy the same rights and obligations of those families bound by formal marriage ties.\n\nBased on Article 68, civil unions for same-sex couples are legal in Ecuador. In August 2014, President Rafael Correa signed a resolution to allow same-sex couples to register their unions. It also allows civil unions to be registered as a complementary data to marital status and created a special registry for these unions. The order took effect on 15 September. In April 2015, the National Assembly approved an amendment to the Civil Code that codified civil unions into statutory law and deleted the requirement of evidence of cohabitation for at least two years.\n\nIn January 2018, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights (IACHR) ruled that the American Convention on Human Rights mandates and requires the recognition of same-sex marriage. The ruling was fully binding on Costa Rica and sets a binding precedent for other Latin American and Caribbean countries including Ecuador.\n\nFollowing the IACHR ruling, which held that same-sex marriage is a human right, two same-sex couples went to the Civil Registry in Cuenca, applying for marriage licenses. After both were rejected for not being a different-sex couple, they filed suit in court arguing that the refusal to recognise their marriage was discriminatory, unconstitutional and a violation of the American Convention on Human Rights. Relying on the IACHR ruling, two family judges ruled in the couples' favour on 29 June 2018. The judges ordered the Civil Registry to immediately begin registering same-sex marriages. However, the Civil Registry appealed the decision to the Constitutional Court. On 12 June 2019, the court ruled in favor of same-sex marriage, making it legal throughout the country.\n\nArticle 68 of the Ecuador Constitution states: \"\"La adopción corresponderá sólo a parejas de distinto sexo\"\". An unofficial English language translation of this provision states: \"Adoption shall only be permitted for different-sex couples.\" The Constitution is silent about adoptions by single individuals.\n\nUnder Ecuadorian statutory law, however, a single person is allowed to adopt a child, although a legally constituted heterosexual couple has priority over the single person.\n\nIn May 2018, the Constitutional Court of Ecuador ordered the Civil Registry to register a seven-year-old girl as the daughter of a lesbian couple. The case, filed in September 2012, sought to have the daughter registered with the surnames of both her mothers. The Court ruled that failing to register the daughter is a violation of children's rights. The vote was 5 to 3, with one abstention.\n\nIn 1998, Ecuador became the first country in the Americas (and only the third worldwide after South Africa and Fiji) to include sexual orientation as a protected category in its Constitution. An unofficial English language translation of Article 11(2) states:\nAll persons are equal and shall enjoy the same rights, duties and opportunities. No one shall be discriminated against for reasons of ethnic belonging, place of birth, age, sex, gender identity, cultural identity, civil status, language, religion, ideology, political affiliation, legal record, socio-economic condition, migratory status, sexual orientation, health status, HIV carrier, disability, physical difference or any other distinguishing feature, whether personal or collective, temporary or permanent, which might be aimed at or result in the diminishment or annulment of recognition, enjoyment or exercise of rights. All forms of discrimination are punishable by law. The State shall adopt affirmative action measures that promote real equality for the benefit of the rights-bearers who are in a situation of inequality.\n\nIn 2015, a labor law reform made it illegal for employers to discriminate against people due to their sexual orientation.\n\nIn June 2018, the Justice Ministry approved a new policy concerning the rights of LGBT people. The policy aims to guarantee and strengthen their rights in relation to health, education, work, security, social protection and justice.\n\nThe \"Gender Identity Law\" (), approved in 2016, allows Ecuadorians to state their gender identity instead of the sex assigned at birth. The law distributes new legal ID cards to those wishing to change their gender and birth name.\n\nIn November 2011, an Ecuadorean activist group, called \"Fundación Causana\", began a petition on Change.org to entreat the Ecuadorean Minister of Health to close down more than 200 \"ex-gay clinics.\" The group claimed that the clinics abuse and torture patients in an effort to \"cure homosexuality.\"\n\nThe clinics primarily targeted lesbians and operated under the guise of being drug rehabilitation centers. At least one pair of parents discovered the abuse and asked for the clinic to release their daughter, Paola Ziritti, but were denied. Ziritti was eventually released after two years of confinement and was the first to press a formal complaint against the clinics.\n\nActivists consequently called on the Government to close down the clinics, but by August 2011, only 27 had been closed, while a reported 207 clinics remained open. On 23 January 2012, the Change.org petition was closed and marked as a success with 113,761 international signatures. The petition also was updated with a statement from \"Fundacion Causana\" reading,\nAfter ten years of outcry, the nation of Ecuador – through the Ministry of Public Health – has entered into a commitment with civic organizations and society in general to deconstruct the belief that homosexuality is an illness and root out the use of torture in these clinics. We extend our thanks to all the men and women who signed our petition. It has been invaluable to have this support in starting to change this reality.\n\nMinister of Health Carina Vance Mafla ordered shortly thereafter three clinics to be raided in the vicinity of Quito and rescued dozens of women.\n\nConsequently, Article 151 of the Penal Code was changed in 2014 to prohibit conversion therapy, equating it to torture. People who undertake the pseudoscientific practice are punished with seven to ten years imprisonment.\n\nA fairly large gay scene has developed in Quito and Guayaquil. The first gay pride in Ecuador took place in Quito in 1998, following the Constitutional Court ruling that overturned the law which prohibited sexual acts between people of the same sex. Nevertheless, Ecuador has a conservative and macho culture, and homosexuality tends to be viewed negatively by society.\n\nSince the last decade, many gay pride marches have been organized in all major cities, with the authorization of authorities and police protection, in addition to their participation. In Guayaquil's gay pride march of 2011, for instance, among those present were Guayas Province's Vice Prefect Luzmila Nicolaide, Guayaquil City Council member Gino Molinari, and member of the National Assembly Gina Godoy, while the police band played traditional songs.\n\nThere have also been LGBT film festivals organized in the major cities.\n\nThe U.S. Department of State's 2011 Human Rights Report found that,\nThe constitution includes the principle of nondiscrimination and establishes choice of sexual orientation as a right. Although the law prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation, gay, lesbian, and transgender persons continued to suffer discrimination from both public and private bodies. LGBT organizations reported that transgender persons suffered more discrimination because they were more visible. LGBT groups claimed that police and prosecutors did not thoroughly investigate deaths of LGBT individuals, including when there was suspicion that the killing was because of sexual orientation or gender identity.\nLGBT organizations and credible media sources reported that LGBT persons were interned against their will in private treatment centers to \"cure\" or \"dehomosexualize\" them, although such treatment is illegal. The clinics reportedly used cruel treatments, including rape, in an attempt to change LGBT persons' sexual orientation. In August[,] the government reported that it closed 30 such centers, but LGBT organizations reported that other illegal clinics continued to operate. Members of the LGBT community continued to report that their right of equal access to formal education was frequently violated. The LGBT population involved in the commercial sex trade reported abusive situations, extortion, and mistreatment by security forces.\n\nIn 2012, President Rafael Correa appointed Carina Vance Mafla, a lesbian activist, as the country's Health Minister.\n\nIn 2017, approximately 20,000 people marched in the Guayaquil Gay Pride parade. For the first time, the municipality of Guayaquil agreed to light up the Bolivar and San Martin Monument with the colors of the rainbow in support of LGBT rights. In June 2017, the Presidential House was illuminated in rainbow colors. In 2018, more than 18,000 people participated in the Quito Pride march.\n\nAfter the 2013 Ecuadorian general election, Nelson Zavala, an evangelical preacher and the presidential candidate who finished last out of the eight candidates, was sentenced by an election court to pay more than $3,000 in fines for his homophobic remarks. The court also prohibited him for a year from standing as a candidate or from affiliating himself or being involved with a political party or movement. During the campaign, he called gay people \"sinners\" and \"immoral\" and said they suffered from \"severe deviation of conduct.\" LGBT activists applauded the ruling as \"landmark.\" Zavala appealed the verdict, but the ruling was ratified in the last instance on 19 March 2013.\n\nIn the 2013 elections, LGBTI activist Diane Marie Rodríguez Zambrano of the Silueta X Association (\"Asociación Silueta X\") became the first openly transgender candidate to run for public office. At the conclusion of her candidacy, Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa Delgado declared his respect and admiration for Rodriquez on Twitter. Months later, Rodriguez was invited to change the Presidential Guard. In December 2013, she led the first LGBTI group meeting with President Rafael Correa. The meeting concluded with several agreements. In 2017, she was elected to the National Assembly, becoming the country's first transgender lawmaker.\n\n"}

Born in Bucharest, Romania, she was known largely for the work she made in Brazil, then Mexico for many years and later in Italy, Israel and The Netherlands.\n\nLandau was born on December 5, 1926 in Bucharest, Romania. At the age of 12, her Jewish family, fearing persecution by rising fascist forces, fled Romania just ahead of Ion Antonescu's coup d'état. After extensive travel throughout Europe, she finally arrived in Brazil. There, her great interest in artistic and intellectual life gave her the opportunity to meet painters like Di Cavalcanti, Antonio Dias, Wesley Duke Lee, Francisco Brennand, Antonio Dias and João Camara, the sculptor Sergio Camargo, the writer Jorge Amado and poet-musician-diplomat Vinicius de Morais, the musician-painter Dorival Caymmi.\n\nShy but determined, she started to paint. Her first works were figurative but gradually she began to realize that this was not her style. Influenced by Dufy, she painted her way out of figurative art and entered into Expressionism.\nA very decisive moment in her life was when her uncle Marcel Janco (one of the founders of Dadaism) came to visit her family and was very impressed by her work. Another important artist in her career was the great Brazilian engraver Oswaldo Goeldi. Critics, like Mario Pedrosa, Aracy Amaral, Frederico de Morais (Brazil), Jorge A. Manrique (who described her work as being \"brutal and refined’) and Rita Eder have recognized Landau's artistic contribution, describing it with high esteem.\n\nLandau has lived in six countries, whose diverse cultures gave her work a cosmopolitan outlook. \nShe married Miguel Salas Anzures, head of Fine Arts-INBA, Mexico. He broke with Socialist Realism, represented by painters like Diego Rivera, José Clemente Orozco, David Alfaro Siqueiros. This new expression of art was called\" Generación de la Ruptura\". The members of this generation of artists include native-born Mexicans and immigrants, many of which were refugees from World War II. Along with José Luis Cuevas, these include Fernando García Ponce, Roger Von Gunten, Edmundo Aquino, Francisco Toledo, Arturo Rivera, Leonora Carrington, Alberto Gironella, Ricardo Martínez, Arnaldo Coen, Lilia Carrillo, Vlady, Manuel Felguérez, Gilberto Aceves Navarro, Gustavo Arias Murueta, Luis López Loza, Luis Almeida, Peggy Espinosa, Adolfo Falcón, Efraín Herrero, Rafael López Castro, Bernardo Recamier, Pablo Rulfo and Vicente Rojo.\n\nLandau introduced a new technique of engraving on metal, utilizing acids, but printed from the surface, called \"Metal Relief\". She had her first exhibition in Mexico in 1963 and gradually became one of the leading Latin American women artists. Her Metal Relief works were well received by art critic Paul Westheim in the important magazine \"El Nuevo Arte de los Metales\" and by art connoisseur, reviewer and historian Jorge Olvera. \nShe continued her in-depth research and found her definitive expression in painting with pastel on raw linen. In this technique she was a pioneer. Her thematic approach was also new: she was the first Latin American abstract painter to use movements of free geometrical lines. All her works since 1965 are called \"Rhythms\".\n\nIn 1974, she began working as a teacher in the University of Veracruz in the Faculty of Fine Arts. In 1975 she became a full-time researcher for the Institute of Aesthetics and Artistic Creation at the University.\n\nLandau had more than sixty individual exhibitions, the most important of which was held in 1987 in the Museum of Modern Art in Mexico City. She participated in 150 group exhibitions in Mexico, France, Italy, Brazil, Chile, the United States and Cuba.\n\nIn 1994, she moved from Mexico to Rome,Italy where she stayed until 2010 and later to Jerusalem, Israel where she lived for 6 years. Landau resided in The Netherlands for two years and died there on July 14, 2018. \n\nPolitically, she was a vocal critic of the Israeli government and described herself as stateless: \"I don't believe in borders, I don't like flags, I have no boundaries. My only homeland: friendship, love and justice for all.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1795345", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1795345", "title": "United Western Recorders", "text": "United Western Recorders\n\nUnited Western Recorders was a two-building recording studio complex in Hollywood, which became one of the most successful independent recording studios of the 1960s. The complex merged neighboring studios United Recording Corp. on 6050 Sunset Boulevard and Western Studio on 6000 Sunset Boulevard.\n\nIn 1984, United Western Recorders was renamed and succeeded by Ocean Way Recording. Starting in 1999, the complex was divided into two establishments: Ocean Way Recording (now United Recording Studios) at 6050 Sunset and Cello Studios (now EastWest Studios) at 6000 Sunset. \n\nThe United Western complex produced some of the biggest hit records of the pop era. According to the book \"Temples of Sound\", \"No other studio has won more technical excellence awards, and no studio has garnered as many Best Engineered Grammys as this complex of studios on Sunset Boulevard.\" Its Studio 3 room is considered iconic for its use by Brian Wilson for the Beach Boys' albums \"Pet Sounds\" (1966) and \"Smile\" (unreleased).\n\nThe complex's two buildings, United Recording and Western Studio, operated more or less independently despite being located only one block apart. United consisted of two large rooms; the larger United 'A' was approximately 45 × 65 × 22 feet, with United 'B' being slightly smaller. Western copied the layout of United, with the very large Western 1 and the somewhat smaller Western 2. Both buildings also had a third, smaller recording room, as well as several dubbing and mastering suites. The small rooms provided a sumptuous sound, with Western Studio 3, measuring just 34' × 14', being Brian Wilson's preference.\n\nPrior to his move to California, Bill Putnam had founded the prestigious Universal Recording studio in Chicago. A pioneer of modern recording technique, Putnam became well known for his UREI recording equipment and custom-made Universal Audio mixing consoles, which were bought by major recording studios. After relocating to Hollywood in 1957, and with the backing of Bing Crosby and Frank Sinatra, Putnam first established the United Recording Corp. studio complex at 6050 Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood. In 1961, he purchased the neighboring Western Studio at 6000 Sunset, remodeling and incorporating the building into the complex. The buildings were then renamed United Western Recorders, and catered to some of the biggest artists of the era, including Frank Sinatra, The Beach Boys, and Elvis Presley.\n\nPutnam assembled a talented staff, some of whom went on to become major names in their own right, notably Bones Howe, John Haeny, Lee Hershberg, Chuck Britz, and Wally Heider, one of the pioneers of mobile recording and later of Wally Heider Studios. United was initially favored by 'older' artists such as Crosby, Sinatra, Nat King Cole and Ray Charles, as well as the young Fleetwoods, while Western soon became a favored recording venue for the new generation of pop-rock musicians and producers, such as Sam Cooke, the Beach Boys, Phil Spector and The Mamas & the Papas.\n\nIn the early sixties, Putnam scored a significant coup when major US record labels began to release stereophonic recordings in large numbers. According to Allen Sides, when stereo first appeared in the late 1950s, the cost-conscious major labels were initially uninterested, feeling that the market for the new format was limited, and that stereo mixdowns were a waste of time and money. Putnam however foresaw the coming importance of stereo and, at his own expense, he began making simultaneous mono and stereo mixdowns, storing away the stereo versions of these recordings, which at the time were released only in mono. When stereo took off in the early sixties, Putnam had amassed a very valuable stockpile of more than two-and-a-half years' worth of stereo recordings by scores of major acts. The value of this stockpile can be estimated from Sides' statement that United Western was at this time bringing in around US$200,000 per month in studio billings—equivalent to perhaps US$1 million per month today. The major labels approached Putnam hoping to buy the stereo tape stockpile, but he struck a far more lucrative deal, in which the labels repaid him for the (far more expensive) studio time he had used in making the stereo mixes.\n\nIn 1970, Jack Herschorn purchased the Universal Audio mixing console and a number of other pieces of equipment from that studio including UA LA-76A and LA-76B limiting amplifiers, UA vacuum tube power amplifiers (which were actually Dynakit Stereo 70 and 50-watt mono amplifier kits assembled into rack-mount chassis), Fairchild Conax sibilance controllers, Langevin graphic equalizers and Cinema Engineering filters, all originally installed in United Studio A in 1957. This equipment was shipped to Vancouver, Canada, and installed in Aragon Studios which he owned at the time, later renamed Mushroom Studios. Installation of the equipment in Vancouver was supervised by Charlie Richmond.\n\nIn 1984, Bill Putnam sold the studio complex to Allen Sides, who renamed the buildings Ocean Way Recording, as they would both be known until 1999.\n\nIn 1999, Sides sold the Western half of the complex to computer magnate Rick Adams, who renamed it Cello Studios. Cello Studios operated at the 6000 Sunset complex from 1999-2005. During that period, the studios hosted high-profile rock artists such as Blink-182, Rage Against the Machine, Tool, System of a Down, Weezer, Muse, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Audioslave, and The Mars Volta. Cello Studios closed in 2005.\n\nWhen Allen Sides sold Western to Rick Adams, the equipment inventory was also purchased from Ocean Way Recording, including a collection of rare vintage microphones, as well as vintage outboard gear including valuable studio effects units such as the legendary Fairchild 670 limiters, no longer made, which were a crucial element of the sound of many classic pop recordings of the Fifties and Sixties. While the building was modified to accommodate the new facility's needs, the studios themselves have not been altered since Bill Putnam's original design. During this period, the studio played host to artists such as Alanis Morissette, Natalie Merchant, Elton John, R.E.M., Bette Midler, Barenaked Ladies, Stone Temple Pilots, Matthew Sweet, Mötley Crüe, Green Day and Blink-182.\n\nAt the beginning of 2006, Cello Studios (originally Western) was purchased by EastWest producer Doug Rogers and renamed EastWest Studios. Rogers extensively remodeled the non-technical areas of the studio complex with designer Philippe Starck, but the studios themselves, with their famous acoustics, remain as originally built by Putnam in the 1960s and continue to operate to this day. Since 2012 EastWest Studios has racked up 130 Grammy nominations, more than any other recording studio in the world.\n\nIn 2015, Ocean Way Recording was sold and renamed back to United Recording Studios.\n\nFrank Sinatra made all his famous Reprise recordings—including hits like \"It Was a Very Good Year\", \"That's Life\"—in United A, and \"Strangers In The Night\"—in Western 1, and his Reprise records offices were located upstairs. Ray Charles cut his epoch-making country-soul crossover hit \"I Can't Stop Loving You\" and the LP \"Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music\" at United B. As well as the classic \"Pet Sounds\", Western 3 was the venue for the recording of many other chart-topping pop hits, including The Mamas & the Papas' \"California Dreamin'\" and \"Monday, Monday\", The Grass Roots \"Let's Live for Today\" and \"Midnight Confessions\" and \"Hair\" by The Cowsills. As well as those noted above, other famous artists who have recorded there include Blondie, Elvis Presley, Bobby Vee, The 5th Dimension, The Righteous Brothers, Barbra Streisand, Petula Clark, Ella Fitzgerald, Whitney Houston, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis, Jr., The Rolling Stones, Elton John, Tom Petty, R.E.M., k.d. lang, Madonna, Rod Stewart, Glen Campbell, Eric Clapton and Bonnie Raitt.\n\nMany film and television theme songs have been recorded in the studios at 6000 Sunset. The theme songs for Hawaii Five-O, The Partridge Family, The Beverly Hillbillies, and Green Acres were all recorded at Western Recorders. Film soundtracks recorded at the studios include “That Thing You Do”, “The Way We Were”, “Roots”, and “Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil”. \"My Love\" by Petula Clark was the first Billboard number one song recorded at Western Studios. \n\n"}

It is the seat of the gmina (administrative district) called Gmina Raków. It lies in historic Lesser Poland, approximately south-east of the regional capital Kielce. The village has a population of 1,213.\n\nRaków was founded in 1569 by , a Calvinist who was castellan of Żarnów, as the centre of the Polish Brethren and a place of religious tolerance. The town coat of arms includes a crayfish and is derived from the Warnia coat of arms of Sienieński's Arian wife, Jadwiga Gnoińska. The Socinian Racovian Academy was founded in 1602 by Jakub Sienieński, Jan Sienieński's son. By the 1630s, the town had grown to 15,000 inhabitants, with businesses centering on the Academy.\n\nAs the Counter-Reformation in Poland gathered force, pressure began to be used against the Socinians. On April 19, 1638 an incident occurred in which some young students of the Academy destroyed or removed a cross, giving the royal court the pretext needed to ban Arian activities, including printing and the schools, and sentenced teachers to exile, many heading south to the Principality of Transylvania. Jesuit scholar Szymon Starowolski justified the closing of Protestant schools (in 1638 and 1640), and Protestant centers and printing presses (in 1638, the press at Raków), as the \"duty of good pastors\" and as a legitimate act of the King and the Republic. The was demolished in 1640. In 1641 Jakub Zadzik, archbishop of Kraków, began construction of the magnificent on the same site and settled Franciscan friars in Raków to reconvert the Polish Brethren. The friars left the town around 1649. The main Arian buildings were destroyed, and more destruction was brought by Cossacks and Hungarians in 1657. By 1700 the town had only 700 inhabitants left.\n\nInitially, after the first partition of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, Raków was in the Austrian Partition and later in the Russian Partition. In 1820, Raków had 926 inhabitants, in 1864 their number rose to 2007, a significant part being Jewish. In 1869, like many other Polish towns, Raków lost its town status and town privileges.\n\n\n<br>\n"}

{"id": "1795376", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1795376", "title": "Impeachment in the United States", "text": "Impeachment in the United States\n\nImpeachment in the United States is the process by which a legislature (usually in the form of the lower house) brings charges against a civil officer of government for crimes alleged to have been committed, analogous to the bringing of an indictment by a grand jury. Impeachment may occur at the federal level or the state level. The federal House of Representatives can impeach federal officials, including the president, and each state's legislature can impeach state officials, including the governor, in accordance with their respective federal or state constitution.\n\nMost impeachments have concerned alleged crimes committed while in office, though there have been a few cases in which officials have been impeached and subsequently convicted for crimes committed prior to taking office. The impeached official remains in office until a trial is held. That trial, and removal from office if convicted, is separate from the act of impeachment itself. \n\nIn impeachment proceedings, the defendant does not risk forfeiture of life, liberty, or property. According to the Constitution, the only penalties allowed to be imposed by the Senate are removal from office and disqualification from holding any federal office in the future.\n\nThere are several provisions in the United States Constitution relating to impeachment:\n\nThe Constitution limits grounds of impeachment to \"Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors\". The precise meaning of the phrase \"high Crimes and Misdemeanors\" is not defined in the Constitution itself.\n\n\"High crimes and misdemeanors\", in the legal and common parlance of England in the 17th and 18th centuries, is corrupt activity by those who have special duties that are not shared with common persons. Toward the end of the 1700s, \"High crimes and misdemeanors\" acquired a more technical meaning. As Blackstone says in his \"Commentaries\": The first and principal high misdemeanor...was mal-administration of such high offices as are in public trust and employment.\n\nThe notion that only \"criminal\" conduct can constitute sufficient grounds for impeachment does not comport with either the views of the founders or with historical practice. Alexander Hamilton, in Federalist 65, described impeachable offenses as arising from \"the misconduct of public men, or in other words from the abuse or violation of some public trust\". Such offenses were \"\"political\", as they relate chiefly to injuries done immediately to the society itself\". According to this reasoning, impeachable conduct could include behavior that violates an official's duty to the country, even if such conduct is not necessarily a prosecutable offense. Indeed, in the past both houses of Congress have given the phrase \"high Crimes and Misdemeanors\" a broad reading, finding that impeachable offenses need not be limited to criminal conduct.\n\nThe purposes underlying the impeachment process also indicate that non-criminal activity may constitute sufficient grounds for impeachment. The purpose of impeachment is not to inflict personal punishment for criminal activity. Instead, impeachment is a \"remedial\" tool; it serves to effectively \"maintain constitutional government\" by removing individuals unfit for office. Grounds for impeachment include abuse of the particular powers of government office or a violation of the \"public trust\"—conduct that is unlikely to be barred via statute.\n\nIn drawing up articles of impeachment, the House has placed little emphasis on criminal conduct. Less than one-third of the articles that the House have adopted have explicitly charged the violation of a criminal statute or used the word \"criminal\" or \"crime\" to describe the conduct alleged. Officials have been impeached and removed for drunkenness, biased decision-making, or inducing parties to enter financial transactions, none of which is specifically criminal. Two of the articles against President Andrew Johnson were based on rude speech that reflected badly on the office: President Johnson had made \"harangues\" criticizing the Congress and questioning its legislative authority, refusing to follow laws, and diverting funds allocated in an army appropriations act, each of which brought the presidency \"into contempt, ridicule, and disgrace\". A number of individuals have been impeached for behavior incompatible with the nature of the office they hold. Some impeachments have addressed, at least in part, conduct before the individuals assumed their positions: for example, Article IV against Judge Thomas Porteous related to false statements to the FBI and Senate in connection with his nomination and confirmation to the court.\n\nOn the other hand, the Constitutional Convention rejected language that would have permitted impeachment for \"maladministration\", with Madison arguing that \"[s]o vague a term will be equivalent to a tenure during pleasure of the Senate.\"\n\nCongressional materials have cautioned that the grounds for impeachment \"do not all fit neatly and logically into categories\" because the remedy of impeachment is intended to \"reach a broad variety of conduct by officers that is both serious and incompatible with the duties of the office\". Congress has identified three general types of conduct that constitute grounds for impeachment, although these categories should not be understood as exhaustive:\n\n\nConversely, not all criminal conduct is impeachable: in 1974, the Judiciary Committee rejected an article of impeachment against President Nixon alleging that he committed tax fraud, primarily because that \"related to the President's private conduct, not to an abuse of his authority as President\".\n\nSeveral commentators have suggested that Congress alone may decide for itself what constitutes a \"high Crime or Misdemeanor\", especially since the Supreme Court decided in \"Nixon v. United States\" that it did not have the authority to determine whether the Senate properly \"tried\" a defendant. In 1970, then-House Minority Leader Gerald R. Ford defined the criterion as he saw it: \"An impeachable offense is whatever a majority of the House of Representatives considers it to be at a given moment in history.\"\n\nOf the 20 impeachments voted by the House:\n\n\nThe standard of proof required for impeachment and conviction is also left to the discretion of individual Representatives and Senators, respectively. Defendants have argued that impeachment trials are in the nature of criminal proceedings, with convictions carrying grave consequences for the accused, and that therefore proof beyond a reasonable doubt should be the applicable standard. House Managers have argued that a lower standard would be appropriate to better serve the purpose of defending the community against abuse of power, since the defendant does not risk forfeiture of life, liberty, or property, for which the reasonable doubt standard was set.\n\nThe Constitution gives Congress the authority to impeach and remove \"The President, Vice President, and all civil officers of the United States\" upon a determination that such officers have engaged in treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors. The Constitution does not articulate who qualifies as a \"civil officer of the United States\".\n\nFederal judges are subject to impeachment. In fact, 15 of 20 officers impeached, and all eight officers removed after Senate trial, have been judges. The most recent impeachment effort against a Supreme Court justice that resulted in a House of Representatives investigation was against Justice William O. Douglas. In 1970, Representative Gerald Ford, who was then House minority leader, called for the House to impeach Douglas. However, a House investigation led by Congressman Emanuel Celler (D-NY) determined that Ford's allegations were baseless. According to Professor Joshua E. Kastenberg at the University of New Mexico, School of Law, Ford and Nixon sought to force Douglas off the Court in order to cement the \"Southern Strategy\" as well as to provide cover for the invasion of Cambodia. When their efforts failed, Douglas remained on the Court.\n\nWithin the executive branch, any Presidentially appointed \"principal officer\", including a head of an agency such as a Secretary, Administrator, or Commissioner, is a \"civil officer of the United States\" subject to impeachment. At the opposite end of the spectrum, lesser functionaries, such as federal civil service employees, do not exercise \"significant authority\", and are not appointed by the President or an agency head. These employees do not appear to be subject to impeachment, though that may be a matter of allocation of House floor debate time by the Speaker, rather than a matter of law.\n\nThe Senate has concluded that members of Congress (Representatives and Senators) are not \"civil officers\" for purposes of impeachment. As a practical matter, expulsion is effected by the simpler procedures of Article I, Section 5, which provides \"Each House shall be the Judge of the Elections, Returns and Qualifications of its own Members... Each House may determine the Rules of its Proceedings, punish its Members for disorderly Behaviour, and, with the Concurrence of two thirds, expel a Member.\" (\"see List of United States senators expelled or censured and List of United States Representatives expelled, censured, or reprimanded\"). This allows each House to expel its own members without involving the other chamber. In 1797, the House of Representatives impeached Senator William Blount of Tennessee. The Senate expelled Senator Blount under Article I, Section 5, on the same day. However, the impeachment proceeding remained pending (expulsion only removes the individual from office, but conviction after impeachment may also bar the individual from holding future office, so the question of further punishment remained to be decided). After four days of debate, the Senate concluded that a Senator is not a \"civil officer of the United States\" for purposes of the Impeachment clause, and dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. The House has not impeached a Member of Congress since Blount.\n\nAt the federal level, the impeachment process is a three-step procedure.\n\nA number of rules have been adopted by the House and Senate and are honored by tradition.\n\nJefferson's Manual, which is integral to the Rules of the House of Representatives, states that impeachment is set in motion by charges made on the floor, charges proffered by a memorial, a member's resolution referred to a committee, a message from the president, or from facts developed and reported by an investigating committee of the House. It further states that a proposition to impeach is a question of high privilege in the House and at once supersedes business otherwise in order under the rules governing the order of business.\n\n\"The House Practice: A Guide to the Rules, Precedents and Procedures of the House\" is a reference source for information on the rules and selected precedents governing the House procedure, prepared by the House Parliamentarian. The manual has a chapter on the House's rules, procedures, and precedent for impeachment.\n\nIn 1974, as part of the preliminary investigation in the Nixon impeachment inquiry, the staff of the Impeachment Inquiry of the House Judiciary Committee prepared a report, \"Constitutional Grounds for Presidential Impeachment\". The primary focus of the Report is the definition of the term \"high Crimes and Misdemeanors\" and the relationship to criminality, which the Report traces through history from English roots, through the debates at the 1787 Constitutional Convention, and the history of the impeachments before 1974.\n\nThe 1974 report has been expanded and revised on several occasions by the Congressional Research Service, and the current version \"Impeachment and Removal\" dates from October 2015. While this document is only staff recommendation, as a practical matter, today it is probably the single most influential definition of \"high Crimes and Misdemeanors\".\n\nThe Senate has formal \"Rules and Procedures of Practice in the Senate When Sitting on Impeachment Trials\".\n\nWhile the actual impeachment of a federal public official is a rare event, demands for impeachment, especially of presidents, are common, going back to the administration of George Washington in the mid-1790s.\n\nWhile almost all of them were for the most part frivolous and were buried as soon as they were introduced, several did have their intended effect. Treasury Secretary Andrew Mellon and Supreme Court Justice Abe Fortas both resigned in response to the threat of impeachment hearings, and most famously, President Richard Nixon resigned from office after the House Judiciary Committee had already reported articles of impeachment to the floor.\n\nIn advance of the formal resolution by the full House to authorize proceedings, committee chairmen have the same power for impeachment as for any other issue within the jurisdiction of the committee: to investigate, subpoena witnesses, and prepare a preliminary report of findings. For example:\n\n\nTargets of congressional investigations have challenged the power of Congress to investigate before a formal resolution commences impeachment proceedings. For example, President Buchanan wrote to the committee investigating his administration:\n\nI do, therefore... solemnly protest against these proceedings of the House of Representatives, because they are in violation of the rights of the coordinate executive branch of the Government, and subversive of its constitutional independence; because they are calculated to foster a band of interested parasites and informers, ever ready, for their own advantage, to swear before \"ex parte\" committees to pretended private conversations between the President and themselves, incapable, from their nature, of being disproved; thus furnishing material for harassing him, degrading him in the eyes of the country...\n\nHe maintained that the House of Representatives possessed no general powers to investigate him, except when sitting as an impeaching body.\n\nWhen the Supreme Court has considered similar issues, it held that the power to secure \"needed information... has long been treated as an attribute of the power to legislate... [The power to investigate is deeply rooted in the nation's history:] It was so regarded in the British Parliament and in the colonial Legislatures before the American Revolution, and a like view has prevailed and been carried into effect in both houses of Congress and in most of the state Legislatures.\" The Supreme Court also held, \"There can be no doubt as to the power of Congress, by itself or through its committees, to investigate matters and conditions relating to contemplated legislation.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court considered the power of the Congress to investigate, and to subpoena executive branch officials, in a pair of cases arising out of alleged corruption in the administration of President Warren G. Harding. In the first, \"McGrain v. Daugherty\", the Court considered a subpoena issued to the brother of Attorney General Harry Daugherty for bank records relevant to the Senate's investigation into the Department of Justice. Concluding that the subpoena was valid, the Court explained that Congress's \"power of inquiry... is an essential and appropriate auxiliary to the legislative function\", as \"[a] legislative body cannot legislate wisely or effectively in the absence of information respecting the conditions which the legislation is intended to affect or change.\" The Supreme Court held that it was irrelevant that the Senate's authorizing resolution lacked an \"avow[al] that legislative action was had in view\" because, said the Court, \"the subject to be investigated was... [p]lainly [a] subject... on which legislation could be had\" and such legislation \"would be materially aided by the information which the investigation was calculated to elicit.\" Although \"[a]n express avowal\" of the Senate's legislative objective \"would have been better\", the Court admonished that \"the presumption should be indulged that [legislation] was the real object.\"\n\nTwo years later, in \"Sinclair v. United States\", the Court considered investigation of private parties involved with officials under potential investigation for public corruption. In \"Sinclair\", Harry Sinclair, the president of an oil company, appealed his conviction for refusing to answer a Senate committee's questions regarding his company's allegedly fraudulent lease on federal oil reserves at Teapot Dome in Wyoming. The Court, acknowledging individuals' \"right to be exempt from all unauthorized, arbitrary or unreasonable inquiries and disclosures in respect of their personal and private affairs\", nonetheless explained that because \"[i]t was a matter of concern to the United States, ... the transaction purporting to lease to [Sinclair's company] the lands within the reserve cannot be said to be merely or principally... personal.\" The Court also dismissed the suggestion that the Senate was impermissibly conducting a criminal investigation. \"It may be conceded that Congress is without authority to compel disclosures for the purpose of aiding the prosecution of pending suits,\" explained the Court, \"but the authority of that body, directly or through its committees, to require pertinent disclosures in aid of its own constitutional power is not abridged because the information sought to be elicited may also be of use in such suits.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court reached similar conclusions in a number of other cases. In \"Barenblatt v. United States\", the Court permitted Congress to punish contempt, when a person refused to answer questions while testifying under subpoena by the House Committee on Un-American Activities. The Court explained that although \"Congress may not constitutionally require an individual to disclose his ... private affairs except in relation to ... a valid legislative purpose\", such a purpose was present. Congress's \"wide power to legislate in the field of Communist activity... and to conduct appropriate investigations in aid thereof[] is hardly debatable,\" said the Court, and \"[s]o long as Congress acts in pursuance of its constitutional power, the Judiciary lacks authority to intervene on the basis of the motives which spurred the exercise of that power.\"\n\nPresidents have often been the subjects of Congress's legislative investigations. For example, in 1832, the House vested a select committee with subpoena power \"to inquire whether an attempt was made by the late Secretary of War... [to] fraudulently [award]... a contract for supplying rations\" to Native Americans and to \"further... inquire whether the President... had any knowledge of such attempted fraud, and whether he disapproved or approved of the same.\" In the 1990s, first the House and Senate Banking Committees and then a Senate special committee investigated President and Mrs. Clinton's involvement in the Whitewater land deal and related matters. The Senate had an enabling resolution; the House did not.\n\nThe Supreme Court has also explained that Congress has not only the power, but the duty, to investigate so it can inform the public of the operations of government:\n\nImpeachment proceedings may be requested by a member of the House of Representatives on his or her own initiative, either by presenting a list of the charges under oath or by asking for referral to the appropriate committee. The impeachment process may be requested by non-members. For example, when the Judicial Conference of the United States suggests a federal judge be impeached, a charge of actions constituting grounds for impeachment may come from a special prosecutor, the President, or state or territorial legislature, grand jury, or by petition. An impeachment proceeding formally begins with a resolution adopted by the full House of Representatives, which typically includes a referral to a House committee.\n\nThe type of impeachment resolution determines the committee to which it is referred. A resolution impeaching a particular individual is typically referred to the House Committee on the Judiciary. A resolution to authorize an investigation regarding impeachable conduct is referred to the House Committee on Rules, and then to the Judiciary Committee. The House Committee on the Judiciary, by majority vote, will determine whether grounds for impeachment exist (this vote is not law and is not required, US Constitution and US law). \n\nWhere the Committee finds grounds for impeachment, it will set forth specific allegations of misconduct in one or more articles of impeachment. The Impeachment Resolution, or Articles of Impeachment, are then reported to the full House with the committee's recommendations.\n\nThe House debates the resolution and may at the conclusion consider the resolution as a whole or vote on each article of impeachment individually. A simple majority of those present and voting is required for each article for the resolution as a whole to pass. If the House votes to impeach, managers (typically referred to as \"House managers\", with a \"lead House manager\") are selected to present the case to the Senate. Recently, managers have been selected by resolution, while historically the House would occasionally elect the managers or pass a resolution allowing the appointment of managers at the discretion of the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives. These managers are roughly the equivalent of the prosecution or district attorney in a standard criminal trial. Also, the House will adopt a resolution in order to notify the Senate of its action. After receiving the notice, the Senate will adopt an order notifying the House that it is ready to receive the managers. The House managers then appear before the bar of the Senate and exhibit the articles of impeachment. After the reading of the charges, the managers return and make a verbal report to the House.\n\nThe proceedings unfold in the form of a trial, with the Senate having the right to call witnesses and each side having the right to perform cross-examinations. The House members, who are given the collective title of managers during the course of the trial, present the prosecution case, and the impeached official has the right to mount a defense with his or her own attorneys as well. Senators must also take an oath or affirmation that they will perform their duties honestly and with due diligence. After hearing the charges, the Senate usually deliberates in private. The Constitution requires a two-thirds supermajority to convict a person being impeached. The Senate enters judgment on its decision, whether that be to convict or acquit, and a copy of the judgment is filed with the Secretary of State. Upon conviction in the Senate, the official is automatically removed from office and may also be barred from holding future office. The trial is not an actual criminal proceeding and more closely resembles a civil service termination appeal in terms of the contemplated deprivation. Therefore, the removed official may still be liable to criminal prosecution under a subsequent criminal proceeding. The President may not grant a pardon in the impeachment case, but may in any resulting Federal criminal case.\n\nBeginning in the 1980s with Harry E. Claiborne, the Senate began using \"Impeachment Trial Committees\" pursuant to Senate Rule XI. These committees presided over the evidentiary phase of the trials, hearing the evidence and supervising the examination and cross-examination of witnesses. The committees would then compile the evidentiary record and present it to the Senate; all senators would then have the opportunity to review the evidence before the chamber voted to convict or acquit. The purpose of the committees was to streamline impeachment trials, which otherwise would have taken up a great deal of the chamber's time. Defendants challenged the use of these committees, claiming them to be a violation of their fair trial rights as this did not meet the constitutional requirement for their cases to be \"tried by the Senate\". Several impeached judges, including District Court Judge Walter Nixon, sought court intervention in their impeachment proceedings on these grounds. In \"Nixon v. United States\" (1993), the Supreme Court determined that the federal judiciary could not review such proceedings, as matters related to impeachment trials are political questions and could not be resolved in the courts.\n\nIn theory at least, as President of the Senate, the Vice President of the United States could preside over his own impeachment, although legal theories suggest that allowing a defendant to be the judge in his own case would be a blatant conflict of interest. If the Vice President did not preside over an impeachment (of anyone besides the President), the duties would fall to the President pro tempore of the Senate.\n\nTo convict an accused, \"the concurrence of two thirds of the [Senators] present\" for at least one article is required. If there is no single charge commanding a \"guilty\" vote from two-thirds of the senators present, the defendant is acquitted and no punishment is imposed.\n\nConviction immediately removes the defendant from office. Following conviction, the Senate may vote to further punish the individual by barring him or her from holding future federal office, elected or appointed. As the threshold for disqualification is not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution, the Senate has taken the position that disqualification votes only require a simple majority rather than a two-thirds supermajority. The Senate has used disqualification sparingly, as only three individuals have been disqualified from holding future office.\n\nConviction does not extend to further punishment, for example, loss of pension. After conviction by the Senate, \"the Party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to Indictment, Trial, Judgment and Punishment, according to Law\" in the regular federal or state courts.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, impeachment was a procedure whereby a member of the House of Commons could accuse someone of a crime. If the Commons voted for the impeachment, a trial would then be held in the House of Lords. Unlike a bill of attainder, a law declaring a person guilty of a crime, impeachments did not require royal assent, so they could be used to remove troublesome officers of the Crown even if the monarch was trying to protect them.\n\nThe monarch, however, was above the law and could not be impeached, or indeed judged guilty of any crime. When King Charles I was tried before the Rump Parliament of the New Model Army in 1649 he denied that they had any right to legally indict him, their king, whose power was given by God and the laws of the country, saying: \"no earthly power can justly call me (who is your King) in question as a delinquent... no learned lawyer will affirm that an impeachment can lie against the King.\" While the House of Commons pronounced him guilty and ordered his execution anyway, the jurisdictional issue tainted the proceedings.\n\nWith this example in mind, the delegates to the 1787 Constitutional Convention chose to include an impeachment procedure in Article II, Section4 of the Constitution which could be applied to any government official; they explicitly mentioned the President to ensure there would be no ambiguity. Opinions differed, however, as to the reasons Congress should be able to initiate an impeachment. Initial drafts listed only treason and bribery, but George Mason favored impeachment for \"maladministration\" (incompetence). James Madison argued that impeachment should only be for criminal behavior, arguing that a maladministration standard would effectively mean that the President would serve at the pleasure of the Senate. Thus the delegates adopted a compromise version allowing impeachment by the House for \"treason, bribery and other high crimes and misdemeanors\" and conviction by the Senate only with the concurrence of two-thirds of the senators present.\n\nThe House of Representatives has initiated impeachment proceedings 62 times since 1789.\n\nThe House has impeached 20 federal officers. Of these:\n\n\n\nOf the 20 impeachments by the House, two cases did not come to trial because the individuals had left office, seven were acquitted, and eight officials were convicted, all of whom were judges. One, former judge Alcee Hastings, was elected as a member of the United States House of Representatives after being removed from office. No President impeached by the House has been removed from office.\n\nAdditionally, an impeachment process against Richard Nixon was commenced, but not completed, as he resigned from office before the full House voted on the articles of impeachment. To date, no president or vice president has been removed from office by impeachment and conviction.\n\nThe following table lists federal officials for whom impeachment proceedings were instituted and referred to a committee of the House of Representatives. Numbered lines of the table reflect officials impeached by a majority vote of the House. Unnumbered lines are those officials for whom an impeachment proceeding was formally instituted, but ended when (a) the Committee did not vote to recommend impeachment, (b) the Committee recommended impeachment but the vote in the full House failed, or (c) the official resigned or died before the full House vote.\n\nThere were unsuccessful attempts to initiate impeachment proceedings against John Tyler (impeachment defeated in the House, 83–127), George W. Bush, and Barack Obama.\n\nOne notable impeachment attempt that never reached the point of House resolution was an attempt to impeach Associate Justice William O. Douglas by then-House Minority Leader Gerald R. Ford. The Legislative Reference Service of the Library of Congress prepared a report as part of Ford's vetting for confirmation as Vice President in 1973.\n\nState legislatures can impeach state officials, including governors, in every state except Oregon. The court for the trial of impeachments may differ somewhat from the federal model—in New York, for instance, the Assembly (lower house) impeaches, and the State Senate tries the case, but the members of the seven-judge New York State Court of Appeals (the state's highest, constitutional court) sit with the senators as jurors as well. Impeachment and removal of governors has happened occasionally throughout the history of the United States, usually for corruption charges. A total of at least eleven U.S. state governors have faced an impeachment trial; a twelfth, Governor Lee Cruce of Oklahoma, escaped impeachment conviction by a single vote in 1912. Several others, most recently Missouri's Eric Greitens, have resigned rather than face impeachment, when events seemed to make it inevitable. The most recent impeachment of a state governor occurred on January 14, 2009, when the Illinois House of Representatives voted 117–1 to impeach Rod Blagojevich on corruption charges; he was subsequently removed from office and barred from holding future office by the Illinois Senate on January 29. He was the eighth U.S. state governor to be removed from office.\n\nThe procedure for impeachment, or removal, of local officials varies widely. For instance, in New York a mayor is removed directly by the governor \"upon being heard\" on charges—the law makes no further specification of what charges are necessary or what the governor must find in order to remove a mayor.\n\nIn 2018, the entire Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia was impeached, something that has been often threatened, but had never happened before.\n\nAt least four state governors have been impeached and removed from office:\n\n\n\n\n"}

Both male and female same-sex sexual activity is legal in Venezuela, but same-sex couples and households headed by same-sex couples are not eligible for the same legal protections available to opposite-sex married couples. Also, same-sex marriage and \"de facto\" unions are constitutionally banned since 1999.\n\nHomosexuality has never been punishable since Venezuelan independence, except under the \"Vagrants and Thugs' law\" (\"Ley de vagos y maleantes\") (pre-criminal behavior laws as in place in Europe and Latin America during the 20th century). In Venezuela, contrary to Spain, this law did not refer expressly to homosexuals. However, it was occasionally applied to homosexuals and transgender individuals engaged in prostitution, as well as sex workers in general as reported by Amnesty International. People submitted to this law by \"administrative measures\" could be placed under \"re-educational programs\" in special \"confinement places\" without trial, as has also happened in many other countries, including Spain. This law was declared unconstitutional by the former Supreme Court of Justice in 1997. The universal age of consent is equal at 16.\n\nThe Constitution of Venezuela, adopted in 1999, defines marriage as a union between a man and a woman, thus constitutionally banning same-sex marriage. Article 77 of the Constitution reads as follows:\n\nAlso, there is no legal recognition of same-sex couples explicitly in Venezuelan law.\n\nIn 2003, a LGBT NGO called \"Unión Afirmativa\" (Affirmative Union) submitted an appeal to the Supreme Court for legal recognition of economic rights (pensions, inheritance, social security, common household, etc.) for same-sex partners. The ruling, issued on 28 February 2008 despite recognizing that \"same sex partners enjoy all of the rights, civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights- they do have not special protection similar to concubinage or marriage between a man and a woman, that is, in the same terms than heterosexual partners have. Notwithstanding this, the National Assembly is the government body with the mandate to legislate to protect such rights for same-sex partners.\" The decision also indicated that these rights were covered under the Constitution of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.\n\nOn 20 March 2009, Chamber of Deputies member Romelia Matute announced that the National Assembly would explicitly legalize same-sex unions and recognize them as \"asociaciones de convivencia\" (association by cohabitation) as part of the Gender and Equity Organic Law. This initiative was never discussed. Further other initiatives concerning this subject and recognition of identity of transgender people were submitted by the civil society to the National Assembly, but no formal discussion has ever taken place.\n\nOn 31 January 2014, during a debate on a civil code reform bill, LGBT activists submitted a proposal seeking to legalize same-sex marriage.\n\nIn January 2015, a lawsuit for the right to marry was filed before the country's Supreme Court. On 28 April 2016, the Supreme Court announced it would hear the case. The lawsuit seeks to declare Article 44 of the Civil Code unconstitutional because it states that marriage is only legally valid between a man and a woman in Venezuela.\n\nIn June 2016, Venezuela's opposition announced that it will work on a civil union bill. A prominent committee member said that the new Registry Law will allow couples to seek some benefits.\n\nIn November 2017, President Nicolás Maduro expressed his personal support for same-sex marriage, and said that the Constituent Assembly would agree to discuss legalising same-sex marriage. In September 2018, Hermann Escarrá, a member of the Constituent Assembly, said that there are currently discussions to allow same-sex marriage under the new Constitution of Venezuela, and that there is majority support in the Assembly. Discussion on the new Constitution was expected to begin at the end of 2018 or early 2019, but has been postponed since then.\n\nSame-sex couples in Venezuela are unable to legally adopt children. However, lesbian couples are allowed to access IVF.\n\nOn 15 December 2016, the Supreme Tribunal of Justice ruled that a baby boy can be registered in the Venezuelan Civil Registry with the surnames of both his mothers. Basing its ruling on Article 75 of the Constitution, the court declared that the state shall provide protection without distinction to all families, including to children and teenagers born into same-sex families. Additionally, such children must enjoy all the rights and guarantees enshrined to other children born into opposite-sex families. From now on, children with same-sex parents in Venezuela may be registered with the surnames of both their parents, regardless of whether the parents are biological or not.\n\nIn Venezuela, few legal instruments, in some specific areas (workplace, rental housing, and banking system), protect LGBT people from discrimination. However, even when protections do exist these laws lack mechanisms to implement real and effective strategies to prevent discrimination and inequality.\n\nSince 2012, the Organic Labor Law, prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation. Previously, discrimination in labor on the basis of \"sexual option\" was outlawed in 1996.\n\nArticle 4 of the Organic Law of the People's Power (2010), states that \"The Popular Power is designed to ensure the life and welfare of the people, by creating mechanisms for their social and spiritual development, ensuring equal conditions for everyone freely develop their personality, direct their destination, enjoy human rights and attain the supreme social happiness; without discrimination on grounds of ethnic origin, religion, social status, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, language, political opinion, national origin, age, economic status, disability or any other personal, legal or social circumstance which has the effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise of human rights and constitutional guarantees.\"\n\nArticle 173 of the Law for Banking Sector Institutions (2010), includes \"gender identity or expression\" as protected categories against discrimination.\n\nArticle 5 of the Law for the Regulation and Control of Housing Leasing, enacted in 2011, bans discrimination and provides protection to those who are especially vulnerable, or vulnerable to discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity, among others.\n\nIn the process leading up to the adoption of the new 1999 Venezuelan Constitution, anti-discrimination provisions were proposed; however, due to forceful opposition from the Roman Catholic Church, they were dropped from the final draft. In 2001, there were renewed attempts to include them in the Constitution. In 2002, then-President Hugo Chávez voiced his regret for their exclusion, signaling that they may be included in future rounds of constitutional reform.\n\nThe Venezuelan constitutional referendum in 2007 would have outlawed discrimination based on sexual orientation but both of the two reform packages, which covered a wide range of social and economic measures, were narrowly defeated.\n\nMany LGBT groups have proposed to the National Assembly to legislate on equality since 2009 to 2015, the proposed anti-discrimination laws have never been considered in the agenda.\n\nThe state of Mérida prohibits all forms of discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity in its state Constitution.\n\nVenezuelan law does not allow transgender people to change their name and legal gender on official documents.\n\nIn September 2016, the Administrative Service of Identification and Migration Affairs (SAIME), through a petition by the Public Ministry, announced that transgender people may request a new identity card according to their gender identity.\nThe photograph on the identity card will be adequate to the gender that manifests the person, regardless of biological sex.\n\nThe Military Justice Code, in force since 1998, bans same-sex sexual activity.\n\nArticle 565 states \"The official who commits acts that affront or debase their dignity or allow such acts without trying to stop it by means authorized by law, shall be punished with imprisonment of one to three years and separation of the Armed Forces. The same penalty shall apply to any military who commit sexual acts against nature\".\n\nA number of cases have been known in recent years that some members of the military have been harassed or dismissed for being gay.\n\nVenezuela is home to a thriving gay community. Since 2000, the International Day Against Homophobia has been marked, while recently the Government has begun participating in Pride events for the first time. However, police harassment and homophobia in the workplace remain serious problems.\n\nDuring the 2015 parliamentary election, transgender activist Tamara Adrián was elected as Alternate Deputy to the National Assembly for the Popular Will party, becoming the second transgender member of a national legislature in Latin America, after Uruguay's Michelle Suárez Bértora. Adrián has stated in various occasions she intends to push forth legislation to legalize same-sex marriage and enhance the state's protection of LGBT people. Rosmit Mantilla, also an LGBT rights activist from Popular Will and openly gay, was elected as an Alternate Deputy in the 2015 election as well; the two are the first-ever LGBT members of Venezuela's Legislature.\n\nIn May 2016, the National Assembly unanimously approved a resolution establishing 17 May as the International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia and Biphobia, in order to raise awareness in society and to promote the fight against discrimination, stigmatization, violence and denial of rights to individuals on the basis of their sexual orientation or their gender identity or expression. In August 2016, however, the Supreme Court suspended the resolution.\n\nAccording to a Pew Research Center survey, conducted between 8 November 2013 and 12 February 2014, 28% of Venezuelans supported same-sex marriage, 61% were opposed.\n\nA 2013 Pew Research Center opinion survey showed that 51% of Venezuelans believe homosexuality should be accepted by society, while 42% believe it should not. 57% of people between 18 and 29 believe it should be accepted, 51% of people between 30 and 49 and 45% of people over 50.\n\nIn May 2015, PlanetRomeo, a LGBT social network, published its first Gay Happiness Index (GHI). Gay men from over 120 countries were asked about how they feel about society's view on homosexuality, how do they experience the way they are treated by other people and how satisfied are they with their lives. Venezuela was ranked 45th, just above Suriname and below Ecuador, with a GHI score of 48.\n"}
{"id": "1795386", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1795386", "title": "Warriors' Gate", "text": "Warriors' Gate\n\nWarriors' Gate is the fifth serial of the 18th season of the British science fiction television series \"Doctor Who\". It was written by Stephen Gallagher and was first broadcast in four weekly parts on BBC1 from 3 to 24 January 1981.\n\nThe serial is set at an intersection between the universe of E-Space and the home universe of the alien time traveller the Fourth Doctor (Tom Baker). In the serial, the Doctor and his travelling companion Romana (Lalla Ward) seek to free the time-sensitive Tharils from a group of slavers led by Captain Rorvik (Clifford Rose).\n\n\"Warriors' Gate\" is the last of three loosely connected serials set in E-Space. It is the last serial to feature Ward as Romana and the last regular appearance of John Leeson as the voice of K9.\n\nInside the TARDIS, the Fourth Doctor, Romana, Adric, and K9, while travelling between E-Space and the normal universe (N-Space), become trapped in a white null space between the universes. Elsewhere in the void, a slave vessel, run by Captain Rorvik, has also become trapped. It uses members of the leonine Tharil race as their navigators. On becoming stuck, the current navigator, Biroc, escapes the ship and makes his way to the TARDIS on the winds of time. Biroc warns the TARDIS crew of Rorvik's treachery before disappearing. K9's memory wafers are shredded by the winds of time, leaving him functional but lacking long-term memories. The Doctor leaves on his own to explore the null space. He encounters some robots, called Gundans.\n\nMeanwhile, Rorvik and his crew have discovered TARDIS. Romana leaves to talk to them. Rorvik, believing Romana to be time-sensitive like the Tharils, dupes her into returning to their ship to examine the engines. When Romana does not return, Adric and K9 leave to recover her, but get separated; Adric eventually makes it to the ship and hides aboard, while K9 reunites with the Doctor and aids in repairing the Gundan, after which he learns from it that they were built by slaves and used to overthrow their masters in a violent battle. The Doctor's work is disrupted when Rorvik and several of his men arrive. During a stand-off between the crew and the Doctor, another Gundan activates and walks through the seemingly-solid mirror. Rorvik demands an explanation from the Doctor, revealing he has Romana captive, but the Doctor's only response is to walk through the mirror himself.\n\nAboard the slaver ship, Romana is freed by another Tharil named Lazlo, and she hides in the hull. She encounters Adric; the two work out that the ship is made from an incredibly dense dwarf star alloy that can contain the Tharils. K9 arrives, and informs the two of dimensional instability in the null space, which they attribute to the alloy, causing the space to collapse in on itself. Romana rejoins Lazlo, and takes her to the gateway and through the mirror, while Adric remains aboard the ship.\n\nOn the other side of the mirror, the Doctor and Romana are reunited with Biroc in a stable, time-locked universe. A repentant Biroc explains they were the slave masters, travelling on the winds of time in order to ravage other planets and subjugate their populations as slaves until the Gundan revolt. The Doctor and Romana are returned to the null space, and are immediately captured by Rorvik. Rorvik's crew realise that the null space is shrinking as the distances between the gateway, the TARDIS, and slaver ship continue to decrease. Rorvik has ordered the crew to try to blast through the mirrors in gateway, believing it to be the way out, but the mirrors resist all attacks. With the gateway and ship in visible distance of each other, Rorvik resorts to one last attempt to break the mirrors by using the exhaust of the ship's engines against them. While the Doctor warns that this action will be as doomed as the previous ones, Romana regroups with Lazlo and Adric, and together they free the remaining Tharils on the slaver ship. The TARDIS crew flee to the TARDIS as Rorvik initiates his plan—the blast from the engines is reflected by the mirrors back onto the ship, destroying it and its crew.\n\nAs the saved Tharils pass through the mirror, Romana announces that she will be staying with them, having become empathetic to their plight and not wanting to return to Gallifrey. The Doctor gives her K9, as passing through the mirror will restore his memory but he will be unable to return. The Tharils, in exchange, provide the Doctor with information on how to leave the void back to N-Space.\n\nOriginally, the fifth story of season 18 was \"Sealed Orders\" by novelist Christopher Priest before being abandoned. Stephen Gallagher, who had written a number of radio plays, was called upon for a replacement, resulting in \"Warriors' Gate\". Commissioned in March 1980, this was Gallagher's first script for \"Doctor Who\" and had the working title \"Dream Time\". The story was influenced by a radio serial he had done in 1979 called \"The Babylon Run\" as well as the films of Jean Cocteau, such as \"Orphée\" (1950), in which mirrors provide a gateway into another world.\n\nOn completion in June, script editor Christopher H. Bidmead found the scripts to be overlong, as well as needing more work to keep them in line with other stories in the series. Therefore, he and director Paul Joyce re-worked the story significantly, including re-writing much of the dialogue. Originally, the script was much more comedic, with Rorvik's crew being given a lot of humorous dialogue, two of the workers being played as a double-act. Executive producer Barry Letts in particular was against this, saying that it was turning the show into pantomime and stated that the crewmen must be played for real. As many of these lines were cut from the script, the few remaining \"comedy\" lines were to be played straight as well. The scripts were finalised in late August 1980, but were then criticised by Letts, who found them rather confusing. By this time however, there was no more time to rework them further as Bidmead needed to begin work on the following story. Producer John Nathan-Turner too found the story complicated but had not got involved with the story during its scripting stages. Bidmead met with Gallagher with the revised scripts, the latter being none too happy with the extensive changes.\n\n\"Warriors' Gate\" was significant in that it was the last story to feature companion Romana played by Lalla Ward as well as the last regular appearance of John Leeson as long-running companion K9. Ward had requested to leave earlier, having been offered a part in another series, but Nathan-Turner kept her to her contract. It was also during the making of this serial that Tom Baker let it be known that he would leave at the end of the series. Ward and Baker were in a relationship and had been for some time, but by now things were turning acrimonious between the two, with many production personnel believing that they were on the point of splitting-up. It was with much surprise when they learned that just a few weeks later they had married. Leeson, who left the series at the end of Season 16, returned for Season 18 on the understanding that K9 would be written out toward the end of the season.\nJoyce was keen to push the limits of the series by directing the serial like a film as he considered some of the earlier productions to be quite bland and workmanlike. This approach however caused problems early on with significant delays in order to achieve various shots such as the pan through the spaceship in the opening sequence. This included shooting the camera upwards where the gallery lights could be seen - known as \"shooting off set\", something which is forbidden by the BBC. Problems such as this increased as time began to run short and he and producer Nathan-Turner clashed frequently and even executive producer Letts had to step in to advise Joyce. With letters being written to higher executives complaining of Joyce's style of work (also seen as inexperience), Joyce was asked to leave part way through production. His duties were taken up by assistant Graeme Harper, who directed a number of scenes before finally Joyce was re-instated. Setting up of certain shots that Joyce had envisaged proved to take up too much time and shooting over-ran on a number of days. In the end, the serial was completed and was indeed a departure in terms of style over the norm and was complimented by Bidmead, but Joyce was never to work on \"Doctor Who\" again.\n\nBackground photographs utilised in many sequences were taken at Powis Castle, Welshpool.\n\nA novelisation of this serial, written by Stephen Gallagher under the pseudonym \"John Lydecker\", was published by Target Books in April 1982. It and Terminus (Gallagher's other novelisation of his own script under the John Lydecker byline) are the only two Target novels that consist of continuous prose with no chapters. The novelisation contains many elements abandoned during the story's production, including the slaver's opening pursuit and damage at the hands of an Antonine Killer craft.\n\n\"Warriors' Gate\" was released on VHS as part of \"The E-Space Trilogy\" boxed set in November 1997. It was released on DVD in January 2009, again in a boxed set entitled \"The E-Space Trilogy\". This serial was also released as part of the Doctor Who DVD Files (issue 87) in May 2012.\n\n"}

He mentioned the conquerors of the Napaei as the Palaei (6, 50), while in another chapter (6, 22) says that it was the three Scythian tribes of Auchetae, Athernei and Asampatae that defeated them. It is believed that the Spalaei and Palaei are one and the same. Diodorus (2, 43) reported that the Spalaei/Palaei/Pali were descendants of Scythian king Palus, the son of Scythes. The mythical origin and chapter '6, 22' suggests that the Spalaei/Palaei/Pali was a \"collective designation of the eastern branch of Royal Scythians\". By examinating Pliny and Diodorus, the Auchetae (or Euchatae) were part of the Spalaei/Palaei/Pali. Herodotus ( 440 BC) stated that the Scythians or Scoloti consisted of the Auchatae (descending from Lipoxais), Catiaroi and Traspies (from Arpoxais), and Paralatae (from Colaxais), the latter which was \"the youngest of them, the royal race\". Tadeusz Sulimirski believed that they were a branch of the Roxolani. Sulimirski attributed Sarmatian archaeology on the mid-Dnieper to the tribe, supported by the Sarmatians' downfall after the Gothic invasion in 200 AD. The \"Royal Scythian\" connection is supported by Indo-Parthian royal names \"Spalirisos\", \"Spalyris\", \"Spalahora\", and the Slavic word \"ispolin\", \"spolin\" (\"giant\"), assumed to date back to when Slavs were ruled by the Spalaei. Francis Dvornik (1893–1975) believed that the Sporoi mentioned by Procopius (500–560) as being the old name of the Antes and Sclaveni were probably the \"Spali\" mentioned by Jordanes ( 551) and \"Spalei\" mentioned by Pliny.\n\n\n"}

Kaufman. It was adapted from the hit Broadway play of the same name by Teichmann and Kaufman, in which they pillory big business and corrupt businessmen. The film stars Judy Holliday and Paul Douglas. The film is in black-and-white except for the very last scene, which is in Technicolor.\n\nAt a shareholders meeting for International Projects, a billion dollar corporation, John T. Blessington (John Williams) announces he is replacing Edward L. McKeever (Paul Douglas), the company's founder, president and chairman of the board, who is resigning to work for the federal government in Washington D.C. Laura Partridge (Judy Holliday), a minority stockholder with just ten shares of stock, drives its arrogant, self-serving executives to distraction with her incessant questioning during this and subsequent meetings.\n\nBlessington comes up with the idea of hiring the struggling actress as director of shareholder relations to keep her occupied answering letters from small shareholders. He assigns her a secretary, Amelia Shotgraven (Neva Patterson), with secret instructions to obstruct her as much as possible. The conscientious Miss Partridge, upon discovering there is nothing substantial for her to do, decides to write the stockholders herself. She gains Amelia's friendship and wholehearted assistance by helping her develop a romantic relationship with office manager Mark Jenkins (Arthur O'Connell).\n\nWhen the directors find out, they fire Amelia. However, Laura discovers that Blessington's thoroughly unqualified brother-in-law, Harry Harkness (Hiram Sherman), has driven an apparent competitor into bankruptcy, unaware International Projects actually owns the unfortunate company. With that as leverage, she gets Amelia rehired.\n\nStill determined to neutralize Laura, the board decides to send her to Washington to persuade McKeever to give them some government contracts. She agrees to go, with the secret intention of trying to convince him to return and take back control from his crooked cronies. However, the company directors recall that he has divested himself of all his shares and is thus powerless, so they brush him off.\n\nMcKeever takes them to court, arguing that Laura was an unlicensed, illegal lobbyist; but, when she is forced to admit on the stand that she had another, romantic, reason for seeing him, the case is dropped. However, Laura has forged a warm relationship with many of the smaller investors while working at the company; they responded and sent in their proxies, giving her the right to vote their shares. Laura and McKeever use these votes to replace the entire board. They marry. As a gift to \"The Girl Who Has Everything,\" her husband presents her a single solid gold Cadillac for her birthday.\n\n\nBosley Crowther of \"The New York Times\" praised Holliday highly, stating, \"the invincible Miss Holliday has dared to project her youthful figure and personality into the character shaped by Miss Hull\" (Josephine Hull, then in her seventies, played the role in the Broadway play) and is \"knocking the role completely dead.\" However, he felt that the villains of the piece were neither particularly convincing (\"not precisely representatives of the workaday financial world\"), original (\"cut from a fairly familiar stencil of Kaufmanesque farce\"), or formidable enough (\"The problems set up by the play-wrights are little barriers of cardboard farce\"). He concluded, \"it will give you an entertaining ride, but don't expect it to take you or your intelligence very far.\" The Film4 reviewer agreed that the story was not particularly convincing (\"Yeah – like global capitalism gets overthrown that easily\"), but \"even so, it's undemanding and amusing.\"\n\nJean Louis won the Academy Award for Best Costume Design Black and White. Ross Bellah, William Kiernan, and Louis Diage were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Art Direction Black and White.\n\nHolliday was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy, while the film was nominated for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy.\n\n\n"}

It currently broadcasts with country music programming, along with certain sporting events (Cleveland Indians baseball, local high school sports). The station is owned by V-Teck Communications, and is the sister station of WPKO 98.3 FM.\n\nWBLL originally signed on the air in 1951 with the call letters WOHP (for \"Ohio's Highest Point\"). It was the first radio station licensed to Bellefontaine since station WHBD relocated to Mount Orab, Ohio in 1929 (later known as WPAY in Portsmouth, Ohio).\n\nIn the late 1960s, the station's callsign changed to WTOO (for \"Top Of Ohio\"), in 1981 to WTCY (for \"Top (of Ohio) CountrY\"), and then switched back to the WOHP calls on February 14, 1983 with a gospel format.

Its 972 properties housed 1,878 registered electors in 2003. The population increased to 2,326 at the 2011 census. It forms part of the Leicester Urban Area due to its proximity. The parish church of St Mary's has, according to the architectural historian Nicholas Pevsner, \"one of the finest spires in the whole of Leicestershire\".\n\nThe old part of the village, along Main Street, has a mixture of 16th–20th century houses, some of them thatched.\n\nThe Grade II*-listed Queniborough Old Hall in Coppice Lane is a large two-storey country house built in 1675–76 of brick with Swithland slate roofs, to an originally H-shaped plan.\n\nThe newer Queniborough Hall in Main Street was built about 1820 with later additions. It has two storeys of stuccoed brick with a four-bay frontage. Until the First World War it was still occupied by the Lord of the Manor, but it has now been converted into flats.\n\nWhat is now known as Wetherby House was built about 1850 and is believed to have been known as The Beeches. It stands on Syston Road. The house is built of brick with a pitched Swithland slate roof and is listed as of local interest.\n\nThere was no school in the village open to ordinary villagers until 1847. The earlier school, in a small building to the rear of No. 28, Main Street, was only for children whose parents worked on the Queniborough Hall estate. Nos 22–28, Main Street were built between 1790 and 1810 as workers' cottages. The schoolmaster lived at No. 28. The row is still occupied, and the old village school, part of No. 28, now serves as a dining room with a vaulted ceiling.\n\nThe school built in 1847 stands beside the \"Horse and Groom\" pub. This was a free school from the outset, available to the children of all villagers. It is now used as a small swimming pool for the new primary school built in the 1970s. A junior school was built in Coppice Lane and opened in September 1954.\n\nGeorge Shingler (1882–1946), county cricketer, died in Queniborough.\n\nThere are two public houses, the \"Horse and Groom\" and the \"Britannia Inn\", both in the centre of the old part of the village. Next door to the \"Horse and Groom\" is the Queniborough branch of the British Legion, which has a bar and hall.\n\nThe village also has a butcher/delicatessen and a ladies' and gents' hairdresser. The properties in the newer part of the village, from Queniborough Road to Syston Road, are all from the 20th century. Here there is a post office and corner shop, and a newsagent and general store. At the same end of the village stands a village hall completed in 1973, which is used for keep-fit, badminton and other activities, and for a pre-school playgroup. The local Scouts have a hall of their own. The school hall in Coppice Lane is used by Girl Guides, Brownies and Rainbows, and by weight watchers and many other clubs. Winter fairs and other celebrations are also held.\n\nThe village has a sports field marked out mainly for football, for which Queniborough has teams in the junior and senior leagues. The King George playing field is a secure playground for young children, with swings and roundabouts. A recent acquisition is a village tennis court completed in 2005 within the King George playing field.\n\nThere is a public footpath to South Croxton that follows Queniborough Brook.\n\n"}

It is a Grade II listed Georgian terraced house in Spitalfields in the East End, Central London, England. From 1979 to 1999 it was lived in by Dennis Severs, who gradually recreated the rooms as a time capsule in the style of former centuries. It is now open to the public.\n\nThe motto of the house is \"Aut Visum Aut Non!\": \"You either see it or you don't.\"\n\nThe house is on the south side of Folgate Street and dates from approximately 1724. It is one of a terrace of houses (Nos 6-18) built of brown brick with red brick dressings, over four storeys and with a basement. The listing for the house, compiled in 1950, describes No 18 as having a painted facade, and that the first floor [window] frames are enriched with a trellis pattern.\n\nDennis Severs (16 November 1948, Escondido, California – 27 December 1999, London) was drawn to London by what he called \"English light\", and made his home in the dilapidated property in Folgate Street in 1979. This area of the East End of London, next to Spitalfields Market, had become very run-down, and artists had started to move in. Bohemian visual artists Gilbert & George added to the flavour of the neighbourhood; resident there since the late 1960s, they also refurbished a similar house.\n\nSevers started on a programme to refurbish the ten rooms of the house, each in a different historic style, mainly from the 18th and 19th centuries. The rooms are arranged as if they are in use and the occupants have only just left. There are therefore displays of items such as half-eaten bread, and different smells and background sounds for each room. Severs called this \"still life drama\" and wrote:\n\nWoven through the house is the story of the fictional Jervis family (a name anglicised from \"Gervais\"), originally Huguenot (French Protestant immigrants) silk weavers who lived at the house from 1725 to 1919. Each room evokes incidental moments in the lives of these imaginary inhabitants. Writer Peter Ackroyd, author of \"London: the biography\", wrote:\n\nWriter and illustrator Brian Selznick used the house as an inspiration for his 2015 novel \"The Marvels\". The book concludes with a short history and photographs of Dennis Severs. Many of the characters names and story lines are similar to the museum.\n\nJeanette Winterson, who also restored a derelict house nearby to live in, observed, \"Fashions come and go, but there are permanencies, vulnerable but not forgotten, that Dennis sought to communicate\". Painter David Hockney described the house as one of the world's greatest works of opera.\n\nSevers bequeathed the house to the Spitalfields Historic Buildings Trust, an architectural preservation charity, shortly before his death. It is now open to the public, who are asked during their visit to respect the intent of the creator and participate in an imaginary journey to another time.\n\n"}

It is inspired by \"Spawn\" issues 1-99, and Todd McFarlane directed the game's production.\n\nThis gameplay focuses on fast and stylish combat (similar to the \"Devil May Cry\" and \"God of War\" series) gaining high breakable items, Souls, Technique points, comic covers, Time and Ranks. Spawn's main weapon is the Agony Axe (formed by his cape), which can cut through any demon. He is also armed with his trademark chains, which attack with great accuracy and speed. Spawn also finds firearms to use on stronger demons. He is also capable of using various hellish powers, particularly the necroplasm. The game features upgrades; Spawn must collect demon souls in order to buy ammunition, upgrade his weapons and increase his maximum health or necroplasm bar.\n\nThe game starts off with Spawn on a decrepit rooftop above a forgotten chapel in New York City. He then receives flashbacks of his former life, and his betrayal by Jason Wynn. Suddenly, a brilliant green flash of light tears through the city, signaling the demon's war against the angels in battle known as Armageddon. Knocked off the rooftops, Spawn takes to the street not only to answer the call but maybe even to get revenge.\n\nVarious characters from the \"Spawn\" comic book are featured in the game:\nMarilyn Manson's song \"Use Your Fist and Not Your Mouth\" from his 2003 album \"The Golden Age of Grotesque\" is used for the intro video and credits.\n\nThe game received mixed reviews on all platforms according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. The action was criticized for being basic and repetitive, and the combos described as \"lame.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "1795428", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1795428", "title": "Akatsuki (spacecraft)", "text": "Akatsuki (spacecraft)\n\n, also known as the Venus Climate Orbiter (VCO) and Planet-C, is a Japanese (JAXA) space probe tasked to study the atmosphere of Venus. It was launched aboard an H-IIA 202 rocket on 20 May 2010, and failed to enter orbit around Venus on 6 December 2010. After the craft orbited the Sun for five years, engineers successfully placed it into an alternative Venusian elliptic orbit on 7 December 2015 by firing its attitude control thrusters for 20 minutes and made it the first Asian satellite orbiting Venus.\n\nBy using five different cameras working at several wavelengths,\" Akatsuki\" is studying the stratification of the atmosphere, atmospheric dynamics, and cloud physics. Astronomers working on the mission reported detecting a possible gravity wave (not to be confused with gravitational waves) in Venus' atmosphere in December 2015.\n\n\"Akatsuki\" is a Japanese orbiter mission currently studying the planet Venus. Observations include cloud and surface imaging from an orbit around the planet with cameras operating in the infrared, visible and UV wavelengths to investigate the complex Venusian meteorology and elucidate the processes behind the mysterious atmospheric super-rotation. On Venus, while the planet rotates at 6 km/h at the equator, the atmosphere spins around the planet at 300 km/h. Other experiments are designed to confirm the presence of lightning and to determine whether volcanism occurs currently on Venus.\n\n\"Akatsuki\" is Japan's first planetary exploration mission since the failed Mars orbiter \"Nozomi\" probe which was launched in 1998. \"Akatsuki\" was originally intended to conduct scientific research for two or more years from an elliptical orbit around Venus ranging from in altitude, but its alternate orbit had to be highly elliptical ranging between 1,000 km and 10,000 km at its nearest point and about 360,000 km at its farthest. This larger orbit takes 10 days to complete instead of the originally planned 30 hours. The budget for this mission is ¥14.6 billion () for the satellite and ¥9.8 billion (US$116 million) for the launch.\n\nThe main bus is a box with two solar arrays, each with an area of about . The solar arrays provide over 700 W of power while in Venus orbit. The total mass of the spacecraft at launch was . The mass of the science payload is .\n\nPropulsion is provided by a bi-propellant, hydrazine-dinitrogen tetroxide orbital maneuvering engine and twelve mono-propellant hydrazine reaction control thrusters, eight with of thrust and four with . It is the first spacecraft to use a ceramic (silicon nitride) retrofire thruster. The total propellant mass at launch was .\n\nCommunication is via an 8 GHz, 20-watt X-band transponder using the high-gain antenna. The high-gain antenna is flat to prevent heat from building up in it. \"Akatsuki\" also has a pair of medium-gain horn antennas mounted on turntables and two low-gain antennas for command uplink. The medium-gain horn antennas are used for housekeeping data downlink when the high-gain antenna is not facing Earth.\n\nThe scientific payload consists of six instruments. The five imaging cameras are exploring Venus in wavelengths from ultraviolet to the mid-infrared:\n\nA public relations campaign was held between October 2009 and January 2010 by the Planetary Society and JAXA, to allow individuals to send their name and a message aboard \"Akatsuki\". Names and messages were printed in fine letters on an aluminium plate and placed aboard \"Akatsuki\". 260,214 people submitted names and messages for the mission. Around 90 aluminium plates were created for the spacecraft, including three aluminium plates in which the images of the Vocaloid Hatsune Miku and her super deformed figure Hachune Miku were printed.\n\n\"Akatsuki\" left the Sagamihara Campus on 17 March 2010, and arrived at the Tanegashima Space Center's Spacecraft Test and Assembly Building 2 on 19 March. On 4 May, \"Akatsuki\" was encapsulated inside the large payload fairing of the H-IIA rocket that launched the spacecraft, along with the IKAROS solar sail, on a 6-month journey to Venus. On 9 May, the payload fairing was transported to the Tanegashima Space Center's Vehicle Assembly Building, where the fairing was mated to the H-IIA launch vehicle itself.\n\nThe spacecraft was launched on 20 May 2010 at 21:58:22 (UTC) from the Tanegashima Space Center, after being delayed because of weather from its initial 18 May scheduled target.\n\n\"Akatsuki\" was planned to initiate orbit insertion operations by igniting the orbital maneuvering engine at 23:49:00 on 6 December 2010 UTC. The burn was supposed to continue for twelve minutes, to an initial Venus orbit with an apoapsis of , a periapsis of , and a four-day orbital period.\n\nThe orbit insertion maneuver was confirmed to have started on time, but after the expected blackout due to occultation by Venus, the communication with the probe did not recover as planned. The probe was found to be in safe-hold mode, spin-stabilized state with ten minutes per rotation. Due to the low communication speed through the low-gain antenna, it took a while to determine the state of the probe. JAXA stated on 8 December that the probe's orbital insertion maneuver had failed. At a press conference on 10 December, officials reported that \"Akatsuki\"s engines fired for less than three minutes, far less than what was required to enter into Venus orbit. Further research found that the likely reason for the engine malfunction was salt deposits jamming the valve between the helium pressurization tank and the fuel tank. As a result, engine combustion became oxidizer-rich, with resulting high combustion temperatures damaging the combustion chamber throat and nozzle. A similar vapor leakage problem destroyed the NASA Mars Observer probe in 1993.\n\nAs a result, the probe was in a heliocentric orbit, rather than Venus orbit. Since the resulting orbit had an orbital period of 203 days, shorter than Venus' orbital period of 225 days, the probe drifted around the Sun compared to Venus.\n\nJAXA developed plans to attempt another orbital insertion burn when the probe returned to Venus in December 2015. This required placing the probe into \"hibernation\" or safe mode to prolong its life beyond the original 4.5-year design. JAXA expressed some confidence in keeping the probe operational, pointing to reduced battery wear, since the probe was then orbiting the Sun instead of its intended Venusian orbit.\n\nTelemetry data from the original failure suggested that the throat of its main engine, the orbit maneuver engine (OME) was still largely intact, and trial jet thrusts of the probe's onboard OME were performed twice, on 7 and 14 September 2011. However, the thrust was only about , which was 10% of expectations. Following these tests, it was determined that insufficient specific impulse would be available for orbital maneuvering by the OME. It was concluded that the remaining combustion chamber throat was completely destroyed by transient ignition of the engine. As a result, the selected strategy was to use four hydrazine attitude control thrusters, also called reaction control system (RCS), to drive the probe into orbit around Venus. Because the RCS thrusters do not need oxidiser, the remaining 65 kg of oxidiser (MON) was vented overboard in October 2011 to reduce the mass of the spacecraft.\n\nThree peri-Venus orbital maneuvers were executed on 1 November, 10 and 21 November 2011 using the RCS thrusters. A total delta-\"v\" of 243.8 m/s was imparted to the spacecraft. Because the RCS thrusters' specific impulse is low compared to the specific impulse of the OME, the previously planned insertion into low Venusian orbit became impossible. Instead, the new plan was to place the probe in a highly elliptical orbit with an apoapsis of a hundred thousand kilometers and a periapsis of a few thousand kilometers from Venus. Engineers planned for the alternate orbit to be prograde (in the direction of the atmospheric super-rotation) and lie in the orbital plane of Venus. The method and orbit were announced by JAXA in February 2015, with an orbit insertion date of 7 December 2015. The probe reached its most distant point from Venus on 3 October 2013 and had been approaching the planet since then.\n\nAfter performing the last of a series of four trajectory correction maneuvers between 17 July and 11 September 2015, the probe was established on a trajectory to fly past Venus on 7 December 2015, when \"Akatsuki\" would make a maneuver to enter Venus orbit after a 20-minute burn with four thrusters that were not rated for such a hefty propulsive maneuver. Instead of taking about 30 hours to complete an orbit around Venus—as was originally planned—the new orbit targeted would place \"Akatsuki\" in a nine-day orbit after an adjustment in March 2016.\n\nAfter JAXA engineers measured and calculated its orbit following the 7 December orbital insertion, JAXA announced on 9 December that \"Akatsuki\" had successfully entered the intended elliptical orbit, as far as from Venus, and as close as from Venus's surface with an orbital period of 13 days and 14 hours.\n\nA follow-up thruster burn on 26 March 2016 lowered \"Akatsuki\"'s apoapsis to about and shortened its orbital period from 13 to 9 days.\n\nThe orbiter started its two-year period of \"regular\" science operations in mid-May 2016. Since 9 December 2016, the near-infrared 1-μm and 2-μm cameras have been unavailable for observations due to an electronic failure. Its long-wave infrared camera, ultraviolet imager, and lightning and airglow camera continue normal operation.\n\nBy April 2018, \"Akatsuki\" finished its regular observation phase, and entered an extended operation phase. Extended operations are approved until the end of 2020, with further mission extensions to be considered based on the spacecraft's condition at that time. \"Akatsuki\" has enough fuel to continue operating for at least 2 more years as of November 2019.\n\nThree hours after insertion in December 2015 and in \"a few glimmers in April and May\" 2016 the craft's instruments recorded a \"bow-shape feature in the atmosphere stretching 6,000 miles, almost pole to pole — a sideways smile\". Scientists on the project termed the feature a \"gravity wave\" in the planet's winds above Aphrodite Terra, \"a highland region about the size of Africa that rises up to three miles from the surface\". The mission is collecting data in all relevant spectral bands from ultraviolet (280 nm) to mid-infrared wavelengths (10 μm).\n\nImages from the \"Akatsuki\" orbiter revealed something similar to jet stream winds in the low and middle cloud region, which extends from 45 to 60 kilometers in altitude. The wind speed maximized near the equator. In September 2017 JAXA scientists named this phenomenon 'Venusian equatorial jet'. They also published results on equatorial winds at cloud-top level by tracking clouds on the UV spectrum. A significant result in 2018 is the appearance of thick clouds of small particles near the transition between upper and middle clouds, what was described as a \"new and puzzling morphology of the complex cloud cover.\" By 2017, the science team published 3D maps on the Venus atmosphere structure. The physical quantities retrieved include the pressure, the temperature, the vapor density, and the ionospheric electron density and their variations. By the year 2019, the first results about the morphology, temporal changes and the winds at the middle clouds of Venus were published and merited the cover in Geophysical Research Letters, reporting unexpectedly high contrasts that might indicate the presence of absorbers like water.\n\nTo image lightning, the orbiter has sight of the dark side of Venus for about 30 minutes every 10 days. As of July 2019, it has accumulated 16.8 hours of observations of the night side, and no lightning has been detected.\n\n\n"}

The Roman road known as the Fosse Way passes through Syston, which is now largely a commuter town for the city of Leicester. Only the village of Thurmaston to the south separates it from Leicester.\n\nThe large and impressive Church of St Peter and St Paul is the most ancient building in Syston, built in pink granite and white limestone with a proud west tower topped by a lozenge frieze, battlements and pinnacles. The church mostly dates from the 15th century but there is a 13th-century sedilia in the chancel and a tomb recess in the south aisle of the early 14th century. The stone arcading inside the nave has striking Perpendicular Gothic panelling which is also seen on the tower arch and in the clerestory. The nave roof of timber is also 15th century. The local architect Frederick Webster Ordish (1821-1885) extensively restored the church in 1871-72 and in 1881 he extended the nave by one bay and rebuilt the chancel. Ordish lived at Queniborough Old Hall. In 1855 he had added the upper storey, with its tower and bridge staircase, to the Corn Exchange in Leicester Market Place. He died as a result of an accident near the old Syston railway station in September 1885.\n\nThe Midland Main Line runs through the town.

{"id": "1795443", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1795443", "title": "WPKO-FM", "text": "WPKO-FM\n\nWPKO-FM (98.3 FM) is an American radio station in Bellefontaine, Ohio. It is programmed in a Hot AC radio format, and is almost entirely locally produced. The station is owned by V-Teck Communications, and is the sister station to WBLL 1390 AM.\n\nWPKO originally signed on the air on June 1, 1969 with the call letters WOGM (for \"Ohio's Good Music\") before switching to WTOO-FM with a contemporary hit format on June 1, 1978 as \"Stereo Too 98\" . The station became WPKO-FM on February 19, 1988. For a time, the -FM suffix was required as part of the call letters to differentiate the station from its AM sister station, now known as WBLL. While this remains the station's official call letters, the station now is commonly known as WPKO.\n\nOn January 6, 2005, a major ice storm caused a loss of power to the broadcast facilities. As a result, WPKO was knocked off the air for several hours. V-Teck Communications has recently obtained emergency power generators to ensure this does not happen again.\n\n"}
{"id": "1795445", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1795445", "title": "LGBT rights in Chile", "text": "LGBT rights in Chile\n\nLesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) civil rights in Chile have seen remarkable advances in recent years, though LGBT people still face some legal and social obstacles not experienced by non-LGBT Chileans. Both male and female same-sex sexual activity is legal in Chile. Since 2012, the law bans all discrimination and hate crimes based on sexual orientation and gender identity. Since then, the Chilean Armed Forces allow to openly serve gays, lesbians and bisexuals. LGBT people are allowed to donate blood without restrictions since 2013.\n\nSince 22 October 2015, same-sex couples and households headed by same-sex couples have the same legal protections available to opposite-sex married couples, within a civil union - except for adoption rights and the title of marriage.\n\nSince 1974, the change of gender has been possible in the country through a judicial process. The Gender Identity Law, in effect since 2019, recognizes the right to self-perceived gender identity, allowing people over 14 years to change their name and gender in documents without prohibitive requirements.\n\nAccording to several surveys, Chilean society majority supports the recognition of the rights of LGBTI people.\n\nAdult, consensual, non-commercial, same-sex sexual activity has been legal in Chile since 1999, but the liberalization of the criminal code created an unequal age of consent and did not modify vague public indecency laws, which have been used to harass LGBT people in Chile.\n\nIn Chile, the age at which there are no restrictions for sexual activities is 18, while the minimum age of consent is 14. Limitations exist between 14 and 18 years old (Art. 362 Chilean Penal Code). Even when not clearly stated in Article 362, later on, in Article 365, homosexual activity is declared illegal with anyone under 18 years old.\n\nThere also exists in the Chilean Penal Code, a legal figure called \"estupro\". This figure establishes some limitations to sexual contacts with children older than 14 and younger than 18 years old. The \"estupro\" legislation (Article 363) defines four situations in which sex with such a children can be declared illegal even if the minor consented to the relationship (non-consensual sex with anyone older than 14 y.o. falls under the rape legislation, Article 361; while any sexual contact with anyone under 14 y.o. falls under the statutory rape legislation, Article 362.):\n\n\nThe sexual acts regulated by Articles 361 (rape), 362 (statutory rape), 363 (\"estupro\") and 365 (homosexual sex) are defined as \"carnal access\" (\"acceso carnal\"), which means either oral, anal or vaginal intercourse. Other articles within the penal code regulate other sexual interactions (Articles 365 bis, 366, 366 bis, 366 ter, 366 quarter). Article 365 bis, regulates the \"introduction of objects\" either in the anus, vagina or mouth. Article 366 bis, defines \"sexual act\" as any relevant act with sexual significance accomplished by physical contact with the victim, or affecting the victim's genitals, anus or mouth even when no physical contact occurred.\n\nArticle 369 states that charges relating to these offenses (Articles 361 to 365) can be brought only after a complaint by the minor or the minor's parent, guardian or legal representative. Nevertheless, if the offended party cannot freely file the complaint and lacks a legal representative, parent or guardian, or if the legal representative, parent or guardian is involved in the crime, the Public Ministry may proceed by its own.\n\nIn 1810, the age of consent for opposite-sex activity was 12. In 1999, the age of consent was set at 14 for both girls and boys in relation to heterosexual sex. Homosexual acts were decriminalized in 1999, with an age of consent of 18. In 2011, the \"Tribunal Constitucional de Chile\" confirmed that the age of consent is 14 for heterosexual relations (for both girls and boys), as well as for lesbian relations (Woman-girl), but it is 18 for male homosexual relations. In August 2018, the Constitutional Court again rejected that Article 365 of the Criminal Code was unconstitutional, in a 5-5 vote, validating for the second time in its history that the age of consent for gay men is 18, while for heterosexuals and lesbians is 14 years old.\n\nIn July 2019, the Chamber of Deputies unanimously approved a bill repealing article 365 that if enacted it would establish a universal age of consent set at 14, regardless of gender or sexual orientation. The bill is currently being discussed in the Senate.\n\nIn March 2015, the Ministry of Foreign affairs issued a circular that recognizes same-sex civil unions and equal marriages performed abroad for residency matters. Chile has recognised civil unions since 22 October 2015.\n\nChile's civil union laws enable same-sex and opposite-sex cohabitating couples to co-own property and make medical decisions as well as claim pension benefits and inherit property if their civil partner dies. Gaining custody of a partner's child where necessary is also made easier by the law. The new law recognises marriages performed abroad as civil unions and views couples and their children as a family.\n\nIn August 2011, President Sebastián Piñera introduced a bill to Congress allowing registered cohabitation. After four years of debate and improved provisions added during Michelle Bachelet's administration, the bill was passed in both houses on 28 January 2015. On 13 April 2015, the bill was signed into law by President Bachelet and was published in the Official Gazette on 21 April 2015. It took effect on 22 October 2015.\n\nOn 1 December 2016, the Chamber of Deputies unanimously approved (except for 6 abstentions) a bill to give couples who enter in a civil union five days off, like couples who marry have. The bill was approved by the Senate in October 2017, in a unanimous 15-0 vote. It took effect on 8 November 2017.\n\nOn 28 August 2017, President Michelle Bachelet introduced the Marriage Equality Bill, fulfilling an election promise and as part of the \"Friendly Settlement Agreement\" signed in June 2016 by the State of Chile with the Movement for Homosexual Integration and Liberation (Movilh), in the context of a lawsuit filed before the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (CIDH), involving the lack of access to civil marriage by three same-sex couples in Chile.\n\nThe bill would have amended the definition of marriage of article 102 of the Civil Code, replacing the phrase that determines it as the union \"between a man and a woman\", by \"the union between two people\". In addition, the measure contemplates the right of joint adoption and filiation (automatic parenthood) for same-sex couples. As of January 2020, the bill is still under debate.\n\nChilean law stipulates that single people are allowed to adopt, regardless of their sexual orientation. Same-sex couples are allowed to apply to adopt. If applicants are approved as suitable to adopt, legally only one of them would be the legal parent of the child. For same-sex couples, within a civil union or not, that raise a child together, if the legal parent (because of birth or adoption) dies, it is easier for the surviving parent to get custody of the partner's child. In Chile, families or individuals interested in adopting must apply and be approved by Sename (National Service for Minors), which keeps the registry of children eligible for adoption. Final approval is granted by the Family Court. According to studies done by Movilh, 10 percent of same-sex couples declare having children in Chile. In 86% of cases, lesbian mothers have custody of their children, while only 33% when it comes to gays parents.\n\nIn addition, filiation is defined by birth, therefore, same-sex couples can not recognize a child in the birth certificate. In March 2015, a lesbian mother filed a voluntary petition to a Family Court to have her daughter legally recognized as the daughter of her partner. In November 2015, the Supreme Court ruled against the two mothers, by a vote of three to two. In April 2016, the Filiation Regulation for Children of Same Sex Families bill was introduced into the Senate. If passed, the bill would offer three pathways to legally recognize the filiation of same-sex parents to their children.\n\nThe Marriage Equality bill introduced in August 2017 by President Bachelet, would allow joint adoption to married same-sex couples and filiation (automatic parenthood), for both married and unmarried same-sex couples.\nIn September 2017, ten MPs introduced a bill to allow adoption by same-sex couples within a civil union.\n\nCurrently in 2019, Chile's Congress is debating the \"Bill of the Integral Reform of the Adoption System in Chile\" that would allow adoption by same-sex couples. On May 8, 2019, the Chamber of Deputies passed the bill by 104 votes in favor, 35 against and 4 abstentions, allowing joint and step-parent adoption by same-sex couples, within a marriage, civil union or not, and banning discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity in the process of adoption. Two amendments that were presented by the Government were rejected which sought to establish at all events that the opposite-sex couples of \"father and mother\" should be privileged, over same-sex couples, but another \"discriminatory\" amendment was successfully introduced stating that \"if the child or adolescent expresses his will to have a father and a mother, the judge must consider it preferentially.\" The bill now moves to the Senate.\n\nThere are no laws that guarantee or protect the right to access to assisted reproductive technology. Lesbian couples may access to IVF treatments, though they do not have medical insurance coverage due they do not have an infertility pathology.\n\nCurrently in Chile, there is no specific legislation on surrogacy. In January 2018, a bill to allow altruistic surrogacy for same-sex couples and to ban commercial surrogacy for all couples was introduced to Congress.\n\nIn 2014, a children’s book addressing same-sex parent families was published. The book is currently being distributed to pre-school kids in public kindergartens in Chile. Despite being backed by the Chilean government, \"Nicolás Has Two Dads\" is not compulsory reading material for kindergartens throughout the country.\n\n\"Nicolás Has Two Dads\" (\"Nicolás tiene dos papás\"), written by Movilh, tells the story of Nicolás, a little boy who lives with his two fathers. From sleepovers and trips to the stadium to reunions with his biological mother and explaining to his classmates why he has two dads, Nicolás leads readers through his everyday life.\n\nThe book is sponsored by The National Kindergarten Board (Junji), the Association of Toddler Educators, the National Directorate of Libraries, Archives and Museums, and the Departments of Psychology and Early Childhood and Basic Education of the University of Chile.\n\nIn Chile there are different laws, regulations and public policies that protect LGBT people from discrimination. However, according to Movilh's Annual Reports on the Human Rights of Sexual Diversity, each year more cases are reported because there is more empowerment among gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people to fight for their rights and to denounce discriminatory acts.\n\nArticle 373 of the Penal Code, based on the \"offenses to morals and good customs\" has been for years the only legal standard that has used the police to harass homosexuals, even for behavior such as holding hands in public. In 2010, the bill to repeal the article was rejected in the Constitution, Law and Justice Committee of the Chamber of Deputies. Nevertheless, the XIV version of the Annual Report on the Human Rights of Sexual Diversity in Chile for the year 2015, emphasizes in one of its chapters on police abuses and arbitrary arrests by mentioning that \"for the first time in seven years no police abuses were reported against lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender people.\" A positive reality that has been influenced by the work of the Human Rights Department of Carabineros, which reacted rapidly to any suspicious denunciation of homophobia and transphobia, and promote, among officials, various training lectures.\n\nThe law in effect since 2012, imposes penalties for acts of discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity, and since 2018 gender expression. It allows citizens to file anti-discrimination lawsuits and requires the State to develop public policies to end discrimination. It describes as illegal discrimination \"any distinction, exclusion or restriction that lacks reasonable justification, committed by agents of the state or individuals, and that causes the deprivation, disturbance or threatens the legitimate exercise of fundamental rights.\" The law is colloquially known as the Zamudio law, in honor of Daniel Zamudio.\n\nIn Chile, the relationship between suppliers of goods or services and consumers is regulated by Law No. 19,496 on the Protection of the Rights of Consumers. Article 3 states that are basic rights of the consumer, among others, the right to non-discrimination. The anti-discrimination law enacted in 2012 defines discrimination and includes protection against it on grounds of sexual orientation, gender identity and gender expression.\n\nIn December 2012, in the first ruling under the anti-discrimination law, a judge ordered a motel to pay a fine to a lesbian couple for refusing them entry, and ordered that it can't refuse entry on another occasion.\nThe Third Civil Court of Santiago was emphatic in saying that denying services or products based on sexual orientation or gender identity was illegal.\n\nSince 2016, the Labor Code explicitly prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. The Labor Inclusion Law enacted in May 2017, which also amends the Law on Administrative Statute, prohibits any act of arbitrary discrimination resulting in exclusions or restrictions, based on sexual orientation and gender identity.\n\nIn 2004, the authorities announced that the rules of non-discrimination guaranteed in labor law also apply to the sexual minorities. In 2007, The Department of Labor made possible, through the implementation of the new politics, to make reports of discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. The change came from a petition by Movilh and originated from an event in 2007 when an employee did the first report of this kind in a governmental instance. In June 2014, The Department of Labor officially updated the \"Principles regarding the right to non-discrimination\" set out in the Labour Code, according to the effects of the anti-discrimination law that includes sexual orientation and gender identity as protected classes.\n\nIn December 2015, a court ordered the Municipality of Talca to compensate three former employees who had been dismissed because of their sexual orientation. The court ruling also requires the Mayor Juan Castro Prieto and other officials to be trained in human rights.\n\nThe General Law of Education (LGE) promulgated in 2009, included the principles of non-discrimination and respect to diversity. The Ministry of Education launched in 2010 the School Coexistence Regulation, which points out the importance of eradicating the discrimination against LGBT people in the classroom.\n\nIn September 2011, Chile's Congress approved \"The Law about School Violence\" that amended the General Law of Education to establish definitions, procedures, and penalties for school violence and bullying. The law has a positive impact on the fight against homophobia and transphobia in the classroom. Educational institutions are required to create a Good School Coexistence Committee which will be responsible for managing and take all necessary measures to ensure a non-violent school life.\n\nIn 2013, the Superintendence of Education updated the Handbook for educational establishments on Rules of Procedure with regard to school coexistence, which orders the non-discriminatory treatment concerning students based on their sexual orientation or gender identity, and indicates that the regulation of all schools must sanction any act of discrimination between members of the school community.\n\nIn 2015, two new policies of the Ministry of Education recognized the importance of promoting the rights of LGBTI people in classrooms. The National School Coexistence Policy 2015-2018 guarantees non-discrimination for sexual diversity and it is incorporated into the School Calendar 2016 the \"International Day Against Homophobia and Transphobia.\" The Ministry of Education recommends to schools develop educational, artistic, cultural or sports activities in commemoration of the date.\n\nThe School Inclusion law, that took effect in March 2016, guarantees non-discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity, mentioning the anti-discrimination law.\n\nSince 2015, the Civil union law officially recognises same-sex couples as a family, and offers protection in access to housing.\nThe Ministry of Housing and Town Planning issued an instruction in 2009 which officially extended the benefit of housing allowance to couples made up of people of the same sex. The Minister Patricia Poblete said that discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity is not allowed in any of the services offered by her ministry, so gay couples can apply, without problems, housing subsidies. In 2013 it was confirmed that the \"rent subsidy\" program benefits all families and young couples regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity.\n\nSince 2016, the \"Household Social Register\" recognizes same-sex cohabiting couples. It is an information system whose objective is to support the nomination and selection of beneficiaries of institutions and government agencies that provide social benefits.\n\nIn 2012, the Anti-discrimination law amended the Criminal Code adding a new aggravating circumstance of criminal responsibility, as follows: \"Committing or participating in a crime motivated by ideology, political opinion, religion or beliefs of the victim; nation, race, ethnic or social group; sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, age, affiliation, personal appearance or suffering from illness or disability.\" \n\nIn July 2017, ten MPs introduced a bill to amend the Criminal Code to incorporate the crime of incitement to hatred or violence against people based on sexual orientation and gender identity, among other distinctions.\nOn 4 September 2017, Michelle Bachelet introduced a bill to Congress which would criminalize incitement to violence against a person or a group of people, based on race, national or ethnic origin, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion or beliefs. The law will also amend the Press Law and the Law on Criminal Responsibility of Legal Entities.\n\nOn January 9, 2020, the Chamber of Deputies passed the bill outlawing incitement to hatred or violence and hate speech against people based on sexual orientation, gender identity and gender expression.\n\nIn November 2016, President Michelle Bachelet enacted the Anti-torture law establishing criminal penalties for torture and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment. It covers physical, psychological abuse and sexual violence, and includes sexual orientation and gender identity as protected categories. The law aims to punish people in public service positions, both public employee or private individuals in public service, who instigate, carry out or hide knowledge of torture.\n\nBill on \"System of Guarantees of Rights of the Childhood,\" includes protection from discrimination towards LGBTI children and adolescents. On 2 May 2017, the plenary session of the Chamber of Deputies approved the bill including LGBTI categories. The bill now heads to the Senate for discussion.\n\nArticle 9 of the bill states that \"no child shall be arbitrarily discriminated against because of their sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression and sex characteristics,\" among other distinctions.\n\nThe Migration and Immigration bill bans discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. The Chamber of Deputies passed the bill on January 16, 2019.\n\nThe bill on Gender Violence establishes the right of women to a life free of violence. The purpose of this law is to prevent, punish and eradicate violence against women, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity, among others. Also, it amends the Penal Code and the Intrafamily Violence law to include same-sex couples. The Chamber of Deputies passed the bill on January 17, 2019.\n\nThe so-called Gabriela's Law (N° 21.212), named for Gabriela Alcaino, was signed into law on March 2, 2020. It extends the legal definition of femicide to any person who commits a gender-motivated homicide of a woman. It defines crimes against women as any that “represent a manifestation of hatred, contempt or abuse because of gender,” and covers physical, sexual, economic, institutional, political and workplace violence. The definition also extends to the death of a woman when it occurs due to sexual orientation, gender identity or gender expression of the victim.\n\nSince 2010, Law 20.418 on the Right to education, information and guidance on Fertility states that \"everyone has the right to confidentiality and privacy about their sexual options and behaviors, as well as the methods and therapies they choose for the regulation or planning of their sexual life.\"\n\nIn May 2014, Law 20.750 on the Introduction of Digital Terrestrial Television was enacted. The law creates the National Television Council whose main function is to ensure the proper functioning of television services. It is understood by the correct functioning of these services the permanent respect, through its programming, to pluralism. For the purposes of this law, pluralism will be understood as \"respect for social, cultural, ethnic, political, religious, gender, sexual orientation and gender identity diversity, and it shall be the duty of the concessionaires and permit holders of TV services regulated by this law to observe these principles.\"\n\nIn December 2015, President Michelle Bachelet signed a decree to set up the Office of the Undersecretary of Human Rights and establish an Inter-ministerial Human Rights Committee. It provides for a National Human Rights Plan that seeks to prevent discrimination, with specific reference to the anti-discrimination law that protects LGBT people in Chile.\n\nIn Chile, transgenderism is often associated with homosexuality. In the early part of the twenty-first century, the legal rights of transgender people in Chile has begun to improve and be legally recognized. Since 2012, Law No. 20,609 expressly recognizes the legal protection of gender identity, banning discrimination on that basis and adding it as an aggravating factor of criminal responsibility. Since 2019, the Gender Identity Law allow transgender people over the age of 14 to legally change their name and gender on all official documents. Before, the change of name and legal gender were possible through a judicial process. According to official data from the Civil Registry and Identification Service, between 2007 and 2016, 186 people have changed their gender.\n\nLaw 21.120, which recognizes and protects the right to gender identity, introduced in 2013 and enacted in 2018, establishes a legal procedure that allows the change of name and registered sex in all official documents. For unmarried persons over 18 years of age, the change is requested by submitting a request to the Civil Registry and Identification Service, without being required to prove hormone replacement therapy or undergo sex reassignment surgery.\n\nChildren under 18 and over 14 years old must complete the process before family courts, either through their legal parent or representative or by themselves, if the judge accepts the latter option. For such effects, antecedents on the psychosocial and family context of the adolescent and their relatives must be presented. Children under 14 years of age, although they will not be able to make a gender change through the law, are recognized as transgender.\n\nThe Law guarantees as basic principles non-pathologization, non-arbitrary discrimination, confidentiality, dignity in the treatment, the best interests of the child and progressive autonomy. In addition, to become effective, the law establishes the creation of two regulations that include gender transition accompaniment programs for minors, and another on the requirements and accreditation for the change of name and registered sex. Finally, \"gender expression\" is added as a protected category to the Anti-discrimination Law.\n\nAfter five years of debate in Congress, on September 5, 2018, the Senate approved the bill by 26 votes in favor and 14 against. On September 12 the Chamber of Deputies did the same with 95 in favor and 46 against. On October 25, 2018, the Constitutional Court declares the constitutionality of the approved law. On November 28, 2018, President Sebastián Piñera signs and enact the law. On December 10, 2018, the law is published in the Official Gazette. The two regulations for the law to take effect were published in August 2019. The law took effect on December 27, 2019.\n\nIn 1974, Marcia Alejandra Torres became the first person in Chile to legally change her name and gender on the birth certificate. Previously, in May 1973, Marcia was the first person in the country to undergo a sex reassignment surgery.\n\nUntil 2018, in Chile there was no specific law in force that regulates a procedure, nor specific requirements, to achieve the change of legal gender in the documents. A legal process must be initiated before a Civil Court, making use of the procedure to change the name of Law Nº 17,344. There must be presented a number of witnesses, and according to the requirements of each judge attach psychological and psychiatric evaluations, and certificates evidencing eventual surgical interventions or hormone replacement therapy. The resolution of the sentence is at the discretion of the Court, which may eventually approve only the change of name, leaving the sex assigned at birth, or modify both.\n\nIn 2007, trans activist Andrés Rivera and a transgender woman were allowed, by judicial order, to change their name and gender on legal documents. In both cases, for the first time, surgery was not a requirement. Several court rulings have allowed the change of name and gender on birth certificates, where a sex reassignment surgery has not been a requirement for the judge.\n\nThe LGBT rights group Movilh achieved in 2001 that the Civil Register made an announcement that made possible for transsexuals in Chile to obtain their identity documentation without having to change their appearance. In 2009 the National Organization of Gendarmeries ordered the end to disciplinary sanctions against inmates which prevented them to dress accordingly to their gender identity.\n\nIn 2011 the Ministry of Health approved a circular which obliged to call and register transsexuals by their social name in all care centers in Chile and launched the first protocol which at nation level regulated the medical procedures of body alteration. This was preceded by a pilot plan for free medical attention for transsexuals put in action by the Ministry of Health through a proposal of Movilh.\nIn 2002 some offices had already established a certain health record for transsexuals so that they could receive care adequate of their gender identity.\n\nSince 2013, sex reassignment surgeries and hormone therapy are funded by the public health system (Fondo Nacional de Salud).\n\nEven before the law was passed in November 2018, some transgender children changed their name and gender on legal documents with judicial permission. Requirements could vary at the judge's discretion, and some cases were made public.\n\nIn April 2017, the Ministry of Education issued a ministerial circular entitled \"Rights of girls, boys and trans students in the field of education.\" The document, addressed to school administrations nationwide, points out that failure to comply with the measures constitutes an infraction that will be sanctioned according to its seriousness. Some of the required measures for schools include: guaranteeing the social name of trans students in all fields; guaranteeing the right to wear uniforms, sports clothes or accessories according to their gender identity; and providing bathroom and shower facilities that respect the gender identity of trans students.\n\nThe bill \"System of Guarantees of Rights of the Childhood\" recognizes the right of children and adolescents to develop their gender identity. Article 19 based on \"Identity\" states that \"every child has the right, from birth, to have a name, a nationality and a language of origin; to know the identity of their fathers and/or mothers; to preserve their family relations in accordance with the law; to know and practice the culture of their place of origin and, in general, to preserve and develop their own identity and idiosyncrasy, including their gender identity.\"\n\nAccording to the Civil Registry and Identification Service, between 2006 and 2017, 269 intersex children have been registered under the category of \"indeterminate sex\" on official records. In January 2016, the Chilean Ministry of Health temporarily ordered the suspension of normalization treatments on intersex children. The guidelines ended in August 2016. Anti-discrimination legislation is before the Senate.\n\nThe Military of Chile does not discriminate on grounds of sexual orientation and gender identity. It officially prohibits discrimination against LGBT people.\n\nIn 2012, the commander-in-chief of the Chilean Army Juan Miguel Fuente-Alba, reported the repeal of all rules and regulations that prevented LGBT people from entering the Armed Forces. On 10 September 2012, by Order of Command No. 6583/126, it was declared expressly repealed all those rules or provisions of institutional regulations, which contravene the principle of non-discrimination according to the Anti-discrimination law.\n\nIn 2014, the Ministry of National Defense, established the Committee for Diversity and Non-Discrimination which will aim to advance concrete measures to eradicate discrimination and arbitrary exclusions in the military. The instance, which is composed of representatives of all branches of the Military of Chile, expressly prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. The resolution, signed by Defense Minister Jorge Burgos, established the government as responsible for creating a more inclusive armed services.\n\nThe same year, sailor Mauricio Ruiz became the first serving member of the Armed Forces to publicly assume his homosexuality. Ruiz said that what was most important was not a soldier's sexual orientation, but his or her willingness to serve the country. His announcement came with the full backing of the Chilean Navy.\n\nOn 29 May 2015, the commander-in-chief Humberto Oviedo, aware that the anti-discrimination issue requires a more specific regulation, and indeed a cultural change within the army, issued an Order of Command to expand and complement the 2012 order that had repealed all rules contrary to the Anti-discrimination law. It was established emphatically that \"the Chilean Army, as an institution that must and belongs to all Chileans without exception, does not discriminate arbitrarily on the basis of race or ethnicity, socioeconomic status, religion or belief, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, marital status, affiliation, personal appearance or any other reason.\" The discriminatory conducts of its officials are \"expressly and definitively prohibited.\" If someone violates this principle will incur a \"very serious offense, regardless of the rank hierarchy, category or type of contract.\"\n\nIn 2013, the Health Ministry lifted a ban on gay and lesbian blood donations.\n\nBefore, potential blood donors would be asked their sexual orientation as a part of a questionnaire that would decide whether or not their blood was viable. Anyone identifying as gay, lesbian or bisexual was prohibited from donating blood. \nThe current language in the questionnaire now only restricts donors with a history of risky sexual behavior, regardless of the sexual orientation of the participant. Risky sexual conduct is defined by the Health Ministry as sex with more than one partner in the previous 12 months.\n\nIn June 2015, the Chilean College of Psychologists announced its rejection to the realization of so-called \"reparative therapy to cure homosexuality,\" also known as conversion therapies. After conducting an investigation, through its Gender and Sexual Diversity Committee, established that \"the different sexual orientations are no deviations or mental illness, therefore, there is no disease to cure.\" Through a press release, they stated that \"there is no scientific study showing that conversion therapies change homosexuality, so only produce frustration and damage to their patients.\"\n\nIn February 2016, the Chilean Ministry of Health for the first time expressed their opposition to conversion therapy.\n\"We consider that the practices known as ‘reparative therapies’ or ‘conversion’ of homosexuality represent a grave threat to health and well-being, including the life, of the people who are affected,\" they stated.\n\nOn 18 October 2017, the Chamber of Deputies passed the Mental Health Protection bill, which states in its article 6 that \"a mental health diagnosis can not be made based solely on criteria related to the political, socioeconomic, cultural, racial or religious group of the person, nor with their identity or sexual orientation.\" The bill now heads to the Senate for discussion.\n\nPublic opinion has shown substantial support for same-sex civil unions: 65% favored their legalization in 2004, even though only 24% supported same-sex marriage.\n\nIn 2009, 33.2% supported same-sex marriage and 26.5% supported adoption by same-sex couples. Support among young people is much higher: according to a study by the National Youth Institute of Chile, 56% of young respondents supported same-sex marriage, while 51.3% supported same-sex adoption.\n\nAn August 2012 poll found that 54.9% of Chileans support same-sex marriage, while 40.7% are opposed. A more recent poll showed that 70% of youths support same-sex marriage.\n\nOn 7 September 2015, a poll found that 60% of Chileans support marriage between same-sex couples, while 44% support same-sex adoption.\n\nOn 23 January 2017, a survey by the same pollster found that 64% of Chileans support same-sex marriage, including 71% of unaffiliated people (24% of the sample), 66% of Catholics (58% of the sample) and 41% of Evangelicals (14% of the sample). The support was higher among left-leaning (72%) and centrist Chileans (71%), whilst it was lower among independents (64%) and right-leaning ones (55%).\n\nAn Ipsos poll of 27 countries concerning transgender people revealed that Chile had the highest acceptance for member of the transgender community out of all the countries, with 82% agreeing that transgender people should be allowed surgery so that their body matches their identity, 79% agreeing that a transgender person should be able to conceive or give birth if possible, 70% agreeing on discrimination protections, 69% agreeing with allowing transgender people to use the bathroom corresponding to the sex with which they identify, and only 13% believing that transgender people \"suffer from a mental illness\". A March 2018 poll showed that 67% supported the \"Gender Identity Law\", while only 37% supported children changing their birth sex.\n\nOn 8 May 2018, a CADEM survey found that 65% and 52% of Chileans support same-sex marriage and same-sex adoption, respectively.\n\n"}

Cosmatos\n\nGeorge Pan Cosmatos (4 January 1941 – 19 April 2005) was a Greco-Italian film director and screenwriter. Following early success in his home country with drama films such as \"Massacre in Rome\" with Richard Burton (based on the real-life Ardeatine massacre), Cosmatos retooled his career towards mainstream 'blockbuster' action and adventure films, including \"The Cassandra Crossing\" and \"Escape to Athena\", both of which were British-Italian co-productions. After relocating to North America, he directed the horror film \"Of Unknown Origin\". This was followed by some of his best-known work, including the action films \"\" and \"Cobra\" (both of which star Sylvester Stallone), the science-fiction horror film \"Leviathan\", and the critically acclaimed Western \"Tombstone\".\n\nCosmatos was born to a Greek family in Florence, Italy, and grew up in Egypt and Cyprus. He is said to have spoken six languages. After studying film at the London Film School, he became assistant director to Otto Preminger on \"Exodus\" (1960), based on Leon Uris's novel about the birth of Israel. Thereafter he worked on \"Zorba the Greek\" (1964), in which Cosmatos had a small part as Boy with Acne.\n\nCosmatos found success in Italy for directing the films \"Rappresaglia\" (1973) with Marcello Mastroianni and \"The Cassandra Crossing\" (1976) with Sophia Loren. In 1979, he made the successful British World War II adventure movie \"Escape to Athena\", starring an all-star ensemble cast including Roger Moore, David Niven, Telly Savalas, Elliott Gould and Claudia Cardinale. He made his North American directorial debut with the Canadian horror film \"Of Unknown Origin\". He then directed the box-office hit \"\" starring Sylvester Stallone, and \"Cobra\", another successful Stallone vehicle, in 1986. In 1989 he directed the science-fiction horror film \"Leviathan\", starring Peter Weller, Richard Crenna, Ernie Hudson, and Amanda Pays, with special effects designed by Stan Winston.\n\nLate in his career, Cosmatos received more praise for \"Tombstone\", a 1993 Western movie about Doc Holliday and Wyatt Earp. This film was particularly praised for the exceptional performance of Val Kilmer as Doc Holliday. Kurt Russell, who played Wyatt Earp, said Stallone recommended Cosmatos to him after the removal of the first director, writer Kevin Jarre, but Cosmatos had also worked with \"Tombstone\" executive producer Andrew G. Vajna before on \"Rambo: First Blood Part II\".\n\nOutside of his film career, Cosmatos was a notable collector of rare books, focussing mainly on 19th-20th Century English literature and signed & inscribed works. His library was sold through Sotheby's.\n\nGeorge P. Cosmatos died of lung cancer on 19 April 2005, at his home in Victoria, British Columbia at the age of 64. He was survived by one son, Panos Cosmatos, who has said that his independently released surreal film \"Beyond the Black Rainbow\" was funded primarily by royalties from his father's film \"Tombstone\". Panos would later go on become a director in his own right, working primarily in the horror genre, where he is noted for the surreal atmosphere of his films.\n\n"}
{"id": "1795461", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1795461", "title": "Ordnance Survey Ireland", "text": "Ordnance Survey Ireland\n\nOrdnance Survey Ireland (OSI; ) is the national mapping agency of Ireland. It was established in 2002 as a body corporate. It is the successor to the former Ordnance Survey of Ireland. It and the Ordnance Survey of Northern Ireland (OSNI) are the ultimate successors to the Irish operations of the British Ordnance Survey. OSI is part of the Irish public service. OSI has made modern and historic maps of the state free to view on its website. OSI is headquartered at Mountjoy House in the Phoenix Park in Dublin. Mountjoy House was also the headquarters, until 1922, of the Irish section of the British Ordnance Survey.\n\nUnder the Ordnance Survey Ireland Act 2001, the Ordnance Survey of Ireland was dissolved and a new corporate body called Ordnance Survey Ireland was established in its place. OSI is now an autonomous corporate body, with a remit to cover its costs of operation from its sales of data and derived products, which has sometimes raised concerns about the mixing of public responsibilities with commercial imperatives. It employs 235 staff in the Phoenix Park and in six regional offices in Cork, Ennis, Kilkenny, Longford, Sligo and Tuam. OSI had sales of €13.3 million in 2012.\n\nThe most prominent consumer publications of OSI are the \"Dublin City and District Street Guide\", an atlas of Dublin city, and the \"Complete Road Atlas of Ireland\" which it publishes in co-operation with Land and Property Services Northern Ireland (formerly the Ordnance Survey of Northern Ireland). The board also publishes (jointly with OSNI) a series of 1:50000 maps of the entire island known as the \"Discovery Series\" and a series of 1:25000 maps of places of interest (such as the Aran Islands and Killarney national park) and the Geology of Ireland.\n\nThomas Colby, the long-serving Director-General of the Ordnance Survey in Great Britain, was the first to suggest that the Ordnance Survey be used to map Ireland. A highly detailed survey of the whole of Ireland would be extremely useful for the British government, both as a key element in the process of levying local taxes based on land valuations and for military planning. In 1824, a committee was established under the direction of Thomas Spring Rice, MP for Limerick, to oversee the foundation of an Irish Ordnance Survey. Spring Rice believed in the importance of Irish involvement in the mapping process, but was overruled by the Duke of Wellington, who did not believe Irish surveyors were qualified for the task. Instead, the Irish Ordnance Survey was initially staffed entirely by members of the British Army.\n\nFrom 1825–46, teams of surveyors led by officers of the Royal Engineers, and men from the ranks of the Royal Sappers and Miners, traversed Ireland, creating a unique record of a landscape undergoing rapid transformation. The resulting maps (primarily at 6″ scale, with greater detail for urban areas, to an extreme extent in Dublin) portrayed the country in a degree of detail never attempted before, and when the survey of the whole country was completed in 1846, it was a world first. Both the maps and surveying were executed to a high degree of engineering excellence available at the time using triangulation and with the help of tools developed for the project, most notably the strong \"limelight\". The concrete triangulation posts built on the summits of many Irish mountains can still be seen to this day.\n\nThe Royal Engineer officers in charge of the operation were Thomas Colby and Lieutenant Thomas Larcom. They were assisted by George Petrie, who headed the Survey's Topographical Department which employed the likes of John O'Donovan and Eugene O'Curry in scholarly research into placenames. Captain J.E. Portlock compiled extensive information on agricultural produce and natural history, particularly geology.\n\nDespite the exclusion of Irish surveyors, this mapping scheme provided numerous opportunities for employment to Irish people, who worked as skilled or semi-skilled fieldwork labourers, and as clerks in the subsidiary Memoir project that was designed to illustrate and complement the maps by providing data on the social and productive worth of the country.\n\nThe total cost of the Irish Survey was £860,000 (adjusted for inflation, equivalent to approximately £100,000,000 in 2018). The original survey was later revisited and revised maps issued on a number of occasions. All of these historical maps (at least up to 1922) are in the public domain and while the originals can be hard to find, they can be freely reproduced.\n\nThe British Ordnance Survey ceased to map Ireland just before the creation of the Irish Free State in 1922 (the Partition of Ireland having already taken place in May 1921 upon the creation of Northern Ireland). The new Ordnance Survey of Northern Ireland (OSNI) officially came into existence on 1 January 1922, while the new Ordnance Survey of Ireland (OSI) came into being slightly later, on 1 April 1922.\n\nThe OSI was initially part of the Irish Army under the Department of Defence. All staff employed were military personnel until the 1970s, when the first civilian employees were recruited.\n\nIn more recent times, the Ordnance Survey of Ireland replaced traditional ground surveying with mapping based primarily on aerial photography. It has also worked with the postal service, An Post, to gather and structure geographic data.\n\nThe national survey carried out between 1825 and 1846 is the focus of the 1981 play \"Translations\" by Brian Friel. The main theme is the inscription of Irish language place names in an anglicised form, using a phonetic rendering for British anglophone ears of an approximate Irish pronunciation.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1795498", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1795498", "title": "LGBT rights in Belarus", "text": "LGBT rights in Belarus\n\nLesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) persons in Belarus face legal challenges not experienced by non-LGBT residents. Both male and female same-sex sexual activity are legal in Belarus. Households headed by same-sex couples are not eligible for the same legal protections available to opposite-sex couples.\n\nSame-sex sexual activity was legalized in Belarus in 1994. However, lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) rights in Belarus are still severely limited and homosexuality remains highly taboo in Belarusian society. Many Belarusian people believe that homosexuality is a psychiatric illness, and many LGBT persons in Belarus tend to hide their sexual orientation. Those who are \"out\" face harassment, violence and physical abuse.\n\nWhile a part of the Soviet Union, Belarus used the laws common for all Soviet republics. As such, homosexuality was considered illegal. Sexual relationships between females have never been illegal in Belarus (though lesbians could be sent to mental institutions if discovered) while those between males were frequently prosecuted. Words such as \"homosexuality\" or \"gay\" were not present in any old Soviet code and the Soviet juridical system used the term \"sodomy\".\n\nArticle 119-1 of the previous Criminal Code of Belarus set out that homosexual men having voluntary sexual contact were to be convicted to prison terms up to five years. In 1989 nearly 50 Belarusian citizens were fired due to their sexual orientation. A special department was set up in the KGB to combat homosexuality. The secret services used blackmail to recruit agents from the gay community. This prevented the possibility of the emergence of any gay organization, or print media designed specifically for sexual minorities. Nonetheless, gay people met in the streets, toilets, railway stations, or gathered in private flats or houses.\n\nIn 1992 a newspaper named \"Sex-AntiAIDS-Plus\" was founded through help provided by a non-governmental organization called Stop-AIDS-Belarus (SAB). The second issue of the newspaper was intercepted by a procurator's office, and a criminal case was initiated against the newspaper. The newspaper contained personal ads for gays and lesbians. The prosecution regarded these announcements as pandering.\n\nIn 1994, the criminal case against the newspaper was dropped. However, its founder and chief editor, Ruslan Geniush, fearing persecution, stopped his publishing endeavour. In 1992 a magazine named \"Randez-vous\" was registered, and began publishing. The magazine focused primarily on personal ads and contained articles written by psychologists, sexologists and letters and announcements from LGBT readers in a special column called \"Blue Salon\". In 1994 the magazine ceased to exist.\n\nOn 1 March 1994, the Parliament of Belarus changed Article 119-1 of the Criminal Code of Belarus, and homosexuality became legal.\n\nHomosexual sex was decriminalized in 1994. The age of consent for participation in sexual acts is equal for homosexuals and heterosexuals: 16 years old.\n\nAccording to the Constitution (Article 32) and the Marriage and Family Code (Articles 1 and 12), marriage is a specific civil contract, concluded before a state organ and limited to two persons of the opposite sex. This final requirement makes marriage inaccessible to homosexual couples.\n\nThere is no domestic partnership option under Belarussian law, although co-habitation outside of marriage, even by heterosexual couples, is common. Domestic partnership is not a legal basis for one partner's changing his or her surname. It does not lead to spousal material commonwealth between the partners. Among the responsibilities taken on by the partners in their life together, the only ones legally enforced are those listed in the civil law. When they have a common business, their relations are regulated by the rules of commercial law. If they break up, the partners have no access to the legally recognized rights of a spouse in a divorce. Current and former partners in cohabitation have no right to alimony or financial support.\n\nCohabitation is not a legal basis for inheritance, since partners are not included in the legal circle of heirs. Therefore, domestic partners may inherit from one another only when there is a last will and testament. The taxes on such an inheritance are higher than the taxes imposed on inheritances received by a legal spouse. Domestic partners inheriting through a will also have no right to a preserve part of the estate.\n\nCohabitating partners have no parental rights over the children of the other partner. It is possible, however, for one partner to legally adopt the other's biological children. The adoptive parent must not be legally incapacitated, must not have been stripped of his or her parental rights by the courts, and must be at least 16 years older than the adopted child. It is not possible for co-habitating couples to adopt orphans, since the law requires adoptive couples to be married.\n\nThe Labour Code (Article 14) prohibits discrimination in the sphere of labour relations. However, sexual orientation is left out of the list of social characteristics on whose basis discrimination is legally prohibited.\n\nPersecution on the basis of sexual orientation is not explicitly recognized in law as a ground for granting refugee status. Same sex partners are not recognized for the purposes of immigration law. After the fall of the communist regime many Belarusians requested and were granted political asylum abroad, based on fear of persecution because of their sexual orientation. The most frequent reason cited was formal or informal harassment by the police. Amnesty International and Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Network – Belarus (AILGBT-Belarus) has information on individuals who were granted asylum in the Czech Republic, France, Netherlands, and Sweden. One 19-year-old former Minsk resident received asylum in a Western country in May 2007 because his parents had been trying to change his sexual orientation by means of shock therapy.\n\nThe internet provider Beltelecom (a telecom provider with a monopoly in Belarus), which controls the external gateway, tried to block access to gay sites, at least from internet clubs. Internet resources for gays and lesbians in Belarus recently have been operating without problems. However, access is blocked to Russian gay internet sites, including Gay.ru.\n\nThe first gay parade held in the Commonwealth of Independent States was held in 2001 in Minsk. It was a peaceful march, with about 300 people in attendance.\n\nA private company in Belarus censored gay personal ads on Apagay.com, agay-oriented website, today known as Gay.by. In response to complaints, the website owner first explained that he had the right to edit personal ads. Then he stated the site was merely implementing recommendations, but did not state whose recommendations.\n\nThe only specialised magazine for the LGBT community (\"Forum Lambda\" magazine) was published by Lambda Belarus in Russia and disseminated in Belarus from 1998 to 2002. The publication has been banned several times by the State Publishing Committee.\n\nThe main source of information about life of LGBT community in Belarus is Gay.by. It is one of 10 most visited sites in Belarus with a monthly audience of over 350,000 visitors. The creators of the website encounter a lot of problems when trying to disseminate information about homosexuality. In December 2002, Belarusian State University in Minsk banned access to all gay internet resources. In March 2003, the administration of the internet café “Soyuz Online”, the biggest and most popular among gays in Minsk, blocked Gay.by. In January 2004, the national web-hosting company N1.BY refused services to Gay.by. Earlier in 2003, the system administrator of \"Krasnaya Banernaya\" (RED.BY) banned Gay.by from participating in banner exchange.\n\nOn 10 May 2003, an unknown hacker broke into Gay.by. The hacker deleted all topics on the site's forum and started a new thread containing an appeal to kill homosexuals. In addition, while downloading the home page of Gay.by, the notification “PIDARS MUST DIE” and “STOP PIDARS IN BELARUS” appeared on the screen. The hacker's break in was followed by telephone calls to the members of the site's team with threats of physical violence.\n\nA new line of sites keeps the Belarus LGBT audience well-informed and entertained. Sunshine.by, the first gay blog in Belarus, provides invaluable insight into the world of LBGT community of the country.\n\nThere is no official organization in Belarus that represents the interests of gays and lesbians in Belarus. The Women's Organization (Jyana), which was officially registered and working on \"gender questions.\" Jyana, which protected young women in the country, recently announced that it soon will close. The men's organization, Republican Youth (Vstrecha) is not an LGBT-organization, but conducts a great deal of work aimed at preventing HIV infection and AIDS among men who have sex with men. Any other organization or initiative is working outside the legal framework.\n\n\nViolations of the rights to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly in Belarus were repeatedly condemned by the international community.\n\nAfter previous failed efforts, in 1999 a gay pride festival was organised by the Belarusian League for Sexual Equality “Lambda” BLL and \"Forum Lambda\", a magazine for Belarusian gays and lesbians. The festival program included a seminar for journalists on \"lesbians and gay men in the media\", conference on the rights of gays and lesbians in Belarus and in the world, the exhibition of photographs and films taken homosexuals, and the competitions “Mr. Gay Belarus” and “Transmission”. The festival was supported by the UN Development Programme, studio Tatyana, United Way Belarus, IREX, the Titanic Club, and guests from Ukraine. During one of the parties, the club was raided by riot police that frisked the contestants.\n\nIn 2000, the organisers of the festival encountered great difficulty in preparing for the event. According to Edward Tarletski, head of the organising committee, the radio station Radio BA which was to cover the event and grant its dancehall for evening events received an order from the presidential administration not to do so. Other radio stations reportedly refused support on the same grounds, and events at other venues also were canceled. Orthodox Church-related groups demonstrated in Minsk against the gay festival on 9 September, on the day before the festival was planned. The pride march through the city was banned by the city government 24 hours before it was due to take place, and authorities acted on the day to prevent festivities. Newspapers reported the outcome of the day. \n\nIn 2001, the Belarus government allegedly prohibited the Belarus Gay Pride Festival. On 3 August 2001, unidentified vandals broke into and vandalised the flat of Lambda Belarus leader Andrei Babkin where fliers, posters and booklets of Gay Pride 2001 had been kept.\n\nIn 2002, days before Gay Pride 2002, Lambda Belarus leader Edward Tarletski was called to the Minsk police station where he was told that if a gay pride parade took place, “the police will not take any responsibility for possible disorder.”\n\nIn 2004, an international gay and lesbian festival was forced to be canceled. The organizing committee of the final (Belarusian) phase of the 4th International Moonbow Human Rights & Homo Cultural Festival and the first stage of this year's ILGCN (International Lesbian & Gay Cultural Network) World Lesbian and Gay World Conference in August 2004 were forced to cancel the event in Minsk. This came after authorities frightened a club owner into withdrawing his promise to host the event. In addition, threatening phone calls from authorities said foreigners trying to attend the event for workshops and discussions \"would be immediately expelled from the country in keeping with the article of intervention in domestic affairs of the Republic of Belarus.\" \n\nOn 27 October 2008, the same group asked permission to hold a protest in support of gay rights near the Russian Embassy in Minsk. Both events were not authorised. Because the country is currently not a member of the Council of Europe, Belarusian activists cannot appeal to the European Court of Human Rights. It is the same group which decided to organise with Russian LGBT activists a Slavic Pride which is planned to alternate between Moscow and Minsk every year.\n\nIn January 2009, an event titled \"The Right to Love\" was planned and designed to raise public awareness about homophobia and discrimination against LGBT people in Belarus. Authorization was denied. LGBT activist Roman Mandryk filed a complaint in the Court of the Central Borough of Gomel in response to this decision of the Gomel City Administration. In the text of the complaint, Mr. Mandryk claims that the decision of the Gomel City Administration violated his right to freedom of Assembly as guaranteed by Article 35 of the Constitution of Belarus. He adds that Regulation 299 itself is unconstitutional in that it imposes unreasonable burdens on those seeking to organize public gatherings. The organizers intend to pursue this claim until it is resolved and hope to be able to organize a gathering in 2010.\n\nThe \"Month against Homophobia\" was a campaign by Belarusian LGBT activists from 17 April to 17 May 2009 in Minsk, Grodno and Luninets. It consisted of informational campaigns and events. The month was organized by Gayby.org, Gay.by, members of the League of Sexual Equality \"Lambda\", and Amnesty International (Belarus). More than 50 media outlets reported about the month's events. Belarusian media began to talk about gay and lesbian people.\n\nThe main aim of the Month against Homophobia was to resist any kind of physical, moral and symbolic violence to people with a different sexual orientation and gender identity, to show solidarity to LGBT in the world who are unable to fight for their rights, and to carry a wider campaign for human rights.\n\nThere is no Belarusian law that refers specifically to perpetrators of crimes motivated by homophobia. In the Criminal Code, homosexuals are only singled out when they are the “subjects” of a crime (e.g., when they are the perpetrators), and not when they are “objects” (e.g., victims of a crime). Judicial and police organs do not express any eagerness to collect evidence about the homophobic motives of those who perpetrate crimes. Judges are not obliged to consider such motives as aggravating the circumstances of guilt, or to impose more severe punishments when homophobic motives are present. LGBT people are in danger to face discrimination and violence.\n\nOn 18 April 2001, a dead body of the pensioner Alexander Stephanovich, known in Minsk as a homosexual, was found in the yard of the apartment block where he lived. His body was stabbed all over with knives. On 16 May of the same year, Andrei Babkin, an activist with Lambda Belarus, was badly beaten and raped at the entrance to his flat. He was taken to the hospital with severe injuries.\n\nOn 2 July, the police in Minsk detained and badly beat Andrei Scherbakov, one of the founders of Lambda Belarus. The next day, Ivan Suchinski, the owner of the gay club Oskar was killed. The club had been closed by the authorities in February 2000, and Ivan brought civil claims because of the unfair actions of the police. On 13 November 2001 in Molodechno, Lambda Belarus leader Edward Tarletski was assaulted which resulted in a concussion and required seven days' hospitalization.\n\nOn 15 February 2002 in Zhlobin (Gomel Region), 34-year-old accountant Victor Kovyl was found dead in his parents’ flat. He was an openly gay man both at work and in public. The police refused to give the details of the murder to Kovyl's partner Alexander and one of the members of the police said to him: “It serves you right, sodomites (faggots)!”.\n\nOn 12 April 2002, an assault and beating of gay men took place outside the gay club “Babylon”. According to witnesses a group of skin heads (10 to 12 men) attacked three patrons before the police arrived. Among the victims was Edward Tarletski, editor-in-chief of gay magazine \"Forum Lambda\" and leader of Lambda Belarus. On 10 June in Kommunar, Buda-Kashalyova District, Gomel region, three unidentified men beat and raped local resident Dmitrii L., 18. The victim was taken to the hospital where he spent two weeks.\n\nOn the evening of 2 October 2002, Edward Tarletski was assaulted outside his flat entrance on his way home. Four unidentified men asked him if his name was Tarletski and started beating him. That night he was taken to the hospital. He had a broken shoulder and three smashed teeth.\n\nIn 2002, the Minsk police started a criminal case in connection with the murder of Mikhail M., 50, whose mutilated body was found in his flat on 17 November. According to the police this was the fifth murder of this kind committed in the capital of Belarus. However, the detectives fully denied the possibility of a serial killer.\n\nOn 18 February 2003 Tarletski was beaten again by unidentified persons near his house. Edward was taken to the hospital with a head injury and plenty of bruises on his body. On 29 March of the same year, a bouncer at the night club Budda-Bar in Minsk beat Yuliya Yukhnovetz, a volunteer for Minsk Pride, because she kissed a girl in the club hallway. She was taken to the hospital where she was diagnosed with an injured cranium.\n\nOn 28 May 2008, Edward Tarletski was attacked again by three youths in Minsk. Tarletski stated that he did not intend to report the attack to police because they would not do anything about the incident. He also said this attack was the third against him in five years.\n\nAt the mid of September 2008, two transsexual women had been raped in Minsk. Victims did not report to the police; they were not sure that they would help them.\n\nIn prisons and correctional facilities, homosexuality is subject to speculation, blackmail and extortion. While in prison, gays and lesbians are largely unprotected. Reportedly, executing bodies often make use of prisoners’ sexual inclinations to receive needed data, and turnkeys often encourage prisoners to abuse homosexuals.\n\nPolice officers seek information of a personal nature about homosexual persons who are victims of violence. This information is of no relevance to the prosecution the perpetrators of the crimes against those victims. Police officers collect information of a personal nature as well as passport data and mugshots of homosexual persons who visit known gay cruising areas. The national NGO “Vstrecha” [“Meeting”] (HIV-prevention group for gay men) reported about those practices in Brest and Gomel. Police officers refuse to register cases of brutality committed against sexual minorities and do not conduct investigations that would seek criminal responsibility from the perpetrators of crimes motivated by homophobic prejudice. Lambda Belarus reported many cases of brutality against lesbians and gays and passive behaviour of police in all regions of the country. Police have conducted unprovoked actions in bars frequented by homosexuals. AILGBT-Belarus, “Vstrecha”, Lambda Belarus and lesbian group “YANA” reported about those practices in Gomel and Minsk.\n\nA high percentage of suicide is observed amongst gays, lesbians, bisexuals and transsexuals. Qualified psychological help generally is not available. In Minsk, the capital of Belarus, three universities – Belarus State University, Belarus Pedagogical University and European Humanities University – have full psychology courses in their curriculum but do not address the problems of sexual minorities.\n\nIn May 2003, the administration of the European Humanities University in Minsk banned a showing of the documentary \"Outlawed\" about discrimination of gays and lesbians all around the world. According to the university staff, the ban was made under pressure of the Russian Orthodox Church.\n\nAccording to the Belarusian Ministry of Defense and the Center for the Study of Sexual Minorities in the Military of the University of California, Santa Barbara, Belarus bans gays from serving in the military. AILGBT-Belarus has documented at least five cases of gay men from Gomel who did not serve in the army because of their sexual orientations. No cases of harassment of gays in the army are reported, but this may be the result of gay individuals hiding their sexuality.\n\nThe open support of lesbians and gays is not a popular position for a political movement in Belarus. In July 2001, the Organising Committee of the 1st Belarusian Youth Congress, voted against allowing delegates of Lambda Belarus to participate. In March 2002, a number of Belarusian media published the statements of Young Front (the youth organisation of Belarusian Popular Front), which contained homophobic statements. Specifically, Young Front leader Pavel Severinetz published a letter where he called homosexuality “a death-worthy sin and perversion”. According to Severinetz, the fact of the existence of homosexuals is “the result of spoiling and sinfulness in the world”.\n\nIn another incident, Belarusian sexual minorities attempted to make a formal statement of solidarity with victims of the Chernobyl disaster. This attempt created a backlash, which led to an opposition youth leader, Dmitry Dashkevich, stating on the radio program \"Freedom Night\" that Belarus is no place for gays, and that homosexuals are sick people and that the opposition would not enter into a dialogue with them.\n\nIn September 2004, President Lukashenko, in a speech before the Belarusian Security Council, said, \"we have to show our society in the near future, what ‘they’ [the European Union and the United States] are doing here, how they are trying to turn our girls into prostitutes, how they are feeding our citizens with illicit drugs, how they are spreading sexual perversion here, which methods they are employing\".\n\nGay life is still largely underground, and most Belarusians consider homosexuality a disorder. Homophobic attitudes, suspicions and prejudices are still very strong. According to a survey by the Belarusian Lambda League for Sexual Equality (Lambda Belarus) in April 2002, 47% of Belarusians think that gays should be imprisoned. Young people increasingly tolerate homosexuality and show a growing interest in gay and lesbian culture. However, their interests remain part of youth popular culture and is often considered as a kind of fashion that will be outgrown and forgotten when they become adults. In 2007, Information Center TEMA and MyGomel.com organized a vote about the reaction of Gomel region youth to sexual minorities. 47.6% had negative feelings to sexual and gender minorities, 10% want to criminalize homosexual relations.\n\nThe most recent poll by Pew Research Center published in May 2017 suggests that 16% of Belarusians are in favor of same-sex marriage while 81% oppose the idea, which was significantly higher than in Ukraine (12%), Russia (5%) and Moldova (5%). Younger people are more likely than their elders to favor legal gay marriage (22% vs. 14%).\n\nIn May 2017, a survey by the Pew Research Center in Eastern European countries showed that 84% of Belarusians believed that homosexuality should not be accepted by society.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1795511", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1795511", "title": "Garcia de Orta", "text": "Garcia de Orta\n\nGarcia de Orta (or Garcia d'Orta) (1501? – 1568) was a Portuguese Renaissance Sephardi Jewish physician, herbalist and naturalist. He was a pioneer of tropical medicine, pharmacognosy and ethnobotany, working mainly in Goa, then a Portuguese overseas territory. Garcia de Orta used an experimental approach to the identification and use of herbal medicines rather than the traditional approach of using received knowledge. His \"magnum opus\" was a book on the simples (herbs used singly) and drugs published in 1563 \"Colóquios dos simples e drogas da India\", the earliest treatise on the medicinal and economic plants of India. Carolus Clusius translated it into Latin which was widely used as a standard reference text on medicinal plants. Garcia de Orta died before the Inquisition began in Goa but in 1569 his sister was burnt at the stake for being a secret Jew and based on her confession his remains were later exhumed and burnt along with an effigy. Memorials recognizing his contributions have been built both in Portugal and India.\n\nGarcia de Orta was born in Castelo de Vide, probably in 1501, the son of Fernão (Isaac) da Orta, a merchant, and Leonor Gomes. He had three sisters, Violante, Catarina and Isabel. Their parents were Spanish Jews from Valencia de Alcántara who had taken refuge, as many others did, in Portugal at the time of the great expulsion of the Spanish Jews by the \"Reyes Catolicos\" Ferdinand and Isabella of Spain in 1492. Forcibly converted to Christianity in 1497, they were pejoratively classed as \"Cristãos Novos\" (New Christians) and marranos (\"swine\"). Some of these refugees maintained their Jewish faith secretly. A friendly neighbour at Castelo de Vide was the nobleman Dom Fernão de Sousa, Lord of Labruja, who may have influenced the idea for Garcia's father to send him to University. Dom Fernão's son Martim Afonso de Sousa would become a key figure in later life.\n\nGarcia studied medicine, arts and philosophy at the Universities of Alcalá de Henares and Salamanca in Spain. He graduated and returned to Portugal in 1525, two years after his father's death. He practiced medicine first in his home town and from 1526 onwards in Lisbon, where he gained a lecturership at the university in 1532. He also became royal physician to John III of Portugal.\n\nPerhaps fearing the increasing power of the Portuguese Inquisition, and fortunately evading the ban on emigration of New Christians, he sailed for Portuguese India leaving Tagus in March 1534 as Chief Physician aboard the fleet of Martim Afonso de Sousa, later to be named Governor. He reached Goa in September. He travelled with Sousa on various campaigns, then, in 1538, settled at Goa, where he soon had a prominent medical practice. He was physician to Burhan Nizam Shah I of the Nizam Shahi dynasty of Ahmadnagar, and concurrently to several successive Portuguese Viceroys and governors of Goa.\nWhile Garcia de Orta was physician of the Sultan and teacher of Portuguese of his son, the Prince, he met and dined several times with the high ranking cavalry general of the Sultan, Firangi Khan. Garcia de Orta reports that the cavalry commander violated sometimes religious directives, eating pork and drinking wine in these private dinners. Firangi Khan had converted to Islam for apparently material reasons and had a very important role in the court of the Sultanate, but subsidized charities to Misericórdias in the relationship he had with the Portuguese empire (despite serving an intermittent \"enemy\" Muslim state) and, according to Orta, \"urged other Christians to never abdicate their principles.\" He even projected return to his home city in his country (already secretly pardoned by the viceroy Afonso de Noronha). Firangi Khan was not his title (and name, which literally means \"foreigner Khan\") of origin. His name was Sancho Pires, a formerly gunner (\"bombardeiro\"), Portuguese, and natural of Matosinhos. He died in battle in India.\n\nThe King of Portugal through the Viceroy Dom Pedro Mascarenhas granted a lifelong lease (on payment of a quit-rent) to Garcia da Orta for the \"Ilha da Boa Vida\" (\"the Island of the Good Life\") which became a part of Bombay. This was probably somewhere between September 1554 and June 1555. The only condition of the lease was that he had to improve the place. He had a manor house with a large garden. He probably maintained an excellent library here. This manor stood not far from where the Town Hall of Bombay was built. Garcia probably let out the house to Simao Toscano. At the time of Bombay's transfer to the English, the manor was occupied by Dona Ignez de Miranda, widow of Dom Rodrigo de Monsanto. It was in this house that the treaty by which Bombay was transferred to the English was signed by Humphrey Cooke on February 18, 1665. Garcia describes the people around Bassein and their traditions in his book.\n\nContrary to some early biographical accounts, Garcia de Orta married a wealthy cousin, Brianda de Solis, in 1543; the marriage was unhappy, but the couple had two daughters. In 1549 his mother and two of his sisters, who had been imprisoned as Jews in Lisbon, managed to join him in Goa. According to a confession by his brother-in-law after his death, Garcia de Orta privately continued to assert that \"the Law of Moses was the true law\"; in other words, he, probably in common with others in his family, remained a Jewish believer. In 1565 an inquisitorial court was opened in Goa. Active persecution against Jews, secret Jews, Hindus and New Christians began. Garcia himself died in 1568, apparently without having suffered seriously from this persecution, but his sister Catarina was arrested as a Jew in the same year and was burned at the stake for Judaism in Goa on October 25, 1569. Garcia himself was posthumously convicted of Judaism. His remains were exhumed and burned along with an effigy in an auto da fé on December 4, 1580. They were among 342 New Christians accused of crypto-Judaism of whom 68 were executed between 1561 and 1623. His books were most likely burnt as well, possibly a reason why no copy of his book exists in Goa. The fate of his daughters is not known. During his lifetime, Orta's family members, including his mother and sisters were arrested and interrogated briefly in Portugal but they were probably protected by his friend and patron, Martim Afonso de Sousa, who was Governor-General of Portuguese India from 1542 to 1545.\n\nGarcia de Orta's busy practice evidently prevented him from travelling much beyond the west coast of India, but in the busy market and trading hub of Goa he met spice merchants, traders and physicians from many parts of southern Asia and the Indian Ocean coasts. He was confident in Portuguese, Spanish, Hebrew, Latin, Greek and Arabic (he did not know Sanskrit); his work shows that he gathered considerable knowledge from traditional medicine practitioners from several regions of India. Correspondents and agents sent him seeds and plants; he also traded in spices, drugs and precious stones. He evidently kept a laboratory and botanical garden. De Orta was influenced by \"Yunnani\" medicine as well as \"Ayurveda\", although quoting Galen, al-Rhazi and Ibn-Sina more often. He tended to use European approaches in medicine and only when they failed did he make use of local methods.\n\nHis remarkable knowledge of Eastern spices and drugs is revealed in his only known work, \"Colóquios dos simples e drogas he cousas medicinais da Índia\" (\"Conversations on the simples, drugs and medicinal substances of India\"), the first edition of which was published at Goa in 1563. This book deals with a series of substances, many of them unknown or the subject of confusion and misinformation in Europe at this period. For instance, prior to his publication, tamarind was thought to come from a palm tree. He also noted many details on plants and their propagation. He was the first European to describe the symptoms of several Asiatic tropical diseases, notably cholera; he performed an autopsy on a cholera victim, the first recorded autopsy in India. Garcia de Orta reveals in his writings an unusual independence in face of the usually revered texts of ancient authorities, Greek, Latin and Arabic. The \"Coloquios\" has 59 chapters and it was written in the style of a dialogue between da Orta and a traditional doctor, Ruano. Using a dialogue form was a common literary practice when dealing with the tensions between established and new forms of knowledge. Orta's work questions assumptions made in the past with alternative hypotheses to the ideas from Ibn-Sina and Averroes. His scientific method has been suggested to be a combination of empiricism and hypothesism.\n\nDa Orta critiqued the work of Leonhart Fuchs. Through his character he commented that Fuchs \"...knew little of physic, and still less of things to save his soul, being a heretic condemned for Lutheranism. His books were put in the condemned catalogue\" and \"though medicine is not the science of the Christian religion, still I abhor the author\".\n\nIn one place he points out that the Portuguese traders took little interest in acquiring knowledge:\nThe printing press was introduced into Goa in 1556. The printer for Garcia is thought to have been João de Endem who began with Joao Quinquenio de Campania and continued after him. The rare first edition was full of typographical errors and was only the fifth European book ever printed in Goa and among the first few from India. The errata, probably the longest in printing history, ran to twenty pages and end with a statement that the list was probably incomplete. The English translation by Clements Markham included illustrations of some of the Indian plants by Cristóvão da Costa. Markham considered da Costa's work published in Spanish in 1578, \"Tractado de las drogas y medicinas de las Indias orientales\" (\"Treatise of the drugs and medicines of the East Indies\") to be largely based on that of de Orta but some others have pointed out significant differences.\n\nGarcia's travels to Portuguese Ceylon (Jaffna) on campaigns with Martim allowed him to study Sri Lankan medicinal plants. Among the descriptions from here are plants used in the treatment of snakebite. Some of the information is based on folklore, such as the plants that were supposedly eaten by mongoose after being bitten by cobras. Orta also described plants of forensic importance such as the use of \"Datura\" used by thieves and robbers to poison their victims.\n\nThe preface of the book includes a verse by his friend the poet Luís de Camões, now considered as Portugal's national poet. Luis de Camões had been worked briefly in Portuguese Macau before returning to Goa in 1561. In his poem \"Os Lusíadas\", Camões plays on the word \"Orta\" which refers to his friend as well as mean \"garden\". The book was dedicated to Dom Francisco Coutinho, Count of Redondo, Viceroy of Goa from 1561 to 1564, and to his friend Martim de Sousa. In the preface he pointed out that he could well have written the book in Latin but chose Portuguese so that the traders and other locals could make use of it.\n\nGarcia de Orta's work was accidentally discovered by Clusius in early 1564 and he translated it into Latin, while also changing it from a dialogue to an epitomized form, and this was widely read across Europe and underwent several editions.\n\nThe first edition of Garcia de Orta's book was in Portuguese and published from Goa in 1563 and had 217 pages. Only about six copies were thought to exist according to Valentine Ball in 1890. A second version was published in Lisbon in 1872. An abridged Latin version was produced by Carolus Clusius in 1567 with subsequent editions in 1574, 1579, 1582, 1584, 1593, 1595 and 1605/6. A translation of the Latin version into Italian was produced by Annibal de Briganti in 1576, followed by other editions in 1582, 1589 and 1616. A Spanish version of the Tractado of Cristobal A'Costa which included Clusius's abridgement and A'Costas's personal observation was published in 1578 from Burgos.\n\nGarcia's work influenced a number of later herbals and botanical works including those by Juan Fragoso, Nicolas Monardes, Hendrik van Rheede and Jacobus Bontius. The \"Jardim Garcia de Orta\", a public garden in Lisbon, as well the \"Escola Secundária Garcia de Orta\" high school in Porto and the \"Hospital Garcia de Orta\" in Almada, are named in his memory.\n\nIn Goa, the municipal garden (built in 1855) in the capital city of Panjim has been named as \"Garcia de Orta\" in his memory. It is located facing the main city square that also houses the majestic church of Our Lady of Immaculate conception (Nossa Senhora da Concepção Imaculada) and was renovated in 2010.\n\nA postal stamp of Garcia de Orta was released by Portugal in 1963. In 1971, the 20 Escudos bank note carried a picture of Garcia de Orta.\nGarcia de Orta has been Latinized in some works as \"Garcias ab Horto\" and then translated variously with some French works referring to him as \"de la Huerta\" and \"Dujardin\".\n\n\n"}
