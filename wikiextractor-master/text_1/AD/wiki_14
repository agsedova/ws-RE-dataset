{"id": "2201320", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2201320", "title": "Rain Queen", "text": "Rain Queen\n\nThe Modjadji, or Rain Queen, is the hereditary queen of Balobedu, a people of the Limpopo Province of South Africa. The succession to the position of Rain Queen is matrilineal, so her eldest daughter is the heir, and males are not entitled to inherit the throne at all. The Rain Queen is believed to have special powers, including the ability to control the clouds and rainfall.\n\nThere are several different stories relating to the creation and history of the Rain Queens of Balobedu. One story states that an old chief in 16th century Monomotapa (South eastern Zimbabwe), was told by his ancestors that by impregnating his daughter, Dzugundini, she would gain rain-making skills. Another story involves a scandal in the same chief's house, in which the chief's son impregnated Dzugundini. Dzugundini was held responsible and was forced to flee the village. Dzugundini ended up in Molototsi Valley, which is in the present day Balobedu Kingdom. The village she established with her loyal followers was ruled by a Mugudo, a male leader, but the peace and harmony of the village was disrupted by rivalries between different families; therefore, to pacify the land, Mugudo impregnated his own daughter in order to restore the tribe's matrilineal tradition. She gave birth to the first Rain Queen, known as Modjadji, which means: \"ruler of the day\".\n\nAccording to custom, the Rain Queen must shun public functions, and can only communicate with her people through her male or female councillors. \n\nEvery November she presides over the annual Rainmaking ceremony at her royal compound in Khetlhakone Village. \n\nShe is not supposed to marry, but has many \"wives\", as they are referred to in the Balobedu language. These are not spouses in the usual sense of the word; as a queen regnant, she has the equivalent of royal court servants, or ladies-in-waiting), sent from many villages all over the Balobedu Kingdom. These wives were selected by The Queen's Royal Council and in general are from the households of the subject chiefs. This ritual of \"bride giving\" is strictly a form of diplomacy to ensure loyalty to the Queen. \n\nThe Rain Queen's mystical rain making powers are believed to be reflected in the lush garden which surrounds her royal compound. Surrounded by parched land, her garden contains the world's largest cycad trees which are in abundance under a spectacular rain belt. One species of cycad, the Modjadji cycad, is named after the Rain Queen.\n\nThe Rain Queen is a prominent figure in South Africa, many communities respecting her position and, historically, attempting to avoid conflict in deference thereto. Even Shaka Zulu of Zululand sent his top emissaries to ask her for her blessings. The fifth Rain Queen, Mokope Modjadji, maintained cordial relations with Nelson Mandela. \n\nThe Rain Queen has become a figure of interest, she and the royal institution becoming a significant tourist attraction contributing to the South African economy. The Rain Queen was offered an annual government civil list. The stipend was also expected to help defray the costs of preserving the cycad trees found in the Rain Queen's gardens.\n\nRain Queen Makobo Constance Modjadji VI (1978 – 12 June 2005) was the sixth in a line of the Balobedu people's Rain Queens. Makobo was crowned on 16 April 2003, at the age of 25, after the death of her predecessor and grandmother, Queen Mokope Modjadji. This made her the youngest queen in the history of the Balobedu. \n\nMakobo was admitted into the Limpopo Medi-Clinic for an undisclosed illness on 10 June 2005 and died two days later, at the age of 27. The official cause of death was listed as chronic meningitis. She is survived by a son, Prince Lekukela Hex(b. 1997), and a daughter, Princess Masalanabo (b. February 2005).\n\nThe Rain Queen's official mates are chosen by the Royal Council, so that all of her children will be of dynastic status, from which future Rain Queens may descend. However, the Rain Queens are not expected to remain in exclusive relations with these partners. In the past, the Rain Queen was allowed to have children only by her close relatives. \n\nPerhaps uniquely, the Balobedu crown descends according to matrilineal primogeniture: her eldest daughter is always her successor, so the title of Rain Queen is normally passed from mother to daughter. It is said that she ingests poison when she is near death so that her daughter will assume the crown more quickly. Lately, however, many traditions have been abandoned, influenced by Christian missionaries. Because Makobo's daughter, Princess Masalanabo, was fathered by a commoner, traditionalists are not likely to accept her as the rightful successor to the throne. Therefore, there are worries that the 400-year-old Rain Queen dynasty may be coming to an end. No new Rain Queen has been enthroned since Makobo died. \n\nMakobo's brother Prince Mpapatla has been designated regent for Masalanabo. However, Mpapatla has a daughter by his cousin, a woman from the royal Modjadji line, and a group of members of the Royal Council has indicated a preference for Mpapatla's daughter to succeed as Rain Queen. Mpapatla, however, has insisted that his late sister's daughter, Princess Masalanabo, will be enthroned as the queen when she turns 18.\n\nA male branch of the extended royal clan has also petitioned the South African president to restore the male line of the Balobedu royal house, which reigned before 1800. This entreaty is considered unlikely to be granted, inasmuch as the Rain Queen heritage is recognised as a national cultural legacy and interest in it has stimulated significant tourist trade.\n\n\nThe second Rain Queen, Masalanabo Modjadji is said to have been the inspiration for H. Rider Haggard's novel \"She: A History of Adventure\".\n\nThe Marvel comics character Storm is a fictional descendant of the dynasty that produces the Rain Queens through the line of the Sorceress Supreme Ashake.\n\n\n\nThere's a Foundation and Awards founded by : Dr Tebogo Mokope Modjadji-Kekana ( 2015...)"}

Dario G was originally a trio, who are best known for their 1997 hit \"Sunchyme\", which reached number 2 on the UK Singles Chart. The group formed in Cheshire, England and consisted of three DJs and producers Scott Rosser, Paul Spencer and Stephen Spencer (the Spencers are unrelated).\n\nThe group changed their name from Dario to Dario G after being threatened with legal action from an artist of the same name. True to popular belief, the name Dario G was named after the manager of Crewe Alexandra F.C., Dario Gradi, and the similarity to Gradi was not a complete coincidence. Paul Spencer also said they added the G in tribute to the American jazz saxophonist Kenny G. Rosser and Stephen Spencer later left to pursue other things leaving Paul Spencer to perform in a solo capacity.\n\nThe Musical Journalist R J Formeta, writing for \"Vent Magazine\" in 2018, described Dario G as being \"one of the World’s finest DJs and performers.\"\n\nIn 1997, they reached number 2 on the UK Singles Chart with \"Sunchyme\", a song built around a sample of \"Life in a Northern Town\", a number 15 hit for The Dream Academy in 1985, and peaked at number 5 with the follow-up \"Carnaval de Paris\", relating to the 1998 FIFA World Cup in France. \"Sunchyme\" also hit number-one on the American Hot Dance Club Party chart.\n\nIn 1998, they released their first album, \"Sunmachine\".\n\nIn March 2000, their third single \"Voices\", featuring vocals from Vanessa Quiñones and produced by Peter Oxendale, was used for the film, \"The Beach\".\n\nIn January 2001, Dario G released \"Dream to Me\", with vocals by Ingfrid Straumstøyl, which is based on the song \"Dreams\" by The Cranberries. \"Dream to Me\" reached number 9 in the UK Singles Chart and number 9 in Germany. November 2001 saw their next release, \"Say What's on Your Mind\". The song had club mixes from Almighty Records and Stonebridge. In early 2003, Dario G released \"Heaven Is Closer (Feels Like Heaven)\", a remake of the 1980s hit, \"Feels Like Heaven\", by the Fiction Factory. It reached number 39 in the UK Singles Chart. Dario G released their second album \"In Full Colour\" in 2001.\n\nA new version of \"Carnaval de Paris\" was released in 2002, for the World Cup in South Korea and Japan.\n\nA new single \"Ring of Fire\" was promoted throughout Europe in 2006. It borrowed the main trumpet melody from the Johnny Cash recording of the same name. The single itself was released in September 2006.\n\nIn 2010, Dario G recorded a new song \"Game On\" along with rapper Pitbull, for the Official FIFA 2010 World Cup soundtrack.\n\nOn 23 February 2014, Dario G's single \"We Got Music\" was released. The song featured Shirley Bassey and got its first play on BBC Radio 2 on the Paul O'Grady show.\n\nIn September 2018, Dario G released \"Cry\". Writing for Vents Magazine, the music journalist R G Formeta described the single as having a \"catchy melody, infectious rhythm[s], uplifting vocals and a unique, timeless energy in a modern sounding production.\" In an interview for the same article, Dario G said “The principle idea took under an hour. I knew I was onto something, so I waited patiently for other ideas to fall into my lap over a few weeks to craft it into what you now hear. The title “Cry” was something that I felt summed up the emotion of listening back to what I'd created. It's a powerful and euphoric “Cry” rather than a sad one. I was picturing people dancing and being lifted by the soaring soprano vocals and strings, while the “Higher” chant is there to take the euphoria to an even higher level.”\n\n"}
{"id": "2201331", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2201331", "title": "Telephone exchange names", "text": "Telephone exchange names\n\nA telephone exchange name or central office name was a distinguishing and memorable name assigned to a central office. It identified the switching system to which a telephone was connected. Each central office served a maximum of 10,000 subscriber lines identified by the last four digits of the telephone number. Areas or cities with more subscribers were served by multiple central offices, possibly hosted in the same building. The leading letters of a central office name were used as the leading components of the telephone number representation, so that each telephone number in an area was unique. These letters were mapped to digits, which was indicated visibly on a dial telephone.\n\nSeveral systematic telephone numbering plans existed in various communities, typically evolving over time as the subscriber base outgrew older numbering schemes. A widely used numbering plan was a system of using two letters from the central office name with four or five digits, which was designated as \"2L-4N\" or \"2L-5N\", or simply \"2–4\" and \"2–5\", respectively, but some large cities initially selected plans with three letters (\"3L-4N\"). In 1917, W. G. Blauvelt of AT&T proposed a mapping system that displayed three letters each with the digits 2 through 9 on the dial.\n\nTelephone directories or other telephone number displays, such as in advertising, typically listed the telephone number showing the significant letters of the central office name in bold capital letters, followed by the digits that identified the subscriber line. On the number card of the telephone instrument, the name was typically shown in full, but only the significant letters to be dialed were capitalized, while the rest of the name was shown in lower case.\n\nTelephone exchange names were used in many countries, but were phased out for numeric systems by the 1960s. In the United States, the demand for telephone service outpaced the scalability of the alphanumeric system and after introduction of area codes for direct-distance dialing, all-number calling became necessary. Similar developments followed around the world, such as the British all-figure dialling.\n\nIn the United States, the most-populous cities, such as New York City, Philadelphia, Boston, and Chicago initially implemented dial service with telephone numbers consisting of three letters and four digits (\"3L-4N\") according to a system developed by W. G. Blauvelt of AT&T in 1917. This system mapped the letter of the telephone number to the digits on the telephone dial. Most other major Canadian and US cities, such as Toronto and Atlanta, were converted from manual exchanges using four digits to a local 2L-4N numbering plan. For example, in Montréal, \"ATwater 1234\" was dialed as six pulls on the dial (\"AT1234\") to send the digit sequence \"281234\". Eventually, starting in the late 1940s, all local numbering plans were changed to the 2L-5N system to prepare for nationwide Direct Distance Dialing. For example, under this system, a well-known number in New York City was listed as PEnnsylvania 6-5000.\n\nIn small towns with a single central office, local calls typically required dialing only four or five-digits at most, without using named exchanges. A toll call required the assistance of an operator, who asked for the name of the town and the local station number. Some independent telephone companies, not part of the Bell System, also did not implement central office names.\n\nIn 1915, newly developed panel switching systems were tested in the Mulberry and Waverly exchanges in Newark, New Jersey. When the technology first appeared in the Mulberry exchange, subscribers had no dials on their telephones and the new system was transparent to them — they asked an operator to ring their called party as usual. However, the operator keyed the number into the panel equipment, instead of making cord connections manually. The panel switch was later, from the early 1920s through the 1930s, installed in large metropolitan areas in the Bell System. By the 1950s twenty cities were served by this type of office.\n\nFrom the time of these first conversions to automated equipment in the 1920s, through the conversions of most manual equipment by the 1960s, it was necessary for telephone numbers to be represented uniformly across the nation. By Bell System policy, customers never needed to be concerned about whether they were calling an automatic or a manual exchange. The 2L-5N system became the North American standard, as customer-dialed long-distance service came into use in the 1950s.\n\nSeveral standard formats of telephone numbers, based on central office names, capitalized the leading letters that were dialed, for example:\n\nIn print, such as on business cards or in advertisements, the full central office name was often shown only by the two letters:\n\nIf the central office was known by a name, but no letters were dialed, it was common to capitalize only the first letter of the central office, e.g., \"Main 600W\" or \"Fairmont 33\". Such numbers were assigned typically in manual offices, and the name would be spoken by a subscriber when requesting a destination. Often these were geographically significant names, such as the town's name.\n\nIn large cities with coexisting manual and dial areas, the numbering was generally standardized to one format. For example, when the last manual exchange in San Francisco was converted to dial in 1953, the numbers had for several years been in the format of JUniper 6-5833. JUniper 4 was automatic, but JUniper 6 was manual. To call JUniper 6 from JUniper 4, the subscriber dialed the number and it was displayed to the B-board operator at JUniper 6, and that operator would complete the connection manually. In the other direction, to call JUniper 4 from JUniper 6, the subscriber would lift the receiver and speak to the JUniper 4 operator who would in turn dial the JUniper 6 number.\n\nDuring the 1950s, cities using six-digit numbers converted to seven-digit dialing. Typically, several six-digit (2L-4N) exchanges were co-located in one building already, with new ones added as old ones had filled up. After the conversion, they were combined into a new 2L-5N exchange. For example, the CHerry, FIllmore, ATwater, and KLondike exchanges might be converted to OXford 1, 3, 6, and 7. Usually customers would keep the same station numbers.\n\nIn the 1940s, the Bell System developed the North American Numbering Plan, a system of initially 86 allocated area codes which were used at first only by switchboard operators to route trunk calls between plan areas. Direct long-distance dialing by customers, using the three-digit area code and a seven-digit telephone number, commenced in the 1950s.\n\nIn 1955, AT&T distributed a list of recommended exchange names that were the result of studies to minimize misunderstandings when spoken. The recommendation was intended for newly established exchanges, and did not mandate any renaming of existing historical names. The number sequences 55\"x\", 57\"x\", 95\"x\", and 97\"x\" had no exchange names specified, as the mappings for the digits 5, 7, and 9 had no vowels, thus making it difficult finding names with those consonant combinations. As a result, those numbers were very seldom assigned to exchanges; however, KLondike was used for 55x in San Francisco and Columbus, Ohio, and WRigley 5 (975) in Chicago (Wrigley Field). On the telephone dial, letters were mapped to digits using the assignments shown in the table (right).\n\nThe following shows AT&T's recommended list of central office names in 1955, sorted by the three-digit office code, where \"x\" can be any digit.\n\nFictitious phone numbers starting with \"55\" used the fictitious exchange name KL\"ondike\" (55). The letters Q and Z were never used in the naming system, but Z was often mapped on the telephone dial to the digit 0 (zero).\n\nAs demand for telephone service grew in the post–World War II period, it was foreseeable that the demand would exceed the addressing capacity of the existing system of using memorable telephone central office names as prefixes in telephone numbers. Several letter combinations had no pronounceable or memorable names and could not be used. Several North American numbering plan areas (NPAs) were divided so that more office codes became available to smaller regions. However, as the growth accelerated, the Bell System decided to implement all-number calling (ANC) and to deprecate the use of central office names to provide more central office codes to each NPA. This extended the usable numbering plan and only two area code splits became necessary between 1962 and 1981. All-number calling was phased in starting in 1958 and most areas had adopted it fully by the mid-1960s. In some areas it did not become universal until the 1980s. The Bell System published and distributed area code handbooks yearly which compiled the towns available for calling using an area code.\n\nExperiencing significant resistance in many areas, the Bell System employed a strategy of gradual changes to ease the transition for customers. Originally, directory listings were printed with the central office name spelled out in full, e.g.,\n\nThe first stage in the conversion only the dialed letters were printed:\n\nAt this stage, the telephone companies had the means to assign letter combinations for central office prefixes that were previously unavailable, thus any set of five- or fewer-digit numbers could be expanded to seven digits:\n\nAt this stage all central office codes could be easily converted into their numerical format:\n\nThe Bell System proceeded to convert existing named exchanges to all-number calling, starting in smaller communities. No significant opposition arose until conversion began in major cities. In some cities such as San Francisco, opposition was organized; the opposition group in San Francisco was called the Anti Digit Dialing League, of which S. I. Hayakawa was a notable member. The opposition caused AT&T to slow down the conversion process, and names continued to be used in cities such as New York, which went to ANC only in 1978. Philadelphia had named exchanges in the Bell of Pennsylvania telephone book as late as 1983, long after AT&T had hoped to complete the conversion.\n\nBell Canada, Alberta Government Telephones, and B.C. Tel completed most conversions of existing numbers during the first half of the 1960s. In Toronto, historically 2L+4N before numbers were lengthened to accommodate the 1957 introduction of direct distance dialling, the March 1966 directory had no exchange names. Typically in larger communities, conversions would be timed with issues of the telephone directory.\n\nFor example, in London, Ontario, three conversions took place starting in February 1962 and completing in September 1963. GEneral 2, 3, and 9 were converted first; later GLadstone 1 and 5, and finally GEneral 4 and 8.\nAn example from Montreal, Quebec, extended from 2L+4N to 2L+5N on August 4, 1957: WIlbank became WEllington 2, WEllington became WEllington 3 (a rare example of keeping the exchange name), FItzroy became WEllington, GLenview became WEllington 7, VEndome became DUpont 7, HEmlock became POntiac 7, TRenmore became POntiac 8, HArbour became VIctor 5, and MArquette became VIctor 9.\n\nThe use of letters in exchange names resulted in the placement of letters on the telephone dial, even outside the areas using the letter and number combinations. Some Canadian areas at first used original letter schemes, notably Calgary, Alberta, until later standardization within North America. Québec exchange names differed from those on standard Bell System lists due to the need for names in the French language; Hull, Quebec's 77x (PR as in PRovince) needed to be recognizable in both languages in 1957.\n\nIn smaller communities with four- or five-digit numbers and a single city exchange, central office names appeared for the first time in the late 1950s, and then solely to match the North American direct distance dial standard of a three-digit area code and seven-digit local number. The names, usually chosen from standard Bell System lists, had no local significance and were short-lived; phase-out began soon after 1960.\n\nVirtually every telephone exchange in Europe was named for its local area (village, town, or city). However, in the largest cities it was clear as early as the 1880s that several exchanges would be needed. These were usually given names reflecting a district of a city, for example \"Holborn\" in London, \"Docks\" in Manchester, \"Leith\" in Edinburgh, or in some cases an entirely unrelated name, e.g., \"Acorn\" or \"Advance\" in London, \"Pyramid\" in Manchester, and \"Midland\" in Birmingham. As automated systems were introduced starting in the late 1920s, the first three letters of these names were used in the numbering plans for those exchanges. The 3L-4N system was notably used in the capital cities Paris and London, both examples of the \"big-city\" problem. Large cities served by many manual exchanges could only be converted to automatic operation gradually, which required a logistics of operating both types simultaneously for several years.\n\nTelephone directories showed the first three letters of the exchange in bold capital letters, when all seven digits were to be dialed. For example, a subscriber number for Scotland Yard on London's Whitehall exchange was shown as \"WHItehall 1212\".\n\nIf the first three letters were capitalized but not bolded, e.g., HAYes 1295, the caller would dial the first three letters only, and when connected to Hayes ask the operator for the local number. Later, \"Coded Call Indicator working\" equipment was installed at some manual exchanges so that the caller could dial all seven digits, and the required number would be displayed to the operator.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the first Director exchange in London, Holborn Tandem, was cutover in 1927; preceded by any necessary changes in the London area, e.g. changing some exchange names and making all local numbers (4N) 4-digit. As each digit represents three letters the same network cannot have exchanges called BRIxton and CRIcklewood, which both correspond to 274. In smaller director areas some A-digit levels were combined so that local director exchange would only need four or fewer groups of directors instead of eight. But if (say) A-digit levels 7 and 8 were combined it would not be possible to have both PERivale and TERminus exchanges in the same network.\n\nThe other main UK conurbations followed suit, namely Manchester in 1930 (e.g., DEAnsgate 3414, the number for Kendals department store), Birmingham (in 1931), Glasgow (in 1937), and later Liverpool and. (c. 1950).\n\nThe standards for converting exchange name letters in Europe varied, notably in the placement of the letters O, Q, and Z.\n\nThe switchover to all figure dialling began in the UK in 1966, although it was not until the early 1970s that all exchange names were converted.\n\nIn Paris and its suburbs, the conversion from 3L-4N to all numbers occurred in October 1963. For example, ÉLYsées became 379, LOUvre 508, PIGalle 744, POMpadour 706... But until October 1985, when an 8th number was added, it remained possible to make use of almost all the previous combinations.\n\nAt least four popular songs use old telephone exchanges in their names: \"PEnnsylvania 6-5000\" (PE 6-5000), recorded by Glenn Miller (the inspiration for that song, the Hotel Pennsylvania in New York City, still holds that phone number as +1-212-736-5000); \"BEechwood 4-5789\", by The Marvelettes; \"LOnesome 7-7203 by Hawkshaw Hawkins; and \"ECho Valley 2-6809\" by The Partridge Family. PEnnsylvania 6-5000 was later spoofed in the Bugs Bunny cartoon \"Transylvania 6-5000\" and the horror/comedy film \"Transylvania 6-5000\".\n\nThe title of \"BUtterfield 8\", the 1935 John O'Hara novel whose film adaptation won Elizabeth Taylor an Academy Award for Best Actress, refers to the exchange of the characters' telephone numbers (on the Upper East Side of Manhattan). Radio show \"Candy Matson, YUkon 2-8209\" first aired on NBC West Coast radio in March 1949.\n\nArtie Shaw and His Gramercy 5—Artie Shaw named his band the Gramercy Five after his home telephone exchange in Greenwich Village. In 1940 the original Gramercy Five pressed eight records, then dissolved this band in early 1941.\n\nThe 1948 Jimmy Stewart film \"Call Northside 777 uses a telephone exchange in its title.\n\nIn episode 9F07 of The Simpsons, \"Mr. Plow\", in which Homer takes up work as a snow-plow operator, the ad he takes out on television shows the Simpsons' phone number as Klondike 5-3226.\n\nStan Freberg, on his 1966 album, \"Freberg Underground\", objected to all digit dialing in song, including the lyric:\n\n<poem>They took away our Murray Hills,\nThey took away our Sycamores,\nThey took away Tuxedo and State,\nThey took away our Plaza, our Yukon, our Michigan,\nAnd left us with 47329768…</poem>\n\nAllan Sherman parodied the controversy of all digit dialing in the song \"The Let's All Call Up AT&T and Protest to the President March\" in his 1963 album \"My Son, the Celebrity\".\n\nHawkshaw Hawkins' only number 1 hit \"Lonesome 7-7203\" in 1963 is based on the US telephone exchange name.\n\nChuck Berry's 1964 rock-n-roll hit, \"Promised Land\", references “Los Angeles give me Norfolk Virginia, Tidewater four ten O nine” (TW4-1009), when he arrives after a bus, train, and plane odyssey across the United States, finds a pay phone, and calls home.\n\nHee Haw featured monotoned straight man Junior Samples and his weekly automobile special at Samples Motors using the phone number gag \"BR-549\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2201333", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2201333", "title": "Dust Devil (film)", "text": "Dust Devil (film)\n\nDust Devil is a 1992 horror film written and directed by Richard Stanley. The film stars Robert Burke as Hitch, a mysterious man who wanders the deserts in Namibia and is wanted by the police in connection with the death of a woman whose blood was used in a supernatural ceremony. It is believed by a local Sngoma that Hitch is a \"Dust Devil\", a supernatural creature that can change its form. Hitch encounters Wendy played by Chelsea Field, who drives with him along a highway as she is pursued by her estranged husband. As police begin investigating the murders, they seem to trace back to Hitch and Wendy discovers the man has supernatural powers.\n\nThe film was shot in Namibia after March 1990. when Stanley presented his script to producer JoAnne Sellar, whom he had previously worked with on his first film \"Hardware\". Sellar was able to secure 2.8 million pounds for \"Dust Devil\". The script was then sent to the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting in Namibia for approval. Sellar was also able to use South African personnel and equipment for the production, making the film's crew a combination of British, American, South African and Namibian people. After finishing filming, \"Dust Devil\" went into difficulty in its early production phases with several different cuts being released in the United Kingdom, the United States and select areas in Europe where the film was released in a much shorter version titled Demonica. The film was released in United Kingdom following the demise of Palace Pictures under an end credit of \"Dust Devil: The Final Cut\". It was released in the United States by Miramax with a shorter running time than the British version.\n\nIn Namibia, a Sngoma named Joe Niemand recites that a story about a man with supernatural powers and was no longer a human being. But having once been a man, he still suffer the passions of a man, \"flying in the rages sometimes, and throwing himself down like a child, to vent his wrath upon the earth.\" and stating that the people of the great Namib refer to them as Dust Devils.\n\nA man walks on a road in the desert, and meets with a woman named Saarke driving along it, who takes him back to her house. While the two have sex, the man kills her. Meanwhile, in the town of Bethanie, Sgt. Ben Mukurob receives a phone call with strange voices speaking, as does Wendy Robinson in Johannesburg, South Africa. In the morning, the man burns down Saarke's house & leaves in her car. In Johannesburg, Wendy's husband Mark accuses her of cheating on him, leading her to leave him and drive to Namibia. Meanwhile, Mukurob and Captain Beyman investigate Saarke's house and find strange pictographs on the wall. Wendy runs her car off the road near a camper with a man near by. After the two push her car back on the road, Wendy then sees Dust Devil on the road side and offers him a ride.. Cpl. Dutoit and Cpl. Bates then find the camper with dismembered body parts inside. Mukurob drives to Joe's home that the symbols found were the work of magic, to which Mukurob scoffs. Wendy and Dust Devil continue driving and pass another hitch-hiker, but Dust Devil tells Wendy not to stop. As they pass the hitch-hiker, Dust Devil disappears.\n\nWith Dust Devil secretly watching, Wendy stops at a small motel for the night and tries to commit suicide but stops herself. Wendy goes to her car the next morning and finds Dust Devil inside, who tells her that she was asleep the day before. Meanwhile, Beyman gives Mukurob documents about murders similar to the one he is following dating back as far as 1908. Wendy and Dust Devil reach the Fish River Canyon as Wendy's husband Mark, arrives in Namibia and begins his search for her. Joe takes Mukurob to a mountain cave and tells him that the murders are the work of the \"naghtloper\", a shape-shifting demon who gains power over the material world through ritual murder. Joe explains that the naghtloper must keep moving to work the ritual, but if he is tricked to step over a kierie stick, he will be bound to one spot and his power can be taken. Joe then gives Mukurob a kierie and a sacred root to burn to prevent the naghtloper from possessing him after it is killed.\n\nWendy discovers human fingers among Dust Devil's belongings which leads to him to attempt to kill her which Wendy escapes. Dust Devil pursues her leading to Wendy crashing her car and escaping into the desert. Meanwhile, Mukurob releases Mark from prison as they search for Wendy. As drive through a dust storm, Dust Devil attacks them, causing the car to flip over. Mukurob handcuffs Mark to the car and heads into the storm, telling him that he has a chance since the naghtloper only takes those who have nothing to live for. Wendy reaches the abandoned town of Kolmanskop where Mukurob finds her and searches for Dust Devil. He runs into Dust Devil, who stabs him. Wendy then finds Dust Devil as Mukurob takes the kierie and puts it in front of Dust Devil as he steps forward. Wendy picks up Mukurob's shotgun and kills Dust Devil as he says, \"I love you, Wendy\". Wendy then walks into the desert past Mark and the car, lies on the road and pulls over a fleet of army Casspirs. The film ends with Joe saying, \"The desert knows her name now, he has stolen both her eyes. When she looks into a mirror, she will see his spirit like a shawl blowing tatters around her shoulders in a haze. And beyond the dim horizon, a tapestry unfolding of the avenues of evil, and all of history set ablaze.\"\n\n\nRichard Stanley's previous film \"Hardware\" was made for £1 million, and grossed over $70 million world-wide. Stanley stated that \"Hardware\" was made to prove to producers that he could make a commercial film after finding that he was rejected by producers from his first scripts. \"Dust Devil\" was shot entirely on location in Namibia, and re-interprets the story of a South African serial killer known as \"Nhadiep\". The story of Nhadiep had previously been the inspiration for the British film \"Windprints\" (1989) by David Wicht. \"Dust Devil\" was made from a previous work of Stanley's, an unfinished 16mm student short film about bizarre murders taking place around the town of Bethanie. The authorities never caught the serial killer, which led to locals believing the killings were caused by a supernatural force. The police eventually returned to town with the body of a man they believed was the killer; however, the body was without a head, which made identification with locals impossible. The man was later buried in a town with a grave marked \"Nhadiep\".\n\nStanley felt his film was not initially a horror film, but admitted the film had traits of the genre. As well as acknowledging Italian gialli films as an influence, he also felt the film was influenced by Alejandro Jodorowsky's \"El Topo\", Luis Buñuel's \"Simon of the Desert\", Pier Paolo Pasolini's \"The Gospel According to Saint Matthew\", and Sergio Leone's \"Once Upon a Time in the West\". Stanley would also described the film as a marriage between Italian \"gialli\" films and the spaghetti westerns of Sergio Leone, specifically noting \"The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly\" declaring that In Leone's film \"cynical privateers looked for buried gold against an American Civil War backdrop, My \"Dust Devil\" characters weave in and out of similar historical events because I updated the murders to run parallel to Namibia's bloody fight for independence from South Africa in 1989.\" Stanley also mentioned an influence of Michele Soavi's film \"The Devil's Daughter\", by using \"his idea of shimmering Virgin Mary blues to similarly represent forces of God.\"\n\nFilming in Namibia became possible following the country's independence in March 1990. Stanley presented his script to producer JoAnne Sellar, who he had previously worked with on \"Hardware\". Sellar was able to secure 2.8 million pounds for \"Dust Devil\". The script was then sent to the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting in Namibia for approval. Sellar was also able to use South African personnel and equipment for the production, making the film's crew a combination of British, American, South African and Namibian people.\n\nPost-production of \"Dust Devil\" began in 1991 in London. Stanley initially had a 120-minute cut of the film, which was tightened to 110 minutes. Stanley hoped the British financiers would find this edit appropriate for release in Europe and the United Kingdom. However, this was not the case; the financiers cut the film to 95 minutes. The 95 minute version was given a test screening in Wimbledon. Stanley stated that the audience was \"clearly confused\", as many of the cuts had taken out parts of the film's first act. Following this screening, Stanley, who was adamant that the previous cut of the film was superior, pushed for an \"extended European cut\" of the film, which would run between 110 and 120 minutes. However, further cuts were made, which gave \"Dust Devil\" a running time of 87 minutes. In April 1992, Palace Pictures began experiencing financial problems, causing them to pull out of distributing the film in the United Kingdom.\n\n\"Dust Devil\" was financied by an amalgamation of British Investors under the Palace Productions umbrella. The film also received some financial backing from Miramax, the distributors of Stanley's previous film \"Hardware\". In December 1991, Stanley delivered his first fine cut, a 120 minute assembly version that was cut to fufill British television contracts. This version was given to Miramax for their consideration who returned it as an 85 minute version. In February 1992, Palace who was on the verge of financial collapse, asked Stanley to accept a cut that was a compromise between the original version and the Miramax edit. Stanley mentioned that \"Palace explained it would be financially expedient to arrive at a compromise but I'd have nothing to do with it. I'd lost footage already and I wasn't willing to go back in the editing room.\" \"Dust Devil\" was initially set to be released in the United Kingdom in December 1992. Due to the withdrawal of Palace Pictures, \"Dust Devil\" was only shown for one week in one cinema in the United Kingdom before being released to home video. A 94 minute cut was test-screend to a what Mark Kermode of \"Shivers\" magazine described as \"a poor reaction.\" A shortened version that was accepted by Miramax was shown in Spain and Portugal under the title \"Demonica\" and was also shown at the Avoriaz Film Festival. After Palace lost its money, Stanley persuaded Polygram to have a new version ready which he personally financed with £15,000. Months later the film was released in the United Kingdom and was identified in the end credits as \"Dust Devil: The Final Cut\".\n\nAn 80-minute cut of the film that was not color-graded was shown in some European territories prior to 1994 which Richard Stanley described as \"an effort to liberate blocked funds and has subsequently been withdrawn with the consent of all parties.\" Stanley wrote to \"Shivers\" magazine published in January 1994 that Miramax were planning to distribute \"Dust Devil\" in January 1994 with a home video release of the film later in the year. The American cut of the film released by Miramax removed about 20 minutes of footage.\n\nStanley recently recorded commentaries and interviews not only for this film, but also for three rarely-seen documentary films he had directed over the last decade and a half, \"Voice of the Moon\", \"The Secret Glory\" and \"The White Darkness\".\n\nIn \"Sight & Sound\", Kim Newman described the film as a \"more personal effort than \"Hardware\"\", and that \"for all it's lean boogey man strengths, this is mainly a hallucinatory picture: Stanley delivers the requisite shocks with a buff's care and enthusiasm, but is obviously more interested in eerie desert images like a valley reported created by the slithering of a giant snake at the dawn of time and other unsettling touches.\"\nNewman concluded that, on viewing any of the several different edits of the film, \"Dust Devil\" was a \"considerable and remarkable film.\"\n\nIn his book \"Horror and Science Fiction Film IV\", Donald C. Willis stated that \"Dust Devil\" was \"handsomely photographed\" but also \"pretentious\" with a \"tired\" ending.\n\n"}

At Gaddi's death, he entered the service of the Farnese family, and became confidential secretary to Pier Luigi Farnese, Duke of Parma, and to his sons, Duke Ottavio and Cardinals Ranuccio and Alexander.\n\nCaro's most important work were his translations (see below). He is also the author of poems, sonnets, and a comedy called \"Gli Straccioni\". His work additionally includes two clever \"jeux d'esprit\": \"La Fichelde\", in praise of figs, and a eulogy of the big nose of Leoni Ancona, a local figure. His poetry is noted for the freedom and grace of its versification, so that many claim that he brought \"verso sciolto\" to its highest form in Italy. Letters he wrote, both in his own name and on behalf of the Cardinals Farnese, are considered remarkable for both the baseness they display and for their euphemistic polish and elegance.\n\nCaro's fame was diminished because of the virulence with which he attacked Lodovico Castelvetro in one of his \"canzoni\", and by his meanness for denouncing him to the Church for translating some of the writings of Philipp Melanchthon, an associate of Martin Luther. \n\nIn 1555 Caro was installed as a \"knight of grace\" (a member not taking religious vows) of the Order of Malta by Cardinal Alessandro Farnese.\n\nCaro died in Frascati in 1566 and was buried in the Church of San Lorenzo in Damaso in Rome. His prose includes translations of Aristotle, Cyprian, and Gregory Nazianzen.\n\nAnnibal Caro published a translation of the \"Aeneid\" of Vergil, which was much admired by contemporaries, and still is read with pleasure by the lovers of the Italian language. Another translation, which remained the standard one for several centuries, is that of \"Daphnis and Chloe\", the ancient Greek novel by Longus.\n\n"}

{"id": "2201359", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2201359", "title": "Phil Taylor (musician)", "text": "Phil Taylor (musician)\n\nPhilip John Taylor (21 September 1954 – 11 November 2015), better known as \"Philthy Animal\", was an English drummer for the rock band Motörhead from 1975–1984 and 1987–1992, recording eleven studio albums and four live albums. The Motörhead line-up consisting of Taylor, Lemmy, and \"Fast\" Eddie Clarke is generally regarded as the 'classic' line-up of the band.\n\nBorn on 21 September 1954, in Hasland, Chesterfield, Taylor grew up in Leeds. He took drum lessons at Leeds College of Music on advice from his father. After meeting Lemmy, who was a fellow speed user, he joined Motörhead and replaced Lucas Fox during the recording of the band's first album \"On Parole\" in 1975. Lemmy has said that Fox wasn't working out and Taylor \"had a car and could give us a lift back down to the studio\". Taylor, in turn, introduced Lemmy to guitarist \"Fast\" Eddie Clarke, having worked with him while painting a houseboat. \n\nShortly after recording the classic \"Ace of Spades\" album in 1980, Taylor broke his neck after being lifted above the head of a friend in a test of strength, only to be dropped on his head. Taylor continued to play in Motörhead with the aid of a neck brace, as is visible in the music video for \"Ace of Spades\". As a result, Taylor had a prominent lump located on the back of his neck (affectionately referred to as his \"knob\"), thought to be a calcium deposit caused by his previous spinal trauma. Tour-disrupting injuries were not unfamiliar to Taylor at the time, as he had previously broken his hand whilst punching a man outside his flat in London. Taylor continued to drum by using gaffer tape to attach his drum stick into his hand until it had sufficiently healed.\nTaylor left Motörhead in 1984. The following year, he made appearances with Waysted, and joined former Motörhead and Thin Lizzy guitarist Brian Robertson to form the band Operator. In 1986, he was part of Frankie Miller's touring band.\n\nTaylor returned to Motörhead in 1987. He said \"I always regretted leaving. Let's just say I took a three-year holiday.\" He continued playing in the group until 1992. After having been warned three times in the previous two years \"to get his act together\", he was fired after recording \"I Ain't No Nice Guy\", because of his poor performance.\n\nFrom 2005 to 2008 Taylor played and recorded in a group called The Web of Spider with Whitey Kirst (Iggy Pop) on guitar and Max Noce on bass. In 2007 Taylor briefly worked on a project called Capricorn with former Danzig guitarist Todd Youth, former Monster Magnet guitarist Phil Caivano and former Nashville Pussy bassist Corey Parks. After playing in The Web of Spider, Taylor began work on a project with guitarist Chris Holmes, formerly of the heavy metal band W.A.S.P., and in 2009, Taylor joined American thrash metal band Overkill for a set at the Islington Academy. The set included a cover of the Motörhead song from which Overkill took their name.\n\nHe sporadically played drums for Mick Farren and The Deviants, featuring on \"Dr. Crow\" (2002), \"Sheep in Wolves' Clothing\" (2008), and \"Portobello Shuffle\" (2009).\n\nTaylor reunited with Lemmy and Clarke on 6 November 2014 at the National Indoor Arena in Birmingham, on stage for Motörhead's classic \"Ace of Spades\" only to come on to wave to the crowd and leave.\n\nPhil Taylor died on 11 November 2015, in London, at the age of 61 after an illness. Liver failure was cited as a cause.\n\n\"Fast\" Eddie Clarke said of his former bandmate:\nLemmy told \"Classic Rock\" that he was \"devastated\" to have lost one of his best friends as he also remembered former Motörhead guitarist Michael \"Würzel\" Burston, who died in 2011.\n\nLemmy died on 28 December 2015, less than seven weeks after Taylor and on 10 January 2018 \"Fast Eddie\" Clarke also died, leaving none of the classic \"Ace of Spades\"-era Mötorhead lineup alive.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2201365", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2201365", "title": "Buschwhacker", "text": "Buschwhacker\n\nBuschwhacker is a term for NASCAR drivers who are regulars in the top-level NASCAR Cup Series but who also compete on a regular basis in the second-tier Xfinity Series. The original coinage of the term \"Buschwhacker\" refers to Anheuser-Busch's longtime title sponsorship of the second-tier series through their Busch beer brand.\n\nThe practice is controversial due to Cup drivers such as Kyle Busch, Mark Martin, Kevin Harvick (numbers one, two, and three all time in wins in the Xfinity Series), Darrell Waltrip and Dale Earnhardt entering a large portion of races over the course of the season and dominating the races in superior equipment, taking good finishes, competitive rides and sponsorship, and exposure away from both development drivers and veterans who are regulars in the series. Many NASCAR experts, however, contend that without Cup drivers and the large amount of fan interest and sponsorship they attract, the series would cease to exist.\n\nDue to NASCAR rules changes that took effect in 2011, drivers must now select one of the top three touring series and be eligible for the driver points championship in that class only. This prevents Cup Series regulars from also competing for points in the lower series. Before these changes, the last series regular to win the Nationwide Series points title was Martin Truex Jr., winning in 2004 and 2005. Despite these changes, Cup drivers have continued their dominance, shifting their focus to winning the owners' championship. In the five years following the rule change, the owners' champions were the #60 team of Roush Fenway Racing with Carl Edwards racing the majority of the season in 2011, the #18 with various Joe Gibbs Racing drivers in 2012, and the #22 of Team Penske from 2013 to 2015 with Brad Keselowski and Joey Logano running the majority of the races.\n\nThe primary advantage of running both Cup and Xfinity Series races is extra practice (\"seat time\") for the drivers. Xfinity races are often run as support races a day prior to Cup Series races, and use similar equipment, though Xfinity cars have less horsepower than Cup cars. Some racing experts suggested that when the Cup series transitioned to the safety-oriented Car of Tomorrow in 2007, the advantage of Cup drivers racing in these events would decrease greatly due to differences in the designs of the vehicles. However, this did not decrease the presence of Cup drivers in the series, as each Xfinity Series (then known as the Nationwide Series) drivers' title from 2006 to 2010 was won by a Cup Series regular. The aerodynamic differences of the two series were greatly reduced when the Nationwide Series implemented its own Car of Tomorrow in 2010.\n\nThe practice is also seen in the third-tier Gander RV & Outdoors Truck Series, particularly by Kyle Busch (who currently operates his own team Kyle Busch Motorsports, in the Truck Series), and Kevin Harvick (who formerly operated Kevin Harvick Incorporated from 2002 to 2012). Busch's #51 truck won the owner's championship in 2013, with Busch running 11 of the 22 races and scoring 5 wins, and again in 2014, where Busch won 7 out of the 10 races he participated in. Cup drivers occasionally dabble in NASCAR's regional series, such as Ryan Newman running select Whelen Modified Tour events for Kevin Manion and Mike Curb, the sister ARCA Racing Series, and local dirt and short track events.\n\nThe presence of Buschwhackers is seen as problematic by some regulars in the lower series, who complain about more accomplished Cup drivers taking the top prize money and thus leading to loss of sponsorship for their efforts. Cup drivers often run in cars fielded by or affiliated with their Cup Series teams, giving them superior equipment and increased resources. The presence of the Cup teams have driven up the costs of competition, forcing many independent Xfinity Series teams to shut their doors. Many sponsors are hesitant to put financial backing behind an unproven driver, insisting that Cup drivers run in at least part of the schedule, which has led to several incidents of young drivers receiving part-time schedules or being pulled from an entry before (or even during) a race in favor of a Cup driver. In 2008, for example, Kelly Bires was forced to sit out the Daytona season opener due to contractual obligations with JR Motorsports' sponsor Unilever stating that Dale Earnhardt Jr. drive a certain number of races for the team. Other criticisms of \"buschwacking\" cite the lack of Xfinity Series veterans left in the series. Long-time series regulars and champions (such as Steve Grissom, David Green, Randy LaJoie, Jason Keller, Casey Atwood, and Ashton Lewis, Jr.) have seen their exit from the series in the 2000s, while 2000 champion Jeff Green has driven primarily in start and park entries since 2011.\n\nWhile Cup drivers attract fans to the lower-tier series, many fans are turned off by the dominance of the senior circuit competitors over their junior league competitors, with Cup drivers often winning over half of the races in a season. Comparisons have been drawn to a top-tier Major League Baseball player competing against minor-leaguers, or adults competing against children. Some drivers, including Dale Earnhardt, Jr., have also been critical of the dominance of Cup competitors. (During the 2017 Xfinity Series season, Earnhardt's four full-time Xfinity teams were driven by Xfinity regulars, and Cup drivers ran a fifth car in only four races. Earnhardt plans four full-time teams in 2018 and no Cup driver is scheduled in his fifth car, which he will participate in a minimum of two races, but will not be a Cup regular.) Many fans, as well as longtime series regular Kenny Wallace, also note the increased focus given to Cup drivers during the broadcast and promotion of the races. This changed beginning in 2012, when NASCAR produced several commercials promoting up-and-coming series regulars.\n\nIn spite of the negatives of the practice, the presence of NASCAR's top-level drivers attracts sponsorship to the lower series that may not be there without them, adds credibility to the series, and makes it easier for tracks to promote races. Many series regulars have also pointed out that the presence of Cup regulars allows them to improve their own driving styles and compete against the best in the sport. The series does still serve its purpose for driver development, with a steady influx of successful new drivers into the Sprint Cup Series: e.g., in 2007 three of the Top 10 drivers had less than four years of Cup experience, eight of the ten had less than 10 years of Cup experience, and only one (Jeff Burton) was over 40 years of age. All eight drivers of the 2014 Sprint Cup Rookie class (Kyle Larson, Austin Dillon, Justin Allgaier, Cole Whitt, Alex Bowman, Michael Annett, Ryan Truex, Parker Kligerman) had significant experience in the Nationwide Series, with six of them running at least one full season. The series also continues to provide an outlet for former Cup drivers (such as Elliott Sadler, Regan Smith, and Sam Hornish, Jr.) to rebuild their careers, or as Dale Earnhardt, Jr. plans, a way to race a limited schedule in semi-retirement, as does the Truck Series for drivers such as Ron Hornaday, Jr. and Johnny Sauter.\n\nCup crew chiefs have also been developed from this level. Kyle Busch often uses a developmental crew chief in most of his wins; Dave Rogers and Adam Stevens, two of the current Joe Gibbs Racing crew chiefs at the Sprint Cup level, both used the Xfinity level to move up. Greg Ives was the 2014 Xfinity Series champion crew chief with Chase Elliott before being called up to the Sprint Cup level in 2015 to be Dale Earnhardt Jr.'s crew chief. In some cases, a Cup driver will use a developmental engineer or crew chief, and an Xfinity regular may use an experienced Cup-level engineer.\n\nAlthough one of the original purposes of the second-tier series was for driver development, Cup Series drivers have been moonlighting in the series since its inception in 1982 (as the Budweiser Late Model Sportsman Series), when Winston Cup Champion Dale Earnhardt won the series' inaugural event at Daytona International Speedway. Prior to the year 2000, Cup drivers would often limit their schedules in the Busch Series, partially because the majority of the races were held at separate venues from the Cup Series. Two of the most notable drivers to frequent the second-tier series, Mark Martin and Harry Gant, have never run more than 17 Busch series races during any single season in their career except for Martin's 1987 season. In the past, Cup drivers had also run in equipment independent from Cup Series teams; drivers Michael Waltrip and Joe Nemechek for example fielded their own race teams in the then-Busch Series for many years. The presence of veteran Cup drivers helped to develop several future Cup Series regulars, including Jeff Gordon, Bobby Labonte, and Jeff Burton.\n\nIn 2003, Richard Childress Racing set out to win the Busch Series Owner's Championship with their 21 Car sponsored by The Hershey Company's PayDay brand. Cup driver Kevin Harvick was tabbed to drive 15 of the 34 races, with development driver Johnny Sauter filling out the rest of the schedule. Harvick ended up running 19 races, with three wins and top tens in all but one race, and RCR became the first team to win an owner's points title with two different drivers. Since then, the presence of Cup drivers and teams has increased; RCR for example continued to run the 21 with Harvick as well as a full-time 29 car with Jeff Burton for the owner's championship, while the 2 car with Clint Bowyer won the driver's championship in 2008. Several other non-rookie Sprint Cup Series drivers, including Greg Biffle, Carl Edwards, J. J. Yeley, Denny Hamlin, and Reed Sorenson, began running the entire Nationwide schedule while also competing in a full season of Sprint Cup, even though on some weekends the two series competed at venues hundreds of miles apart.\n\nIn 2006, only two non-Cup Series regulars won a race during the 35-race schedule: David Gilliland and Paul Menard. Menard and Johnny Sauter were the only Busch Series regulars to finish in the top-10 in points that season. In 2007, only three Busch drivers scored a victory: Aric Almirola, Stephen Leicht and Jason Leffler. Almirola's victory at the Milwaukee Mile on June 23 was controversial and unusual, as Almirola was pulled from his pole-winning car after leading 42 of the first 58 laps to make room for Cup regular Denny Hamlin, due to obligations with sponsor Rockwell Automation which is headquartered in Milwaukee. Hamlin was scheduled to compete in a Cup event at Infineon Raceway the same weekend, and had several delays in his trek from California to Wisconsin. Despite the loss in track position due to the driver change, Hamlin got back to the front to take the checkered flag after 250 laps. Almirola was officially credited with the win because he made the start, but did not participate in victory celebrations.\n\nThere have been some proposals made to restrict Cup regulars' participation in the now-Xfinity Series, including increasing the purse for series regulars, not awarding championship points to such drivers, forcing Cup drivers to start at the back, or restricting the number of races a Cup driver can run in the other series. In late 2010, media reports began to indicate that NASCAR would respond to the critics of \"claim jumping\" by effectively splitting the difference between the two extremes of unrestricted presence of Cup drivers and none at all. It was specifically reported that in 2011, Cup drivers would be allowed to run in the Nationwide Series, but not to compete for the series championship. This rule change was confirmed by \"NASCAR.com\" in a report on January 11, 2011. Drivers are now allowed to compete for the championship in only one of NASCAR's three national touring series in a given season. The NASCAR license application form now includes a check box requiring drivers to select the series in which they wish to compete for the championship. NASCAR president and CEO Brian France officially announced this change on January 26, adding that Cup Series drivers will still be allowed to earn owner's points, but not driver's points, in the Nationwide and Truck Series.\n\nIn spite of the rule changes, between 2011 and March 2014, Nationwide Series regulars have only gone to victory lane in 28 of the 103 races run during that period. 2013 also saw Austin Dillon win the series championship without scoring a win.\n\nOn October 26, 2016, NASCAR announced plans to limit Cup participation in the lower series starting in 2017. Cup drivers with at least five years of experience in the series would be allowed to compete in up to ten Xfinity and seven Truck Series races, and are banned from racing in the final eight races of the lower series season (regular season finale and Chase races) and the Xfinity Dash 4 Cash races but that number will be reduced to up to seven Xfinity Series races and up to five Camping World Truck Series races in 2018. The new restrictions for 2018 also include an outright prohibition of full-time Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series drivers from the 12 (Xfinity) or eight (Truck) protected races (the seven playoff races, the Las Vegas regular season finale in both series and the four bonus money program races in Xfinity).\n\nThe term originated in an argument Craig Witkowski had with another user \"Tinadog\" in the Usenet newsgroup rec.autos.sport.NASCAR (\"rasn\" for short) in May 1997. Tinadog was against Dale Earnhardt and liked Mark Martin, and Witkowski the reverse. Witkowski was especially critical of Martin using his Winston Cup team and resources to beat up on the drivers in the lower Busch Grand National Series. The old western term of \"bushwhacker\" was morphed into \"Busch Whacker\".\n\nThe term continued in use among the regulars on , referring now to any driver whose primary ride is in the Cup series and cherry-picks Busch races. The term was picked up by Fox Sports broadcaster Mike Joy, who also participated in the group. After Joy used the term in his broadcasts, it was picked up by other members of the media and found its way into common use. Joy gave credit on the air with 57 laps to go in the Fox telecast of the Koolerz 300 Busch Series race at Daytona International Speedway in 2003.\n\nFox later discontinued the use of the term on its telecasts. This may have been done to save face among the critics of this practice, or perhaps because few of the leaders were non-Sprint Cup Series drivers anymore.\n\nWhen the Busch Series became the Nationwide Series, the term \"claim jumper\" was coined and used by Fox broadcaster Larry McReynolds initially, as Nationwide is an insurance company.

Within the building are located four schools:\n\n\nThe building is located on the site of the former Fort George Amusement Park. The school opened on February 2, 1917, as an annex of Morris High School. George Washington High School was founded in 1919, and moved into the building in 1925. It was known by that name until 1999, when the building was divided into the four small schools.\n\nGeorge Washington Education Campus has a Works Progress Administration (WPA) mural, \"The Evolution of Music\", painted by Lucienne Bloch in 1938. This mural was painted in a room originally used as a music room and later as a dance studio.\n\nThe campus also houses one of only two NJROTC units in New York City, in its basement, led by Commander Edward Gunning (Ret.) and Chief Petty Officer John Sikora (Ret.).\n\nID cards were first used in the school in February 1972 for students and staff. Currently, the building has scanning machines. In order to enter the building, one must go through scanning.\n\nNew York-Presbyterian Hospital maintains a clinic on the first floor.\n\nIn 1989, the Trojan American football team won the 1989 City \"B\" Division Championship. They defeated Lincoln High School in the championship game. On November 23, 2008, the squad defeated Far Rockaway High School (Queens), 20–14, in an overtime finish at the Midwood Athletic Complex in Brooklyn. The victory earned GW the 2008 PSAL Cup Championship, their first football title since 1988. Far Rock beat GW 38–8 in the season opener. It was their only loss of the season. The Trojans won their next nine games, holding their last four opponents to a total of 21 points. That included defeating previously unbeaten South Bronx HS, 24–8, to earn the trip to the championship game.\n\nOn June 6, 2008, the George Washington Trojans baseball team beat the James Madison Knights, with an 11th-inning finish of 4-0, to win the Division \"A\" City Championship at Shea Stadium.\n\nOn June 9, 2006, the George Washington Trojans baseball team went to the championship to play against James Monroe High School of the Bronx, but lost the championship to Monroe (#1 James Monroe 4, #3 George Washington 0). In 2004, the team went to the championship to play against Monroe High School of the Bronx but lost the championship.\n\nIn 2000, the baseball/football/track field was fixed by the City of New York, with the help of some players from the New York Yankees.\n\n\nBaseball coach Steve Mandl won three championships in 27 years. He was suspended by the PSAL for 16 months for \"recruiting violations\" and was reinstated to his job thereafter; the case prompted questions about how the PSAL handles charges brought without witnesses or evidence. According to \"The New York Times\", \"The Mandl case offers another perspective: the possibility that petty, meritless charges can get traction and turn the disciplinary process itself into a form of punishment long before a verdict has been reached.\" \nAlumni include:\n\nFictional alumni include:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2201378", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2201378", "title": "Carrie Kelley", "text": "Carrie Kelley\n\nCaroline Keene \"Carrie\" Kelley is a fictional character from Frank Miller's graphic novels \"Batman: The Dark Knight Returns\" (1986) and its sequels \"Batman: The Dark Knight Strikes Again\" (2001-2002) and \"\" (2015-2017). She becomes the new Robin in \"The Dark Knight Returns\" when she saves Batman's life. Later in \"The Dark Knight Strikes Again\", she adopts the identity Catgirl, and in \"The Dark Knight III: The Master Race\", she adopts the identity Batwoman. She was the first full-time female Robin in the history of the Batman franchise, though Julie Madison had passed off as Robin for a brief time in a Bob Kane story published in \"Detective Comics\" #49 in March 1941.\n\nAccording to Frank Miller, the idea to create Carrie Kelley was sparked by a conversation of him with superhero comics veteran John Byrne while they were flying to an Ohio comic convention. When Miller told Byrne he was writing a Batman story featuring an old and crankier Batman, Byrne recommended him to make Robin a girl and drew him a sketch. Miller liked the concept so much and ultimately included it into \"The Dark Knight Returns\".\n\nCarrie Kelley is a 13-year-old schoolgirl and scout whom Batman saves from a sadistic group of Mutant gang members on the night of his return from retirement. Idolizing the Dark Knight, she then spends her lunch money on a Robin outfit, sets out to attack petty con-men and to find Batman in the hope of becoming his partner. Kelley uses a slingshot and firecrackers as weapons. She also wears green-tinted sunglasses in lieu of a black domino mask. Like most of the young characters in the book, she speaks in a futuristic slang that Miller credited colorist (and Miller's wife) Lynn Varley with helping to create.\n\nUnlike the first and second Robins mentioned in the story, Kelley is not an orphan, but she appears to have rather ignorant and neglectful parents who are never actually seen—one of them mutters \"Didn't we have a kid?\" while their daughter is witnessing the fierce battle between Batman and the street gangs known as the Mutants. It is hinted through their dialogue that they were once activists and possibly hippies during the 1960's, but have since become apathetic stoners.\n\nIn the series, the government's banning of superhero activities and Jason Todd's death had led to the Dark Knight's retirement, but Batman accepts her as Robin when she saves his life just as he is on the verge of being killed by the Mutant Leader by jumping on him from behind and tearing at his eyes. She practically drags him back to the Batmobile and makes a sling for his arm out of part of her cape and a piece of pipe. He often threatens to fire her but she shows considerable ability and improvisation which impresses him enough to give her a stay of dismissal even when she disobeys his orders. The police, now led by newly-appointed Commissioner Ellen Yindel, takes a very poor attitude to Batman and his methods and issues a warrant for his arrest. When she sees Batman with Kelley leaping in mid-air and barely catching a passing hang-glider, Yindel adds child endangerment to the growing list of charges against Batman.\n\nAs Robin, Carrie plays a crucial part in tracking down and confronting the Joker who (at a fairground) has poisoned several children and planted a bomb on a roller coaster. While Batman goes after his age-old nemesis, Carrie manages to dispose of the bomb but gets into a tangle with Fat Abner, Joker's accomplice. As they grapple together, Abner is decapitated by an overhanging section of the track, driving Carrie momentarily into shock and tears, but recovering enough to rescue a seriously injured Batman from capture by the police and help heal his wounds with Alfred Pennyworth. Unnerved by Batman's activities, the United States government sends Superman to bring the Dark Knight down. As the big battle is about to start, Carrie delays Superman's arrival using the tank-like Bat-mobile and a slingshot, to which the Man of Steel simply replies \"Isn't tonight a school night?\" Using a variety of powerful weapons, including self-made kryptonite, Batman manages to defeat Superman but \"dies\" in the process. It later emerges that he had faked his own death and Carrie unearthed Batman from his grave soon after he revived. They then go underground to the Batcave where, with Green Arrow, they set about training various teenage street gangs into an army in preparation to deal with people \"worse than thieves and murderers.\"\n\nThree years later, Kelley has begun calling herself \"Catgirl\". She still remains Batman's able second-in-command. She wears a skin-tight cat costume with a leopard pattern, and is now trained extensively in combat. Her equipment includes motorised rollerskates and an arm cannon that fired batarangs. Catgirl's main duty is to oversee an army of Batboys to help save the world from a police-state dictatorship, led by Lex Luthor and Brainiac. She leads them into battle, liberating imprisoned heroes such as the Atom and Flash. However, she also causes serious injury to a Batboy who exceeded her orders by maiming and killing a couple of police officers. She beats him up and tells the others to treat him but not bother with anesthetic. Once alone, however, she breaks down in tears but is offered a comforting hand by Batman. She has been referred to as \"The daughter [Batman] never had\" but also as \"jailbait\".\n\nCarrie eventually comes into conflict with a supernatural man resembling Joker and attempts to kill the man with arrows, thermite, acid and C4. However, the man still returns to make an attempt on her life in the Batcave, turning out to be a now-homicidal Dick Grayson having resented her because he had been shoddily treated and dumped by Batman. Her lips are badly lacerated and several of her bones are broken in the fight. Thinking that she is about to die, she tells Batman that she loves him, with Batman later reflecting that he feels the same (Frank Miller clarified in an interview in the book \"Batman through the Ages\" that Batman saw Carrie as a daughter, meaning Carrie most likely saw Batman as a father figure). Batman, however, arrives and stalls Grayson long enough for Ralph Dibny to get Carrie to safety. It was noted that Carrie was developing feelings for Atom.\n\nThree years after being missing, Batman makes some appearances in Gotham for the first time. After a confrontation with the GCPD and Commissioner Yindel, Batman is apprehended and unmasked revealing it is Carrie Kelley under the cowl. She claims Bruce Wayne is dead. Later, Kelley tells Yindel the story about Batman passing on his bed after being beaten by a villain. While being transferred to Blackgate prison, Kelley remotely activates a tank that attacks the convoy and helps her escape, then she reunites with Wayne at the Batcave.\n\nKelley and Wayne see the news on the Kandorians, led by Quar, giving mankind three days to surrender to their demands and accept them as gods. Bruce and Carrie go to the Fortress of Solitude and wakes Superman, who has been sitting and covered by ice for three years, up. Carrie reunites with the Bat Boys Army while Batman and Superman defy Quar. After being defeated by Lara, Superman is encased in black matter by Quar, who turns to Gotham and demands them for Batman to be handed over to him or face obliteration. Bruce presents Carrie, as “graduation present”, a green and purple Batgirl gear and sent her on a mission to engage Aquaman’s help to find and free Superman.\n\nAfter the Kryptonians are defeated, Carrie is attacked by Baal. She defends herself and using a slingshot and a small kryptonite rock she disfigures Baal’s face. Lara confronts Carrie and it’s about to kill her when Diana stops her. Carrie witness the fight between Diana and Lara, impressed by the power both of them show. Later, Batgirl finds out that Batman was killed by Quar before escaping. She talks to Yindel at the destroyed batsignal and tells her to get a new one to stay in touch. While discussing with The Flash in the Batcave, a younger Bruce comes back after being immersed by Superman in the Lazarus Pit.\n\nWhile following a lead on a crime, Commissioner Yindel is captured by Bruno and the Jokers but is saved by Batman and Batgirl. They then head to the desert where the Kryptonians are joining forces again and use a band of bats to confuse them, causing to disparately attack themselves, the rest are eliminated by the four remaining Quar’s children. Superman, Batman and Batgirl then attack them but they go nuclear and are about to explode when The Atom appears and reduces them in size so the explosions are insignificant. \n\nTwo months later Superman is nowhere to be found and Bruce wonders where he could be. Carrie shows up with a new black suit and formally becomes Batwoman.\n\nIn September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Carrie Kelley makes her first appearance in \"Batman and Robin\" #19 (titled \"Batman and Red Robin\"). She is a college student and Damian Wayne's acting instructor. As a homage to \"The Dark Knight Returns\", she wears a Robin costume as a Halloween costume on her first appearance.\n\nIn \"Batman Annual #2\", in a world where Batman and Catwoman have grown old together, Carrie is among those of the Bat family standing by Bruce's bedside as he dies.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It followed the adventures of the Hemisphere Emergency Action Team (H.E.A.T.), a group of top-secret agents based in Puerto Vallarta, Acapulco in Mexico, recruited by \"C-5\", a secret, inter-governmental coalition to fight terrorism and other international crimes. To keep a low profile, the team posed as models and photographers representing a beach-fashion business. The show returned for a second season (production started in 1996) with a new and smaller cast; it aired in Europe in 1997, and in the USA during 1998–99.\n\nLed by Ashley Hunter-Coddington (Catherine Oxenberg), a former MI6 operative, and Mike Savage (Brendan Kelly), a former CIA agent, the H.E.A.T. members fight international terrorism and other crimes. They receive their assignments from \"Mr. Smith\" (John Vernon), the mysterious head of C-5, a secret governmental organization linked to the United Nations. The team operates from both Puerto Vallarta, Mexico and internationally under the 'cover' of a beach fashion enterprise.\nThe team's members are: Catherine \"Cat\" Avery Pascal (Alison Armitage), a former cat-burglar who had to choose between life imprisonment and working in H.E.A.T. for a year in order to have a \"clean-slate\"; Tommy Chase (Michael Worth), a martial arts expert with a deep understanding of human psychology; Brett Richardson (Spencer Rochfort), a former Navy SEAL with a vast knowledge of explosives; Krissie Valentine (Holly Floria), a computer genius who can do anything with computers, no matter the situation and, who eventually becomes romantically involved with teammate, Marcos Chavez (Randy Vasquez), a member of Mexico's Los Federales, and whose local contacts in their base-of-operations prove very helpful; Arthur Small (Graham Heywood), owner of Acapulco H.E.A.T. Beach Fashion who manages both the team's logistics and its members' false identities in the \"Beach Fashion Enterprise\" and, Claudio Divanti (Fabio), owner of the hotel where the team is headquartered.\n\nCatherine (\"Cat\") Avery Pascal and Tommy Chase are the only original characters to return in Season Two. The Season Two storyline explained the time gap (about 3 years) between seasons by stating that the (Season One) H.E.A.T. team had disbanded a few years after the events of Season One. In the interim, \"Cat\" became a beach-fashion photographer, and Tommy became a \"lone wolf\". The two were recruited by ex-spy Nicole Bernard (Lydie Denier) and her protégée, Joanna Barnes (Christa Sauls) a computer expert. They continued fighting international crime backed by private investors; their \"cover\": owners of a beach-fashion boutique (\"Acapulco HEAT Beach Fashion\").\n\nThe show initially produced only one season (1993–94). Following a two-year hiatus, \"Acapulco H.E.A.T.\" was brought back for a second season with a mostly new cast. This second season was produced in 1996 for worldwide distribution but also aired in the U.S. during the 1998–99 television season. A total of 48 episodes were made and have developed a fan base and international audience. The series continues to be broadcast on cable and streaming channels. A feature film is in development based on the series and several major studios are considering the project for production.\n\nThe show had a memorable theme song, \"I Feel the Heat,\" sung by Sable Jeffries (first season) and Pepper Mashay (second season).\n\n\n\nIn Season 2 episode 'Blood Ties', original cast members from Season 1, Spencer Rochfort and Randy Vazquez, returned for a special appearance as their characters Brett Richardson and Marcos Chavez.\n\n\nThe first season was produced for syndication in the United States for the 1993–94 television season.\n\nThe second season was produced in 1996 for European distribution and airing in 1997, but was not syndicated in the United States until the 1998–99 television season. The dates listed below are the U.S. airdates.\n\nMill Creek Entertainment released the entire series on DVD in Region 1 in 2006. On May 6, 2008, Mill Creek Entertainment released \"Acapulco H.E.A.T.- The Complete series\", an 11-disc boxset featuring all 48 episodes of the series.\n\nAs of 2010, these releases have been discontinued and are out of print.

At club level, he made more than 300 appearances in the Football League and the Premier League, playing for Newcastle United, Manchester City, Leicester City, Bolton Wanderers and Hartlepool United. He also played briefly for the New England Revolution of Major League Soccer.\n\nHowey started his career with Newcastle United signing a professional contract on 11 December 1989. At first he was playing in the striker position for the youth and reserve teams until Ossie Ardiles conceived the idea of moving him from the attack back into the defence. Howey was an important part of Kevin Keegan's First Division championship winning side in 1992/93, winning promotion to the Premier League. Once promoted, Howey continued to be a first-choice centre back but was often missing through injury. During Howey's time at Newcastle they were Premier League runner-up twice in 1995/96 and 1996/97 in addition to FA Cup runner-up in 1997/98 and 1998/99. Howey is still a very popular figure in Newcastle as part of a successful influx from Newcastle's youth academy which also included Steve Watson, Robbie Elliott and Lee Clark.\n\nIn August 2000 newly promoted Man City paid Newcastle £2,000,000 for him. His debut came in a 4–0 defeat to Charlton setting the tone for a disappointing season which saw Man City relegated. Howey remained at Man City the following season as part of the team which secured an immediate return to the Premier League as First Division champions. One last season at Man City saw Howey contribute to a top half finish and comfortable survival. In his three seasons with Man City Howey scored 11 goals. A highlight of his time at Manchester City was scoring a late equaliser against rivals Manchester United at Old Trafford, in a game more remembered for the clash between Roy Keane and Alf-Inge Håland.\n\nA £200,000 move to Leicester City followed however after six months Howey moved on to Bolton. Less than five months and only three appearances later Howey was released. A short spell with New England Revolution in Major League Soccer followed before a final professional appearance with Hartlepool United brought down the curtain on his sixteen-year professional career.\n\nHowey earned four caps for England, starting all four matches. He made his debut in the 1–0 win against Nigeria at Wembley Stadium in November 1994. He won caps in the draws with Colombia and Portugal in 1995 before making his final appearance in the 1–0 victory over Bulgaria in March 1996. Howey was called up to the England squad for Euro 96, and was an unused substitute in the first match against Switzerland, but was not fit enough to be on the team sheet for the remaining four matches. He was never called up to the full squad again.\n\nHowey had a short, unsuccessful spell as Manager of Crook Town, taking the helm in September 2006 and resigning just two months later after a poor run of results. He followed this with a spell as a Youth Team Coach at Middlesbrough before making a playing return with National League side Bishop Auckland who he also served in a coaching capacity.

{"id": "2201403", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2201403", "title": "Leopold Spinner", "text": "Leopold Spinner\n\nLeopold Spinner (26 April 1906 – 12 August 1980) was an Austrian-born, British-domiciled composer and editor.\n\nSpinner was born of Austrian parentage in Lemberg (now Lviv, the Ukraine, Lwów, Poland during the interwar period). From 1926 to 1930 he studied composition in Vienna with Paul Amadeus Pisk and afterwards began to attract international attention with works which were performed at the ISCM Festivals or awarded prizes . Nevertheless, from 1935 to 1938 he underwent a second period of study, as a pupil of Anton Webern. He may be regarded as a representative of the so-called Second Viennese School. In 1939 Spinner emigrated to England and spent the war years in Yorkshire, working part of the time as a lathe operator in a locomotive factory in Bradford. From 1947 he worked as a music-copyist and arranger for Boosey & Hawkes , moving to London in 1954. In 1958 he succeeded Erwin Stein as editor at Boosey & Hawkes, later becoming Chief Editor . He remained with Boosey & Hawkes until his retirement in 1975. His skills and exactitude were highly praised by Stravinsky.\n\nFrom 1926 to his death in London in 1980 Spinner steadily and painstakingly built up an individual body of work , adapting and renewing classical forms along the lines (but eventually, much further) that had been indicated by his teacher Webern. They include an early Symphony for small orchestra (1933), an \"Ouvertüre\" in honour of Schoenberg's 70th birthday (1944), a Piano Concerto (1947, later revised as a Concerto for piano with chamber orchestra), a Violin Concerto (1953–55, though this remained in pencil score), \"Prelude and Variations\" dedicated to Stravinsky (1962), \"Ricercata\" for orchestra (1965), Cantatas on poems of Nietzsche (1951) and on German folksong texts (1964), string quartets, trios, works for violin and piano, solo piano pieces, several sets of songs and some arrangements of Irish folksongs. His last work was a Chamber Symphony (1977–79).\n\nAlmost all Spinner's music was written according to the twelve-tone technique (on which he also wrote a significant textbook, \"A Short Introduction to the Technique of Twelve-tone Composition\", published 1960). His early works, up to and including the \"Zwei kleine Stücke\", are clearly influenced by Berg and middle-period Schoenberg. From the mid-1930s the general idiom, expressive intensity, dramatic economy and impeccable craftsmanship bear witness to his admiration for his teacher Webern – and, through Webern, for the whole Austro-German tradition from Bach onwards. Spinner himself carried that tradition a stage further. While retaining the purity and thematically essentialized textures of Webern, his works show a concern for larger and bolder gestures than Webern's norm. In his later music, beginning with the sonatina for piano, the expressive pressure applied to strict motivic working results in a wholly individual style of almost explosive force.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2201413", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2201413", "title": "Peter Blegvad", "text": "Peter Blegvad\n\nPeter Blegvad (born August 14, 1951) is an American musician, singer-songwriter, writer, and cartoonist. He was a founding member of German/English avant-pop band Slapp Happy, which later merged briefly with Henry Cow, and has released many solo and collaborative albums. He is the son of Lenore and Erik Blegvad, who were respectively, a children's book author and illustrator.\n\nPeter Blegvad's life began in America – he was born in New York City and originally raised in Connecticut. When he was 14, the Blegvad family moved to England in 1965, unhappy with the social climate of America following the assassination of John F. Kennedy and the threat posed by the Vietnam draft to Peter and his younger brother Kristoffer. Blegvad was educated at St Christopher School, Letchworth, a boarding school where he met his musical collaborator Anthony Moore. Moore and Blegvad played in various bands during their schooldays, alongside fellow musicians such as Neil Murray (then a drummer, later a well-known hard rock bass guitarist).\n\nIn 1972, Blegvad followed the itinerant Moore to Hamburg, Germany, where the two formed the avant-pop trio Slapp Happy with Dagmar Krause, Slapp Happy recorded two albums for Polydor Germany with krautrock group Faust as their backing band. Polydor released the first, \"Sort Of\" in 1972, but rejected the second, \"Casablanca Moon\". This rejection prompted Slapp Happy to relocate to London where they signed up with Virgin Records and re-recorded \"Casablanca Moon\", released in 1974 by Virgin as \"Slapp Happy\". (The original \"Casablanca Moon\" was later released by Recommended Records as \"Acnalbasac Noom\" in 1980.) In 1974 Slapp Happy merged briefly with avant-rock group Henry Cow, recording two albums in 1975, \"Desperate Straights\" and \"In Praise of Learning\".\n\nShortly after recording \"In Praise of Learning\", first Moore and then Blegvad left Henry Cow due to incompatibilities with the other musicians in the group. Blegvad has confessed that the technical demands of Henry Cow's music were beyond him (\"It was discovered – not to my surprise – that I actually couldn't play Henry Cow music. The chords and the time signatures were too complicated. And... just generally, Anthony and I felt kinda lost...\") but it was also clear that there were crucial differences in artistic approach. Blegvad would later reveal (in an interview for the Hearsay fanzine) that \"the piece that got me kicked out was \"Living in the Heart of the Beast\". I was assigned the task for the collective to come up with suitable verbals, and I wrote two verses about a woman throwing raisins at a pile of bones. Tim Hodgkinson just said, I'm sorry, this is not at all what we want. And he wrote reams of this political tirade. I admired his passion and application but it left me cold. I am to my bones a flippant individual, I don't know why I was created thus or what I'm trying to deny, but it clashed with the extreme seriousness. People who take themselves very seriously make me giggle, unless they're pointing a weapon at me or my loved ones\". Due to Krause's decision to remain with Henry Cow, Slapp Happy dissolved and the three members went their separate ways (although the group would periodically reunite in 1982, 1991, 1997, 2000 and 2016–17).\n\nBlegvad returned to New York to work as a cartoonist, but maintained his interest in music. In 1977 he reunited with Henry Cow bass player John Greaves to collaborate on the album \"Kew. Rhone.\" – an unusual cross-genre release combining elements of minimalism, avant-garde jazz and progressive rock. The album was also notable for its personnel, which included celebrated New York jazz musicians Carla Bley, Michael Mantler, and Andrew Cyrille among the performers. As a musical document \"Kew. Rhone.\" remains both ambitious and unclassifiable; Blegvad's literate and playful lyrics are well-matched by Greaves' complex song structures. Blegvad would later continue his collaboration with Greaves in 1995 on \"Unearthed\", a collection of spoken word pieces set to Greaves' music.\n\nIn the 1980s, Blegvad released a number of commercially unsuccessful albums on the Virgin Records label, including \"The Naked Shakespeare\" and \"Knights Like This\", both of which show the influence of external producers. By contrast, \"Downtime\", an independent release in the late 1980s features mainly very simple demos, often recorded cheaply in professional studios' \"downtime\". \"King Strut and Other Stories\" (Silvertone, 1990) is a collection of short stories set to simply arranged, professionally produced music played in many cases by noted session musicians. The album features XTC's Andy Partridge while \"Orpheus – The Lowdown\" (2003) is a whole album in collaboration with Partridge. Many of Blegvad's albums feature former members of Slapp Happy and Henry Cow.\n\nBlegvad is a deft and literate lyricist whose lyrics frequently feature word games, literary references and complex and extended rhyme schemes.\n\nFrom 1992 to 1999, \"The Independent\" ran Blegvad's strangely surreal comic strip, \"Leviathan\", which received much critical praise for blending some of the most interesting elements of Krazy Kat with a coming-of-age-esque story akin to Calvin and Hobbes. Some of the strips have been collected in the 2001 volume \"The Book of Leviathan\". In 2013 the book was published as \"Le livre de Leviathan\" in French and received the \"Prix Révélation\" at the 41st Angoulême International Comics Festival in 2014. Other comics and illustrations by Blegvad have appeared in \"The Ganzfeld\" and Ben Katchor's \"Picture Story 2\".\n\nHe has also conducted two- and three-week writing courses at Warwick University, England, in association with the National Academy for Gifted and Talented Youth (NAGTY), and the new University of Warwick venture for gifted and creative children, International Gateway for Gifted Youth (IGGY).\n\nIn 2011, Atlas Publishing (trading as \"The London Institute of 'Pataphysics\") published Blegvad's \"The Bleaching Stream\", described as an \"interview format biography.\"\n\nBlegvad's work for BBC Radio 3 includes numerous \"eartoons\" for the weekly poetry strand The Verb, and a number of radiophonic dramas with Langham Research Centre and with Iain Chambers. These include \"guest+host=ghost\", featuring Nick Cave; \"Use It Or Lose It\" which won a Radio Academy Award in 2012; \"Chinoiserie\"; \"Eschatology\", starring Harriet Walter and Guy Paul; and \"The Impossible Book\" (2016).\n\nHis 2015 drama with Iain Chambers for Radio Australia, \"The Eternal Moment\" starring John Ramm and Emma Powell, was shortlisted for the 2015 Prix Europa.\n\nKrause, Moore and Blegvad reformed Slapp Happy in November 2016 to perform with Faust at the Week-End festival in Cologne, Germany. The two groups also played together on February 10–11, 2017 at Cafe Oto in London. On February 24, 2017 Slapp Happy, without Faust, performed at Mt. Rainer Hall, Shibuya in Tokyo.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2201417", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2201417", "title": "Bulk density", "text": "Bulk density\n\nBulk density, also called apparent density or volumetric density, is a property of powders, granules, and other \"divided\" solids, especially used in reference to mineral components (soil, gravel), chemical substances, (pharmaceutical) ingredients, foodstuff, or any other masses of corpuscular or particulate matter. \n\nIt is defined as the mass of many particles of the material divided by the total volume they occupy. \n\nThe total volume includes particle volume, inter-particle void volume, and internal pore volume.\n\nBulk density is not an intrinsic property of a material; it can change depending on how the material is handled. For example, a powder poured into a cylinder will have a particular bulk density; if the cylinder is disturbed, the powder particles will move and usually settle closer together, resulting in a higher bulk density. \n\nFor this reason, the bulk density of powders is usually reported both as \"freely settled\" (or \"poured\" density) and \"tapped\" density (where the tapped density refers to the bulk density of the powder after a specified compaction process, usually involving vibration of the container.)\n\nThe bulk density of soil depends greatly on the mineral make up of soil and the degree of compaction. The density of quartz is around 2.65 g/cm³ but the (dry) bulk density of a mineral soil is normally about half that density, between 1.0 and 1.6 g/cm³. In contrast, soils rich in soil organic carbon and some friable clays tend to have lower bulk densities (<1.0 g/cm³) due to a combination of the low-density of the organic materials themselves and increased porosity. For instance, peat soils have bulk densities from 0.02 g/cm³ to 0.98  g/cm³.\n\nBulk density of soil is usually determined from a core sample which is taken by driving a metal corer into the soil at the desired depth and horizon. This gives a soil sample of known total volume, formula_1. From this sample the wet bulk density and the dry bulk density can be determined.\n\nFor the wet bulk density (total bulk density) this sample is weighed, giving the mass formula_2. For the dry bulk density, the sample is oven dried and weighed, giving the mass of soil solids, formula_3. The relationship between these two masses is formula_4, where formula_5 is the mass of substances lost on oven drying (often, mostly water). The dry and wet bulk densities are calculated as\n\nDry bulk density = mass of soil/ volume as a whole\n\nWet bulk density = mass of soil plus liquids/ volume as a whole\n\nThe dry bulk density of a soil is inversely related to the porosity of the same soil: the more pore space in a soil the lower the value for bulk density. Bulk density of a region in the interior of the earth is also related to the seismic velocity of waves travelling through it: for P-waves, this has been quantified with Gardner's relation. The higher the density, the faster the velocity.\n\n\n"}

From the 1960s on, he has been a presence on radio stations in the New York radio market, until he was fired in December 2017. Additionally, Schwartz sometimes performs as a singer and has recorded numerous selections from the collection of popular music from the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s known as the Great American Songbook. Schwartz has also written novels, short stories, and a memoir, \"All In Good Time\" (2004).\n\nSchwartz was born in New York City, the son of composer Arthur Schwartz (1900–1984) and 1930s Broadway ingénue Kay Carrington. Though his memoirs describe an unhappy childhood, Schwartz grew up animated by a passionate interest in musical arts. His father was a composer of Broadway and film scores (\"Dancing in the Dark\" and \"That's Entertainment!\" are among his works), and from an early age Schwartz developed his interest through this family perspective. Jonathan's half-brother Paul Schwartz (born 1956) is a composer, conductor, pianist, and producer.\n\nSchwartz worked at New York's WNEW-FM from 1967 to 1976, followed by stints at WNEW, WQEW and, between 1999 and 2017, WNYC-FM. Schwartz also served as programming director for XM Satellite Radio Frank’s Place, named in honor of Frank Sinatra. Following XM’s merger with Sirius, the name was changed to High Standards channel from 2001 to 2008, and appeared on Sirius XM's Siriusly Sinatra and '40s on 4 channels from 2008 to 2013.\n\nSchwartz is best known for \"The Jonathan Schwartz Show\", which aired Saturday evenings and Sunday afternoons on WNYC-FM, and was about half talk and half an eclectic mix of music.\n\nIn his talk during the shows, Schwartz would hold extended monologues concerning famous pop songwriters and singers, and jazz artists. His music selections incorporated pop jazz, pop standards, big band and Broadway show tunes, augmented by music of nearly any popular style that has influenced twentieth century American tastes. His playlists reflected the \"Great American Songbook\" or, as Schwartz described it, \"America's classical music\". Traditionally, Schwartz opened each broadcast with the same secret snippet of music which he had always refused to identify until 2014, at a show at the Brooklyn Academy of Music: slightly more than a minute of \"a lilting woman's voice, wordless and yet evocative, over an acoustic guitar.\" The voice is that of Schwartz's friend since childhood, Carly Simon; listeners had speculated that the music may have been composed by his father, but it was a joint work of his and Carly Simon's. Similarly, he closed most shows with a song from the late cabaret singer Nancy LaMott, followed by a segment from another instrumental recording by Schwartz's idol, the late Nelson Riddle, and his orchestra.\n\nSchwartz is known for his lengthy and detailed on-air stories about his interactions with famous people, most often Frank Sinatra. He also claims an encyclopedic knowledge of Sinatra, who Schwartz reported was amazed by Schwartz's knowledge of every song he had ever recorded. He champions young artists who carry on the traditions of the American Songbook, as well as reveling rapturously in the songwriters and performers of the Sinatra era. In 1986 Schwartz won a Grammy Award for Best Album Notes for \"The Voice - The Columbia Years 1943-1952\".\n\nIn 2013 WNYC launched The Jonathan Channel, a 24/7 streaming Internet radio station programmed by Schwartz and dedicated to American songs selected by him. The channel also featured live programming hosted by Schwartz, along with simulcasts and replays of his Saturday and Sunday WNYC shows.\n\nOn December 6, 2017, WNYC announced that Schwartz and longtime WNYC host Leonard Lopate were being put on leave \"pending investigations into allegations of inappropriate conduct.\" On December 21, 2017, WNYC fired both Schwartz and Lopate, stating that \"investigations found that each individual had violated [WNYC's] standards for providing an inclusive, appropriate, and respectful work environment\". The Jonathan Channel stream was concurrently renamed American Standards, and as of 2020 is known as New Standards.\n\nOn June 17, 2018, Schwartz began broadcasting on an internet radio station, The Jonathan Station, that was created for him a few months before by Bob Perry of Big Sticks Broadcasting. It is a live streaming station that presents the American Songbook twenty four hours a day with live programs with Jonathan Schwartz on Saturdays and Sundays. The long tradition of presenting a Christmas Show, something that Schwartz started in 1971 while at WNEW, continues at the new station.\n\nIn addition to his radio work, Schwartz has performed in New York City cabaret, recorded three albums as a singer, and authored five books:\n\n\nHe does most of his writing in Palm Springs, California.\n\nSchwartz was briefly married to the author Sara Davidson in the late 1960s. He married the journalist and \"Vanity Fair\" correspondent Marie Brenner in 1979, with whom he has one daughter. Schwartz later married Elinor Renfield, with whom he has a son.\n\nIn March 2010, Schwartz married actress Zohra Lampert in New York City. At the wedding, his long-time friend Tony Bennett sang \"I See Your Face Before Me\", a 1937 composition by Schwartz's father and Howard Dietz.\n\n"}

The cells and the tumor that they compose are often benign but sometimes may be premalignant or malignant.\n\nAn oncocytoma is an epithelial tumor composed of oncocytes, large eosinophilic cells having small, round, benign-appearing nuclei with large nucleoli.\n\nOncocytoma can arise in a number of organs.\n\nRenal oncocytoma is thought to arise from the intercalated cells of collecting ducts of the kidney. It represents 5% to 15% of surgically resected renal neoplasms.\n\nThe salivary gland oncocytoma is a well-circumscribed, benign neoplastic growth also called an oxyphilic adenoma. It comprises about 1% of all salivary gland tumors. The histopathology is marked by sheets of large swollen polyhedral epithelial oncocytes, which are granular acidophilic parotid cells with centrally located nuclei. The granules are created by the mitochondria.\n\nSalivary gland oncocytomas are most common in ages 70–80, females, the parotid gland (85–90%), and are firm, slowly growing, painless masses of less than 4 cm. They may be bilateral.\n\nThyroid oncocytomas can be benign (adenomas) or malignant (carcinomas). Grossly, oncocytic adenomas are encapsulated, solid nodules with a characteristic brown cut surface. The gross appearance of a minimally invasive oncocytic carcinoma is indistinguishable to that of an adenoma, while widely invasive oncocytic carcinomas are obviously invasive macroscopically and display pervasive vascular invasion with multifocal involvement of the thyroid gland. There are no reliable cytologic features which distinguish oncocytic adenomas from carcinomas and the only criterion for a diagnosis of malignancy is the identification of transcapsular or vascular invasion.\n\nPatients with thyroid oncocytomas present with a thyroid nodule, usually with normal thyroid function. If the tumor is big or invasive, there may be other symptoms such as difficulty swallowing or talking.\n"}
{"id": "2201432", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2201432", "title": "Kid Colt", "text": "Kid Colt\n\nKid Colt is the name of two fictional characters appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The first is a cowboy whose adventures have taken place in numerous western-themed comic book series published by Marvel. The second is a cowboy-themed horse-like superhero.\n\nKid Colt starred in the comic book series \"Kid Colt Outlaw\", as well as in several other titles. He is the longest-running cowboy star in American comic-book publishing, featured in stories for a 31-year stretch from 1948–1979, though from 1966 most of the published stories were reprints.\n\nKid Colt appeared in numerous series through that decade, including \"All Western Winners\", \"Wild Western\", \"Two-Gun Western\", and \"Gunsmoke Western\". Each issue of \"The Mighty Marvel Western\" featured three Old West heroes: the Rawhide Kid and the Two-Gun Kid in all issues, and Kid Colt in all issues except #25-42 (July 1973 - Oct. 1975), in which Matt Slade, from the 1956 series \"Matt Slade, Gunfighter\", published by Marvel forerunner Atlas Comics, was substituted. Virtually all Kid Colt stories were drawn by the character's longtime artist, Jack Keller. He additionally headlined the three-issue \"Giant-Size Kid Colt\" (January 1975 - July 1975) reprint series. His signature series ended with #229 (April 1979), making it the longest-running Western comic book. \n\nThe character has appeared sporadically in Marvel universe superhero titles, usually in stories involving time travel between the current era and Western times. These have included \"The Avengers\" #141-43 (1975), \"The Fantastic Four\" vol. 3, #33-34 (2000) and \"The Black Panther\" vol. 3, #46-47 (2002).\n\nIt was not until 2000, with the miniseries \"Blaze of Glory\", by writer John Ostrander and artist Leonardo Manco, that a Western series again featured Kid Colt. The gritty miniseries — which featured different-looking versions of Marvel Western characters and retconned that the naively clean-cut Marvel Western stories of years past were merely dime novel fictions of their actual lives — killed off Kid Colt in the series' conclusion (#4, March 2000). An older version of Kid Colt appears in 'Skaar: King Of The Savage Land\", having faked his death and subsequently time-traveling.\n\nMarvel reintroduced Kid Colt as teenager in a 2009 \"One-Shot\" comic (\"Kill the Kid\") written by Tom Defalco and illustrated by Rick Burchett (originally published in digital format). The book, narrated by a self-proclaimed drifter named Everett Hawkmore who partners with the Kid, retells a somewhat modified origin story.\n\nThe character also appears in 2010's \"Rawhide Kid: The Sensational Seven\".\n\nKid Colt (real name: Blaine Colt, but see below) is an American Old West cowboy who was wrongly accused of murder (he killed his father's murderer in a fair gun battle) and became a fugitive from the law, along the way engaging in heroic good acts in an effort to restore his reputation.\n\nKid Colt was later killed.\n\nKid Colt was later reintroduced as a teenager whose real name was changed to Blaine Cole. A brother of Cole was missing after the raid that killed his parents and a search for a witness to the gunfight that had erroneously branded him an outlaw.\n\nAn older version of Kid Colt later appears, having faked his death and subsequently time-traveling.\n\nDuring a period where time itself was becoming unraveled, Kid Colt teamed up with the Hulk, Rawhide Kid and Two-Gun Kid to stop a murderous sheriff with time-traveling powers.\n\nKid Colt (real name: Elric Freedom Whitemane) is a contemporary superhero character in the Marvel Comics universe who has appeared as a member of the modern-day Young Allies. Created by Fabian Nicieza and Mark Bagley, he debuted in \"Heroes Reborn: Young Allies\" #1 (Jan. 2000).\n\nBorn to hippies, Elric was a normal child, until government agents paid his parents to let them give him special \"tests\" (which were attempts to fuse his DNA with the DNA of the equine aliens known as the Kymellians). The tests were successful, and young Elric changed into a strange, bipedal horse-like creature. Hearing stories of the wild west, Elric assumed the identity of Kid Colt, and began to use his newfound powers to help those in need. He was eventually recruited by the Young Allies to help them free two alien beings. Elric decided to remain with the team.\n\nElric is a hybrid of human and Kymellian. Due to his alien DNA, he can shapeshift into a humanoid horse, and teleport short distances. He can store items in sub-space \"closets\", pockets of extra-dimensional space which can hold items as large as a human being until Elric needs them. By creating multiple pockets which are linked together, Elric can run through them, and seem to rapidly blink in-and-out of existence. When he is not in his horse form, Elric wears a cowboy-themed costume in homage to the original Kid Colt. Due to his horse-like digestive system, Elric is a vegetarian.\n\n\n\n \n"}

She was outfitted with heavy guns and assigned to the Union blockade of the waterways of the Confederate States of America. She was the first U.S. Navy ship to be named \"Kansas\" and was the first of a class of 836-ton screw steam gunboats. At war's end, she continued serving her country by performing survey work and defending American interests in Cuba until sold in 1883.\n\n\"Kansas\" was built at Philadelphia Navy Yard with machinery taken from the cargo of prize steamer \"Princess Royal\". She was launched 29 September 1863; sponsored by Miss Annie McClellan; and commissioned at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 21 December 1863, Lieutenant Commander Pendleton G. Watmough in command.\n\nOn the day of her commissioning, the gunboat was ordered to Hampton Roads, Virginia to join the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron. She arrived Newport News, Virginia, 30 December; but engine and boiler trouble required her to return to the Washington Navy Yard for repairs.\n\nIn March 1864 the gunboat was stationed at Wilmington, North Carolina, off New Inlet, where she served during most of the remainder of the war. With \"Mount Vernon\", \"Howquah\", and \"Nansemond\", she engaged Confederate ironclad-ram \"Raleigh\", (Flag Officer William Lynch) which had steamed over the bar at New Inlet 6 May to attack the Northern blockaders.\n\nThe withering fire from the Union ships caused \"Raleigh\" to withdraw toward safety within the harbor, but she grounded and broke her back while attempting to cross the bar at the mouth of the Cape Fear River. After strenuous efforts to save the stricken vessel proved fruitless, she was destroyed to prevent her falling into Union hands.\n\nShortly before dawn 15 May, \"Kansas\" ended a two-hour chase by capturing British steamer \"Tristram Shandy\" as the blockade runner attempted to escape to sea with a cargo of cotton, tobacco, and turpentine. The next day the proud gunboat towed her prize into Beaufort, North Carolina. On her return passage she brought Colonel James Jourdan to reconnoiter Confederate defenses at Fort Fisher in preparation for future attacks.\n\nThroughout the night of 27–28 May, \"Kansas\" chased a blockade-running steamer which finally escaped. That morning boiler trouble prevented her getting underway to chase another steamer which dashed out from Wilmington, North Carolina. After remaining on blockade duty at New Inlet until August, the gunboat returned to Philadelphia for repairs.\n\n\"Kansas\" rejoined her squadron late in September; and, after briefly cruising at sea, she returned to her old station off New Inlet in mid-October. There she chased and headed off steamer \"Annie\" trying to slip out of New Inlet with a cargo of cotton. This action 31 October enabled \"Wilderness\" and \"Niphon\" to capture the chase a short time later. On 7 December, while Admiral David Dixon Porter and General Benjamin F. Butler planned joint operations against Wilmington to close that vital Confederate port once and for all, \"Kansas\" was one of the Union gunboats which were making blockade-running in that quarter hazardous. That day they forced steamer \"Stormy Petrel\" ashore where she was abandoned by her crew and, a few days later, destroyed by a gale.\n\nAt daylight Christmas Eve, \"Kansas\" was part of the huge fleet which formed in line of battle before Fort Fisher and pounded the formidable Confederate works with a furious bombardment. Although the cannonade drove the staunch Southern defenders from their guns to shelter in bombproofs, transports carrying the Union soldiers did not arrive from Beaufort until too late to launch the assault that day.\n\nThe next morning, the ships again opened fire on the forts and maintained the bombardment while troops landed near Flag Pond Battery, north of the main defensive works. Some 2,000 men established a beachhead under the protection of naval gunfire which kept the Confederate garrison pinned down and away from their guns.\n\nLate that afternoon, supported by heavy fire from the Union ships, Union Army skirmishers advanced to within yards of the fort. Lt. Aeneas Armstrong of the Confederate Navy later described the effectiveness of the bombardment:\n\nThe whole of the interior of the fort, which consists of sand, merlons, etc., was as one 11 inch shell bursting. You can not inspect the works and walk on nothing but iron.\n\nHowever, General Butler, considering the works too strong to be carried by assault with the troops available, aborted the operation by ordering his troops to re-embark.\n\nUndaunted by this setback, the Navy was not to be denied. At Porter's request Grant sent him a new commander. \"Kansas\" was one of some five dozen ships which Porter sent against Fort Fisher 13 January 1865. A naval landing party of 2.000 sailors and marines reinforced 8.000 soldiers under Major General Alfred H. Terry. The ensuing onslaught was a classic example of complete Army-Navy coordination. \"New Ironsides\" led three monitors to within 1,000 yards of Fort Fisher and opened on its batteries. Meanwhile, \"Kansas\" and the other wooden warships formed in line of battle in close order and shelled Flag Pond Battery and the adjacent woods at 0715. Half an hour later they sent in boats to assist in disembarking the landing party which went ashore out of range of the fort's guns.\n\nOnce the beachhead had been established, \"Kansas\" stood toward Fort Fisher to join in the bombardment of the main Confederate works. She continued the bombardment intermittently for the next 2 days. Shortly before noon 15 January, her launch went ashore with 20 men to join the naval brigade for the final push. The gunboat maintained heavy fire during the following hours while soldiers, sailors, and marines braved the deadly fire of the stouthearted Southern defenders. Finally, at 2200, loud cheering and illumination of the fleet announced the fall of the forts.\n\nAfter cleanup operations in the Wilmington area, \"Kansas\" moved to the James River late in February to support General Grant's final drive to Richmond, Virginia. From time to time during the closing weeks of the war, \"Kansas\" supported Union Army operations ashore with her guns, particularly near Petersburg, Virginia. The day after General Robert E. Lee surrendered at Appomattox Court House, the gunboat was ordered to a station off Cape Henry to prevent the escape of Confederate sympathizers who were reportedly planning to capture vessels in the bay.\n\n\"Kansas\" entered the Philadelphia Navy Yard 23 April and decommissioned 4 May. She recommissioned 28 July, Lt. Cmdr. Clark H. Wells in command, and departed Philadelphia 5 August to begin a 4-year voyage in the South Atlantic Ocean which took her to Cape Town, Africa, as well as to many ports in the Caribbean and South America. This long and interesting deployment ended 15 September 1869, when the gunboat arrived Washington Navy Yard, where she decommissioned a week later.\n\nAfter a year in ordinary at Washington, D.C., she recommissioned 26 September 1870, Lt. Cmdr. Norman H. Farquhar in command. She stood down the Potomac River 10 October and arrived Hampton Roads 3 days later to join \"Mayflower\" for the Tehuantepec surveying-expedition sent to southern Mexico to determine the feasibility of constructing an inter-oceanic canal across the Isthmus of Tehuantepec which separates the Gulf of Mexico from the Pacific Ocean.\n\nThe ships sailed via Key West for Vera Cruz 14 October. The expedition carefully surveyed the narrow neck of land and recorded invaluable scientific information making \"many calculations to prove that a ship-canal across the Isthmus of Tehuantepec is not only practicable, but that the obstacles in the way of the canal route are of the most ordinary nature.\"\n\nWhen she returned to Washington 15 June 1871, her crew was seriously debilitated by fever contracted in the tropics. As a result, she was ordered to the North Atlantic to join a special squadron under Vice Admiral Stephen Rowen at Portsmouth, New Hampshire. She stood in to Staten Island 10 October to participate in the reception given the Russian Fleet. She departed New York Harbor 29 November for Cuba and arrived Havana, Cuba, in December. The gunboat left that port 25 February 1872 to obtain supplies and await Comdr. A. F. Grossman who headed another Nicaragua-surveying expedition. Comdr. A. F. Grossman (ref. states 'Crosman') and others were drowned near Greytown, Nicaragua, 12 April 1872, and by personal exertion, seaman Austin Denham, chief quarter gunner George Hill, seaman John Johnson, boatswain's mate John O'Neal, seaman Richard Pile, and seaman James Smith prevented greater loss of life, for which they each earned the Medal of Honor. \"Kansas\" was employed gathering data on potential inter-oceanic canal routes until returning to Key West, Florida, on 13 July.\n\n\"Kansas\" departed Key West 6 August to determine positions for a submarine cable between Key West and Havana and returned a week later. She departed Key West 21 August and arrived Halifax, Nova Scotia, 5 September. She stood out of Halifax 17 September and arrived New York City 21 November after visiting Salem, Massachusetts, and Newport, Rhode Island, en route. She got underway for another surveying expedition of Central America 1 January 1873, which ended when she returned to Key West 15 July.\n\nIn November Spanish authorities in Cuba seized arms-running ship Virginius, illegally flying the American flag on the high seas, and summarily shot 53 of her passengers and crew. On hearing of this incident, \"Wyoming\" sailed without orders to Santiago, Cuba, and entered a vigorous protest. \"Kansas\" stood out of New York on 14 November to assist \"Wyoming\" in representing the nation's interests.\n\nAfter battling severe weather, she arrived Santiago, Cuba, 2 December. As a host of other warships from the U.S. Navy's North Atlantic, South Atlantic, and European squadrons converged on Cuba, the 102 survivors of \"Virginius\" were taken to New York.\n\n\"Kansas\" returned to Key West Christmas Day. In February 1874 she participated in a naval drill in Florida Bay.

The Pathfinder Platoon acts as the brigade's advance force and reconnaissance force. Its role includes locating and marking drop zones and helicopter landing zones for air landing operations. Once the main force has landed, the platoon provides tactical intelligence and offensive action roles for the brigade.\nDuring the Second World War small groups of parachute soldiers were formed into pathfinder units, to parachute ahead of the main force. Their tasks were to mark the drop zones (DZ) or landing zones (LZ), set up radio beacons as a guide for the aircraft carrying the main force and to clear and protect the area as the main force arrive.\n\nThe units were formed into two companies to work with the two airborne divisions. The 21st Independent Parachute Company served with the 1st Airborne Division and the 22nd Independent Parachute Company served with the 6th Airborne Division. The 22nd Independent Parachute Company were amongst the lead elements of the 6th Airborne division's drop into Normandy as part of Operation Tonga. While the 21st Independent Parachute Company took part in Operation Market Garden landing at Arnhem on the night 17 September 1944. After marking the DZs and LSs The Company was trapped with the rest of the division in the Oosterbeek Perimeter.\n\nAfter the war both companies were disbanded and in 1948, the army's parachute force was reduced to the 16 Parachute Brigade. Part of this reduction saw the formation of the No. 1 Guards Independent Parachute Company which became the pathfinder unit for the newly formed brigade. The Company deployed on a wide variety of operations between 1948 and 1977. It was deployed to Borneo during the Borneo Confrontation where it was trained as a special reconnaissance unit.\n\nFollowing the 1982 Falklands War, 5 Airborne Brigade was established as a light, rapid reaction force for similar requirements. The brigade was formed from the two Parachute Regiment and one line infantry battalions and support units. The Brigade identified a requirement for an independent intelligence collection capability, deployable into a hostile or non-permissive environment ahead of the main force so in 1985 the Pathfinder Platoon was established with personnel drawn initially from the patrols platoon of each of the three Parachute Battalions. For many years it was not an officially established unit, being financed from other parts of the Brigade's budget. In 1999, 5 Airborne Brigade merged with 24 Airmobile Brigade to form the present day 16 Air Assault Brigade with the platoon remaining attached to the Brigade headquarters.\n\nThe platoon work under the command of the Brigade Headquarters in Colchester, Essex. The Officer Commanding Pathfinder Platoon is a senior Captain or Major with an Operations Warrant Officer (OPSWO) as his second in command. The platoon operates in teams of between 4–6 men. In 2006 a new rate of Parachute Pay (High Altitude Parachute Pay) was introduced for members of the Pathfinder Platoon following the recommendations of the Armed Forces’ Pay Review Body.\n\nMembers of the platoon come from across the armed forces. The majority is made up of infantry soldiers and combat engineers the platoon has attached soldiers from the REME, Royal Signals and the RAMC.\n\nSelection lasts for 6 weeks, the Pathfinder Platoon Selection Course, also known as 'The Cadre' covers almost all UKSF Selection Course training grounds although it is much shorter. The Cadre consist of:\n\nPhase 1 – Aptitude Phase (1 week)\n\nCandidates need to complete:\n\n\nCandidates are taught basic navigation and signal skills in between the physical exercises.\n\nPhase 2 – Navigation Phase (1 week)\n\nAlso known as Hills Phase, candidates need to complete:\n\n\nPhase 3 – Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Phase (1 week)\n\nCandidates will be trained with:\n\n\nPhase 4 – Range Phase (1 week)\n\nAlso known as Live firing Phase, this phase takes place on Sennybridge Training Area (SENTA). The candidate will be trained with:\n\n\nAt the end of Phase 4, candidates will participate in a platoon-sized live assault.\n\nPhase 5 – Final Exercise (2 weeks)\n\nCandidates will be teaming up with a 4-6 men team and tasked with planning and execute a typical reconnaissance mission. Candidates will be captured and need to go through series of mock interrogations by the instructors. Candidates are tested physically and mentally.\n\nThe present day Pathfinder Platoon has taken part in operations in Yugoslavia, Sierra Leone, Macedonia, Afghanistan and Iraq.\n\nIn June 1999, they were part of Operation Agricola in Kosovo. The platoon provided reconnaissance and the forward air control of air assets, behind enemy lines, for NATO command several days prior to the main land offensive. Once NATO forces had entered Kosovo, the platoon were re-tasked to provided a defensive screen around Pristina International Airport prior to the arrival of the Russian forces.\n\nTheir next operation was Operation Palliser in Sierra Leone. The platoon deployed into Freetown on May 7, 2000 to assist the UNAMSIL efforts. Deployed around Lungi under the command of Sergeant Stephen Heaney, they were engaged by a Revolutionary United Front (RUF) force trying to capture the airport. The platoon, outnumbered 20 to one, fought throughout the night and repulsed the RUF, which suffered 20 dead without any loss to the platoon. For his actions during the engagement Heaney was awarded the Military Cross.\n\nIn 2001 the Pathfinder Platoon deployed for Operation Essential Harvest in the Republic of Macedonia supporting the Special Air Service in mapping the National Liberation Army (NLA) positions.\n\nThe Platoon was deployed to the southern Afghan province of Helmand alongside the 3 Para Battle Group in 2006. The Pathfinders spent 52 days in the town of Musa Qal'eh and were engaged in fighting the Taliban for 26 of the 52 days.\n\nBy May 19, the Pathfinders joined the Afghan National Police (ANP) in a counterattack in Taliban held territory. From there, a US B-1 Lancer bomber and A-10's were directed by PF Forward Air Controllers (FACs) onto Taliban positions. They were then supplemented by French Super Etendards from the Charles de Gaulle aircraft carrier in the Indian Ocean. The men then set out on a four-day mission to a town in the north of Helmand province in Afghanistan ended up spending 52 days under siege by the Taliban. 25 men, who have been first into several Taliban-held areas during the British deployment in southern Afghanistan, came under such ferocious attack that they were forced to stay in Musa Qala fighting almost daily battles. The group was supposed to be reinforced by a company of 120 paratroopers but they had to be diverted to the town of Sangin when they came under heavy assault by Taliban insurgents. The platoon were finally replaced in Musa Qala when 500 British troops, in a mission codenamed Operation Snakebite broke through Taliban lines.\n\nIn 2010 the Pathfinders deployed again to Helmand Afghanistan as the Brigade Reconnaissance Force operating throughout Helmand Province conducting reconnaissance tasks and offensive action tasks. During the course of this tour an attached soldier Pte John \"Jack\" Howard (3 Para) was killed in action during a strafing run from an American Close Air Support mission.\nBooks\n\nTelevision\n\n"}
{"id": "2201447", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2201447", "title": "Angle of arrival", "text": "Angle of arrival\n\nThe angle of arrival (AoA) of a signal is the direction from which the signal (e.g. radio, optical or acoustic) is received.\n\nMeasurement of AoA can be done by determining the direction of propagation of a radio-frequency wave incident on an antenna array or determined from maximum signal strength during antenna rotation.\n\nThe AoA can be calculated by measuring the time difference of arrival (TDOA) between individual elements of the array. \n\nGenerally this TDOA measurement is made by measuring the difference in received phase at each element in the antenna array. This can be thought of as beamforming in reverse. In beamforming, the signal from each element is weighed to \"steer\" the gain of the antenna array. In AoA, the delay of arrival at each element is measured directly and converted to an AoA measurement.\n\nConsider, for example, a two element array spaced apart by one-half the wavelength of an incoming RF wave. If a wave is incident upon the array at boresight, it will arrive at each antenna simultaneously. This will yield 0° phase-difference measured between the two antenna elements, equivalent to a 0° AoA. If a wave is incident upon the array at broadside, then a 180° phase difference will be measured between the elements, corresponding to a 90° AoA.\n\nIn optics, AoA can be calculated using interferometry.\n\nAn application of AoA is in the geolocation of cell phones. The aim is either for the cell system to report the location of a cell phone placing an emergency call or to provide a service to tell the user of the cell phone where they are. Multiple receivers on a base station would calculate the AoA of the cell phone's signal, and this information would be combined to determine the phone's location. \n\nAoA is generally used to discover the location of pirate radio stations or of any military radio transmitter.\n\nIn submarine acoustics, AoA is used to localize objects with active or passive ranging.\n\n"}
{"id": "2201453", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2201453", "title": "Genitive absolute", "text": "Genitive absolute\n\nIn Ancient Greek grammar, the genitive absolute (Latin: genitivus absolutus) is a grammatical construction consisting of a participle and often a noun both in the genitive case, which is very similar to the ablative absolute in Latin. A genitive absolute construction serves as a dependent clause, usually at the beginning of a sentence, in which the genitive noun is the subject of the dependent clause and the participle takes on the role of predicate.\n\nThe term \"absolute\" comes from the Latin \"absolutus\", literally meaning \"made loose\". That comes from the general truth that the genitive absolute usually does not refer to anything in the independent clause; however, there are many exceptions, notably in the New Testament and in Koine.\n\nAll four participle tenses are used in forming a genitive absolute. The different tenses indicate different relations in time between the independent and the dependent clause. \"Present participles\" are used when the action in the dependent clause happens simultaneously with that of the independent clause, and are therefore translated as such. Such a translated genitive absolute begins with, for example, \"while\" or \"as\", or a phrase with \"with\" or \"without\" can be used.\n\n\"Aorist participles\" are used when the dependent clause takes place before the independent clause. Consequently instead of \"while\" and \"as\", \"after\" and \"when\" are the conjunctions usually used in translations, or an English perfect participle (\"having...\") is used rather than a present one. \"Future participles\", which are less common than their present and aorist counterparts, give information about what \"will\" or \"might\" be.\n\nA \"perfect participle\" describes the circumstances obtaining at the time of the main verb as a result of an earlier event.\n\nApart from translations with these conjunctions, others are also frequently used while translating a genitive absolute, such as \"because\", \"however\", or \"although\".\n\nAbsolute constructions occur with other grammatical cases in Indo-European languages, such as accusative absolute, ablative absolute in Latin, dative absolute in Gothic and Old Church Slavonic, and locative absolute in Vedic Sanskrit. Compare also nominative absolute in English. An actual genitive absolute exists in German, such as \"klopfenden Herzens\" \"(with) his/her heart beating\", although its use is much less prominent compared to Greek (or to Latin's ablative or English's nominative in such constructions).\n\nBelow are two examples of the genitive absolute, in different tenses.\nThis first example shows how a genitive absolute with a present participle is used with simultaneous actions. The independent clause is \"\" (\"...the women are at home by themselves\"). The dependent clause and genitive absolute in this example is \"\" (\"While the men are waging war\"). It explains to the reader why the women are home alone and yet is additional and not required information. Note the usage of the conjunction \"while\", indicating the two facts occurring at the same time.\n\nWhen translating into English, failure to render the Greek participle into a finite clause often yields a stilted or even ungrammatical result: \"The men waging war, the women are at home...\" is hardly acceptable.\nThis example shows a genitive absolute with an aorist participle. The independent clause in this sentence, \"\", explains what happens (\"...the slaves began to work.\"). The genitive absolute, being \"\", provides the reader with additional information (\"After the/their master had ordered (it)...\"). Here, note the conjunction \"after\", which indicates the two facts do \"not\" happen simultaneously, as they do with the present genitive absolute.\n\nIn this case, a more direct rendition, with 'having' as an overt indicator of temporal sequence, is possible if somewhat stilted: \"The master having ordered it, the slaves began to work.\"\n\nThe perfect participle describes a situation which was already in existence at the time of the action of the main verb, for example:\nThe future is less often used in a genitive absolute. It is generally found after the particle () \"in view of the fact that\" or \"on the grounds that\", for example:\n"}

The original story and screenplay was conceived and written by John Burke. Reeves and his childhood friend Tom Baker re-wrote sections of the screenplay, including the ending at Karloff's insistence, wanting his character to appear more sympathetic. Burke was removed from the main screenwriting credit and was relegated to an 'idea by'.\n\nDr. Marcus Monserrat (Boris Karloff) is an elderly practitioner of medical hypnosis. He lives with his wife Estelle Monserrat (Catherine Lacey). He has invented a device which would allow him to control and feel another person's experience using the power of hypnosis. They decide any youngster will do as their test subject. Dr. Marcus Monserrat selects and invites Mike Roscoe (Ian Ogilvy) to his house, with an offer of a 'new experience'. He uses the device on Mike and the procedure is successful: He and Estelle can feel everything Mike feels, and can also control him.\n\nAfter the procedure, they decide to send Mike away to conduct the experiment over distance. Mike returns to the club where his girlfriend Nicole (Elizabeth Ercy) is waiting for him. Mike takes Nicole to his apartment, and they swim in the pool. Marcus and Estelle are able to experience everything Mike feels. While Marcus wants to publish his work, Estelle wants to make up for lost time and to experience new things. She convinces a reluctant Marcus to continue with their arrangement with Mike.\n\nNext day, Estelle sees a fur jacket in a store and convinces Marcus to use Mike to steal the jacket. Marcus reluctantly agrees on the condition that they will not do it again. While Mike is at Nicole's apartment, Estelle and Marcus make Mike steal the jacket. Mike leaves without informing Nicole, who decides to go a night club with Alan (Victor Henry). Despite a cop getting involved, Mike successfully steals the jacket.\n\nEstelle realizes that they could do anything they want without any consequences. Estelle wants to experience the thrill of speed. So Estelle and Marcus make Mike borrow Alan's bike and ride very fast with Nicole on the pillion seat. When Alan confronts Mike, Estelle makes Mike assault him and his boss, Ron (Alf Joint). Estelle enjoys the experience but Marcus is shocked. He tries to prevent the fight but Estelle's mind turns out to be stronger. When Marcus confronts Estelle, Estelle assaults Marcus and destroys the experimental device, thereby preventing Marcus from reversing the experiment.\n\nMike blanks out every time Estelle and Marcus control him. A confused Mike visits his friend Audrey (Susan George), but Estelle makes Mike kill her. Mike then goes to the night club and hooks up with pop singer Laura (Sally Sheridan). Alan and Nicole see Mike taking Laura out of the night club. The couple are dropped by a taxi in a deserted street where Mike orders Laura to sing. When she fails to follow his instructions, he kills her too.\n\nThe following day, Alan tells Nicole he believes Mike might have killed the girls. Alan wants to inform the police but Nicole convinces him to talk to Mike first. The police track Mike with help of the taxi driver. Alan and Nicole confront Mike about Laura but Mike does not remember anything. Under the influence of Estelle, Mike attacks Alan again and escapes in a car. Police investigators track down Mike, and in the ensuing chase, Marcus interferes with Estelle's control. Mike's car crashes and catches fire. Back at the apartment, Estelle and Marcus are both dead due to burn injuries.\n\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 100% based on , with a weighted average rating of 7.3/10. At Internet Movie Database, the film received an average score of 6.4 out of 10.\n\nFor her performance, Catherine Lacey won a 'Silver Asteroid' award as Best Actress at the Trieste Science Fiction Film Festival in 1968.\n\nAfter John Burke’s death in 2011, his estate sent two boxes of effects to John’s friend, editor Johnny Mains. Looking through the material he discovered that it contained the original screenplay which was markedly different from the finished film. Burke had already told Mains about Michael Reeves denying him a screenwriting credit, but included in the boxes were several lawyers letters pertaining to the fact that this was the case. Mains then approached PS Publishing who agreed to publish the original screenplay, treatment, letters and other ephemera. The finished book, with an introduction by Matthew Sweet and additional material from Kim Newman, Benjamin Halligan and Tony Earnshaw, was published in October 2013.\n\n"}

United States was a 2003 decision in the United States Court of International Trade that determined that for purposes of tariffs, Toy Biz's action figures were toys, not dolls, because they represented \"nonhuman creatures\". This decision effectively halved the tariff rate, from 12 percent tax to 6.8 percent.\n\nThe Harmonized Tariff Schedule in U.S. law distinguished between two types of action figures for determining tariffs: dolls, which are defined to include human figures, and toys, which include \"nonhuman creatures\". Because duties on dolls were higher than those on toys, Marvel Comics subsidiary Toy Biz argued before the U.S. Court of International Trade, that their action figures (including the X-Men and Fantastic Four) represented \"nonhuman creatures\" and were subject to the lower tariff rates for toys instead of the higher ones for dolls. On January 3, 2003, after examining more than 60 action figures, Judge Judith Barzilay ruled in their favor, granting Toy Biz reimbursement for import taxes on previous toys.\n\nBecause a common theme in Marvel Comics had been the struggle for mutants like the X-Men to prove their humanity, the case shocked numerous fans. Marvel responded to these concerns by claiming \"our heroes are living, breathing human beingsbut humans who have extraordinary abilities ... A decision that the X-Men figures indeed do have 'nonhuman' characteristics further proves our characters have special, out-of-this world powers\".\n\nThe Harmonized Tariff Schedule was amended to eliminate the distinction between dolls and other toys, which are now in the same category.\n\n"}

Banking on Parton's talent and appeal, however, ABC paid the performer a reported $44 million for a two-year contract.\n\nThough most of the show's episodes were taped in ABC's studios in Los Angeles, a number of \"special\" episodes were recorded on location, including one in Hawaii, one in New Orleans, one in Nashville (featuring most of the cast of the Grand Ole Opry), and a Thanksgiving episode in Parton's hometown of Sevierville, Tennessee, featuring most of her extended family.\n\nWith 39.47 million viewers, the first episode of \"Dolly\" attracted the largest audience for any television series premiere until \"Undercover Boss\" in 2010. It was acknowledged that a great deal of talent and work went into producing the show, but the initially high ratings during the first few episodes steadily declined, and despite many format changes and other attempts to create interest, ratings did not improve. Halfway through the run, Parton, who retained creative control over the show, took command and jettisoned many of the lavish, splashy segments that she felt were not working in favor of a more \"down home\" feel. By this time, however, many of the initial viewers had already stopped watching. To bolster the odds they brought in veteran variety show writers Buddy Sheffield, John Aylesworth, Jack Burns and producer Nick Vanoff. Around this same time, Parton also hired then-relatively-unknown Brett Butler as one of the writers. Bruce Vilanch and Fannie Flagg were also on the writing staff.\n\nThe opening theme song was Parton's 1978 hit, \"Baby I'm Burning\" (later to be replaced with \"Hoedown-Showdown\"); as with her 1976 series, Parton closed each week with her signature song, \"I Will Always Love You.\"\n\n"}

The parish has a population of 626. The parish includes the hamlets of Milton and Witcombe.\n\nAsh has a primary school which was awarded outstanding in 2008 Ofsted report and titled the best primary school in the uk.\n\nThe name Ash, from the Old English \"aesc\" means \"place with/near ash tree(s).\" It was first mentioned in 1086 as ‘Aisse’, it next appears, in 1225 as ‘Esse’ .\nProbably derived from Old English ‘aesc’ the ash tree. Hence, (place at) the ash tree/s.\n\nMilton was first mentioned in 1284-6 as ‘Milton Fauconberg’ or ‘Falcenbridge’. There appear to be two possible derivations: The gentle enclosure from Old English ‘milde’ and ‘tun’ (cf Upper and Lower Milton, near Wells) or The middle enclosure from the Old English ‘middel’ and ‘tun’ Since Milton lies between the tithings of Long Load and Witcombe, the latter seems to be more likely as it was known as ‘Middleton’ in 1284-6.\n\nWitcombe means the white valley from the Old English ‘hwit’ and ‘cumb’. It occurs as ‘Whythicumbe’ in 1243, in which case cf Withycombe (near Carhampton), the willow valley from the Old English ‘wippe’ and ‘cumb’. It may also be ‘wide valley’ from Old English.\n\nThe medieval settlement seems to have included two separate hamlets on the two adjacent parallel lanes. These were the centres of the two medieval manors: Ash Boulogne to the west, and Pykesash to the east. Both nuclei are characterised by an irregular group of working farms.\n\nThe parish was created in 1895 from the north eastern quarter of Martock.\n\nThe parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council’s operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council.\n\nThe village falls within the Non-metropolitan district of South Somerset, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, having previously been part of Yeovil Rural District. The district council is responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism.\n\nSomerset County Council is responsible for running the largest and most expensive local services such as education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, policing and fire services, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning.\n\nIt is also part of the Somerton and Frome county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election, and part of the South West England constituency of the European Parliament which elects seven MEPs using the d'Hondt method of party-list proportional representation.\n\nEntertainer Belinda Evans was born in 1978 in Ash, and is a soprano singer. She has a BA(Hons) in Music, and also has a postgraduate diploma. In 2003 she found fame by singing the national anthem before every England game at the 2003 Rugby Union World Cup in Australia.\n\nEvans was one of the ten finalists in the BBC series \"How Do You Solve a Problem Like Maria?\", and has made her West End debut as Swing in Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber's production of \"The Phantom of the Opera\".\n"}

Time magazine included it in their 100 greatest toys ever.\n\nDuring its initial release in the 1980s, the Skip-It apparatus became a commercial success through its advertisements on daytime Nickelodeon broadcasting as well as other children's programming.\n\nIt was based on 1960s toy Lemon Twist, which featured a lemon-shaped weight which was spun round the ankle.\n\nDuring a second production occurring in the early 1990s—that was referred to by the then-CEO as a \"Skip-It Renaissance\"—the toy was manufactured with a counter on the Skip-It ball to record the number of skips. As a result, sales doubled from the late 1980s. Some Skip-Its had colorful glitter filled and covered plastic decorations that can be slid on in order to make colorful patterns while being twirled about. There were also ribbon streamers, charms and stickers to decorate Skip Its, which were discontinued sometime in 2009.\n\nA version of the toy was featured in the Hong Kong martial art movie \"Butterfly and Sword\" (1993) where the character Miu Siu Siu / Ho Ching is seen playing with it. \n\nIn 2013, a spin-off of the board game Twister was developed, Twister Rave Skip-It.\n"}

{"id": "2201510", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2201510", "title": "The Groundhogs", "text": "The Groundhogs\n\nThe Groundhogs are a British rock band founded in late 1963, that toured extensively in the 1960s, achieved prominence in the early 1970s and continued sporadically into the 21st century. Tony McPhee (guitar and vocals) is the sole constant member of the group, which has gone through many personnel changes but usually records and performs as a power trio.\n\nThe band was originally formed as The Dollar Bills in New Cross, London in 1962 by brothers Pete and John Cruickshank (born in 1943 and 1945 respectively in Calcutta, West Bengal, India). Tony McPhee (born 22 March 1944), the lead guitarist in an instrumental group called the Seneschals, joined the group later that same year. McPhee steered them towards the blues and renamed them after a John Lee Hooker song, \"Groundhog's Blues\".\n\nJohn Cruickshank suggested they became John Lee's Groundhogs when they backed John Lee Hooker on his 1964 UK tour: they later supplemented Little Walter, Jimmy Reed and Champion Jack Dupree when they toured the UK. McPhee featured on Dupree's \"From New Orleans to Chicago\" (1966) alongside Eric Clapton. The Groundhogs issued \"Shake It\" b/w \"Rock Me\" on the Interphon record label in January 1965.\n\nTheir line-up on their first album, \"Scratchin' the Surface\", (produced by the 19-year-old Head Of A&R for Liberty Records, Mike Batt) released in November 1968, consisted of McPhee as singer and guitarist; bassist Peter Cruickshank (born 2 July 1945, in Calcutta), Ken Pustelnik on drums (born 13 March 1946 on a farm near Blairgowrie, Angus, Scotland) and Steve Rye on harmonica (born 8 March 1946 in London – died 19 July 1992, in London). In 1969, the single \"B.D.D.\" (Blind Deaf Dumb) flopped in the UK but hit number one in Lebanon.\n\nThe group's album releases \"Blues Obituary\" (September 1969); \"Thank Christ for the Bomb\" (May 1970); \"Split\" (March 1971); and \"Who Will Save the World? The Mighty Groundhogs\" (March 1972), recorded as a trio without Rye, all but \"Blues Obituary\" the Top 10 in the UK Albums Chart. \"Split\" reached number 5, spending 27 weeks in the UK Albums Chart and achieved gold record status, while a single release from the album, \"Cherry Red\", was featured on BBC Television's \"Top of the Pops\" programme on 22 April 1971.\n\nThey supported The Rolling Stones on their 1971 British tour at the request of Mick Jagger and released an album of their live set on the Stones tour, recorded at Leeds University and called \"Live at Leeds\". All these albums and live shows were performed by the classic power trio of Cruickshank, McPhee and Pustelnik. 1974's album \"Solid\" saw a last return to the charts.\n\nAfter breaking up in 1974, they returned in 1975 with a different line-up. Two albums, \"Crosscut Saw\" and \"Black Diamond\", were released in 1976. At times in the 1990s, McPhee alternated two line-ups. After years of performing and recording for a loyal following, original manager Roy Fisher put together a short-lived 'original line-up' to celebrate their fortieth anniversary. McPhee left the band again to pursue an acoustic career, leaving Cruickshank and Pustelnik to continue, subsequently forming 'The Groundhogs Rhythm Section' with invited frontmen, latterly with Eddie Martin, while McPhee embarked on a major tour in 2004 with Edgar Winter and Alvin Lee and issued an acoustic blues album \"Blues at Ten\".\n\nMcPhee put together a new band in 2007, with long-time Groundhogs bassist Dave Anderson (ex-Hawkwind) and Marco Anderson on drums. This trio toured the UK in 2008 with Focus and Martin Turner's Wishbone Ash. The 2009 line-up of Tony McPhee's Groundhogs comprised McPhee, Anderson and previous long-term drummer Mick Jones. The Groundhogs Rhythm Section's latest recruits, Bob Bowles (guitar, vocals) and Jon Buckett (guitars, keyboards, vocals), joined Ken Pustelnik and Pete Cruickshank in February 2011. As of 2011, the new Groundhogs' lineup consisted of McPhee, Anderson, Joanna Deacon (vocals), and Carl Stokes (drums) from the death rock band 'Cancer'. Due to McPhee's ongoing health issues relating to a stroke in 2009, Tony McPhee & The Groundhogs retired in January 2014; although Tony McPhee and Carl Stokes have since worked with David Tibet's Current 93.\n\n\n\n\n\nas The Groundhogs:\n\n\n\nas Tony McPhee and the Groundhogs:\n\nas Tony McPhee (solo):\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2201511", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2201511", "title": "Chris Woods", "text": "Chris Woods\n\nChristopher Charles Eric Woods (born 14 November 1959) is a former England international football goalkeeper. He played in the Football League and Premier League for Nottingham Forest, Queens Park Rangers, Norwich City, Sheffield Wednesday, Reading, Southampton and Burnley. He also played in the Scottish Football League for Rangers and in Major League Soccer for the Colorado Rapids.\n\nWoods was Peter Shilton's long-time understudy in the England team in the mid to late 1980s, finally claiming the number one shirt for himself in the early 1990s. In all, he managed to accrue 43 caps in an eight-year international career.\n\nWoods has been goalkeeper coach for Everton, the United States and Manchester United. He was most recently coaching at West Ham United.\n\nWhen 17 years old, Woods joined Nottingham Forest as an apprentice in 1976, initially as back-up for John Middleton, then Peter Shilton. With Shilton cup-tied for the 1977–78 Football League Cup, having already played for Stoke City in that season's competition, Woods played every match as Forest reached the final, where they beat Liverpool in a replay, Woods keeping two clean sheets in the process. Shilton remained the club's first choice goalkeeper, and the 1977–78 League Cup games proved to be Woods' only senior appearances for the club as they went on to win the Football League, League Cup again, and European Cup.\n\nQueens Park Rangers paid £250,000 for 19-year-old Woods in July 1979. As first choice at QPR, Woods made his Football League debut, playing 63 league games over the next two seasons.\n\nIn May 1981 Norwich signed him for £225,000. In 1985 Woods won his second League Cup final, beating Sunderland 1–0 at Wembley. Norwich were relegated at the end of that season. England coach Bobby Robson took Woods on a post-season tour of America. Woods won a second division championship medal the year after. In 2002, he was voted into the club's Hall of Fame.\n\nGraeme Souness signed Woods for Rangers in the summer of 1986 for £600,000. He was part of an influx of English talent brought in by Souness, which also included Terry Butcher and Graham Roberts. Woods won a Scottish Premier Division title and a Scottish League Cup medal in his first season. From November 1986 to January 1987 he set a British record by playing 1196 consecutive minutes of competitive football without conceding a goal. The run was ended at Ibrox on 31 January 1987 when Adrian Sprott scored the only goal for Hamilton Academical in the 70th minute of a Scottish Cup tie.\n\nWoods won another Scottish League Cup winners medal with Rangers in 1987–88, although rivals Celtic won a league and Scottish Cup double. Rangers regained the league title in 1989. Woods missed half the season with an infection that affected his balance and vision. Woods won further Scottish league titles in 1989–90 and 1990–91. In the 1991 close season, new Rangers manager Walter Smith replaced Woods with Scottish international Andy Goram. This signing was made in part because UEFA had introduced a rule limiting foreign players, which meant that Rangers could only field three non-Scottish players in European matches.\n\nIn August 1991, Woods signed for Trevor Francis at Sheffield Wednesday for £1.2 million. Wednesday had just won the League Cup and promotion to England's top tier.\n\nWednesday lost the 1993 Football League Cup Final 2–1 to Arsenal. A few weeks later Woods lost in the 1993 FA Cup Final. Wednesday again played Arsenal initially drawing 1–1. Arsenal's Andy Linighan's header made them the 2–1 winner in the closing seconds of extra time. Ironically, both Linighan and Woods were former Norwich players, with defeat in both finals costing Wednesday a place in Europe for 1993–94.\n\nBy the 1995–96 season Woods was out of favour at Wednesday to Kevin Pressman as first-choice goalkeeper. Woods had a short loan spell at Reading.\n\nIn 1996, he joined Colorado Rapids in the USA. In October 1996, Graeme Souness, now manager at Southampton, negotiated his loan from Colorado Rapids as cover for Dave Beasant, with a view to a permanent transfer. His second league appearance came in a 7–1 defeat at the hands of Everton, and in his fourth league appearance he broke his leg at Blackburn Rovers after which he returned to the US to recuperate.\n\nHe then returned to England for spells at Sunderland and Burnley. He retired from playing in 1998.\n\nIn the England squad Woods was once again Shilton's back-up. Woods debuted in a friendly against the USA in Los Angeles on 16 June 1985 while a Norwich City player. He was rarely left out of an England squad again over the next five years. Woods went to the 1986 World Cup in Mexico but did not play. England went out in the quarter-finals.\n\nWhen at Rangers Woods received his second start in his fifth cap in a 2–0 Wembley win over Yugoslavia that inched England further towards 1988 European Championships qualification. Woods came on as a substitute for Shilton twice in 1987 and started two matches: a European Championships qualifier against Turkey and a goalless draw against Scotland at Hampden Park in the Rous Cup. Two more starts followed in the subsequent season prior to the European Championships in Germany.\n\nEngland suffered two defeats in the opening brace of group games at the 1988 European Championships, and therefore Robson could afford to rest Shilton for the third and final group match, against the USSR, which had been rendered meaningless. Woods therefore played his first match in a competitive finals, his 13th in total, conceding three times in a 3–1 defeat.\n\nBy now, another goalkeeper had emerged as a potential successor to the ageing Shilton, with QPR's David Seaman receiving a first cap in a draw against Saudi Arabia in Riyadh. However, Woods was still regarded by Robson as his primary understudy for Shilton, who had, by now, earned his 100th cap and was about to break Bobby Moore's record of 108. Also on the scene was Dave Beasant, who won two caps as a sub as Robson checked out other goalkeepers, but Woods remained Robson's first choice if ever Shilton was unable to play. As all this went on, England qualified for the 1990 World Cup in Italy.\n\nRobson chose Woods and Seaman as Shilton's understudies in the initial squad, but days before a hand injury to David Seaman forced Bobby Robson to drop Seaman and replace him with Beasant. England went to the semi-finals, where they lost on penalties to West Germany.\n\nWoods did not play in the World Cup, Robson choosing to keep Shilton in the side for his 125th and final cap for England in the third place play-off match against Italy after their semi-final defeat. Robson quit after the tournament and successor Graham Taylor instantly installed Woods as his number one. By summer 1991, Woods had accumulated 24 caps as England made steady progress through their qualification for the 1992 European Championships, unbeaten in six matches with three clean sheets and conceding only three goals.\n\nHe went to the 1992 European Championships as England's first-choice keeper and kept clean sheets in his first two matches against Denmark and France. England did not score in either, so victory was crucial against hosts Sweden in the last group match. Sweden won 2–1, however, so England were eliminated and Woods had suffered major disappointment in his first (and ultimately his only) tournament as England's number-one keeper.\n\nHe stayed in the side the following year as England stuttered in their qualification campaign for the 1994 World Cup. Woods conceded a crucial equaliser from a long-range shot from Kjetil Rekdal in a 1–1 home draw with Norway and an 85th-minute penalty from Peter van Vossen in a 2–2 home draw with the Netherlands. In June 1993 England lost a crucial match in Oslo against Norway. Then, after a defeat against the USA in Boston during a summer tour in 1993, Taylor dropped Woods and, after trying two other keepers, installed Seaman in the side. Woods' 43-cap international career ended where it began, with a game against the US, although he was an unused substitute for the following four internationals.\n\nWoods took up a coaching position under Walter Smith at Everton in 1998, where he was tasked with the development of the club's goalkeepers. In July 2013 Woods left Everton to take the goalkeeping coach position at Manchester United, following the same move by first team manager David Moyes. Woods retained his position when Moyes was sacked, in April 2014, but was replaced by Frans Hoek, when Moyes' permanent successor, Louis van Gaal, was appointed. In June 2015 he became goalkeeping coach at West Ham United. He left the role in May 2018 following the appointment of new manager, Manuel Pellegrini.\n\nParallel to being a club coach, in 2011 Woods was employed by the United States men's national soccer team, linking up with Everton goalkeeper Tim Howard.\n\nNottingham Forest\n\nNorwich City\n\nRangers\n\n"}

Firmin was one of his grandchildren. The family's paper manufactory was located at Essonnes, a town c. 30 km southeast of Paris near Corbeil, which had notable paper factories.\n\nDidot invented the word \"stereotype\", which in printing refers to the metal printing plate created for the actual printing of pages (as opposed to printing pages directly with movable type), and used the process extensively, revolutionizing the book trade by his cheap editions. His manufactory was a place of pilgrimage for the printers of the world.\n\nHe first used the process in his edition of Callet’s \"Tables of Logarithms\" (1795), in which he secured an accuracy till then unattainable. He published stereotyped editions of French, English and Italian classics at a very low price. \nAt the 1798 Exposition des produits de l'industrie française Pierre and Firmin Didot and Louis Etienne Herhan won an honorable distinction, the highest award, for their \"Superb edition of Virgil with characters and ink of their manufacture; a stereotype plate, and an in-12 edition of the works of Virgil and Lafontaine with these characters.\"\n\nDidot was appointed by Napoleon as the director of the Imprimerie Impériale typefoundry. \n\nHe was also the author of two tragedies \"La Reine de Portugal\" and \"La Mort d’Annibal\" and he wrote metrical translations from Virgil, Tyrtaeus and Theocritus.\n\nFrance is indebted to the Didot family for the publication of the \"Biographie Nationale\", and Belgium is also indebted for the establishment of her Royal Press.

It quantifies the number and duration of recurrences of a dynamical system presented by its phase space trajectory.\n\nThe recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) was developed in order to quantify differently appearing recurrence plots (RPs), based on the small-scale structures therein. Recurrence plots are tools which visualise the recurrence behaviour of the phase space trajectory formula_1 of dynamical systems:\n\nwhere formula_3 and formula_4 a predefined distance.\n\nRecurrence plots mostly contain single dots and lines which are parallel to the mean diagonal (\"line of identity\", LOI) or which are vertical/horizontal. Lines parallel to the LOI are referred to as \"diagonal lines\" and the vertical structures as \"vertical lines\". Because an RP is usually symmetric, horizontal and vertical lines correspond to each other, and, hence, only vertical lines are considered. The lines correspond to a typical behaviour of the phase space trajectory: whereas the diagonal lines represent such segments of the phase space trajectory which run parallel for some time, the vertical lines represent segments which remain in the same phase space region for some time.\n\nIf only a time series is available, the phase space can be reconstructed by using a time delay embedding (see Takens' theorem):\n\nwhere formula_6 is the time series, formula_7 the embedding dimension and formula_8 the time delay.\n\nThe RQA quantifies the small-scale structures of recurrence plots, which present the number and duration of the recurrences of a dynamical system. The measures introduced for the RQA were developed heuristically between 1992 and 2002 (Zbilut & Webber 1992; Webber & Zbilut 1994; Marwan et al. 2002). They are actually measures of complexity. The main advantage of the recurrence quantification analysis is that it can provide useful information even for short and non-stationary data, where other methods fail.\n\nRQA can be applied to almost every kind of data. It is widely used in physiology, but was also successfully applied on problems from engineering, chemistry, Earth sciences etc.\n\nThe simplest measure is the recurrence rate, which is the density of recurrence points in a recurrence plot:\n\nThe recurrence rate corresponds with the probability that a specific state will recur. It is almost equal with the definition of the correlation sum, where the LOI is excluded from the computation.\n\nThe next measure is the percentage of recurrence points which form diagonal lines in the recurrence plot of minimal length formula_10:\n\nwhere formula_12 is the frequency distribution of the lengths formula_13 of the diagonal lines (i.e., it counts how many instances have length formula_13). This measure is called determinism and is related with the predictability of the dynamical system, because white noise has a recurrence plot with almost only single dots and very few diagonal lines, whereas a deterministic process has a recurrence plot with very few single dots but many long diagonal lines.\n\nThe amount of recurrence points which form vertical lines can be quantified in the same way:\n\nwhere formula_16 is the frequency distribution of the lengths formula_17 of the vertical lines, which have at least a length of formula_18. This measure is called laminarity and is related with the amount of laminar phases in the system (intermittency).\n\nThe lengths of the diagonal and vertical lines can be measured as well. The averaged diagonal line length\n\nis related with the \"predictability time\" of the dynamical system\nand the trapping time, measuring the average length\nof the vertical lines,\n\nis related with the \"laminarity time\" of the dynamical system, i.e. how long the system remains in a specific state.\n\nBecause the length of the diagonal lines is related on the time how long segments of the phase space trajectory run parallel, i.e. on the divergence behaviour of the trajectories, it was sometimes stated that the reciprocal of the maximal length of the diagonal lines (without LOI) would be an estimator for the positive maximal Lyapunov exponent of the dynamical system. Therefore, the maximal diagonal line length formula_21 or the divergence\n\nare also measures of the RQA. However, the relationship between these measures with the positive maximal Lyapunov exponent is not as easy as stated, but even more complex (to calculate the Lyapunov exponent from an RP, the whole frequency distribution of the diagonal lines has to be considered). The divergence can have the trend of the positive maximal Lyapunov exponent, but not more. Moreover, also RPs of white noise processes can have a really long diagonal line, although very seldom, just by a finite probability. Therefore the divergence cannot reflect the maximal Lyapunov exponent.\n\nThe probability formula_23 that a diagonal line has exactly length formula_13 can be estimated from the frequency distribution formula_12 with formula_26. The Shannon entropy of this probability,\n\nreflects the complexity of the deterministic structure in the system. However, this entropy depends sensitively on the bin number and, thus, may differ for different realisations of the same process, as well as for different data preparations.\n\nThe last measure of the RQA quantifies the thinning-out of the recurrence plot. The trend is the regression coefficient of a linear relationship between the density of recurrence points in a line parallel to the LOI and its distance to the LOI. More exactly, consider the recurrence rate in a diagonal line parallel to LOI of distance \"k\" (\"diagonal-wise recurrence rate\"):\n\nthen the trend is defined by\n\nwith formula_30 as the average value and formula_31. This latter relation should ensure to avoid the edge effects of too low recurrence point densities in the edges of the recurrence plot. The measure \"trend\" provides information about the stationarity of the system.\n\nSimilar to the diagonal-wise defined recurrence rate, the other measures based on the diagonal lines (DET, L, ENTR) can be defined diagonal-wise. These definitions are useful to study interrelations or synchronisation between different systems (using recurrence plots or cross recurrence plots).\n\nInstead of computing the RQA measures of the entire recurrence plot, they can be computed in small windows moving over the recurrence plot along the LOI. This provides time-dependent RQA measures which allow detecting, e.g., chaos-chaos transitions (Marwan et al. 2002). Note: the choice of the size of the window can strongly influence the measure \"trend\".\n\n\n\n"}

Tanner won the tournament held in January, Vitas Gerulaitis won the December tournament. Tanner reached the Wimbledon final in 1979, losing to Björn Borg in five sets.\n\nTanner was in the news in the 2000s for legal problems that included stretches of imprisonment, arrests for missing child support payments, allegations of financial misdeeds, and bankruptcy.\n\nLeonard Roscoe Tanner III hailed from Lookout Mountain, Tennessee, graduated from Baylor School in Chattanooga, and with teammate Sandy Mayer helped to lead Stanford University's rise to national prominence in collegiate tennis. Tanner played number one singles, with Mayer playing number two. In 1972, Tanner and Mayer won the NCAA doubles championship, and the Stanford team finished second in the NCAA tournament, behind Trinity (TX). The team also featured Chico Hagey, Rick Fisher, Jim Delaney, Gery Groslimond, Chip Fisher, Paul Sidone, and Tim Noonan.\n\nTanner defeated Haroon Rahim 10–8 in the fifth set to win the 1970 United States Amateur Championships.\n\nTanner defeated Guillermo Vilas in three straight sets in the 1977 Australian Open (January) final, to win his first and only grand slam title. Tanner lost a five set match to Björn Borg in the 1979 Wimbledon final, which was the first Wimbledon final to be broadcast live in the United States as part of NBC's \"Breakfast at Wimbledon\". Tanner avenged this loss to Borg by beating him in four sets in the US Open quarterfinals two months later, a match where Tanner's 140 mph serve brought the net down during the fourth set. Tanner lost to Vitas Gerulaitis in the semifinals. Tanner described his 1979 US Open win over Borg and loss to Gerulaitis in his autobiography as \"the highest of my highs and the lowest of my lows on a tennis court within two days of each other\".\n\nTanner's strong left-handed serve was thrown very low and struck with a lunge involving the whole body, earning him the nickname \"The Rocket\". His booming 153 mph serve was the fastest ever recorded in tournament competition from February 1978 until Andy Roddick posted a 155 mph serve in a Davis Cup semifinal in September 2004 against Vladimir Voltchkov.\n\nHe won the Davis Cup in 1981 playing with John McEnroe, Eliot Teltscher and Peter Fleming on a team captained by Arthur Ashe that defeated Argentina in the final, played at Riverfront Coliseum in Cincinnati.\n\nThe Australian Open was played twice in 1977, in January and December.\n\nTanner has been married three times, first to Nancy, then Charlotte and last to Margaret. He has five children, all daughters.\n\nTanner has coached Dennis Early, Frank Norman, Jesse Stirge, Adrienne Radakovic and a session with Kenzo Wong.\n\nTanner has an extensive record of conflicts with the law. He was first arrested in 1997 for failure to pay child support. He was arrested again in June 2003 on a fugitive warrant on charges related to passing a bad check and to further nonpayment of child support.

{"id": "2201625", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2201625", "title": "Barwick, Somerset", "text": "Barwick, Somerset\n\nBarwick is a village and parish in Somerset, England, about south of Yeovil in the South Somerset district and on the border with Dorset. The parish, which includes the village of Stoford has a population of 1,221.\n\nThe earliest signs of habitation in the area were the relics of a Bronze Age burial which were found in 1826, a little to the north of the village of Stoford, which may be a Saxon name derived from Stow-Ford.\n\nSettlement may go back as far as Saxon times, the earliest mention of Barwick being in 1185.\nIn the Middle Ages, Stoford was shown as a new town and in an Inquisition or survey of 1273 there were 74 burgages each paying 10d (ten pence) a year. The total population of the borough in 1273 was probably over 500. Stoford kept its borough status for at least 300 years. A guildhall was mentioned in 1361 and there is proof of a separate borough court. There was still a 'borough of Stoford' in the musters of 1569.\n\nThe parish was part of the hundred of Houndsborough.\n\nThe parish council is responsible for local issues. It sets an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council's operating costs and produces annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council.\n\nThe village falls within the non-metropolitan district of South Somerset, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, having previously been part of Yeovil Rural District. The district council is responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks and tourism.\n\nSomerset County Council is responsible for running the largest and most expensive local services such as education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, policing and fire services, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning.\n\nIt is also part of the Yeovil county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election, and part of the South West England constituency of the European Parliament which elects seven MEPs using the d'Hondt method of party-list proportional representation.\n\nThe estate originally formed part of the property of Syon Abbey, and passed through various hands after the Dissolution in the 1530s.\nThe present house and park are thought to have been built in 1770 by John and Grace Newman, whose relations owned neighbouring Newton Surmaville.\n\nThe house was set in pleasure grounds containing a lake and grotto, while the surrounding parkland was ornamented with a Gothic lodge and a group of four follies. In the early 19th century the estate passed to Thomas Messiter, a barrister, who was John Newman's nephew and in 1830 the mansion was remodelled in a Jacobean Revival style. An orangery was constructed adjoining the north side at the same period. During the early 20th century the estate was let to various persons.\n\nDuring World War II, it was the location of a prisoner of war camp, initially housing Italian prisoners from the Western Desert Campaign, and later German prisoners after the Battle of Normandy.\n\nFollowing derequisition of the property, after the war, the Messiter family carried out considerable modernisation and repairs and took up residence. They remained there until some time in the 1960s.\n\nFrom the early 1970s through to the mid 1980s the mansion and surrounding grounds were let to Pagems Schools Ltd and Headmaster Major Arthur Gray for use as a privately run boarding school attracting boys from London, Liverpool, Bristol, Swansea and several other areas around the country. The school was also part of the Sea Cadet Corps, known as T.S. Gryphon with affiliations to HMS Hampshire (D06)|H.M.S. Hampshire and nearby RNAS Yeovilton H.M.S. Heron. The school closed around 1986/87 due to bankruptcy.\n\nIn the 1990s the estate was sold to a private owner, and substantial repairs were carried out to the house, orangery and landscape structures. The site remains in private ownership.\n\nBarwick Park boasts four follies. Locals say they were built to give the estate labourers work during a time of depression in the 1820s. They were possibly commissioned by George Messiter of Barwick to mark the park boundaries at the four cardinal points: Jack the Treacle Eater (a stone arch topped by a round tower) to the east, the Fish Tower in the north, Messiter's Cone (also known as the Rose Tower), which is high, at the west end and the Needle to the south. However, paintings of Barwick House in the 1780s, forty years earlier, include two of the follies.\n\nThe follies collectively rank on Countryfile's 2009 countdown of \"Britain's top 10 follies\".\n\nThe parish contains Yeovil Junction railway station, on the London–Exeter line.\n\nThe Church of Saint Mary Magdalene is just off the A37 at the western end of the village, about half a mile away from the main centre of population.\nThe church was built before 1219 as a chapel of the minster church in Yeovil. It has been rebuilt and restored since, particularly in the 1850 when the chancel was rebuilt. There is still a weekly service. The ecclesiastical parish is now part of the benefice of Holy Trinity, Yeovil.\nThe most architecturally significant features of the church are the bench ends, dating from 1533 - the eve of the English Reformation. The bench ends depict scenes from village life as well as typical pagan symbolism from that period such as the Green Man and the unicorn, a symbol of eternal life. There are also religious objects dating back much earlier, presumably from the church originally on the site, e.g. the Norman font.\n\nThe church has been designated by English Heritage as a Grade II* listed building.\n\nA short lived greyhound racing track was opened on Saturday 22 August 1931 at Barwick Field on Long Lane near Barwick Park. The racing was independent (not affiliated to the sports governing body the National Greyhound Racing Club) and was known as a flapping track, which was the nickname given to independent tracks. The race distance was 525 yards, the racing ended in early 1932.\n"}

Beginning in 1938, the DDSG transported Jews who were on so-called \"B-immigration transports\". The DDSG was also involved in taking excessive amounts of money and property from Jews in order to transport them. The SS worked with the DDSG in making the exit permits for Jews easier to obtain, since, at this point, the Nazis apparently just wanted them to leave the country. Although the Gestapo had leverage over the DDSG, the DDSG was a group that operated on its own will, in order to profit from forced Jewish emigration.\n\nIn 1991 the company was split into a passenger transportation enterprise and a cargo transport company. The company was sold to a private owner in 1993. Today the DDSG exists in the form of the two private companies DDSG-Blue Danube Schiffahrt GmbH (passenger transport) and the DDSG-Cargo GmbH.\n\nSince the German spelling reform of 1996, \"Schifffahrt\" is written with three \"f\"s; however, since the name belongs to a company that existed before the spelling reform, the old form of the name is used when referring to the company.\n\nThe name of the company is well known in German-speaking countries as a starter to humorously construct even longer compound words. ' is such a word, which potentially might even have been used, but probably never actually was. It means a \"DDSG captain's hat\". Another common example is ' which means \"DDSG captain's cabin key\".\n\n\n"}

In the process of qualifying he overcame promising Newcastle junior Ross Flanagan who had match point against Bowrey. Bowrey held on to win and Ross Flanagan decided to pursue a less spectacular career as a Physics and Sports Biomechanics Lecturer at The University of Newcastle.\n\nBowrey reached the quarters of the Australian (international amateur) Championships in 1965 (losing to John Newcombe), 1966 (losing to Roy Emerson) and 1967 (losing to Emerson) and the US Open quarters in 1966 (losing to Manuel Santana). At the 1967 US Open doubles, Bowrey and partner Owen Davidson lost the final to Newcombe and Roche in four sets. At the end of 1967, John Newcombe, Roy Emerson and Tony Roche had all signed professional contracts, which left the amateur game devoid of talent. A poor quality field lined up for the 1968 Australian championships, which were held at Melbourne's historic Kooyong Lawn Tennis Club. Bowrey was the top seed. In the final Bowrey met the Spaniard Juan Gisbert, which he won in four sets. A month after his Australian triumph Bowrey married the women's player Lesley Turner. The game went open in April that year and at the first Open Wimbledon Bowrey lost in the second round to Andrés Gimeno. Defending his Australian title the following year Bowrey blew a two sets to love lead in the quarters against Ray Ruffels. Bowrey represented Australia in two Davis Cup rounds, the first against the U.S in the World Group Final in December 1968, where he lost to Clark Graebner in five sets and beat Arthur Ashe in four sets. The second in the North & Central America draw in May 1969 versus Mexico, where he won against Joaquin Loyo-Mayo and lost to Rafael Osuna.\n\nBowrey was also involved in one of the longest matches in tennis history at Wimbledon in 1970 against Patricio Cornejo that consumed nearly four hours and took 84 games. In January 1970 Bowrey turned professional which meant he was no longer eligible to play in the Davis Cup. Later that year Bowrey with partner Marty Riessen won the Rogers Cup (formerly Canadian Open) in two sets against Fred Stolle and Cliff Drysdale 6–3, 6–2. He also won the Rome ATP World Tour Masters – Doubles that year with Owen Davidson.\n\nBowrey married fellow tennis professional Lesley Turner in 1968 and went into semi-retirement in 1972 at the age of just 28, becoming a coach. After their playing careers were over, Bowrey and his wife Lesley became the lead match-play commentators at Wimbledon on the All-England Club's radio station and Internet Web site \"Radio Wimbledon.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "2201634", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2201634", "title": "Nick Fury (Ultimate Marvel character)", "text": "Nick Fury (Ultimate Marvel character)\n\nGeneral Nicholas Joseph Fury is a fictional character appearing in comic books published by Marvel Comics' Ultimate Marvel section as a different version of Nick Fury. He has a substantial presence in all the Ultimate Marvel comics, appearing first in \"Ultimate Marvel Team-Up\" and \"Ultimate X-Men\" and later reappearing regularly in \"Ultimate Spider-Man\" and finally securing a regular, recurring role as the general of S.H.I.E.L.D. and the leader of the Ultimates, a re-imagining of the Avengers. This character was designed to look like Samuel L. Jackson who later went on to portray the character in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\n\nWhen Nick Fury first made his appearance in the Ultimate Universe, he had a vastly different design, resembling more the original mainstream version with notable differences, featuring a full head of close-cropped hair, a clean-shaven, younger appearance (particularly as depicted in \"Ultimate Marvel Team-Up\") and less visible scarring around his eye-patch, not to mention lacking a specific resemblance to any actor. He wore seemingly normal clothing which integrated outlandishly high-tech capabilities such as phasing, invisibility, and \"para-shoes\" that allow him to descend hundreds of feet without the aid of a parachute (shown to be capable of flight in later issues).\n\nWhen the character resurfaced in 2002 in \"The Ultimates\", he had been redesigned to look like actor Samuel L. Jackson. and first appeared with this revised look in \"The Ultimates\" #1, as drawn by Bryan Hitch. The similarity is even noted within the comic itself, in a scene in which the Ultimates discuss who they think should play each of them in a hypothetical movie about the team. Fury's answer for himself is \"Mr. Samuel L. Jackson, of course, no discussion.\"\n\nIn \"The Mighty Avengers\" #13, Nick Fury (of the Earth-616 universe) uses a disguise that is similar in appearance to Ultimate Fury. This receives comment from Daisy Johnson as \"his worst disguise ever.\" Conversely, in \"Ultimate Mystery\", it is the Ultimate version of the character who disguises himself, resembling his Earth-616 counterpart and gets the same comment. In the mainstream event of \"Battle Scars\" (a follow-up to the \"Fear Itself\" crossover), it is revealed that the 616 Fury fathered a child with an African-American woman named Nia Jones. His child went under the alias \"Marcus Johnson\", but his real name is Nick Fury, Jr.. Fury Jr. closely resembles the Ultimate version of Fury. When the original Nick Fury decided to retire as director of S.H.I.E.L.D., the mantle was handed onto Fury Jr., who had recently lost his left eye and took to wearing an eye patch.\n\nNicholas Fury fought for the United States in World War II. During the invasion of Sicily, he, along with Private Fisk (the grandfather of Wilson Fisk) and Canadian paratrooper Corporal Howlett, attempted to loot a house. American military police arrived to arrest them, and all three were subdued. Fisk was grazed by a bullet, while Fury was imprisoned in an unknown location alongside several other black men, and Howlett, despite protests that he was Canadian, was also shipped to an unknown location. Fury was selected to be the next test subject for Project: Rebirth, as his blood work most closely matched that of Subject #22, the most successful of the previous test subjects. He was injected with a serum that gave him super-strength, which he used to free himself and the other prisoners, who then escaped. The scientists who were working on him let him escape, deciding that they have all the information that they needed for now.\n\nAfter attending college in India, Fury enlisted in the U.S. military, where he was deployed into various conflicts such as the Kosovo War. He was later assigned to S.H.I.E.L.D.'s Weapon X program in the original Gulf War. While transporting Wolverine in an adamantium cage, an Iraqi guerrilla ambushed and killed his team, inadvertently freeing Wolverine from his prison. After slaughtering the Iraqi guards, Wolverine discovered Fury, the only survivor of the ambush, and transported him back through the desert to the Allied forces. Although Wolverine was summarily subdued and re-imprisoned by his handlers, a bond between the two men was formed. The next day, Fury, already mostly healed, was confronted by General Thaddeus Ross. The General had discovered much was unusual about Fury and questioned him at length, prompting him to reexamine where he was going in life.\n\nYears later, the X-Men were abducted and imprisoned by the Weapon X program. This program was overseen at the time by Wraith, who had previously staged a coup against General Ross. This coup had prevented Ross from dismantling the Weapon X program altogether. Wolverine, the only X-Man who eludes capture, later asks Fury for help in freeing the other X-Men and bringing down the Weapon X program. During the operation, which also involves the Brotherhood of Mutants, Wraith was about to kill Nightcrawler, but was shot dead by Fury.\n\nFury is summarily promoted to General and resumes the duties of the Director of S.H.I.E.L.D. He was tasked with forming a team to battle posthuman threats and resurrecting the Super-Soldier program, two objectives that resulted in the formation of the Ultimates. Fury operates as the commander of the team, at times leading them into action, though he often shares duties with the revived World War II hero Captain America and billionaire genius Iron Man. Nick Fury is also responsible for monitoring superhumans who are not affiliated with the U.S. Military, including Peter Parker and the X-Men.\n\nNick Fury lost his right arm in a battle against the Liberators in \"The Ultimates\" (Vol. 2). He replaced it shortly thereafter with a bionic one.\n\nNick Fury has also been involved in the \"Ultimate Spider-Man\" comics. In them, he meets Peter after Norman Osborn returns. He states that S.H.I.E.L.D. was able to figure out who Peter was because of the security shots of the OG Spider biting Peter, as well as Dr. Octopus screaming that Peter Parker is Spider-Man while in jail. Nick Fury has been watching Peter and informs him that, due to his illegal genetically altered status, he will become the property of S.H.I.E.L.D. when he turns eighteen. Although Fury wants him to be part of the Ultimates, this may have changed because the Ultimates broke apart. Peter and Fury's relationship became strained after the \"Hobgoblin\" arc. Peter punches Fury for ignoring his questions for why Harry Osborn became the Hobgoblin. At that point, Fury told one of his scientists that he wanted to know everything about OZ and that it was time for Peter Parker to lose his spider powers. This follows on to the Ultimate Clone Saga, in which it is revealed by Fury that the Tinkerer's Spider-Slayers were developed to handle Peter if and when he ever went insane. Mary Jane Watson, upon discovering Fury's intentions, tells him that Peter looks up to him like a father. This convinced Fury to let Peter keep his powers, and he apologises to Peter, stating that in his line of work he's been trained to expect someone in Peter's position to crack under stress.\n\nFury was judged to be at least partially responsible for the devastation of much of Earth-31916 along with Emil Burbank. Burbank had sought a means to defeat the Hyperion of that universe. An alien organism, unleashed in an attempt to achieve this, spread throughout the United States, causing widespread devastation. A probe sent by Reed Richards provided evidence that an \"invasion from another universe\" was responsible. The Squadron Supreme was dispatched to the Ultimate Universe in order to arrest Richards so that he could stand trial for his \"crimes\". A lengthy battle ensued between the Squadron on one side and the Ultimates, Spider-Man, the X-Men, and the Fantastic Four on the other. Richards, believing himself to be responsible when the Squadron produced his probe as evidence, surrendered himself. Fury was unwilling to accept this and convinced Thor to create a bridge to Earth-31916, through which the Helicarrier was able to travel. Once there, another battle between the Squadron and the Ultimate Universe heroes began. Spider-Man learns that Fury had an ulterior motive - the retrieval of the probes and their data, and had conspired with Doctor Doom to do so. In addition, Fury had brought insurance in the form of the Hulk. It took the combined power of the Ultimate Universe heroes, the Earth-31916 Squadron Supreme, and their counterparts from Earth-712 to defeat the Hulk, but Doom had proven to be simply a Doombot. To stop the fighting, the Ultimates agreed to turn over Fury to the Earth-31916 Squadron and to allow to return with them to their universe. Fury tries to convince them that they are making a mistake, but his pleas are ignored.\n\nFury is seen still stranded in Earth-31916 in \"Squadron Supreme\" (Vol. 2) #1. He has apparently fulfilled the prophecy made by Hyperion in \"Ultimate Power\" #9: \"Given the strength of our military industrial complex, Fury would have risen here to even greater heights than your homeworld.\"\n\nFury returns to the Ultimate Universe in \"Ultimatum\" #4 and is instrumental in defeating Magneto. Jean Grey telepathically relays the information discovered by Fury in \"Ultimate Origins\" that mutants are not the next stage in human evolution, but are in fact the result of experimentation done by humans. This revelation causes Magneto to reverse the damage done to the Earth's magnetic poles.\n\nFollowing the events of \"Ultimatum\", Fury is informed by Hawkeye about how Captain America discovered the secret of the Red Skull. Fury asks head of S.H.I.E.L.D. Carol Danvers for permission to start up a \"death squad\" in order to catch the Red Skull and Cap, which he then carries out with the help of Hawkeye, Gregory Stark, and the rest of the .\n\nIn \"Ultimate Comics: Avengers\" Fury returned to S.H.I.E.L.D. again. After learning that Captain America went rogue after discovering that the Red Skull was his biological son, Fury re-activated \"Project Avenger\" and recruited a team of questionable super humans to find Captain America. Following Captain America's capture, Fury briefed the Avengers of AIM's purpose of creating the Cosmic Cube to build their visioned utopia and readied his team to thwart the organization's plans.\n\nFury guided his team of Avengers from headquarters, with the secret intent to go ahead with \"Plan B\", which is to detonate a nuclear warhead that was built into War Machine's armor by Gregory Stark in case the mission failed.\n\nCaptain America managed to arrive at the location of the battle between the Red Skull and the Avengers and teleported the jet to the exact location where the Red Skull was standing, impaling him through the chest with one of the rods that protrudes from its nose. The Red Skull was taken to a hospital and kept alive long enough for Gail, his mother, to say her goodbyes. Red Skull explained to Fury that all he wanted to do with the Cosmic Cube was turn back time and prevent Steve Rogers from being lost during the war so that he could grow up with him and lead a normal life, rather than the one he was given. Petra Laskov, dressed as a doctor, then entered the room and shot Red Skull in the head, killing him.\n\nA short time later, Fury is fixing his damaged prosthetic arm while speaking with Gregory Stark. Gregory concludes that it was in fact Fury himself who hired the Red Skull to come out of retirement, in some sort of plot to resurrect Project Avengers, securing him a position in S.H.I.E.L.D.'s employment and eventually regaining his old title as Director. Fury told him that was how he got the job the first time, and expects the same outcome this time as well. Fury and his Avengers later faced threats from the Ghost Rider and a vampiric menace.\n\nIn \"Ultimate Enemy\", approximately six months after Ultimatum, Fury is Black OPS and is \"Off the Grid\". He was enjoying a meal while under cover when the restaurant he was at was attacked by a creature with energy powers. Fury manages to hold the creature at bay until Spider-Man and Human Torch arrive at the scene to investigate. The creature vanishes after a short battle with the three of them. Peter is surprised to see Fury alive, as he has not seen him for months.\n\nNick breaks into the Triskelion and confronts Carol Danvers in the ladies' room and points a gun to her head, exclaiming that she is the only person who knew he was alive and would have motive to have him killed. The two fight before being interrupted by a female S.H.I.E.L.D. agent, informing Danvers that an attack has been made in Queens, which Fury knows is where the Parker residence is located. Simultaneously, the two order a Battalion of Hulkbuster agents to get to Queens to intercept the attacker, where they succeed in apprehending the monster attacking superhumans.\n\nAttempting to atone for his mistakes with Peter, Fury has taken on a more direct mentor role for Miles Morales as the new Spider-Man.\n\nWhen the Peter Parker of Earth-616 is sent to the Ultimate Universe, Fury interrogates him for information about his presence in this universe, accepting Peter's story that he came from another universe as nobody would come up with something that insane as a lie. Peter also notes that Ultimate Nick Fury is a lot cooler than the version Peter knows. Attempting to atone for his mistakes with his Peter, Fury allows the other Peter to visit his counterpart's family, and is satisfied when Peter gives Miles his blessing to become that world's new Spider-Man.\n\nNick joined HYDRA using a bio-camouflage to change his appearance under the name of \"Scorpio\" (resembling his classic mainstream look), stating that his motivations were to destroy the government that took everything away from him, although he still had a different agenda apart from Hydra's. The Ultimates managed to track him and tried to capture him, believing he was the traitor who provided Hydra with S.H.I.E.L.D. weapons. During an attack to Hydra's Death's Head camp, it was revealed Nick Fury was trying to destroy Hydra from the inside, while the S.H.I.E.L.D. traitor was actually Hydra leader Commander Crimson who used an Infinity Gem to battle her enemies, until a burst of energy made her disappear along with the artifact.\n\nIn the aftermath of the battle, Nick told Monica Chang he was planning to create his own team, the Howling Commandos, to battle Hydra the way the Ultimates couldn't, along ex-Hydra agent Abigail Brand. Before leaving, Chang told Fury he would be under her supervision.\n\nLike his Earth-616 counterpart, Nick Fury is an active physical man despite being over 80 years of age. Initially, he was not shown to use the Infinity Formula or other physical enhancements that his mainstream Marvel Universe counterpart possessed. However, Fury was later revealed to have served during World War II and was a test subject of the Super Soldier program (albeit as an unwilling participant). In this reality, the Super Soldier serum not only gave Fury low level super-human strength and agility but has also reduced his aging, allowing Fury to continue to be active despite his advanced chronological age.\n\nFury has had his right arm replaced with a cybernetic arm that gives him even greater strength than his enhanced biological original. The exact level of his cybernetic arm has not been specifically revealed. Unlike his mainstream counterpart who retains his injured eye despite being legally blind in it with a 95% vision loss, Fury has actually lost his left eye. The skin around the left eye-socket is shown to be badly scarred, extending beyond the eye patch.\n\nFury is an exceptional combatant and strategist and a gifted field leader. In his earliest appearances, he operated with technology years ahead of traditional forces, including the latest experimental weaponry, and some form of projected invisibility and the ability to walk through solid matter. These powers have very limited windows due to massive expense for any moment of \"uptime\"; costs for these run to the millions for less than a minute of use. He once used a chewing gum that was programmed to explode after 200 chews. The number of instances in which Fury uses these technologies has decreased since \"The Ultimates\" #1, and Fury is shown to primarily use conventional firearms.\n\nWhile General Fury was Director of S.H.I.E.L.D. he was constantly monitored and shadowed by dozens of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents and all known observation technologies.

Sharon came to India in 1973 after earning degrees in Humanities, Fine Arts, Asian Studies and Dance from the University of Michigan as a Fulbright Scholar to study Manipuri and later Chhau and Odissi.\n\nSharon Lowen grew up in Detroit, United States, where her father was a chemical engineer and her mother a clinical psychologist. She trained in modern dance, Cecchetti ballet and classes at the Detroit Institute of Arts in puppetry, mime and theater since childhood, was a member of the Detroit Puppetry Guild, Puppeteers of America and UNIMA, performed with George Latshaw’s puppets for the Detroit and Cleveland symphony orchestras and Jim Henson offered her an apprenticeship with the Muppets which was declined to accept a Fulbright scholarship to India.\n\nIndian family friends introduced her to Indian culture at an early age and her academic career at Michigan gave an exposure to Asian arts that nudged her toward India. Through the University of Michigan Honors College she created a triple-major BA in Humanities, Fine arts and Asian Studies. Studies in ethnomusicology, Indian art history, Indian history and religion with Professors William Malm, Walter Spink, John Broomfield and Padmanabhan Jaini, respectively as well as Manipuri dance with Minati Basu Roy encouraged her pursuit of an opportunity for deeper study of classical traditions in India. Social activism led to becoming the first freshman elected to the U of M Student Government Council.\n\nFollowing her Bachelor's degree in Humanities, Fine Arts, Asian Studies and an M.A. in Education and Dance, Lowen arrived in India on a Fulbright scholarship in 1973 to continue Manipuri dance with Guru Singhajit Singh at Triveni Kala Sangam, New Delhi. With extension and renewal of the Fulbright to 1975, she also trained in Mayurbhanj Chhau under Guru Krushna Chandra Naik, Odissi under Guru kelucharan Mohapatra, Manipuri Pala Cholam under Guru Thangjam Chaoba Singh and Manipuri Maibi Jagoi under Gurus Ranjana Maibi, Kumar Maibi and R.K. Achoubi Sana Singh.\n\nSharon has dedicated her life to presenting and promoting excellence in Indian performing arts. Sharon is hailed today as one of the leading international performing artists of three forms of Indian dance: Odissi, Chhau and Manipuri. Sharon has made her home in India since 1973 to dedicate herself to her work as an artist and to promote education in the arts.\n\nHer accomplishment is in a land where foreign exponents of indigenous dance forms are rarely taken seriously. Once Lowen came to India 46 years ago and devoted herself to Indian classical dance, her tenacity and perfectionism have earned the respect of audiences and critics alike in her adopted country.\n\nShe portrayed a herself in Indian Cinema, in a Telugu film Swarnakamalam. The film was directed by Dr.K.Viswanath. In the film she performs an Odissi dance and mesmerizes the audience of the film.\n\nThe noted Odissi danseuse has assimilated and internalised Indian art and culture to the extent that she is more Indian than many of us. During the last 46 years, she has brought out the exquisite grace of Odissi through her performances in India and abroad. … Abhinaya is her strength, and she performs Odissi without altering even an iota of its form or style. Odissi is considered a sensuous style because of its emphasis upon rounded movements. Miss Lowen conveyed this sensuousness by her entrance in her opening solo of invocation.\n\nOdissi dancer Sharon Lowen mesmerized (the) audience … Ludhiana Sanskritik Samagam. \nShe has served as a visiting professor in various Indian and US universities and presented several lecture-demonstrations at universities, schools, museums and art centres.\n\nShe not only teaches Odissi but also conducts workshops in Chhau and Manipuri dance. She is the first woman soloist of a previously all-male form, responsible for introducing Mayurbhanj Chhau to the United States at the 1978 Asian Dance Festival in Hawaii and later at the Olympic Arts Festival of Masks in Los Angeles and is singularly responsible for getting Chhau presented on Doordarshan' s National Broadcasts.\n\nSharon Lowen has had an immense impact on Chhau and has promoted its inclusion in arts education, both at national and international levels. She is responsible for introducing Mayurbhanj Chhau to the United States at the 1978 Asian Dance Festival in Hawaii and later at the Olympic Arts Festival of Masks in Los Angeles and also its presentation on Indian national television broadcasts. Sharon Lowen has been responsible in making Chhau popular in the West, which is making a difference in the awareness of the local history in the regions of Seraikela.\n\nGuru Krushna Chandra Naik, Sharon Lowen, Guru Ramani Ranjan Mohanta are some of the big names associated with Mayurbhanj Chhau dance. They have made Chhau dance popular throughout the world.\n\n“Sharon has a mature technique and a fine understanding of the sort of physical and emotional restraint that characterizes Manipuri.” Ref 37: Shanta Serbjeet Singh, “Young American Dancers,” The Hindustan Times (April 22, 1978) from p. 157 The great encounter: a study of Indo-American literature and cultural relations,Raj Kumar Gupta - 1986 - History - 276 pages\n\nShe has also choreographed and performed Odissi dance in Telugu, Bengali, Malayalam, Tamil, Hindi as well as Sanskrit and Oriya for performances and festivals around India, Doordarshan National Indian Television, and internationally .\n\n"}

It contains two essays: \"My Dungeon Shook — Letter to my Nephew on the One Hundredth Anniversary of the Emancipation\" and \"Down At The Cross — Letter from a Region of My Mind\". The first essay, written in the form of a letter to Baldwin's 14-year-old nephew, discusses the central role of race in American history. The second essay deals with the relations between race and religion, focusing in particular on Baldwin's experiences with the Christian church as a youth, as well as the Islamic ideas of others in Harlem.\n\nThe book was first published in \"The New Yorker\" and owing to its great success, it was subsequently published in book form by Dial Press in 1963, and in Britain by Penguin Books in 1964; both essays in the book had previously been published in \"The Progressive\" and \"The New Yorker\", respectively. Critics greeted the book enthusiastically. It is considered, by some, one of the most influential books about race relations in the 1960s. It was released in an audiobook format in 2008, narrated by Jesse L. Martin.\n\nThe book's title comes from a couplet in \"Mary Don't You Weep\", a Negro spiritual: \n\n<poem style=\"margin-left: 2em;\">God gave Noah the rainbow sign\nNo more water, the fire next time</poem>\n\nThe book includes two essays that were written in the 1960s during a time of segregation between White and Black Americans.\n\nThe first essay is a letter to Baldwin’s nephew, where he compares his nephew to the men in their family including Baldwin’s brother and father. He tells his nephew about America’s ability to destroy Black men and challenges his nephew to convert his anger due to mistreatment as a Black man into having a passionate and broad outlook on the Negro experience.\n\nThe second essay addresses the detriment of Christianity on the Black community and how Baldwin’s journey of being a teen pastor to completely pulling away from the church because it felt like a repression of his full experience of humanity. He then recounts his dinner with Elijah Muhammad where Muhammad educated Baldwin on the Nation of Islam in hopes to get him to join that movement. In this section Baldwin describes how Black Muslims have made a \"black god\" to avoid the oppression of a \"white god\" that Christianity has established within the Black community.\n\nJacquelyn Dowd Hall wrote an article that focused on the civil rights movement, led by Martin Luther King, building on Baldwin's work. Baldwin's piece examined the issue of racism mainly in his area of Harlem, New York, and Hall emphasized that the racial issue they confronted in America was not a sectional but a national problem.\n\nAnother article that expands on Baldwin's new religious view was written by Jon Nilson, a theology professor. In \"The Fire Next Time\", Baldwin focused on how Christianity was corrupted. Observing that Baldwin challenged the Catholic Church, Nilson said that when Martin Luther King was assassinated in April 1968, it almost seemed like \"The Fire Next Time\" had come true.\n\nIn December 2016, \"Can I Get a Witness? The Gospel of James Baldwin\", a 2016 musical theatrical tribute to Baldwin by the musician Meshell Ndegeocello and based on \"The Fire Next Time\" was premiered at the Harlem Stage in Harlem.\n\nIn July 2015, Ta-Nehisi Coates wrote an article on \"The Atlantic\" as a modernized version of Baldwin's letter to his nephew called \"Letter to My Son\", and later published an entire book called \"Between the World and Me\" that talks about the current state of the Black experience in America.\n\n\n"}

It elected one Member of Parliament (MP).\n\nThere was also, 1708 to 1918, the Inverness-shire constituency, which was, as its name implies, a county constituency.\n\nThe British parliamentary constituency was created in 1708 following the Acts of Union, 1707 and replaced the former Parliament of Scotland burgh constituencies of Inverness, Forres, Fortrose and Nairn.\n\nAs first used in the 1708 general election Inverness Burghs consisted of four burghs: Inverness in the county of Inverness, Fortrose in the county of Ross, Forres in the county of Elgin and Nairn in the county of Nairn.\n\nThe constituency elected one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system until the seat was abolished for the 1918 general election.\n\nFor the 1832 general election, as a result of the Representation of the People (Scotland) Act 1832, the boundaries of burghs for parliamentary election purposes ceased to be necessarily those for other purposes.\n\nIn 1918, as a result of the Representation of the People Act 1918, the component burghs of Inverness Burghs were merged into three different county constituencies: Inverness into the Inverness constituency, Forres and Nairn into the Moray and Nairn constituency and Fortrose into the Ross and Cromarty constituency. By this date, the county of Elgin had become the county of Moray and the county of Ross had been merged with the county of Cromarty to form the county of Ross and Cromarty.\n\nThe original electoral system for this constituency gave each of the four burghs one vote, with an additional casting vote (to break ties) for the burgh where the election was held. The place of election rotated amongst the burghs in successive Parliaments. The vote of a burgh was exercised by a burgh commissioner, who was elected by the burgh councillors.\n\nThe first direct election in Inverness Burghs was in 1832. The votes from qualified electors, in each burgh, were added together to establish the result.\n\nUnless otherwise indicated, the primary source for the results was Craig. Candidates identified by Craig as Conservatives, in the 1832-1835 Parliament, are listed as Tories. In results for elections before the formal creation of the Liberal Party, shortly after the 1859 general election, candidates identified by Craig as Liberals are divided into Whigs and Radicals following Stooks Smith. Craig's registered electorate and vote figures are sometimes different from those of Stooks Smith, but Craig's figures are used below. For details of the books of Craig and Stooks Smith, see the Reference section below.\n\nIn terms of change in % votes and swing, the Conservative candidate in 1835 is related to his performance as the Tory candidate in the 1833 by-election. As there were two Tory candidates in 1832, no swing figure was calculated for the 1833 by-election.\n\nThis is an example of a contested election, before the extension of the franchise in 1832. The election took place in Fortrose, so that burgh's commissioner had the casting vote which decided the election.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Although the scent is generally described as pleasant, there is some question about the possibility that these chemicals pose a health risk.\n\nBoth the scent and what produces it vary somewhat in different kinds of cars. Most of the interior of an automobile consists of plastic held together with a number of adhesives and sealers. Such materials release volatile organic compounds, via outgassing or offgassing. These fumes are generally attributed mixtures of many different chemicals offgassing and to plasticizers, although their vapor pressures are very low and they are not considered volatile.\n\nResearchers tested more than 200 U.S. vehicles of model years 2011–2012 for chemicals such as organobromine compounds (associated with brominated flame retardants, or BFRs), organochlorine compounds (e.g., polyvinyl chloride, or PVC), and heavy metals that off-gas from various parts such as the steering wheel, dashboard, armrests and seats.\n\nSome recommend keeping new cars well ventilated while driving, especially during the summer. A 1995 analysis of the air from a new Lincoln Continental found over 50 volatile organic compounds, which were identified as coming from sources such as cleaning and lubricating compounds, paint, carpeting, leather and vinyl treatments, latex glue, and gasoline and exhaust fumes. An analysis two months after the initial one found a significant reduction in the chemicals. The researchers observed that the potential toxicity of many of these compounds could pose a danger to human health.\n\nThe total volatile organic compound levels can reach 7,500 micrograms per cubic meter. Concentrations decayed approximately 90% over a three-week period. Over sixty chemical compounds were identified inside the interiors of the four vehicles in this study.\n\nIn some instances the odor results from a manufacturing defect. According to official documents of Bentley Motors (BT26), an \"obnoxious odor\" in Bentley cars for model years 1999–2002 was traced to a rust inhibitor. In some cultures, the new car smell is not considered desirable and manufacturers work to eliminate it.\n\nA two-year study released in 2001 by the CSIRO in Australia found several health problems associated with these chemicals. CSIRO research scientist, Dr Stephen Brown, reported anecdotal accounts of disorientation, headache, and irritation in some drivers of new cars. He measured pollutant levels in new cars that were sufficient to cause similar effects within minutes in controlled experiments by other researchers. Chemicals found in the cars included the carcinogen benzene, two other possible carcinogens cyclohexanone and styrene, and several other toxic chemicals.\n\nA more recent study in Japan found that the volatile organic chemicals in a new minivan were over 35 times the health limit the day after its delivery. In four months levels had fallen under the limit but increased again in the hot summer months, taking three years to permanently remain below the limit. The limits were set by the Japanese health ministry in response to more car owners suffering from sick building syndrome. A \"Daily Telegraph\" article on the study described the enjoyment of new car smell as \"akin to glue-sniffing\".\n\nYet another study showed little toxicity in new car odors.\n"}

Its mountainous and heavily forested geography allowed the Caribs to defend against European settlement here longer than on almost any other island in the Caribbean.\n\nAfter the Caribs were defeated on other islands they joined slaves who had escaped repression on Barbados by following the current and trade winds westward to St. Vincent, as well as those who had survived shipwrecks near St. Vincent and Bequia.\n\nThe mixed descendants of the island warriors and the freed Africans, who became known as the Black Caribs, had a common distrust and disgust for the Europeans, and proved to be a fearsome foe. The Caribs feared complete domination so they allowed the French to construct a settlement on the island in 1719. The French brought slaves to work their plantations. By 1748, the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle officially declared St. Vincent and its surrounding islands to be a neutral island, controlled by neither Britain nor France. The two countries continued to contest control of the islands, however, until they were definitively ceded to the British in 1814.\n\nIn 1951 universal adult suffrage was introduced in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and in 1979, it became an independent state within the British Commonwealth with a democratic government based on the British system.\n\nThe average daytime temperatures range from . The driest season is from December to May. The coolest months are between November and February.\n\nIn the early 1990s the Canouan Resorts Development Ltd (CRD) company was formed and secured lease for areas of the island to build 2 hotels - the former Raffles Resort site and Tamarind Beach Hotel site. At this point the building arm of CRD Ltd. Built roads throughout Canouan (previously only dirt tracks), installed electricity to the island and residents houses and provided desalinated water for the first time. Prior to that, fresh water was brought by boat from St. Vincent on a regular basis. Locals not employed by the resort were forbidden admittance to the property as it was private property, although the beaches remained open for public use. It was announced that the resort would revert from Raffles/Fairmont Resorts back to Carenage Bay Resort on May 20, 2010. The Raffles property was torn down afterwards and a new resort was opened in 2016, which since 2018 has been managed by Mandarin Oriental.\n\nThere are 2 schools on Canouan - the Government Primary school and the independent Pelican School which is an accredited Cambridge International School. There is also an official Canouan Pre-school located close to the primary school.\n\nIn 2008, the runway at Canouan Airport was lengthened to almost 6,000 feet to accommodate larger aircraft. It is now the jet port for the Grenadines.\n\nScheduled ferries link Canouan to St. Vincent, Union Island and Mayreau.\n\nNBA player and political activist Adonal Foyle hails from Canouan, and former Prime Minister of St. Lucia Sir John Compton was born there.\n\n\n"}

The player controls Clarice in her Honda City hatchback and must paint every section of a highway throughout twelve stages, each taking place in a famous city from around the world. Clarice is constantly under pursuit by police cars, which she can take out by launching oil cans at them, temporarily stunning them, and then ramming into them with her car. It was released in North America by Kitkorp as \"Cruisin\"'.\n\nJaleco would port the game to the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) and MSX. The NES release received mixed to positive reviews, although digital re-releases would receive a more negative reception. The NES release would be included in \"Jaleco Collection Vol. 1\" in 2003 and in \"JaJaMaru Jr. Denshoki Jaleco Memorial\" a year later. Hamster Corporation released a digital version on the Wii Virtual Console in 2008 and the PlayStation 4 in 2015, the latter under their \"Arcade Archives\" label. The rights to \"City Connection\" are currently owned by a company named after such, City Connection, following the bankruptcy of Jaleco's parent company in 2014. A mobile phone sequel, \"City Connection Rocket\", was available through i-mode in 2004.\n\nThe player takes control of Clarice, a blue-haired teen in her Honda City hatchback, in her efforts to travel the world in order to find herself the perfect man. Clarice traverses through twelve scrolling stages, all based on famous locations across the world (including Japan, China, Paris and Easter Island). After the twelfth stage, the game will simply loop back to the first at a higher difficulty. To clear each stage, the player must paint over all the roads by driving across them, changing the pavement color from white to green. The car can jump over large gaps to reach higher sections of the stage.\n\nClarice is constantly under pursuit by police cars, and must avoid flag-waving cats that will block her from moving past them. By collecting oil cans found in each stage, the player can shoot these at police cars to temporary stun them, and knock them off the stage by ramming into them. Cats are invulnerable and cannot be defeated by any means. If the player remains on the same stage for an extended period of time, spikes will extrude from the ground, instantly causing them to lose a life. On occasion, a red-colored balloon may appear in the stage. Should the player collect three of these balloons, they will be warped to a new area and be granted with a large sum of bonus points.\n\n\"City Connection\" was developed by Jaleco and first released in Japanese arcades in July 1985. The car the player controls is a Honda City hatchback, which is believed to be the source for the game's title. In North America, the game was licensed to Kitkorp and released as\" Cruisin’\", though is identical to the original aside from the title. The song used when Clarice hits one of the flag-waving cats is “Flohwalzer”, known in Japan as “Neko Funjatta” (lit. “I Stepped on the Cat”). The game is one of the first to use a new music track for each stage rather than reusing a single song. One stage features a remix of the song “Highway Star” by Deep Purple.\n\nPorts of \"City Connection\" were released for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), Famicom, ZX Spectrum and MSX. The NES version replaces Clarice with an unnamed male protagonist, alongside other minor differences. The Famicom release was included in the Japan-only PlayStation compilation \"Jaleco Collection Vol. 1\" in 2003, as well as the Game Boy Advance compilation \"JaJaMaru Jr. Denshoki Jaleco Memorial\" a year later. A digital re-release of the NES version was ported to the Wii Virtual Console in 2008 and later the 3DS and Wii U Virtual Console services in 2013. A mobile phone version was released on 23 September 2002. The arcade version was ported by Mediakite to Microsoft Windows in 2003, published first by PCCW Japan then later re-published in 2004 by Jaleco. A 2003 mobile port, titled \"City Connection DX\", was released for the Japanese i-mode online service. In 2014, Hamster Corporation released a digital version of the game under their \"Arcade Archives\" series on the PlayStation 4, which was soon released on the Nintendo Switch in 2018.\n\nThe NES version in particular would receive a mixed reception. \"AllGame\" gave a positive review for the NES release, applauding its gameplay and graphics, concluding with “while this game is not revolutionary by any means, it deserves to be played.”. Japanese magazine \"Yuge\" ranked it as one of the 100 best Family Computer games of all time, praising the visuals, gameplay and music. \"Computer Entertainer US\" concluded that the game is \"enjoyable in the short run, but we doubt that it has sufficient staying power to keep most gamers playing it over and over again.\n\nReviewing the Nintendo 3DS Virtual Console digital release of the NES version, \"Nintendo Life\" and \"IGN\" would give a lukewarm reception - both would critcize its graphics and music for being too simplistic, alongside labeling its gameplay as difficult to understand for newcomers. \"Nintendo Life\" gave a similar negative response to the Wii U Virtual Console port of the NES release, concluding with \"Steer clear of this one.\" \"Eurogamer\" wrote that the Wii Virtual Console port of the NES version was “certainly not worth getting passionate about\".\n\nA sequel, \"City Connection Rocket\", was developed by Studio Runba and released for Japanese mobile phones in 2004, available from Jaleco through i-mode. The game places Clarice as a spy for a secret organization to capture criminal leaders from around the world. Rather than painting sections of the road, Clarice must now collect briefcases placed in each stage whilst avoiding police cars and other types of enemies. This game was bundled with \"City Connection DX\" for a re-release under the \"Appli-Archives\" series for the PlayStation Vita, available for the PlayStation Mobile service. The service closed in September 2015, delisting the game from the PlayStation Store and other supported devices.\n\nClarice would make an appearance as a playable character in \"GUNbare!

The parish has a population of 740. The parish includes the nearby hamlet of Hare.\n\nIn the Domesday Book of 1086, the village was known as \"Bradewei\" and located in ancient hundred of Abdick.\n\nBy the 14th century, Broadway was part of the hundred of Abdick and Bulstone. Broadway was known as \"Brodewaye\" in 1586.\n\nEverys Almhouses date from the late 16th or early 17th century. They were founded after litigation over the 1558 will of Alexander Every.\n\nThe Tudor Cottage on Broadway Street was built as a farmhouse in the 16th century.\n\nThe parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council's operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council.\n\nThe village falls within the Non-metropolitan district of South Somerset, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, having previously been part of Chard Rural District. The district council is responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism.\n\nSomerset County Council is responsible for running the largest and most expensive local services such as education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, policing and fire services, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning.\n\nThe village is in the 'Neroche' electoral ward. This ward stretches from Ashill in the north, through \"Broadway\" to Donyatt in the south. The total population taken at the 2011 census was 2,428.\n\nIt is also part of the Yeovil county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election, and part of the South West England constituency of the European Parliament which elects seven MEPs using the d'Hondt method of party-list proportional representation.\n\nThe Church of St. Aldhelm and St. Eadburgha dates from the 13th century, and has been designated by English Heritage as a grade I listed building. Its isolated position away from the village is thought to be because of an outbreak of the plague. The churchyard cross is also from the 13th century.\n"}
{"id": "2201701", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2201701", "title": "Bequia", "text": "Bequia\n\nBequia ( or ) is the second-largest island in the Grenadines at . It is part of the country of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and is approximately from the nation's capital, Kingstown, on the main island, Saint Vincent. Bequia means \"island of the clouds\" in the ancient Arawak. The island's name was also 'Becouya' as part of the Grenadines.\n\nBequia is a small island, measuring with a population of approximately 5,300. The native population are primarily a mixture of people of African, Scottish and Island Carib descent. A substantial number of white Barbadians also settled the Mount Pleasant area of Bequia in the 1860s. Many of their descendants still inhabit the area. Other highly populated areas include the island capital, Port Elizabeth, which hosts the ferry terminal and Paget Farm, which hosts the airport. There are also villages at Lower Bay, La Pompe, Hamilton and Belmont. Other prominent areas of Bequia include Spring, the site of a former coconut plantation and home to agricultural animals, Industry Bay and Park Bay, where the Old Hegg Turtle Sanctuary is located.\n\nThe island's hills are much lower than the peaks of St. Vincent, to the north, so they do not receive as many rain showers.\n\nPrincess Margaret, who had a home on nearby Mustique, visited Bequia in the 1950s and had a beach renamed in her honour.\n\"Princess Margaret Beach\" is next to Port Elizabeth and is situated inside Admiralty Bay on the west coast.\nThe beach was originally known as \"Tony Gibbons\", and continues to be known by that name locally, though the origin of this name is uncertain.\nAlso on the west coast are the island's main port and a large natural harbour. \n\nBequia is popular among cruising yachts, expats and tourists. One of the busiest times of the year is the annual Easter Regatta and Music Fest.\n\nTwo scuba diving stores run dive trips to 28 identified dive sites around Bequia. There are several wrecks and shallow caves accessible to advanced divers. It is not unusual to see Hawksbill turtles, lobsters, moray eels and many kinds of fish when diving around Bequia.\n\nAs a result of the Treaty of Utrecht, which brought an end to the War of Spanish Succession and established peace between the Spanish and British Empires, Great Britain obtained the lucrative monopoly over the Asiento slave trade. Runaway and shipwrecked slaves inhabited the island of St. Vincent in the 17th century. According to an early account of the French West Indies, which considered Bequia as part of Grenada, Bequia was too inaccessible to colonize and Caribs and Arawaks used the island for fishing and farming. A few Portuguese and Dutch slave ships en route to Sint Eustatius from West Africa reportedly shipwrecked on the Grenadine reefs.\n\nBequia was under French control in the 18th century and during the Seven Years' War with England, the island was used by the fleets of their Spanish and Dutch allies to take on supplies, while British ships were banned. The 1763 Treaty of Paris produced a significant re-alignment in the map of the Caribbean; St. Vincent and the Grenadine islands, including Grenada, were given to the British in exchange for Guadeloupe, Martinique and St. Lucia. The name \"Petit Martinique\" comes from this era, as does Petit Saint Vincent. In 1779 the French seized the island, despite the treaty, but were forced to relinquish control to Britain again soon after.\n\nThe early 18th century saw the development of a sugar industry and the production of related products including molasses and rum. Other major produce included coffee, indigo and arrowroot. At one point in time, the islands of St. Vincent and the Grenadines were the single largest producer of arrowroot starch in the world. Currently, Hairoun and Vincy strong rum are major export products primarily to the European Union.\n\nUnder a programme instituted by Great Britain to give land to indigent settlers, James Hamilton, father of Alexander Hamilton, moved from St. Croix to Bequia in 1774 where he remained until 1790. The land granted to Hamilton lies along the shore of Southeast Bay. Despite his son's frequent gifts of money and entreaties to immigrate or at least visit him, neither visited the other.\n\nSome historians believe that the famous pirate Edward Teach had his base in Bequia. The opening shot of the movie \"Blackbeard, Pirate of the Caribbean\", made by the BBC, displays a replica of his first ship off the coast of Bequia in the St. Vincent passage. According to local legend, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines was not only Teach's base, but also the place from which Sir Francis Drake planned his attacks on the Spanish admiralty in Don Blas de Lezo's Cartagena. Indeed, it is thought that Henry Morgan may also have anchored in Admiralty Bay, as it was then the safest natural harbour in the Eastern Caribbean during hurricane season. Bequia was used as a repair facility for ships. Beside Nelson's Dockyard on Antigua, and the Carlyle in Bridgetown, Barbados, there were no other drydocks or shipyards in the area. Wooden shipbuilding and ship-repair on Bequia was possible due to the presence of cedar trees on the island and a sufficiently deep and sheltered harbour.\n\nBequia is one of the few places in the world where limited whaling is still allowed. The International Whaling Commission (IWC) classifies the island's hunt under the regulations concerning aboriginal whaling. Natives of Bequia are allowed to catch up to four humpback whales per year using only traditional hunting methods of hand-thrown harpoons in small, open sailboats. The limit is rarely met, with no catch some years. Bequia has a long tradition of whaling as well as the building of whaling boats.\n\nIn the 2012 meeting of the IWC, the delegates renewed the annual quota of whales for all three groups who submitted joint bids: Alaskan Inupiat, Russian indigenous people in Chukotka in eastern Siberia, and St Vincent and the Grenadines, despite protestations of delegates from Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Chile, and Costa Rica. Dominican Republic delegate Peter Sanchez said the St Vincent and the Grenadines hunt was \"artisanal whaling out of control,\" and that the hunters have \"repeatedly broken the rules—hunting for young ones and pregnant females.\" Other delegates pointed out that St. Vincent and the Grenadines' bid \"should not qualify under ASW [Aboriginal Subsistence Whaling] rules because the Bequians, the group that maintains the hunt, are not truly indigenous.\" Monaco delegate Frederic Briand argued that whaling \"started by a settler's family as recently as 1875 does not qualify as 'aboriginal'.\" Louise Mitchell Joseph, speaking on behalf of the Eastern Caribbean Coalition of Environmental Awareness stated that there was no documented history of whaling in the islands, and that \"there have been many archaeological excavations conducted, and there was no evidence found whatsoever of whale hunting by aboriginal peoples. Neither whale remains nor weapons that could have been used to kill such a large mammals were ever found; neither are any images of whales inscribed on our petroglyphs.\"\n\nThere is a small whaling museum on the island chronicling local whaling's history. A feature of the Port Elizabeth waterfront is the Whale Boner Bar & Restaurant. This bar has an entrance onto the beach consisting of an arch of two whale ribs, as well as whale vertebrae mounted on the bar seats and a whale rib running the length of the bar.\n\nErected in 1992, the James F. Mitchell International Airport for small planes is located near Paget Farm. With a runway length of , Bequia can be reached by plane with daily connections from Kingstown, Bridgetown and surrounding islands.\n\nRegularly scheduled ferries run from the main island of Saint Vincent. Three ferries operate between the capital, Kingstown, and the local port of Port Elizabeth. The other islands in the Grenadines can be reached by the last operational schooner in the Caribbean, the antique original Bequia-built SS \"Friendship Rose\", as well as other charter/tour boats that are widely available and based in Port Elizabeth, islands for matches. The ferry offers daytime as well as overnight charters, and onboard picnics are locally renowned. This has resulted in significant increases in mostly domestic tourism.\n\nThe ferry pier is located 45 minutes' drive from Argyle International Airport and is served by two companies, Bequia Express and Admiralty Transport. Bequia Express uses a family-owned ferry that is long with a cargo space measuring of which is sheltered with a ceiling. The approximate capacity of the ship is 28 cars or 10 to 20 containers and is licensed for 400 passengers. The \"Admiral II\" is a similarly-sized vessel with a capacity for 250 passengers. Travellers on the \"Admiral II\" have a choice between air-conditioned indoor seating or covered outdoor seating. The passage between Kingstown and Port Elizabeth is a trip taking approximately one hour.\n\nPedestrians such as hitchhikers and backpackers have the option of the Grenadines mail boat which travels to Port Elizabeth at irregular intervals. The mail boat calls at Canouan, Mayreau and Union islands although boarding at Mayreau can be difficult, as the vessel remains in deeper waters, with passengers being required to embark and leave through the use of smaller craft, which land on the nearby beach.\n\nThe island has a variety of communication systems including standard telephone and fax lines, a mobile network, and internet access. The old telex system still operates. Bequia has its own heavy-duty, long-range shortwave radio antenna. Many inhabitants use the marine VHF radio system on channel 68 for local communication.\n\nConsidering the size of the island, Bequia has a large publications industry. Various publishers, editors, and writers work on the island, as do painters and graphic designers.\n\n\nNotes\nBibliography\n"}

However, by 1892 the boundaries of the county had been redefined for all purposes except parliamentary representation, and it had become a local government area, under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1889. 26 years were to elapse before a review of constituency boundaries took account of new local government boundaries. Results of the review were implemented under the Representation of the People Act 1918.\n\nIn 1918, the constituency was largely replaced by two new county constituencies. The Western Isles constituency was created to cover Outer Hebridean areas of the county of Inverness, as well as part of the county of Ross and Cromarty. The Inverness constituency was created to cover the rest of the county of Inverness, including the parliamentary burgh.\n\nThe original electorate for this constituency was limited to substantial landowners. The 40 shilling freehold qualification used for English county constituencies, which was not adjusted for inflation since it was first set in the 15th century, was significantly lower than the Scottish county qualification. In Scotland the qualification was land worth 40 shillings \"of old extent\", which prevented inflation lowering the real value of the property qualification required.\n\nThe county electorate, in Scotland, was significantly extended in 1832 and was further expanded in 1868 and 1885. The change, before and after 1832, can be seen by comparing the 32 votes cast at the contested election in 1802 with the 467 votes cast in 1832 (when the new registration system recorded a registered electorate of 669).\n\nUnless otherwise indicated, the primary source for the results listed was Craig. Candidates identified by Craig as Conservatives, in the 1832-1835 Parliament, are listed as Tories. In elections before the formal creation of the Liberal Party, shortly after the 1859 general election, candidates identified by Craig as Liberals are classified as Whigs. There were no Radicals candidates in this seat, according to Stooks Smith. Craig's registered electorate and vote figures are sometimes different from those of Stooks Smith, but Craig's figures are used below. For details of the books of Craig and Stooks Smith, see the Reference section below.\n\nThe calculations of change in % vote and swing, for the 1835 general election result, relate the performance of the Conservative candidate to his achievements as the Tory candidate in the 1832 general election.\n\nGrant was appointed as President of the Board of Control, requiring a by-election.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2201706", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2201706", "title": "Chingay parade", "text": "Chingay parade\n\nThe Chingay Parade is an annual street parade held in Malaysia and Singapore in celebration with the birthdays of the Chinese deities or the procession of the Goddess of Mercy (Guanyin) as part of the Chinese New Year festivities. The term Chingay itself originated from the Chinese communities of Southeast Asia, which is a phonetic equivalent of both the Chinese words \"真艺\" (\"zhēnyì\") which means \"true art\" in the Penang version, and \"妆艺,\" (\"zhuāngyì\") which means \"a decorated miniature stage\" or float in the Singapore version. PAYM (People's Association Youth Movement) has been an active contributor to chingay in Singapore. Today the parade is celebrated by all communities of both Malaysia and Singapore.\n\nChingay procession was held in celebration with the birthdays of the Chinese deities or the procession of the Goddess of Mercy (Guanyin). It was held to worship and enjoy with the deity. During the earliest procession in more than 100 years ago, the earliest English newspapers Echo in Malaysia adopted the word Chingay Procession for this special event.\n\nChingay originated from China, and the Penang Chinese first performed Chingay during deity processions. It is a street art where the performer balances a giant flag that ranges from in height and about in weight.\n\nToday, in Malaysia and Singapore, Chingay is not only performed by the Chinese, but the art has successfully attracted the Malays and Indians. It has become a unique multiracial performance. The popularity of Chingay in Penang has made it one of the very impressive cultural landmarks as well as an important tourist attraction.\n\nChingay parade has been declared a National Cultural Heritage in 2012.\n\nThe Chingay Parade traces its origins to a float decorating competition held in Penang in 1905. This practice of float decoration spread to the rest of Malaya by the 1960s, and eventually became associated with the Chinese New Year.\n\nThe second Chingay procession was held in 1926 in celebration of the birthday of the God of Prosperity. The third Chingay procession was held in 1957 to celebrate the centenary of the City Council of George Town.\n\nIn the pursuit of ensuring the perpetual existence of Chingay, Chinese community in Malaysia worked hand in hand to call for the enthusiasts of various areas in forming the liaison committee of Penang Chingay in 1960s.\n\nA Chingay parade is now held annually within the city of George Town every December. The yearly event, which has attracted locals and tourists alike, starts in the evening from Brick Kiln Road (now Gurdwara Road), snaking through the city streets before ending at the Esplanade.\n\nThe Chingay parade in Johor are held annually by the Johor Bahru Old Chinese Temple on the 21st day of the first month of the Lunar New Year since the 1870.It is joined by the five main clans in the state, which are Cantonese, Hainanese, Hakka, Hoklo and Teochew.\n\nOn 4 February 1973, the first Singapore Chingay parade was held partly as a result of the ban on firecrackers a year earlier in 1972 as a result of fire hazards. This ban was viewed unfavourably despite the safety issues involved. Some people felt that the ban would result in a much dampened festival mood for the Chinese New Year period. To address this issue, the People's Association and the Singapore National Pugilistic Association jointly organised a street parade from Jalan Besar to Outram Park featuring the signature floats, acrobatic acts, lion and dragon dances, stilt walkers, and the like, to bring back some cheer to the general public.\n\nThe largely Chinese parade became a multi-cultural one from 1977 when Malay and Indian groups started joining in the performances, which was to mark a major precedent in the overall flavour of the parade into one which has become largely multi-cultural in character, despite the continued presence of traditional Chinese acts such as lion dances and stilt walkers to this day.\n\nIn 1985, the parade marched down Orchard Road for the first time, a move which was to prevail for much of the parade's subsequent history. Although the change could be attributed to the desire of organisers in bringing it closer to tourists along the major tourist belt and for ease of organisation on a relatively long and straight stretch of road, it also further signified the increasingly desinicized character of the parade. This is further evidenced when in 1987, an international flavour was added to the parade when a group from Japan participated for the first time with their float sponsored by The Straits Times.\n\nThe Chingay Parade became an evening-to-night parade in 1990, changing the overall feel of the parade towards one in which lights and pyrotechnics dominate. In 2000, the parade was shifted out of Orchard Road to the Civic District centering at City Hall, an area steeped in Singaporean history and culture. Construction works at the City Hall area resulted in the parade marching through the streets of the Chinatown district for the first time. Faced with limited space for spectator stands and a much more complicated and winding route in these locations, however, the parade moved back to Orchard Road in 2004 along with an effort to introduce audience participation and involvement in the traditionally passive parade. Firecrackers were let off for the first time in the parade that year. Despite the authorities allowing the firecrackers to be let off under some safety procedures, it was decided that the Chingay be preserved. In 2008, the parade was once again held at City Hall, with the route lasting from the City Hall building to The Esplanade. For the 2009 parade, it was centralised around Parliament House with the performers going around the Padang and also featured a magical Grand Finale (MAGICBOX@Chingay 2009). That year was also the first year that the telecast on television was delayed by one day. In 2010, the parade took place on part of the Formula One Marina Bay Street Circuit route.\n\nPost-parade street parties have been held since 2004, with the exception of 2007. An estimated 150,000 spectators attended the 2009 Chingay Parade on 1 February. One million Singaporeans watched the parade on television and another 16.3 million homes and hotels across Asia received the television broadcast through Channel NewsAsia.\n\nThe 2011 Chingay Parade was held on the 11 and 12 February. It opened with a Fire Party, and included the largest moving multi-ethnic performances, the first travelling dance competition within the parade, a spectacular finale where thousands of performers flooded the parade ground holding candle lights and an inaugural colourful Arts District/ Carnival. It also included activities in which the public could participate, such as the Teresa Teng Look-Alike Photo Contest and the Chingay Paparazzi competition.\n\nThe 2013 Chingay parade was held on 22 and 23 February. In 2014, Chingay was held on 7 and 8 February at the F1 Pit Building. Some 70,000 individuals ushered in The Year of the Horse.\n\nThe 2015 Chingay was planned to involve some 11,000 performers from 150 organisations, including 760 overseas performers from 15 groups, in the largest celebration yet. Themed \"We love Singapore(SG)\", the main Chingay 2015 was planned to be held at the F1 Pit Building on February 27 and 28, while a street party along Orchard Road involving youths would be held on 1 March.\n\nThe 2018 Chingay involved 2,000 parade volunteers and 6,500 parade performers, and also featured many examples of smart technology, including dancing robots and driverless cars. The 2018 Chingay was the first year to have a free street parade and carnival as part of the celebration, and followed a 1.5 kilometre route, double the length of the usual 720 metres.\n\nThe 2019 Chingay was purposed to commemorate Singapore's Bicentennial such that understanding of the island nation's history expanded beyond marking 200 years of Sir Stamford Raffles' arrival on the shores of Singapore in 1819 to a beginning that was even earlier at 1299 when the Kingdom of Singapura (also known as Temasek) was established. The theme for Chingay 2019, ‘Dreams Funtasia’, recognised the significance of the past, present and future of Singapore.\n\n"}

Records are accessed based on their ordinal position in the file (\"relative record number\", RRN). For example, the desired record to be accessed might be the 42nd record in the file out of 999 total.\n\nThe concept of RRDS is similar to sequential access method, but it can access with data in random access and dynamic access.\n\nAn RRDS consists of data records in sequence, with the record number indicating the record's logical position in the data set. A program can access records randomly using this positional number or access records sequentially. But unlike a Key Sequenced Data Set, an RRDS has no keys, so the program cannot access records by key value.\n\nKeys may be used to access records in an RRDS by defining an alternate index.\n\n\n"}

It is one of eight public high schools in Craighead County, and is the sole high school of the Jonesboro Public Schools.\n\nJonesboro High School was founded in 1899 and is accredited by the Arkansas Department of Education (ADE). Since 1924, Jonesboro High School has been a charter member accredited by AdvancED (formerly the North Central Association (NCA) Commission on Accreditation and School Improvement (CASI).\n\nThe assumed course of study follows the ADE Smart Core curriculum, which requires students complete at least 22 units prior to graduation. Students complete regular (core and career focus) courses and exams and may select Advanced Placement (AP) coursework and exams that provide an opportunity to receive college credit prior to high school graduation.\n\nAs of 2011–12, JHS offers the followingAP) courses: Art History, Biology, Calculus AB, Chemistry, English Language and Composition, English Literature and Composition, Government & Politics, Spanish, Statistics, Studio Art, U.S. History, and World History. The school has been recognized by the Siemens Foundation for their AP program.\n\nAs of 2013, Jonesboro High School is referred to as \"The Academies at Jonesboro High School\". Academy-based JHS splits students into one of three academies: Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM), Health and Human Services (HHS) or Business, Communication Arts and Law (BCAL).\n\nIn 1982–1983, Jonesboro High School was recognized as a National Blue Ribbon School of Excellence by the U.S. Department of Education, one of only six high schools in the state ever to be awarded this honor.\n\nJonesboro ranked No. 1,126 of 2,008 high schools in the 2012 \"Challenge Index\" high school scoring system with an index score of 1.828, which is the number of college-level tests given at a school in 2011 divided by the number of graduates that year. For the previous year (2011), Jonesboro was ranked No. 2,110 with an index score of 0.836 for college-level tests given in 2010.\n\nJHS regularly has a high percentage of its students that attend post secondary institutions, with over 65 percent of the 2010 senior class receiving scholarships totaling over $7.8 million.\n\nJHS has a highly awarded performing arts program, with options such as choir, symphonic and marching band, acting, and visual and performing arts being available to students. Several levels of each program are available to students, and each program has continuously received various awards at competitions. The marching band, led by Grant Harbison and Seth Jansen, is a regular participant at various competitions, and regularly receives team and individual awards. The acting program, led by Dawn Tucker, regularly performs plays each semester, and has its regularly students participate in Forensics and Thespian tournaments, including the International Thespian Festival. A high percentage of its students receive individual awards and scholarships. In 2011 the JHS Thespian Troupe performed at the International Thespian Competition in Scotland.\n\nJHS offers a variety of clubs, such as foreign language clubs, honorary organizations (National Beta Club, Mu Alpha Theta, and National Honor Society), leadership oriented (Student Council, FCCLA, FBLA), sports clubs (\"J\" Club and FCA), drug prevention (PRIDE Youth Program), and others that are sponsored by civic organizations whose general intent is philanthropic.\n\nIn 2011, students in the school's Family, Career and Community Leaders of America (FCCLA) program won 2nd place at the Family and Consumer Sciences Knowledge Bowl held at the 2011 FCCLA National Conference. In 2012, Jonesboro won 4th place at the National Conference. Family and Consumer Sciences Knowledge Bowl is a three-level, team competition that challenges students’ knowledge of all aspects of family and consumer sciences.\n\nThe current school building was designed by the Jonesboro firm Little and Associates. This replaced the original building destroyed by a tornado on May 27, 1973. They were not allowed to build a structure larger than two stories. They were also limited on the number of windows in the structure due to the laws on public school buildings in place at the time. This kept them from restoring the beautiful original colonial-style building.\n\nAfter a special election, the district was awarded additional funding through a millage increase. Part of this increase will be used towards the construction of new facilities and upgrading of previous ones. JHS benefited from a complete overhaul of its current Don Riggs Hurricane Gym and a newly constructed Performing Arts Center intended to seat over 1000 people. Jonesboro High School's football field and track were also refurbished for the 2013 season.\n\nThe Jonesboro athletic teams are known as the Golden Hurricane or Hurricane. They play in the Arkansas High School Athletic Association, Class AAAAAA East Conference. The Athletic Director is David Daniel.\n\nJonesboro has won three Arkansas State Football Championships, most recently in 1979. The Hurricane last won a conference championship in 2011.\n\nHead Football Coach Jim DeVazier resigned at the end of the 2007 season after a 25+ year stint. The Jonesboro Public School District chose Randy Coleman, former coach at cross-town school Valley View High School, to replace DeVazier.\n\nIn 2008 the Hurricane saw a resurgence of sorts in football, going (8-2) in the regular season, thus receiving a second round home game in the AAAAAA Playoffs. The Hurricane's traditional rivals are West Memphis High School and Greene County Tech High School, both near Jonesboro in Northeast Arkansas. In 1998 Jonesboro began a series with smaller cross-town rival Nettleton High School (4A) and leads the series 4-1. The \"Crosstown Showdown\" has since ceased. In 2010 a new rivalry was started with the Greene County Tech Golden Eagles known as the \"Border Bowl\" as the counties in which the schools are located (Craighead and Greene) border each other. Jonesboro currently leads the series 4-0.\n\nThe Hurricane have been successful in basketball, winning a total of 10 Arkansas State Basketball Championships. Most recently, JHS defeated AAAAAA East Conference rival Forrest City for the 2007 title at the Hot Springs Convention Center. In 2006, the Hurricane lost to Little Rock Parkview High School in a rematch of the 1994 state finals game in which the Hurricane won. The main basketball rivals for the Hurricane are West Memphis High School and Nettleton High School. The Hurricane have won several conference championships, most recently in 2014 when the Hurricane won the AAAAAA East Conference Championship against rival Parkview.\n\nCompared to basketball and football, Jonesboro's baseball team is relatively new. The Hurricane first fielded a team in 1989 and made it to their first (and as of 2008 only) state championship game in 2005, played in Baum Stadium at the University of Arkansas. The Hurricane lost to former fellow AAAAAA East Conference member, Sylvan Hills High School. The Hurricane have won several AAAAAA East Conference Baseball Championships, most recently in 2012. The Hurricane's baseball rivals are Searcy High School and Nettleton High School. In 2013, Jonesboro beat Greenwood High School in the AAAAAA state championship to claim their first ever baseball state championship, led by two-time player of the year J.D. Rainwater. In the spring of 2016, Jonesboro High won their second 6A State Championship.\n\nJonesboro High School's track and field teams have won multiple state and conference championships. Past record-breaking athletes and state champions have been Earl Bell (1973) in pole vault, Arkansas State University, Darrell Burris (1973) in 1600m, Arkansas State University, Steve Griffith (1973) in 800m, Arkansas State University, John Butler (1969) in long jump, Henderson State University; Gary Guthrie (1965) in decathlon, Alabama; Jed Jackson (1972) in shot put, Rhodes College; Sam Urton (1974) in hurdles, Arkansas State University; Terry Primm (1975) in pole vault, Arkansas State University; Gary Haag (1963) in hurdles, Arkansas State University; and Charles Reding (1969) in the mile, Arkansas-Monticello.\n\nJonesboro High School's tennis team has won several state championships in recent years. Their most recent state championship was in 2011, when the girls defeated Searcy and the boys defeated Mountain Home. The head coach of the tennis team is Jason Morgan.\n\nVolleyball, golf, soccer, wrestling, cross country, bowling, swimming, and softball have also been successful for the Hurricane, as those teams have had several playoff appearances as well as conference and state championships.\n\nThe girls' volleyball team won a state-high 12 state championships between 1978 and 2016, including three consecutive titles (1994, 1995, 1996). In 2002, the team had its most successful campaign, with a state-record 39 wins in a season.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2201718", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2201718", "title": "Bruton", "text": "Bruton\n\nBruton ( ) is a town, electoral ward, and civil parish in Somerset, England, on the River Brue and on the A359 between Frome and Yeovil. It is 7 miles (11 km) south-east of Shepton Mallet, just south of Snakelake Hill and Coombe Hill, 10 miles (16 km) north-west of Gillingham and 12 miles (19 km) south-west of Frome in South Somerset district. The town and ward have a population of 2,907. The parish includes the hamlets of Wyke Champflower and Redlynch. Bruton has a museum of items from its past from the Jurassic onwards. It includes a table used by the author John Steinbeck on a six-month stay. The River Brue has a history of flooding. In 1768 it destroyed a stone bridge. On 28 June 1917, 242.8 mm of rain fell in 24 hours, leaving a watermark on a pub 20 feet above mean level. In 1984 a protective dam was built 1 km upstream.\n\nThe Church of St Mary, Bruton was founded by Ine of Wessex in the 7th century,\n\nBruton was listed in the Domesday Book of 1086 as \"Briuuetone\", meaning 'Vigorously flowing river' from the Old English \"tor\" and Celtic \"briw\" meaning vigour. The river has been the site of several watermills and in 2003 the South Somerset Hydropower Group installed their first hydroelectric turbine at Gants Mill at nearby Pitcombe.\n\nIt was the site of Bruton Abbey, a medieval Augustinian priory from which a wall remains in the Plox close to Bow Bridge. The priory was sold after the dissolution of the monasteries to the courtier Sir Maurice Berkeley (died 1581), whose Bruton branch of the Berkeley family converted it into a mansion then demolished in the late 18th century. The Dovecote which overlooks Bruton was built in the sixteenth century. It was at one time used as a house, possibly as a watchtower and as a dovecote. It is a Grade II* listed building and ancient monument. It is managed by the National Trust. The building was once within the deerpark of the Abbey. It was adapted by the monks from a gabled Tudor tower. The conversion to be a dovecote took place around 1780. It has over 200 pigeon holes.\n\nBruton was part of the hundred of Bruton.\n\nBruton is referenced in a well-known English folk song, \"The Bramble Briar\". A rare copy of an Inspeximus of Magna Carta was found in Bruton in the 1950s and claimed by King's School, Bruton. The sale of the copy to the Australian National Museum paid for much building work at the school.\n\nMuch of the town's history is shown at the Bruton Museum in the Dovecote Building in the High Street, along with a tourist information office. Bruton Museum Society, formed in 1989, involves the community and local schools in developing the collection of local artefacts. It was initially housed beneath the Co-Op, then in a disused coach house owned by a bank. The museum moved in 1999 to its current location, which was jointly purchased by South Somerset District Council and Bruton Town Council. The time spent in the town by John Steinbeck is commemorated in the museum. It has also organised exhibitions at King's School, including one in 2008 of the work of Ernst Blensdorf. In 2010 an anonymous donor agreed to pay the rent on the building, removing earlier doubts about its future viability.\n\nIn December 2012 plans were announced by Hauser & Wirth to open a gallery and arts centre at a derelict farm on the outskirts on Bruton. This occurred on 14 September 2014.\n\nThe town council has responsibility for local issues. It sets an annual precept (local rate) to cover its operating costs and produces annual accounts for public scrutiny. The town council evaluates local planning applications and works with local police, district council officers and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security and traffic. It initiates projects for maintaining and repairing parish facilities, and consults with the district council on maintenance, repair and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also covered.\n\nThe town falls within the Non-metropolitan district of South Somerset formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972 It had previously been part of Wincanton Rural District. The district council is responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism.\n\nSomerset County Council is responsible for running the largest and costliest local services, such as education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, policing and fire services, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning.\n\nBruton falls in the Somerton and Frome county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system.\n\nBruton railway station lies on the Great Western Main Line, in a section often referred to as the Berks and Hants route, between Westbury and Taunton. The route is the most direct between London (Paddington) and the West Country (ending at Penzance), but is slower for geographical reasons. The stretch between Westbury and Castle Cary is also part of the Heart of Wessex line, served by Great Western Railway services between Bristol Temple Meads and Weymouth.\n\nUntil 12 December 2015, Bruton was served only by rail services between Bristol and Weymouth. In December 2015, South West Trains introduced a rail service between London Waterloo, Salisbury and Yeovil Pen Mill, giving Bruton its first direct London service for some years. This runs to London Waterloo four times a day on Monday to Friday, with three return journeys.\n\nBus services are operated by South West Coaches: route 667 Monday–Saturday, route 1B Monday–Saturday, route 1C schooldays only, route 19 Friday only, route 33 Wednesday only and route 34 term-time only.\n\nWork to build the railway line at Bruton Railway Cutting exposed geology of the epoch of the Middle Jurassic. It is one of the best places in England to demonstrate the stratigraphic distinction of ammonites in the subcontractus zone and the morrisi zone.\n\nThe nearby Godminster Lane Quarry and Railway Cutting is another geological Site of Special Scientific Interest, for study of the Inferior Oolite limestones, of the Middle Jurassic age, laid down in a warm shallow sea some 175 million years ago. The site is unique in that the limestones seen here are more closely comparable with rocks of similar age found in the Cotswolds than with rock sequences seen elsewhere in Somerset. However, the rocks contain the rich assemblage of fossil ammonites typical of the north Dorset/south Somerset area. This feature, along with the unusual limestone sequence, makes the site unique. It is also important as a reference for three sub-divisions (zones) of the Inferior Oolite — the laeviscula, discites and concavum Zones.\n\nBoth the 14th-century Church of St Mary, and the Church of the Holy Trinity, in Wyke Champflower, dated at 1623, are Grade I listed buildings.\n\nJohn Wesley preached in Bruton in 1776. A Methodist chapel at West End was opened in 1848. The congregation was served by the Somerset Mission Circuit and more recently by the Somerset Mendip Circuit.\n\nBruton is known for three popular secondary schools – King's School, Bruton (founded 1519); Sexey's School (founded 1889); and Bruton School for Girls (Sunny Hill) (founded 1900). Each has a sixth form, and a tradition of boarding.\n\nOne of Bruton's notable historic characters was Hugh Sexey (1556–1619), who was born in the local area and attended Bruton Grammar School. By the age of 43 he had been appointed as Royal auditor of the Exchequer to Queen Elizabeth I and later King James I. After his death the trustees of his will established Sexey's Hospital in Bruton as an institution to care for the elderly. Sexey's trust was mainly involved with educational causes. The politician behind the Education Act 1902, Henry Hobhouse, MP (1854–1937), was involved in the founding of Sexey's School and Sunny Hill.\n\n"}

While at Harvard, Grant was a member of the freshman basketball and baseball teams. He played varsity basketball for the Crimson during his sophomore year in 1903, and was set to play varsity baseball the following spring until he was declared ineligible for playing in a professional independent baseball league the previous summer. He graduated from Harvard University with an undergraduate degree in 1905 and a law degree in 1909.\n\nGrant entered the majors with the Cleveland Naps at the very end of the season as an emergency replacement for an ailing Nap Lajoie. He played in the minor leagues in 1906, but returned to the majors with the Philadelphia Phillies in , and was the Phillies' starting third baseman from –1910. Grant batted leadoff for the Phillies, but was known more for his fielding and base stealing than his bat. His best year was , when he batted .268, drove in 67 runs, and stole 25 bases.\n\nTraded to the Cincinnati Reds in , he batted just .223, his last year as a starter. Grant was traded again to the New York Giants in the middle of the season, where he finished his career as a utility infielder. Grant appeared in two games of the 1913 World Series, once as a pinch runner and once as a pinch hitter. He retired after the season. His lifetime batting average was .249.\n\nPerhaps because of his Harvard background, Grant refused to call for a fly ball by yelling, \"I got it!\" Instead, he would only say what he regarded as the more grammatically correct, \"I have it!\"\n\nUpon his retirement from baseball, Grant opened a law practice in Boston.\n\nGrant was one of the first men to enlist when the United States entered World War I in April 1917, and he served as a captain in the 77th Infantry Division. During the fierce battle of the Meuse-Argonne Offensive, all of Grant's superior officers were killed or wounded, and he took command of his troops on a four-day search for the \"Lost Battalion.\" During the search, an exploding shell killed Grant on October 5, 1918. He was the first Major League Baseball player killed in action in World War I. He was buried at the Meuse-Argonne American Cemetery in Lorraine, France.\n\nGrant was one of eight Major League Baseball players known either to have been killed or died from illness while serving in the armed forces during World War I. The others were Alex Burr‚ Harry Chapman, Larry Chappell‚ Harry Glenn‚ Newt Halliday, Ralph Sharman and Bun Troy.\n\nOn Memorial Day, May 30, 1921, representatives from the armed forces, baseball, and the sisters of Grant unveiled a monument in center field of the Polo Grounds to his memory. During the celebration at the end of the last Giants' game in , someone pried the plaque from its monument. It was missing for over 40 years until it was claimed to be re-discovered in a Ho-Ho-Kus, New Jersey home that had been owned by a New York City police officer. However, the photo shown of the supposed plaque on the Internet does not look like the missing plaque from the Polo Grounds, which has now been replicated at the San Francisco Giants current ballpark as of 2006.\n\nGrant is also memorialized with the Edward L. Grant Highway in The Bronx, New York and by Grant Field at Dean College.\n\n , or BR Bullpen, or Flickr, or Retrosheet, or SABR Biography Project, or The Baseball Almanac, or The Baseball Cube, or The DeadBall Era\n"}

His parents were George Dawson, Sr. and Katie Ruth Marston Skidmore.\n\nAfter taking an academic course from the Rev. Dr. Cumming, Dawson attended the county academy in Greensboro, and then was graduated from Franklin College, Athens, Clarke County, Georgia, in 1816 at the age of eighteen. He studied law for a year in the office of the Hon. Thomas W. Cobb, at Lexington, Oglethorpe County, Georgia, and then in the Litchfield Law School of judges Tapping Reeve and James Gould at Litchfield, Connecticut. In 1818, he was admitted to the bar.\n\nDawson set up a practice in Greensboro, where he was a successful jury lawyer. He was known for his ability to settle cases out of court.\n\nIn 1819 he married Henrietta M. Wingfield. They had eight children. His wife died in 1850. Dawson remarried in 1854 to Eliza M. Williams of Memphis, Tennessee.\n\nDawson was elected as one of the vice presidents of the Alumni Society of the University of Georgia at its first meeting, on August 4, 1834.\n\nHe was elected Clerk of the Georgia House of Representatives in 1821 and served twelve years in that post.

Coffee, taking office on December 26, 1836. He was re-elected as a Whig to the 25th, 26th, and 27th Congresses. He served from November 7, 1836, to November 13, 1841.\n\nHe was the Whig candidate for Governor of Georgia in 1841 but was defeated by Charles James McDonald. He thought his defeat as gubernatorial candidate meant that voters disapproved of his congressional service, particularly his vote earlier in the year to tax coffee and tea. He resigned from Congress.\n\nDuring his service in the United States House, Dawson chaired the Committee on Mileage (25th Congress), the Committee on Claims (26th Congress), and the Committee on Military Affairs (27th Congress).\n\nHe was appointed by Governor George W. Crawford to fill a vacancy as Judge of the Ocmulgee Circuit Court in 1845, but he declined to run as a candidate for the bench at the completion of his term.\n\nDawson was elected by the state legislature in November 1847 as the Whig candidate for Georgia's Class 3 seat in the United States Senate for the 31st, 32nd, and 33rd Congresses, serving from March 4, 1849, to March 3, 1855.

A historical sign was placed in his honor in Greensboro.\n\nBecause of his elegant manners, he was called \"the first gentleman of Georgia\" by Joseph Henry Lumpkin.\n\nJoshua Reed Giddings described him: \"He was a man of much suavity of manner; one of that class of\nSouthern statesmen who felt it necessary to carry every measure by the influence of personal kindness, and an expression of horror at all agitation of the slave question, under the apprehension that it might\ndissolve the Union.\"\n\nDawson County, Georgia, and the county seat, Dawsonville, were named for William Crosby Dawson. The county was created by a legislative act on December 3, 1857, primarily out of Lumpkin County and small parts of Gilmer, Pickens and Forsyth counties.

He was also a prominent Republican fundraiser and served as chairman of the 2004 Bush-Cheney election campaign in Northwest Ohio and chairman of the Lucas County Republican party. Noe was also an avid coin dealer and owned various coin dealing companies, such as \"Capital Coin\" and \"Vintage Coins & Collectibles\", as well as their subsidiaries.\n\nBoth Noe and his wife Bernadette Restivo-Noe have been chairperson of the Lucas County Republican party. Noe was also chairman of the 2004 Bush-Cheney election campaign in Northwest Ohio. Noe was convicted of making illegal contributions to George W.

In the 2004 election, the county experienced extreme voting difficulties, including criminal investigations and manipulation of the recount, and many officials resigned or were suspended. The Ohio Secretary of State told Bernadette to resign or be fired. She resigned from both the Lucas County Republican Party and the Lucas County Board of Elections in December 2004.\n\nNoe was appointed to the Ohio Board of Regents, which oversees Ohio's public colleges and universities, by former Ohio Governor George Voinovich in 1995 to complete a vacated term.

Noe was vice-president of \"Hi-Genomics LLC\" and owned a 23% stake in the company. Noe's position on the Board of Regents was deemed to be a conflict of interest by the Ohio Ethics Commission. Noe was told to either resign from the Board, divest his interest in the company, or step down as vice-president of the company.

Established in 1818, it was the first diocese of the Episcopal Church to be established outside the original 13 colonies and presently consists of 95 parishes, with a membership of almost 19,000 individuals. The diocese was contiguous with the state of Ohio, but was divided into two dioceses in 1875, due to the geographical size of the diocese and the poor health of Bishops MacIlvaine and Bedell. The Episcopal Diocese of Ohio, which retained the original name, and the Diocese of Southern Ohio headquartered in Cincinnati. It is one of 15 dioceses that make up the Province of the Midwest (Province 5).\n\nOriginally the diocesan see, or headquarters city, was located in Gambier in south-central Ohio, but moved to Cleveland shortly after the diocesan split. Offices are located on Euclid Avenue near Trinity Cathedral, the cathedral of the diocese.\n\nAs settlers and missionaries moved westward after the Revolutionary War, they brought their faith traditions with them, including those of the newly formed Episcopal Church. In the Ohio Territory, three clergyman served as early missionaries. Efforts in the Ohio Valley were led by Deacon James Kilbourne and Joseph Doddridge, while Roger Searle led efforts in the Western Reserve. Shortly after Ohio was admitted to the Union, the first Episcopal church was established in the state at Worthington, near present-day Columbus in 1804. After years of fruitless petitions and through the hard work of missionaries and others, the General Convention of the Episcopal Church finally granted Ohio a separate diocese in 1818.\n\nPhilander Chase was appointed the first Bishop of Ohio in 1819. Chase returned from a fund raising trip to England in 1823 and established the diocesan headquarters and a new Episcopal college, Kenyon College, in Gambier. Kenyon College and Gambier were named for Lord Kenyon and Lord Gambier, the largest benefactors of the college and new diocese. Bishop Chase retired after a leadership dispute in 1832, and soon moved to Illinois.\n\nCharles Pettit McIlvaine succeeded him as Ohio's bishop and Kenyon College's president. Rt.Rev. McIlvaine was a leading advocate of Evangelicalism, which called upon the Episcopal Church to turn from the more Anglo-catholic reforms of the Oxford Movement and return to a purer Protestant expression in the Church.\n\nUpon Bishop McIlvaine's death in 1873, Gregory Thurston Bedell became the Third Bishop of Ohio, having been consecrated as assistant bishop in 1859. Bishop Bedell had staunchly supported the Union in the Civil War, and, like McIlvaine, has been credited with keeping the Episcopal Church unified during this time, unlike many other denominations. Two years later, the General Convention split the Diocese of Ohio into two separate dioceses. The Diocese of Ohio favored more evangelical expression of worship and theology, and Bishop Bedell moved its headquarters to Cleveland at its northeast corner, in the growing urban areas along Lake Erie. Thomas Augustus Jaggar was then consecrated the first bishop of the new Episcopal Diocese of Southern Ohio, which had some parishes favoring more Anglo-catholic styles and established its headquarters in Cincinnati in the state's southwestern corner.\n\nWilliam Andrew Leonard was consecrated as the Fourth Bishop of Ohio in 1889 and was responsible, with financial backing from William G. Mather, for constructing Trinity Cathedral, completed in 1907. Charles F. Schweinfurth designed the structure in English Perpendicular Gothic form from Indiana limestone. Diocesan offices were located in the adjoining Church House, where they remain.\n\nThe Right Reverend Mark Hollingsworth, Jr. was consecrated as the 11th Bishop of Ohio on April 17, 2004 and is assisted by two assisting bishops: the Right Reverend William Persell, retired bishop of the Diocese of Chicago; and the Right Reverend Arthur Williams, retired bishop suffragan of the Diocese of Ohio.\n\nBishops who have served the diocese include:\n\n\n"}

Founded in 1966 in Boston, Massachusetts, the program is the longest continuously running voluntary school desegregation program in the country and a national model for the few other voluntary desegregation busing programs currently in existence. The Massachusetts Racial Imbalance Act (RIA) in 1966, and amended in 1974, is the legal basis for voluntary interdistrict transfers for the purpose of desegregation (such as METCO). In recent years the gap between cost and funding has increased, and the program has been criticized as severely underfunded by advocates and opponents alike.\n\nAs defined by the original METCO Grant, the purpose of the program is, \"To expand educational opportunities, increase diversity, and reduce racial isolation by permitting students in Boston and Springfield to attend public schools in other communities that have agreed to participate. The program provides students of participating school districts the opportunity to experience the advantages of learning and working in a racially, ethnically, and linguistically diverse setting.\" METCO was originally created as a short-term program designed as a stop-gap measure as Boston addressed its most under performing schools. However, due in part to the initial success of the program (and the continuing failure of many of Boston's public schools), the program has been in place consistently since 1966.\n\nThe mission of METCO is two-fold, to give students from Boston's under-performing school districts the opportunity to attend a high-performing school and increase their educational opportunities and to decrease racial isolation and increase diversity in the suburban schools. It has been reported both qualitatively and quantitatively that most families weigh the opportunity for an excellent education as far more important than decreasing racial isolation. While families may acknowledge it as an important side factor, it is generally referred to as secondary to the goal of maximizing educational opportunity. The program focuses heavily on the support network and environment in each of the towns in which it operates. METCO partner families or METCO \"buddies\" are designed to bring the communities together and provide support for students within the program in the town in which they attend school. A look at any of the community sites is generally filled with advertisements for community events, such as the Wayland/METCO Florence Adler 5k Walk/Run, Weston/METCO Family Friends WHS Pumpkin Festival or the Weston/METCO Family Friends Ice Cream Social.\n\nMETCO is a state-funded grant program run by the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education. While the Department has final authority related to the grant program, the Department works closely with the METCO Advisory Committee on policy, which consists of representatives from the community, directors, superintendents, METCO Inc, and parent representatives. Overall, the program has two levels of administration. The central office in Roxbury organizes placements, transportation, special programs, and policy decisions. METCO directors and counselors in the suburbs work with students in the program, their parents, and the personnel in the school district. The program was originally supported through a grant from the Carnegie Foundation and the United States Office of Education.\n\nThe program grew out of the dissatisfaction and frustration with the Boston School Committee. A large number of black parents boycotted the Boston Public Schools for their failure to integrate. As this was happening, the Brookline Civil Rights Committee of Brookline, MA (a Boston suburb that borders the city) broached the possibility of enrolling black students from Boston in the Brookline Public Schools, sparking the conversation that would lead to the development of the METCO concept.\n\nIn 1966, METCO's first year of existence, METCO Inc. was established and seven school districts (Braintree, Lincoln, Arlington, Brookline, Lexington, Newton and Wellesley) began to accept students. METCO Inc. was established in 1966 as the service provider, and facilitates the student referral process and day-to-day operations. As of 2015 there are approximately 3,300 students enrolled in the program, the majority of whom come from the city of Boston (about 150 come from the city of Springfield). As of 2001, approximately 4,300 students have graduated from the program since its founding. In the 2010-2011 school year, 75.2% of METCO pupils were African American, 3.4% were Asian, 16.8% were Hispanic, and the remaining 5% were classified as multi-race or \"other.\" The METCO program was established to shift students from \"racially imbalanced\" (>50% nonwhite) to \"racially isolated\" (<30% nonwhite) districts, and the majority of receiving districts remain racially isolated. Boston's school district is currently 35% African-American, 41% Hispanic, 13% White and 8% Asian. As of 2010-2011, 33 of the 37 receiving districts remained \"racially isolated\" (over 70% white) while 4 receiving districts are \"racially balanced\" (50%-70% white).\n\n\nLincoln originally targeted a \"critical mass\" of 20-25% METCO students in each classroom. Once a study was done of the cost of METCO and the impact on number of classrooms, Lincoln reduced its participation to around 18%.\n\nIn order to qualify for the program, a student must be a resident of Boston or Springfield and be non-white. Eligibility does not take into account a student's record (including academics and behavior), English language proficiency, socioeconomic status, attendance record or immigration status. The program (including transportation which may be a lengthy drive depending on town) does not cost the student money and also provides after-school tutoring and transportation.\n\nThe state legislature only provides METCO funds for Boston and Springfield to send students to nearby school districts.\n\nChapter 76, Section 12A of Massachusetts General Law provides for the METCO program: \"The school committee of any city or town or any regional district school committee may adopt a plan for attendance at its school by any child who resides in another city, town, or regional school district in which racial imbalance, as defined in section thirty-seven D of chapter seventy-one, exists in a public school. Such plan shall tend to eliminate such racial imbalance, shall be consistent with the purposes of said section thirty-seven D, and shall include an estimate of the expenses necessary to implement such plan.\" Chapter 71, Section 37D defines \"racial imbalance\" as a public school in which more than 50% of the students are minority (non-white) students. \"Racial isolation\" is defined as existing in a public school where under 30% of the student population consists of non-minority (white) students.\n\nWhile the Racial Imbalance Act was passed in 1966 (and amended in 1974) to support desegregation, not all METCO student transfers are desegregating according to the law. In 2016, some receiving districts continue to receive METCO students yet are not \"racially isolated\" (fewer than 30% non-white students). Due to rapid demographic changes, one receiving district (Lexington) is in 2016 exceeding 50% non-white students in its schools. As a consequence, one study finds that under this state of \"racial imbalance\", Lexington is ineligible to receive METCO students under the parameters of the Racial Imbalance Act.\n\nThe size and the scope of the METCO program has changed dramatically, but the essential goals and logistics remain unchanged. However, a 2007 Supreme Court ruling has the potential to fundamentally alter the METCO program. Through the decisions \"Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School District No. 1\" and \"Meredith v. Jefferson County Board of Education\", the Supreme Court determined that race cannot be a factor in school assignments. Should METCO be legally challenged by a white student, the program may be forced to use income instead of race to screen applicants. This would impact the program's usefulness as a desegregation tool. No lawsuits challenging the program have yet been filed, but several communities have begun to discuss whether income should be used instead of race.\n\nReceiving school districts offer numerous tutoring, extended day, and counseling benefits exclusively to METCO students, despite constitutional issues with use of race to determine programmatic eligibility.\n\nWhen METCO was initiated in 1966, receiving districts received a state grant covering transportation costs for students, and a tuition assessment set by receiving districts. Over time, the financial system evolved from one where receiving districts set tuition rates, to a \"grant\" system where a standard per-pupil grant of $3,925 (FY2017) is provided to receiving districts, almost all of which is used to fund METCO direct services with no money available for indirect general educational expenses.\n\nWhile numerous studies have compared METCO student success with general populations in Boston or the state, no controlled studies have been done to determine effects. METCO students come from families with higher income levels than the Boston population at large, and an extended wait list system which requires registration as early as infancy may be biased against participation by transient and low income populations. Rather than randomized referral to suburbs from the wait list, METCO Inc. states that its policy is to give priority based on waitlist order. It is unclear whether this process has been audited by the state and whether Metco Inc. provides preferential referral to affiliated individuals.\n\nMETCO Inc. has been written into the legislation to operate the METCO program without a competitive bid process. Moreover, METCO Inc. was established to advocate for African-American students, but is expected to operate the METCO program for the benefit of all Boston minority students.\n\nMETCO Inc. forced the resignation of its 43 year executive director, Jean McGuire, in September 2016. The METCO Board described this as simply a retirement agreement, while Mrs. McGuire later told the Boston Globe she was forced to resign due to \"age discrimination.\"\n\nLocal METCO directors can apply funds towards expenses such as snacks and party goods. Wayland's METCO director was audited for a series of \"questionable and undocumented\" expenses reimbursed through the METCO discretionary account.\n\nBoston and Springfield are the two districts which send students to receiving communities.\n\nA subset of school districts in the Boston area participate in METCO, typically those districts which are more affluent (and can subsidize the program).\n\n\n"}

She was one of the models (\"Barker's Beauties\") on the daytime game show \"The Price Is Right,\" from 1977 to 1995.\n\nOn January 3, 1977, Hallstrom joined the cast of \"The Price Is Right\" as the third model after Anitra Ford left the program the previous fall. Hallstrom appeared, along with Janice Pennington and Dian Parkinson, as one of the principal models on all versions of the show from 1977 through the early 1990s.\n\nHallstrom briefly left the program in 1983 to pursue an acting career but re-joined the cast later in 1984.\n\nIn September 1995, host Bob Barker dismissed Hallstrom from \"The Price Is Right\". She later alleged that Barker ordered her off the show because of she had gained due to a prescription medication she was taking. Hallstrom later alleged that the real reason for her dismissal was her refusal to support Barker when another model, Dian Parkinson, sued him for sexual harassment. Hallstrom said Barker ordered her to go on talk shows and do interviews saying that Parkinson was lying, as well as being instructed to recall certain events differently from how she remembered them. Hallstrom, who did not want to get involved in the situation or perjure herself, refused and was dismissed from the show. In response to angry letters sent by fans of the series after Hallstrom's dismissal, Barker sued Hallstrom for libel and slander (\"Barker v. Hallstrom\"), claiming that Hallstrom was lying, but dropped the suit 48 hours before the trial began. The court declared Hallstrom the prevailing party and ordered Barker to pay Hallstrom's legal fees.\n\nHallstrom countersued Barker for age, weight and medical discrimination, wrongful termination and malicious prosecution (\"Hallstrom v. Barker\"). In October 2005, Hallstrom received a multimillion-dollar settlement. The settlement would have possibly been more, but early settlement agreements all contained a \"hush clause\" that forbade Hallstrom from saying anything disparaging about Barker to the media. However, Barker refused to agree to the mutuality clause of the settlement agreement, thereby retaining the right to speak freely against Hallstrom in the media. In order to retain her right to speak about the case, and to protect herself against what she called Barker's \"shameful manipulation of the media\", Hallstrom accepted a lesser financial amount but with a settlement that did not contain a hush clause. She has also started a foundation for individuals who have suffered wrongful or malicious conditions in the workplace and do not have the power or resources (financially or otherwise) to go up against powerful individuals or large corporations, despite having a valid, non-frivolous claim.\n\nFollowing their testimonies in Barker's lawsuit against Hallstrom, models Janice Pennington, Kathleen Bradley, production assistants Linda Riegert and Sherrill Paris, and veteran director Paul Alter lost their jobs on \"The Price Is Right\". Pennington, who had been with the show since its debut in 1972, and Bradley (1990–2000) received out-of-court financial settlements. Pennington's contained a hush clause prohibiting her from speaking publicly against Barker. Although Pennington has not spoken publicly regarding Barker or her departure from \"The Price Is Right\" since receiving her financial settlement, Bradley has referred to her termination as \"abrupt\" and \"unexpected\", and as an event she was not prepared for. Paris filed suit against Barker for wrongful termination, along with another female production assistant, Sharon Friem, who was also dismissed at the same time and sued Barker for wrongful termination, as well as sexual harassment and sex discrimination, claiming she was the target of many inappropriate sexual remarks and gestures. Both women received financial settlements to drop their lawsuits against Barker. Alter briefly regained his position and employment on the show in 2000 where he remained until he retired.\n\nHallstrom has never married and has no children, which is why she believes she was the one member of \"The Price Is Right\" who could stand up to what she called \"miserable tyranny at the hands of a mad dictator\" (referring to Barker). During the nearly ten years her lawsuit was in the courts, she spent all of her resources and savings, sold her house, and ended up living out of her car. As she said in interviews regarding that period of her life, \"I refused to give up and let that evil old bastard win.\" Hallstrom is now semi-retired and living in one of several houses she owns, all of which are in and around San Antonio. She does give occasional interviews for shows such as \"The Today Show\" and \"The View\".\n\nHallstrom also appeared several times as a guest panelist on \"Match Game\". In the early 1990s she also appeared on \"Family Feud\" with her \"Price Is Right\" costars, the majority of which appearances were played against the cast of \"The Young and the Restless\".\n\n"}

It lies north-west of Anguilla across the Dog and Prickly Pear Passage. The distance to Dog Island, the next nearest island of Anguilla, is .\n\nSombrero is long north–south, and wide. The land area is . Originally, when viewed from the sea, the island had the shape of a sombrero hat, but guano-mining operations have left the island with precipitous sides and a relatively flat top that is above sea level. The surface of the island is rough, and vegetation is sparse.\n\nThe guano-mining operation yielded some 3000 tons of phosphate a year by 1870. By 1890, the phosphate reserves had been exhausted.\n\nThe lighthouse marks the Anegada Passage, which is the route from Europe into the Caribbean. The first lighthouse was erected in 1868. In 1960, Hurricane Donna damaged this lighthouse, with the result that a new lighthouse replaced it in 1962. The lighthouses were manned from 1868 to 2001. In that year, Trinity House donated and installed the current, automated tower, which is a round tower, painted white. Anguilla's Department of Fisheries and Marine Resources is responsible for the maintenance of the navigational aids.\n\nAs a result of the Treaty of Utrecht in 1714, Sombrero passed into the hands of the British. Captain Warwick Lake of \"Recruit\" marooned an impressed seaman, Robert Jeffrey, there on 13 December 1807. As it turned out, Jeffrey survived. A passing American vessel, the schooner \"Adams\" from Marblehead, Massachusetts, had rescued him. Still, a court-martial dismissed Lake from the Royal Navy.\n\nIn 1814, and again in 1825, a British geologist surveyed the island and found that it abounded in guano and reported this to the British government.\n\nIn 1856 the Americans claimed the island, and in a very short period of time quarried 100,000 tons of phosphate that served as fertilizer for the exhausted lands of the Southern States. Uniquely, an important insurrection occurred when West Indian black workers revolted against the “slavery proclivities” of a white American superintendent vis-à-vis wage-earning free men. Four of the 200 workers \"fatally injured\" Superintendent Snow and commandeered the island and company money and stores.\n\nThe British later intervened and demanded compensation from the United States for the occupation. The conflicting claims to the island were settled in Britain's favour in 1867.\n\nSombrero, lying in the route of shipping from England to South and Central America, lay in an area with many hazards and in 1848 the Admiralty was asked to install a light on it. On 30 June 1859, the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company's ship \"Paramatta\" was wrecked on her maiden voyage on Horseshoe Reef, which resulted in another request to the Admiralty. The lighthouse was then built and first exhibited its light on the evening of 1 January 1868.\n\nIronically, \"Paramatta\" and the Lighthouse built following her demise were both constructed by the same shipyard, the Thames Ironworks and Shipbuilding Company, on the banks of the River Lea in Blackwall, London. \"Paramatta\" was the last ship launched from their Middlesex bank, while the lighthouse was built on the Essex side, the yard occupying premises on either side of the river. In 1871, the lease of the island was sold for £55,000 and then sold again for £110,000 to the New Sombrero Phosphate Company, which led to litigation in \"Erlanger v. New Sombrero Phosphate Co\" (1878) 3 App Cas 1218.\n\nFrom the early 1870s until 1885, a Cornish mining engineer, Thomas Corfield, was Superintendent of Sombrero. His duties included organizing the conveying of the guano to a spot which was convenient for loading the lighters to take the guano to the ships lying off the island, overseeing the construction of derricks and engine houses, and arranging for the laying of the tram lines for the wagons, which were loaded at the quarries. The guano was just piled in dumps near the engine houses and derricks. There was no semblance of a port and no beach.\n\nThe black workers were recruited from various islands and lived in wooden huts during their term of service. Stores and various supplies were obtained from a merchant at Philipsburg, Sint Maarten, a Mr Nesbit. The company's schooner \"Logos\" brought supplies and also took the black labourers to and from their homes on the other islands.\n\nThe superintendent's house was a wooden bungalow near the middle of the island, and around it were grouped the quarters of the technicians, store keepers, and lighthouse keepers, and other wooden buildings. On the side opposite to the main buildings was a small building for the superintendent. There was a wide veranda round the house and he used to live there with his family, except near the hurricane season.\n\nIn 1890, the phosphate works on the island were abandoned and by 1893 the lighthouse had come under the authority of the British Board of Trade, later the Department of Transport. Administration of the light was carried out by Trinity House. In 1931, the old light system was changed and improved to 200,000 candle power and the tower received its first major repair when the basement was encased in concrete.\n\nOn 20 July 1962, after the destruction caused by Hurricane Donna in 1960, the present lighthouse was put into operation and the old tower demolished on 28 July 1962. The lighthouse is located near the centre of the island, and reaches a height of almost above sea level. It protects ships passing from the Atlantic Ocean to the Caribbean Sea through the Anegada Passage. Full responsibility for the light passed from Trinity House to the Anguillan government on 1 December 2001.\nUntil recently the only inhabitants were the staff of the lighthouse, but the light was automated in 2002, and now the island is uninhabited. The only visitors are the occasional fishermen, biologists engaged in fieldwork, and the occasional scuba group visiting the island for its interesting dive sites and post-apocalyptic surface.\nThe island is noted for the endemic Sombrero ameiva, a widespread and easily seen lizard species on the island. A recently discovered dwarf gecko, \"Sphaerodactylus\", may be endemic and has been tentatively named the Sombrero dwarf gecko. The Anguilla Bank anole also inhabits the island. This island also has a unique Lasioglossum bee.\n\nThe surrounding waters are feeding areas for hawksbill turtles. During the late Pleistocene, the island was inhabited by a now-extinct giant tortoise, \"Chelonoidis sombrerensis\".\n\nSombrero has been identified as an Important Bird Area by BirdLife International because of its breeding seabirds. The island has also been designated as a protected Ramsar site since 2018. It supports internationally important numbers of:\n\n\n\nCitations\n\nReferences\n"}

They are often observed in cases where a phase transformation front moves quickly, leaving behind two solid products, as in rapid cooling of eutectic (such as solder) or eutectoid (such as pearlite) systems. \n\nSuch conditions force phases of different composition to form but allow little time for diffusion to produce those phases' equilibrium compositions. Fine lamellae solve this problem by shortening the diffusion distance between phases, but their high surface energy makes them unstable and prone to break up when annealing allows diffusion to progress. A deeper eutectic or more rapid cooling will result in finer lamellae; as the size of an individual lamellum approaches zero, the system will instead retain its high-temperature structure. Two common cases of this include cooling a liquid to form an amorphous solid, and cooling eutectoid austenite to form martensite.\n\nIn biology, normal adult bones possess a lamellar structure which may be disrupted by some diseases. \n"}

It was founded by Vehbi Koç, one of Turkey's wealthiest businessmen, and is currently under the umbrella of the Vehbi Koç Foundation. The school comprises a high school, which was established in 1988, and an elementary school, established ten years later, in 1998. In 1994, The Koç School has become the first school in Turkey to offer the IB program. The school admits its students based on their achievements on the nationwide examination for high schools in Turkey. It is one of the most selective private schools in Turkey.\n\nKoç School is a high and elementary school fully accredited by the Turkish Ministry of Education, European Council of International Schools (ECIS), International Baccalaureate Organisation (IBO), Independent schools UK, England, Scotland, Wales & NI and international schools worldwide (ISBI) and the National Association for College Admission Counseling (NACAC). It offers boarding for five or seven days a week for students of classes between 6-12 at its dorms on its campus.\n\nFounded in 1988 by the Vehbi Koç Foundation, Koç School has quickly become one of Turkey's most selective and competitive university preparatory schools.\n\nKoç School has started offering the IB Diploma Programme in 1994. With the introduction of the programme, many students started applying to overseas educational institutes with high reputation. Koç students have been accepted into universities such as Princeton, Harvard, Oxford, Cambridge, Yale, Columbia, University of Pennsylvania, Stanford, MIT, and University of Chicago. Up till 2018, the number of students seeking overseas education has constantly increased.\n\nThe school's Turkish university entrance success is also considerable: general student achievement is among the top when compared with other similar high schools. In fact in 2000, the top scorer of ÖSS was a Koç School graduate. In the 2006 ÖSS, 19 Koç students were in the top 1000 of over 1.500.000 attendants and many students that applied abroad were accepted to top ten universities in the US.\n\n\n\n\nElementary School Directors\n\n\nKoç School is located on a campus on the eastern outskirts of Istanbul, near Tuzla, Istanbul.\nMany of the school facilities were subject to renovations after the first ten years of the school due to increased demands and population of the school.\n\nThe important facilities and buildings in the school campus are:\n\nKoç School is a bilingual school in Turkish and English but also offers the option of a second language: French, German or Spanish. Students choose between an IB track or a non-IB track at the end of tenth grade. Koç School is also the IB coordinator in Istanbul, and prepared the IB Turkish Social Studies Curriculum to be covered in all around the world in IB Schools.\n\nEach year, many students of the Koç School prefer to continue their education in overseas universities. The school's Overseas College Guidance Office is strong with its admission statistics. each year.\nAt the end of each academic year, 1-2 students with a high academic achievement in each subject are awarded according to the feedbacks of teachers and departments.\n\nKoç School is also successful in national and international high school competitions on Math and Sciences.\n\nThe school also provides an international faculty with teachers from Australia, Britain, Brazil, Canada, India, Ireland, Russia, Scotland, The Netherlands, U.S., New Zealand and Turkey teaching Science, languages, arts. Some of the current and former notable faculty include John Freely, writer and professor of Physics at Bogazici University, and Erol Köroğlu, writer and doctor of literature and cultural studies at Sabanci University.\n\nIn the first two years of education, a high school student usually takes the following courses: Turkish Literature, Philosophy, Psychology, English, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Arts, Military Science, Physical Education, Religion and Ethics, History, Health, Geography, Geometry, Mathematics, an elective second language course, an elective from a variety of courses like Movie Studies, Advanced Multimedia, etc.\n\nIn the last two years, Koç School provides a variety of IB and non-IB courses. Among the mandatory and elective courses provided to junior and seniors are: Art History, Biology, Business & Management, Ceramics, Chemistry, Computer Science, Computer Programming, Economics, English, Environmental Systems, French, German, Information Technology in Global Society, Knowledge of Language and Literature, Linguistics, Mathematics, Music, Philosophy, Photography, Physics, Psychology, Theory of Knowledge, Turkish Social Studies, Turkish Literature, and Visual Arts.\n\nThere are usually two examinations (or projects and/or papers to be counted as an exam grade) for each course at each semester. Exams are usually held in \"Common Exam Week\" (or for the finals \"Final Examination Week\"). Examinations are scheduled by the Dean's office and regular class schedule continues to take place with shorter amount of time for each period. After the exam results are announced several awards (with different categories: Academic Success, Effort, Improvement) are given by the teachers to students.\n\nIt is compulsory for each student to join a student club or a sports activity offered at school. Every student has to pick one of the following activities at the beginning of each semester and has to regularly attend its meetings.\n\nThe school has over 50 clubs. Some of the available extracurricular activities and clubs are:\n\n\n\nKoç School is also the first Turkish school to apply the International Award Association programme.\n\nEnvironmental Projects are of the major activities in the school, in fact recycling project of Koc School Students won the First Prize in the International Volvo Adventure 2006 competition.\n\nAt the end of each academic year, extracurricular awards are given to students according to the feedbacks of the supervisors of clubs.\n\nThe school has many facilities for sports. Some of the school sport teams are girls-boys basketball, girls volleyball, badminton, table tennis, athleticism, football, folk dance, skiing, dance, and rhythmic gymnastics. Team members are determined after eliminations at the beginning of the academic year. School teams regularly participate in national tournaments.\n\nEach year there are basketball and football tournaments between classes in which each class forms its teams. There are about two matches each week in which boys and girls from different classes compete. The final matches are done at \"SpringFest\". The winner class team is awarded with a cup and each team member with a medal.\n\nThe school has a growing number and an increasing quality of publications, among them are literary magazines like \"Boyut\", \"Fanzin\" and \"Mindscapes\", a two-week newspaper \"T.A.W.A\", and \"Philosophy\". All publications are open to submissions from the whole student body. \"Boyut\" and \"Fanzin\" are published by the member students in each journal's clubs with the assistance of the Turkish department. \"Mindscapes\" is published with the assistance of the English language department and it is also open to all contributions after an evaluation process carried by the student and teacher editors. \"TAWA\" was initially the publication/newsletter of the \"Student Council\" and later gained an independent position as the school newspaper in 2003. It is published by a team of student journalists independent from clubs and student organisations.\n\nThe MUN Club admits its members on an application basis. Students have to write a convincing statement of purpose and score above average at the exam testing general knowledge of the member applicants. There are approximately 60 members of the club.\n\nEach year the MUN Club attends at least five MUN conferences in Turkey and around the world. Some of the conferences participated by the Koc School students in the previous years took place in various parts of the world including the Hague, Cairo, Beijing, Brussels and Paris. MUN Club has been among the most successful clubs in the school with many awards, such as Best Governor, Award of Distinction and Best Delegate in the conferences participated such as Harvard Model Congress Europe by students Bülent Kozlu (1997), Josef Amado (1997), Hale Altan (1997), Özlem Cebeci (2009), Berke Tınaz (2010), Alp Yavuz (2011), Ecesu Bayır (2011), Ege Mihmanlı (2011), Sinan Adlım (2012).\n\nThe club also organises a Model United Nations Development Programme conference each year at its campus since 2001. is the first Model United Nations Development Programme conference in the world, whose establishment in 2001 was celebrated by the former UN General Secretary Kofi Annan. Each year \"MUN Delegates\" from many schools in Turkey and overseas participate in the conference. Each year more than 650 participants attend to the conference as delegates, chairs, advisors, admins and executive committee members. 2017's conference was the 17th session of MUNDP and the participant number exceeded 800 for the first time.\n\nKoç School Student Council is composed of students elected by the student body at the regular elections each year in June. It is composed of 18 students with 6 members from the 12.and 11.grade and 2 representatives from each class at school. The Student Council consists of a school president, vice president, social activities coordinator, finance coordinator, sports coordinator, 1 independent student representative elected from the 12. grade students and a total of 12 representatives elected from grades 9-11 and preparatory year students. The Council meets regularly each week with a faculty adviser. All major and important decisions of the council are to be approved by the faculty adviser even if the meetings are done without the presence of the adviser.\n\nEven though it's criticized of its lack of ability to effect school politics (an example would be the abolishing of Courtyard and building a pyramid instead, which was disliked by many of the students during the time) concerning discipline code, student freedoms etc., it is an active student organization with especially its election campaigns being one of the major events each year.\n\n\n\n\nAlthough Koç School is a relatively young school, it is promising with its traditions adhered by its student body and alumni. Following are notable traditions and traditional activities in the school.\n\n\nKoç School's notable alumni include Cengiz Pehlevan, who got the first place in 2000 University Entrance Exam; Murat Eken, actor; Mehmet Özge Özen, writer; C. M. Kosemen, artist and author; Tansa Mermerci, socialite and fashion designer; Berrak Tüzünataç, actress; Berkun Oya, artist and playwright; Ceylan Zigoslu, fashion designer; Mustafa Domanic, columnist; Yigit Kiraz, actor; Lalin Akalan, artist and creator; Emirhan Esenkova, screenwriter and poet; Afsin Yurdakul, anchorwoman and journalist; Ozgur Gungor, the notable New York based sculptor; and Enes Ayaz, who graduated in 2008 and was accepted to Harvard, MIT, Yale with full scholarship and touted as one of the \"Future 25\" by the Time Magazine.\n\n\"Koç School Alumni Association\" offers several activities for the alumni including homecomings, Summer Picnic at campus, Winter Reunion in Istanbul, and Reunions in Boston, New York and London.\n\nThe elementary school was founded in 1998. It was established in order to adapt to the change in the Turkish education system. Education is, again, bilingual in English and Turkish across all grades. Students are taught English language from the earliest years. In Grade 4 and 5 students take extra Science and Maths classes which are taught in English. Starting from the sixth year Science and Math classes are taught in English.\n\nGraduates of the elementary school have the right to continue their education at the high school after taking an exam to skip the preparation year. If they score over 55% in this exam, they are automatically enrolled in 9th grade of the high school. If they score below 55%, they have to study 1 year of extensive English preparation.\n\n\n"}

The island has an area of and a 2012 Census population of 23,769. Providenciales is the largest island in population, the third largest in area, and is home to a large majority of the population of the Turks and Caicos Islands. Providenciales was ranked the best beach destination in the world by TripAdvisor in 2011.\n\nThe island is served by the Providenciales International Airport.\n\nThere is no public transportation on the island. \n\nAs recently as 1964, Providenciales did not have a single wheeled vehicle. Roads, water, telephones, and electricity were also absent. The original developer, Provident, Ltd, had shuttle flights from Florida (for a real estate buying program) two times a week in a World War II DC-3 plane and the only hotel was the Third Turtle Inn built by them in 1967.\n\nAfter a large investment on Grace Bay Beach by Club Med, the island's first large hotel and casino complex opened in 1984 and touched off a development boom. Resorts included Ocean Club, Turquoise Reef (current Seven Stars), North Beach (now Beaches), and Grace Bay Club. As of the year 2000, Provo is the most tourist-oriented and developed of the Turks and Caicos Islands, boasting many resort hotels and an 18-hole golf course. The island has recently become popular with retirees from around the world, kindling a boom of residential development. Grace Bay has seen many luxury condos built on its shores, however, the settlements of Turks Islanders still provide a local flair to the island.\n\nThe diving is world class due to the coral reef surrounding the island.\n\nThe island is close to a common migration route for the humpback whale. Providenciales is surrounded by uninhabited cays that are easily reached by chartered boat or excursion.\n\nThe resorts on Providenciales are primarily centred on long Grace Bay. Apart from the beaches, the island's charm lies in its rugged hills and ridges, which are carpeted with prickly pear cactus and scrub (some say the Turks and Caicos gets its name from the indigenous Turk's head cactus common in the islands).\n\nLong Bay Beach, on the southern, windward side of the island is still largely undeveloped save for a large luxury resort on the northern tip of the beach. Due to its steady wind and relatively isolated location, Long Bay Beach is rapidly becoming a kiteboarding destination in the Caribbean.\n\nGrace Bay has grown to be a major tourist destination with many hotels and condominiums built on the beachfront. Beginning with Club Med in the 1984 and Grace Bay Club in 1993, development continued in the late 1990s with The Sands, Point Grace, and Ocean Club West, and again in the 2000s with The Palms (formerly Regent Palms), Gansevoort and West Bay Club.\n\nOutside of Grace Bay, Amanyara was built in the 2000s in the secluded Northwest Point area, and the Shore Club opened in 2017 in the Long Bay Area.\n\nOpportunities for sightseeing and hiking are reasonable. There are remnants of Caribbean piracy at Osprey Rock and Sapodilla Hill, and the ruins of Cheshire Hall, a 1790s plantation house constructed by British loyalists, are also notable.\n\nThe western half of Providenciales is mostly barren wilderness, home to the island's best natural attraction, Chalk Sound National Park. The park is a long bay southwest of Downtown. The colour of the water is a uniform turquoise and studded with countless mushroom-like tiny islets. Also on the western part of the island is Northwest Point Marine National Park, which extends to nearby reefs and several saline lakes that attract breeding and migrant waterfowl.\n\nThe major road, the Highway, runs east–west from Downtown to Leeward. Most of the island's services are near the Highway, including shopping plazas.\n\nThe communities of Downtown and Kew Town are located near Providenciales International Airport. The town of Wheeland is in the northwest corner of the island.\n\nBefore Provo became a popular tourist destination, there were three small centers of population: Blue Hills, The Bight (on Grace Bay) and Five Cays. Now many houses have been built, predominantly in the east and south, with larger communities at Leeward, Long Bay and Chalk Sound, as well as expansion of the original three settlements. There are also pockets of makeshift shacks interspersed among the more upscale residences.\n\nClement Howell High School and Long Bay High School are the local public high schools.\n\nInternational School of the Turks and Caicos Islands, which serves preschool through grade six, is also in Providenciales, in Leeward. In 2014 it had 106 students. It was known as The Ashcroft School until 2014.\n\n"}

It is a sub-department of the Department of Geography in the University of Cambridge, located on Lensfield Road in the south of Cambridge ().\n\nSPRI was founded by Frank Debenham in 1920 as the national memorial to Captain Robert Falcon Scott and his companions, who died on their return journey from the South Pole in 1912. It investigates issues relevant to the Arctic and Antarctic in the environmental sciences, social sciences and humanities. The Institute is home the Polar Museum and has some 60 personnel, consisting of academic, library and support staff plus postgraduate students, associates and fellows attached to research programmes. The Institute also hosts the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research.\n\nSPRI has several research groups. Notable researchers that have been based at the Institute include current Director, Julian Dowdeswell, British diplomat Bryan Roberts, and glaciologist Elizabeth Morris.\n\nThis group's work involves quantifying the state of the cryosphere using remote sensing by satellites, plus accurate field measurements and computer simulations, to understand the processes in detail. In particular, the group has been able to observe the melting of the Larsen Ice Shelf, the rapid retreat of ice in western Antarctica, and increased summer melting in northern Canada. This work has contributed greatly to understanding climate change.\n\nThis group's work focuses on the dynamics of ice-sheets and delivery of sediment to the marine environment. The group uses geophysical and geological evidence gathered by icebreakers in the polar seas.\n\nThis group's work focuses on the processes which modify the polar and sub-polar environments, such as Arctic vegetation, and snow and ice cover. Improving techniques for measuring vegetation from satellite data is an important part of the work.\n\nThis is an interdisciplinary group covering the anthropology, history and art of the Arctic. Its work includes looking at politics and environmental management in the polar regions, with particular expertise in the religion, culture and politics of the Russian North.\n\nSPRI operates the Polar Museum, which presents a range of objects, artworks, documents and photographs from the Institute's extensive polar collections. The collections include material related to polar history, exploration, science, art and Arctic cultures.\n\nIn 2010 the renovated Polar Museum opened its doors to the public; the reopening was met with widespread acclaim and the museum was shortlisted for the Art Fund's Museum of the Year prize in 2011. It contains displays of Arctic art and artefacts, material from the nineteenth century search for the Northwest Passage, the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration (including the last letters of Captain Scott) and contemporary research and policy relating to the polar regions.\n\nAs well as permanent exhibits, the museum regularly hosts special exhibitions. The museum is open Tuesdays to Saturdays (and Bank Holiday Mondays), 10:00 – 16:00 and on Sundays, 12:00 - 16:00. Admission is free.\n\nThe museum is one of the eight museums and botanic garden which make up the University of Cambridge Museums consortium.\n\nImportant material representing a wide of range of people concerned with the polar regions is cared for by the Scott Polar Research Institute and on display in the Polar Museum includes:\n\nThe wide ranging collections include art and photographic works by several notable artists and photographers, including:\n\nThe Institute is actively adding to its collection of contemporary polar art through its artist in residence scheme, managed by the Friends of SPRI, which enables an artist to travel to the Antarctic and the Arctic each year.\n\nThe Scott Polar Research Institute houses the world's most comprehensive polar library and archives. The Institute's Thomas H. Manning Archive contains an unparalleled collection of manuscript material relating to research in and exploration of the polar regions, For scientists and scholars, the library offers a collection developed since the 1920s covering all subjects relating to the Arctic, the Antarctic, and to ice and snow wherever found. For industry, it is a prime information source on such subjects as exploration and exploitation of natural resources and on the environmental implications of such activities in the polar regions; on the design of ice-strengthened shipping and selection of sea routes; and on problems of construction and transportation in cold environments. The library also offers an unrivalled resource for the needs of international relations and strategic defence.\n\nThe Picture Library contains a photograph collection from both the Arctic and Antarctic, mainly depicting the history of exploration in the polar regions, including much material from the expeditions of Scott and Shackleton. The Thomas H. Manning Polar Archives are named in honour of the British-Canadian Arctic researcher, a university alumnus. Its work includes an oral history programme which interviews people who have worked in the polar regions over the years. Due to high demand, the Polar Archives runs a booking scheme for anyone wishing to consult material. \n\nThe most recent addition to the library is the Shackleton Memorial Library, which in 1999 won a regional award from the Royal Institute of British Architects. This part of the building holds much of the library's Antarctic collection, as well as some of its subject-based material.\n\nThe library is an active member of the Polar Libraries Colloquy, an international organization of Librarians and others concerned with the collection, preservation, and dissemination of information dealing with the Arctic and Antarctic regions. The library is open to anyone with a polar interest for reference work and research.\n\nWhile climbing Mount Erebus in November 1912 as part of Robert Falcon Scott's ill fated \"Terra Nova\" expedition, Frank Debenham came up with the idea of a polar research institute. After the end of World War I, he co-founded the institute with Raymond Priestley and was its first director.\n\nThe Grade II listed main building (1933–1934) is by Sir Herbert Baker.

{"id": "2201832", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2201832", "title": "Appointment with Death", "text": "Appointment with Death\n\nAppointment with Death is a work of detective fiction by British writer Agatha Christie, first published in the UK by the Collins Crime Club on 2 May 1938 and in the US by Dodd, Mead and Company later in the same year. The UK edition retailed at seven shillings and sixpence (7/6) and the US edition at $2.00.\n\nThe book features the Belgian detective Hercule Poirot and reflects Christie's experiences travelling in the Middle East with her husband, the archaeologist Sir Max Mallowan.\n\nHolidaying in Jerusalem, Poirot overhears Raymond Boynton telling his sister, \"You do see, don't you, that she's got to be killed?\" Their stepmother, Mrs Boynton, is a sadistic tyrant who dominates her family. When she is found dead on a trip to Petra, Poirot proposes to solve the case in twenty-four hours, even though he has no way of knowing whether it was murder.\n\nThe novel opens as the family and the victim are introduced through the perspective of Sarah King and Dr. Gerard, who discuss the behaviour of the family. Mrs. Boynton is sadistic and domineering, behaviours which she may have carried over from her original profession of prison warden. Sarah is attracted to Raymond Boynton, while Jefferson Cope admits to wanting to take Nadine Boynton away from her husband, Lennox Boynton, and the influence of her mother-in-law. Having been thwarted in her desire to free the young Boyntons, Sarah confronts Mrs. Boynton whose apparent reply is a strange threat: \"I’ve never forgotten anything – not an action, not a name, not a face.\" When the party reaches Petra, Mrs. Boynton uncharacteristically sends her family away from her for a period. Later, she is found dead with a needle puncture in her wrist.\n\nPoirot claims that he can solve the mystery within twenty-four hours simply by interviewing the suspects. During these interviews he establishes a timeline that seems impossible: Sarah King places the time of death considerably before the times at which various of the family members claim last to have seen the victim alive. Attention is focused on a hypodermic syringe that has seemingly been stolen from Dr. Gerard's tent and later replaced. The poison administered to the victim is believed to be digitoxin, something that she already took medicinally.\n\nPoirot then calls for a meeting and explains how each member of the family has, in turn, discovered Mrs. Boynton to be dead and, suspecting another family member, failed to report the fact. None of the family would have needed to murder the victim with a hypodermic, since an overdose could have been administered much more effectively in her medicine. This places the suspicion on one of the outsiders.\n\nThe murderer is revealed to be Lady Westholme who, prior to her marriage, had been incarcerated in the prison in which the victim was once a warden. It was to Lady Westholme, and not to Sarah, that Mrs. Boynton had addressed that peculiar threat; the temptation to acquire a new subject to torture had been too great for her to resist. Disguised as an Arab servant, she had committed the murder and then relied upon the suggestibility of Miss Pierce to lay two pieces of misdirection that had concealed her role in the murder. Lady Westholme, eavesdropping in an adjoining room, overhears that her criminal history is about to be revealed to the world and commits suicide. The family, free at last, take up happier lives: Sarah marries Raymond; Carol marries Jefferson; and Ginevra takes up a successful career as a stage actress – she also marries Dr. Gerard.\n\n\nSimon Nowell-Smith's review in the \"Times Literary Supplement\" of 7 May 1938 concluded that \"Poirot, if the mellowing influence of time has softened many of his mannerisms, has lost none of his skill. His examination of the family, the psychologists and the few others in the party, his sifting of truth from half-truth and contradiction, his playing off one suspect against another and gradual elimination of each in turn are in Mrs Christie's most brilliant style. Only the solution appears a trifle tame and disappointing.\"\n\nIn \"The New York Times Book Review\" for 11 September 1938, Kay Irvin said, \"Even a lesser Agatha Christie story holds its readers' attention with its skillful management of suspense. \"Appointment with Death\" is decidedly of the lesser ranks: indeed, it comes close to being the least solid and satisfactory of all the Poirot mystery tales. Its presentation of a family harried and tortured by a sadistic matriarch is shot full of psychological conversation and almost entirely deficient in plot. And yet, when the evil-hearted old tyrant has been murdered at last and Poirot considers the suspects, one follows with genuine interest the unraveling of even unexciting clues.\"\n\nIn \"The Observer\"'s issue of 1 May 1938, \"Torquemada\" (Edward Powys Mathers) said, \"I have to confess I have just been beaten again by Agatha Christie. There was no excuse. I was feeling in particularly good form; and the worst of it is that she handicapped herself in the latest game with what in anyone else would be insolent severity. \"Murder on the Nile\" (sic) was entirely brilliant; \"Appointment with Death\", while lacking the single stroke of murderer's genius which provided the alibi in the former story, must be counted mathematically nearly twice as brilliant, since the number of suspects is reduced by nearly half. Indeed, though we begin our story in Jerusalem and meet our murder in Petra, the Red Rose City, we might as well be in a snowbound vicarage as far as the limitation of suspicion is concerned. And it is in this respect that Agatha Christie repeats her \"Cards on the Table\" triumph and beats Steinitz with a single row of pawns.\"\n\n\"The Scotsman\" of 9 May 1938 said, \"As usual, Miss Christie plays fair with her readers. While the solution comes with a shock of surprise, it is logical enough: the clues are there, one could fasten upon them and assess their importance. Perhaps it is another case of the reader being unable to see the wood for the trees; but there are so many trees. Not this author's best crime novel, \"Appointment with Death\" is yet clever enough and convincing enough to stand head and shoulders above the average work of the kind.\"\n\nE.R. Punshon of \"The Guardian\" in his review of 27 May 1938 summarised: \"For ingenuity of plot and construction, unexpectedness of dénouement, subtlety of characterisation, and picturesqueness of background, \"Appointment with Death\" may take rank among the best of Mrs. Christie's tales.\"\n\nMary Dell in the \"Daily Mirror\" of 19 May 1938 said, \"This is not a book I should recommend you to read last thing at night. The malignant eye of Mrs. Boynton might haunt your sleep and make a nightmare of your dreams. It's a pretty eerily bloodcurdling tale. A grand book.\"\n\nRobert Barnard wrote: \"Notable example of the classic-era Christie, with excellent Near East setting, and the repulsive matriarch as victim. The family tensions around her are conveyed more involvingly than usual. The detection, with its emphasis on who-was-where-and-when, is a little too like Ngaio Marsh of the period, and there is some vagueness in the motivation, but this is as taut and atmospheric as any she wrote.\"\n\nThe novel mentions several other Poirot investigations: the detective is seen to retell to Colonel Carbury the story of \"Cards on the Table\", and Colonel Race from this investigation is mentioned. Nadine Boynton actually confronts Poirot with his own actions in the conclusion of \"Murder on the Orient Express\", Poirot suggesting that she was told by one of the case's figures. Miss Pierce also comments on \"The A.B.C. Murders\" when she recognises Poirot as a great detective.\n\n\nThe first true publication of \"Appointment with Death\" occurred in the US with a nine-part serialisation in \"Collier's Weekly\" from 28 August (Volume 100, Number 9) to 23 October 1937 (Volume 100, Number 17) with illustrations by Mario Cooper.\n\nThe UK serialisation was in twenty-eight parts in the \"Daily Mail\" from Wednesday, 19 January to Saturday, 19 February 1938 under the title of \"A Date with Death\". Fifteen of the instalments contained illustrations by J. Abbey (Joseph van Abbé, brother of Salomon van Abbé). This version did not contain any chapter divisions and omitted various small paragraphs such as the quote in Part I, Chapter twelve from Dr Gerard which is taken from Book IV of \"Ecclesiastes\". The political argument between Lady Westholme and Dr Gerard in chapter ten about the League of Nations was also deleted. Finally, the epilogue did not appear in the serialisation.\n\nFour days before the first instalment appeared, in the edition dated Saturday, 15 January, a piece specially written by Christie as an introduction to the serialisation appeared in the \"Daily Mail\". She charted the creation of Poirot and expressed her feelings about him in the famous quote, \"There have been moments when I have felt: 'Why-why-why did I ever invent this detestable, bombastic, tiresome little creature!'\"\n\nChristie adapted the book as a play of the same name in 1945. It is notable for being one of the most radical reworkings of a novel Christie ever did, not only eliminating Hercule Poirot from the story, but also changing the identity of the killer. In the play, the ill Mrs Boynton committed suicide and dropped several red herrings that pointed to her family members as possible suspects, hoping that they would suspect each other and therefore continue to live in her shadow even after her death. In addition, the character of Carol Boynton has been dropped, Ginevra is now a stepdaughter (rather than a natural child) of Mrs Boynton, Lady Westholme becomes an ex-Member of Parliament, Miss Pierce is now Miss Pryce, and Alderman Higgs has been added as a fellow vacationer/verbal sparring partner for Lady Westholme.\n\nThe novel was later adapted into the sixth of six films to star Peter Ustinov as Poirot, and released in 1988. The film retained the essential plot of the book, though the location of the murder was changed from Petra to Qumran, an archaeological site in Palestine. The cast included Lauren Bacall, Carrie Fisher, Sir John Gielgud, Piper Laurie, Hayley Mills, Jenny Seagrove and David Soul. In the movie Miss Pierce was renamed Miss Quinton, and the character of Dr. Gerard was removed.\n\nThe novel was adapted for the eleventh season of the series \"Agatha Christie's Poirot\" starring David Suchet as Poirot. The screenplay was written by Guy Andrews and it was filmed in Casablanca (with Mahkama du Pacha acting as Hotel Constantine in the adaptation and Kasbah Boulaouane as the excavation site) and El Jadida, Morocco in May 2008. It was directed by Ashley Pearce, who also directed \"Mrs McGinty's Dead\" and \"Three Act Tragedy\". The cast included Christina Cole, Tim Curry, John Hannah and Elizabeth McGovern.\n\nThe storyline deviates significantly from the original novel in many respects, among them:\n\n\n\"Appointment with Death\" was adapted for radio by BBC Radio 4, featuring John Moffatt as Poirot.\n\n"}
{"id": "2201833", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2201833", "title": "Abraham Dee Bartlett", "text": "Abraham Dee Bartlett\n\nAbraham Dee Bartlett (27 October 1812 – 7 May 1897) was a British taxidermist and an expert on captive animals. A superintendent of the London Zoo, he was a prominent observer of animal life and a zoologist who became a popular authority on wildlife. He brought the London Zoo into prominence and was associated with many naturalists including Charles Darwin.\n\nAbraham was the second son of John Bartlett and Jane Dunster. John Bartlett had apprenticed under William Turner, father of J. M. W. Turner, the famous artist, and was a hairdresser and brushmaker. Abraham became interested in animals a child and was allowed by his father's friend, Edward Cross, owner of the menagerie Exeter Exchange in the Strand, to make regular visits. This interest led to Cross introducing him to taxidermy. He, however, began to work as an apprentice to his father in the hairdressing business before he shifted to taxidermy in 1834. His taxidermy business near the British Museum was so successful that he was able to move to bigger home, and towards the end of his life, he owned three houses. He married Lydia Norvall and had four daughters and two sons.\n\nBartlett supported D. W. Mitchell on the idea that the collection of animals held by the Zoological Society of London could be made accessible to the public for a small fee that could help the society. It was open on Mondays for a fee of six pence. Queen Victoria gave him a gold watch for taking care of her pet birds. Dead birds were sent to him for taxidermic preservation, and for his excellent exhibits, he received a gold medal at the Great Exhibition of 1851. He was among the first to reconstruct a specimen of the dodo, and this was displayed at Sydenham Crystal Palace, where he was also appointed naturalist around 1852. The restoration was destroyed, though, in the 1866 fire. He associated himself with the Zoological Society and was offered the position of superintendent made vacant by the death of John Thompson at the garden in Regents Park in 1859. As superintendent, Bartlett became a familiar figure for visiting naturalists and corresponded with many across the world. He was an agent for the acquisition of wild animals from suppliers such as Edward Blyth and was involved in their sale to circus agents such as P.T. Barnum. He kept the position at the zoo, and became a familiar figure until his death. He became an authority on the care of wild animals and published papers in the\" Proceedings of the Zoological Society\" and other journals. He received a silver medal by the Zoological Society in 1872 and was made an associate of the Linnean Society in 1879. Charles Darwin often discussed his ideas on sexual selection with Bartlett. He noted, for instance: \"I asked Mr. Bartlett, of the Zoological Gardens, who has had very large experience with birds, whether the male tragopan (one of the Gallinaceae) was polygamous, and I was struck by his answering, 'I do not know, but I should think so from his splendid colours.'\" When Darwin was studying the facial expressions of wild animals, he was introduced to the artistic and observational abilities of Joseph Wolf by Bartlett. Wolf was able to make illustrations of fleeting facial expressions for Darwin, although Wolf himself had reservations about Darwin's interpretations.\nIn 1882, Bartlett became quite unpopular after deciding to sell the popular African elephant Jumbo to P. T. Barnum for £2000. A case was made against the sale, but the courts ruled against any interference.\n\nBartlett died in the zoo premises on 7 May 1897, after suffering from an illness. He was buried at St James's cemetery, Highgate. His son, Clarence, who had been assistant superintendent at the zoo, took his position as superintendent. Another son, Edward Bartlett, also became a taxidermist who collected specimens in Peru and became a curator at the Maidstone Museum and the Raja Brooke's museum, in Sarawak. Several writings by Bartlett were published after his death in two books, \"Wild Animals in Captivity\" (1898) and \"Life among Wild Beasts in 'the Zoo\"' (1900).\n\n"}

The disease was first discovered in Gumboro, Delaware in 1962. It is economically important to the poultry industry worldwide due to increased susceptibility to other diseases and negative interference with effective vaccination. In recent years, very virulent strains of IBDV (vvIBDV), causing severe mortality in chicken, have emerged in Europe, Latin America, South-East Asia, Africa and the Middle East. Infection is via the oro-fecal route, with affected bird excreting high levels of the virus for approximately 2 weeks after infection. The disease is easily spread from infected chickens to healthy chickens through food, water, and physical contact.\n\nIBDV is a double-stranded RNA virus that has a bi-segmented genome and belongs to the genus \"Avibirnavirus\" of family \"Birnaviridae\". There are two distinct serotypes of the virus, but only serotype 1 viruses cause disease in poultry. At least six antigenic subtypes of IBDV serotype 1 have been identified by \"in vitro\" cross-neutralization assay. Viruses belonging to one of these antigenic subtypes are commonly known as variants, which were reported to break through high levels of maternal antibodies in commercial flocks, causing up to 60 to 100 percent mortality rates in chickens. With the advent of highly sensitive molecular techniques, such as reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), it became possible to detect the vvIBDV, to differentiate IBDV strains, and to use such information in studying the molecular epidemiology of the virus.\n\nIBDV genome consists of two segments, A and B, which are enclosed within a nonenveloped icosahedral capsid. The genome segment B (2.9 kb) encodes VP1, the putative viral RNA polymerase. The larger segment A (3.2 kb) encodes viral proteins VP2, VP3, VP4, and VP5. Among them, VP2 protein contains important neutralizing antigenic sites and elicits protective immune response and most of the amino acid (AA) changes between antigenically different IBDVs are clustered in the hypervariable region of VP2. Thus, this hypervariable region of VP2 is the obvious target for the molecular techniques applied for IBDV detection and strain variation studies.\n\nClinical disease is associated to bird age with the greatest bursal mass, which occurs between 3 and 6 weeks of age. The greatest bursal mass is mostly a result of a large population of maturing IgM-bearing B-lymphocytes (lymphoblasts), the main target of infection. Young birds at around two to eight weeks of age that have highly active bursa of Fabricius are more susceptible to disease. Birds over eight weeks are resistant to challenge and will not show clinical signs unless infected by highly virulent strains.\n\nSubclinical disease occurs in chickens infected before three weeks of age. At this age the B-lymphoblast population is smaller and the systemic effects are insufficient for generating clinical signs. However, the B-cell destruction is usually most severe in subclinically infected young, as virus will destroy a smaller population and most cells in one place (the bursa).\n\nAfter ingestion, the virus destroys the lymphoid follicles in the bursa of Fabricius as well as the circulating B-cells in the secondary lymphoid tissues such as GALT (gut-associated lymphoid tissue), CALT (conjunctiva), BALT (Bronchial) caecal tonsils, Harderian gland, etc. Acute disease and death is due to the necrotizing effect of these viruses on the host tissues. Kidney failure is a common cause of mortality. If the bird survives and recovers from this phase of the disease, it remains immunocompromised which means it is more susceptible to other diseases.\n\nDisease may appear suddenly and morbidity typically reaches 100%. In the acute form birds are prostrated, debilitated and dehydrated. They produce a watery diarrhea and may have swollen feces-stained vent. Most of the flock is recumbent and have ruffled feathers. Mortality rates vary with virulence of the strain involved, the challenge dose, previous immunity, presence of concurrent disease, as well as the flock's ability to mount an effective immune response. Immunosuppression of very young chickens, less than three weeks of age, is possibly the most important outcome and may not be clinically detectable (subclinical). In addition, infection with less virulent strains may not show overt clinical signs, but birds that have bursal atrophy with fibrotic or cystic follicles and lymphocytopenia before six weeks of age, may be susceptible to opportunistic infection and may die of infection by agents that would not usually cause disease in immunocompetent birds.\n\nChickens infected with the disease generally have the following symptoms: pecking at other chickens, high fever, ruffled feathers, trembling and slow walking, found lying together in clumps with their heads sunken towards the ground, diarrhea, yellow and foamy stool, difficulty in excretion, reduced eating or anorexia.\n\nThe mortality rate is around 20% with death within 3–4 days. Recovery for survivors takes about 7–8 days. \n\nThe presence of maternal antibody (antibody passed to the chick from the mother) changes the disease's progression. Especially dangerous strains of the virus with high mortality rates were first detected in Europe; these strains have not been detected in Australia.\n\nA preliminary diagnosis can usually be made based on flock history, clinical signs and post-mortem (necropsy) examinations. However, definitive diagnosis can only be achieved by the specific detection and/or isolation and characterization of IBDV. Immunofluorescence or immunohistochemistry tests, based on anti-IBDV labelled antibodies, or in-situ hybridization, based on labelled complementary cDNA sequence probe, are useful for the specific detection of IBDV in infected tissues. RT-PCR (as mentioned above) was designed for the detection of IBDV genome, such as VP1 coding gene, with the possibility of PCR product sequences be determined for genetically comparing isolates and producing phylogenetic trees. Serological tests such as agar gel precipitation and ELISA, for detecting antibodies, are used for monitoring vaccine responses and might be additional information for diagnosis of infection of unvaccinated flocks.\n\nNecropsy examination will usually show changes in the bursa of Fabricius such as swelling, oedema, haemorrhage, the presence of a jelly serosa transudate and eventually, bursal atrophy. Pathological changes, especially haemorrhages, may also be seen in the skeletal muscle, intestines, kidney and spleen.\n\nPeri-focal vaccination may not be effective for the combat of an outbreak, due to the rapidity of wild-IBDV spreading.\n\nPassive immunity may protect against challenge with homologous IBDV, as does previous infection with homologous avirulent strains. Breeder flocks may be immunised against IBD so that they would transfer protective antibodies to their progenies, such as broiler and pullet chicks. Low-attenuated vaccine strains may cause damage to the bursa of Fabricius and immunosuppression in susceptible chicks. Biosecurity with adequate restriction to farm visitation and distancing from other flocks. Post outbreak hygiene measures may not be effective as the virus can survive for long periods in both housing and water.\n\nThe natural hosts of IBD are chickens and turkeys.\n\n\n"}

The group originated circa 2003 in the United Kingdom.\n\nCIRCA emerged from the direct action movement and has participated in protests against George W. Bush's visit to the UK in 2003 and demonstrations against the 2003 invasion of Iraq.\n\nThe group was particularly prominent in many of the actions organised around the 31st G8 summit held in Gleneagles during July 2005. Members of CIRCA entertained children in Auchterarder while waiting for permission to march near the summit.\n\nCIRCA has active groups in the United Kingdom, Ireland, the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Denmark, Germany, and Israel, and many other groups have appeared that have been inspired by the work of the original group.\n\nThose participating in CIRCA actions typically dress in military-style camouflage clothing supplemented with brightly coloured trimmings and political logos. The costumes both create a comical atmosphere and serve to maintain anonymity during protests. 'Armaments' are usually limited to feather dusters, although some carry water pistols. The complete ensemble of the costume and traditional clown make-up (usually consisting of a white face and red nose) creates a sense of ridiculousness which seeks to challenge preconceptions of radical activists.\n\nCIRCA claims that there is more to the group than simply dressing up and being playful. There is also a psychology which informs its actions: the clown persona can be used to defuse tense situations and engage with police in public order situations. In order to learn this 'recruits' must participate in a training workshop aka Big Shoe Camp before deployment.\n\nIn an article about the G8 protests, the \"Edinburgh Evening News\" described CIRCA as \"\"an anarchist splinter group,\"\" but a member of the organization denied this, saying that while some members would describe themselves as anarchists \"\"...most would consider themselves 'horizontalists' where we engage people without the need for leaders.\"\"\n\n\n\n"}

Given its origin and behavior it is classified as a sarcoma. About half the cases are diagnosed in people with neurofibromatosis; the lifetime risk for an MPNST in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 is 8–13%. MPNST with rhabdomyoblastomatous component are called malignant triton tumors.\n\nThe first-line treatment is surgical resection with wide margins. Chemotherapy (e.g. high-dose doxorubicin) and often radiotherapy are done as adjuvant and/or neoadjuvant treatment.\n\nSymptoms may include:\n\nSoft tissue sarcomas have been linked within families, so it is hypothesized that neurofibrosarcoma may be genetic, although researchers still do not know the exact cause of the disease. Evidence supporting this hypothesis includes loss of heterozygosity on the 17p chromosome. The p53 (a tumor suppressor gene in the normal population) genome on 17p in neurofibrosarcoma patients is mutated, increasing the probability of cancer. The normal p53 gene will regulate cell growth and inhibit any uncontrollable cell growth in the healthy population; since p53 is inactivated in neurofibrosarcoma patients, they are much more susceptible to developing tumors.\n\nA malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor is rare, but is one of the most common frequent soft tissue sarcoma in the pediatrics population. About half of these cases also happen to occur along with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF-1), which is a genetic mutation on the 17th chromosome which causes tumors along the nervous system. The lifetime risk of patients with NF-1 developing MPNST has been estimated at 8–13%, while those with only MPNST have a 0.001% in the general population.\nNF-1 and MPNST are categorized as autosomal dominant disorders. This means when one receives an abnormal gene from one of their parents, they will ultimately have that disorder. That person has a 50/50 chance of passing on that gene to their offspring. The pedigree to the right describes this genetic pattern.\n\nThe most conclusive test for a patient with a potential neurofibrosarcoma is a tumor biopsy (taking a sample of cells directly from the tumor itself). MRIs, X-rays, CT scans, and bone scans can aid in locating a tumor and/or possible metastasis.\n\nMalignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors are a rare type of cancer that arise from the soft tissue that surrounds nerves. They are a type of sarcoma. Most malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors arise from the nerve plexuses that distribute nerves into the limbs—the brachial and lumbar plexuses—or from nerves as they arise from the trunk.\n\nTreatment for neurofibrosarcoma is similar to that of other cancers.\nSurgery is an option; the removal of the tumor along with surrounding tissue may be vital for the patient’s survival. For discrete, localized tumors, surgery is often followed by radiation therapy of the excised area to reduce the chance of recurrence.\nFor patients suffering from neurofibrosarcomas in an extremity, if the tumor is vascularized (has its own blood supply) and has many nerves going through it and/or around it, amputation of the extremity may be necessary. Some surgeons argue that amputation should be the procedure of choice when possible, due to the increased chance of a better quality of life. Otherwise, surgeons may opt for a limb-saving treatment, by removing less of the surrounding tissue or part of the bone, which is replaced by a metal rod or grafts.\nRadiation will also be used in conjunction with surgery, especially if the limb was not amputated. Radiation is rarely used as a sole treatment.\nIn some instances, the oncologist may choose chemotherapy drugs when treating a patient with neurofibrosarcoma, usually in conjunction with surgery. Patients taking chemotherapy must be prepared for the side effects that come with any other chemotherapy treatment, such as; hair loss, lethargy, weakness, etc.\n\nPatient response to treatment will vary based on age, health, and the tolerance to medications and therapies.\n\nMetastasis occurs in about 39% of patients, most commonly to the lung. Features associated with poor prognosis include a large primary tumor (over 5 cm across), high grade disease, co-existent neurofibromatosis, and the presence of metastases.\n\nIt is a rare tumor type, with a relatively poor prognosis in children.\n\nIn addition, MPNSTs are extremely threatening in NF1. In a 10-year institutional review for the treatment of chemotherapy for MPNST in NF1, which followed the cases of 1 per 2,500 in 3,300 live births, chemotherapy did not seem to reduce mortality, and its effectiveness should be questioned. Although with recent approaches with the molecular biology of MPNSTs, new therapies and prognostic factors are being examined.\n"}

His younger brother Sir Alfred Thomas Wilde was a Lieutenant-General in the Madras Army, while Sir John Wylde (Chief Justice of the Cape Colony) and Thomas Wilde, 1st Baron Truro (Lord Chancellor) were his uncles.\n\nHe was educated at Winchester College and Trinity College, Cambridge (matriculated 1834, graduated B.A. 1838, M.A. 1842). He was admitted to the Inner Temple in 1836, and called to the Bar in 1839.\n\nHe became a successful lawyer himself and was appointed a Queen's Counsel in 1855. He was knighted in 1860, shortly after his appointment as a Baron of the Exchequer. He presided over the Court of Probate and Divorce from 1863 until his retirement in 1872, being raised to the peerage as Baron Penzance, of Penzance in the County of Cornwall, in 1869. He was the judge in the sensational Mordaunt divorce case.\n\nIn 1875, he accepted the post as Dean of Arches and presided over a number of notorious trials, notably, Bell Cox, Dale, Enraght, Green and Tooth, under the Public Worship Regulation Act 1874 arising out of the Ritualist controversy in the Church of England.\n\nIn 1866, he presided over \"Hyde v. Hyde\", a polygamy case. \nIn his ruling, Lord Penzance stated:\n\"What, then, is the nature of this institution as understood in Christendom?...If it be of common acceptance and existence, it must have some pervading identity and universal basis. I conceive that marriage, as understood in Christendom, may for this purpose be defined as the voluntary union for life of one man and one woman, to the exclusion of all others.\"\n\nThis remained the common-law definition of marriage throughout the British Empire and successor states. \nIn Canada, it was overruled by an explicit statutory definition in the \"Civil Marriage Act\" 2005, which allowed for same-sex marriage.\n\nWilde argued, following Lord Campbell and others, that the works of Shakespeare are extremely accurate in matters of law. In \"The Bacon-Shakespeare Controversy\" (1890)\nhe wrote of \"Shakespeare's perfect familiarity with... English law... so perfect and intimate that he was never incorrect and never at fault\", arguing that this was evidence that the plays were the work of a legal expert such as Bacon. Several other authors followed Wilde's arguments about the legal expertise used in Shakespeare, including Sir George Greenwood. Opponents of Wilde's view argued that Shakespeare's knowledge of the law was not exceptional.\n\nHe married Lady Mary, daughter of William Pleydell-Bouverie, 3rd Earl of Radnor, in 1860. There were no children from the marriage. The couple resided at Eashing Park, Godalming.\n\nAt his garden in Godalming, from \"Rosa eglanteria\" and \"Rosa foetida\" he produced two new roses named Lady and Lord Penzance.

Production currently stands at over 8 million hectolitres, and approximately half the alcohol consumed is beer.\n\nLager accounts for 60% of the beer sold, stout 34% and ale 6%.\n\nBy the beginning of the nineteenth century, there were over two hundred breweries in the country, fifty-five of them in Dublin. In the nineteenth century, the number of breweries fell to about fifty, and by 2007 only about twelve remained.\n\nHistorically, Ireland produced ale, without the use of hops, as the plant is not native to Ireland. Large quantities of hops were imported from England in the 18th century. In 1752, more than 500 tons of English hops were imported through Dublin alone. In the second half of the 18th century, beer, mostly porter, was imported from England in increasing quantities: 15,000 barrels in 1750, 65,000 in 1785, and over 100,000 in 1792. In the 1760s about 600,000 barrels of beer were brewed annually in Ireland.\n\nIn the 18th century, the Irish Parliament used taxation to encourage brewing at the expense of distilling, reasoning that beer was less harmful than whiskey. In the 1760s, the Royal Dublin Society offered prizes to brewers who used the most Irish hops and those that produced the most porter.\n\nBrewing prospered in the early decades of the 19th century and by 1814 Ireland was exporting more beer to England than it imported. Irish exports to England accelerated as the century progressed and from a modest 11,328 barrels in 1828, exported 689,796 barrels by 1901.\n\nIn 1998, Ireland produced approximately 8.5m hectolitres of beer per year; this rose to 8.7m in 2002. Exports were 3.5m hectolitres in 1998 and fell to 2.4m in 2002. Whilst Ireland lies 6th in the world for beer consumption per capita, it ranks 4th in the consumption of alcohol, with 11.7 litres per head in 2011.\n\nIn 1756, Arthur Guinness set up a small brewery, moving to Dublin in 1759. Having initially brewed ale, he switched to producing porter, which was a style from London. In the early twentieth century, Guinness became the largest brewer in the world, exporting the Irish style to many countries. Although no longer the largest brewer of beer\nin the world, it remains the largest brewer of stout. In 2014, Guinness sales amounted to 19% of all beer sales in Ireland.\n\nStout brewed by Guinness (and the smaller brewers Murphy's and Beamish) once dominated domestic beer consumption in Ireland, with lager and ale having much smaller shares. Lager has subsequently grown in popularity with Carlsberg taking 8% of the market and Budweiser 7% in 2014.\n\nDraught Irish stout is normally served nitrogenated, to create a creamy texture with a long-lasting head.\n\nCraft stouts available in Ireland include Shandon Stout by the Franciscan Well in Cork, O'Hara's Irish stout by Carlow Brewing Company, Black Rock Irish Stout by Dungarvan Brewing Company and Irish stout by Galway Hooker Brewery.\n\nThe ales produced in Ireland are now largely in the Irish red ale style, with a slight red colour, generally in the 3.8–4.4% ABV range (although export versions are often stronger). The largest national brand is Smithwick's, produced by the Diageo multinational. Others include Diageo's Macardle's, Franciscan Well's Rebel Red, Carlow Brewing Company's O'Hara's Irish Red and Messrs Maguire Rusty. Ireland's second-largest brewer, Heineken, no longer makes a red ale in Ireland, having discontinued local production of Murphy's Red and Beamish Red. Dungarvan Brewing Company's Copper Coast red ale was released in 2010, along with Clanconnel Brewery's McGrath's Irish Red. Eight Degrees brewery launched their Sunburnt Irish Red Ale in 2011.\n\nThe first lager brewery in Ireland was set up in Dartry, Dublin, in 1891, but did not survive very long. Lager was later brewed for a short period at the Regal Brewery, Kells. Harp Lager has been brewed since 1968, originally in Dundalk.\n\nHeineken Ireland, based at the Murphy Brewery in Cork, have the largest share of the lager market. In addition to Heineken, they brew Amstel and Coors Light, as well as the brands they acquired from Beamish & Crawford including Fosters and Carling.\n\nBeginning in the 1990s, brewpubs and microbreweries began to emerge. While some, such as the Biddy Early Brewery, Dublin Brewing Company and Dwan's, have since ceased production; others such as Porterhouse have celebrated twenty years in business, while the Hilden Brewery in Lisburn is Ireland's oldest independent brewer, having been established in 1981. The Carlow Brewing Company, established in 1996 and makers of the O'Hara's range, is another survivor of the \"first wave\" of Irish craft brewing.\n\nThe \"second wave\" began in the mid-2000s and has included the Beoir Chorca Dhuibhne brewery in County Kerry, Galway Hooker brewery in County Galway, Dungarvan Brewing Company, Clanconnel Brewery, Trouble Brewing, Metalman Brewing, The Dingle Brewing Company in County Kerry, Bo Bristle (formerly Breweyed), and the Galway Bay Brewery, which, like the Porterhouse Brewing Company, also runs its own chain of pubs.\n\nThe \"third wave\" of Irish craft brewing began in 2013. The surge of new breweries is largely a result of changes in excise requirements, access to EU funding, and an increase in government-funded brewing education courses. Many second- and third-wave brewers are also involved in a professional brewers' association, Beer Ireland, which has provided members with networking opportunities and information on setting up a brewery.\n\nAs of mid-2018, in addition to international/macro-breweries such as Guinness and Heineken, there were 75 independent Irish craft breweries in operation, and craft beer represented 2.8% of 2017 sales. This was an increase from approximately fifty breweries and a market share of 1.5% of beer sales by volume in Ireland in 2014.\n\nDespite the low market share, macro breweries have begun to produce product lines targeting this sector of the market. Heineken Ireland began marketing a pale ale, \"Cute Hoor\", distributed in the craft beer sections of supermarkets and off licences and without plainly identifying the brewer. Heineken also briefly marketed \"Blasket Blonde\", in Kerry, from March 2015 to September 2016, and \"Beanntrai Bru\" in Cork in August 2016, as locally-made craft beers, from invented breweries.\n\nC&C Group produce 'Roundstone' Ale and 'Pana Cork' Lager at their facility in Clonmel. Both Heineken Ireland and C&C were investigated for these naming practices in 2016 \n\nCarrig Brewing Company and Brú Brewery, both of which operated pubs in addition to brewing, merged operations in 2019 with brewing moved to Brú's facility in Trim, County Meath \n\nAs in other countries, international brewers and drinks companies have acquired independent craft breweries in Ireland, too, in order to either protect their market share or to expand their own portfolios. Cork's Franciscan Well Brewery was acquired by Molson Coors in 2013. It continues to brew the main Franciscan Well beers, but now also markets a mainstream lager, \"Archway\" with the parent firm name abbreviated to \"MCBC\" on packaging. The Eight Degrees Brewery was acquired by Irish Distillers, the producer of Jameson Irish Whiskey in 2018, in order to secure a supply of barrels used to brew stout and IPA for its \"Caskmates\" range.\n\nInvestment without full takeover has occurred at some breweries. 32% of the Carlow Brewing Company has been acquired by Hijos de Rivera Brewery, the makers of Estrella Galicia \n\nWhile Ireland has little history of the tied house system - outside of Cork where both major breweries had, but eventually disposed of, substantial estates - craft breweries have experienced problems in gaining taps in pubs. A number of craft breweries now operate pubs, on-site restaurants or entire pub chains to provide outlets with guaranteed availability. These include Brú Brewery, Carrig Brewing, Dead Centre Brewing, Galway Bay Brewery, The Porterhouse, Rascals Brewing and Rising Sons Brewery\n\nThere are three brewing associations operating in Ireland.\n\n\nBeoir (Irish for \"beer\"), founded in July 2010, is an independent group of consumers which seeks greater choice, quality, and value-for-money for beer and cider drinkers on the island of Ireland. Their primary goal is to support and raise awareness of Ireland's native independent microbreweries and craft cider-makers.\n\nA number of beers claim an Irish provenance or are commissioned by Irish companies, but are produced outside Ireland. In the past these have included Árainn Mhór beers and Time Lager. Today, the Strangford Lough Brewing Company produces a concentrated wort which they export to the UK and US where contract breweries turn it into finished beer.\n\nMany breweries outside Ireland produce Irish-themed beers which are not commonly available in Ireland, such as Killian's Irish Red and Wexford Cream Ale.\n\nIn 19th and early to mid-20th century Ireland, a spirit grocery combined a public house and an ancillary retail business, usually a grocery or hardware shop. Several spirit groceries can still be found in rural towns and villages.\n\n\n\n"}

They were one of the first Mexican-American groups to have a national hit record, \"Land of a Thousand Dances\", recorded on the Rampart label. They were the opening act on The Beatles' second American tour, backed up by the King Curtis band. They played at the historic Shea Stadium concert from August 15 to August 30 during the 1965 tour that was headlined by The Beatles.\n\nThey were discovered by Rampart Records label owner and founder Eddie Davis—and were among the 1960s Mexican-American musicians and singers who pioneered the \"East Side Sound\" of Los Angeles, a musical phenomenon that attracted international attention.\n\nFrankie (Cannibal) Garcia founded the group in 1964; the other group members were Bobby and Joe \"Yo Yo\" Jaramillo and Richard Lopez who were in the group for 18 months. in 1983 Frankie (Cannibal) Garcia retired from the music business and turned Cannibal and the Headhunters over to Robert Zapata who has been in the group since 1969 and still performing today.

[Barely out of high school, they came from Ramona Gardens and Estrada Courts Housing Projects of East Los Angeles, and were inspired by the African American doo wop groups in their neighborhoods. Garcia attended Andrew Jackson high, in East LA. He frequently sang spontaneously while walking around campus. He had a very strong voice. This group toured recorded and performed together for only eighteen months, when Frankie \"Cannibal\" Garcia hired two new background singers, Eddie Serrano and George Ochoa, as the new Headhunters.\nTheir version of \"Land of a Thousand Dances\" was a cover version of the original Chris Kenner tune, arranged and produced by Max Uballez with Frankie Garcia, and engineered by Bruce Morgan. The record reached #30 in the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart in early 1965. Wilson Pickett recorded the song into a national hit for himself in 1967, also using the \"na, na, na, na\" lyric.\n\nThe story of Frankie Garcia forgetting the lyrics to his hit song is urban folklore and was a story that Eddie Davis invented to explain the \"na na na na na\" phrase that Garcia came up with due to a bad mic cord that kept cutting off and on. On May 7, 1965, Cannibal and the Headhunters played a concert with the Rolling Stones, the Beach Boys, the Righteous Brothers, and Marty Robbins in Birmingham, Alabama, at Legion Field. Three months later Paul McCartney requested that Garcia and his group join the Beatles tour, August 15 through August 31, 1965, at Shea Stadium New York and at the Hollywood Bowl California.\n\nFrankie Garcia died in 1996, aged 49.

{"id": "2201910", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2201910", "title": "Lycée Français Charles de Gaulle", "text": "Lycée Français Charles de Gaulle\n\nThe Lycée Français Charles de Gaulle, usually referred to as the Lycée or the French Lycée, is a French co-educational primary and secondary independent day school, situated in South Kensington in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, London. It is managed by the Agency for French Teaching Abroad, AEFE, with its curriculum accredited by the French National Ministry of Education and overseen by the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nThere is a \"British Section\" for English-speaking pupils in the secondary classes, preparing for GCSEs and A-levels. In 2008 part of the school's primary classes were transferred to a site in Fulham, the \"Marie d'Orliac\" school. There are three other primary \"feeder\" schools elsewhere in London, the André Malraux school in Ealing and Wix School in Clapham and the associated Collège Français Bilingue de Londres (CFBL) in Kentish Town.\n\nThe Lycée International de Londres Winston Churchill, opened in 2015 in the former Brent Town Hall in Wembley, is a separate entity.\n\nThe school occupies a substantial site in Cromwell Road, opposite the Natural History Museum and backs onto Harrington Road. The school was refurbished in 2008 and again in 2011. The acquisition of a lease on the Grade II listed former Peterborough School site in Clancarty Road, Fulham, has enabled part of the South Kensington primary classes to transfer there and vacate space for more secondary pupils at the main site.\n\nThe school was founded as the French School of London, largely through the efforts of Marie d'Orliac (), with backing from the University of Lille for Belgian and other francophone World War I refugees in 1915 near London's Victoria station and provided a full education for 120 pupils. In 1920, the renamed Lycée Français de Londres relocated to Cromwell Gardens, opposite the Victoria and Albert Museum. In the late 1930s it moved again to a Neo-Georgian style purpose-built school building (AJ Thomas, assistant to EL Lutyens), adjacent to the \"Université des lettres françaises\" (French Institute) in Queensberry Place – another d'Orliac project – with its own entrance in Queensberry Mews. The aesthetics displayed in the architecture of Patrice Bonnet's 1939 French Institute were translated into small touches like the Art Deco designs of the termly \"Tableau d'honneur\" cards, (the roll of honour) given to pupils deemed to have worked hard. The designs became utilitarian in the fifties.\n\nDuring the Second World War, the Lycée pupils and their teachers were evacuated to Cumberland. The London buildings became offices for the Free French government in exile of General de Gaulle. Bombing raids on London destroyed buildings adjacent to the Lycée.\n\nPost-war development of the school was overseen by M. Augustin Gaudin, the \"Proviseur\" (headmaster), supported by his wife. The school and the French Institute were initially seen as largely synonymous, and remained heavily interdependent in the post-war years, and into the 1970s. Their close relations came to an end with French administrative reforms and the introduction of modern management and accounting techniques in the 1980s. Another notable feature of the time was that Lille University offered a first year of their humanities programme at the Lycée, for those completing the \"Terminales\" classes and arranged exchanges for teachers as well as pupils.\n\nThe school saw steady expansion during the post-war \"baby boom\". In 1947 three junior classes (jardin d'enfants, 12e and 11e) had opened in adapted rented accommodation at 29 The Boltons SW10, on the corner with Tregunter Road. The establishment formed a \"succursale\" (satellite) of the Lycée for a period of 15 years, and was known simply as \"The Boltons\". In 1952 an \"English Section\" for British or UK-based pupils was established: it was later renamed the \"British Section\". The bombed terraces directly opposite the Natural History Museum on Cromwell Road, which had been temporarily converted into tennis courts, were acquired by the French government, and a major development of this site was undertaken between 1955 and 1957. New facilities included modern science laboratories and multipurpose classrooms, and a spacious entrance hall at 35 Cromwell Road. The corner of Cromwell Road and Cromwell Place was occupied by the Royal College of Art, but after the Royal College moved to purpose-built premises on Kensington Gore in the 1980s, further terraced houses were gradually acquired by the French Government. Another temporary \"succursale\" in the Swinging Sixties was no. 6 Cromwell Place, SW7, home of the then \"English section\", watched over by Mme Thérèse Wright. Close neighbours in Cromwell Place were the French Institute's noted bi-lingual Secretarial College and the Alliance Française. In the days before IT, the Lycée library and yearly issue and collection of school textbooks – an enormous logistical exercise – was managed by Mme Betty Galitzine and later by Mme Babette Willmot. For decades, the Lycée's French stationery was procured by Neilson's in Harrington Road.\n\nAs the school grew, so the kitchens faced an increasing logistical challenge to produce upwards of 2000 hot meals daily on Lycée monogrammed china.\n\nIn 1962, President de Gaulle returned to the Lycée for a final visit, and was greeted by the entire school.\n\nWith the lull in construction, the school increased its interest in the arts, science, sport and travel. In 1966 a Lycée excursion was led by Mme Raphael to Paris to view the Picasso Retrospective exhibition at the Grand Palais. There were annual organised trips to Val d'Isère for skiing in spring, a Summer School in Pont Saint-Esprit, led by Jacques Iselin and tours of the Soviet Union in association with Dr. Sanger of Westminster School. The return by rail from one such trip was briefly, though alarmingly, delayed by the Soviet led Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia. Pupils put on plays, mostly in French, at the Institute's theatre (now the Ciné Lumière) and art exhibitions in the entrance halls of the 'Institut' and 35 Cromwell Road. The languages offered through the parallel curricula were Ancient Greek and Latin, German, Italian, Russian and Spanish. 'English Section' pupils took part in British school competitions in the recitation of Latin verse. Other pupils were successful in writing competitions organised by the Alliance Française. With the help of former Olympic standard PE teachers, the Lycée was noted for its competitive prowess on the sports field, in the water and in the gym: handball, rugby, basketball, tennis, even cricket (a French invention!), rowing, swimming, fencing and horse-riding.\n\nEach year, there was a steady stream of applicants to Oxbridge and to the Grandes écoles and places taken up to study architecture, economics, engineering, medicine, music and science in France, the UK and the USA. To underscore the importance of Franco-British understanding, the Alliance Française annually sponsored a special award to one pupil for \"Camaraderie Franco-Britannique\".\n\nThe wave of student revolutions of 1968 brought about changes in the French educational system which were also felt in South Kensington. One change was the abolition of the Lycée's annual ceremonial prize-giving (originally in the Royal Festival Hall), latterly at the more convenient Royal Albert Hall. The ceremony used to be marked by an organ recital by the school's Master of Music, the former Notre Dame de Paris organist and composer Jean Dattas. This was followed by speeches from noted French academics. French ministries and businesses would sponsor generous expenditure on books which were then distributed as prizes to pupils of merit. The 1970s brought in their wake a Counterculture with its complex attitude to drug use. Like many other teaching establishments, the Lycée had its share of problems.\n\nThe continuing expansion of the school led to further occupation of the mews complex behind Cromwell Place. In the mid 1960s, there had still been horses stabled in the mews, and equine odours invaded classrooms on the east side of the site. The erection in 1984 of the Primary School building to Roeven Vardi's design, in the playground on Harrington Road, allowed the primary classes to be decanted out of their cramped conditions in Queensberry Place.\n\nIn 1980, the school was renamed the Lycée Français Charles de Gaulle, for the late French President, who had established his wartime offices in the decanted Lycée buildings.\n\nDue to limited space at the South Kensington site, the Lycée opened two \"feeder\" primary schools, based in Clapham and Ealing, in 1993 and 1995 respectively. Since May 1997, the Ealing \"satellite\" has been known as the École André Malraux, named after the French author and politician.\n\n2015 was the school's centenary. It symbolised the longevity of one cultural aspect of Franco-British cooperation along with its associated Grade II listed French Institute, a site of remarkable architectural heritage, the \"Ciné Lumiére\", the Alliance Française and the French Embassy all in close proximity in the UK's capital.\n\nThe Lycée caters for some 4,000 pupils between the ages of 3 and 19. The school is an important cultural centre for London's sizeable French-speaking community and one of the most academically successful French schools outside France. In addition to serving the francophone communities in London, 9% of pupils at the Lycée are English-speaking or of British heritage, placed in the school by parents opting for a bilingual education for their children. The Lycée continues to maintain a multicultural and international mix of pupils, from over 50 different nationalities.\n\nThe school charges fees that are subsidised by the French government in the case of French nationals only.\nThe teaching medium at the Lycée is predominantly French and follows French curricula. However, when pupils reach the \"troisième\" form, (equivalent to Year Ten or first year), they can opt either to stay in the French stream, as the majority do, and study for the Brevet and the Baccalauréat, or follow the modified English stream (64 students per year) and work towards GCSEs and A-levels. The Lycée's \"British Section\" has tended to achieve good exam results (see Academic results below) and has enabled pupils to enter Russell Group universities in the UK or universities abroad.\nThe Lycée maintains a strong commitment to sport and takes part in competitions with British schools, particularly in basketball and rugby.\nThe school has always put an accent on developing artistic talent alongside academic achievement. There is a very active art department and a school orchestra.\n\nOn 15 March 2020, the Lycée announced that the school in South Kensington and all of its London satellite locations would suspend lessons due to the COVID-19 pandemic: this was in line with policy in France, whereas most British schools remained open for a further week.\n\nIn April 2007, more than 400 students gathered outside the Lycée Francais Charles de Gaulle buildings in support of Thierry Grepinet, a popular teacher, after it was announced that he was being replaced by Natalie Routier, the wife of the then deputy head, Yves Routier.\n\nThe Lycée's primary school building in South Kensington, was used as a site for expatriate French citizens to cast their vote in the French presidential elections on 23 April 2017.\n\nThe entire school is subject to British Ofsted inspections to assess its overall performance, governance and the development and welfare of pupils including Safeguarding. The latest inspection conducted in June 2018 found that in all areas of inspection the Lycée was assessed as \"good\". The inspectors did however note a spike in unjustified absences among older pupils in the examination season.\n\nThe Lycée Français Charles de Gaulle is one of the best French schools abroad as shown by its outstanding results: \nBaccalauréat results 2010\n\nIn 2008, the English Section of the Lycée was ranked 15th in the Financial Times schools league table. It was ranked 16th in \"The Times\" schools league table.\n\n2010 A Level results:\n\n\nThere is an active alumni association, \"Les Anciens du Lycée Français Charles de Gaulle de Londres\" which organises events throughout each year. Together with the school, it celebrated the diamond jubilee of the \"British Section\" in 2012 in the presence of the British Secretary of State for Education and the French Ambassador.\n\n\n\n"}

Instituted in 1996, IIM Indore is the sixth addition to the Indian Institute of Management (IIM) family of management schools.\n\nIIM Indore, which came into existence in 1996, was established as the sixth Indian Institute of Management after IIM Calcutta (1961), IIM Ahmedabad (1961), IIM Bangalore (1973), IIM Lucknow (1984) and IIM Kozhikode (1996)\n\nIn 2011, IIM Indore launched Integrated Programme in Management (IPM). It is first of its kind programme in India aimed at attracting students who have passed higher secondary school. \n\nIIM Indore started offering its two-year full-time (residential) Post Graduate Programme in Management (PGP) at Ras al-Khaimah (UAE) in 2011. It is the first IIM to have started operations outside India. In 2013, IIM Indore shifted its Ras al-Khaimah operations to Dubai. However, in 2014, it shut down its operations in its UAE campus.\n\nThe institute also offers its two-year full-time (non-residential) Post Graduate Programme in Management (PGP) in Mumbai, from 2012. Till date, no IIM had a presence in the financial capital of India (Mumbai).\n\nIIM Indore offers the following academic programmes -\n\n\nOptions to specialise in various fields such as Finance, Operations, Marketing, Systems etc. are available.\n\nThe institute also offers various certificate programmes and Management Development Programmes (MDPs).\n\nIIM Indore has been recently accredited from the Association of MBAs (AMBA, a UK-based accreditation agency), for four full-time programmes - Two Year Post Graduate Programme in Management (both at Indore and Mumbai), One Year Full Time Executive Post Graduate Programme in Management (EPGP) and Five Year Integrated Programme in Management (IPM, 4th and 5th Year).\n\nAdmissions to the Post Graduate Programmes in Management (PGP) at Indore, Dubai(UAE) and Mumbai, is through the Common Admission Test (CAT) conducted by the IIMs. Non Resident Indian (NRI) candidates are also eligible to apply and should have scored a minimum GMAT score of 650 to be shortlisted for further evaluations. Admissions to the Executive Post Graduate Programme in Management (EPGP), a programme for executives with a minimum of 5 years work experience, is through the globally accepted GMAT. The candidates are shortlisted on the basis of their GMAT score, which on average has been 700 for the past batches, quality of work experience, extra-curricular record and future managerial potential.\n\nAdmission to the 5 year Integrated Programme in Management (IPM) is through the IPM Admission Test (IPMAT) conducted nationally as a preliminary examination followed by personal interview and WAT. A combination of both scores is used to select candidates. Over 20,000 students give the IPM AT annually from which only 120 are selected.\n\nThere are over 90 student exchange seats, which means that 20% of the PGP batch can spend an academic term in a foreign university. It is the 3rd highest number of seats across all IIMs. There are over 20 schools with whom IIM Indore has an exchange programme MOU - Germany, France, Belgium, Austria, US, UK, Australia, Malaysia, Philippines. It is one of the few IIMs to have a programme in Latin America (Brazil). On an average 50 students from foreign universities spend a term at IIM Indore. In 2019, IPM (five-year integrated program) started its first exchange on undergraduate level. In the first leg, more than 30 students (25% of batch) spent their term abroad in different universities of France, Germany, Finland, Latvia and Taiwan.\n\nThe institute had its first student exchange of six students with Ecole de Management de Lyon (EM Lyon), a business school based in Lyon, France, in 2005.\n\nThe One Year Full Time MBA (EPGP) collaborates with SDA Bocconi School of Management, Milan, Italy as part of exchange programme where the entire batch spends 1 full term for a five-week module to get a global perspective on management. The exchange programme introduces students to diverse subjects like Digital Transformation, Doing Business with Europe, Fashion and Luxury Management and Family Business Management. The international immersion for EPGP Programme is known as Advanced Leadership Programme. \nThe EPGP programme also has compulsory modules on Advanced Data Analytics which is taught in collaboration with Jigsaw Academy and Strategy Simulations (core course) offered by Harvard Business School.\n\nIIMI was ranked fifth among management schools in India by the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) in 2019 and sixth by The Week.\n\nIIM Indore has 106 full-time faculty and 65+ visiting faculty.\n\nThe institute operated out of a temporary campus in Rajendranagar in Indore till 2003, before moving to its current campus. On 3 October 1998, the foundation stone of the Indore campus was laid by Mukesh Ambani. The campus is located at Prabandh Shikhar, on Rau-Pithampur Road, close to the Pithampur Special Economic Zone, off Agra-Bombay Highway. Expansion plans include building more hostels to accommodate the growing number of post graduate and executive students, a state of the art sports complex and residential quarters for doctoral students.\n\nThe present campus started with 4 hostels each housing 60 students. As the intake has gradually increased, today, there are 18 hostels. Rooms in all the hostels have direct computer connectivity to the main LAN that provides an 1Gbit/s internet connectivity via National Knowledge Network. For the One Year Full Time MBA (EPGP) students, a separate hostel has been set up that can house almost 200 students – future proof for the substantial increase in intake planned. In addition to these, IIM Indore also has a Management Development Centre (MDC) which houses the MDP participants. A hostel dedicated to participants of Fellow Programme in Management (FPM) has been constructed recently. Refurbishment and renovation work also encompasses the main gate and several other buildings in the IIM campus such as staff quarters for the visiting faculty.\n\nThe IIMI Library holds knowledge resources predominantly related to management and allied subjects. The entire Library collection including the CD-ROM databases and the online databases are made available through Institute's network.

{"id": "2201931", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2201931", "title": "Matthew 5:21", "text": "Matthew 5:21\n\nMatthew 5:21 is the twenty-first verse of the fifth chapter of the Gospel of Matthew in the New Testament and is part of the Sermon on the Mount. It opens the first of what have traditionally been known as the Antitheses in which Jesus compares the current interpretation of a part of Mosaic Law with how it should actually be understood. This verse begins the discussion of murder.\n\nIn the King James Version of the Bible the text reads:\n\nThe World English Bible translates the passage as:\n\nFor a collection of other versions see BibleHub Matthew 5:21\n\nSchweizer notes that the opening line can be read as either \"men of old said\" or \"it was said to men of old.\" However every New Testament usage of the impersonal passive, as in this line, refers to the word of God. Albright and Mann note that it would have been more usual to have \"it was written\" rather than \"it was heard,\" they feel it was made aural so as to create a direct parallel with Jesus' words in the next verse. The ancient ones, or the ancestors, was in Greek used to primarily to refer to Greeks of the Heroic Age, but Albright and Mann note that among Greek speaking Jews it was a common expression for those who lived in the pre-Torah period. In this verse it fairly clearly refers to the Israelites after the Exodus.\n\nLike the original Hebrew version of the Ten Commandments the Greek here, \"phoneuo\" more accurately translates as murder or assassinate rather than kill. Jacques Ellul disagreed with this interpretation and declared that it covered all killing of other human beings. The original commandment does not have \"shall be in danger of the judgement,\" but this was commonly appended elsewhere, both in the Old Testament, such as at , , , , and also in the many commentaries on the Law. All of these refer to judgement on Earth, not to divine judgement, a concept that did not exist in early Judaism. Scholars agree that here judgment refers to legal proceedings. Albright and Mann note that the Greek here is ambiguous and it could be read as \"shall be in danger of performing judgment,\" but this reading makes little sense and the verse is always translated in the manner shown by the KJV and WEB.\n\nThe Evangelical Anglican Melvin Tinker writes, \"Well, let's think through how the religious leaders of the time, the morally respectable Pharisees would have taken it. Well, quite literally. Here is the sixth commandment which speaks against taking a life-murder. And the minimum requirement person comes to this and asks 'Who does it apply to?... Does it mean that capital punishment is out or is it all right to kill those who have already killed? And what about war, is what goes on there with a soldier killing another soldier murder or should we become pacifists? Then what about the unborn? Is abortion ever to be thought of as murder? Or think about those in a persistent vegetative state, they don't seem fully human, so is it right to pull the plug on them? And suppose that I don't actively take steps to kill a person, instead I just leave them there to die, is that murdering them?' The danger with those sort of questions is that we are really looking for some loophole, trying to find circumstances in which we can murder, the minimum requirement you see. But Jesus cuts through all of that. The reason it is wrong to murder is that it is wrong to hate your brother. Hatred is the internal trigger of which the wilful disposal of a life is the external consequence. In other words, Jesus goes beyond the externals to that which is internal-motive- what moves us to such acts. He goes to the heart of the problem which is the human heart.\"\n"}

In Poland it is grouped in the nalewka category of alcoholic beverages. Mass-produced versions of krupnik consist of 40–50% (80–100 proof) alcohol, but traditional versions will use 80–100% grain alcohol as the base. Honey, usually clover honey, is the main ingredient used to add sweetness, as well as up to 50 different herbs. There are many versions and some recipes have been passed down through generations; each producer typically uses their own recipe. Krupnik originated in the territories of present-day Belarus, which were at the time part of the larger Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Krupnik is sometimes heated before being served.\n\nLegend has it that the recipe was created by the Benedictine monks at a monastery in Niaśviž (then known as \"Nieśwież\") which was founded by Mikołaj Krzysztof \"Sierotka\" Radziwiłł. Known in Poland and Lithuania (including present-day Belarus) at least since the 16th century, it soon became popular among the szlachta of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. There are numerous recipes preserved up to present times in countless diaries of the szlachta. Krupnik was also used as a common medicinal disinfectant by Polish soldiers in World War II.\n\nAt times, spicy seasonings and herbs are added for flavour. The brand of the honey and the ratio of seasonings are key factors which determine the final taste of krupnik. A mixture of the honey and spices is diluted, boiled and strained before being added to a vodka base.\nIt may be served hot, at room temperature or chilled. A specific sort of krupnik which contains more herbs and less honey is brewed by Karaims.\n\n\"Krupnik\" is also the brand name of a range of alcoholic beverages produced by the Belvédère company, including krupnik, vodka, and various \"nalewki\". In 2014, Krupnik vodka was the eighth most popular vodka brand in the world by sales volume.\n\n"}

{"id": "2201951", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2201951", "title": "Turn! Turn! Turn! (album)", "text": "Turn! Turn! Turn! (album)\n\nTurn! Turn! Turn! is the second album by the folk rock band the Byrds and was released in December 1965 on Columbia Records (\"see\" 1965 in music). Like its predecessor, \"Mr. Tambourine Man\", the album epitomized the folk rock genre and continued the band's successful mix of vocal harmony and jangly twelve-string Rickenbacker guitar. The album's lead single and title track, \"Turn! Turn! Turn!\", was a Pete Seeger adaptation of text from the Book of Ecclesiastes that had previously been arranged in a chamber-folk style by the band's lead guitarist Jim McGuinn, while working with folksinger Judy Collins. The arrangement that McGuinn used for the Byrds' version utilized the same folk rock style as the band's previous hit singles.\n\nThe album peaked at number 17 on the \"Billboard\" Top LPs chart and went to number 11 in the United Kingdom. The \"Turn! Turn! Turn!\" single preceded the album by two months and topped the chart in the United States. Another single taken from the album, \"Set You Free This Time\", was less successful and failed to break into the U.S. Top 50.\n\nThe album marked an increase in McGuinn's songwriting output and rhythm guitarist David Crosby received his first writing credit on a Byrds' album. However, the band's prolific songwriter Gene Clark still contributed most of the original material. The album also included two Bob Dylan covers: \"The Times They Are a-Changin'\" and the then unreleased song, \"Lay Down Your Weary Tune\". \"Turn! Turn! Turn!\" would be the last Byrds' album to feature the full participation of Gene Clark until the release of the original quintet's 1973 reunion album, \"Byrds\".\n\nIn the wake of the international success of their debut album and the hit singles \"Mr. Tambourine Man\" and \"All I Really Want to Do\", the Byrds entered Columbia Studios in Hollywood on June 28, 1965 to set about recording their follow-up album. By the latter half of 1965, the folk rock trend that the band had been instrumental in originating was gaining pace, with hit records by the likes of Cher, the Turtles, We Five, and Barry McGuire clearly bearing the hallmarks of the Byrds' influence. Despite being such an influential band, the Byrds had been disappointed with the relative lack of success that their second single \"All I Really Want to Do\" had achieved in the American charts and felt that they needed a strong third single in order to maintain their foothold in the marketplace.\n\nInitially, the band had elected to record a third Bob Dylan cover, \"It's All Over Now, Baby Blue\", as their next single, but despite a couple of attempts to record the song in June and August 1965, it was ultimately rejected. The band then briefly considered issuing a version of Dylan's \"The Times They Are a-Changin'\" as a single instead, but this idea was also discarded, although the song does appear on \"Turn! Turn! Turn!\" The song finally selected by the band for their third single was Pete Seeger's \"Turn! Turn! Turn!\", a musical adaptation of words taken from the Biblical Book of Ecclesiastes, which would return the group to the top of the \"Billboard\" Hot 100.\n\nThe recording of the album was not without its tensions, with several members of the band expressing feelings of resentment towards the close working relationship that was beginning to form between McGuinn and producer Terry Melcher. Rhythm guitarist David Crosby was particularly vocal in his disapproval, since he felt that McGuinn and Melcher (along with the band's manager Jim Dickson) were conspiring to keep his songs off of the album. Crosby had brought the self-penned \"Stranger In a Strange Land\" (later released by Blackburn & Snow) and \"The Flower Bomb Song\", along with Dino Valenti's \"I Don't Ever Want to Spoil Your Party\" (later released by Quicksilver Messenger Service as \"Dino's Song\") to the recording sessions, but all three songs were rejected and remained unreleased at the time.\n\nTension was also developing between the band's principal songwriter, Gene Clark, and the rest of the Byrds due to the higher level of income Clark was receiving from his songwriting. This resulted in Clark becoming increasingly isolated within the band and some of his best songs being relegated to appearances on B-sides or being left unreleased altogether. Ultimately, this resentment would be a contributing factor in Clark's departure from the band in early 1966.\n\nYet another source of conflict was the power struggle that was developing between Melcher and Dickson. For his part, Dickson had aspirations to produce the band himself, which led to him being overly critical of Melcher's production work and would culminate in Melcher's dismissal as the band's producer following completion of the album.\n\n\"Turn! Turn! Turn!\" opens with the Pete Seeger penned title track, which had been issued as a single two months ahead of the release of the album. Based on an arrangement that McGuinn had developed while working on Judy Collins' 1963 album, \"Judy Collins 3\", the idea of reviving the song came to McGuinn during the Byrds' first American tour. The master recording of the song reputedly took 78 takes, spread over five days of recording, to perfect. \"Rolling Stone\" editor David Fricke has commented that the song's plea for peace and tolerance was custom-made for the 1960s, a decade colored by assassinations, urban rioting and the horrors of the Vietnam War. Peaking at number 1 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, the single represented the high-water mark of folk rock as a musical trend and reinforced the Byrds' standing as a commercial chart act.\n\nThe Byrds also chose to include two Bob Dylan songs on the album, in an attempt to repeat the success that they had enjoyed with their covers of his material on their debut LP. \"Lay Down Your Weary Tune\" was an unreleased outtake from Dylan's \"The Times They Are a-Changin'\" album that had been obtained by the band through Dylan's publisher. Dylan himself was impressed when he heard the band's reading of his song, telling McGuinn, \"Up until I heard this I thought you were just another imitator...but this has got real feeling to it.\" The other Dylan song that the band included on \"Turn! Turn! Turn!\" was \"The Times They Are a-Changin'\", which the band's biographer Johnny Rogan has described as a sardonic reading of the protest anthem, which subverted the seriousness evident in the original and replaced it with irony.\n\nOf the self-penned material on the album, three songs were written by Clark, including \"The World Turns All Around Her\", which echoed his Beatlesque songs of tortured romance on the band's debut album, and \"If You're Gone\", a poetic confession of emotional insecurity. To highlight the wistful melancholy of \"If You're Gone\", McGuinn and Melcher devised a droning, Gregorian harmony part that sounds uncannily like another instrument and foreshadowed the raga rock experimentation that the band would undertake on their next album. The third Clark-penned song on \"Turn! Turn! Turn!\" was \"Set You Free This Time\", a densely worded rumination on a failed relationship that lyrically exhibited the influence of Dylan. The song had been written by Clark during the Byrds' 1965 tour of England, after a night spent drinking with Paul McCartney at the fashionable Scotch of St James club in London.\n\nMcGuinn's songwriting contributions to the album included \"It Won't Be Wrong\", a song that had been co-written with McGuinn's friend Harvey Gerst in 1964. The song had previously been issued in a completely different version under the alternate title of \"Don't Be Long\" on a 1964 single that the band had released under the pseudonym of the Beefeaters. Another of McGuinn's contributions was an adaptation of the traditional folk song \"He Was a Friend of Mine\". The Byrds' version featured newly written lyrics by McGuinn dealing with the assassination of President John F. Kennedy on November 22, 1963. The song pre-dated the formation of the Byrds, as McGuinn explained to Rogan in 1977: \"I wrote that song the night John F. Kennedy was assassinated. I suppose you could say it's one of the earliest Byrds songs.\" \"He Was a Friend of Mine\" is notable for being the first Byrds' recording to feature McGuinn playing an acoustic guitar, instead of his usual twelve-string Rickenbacker.\n\n\"Turn! Turn! Turn!\" also featured the McGuinn and Crosby song \"Wait and See\". This represented the first release of a song written by the pair, although they had previously collaborated on \"The Airport Song\", a track that wouldn't be heard publicly until the release of the \"Preflyte\" album in 1969. \"Wait and See\" also represented the first time that Crosby had received a songwriting credit on a Byrds' album. Both men wanted to move away from the simple boy/girl romance songs that the band had been writing since 1964, but Rogan has pointed out that \"Wait and See\" was even more in that tradition than the earliest of Gene Clark's songs.\n\nAnother cover that was included on the album was \"Satisfied Mind\", a 1955 country and western chart-topper for Porter Wagoner, which had been suggested by the Byrds' bass player, Chris Hillman. The song was the first sign of the band's interest in country music, a genre they would explore further on subsequent albums, culminating with 1968's \"Sweetheart of the Rodeo\".\n\nAs with the band's previous album, \"Turn! Turn! Turn!\" ended on a quirky, tongue-in-cheek note, with a whimsical send-up of Stephen Foster's 19th century classic, \"Oh! Susannah\", arranged by McGuinn. Despite being recorded as an intentionally humorous reading of the song, McGuinn later admitted to journalist Vincent Flanders that he was dissatisfied with the track, stating, \"That was a joke, but it didn't come off, it was poorly told.\"\n\nDue to the infighting caused by the other band members' resentment of Clark's songwriting dominance within the Byrds, two of the songs that Clark had brought to the recording sessions were excluded from the album. Clark's romantic and densely worded \"She Don't Care About Time\", which featured guitar work inspired by Bach's \"Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring\", was issued on the B-side of the \"Turn! Turn! Turn!\" single, while the Dylanesque \"The Day Walk (Never Before)\" was left to languish in the Columbia tape vaults for more than 20 years. The song was finally issued in 1987, when it was chosen as the title track of the Byrds' archival album, \"Never Before\". In the modern era, both \"She Don't Care About Time\" and \"The Day Walk (Never Before)\" have been added to the remastered \"Turn! Turn! Turn!\" CD as bonus tracks.\n\n\"Turn! Turn! Turn!\" was released on December 6, 1965 in the United States (catalogue item CL 2454 in mono, CS 9254 in stereo) and March 22, 1966 in the UK (catalogue item BPG 62652 in mono, SBPG 62652 in stereo). It peaked at number 17 on the \"Billboard\" Top LPs chart, during a chart stay of 40 weeks, and reached number 11 in the United Kingdom, spending a total of 5 weeks on the UK chart. The preceding \"Turn! Turn! Turn!\" single was released on October 1, 1965 in the U.S., and October 29, 1965 in the UK, reaching number 1 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and number 26 on the UK Singles Chart. A second single taken from the album, \"Set You Free This Time\" (b/w \"It Won't Be Wrong\"), was released on January 10, 1966 in the U.S., peaking at number 63 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, but failing to chart in the UK.\n\nThe album's front cover photograph was taken by Guy Webster at his studio in Beverly Hills, California, and was later nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Album Cover. The LP's back cover liner notes were written by the Byrds' publicist, Derek Taylor, and were actually an edited version of a much longer description of the album and its recording that would later appear in its complete form in the February 15, 1966 edition of \"Record World\" magazine.\n\nUpon release, the album garnered mostly positive reviews, with Robert Shelton commenting in \"The New York Times\" that the album was \"not so strong as the first Byrds LP, \"Mr. Tambourine Man\", but still an effective program of folk-rock.\" \"Billboard\" magazine described the album's contents by stating that \"the group offers a diversified program of material that is certain to soar up the LP charts.\" In the UK, Richard Bruce enthusiastically praised the album in his review for \"Music Echo\" by describing the record as \"so sensationally brilliant that even after [one] hearing, I've no hesitation in saying they are proving they have as big a talent as the Beatles and the Stones!\"\n\nIn more recent years, Richie Unterberger has written on the AllMusic website that the album \"was only a disappointment in comparison with \"Mr. Tambourine Man\". It was still quite good, however, particularly the ringing number one title cut, a classic on par with the \"Mr. Tambourine Man\" single.\"\n\nIt was voted number 934 in Colin Larkin's All Time Top 1000 Albums 3rd Edition (2000). \n\n\"Turn! Turn! Turn!\" was remastered at 20-bit resolution and partially remixed as part of the Columbia/Legacy Byrds series. It was reissued in an expanded form on April 30, 1996, with seven bonus tracks, including two alternate versions of songs included on the original album, three outtakes, and the Clark penned B-side, \"She Don't Care About Time\".\n\n\"Turn! Turn! Turn!\" was one of four Byrds albums that were partially remixed as part of their re-release on Columbia/Legacy. The reason for the remix was explained by Bob Irwin (who produced these re-issues for compact disc) during an interview:\n\nHe further stated:\n\nIrwin's assertions that no liberties were taken have been proven false in a couple of instances. The vocals on most of the album's songs are mixed noticeably higher than they were on the original mixes and the fades are different on almost every song as well.\n\nMany fans enjoy the remixed album because it is very close to the original mix in most cases and offers noticeably better sound quality. However, there are also a lot of fans who dismiss the remix as revisionist history and prefer to listen to the original mix on vinyl or on the pre-1996 CD releases.\n\n\n\n\n\nSources:\n\nThe Byrds\n\nAdditional personnel\n\n"}

Epidemic had started from the capture of the Russian ships of line \"Vladislav\" during the Battle of Hogland in 1788. From the captured sailors the disease had spread widely into the fleet during its prolonged stay at Sveaborg in 1788 was carried with the fleet to Karlskrona later that year. Fitting ships for the sealing season proceeded very slowly and was greatly hindered by the losses suffered due to the illness to the crews. From December 1788 to September 1789 total of 26,249 were treated for sickness in naval hospitals at Karlskrona alone of whom 5,286 perished while the total death toll of the epidemics is assumed to be around 15,000 lives. By the end of June thousands of soldiers had to be sent from the infantry as reinforcements for the fleet. Regardless of the obstacles Admiral Otto Henrik Nordenskiöld who was responsible for refitting was able to ready fleet of 21 ships of the line and 8 frigates for sailing already for 6 June however without crews.\n\nThe Russian fleet had spent the winter of 1788–1789 in split into several elements at Copenhagen, Reval and Kronstadt. Together with newly built ships and effective repairs of ships damaged earlier the Russians were looking to be able to deploy around 40 ships capable to taking part to battle line with combined crew of roughly 30 000 men. Admiral Samuel Grieg who had commanded the Russian fleet at the Battle of Hogland had perished in the autumn 1788 and Admiral Von Dessin who had commanded the elements of the Russian fleet deployed to Copenhagen was removed from command. They were replaced respectively with Admirals Vasili Chichagov and Timofei Kozljaninov. The goal for the Russian naval operations in 1789 was to link together the separated fleet elements and then engage the Swedish fleet as soon as possible while meanwhile providing forces to uphold the blockades of the shipping routes along the Finnish coast.\n\nLack of crews prevented the Swedish fleet from any training or exercises and it was effectively confined to the docks. The fleet was finally able to set sail on 6 July despite that several ships were still undermanned, several lacking more than hundred men from their complements. Having assembled 21 ships of the line and 8 large frigates under his flag, Prince Karl, Duke of Södermanland decided to intercept the Russian fleet near the island of Öland before the elements of the Russian fleet would be able to link up. Admiral Otto Henrik Nordenskjöld acted as flag-captain to the Duke Charles.\n\nAfter setting sail the Swedish fleet patrolled the waters between Skåne, Rügen, Bornholm and Själland in the southern Baltic Sea. Fleet was still not clean from diseases (mainly the relapsing fever) and several small dispatch vessels were used for shipping healthy men to fleet while transporting ever growing number of sick back to Karlskrona. On 23 July did the Swedish fleet receive news that 35 ship strong Russian fleet had been seen outside of Gotland and finally at noon on 25 July were the first Russian ships sighted. Both fleets took northernly heading and Swedish tried to close in the distance.\n\nThe Russian fleet attempted to slip between the Swedes and Karlskrona but when it became clear that it would not succeed the Russians were content with just keeping distance to the Swedes. Winds were getting stronger which prevented either side from taking action later on 25 July 1789. On morning of 26 July fleets again sighted each other and Swedes again attempted to close in and engage the Russian but were unable to do so as the Russian fleet carefully avoided it. Further problem for the Swedes was that the rear-guard commanded by Admiral Per Liljehorn had become separated from the rest of the fleet and did not rejoin it despite of repeatedly being ordered to do so.\n\nThe Russian fleet continued evading the Swedish trying to slip between the Swedes and their home port. Finally by 1400 on 26 July had first ships reached the cannon range and started the battle. Varying winds forced battle to be paused between 1600 and 1800 but it was later commenced again. Fighting continued until 2000 when the Russian fleet turned towards east. Swedish fleet was unable to follow as the undermanned crews could not handle both guns and sails simultaneously. During the battle the fleets remained fair distance apart and the cannons were fired near their maximum ranges and thus had very little effect. Misfiring cannons and barrel explosions were the main cause of losses on both sides. During the fight three trailing ships of the Russian fleet were left separated from the rest of the fleet. Several Swedish ships were ordered to engage these stragglers but the Swedish ships turned away before even reaching the cannon range. Captains of the ships later claimed that they turned away from the Russian ships according to orders from Admiral Per Liljehorn who kept his ships away from the fight.\n\nSwedes were able to receive reinforcements and ship out the sick on 28 July after which the Swedish turned again to chase the Russians but without success as the Russians repeatedly avoided engaging the Swedish fleet. Similar action was repeated on following days until on 30 July the continuously worsening sickness amongst the crews forced the Swedes to seriously consider returning to their base as roughly 2 500 men had gotten sick after the fleet had set sail. On 31 July the wind turned which was seen as favorable for arrival of the Russian squadron from Copenhagen. To avoid being caught between two Russian fleets the Swedish fleet started back towards Karlskrona. On the same day the Russian squadron from Copenhagen joined with the Russian fleet.\n\nFor three days the fleets maneuvered within sight of each other, but finally the Swedes retreated to the naval base at Karlskrona. The battle ended in a draw, but the Russians remained in control of the Baltic Sea. The epidemic that still had not ended at Karlskrona then confined the Swedish fleet to its anchorage for most of the remainder of the year. \n\nPer Liljehorn was stripped of his admiral's rank even before the fleet returned to Karlskrona. Suspicions concerning Liljehorn arose after the debacle; it was widely suspected that the Russians had bribed him. A court martial convicted him but the government declined to execute him. Chichagov too was investigated for his inaction and avoidance of battle. However, the court martial found him not found guilty because his orders explicitly stated that he should first rendezvous with the Russian squadron from Copenhagen before engaging the Swedish fleet.\n\n\"Wladislaff\" 76<br>\n\"Enigheten\" 74<br>\n\"Götha Lejon\" 74<br>\n\"Kung Adolf Fredrik\" 74<br>\n\"Kung Gustaf III\" 74<br>\n\"Louise Ulrika\" 74<br>\n\"Sophia Magdalena\" 74<br>\n\"Fäderneslandet\" 66<br>\n\"Äran\" 64<br>\n\"Dristigheten\" 64<br>\n\"Dygden\" 64<br>\n\"Försightigheten\" 64<br>\n\"Hedvig Elisabeth Charlotta\" 64<br>\n\"Manligheten\" 64<br>\n\"Ömheten\" 64<br>\n\"Prins Carl\" 64<br>\n\"Prins Fredrik Adolf\" 64<br>\n\"Tapperheten\" 64<br>\n\"Rättvisan\" 62<br>\n\"Wasa\" 62<br>\n\"Riksens Ständer\" 60<br>\n\"Gripen\" 44<br>\n\"Uppland\" 44<br>\n\"Euredice\" 40<br>\n\"Fröya\" 40<br>\n\"Galathea\" 40<br>\n\"Minerva\" 40<br>\n\"Thetis\" 40<br>\n\"Zemire\" 40\n\n\"Rostislav\" 100<br>\n\"Dvyenadtsat Apostolov\" 100<br>\n\"Knyaz Vladimir\" 100<br>\n\"Iezekiil\" 78<br>\n\"Kir Ioann\" 74<br>\n\"Mstislav\" 74<br>\n\"Pobyedoslav\" 74<br>\n\"Prints Gustav\" 74<br>\n\"Sv.

Morbidity is 100% in non-vaccinated flocks. Mortality varies according to the virus strain (up to 60% in non-vaccinated flocks). Respiratory signs will subdue within two weeks. However, for some strains, a kidney infection may follow, causing mortality by toxemia. Younger chickens may die of tracheal occlusion by mucus (lower end) or by kidney failure. The infection may prolong in the cecal tonsils.\n\nIn laying hens, there can be transient respiratory signs, but mortality may be negligible. However, egg production drops sharply. A great percentage of produced eggs are misshapen and discolored. Many laid eggs have a thin or soft shell and poor albumen (watery), and are not marketable or proper for incubation. Normally-colored eggs, indicative of normal shells for instance in brown chickens, have a normal hatchability.\n\nEgg yield curve may never return to normal. Milder strains may allow normal production after around eight weeks.\n\nIBV was the first coronavirus described and varies greatly genetically and phenotypically, with hundreds of serotypes and strains described. The most updated classification of IBV places the virus in Coronaviridae, Orthocoronavirinae, genus \"Gammacoronavirus\", subgenus \"Igacovirus.\" The coronaviruses contain the largest known viral RNA genome in number of nucleotides, of approximately 30,000 bases. The RNA forms a single strand and single segment. IBV diversity is based on transcriptional error, which may become very relevant if occurring in genomic sequences coding for proteins, involved in adsorption to target cell or inducing immune responses. Transcriptional error variants may emerge with evolutional advantage in susceptible chickens. Large genomic changes will occur with entire gene interchanges, by reassortment, as for its replication, seven subgenomic mRNAs are produced and will enable reassortment in coinfections.\n\nChicken respiratory diseases are difficult to differentiate and may not be diagnosed based on respiratory signs and lesions. Other diseases such as mycoplasmosis by Mycoplasma gallisepticum (chronic respiratory disease), Newcastle disease by mesogenic strains of Newcastle diseases virus (APMV-1), \"Avian metapneumovirus\", infectious laryngotracheitis, avian infectious coryza in some stages may clinically resemble IB. Similar kidney lesions may be caused by different etiologies, including other viruses, such as infectious bursal disease virus (the cause of Gumboro disease) and toxins (for instance ochratoxins of Aspergillus ochraceus), and dehydration. \n\nIn laying hens, abnormal and reduced egg production are also observed in Egg Drop Syndrome 76 (EDS), caused by an Atadenovirus and avian metapneumovirus infections. At present, IB is more common and far more spread than EDS. The large genetic and phenotypic diversity of IBV have been resulting in common vaccination failures. In addition, new strains of IBV, not present in commercial vaccines, can cause the disease in IB vaccinated flocks. Attenuated vaccines will revert to virulence by consecutive passage in chickens in densely populated areas, and may reassort with field strains, generating potentially important variants. \n\nDefinitive diagnosis relies on viral isolation and characterization. For virus characterization, the methodology using genomic amplification (PCR), firstly by the reverse transcription of viral RNA into cDNA, the cyclic amplification of cDNA and sequencing of products, will enable very precise description of strains, according to the oligonucleotide primers designed and target gene. Broadly sensitive universal gene targets are the nucleoprotein, the matrix or the S2 encoding genes. The S1 encoding gene products sequencing may enable phylogenetic results which are comparable to serotyping. Methods for IBV antigens detection may employ labelled antibodies, such as direct immunofluorescence or immunoperoxidase. Antibodies to IBV may be detected by indirect immunofluorescent antibody test, ELISA and Haemagglutination inhibition (haemagglutinating IBV produced after enzymatic treatment by phospholipase C).\n\nNo specific treatment is available, but antibiotics can be used to prevent secondary infections.\n\nVaccines are available (ATCvet codes: for the inactivated vaccine, for the live vaccine; plus various combinations).\n\nBiosecurity protocols including adequate isolation, disinfection are important in controlling the spread of the disease.\n\n"}

The arena was named for Stafford Morgan Blackham, former dean of the Department of Animal Husbandry at SLI, and as such it was built to host livestock exhibitions as well as athletics (in a similar manner to the usage of LSU's Parker Coliseum). It replaced the 1,500-seat Earl K. Long Gymnasium as home to the athletics teams. It remained the home for the men's team until the Cajundome was completed in 1984.

{"id": "2201986", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2201986", "title": "Giovanni Picchi", "text": "Giovanni Picchi\n\nGiovanni Picchi (1571 or 1572 – 17 May 1643) was an Italian composer, organist, lutenist, and harpsichordist of the early Baroque era. He was a late follower of the Venetian School, and was influential in the development and differentiation of instrumental forms which were just beginning to appear, such as the sonata and the ensemble canzona; in addition he was the only Venetian of his time to write dance music for harpsichord.\n\nLittle is known about Picchi's early life, but his birthdate (1571 or 1572) can be inferred from his death record which states that he was 71 when he died on 17 May 1643. The earliest documentary evidence pertaining to him, unusually enough, is a picture: he appears as a lutenist on the title page of a 1600 dance manual by Fabritio Caroso (\"Nobilità di dame\"). Sometime before February 1607 he was hired as organist at the Venetian church of the Frari, and from 1623 to his death he was also organist at the confraternity Scuola di San Rocco, the most prestigious and wealthy of all the Venetian confraternities. In 1624 he applied for the position of second organist at St. Mark's, but Giovanni Pietro Berti was chosen instead.\n\nHe was a close contemporary of Monteverdi, being born four years later and dying six months earlier than the more renowned composer.\n\nOf Picchi's music, mostly instrumental music survives. One harpsichord \"toccata\" is included in the \"Fitzwilliam Virginal Book\" (how it got there is not known – very little Italian music is included in that English collection); three \"passamezzos\" survive in a manuscript from Turin; and in 1619 he published a collection of harpsichord dances, \"Intavolatura di balli d'arpicordo\". In addition, he published a collection of 19 ensemble \"canzonas\" in 1625, \"Canzoni da sonar\". A sole motet survives in Ghirlanda sacra 1625.\n\nHis harpsichord dances are of three types: dances in triple meter, dances in triple meter paired with \"saltarellos,\" and pieces which use a ground bass. Most of the works with ground bass use some type of \"romanesca\" pattern, consisting of a line descending by fourth, rising by step, then descending again by fourth or fifth, rising by step, and so forth (the Pachelbel Canon, probably written several decades after Picchi's death, is probably the most famous example of variations over a \"romanesca\" bass).\n\nWithin his ensemble \"canzonas,\" Picchi worked to differentiate several types of instrumental writing which were critically important to later forms such as the concerto. In particular, he used well-defined concertino, ritornello, and cadenzas in his ensemble music, following and further developing a practice initiated in the music of Giovanni Gabrieli and the other composers of his generation. His writing for concertino groups was probably the most innovative aspect of his style, and foreshadowed the work of composers in the middle Baroque such as Corelli. Picchi used both sequential variation and echo effects, and scored for a variety of instruments including violins, bassoons, recorders and trombones, often in the same piece.\n\nPicchi seems to have used the terms \"canzona\" and \"sonata\" interchangeably, sometimes calling a piece \"canzona\" in the score and \"sonata\" in the part book; the differentiation of these forms was only just beginning in the early 17th century.\n\n"}

It is considered the most famous metal band in its country.\n\nThe guitarist Walter Giardino replaced Osvaldo Civile in V8 for a little time, and left the band when his songs were rejected. His friend Roberto Cosseddu, bassist of Kamikaze, helped him to record a demo tape with those songs. The drummer Gustavo Rowek, who had also left V8 a short time before, declined his projects with Civile and joined Giardino. The session musicians Rodolfo Cava (singer) and Yulie Ruth (bass player) completed the line-up that recorded the demo. The songs were \"Chico callejero\", \"Rompe el hechizo\", \"Gente del sur\" and \"La bruja blanca\". Seeking stable members, the band took Saúl Blanch as singer, who was working in the hard rock band Plus. They met the bass player Guillermo Sánchez with the help of Giardino's friend Sergio Berdichevsky, member of WC at that point. \n\nRata Blanca made their first concert on August 15, 1987 in the Luz y Fuerza theater. Saúl Blanch left the band, and he was replaced by Carlos Périgo, who composed the song \"Días Duros\". Périgo left the band soon after that. Rodolfo Cava returned for a brief time, and Shito Molina got ill and could not sing anymore. As the band was about to record their first album and needed a singer immediately, Saúl Blanch returned to the band and helped record it. The album \"Rata Blanca\" was released in 1988, with nine songs. On that year they took part in the \"Halley en Obras\" concert, along with Alakrán, JAF and Kamikaze.\n\nPolygram requested that the band could create an album which would have high sales in the first semester to renew the contract, and the band made fourfold the required number of sales. The keyboard player Hugo Bistolfi joined the band in 1989, and the singer Adrián Barilari replaced Saúl Blanch. The band subsequently made their second album \"Magos, espadas y rosas\", which contained the popular songs \"Mujer amante\" and \"La leyenda del hada y el mago\". It was a successful release, and in its wake the band appeared in the TV show \"Ritmo de la Noche\", and played in cumbia concert halls because typical rock venues could not accommodate their large audiences. \n\nThe album was followed by \"Guerrero del Arco Iris\", and a concert at the José Amalfitani stadium. The band ended their contract with Polygram recording a live album, made at the Opera Theater with an orchestra, but this album was released years later. Once in BMG they made an EP called \"El Libro Oculto\". This work was more aggressive, both in instrumental style and lyrical style, as a result of the criticism from heavy metal fans towards the band.\n\nBarilari did not like the new style found in \"El Libro Oculto\" and left the band after a concert in Obras. Bistolfi followed him, and both of them created the band Alianza. \n\nBarilari and Bistolfi were replaced by Mario Ian on vocals and Javier Retamozo on keyboards. With this line-up they released \"Entre el Cielo y el Infierno\" (\"Between Heaven and Hell\"). Later that year, they were invited to play in the \"Festival Monsters of Rock\" in São Paulo, Brazil, along with Ozzy Osbourne, Therapy?, and Alice Cooper. They released another album with new singer Gabriel Marian called \"Rata Blanca VII\". The group disbanded in late 1997. Gustavo Rowek and Sergio Berdichevsky created the band Nativo, and Giardino continued with Walter Giardino Temple. \n\nBarilari and Bistolfi were invited to a concert of Walter Giardino Temple in 2000, which led to a reunion of the band. Rowek and Berdichevsky refused to be part of the reunion. The radio La Mega aired frequently the old \"Mujer amante\" song, generating a renewed interest in the band. The new album, \"El camino del fuego\", released in 2002, was a huge success. Its follow-up, the 2005 album \"La Llave de la Puerta Secreta\" had great sales and went into Gold even before being officially released.\n\nRata Blanca played with famous member of Deep Purple Glenn Hughes as a guest at the Gran Rex Theater, in 2003. They played the band's hits as well as Deep Purple's classic songs. In order to gain a more international profile, Giardino approached former Rainbow singer Doogie White to record an English version of the \"Forgotten Kingdom\" album in 2009.\nEarly in 2010, Rata Blanca historical keyboardist Hugo Bistolfi left the band and was replaced by Danilo Moschen, a former member of Barilari's soloist band.\n\nIn 2013, original members Gustavo Rowek, Sergio Berdichevsky and Saul Blanch reunited with Rata Blanca for some presentations. In 2015 Rata Blanca released their tenth studio album, \"Tormenta Eléctrica\".\n\nIn May 2017, bassplayer Guillermo Sánchez died due to sepsis. A few days before, singer Adrián Barilari announced that Guillermo was in poor health condition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpain's Mägo de Oz recorded a version of \"Mujer amante\".\n\n"}

It is a highly infectious avian pathogen that affects the respiratory tract, gut, kidney and reproductive systems of chickens.\n\nIBV affects the performance of both meat-producing and egg-producing chickens and is responsible for substantial economic loss within the poultry industry.\n\nIBV is in the genus \"Gammacoronavirus\", or group 3, with a non-segmented, positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome.\n\nWhen inhaled, virus will attach to glycoprotein receptors containing sialic acid on ciliated epithelial cells of the respiratory epithelium. The respiratory replication will result in loss of ciliary activity, mucus accumulation, necrosis and desquamation, causing respiratory distress, râles and asphyxia. Local virus replication will result in viremia, spreading the infection into other tissues and organs. Other respiratory diseases of chickens (\"Mycoplasma gallisepticum\", avian infectious laryngotracheitis (\"Gallid alphaherpesvirus 1\"), Newcastle disease (avian paramyxovirus 1), \"Avian metapneumovirus\" infection may be confused clinically to infectious bronchitis.\n\nThrough viremia, some nephrotropic strains (most of high virulence) could infect the kidney epithelium in tubules and nephron, causing kidney failure. At gross examination, kidneys may appear swollen and pale in color and with urates in ureters\n\nIn hens, the viremic IBV will also reach the oviduct, causing lesions in the magnum (the egg-white gland) and in the uterus (the egg-shell gland), leading to a sharp decline of egg production, shell-less, fragile or roughened shells eggs (uterus lesion) with watery whites (magnum lesion). Infection of chickens at puberty, during the oviduct development, will impede oviduct formation and destroy future laying capacity, resulting in \"false layers\". However, other diseases affecting layer chickens could lead to that condition.\n\nThere are both attenuated vaccines and inactivated vaccines available. Their effectiveness is diminished by poor cross-protection. The nature of the protective immune response to IBV is poorly understood, but the surface spike protein, the amino-terminal S1 half, is sufficient to induce good protective immunity. Experimental vector IB vaccines and genetically manipulated IBVs—with heterologous spike protein genes—have produced promising results, including in the context of in ovo vaccination.\n\n"}

{"id": "2202019", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2202019", "title": "Throbber", "text": "Throbber\n\nA throbber is an animated graphical control element used to show that a computer program is performing an action in the background (such as downloading content, conducting intensive calculations or communicating with an external device). In contrast to a progress bar, a throbber does not convey how much of the action has been completed.\n\nUsually the throbber is found on the right side of a program's toolbar or menu bar. The form the throbber takes varies, but it is common for it to be the logo of the program it is part of. Most of the time the throbber is a still image (known as its resting frame), but when the program is performing an action the throbber begins to animate in a loop to let the user know that the program is busy and has not frozen. Once the action is complete, the throbber returns to its resting frame. Normally, it is possible for the user to continue interacting with the program while the throbber is animating (one such possibility may be to press a stop button to cancel the action that the program is doing). Clicking on the throbber itself might perform some specific action (for example go to the program's website, pause or cancel the background action).\n\nOne of the early (if not the earliest) uses of a throbber occurred in the NCSA Mosaic web browser of the early 1990s, which featured an NCSA logo that animated while Mosaic downloaded a web page. As the user could still interact with the program, the pointer remained normal (and not a busy symbol, such as an hourglass); therefore, the throbber provided a visual indication that the program was performing an action. Clicking on the throbber would stop the page loading; later web browsers added a separate Stop button for this purpose.\nNetscape, which soon overtook Mosaic as the market-leading web browser, also featured a throbber. In version 1.0 of Netscape, this took the form of a big blue \"N\" (Netscape's logo at the time). The animation depicted the \"N\" expanding and contracting - hence the name \"throbber\". When Netscape unveiled its new logo (a different \"N\" on top of a hill), they held a competition to find an animation for it. The winning design (featuring the new-look \"N\" in a meteor shower) became very well known and almost became an unofficial symbol of the World Wide Web. Later, Internet Explorer's blue \"e\" enjoyed similar status, though it only functioned as a throbber in early versions of the browser.\n\nThe IBM WebExplorer offered a webpage the opportunity to change the look and the animation of the throbber by using proprietary HTML code. The use of web frames, a feature introduced later, leads WebExplorer to confusion on modern pages due to the way this feature was implemented.\n\nThe Arena web browser has a command-line option to change the throbber with a local file.\n\nInitially, throbbers tended to be quite large, but they reduced in size along with the size of toolbar buttons as graphical user interfaces developed. Their usefulness declined somewhat as most operating systems introduced a different pointer to indicate \"working in background\", and they are no longer included in all web browsers. Furthermore, even web browsers that do use them depict images less elaborate than their predecessors. Many browsers — like Mozilla Firefox, Opera and Google Chrome — place a small annular throbber in the tab while a page is loading and replace it with the favicon of the page when loading has completed.\n\nOften browsers shipped with ISP CDs, or those customized according to co-branding agreements, have a custom throbber. For example, the version of Internet Explorer included with AOL disks has an AOL throbber instead of the standard \"e\".\n\nThrobbers saw a resurgence with client side applications (such as Ajax web apps) where an application within the web browser would wait for some operation to complete. Most of these throbbers were known as a \"spinning wheel\", which typically consist of 8, 10, or 12 part-radial lines or discs arranged in a circle, as if on a clock face, highlighted in turn as if a wave is moving clockwise around the circle.\n\nIn text user interfaces, the spinning wheel is commonly replaced by a fixed-width character which is cycled between \"codice_1\", \"codice_2\", \"codice_3\" and \"codice_4\" forms in order to create an animation effect. Unlike graphical activity indicators, the spinning bar is commonly combined with progress displays, since the lower resolution of character-based progress bars requires a separate indication of activity. This use dates from early versions of the UNIX operating system and DR-DOS utilities in the 1980s.\n\n"}

In 1950, the OPC was placed under the Central Intelligence Agency and renamed the Directorate of Plans. The Directorate was first headed by Allen Dulles; Wisner became Deputy Director of Plans (DDP) in 1951 when Dulles was named Director of Central Intelligence. Wisner remained as DDP until September 1958, playing an important role in the early history of the CIA. In 1958 he suffered a breakdown, and retired from the Agency in 1962. He committed suicide in 1965.\n\nWisner was educated at the University of Virginia, where he received both a B.A. and a LL.B. degree. He was also tapped for the Seven Society.\n\nWisner married Florida's Mary Ellis 'Polly' Knowles (1912–2002) and they had four children: Elizabeth Wisner, Graham Wisner, Ellis Wisner, and Frank G. Wisner who entered into diplomatic service.\n\nAfter graduating from the University of Virginia School of Law in 1934, Wisner began working as a Wall Street lawyer for Carter, Ledyard & Milburn. In 1941, six months before the attack on Pearl Harbor, he enlisted in the United States Navy. He worked in the Navy's censor's office until he was transferred to the Office of Strategic Services (OSS). He was stationed first in Turkey, and then in Romania, where he became head of OSS operations in southeastern Europe. This happened just prior to the Romania leaving the Axis and joining the Allies in August 1944. On August 29, some 1,350 American airmen who were prisoners of the Kingdom of Romania were returned by a U.S. Air Crew Rescue Unit via the Popeşti-Leordeni Airfield. Twelve B-17 Flying Fortress flew out the prisoners in hourly shifts. In all, some 1,700 American POWs were transported.\n\nIn March 1945, Wisner was transferred to Wiesbaden, Germany. In 1945–1946, he returned to law practice at Carter, Ledyard & Milburn.\n\nWisner was recruited in 1947 by Dean Acheson to join the State Department to become the Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Occupied Areas. On June 18, 1948, the United States National Security Council approved NSC 10/2 which created the Office of Special Projects. On September 1, 1948, the office was formally established, although it was renamed to the Office of Policy Coordination (OPC) for obfuscation purposes. Wisner was chosen to lead the OPC in the capacity of Assistant Director for Policy Coordination (ADPC). The OPC initially received services from the CIA but was accountable to the State Department.\n\nAccording to its secret charter, the OPC's responsibilities include \"propaganda, economic warfare, preventive direct action, including sabotage, antisabotage, demolition and evacuation procedures; subversion against hostile states, including assistance to underground resistance groups, guerrillas and refugee liberation groups, and support of indigenous anti-communist elements in threatened countries of the free world.\"\n\nDuring the early 1950s, Wisner was the subject of FBI inquiries in connection with his wartime work in Romania, including the claim that he had an affair with Tanda Caradja, daughter of Romanian princess Catherine Caradja during the war; Caradja was alleged in FBI reports to be a Soviet agent. However, Wisner was cleared of all suspicions by the CIA Office of Security.\n\nOn August 23, 1951, Wisner succeeded Allen W. Dulles and became the second Deputy Director of Plans, with Richard Helms as his chief of operations. In this position, he was instrumental in supporting pro-American forces that toppled Mohammed Mossadegh in Iran in 1953 and Jacobo Arbenz Guzmán in Guatemala in 1954.\n\nJ. Edgar Hoover and U.S. Senator McCarthy succeeded in forcing CIA director Allen W. Dulles to dismiss one of his key staff members, Carmel Offie, in 1953 over Wisner's objections.\n\nWisner worked closely with Kim Philby, the British agent who was also Soviet spy.\n\nWisner was also deeply involved in establishing the Lockheed U-2 spy plane program run by Richard M. Bissell Jr.\n\nWisner was diagnosed as a manic depressive and received electroshock therapy. Wisner suffered a serious breakdown in September 1958, and was replaced by Bissell as Deputy Director of Plans. After a lengthy recovery, Wisner became chief of the CIA's London Station.\n\nIn 1961, Wisner was ordered to organize CIA activities in British Guiana.\n\nIn 1962, Wisner retired from the CIA.\n\nWisner died by suicide on October 29, 1965.\n\n"}

Thereafter, he traveled throughout the U.S. and Mexico. He painted his way across the western states, arriving in California in 1873. His works from this trip included a series of Yosemite Valley paintings. In 1876, he received an award at the Philadelphia Centennial Exhibition for his painting of Sentinel Rock in Yosemite. Herzog also made extensive trips to Maine and Florida to paint.\n\nBecause he was a prudent investor, Herzog did not have to depend on the sale of his artwork to maintain a comfortable lifestyle. Following his death, his family retained a large group of his paintings, most of which were released to the art market in the 1970s. A number of prominent American and European museums now include Herzog's work as part of their collections.\n\nHerzog's work is sometimes considered to be part of the Hudson River School, although it is more realistic and less dramatic than works by peers Frederic Edwin Church or Albert Bierstadt.\n\nHe almost always signed his work \"H. Herzog\"; as a result, his first name is spelled both \"Herman\" and \"Hermann\" in various sources. He was born on November 16, 1831 and died on February 6th, 1932 (according to his great great grandson, Scott Herzog (possessor of birth and death certificates).\n\nThe Brandywine River Museum in Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania held a major exhibition of Herzog's work in 1992 and published a catalog of his work, with an essay by art historian Donald S. Lewis, Jr.\n\nIn his long life, Herzog created more than 1,000 paintings, including \"Women in a Tropical Setting\" and \"Landscape with a Bear and her Cub\".\n\n\nIn recent years there has been reported a growing number of paintings on the market which claim to be bona fide Herzog paintings but which are not- offered for sale either by design or mistaken origination.

Flintham to lead the new department, and directed him to establish a program for fire prevention and firefighting in the county. He succeeded in opening 30 \"Fire Protection Districts,\" which served, and continue to serve, towns and the unincorporated areas of Los Angeles County. Cities could choose to join the Fire Protection District by allocating property tax for this service. Cities formed as contract cities in the post-World War II period normally retained membership in the Fire Protection District. Following the passage of Proposition 13 in 1978, property taxes were capped at 1% and the Fire Department charged cities fees for services when annexation occurred. Properties within the district that are not covered under a fee for service arrangement also pay a special fire tax as a result of Proposition E, passed in 1997.\n\nCounty vehicles assigned to the Los Angeles County Fire Department continue to list as registered owner the \"Consolidated Fire Protection District of Los Angeles County\" on California Department of Motor Vehicles paperwork.\n\nThe Los Angeles County Fire Department \"Emergency Operations\" are commanded by Chief Deputy David R. Richardson. The 4 Bureaus that the Chief Deputy oversees contain the bulk of the uniformed firefighting personnel and apparatus that the Fire Department provides, as well as the Technical Services Division. The 3 Operations Bureaus consist of the neighborhood fire stations and camps that are geographically based, while the fourth bureau has specialized teams that respond throughout the county. The 3 Operations Bureaus of LACoFD serve 59 cities and all unincorporated communities with 22 Battalions and 9 Divisions. Each Division is commanded by an assistant chief and each Battalion is commanded by a Battalion Chief. There are 2 Engine Companies at some fire stations. There are Medic Engines and PAU Engines. Fire Station 127 is the famous Emergency! Fire Station and it was designated Station 51 and it is named The Robert A. Cinader Station in honor of the man who made Emergency! famous.\n\nThe LACoFD has 10 fire camps with handcrews which are used for both fire prevention and wildland firefighting. In 2013, to help combat jail crowding as well as increase time served by serious criminal offenders, Los Angeles County sent more than 500 inmates to firefighting camps in mountain and foothill areas. Inmates assigned to the camps are nonviolent offenders who have completed physical and security screenings. They are trained by county firefighters to help fight fires and assist with clearing brush and debris. The camps are run in conjunction with the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation and the Los Angeles County Probation Department.\n\nThe Los Angeles County Fire Department utilizes a wide array of firefighting apparatus, including Engines, Quints, Trucks, Light Forces (Engine + Quint or Truck), Patrols, and Water Tenders. Support apparatus include Rescue Squads, Hazardous Materials Squads, and Urban Search & Rescue Squads. LACoFD apparatus are painted reddish-orange as opposed to LAFD apparatus, which are fire engine red.\n\nWhile many modern fire departments have opted to go with trucks/quints that have rear-mounted ladders, the LACoFD has chosen to stay with tiller trucks because of their enhanced maneuverability in tight areas. The benefit of a quint is that it also has a built in pump and water tank and can thus operate without an engine.\n\nThe LA County Fire Department has 10 helicopters available for aerial firefighting. With the exception of Copter 10 which is used primarily for command purposes, all copters are outfitted with water drop tanks for aerial firefighting. The headquarters for the Air Operations Section is located at Barton Heliport, next to Whiteman Airport in Pacoima.\n\nThe LACoFD is currently dispatched from the P. Michael Freeman Command And Control Facility at the county fire operations center in East Los Angeles. (Location: 34.0526454N, 118.1724628W)\n\nThe Los Angeles County Fire Department has been featured in multiple different television series.\n\n\n"}

Ambrose became the leader of a highly acclaimed British dance band, \"Bert Ambrose & His Orchestra\", in the 1930s.\n\nAmbrose was born in Warsaw in 1896, when it was part of the Russian Empire. After a time the family moved to London. They were Jewish, his father being registered as a \"Dealer in rags\" in the 1911 UK census, where Ambrose was named as \"Barnett' (a \"Violin musician student\"). He began playing the violin while young, and travelled to New York with his aunt. He began playing professionally, first for Emil Coleman at New York's Reisenweber's restaurant, then in the Palais Royal's big band. After making a success of a stint as bandleader, at the age of 20 he was asked to put together and lead his own fifteen-piece band. After a dispute with his employer, he moved his band to another venue, where they enjoyed considerable popularity.\n\nWhile at the Palais Royal, on 5 June 1918, he registered for the draft (Local Board Division 169, City of NY NY, 144 St Nicholas Ave; Registration 232). He gave as his date of birth 11 September 1896; place of birth Warsaw, Russia; nationality Russian; father's birthplace Grietza, Russia; place of employment Palais Royal, 48th Street & Broadway; nearest relative Mrs Becky Ambrose, mother, 56 \"Blaksley\" Street, London, England. He signed as \"Bert Ambrose\". The registrar recorded medium height, medium build, brown hair, brown eyes and no physical disability that would render him exempt from the draft.\n\nIn 1922, Ambrose returned to London, where he was engaged by the Embassy Club to form a seven-piece band. He stayed at the Embassy for two years, before walking out on his employer to take up a much more lucrative job at the Clover Gardens in New York. After a year there, besieged by continual pleas to return from his ex-employer in London, in 1925 he was finally persuaded to go back by a cable from the Prince of Wales: \"The Embassy needs you. Come back—Edward\".\n\nThis time Ambrose stayed at the Embassy Club until 1927. The club had a policy of not allowing radio broadcasts from its premises, however, and this was a major drawback for an ambitious bandleader, largely because the fame gained by radio work helped a band to gain recording contracts (Ambrose's band had been recorded by Columbia Records in 1923, but nothing had come of this). He therefore accepted an offer by the May Fair Hotel, with a contract that included broadcasting. His annual salary from this establishment alone was £10,000.\n\nDuring his time at the Embassy, he married \"Kathryn Lucille otherwise Kitty Brady\", a 24-year-old Irish-American from New Jersey, on 20 January 1924. Oddly, he is named and signed as \"Bernard Ambrose\", a 27-year-old \"Musical Director\", on the marriage certificate. They had two daughters, Patricia S (b. 1931) and Monica J (b. 1933).\n\nAmbrose stayed at the May Fair for six years, during which time the band made recordings for Brunswick Records, HMV and Decca. He teamed up with Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart, along with an American harmony song trio, the Hamilton Sisters and Fordyce (aka Three X Sisters), to record songs including \"My Heart Stood Still\" among others. This period also saw the musical development of the band, partly as a result of Ambrose's hiring of first-class musicians, including Sylvester Ahola, Ted Heath, Joe Crossman, Joe Jeannette, Bert Read, Joe Brannelly, Dick Escott and trumpeter Max Goldberg.\n\nIn 1933, Ambrose was asked to accept a cut in pay at the May Fair; refusing, he went back to the Embassy Club, and after three years there (and a national tour), he rejected American offers and returned to the May Fair in 1936. He then went into partnership with Jack Harris, an American bandleader, and in 1937 they bought a club together, Ciro's Club. For a period of three months, they employed Art Tatum. Ambrose and Harris alternated performances at Ciro's until a disagreement led to the rupture of their partnership. Ambrose then worked at the Café de Paris until the outbreak of the Second World War, when he again went on tour.\n\nHis major discovery in the years leading up to the war was the singer Vera Lynn, who sang with his band from 1937 to 1940 and, during the war, became known as the \"Forces' Sweetheart\". Lynn married Harry Lewis, a clarinettist in the band, in 1939. Other singers with the Ambrose band included Sam Browne, Elsie Carlisle, Denny Dennis, who recorded a number of duets with Vera Lynn, Max Bacon (also the band's drummer), Evelyn Dall and Anne Shelton, with whom \"When That Man is Dead and Gone\", a jibe at Adolf Hitler, written by Irving Berlin, was recorded in 1941. Ambrose's signature tune was \"When Day is Done\".\n\nAfter a short period back at the May Fair Hotel, Ambrose retired from performing in 1940, although he and his orchestra continued to make records for Decca until 1947. Several members of his band became part of the Royal Air Force band, the Squadronaires, during the war. Ambrose's retirement was not permanent, however, and he formed and toured with the Ambrose Octet, and dabbled in management.\n\nIn the mid-1950s, despite appearances in London's West End and a number of recordings for MGM, Ambrose, in common with other bandleaders, was struggling because rock and roll had arrived. He was forced to start performing in small clubs with casual musicians, and his financial position deteriorated catastrophically. His situation was saved, however, by his discovery of the singer Kathy Kirby, whom he heard singing at the age of 16 at the Ilford Palais. He started a long personal relationship with Kirby and promoted her career.\n\nIt was during the recording of one of Kirby's television programmes (at the Yorkshire Television studios) that Ambrose collapsed, dying later the same night in Leeds General Infirmary. His music was kept alive after his death by, among others, Radio 2 broadcasters Alan Dell and Malcolm Laycock, the latter continuing to play his records into the 21st century.\n\nSpecialist dance band radio stations, such as Radio Dismuke and Swing Street Radio, continue to play his records. Ambrose also features regularly on the Manx Radio programme \"Sweet & Swing\", presented by Howard Caine.\nAmbrose was commemorated in 2005 by a blue plaque unveiled on the May Fair Hotel.\n\n"}

{"id": "2202083", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2202083", "title": "Kat Bjelland", "text": "Kat Bjelland\n\nKatherine Lynne Bjelland (born December 9, 1963) is an American singer, songwriter, musician and guitarist. She rose to prominence as the lead singer, guitarist, and songwriter of the alternative rock band Babes in Toyland, which she formed in Minneapolis, Minnesota in 1987. She has been noted for her unusual vocal style alternately consisting of shrill screams, whispering, and speaking in tongues, as well as for her guitar playing style, which incorporates \"jagged\" tones with \"psychotic rockabilly rhythms.\"\n\nBorn in Salem, Oregon, Bjelland was raised in nearby Woodburn, and learned to play guitar as a teenager from her uncle, with whom she performed in his band shortly after graduating high school. Upon dropping out of the University of Oregon at age nineteen, Bjelland relocated to Portland, where she became involved in the city's punk rock scene. There, she became friends with Courtney Love, and formed the band Pagan Babies.\n\nAfter the dissolution of Pagan Babies in 1985, Bejalland relocated to Minneapolis, where she formed Babes in Toyland with drummer Lori Barbero. The band's debut record, \"Spanking Machine\", was released in 1990, after which they toured Europe with Sonic Youth. This was followed by their second album, \"Fontanelle\" (1992). The band would release their third studio album, \"Nemesisters\", in 1995. In the mid-late 1990s, Bjelland collaborated on other musical projects, including contributing as a bassist in the band Crunt with her then-husband, Australian musician Stuart Gray.\n\nBabes in Toyland formally disbanded in 2001, and Bjelland began working with Katastrophy Wife, a project under which she released the albums \"Amusia\" (2001) and \"All Kneel\" (2004). She remained out of the public light for several years before publicly revealing in 2007 that she had been diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder. In 2015, she reunited with Babes in Toyland and began touring internationally for the first time in over a decade.\n\nKatherine Lynne Bjelland was born on December 9, 1963 in Salem, Oregon to Lynne Irene (née Higginbotham) and Lyle Bjelland. She was raised in Woodburn, a small town north of Salem. \"It's predominantly Orthodox Russians and Hispanics,\" Bjelland said of the community, \"So being white [was] more like being a minority... We lived at the edge of town, so there was complete wilderness behind us.\" When Bjelland was five years old, her mother abandoned their family. Bjelland's father subsequently remarried, after which she claimed to have been physically and verbally abused by her stepmother. \"You know, I really hate to talk about it because she's great now, but in my childhood she was very abusive,\" she said. \"It probably did help my creativity a lot [though]. I was always grounded. I hate to talk about it because I feel like she doesn't think that she did it, but she was [abusive] and it influenced my life quite a great deal.\"\n\nBjelland became interested in music as a young child, and began listening to rock and roll records. As an adolescent, she became enamored with Rush, and attended four of their concerts. She also cited Kiss, Cheap Trick, The B-52's, the Plasmatics, and Captain Beefheart among her favorite artists while growing up. Her uncle, David Higginbotham, taught Bjelland to play guitar in her youth. Her first performance was at a small bar in Woodburn called Flight 99, playing with her uncle in a band called The Neurotics.\n\nShe attended Woodburn High School, where she played on the school basketball team and was a cheerleader. After graduating from high school in 1982, Bjelland briefly enrolled at the University of Oregon, but dropped out after her freshman year and relocated to Portland at age nineteen. During this time, Bjelland worked as a stripper to support herself. She became introduced to punk music after attending a Wipers concert in Portland: \"I didn't know about punk rock that much,\" she recalled. \"I was from a small town. All of a sudden I was like, 'What the fuck is this?'\"\n\nAt age nineteen, Bjelland purchased her first guitar, a Rickenbacker 425, from a pawn shop for $200. In Woodburn, she joined The Neurotics, and then an all-female band called The Venarays, which Bjelland has described as \"rock with a '60s edge.\" The Neurotics were composed of Bjelland (rhythm guitar); her uncle David Higginbotham (lead guitar); Marty Wyman (vocals); Brian McMillan (drums); and Laura Robertson (bass). Commenting on the band, she said: \"After The Neurotics I got this band together with my best friends, so it was an all-girl band. We were called The Venarays. The name came from the [Latin] word \"venary\" which means \"actively hunting out sex\"! We began as a way of having fun with each other.\" The band, however, was not exclusively female, as drummer Dave Hummel, and later, Jack Rhodes, were men. The band name bears similarity to Vena Ray, a character from the early 1950s program \"Rocky Jones, Space Ranger\".\n\nAfter quitting The Venarays, Bjelland met Courtney Love in 1984 at the Satyricon, a Portland nightclub, and the two started a band called Sugar Babydoll. They relocated to San Francisco in 1985, after which they were joined in the group by drummer Suzanne Ramsey, and bassist Jennifer Finch. Bjelland recalled: \"We went through a few names, and we only played a couple of shows. It was the smallest thing I've ever done musically.\" The group was inspired by Frightwig, an all-female band from the San Francisco Bay area. After Finch left the group, they renamed themselves the Pagan Babies and introduced Deirdre Schletter and Janis Tanaka, releasing a four-track demo in December 1985 before disbanding. Love went on to form the band Hole in 1989, while Finch would be part of L7.\n\nHoping to form a new band, Bjelland relocated from Portland to Minneapolis around 1986, and shortly after met Lori Barbero, a bartender, at a barbecue. She convinced Barbero to play in her band as a drummer, despite the fact that Barbero had no musical training. Barbero agreed, and the pair joined with bassist Michelle Leon, forming Babes in Toyland. Bjelland has said she intentionally sought out bandmates who had no instrumental experience: \"Lori didn't know how to play when I met her. Michelle didn't know how to play. I was self-taught. Hopefully, from being technically inexperienced, you can use your imagination, and play the drums like an instrument instead of just being a beat-keeper. And play the bass like you feel it, from your gut, instead of saying, 'Here's my scales.'\"\nThe band recorded their first extended play, \"To Mother\", in London in 1990, titled in honor of Bjelland's mother, whom she had discovered died of pancreatic cancer on the first day of the recording sessions. After signing to Reprise Records in 1991, Babes in Toyland's debut single, \"Dust Cake Boy\" b/w \"Spit to See the Shine\" was well-received. After touring Europe with Sonic Youth, the band recorded their debut album \"Spanking Machine\", which also was well- received, and was compared to the music of The Birthday Party and New York Dolls. The group would become misidentified as part of the riot grrrl movement, though Bjelland has denied having anything to do with the movement. As she said in a 1992 interview: \"I don't feel helpless or anything. I don't feel like I have to be like, \"I'm a female and I can do this if I want to\", cause, of course I can. I already know that, and I never felt being female hurt anything. If anything, it helped.\"\n\nIn 1991, the band toured in Europe with Sonic Youth, which was documented in the film \"\". Following this, Babes in Toyland peaked in commercial success when they performed on a portion of the Lollapalooza tour in 1993, and released their second album, \"Fontanelle\" (1992), which sold over 250,000 copies. In 1994, the band was featured on the covers of \"Entertainment Weekly\" and \"USA Today\". At the height of the band's fame, Bjelland and her former bandmate Courtney Love were often pitted against one another as rivals in media, with frequent comparisons between the two's visual appearances. According to Bjelland, the two had a falling out after Bjelland told a reporter: \"Only about a quarter of what Courtney says is true. But nobody usually bothers to decipher which are the lies. She's all about image.\" Babes in Toyland's original bassist, Leon, claimed the rivalry between Love and Bjelland was \"blown totally out of proportion,\" while Bjelland added in a 2011 interview: \"The media did that, and it was really hurtful to me for a long time. They'd say it's some kind of battle. Which it wasn't. We were friends.\" Bjelland would later refer to Love as her \"soul sister,\" commenting in a 2001 interview: \"I haven't spoken to Courtney for years but soul sisters don't need to. There will always be a bond between us, regardless of whether we speak or not.\"\n\nIn 1993, Bjelland moved to Seattle and began a side project called Crunt with her then-husband, Australian musician Stuart Gray (also known as Stu Spasm) whom she married in 1992. Bjelland played bass and Gray guitar, while Russell Simins of Jon Spencer Blues Explosion was the drummer. In February 1994, the band released a self-titled debut, along with its first single, \"Swine\". During this time, Bjelland also co-wrote the track \"I Think That I Would Die\" on Hole's breakthrough album \"Live Through This\" (1994) with Courtney Love and guitarist Eric Erlandson. Bjelland suffered a nervous breakdown after the suicide of Kurt Cobain in 1994: \"[I was in Seattle after he died] to hang out with Courtney and support her,\" she recalled. \"In the funeral home, I saw him dead, which was more than disturbing...  I had a nervous breakdown right after that.\" Bjelland had herself been using heroin regularly at the time, though she denied using it regularly while touring. \"Let me make this clear: I never really did heroin on tour,\" she said in 2011. \"When I came home and was bored and depressed [and] with money, yeah, that's when I would do it.\" To kick her habit prior to going on tours, Bjelland would binge drink through withdrawal symptoms.\n\nIn January 1995, Bjelland and Gray divorced after two years of marriage, and Crunt disbanded. Bjelland turned her focus back to Babes in Toyland, and the group released their third and final full-length album, \"Nemesisters\" in 1995. After this, she moved to Brooklyn, New York, and contributed to the 1997 album \"Songs of the Witchblade: A Soundtrack to the Comic Book\", for the Top Cow's comics of the same name. She composed, played and produced most of songs, with many rock and metal artists like Megadeth or Peter Steele (Type O Negative), and also collaborated with a freeform musical project called Last Frenzy in England. Around 1999, Bjelland gave birth to a son, Henry, with her former husband, drummer Glen Mattson. Babes in Toyland maintained a loyal following throughout the rest of the decade, and in November 2001, played a farewell show in Minneapolis.\n\nWith Babes in Toyland playing only performing sporadically in the late 1990s, Bjelland started the band Katastrophy Wife in 1998 as a side project with her then-husband, drummer Glen Mattson. The band toured at venues, such as Ladyfest, worldwide, and released two albums, \"Amusia\" (2001) and \"All Kneel\" (2004). Tom Edwards of \"Drowned in Sound\" gave \"All Kneel\" a favorable review, ranking it among Bjelland's best work.\n\nIn 2002, after the dissolution of Babes in Toyland, Bjelland produced and contributed guest vocals on the album \"The Seven Year Itch\" for the band Angelica. After that band's own dissolution, Bjelland hired the drummer and bassist for an impending European tour. The new band was billed as Babes in Toyland, which resulted in Barbero threatening a lawsuit, and Bjelland ultimately scrapping the name. Bjelland later claimed that Kurt Pagan-Davies, a manager with whom she was working during this time, had been partly responsible for the decision to tour under the Babes in Toyland name, which he denied. She subsequently accused him of stealing money that belonged to her from the publishing of Katastrophy Wife's albums \"Amusia\" and \"All Kneel\".\n\nIn 2006, on the official Katastrophy Wife website, Bjelland wrote that \"Katastrophy Wife have had a few incarnations but from here on I will only re-incarnate my self.\" In April 2007, the band released the single \"Heart On\", on the Australian record label Rish. The single was intended as a trailer for a forthcoming album, \"Pregnant\", although as of 2020 the album has not been released. Katastrophy Wife's vinyl debut was on an Independent label compilation called \"The Tundra Sessions\", featuring production by Tim Mac.\n\nIn 2007, Bjelland revealed she had been diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder and had been institutionalized for a period. She commented on the event, saying: \"I don't know how I've progressed musically as such but a major influence in my writing was dealing with my whole schizophrenia episode. I actually haven't spoken to anyone much about this. Dealing with multiple personalities was extremely difficult because some days I didn't know who I was or where I was at. I was very lucky that Adrian (Johnson, her partner and manager) stuck by and helped me through it all. So obviously that was going to affect some of what I wrote about.\"\n\nIn 2014, Bjelland reunited with former bandmates Maureen Herman and Lori Barbero and began rehearsing to perform live shows. \"People would show me on the Internet all these young fans who wanted to see us, and I felt kind of obligated to play,\" said Bjelland. \"You see people with their moms and even grandmothers coming to the shows together. It's super cool. I'm just surprised at how much people still like it.\"\n\nIn February 2015, the band played their first live show together in fourteen years in Joshua Tree, California, and performed additional shows on an international tour throughout 2015. Bjelland commented that she intended to write new material, but that it would be concerned with \"less anger about people. Now it's about things that are going on in the world. I've got a whole plethora of songs ready to go.\"\n\nAs a child, Bjelland's favorite band was Rush, particularly their fourth album \"2112\". \"It was kind of a band that girls didn't like, just guys liked them... I liked them because they had weird, spacey other-land lyrics, and lots of breaks, and really cool instrumentation,\" she said. As an adolescent, she also listened to popular rock bands such as Kiss and Cheap Trick. She would later credit Cocteau Twins, The Miracle Workers, and the Wipers as early influences, and also said she listened to Billie Holiday as a teenager. As an adult, Bjelland named Captain Beefheart, Charles Mingus, Leonard Cohen, Frightwig, Girlschool, Motörhead, and other '70s metal bands as important to her.\n\nBjelland has been noted by music critics for her unique screaming vocals, which have been likened to those of Ozzy Osbourne and Diamanda Galás. Journalist Richard Cromelin noted in a 1992 \"Los Angeles Times\" profile that \"She retches her enraged lyrics, her screams skid across the beat and collide with the blunt riffs. Her voice erupts into laughs and gargles, then croons down low with eerie detachment.\" She has also incorporated speaking in tongues in several songs.\n\nCommenting on her musical aspirations, Bjelland said: \"It should sound like nothing that you've heard before. That's my intention... Like my singing, all I try to do is I just push myself into things where I think I can't reach notes and stuff. Sometimes it sounds really ridiculous, but then you just kind of work on it.\" A 2015 concert review described her voice as one so powerful that it \"can strip the chrome off a bumper.\"\n\nIn Babes in Toyland, Bjelland's instrumentation and songwriting has been described as \"ugly, crunching post-punk,\" supplemented by \"rudimentary\" guitar chords. She learned to play guitar from her uncle, David Higgenbotham, with whom she played in his band, The Neurotics, prior to forming Babes in Toyland. Commenting on her guitar playing, Bjelland said: \"I think it's not the quantity but the quality, and I don't think it's the speed you play, it's the soul that comes out.\" In an interview with John Peel, she revealed that she had never played with an effects pedal until 1993: \"If you learn how to play without effects, you have to learn how to make your guitar speak instead of the electronics.\"\n\nBabes in Toyland\n\n\nCrunt\n\nKatastrophy Wife\n\n\n"}

It is also Argentina's most important base in the continent.\n\nThe increased Antarctic activity that Argentina developed since 1940 created the need for an aviation runway operable throughout the year for wheeled units. The flight of Vice-Commodore Mario Luis Olezza to the South Pole, the newly built United States McMurdo Station and the frequent operations launched from the Matienzo Base showed the need to secure better transport and communications in the sector.\n\nThe Argentine Air Force set about to find a suitable spot to construct an airport. On 25 November 1968, two helicopters operating from the icebreaker ARA \"General San Martín\" descended on the Marambio Island as part of such survey. Their report favoring the place was decisive: it lacked large obstacles that could trouble aircraft maneuvering, and its long plateau was virtually free of ice.\n\nOn 30 August 1969, an Air Force team led by Vice-Commodore Olezza occupied the island, carrying with them the elements needed for the construction of the projected landing track. When initially opened, the \"05/23\"-oriented runway had a length of . It was the first one in the continent. The task took three months of work and culminated when a de Havilland Canada DHC-2 Beaver, set with conventional wheels, took off from Matienzo Base and landed on the new airport. Before the end of October the runway had already reached .\n\nThe base was founded on 29 October 1969. That day a Fokker F-27 Friendship of the Argentine Air Force manned by Vice-Commodore Erwin Roberto Kern, left Rio Gallegos and landed directly in Marambio Airport, carrying on board civil and military authorities. It was the first aircraft taking off in another continent and landing in Antarctica using conventional landing gear: Antarctica was no longer an isolated place; from that day onwards all domestic and foreign Antarctic bases got interconnected with the rest of the world throughout the year. It was the most important Antarctic event in the decade.\n\nBy April 1970 the runway had reached . On 11 April 1970 the Argentine Air Force began landing their C-130 Hercules on Antarctica when the TC-61 commanded by Commodore Arturo Athos Gandolfi landed in Marambio, starting a long-standing and uninterrupted tradition of air-supplying the Antarctic Argentine bases from the mainland. The Fokker F28 Fellowship presidential aircraft T-01 \"Patagonia\" was the first jet to land in Antarctica when it touched down at Marambio on 28 July 1973, 13:28 h.\n\nCommercial passenger traffic from Ushuaia has been announced for 2018.\n\n Marambio has 27 buildings with a total covered area exceeding . It can host a permanent crew of 45 men and a large complement of scientific personnel, totaling about 200 people, although on average it is populated with 55 members in winter and 150 in summer.\nSome of the facilities are: main, dining and recreation halls; emergency house with 28-bed capacity; personnel accommodation buildings; aircraft parking platform; flight deck; airline passenger terminal; flight ground support equipment; library; mail office; gym; chapel; laundry; kitchen; two freezing chambers; snow melter; satellite dish for television and internet; radio communications station; towing and personnel carrier vehicles (including tractors, trucks and forklifts); road maintenance tools and vehicles (several snow dozers, tracked loaders and graders); mechanical, carpentry, blacksmithing, turning, plumbing and electricity workshops; laboratory with substations for APT (Automatic Picture Transmission) satellite imagery receiver, ozone and uv light measurement, sounding balloon and radiosonde setup and launching, a MBI International Meteorological Center, and others; several warehouses and deposits; fuel storage array; potable water and sewerage network; incinerator and waste disposal module, and firefighting system.\n\nThe base also has CATV and public and internal mobile phone service.\nThe medical suite is attended by one doctor and three paramedics, and has three beds and x-ray, dentistry, coronary care and telemedicine facilities. Over of Antarctic gasoil are used every year for transportation, and to feed the 1,000 kW main power plant with its three Caterpillar generators. The base also has a sewage treatment plant. Most buildings are connected together by risen metal footpaths to isolate them from snow and ice.\n\nOn 2010 the Argentine company CITEDEF designed and installed a wind generator on the base.\n\nThe base is supported by Marambio Airport.\n\nThe base is connected to the Argentine mainland and the world through a satellite downlink station with telephone, fax, TV and internet. They also have a DirecTV dish which provides their service to the whole base. Argentine mobile telephone company Claro and Spanish Movistar have an antenna for local coverage. Within the base and between bases, radio is the most used mean of communication, mainly through HF, Vox/Data, aeronautic VHF-AM and UHF-FM.\n\nInternet access is provided by Speedy Argentina, allowing the personnel in the base to be permanently connected to net services. Wireless LAN and Wi-Fi cover the entire complex, becoming one of the southernmost spots in the world with a wireless network. Telephone service is provided by Telefónica de Argentina at low national rates.\n\nIn September 2006, a GSM mobile phone network was also added to the base, provided by the Argentine mobile operator CTI Móvil (now Claro).\n\nScientific research at Marambio is planned and executed by specialized departments, usually during the summer campaigns:\n\nIn addition Marambio is home to various ongoing scientific projects:\nIn spite of its relatively low latitude, Marambio Base is situated in an ice cap climate, albeit much less severe than in Antarctica's interior.\n\nNonetheless, the climate is severe with mean temperatures that rarely rise above and the presence of strong winds. The strong winds produce a wind chill that makes the temperatures feel colder. In particular, gusts up to can occur during the winter months. Due to the partial melting of snow in summer due to above freezing daytime temperatures, animals as well as limited plant life (moss, lichens, and worts) are allowed to thrive during the warmer months of December, January, and February.\n\nMean monthly temperatures range from in June to in December. During summer, the average high is above freezing while the average low is . However, temperatures can reach up to or fall below during summer. In winter, the average high is while the average low is . Occasionally, temperatures can reach above freezing during winter. This occurs when warm air from the northeast (characterized by high cloud cover and fog) or from the northwest moves towards the peninsula. As the warm air crosses the mountains in the peninsula, it warms as it descend, leading to warm and dry conditions in a manner similar to a Zonda wind. Its highest recorded temperature was on 23 March 2015. This was surpassed on February 9, 2020 when a temperature of was recorded at the base.\n\nFog frequently occurs in the base. December and January are the foggiest months, averaging 16 to 19 days with fog while June to September are the least, averaging 9 to 11 days. The base is characterized by high cloud cover throughout the year in the form of stratus clouds. Summer is the cloudiest season, averaging 24 cloudy days while winters are the least cloudiest, averaging 10 to 11 cloudy days.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2202100", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2202100", "title": "Transcortical motor aphasia", "text": "Transcortical motor aphasia\n\nTranscortical motor aphasia (TMoA), also known as commissural dysphasia or white matter dysphasia, results from damage in the anterior superior frontal lobe of the language-dominant hemisphere. This damage is typically due to cerebrovascular accident (CVA). TMoA is generally characterized by reduced speech output, which is a result of dysfunction of the affected region of the brain. The left hemisphere is usually responsible for performing language functions, although left-handed individuals have been shown to perform language functions using either their left or right hemisphere depending on the individual. The anterior frontal lobes of the language-dominant hemisphere are essential for initiating and maintaining speech. Because of this, individuals with TMoA often present with difficulty in speech maintenance and initiation.\n\nDamage in the watershed region does not directly harm the areas of the brain involved in language production or comprehension; instead, the damage isolates these areas from the rest of the brain. If there is damage to the frontal lobe, executive functions related to language use are often affected. Executive functions relevant to language include activating language responses, controlling syntax (grammar), and narrative discourse. Difficulties in these areas can lead to supplementary deficits involving difficulties forming complex sentences, choosing which words to use appropriately, and initiating speech in conversation.\n\nThe extent and location of the brain damage will impact the degree and variety of language functioning characteristics (i.e. damage deep to the frontal lobe and/or damage across multiple regions will greatly impair language). Right hemiparesis, or right-sided paralysis, may coincide with TMoA if the lesion in the anterior frontal lobe is large enough and extends into the posterior frontal lobe.\n\nThere are some other forms of aphasia that relate to TMoA. For instance, adynamic aphasia is a form of TMoA that is characterized by sparse speech. This occurs as a result of executive functioning in the frontal lobe. Another form of aphasia related to TMoA is dynamic aphasia. Patients with this form of aphasia may present with a contiguity disorder in which they have difficulty combining linguistic elements. For dynamic aphasia, this is most apparent when the patient is asked to sequence at the sentence level whereas for other aphasias contiguity disorder can be seen at the phoneme or word level.\n\nTMoA is classified as a non-fluent aphasia that is characterized by a significantly reduced output of speech, but good auditory comprehension. Auditory comprehension skills remain intact because the arcuate fasciculus and Wernicke's area are not impaired. Individuals with TMoA also exhibit good repetition skills and can repeat long, complex phrases effortlessly and without error. However, spontaneous speech often presents with paraphasias (a wide category of speech errors that are caused by aphasia). Regardless of any relative communication strengths, individuals with TMoA are typically poor conversational partners. Due to damage in the anterior superior frontal lobe, people with TMoA have deficits in initiation and maintenance of conversations, which results in reduced speech output. A person with TMoA may seldomly produce utterances and typically remain silent. The utterances that they do produce are typically only one to two words long. However, in more structured and predictable interactions, individuals with TMoA tend to respond more fluently and promptly. In addition, these individuals are characterized by their attentiveness and cooperation and are often described as being task-oriented.\n\nNeurological imaging has shown that TMoA is typically caused by an infarct of the anterior superior frontal lobe in the perisylvian area of the left, or language-dominant, hemisphere. The anterior superior frontal lobe is known as the prefrontal cortex which is responsible for the initiation and ideation of verbal speech. The damage leaves the major language networks, Broca's and Wernicke’s areas and the arcuate fasiculus, unaffected. Brain injury can result from a stroke caused by left anterior cerebral artery (ACA) occlusion, brain tumors, traumatic brain injury (TBI), or progressive neurological disorders.\n\nTMoA is diagnosed by the referring physician and speech-language pathologist (SLP). The overall sign of TMoA is nonfluent, reduced, fragmentary echoic, and perseverative speech with frequent hesitations and pauses. Patients with TMoA also have difficulty initiating and maintaining speech. However, speech articulation and auditory comprehension remain typical. The hallmark sign of TMoA is intact repetition in the presence of these signs and symptoms.\n\nTMoA, or any other type of aphasia, is identified and diagnosed through the screening and assessment process. Screening can be conducted by a SLP or other professional when there is a suspected aphasia. The screening does not diagnose aphasia, rather it points to the need for a further comprehensive assessment. A screening typically includes evaluation of oral motor functions, speech production skills, comprehension, use of written and verbal language, cognitive communication, swallowing, and hearing. Both the screening and assessment must be sensitive to the patient's linguistic and cultural differences. An individual will be recommended to receive a comprehensive assessment if their screening shows signs of aphasia. Under the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA) and World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines and the \"International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health\" (ICF) framework, the comprehensive assessment encompasses not only speech and language, but also impairments in body structure and function, co-morbid deficits, limitations in activity and participation, and contextual (environmental and personal) factors. The assessment can be static (current functioning) or dynamic (ongoing) and the assessment tools can be standardized or nonstandardized. Typically, the assessment for aphasia includes a gathering of a case history, a self-report from the patient, an oral-motor examination, assessment of expressive and receptive language in spoken and written forms, and identification of facilitators and barriers to patient success. From this assessment, the SLP will determine type of aphasia and the patient's communicative strengths and weaknesses and how their diagnosis may impact their overall quality of life.\n\nTreatment for all types of aphasia, including transcortical motor aphasia, is usually provided by a speech-language pathologist. The SLP chooses specific therapy tasks and goals based on the speech and language abilities and needs of the individual. In general for individuals with TMoA, treatment should capitalize on their strong auditory comprehension and repetition skills and address the individual's reduced speech output and difficulty initiating and maintaining a conversation. New research in aphasia treatment is showing the benefit of the Life Participation Approach to Aphasia (LPAA) in which goals are written based on the skills needed by the individual patient to participate in specific real-life situations (i.e. communicating effectively with nurses or gaining employment). Based on the specific needs of the patient, SLPs can provide a variety of treatment activities.\n\nTo improve word retrieval and initiation difficulties, clinicians may use confrontation naming in which the patient is asked to name various objects and pictures. Depending on the severity, they may also use sentence completion tasks in which the clinician says sentences with the final word(s) missing and expects the patient to fill in the blank. Limited research suggests that nonsymbolic limb movement on the left side (i.e. tapping the left hand on the table) during sentence production can increase verbal initiations. The use of the left arm in left space stimulates initiation mechanisms in the right hemisphere of the brain which can also be used for language allowing individuals to produce more grammatical sentences with higher fluency and more verbal initiation.\n\nTo increase speech output, the clinician may provide a set of pictures and prompt the patient to describe or elaborate on the events pictured. The clinician can also provide spoken or written words and prompt the patient to use the words in a sentence. Additionally, the clinician can ask questions based on the patient's experiences, opinions, or general knowledge and prompt the patient to answer with phrases or sentences. To work on more connected speech, the clinician may ask the patient to describe procedures such as making a sandwich or doing laundry. A study found that syntax training in which sentence constructions are elicited on a hierarchy of difficulty produced gains in grammatically complete utterances and utterances that successfully communicated novel and accurate information.\n\nTo improve conversational skills, SLPs may engage the patient in structured conversations in which supports are provided to help the patient take appropriate conversational turns, maintain the topic of conversation, and formulate appropriate sentences. Clinicians often need to provide pragmatic guidelines so that the patient's responses go beyond the clinician's request and so the clinician does not do the majority of the talking. Research shows that conversation therapy can improve percent of complex utterances, the efficiency of the utterances for expressing ideas, and total time spent talking over more traditional stimulation therapy.\n\nIn order to improve the patient's abilities to functionally communicate in their natural settings, the SLP will provide strategies and techniques to enhance their success in communicative settings (i.e. supplementing speech with nonverbal communication). Research supports the use of reduced syntax therapy to help patients overcome the non-fluent speech and agrammatism that often occurs with TMoA. Because agrammatism inhibits the patient's ability to form grammatically correct sentences, this type of treatment involves reducing these agrammatic deficits and teaching the patient to simplify linguistic structures while still conveying the message in order for language used to be more productive in conversation.\n\nAdditionally, they may train the patient's communication partners to support the conversational abilities of the patient by facilitating the use of preserved cognitive and social functions. Research supports the use of various partner training programs such as Supported Conversation for Adults with Aphasia from the Aphasia Institute. In this program, the focus is put on acknowledging the patient's competence and helping them to reveal that competence. Strategies include saying “I know you know” when appropriate, using gestures to supplement messages, limiting background noise, and given sufficient time for response.\n\nFrom a neuroscience perspective, research has found that a dopamine agonist, bromocriptine, taken by mouth, has provided positive outcomes during intervention for non-fluent types of aphasia, such as TMoA or adynamic aphasia. Studies have found that bromocriptine increased neural networks which assist with the initiation of speech in individuals who possess non-fluent characteristics of speech.\n\nIn order to capitalize on neuroplasticity for treatment of all types of aphasia, timing, intensity, duration, and repetition of treatment should be taken into consideration. Research has found that aphasia treatment initiated during the earlier acute post-injury phase is more effective compared to treatment initiated in the chronic phase. With regard to intensity and duration of treatment, studies reported maximum recovery occurred with intense weekly therapy (approximately 8 hours per week) was delivered over a 2–3 month period. Other research shows that distributed therapy may be more beneficial than high intensity therapy. More research is needed to determine which is best, but it may be found that the ideal duration and intensity of therapy is variable depending on the patient and their needs.\n\nIn relation to other types of aphasia, TMoA occurs less frequently, so there is less information on its prognosis. In general, for individuals with aphasia, most recovery is seen within 6 months of the stroke or injury although more recovery may continue in the following months or years. The timeline of recovery may look different depending on the type of stroke that caused the aphasia. With an ischemic stroke, recovery is greatest within the first two weeks and then diminishes overtime until the progress stabilizes. With a hemorrhagic stroke, the patient often shows little improvement in the first few weeks and then has relatively rapid recovery until they stabilize.\n\nIn a study involving eight patients with border zone lesions, all patients presented with transcortical mixed aphasia initially after the stroke. Three of these patients made a complete recovery within a few days post-stroke. For three other patients with more anterior lesions, their aphasia transitioned to TMoA. All participants in the study regained full language abilities within 18 months following their stroke. This suggests a positive long-term prognosis for patients with TMoA. However, this might not be the case for all patients and more research is needed in order to solidify these findings. Another study found that prognosis of TMoA is affected by lesion size. Smaller lesions typically cause delays in speech initiation; whereas, larger lesions lead to more profound language abnormalities and difficulty with abstract language abilities.\n\nResearch has shown that treatment has a direct effect on aphasia outcomes. Intensity, duration and timing of treatment all need to be taken in to consideration when choosing a course of treatment and determining a prognosis. In general, greater intensity leads to greater improvement. For duration, longer-term treatment produces more permanent changes. As for timing, beginning treatment too early may be difficult for the system which has not recovered enough to do intensive therapy, but beginning too late may result missing the window of the opportunity in which the most change can occur. Neuroplasticity, the brain's natural ability to reorganize itself following a traumatic event, occurs best when treatment connects simultaneous events, maintains attention, taps into positive emotion, utilizes repetition tasks, and is specific to the individual's needs.\n\nOther factors affecting prognosis includes location and site of lesion. Since the lesion that results in TMoA usually occurs in the watershed area and does not directly involve the areas of the brain responsible for general language abilities, prognosis for these patients is good overall. Other factors that determine a patient's prognosis include age, education prior to the stroke, gender, motivation, and support.\n\n\n<br>\n"}
{"id": "2202102", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2202102", "title": "Fame (David Bowie song)", "text": "Fame (David Bowie song)\n\n\"Fame\" is a song recorded by English singer-songwriter David Bowie. It was released on his 1975 album \"Young Americans\" and was later issued as the album's second single by RCA Records in July 1975. Written by Bowie, Carlos Alomar and former Beatle John Lennon, it was recorded at Electric Lady Studios in New York City in January 1975. It is a funk rock song that represents Bowie's (and Lennon's) dissatisfaction with the troubles of fame and stardom. The song was a major commercial success in North America, becoming Bowie's first number 1 single on both the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and the Canadian Singles Chart. The song was one of the more successful singles of the year, ranking at number 7 on the \"Billboard\" Year-End Hot 100. However, it was less successful in Europe, reaching number 17 in the UK Singles Chart. \n\nIn 1990, Bowie remixed the song under the title \"Fame '90\" to coincide with his Sound+Vision Tour. \"Fame\" has since appeared on many compilation albums, and was remastered in 2016 as part of the \"Who Can I Be Now? (1974–1976)\" box set.\n\nThe song is one of four of Bowie's songs to be included in The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll.\n\nWith the release of his 1972 album \"The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars\", Bowie achieved stardom. On that album, Bowie presented his aspirations to become famous in \"Star\", which also encapsulated the fantasies of \"every adolescent dreamer miming into a hairbrush in a suburban bedroom\", on top of Bowie's own frustration with not having fulfilled his potential. By the beginning of 1975, \"fame\" meant a couple of different things to Bowie. It meant not only his stardom, but also impending lawsuits that were the result of the ending of Bowie's relationship with his manager Tony Defries. It also meant an expensive musical theatre project concocted by Defries, titled \"Fame\", that was financed through MainMan, a company that was built around Bowie's fame; the show was an examination of Marilyn Monroe that closed after one night on Broadway and after already flopping off-Broadway. The failure of \"Fame\" almost ruined MainMan and was traumatic on Bowie and Defries' relationship. \n\nBowie would later describe \"Fame\" as \"nasty, angry\", and fully admitted that it was written \"with a degree of malice\" aimed at the MainMan. This is supported by biographer Peter Doggett, who writes: \"every time in \"Fame\" that Bowie snapped back with a cynical retort about its pitfalls, he had [Defries] and [Defries's] epic folly in mind,\" and noted the lyric \"bully for you, chilly for me\" as the striking example. In 1990, Bowie recalled the song as his \"least favourite track on the album\" and reflected: \"I'd had very upsetting management problems and a lot of that was built into the song. I've left all that behind me, now... I think fame itself is not a rewarding thing. The most you can say is that it gets you a seat in restaurants.\"\n\nWith the \"Young Americans\" sessions mostly concluded by late 1974, the material was delayed while Bowie extricated himself from Defries. Sources differ on how \"Fame\" came to be in the studio, but both Doggett and Nicholas Pegg write that it was the product of \"happy\" accidents. By late 1974, Bowie was staying in New York City, where he met John Lennon, who was in his period of estrangement from his wife Yoko Ono. The pair jammed together, leading to a one-day session at Electric Lady Studios in January 1975. There, Carlos Alomar had developed a guitar riff for Bowie's cover of \"Footstompin'\" by the Flairs, which Bowie thought was \"a waste\" to give to a cover. Lennon, who was in the studio with them, came up with the hook when he started to sing \"aim\" over the riff, which Bowie turned into \"Fame\" and thereafter, according to Marc Spitz, wrote the rest of the lyrics to the song with Lennon. However, according to Doggett, Lennon made the \"briefest lyrical contributions\" that was \"enough\" to give him co-writing credit. Bowie would later say that Lennon was the \"energy\" and the \"inspiration\" for \"Fame\", and that's why he received a co-writing credit. Lennon would later contradict this story in a 1980 interview where he said: \"We took some Stevie Wonder middle eight and did it backwards, you know, and we made a record out of it!\" After the group solidified the riff, they emerged with something that was in the hand of \"black American music\" at the start of 1975: a \"cousin\" of \"Hollywood Swinging\" by Kool & the Gang, \"The Payback\" by James Brown, and \"Do It ('Til You're Satisfied)\" by B. T. Express. Doggett writes that other potential influences were the 1972 song \"Jungle Walk\" by the Rascals and the 1974 songs \"Pick Up the Pieces\" by the Average White Band and \"Brighter Day\" by Keith Christmas, a friend of Bowie's. Overall, Doggett believes \"Fame\" resembled \"Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin)\" by Sly and the Family Stone which, like \"Fame\", is in the funk style with \"viciously pointed\" lyrics.\n\n\"Fame\" is a funk rock song that represents Bowie's (and Lennon's) dissatisfaction with the troubles of fame and stardom, including \"money-grabbing managers, mindless adulation, unwanted entourages and the hollow vacuity of the limousine lifestyle\". Lennon's voice is heard interjecting the falsetto \"Fame\" throughout the song. Doggett found it \"striking\" that the falsetto expanded three octaves, from \"Yoko Ono soprano\" to \"Johnny Cash basso profundo\". Along with \"Fame\", Bowie worked with Lennon again when he decided to record a cover of Lennon's Beatles song \"Across the Universe\"; Lennon played rhythm guitar on the cover. According to Spitz, \"Fame\" and \"Across the Universe\" were both last-minute additions to \"Young Americans\". Although \"Young Americans\" was mostly co-produced by Tony Visconti, he was not present at the sessions for \"Fame\"; instead, both songs were co-produced by engineer Harry Maslin. In the song, Bowie sings \"What you need, you have to borrow\" with, according to Spitz, the same \"venom\" that Jimi Hendrix sang, \"Businessmen they drink my wine,\" on his cover of Bob Dylan's \"All Along the Watchtower\".\n\n\"Fame\" was released on 7 March 1975 as the final track on Bowie's ninth studio album \"Young Americans\". It was subsequently released by RCA Records (as PB 10320) as the second single to the album on 25 July 1975 with fellow album track \"Right\" as the B-side. \"Fame\" became Bowie's biggest hit to that point in the US. It was his first number one hit on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart, as well as his first to break the top 10, but would only reach number 17 in the UK Singles Chart. Bowie would later claim that he had \"absolutely no idea\" that the song would do so well as a single, saying \"I wouldn't know how to pick a single if it hit me in the face.\"\n\nDave Thompson of AllMusic calls the track \"a hard-funking dance storm whose lyrics -- a hostile riposte on the personal cost of success -- utterly belie the upbeat tempo and feel of the song.\" Following Bowie's death in 2016, \"Rolling Stone\" listed it as one of Bowie's 30 essential songs. In 2018, the writers of \"NME\", in their list of Bowie's 41 greatest songs, ranked \"Fame\" at number 21.\n\nThe song is one of four of Bowie's songs to be included in The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll.\n\n\n\n\n\nA remixed version of \"Fame\" was released by EMI in 1990 to coincide with the Sound+Vision Tour, the release of the \"Changesbowie\" compilation, and the \"Pretty Woman\" soundtrack. Bowie wanted to remix a successful American single for the tour and album release; of the two options (\"Let's Dance\" and \"Fame\"), \"Let's Dance\" was simply too recent. Bowie liked the choice: \"It covers a lot of ground, Fame; it stands up really well in time. It still sounds potent. It's quite a nasty, angry little song. I quite like that.\" The \"Gass Mix\" was subsequently included on the \"Pretty Woman\" soundtrack.\n\nSong written by David Bowie, Carlos Alomar, and John Lennon.\n\nUS CD single (Rykodisc RCD5 1018)\n\nWest Germany maxi CD single (EMI CDP 560-20-3805-2)\n\n\"Exclusive Changes pack\" 7\" vinyl single (FAMES 90)\n\nLimited edition 7\" vinyl picture disc (FAME PD 90)\n\n\nFilm director Gus Van Sant directed the promotional video for this version, which featured clips from many of Bowie’s previous videos. In the music video, Bowie also performs a dance with Louise Lecavalier, one of the main dancers of the Québécois contemporary dance troupe La La La Human Steps (whom Bowie would collaborate with on the \"Sound + Vision\" tour). The US version of the video replaces some of Bowie's music videos for scenes from the movie \"Pretty Woman\".\n\nDavid Bowie's \"Fame\" was used as the soundtrack of an animated music video of the same title, directed by Richard Jefferies and Mark Kirkland while students at California Institute of the Arts. The film, released in 1975, went on to win the Student Academy Award for animation and aired on NBC's \"The Midnight Special\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2202111", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2202111", "title": "Incense trade route", "text": "Incense trade route\n\nThe incense trade route included a network of major ancient land and sea trading routes linking the Mediterranean world with eastern and southern sources of incense, spices and other luxury goods, stretching from Mediterranean ports across the Levant and Egypt through Northeastern Africa and Arabia to India and beyond. The incense land trade from South Arabia to the Mediterranean flourished between roughly the 7th century BC and the 2nd century AD. The incense trade route served as a channel for the trading of goods such as Arabian frankincense and myrrh; from Southeast Asia Indian spices, precious stones, pearls, ebony, silk and fine textiles; and from the Horn of Africa, rare woods, feathers, animal skins, Somali frankincense, and gold.\n\nThe Egyptians had traded in the Red Sea, importing spices, gold and exotic wood from the \"Land of Punt\" and from Arabia. Indian goods were brought in Arabian and Indian vessels to Aden. Rawlinson identifies the long-debated \"ships of Tarshish,\" as a Tyrian fleet equipped at Ezion-Geber that made several trading voyages to the east bringing back gold, silver, ivory and precious stones. These goods were transshipped at the port of Ophir.\n\nAccording to one historian:\n\nAmong the most important trading points of the incense trade route from the Persian Gulf to the Mediterranean Sea was Gerrha in the Persian Gulf, reported by the historian Strabo to have been founded by Babylonian exiles as a Chaldean colony. Gerrha exercised influence over the incense trade routes across Arabia to the Mediterranean and controlled the aromatics trade to Babylon in the 1st century BC. Gerrha was one of the important entry ports for goods shipped from India.\n\nDue to its prominent position in the incense trade, Yemen attracted settlers from the Fertile Crescent. The frankincense and myrrh trees were crucial to the economy of Yemen and were recognized as a source of wealth by its rulers. Recent exploration discovered an ancient trade route through eastern Yemen in the Mahra region.\nAssyrian documents indicate that Tiglath-Pileser III advanced through Phoenicia to Gaza. Gaza was eventually sacked and the ruler of Gaza escaped to Egypt but later continued to act as a vassal administrator. The motive behind the attack was to gain control of the South Arabian incense trade which had prospered along the region. \n\nI.E.S. Edwards connects the Syro-Ephraimite War to the desire of the Israelites and the Aramaeans to control the northern end of the Incense Route, which ran up from Southern Arabia and could be tapped by commanding Transjordan. Archaeological inscriptions also speak of booty retrieved from the land of the \"mu-u-na-a-a\", possibly \"Meunites\" mentioned in the Old Testament. Some scholars identify this group as the Minaeans of South Arabia, who were involved with the incense trade and occupied the northern trading outposts of the Incense Route.\n\nAromatics from Dhofar and luxury goods from India brought wealth to the kingdoms of Arabia. The aromatics of Dhofar were shipped out from the natural harbour of Khor Rori towards the western inhospitable South Arabian coast. The caravans carried these products north to Shabwa and from there on to the kingdoms of Qataban, Saba, Ma'in, and Palestine up to Gaza. The tolls levied by the owners of wells and other facilities added to the overall cost of these luxury goods.\n\nThe Nabateans built Petra, which stood halfway between the opening to the Gulf of Akaba and the Dead Sea at a point where the Incense Route from Arabia to Damascus was crossed by the overland route from Petra to Gaza. This position gave the Nabateans a hold over the trade along the Incense Route. In order to control the Incense Route from the Nabatean a Greek military expedition lead by Swan was undertaken, without success, by Antigonus Cyclops, one of Alexander of Macedonia's generals. The Nabatean control over trade increased and spread to the West and the North. The replacement of Greece by the Roman empire as the administrator of the Mediterranean basin led to the resumption of direct trade with the east. According to a historian \"The South Arabs in protest took to pirate attacks over the Roman ships in the Gulf of Aden. In response, the Romans destroyed Aden and favoured the Western Abyssinian coast of the Red Sea.\" The monopoly of the Indian and Arab middlemen weakened with the development of monsoon trade by the Greeks through the discovery of the direct route to India (Hippalus), forcing the Parthian and Arabian middlemen to adjust their prices so as to compete on the Roman market with the goods now being bought in by a direct sea route to India. Indian ships sailed to Egypt as the maritime routes of Southern Asia were not under the control of a single power.\n\nAccording to one historian:\n\nAn earlier commentator on the significance of the trade, in terms of the connectivity of civilisations on both sides of the Red Sea from the time of the Queen of Sheba, was the British explorer Theodore Bent; it was Bent who identified the trading site of Moscha Limen in February 1895. Frankincense from Dhofar was collected at Moscha Limen. It was shipped to Qana and taken overland to Shabwa and further North to Najran, Mecca, Medina, Petra and to Gaza on the Mediterranean Sea. It was also shipped to Babylon and Palmyra via the Persian Gulf.\n\nThe Roman trade with India kept increasing, and according to Strabo (II.5.12.):\n\nAccording to a historian:\n\nAt the end of the sixth century Isidore of Seville enumerated the aromatics still being imported into Visigothic Spain. Of aromatic trees (\"de arboris aromaticis\") Isidore listed in his encyclopedia myrrh, pepper, cinnamon, \"amomum\" (cardamom?) and cassia; of aromatic herbs (\"de herbis aromaticis\"), nard, saffron, cardamom, will have arrived through the trade routes, others were available in Spain: thyme, aloes, rose, violet, lily, gentian, wormwood, fennel and others.\n\nThe decline of the incense trade saw Yemen take to the export of coffee via the Red Sea port of al-Mocha.\n\nFollowing the Roman-Persian Wars the areas under the Roman Byzantine Empire were captured by Khosrow I of the Persian Sassanian Dynasty. The Arabs, led by 'Amr ibn al-'As, crossed into Egypt in late 639 or early 640.\n\nThis advance marked the beginning of the Islamic conquest of Egypt and the fall of ports such as Alexandria, used to secure trade with India by the Greco-Roman world since the Ptolemaic dynasty.\n\nFinally, the Ottoman Turks conquered Constantinople in the 15th century, marking the beginning of Turkish control over the most direct trade routes between Europe and Asia.\n\nUNESCO's World Heritage Committee meeting in November 27, 2000 in Cairns, Australia attached World Heritage Site status to The Frankincense Trail in Oman. The official citation reads: \n\nThe World Heritage Committee, headed by Themba Wakashe, recorded Incense Route - Desert Cities in the Negev on UNESCO’s World Heritage List on July 15, 2005.

{"id": "2202121", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2202121", "title": "Ascaridia galli", "text": "Ascaridia galli\n\nAscaridia galli is a parasitic roundworm belonging to the phylum Nematoda. Nematodes of the genus \"Ascaridia\" are essentially intestinal parasites of birds. \"A. galli\" is the most prevalent and pathogenic species, especially in domestic fowl, \"Gallus domesticus\". It causes ascaridiasis, a disease of poultry due to heavy worm infection, particularly in chickens and turkeys. It inhabits the small intestine, and can be occasionally seen in commercial eggs.\n\nIt is the largest nematode in birds, with females measuring 72 to 112 mm long. The body is semitransparent, creamy-white, and cylindrical. The anterior end is characterized by a prominent mouth, which is surrounded by three large, trilobed lips. The edges of the lips bear teeth-like denticles. The body is entirely covered with a thick proteinaceous structure called cuticle. The cuticle is striated transversely through the length of the body and cuticular alae are poorly developed. Two conspicuous papillae are situated on the dorsal lip and one on each of the subventral lips. These papillae are the sensory organs of the nematode. \"A. galli\" is diecious with distinct sexual dimorphism. Females are considerably longer and more robust, with a vulva opening at the middle portion (roughly midway from anterior and posterior ends) of the body and anus at the posterior end of the body. The tail end of females is characteristically blunt and straight. Males are relatively shorter and smaller (measuring 50 to 76 mm long), with a distinct pointed and curved tail. Ten pairs of caudal papillae are found towards the tail region of the body, and they are arranged linearly in well-defined groups such as precloacal (three pairs), cloacal (one pair), postcloacal (one pair), and subterminal (three pairs) papillae. Eggs found in the feces of infected birds are oval with smooth shells and measure 73-92 by 45-57 microns.\n\nThe lifecycle of \"A. galli\" is direct in a single host, involving two principal populations, namely the sexually mature parasite in the gastrointestinal tract and the infective stage (L2). The eggs are oval in shape and have thick, albuminous shells that are highly resistant to desiccation and persist for a long time in the environment. Larvae do not hatch, but moult inside the eggs until they reach the L2 stage. This can take about two weeks, but the period depends on other factors such as the weather condition. The lifecycle is completed when the infective eggs are ingested by new hosts through contaminated water or feed. The eggs containing the L2-larvae-passive are mechanically transported to the duodenum, where they molt and become larvae stage 3 and then larvae stage 4. The infective eggs are ingested by a chicken; when it reaches the proventriculus, it hatches. Temperature, carbon dioxide levels, and pH are thought to be triggering factors that signal the larva to hatch from its egg. The larva then burrows into the mucosal lining of the small intestine, where it undergoes two additional molts. In this phase of their lifecycle, these worms cause the most damage to their hosts. They then re-enter the small intestine and develop into adults, where they live their lives out feeding on gut content and making a vast number of eggs that would then be excreted by a host and free to continue their lifecycle. If the animal is able to mount an immune response to the larvae, i.e. from pre-exposure, the larvae do not develop into adults, but hide in the mucosa of the small intestine. This is common for infection of older birds. Transport hosts such as earthworms are thought to play a role in transmission of \"A. galli\", hence free range birds tend to have a higher risk of infection.\n\nThe nematode infects fowl of all ages, but the greatest degree of damage is often found in birds under 12 weeks of age. Heavy infection is the major cause of weight depression and reduced egg production in poultry husbandry. In severe infections, intestinal blockage can occur. Unthriftiness, drooping of the wings, bleaching of the head, and emaciation are seen. Infection also causes loss of blood, reduced blood sugar content, increased urates, shrunken thymus glands, retarded growth, and greatly increased mortality. In heavy infections, adult worms may move up the oviduct and be found in hens' eggs, and sometimes they are also found in the birds' feces.\n\nPiperazine is the drug of choice. Continuous medication in feed with hygromycin B is also widely employed. Piperazine may be administered to chickens in the feed (0.2-0.4%) or water (0.1-0.2%), or as a single treatment (50–100 mg/bird). However, piperazine is quite ineffective for young chickens, while tetramisole is 89-100% effective for chicken of different ages. More recent drugs such as albendazole and levamisole are also highly effective. Fenbendazole is also very effective, 99.2-100% and 69.0-89.6% effective at administration doses of 60.6 ppm and 30.3 ppm. Ivermectin was also demonstrated to be 90 and 95% effective against immature and adult worms, respectively.\n\n"}

It is a part of the Highland Park Independent School District, which serves approximately 32,200 residents who are predominantly college-educated professionals and business leaders in the Dallas community. It serves all of the city of University Park, most of the town of Highland Park, and portions of Dallas.\n\nAs of the 2016-17 school year, Highland Park had an enrollment of 2,160 students and 153.19 teaching staff (on an FTE basis). The CEEB code for Highland Park High School is 441740. The campus code for TEA reporting purposes is 057911001 (based on the HPISD code of 057911).\n\nThe first building was the yellow brick schoolhouse of the Armstrong School which opened on October 12, 1915. The Armstrong School only served children through ninth grade. In 1922, the high school moved to its own separate building on Normandy Avenue following HPISD's purchase of 11 lots in 1920. The tenth grade was added in the fall of 1922, and the eleventh grade a year later. In 1924, 34 students became the first graduating class of the Highland Park Independent School District when they participated in the first-ever high school graduation ceremony of HPISD on June 2, 1924 (at that time, only eleven years of school were required prior to college admittance; it was not until 1937 that the twelfth grade was added.) The school yearbook for that year, the 1924 \"Highlander\", had a paragraph reading:Many schools live merely on the momentum and traditions they have gathered in the more flourishing days of past. We are proud of our short past, but we are prouder of the Highland Park High School that is to be.This first location (at the corner of Normandy Avenue and High School Avenue) later became the district's middle school in 1937 when the current Highland Park High School building was erected on Emerson Avenue. The old building became the Highland Park Junior High School, which in later years was renamed Arch H. McCulloch Middle School. The school added the fifth grade and split into Highland Park Middle School for grades 7 and 8 and Arch H. McCulloch Intermediate School for 5th and 6th graders upon moving to a new facility after which the old building was demolished. The street adjacent to the current middle school is named High School Avenue to this day.\n\nEugene Lawler was the first principal. The complete list of principals through the present day is as follows:\nWiseman, Sr. was principal for 34 years, retiring in 1962. Wiseman was a decorated Captain in the United States Army and served in combat during World War II. Wiseman was featured in 1960 in \"Look Magazine\"'s May edition. Wiseman is credited for developing the first language laboratory in a public school in the United States. Convinced that students learned quickly by what they heard, he solicited funds from several prominent Highland Park businessmen to provide the reel-to-reel tape recorders needed to record and re-play the daily lesson plan. He then created a language lab. Mr. Wiseman had the first remedial reading classes in a public school in the United States for the condition known today as dyslexia, Mr. Wiseman tutored his own grandson,\n\nIn 1987 the HPISD school board voted to not to petition the University Interscholastic League (UIL) to keep Highland Park High School in athletic class 5A; the UIL had the possibility of demoting Highland Park High School to athletic class 4A as part of its biannual reclassification. Since then, an old joke told around the UIL's bi-annual reclassification is that the cutoff for Class 4A is \"Highland Park plus two\", though in practice the school's enrollment has been well below the normal cutoff. In the 2014 reclassifications, the school moved up to 6A (a new classification added by the UIL as part of a larger reclassification). In the 2016 reclassifications, the school moved down to 5A. Much speculation over the upcoming 2018 reclassifications exists; there is a possibility the school will move back up to 6A. The average class size is 30 students per teacher, with about 550 students in a grade.\n\nIn 2003, a four-year remodeling of the school was completed which added a new wing to provide more classroom space and allow for a new, larger cafeteria. In 2015, a $361.4 million bond package passed HPISD board approval and citizens' vote which would allow for new parking spaces and renovations to the attached tennis center and natatorium—eventually eliminating the natatorium and replacing it with classrooms.\n\nCurrently, Highland Park High School is the only high school in the Highland Park Independent School District.\n\nOther schools in the district include University Park Elementary, Robert S. Hyer Elementary, John S. Armstrong Elementary, John S. Bradfield Elementary and a fifth school which has not yet been named. These five schools feed into Arch H. McCulloch Intermediate School and Highland Park Middle School, both of which are housed in the same building.\n\nIn 1999, Dallas police issued 200 alcohol and curfew violations citations to Park Cities teens partying in a Deep Ellum warehouse. CNN picked up the story, and after it emerged that parents had rented the facility and contracted a bus company to safely deliver high school students to and from the party, the Alliance on Underage Drinking (ALOUD) started the \"Parents Who Host, Lose the Most\" campaign, which informs parents about health, safety and legal ramifications of serving alcohol to underage individuals.\n\nIn late 2004, Simon & Schuster published young adult author Francine Pascal's \"The Ruling Class\", a teen drama set at Highland Park High School. The school's newspaper \"The Bagpipe\" published community reactions to the book and online reviews are mixed.\n\nIn late 2005, \"The Dallas Morning News\" published a story about the Friday of Highland Park's homecoming spirit week, on which several seniors dressed as thugs, Mexicans, maids and other caricatures of racial minorities. Some pointed to this as support for the general perception of Highland Park High School and the Park Cities as a \"bubble\" (as the area is known in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex). The article ignited a storm of letter-writing and editorializing to and in the Morning News. Soon after the article was published, two swastikas were spray-painted on a sign in front of the school.\n\nIn 2005 and 2006, Highland Park students received a multitude of state and national awards, and established several new records in Texas. The UIL Science Team, under the leadership of AP Chemistry teacher Wenzen Chuang, won state for the second time in the history of the high school. \"The Bagpipe\" newspaper received the Gold Crown Award for excellence in journalism in 2005 and later that year was one of 15 high schools in the country to win an NSPA Pacemaker. The same year, the school's yearbook, \"The Highlander\", was chosen as a finalist for the NSPA Pacemaker award and \"Highland Park Television\" was chosen as a finalist for the NSPA Broadcast Pacemaker; \"Highland Park Television\" won the award the following year. \"The Bagpipe\" received a second Gold Crown Award in 2011, for the previous year's newspaper.\n\nIn the winter of 2012 and the early spring of 2013, numerous bomb threats were found across the campus. Students and faculty were released early three times, and eventually the FBI was called in. An arrest was made in April 2013.\n\nIn 2013, the stage of the high school's auditorium (Palmer Auditorium) was honorarily named after Linda Raya, a longtime drama teacher at the school. Raya's 40+ year career at Highland Park oversaw the production of countless theatrical productions, which now continue to be produced on the newly named Linda Raya Stage.\n\nHPISD, Highland Park High School, and Superintendent Dawson Orr received national attention in September 2014 for the controversial banning of seven books previously used in high school English studies, after a group of parents protested the contents of these books. The seven books were: \"The Art of Racing in the Rain,\" by Garth Stein; \",\" by David K. Shipler; \"Siddhartha,\" by Hermann Hesse; \"The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian,\" by Sherman Alexie; \"An Abundance of Katherines,\" by John Green; \"The Glass Castle,\" by Jeannette Walls; and \"Song of Solomon\" by Toni Morrison.\n\nSeptember 29, 2014, Orr reversed his decision to suspend the books, stating in an email to parents, \"I made the decision in an attempt to de-escalate the conflict, and I readily admit that it had the opposite effect. I take full responsibility for the decision, and I apologize for the disruption it has caused.\"\n\nIn 2015, Orr retired and was replaced by Dr. Tom Trigg who had previously served as the superintendent of Blue Valley Unified School District in Overland Park, Kansas. Dr. Trigg's salary upon hiring was notable for its size, coming in at a base of $325,000 (compared to Dallas ISD's superintendent salary of $306,000).\n\nIn 2005, \"Sports Illustrated\" listed HP as the best sports program in the state of Texas (16th in the US).\n\nThe baseball team's games are held at Scotland Yard (Highland Park), a cleverly named baseball field immediately north of the high school campus.\n\nThe Highland Park Girls Swimming and Diving team holds the record in all of UIL history for ten consecutive state titles.\n\nAs of the end of the 2018 season, the school's tennis team has won 19 state titles, making it the school's most successful sport. From the start of the 2008 season until November 2015, the team kept an unbroken winning streak of 174 consecutive matches won. The streak was broken on 11 November 2015 when Highland Park lost to New Braunfels in the 6A semi-finals, marking the first time since 1999 that Highland Park would not compete in the state championship. From 2008 through 2014, the team won 8 consecutive state titles. The team returned to win the 2016, 2017, and 2019 state titles.\n\nIn 1920s, Bryan Street High School players called Highland Park's football team the \"silk stocking boys.\" Games between the two caused so many riots between the spectators that they were banned from playing each other. Coach H. B. Howard was the football coach at the time. Dr. Shirley Hodges, a local Dallas pediatrician, served on the HPISD School Board and was the first team doctor for the football team.\n\nCoached by Rusty Russell (1942–45) and led by Doak Walker and Bobby Layne, the Scots made it to the championship game two consecutive times in 1944 and 1945. After losing 20-7 to Port Arthur in 1944, Highland Park battled Waco to a 7-7 tie in the 1945 state championship in front of a record 45,790-person crowd at the Cotton Bowl to become co-champions. In 1947, Highland Park lost the state final 22-13 to San Antonio Brackenridge, while in 1957 they defeated Port Arthur 21-9 under the guidance of Thurman Jones.\n\nThe Highland Park football team is currently coached by Randy Allen, who holds a 361-86-6 record as of 2016, making him the second winningest active high school football coach in Texas and the fourth winningest of all-time in Texas. In January 2014, Allen was chosen as recipient of the 2013 Grant Teaff Fellowship of Christian Athletes Lifetime Achievement Award, joining such coaching greats as Tony Dungy and Bobby Bowden. As of the end of the 2018 season, Allen has led the Scots to four state titles under his coaching (2005, 2016, 2017,and 2018).\n\nIn 2005, Matthew Stafford led Highland Park to an undefeated season for the 4A Division I state championship. The 2005 season was Highland Park's only undefeated, untied season in program history. After a highly successful college career at the University of Georgia, he was drafted first overall by the Detroit Lions at the 2009 NFL Draft. The team beat Marshall 59-0, the largest margin-of-victory ever in a UIL 11-man state championship football game.\n\nIn 2007, the Scots went undefeated into the state final against Austin Lake Travis, but lost 36-34.\n, Highland Park Scots football teams had made a state-record 49 playoff appearances.\n\nIn 2016, the Scots won the Division I 5A state final against Temple, Texas, 16-7.\n\nIn 2017, the Scots won the Division I 5A state final against Manvel, Texas, 53-49 on 22 December 2017 in front of 24,975 people in AT&T Stadium. The Scots overcame a 10-point deficit in the final three minutes of the game and won the game just as Manvel was one yard from scoring again. Together with the 2016 title, marked the school's first ever back-to-back state championship wins. The 2017 season broke the school record for the most points scored in a single season by the Scots with 732 points in 16 games. As of 2017, they have had eight state finals appearances (and won five of them).\n\nIn 2018, Highland Park won their 3rd straight state championship in a game against Shadow Creek and completed a perfect 16-0 record.\n\nIn 2019, the Scots were the Division I 5A divisional champions.\n\nThe Highland Park girls cross country team has set numerous records throughout the years; having sent a runner to the state meet every year since the first year the program was created. This cross country team has won more state championships than any other cross country team in the state of Texas.\n\nAs of the close of the 2017 season, the Highland Park boys lacrosse team has won 7 Division I and 4 Division II Texas High School Lacrosse League (THSLL) state championships. This includes two years (2012 and 2015) in which both the DI and DII teams won their respective state titles simultaneously. DII titles are notable for the reason that many Texas high schools do not compete at the DI level, making DII titles the highest achievement for many schools. The team has included 23 US Lacrosse All-Americans since 2004.\n\nThe DI team was coached by Derek Thomson through the 2017 season. Thomson led the team to all 7 DI titles and won the THSLL Coach of the Year award twice. Upon his retirement, Thomson was also awarded the Earl Bill Award by the THSLL commissioner. Beginning in the 2018 season,\n\nHighland Park has fostered the development of a total of 28 players who went on to play Division I NCAA lacrosse in college.\n\nOf the 7 DI state titles, it is notable that 3 have been in victories over St. Mark's School of Texas (2009, 2010, and 2012) and 2 have been in victories over the Episcopal School of Dallas (ESD) (2005 and 2008). St. Mark's and ESD are both located in Dallas near to Highland Park. Other rivals include Jesuit College Preparatory School of Dallas (another Dallas-based team) which beat Highland Park in the 2016 and 2017 state DI title games.\n\nUnique among Highland Park High School's sports, the lacrosse team is not school-run because lacrosse is not a UIL-sanctioned sport. The team runs as a private organization.\n\nThe drill team at Highland Park High School is called the Highland Park Belles. They perform dance routines at halftime during football games and during pep rallies, as well as attending other events. The Belles were founded in 1983–84 with Cathy Wheat as director. Wheat is a member of the National Drill Team Directors Hall of Fame. She was director of the Irving High School Toy Tigers for 10 years before founding the Belles for whom she served as director for 23 years. Angie Harmon, a Highland Park graduate, credits Wheat with inspiring her to have confidence as an actress. The Belles hold an annual fundraiser named \"Spaghetti Supper.\" They sell tickets to Highland Park students and staff and to the rest of the Highland Park community. All of the money raised goes to fund the team's needs. A girl must go through and pass a rigorous tryout process to become a member of the Belles.\n\n\n\nHighland Park holds the UIL record for most athletic state titles by one school: 77 (in all classes).\n\nStudents at Highland Park take the PSAT in grades 10 and 11 and thus qualify for National Merit Scholarship Program awards. The following table summarizes recent years' awards:\nAbout 99% of Highland Park students take the SAT or ACT. The average SAT score in 2015–16 was 1833 (out of 2400) compared to a national average score of 1243. The average ACT score in 2015–16 was a 27.6 (out of 36) compared to a national average score of 20.6.\n\nMost Highland Park students choose to take AP courses; Highland Park High School does not offer IB courses. The high school offers open enrollment for more than 20 AP courses. All students enrolled in AP courses are required by the high school to take the relevant AP exam. Of the students at Highland Park, 78.6% choose to take an AP class and the ensuing exam in May 2015 compared to the state average of 24.9%. To illustrate how many students take exams, in May 2017, 1,093 Highland Park students took a combined 2,900 AP exams. In May 2015, 78.9% of exams taken were also passed, meaning the student received a score of 3 or higher. That compares to a state passing rate of 49.1% in May 2015 and a national passing rate of 67% in May 2017.\n\nHighland Park High School has a graduation rate that is consistently above 98%, compared to the state average of 89.0% in 2015. The 6-year longitudinal graduation rate was 99.8% compared to the state average of 90.9%. 86.0% of HPHS graduates in 2015 were rated college-ready in both English Language Arts and Mathematics by the TEA compared to a state average of 35.0%. Scholarships offered to the graduating class of 2016 exceeded a comparable monetary value of $14,500,000—almost $30,000 per senior. After graduation, 94% of the graduating class of 2016 matriculated to a four-year college, including Harvard, Stanford, West Point, and Air Force. Other Highland Park graduates have studied at Princeton, Yale, Dartmouth, and other institutions.\n\nThe Highlander Band's performance includes making its first-ever UIL State Marching Band finals appearance in 2017 where the band made the top ten. Their success continued into 2019 when they earned 2nd place in the UIL State Marching Band finals, marking the highest state placement of the band in its history. The Highlander Band is currently under the direction of Reagan Brumley and Corey Parks.\n\nIn the September 1981 issue of \"Money Magazine\", Highland Park was ranked as one of the top twelve public high schools in the United States, and in January 1984 \"Parade Magazine\" listed Highland Park as among the top fifteen schools in the United States. In 2008, Highland Park was ranked 15th in Newsweek Magazine's list of the top public high schools in the United States, based on the Challenge Index by Jay Mathews. Highland Park High School has been named a National Blue Ribbon School on two occasions, in 1984-85 and again in 2007. In 2012, Highland Park was ranked 8th out of the top 10 high schools in North Texas by Children at Risk, a research and advocacy institute dedicated to helping children. In 2016, Highland Park was named one of \"America's Best High Schools\" by Newsweek Magazine and earned a spot on U.S. News & World Report's Gold Medal list of top high schools. In 2019, U.S. News & World Report ranked Highland Park the 210th best high school in the U.S. and 35th in Texas.\n\nIn 1995, the first Highland Park Literary Festival began as a collaboration between interested parents and the English Department. The event has become an annual festival where HPHS students have enjoyed meeting, working with, and learning from distinguished writers, including George Plimpton, Doug Wright, Michael Chabon, Marion Winik, Scott Simon, Tim O'Brien, Russell Banks, Anchee Min, Billy Collins, Tobias Wolff, and Jamie Ford.\n\nThe Park Cities (Highland Park and University Park) are often referred to as \"The Bubble.\"\n\nThe Texas Education Agency campus profiles state that the funds spent per student at Highland Park are similar in amount to those spent per student at Woodrow Wilson High School.\n\nThe average teacher's salary at HPHS is $60,770 compared to the state average of $51,891.\n\nAccording to \"The Dallas Morning News\", in 2005 the high school's ethnic makeup was about 99% white. By 2014, that number dropped to 90.3% of the graduating class being white. In 2015, 89.1% of the graduating class was white. In the 2015–16 school year, 88.4% of the Highland Park High School student body was white.\n\nIn the 2010–11 school year HPHS had no low income students. By the 2015–16 school year, that number remained at 0.0% economically disadvantaged students for the entire District. In 2010–11, 7.9% of the students were considered \"at risk,\" but in 2015–16 that rose to 11.4%. About 80% of students partake in extracurricular activities, and over 50% partake in athletic teams.\n\nBy 2011 a \"The Dallas Morning News\" report stated that 93% of HPHS students were \"college-ready\" (ready to attend post-secondary educational institutions).\n\nAlthough students are only required to complete 50 hours of community service to graduate, the graduating class of 2017 averaged 150 hours per senior.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The story was also included in the 1923 collection \"The Inimitable Jeeves\" as two separate chapters, \"Comrade Bingo\" and \"Bingo Has a Bad Goodwood\".\n\nIn the story, Bertie's friend Bingo Little falls in love with a revolutionary, Charlotte Rowbotham, and joins her communist group to win her affection.\n\nVarious groups make speeches in Hyde Park, including a communist group called \"Heralds of the Red Dawn\". One of them, a bearded man, denounces the Idle Rich to a crowd. Bingo Little's uncle, recently titled Lord Bittlesham, approaches Bertie. He owns Ocean Breeze, a horse on which Bertie has bet money for the Goodwood Cup. Presently, the bearded man loudly insults them.\n\nBertie later meets Bingo at a club. Bingo is in love with Charlotte Corday Rowbotham, a member of the Red Dawn. To impress Charlotte, Bingo joined the Red Dawn. He wore a beard to not be recognized, and was the man in Hyde Park. He wants to win enough money on Ocean Breeze to marry Charlotte, but has no capital to bet with. He invites himself to Bertie's flat the next day, and will bring Charlotte, as well as her father Rowbotham and Comrade Butt, both members of the Red Dawn.\n\nThe next day, they arrive at Bertie's home and dine. Rowbotham advises Bertie to join their group. He disapproves of Jeeves being a servant. Bingo and Charlotte flirt, and Comrade Butt, a rival for Charlotte's affections, is jealous. Bertie dislikes Charlotte.\n\nBertie meets Bingo and Lord Bittlesham in front of a club. Bittlesham is nervous. He has received a threatening letter from the bearded man. After Bittlesham leaves, Bingo shows Bertie that his uncle paid him fifty pounds to investigate the threat. Bingo will bet the money on Ocean Breeze.\n\nBingo and Charlotte spend time together. Jeeves meets with Comrade Butt one evening, and reports that Butt feels rejected.\n\nAt Goodwood, Bertie is disappointed when Ocean Breeze loses. Meanwhile, Lord Bittlesham is concerned because the bearded man, secretly Bingo, is there giving a speech. Bingo, who has lost his wager on Ocean Breeze, rants passionately against wealthy horse owners. Comrade Butt then speaks, but is less successful with the crowd than Bingo. After noticing Lord Bittlesham, Butt excites the crowd by exposing Bingo as Bittlesham's nephew, which gets Bingo in trouble with his uncle.\n\nTwo days later, Bertie learns that Bingo intends to go to the country for a while. Jeeves explains to Bertie that he informed Comrade Butt about Bingo being Lord Bittlesham's nephew. Pleased, Bertie tells Jeeves he may take the notes and coins on the dressing table, which amounts to fourteen pounds, one shilling, six pence, and a halfpenny.\n\nAt the beginning of the story, Bingo implies to Bertie that Lord Bittlesham must have paid a significant amount of money for his new title. This is a reference to the \"cash for honors\" scandal during that period, when Prime Minister David Lloyd George's government was accused of openly selling peerages at an unprecedented scale.\n\nThe story was illustrated by A. Wallis Mills in the \"Strand\", and by T. D. Skidmore in \"Cosmopolitan\". A collection of animal-related Wodehouse stories, \"A Wodehouse Bestiary\", published by Ticknor & Fields in 1985, featured the story. \n\n\"Comrade Bingo\" was included along with \"The Rummy Affair of Old Biffy\" in the 1976 anthology \"Classics of Humour\", illustrated by Donald Room and published by Book Club Association. The anthology was later reissued in 1978 with the title \"Great Tales of Humour\", published by Everyman's Library. \n\nThis story was adapted into part of the \"Jeeves and Wooster\" episode \"Aunt Dahlia, Cornelia and Madeline\", the sixth episode of the third series, which first aired in the UK on 3 May 1992. There are some differences in plot, including:\n\nThis story, along with the rest of \"The Inimitable Jeeves\", was adapted into a radio drama in 1973 as part of the series \"What Ho! Jeeves\" starring Michael Hordern as Jeeves and Richard Briers as Bertie Wooster.\n\n\n\n"}

It was first situated at Greenham Common near Newbury and then at Mongewell Park near Wallingford, Oxfordshire. It was one of the UK's only three Jewish boarding schools, the others being in Gateshead and Whittingehame College in Brighton. It also had a very small number of pupils who were not of Jewish descent, as day pupils. Carmel College alumni are known as \"Old Carmelis\"; in 1973 the school was referred to as the \"Jewish Eton\" by \"The Observer\" correspondent, Chaim Bermant.\n\nTypical boarding fees in 1996 were £10,000 per school term (i.e. £30,000 per year). From 1990 it was the most expensive boarding school in the country. There were many students from abroad, and some scholarships. \n\nThe school practised a mainstream Orthodox Judaism, more Orthodox than the practice of most of the pupils' families. \n\nThe school was founded in 1948 by the late Rabbi Dr Yaacov Kopul Rosen. It was closed in July 1997, mainly owing to diminishing pupil numbers and severe financial difficulties, having been seriously affected by the termination of government assisted places by the Labour government and the rise of the Jewish Day School Movement. The grounds were sold to property developers for an undisclosed sum. The sale was overturned by the Charity Commission, however, following significant pressure from parents and former students who claimed the land was undersold. The distinctive concrete synagogue, with its stained glass windows created by Israeli artist Nehemia Azaz, dining hall, and amphitheatre, designed by local architect Thomas Hancock, are Grade II listed buildings; the Julius Gottlieb gallery and boathouse, designed by Sir Basil Spence, is Grade II* listed.\n\nThe principals or headmasters were: the founder, Kopul Rosen, until his death in 1962; David Stamler, 1962–71; Kopul Rosen's eldest son, Jeremy Rosen, 1971–84; Philip Skelker, until the school closed.\n\nUpon closure of the school, many pupils were transferred to another boarding school in Bristol, Clifton College, which had, until May 2005 a Jewish boarding house, Polacks House.\n\nIn October 2015 former housemaster Trevor Bolton was convicted of abusing boys at the school over a period of 20 years.\n\nThe school grounds in Mongewell Park had the straightest run of the River Thames flowing past it, and Oxford University made full use of this during their preparation for the annual university boat race.\n\nIt was attended by children from the age of 11 until 18 – although earlier on there was a preparatory school which took children from around the age of 8. Later a girls' school was built – about a mile from the main campus, although the buildings were never actually used for this purpose. Instead, it was turned into a junior school in the late 1960s for children up to the age of 13, when they then moved to the main school. Girls were later admitted into the main school, starting at the sixth form in 1968. However, there were daughters of teachers at the school even before this, including the daughter of Carmel's founder Rabbi Kopul Rosen, who was a pupil in the late 1960s. The junior school was closed down several years before Carmel closed, and the buildings sold.\n\n\nThe Mansion House was an old manor house with particular significance. Agatha Christie (who lived nearby in Wallingford) used it as the basis for the mansion in her 1952 play \"The Mousetrap\".\nThe headmaster's study was also the room used for the final briefing of the reconnaissance mission following the Dam Busters raid. There is a pillbox on the school grounds, beside the river.\n\nA scene in the 2011 film \"The Iron Lady\", where Margaret Thatcher is perfecting her prime-ministerial voice, was shot on location within the synagogue of Carmel College.\n\nIn 2013 and 2014 Kylie Minogue and the Kaiser Chiefs shot videos in the school's Gymnasium.\n\nIn the 2016 film, \"Mindhorn\", the Carmel College synagogue is used as the location for scenes depicting the exterior and interior of fictional civic hall offices on the Isle of Man (approx timestamp 00:53:40 and 01:08:40).\n\nAlso in 2016, \"The Darkest Dawn\" on IMDB, the mansion house and gardens feature in the final 10 minutes of the film.\n\nThe science fiction film, \"Annihilation\" (2018), starring Natalie Portman, uses the Carmel College swimming pool and other areas for scenes involving the Fort Amaya military base (approx timestamp 00:42:05-00:49:05).\n\nIn 2017, the library of the mansion house was used for filming interior scenes of Stalin's living quarters in the film The Death of Stalin.\n\nIn 2018, the art room in the teaching block, the interior of the Julius Gottlieb Gallery, the exterior and interior of the mansion house, the lake and the ruined church were used in scenes from BBC's production of John le Carré's \"The Little Drummer Girl\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2202156", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2202156", "title": "Pichia pastoris", "text": "Pichia pastoris\n\nPichia pastoris is a species of methylotrophic yeast. It was found in the 1960s, with its feature of using methanol, as a source of carbon and energy. After years of study, \"P. pastoris\" was widely used in Biochemical research and Biotech industries. With strong potential for being an expression system for protein production, as well as being a model organism for genetic study, \"P. pastoris\" has become important for biological research and biotech applications. In the last decade, some reports reassigned \"P. pastoris\" to the genus Komagataella with phylogenetic analysis, by genome sequencing of \"P. pastoris\". The species was split into K. phaffii, K. pastoris, and K. pseudopastoris.\n\nNaturally, \"P. pastoris\" live on trees，such as chestnut trees. They are heterotrophs and they can use several carbon sources for living, like glucose, glycerol and methanol. However, they cannot use lactose.\n\n\"P. pastoris\" can undergo both asexual reproduction and sexual reproduction, by budding and ascospore. In this case, two types of cells of \"P. pastoris\" exist: haploid and diploid cells. In the asexual life cycle, haploid cells undergo mitosis for reproduction. In the sexual life cycle, diploid cells undergo sporulation and meiosis. The growth rate of its colonies can vary by a large range, from near to 0 to a doubling time of one hour, which is suitable for industrial processes.\n\nIn the last few years, \"P. pastoris\" was investigated and identified as a good model organism with several advantages. First of all, \"P. patoris\" can be grown and used easily in lab. Like other widely used yeast models, it has relatively short life span and fast regeneration time. Moreover, some inexpensive culture media have been designed, so that \"P. patoris can grow quickly on them, with high cell density.\nWhole genome sequencing for \"P. patoris\" had been performed. The \"P. pastoris\" GS115 genome has been sequenced by the Flanders Institute for Biotechnology and Ghent University, and published in \"Nature Biotechnology\". The genome sequence and gene annotation can be browsed through the ORCAE system. The complete genomic data allows scientists to identify homologous proteins and evolutionary relationships between other yeast species and \"P. pastoris\". Furthurmore, \"P. pastoris\" are single eukaryotic cells, which means researchers could investigate the proteins inside \"P. pastoris\". Then the homologous comparison to other more complicated eukaryotic species can be processed, to obtain their functions and origins.\n\nAnother advantage of \"P. pastoris\" is its similarity to the well-studied yeast model--Saccharomyces cerevisiae. As a model organism for biology, \"S. cerevisiae\" have been well studied for decades and used by researchers for various purposes throughout history. The two yeast genera; \"Pichia\" and \"Saccharomyces\", have similar growth conditions and tolerances; thus, the culture of \"P. pastoris\" can be adopted by labs without many modifications. Moreover, unlike \"S. cerevisiae\", \"P. pastoris\" has the ability to functionally process proteins with large molecular weight, which is useful in a translational host.\nConsidering all the advantages, \"P. pastoris\" can be usefully employed as both a genetic and experimental model organism.\n\nAs a genetic model organism, \"P. pastoris\" can be used for genetic analysis and large-scale genetic crossing, with complete genome data and its ability to carry out complex eukaryotic genetic processing in a relatively small genome. The functional genes for peroxisome assembly were investigated by comparing wild-type and mutant strains of \"P. pastoris\".\n\nAs an experimental model organism, \"P. pastoris\" was mainly used as the host system for transformation. Due to its ablities of recombination with foreign DNA and processing large proteins, much research has been carry out to investigate the possibility of producing new proteins and the function of artificially designed proteins, using \"P. pastoris\" as a transformation host. In the last decade, \"P. pastoris\" was engineered to build expression system platforms, which is a typical application for a standard experimental model organism, as described below.\n\n\"P. pastoris\" is frequently used as an expression system for the production of heterologous proteins. Several properties make \"P. pastoris\" suited for this task. Currently, several strains of \"P. pastoris\" are developed for different requirements of the expression system. Most of them have a mutation in the HIS4 gene, leading to the selection of cells which are transformed successfully with expression vectors. The technology for vector integration into \"P. pastoris\" genome is similar to that in \"Saccharomyces cerevisiae\".\n\n1:\"P. pastoris\" is able to grow on simple, inexpensive medium, with high growth rate. \"P. pastoris\" can grow in either shake flasks or a fermenter, which makes it suitable for both small- and large-scale production.\n\n2:\"P. pastoris\" has two alcohol oxidase genes, \"Aox1\" and \"Aox2\", which include strongly inducible promoters. These two genes allow \"Pichia\" to use methanol as a carbon and energy source. The AOX promoters are induced by methanol, and repressed by glucose. Usually, the gene for the desired protein is introduced under the control of the \"Aox1\" promoter, which means that protein production can be induced by the addition of methanol on medium. After several researches, scientists found that the promotor derived from \"AOX1\" gene in \"P. pastoris\" is extremely suitable to control the expression of foreign genes, which had been transformed into the \"P. pastoris\" genome, producing heterologous proteins.\n\n3: With a key trait, \"P. pastoris\" can grow with extremely high cell density on the culture. This feature is compatible with heterologous protein expression, giving higher yields of production.\n\n4: The technology required for genetic manipulation of \"P. pastoris\" is similar to that of \"Saccharomyces cerevisiae\", which is one of the most well-studied yeast model organisms. As a result, the experiment protocol and materials are easy to build for \"P. pastoris\".\n\nAs some proteins require chaperonin for proper folding, \"Pichia\" is unable to produce a number of proteins, since \"P. pastoris\" does not contain the appropriate chaperones. The technologies of introducing genes of mammalian chaperonins into the yeast genome and overexpressing existing chaperonins still require improvement\n\nIn standard molecular biology research, the bacterium \"Escherichia coli\" is the most frequently used organism for expression system, to produce heterologous proteins, due to its features of fast growth rate, high protein production rate, as well as undemanding growth conditions. Protein production in \"E. coli\" is usually faster than that in \"P. pastoris\", with reasons: Competent \"E. coli\" cells can be stored frozen, and thawed before use, whereas \"Pichia\" cells have to be produced immediately before use.Expression yields in Pichia vary between different clones, so that a large number of clones has to be screened for protein production, to find the best producer. The biggest advantage of \"Pichia\" over \"E. coli\" is that \"Pichia\" is capable of forming disulfide bonds and glycosylations in proteins, but \"E. coli\" cannot. \"E. coli\" might produce a misfolded protein when disulfides are included in final product, leading to inactive or insoluble forms of proteins.\n\nThe well-studied \"Saccharomyces cerevisiae\" is also used as an expression system with similar advantages over \"E. coli\" as \"Pichia\". However \"Pichia\" has two main advantages over \"S. cerevisiae\" in laboratory and industrial settings:\n\nComparing to other expression systems, such as S2-cells from \"Drosophila melanogaster\" and Chinese hamster ovary cells, \"Pichia\" usually gives much better yields.Generally, cell lines from multicellular organisms require complex and expensive types of media, including amino acids, vitamins, as well as other growth factors. These types of media significantly increase the cost of producing heterologous proteins. Additionally, since \"Pichia\" can grow in media containing only one carbon source and one nitrogen source, which is suitable for isotopic labelling applications, like protein NMR.\n\n\"P. pastoris\" have been used in several kinds of biotech industries, such as pharmaceutical industry. All the applications are based on its feature of expressing proteins.\n\nIn the last few years, \"Pichia pastoris\" had been used for the production of over 500 types of biotherapeutics, such as IFNγ. At the beginning, one drawback of this protein expression system is the over-glycosylation with high density of mannose structure, which is a potential cause of immunogenicity. In 2006, a research group managed to create a new strain called YSH597. This strain can express erythropoietin in its normal glycosylation form, by exchanging the enzymes responsible for the fungal type glycosylation, with the mammalian homologs. Thus, the altered glycosylation pattern allowed the protein to be fully functional.\n\nIn food industries, like brewery and bake house,\"Pichia pastoris\" is used to produce different kinds of enzymes, as processing aids and food additives, with many functions. For example, some enzymes produced by genetically modified \"Pichia pastoris\" can keep the bread soft. Meanwhile, in beer, enzymes could be used to lower the alcohol concentration.\n"}
{"id": "2202164", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2202164", "title": "Mixed transcortical aphasia", "text": "Mixed transcortical aphasia\n\nMixed transcortical aphasia is the least common of the three transcortical aphasias (behind transcortical motor aphasia and transcortical sensory aphasia, respectively). This type of aphasia can also be referred to as \"Isolation Aphasia\". This type of aphasia is a result of damage that isolates the language areas (Broca’s, Wernicke’s, and the arcuate fasciculus) from other brain regions. Broca’s, Wernicke’s, and the arcuate fasiculus are left intact; however, they are isolated from other brain regions.\n\nA stroke is one of the leading causes of disability in the United States. Following a stroke, 40% of stroke patients are left with moderate functional impairment and 15% to 30% have a severe disability as a result of a stroke. A neurogenic cognitive-communicative disorder is one result of a stroke. Neuro- meaning related to nerves or the nervous system and -genic meaning resulting from or caused by. Aphasia is one type of a neurogenic cognitive-communicative disorder which presents with impaired comprehension and production of speech and language, usually caused by damage in the language-dominant, left hemisphere of the brain. Aphasia is any disorder of language that causes the patient to have the inability to communicate, whether it is through writing, speaking, or sign language.\n\nMixed transcortical aphasia is characterized by severe speaking and comprehension impairment, but with preserved repetition. People who suffer mixed transcortical aphasia struggle greatly to produce propositional language or to understand what is being said to them, yet they can repeat long, complex utterances or finish a song once they hear the first part. Persons with mixed transcortical aphasia are often nonfluent, and in most cases do not speak unless they are spoken to, do not comprehend spoken language, cannot name objects, and cannot read or write. However, they often have the ability to repeat what is said to them. In fact, persons with mixed transcortical aphasia often repeat in a parrot-like fashion. Some patients with this disorder can experience many different types neurological symptoms including, bilateral paralysis, lack of voluntary speech, and difficulty with producing spontaneous speech.\n\nA conversation between a clinician and person with transcortical mixed aphasia would have similar characteristics to the conversation below:\n\nIn this rare type of aphasia, Broca's area, Wernicke's area, and the arcuate fasciculus are intact but the watershed region around them is damaged. This damage isolates these areas from the rest of the brain. The most frequent etiology of mixed transcortical aphasia is stenosis (narrowing) of the internal carotid artery. Mixed transcortical aphasia can also occur after cerebral hypoxia, cerebral swelling, and any stroke that affects the cerebral artery. Often lesions that cause mixed transcortical aphasia affect both the anterior and posterior perisylvian border zones. Some times the type of aphasia can be determined just by knowing the lesion location. In order for a patient to be diagnosed with mixed transcortical aphasia all other forms of transcortical must be ruled out. Using WAB or the BDAE can rule out global aphasia if the ability to repeat is present. If verbal fluency is depressed transcortical aphasia gets ruled out and if auditory processing and comprehension is weak then it cannot be transcortical motor aphasia.\n\nAfter a stroke, many patients feel the devastating impacts of the loss of language. Studies have looked into ways to enhance verbal communication with therapy, and one of the treatment approaches that proved to be successful is \"Drawing Therapy\". Drawing offers an alternative route to access semantic information. Because of this, it provides adults who have lost language with a means to access and express their ideas, emotions, and feelings. Drawing has also been shown to activate right hemisphere regions. This makes drawing a non-linguistic intervention that can access semantic knowledge in the right hemisphere. The study conducted on drawing therapy found that it increased naming abilities in patients with acute and chronic aphasia. It also produced fewer error attempts during naming tasks. The study also found that the act of drawing itself, not the quality, was critical for the activation of the semantic-lexical network required for naming tasks. Other studies have also reported that family members have seen the effects of therapy at home. The gains made from drawing therapy were not ones that could have been made from spontaneous recovery. Drawing therapy was especially found to be useful in individuals with global and anomic aphasia. Both of these individuals were found to have produced more verbalizations post-therapy. This reinforces the idea that drawing provides a mean of recruiting areas or networks that were not otherwise sufficient for producing speech. Across the majority of patients, the quality of drawing improved as well as written output and sentence structure. Drawing therapy has proved to be effective even after a few periods of therapy.\n\nAlthough this therapy is aimed at patients with aphasia, it can be implemented for any patient with expressive deficits.\nDrawing therapy can be implemented in the following hierarchy:\n\nDrawing therapy can also be made harder through the type of prompt given and the task difficulty. Prompts and questions that are opened ended and with broad semantic categories are going to be harder to conceptualize and draw. It is a harder task when the client is asked to draw abstract concepts or sequenced actions/events.\nOverall, drawing therapy offers a means of accessing language to patients with aphasia who have difficulty expressing themselves with different modalities.\n\nFor most patients, formal and informal language assessments are initially administered during his/her acute hospital stay by a licensed speech-language pathologist. However, a standardized assessment may provide further information regarding an aphasia classification. While there are different classifications of aphasia (i.e., Broca’s, Wernicke’s, Conduction, Anomia), they each have hallmark deficits. Research has shown, a patient presenting with mixed transcortical aphasia will have impairments in all communicative areas, with the exception of the preserved ability to repeat a person’s words or phrases. Patients with mixed transcortical aphasia demonstrate similar deficits as those seen in patients with global aphasia. Therefore, assessment of repetition is most critical in order to differentially diagnose. Specifically, language based standardized assessments such as the Western Aphasia Battery (WAB), and the Folstein Mini Mental State Exam include a repetition subtest amongst all other language-related areas.\n\nOther possible assessments that can provide further differentiation include: \nMagnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) \nMagnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA)\nCT scan\nInformal observation\n\nIt is important to remain diligent in providing therapy regardless of aphasia classification.\n\nIf brain damage is minimal then a patient may recover language skills over time without treatment, however if the damage is severe it may be necessary to receive speech and language therapy. Recovery from this type of brain injury is a slow process and very few patients regain the same level of language and communication skills that they have before the injury. Patients with aphasia usually undergo speech therapy where they relearn and practice supplementary communication methods. Speech therapy is not a cure for the aphasia, but instead helps patients use skills that remain intact. When considering the prognosis for individuals with aphasia it is necessary to consider internal factors, patient specific factors, and external factors as these factors are considered most critical to post-stroke recovery. Internal factors are factors related to the stroke such as aphasia severity, lesion site and lesion size . Individuals with milder forms of aphasia, lesions that insignificantly impact language function and smaller lesions tend to have a higher degree of aphasia recovery. Lesions in the superior temporal gyrus (STG) produce a more persistent global aphasia, which is associated with poor aphasia recovery. Patient specific factors relate to the patient's age of onset, education level and motivation for recovery. Younger patients have been reported to demonstrate a higher recovery rate than older patients. Those with more years of education are less vulnerable to language disruption by stroke. External factors include environmental factors such as type and amount of language treatment provided. Stroke patients who are generally aware of their handicap and receive good support show more motivation and are more likely to have a better outcome.\n\n"}

In 2002, Shinwari was appointed Chief Justice by Afghan President Hamid Karzai.\n\nIn 2003 Shinwari spoke out against co-education—the education of boys and girls in shared facilities—while clarifying that he did not object to the education of girls and women in principle, just not in facilities shared with men and boys.\nShinwari also led the Supreme Court's efforts to ban Cable TV.\n\nAccording to \"Eurasianet\" Shinwari was responsible for re-instating the ministry formerly known as the \"Ministry for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice\".\n\nOn December 8, 2004\nShinwari administered the oath of office to Hamid Karzai when he was elected President of Afghanistan.\n\nShinwari addressed the 17 Afghan who had been held in Guantanamo whose Combatant Status Review Tribunals determined they had never been \"enemy combatants\" after all.\nTheir Tribunals had been held between August 2, 2004 and late January 2005.\nCarlotta Gall of \"The New York Times\" reported that the Chief Justice encouraged the men to regard their detention as something sent from God.\nThe reports stated that the Chief Justice warned the cleared men that a candid description of their detention could damage the chances of other Afghan captives to be released.\n\nShinwari is also reported to have distinguished between three categories of Guantanamo captives:\n\nIn 2006, President Karzai renominated Shinwari to the position of Chief Justice, despite constitutional concerns regarding his degree in Islamic law.\nHowever, the parliament rejected the nomination. Shinwari served as Chief Justice until a new candidate, Abdul Salam Azimi, was approved by parliament.\n\nBy Western standards, he was widely considered to be a very conservative Islamist, and in his short term as chief justice some of the court's rulings included:\n\n\nAccording to the International Crisis Group Shinwari appointed 128 judges, in addition to the original nine, and that of the credentials of 36 judges they were able to examine, none of the new judges had a degree in secular law:\n\nDuring Ramadan, 2008, there were rumors that Saudi King Abdullah was attempting to broker peace talks between the warring parties from Afghanistan. \nFormer Taliban Foreign Minister Wakil Ahmad Mutawakil former Taliban Ambassador to Pakistan Abdul Salem Zaeef and Shinwari were among leading Afghan figures who met with King Abdullah.\n\nZaeef acknowledged being invited by King Abdullah to dine with other leading Afghan figures, from the Karzai government, the Taliban, Gulbuddin Hekmatyar's Hezb-e-Islami and other former members of the Taliban.\nZaeef denied this meeting should be characterized as \"peace talks\". He stated that none of the individuals at this meeting had been authorized to conduct negotiations. Zaeef denied anyone discussed Afghanistan at this meeting.\n"}

It is named after József Marek, a Hungarian veterinarian. Marek's disease is caused by an alphaherpesvirus known as 'Marek's disease virus' (MDV) or \"Gallid alphaherpesvirus 2\" (GaHV-2). The disease is characterized by the presence of T cell lymphoma as well as infiltration of nerves and organs by lymphocytes. Viruses \"related\" to MDV appear to be benign and can be used as vaccine strains to prevent Marek's disease. For example, the related Herpesvirus of Turkeys (HVT), causes no apparent disease in turkeys and continues to be used as a vaccine strain for prevention of Marek's disease (see below). Birds infected with GaHV-2 can be carriers and shedders of the virus for life. Newborn chicks are protected by maternal antibodies for a few weeks. After infection, microscopic lesions are present after one to two weeks, and gross lesions are present after three to four weeks. The virus is spread in dander from feather follicles and transmitted by inhalation.\n\nSix syndromes are known to occur after infection with Marek's disease. These syndromes may overlap.\n\nDiagnosis of lymphoid tumors in poultry is complicated due to multiple etiological agents capable of causing very similar tumors. It is not uncommon that more than one avian tumor virus can be present in a chicken, thus one must consider both the diagnosis of the disease/tumors (pathological diagnosis) and of the virus (etiological diagnosis). A step-wise process has been proposed for diagnosis of Marek's disease which includes (1) history, epidemiology, clinical observations and gross necropsy, (2) characteristics of the tumor cell, and (3) virological characteristics\nThe demonstration of peripheral nerve enlargement along with suggestive clinical signs in a bird that is around three to four months old (with or without visceral tumors) is highly suggestive of Marek's disease. Histological examination of nerves reveals infiltration of pleomorphic neoplastic and inflammatory lymphocytes. Peripheral neuropathy should also be considered as a principal rule-out in young chickens with paralysis and nerve enlargement without visceral tumors, especially in nerves with interneuronal edema and infiltration of plasma cells.\n\nThe presence of nodules on the internal organs may also suggest Marek's disease, but further testing is required for confirmation. This is done through histological demonstration of lymphomatous infiltration into the affected tissue. A range of leukocytes can be involved, including lymphocytic cell lines such as large lymphocyte, lymphoblast, primitive reticular cells, and occasional plasma cells, as well as macrophage and plasma cells. The T cells are involved in the malignancy, showing neoplastic changes with evidence of mitosis. The lymphomatous infiltrates need to be differentiated from other conditions that affect poultry including lymphoid leukosis and reticuloendotheliosis, as well as an inflammatory event associated with hyperplastic changes of the affected tissue.\n\nKey clinical signs as well as gross and microscopic features that are most useful for differentiating Marek's disease from lymphoid leukosis and reticuloendotheliosis include (1) Age: MD can affect birds at any age, including <16 weeks of age; (2) Clinical signs: Frequent wing and leg paralysis; (3) Incidence: >5% in unvaccinated flocks; (4) Potential nerve enlargement; (5) Interfollicular tumors in the bursa of Fabricius; (6) CNS involvement; (7) Lymphoid proliferation in skin and feather follicles; (8) Pleomorphic lymphoid cells in nerves and tumors; and (9) T-cell lymphomas.\n\nIn addition to gross pathology and histology, other advanced procedures used for a definitive diagnosis of Marek's disease include immunohistochemistry to identify cell type and virus-specific antigens, standard and quantitative PCR for identification of the virus, virus isolation to confirm infections, and serology to confirm/exclude infections.\n\nThe World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) reference laboratory for Marek's disease is Avian Viral Oncogenesis group (led by Professor Venugopal Nair OBE) at The Pirbright Institute, UK .\n\nPCR blood testing can also detect Mareks Disease, and proper testing can differentiate between a vaccinated bird with antibodies and a true positive for Mareks Disease.\n\nMareks Disease is not treatable, however supportive care can help.\n\nIt is recommended that all flocks positive for Mareks Disease remain closed, with no bird being introduced or leaving the flock. Strict bio security and proper cleaning is essential, using products like Activated Oxine or Virkon S and reducing dander buildup in the environment. Proper diet, regular deworming and vitamin supplements can also help keep infected flocks healthier. Reducing stress is also a key component, as stress will often bring about illness in birds infected with Mareks Disease.\n\nVaccination is the only known method to prevent the development of tumors when chickens are infected with the virus. However, administration of vaccines does not prevent transmission of the virus, i.e., the vaccine is not sterilizing. However, it does reduce the amount of virus shed in the dander, hence reduces horizontal spread of the disease. Marek's disease does not spread vertically. Before the development of the vaccine for Marek's disease, Marek's disease caused substantial revenue loss in the poultry industries of the United States and the United Kingdom. The vaccine can be administered to one-day-old chicks through subcutaneous inoculation or by \"in ovo\" vaccination when the eggs are transferred from the incubator to the hatcher. \"In ovo\" vaccination is the preferred method, as it does not require handling of the chicks and can be done rapidly by automated methods. Immunity develops within two weeks.\n\nHowever, because vaccination does not prevent infection with the virus, Mareks is still transmissible from vaccinated flocks to other birds, including the wild bird population. The first Marek's disease vaccine was introduced in 1970. The disease would cause mild paralysis, with the only identifiable lesions being in neural tissue. Mortality of chickens infected with Marek's disease was quite low. Decades after the first vaccine was introduced, current strains of Marek Virus cause lymphoma formation on throughout the chicken's body and mortality rates have reached 100% in unvaccinated chickens. The Marek's disease vaccine is a leaky vaccine, which means that only the symptoms of the disease are prevented. Infection of the host and the transmission of the virus are not inhibited by the vaccine. This contrasts with most other vaccines, where infection of the host is prevented. Under normal conditions, highly virulent strains of the virus are not selected. A highly virulent strain would kill the host before the virus would have an opportunity to transmit to other potential hosts and replicate. Thus, less virulent strains are selected. These strains are virulent enough to induce symptoms but not enough to kill the host, allowing further transmission. However, the leaky vaccine changes this evolutionary pressure and permits the evolution of highly virulent strains. The vaccine's inability to prevent infection and transmission allows the spread of highly virulent strains among vaccinated chickens. The fitness of the more virulent strains are increased by the vaccine.\n\nThe evolution of Marek's disease due to vaccination has had a profound effect on the poultry industry. All chickens across the globe are now vaccinated against Marek's disease (birds hatched in private flocks for laying or exhibition are rarely vaccinated). Highly virulent strains have been selected to the point that any chicken that is unvaccinated will die if infected. Other leaky vaccines are commonly used in agriculture. One vaccine in particular is the vaccine for avian influenza. Leaky vaccine use for avian influenza can select for virulent strains which could potentially be transmitted to humans.\n\n"}

In a career spanning almost sixty years, his theatrical career encompassed work in the UK, on the continent, and in the United States.\n\nAfter university and drama school he toured South Africa as an actor with the National Theatre of South Africa before hitch-hiking and working his passage to London. On arriving in England in 1953 he took a job with The Sunday Times, then Kemsley Newspapers, and starting writing plays in his spare time. His first acting engagement in the UK was in a summer season of weekly rep at the old Tivoli Theatre, New Brighton, extra work on television and a second summer season, this time on the Isle of Wight followed. Out of work periods saw him working in pubs, at Joe Lyons’ Cadby Hall, for a small-time publisher and cleaning people’s houses.\n\nAs an actor in London he appeared in \"Reunion In Vienna\" at The Piccadilly, \"The Gorky Brigade\" Royal Court, \"The Great Society\", \"Something Burning\", \"Treasure Island\", all at the Mermaid, \"Streamers\" at The Roundhouse, \"A Coat Of Varnish\" and \"Captain Brassbound’s Conversion\" at The Haymarket, \"Measure For Measure\" at The Open Space, \"Tsafendas\" at The Almost Free. He has also played leading roles in many provincial theatres, on tours and on the continent. His television appearances have been numerous and he has also worked in film and on radio, his credits being too lengthy to mention. His last UK television appearance was for the BBC when he gave a chilling performance as the pedophile murderer, Sidney Cooke in \"The Lost Boys\".\n\nWhilst working as actor he continued to write and had sixteen plays produced, the first in England being \"Oh Brother\" in Ipswich. Others include, in London, \"Early One Morning\" at the Arts Theatre, \"Champagne Charlie\", based on the life of the great Music Hall star, George Leybourne, at the Mayfair Theatre, also on tour and in 2013 its final performance at Wilton’s Music Hall. Also \"Women Around\" at Worthing, \"Tell me you Love me\" (a.k.a. How do you like your Wagner?) at Perth.\n\nHis play \"The 88\" was produced in 1979 at the Old Vic, taking as its subject the mutiny of an Irish Regiment in India in 1920. As is the way of things, the play had been written some ten years before in came to being produced, and been in pre-production for some considerable time, however, a few weeks before the opening night, Lord Mountbatten was murdered by the IRA. At the press conference to launch the play, two critics were heard discussing this fact and one declared, ‘How dare they put on this play so soon after dear Lord Louis’s murder. I am going to tear it to pieces.’ Which he and several others did. Devastated by such viciousness, that was unrelated to the qualities of his play, and in spite of an audience reaction that was the exact opposite to blinkered, biased, critics, Glyn Jones did not write another word for ten years. Felix Barker writing about The 88 in the Evening News said, ‘There are occasions, rare and important, when the theatre clasps hands with actuality. This happened last night…’\n\nIn 2013 he made a final witty appearance before the cameras, playing an obstreperous Film Producer in an advertisement selling the diverse beauty of Crete as a filming location: Filming In Crete from Indigo View.\n\nLate in 1964, Jones was contacted by David Whitaker, the story editor on \"Doctor Who\", with a view to the writer contributing a serial. Whitaker though, had been succeeded by Dennis Spooner by the time the scripts of \"The Space Museum\" were prepared for production. Jones was dismayed by the editing of his scripts. Spooner had cut much of the humorous content, feeling that such material was inappropriate in what he saw as a high-concept science-fiction story. This was Jones' only contribution to Doctor Who as a writer.\nHowever, he would go on to play Krans in 1975's \"The Sontaran Experiment\". This was a rare example of a \"Doctor Who\" writer also acting on the programme.\n\nHe directed at a number of theatres in the UK, at RADA and, in America at James Madison University in Virginia where he also acted in a number of productions, Dodge in \"Buried Child\", Argon in \"The Imaginary Invalid\" and Eddie Carbone in \"A View From the Bridge\", and for a summer season at The Wayside Theatre, Virginia he directed two plays, \"Tribute\" and \"The Innocents\" and acted in three, \"Barefoot in the Park\", \"Private Lives\" and \"A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum\". He performed in Neil Simon’s \"Fools\" and \"The Fantasticks\" in dinner theatre and was invited by Furman University to play Dysart in \"Equus\" and work with students on Shakespeare.\n\nHe wrote the screenplay for the Oscar Nominated Columbia Film, \"A King's Story\" on the life of the Duke of Windsor Edward VIII. He was chief writer and script editor for 20th Century Fox’s most successful children’s series, \"Here Come the Double Deckers\". He also wrote films for the Children's Film Foundation, two of which were award winners. Jones contributed a half dozen scripts for the Children's Film Foundation series The Magnificent Six and 1/2 (1968–69), plus nine scripts for \"Here Come the Double Deckers\" (1970–71), on which he was also script editor, a TV series derived from the CFF films. Jones wrote an episode of \"The Gold Robbers\" (1969) around the same time.\n\nIn the UK he had written book and lyrics for two musicals with composer Kenny Clayton, \"Cupid\" and \"Black Maria\" and his witty two hander play, \"Early One Morning\" became the musical \"Fugue in Two Flats\" with music by Paul Knight. His popular musical version of \"Peter Pan\" has music by Andy Davidson. After moving to Crete he added to his canon of book and lyrics for musicals when he wrote a musical based on the life of the infamous Spanish courtesan of La Belle Époque, \"La Belle Otero\", music by Christopher Littlewood, two opera libretti for which, at the time of his death, he was looking for a composer, and two new plays, a comedy set in Athens, \"Marry Go Round\", and \"The Muses Darling\", a play on the last few days of the life of Christopher Marlowe.\n\nIn 1997 he moved to Vamos, Crete, Greece which meant forgoing any acting or directing but he kept writing, starting with his autobiography No Official Umbrella, two novels, Angel and The Journeys We Make, a Gothic horror The Museum Mysteries & Other Short Stories, and 5 books in his comedy / thriller series featuring a quirky private eye, Thornton King, and his sidekick, Miss Holly Day. \"Dead On Time\", \"Just In Case\", \"Dead On Target\", \"The Cinelli Vases\" and \"Celluloid and Tinsel\". When Glyn died the last in the Thornton King series was with the editors and is to be published posthumously. All the foregoing novels are published by DCG Media Group. Also published, \"Doctor Who and the Space Museum\", (W.H.Allen / Virgin), also released as an audio book (BBC), \"The Double Deckers\" (Pan), a volume of children’s poetry \"Hildegarde H And Her Friends\" (Abydos Publishing). \nIn America his plays \"Red in the Morning\", \"Generations\", \"Third Drawer from the Top\", have had productions. His play \"Thriller of the Year\" first produced at the Golders Green Hippodrome in 1967 still receives numerous productions in Germany. The week before he died he was working with Beate Staufenbiel on the translation into German of two more of his plays, \"Rosemary\" and \"Hear the Hyena Laugh\" which received its posthumous premiere in January 2016. Three plays have been published by Samuel French and seven by DCG Media Group.\n\nHis autobiography, \"No Official Umbrella\", has been described as, ‘…vastly entertaining from its description of his South African boyhood to his early vigorous and experimental life in the rural theatres of England and on to the big London stage. It is full of young people with now familiar names = on the way up, all made human, not just name dropping. Anecdotes and good stories by the bundle….

It was planned, directed, published, and to a substantial degree written by Pierre Larousse, though he also relied on anonymous fellow contributors and though he died in 1875, before its completion. The publication of the \"Grand dictionnaire universel\" in 15 volumes of 1500 pages extended from 1866 to 1876. Two supplements were published in 1877 and 1890.\n\nVolumes 1-15, covering A-Z, were issued from 1866 to 1876. A supplement (Volume 16) was published in 1877, and a second supplement (Volume 17), in 1890. The Larousse firm also published further supplements in the form of a magazine called \"Revue encyclopédique\" (1891-1900) then \"Revue universelle\" (1900-1905).\n\nUnlike Émile Littré's contemporary dictionary, the \"Grand Larousse\" is primarily an encyclopedia. It is opinionated and has a distinctive and personal style.\n\nOne such instance of subjectivity appears regarding emperor Napoleon Bonaparte. For Pierre Larousse, what the Republic's general had done until the \"coup\" of 18 Brumaire was virtuous and glorious, but the \"coup\" and the subsequent rule of the consul and emperor were a tyrant's doings. Hence, the \"Grand Larousse du dix-neuvième\" had two entries: one for \"Bonaparte, Napoleon\", who, according to the article, died on the 18 Brumaire (9 November 1799); and one for \"Napoleon\" referring to the consul and emperor. Though it is true that Napoleon Bonaparte \"changed\" his name to Napoleon I, he only did so at his crowning as emperor, not after the 18 Brumaire \"coup\".\n\nThe \"Nouveau Larousse illustré\" was an illustrated encyclopedia published 1897-1904 by Éditions Larousse and edited by Claude Augé. It was essentially a scaled-down, updated and more neutral version of the \"Grand Larousse du dix-neuvième\".\n\n\n"}

Others, however, describe the effects of a totalitarian regime which, after having seized power in one country, annexes the rest of the world in order to dominate and oppress all mankind.\n\nOne major influence was Edward Bellamy's \"Looking Backward\". The best-known advocate of world government was H. G. Wells. He describes such a system in \"The Shape of Things to Come\", \"Men Like Gods\" and \"The World Set Free\".\n\nSome writers have also parodied the idea: E. M. Forster's \"The Machine Stops\" (1909) and Aldous Huxley's 1932 novel \"Brave New World\". Wells himself wrote \"The Sleeper Awakes\", an early vision of a dystopian world.\n\nWorld government themes in science fiction are particularly prominent in the years following World War II, coincident with the involvement of many scientists in the actual political movement for world government in response to the perceived dangers of nuclear holocaust. Prominent examples from the Cold War era include \"Childhood's End\" (1953), \"Starship Troopers\" (1959), \"\" (from 1966), the \"Doctor Who\" story \"The Enemy of the World\" (1968) and Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons (1968) Later references to a unified world government also appear however in post-Cold War science fiction television series such as \"Babylon 5\".\n\nThe concept also appears frequently in science fiction anime, whether in the form of a strengthened United Nations or an entirely new organizations with world presidential election. Examples of anime with this premise are \"Macross\" (adapted in America as the first part of Robotech) and \"Gundam\".\n\nPresident of Earth (also known as President of the World) is a fictional concept or character who is the leader of Planet Earth.

Most of the album was recorded following the February 1966 departure of the band's principal songwriter Gene Clark. In an attempt to compensate for Clark's absence, guitarists Jim McGuinn and David Crosby stepped into the breach and increased their songwriting output. In spite of this, the loss of Clark resulted in an uneven album that included a total of four cover versions and an instrumental. However, the album is notable for being the first by the Byrds not to include any songs written by Bob Dylan, whose material had previously been a mainstay of the band's repertoire.\n\nThe album peaked at number 24 on the \"Billboard\" Top LPs chart and reached number 27 on the UK Albums Chart. Two preceding singles, \"Eight Miles High\" and \"5D (Fifth Dimension)\", were included on the album, with the former just missing the Top 10 of the \"Billboard\" singles chart. Additionally, a third single taken from the album, \"Mr. Spaceman\", managed to reach the U.S. Top 40. Upon release, \"Fifth Dimension\" was widely regarded as the band's most experimental album to date and is today considered by critics to be influential in originating the musical genre of psychedelic rock.\n\nOn December 22, 1965, shortly after the release of their second album \"Turn! Turn! Turn!\", the Byrds entered RCA Studios in Los Angeles to record \"Eight Miles High\" and \"Why\", two new songs that they had recently composed. Both songs represented a creative leap forward for the band and were instrumental in developing the musical styles of psychedelic rock and raga rock. However, the band ran into trouble with their record company, Columbia Records, who refused to release either song because they had not been recorded at a Columbia owned studio. As a result, the band were forced to re-record both songs in their entirety at Columbia Studios, Hollywood, and it was these re-recordings that would see release on the \"Eight Miles High\" single and the \"Fifth Dimension\" album.\n\nThe re-recordings of \"Eight Miles High\" and \"Why\" were produced by Allen Stanton, Columbia's West Coast Vice President, who had recently been assigned to the band following the Byrds' decision to dispense with their previous producer, Terry Melcher. Melcher had guided the Byrds through the recording of their first two folk rock albums, which had included the international hit singles \"Mr. Tambourine Man\" and \"Turn! Turn! Turn!\", both of which had reached number 1 in the U.S. charts. However, during sessions for the \"Turn! Turn! Turn!\" album, Melcher had found himself in conflict with the band's manager, Jim Dickson, who had aspirations to produce the Byrds himself. Within a month of the band's second album being released, Dickson—with the full support of the Byrds—approached Columbia and insisted that Melcher be replaced. However, any hopes that Dickson had of being allowed to produce the band himself were dashed when the record label chose Allen Stanton as the Byrds new producer. This decision was the result of Columbia studio regulations specifying that only an in-house Columbia employee could produce records by the label's acts. Stanton would work as the Byrds' producer for the duration of the \"Fifth Dimension\" recording sessions, but would leave Columbia for A&M Records shortly after the release of the album.\n\nFollowing the re-recording of \"Eight Miles High\" in January 1966, and just prior to its release as a single in March of that year, the band's principal songwriter, Gene Clark, left the band. At the time, the official story regarding Clark's departure was that his fear of flying was preventing him from fulfilling his obligations with the group. However, it has become known in the years since then that there were other stress related factors at work, as well as resentment within the band that his songwriting income had made him the wealthiest member of the Byrds. While the song \"Eight Miles High\" still featured the full participation of Clark, the remaining ten tracks on the \"Fifth Dimension\" album were recorded after he had left the band.\n\nArguably the most famous song on the album is the hit single \"Eight Miles High\", an early excursion into psychedelic rock. Musically, the song was a fusion of John Coltrane-influenced guitar playing—courtesy of lead guitarist Jim McGuinn—and raga-based musical structure and vocals, inspired by the Indian classical music of Ravi Shankar. Written mostly by Clark in November 1965, while the Byrds were on tour in the U.S., the song was pivotal in transmuting folk rock into the new musical forms of psychedelia and raga rock. Regardless of its innovative qualities, however, many radio stations in the U.S. banned the record, believing the title to be a reference to recreational drug use. Although the song's lyrics actually pertained to the approximate cruising altitude of commercial airliners, and the group's first visit to London during their 1965 English tour, both Clark and rhythm guitarist David Crosby later admitted that the song was at least partly inspired by their own drug use.\n\nThe album also included the McGuinn-penned songs \"5D (Fifth Dimension)\" and \"Mr. Spaceman\", with the latter being an early foray into country rock and a semi-serious meditation on the existence of alien life. In spite of its tongue-in-cheek lyrics, both McGuinn and Crosby were serious about the possibility of communicating with extraterrestrial lifeforms via the medium of radio broadcast. McGuinn in particular felt that if the song was played on radio there was a possibility that extraterrestrials might intercept the broadcasts and make contact. However, in later years McGuinn realized that this would've been impossible since AM radio waves disperse too rapidly in space.\n\n\"5D (Fifth Dimension)\", on the other hand, was an abstract attempt to explain Einstein's theory of relativity, which was misconstrued by many as being a song about an LSD trip. In particular, \"Variety\" magazine targeted \"5D (Fifth Dimension)\" shortly after its release as a single, claiming that it was one of a recent spate of pop songs to include veiled drug references in its lyrics. This resulted in some radio stations in America refusing to play the song. The organ arrangement on \"5D (Fifth Dimension)\" was played by Van Dyke Parks.\n\nMcGuinn also penned the album's closing track, \"2-4-2 Fox Trot (The Lear Jet Song)\", which was an attempt to create an aural approximation of a flight in a Lear Jet. The song was inspired by the band's friendship with jet manufacturer John Lear and the title is a reference to the registration number of Lear's own personal jet, which was N242FT. The song makes extensive use of aviation sound effects, including an in-cockpit recitation of a pilot's pre-takeoff checklist and the sound of a jet engine starting up. While the song can be regarded as another of the Byrds' quirky album closers, like \"Oh! Susannah\" and \"We'll Meet Again\" from their previous albums, Crosby and McGuinn actually took the song very seriously, arguing that it was an innovative attempt at incorporating mechanical sounds into a pop song format.\n\nOne of Crosby's songwriting contributions to the album, \"What's Happening?!?!\", began his penchant for writing abstract songs asking irresoluble questions—a trend that has continued throughout his career with Crosby, Stills & Nash and as a solo artist. During a 1966 interview, Crosby admitted that it was a strange song, noting, \"It asks questions of what's going on here and who does it all belong to and why is it all going on. I just ask the questions because I really don't know the answers.\" Like \"Eight Miles High\", the song exhibits the strong influence of Indian classical music, with its droning guitar and melody. \"What's Happening?!?!\" is also notable for being the first song written solely by Crosby to appear on a Byrds' record.\n\nCrosby and McGuinn also collaborated on the jazzy \"I See You\", which represented another example of abstract lyrics coupled with raga-influenced, psychedelic guitar solos. Author Johnny Rogan has commented that \"I See You\" was indicative of the Byrds' move away from the darkly-romantic songs of Clark towards material that examined psychological states. The album also includes the instrumental \"Captain Soul\", a song credited to all four band members that grew out of an in-studio jam of Lee Dorsey's \"Get Out of My Life, Woman\", and which features Clark playing harmonica.\n\nThe cover versions on \"Fifth Dimension\" include the Billy Roberts' song \"Hey Joe (Where You Gonna Go)\", which would enjoy a brief vogue during 1966, with notable versions of the song being recorded by Love, the Leaves, and the Jimi Hendrix Experience. The song was introduced to the Byrds by Crosby, who also sang lead vocals on their recording of it. Crosby, along with his friend Dino Valenti, had been instrumental in popularizing the song within the larger Los Angeles music community. Consequently, the guitarist had been wanting to record the song with the Byrds almost since the band had first formed in 1964, but the other members of the group had been unenthusiastic. During 1966, several other L.A. based bands enjoyed success with \"Hey Joe\", leaving Crosby angered by his bandmates' lack of faith in the song. Finally the other members of the Byrds acquiesced and allowed Crosby the chance to record the song during sessions for \"Fifth Dimension\".\n\nAnother cover version on the album, \"I Come and Stand at Every Door\", has been called the most macabre song in the Byrds' oeuvre by biographer Johnny Rogan. The song's lyrics, which were adapted from a poem by Nâzım Hikmet, recount the story of a seven-year-old child who was killed in the atomic bombing of Hiroshima. The song describes how the child's spirit now walks the earth in search of peace in the nuclear age.\n\nThe two traditional folk songs included on the album, \"John Riley\" and \"Wild Mountain Thyme\", were both introduced to the band by McGuinn, who had learned them via recordings made by Joan Baez and Pete Seeger respectively. Writing for the AllMusic website, critic Richie Unterberger regarded both \"John Riley\" and \"Wild Mountain Thyme\" as \"immaculate folk rock\", praising the arrangements.\n\n\"Fifth Dimension\" was released on July 18, 1966 in the United States (catalogue item CL 2549 in mono, CS 9349 in stereo) and September 22, 1966 in the UK (catalogue item BPG 62783 in mono, SBPG 62783 in stereo). It peaked at number 24 on the \"Billboard\" Top LPs chart, during a chart stay of 28 weeks, and reached number 27 in the United Kingdom. The album's front cover featured a photograph taken by the graphic design company Horn/Griner and also featured the first appearance of the Byrds' colorful psychedelic mosaic logo.\n\nThe preceding \"Eight Miles High\" single was released on March 14, 1966 in the U.S., and April 29, 1966 in the UK, reaching number 14 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and number 24 on the UK Singles Chart. A second single, \"5D (Fifth Dimension)\", was released on June 13, 1966 in America and July 29, 1966 in the UK, peaking at number 44 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, but failing to chart in the UK. A third single taken from the album, \"Mr. Spaceman\", was issued on September 6, 1966 and reached number 36 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, but it too failed to chart in the UK.\n\nUpon its release, contemporary critical reaction to \"Fifth Dimension\" was somewhat tepid, although \"Hit Parader\" described it as \"the third and best album from the Byrds\". The \"Hit Parader\" review also made reference to the recent controversy surrounding the album's two preceding singles by suggesting, \"If your friendly neighborhood radio station banned 'Eight Miles High' and '5D' you can listen to them here and discover that there's nothing suggestive about them. The only danger in this album is that it might addict you to groovy music.\"\n\nJournalist Jon Landau, writing in \"Crawdaddy!\", was less complimentary about the album and cited the departure of Gene Clark as a contributing factor in its artistic failure. Landau concluded by saying that the album \"cannot be considered up to the standards set by the Byrds' first two and basically demonstrates that they should be thinking in terms of replacing Gene Clark instead of just trying to carry on without him.\" In the UK, \"Disc\" magazine was also critical, bemoaning a lack of energy in the album's contents and commenting: \"Here then are those Byrds with the fresh eager exciting music sounding like tired and disillusioned old men looking back on the happy days. This is a sad sound indeed.\"\n\nIn more recent years, Richie Unterberger, writing for the AllMusic website, has described \"Fifth Dimension\" as \"wildly uneven\", noting that the album's short-comings prevent it \"from attaining truly classic status\". Despite its inconsistency, \"Fifth Dimension\" is today regarded as a highly influential, albeit transitional, album that is musically more experimental than the band's previous recorded output. A reviewer for \"Entertainment Weekly\" wrote in 1996 that \"time hasn't enhanced the group's forays into psychedelia\", yet the album contains \"enough keepers to make you forgive their occasional tendency to fly into walls\". That same year, the \"NME\" described it as \"faultless\" and a work that \"heralds a newly psychedelic Byrds hung up on the archetypal acid-fixation with the unknown\". \n\nBarney Hoskyns of \"Mojo\" magazine was less impressed and deemed \"Fifth Dimension\" to be a \"breakthrough\" work, but also one that \"can't quite decide what sort of album it is\". Hoskins elaborated: \"Torn between the past and the future, it picks randomly from a smorgasbord of country rock ('Mr. Spaceman'), garage punk ('Hey Joe'), instrumental R&B ('Captain Soul'), folk standards ('Wild Mountain Thyme', the lovely 'John Riley'), and rallying calls to the emerging hippy youth ('What's Happening?!?!'). 'Patchy' isn't close to describing it.\" In 2004, \"Rolling Stone\" called it \"the Byrds' most underrated album\" and especially admired \"Eight Miles High\" as \"the band's highest of highs, blending Coltrane-influenced 12-string squiggles with eerie harmonies for a truly hypnotic sound\".\n\nAuthor Christopher Hjort has commented that \"Fifth Dimension\" can be seen as a testament to the rapidity with which pop music was evolving during the mid-1960s. Like its predecessor, \"Turn! Turn! Turn!\", the album was made under trying circumstances, with the band scrambling to compensate for the loss of their main songwriter in the wake of Clark's departure. This resulted in an uneven album that included a total of four cover versions and an instrumental. However, \"Fifth Dimension\" actually contained fewer covers than either of their Clark-era albums, as well as an absence of songs by Bob Dylan, whose material, along with Clark's, had dominated earlier Byrds releases.\n\nIn his 2003 book \"Eight Miles High: Folk-Rock's Flight from Haight-Ashbury to Woodstock\", Unterberger regards the album as a pivotal moment in establishing the Byrds' status within the emerging counterculture. The author goes on to say that the album is a continuation of their folk rock sound, but clearly establishes the break away from \"folk-rock into folk-rock-psychedelia\". He also notes the album's influence on the Byrds' contemporaries.\n\nThe album was included in Robert Dimery's book \"1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die\". It was voted number 290 in Colin Larkin's All Time Top 1000 Albums 3rd Edition (2000). \n\n\"Fifth Dimension\" was remastered at 20-bit resolution and partially remixed as part of the Columbia/Legacy Byrds series. It was reissued in an expanded form on April 30, 1996, with six bonus tracks, including the RCA versions of \"Why\" and \"Eight Miles High\". The final track on the CD extends to include a hidden promotional radio interview with McGuinn and Crosby, dating from 1966. The interview is open-ended and formatted with gaps between the group's answers, whereby a disc jockey could insert himself asking scripted questions, giving the illusion that the Byrds were being interviewed in person.\n\nOn April 26, 2005, Sundazed Records issued a compilation of outtakes from the \"Fifth Dimension\" recording sessions, titled \"Another Dimension\".\n\nSide one\n\nSide two\n1996 CD reissue bonus tracks\n\nNotes\n\n\nAdapted from \"So You Want To Be A Rock 'n' Roll Star: The Byrds Day-By-Day (1965-1973)\" and the compact disc liner notes.\n\nCredits include bonus tracks on CD and digital releases of the album.\n\nThe Byrds\n\nAdditional personnel\n\n\"Fifth Dimension\" was one of four Byrds albums that were remixed as part of their re-release on Columbia/Legacy. However, unlike \"Mr. Tambourine Man\" and \"Turn! Turn! Turn!\", which were remixed extensively, only a third of \"Fifth Dimension\" was remixed, although it is unknown exactly which tracks received this treatment. The reason for these remixes was explained by Bob Irwin (who produced these re-issues for compact disc) during an interview:\n\nHe further stated:\n\nMany fans enjoy the partially remixed album because it is very close to the original mix in most cases and offers noticeably better sound quality. However, there are also a lot of fans who dismiss the remix as revisionist history and prefer to listen to the original mix on vinyl or on the pre-1996 CD releases.\n\nBibliography\n\n"}

There is also a Brick Testament book series.\n\nThroughout stories are retold using passages from the Bible, with chapter and verse cited, the wording being a free adaptation that Spurling says is based on a number of public domain Bible translations. Occasionally, mostly when images are being used to contrast with the underlying scripture, Spurling dramatises the images with additional text. Such text is displayed in gray instead of the usual black.\n\nSpurling's own commentary occasionally appears in illustrations and is displayed in gray text, and also as original titles for the stories themselves.\nA \"Rolling Stone\" article that is included as a link in the Brick Testament web site suggests that Spurling is an atheist. In 2015 Spurling announced on Facebook that she was an atheist, a transgender woman, and a lesbian, and had legally changed her name to Elbe Spurling but would likely retain her birth name, Brendan Powell Smith, for her books. Her author page at Amazon.com is listed under \"Brendan Powell Smith.\"\n\nThe dioramas seen in The Brick Testament are created from Spurling's personal Lego collection. The pieces come from hundreds of Lego sets dating from the 1960s to the present.\n\nIn the few instances where alterations are made to Lego elements, they are generally simple changes made with a hobby knife or permanent ink marker. An example alteration is God's hair: Spurling made God's white hair by carving a white helmet piece (found on Peeron). The only completely non-Lego part of Spurling's scenes is the background sky.\n\nAll of Spurling's images are digital. Spurling photographed early scenes with a Nikon Coolpix 950. She now uses a Nikon Coolpix 4500. After photographing the scenes, she adds speech balloons and sometimes makes alterations using image editing software.\n\nThe Brick Testament website began in October 2001. It originally featured six stories from the Book of Genesis. The site now contains over 400 illustrated stories, from both the Old and New Testaments, and over 4,500 images. It had an Alexa traffic rank of 53,191 in April 2007. Each story is tagged if it contains nudity, sexual content, violence and/or cursing.\nThe website has had over two million visitors.\n\nSeveral hardcover Brick Testament books have been published, \"The Brick Testament: Stories from the Book of Genesis\", \"The Brick Testament: The Story of Christmas\", \"The Brick Testament: The Ten Commandments\"., and \"The Brick Bible: A New Spin on the Old Testament\". The US retailer Sam's Club withdrew \"The Brick Bible\" from sale in November 2011, \"due to the complaints of a handful of people that it is vulgar and violent\".\n\nIn a Facebook post made on April 3, 2015, Spurling announced a new project entitled the Brick Book of Mormon. The stated goal of the project is \"to make these teachings better known to the world. It is designed to capture the interest of non-Mormons curious to know what the LDS Church teaches, as well as believing Mormons looking for a fun new way to learn and share the history and teachings of their church. This project is currently in the RESEARCH PHASE in which I have been spending many months immersing myself in the scriptures and teaching manuals of the LDS Church and taking hundreds and hundreds of pages of notes. In the next phase, all these notes will be worked into a manuscript. From there the illustration phase will begin. It is not yet determined whether The Brick Book of Mormon will first be published as a book (like The Brick Chronicle series) or whether it will publish first to the web and then go to print (like The Brick Bible).\" The project was officially launched on February 6, 2017.\n\n\n"}

The virus only affects chickens. CAV is a non-enveloped icosahedral single stranded DNA virus, which causes bone marrow atrophy, anemia, and severe immunosuppression. Clinical signs of CAV infection are predominantly found in young chicks due to vertical transmission from the breeder hens whose maternal antibodies have not yet formed following exposure. Clinical disease is rare today because of the widespread practice of vaccinating breeders, but the subclinical form of the disease—which normally affects birds more than two weeks of age following horizontal transmission of the virus via the fecal-oral route—is ubiquitous. The virus is very resistant in the environment, making elimination very difficult.\n\nThe disease and virus have many names including chicken anemia, blue wing disease, anemia dermatitis syndrome, chicken/avian infectious anemia, hemorrhagic aplastic anemia syndrome, infectious chicken anemia, chicken infectious anemia virus, and chicken anemia agent. When this virus was first discovered in 1979, it was named \"chicken anemia agent\".\n\nClinical signs only occur in chicks less than three weeks of age. During outbreaks of CAV, up to 10% of chicks can die. Signs include a pale comb, wattle, eyelids, legs and carcass, anorexia, weakness, stunting, unthriftiness, weight loss, cyanosis, petechiation and ecchymoses, lethargy, and sudden death. Neurological signs include dullness, depression and paresis.\n\nIn older chickens, an infection with no apparent symptoms may cause reduced growth rates due to a poor feed conversion ratio.\n\nCAV infects precursor T cells in the thymus and hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow, causing destruction of these cells via apoptosis.\nThis reduces the production of red blood cells (RBC) and white blood cells (WBC), leading to severe immunosuppression and anemia.\n\nA presumptive diagnosis can be made based on the clinical signs and a low hematocrit reading, e.g. below 27%. Virus isolation, increased antibody titres, immunoperoxidase staining, ELISA, PCR or indirect immunofluorescence can be used to confirm the presence of the virus. Post mortem findings show significant atrophy of the lymphoid organs, hemorrhage throughout the tissues, and pale watery bone marrow.\n\nThere is no specific treatment for infected birds. Culling of infected birds is normally performed in infected commercial flocks. Birds that have been infected develop immunity to the virus.\n\nVertical spread of the disease can be controlled by the vaccination of breeding hens with both live attenuated and wild vaccines. These vaccines reduce the vertical transmission rate. The vaccine has the ATCvet code . Appropriate hygiene and biosecurity measures may be employed to control the disease.\n\n\n2.

There are currently fourteen species in this genus including the type species Fowl aviadenovirus A. Viruses in this genus cause specific disease syndromes such as Quail Bronchitis (QB), Egg Drop Syndrome (EDS), Haemorrhagic Enteritis (HE), Pheasant Marble Spleen Disease (MSD), Falcon adenovirus A and Inclusion Body Hepatitis (IBH). Avian adenoviruses have a worldwide distribution and it is common to find multiple species on a single farm. The most common serogroups are serogroup 1, 2 and 3.\n\nNo evidence of transmission from birds to humans has been identified. The virus is mainly spread horizontally by the oro-fecal route, but vertical transmission can occur in serogroup 1. Once it has infected the bird the virus may remain latent until a period of stress, when it may then cause clinical disease.\n\nInfections are normally subclinical, however clinical disease can occur—especially in young birds as maternal antibody levels begin to wane.\n\nClinical signs are related to the organ affected.\n\nSigns of gastrointestinal disease (Haemorrhagic Enteritis) include diarrhea, anorexia, melena and hematochezia. Anaemia and dehydration may develop secondary to this haemorrhagic enteritis. Signs of reproductive disease (Egg Drop Syndrome) include low egg production/hatching and the laying of abnormal eggs (size, shape, colour, texture). Adenovirus infection may infect other organs, causing a splenitis, inclusion body hepatitis, bronchitis, pulmonary congestion ventriculitis, pancreatitis, or oedema, depending on the species of bird infected.\n\nDiagnosis of aviadenovirus is by histopathology, electron microscopy, viral isolation, ELISA and PCR. In addition, virus antigen can be detected double immunodiffusion. Postmortem examination may reveal a variety of clinical signs relating directly to the organ affected. Specifically, Egg Drop Syndrome can be diagnosed by hemagglutinin inhibition and the virus causes haemagglutination in chickens and ducks.\n\nVaccines for HE and EDS are available (ATCvet codes: for the inactivated vaccine, for the live vaccine, plus various combinations). Disease incidence may be reduced by minimising stress levels, using appropriate hygiene measures and providing adequate nutrition.\n\nThe following species are recognized:\n\nViruses in Aviadenovirus are non-enveloped, with icosahedral geometries, and T=25 symmetry. The diameter is around 90 nm. Genomes are linear and non-segmented, around 35–36kb in length and have a guanine/cytosine content of 53–59%. The genome codes for 40 proteins. \n\nViral replication is nuclear. Entry into the host cell is achieved by attachment of the viral fiber glycoproteins to host receptors, which mediates endocytosis. Replication follows the DNA strand displacement model. DNA-templated transcription, with some alternative splicing mechanism is the method of transcription. The virus exits the host cell by nuclear envelope breakdown, viroporins, and lysis.\nBirds serve as the natural host.\n\n\n"}

The table was purportedly made to serve as a means of communicating with the spirits; the alphabet would be slowly spoken aloud and the table would tilt at the appropriate letter, thus spelling out words and sentences. The process is similar to that of a Ouija board. Scientists and skeptics consider table-turning to be the result of the ideomotor effect, or conscious trickery.\n\nWhen the movement of Modern Spiritualism first reached Europe from America in the winter of 1852–1853, the most popular method of consulting the spirits was for several persons to sit round a table, with their hands resting on it, and wait for the table to move. If the experiment was successful the table would rotate with considerable rapidity, and would occasionally rise in the air, or perform other movements.\n\nWhilst most spiritualists ascribed the table movements to the agency of spirits, two investigators, Count de Gasparin and Professor Thury of Geneva conducted a careful series of experiments by which they claimed to have demonstrated that the movements of the table were due to a physical force emanating from the bodies of the sitters, for which they proposed the name ectenic force. Their conclusion rested on the supposed elimination of all known physical causes for the movements; but it is doubtful from the description of the experiments whether the precautions taken were sufficient to exclude unconscious muscular action (the ideomotor effect) or even deliberate fraud.\n\nIn England table-turning became a fashionable diversion and was practised all over the country in the year 1853. John Elliotson and his followers attributed the phenomena to mesmerism. The general public were content to find the explanation of the movements in spirits, animal magnetism, Odic force, galvanism, electricity, or even the rotation of the earth. Some Evangelical clergymen alleged that the spirits who caused the movements were of a diabolic nature. In France, Allan Kardec studied the phenomenon and concluded in \"The Book on Mediums\" that some messages were caused by an outside intelligence as the message contained information that was not known to the group.\n\nThe Scottish surgeon James Braid, the English physiologist W. B. Carpenter and others pointed out, that the phenomena could depend upon the expectation of the sitters, and could be stopped altogether by appropriate suggestion.\nEnglish physicist Michael Faraday devised some simple apparatus which conclusively demonstrated that the movements he investigated were due to unconscious muscular action. The apparatus consisted of two small boards, with glass rollers between them, the whole fastened together by india-rubber bands in such a manner that the upper board could slide under lateral pressure to a limited extent over the lower one. The occurrence of such lateral movement was at once indicated by means of an upright haystalk fastened to the apparatus. When by this means it was made clear to the experimenters that it was the fingers which moved the table, the phenomena generally ceased. Faraday's work was followed up a century later by clinical psychologist Kenneth Batcheldor who pioneered the use of infra-red video recording to observe experimental subjects in complete darkness.\n\nProfessional magicians and skeptics have exposed many of the methods utilized by mediums to tip tables. The magician Chung Ling Soo described a method that involved a pin driven into the table and the use of a ring with a slot on the medium's finger. Once the pin entered the slot, the table could be lifted.\n\nAccording to John Mulholland:\n\nThe multiplicity of methods used to tip and raise tables in a séance is almost as great as the number of mediums performing the feat. One of the simplest was to slide the hands back until one or both of the medium's thumbs could catch hold of the table top. Another way was to exert no pressure on the table at all, and in the event that the sitter opposite the medium did press on the table, to permit the table to tip far enough away from him so that he could get the toe of one foot under the table leg. He would then immediately put pressure on his side, and, holding the table between his hands and his toe, move it about at will. By this method a small table can be made to float two feet off the floor... Another method was to catch the under side of the table top with the knee; and still another was merely to kick the table into the air.\n\n\n"}

In 1999, the dot-com venture Excite@Home bought bluemountain.com in a deal valued at $780 million.

The decomposition temperature of a substance is the temperature at which the substance chemically decomposes. \nThe reaction is usually endothermic as heat is required to break chemical bonds in the compound undergoing decomposition. If decomposition is sufficiently exothermic, a positive feedback loop is created producing thermal runaway and possibly an explosion or other chemical reactions.\n\n\n\n\nWhen metals are near the bottom of the reactivity series, their compounds generally decompose easily at high temperatures. This is because stronger bonds form between atoms towards the top of the reactivity series, and strong bonds break less easily. For example, copper is near the bottom of the reactivity series, and copper sulfate (CuSO), begins to decompose at about 200 °C, increasing rapidly at higher temperatures to about 560 °C. In contrast potassium is near the top of the reactivity series, and potassium sulfate (KSO) does not decompose at its melting point of about 1069 °C, nor even at its boiling point.\n\n"}

It inhabits the lumen of cecum and parenchyma of liver, where it causes extensive necrosis. It is transmitted by another cecal parasite, the nematode \"Heterakis gallinarum\".\n\n\"H. meleagridis\" is a microscopic, pleomorphic protozoan, and can exist in two forms, amoeboid and flagellated. Within the tissue, it is present as an amoeboid protozoan, while in the lumen or free in the contents of cecum, it lives as an elongated flagellated form. The amoeboid form is typically 8-15 μm in diameter, whereas the flagellated form can reach up to 30 μm in diameter. \nHistomonads do not possess mitochondria, but instead produce energy inside hydrogenosomes.\nThe flagellum shows the common 9x2+2 type.\n\n\"H. meleagridis\" reproduces by binary fission. The free trophozoites are very delicate and can survive only for a few hours in the external environment. However, when they are transmitted between flocks in the eggs of \"Heterakis gallinarum\", a cecal nematode, which in turn can be transmitted by earthworms that ingested the nematode eggs, they gain entry into the nematode eggs. The eggs with the trophozoites are passed out into the environment through the feces. In this way, the trophozoites can remain viable up to two years in the external environment. Within turkey flocks \"H. meleagridis\" is also known to be directly transmitted from bird to bird. Histomonads, either released from the heterakid nematode larvae in the ceca or after direct infection via the cloaca, and replicate rapidly in the cecal tissues. They migrate to the submucosa and muscularis mucosae and cause severe necrosis. The parasites then move to the liver through the vascular system. There, they cause typical crater-like necrotic lesions. Mortality in turkey flocks can be very high (80-100%).\n\n\"H. meleagridis\" is the causal organism of histomoniasis of gallinaceous birds. It induces extensive and severe necrosis of the tissues of the mucosa and submucosa of cecum and parenchyma of the liver. The lesions are sometimes exacerbated by other pathogens such as \"Escherichia coli\" and coccidia. The symptoms appear within seven to 12 days after infection, and include depression, reduced appetite, poor growth, increased thirst, sulphur-yellow diarrhoea, listlessness, drooping wings, and unkempt feathers. The symptoms are highly fatal to turkeys, but effect less damage in chickens. However, outbreaks in chickens may result in high morbidity, moderate mortality, and extensive culling, leading to overall poor flock performance. Concurrence of \"Salmonella typhmurium\" and \"E. coli\" was found to cause high mortality in broiler chickens. Young birds, particularly those three to 12 weeks old, are most susceptible. Generally, the symptoms are profound in turkeys, while chickens are usually asymptomatic.\n\nDiagnosis can be easily performed by necropsy of the fresh or preserved carcass, particularly on the liver. Recently paromomycin has been approved by the Italian authorities for treatment (Paromomicina 200mg/g Huvepharma). However good management of the farm and sanitation are the essential effective strategies to control the spread of infection.\n\n"}

{"id": "2202331", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2202331", "title": "Kiss (Kiss album)", "text": "Kiss (Kiss album)\n\nKiss is the debut studio album by American rock band Kiss, released on February 18, 1974. Much of the material on the album was written by Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley, as members of their pre-Kiss band Wicked Lester. Simmons estimated that the entire process of recording and mixing took three weeks, while co-producer Richie Wise has stated it took just 13 days.\n\nThe album was recorded at Bell Sound Studios in New York City, which was owned by the company that owned Buddah Records. Neil Bogart, founder of Casablanca Records, was an executive at Buddah prior to forming Casablanca. Casablanca Records held a party at the Century Plaza Hotel in Los Angeles to celebrate the West Coast release of \"Kiss\" (February 8) and to introduce the record company to the press and other record industry executives.\n\nIn keeping with the Casablanca theme, the party included palm trees and a Humphrey Bogart lookalike. Kiss performed their usual loud and bombastic stage show, which turned Warner Bros. Records (Casablanca's record distributor) against the group. Soon after the show, Warner Bros. contacted Neil Bogart and threatened to end their deal with Casablanca if Kiss did not remove their makeup. With manager Bill Aucoin's backing, Kiss refused. Shortly after the release of \"Kiss\", Warner Bros. released Casablanca from their contract.\n\nKiss began their first album tour with a performance at the Northern Alberta Jubilee Auditorium in Edmonton, Alberta on February 5, 1974. A few weeks later, they made their first national TV appearance on ABC's \"In Concert\", followed by a performance of \"Firehouse\" on \"The Mike Douglas Show\". During the interview portion of the show, Gene Simmons declared himself to be \"evil incarnate\", eliciting nervousness, confused reactions from the studio audience, to which comedian Totie Fields humorously commented, \"Wouldn't it be funny if he's just a nice Jewish boy underneath the makeup?\" Although neither confirming or denying his Jewish heritage, Simmons replied, \"You should only know\", to which, Fields countered, \"I do. You can't hide the hook\", referring to Simmons' nose.\n\nThe album's cover showed the group positioned against a black background in a pose visually reminiscent of the Beatles' \"With the Beatles\" album (Peter Criss stated that this was the visual effect the band was looking for). Gene Simmons has since stated that \"Meet The Beatles\" was a big inspiration to him. Three of the four band members applied their own makeup for the album cover photo, as they usually did, but Criss' \"Catman\" makeup was applied by a professional, whose work came out looking quite a bit different from the look Criss had established, and to which he would return immediately afterward. Ace Frehley, wanting to impress the other members of Kiss, dyed his hair with silver hairspray, which easily came out with shampoo. According to Criss, photographer Joel Brodsky thought Kiss were literally clowns, and wanted to place balloons behind the group for the shoot. Brodsky denied this, chalking it up to imagination. As this was also the first album for the group, they still had yet to perfect the look they would come to be known for later on. For example, Simmons' \"Demon\" makeup, while noticeable as his, appears rough and not in the definitive form he later became known for.\n\nWith the exception of \"Kissin' Time\", all of the material for \"Kiss\" was written before the band entered the studio. Some of the songs were written during Wicked Lester's brief existence, while \"Firehouse\" was written by Paul Stanley while he was attending the High School of Music & Art in New York City.\n\n\"Strutter\", which opens the album with a drum fill, is an uptempo rock song that was written before Frehley joined Kiss. Stanley wrote the lyrics, and the music was based on a song Simmons had written years before, \"Stanley the Parrot\", which he had recorded with former Wicked Lester member Brooke Ostrander in a New Jersey apartment. \"Strutter\" remains one of the few Kiss songs where Stanley and Simmons share songwriting credits, and was a standard number at Kiss concerts throughout the 1970s. It was released in August 1974 as the third and final single from the album.\n\n\"Nothin' to Lose\" became the band's first single; it was written by Simmons. Vocals were performed by Simmons and Peter Criss. It chronicles the singer coercing his girlfriend into trying anal sex, and her subsequent enjoyment of it. The B-side was \"Love Theme from KISS\", the album's instrumental.\n\nThe North Carolina glam metal band FireHouse takes its name from the song \"Firehouse\". The song is well known for Simmons fire breathing during live concerts.\n\nThis was the first song composed for Kiss by Frehley. Insecure in his own singing ability, Frehley turned over the vocals for the album to Simmons. \"Cold Gin\" was a concert staple throughout the 1970s. During the Alive/Worldwide Tour, Frehley assisted on lead vocals.\n\nThe song refers to the stimulating effect that cold gin supposedly has on the male sex drive. The song credits cold gin as the only thing that keeps the couple together in a troubled relationship.\n\nThere was a Kiss tribute band from Los Angeles named after this classic song, featuring Tommy Thayer as Frehley, Jaime St. James as Criss, Chris McLernon as Simmons and Anthony White as Stanley. St. James and Thayer previously played in Black 'N Blue, a band produced by Simmons, and Thayer would eventually join Kiss, taking Frehley's place after the Farewell tour.\n\n\"Cold Gin\" was covered by the alternative metal group Disturbed at a one-off tribute show to Pantera guitarist \"Dimebag\" Darrell Abbott, as it was known to be the guitarist's favorite song. That live performance featured members of Drowning Pool and Anthrax, David Draiman on vocals and Vinnie Paul on drums.\n\nPantera and Skid Row performed the song together live while the bands were on tour together in 1992, with Ace Frehley on guitar as a special guest. The performance was taped and included on Pantera's 2000 home video, \"3 Vulgar Videos from Hell\". Death Angel covered the song on their 1988 album \"Frolic Through the Park\".\n\nFrehley noted: \"I wrote 'Cold Gin' in a New York subway, in my head, both lyrics and music. I had a spiral notebook with me. I never took a guitar lesson, nobody believes that. I didn't realize it was gonna become a Kiss classic\".\n\nA live version of the song was included on Kiss' popular and successful live album \"Alive!\". When \"Alive!\" was re-released as part of the \"Kiss Alive! 1975–2000\" box set, the song was mistakenly credited to Stanley instead of Ace Frehley in the 72-page booklet that accompanied the album.\n\nWeezer vocalist and guitarist Rivers Cuomo has said that this was the first song he ever learned to play on guitar.\n\n\"Cold Gin\" was named the seventh-best drinking song of all time.\n\nAce Frehley later rerecorded \"Cold Gin\" with his own vocals for his cover album, \"Origins, Vol. 1\".\n\n\"Let Me Know\" (previously titled \"Sunday Driver\") was the song Stanley played when he was first introduced to Simmons, and it was later recorded by Wicked Lester. Simmons and Stanley shared lead vocal duties on the song, which was given a bridge and instrumental coda when recorded for \"Kiss\". During later Kiss concerts, this coda was moved to the end of \"She\" and before that, \"Watchin' You\".\n\n\"Kissin' Time\" was not included on the original album; in fact it was not recorded until two months after the album's February release. By April, the album was clearly not the commercial success the band and Casablanca Records founder Bogart were hoping for. Bogart (who knew that a catchy single could save the album) ordered Kiss back into the studio to record \"Kissin' Time\", which was a Top 20 hit for Bobby Rydell in 1959. It was released as a single on May 10, but never reached any higher than No. 83. It did, however, boost sales of the album, even though it was not added to the track listing until the album was reissued in July 1974 (against the band's wishes).\n\nSimmons has stated that he does not know the meaning of the song's lyrics. \"Deuce\" has been a staple of the band's concerts, opening their shows from 1973–1976 and again for their 1996 reunion.\n\nThis instrumental evolved from a song titled \"Acrobat\", played during the band's 1973 club shows. It can be found on their 2001 box set. The song is shortened for the album. It is the only Kiss song to feature songwriting credits for all four original members. \"Love Theme from Kiss\" appeared in the 2010 movie \"Somewhere\", directed by Sofia Coppola.\n\n\"100,000 Years\" begins with a bass riff by Simmons. The live version includes a long drum solo by Criss continuing on from the short one found on the album, as heard on \"Alive!\" The demo version can be heard on the 2001 release of the Kiss box set. There was a lost verse towards the end of the song which never made the final cut.\n\n\"Black Diamond\" begins with Stanley singing the intro accompanied by a twelve-string acoustic guitar. After he yells out \"hit it!\", the full band kicks in and Criss assumes lead vocal duties for the two verses. After the chorus, the song slows down for Frehley's guitar solo, after which it gradually slows down further and fades out after a series of distorted chords. After Criss' departure from the band, the vocal duties have fallen to subsequent drummers Eric Carr and Eric Singer.\n\nIn the mid-late 1980s, the album was reissued by Mercury Records on vinyl and cassette with a live version of \"Nothin' to Lose\" in place of the studio version. The studio version was restored when the album was issued on CD, and on the 2014 vinyl re-issue.\n\nDespite the band's promoting and touring, \"Kiss\" sold approximately 75,000 copies after its initial release without the presence of a hit single. It was certified gold on June 8, 1977, having shipped 500,000 copies. The album was re-released in 1997 (along with most of Kiss' earlier albums) in a remastered version.\n\nIn 2003, \"Kiss\" was included in the \"Spin\" list of essential glam rock albums.\n\nGene Simmons has said that \"Kiss\" is his favorite Kiss album.\n\n\n\n"}

It features the first appearance in Gibson's fiction of \"the Bridge\", which Gibson revisited as the setting of his acclaimed Bridge trilogy of novels. In the story, the Bridge is overrun by squatters, among them Skinner, who occupies a shack atop a bridgetower. An altered version of the story was published in \"Omni\" magazine and subsequently anthologized. \"Skinner's Room\" was nominated for the 1992 Locus Award for Best Short Story.\n\nThe story takes place in a near-future where the United States is in decline, having been negatively affected by some event referred to as the \"devaluations.\" It is set in a decaying San Francisco in which the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge is closed and taken over by the homeless. The wealthy denizens of the city have retreated to gated-access enclaves. The room mentioned in the title is a shack built on top one of the bridge's towers. Skinner has lived on the bridge, and in his room, for a long time, and is accompanied by a girl with an interest in the history of the bridge town and who arrived only three months before.\n\nThe story reveals that, long ago, the Bridge had been closed to vehicle traffic (for three years) and that the pressure to find somewhere to live had forced homeless people to seize the bridge and set up a squatters' town there. The community that arose was vibrant and was watched by the world's media. The town grew in a piecemeal fashion, built from salvaged parts as well as from material apparently donated by more wealthy nations. At the end of the story Skinner has a dream in which he remembers being at the front of the crowd who seized the bridge (Skinner is the first onto the bridge) and scaled the towers.\n\n\"Skinner's Room\" was commissioned by the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art for its exhibition \"Visionary San Francisco\", shown from June 14 to August 26, 1990. Gibson's story inspired a contribution to the exhibition by architects Ming Fung and Craig Hodgetts. Ming and Hodgetts designed the urban environment which would have catalysed the transformation of the Bridge. They envisioned a San Francisco in which the rich live in high-tech, self-sufficient, self-contained towers, above the decrepit city and its crumbling bridge, isolated from the amorphous city. The crate-packaged installation, which was surrounded by scrap metal, computer chips, and pages from \"manga\" comic strips, featured a model of the towers, along with Gibson on a monitor discussing the future and reading from \"Skinner's Room\".\n\nA slightly different version of the short story was featured in the November 1991 issue of \"Omni\". The \"OMNI\" version concerns an unnamed girl and an old man named Skinner who live in the one-room shack built on top of the first cable tower of the Bridge. This version was collected in Gardner Dozois' 1992 anthology \"\", and in Larry McCaffery's \"After Yesterday's Crash\" (1995).\n\n\"Skinner's Room\" is the first appearance of the Bridge in Gibson's fiction. In the acknowledgments at the end of his 1994 novel \"Virtual Light\", Gibson writes that the short story later developed into the novel; the character of Skinner is one of the main characters in \"Virtual Light\" and the setting and characters of \"Skinner's Room\" are revisited in the sequels to the novel, \"Idoru\" and \"All Tomorrow's Parties\" (collectively known as the Bridge trilogy).\n\n\"The New York Times\" hailed the \"Visionary San Francisco\" exhibition as \"one of the most ambitious, and admirable, efforts to address the realm of architecture and cities that any museum in the country has mounted in the last decade\". Despite organiser Paulo Polledri's claim that the collaboration was an \"appeal to civic responsibility by showing the effects of its absence\", \"The New York Times\" judged Ming and Hodgetts's reaction to \"Skinner's Room\" a \"powerful, but sad and not a little cynical, work\". After its 1991 republication in \"OMNI\", \"Skinner's Room\" was nominated for the Locus Award for Best Short Story in 1992.\n\n"}
{"id": "2202344", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2202344", "title": "Supplementary protection certificate", "text": "Supplementary protection certificate\n\nIn the European Economic Area (European Union member countries, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway), a supplementary protection certificate (SPC) is a \"sui generis\" intellectual property (IP) right that extends the duration of certain rights associated with a patent. It enters into force after expiry of a patent upon which it is based. This type of right is available for various regulated, biologically active agents, namely human or veterinary medicaments and plant protection products (e.g. insecticides, and herbicides). Supplementary protection certificates were introduced to encourage innovation by compensating for the long time needed to obtain regulatory approval of these products (i.e. authorisation to put these products on the market).\n\nA supplementary protection certificate comes into force only after the corresponding general patent expires. It normally has a maximum lifetime of 5 years. The duration of the SPC can, however, be extended to 5.5 years when the SPC relates to a human medicinal product for which data from clinical trials conducted in accordance with an agreed Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) have been submitted (as set out in Article 36 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006).\n\nThe total combined duration of market exclusivity of a general patent and SPC cannot normally exceed 15 years. However, the reward of a 6-month SPC extension for the submission of data from an agreed PIP can extend this combined duration to 15.5 years.\n\nSPCs extend the monopoly period for a \"product\" (active ingredient or a combination of active ingredients) that is protected by a patent. For many SPC applications, there is no controversy about the definition of the \"product\" or whether it is protected by the patent upon which the SPC application was based. However, there are other SPC applications (particularly for medicinal products containing multiple active ingredients) where there may not be clear answers to questions such as what is a permissible definition of a \"product\", and what test should be applied for determining whether a patent protects that \"product\".\n\nSupplementary protection certificates in the European Union are based primarily upon two regulations. Although all countries in the EU are required to provide supplementary protection certificates, no unified cross-recognition exist. Applications must be filed and approved on a country-by-country basis.\n\nAccording to Article 4 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1768/92, the scope of an SPC extends \"\"only to the product covered by the authorization to place the corresponding medicinal product on the market and for any use of the product as a medicinal product that has been authorized before the expiry of the certificate\"\".\n\nThe European Court of Justice has decided, however, that the scope of an SPC is sometimes capable of encompassing more than just the single form of the active ingredient that is included in the medicinal product authorised for sale. Thus, in case C-392/97, the European Court of Justice held that:\n\"\"where an active ingredient in the form of a salt is referred to in the marketing authorisation concerned and is protected by a basic patent in force, the certificate is capable of covering the active ingredient as such and also its various derived forms such as salts and esters, as medicinal products, in so far as they are covered by the protection of the basic patent\"\".\n\nSupplementary protection certificates in the European Union were based primarily upon two regulations:\n\n\nThe above Regulations have now been codified under the following regulation:\n\nSupplementary protection certificates may come into life at the expiry of a national or European patent. However, the European Patent Convention (EPC) needed to be modified to allow such \"extension\" of the term of European patent. Article 63 of the EPC was modified on 17 December 1991 to specify to, although European patents have a term of 20 years as from the date of filing of the application (Art. 63(1)),\n\nThis constituted the first revision of the European Patent Convention since its signature in 1973.\n\nThe paediatric extension is based primarily upon:\n\n\nThe term of an SPC depends on the date of issuance of the first marketing authorization (MA) within the EEA and can be determined by the equation:\n\nUnder normal circumstances, this means the following.\n\nThere have been very few cases where there was any controversy over the precise date of the 1st MA in the EEA. The Hässle AB case (ECJ case C-127/00) was one of that small number. In that case, the ECJ ruled that the decisive date for SPC purposes is the date of an authorisation from a regulatory body tasked with assessing safety and efficacy, and not the date of a subsequent authorisation that may be required under national pricing or reimbursement provisions.\n\nSo-called \"centralised\" (European Medicines Agency / European Commission) MAs were introduced by Regulation 2309/93 and became available in January 1995 (i.e. some 2 years after the introduction of the original SPC legislation for medicinal products). The introduction of these authorisations added a new layer of complexity to the issue of determination of the date of a MA. This is because there are two dates associated with \"centralised\" authorisations, namely: (1) the date of the European Commission's decision to issue an authorisation; and (2) the date of notification of that decision to the MA applicant. Date (2) is usually a few days (e.g. 2 to 4 days) later than date (1). Although the standard practice of many national patent offices seems to be to calculate SPC term based upon date (1), an October 2011 article in Scrip Regulatory Affairs by Mike Snodin argues that this standard practice is incorrect and that date (2) should be used instead (with the result that some products may be entitled to a slightly longer SPC term than previously thought). Paramount amongst the reasons for preferring date (2) to date (1) is that a \"centralised\" authorisation does not become effective until it is notified to the MA applicant.\n\nThe UK Intellectual Property Office has now accepted Snodin's arguments on this point and has changed its standard practice regarding the calculation of SPC term. It remains to be seen whether any other national offices will follow suit. However, inspection of Belgian SPC certificates for products authorised via the \"centralised\" procedure reveals that at least the patent office in Belgium already appears to base calculations of SPC term upon date (2). Thus, there are divergent practices across different territories within Europe with regard to the selection of a date for a \"centralised\" MA, with Belgium and the UK IPO being in the minority. If the issue were ever to be debated in a national court, this fact that there are divergent practices across different territories could provide basis for such a court to seek an authoratitive ruling from the ECJ in relation to which of dates (1) and (2) should be used for SPCs. This is because, as European Commission legislation, the Regulations governing SPCs should be interpreted consistently across all member states of the EU.\n\nAn MA in Switzerland was also considered as being a first MA for the calculation of the SPC duration, even though Switzerland is not part of the European Economic Area (EEA). This is because such a MA was automatically effective in Liechtenstein, which is a member of the EEA (since 1 May 1995). This was decided by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in joined cases \"Novartis et al. v. Comptroller-General\" and \"Ministère de l'Economie v. Millennium Pharmaceuticals\". The same point was also confirmed in case C-617/12 (\"AstraZeneca AB v Comptroller General of Patents, Designs and Trade Marks\"), in a case where the data that persuaded Swissmedic to grant the (earlier) Swiss MA was held by the European Medicines Agency to not be complete or persuasive enough to justify the grant of a MA under EU legislation (Directive 2001/83/EC).\nHowever, as answer to the decision of the ECJ the contract between Switzerland and Liechtenstein was amended. Since 1 July 2005 the automatic effect of a Swiss MA in Liechtenstein is abolished. The recognition is now delayed by a time period, which is normally 12 months.\n\nArticle 36 of Regulation 1901/2006 provides for a 6-month extension to SPC term. The extension is available only under certain conditions, the most notable being the requirement for the submission of a new MA application containing data from all trials conducted in accordance with an agreed Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP).\n\nConsequences of the 6-month SPC extension include:\n\nAn extension of an SPC can only be awarded if there is an SPC to extend. As an unextended SPC only has a positive term if more than 5 years have elapsed between patent filing and MA issuance, this leads to the following two questions.\n\n(1) Is an SPC available if less than 5 years and 1 day have elapsed between filing of the corresponding patent and issuance of the first MA in the EEA?\n\n(2) If the answer to (1) is yes, what term should be awarded to the (unextended) SPC?\n\nA July 2007 paper by Snodin and Miles, put forward three possible answers to this combination of two questions.\n\nIf the answer to question (1) is no, then it is not relevant to consider question (2). This corresponds to \"Model B\" of the 2007 Snodin and Miles paper, and produces a curious situation where longer marketing exclusivity can be obtained if the issuance of the first MA in the EEA is delayed (to at least 5 years and 1-day from filing of the corresponding patent).\n\nIf the answer to question (1) is yes, then question (2) becomes relevant. This question can be answered in two ways, corresponding to either \"Model A\" or \"Model C\" of the 2007 Snodin and Miles paper.\n\nModel A assumes that SPC term can validly be either zero or negative if 5 years or less have elapsed from filing of the corresponding patent to issuance of the first MA in the EEA. In this event, a positive (and non-zero) SPC term is obtained (after extension) if the time from patent filing to MA issuance is more than 4.5 years.\n\nModel C assumes that all term calculations that provide a negative answer are 'rounded up' to zero. This has the consequence of providing a minimum of 6 months of SPC term, irrespective of how little time has elapsed from patent filing to MA issuance.\n\nSubsequent to the publication of the Snodin and Miles article, Merck & Co. filed SPC applications for the product sitagliptin. For example, from mid-August to mid-September 2007, Merck & Co. filed SPC applications in various countries, including the UK, Ireland, the Netherlands and Italy. These SPC applications provided an early opportunity for Models A to C to be tested in practice. Curiously, the patent offices of various EU member states did not reach any consensus on which model is correct. For example, the Netherlands and the UK favoured Model A, Germany, Portugal and Slovenia favoured Model B and Greece favoured Model C.\n\nIn connection with an appeal against refusal of the SPC application in Germany, and in view of the different stances taken by different national patent offices, the German Federal Court of Justice (\"Bundesgerichtshof\") sought clarification of the law from the Court of Justice of the EU (in case C-125/10).\n\nThe decision of the Court of Justice, delivered on 8 December 2011, essentially agreed with Model A of the 2007 Snodin and Miles paper. Thus, useful (extended) supplementary protection can now be obtained so long as at least 4 years, 6 months and one day has elapsed from the date of patent filing to the date of the first MA for the product in the EEA.\n\nECJ cases C-195/09 and C-427/09 effectively ruled that SPCs for medicaments (human or veterinary) are only available for those \"products\" that:\n\n(a) are protected by a patent;\n\n(b) have been subject to an administrative authorisation procedure; and\n\n(c) have not been placed on the market anywhere in the EEA as a medicinal product prior to being subject to safety and efficacy testing and a regulatory review.\n\nUntil recently, decisions C-195/09 and C-427/09 could have been interpreted as ruling out the possibility of SPC protection for all \"products\" previously included in medicinal products that were marketed prior to the date(s) of the Marketing Authorisation(s) (MA(s)) specified in the SPC application. This is because the ECJ's rulings in C-195/09 and C-427/09 were based in part upon a desire to ensure that national patent offices are not required to assess whether an earlier MA was compliant with the standards for testing of safety and efficacy that were introduced in the 1970s (meaning that all prior MAs, whether or not compliant with those standards, should be treated equally under the SPC legislation).\n\nHowever, the decision in Neurim Pharmaceuticals (C-130/11) has cast doubt upon this interpretation. In C-130/11, the ECJ held that an SPC can be granted regardless of the prior marketing of earlier (veterinary) medicinal products containing the \"product\" in question. Thus, cases C-195/09 and C-427/09 (which, in common with C-130/11, related to SPC applications based upon newly patented uses for old \"products\") could perhaps now be viewed as being of relevance only to those \"products\" that were marketed before being subject to a regulatory review. However, this might necessitate patent offices making a determination of whether prior MAs are compliant with current standards (i.e. whether the \"product\" had been subject to safety and efficacy testing prior to being granted an MA). As this is precisely the kind of determination that the ECJ had previously been keen for patent offices to avoid, further references to the ECJ may be necessary to clarify precisely which \"products\" fall within the scope of the SPC legislation and which do not.\n\nWith respect to (a) above, the question of how to determine whether a \"product\" is protected by a patent is the subject of ongoing controversy. Cases such as C-322/10 and C-422/10 have indicated that the \"product\" needs to be \"specified [or identified] in the wording of the claims\". However, the precise meaning of this test is yet to be clarified.\n\nFurther, although the SPC legislation mentions only Directives 2001/83/EC and 2001/82/EC as the \"administrative authorisation procedure\" for human or veterinary medicaments, SPCs are known to have been granted when MAs have not been obtained via those procedures (but instead via procedures that involve a similar level of safety and efficacy testing).\n\nAccording to research, more than 8,000 SPCs for medicinal and plant protection products have been filed in Europe between 1991 and 2003.\n\n\n\n"}

Along with singers Ultra Nate, Deborah Cox, she is considered to be one of the divas of the 1990s club music scene. She also is one of the few Latinas to become a successful artist in the English-language dance music genre.\n\nBorn in the New York City borough of the Queens, her parents who were originally from Cuba encouraged her to pursue her artistic inclinations. Veronica began her career in 1995 when she was 21 years old with the release of the lead single \"Without Love\" released on August 29, 1995 two months prior to the debut album \"V...As in Veronica\" which was released on October 24, 1995. The album was a mixture of R&B and Hip hop. The album featured production from Rodney Jerkins and Dallas Austin. On October 28, 1997, when Veronica was 23 years old she released her second album \"Rise\". This album was again R&B and Hip Hop influenced. She released two singles/videos off of this album. The first single was \"No One But You\" and it featured Craig Mack. The second single and album title track Rise was released and that featured guest vocals by Big Pun & Cuban Link.\n\nAs one of the first artists to signed to Jellybean Recordings, a label founded by music producer Jellybean Benitez, Veronica had a string of hits on the \"Billboard\" Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart, including three which reached the top ten. \"Let Me Go... Release Me\" landed the number one spot in 1998, and soon afterwards it was followed by the club anthem \"Someone to Hold\" (which peaked at the number two slot) which was remixed by producer Johnny Vicious and played heavily in the club circuit scene. The song still remains a classic among clubgoers today and it was featured on the soundtrack to the independent film \"Trick\" released in 1999 and starred Christian Campbell and Tori Spelling. She scored a second number one dance hit in 2000 with her cover of Evelyn \"Champagne\" King's classic R&B song \"I'm in Love\", which was rerecorded for a club setting. She remains a very popular singer to this very day among gay audiences and especially in the club circuit scene.\n\nShe moved away from New York and the club music scene for a few years. During these years, she pursued her love for musical theater and was given the opportunity to portray slain Tejano singer Selena in a traveling production about her life and times. The production, titled Selena Forever traveled to numerous cities with a large Mexican-American population for over a year. Shortly after the successful run of the production, she decided to return to New York and start a family and return to her love of music. In 2004, Veronica recorded a song with rapper Triple Seis titled \"Krazy\". The song was featured on Triple Seis' debut album \"Time'll Tell\". After a brief hiatus, Veronica returned in 2006, with music producer Tim Rex on her first dance single in over five years, \"Relentless...Just a Game\". She can be seen in the 2007 film \"The Singer\" where she plays Héctor Lavoe's mother in his younger years.\n\nShe presently resides in New York City with her husband, Christopher Jackson, who starred in \"Hamilton\", and their son, C.J. After her son was diagnosed with autism, Veronica has become a tireless advocate for further research and has led several efforts, including charitable walks, to raise research funds and awareness for the disorder.\n\n\n"}

She spent her early years in Gatley.\n\nAfter obtaining an English degree at Oxford University, Clegg decided to pursue a career in the theatre. Initial work as an understudy led to more substantial roles, most notably her turn as Cleopatra opposite Cyril Luckham's Caesar at the Liverpool Playhouse. A high-profile tour of Australia with Katharine Hepburn followed, performing plays such as The Merchant of Venice, but by this point Clegg was looking to move into television, a medium where more money could be made with roles in \"Emergency – Ward 10\" and \"The Dream Maker\". She then started writing scripts and in 1961 contributed seven scripts for the television soap opera \"Coronation Street\".\n\nAfter writing for several radio and television serials, including for \"Crossroads\" and a radio dramatisation of \"The Chrysalids\", Clegg was asked to submit ideas for the science fiction television series \"Doctor Who\" in 1981. Her storyline, titled \"The Enlighteners\", involved a space-bound race using anachronistic sailing ships. \"Doctor Who\" script editor Eric Saward decided to use Clegg's story as the last part of a trilogy of three stories, known informally as the \"Black Guardian Trilogy\", as it involved the return of the Black Guardian.\n\nTo integrate \"The Enlighteners\" into the trilogy, portions of the story were rewritten at the request of the production team and the Black and White Guardians replaced the originally planned \"Enlighteners\". Since the title could no longer refer to those entities, the story was renamed \"Enlightenment\".

The issue was raised by astronomers Carl Sagan and George Mullen in 1972. Proposed resolutions of this paradox have taken into account greenhouse effects, changes to planetary albedo, astrophysical influences, or combinations of these suggestions.\n\nAn unresolved question is how a climate suitable for life was maintained on Earth over the long timescale despite the variable solar output and wide range of terrestrial conditions.\n\nEarly in Earth's history, the Sun's output would have been only 70 percent as intense as it is during the modern epoch, owing to a higher ratio of hydrogen to helium in its core. Since then the Sun has gradually brightened and consequently warmed the Earth's surface, a process known as radiative forcing. During the Archaean age, assuming constant albedo and other surface features such as greenhouse gases, Earth's equilibrium temperature would have been too low to sustain a liquid ocean. Astronomers Carl Sagan and George Mullen pointed out in 1972 that this is contrary to the geological and paleontological evidence.\n\nThe sun is powered by nuclear fusion, which for the Sun can be represented in the following way:\n\nIn the equations above e is a positron, e is an electron and ν represents a neutrino (nearly massless). The net effect is three-fold: a release of energy by Einstein's formula ΔE = mc, an increase in the density of the solar core, since the final product is contained in one nucleus as opposed to between four different protons, and an increase in the rate of fusion since higher temperatures help increase the collision speed between the four protons and boost the likelihood that such reactions take place. The net effect is an associated increase in solar luminosity. More recent modeling studies have shown that the Sun is currently 1.4 times brighter today than it was 4.6 billion years ago (Ga), and that it has brightened roughly linearly since then with time, though it has accelerated slightly.\n\nDespite the reduced solar luminosity ago and with greenhouse gas, the geological record shows a continually relatively warm surface in the full early temperature record of Earth, with the exception of a cold phase, the Huronian glaciation, about 2.4 to 2.1 billion years ago. Water-related sediments have been found dating to as early as 3.8 billion years ago. This relationship between surface temperature and the balance of forcing mechanisms has implications for how scientists understand the evolution of early life forms, which have been dated from as early as 3.5 billion years.\n\nSagan and Mullen even suggested during their descriptions of the paradox that it might be solved by high concentrations of ammonia gas, NH. However, it has since been shown that while ammonia is an effective greenhouse gas, it is easily photochemically destroyed in the atmosphere and converted to nitrogen (N) and hydrogen (H) gases. It was suggested (again by Sagan) that a photochemical haze could have prevented this destruction of ammonia and allowed it to continue acting as a greenhouse gas during this time, however this idea was later tested using a photochemical model and discounted. Furthermore, such a haze is thought to have cooled the Earth's surface beneath it and counteracted the greenhouse effect.\n\n It is now thought that carbon dioxide was present in higher concentrations during this period of lower solar radiation. It was first proposed and tested as part of Earth's atmospheric evolution in the late 70s. An atmosphere that contained about 1000 times the Present Atmospheric Level (or PAL) was found to be consistent with the evolutionary path of the Earth's carbon cycle and solar evolution.\n\nThe primary mechanism for attaining such high CO concentrations is the carbon cycle. On large timescales, the inorganic branch of the carbon cycle, which is known as the carbonate-silicate cycle is responsible for determining the partitioning of CO between the atmosphere and the surface of the Earth. In particular, during a time of low surface temperatures, rainfall and weathering rates would be reduced, allowing for the build-up of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere on timescales of 0.5 million years (Myr).\n\nSpecifically, using 1-D models, which represent the Earth as a single point (instead of something that varies across 3 dimensions) scientists have determined that at 4.5 Ga, with a 30% dimmer Sun, a minimum partial pressure of 0.1 bar of CO is required to maintain an above-freezing surface temperature. At a maximum, 10 bar of CO has been suggested as a plausible upper limit.\n\nThe exact amount of carbon dioxide levels is still under debate, however. In 2001, Sleep and Zahnle suggested that increased weathering on the seafloor on a young, tectonically active Earth could have reduced carbon dioxide levels. Then in 2010, Rosing et al analyzed marine sediments called banded iron formations (BIFs), and found large amounts of various iron-rich minerals, including magnetite (FeO), an oxidized mineral alongside siderite (FeCO), and reduced mineral and saw that they formed during the first half of Earth's history (and not afterward). The minerals' relative coexistence suggested an analogous balance between CO and H. In the analysis, Rosing et al connected the atmospheric H concentrations with regulation by biotic methanogenesis. Anaerobic, single-celled organisms that produced methane (CH) may therefore have contributed to the warming in addition to carbon dioxide.\n\nA minority view, propounded by the Israeli-American physicist Nir Shaviv, uses climatological influences of solar wind, combined with a hypothesis of Danish physicist Henrik Svensmark for a cooling effect of cosmic rays, to explain the paradox. According to Shaviv, the early Sun had emitted a stronger solar wind that produced a protective effect against cosmic rays. In that early age, a moderate greenhouse effect comparable to today's would have been sufficient to explain an ice-free Earth. Evidence for a more active early Sun has been found in meteorites.\n\nThe temperature minimum around 2.4 billion years goes along with a cosmic ray flux modulation by a variable star formation rate in the Milky Way. The reduced solar impact later results in a stronger impact of cosmic ray flux (CRF), which is hypothesized to lead to a relationship with climatological variations.\n\nIt has been proposed several times that mass loss from the faint young Sun in the form of stronger solar winds could have compensated for the low temperatures from greenhouse gas forcing. In this framework, the early Sun underwent an extended period of higher solar wind output. This caused a mass loss from the Sun on the order of 5−10 percent over its lifetime, resulting in a more consistent level of solar luminosity (as the early Sun had more mass, resulting in more energy output than was predicted). In order to explain the warm conditions in the Archean era, this mass loss must have occurred over an interval of about one billion years. Records of ion implantation from meteorites and lunar samples show that the elevated rate of solar wind flux only lasted for a period of 0.1 billion years. Observations of the young Sun-like star π Ursae Majoris matches this rate of decline in the stellar wind output, suggesting that a higher mass loss rate can not by itself resolve the paradox.\n\nIf greenhouse gas concentrations did not compensate completely for the fainter sun, the moderate temperature range may be explained by a lower surface albedo. At the time, a smaller area of exposed continental land would have resulted in fewer cloud condensation nuclei both in the form of wind-blown dust and biogenic sources. A lower albedo allows a higher fraction of solar radiation to penetrate to the surface. Goldblatt and Zahnle (2011) investigated whether a change in cloud fraction could have been sufficiently warming and found that the net effect was equally likely to have been negative as positive. At most the effect could have raised surface temperatures to just above freezing on average.\n\nAnother proposed mechanism of cloud cover reduction relates a decrease in cosmic rays during this time to reduced cloud fraction. However, this mechanism does not work for several reasons including the fact that ions do not limit cloud formation as much as CCN, and cosmic rays have been found to have little impact on global mean temperature.\n\nClouds continue to be the dominant source of uncertainty in 3-D global climate models, and a consensus has yet to be reached on exactly how changes in cloud spatial patterns and cloud type may have affected Earth's climate during this time.\n\nThe Gaia Hypothesis holds that biological processes work to maintain a stable surface climate on Earth to maintain habitability through various negative feedback mechanisms. While organic processes, such as the organic carbon cycle, work to regulate dramatic climate changes, and that the surface of Earth has presumably remained habitable, this hypothesis has been criticized as intractable. Furthermore, life has existed on the surface of the Earth through dramatic changes in climate, including Snowball Earth episodes. There are also strong and weak versions of the Gaia hypothesis, which has caused some tension in this research area.\n\nMars has its own version of the faint young Sun paradox. Martian terrains show clear signs of past liquid water on the surface, including outflow channels, gullies, modified craters, and valley networks. These geomorphic features suggest Mars had an ocean on its surface and river networks that resemble current Earth's during the late Noachian (4.1–3.7 Ga). It is unclear how Mars's orbital pattern, which places it even further from the Sun, and the faintness of the young Sun could have produced what is thought to have been a very warm and wet climate on Mars. Scientists debate over which geomorphological features can be attributed to shorelines or other water flow markers and which can be ascribed to other mechanisms.. Nevertheless, the geologic evidence, including observations of widespread fluvial erosion in the southern highlands, are generally consistent with an early warm and semi-arid climate. \n\nGiven the orbital and solar conditions of early Mars, a greenhouse effect would have been necessary to boost surface temperatures at least 65 K in order for these surface features to have been carved by flowing water. A much denser, CO-dominated atmosphere has been proposed as a way to produce such a temperature increase. This would depend upon the carbon cycle and the rate of volcanism throughout the pre-Noachian and Noachian, which is not well known. Volatile outgassing is thought to have occurred during these periods.\n\nOne way to ascertain whether Mars possessed a thick CO-rich atmosphere is to look at carbonate deposits. A primary sink for carbon in the Earth atmosphere is the carbonate-silicate cycle. It is however hard for CO to have built up in the Martian atmosphere in this way because the greenhouse effect would have been outstripped by CO condensation.\n\nA volcanically-outgassed CO-H greenhouse is one of the most potent warming solutions recently suggested for early Mars . Intermittent bursts of methane may have been another possibility. Such greenhouse gas combinations appear necessary because carbon dioxide alone, even at pressures exceeding a few bar, cannot explain the temperatures required for the presence of surface liquid water on early Mars.\n\nVenus's atmosphere is composed of 96% carbon dioxide, and during this time, billions of years ago, when the Sun was 25 to 30% dimmer Venus's surface temperature could have been much cooler, and its climate could have resembled current Earth's, complete with a hydrological cycle – before it experienced a runaway greenhouse effect.\n\n"}

The 2011 Census recorded the parish's population as 2,248. The parish is bounded by the River Ray to the south, its tributary the River Bure to the west, the outskirts of Bicester to the north and field boundaries to the east.\n\nThe village is east of Alchester Roman Town. Ambrosden has a Church of England parish church and a public house. Since the Second World War Ambrosden has housed British Army personnel stationed at St. George's Barracks, which is at Arncott about south of Ambrosden. The Ministry of Defence had many new houses built at Ambrosden in the early 1950s.\n\nAmbrosden is about southwest of Bicester (the nearest railway station), connected by the A41 road. The site of Alchester Roman Town is about west of the village, and the village of Arncott is about to the south.\n\nIn 1932 Langford, Wretchwick, and Middle Wretchwick Farms, which were formerly part of the Bicester Market End township, were added to Ambrosden. The townships of Blackthorn and Arncott were part of Arncott but in the 20th century were detached to form separate parishes. The present Ambrosden parish is about wide both north–south and east–west.\n\nThree bridges cross the River Ray in the parish: Heath Bridge and Arncott Bridge, and Blackthorn Bridge. Arncott Bridge is on the road between Arncott and Ambrosden and is a five-arched bridge built in the 18th century.\n\nThe land is relatively level, about above sea level, apart from Graven Hill north-west of the village, which is high.\n\nIn the 19th century it was believed that the toponym \"Ambrosden\" came from a diminutive derivative of the name Ambrosius Aurelianus, a 5th-century British commander of Roman descent, and that the commander had encamped close the present site of Ambrosden to help the neighbouring military garrison at Alchester in conflicts with the Anglo-Saxons. The word \"don\" or \"den\", an Old English word meaning \"a place on a hill or ascent\", was added as a suffix. Thus, a Roman name and an English syllable may have been combined as \"Ambrosden\".\n\nThis interpretation, however, has been rejected by historians who believe the toponym was derived not from Ambrosius, but from the Old English for \"Ambre's hill\". This seems unlikely however, as 'ambre' means 'bucket' in old English. The forms \"Ambresdone\", \"Ambresden\", or \"Aumbresden\" were all recorded in the Middle Ages.\n\nThe course of Akeman Street Roman road, which linked Watling Street with the Fosse Way, passes through the parish less than north of the village. Roman pottery has been found in the area. When the scholar and antiquarian White Kennett was Vicar of Ambrosden (from 1685 to 1708), ancient Danish remains were found in the parish.\n\nDuring the reign of King Edward the Confessor a lady called Elviva (probably a Latin rendering of the Old English name Ælfgifu), held the manor of Ambrosden. The \"Domesday Book\" records that by 1086 she had been replaced by Hugh d'Ivry, butler of William the Conqueror and brother of Roger d'Ivry, who owned several manors in Oxfordshire. Hugh's nephew Roger II d'Ivry inherited Ambrosden and by 1194 it was part of the Honour of St. Valery. Ambrosden thus passed to Edmund, 2nd Earl of Cornwall, who in 1288 gave the manor to Ashridge Priory of the Augustinian order of the Brothers of Penitence. Ashridge Priory retained Ambrosden until the priory was dissolved in 1539 in the Dissolution of the Monasteries.\n\nIn 1542, the Crown granted Ambrosden to John Denton of Blackthorn, who was lord of the manor of one of the manors of Bicester. Ambrosden remained in the hands of the Denton family until 1604, when Edward Denton and his son-in-law Edward Smyth of Stoke Prior, Worcestershire sold the manor to Margaret Whethill of London. Margaret married Sir Thomas Mildmay of Chelmsford, whose family were recusants. Their grandson Francis Mildmay was a Royalist in the English Civil War, so in 1648 Parliament sequestered his estates. During the Commonwealth of England, the Treason Trustees twice sold Ambrosden to wealthy Londoners: to John Warre in 1653 and to William Drax and Alexander Jackson in 1657. Francis Mildmay recovered Ambrosden but in 1658 mortgaged it to Sir James Drax, also of London and in 1660 sold of the estate to various yeoman farmers.\n\nIn 1673, Francis Mildmay's widow Mary and son, Walter Mildmay, sold the remainder of the manor to Sir William Glynne, 1st Baronet, of Bicester. Sir William rebuilt the manor house shortly afterwards. Ambrosden remained with the Glynne family until Sir Stephen Glynne, 3rd Baronet sold it in 1729.\n\nDuring the English Civil War, the area was occupied in June 1643, when part of the King's forces were at Bicester and guarded Blackthorn Bridge.\n\nIn 1729 the manor was bought by Edward Turner, who had already bought one of the manors of Bicester from Sir Stephen in 1728. In 1733, Turner was made the first of the Turner and Page-Turner baronets of Ambrosden. In around 1740, Sir Edward Turner, 2nd Baronet replaced the Glynnes' manor house with a large square house of eleven bays. In its construction, the house reused stone from the manor house, mixed with local limestone from the Stone Pitts quarry at Blackthorn, Oxfordshire and Cotswold stone from Bibury in Gloucestershire. The architect was Sanderson Miller, who also designed ornamental buildings in the grounds.\n\nA landscaped park with lakes and statues was laid out around the house, and the drive to the house was along a semicircular avenue of trees. Sir Edward died in 1766. Sir Gregory Page-Turner, 3rd Baronet considered the house too large, so in 1767 he sought to demolish part of it to create a smaller house. This proved impossible so in 1768 he had the entire house demolished.\n\nAmbrosden remained with the Turner (later Page-Turner) baronets until 1874 when Sir Edward Henry Page-Turner, 6th Baronet died childless. The 6th Baronet left all his estates to his nephew, Frederick Augustus Blaydes. The Blaydes took the Page-Turner name and coat of arms in 1903, but sold the estate in 1930.\n\nThe earliest part of the Church of England parish church of St Mary the Virgin is the 12th-century Norman north doorway. The Early English Gothic west tower was built slightly later. The south aisle was added in the 14th century and the chancel was rebuilt in the 15th century with Perpendicular Gothic traceried windows.\n\nThe church plan, as existed and as chronicled in 1823 records, and in possession of John Wayland, esq. of Woodeaton, had a large courtyard entered through two elegant gates with a cross fixed at the northern part. The southern end of courtyard also had a cemetery. The main church building comprised:\n\nThe south porch leads to an aisle that is lit by four two-light windows. Between the aisle and the nave is a four-bay arcade. The nave has three clerestory windows similar to those in the north wall of the church. The nave pews are 17th-century. The pulpit and reading desk are late 17th-century, added in the reign of James II. The pulpit was refurbished in 1819 with cushion and cloth given by Lady Turner, bearing insignia of the Turner family. The nave had a west gallery where there was a painting of the Resurrection of Jesus. According to inscriptions it was given by the parishioners.\n\nThe church is a Grade II* listed building.\n\nThe bell tower has a ring of eight bells. The third bell was cast by Richard Keene of Woodstock in 1697. The fourth was cast by Henry III Bagley of Chacombe, Northamptonshire in 1716. Bagley had more than one bell-foundry, but the nearest was at Witney. The fifth was cast by Edward Hemins of Bicester in 1743. St Mary's has a bell cast by W. & J. Taylor in 1840, presumably at their then Oxford foundry. In 1928 Taylors cast the treble, second and tenor bells, but at their Loughborough foundry St Mary's also has a small Sanctus bell cast by Peter de Weston of London in about 1336.\n\nThe ecclesiastical parish of Ambrosden is now part of the Benefice of the Ray Valley, and St Mary's also serves as the British Army garrison chapel.\n\nThe nearby vicarage dates from 1638. The Reverend White Kennett (1660–1728) was vicar of Ambrosden from 1685 until 1708. During his incumbency, Kennett became tutor and vice-principal at St Edmund Hall, Oxford and published a number of scholarly works. Kennett was also Rector of St Botolph's Aldgate in London from 1700, Archdeacon of Huntingdon from 1701 and Dean of Peterborough from 1707. It therefore seems likely that Kennett may have been largely absent from Ambrosden in the latter years of his tenure. He relinquished the living of Ambrosden in 1708. Kennett was consecrated Bishop of Peterborough in 1718.\n\nThere is a record of a windmill at Ambrosden in 1300. A document of 1633 records a Windmill Field and Windmill Way. Ambrosden was farmed by an open field system until at least the 17th century. By 1623 there had been several small Enclosures of agricultural land in the parish and by 1685 some common lands were reported to have been enclosed, with further enclosures reported between 1702 and 1785. By 1809 Ambrosden's field system was described as being completely enclosed.\n\nIn 1741 Sir Edward Turner, 2nd Baronet constructed a new road between Ambrosden and Merton. He intended the road to eventually connect to Oxford, but the remainder of the project was never completed. The road was reputed to cost a guinea a yard. The road includes a completely straight stretch of about and generally runs across level ground, although its course undulates at regular intervals, intended to use gravity to help draught animals pull vehicles.\nIn January 1764 one barge experimentally carried one load of coal from the Thames at Oxford up the River Cherwell to Islip and thence up the old course of the River Ray to Arncott. The coal was landed at Arncott Bridge and delivered thence by wheelbarrows to Sir Edward Turner, 2nd Baronet at Ambrosden House. However, the experiment seems not to have been repeated and did not establish a regular freight trade on the river.\n\nIn 1811 the village had only 140 inhabitants and in 1815 the annual estate value was assessed as £1,240. The parish then included three townships: Ambrosden, Arncott and Blackthorn.\n\nAmbrosden Old Park, where Ambrosden House had been demolished, was sometimes used for horse-racing. In 1829 \"Jackson's Oxford Journal\" complained that a race meeting in the park attracted a thousand \"idlers\" characterized by \"dullness and stupidity\" and was marred by \"brutal and disgraceful fighting\" despite the presence of several members of the gentry.\n\nA parish school was opened in Ambrosden in 1818 but seems to have ceased operating by 1854. A temporary school existed in the village in 1868 and a permanent parish school building in a Gothic Revival style was completed and opened in 1876. In 1952 the primary school had an attendance of 194 pupils, including children from the War Department housing estate. In the latter part of the 20th century the school was moved to new premises and was renamed Five Acres Primary School. The 1876 school building is now the village hall.\nThe Buckinghamshire Railway's Oxford and line was built through the northwest corner of the parish and opened in 1851. Its nearest station to Ambrosden is , north of the village. The London and North Western Railway worked the Buckinghamshire Railway from its opening and absorbed the company in 1879. This part of the Buckinghamshire Railway is now the Oxford to Bicester Line, currently operated by Chiltern Railways.\n\nMains electricity was introduced to Ambrosden in 1935. The Bicester Military Railway between Bicester and Piddington was built through Ambrosden in 1941 and remains in use to this day. In 1951–52 the Ministry of Defence and the Central Ordnance Depot had a new housing estate of some 200 houses built in the village. The Government bought a significant area of land from most of the farms in the parish. There are three types of house, all designed by the architect R. Potter of Salisbury, all built of brick and roofed with tiles, and many sited around a green.\n\nThe British Army, which has personnel at St. George's Barracks in nearby Arncott, has been in the village since the Second World War. Also, the military depot (considered an industrial installation related to support of military operations) was sited in Bicester during the war. This affected Ambrosden village, which adjoins the northern side of the garrison. In Ambrosden village, extensive buildings as housing accommodation and amenities were built for the military.\n\nAmbrosden's amenities include the parish church, the Turner Arms pub, a post office, a village hall (the former school) and the current primary school. The village has also a hair salon, a car dealer and garage and a craft shop.\n\nThe Army provides its personnel and their families with a community centre that includes a library, a gymnasium, a careers centre and an indoor swimming pool.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2202397", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2202397", "title": "Gropius House", "text": "Gropius House\n\nThe Gropius House was the family residence of architect Walter Gropius at 68 Baker Bridge Road, Lincoln, Massachusetts. It is now a historic house museum, owned by Historic New England, and is open to the public. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 2000 for its association with Gropius, an influential teacher and leader of Modernist philosophy of architecture. The house includes a collection of Bauhaus-related materials that is unparalleled outside Germany.\n\nAs the first director of the Bauhaus, Gropius was concerned with combining useful modern technologies with consumer need, while placing equal emphasis on architectural integrity and decorative arts.\n\nGropius and his family came to the United States after a three-year stay in London, where they had moved to avoid the Nazi regime. Gropius went to Massachusetts to accept a teaching position at Harvard University's Graduate School of Design. Fellow architect and prominent Boston figure Henry Shepley convinced philanthropist Helen Storrow to provide the land and fund both the designing and building process of a home. He designed the home in 1937 and it was built with local builder Casper J. Jenney in 1938. Gropius used his new home as a showcase for his Harvard students as well as an example of modernist landscape architecture in America. He chose the area because of its proximity to Concord Academy which his daughter, Ati, was going to attend. It remained Gropius's home from 1938 until his death in 1969.\n\nMarcel Breuer, a fellow architect and friend of the Gropius family, came to the U.S. shortly after the Gropius family, also to become part of the Harvard design faculty. Mrs. Helen Storrow provided a neighboring plot of land to Breuer, where he could showcase his own design philosophies. Gropius and Breuer assisted one another in the construction of their homes, completing their dwellings in 1938 and 1939, respectively. The Gropius House continues to have many pieces of Breuer furniture on display. The house also contains works by Eero Saarinen, Joan Miró, and Herbert Bayer that were given as gifts to Walter Gropius.\n\nAt the time of the building of the Gropius House, Walter and Ise's adopted daughter Ati was 12 years old. Gropius took much care in making sure Ati was happy and comfortable, while also allowing her a great deal of input into the design of her own space. Ati chose her warm-toned color palette and much of her furniture, which included a desk Gropius had designed as part of the Bauhaus in 1922. Ati's room was the largest of the three bedrooms, with her own private entrance that included a spiral wrought-iron staircase. Though Gropius could not give her the sand floor and glass ceiling she requested, he did give her a private roof deck so that she could sleep under the stars.\n\nIn keeping with Bauhaus philosophy, every aspect of the house and its surrounding landscape was planned for maximum efficiency and simplicity. Gropius carefully sited the house to complement its New England habitat on a grassy rise surrounded by stone retaining walls, amidst wetlands and an orchard of 90 apple trees which the Gropiuses allowed to grow naturally other than a few rounds of mowing during the growing season. Gropius wanted the outdoor space around the home to be an equally \"civilized area\" and created a lawn that extended twenty feet around the entire house, with a perennial garden expanding in the south by the porch. Although the house sits on a rather flat plot of land, by keeping the woodlands well maintained, the Gropiuses were able to retain a broad view of the south, east, and west. His screened porch was placed in such a way that it helps to divide the land around the house into multiple zones, comparable to rooms inside a house. The house was conceived as part of an organic landscape, where Gropius utilized indoor/outdoor spaces to accentuate a relationship between the structure and the site. Before the home's design was even complete, Walter Gropius was hard at work creating the ideal landscape. He selected mature trees from the neighboring forest and helped to transplant them in what would later become his yard. Ise was the predominate landscaper in the family, and she and Walter selected Scotch pine, white pine, elm, oak, and American Beech trees to complement their surroundings. The Gropiuses also added \"rescued\" boulders and wooden trellises adorned with pink climbing roses and Concord grapevines to flatter the New England landscape. Bittersweet vines and trumpet vines also connected the home to nature. Ise spent many hours each week planting, weeding, and trimming. She also filled and maintained more than a dozen bird feeders and bird houses on the property and claimed to have known more than ninety birds personally. After a trip to Japan in the 1950s, Mrs. Gropius removed the perennials and covered the ground in a layer of gray gravel, where she then planted azaleas, candytuft, cotoneaster, and one large red-leafed Japanese Maple.\n\nSet amid fields, forests, and farmhouses, the Gropius House mixes up the traditional materials of New England architecture (wood, brick, and fieldstone) with industrial materials such as glass block, acoustic plaster, welded steel, and chrome banisters. The house structure consists of a traditional New England post and beam wooden frame, sheathed with white painted tongue and grove vertical siding. Traditional clapboards are used in the interior foyer, but are applied vertically, to create the illusion of height. The clapboards also performed a practical function as a gallery. Because the works displayed in the Gropius House was almost ever-changing, the wood served as an easy surface to nail into, patch, repaint, and start over again. The home contains a living room that shares an open floor plan with a dining room, kitchen, an office, a sewing room, three bedrooms, and four bathrooms. All bathrooms were positioned in the less-prominent northwest corner of the house, and all used the same plumbing stack for maximum efficiency. One of the most notable differences between the Gropius House and its adjacent homes was the flat roof. While in much of Europe and even in certain parts of the United States flat roofs were becoming quite common, in Lincoln and surrounding areas high pointed roofs with gables were the norm. Gropius fashioned his flat roof with a slight tilt to the center where water could drain off to a dry well on the property.\n\nIn 1931, Walter Gropius was asked to write an article describing the ideal livable small home for \"Architectural Forum\". Gropius outlined the most important aspects of the home's design, sounding like a true description of the Lincoln dwelling: \"The swelling house should no longer resemble something like a fortress, like a monument of walls with medieval thickness and an expensive front intended for showy representation. Instead it is to be of light construction, full of bright daylight and sunshine, alterable, time-saving, economical and useful in the last degree to its occupants whose life functions it is intended to serve.\"\n\nGropius went on to describe an ideal layout of such a house, almost literally outlining the Gropius House composition: \"The ground plan ... is a geometrical projection of its spacial idea – the organizing plan for moving within a house. The elevation, facade, is the result of that plan and not the starting point ... Hence, no artificial symmetry, but a free functional arrangement of the succession of rooms, short, time-saving passages of communication, moving space for children, clear separation between the living, the sleeping, and the housekeeping parts of the house, and finally, proper utilization of the ground and especially the sunny aspect. The bedrooms need morning sun (facing east) the living rooms should have southern to western light, and the northside is left to storerooms, kitchens, staircases and bathrooms.\"\n\nNot everyone was a fan of the Gropius house, especially conservative neighbors. One particular neighbor, James Loud, felt that the Gropius House clashed with the Colonial Revival style homes of the surrounding neighborhood. According to Loud, both the Gropius House and the home designed by Marcel Breuer looked like \"chicken coops.\"\n\nFive years after Walter's death, Ise donated the property to the Society for the Preservation of New England Antiquities (now called Historic New England) in 1974, though she remained in tenancy for the rest of her life. In 1984, a year after Ise's death, the home became a museum.\n\n\n"}

The original pilot episode aired on January 23, 1985, followed by the four-season series run from September 1985 to 1989.\n\nSeason 1 comprises 65 episodes - a standard number for animated series at the time, as it allowed the series to be shown every weekday for thirteen weeks (one full broadcast season). In 1986, the series returned for a TV movie, \"ThunderCats - Ho!\", which was subsequently aired as five separate episodes worked into the continuing rerun rotation of Season 1. The second season, which produced sixty episodes, was broadcast as three seasons between 1987 and 1989. Each broadcast season began with a five-part miniseries that established the new concepts and characters that would play into the events of the season that followed. Most online episode guides for the series list the episodes in two seasons as they were originally produced.\n\nThe entire series has been released on DVD, collecting both seasons across two box-sets. Season 1, Volume 1 was recalled when it was discovered that the second episode was missing its background musical score, and a corrected version was released in its place. Volume 1 was released on August 9, 2005 and volume 2 on December 6, 2005.\n\nThe list below presents the episodes in their original broadcast order, which is also the order used for the DVD release of the series. However, neither this order nor the original production order of the episodes is the correct chronological story order for the series. Although there is little in the way of major continuing storyline running through \"ThunderCats\", certain creatures reoccur and clips from other episodes are employed. At times, the order used below causes these to be presented out of order. This is only a problem in the second half of season 1, and especially affects the five episodes which comprise the mini-series \"Lion-O's Anointment\", which are split up throughout the latter half of the season, when the stories featured are supposed to occur on consecutive days. Re-airing on the Cartoon Network years later, the series was presented in a slightly altered, more chronological order with \"Lion-O's Anointment\" shown in consecutive order.\n\nNote: ThunderCats Ho! was originally broadcast as a stand-alone TV movie.\n\n\n"}

He also wrote three novels for children.\n\nHe was one of the writers of the 1972 television series \"Pretenders\", and of the 1974 series \"The Carnforth Practice\".\n\nIn 1975, he was commissioned by then-\"Doctor Who\" script editor Robert Holmes to pen a two-part serial entitled \"The Angurth\" for the programme's thirteenth season. This was eventually abandoned, but in 1981, Pringle was encouraged by his agent, former \"Who\" producer Peter Bryant, to submit new material for the show. Pringle delivered two proposals for four-part stories to the production office in August, one called \"The Darkness\" (possibly featuring the Daleks) and another entitled \"War Game\". Script editor Eric Saward finally responded to Pringle, and in 1982, Pringle was asked to put together a scene breakdown for \"War Game\".\n\nBy 1983, War Game had been rechristened \"The Awakening\" (and may also have been called \"Poltergeist\" at some point). Saward and producer John Nathan-Turner had also come to the realisation that the story did not merit four episodes, and so Pringle was asked to condense it down to fit the two-part slot for Season Twenty-One. Pringle concurred and performed the necessary rewrites by April. Saward was still not satisfied with Pringle's modifications; consequently, he elected to heavily rewrite \"The Awakening\". Pringle was not particularly pleased with Saward's rewrites, believing they made the story confusing and rushed. \"The Awakening\" would be his only contribution to \"Doctor Who\". \n\nMuch of Pringle's more recent work has been for the radio including adaptations of \"The Wolves of Willoughby Chase\" and J. B. Priestley's \"The Good Companions\". His 2001 BBC Radio 4 play \"Hymus Paradisi\" about the life of composer Herbert Howells won a Sony Award. That year also saw the publication of his children's novel \"Big George\". This has been followed by two sequels \"Big George and the Seventh Knight\" and \"Big George and the Winter King\". The \"Big George\" books are a retelling of the Saint George and the Dragon myth with a science fiction twist. \n\n"}

The binding typically results in a change of conformational isomerism (conformation) of the target protein. In DNA-ligand binding studies, the ligand can be a small molecule, ion, or protein which binds to the DNA double helix. The relationship between ligand and binding partner is a function of charge, hydrophobicity, and molecular structure. The instance of binding occurs over an infinitesimal range of time and space, so the rate constant is usually a very small number.\n\nBinding occurs by intermolecular forces, such as ionic bonds, hydrogen bonds and Van der Waals forces. The association or docking is actually reversible through dissociation. Measurably irreversible covalent bonding between a ligand and target molecule is atypical in biological systems. In contrast to the definition of ligand in metalorganic and inorganic chemistry, in biochemistry it is ambiguous whether the ligand generally binds at a metal site, as is the case in hemoglobin. In general, the interpretation of ligand is contextual with regards to what sort of binding has been observed. The etymology stems from \"ligare\", which means 'to bind'.\n\nLigand binding to a receptor protein alters the conformation by affecting the three-dimensional shape orientation. The conformation of a receptor protein composes the functional state. Ligands include substrates, inhibitors, activators, signaling lipids, and neurotransmitters. The rate of binding is called affinity, and this measurement typifies a tendency or strength of the effect. Binding affinity is actualized not only by host–guest interactions, but also by solvent effects that can play a dominant, steric role which drives non-covalent binding in solution. The solvent provides a chemical environment for the ligand and receptor to adapt, and thus accept or reject each other as partners.\n\nRadioligands are radioisotope labeled compounds used in vivo as tracers in PET studies and for in vitro binding studies.\n\nThe interaction of ligands with their binding sites can be characterized in terms of a binding affinity. In general, high-affinity ligand binding results from greater attractive forces between the ligand and its receptor while low-affinity ligand binding involves less attractive force. In general, high-affinity binding results in a higher occupancy of the receptor by its ligand than is the case for low-affinity binding; the residence time (lifetime of the receptor-ligand complex) does not correlate. High-affinity binding of ligands to receptors is often physiologically important when some of the binding energy can be used to cause a conformational change in the receptor, resulting in altered behavior for example of an associated ion channel or enzyme.\n\nA ligand that can bind to and alter the function of the receptor that triggers a physiological response is called an receptor agonist. Ligands that bind to a receptor but fail to activate the physiological response are receptor antagonists.\nAgonist binding to a receptor can be characterized both in terms of how much physiological response can be triggered (that is, the efficacy) and in terms of the concentration of the agonist that is required to produce the physiological response (often measured as EC, the concentration required to produced the half-maximal response). High-affinity ligand binding implies that a relatively low concentration of a ligand is adequate to maximally occupy a ligand-binding site and trigger a physiological response. Receptor affinity is measured by an inhibition constant or K value, the concentration required to occupy 50% of the receptor. Ligand affinities are most often measured indirectly as an IC value from a competition binding experiment where the concentration of a ligand required to displace 50% of a fixed concentration of reference ligand is determined. The K value can be estimated from IC through the Cheng Prusoff equation. Ligand affinities can also be measured directly as a dissociation constant (K) using methods such as fluorescence quenching, isothermal titration calorimetry or surface plasmon resonance. \n\nLow-affinity binding (high K level) implies that a relatively high concentration of a ligand is required before the binding site is maximally occupied and the maximum physiological response to the ligand is achieved. In the example shown to the right, two different ligands bind to the same receptor binding site. Only one of the agonists shown can maximally stimulate the receptor and, thus, can be defined as a \"full agonist\". An agonist that can only partially activate the physiological response is called a \"partial agonist\". In this example, the concentration at which the full agonist (red curve) can half-maximally activate the receptor is about 5 x 10 Molar (nM = nanomolar).\n\nBinding affinity is most commonly determined using a radiolabeled ligand, known as a tagged ligand. \"Homologous competitive binding experiments\" involve binding competition between a tagged ligand and an untagged ligand.\nReal-time based methods, which are often label-free, such as surface plasmon resonance, dual-polarization interferometry and multi-parametric surface plasmon resonance (MP-SPR) can not only quantify the affinity from concentration based assays; but also from the kinetics of association and dissociation, and in the later cases, the conformational change induced upon binding. MP-SPR also enables measurements in high saline dissociation buffers thanks to a unique optical setup. Microscale thermophoresis (MST), an immobilization-free method was developed. This method allows the determination of the binding affinity without any limitation to the ligand's molecular weight.\n\nFor the use of statistical mechanics in a quantitative study of the\nligand-receptor binding affinity, see the comprehensive article\non the configurational partition function.\n\nBinding affinity data alone does not determine the overall potency of a drug. Potency is a result of the complex interplay of both the binding affinity and the ligand efficacy. Ligand efficacy refers to the ability of the ligand to produce a biological response upon binding to the target receptor and the quantitative magnitude of this response. This response may be as an agonist, antagonist, or inverse agonist, depending on the physiological response produced.\n\nSelective ligands have a tendency to bind to very limited kinds of receptor, whereas non-selective ligands bind to several types of receptors. This plays an important role in pharmacology, where drugs that are non-selective tend to have more adverse effects, because they bind to several other receptors in addition to the one generating the desired effect.\n\nFor hydrophobic ligands (e.g. PIP2) in complex with a hydrophobic protein (e.g. lipid-gated ion channels) determining the affinity is complicated by non-specific hydrophobic interactions. Non-specific hydrophobic interactions can be overcome when the affinity of the ligand is high. For example, PIP2 binds with high affinity to PIP2 gated ion channels. \n\nBivalent ligands consist of two drug-like molecules (pharmacophores or ligands) connected by an inert linker. There are various kinds of bivalent ligands and are often classified based on what the pharmacophores target. Homobivalent ligands target two of the same receptor types. Heterobivalent ligands target two different receptor types. Bitopic ligands target an orthosteric binding sites and allosteric binding sites on the same receptor.\n\nIn scientific research, bivalent ligands have been used to study receptor dimers and to investigate their properties. This class of ligands was pioneered by Philip S. Portoghese and coworkers while studying the opioid receptor system. Bivalent ligands were also reported early on by Micheal Conn and coworkers for the gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor. Since these early reports, there have been many bivalent ligands reported for various G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) systems including cannabinoid, serotonin, oxytocin, and melanocortin receptor systems, and for GPCR-LIC systems (D2 and nACh receptors).\n\nBivalent ligands usually tend to be larger than their monovalent counterparts, and therefore, not 'drug-like.' (See Lipinski's rule of five.) Many believe this limits their applicability in clinical settings. In spite of these beliefs, there have been many ligands that have reported successful pre-clinical animal studies. Given that some bivalent ligands can have many advantages compared to their monovalent counterparts (such as tissue selectivity, increased binding affinity, and increased potency or efficacy), bivalents may offer some clinical advantages as well.\n\nLigands of proteins can be characterized also by the number of protein chains they bind. “Monodesmic” ligands (μόνος: single, δεσμός: binding) are ligands that bind a single protein chain, while \"polydesmic” ligands (πολοί: many) are frequent in protein complexes, and are ligands that bind more than one protein chain, typically in or near protein interfaces. Recent research shows that the type of ligands and binding site structure has profound consequences for the evolution, function, allostery and folding of protein compexes.\n\nA privileged scaffold is a molecular framework or chemical moiety that is statistically recurrent among known drugs or among a specific array of biologically active compounds. These privileged elements can be used as a basis for designing new active biological compounds or compound libraries.\n\nMain methods to study protein–ligand interactions are principal hydrodynamic and calorimetric techniques, and principal spectroscopic and structural methods such as\n\nOther techniques include:\nfluorescence intensity,\nbimolecular fluorescence complementation,\nFRET (fluorescent resonance energy transfer) / FRET quenching\nsurface plasmon resonance,\nbio-layer interferometry,\nCoimmunopreciptation\nindirect ELISA,\nequilibrium dialysis,\ngel electrophoresis,\nfar western blot,\nfluorescence polarization anisotropy,\nelectron paramagnetic resonance,\nmicroscale thermophoresis\n\nThe dramatically increased computing power of supercomputers and personal computers has made it possible to study protein–ligand interactions also by means of computational chemistry. For example, a worldwide grid of well over a million ordinary PCs was harnessed for cancer research in the project grid.org, which ended in April 2007. Grid.org has been succeeded by similar projects such as World Community Grid, Human Proteome Folding Project, Compute Against Cancer and Folding@Home.\n\n\n"}

Haroon died on 8 July 1999, and the remaining brother has continued Joi alone.\n\nJoi were brothers Farook (born 24 October 1968) and Haroon Shamsher (14 November 1965 – 8 July 1999), born in Bradford, West Yorkshire, England and brought up in the East End of London to a Bangladeshi father and an Indian mother. Their passion for music developed at a young age as their father was a professional flautist who had a shop in Brick Lane selling saris and musical instruments he imported from India. He also had Hindi, Indian classical and traditional Bengali music records, and ran a traditional music shop. Their father would organise sessions and record with Baul artists, and sell the tapes.\n\nFarook and Haroon grew up watching Indian musicians record in a makeshift studio in their father's retail store. They grew up listening to people such as Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, and were influenced by reggae, hip hop and soul. They fused Indian and Pakistani rhythms with modern dance grooves.\n\nJoi was formed, originally working under the banners 'League Of Joi Bangla Youth Organisation' and 'Joi Bangla', a collective set up in 1983 to promote Bengali culture to children in their local East London area. They started out in the context of community work and events and subsequently became active members of a growing Asian dance scene in England. Out of this a Bengali youth movement came the Joi Bangla sound system formed by Farook and Haroon Shamsher, fusing Asian influences with Western beats and fusing the sounds of traditional Bengali music with hip hop and contemporary dance styles. They spun records in local youth clubs around the Brick Lane area of London.\n\nIn 1983, they mixed these elements together and began DJing at clubs as the Joi Bangla Sound System, before becoming the more dance-oriented Joi six years later, bolstered by Arts Council funding and aiming to promote Bengali youth culture. After 10 years as club DJs, the pair began recording their own material in their father's studio. In July 1999, Farook told \"The Independent\", \"We're about politics, race, religion, and music all-in-one\".\n\nIn 1988, Joi's white label single \"Taj Ma House\" was released and they began introducing their own material into Joi Bangla sets. In 1992, they released their debut single \"Desert Storm, which was named single of the week in \"NME\". In 1993, they set up the Joi club night in London. In 1994, they appointed Charles Cosh as their manager.\n\nIn 1996, they released the \"Bangladesh EP\" on Nation Records and performed at that year's World of Music, Arts and Dance (WOMAD) festival, where they caught the attention of Peter Gabriel and subsequently signed to his Real World label the following year. They remixed \"Sweet Pain\", a track by Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, for inclusion on the \"Star Rise\" tribute album in 1997. They released the limited-edition single \"Fingers\" in December 1998. A Justin Robertson remix was popular on the club scene and paved the way for the follow-up, \"Asian Vibes\", issued in 1999. The debut album \"One and One Is One\" was released in March 1999.\n\nOn 8 July 1999, Haroon died unexpectedly of a heart-attack at the age of 34. He succumbed to heart failure after a week-long illness and suffered a heart attack during a hospital examination. Despite being ill, he had performed the night before. Two months before his death, Haroon visited Bangladesh for a month and made a series of field recordings which Farook used as the basis for \"We Are Three\", which was released in October 2001.\n\nIn January 2007, Joi's third album \"Without Zero\" was released.\n\nIn between working in the studio, Joi had been taking their sound system to clubs around London, as well as supporting Spiritualised on their '98 British tour. Their sound system helped promote their fusion ethic regardless of trends within the music industry. Over the years the duo worked with various other artists and DJs, including Asian Dub Foundation, Athletico, Mixmaster Morris, Plaid and Spring Heel Jack. The Joi Sound System have played at clubs and gigs, including The End, The Complex, Return To The Source, and the Ministry of Sound. By 1998, Joi had performed at over 1,500 gigs as a sound system.\n\nThey developed a live act and put on a full live show with the addition of the vocalist Susheela Raman, the guitarist Vik Sharma and the percussionist Bongo Paul. They used traditional instruments like tabla, sitar and flute on top of driving techno rhythms. They performed at Tribal Gathering, Whirl-Y-Gig, World of Music, Arts and Dance, Big Chill, Wembley Conference Centre, Swaraj as well as others around Europe taking them as far afield as Bucharest, Rome, Madrid and Geneva. They also performed live radio sessions with Andy Kershaw (BBC Radio 1), XFM and Greater London Radio.\n\nJoi is co-managed by Charles Cosh and Ben Batson of London-based Molosha Management Ltd. Sam Kirby of New York-based Evolution Talent Agency handles its bookings.\n\nOn 15 June 2017, the British Plaque Trust honoured Haroon Shamsher by unveiling a Blue Plaque in Brick Lane, where he lived with his family.\n\n\n"}

The army led by King Vukašin and his son Prince Marko approached Skadar in June 1371, but when they were informed about a large Ottoman army advancing from the east they headed east to prepare for the Battle of Maritsa.\n\nThe Christian army numbered 20,000–70,000 men. Most sources agree on the higher number. Despot Uglješa wanted to make a surprise attack on the Ottomans in their capital city, Edirne, while Murad I was in Asia Minor. The Ottoman army was much smaller, Byzantine Greek scholar Laonikos Chalkokondyles and other sources give the number of 800 men, but due to superior tactics, by conducting a night raid on the Christian camp, Şâhin Paşa was able to defeat the Christian army and kill King Vukašin and despot Uglješa. Thousands of Christians were killed, and thousands drowned in the Maritsa river when they tried to flee. After the battle, the Maritsa ran scarlet with blood.\n\nParts of Macedonia and Thrace fell under Ottoman power after this battle. The battle was a part of the Ottoman campaign to conquer the Balkans and was preceded by the Ottoman capturing of Sozopol in modern Bulgaria and succeeded by the capture of the cities of Drama, Kavála, and Serrai in modern Greece. The battle preceded the later 1389 Battle of Kosovo, and was one of many in the Serbian–Turkish wars.\n\n\n"}

He has also collaborated with Image Comics co-founder Todd McFarlane on the series \"Haunt\". He is one of the five partners of Image Comics, and the only one of the five who was not one of its co-founders.\n\nRobert Kirkman was born November 30, 1978, in Lexington, Kentucky, and was raised in Cynthiana, Kentucky.\n\nRobert Kirkman's first comic book work was the 2000 superhero parody \"Battle Pope\", which he co-created with artist Tony Moore, self-published under the Funk-O-Tron label, and was adapted into a season of 8 animated webisodes that appeared on Spike TV's website in 2008. Later, while pitching a new series, \"Science Dog\", Kirkman and artist Cory Walker were hired to do a SuperPatriot miniseries for Image Comics. While working on that book, Kirkman and E. J. Su created the 2002 Image series \"Tech Jacket\", which ran six issues, and the one-shot title, \"Cloudfall\".\n\nIn 2003, Kirkman and Walker created \"Invincible\" for Image's new superhero line. The story surrounded the adolescent son of the world's most powerful superhero, who develops powers and starts his own superhero career. Walker later failed to meet the monthly title's deadlines and was replaced by Ryan Ottley. In 2005, Paramount Pictures announced it had bought the rights to produce an \"Invincible\" feature film, and hired Kirkman to write the screenplay.\n\nShortly after the launch of \"Invincible\", Kirkman and Moore began \"The Walking Dead\" (2003). Kirkman said in 2012 that Image had balked at publishing a comics series featuring what it felt was simply another zombie story, prompting him to say the zombies were part of an alien plot—a notion he had no intention of using except as a means of selling the project. Artist Charlie Adlard replaced Tony Moore with issue #7. Moore continued to draw covers until issue 24 as well as the first four volumes of the trade paperbacks for the series.\nKirkman was first hired by Marvel Comics to pen a revival of the 1990s \"Sleepwalker\" series, but it was canceled before being published; the contents of its first issue were included in \"Epic Anthology\" No. 1 (2004). He soon became a mainstay at Marvel, writing the \"Avengers Disassembled\" issues of \"Captain America\" vol. 4, 2004's \"Marvel Knights 2099\" one-shots event, \"Jubilee\" #1–6 and \"Fantastic Four: Foes\" #1–6, a two-year run on \"Ultimate X-Men\" and the entire \"Marvel Team-Up\" vol. 3 and the \"Irredeemable Ant-Man\" miniseries.\n\nAt Image, Kirkman and artist Jason Howard created the ongoing series \"The Astounding Wolf-Man\", launching it on May 5, 2007, as part of Free Comic Book Day. Kirkman edited the monthly series \"Brit\", based on the character he created for the series of one-shots, illustrated by Moore and Cliff Rathburn. It ran 12 issues.\n\nKirkman announced in 2007 that he and artist Rob Liefeld would team on a revival of \"Killraven\" for Marvel Comics. Kirkman that year also said he and Todd McFarlane would collaborate on \"Haunt\" for Image Comics.\n\nIn late July 2008, Kirkman was made a partner at Image Comics, thereby ending his freelance association with Marvel. Nonetheless, later in 2009, he and Walker produced the five-issue miniseries \"The Destroyer\" vol. 4 for Marvel's MAX imprint.\n\nIn 2009, Kirkman and Marc Silvestri took over the 2009–2010 Pilot Season for Top Cow Comics. The 2009/2010 Pilot Season contains a series of five one-shot pilot comics that readers will be able to vote on which becomes an ongoing series. Each series is co-created by Silvestri who also provides cover art.\n\nIn 2010, he also began producing the television adaption of his comic book series \"The Walking Dead\", the pilot of which was directed by Frank Darabont. Kirkman has written or co-written seven episodes of the series. Kirkman also created and serves as an executive producer on the show's companion series, \"Fear the Walking Dead\".\n\nIn July 2010, Kirkman announced he would launch and run a new Image Comics imprint called Skybound Entertainment.\n\nOn February 9, 2012, Tony Moore filed a lawsuit alleging that Kirkman, in 2005, had deceitfully engineered him into surrendering his rights to \"The Walking Dead\" comic book and eventual TV series in exchange for payments that never materialized. Kirkman said in a statement the following day that he and Moore \"each had legal representation seven years ago and now he is violating the same contract he initiated and approved and he wants to misrepresent the fees he was paid and continues to be paid for the work he was hired to do.\" Kirkman in turn sued Moore. On September 24, 2012, the two released a joint statement saying they had reached a settlement \"to everyone's mutual satisfaction.\"\n\nKirkman made an appearance in a 2012 episode of Adult Swim's \"Robot Chicken\" as himself where he tries to tell The Nerd and Daniel a hint, but gets eaten by the zombies.\n\nIn November 2013, Cinemax purchased a TV pilot based on Kirkman and artist Paul Azaceta's then-upcoming six-issue exorcism comics miniseries, \"Outcast\". The first issue of the comic was released in June 2014 to positive reviews.\n\nKirkman was a producer of the science fiction thriller \"Air\", which starred \"The Walking Dead\"s Norman Reedus, and Djimon Hounsou. The movie was released in 2015. It was the first feature film to be produced by Skybound Entertainment.\n\nKirkman's latest television project known as \"Five Year\" will be a joint venture between Skybound and Viki.com. It will be filmed for TV in Korea and available everywhere on Viki.com. The pre-apocalyptic story centres on a family dealing with an impending meteor strike. It was picked up for an initial 1 season run of 16 episodes with a plan for 5 seasons. Filming begins in late 2016.\n\nAs of November 7, 2016, Kirkman's production company Skybound Entertainment was set to produce a remake of the film \"An American Werewolf in London\".

If no improvement is seen after 3 months, stopping the medication is reasonable. It may also be used to prevent stroke. It is taken by mouth.\nCommon side effects include headache, diarrhea, dizziness, and cough. Serious side effects may include decreased survival in those with heart failure, low platelets, and low white blood cells. Cilostazol is a phosphodiesterase 3 inhibitor which works by inhibiting platelet aggregation and dilating arteries.\nCilostazol was approved for medical use in the United States in 1999. It is available as a generic medication. A month supply in the United Kingdom costs the NHS about 5 £ as of 2019. In the United States the wholesale cost of this amount is about US$6.20. In 2016 it was the 264th most prescribed medication in the United States with more than a million prescriptions.\n\nCilostazol is approved for the treatment of intermittent claudication in the United States. Such use however is not recommended in the United Kingdom.\n\nCilostazol is also used for secondary stroke prevention.\n\nCilostazol is dangerous for people with severe heart failure. Cilostazol has been studied in people without heart failure, without evidence of harm, but much more data would be needed to determine no risk exists. Although cilostazol would not be approvable for a trivial condition the Cardio-Renal Advisory Committee and FDA concluded that fully informed patients and physicians should be able to choose to use it to treat intermittent claudication. Patient and physician labeling will describe the basis for concern and the incomplete information available.\n\nPossible side effects of cilostazol use include headache (the most common), diarrhea, severe heat intolerance, abnormal stools, increased heart rate, and palpitations.\n\nCilostazol is metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP2C19, two isoenzymes of the cytochrome P450 system. Drugs that inhibit CYP3A4, such as itraconazole, erythromycin, ketoconazole, and diltiazem, are known to interact with cilostazol. The proton pump inhibitor omeprazole, an inhibitor of CYP2C19, increases exposure to the active metabolite of cilostazol.\n\nA single report has been made of grapefruit juice possibly increasing the effects of cilostazol; some drug information sources list this as a possible interaction. The FDA-approved labeling of cilostazol notes that grapefruit juice (which is a CYP3A4 inhibitor) increases the drug's maximum concentration by around 50%.\n\nCilostazol is a selective inhibitor of phosphodiesterase type 3 (PDE) with therapeutic focus on increasing cAMP. An increase in cAMP results in an increase in the active form of protein kinase A (PKA), which is directly related with an inhibition in platelet aggregation. PKA also prevents the activation of an enzyme (myosin light-chain kinase) that is important in the contraction of smooth muscle cells, thereby exerting its vasodilatory effect.\n"}

He was proclaimed Defensive Player of the Year for the Impact three times in 2002, 2003 and 2006, and won the Giuseppe-Saputo Trophy in 2004, awarded to the most valuable player of the Impact. Gervais was also named Defender of the Year in the USL First Division in 2003, 2004 and 2006, becoming the first player in the league to win that award in three consecutive years. Gervais was also picked on the USL First Division All-League Team for six straight years, from 2002 to 2007.\n\nOn January 6, 2009 Gervais announced his retirement from soccer, after a nine-year career in the United Soccer Leagues First Division. On April 15, 2009 during the Montreal Impact's pre-season banquet the club honoured Gervais by recognizing him as a Team Builder and was made an ambassador to the club. Gervais had a stint in the National Professional Soccer League with the short lived expansion franchise the Toronto ThunderHawks during the 2000–2001 winter indoor season.

The club plays its home games in the Covebo Stadion - De Koel stadium, which is named after one of the club's sponsors Covebo Uitzendgroep. VVV's home colours are yellow and black, the former being the dominant shirt colour.\n\nVVV returned to the Eredivisie, the highest league in the Netherlands, by defeating RKC Waalwijk (3-0) in the promotion/relegation play-offs in the 2006–07 season. After one season in the Eredivisie, VVV-Venlo were relegated back to the Eerste Divisie. After a single season, VVV-Venlo won the 2008–09 Eerste Divisie title and returned to the Eredivisie.\n\nIn the 2009–10 season, the team booked its best league result since 1988 after finishing 12th in the Eredivisie. Another remarkable event was the transfer of star player Keisuke Honda to CSKA Moscow. They also signed toddler Baerke van der Meij on a symbolic ten-year contract, after a video featuring him scoring a hat trick into a toy box became popular. Honda was replaced by Gonzalo and the club signed Japanese player Maya Yoshida. The departure of Honda turned out to be a key point in the club's season. In the second half of the season, the team was not able to win matches and barely escaped from relegation.\n\nAt the end of the season, key players Ruben Schaken and Adil Auassar both signed with Feyenoord on a free transfer. Gonzalo returned to his employer Groningen, while Sandro Calabro signed with Swiss side St. Gallen. The club contracted Ruud Boymans and the Nigerian Ahmed Musa to strengthen the squad for the 2010-11 season. They avoided relegation, but it was a harsh season in which Jan van Dijk was fired and former international Patrick Paauwe terminated his contract after losing the competition from his competitors.\n\nBelgian manager Glen De Boeck was signed for the next season, but failed to improve the results. As a result of that, he resigned in December 2011. Ton Lokhoff was recruited as the new manager and succeeded in avoiding relegation by winning the post-season play-offs. However, in the 2012–13 season, the club was relegated after losing the promotion/relegation play-offs against Go Ahead Eagles. The club finished fifth in its first Eerste Divisie season since its promotion in 2009. But again, the club bounced back and returned to the Eredivisie in 2017, after clinching promotion by defeating RKC Waalwijk.\n\nSince Keisuke Honda transferred from Nagoya Grampus in 2008, a slew of Japanese players has played at VVV-Venlo, including Maya Yoshida, Robert Cullen and Yuki Otsu. Sef Vergoossen, a legendary manager of the club, and Japanese agent Tetsuro Kiyooka were a bridge between the Japanese players and the club.\n\nVVV-Venlo currently play at De Koel in Venlo. The stadium holds 8,000 people and was built in 1972.

It was also fitted to aerobatics. The construction of the new aircraft was very similar to the RWD 8, but almost all parts were newly designed. Main visual difference were twin struts supporting wings, instead of V-struts, and two-part wing instead of three-part, without central section. The works started in 1936, and the main designer was Bronisław Żurakowski of the RWD bureau. The first prototype (registration SP-BMX) was flown in August 1937 in Warsaw. After state trials in 1937, it was accepted for production, and in 1938 a short series of RWD 17 was produced (23 serial RWD 17 were in the Polish registry).\n\nIn early 1938, a floatplane variant RWD 17W was designed, differing among others in a more powerful Bramo Sh 14a radial engine. It had interchangeable floats or land undercarriage. When on floats, a bigger tail-fin, extending downwards was mounted. The prototype was flown with a land undercarriage in June 1938, then tested on floats. Next, 5 RWD 17Ws were ordered for the Polish Naval Aviation Squadron (\"MDLot\") at Puck, for use as trainers, built in 1939.\n\nIn early 1939 a new wing for the RWD 17 was developed, slightly longer, with thinner profile and narrowing wingtips. It gave better aerobatics capability. Because of problems with its counterpart PWS-35, the Polish Air Force got interested in the modified RWD 17 as a successor of the PWS-26 intermediate trainer; plans to order 50-120 aircraft, with a likely designation RWD 17bis, were not actioned due to the outbreak war.\n\nRWD 17s were flown by the Polish Aero Club and an aviation school in Świdnik before World War II. During the Invasion of Poland in September 1939, eight of them, including the prototype, were evacuated to Romania. Reportedly, 2 more were evacuated to Latvia. One RWD 17, used by the 56th Observation Escadre as a liaison aircraft, crashed on 12 September 1939.\n\nApart from the prototype RWD 17W, carrying civilian registration SP-BPB, 5 other RWD 17W floatplanes were produced. Two were commissioned with the Polish Navy just before the outbreak of the war, but they did not get to the Polish Naval Aviation Squadron. The prototype was kept camouflaged in a forest on Hel Peninsula during its siege. On 30 September the aircraft attempted to evacuate to Sweden, however due to engine trouble it crashed in the sea near the peninsula, (the crew was saved). It was the last flight of a Polish aircraft during the Polish September Campaign. Three other RWD 17W, being in a factory in Warsaw, with land undercarriage, were evacuated to Romania (nos. 311, 312, 314), while the remaining two (nos. 313 and 315) were used as liaison aircraft near Warsaw and destroyed thereafter.\n\nIn Romania RWD 17s were used until the late 1940s. None returned to Poland after the war, and none have survived.\n\nMixed construction braced high-wing (parasol wing) monoplane, conventional in layout, single-engine, with open cockpits. The fuselage was made of a steel frame (Cr-Mo), covered with canvas on a wooden frame. Swept rectangular two-part wing, of wooden construction, covered with canvas and plywood in front, two-spar. The wing was supported by a central pyramid and twin struts. Wooden construction braced empennage, covered with plywood (stabilizers) and canvas (rudder and elevators).

It is the top-selling album in the Byrds' catalogue and reached number 6 on the \"Billboard\" Top LPs chart, but failed to chart in the UK.\n\nThe album provides a summary of the Byrds' history during Gene Clark and David Crosby's tenure with the band and also functions as a survey of the group's hit singles from 1965 to 1967, a period when the band had its greatest amount of success on the singles chart. Most of the band's U.S. A-sides from this period are included on the album, along with three of their more important album tracks: \"I'll Feel a Whole Lot Better\", \"The Bells of Rhymney\", and \"Chimes of Freedom\". The three U.S. singles from this period that are not included on the album are \"Set You Free This Time\", \"Have You Seen Her Face\" and \"Lady Friend\" (although these songs have been included as bonus tracks on various CD reissues of the album). All of the songs included on the original \"Greatest Hits\" album can also be found on the band's first four albums, \"Mr. Tambourine Man\", \"Turn! Turn! Turn!\", \"Fifth Dimension\" and \"Younger Than Yesterday\".\n\nThe eight tracks on \"The Byrds' Greatest Hits\" that had been singles peaked at the following positions on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100: \"5D (Fifth Dimension)\" number 44; \"All I Really Want to Do\" number 40; \"Mr. Spaceman\" number 36; \"My Back Pages\" number 30; \"So You Want to Be a Rock 'n' Roll Star\" number 29; \"Eight Miles High\" number 14; \"Turn! Turn! Turn!\" number 1; and \"Mr. Tambourine Man\" number 1. In addition, four of the singles included on the album had charted in the United Kingdom, peaking at the following positions on the UK Singles Chart: \"Turn! Turn! Turn!\" number 26; \"Eight Miles High\" number 24; \"All I Really Want to Do\" number 4; and \"Mr. Tambourine Man\" number 1.\n\nAuthor Johnny Rogan has stated that, in particular, \"Eight Miles High\", \"Turn! Turn! Turn!\", and \"Mr. Tambourine Man\" were widely influential during the 1960s, a time when singles, at least in pop music, were as important in their own right as albums, and generally more so. Rogan further opined that \"Turn! Turn! Turn!\" summed up the decade's counter-cultural values as much as \"Blowin' in the Wind\", \"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\" or \"All You Need Is Love\", while \"Mr. Tambourine Man\" and \"Eight Miles High\" helped to introduce the subgenres of folk rock and psychedelic rock respectively into the popular music of the day.\n\n\"The Byrds' Greatest Hits\" was released on August 7, 1967 in the United States (catalogue item CL 2716 in mono, CS 9516 in stereo) and October 20, 1967 in the United Kingdom (catalogue item BPG 63107 in mono, SBPG 63107 in stereo). The album was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America within a year of its release, eventually being certified platinum on November 21, 1986. \n\nThe album was first issued on CD by Columbia Records in 1985 and was later re-released in a remastered form in 1991 with alternative cover artwork. In the UK and Europe, this 1991 edition of the album was titled \"Greatest Hits: 18 Classics Remastered\" and included an additional seven bonus tracks taken from the Byrds' post \"Younger Than Yesterday\" career (a period not covered by the original album). The album was remastered again at 20-bit resolution as part of the Columbia/Legacy Byrds series and reissued in an expanded and remixed form on March 30, 1999. The three bonus tracks on the 1999 reissue included two of the remaining singles from the Byrds' 1965–1967 career, plus the number 63 charting B-side, \"It Won't Be Wrong\". The album was reissued again in the SACD format on January 30, 2001, with the same expanded track listing as on the 20-bit remaster.\n\nOn March 16, 2009 Sony Music released a new Byrds compilation titled \"Greatest Hits\" as part of their \"Steel Box Collection\" series. This compilation album is not the same as the original \"The Byrds' Greatest Hits\" album, although it does have four of the same tracks in common.\n\nUpon release, \"The Byrds' Greatest Hits\" was met with positive reviews. Paul Williams enthusiastically waxed lyrical about the album in a review published in \"Crawdaddy!\" magazine: \"Any greatest hits album is insignificant. By definition it contains nothing unfamiliar; and yet this very fact offers great potential beauty, for a well-made greatest hits LP might then unleash the emotion of familiarity in an artistic context. The Byrds have achieved that goal: always masters of the form, they have now taken the concept of a great hits anthology and created from it an essay into rediscovery.\" \"WCFL Beat\" magazine was also complimentary about the album, noting that, during the mid-1960s British Invasion, the Byrds were the only American band to \"help to revolutionize the pop scene and to pave the way for the so-called psychedelic music of today.\" In the UK, \"Record Mirror\" gave the album a top rating of 4 stars, while commenting \"This is a chronological collection of their singles and is really something. Their sound has progressed from the Dylanesque to the sound which is one of the best in the pop world.\" A November 1967 review of the album in \"Beat Instrumental\" declared \"This is probably the best collection LP to come out of the states this year, and has songs that won't date for years to come.\"\n\nIn recent years, Stephen Thomas Erlewine, in his review for the AllMusic website, has described the album as \"pretty close to a definitive single-disc summary of the Byrds' prime.\" Sarah Zupko also praised the album in her PopMatters review, noting: \"The Byrds perfectly captured the mood of their time.\" In his review of the SACD version of the album for the Music Tap website, Robert Olsen described the album as \"a compilation album featuring some of the better known recordings from the first 4 albums.\" Olsen went on to note that \"The first album is over-represented, and there's an unwholesome emphasis on the Dylan cuts. Nevertheless, at the time the album was stunning in its breadth and provided the next generation with a good sample of the sound and direction of the group.\"\n\nThe album was included in Robert Christgau's \"Basic Record Library\" of 1950s and 1960s recordings, published in \"\" (1981). In 2003, the album was ranked at number 178 on \"Rolling Stone\" magazine's list of \"The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time\", although it was dropped when the list when was updated in 2012.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdapted from \"So You Want To Be A Rock 'n' Roll Star: The Byrds Day-By-Day (1965–1973)\", \"The Byrds: Timeless Flight Revisited\", various compact disc liner notes, and other online sources:\n\nCredits refer only to the original 11 track album. \n\nThe Byrds\n\nAdditional personnel\n"}

It generates revenues of approximately $33.5 billion and employs approximately 33,400 people. Exelon is the largest electric parent company in the United States by revenue, the largest regulated utility in the United States with approximately 10 million customers, and also the largest operator of nuclear power plants in the United States. It was created in October 2000 by the merger of PECO Energy Company of Philadelphia and Unicom Corp of Chicago, which owned Commonwealth Edison. Exelon is incorporated in Illinois. \n\nExelon operates regulated utilities in Illinois, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, New Jersey, and Washington, DC. In October 2009, Exelon had full or majority ownership of 23 nuclear reactors in 14 nuclear power plants. Exelon has operations and business activities in 48 states, the District of Columbia and Canada, and is the largest competitive U.S. power generator with approximately 35,500 megawatts of owned capacity. Exelon merged with Constellation Energy Group in March 2012 and acquired Pepco Holdings in March 2016. Exelon consists of eight main operating subsidiaries with Exelon Generation, a deregulated energy generator, Constellation Energy Group, a deregulated competitive energy supplier, and six regulated utilities, Commonwealth Edison (Illinois), PECO Energy Company (Pennsylvania), Baltimore Gas and Electric (Maryland), Delmarva Power & Light (Delaware and Maryland), Atlantic City Electric (New Jersey), and Potomac Electric Power Company (Washington, DC and Maryland).\n\nExelon Corporation was created as the result of a merger between PECO Energy Company and the Unicom Corporation in October 2000. Unicom was based in Chicago and the city became the home of the new entity. The merger was overseen by the CEO of Unicom, John Rowe who joined the corporation in 1998 and went on to lead the newly-formed Exelon until 2012, becoming the nation's longest-serving utility executive.\n\nUnder Rowe, Exelon explored a number of mergers and acquisitions. On June 30, 2005, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approved the merger of Exelon and Public Service Enterprise Group Inc., a New Jersey utility. Under this merger, Exelon would have become the largest utility in the United States. The two companies later broke off the agreement due to pressure put on the NJ Board of Public Utilities by public interest groups, including New Jersey Citizen Action. The merger sat pending in front of the NJBPU for nineteen months before Exelon concluded that they were fighting a losing battle. On April 28, 2011, Exelon announced a merger with Constellation Energy for $7.9 billion with the combined company owning more than 34 gigawatts of power generation (55 percent nuclear, 24 percent natural gas, 8 percent renewable including hydro, 7 percent oil and 6 percent coal). The merger was completed on March 12, 2012.\n\nIn 2012, when announcing the cancellation of new nuclear construction for Victoria County Station, Texas, Exelon stated that economic and market conditions, especially low natural gas prices, made the \"construction of new merchant nuclear power plants in competitive markets uneconomical now and for the foreseeable future\".\n\nIn 2008, Christopher Crane was named CEO following Rowe's retirement and the completion of the merger with Constellation Energy. Exelon announced the proposed purchase of Pepco Holdings, Inc on April 30, 2014, for $6.8 billion in an all-cash transaction. The merger was rejected by the District of Columbia Public Service Commission in August 2015, though it was approved by other federal and state regulators. The companies appealed the decision. On March 23, 2016, the merger was approved by the Washington DC Public Service Commission, under a revised set of terms. The merger was completed later that day making Exelon the largest regulated utility in the United States by customer count and total revenue.\n\nPECO Energy, one of Exelon's local power companies, has been involved in two controversies with activists. In the 1970s, activists delayed the opening of nuclear power plants. In 2015, Earth Quaker Action Team began a campaign to pressure PECO to expand the solar power it purchases, and to purchase it locally to create jobs.\n\nExelon's merger with Pepco faced stiff opposition from community groups and the D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser.\n\nFor the fiscal year 2017, Exelon reported earnings of US$3.770 billion, with an annual revenue of US$33.531 billion, an increase of 6.9% over the previous fiscal cycle. Exelon's shares traded at over $35 per share, and its market capitalization was valued at over US$42.1 billion in October 2018. Exelon ranked No. 92 in the 2018 Fortune 500 list of the largest United States corporations by total revenue.\n\nExelon Generation is the corporation's energy provider. It has two primary business units, Exelon Nuclear and Exelon Power.\n\nExelon is a leading nuclear power plant operator in the United States with over 19,000 megawatts through Exelon Nuclear Partners, a division of Exelon Generation.\n\nIn December 2016, the Illinois legislature voted to pass legislation that would ensure continued operations of both the Quad Cities and Clinton nuclear power plants. The two plants create approximately 23 percent of emission-free electricity in Illinois. Passage of the bill and keeping the plants open is expected to preserve around $1.2 billion in annual economic activity within the state. In August 2016, Exelon agreed to purchase the James A. Fitzpatrick Nuclear Power Plant from Entergy Corporation. Exelon formally acquired ownership and operation of James A.

Sources include natural gas, hydroelectric, wind, solar, landfill gas and oil.\n\nFossil fuel plants include:\n\n\nExelon's two hydroelectric plants generate 1,600 MW of energy.\n\n\nExelon owns or has interest in three solar power facilities which generate 260 MW of energy.\n\n\nExelon owns or operates two landfill gas power plants.\n\n\nExelon has 47 wind projects in ten states, totaling nearly 1,500 megawatts (MW). In 2010 Exelon purchased John Deere Renewables for $860 million adding 735 MW to Exelon's capacity.\n\nExelon PowerLabs is a wholly owned subsidiary of Exelon Corporation. Since 1911, PowerLabs has transformed over the years from being a support to the power industry, to becoming the primary calibrations and testing laboratory for Exelon. It has four individual labs strategically located from the upper-Midwest to the Northeast, enabling experienced staff in engineering, metrology, and nuclear power generation to support the urgent demands of our nation’s nuclear facilities, power grids, and critical supply chains.\n\nAs an approved nuclear supplier, its Quality Program satisfies the requirements in 10 CFR 50; Appendix B, 10 CFR 21, NQA-1, and ANSI N45.2. It is routinely audited by the Nuclear Procurement Issues Committee (NUPIC) and the Nuclear Industry Assessment Committee (NIAC) — whose results are the basis for evaluation as a supplier to the nuclear industry.\n\nDue to the breadth of its experience in the nuclear industry, it has amassed an extensive inventory of lab equipment to perform a full- spectrum of calibration, testing, and analysis services. We also maintain A2LA Accreditation, assuring technical competence as a laboratory to ISO 17025 standards and extending services to any quality-driven or highly regulated industry.\n\nServices include: \n\n\nConstellation, an Exelon Company, provides energy sales in deregulated markets, known as competitive energy sales, to business, residential and government customers across the United States. Their customers include two-thirds of Fortune 100 companies.\n\nAtlantic City Electric is a regulated utility located in New Jersey with 545,000 electric customers.\n\nBaltimore Gas and Electric (BGE) is a regulated utility located in Maryland with 1.25 million+ electric customers and 650,000+ natural gas customers. It was previously the leading subsidiary of Constellation Energy Group until Constellation was acquired by Exelon in 2012. As part of the deal, Exelon split off BGE from Constellation's nonregulated energy supply business, and placed BGE under the umbrella of its regulated utilities.\n\nCommonwealth Edison (ComEd) is regulated utility located in Illinois with 4 million electric customers.\n\nDelmarva Power is a regulated utility located in Delaware and the Eastern Shore of Maryland with 515,000 electric customers over 5,000 square miles of service territory.

Since divesting from coal, the company is better positioned than many of its competitors to benefit from carbon pricing under a cap and trade plan for reducing carbon dioxide emissions. \"[Former] Exelon CEO John Rowe is a vociferous and longtime advocate of climate change legislation. In 2009, \"Forbes\" reported that if the Waxman-Markey climate legislation became law, 'the present value of Exelon's earnings stream would increase by $14 a share, or 28%.'\" Exelon also disclosed multiple contributions to political nonprofit organizations, the largest of which was $290,000 given to the American Energy Alliance – a 501(c)(4) nonprofit with ties to the conservative billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch and led by former Koch Industries lobbyist Thomas Pyle.\n\nIn 2005, Exelon was required to pay a $602,000 fine for exceeding the permitted sulfur dioxide emission limit from April to October 2004 at its Cromby Generating Station in Chester County, Pennsylvania.\n\nExelon and Illinois state officials waited for four years until 2006 before disclosing that Exelon's Braidwood Nuclear Generating Station, a nuclear plant 60 miles southwest of Chicago, had spilled millions of gallons of water containing tritium, a radioactive form of hydrogen, multiple times over a decade. Exelon officials eventually apologized and said the risks from the leak were \"minimal\", with tritium levels in surrounding wells all found to be below regulatory limits.\n\nIn 2009, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission announced its plan for a $65,000 fine against Exelon for permitting its contracted security guards that were guarding its Peach Bottom Nuclear Generating Station, a two-reactor nuclear plant located in Delta, Pennsylvania, to sleep on the job. The incidents did not come to light until a videotape of the security guards was leaked to news media. As a result, Exelon terminated the security contract of the Wackenhut security firm that had been involved and now operates its own in-house nuclear security force.\n\n"}

In 1954 Bakdash became the first member of a communist party to be elected to an Arab parliament. He has since been called the \"dean of Arab communism.\"\n\nHe was first recruited to the communist cause at the age of 18, while a student at Damascus University. He was subsequently active in student agitation against the French occupation of Syria, and came to the attention of the police. In 1933 the party judged it best that he leave the country, and in 1934 he enrolled in the Communist University of the Toilers of the East in Moscow. During this time, Bakdash produced the first Arabic-language translation of The Communist Manifesto.\n\nReturning in 1936, Bakdash took control of the Communist Party of Syria and Lebanon as secretary, a post he would retain without interruption for the rest of his life. He led the Syrian underground against Vichy France during that regime's control of Syria. When Syria came under allied control in 1942, the French government promised it independence and legalised the Communist Party, until then banned.\n\nBakdash took a moderate approach as secretary of the Syrian Communist Party. The party rules and programme which he drew up in 1944 reflected a determination to conform to the political circumstances of the Arab world of the time. They emphasized the party's attachment to the anti-colonial struggle and sought to establish it as a democratic mass movement rather than the restricted Marxist–Leninist vanguard organisation which a close adherence to Leninist principles might have dictated.\n\nAlthough Bakdash is often referred to as the doyen or elder statesman of Arab communism, his actual influence on other Arab communist parties was not as great as this phrase might suggest. He had, in particular, a stormy relationship with Fahd, leader of the Iraqi Communist Party from 1941 until 1949. In the early to mid-1940s Bakdash supported the Iraqi People's Party led by Aziz Sharif, which followed the example of the Syrian Communist Party in seeking to build a broad party emphasizing the national question, contrary to the more orthodox Leninist approach adopted by Fahd's party. Fahd also appears to have suspected him of suborning Iraqi communists resident in Damascus.\n\nBakdash won a seat in Parliament in 1954, and during Syria's turbulent democratic period from 1954 to 1958 steered a cautious course. The main difficulty confronting him in this period was the question of Arab unity and in particular of unification with Gamal Abdel Nasser's Egypt. Bakdash was extremely critical of Nasser, especially after the latter started a campaign of repression against his political opponents, notably the Communists and Muslim Brothers. Nasser did not approve of political pluralism and parties were banned under his rule.\n\nHowever, popular support for unity with Egypt forced Bakdash to accommodate to circumstances. Hanna Batatu, a notable historian of modern Arab politics, speculates that he must have been aware, and perhaps approved of, the participation of a Communist general in the Syrian delegation which persuaded Gamal Abdel Nasser to proceed to the creation of the United Arab Republic which combined Syria and Egypt in 1958. However, Bakdash himself provoked a harsh reaction from the Egyptian leader with his attack on the latter's policies published in December 1958, in which he called for legalization of political parties and transformation of the UAR into a loose federation. This resulted in a fierce campaign of repression against the party. Bakdash himself left Syria for Moscow, where he would stay until 1966.\n\nSyria seceded from the UAR in 1961, a decision supported by important elements in the army and the bourgeoisie as well as by the Communists, but the separation was intensely controversial and the parties that had supported it found their popular backing greatly reduced: the Syrian party was reduced to some hundreds of members.\n\nOn 8 March 1963 a coup by supporters of reunification with Egypt, essentially Baathists, Nasserists and the Arab Nationalist Movement put an end to the separatist government, although in the event reunification never took place. From then until the 1970s, the Communist Party would be repressed to one degree or another.\n\nIn 1966, the Syrian Ba'ath's secret military committee took power, and implemented a far-left line. Bakdash was allowed to return from Moscow, but forbidden from engaging in public political activity. After Hafez al-Assad took power in Syria in 1970, he announced his intention of reintroducing political pluralism in the context of popular democracy. This took the form of the National Progressive Front, a coalition of parties who supported the Arab nationalist and socialist orientation of the government and accepted the leadership of the Ba'ath Party. Faced with the choice between joining the front and illegal operation, Bakdash opted to join; Riyad al-Turk would later lead a small radical faction of the party into opposition.\n\nIn 1986, a difference of opinion between Bakdash and deputy general secretary Yusuf Faisal led to a split in the party. Faisal was supportive of the new policies of perestroika and glasnost being pursued by Soviet party secretary Mikhail Gorbachev; Bakdash was opposed. Many of the intellectuals in the party left with Faisal, while Bakdash retained the support of the party's considerable Kurdish base.\n\nKhalid Bakdash died in Damascus in 1995 at the age of 83. His widow, Wisal Farha Bakdash, succeeded him as party secretary.\n\n"}

It was financed by the United States Navy. Howard Aiken and Grace Hopper worked together to program and build the Mark II.\n\nThe Mark II was constructed with high-speed electromagnetic relays instead of electro-mechanical counters used in the Mark I, making it much faster than its predecessor. It weighted . Its addition time was 0.125 seconds (8 Hz) and the multiplication time was 0.750 seconds. This was a factor of 2.6 faster for addition and a factor 8 faster for multiplication compared to the Mark I. It was the second machine (after the Bell Labs Relay Calculator) to have floating-point hardware. A unique feature of the Mark II is that it had built-in hardware for several functions such as the reciprocal, square root, logarithm, exponential, and some trigonometric functions. These took between five and twelve seconds to execute.\n\nThe Mark I and Mark II were not a stored-program computer – it read an instruction of the program one at a time from a tape and executed it (like the Mark I). This separation of data and instructions is known as the Harvard architecture. The Mark II had a peculiar programming method that was devised to ensure that the contents of a register were available when needed. The tape containing the program could encode only eight instructions, so what a particular instruction code meant depended on when it was executed. Each second was divided up into several periods, and a coded instruction could mean different things in different periods. An addition could be started in any of eight periods in the second, a multiplication could be started in any of four periods of the second, and a transfer of data could be started in any of twelve periods of the second. Although this system worked, it made the programming complicated, and it reduced the efficiency of the machine somewhat.\n\nThe Mark II ran some realistic test programs in 1947. It was delivered to the US Navy Proving Ground at Dahlgren, Virginia in 1948 and became operational by the end of that year.\n\n\n"}

They achieved success, followed by tours throughout Romania and recordings for radio broadcast. At the 2006 MTV Romania Music Awards, Iris won the Best Rock Award and were nominated for Best Band and Best Live Act.\n\nIris began in 1975 with Emil Lechințeanu, Ioan 'Nelu' Dumitrescu and Ion 'Nuțu' Olteanu. Through the years, the band has experienced many line-up changes. In 45 years of activity, Iris became one of the biggest names in Romanian music history. First appearance on an album was in 1978 with the song \"Corabia cu pânze\" on \"Formații de muzică pop III\" compilation album. At the beginning of the 1980s, Ioan 'Nelu' Dumitrescu, Ion 'Nuțu' Olteanu (guitar) and Cristian 'Cristi' Minculescu, who are still present in the current line-up, played with Florin Ochescu (guitar) and Mihai 'Marty' Popescu (bass guitar). Together they released a debut-album, \"Iris I\", which included songs that became some of the most popular Romanian rock songs: \"Doar pentru voi\" (\"Only for You\"), \"Trenul fără naș\" (\"The Train without a Ticket-Collector\"), \"Pe ape\" (\"On Water\"), and \"Cei ce vor fi\" (\"Those to Come\").\n\nIn 1987, \"Iris II\" was released with an extravagant cover depicting the communist regime, a cover which represented one of Cristian 'Cristi' Minculescu's idols, Angus Young, \"in action\". The band's line-up was Cristian 'Cristi' Minculescu (vocal), Ioan 'Nelu' Dumitrescu (drums), Valter Popa (guitar), Mihai Alexandru (guitar, vocal) and Doru 'Boro' Borobeică (bass guitar). On this album, notable songs included \"Strada ta\" (\"Your Street\"), \"În parc\" (\"In the Park\"), and \"Zi și noapte\" (\"Day and Night\").\n\nOne year later, Iris released its third album, \"Nu te opri\" (\"Don't Stop\"), which featured the same line-up as \"Iris II\". The disc contained eight tracks, but the most important are \"Floare de iris\" (\"Iris Flower\"), \"Uită tot ce‑a fost\" (\"Forget All That Was\"), \"Eu și cu tine\" (\"Me and You\"), \"Ploaia de vise\" (\"Rain of Dreams\").\n\nIn December 1989, when the downfall of the Romanian communist regime began, Iris recorded the album \"Iris IV\" in Tomis Studio, without Mihai Alexandru, but with Cristian 'Cristi' Minculescu, Ion 'Nuțu' Olteanu, Doru 'Boro' Borobeică and Valter Popa. Hits from this album include \"De ce oare ai plecat?\" (\"Why Did You Leave Me?\"), \"Vino iar\" (\"Come Again\"), \"Rock and roll\", and \"Cine mă strigă în noapte?\" (\"Who Is Calling Me in the Night?\").\n\nIn 1992, Iris held an anniversary concert called Iris 15 ANI (\"Iris 15 years\") at Sala Polivalentă in Bucharest in front of 10,000 people. This was a record audience for a Romanian band, unequalled since that time. That same year, at the Cannes Festival, Iris won second place in the rock section and they appeared on MTV.\n\nThe fifth Iris album was named \"1993\" and was recorded with the \"Iris IV\" line-up, plus guitarist Dan Alex Sârbu. Iris played in Italy and on the Malboro Tour, in the big cities of Romania. In July 1996, following Dorian Ciubuc's idea, Iris signed a contract with Polygram for 6 years. In this time, Iris recorded 6 albums. In October 1998, they released \"Mirage\", an album with a union of tracks and orchestration. The album was co-authored with Mihai Godoroja.\n\nIn 1997 on October 17, Iris celebrated 20 years of existence with a live performance in Bucharest, featuring both active and former band members. Three weeks later, the band released a celebratory album entitled \"20 DE ANI\" (20 years). The album has 13 tracks from the live concert: \"Pământul îl cuprind\", \"Călătorul\", \"Trenul fără naș\", \"Speranța\", \"Iris, nu pleca\", \"Pe ape\", \"Mirage\", \"Cine mă strigă în noapte\", \"Valuri\", \"Floare de iris\", \"Tot zbor\", \"Baby\", \"Somn bizar\".\n\nIn 2000 the band began the largest tour ever undertaken by a Romanian band. The \"mega-tour\", as it was known, was named ATHENAEUM. The band also released an album of the same name. Two years later, \"DIGITAL ATHENAEUM\", a DVD featuring recordings of concerts on the tour, was released. In 2002, the \"Iris 25 Years\" concert gathered thousands in the biggest concert hall in the country. The next album, \"Mătase albă\" (\"White Silk\") featured ballads, such as \"Iubire fără de sfârșit\" (\"Endless Love\") and a cover version of \"Lady in Black\" by Uriah Heep, which won an MTV Music Award. This album was followed by \"4Motion\" and, in 2005, \"Iris Maxima\". The most notable ballad on \"Iris Maxima\" is \"Vino pentru totdeauna\" (\"Come Back for Always\").\n\nOn October 5, 2007, the band was honored by Romanian president Traian Băsescu for 30 years of contributions to Romanian culture. On the same day, the band performed in a live show in the front of over 15,000 fans.\n\nIn 2009, frontman Cristian 'Cristi' Minculescu underwent a liver transplant. The costs of the surgery was partly covered by the Romanian Ministry of Health. The minister of health at the time, Ion Bazac, stated: \"It is a sign of respect and gratitude for an artist who has delighted our souls\".\n\nOn October 8, 2009, the band performed in the first big concert after the liver transplant. On the occasion of this live performance, \"Integral Iris\", a boxset comprising the band's entire discography, was released.\n\nOn 22 June 2012 Iris held an anniversary concert in Piața Constituției, marking release os album \"Iris 35\". At spectacle was presented multimedia projections with moments from band history, and soprano Felicia Filip sang Iris melody “De vei pleca”.\n\nOn September 3, 2012, Minculescu, who had been with the band since 1980, stepped down and was replaced by Tony Șeicărescu. On 25 June 2013 Toni Șeicărescu left the group, on the background of some disagreements with Ioan 'Nelu' Dumitrescu, being replaced by Rafael Cătălin Paul Ciobotaru. In April 2015, Cristian 'Cristi' Minculescu returned to Iris.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

In 1846 and 1847, he attended the local Central High School. Between 1850 and 1855, he studied part-time with the German artist Paul Weber, while working as designer and illustrator of ornamental metalwork.

He then continued his studies for another year at the University of Göttingen. Richard Courant, also studying there at the same time, tells a story of Helly disrupting one of Courant's talks, which fortunately did not prevent David Hilbert from eventually hiring Courant as an assistant. After returning to Vienna, Helly worked as a tutor, Gymnasium teacher, and textbook editor until World War I, when he enlisted in the Austrian army. He was shot in 1915, and spent the rest of the war as a prisoner of the Russians. In one prison camp in Berezovka, Siberia, he organized a mathematical seminar in which Tibor Radó, then an engineer, began his interest in pure mathematics. While held in another camp at Nikolsk-Ussuriysk, also in Siberia, Helly wrote important contributions on functional analysis.\n\nAfter a complicated return trip, Helly finally came back to Vienna in 1920, married his wife (mathematician Elise Bloch) in 1921, and also in 1921 earned his habilitation. Unable to obtain a paid position at the university because he was seen as too old and too Jewish, he worked at a bank until the financial collapse of 1929, and then for an insurance company. After the takeover of Austria by the Nazis in 1938, he lost that job as well, and escaped to America. With the assistance of Albert Einstein, he found teaching positions at Paterson Junior College and Monmouth Junior College in New Jersey, before moving with his wife to Chicago in 1941, to work for the U.S. Army Signal Corps. In Chicago, he suffered two heart attacks, and died from the second one.\n\nIn the same 1912 paper in which he introduced Helly's selection theorem concerning the convergence of sequences of functions, Helly published a proof of a special case of the Hahn–Banach theorem, 15 years before Hans Hahn and Stefan Banach discovered it independently. Helly's proof only covers continuous functions over closed intervals of the real numbers; the more general theorem requires the ultrafilter lemma, a weakened variant of the axiom of choice, which had not yet been invented. Along with Hahn, Banach, and Norbert Wiener, Helly has subsequently been seen as one of the founders of the theory of normed vector spaces.\n\nHis most famous result, Helly's theorem on the intersection patterns of convex sets in Euclidean spaces, was published in 1923. The theorem states that, if \"F\" is a family of \"d\"-dimensional convex sets with the property that every \"d\" + 1 sets have a nonempty intersection, then the whole family has a nonempty intersection. Helly families, named after this theorem, are a set-theoretic generalization of this intersection property: they are the families of sets in which the minimal subfamilies with empty intersection consist of a bounded number of sets.\n\n"}

It is the largest species of wild sheep. Argali stand high at the shoulder and measure long from the head to the base of the tail. The female, or ewe is the smaller sex by a considerable margin, sometimes weighing less than half as much as the male, or ram. The ewes can weigh from and the rams typically from , with a maximum reported mass of . The Pamir argali (also called Marco Polo sheep, for they were first described by that traveler), \"O. a. polii\", is the largest race on average, regularly measuring more than long without the tail, and is less sexually dimorphic in body mass than most other subspecies. The argali has relatively the shortest tail of any wild goat-antelope or sheep, with reported tail lengths of .\n\nThe general coloration varies between each animal, from a light yellow to a reddish-brown to a dark grey-brown. Argali or nyan from the Himalayas are usually relatively dark, whereas those from Russian ranges are often relatively pale. In summertime, the coat is often lightly spotted with a salt-and-pepper pattern. The back is darker than the sides, which gradually lighten in color. The face, tail and the buttocks are yellowish-white. The male has a whitish neck ruff and a dorsal crest and is usually slightly darker in color than the female. Males have two large corkscrew shaped horns, some measuring in total length and weighing up to . Males use their horns for competing with one another. Females also carry horns, but they are much smaller, usually measuring less than in total length.\n\nCurrently, 9 subspecies of argali are recognized:\n\nSome sources classify mouflon as \"Ovis ammon musimon\", but DNA testing has not supported this. Several subspecies of argali have been genetically tested for mtDNA and one study found the subspecies \"O. a. ammon\", \"O. a. darwini\" and the urial subspecies, \"O. vignei bochariensis\" grouped closely, while the subspecies \"O. a. collium\" and \"O. a. nigrimontana\" grouped with the urial subspecies \"O. vignei arkal\".\n\nArgali range from central Kazakhstan in the west to the Shanxi Province in China in the east and from the Altai Mountains in the north to the Himalayas to the south. They are a species of mountainous areas, living from elevations of . In protected areas, the species generally prefers gently sloping areas with soft broken terrain, although ewes with lambs often take up residence in more precipitous areas, characterized by canyons and jagged rocks. In areas where they are extensively hunted (such as Kazakhstan), they are more likely to be found in forested areas. In parts of China and Russia where they compete for resources with numerous domestic stock, argali more regularly take up residence in precipitous, jagged areas. Argali may search for regions in the mountains where snow cover is not heavy during the winter, following winds that blow snow off the earth. Rams are generally found at higher elevations more regularly than females and stay at higher elevations longer during the winter.\n\nArgalis live in herds typically numbering between two and 150 animals, segregated by sex, except during breeding season. Most populations show large numbers of adult females, constituting more than half of a local population, against around 20% adult males and a further 20% young argali. Some rams are solitary, but most are seen in small herds numbering between three and 30 individuals. Females and their young live in larger groups, regularly up to 92 individuals and exceptionally to 200 animals. Migrating herds, especially males, have been reported. Most migration appear to be related to seasonally decreased food sources, though an overabundance of biting insects (especially gadflies), severe drought or fires, poaching by humans, and large numbers of domestic livestock may also trigger movements. With their long legs, herds can travel quickly from place to place. Argali tend to live at higher elevations during the summer.\nArgali reach breeding maturity at two to three years of age. Rutting may occur from October to mid-January, generally lasting longer in lower elevations. In rutting herds, both rams and ewes attack others of their own sex, exerting dominance by ramming each other with their horns. Although such groups engage in lamb-like play, the combat of a pair of mature males is a serious business. The rams slam into each other, with their fore legs up in the air, exerting enough force to be heard up to away. Often, the older males (over six years of age), which are also often the largest, end up the dominant ones and younger males are chased off once the ewes are in estrus. Once dominance is established, the top rams begin approaching ewes and smell their urine to determine their receptiveness. The ram then repeatedly approaches the ewe and forcibly mounts her. Mating commences around two to three weeks after the rutting begins. Rams may remain in the company of ewes for up to two months after the rutting period is complete.\n\nThe gestation period lasts a little over 165 days. Births occur in late March or April, with a variable number of females being barren. Most subspecies give birth to a single lamb, though in some races, twins are not uncommon and even as many as five have been born at once. At birth, the lambs weigh . The newborn lamb and mother ewe stay around where the birth occurs overnight and, on the next day, both usually walk together. Lambs often play in groups, jumping up and down together, sometimes being joined by their mothers. Weight gain is often quite fast and the lambs may weigh 10 times their birth weight by their first birthday. Females often attain their maximum mass by two years of age, but males appear to continue to grow larger and heavier in their third and fourth years. Milk teeth develop around three months of age, with a full set of teeth developing by around six months. By the time their teeth develop, lambs are capable grazers, but the ewes continue nursing them from August to May of the following year. Most argali live five to 10 years, but are capable of living 13 years in the wild.\n\nAdult argali eat of food a day. The vegetation preferred by the species varies based on elevation and area. In higher elevations, they predominantly eat grasses, sedges, and forbs. At midelevation habitats, they more regularly feed on bushes and mesophyte grasses. In the lowest ranges and the spurs of deserts, grasses and sedges again predominate, but often of different species than the high-elevation ones. In north-central Kazakhstan, sprouts, leaves, flowers, and fruits are significant to the diet all year, whereas they appear to be a rare dietary supplement over the rest of the range. Water is needed by argali, which is rarely a problem for animals living at high elevation, where melting snow and small waterways are regularly encountered. In drier climes, argali may travel several kilometers in search of water. When available, argali readily consume saline soil.\n\nAlthough they are locally sympatric with Siberian ibex, the two species have differing habitat and pasture preferences, reducing likely competition. In Tibet, the argali must regularly compete with other grazing species for pasture, including Tibetan antelope, bharal, Thorold's deer and wild yaks. Competition is most serious with livestock, especially domestic yak and domestic sheep, with which argali are frequently forced to intermingle and from which they often catch diseases and parasites. The main predators of argali are wolves and mountain lions, which often exploit harsh winter conditions (such as deep snow) to capture the wild sheep, though they can and do take specimens of any age or condition year around. Where not locally extirpated, snow leopards and leopards are also predators of argali of any age. Eurasian lynx and wolverines may seldom kill argali to at least the size of winter-weakened ewes. Red foxes and domestic dogs (largely those kept by sheep-herders) will prey on lambs. Cinereous vultures, lammergeiers and golden eagles have been observed circling herds of ewes with lambs in a possibly predatory manner and remains of argali lambs have been observed in golden eagle nests. Smaller predators, such as raptorial birds and smaller mammalian carnivores, are attacked by mother ewes, but in the presence of larger predators, the ewes quickly run away with the lambs following them.\n\nArgali are considered a near threatened species, due to domestic livestock ranching and hunting, among other things. As the world's largest sheep, the lure to gather a trophy specimen is strong among sports-hunters. They are hunted for both their meat and their horns, used in traditional Chinese medicine, and poaching continues to be a major (and difficult to manage) problem. Argali have been extirpated from northeastern China, southern Siberia, and parts of Mongolia. Populations of predators such as gray wolves and snow leopards have appeared to have been negatively affected by the scarcity of argali.\n\nIn Pakistan-administered Kashmir it is listed as an endangered species.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2202590", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2202590", "title": "The Iron Dream", "text": "The Iron Dream\n\nThe Iron Dream is a metafictional 1972 alternate history novel by American author Norman Spinrad. The book has a nested narrative that tells a story within a story. On the surface, the novel presents a post-apocalyptic adventure tale entitled \"Lord of the Swastika\", written by an alternate-history Adolf Hitler shortly before his death in 1953. In this timeline, Hitler emigrated from Germany to the United States in 1919 after the Great War, and used his modest artistic skills to become first a pulp–science fiction illustrator and later a successful writer, telling lurid, purple-prosed, pro-fascism stories under a thin science fiction veneer. The nested narrative is followed by a faux scholarly analysis by a fictional literary critic Homer Whipple which is said to have been written in 1959.\n\nThe book's frame narrative and premise is that \"after dabbling in radical politics\", Adolf Hitler emigrated to the United States in 1919 and became a science fiction illustrator, editor, and author. He wrote his final science fantasy novel \"Lord of the Swastika\" in six weeks in 1953, shortly before dying of cerebral hemorrhage (possibly caused by tertiary syphilis); \"Lord of the Swastika\" subsequently wins the Hugo Award and the \"colorful uniforms\" described therein become a regular feature of cosplayers at science fiction conventions. Hitler's other published works include the long-running fanzine \"Storm\" and the novels \"The Master Race\", \"The Thousand Year Rule\", and \"The Triumph of the Will\".\n\nIn a faux review following the main narrative, presented as written by (fictitious) Dr. Homer Whipple of New York University, we learn more about the background of the alternate history in which Hitler emigrated to the United States. Without Hitler's leadership, the Nazi Party fell apart in 1923 and the Communist Party of Germany succeeded in fomenting a German communist revolution in 1930. As this alternate history continues, there is reference to a \"Greater Soviet Union\" which took over the United Kingdom in 1948, and whose influence is growing in Latin America by 1959. The fact that Whipple refers to World War I as \"the Great War\" implies that there has been no equivalent of World War II in this world. The core element in the historical backstory of \"Lord of the Swastika\" is a nuclear apocalypse but Whipple gives no indication about such weapons really existing in this alternate reality.\n\nWhipple also discloses that Empire of Japan has retained its militarism, with reference to its bushido code of conduct, while the United States vacillates against the Greater Soviet Union's ascendancy. Due to the Greater Soviet Union threat, the United States and Japan have a close military and strategic alliance. Japanese militarist values are much admired in the United States. Japan, Australia, New Zealand, and the United States (collectively called the Pacific Pact) are the only major powers standing between the Greater Soviet Union and total control of the globe—yet most Americans seem unable to be roused to deal with the looming Soviet danger. Whipple wonders what the emergence of an American leader like Feric Jaggar, the hero of \"Lord of the Swastika\", could accomplish. Finally, there is a casual mention that, while in this history Nazi Germany never came into being, it is the Soviets who have undertaken a systematic genocide of the Jews of Europe in this world's version of the Holocaust.\n\n\"Lord of the Swastika\" is lauded for its qualities as a great work of heroic fantasy. To further hammer the point, in an early edition, actual science fiction writers wrote fictional statements of praise for \"Hitler's\" writing skills for Spinrad to use as blurbs on the novel's back cover. Irony abounds in Whipple's review, as he argues author Hitler is obviously wrong in assuming that not much more than midnight rallies and phallic symbolism would create a large number of supporters for a movement. \"After all\", Dr. Whipple says, \"it can't happen here\", a reference to the political novel \"It Can't Happen Here\".\n\n\"Lord of the Swastika\" opens in the year 1142 A.F.—\"After Fire\", the global nuclear war referred to as the \"Time of Fire\" which brought about the end of the civilization of the technologically advanced \"Ancients\" and the current despoliation of most forms of life. The gene pools of almost all life forms are corrupted by the radioactive fallout. Few examples of the baseline human form can be seen, and most of humanity are mutants with blue skins, lizard scales or parrot beaks, or wizened half-breed mutants and normal-seeming but inhuman \"Dominators\", who desire to rule the ruined world with their mind-controlling powers.\n\nThe pure and strong young \"Trueman\" (so named for the lack of mutations in his DNA) Feric Jaggar returns from the outlands of Borgravia where his family was exiled by the treaty of Karmak with the surrounding mutant states to his ancestral land, the High Republic of Heldon, which was founded on the principles of killing mutants and keeping humanity pure. He arrives only to find its rigor slackened and corrupted by the \"Universalists\", pawns of the sinister Dominator country Zind, which seeks to corrupt Heldon's pure human gene pool into the mutant diversity that rules the rest of the world. Indeed, in the very first portion of Heldon that Feric enters, the customs fort where entrants are tested to see whether they are pure and free of mutation, he is outraged that mutants are being allowed into Heldon on day-passes, that the fort is under the spell of a Dominator, and that the tests are so lax that impure specimens are being granted citizenship.\n\nIn Heldon proper, Feric dines in the \"Eagle's Nest\" tavern, and mulls over the question of how to change this situation. Should he enter politics or the military? Feric witnesses the oratory of Seph Bogel, leader of the Human Renaissance Party, who speaks eloquently but ineffectually to the crowd about the need for human purity. Fired by his words, Feric is inspired to take control of the listening crowd and leads a mob to the same border post, there to slay the Dominator (or \"Dom\") who had quietly disguised himself as a clerk to sway the immigration decisions in favor of mutants. At Bogel's invitation, he assumes leadership of the Party, which Feric later renames The Sons of the Swastika, and the two travel on to Walder—the second city of Heldon—to meet the party inner circle and begin the great task.\n\nTheir journey is interrupted when their steam-powered vessel is waylaid by the outlaw petrol-powered motorcycle gang, the Black Avengers. Jaggar, however, senses that these men may be of use to his cause and challenges their leader, Stag Stopa. The rules of the Black Avengers only allow a member to challenge the leader, and so he and Bogel are taken back to their headquarters for Feric to be initiated. Feric acquits himself mainly in the drinking of ale and in running the gauntlet of torches on a motorcycle. He and Stopa duel with truncheons, and Feric's truncheon breaks. Desperately he reaches out and defeats Stopa with the legendary \"Great Truncheon of Stag Held\"—which can only be wielded by a descendant of the last true King of Heldon, Sigmark IV. The Black Avengers immediately pledge fealty to him, and become the \"Knights of the Swastika\".\n\nFrom this event, Jaggar assumes a hereditary right to be the leader of Heldon and embarks on a violent crusade for genetic purity, drawing a massive following, staging outdoor rallies and raising an army personally loyal to him. He is elected to the Council and stages a coup d'état when he forces the Council to admit to treason and a Zind plot against Heldon. Confirming his suspicions, the Universalist member of the Council turns out to be a Dom. Feric summarily executes him with the Great Truncheon. Jaggar coerces the Council into granting him complete executive power and then has them shot. Immediately after assuming power Jaggar puts down an imminent coup by Stopa, who has been corrupted by the fleshly pleasures of Zind.\n\nBacked by the army and the adoring multitudes, Feric sets about the great task of re-invigorating the military, ordering the production of tanks and fighter jets, the establishment of the Swastika Squad (SS)—a legion of the purest and most manly men that can be found via the \"Classification Camps\", which examine all citizens of Heldon (killing the Doms and sterilizing or exiling all relatively impure humans). After repelling a Zind attack through Wolack, Heldon annexes its western and southern neighbors, beginning with Borgravia. In the course of the Helderisation of its neighbors Jaggar orders, at the suggestion of Bors Remler, that all mutants are to be euthanised rather than exiled.\n\nMonths later, his scientists report that they are near to rediscovering the secrets of atomic bombs, but that Zind is making efforts to dig up relics of the Ancients, which might salvage its own complement of nuclear weaponry. Noting the damage such weapons had done, Feric orders such research ended, and determines to wipe out Zind and every last Dom before they can unleash the Fire. Soon enough, Zind begins to rally its troops from their reverse in Wolack. The final invasion of Zind is hard fought: the main Helder force, under the command of Lar Waffing, takes the southwestern oil fields needed for resupply, while the secondary force fights a delaying action against the vast bulk of the Zind army to the north towards the Zind capital, Bora. Needless to say, the forces of Heldon prevail and the Zind army is destroyed and burned, down to the last mindless \"Warrior\". The central city is reduced to a cinder in a firestorm (akin to the bombing of Dresden in our world).\n\nThe last Dom, apparently a military leader, is discovered hiding in a bomb bunker. The Dom has anticipated defeat and, before Feric has the pleasure of killing him, triumphantly reveals that the Doms had salvaged and rearmed one of the ancient nuclear weapons. It is a doomsday weapon, and he triggers the failsafe. After Feric and his cohorts have evacuated Bora, a cobalt bomb detonates, and as the Dom planned, its fallout utterly corrupts the gene pool of Heldon. If any of its citizens, including Feric, reproduce, they will produce the mutants that they had previously sought to obliterate.\n\nFeric orders the sterilization of the entire Heldon nation, including himself, and, in a final desperate gamble, orders the SS scientists to redouble their efforts to develop the next Master Race from cloning the perfect specimens of the SS. Eventually they succeed and millions of the new master race are produced in 'reproduction works' to complete the cleansing of the Earth. At the novel's close, Heldon has mastered interstellar travel. As a consequence, an initial starship, full of 300 of these seven-foot, blond, super-intelligent all-male SS clones in suspended animation, is launched into space to initiate Heldon's own galactic empire. The SS clones also have a clone of Feric to lead them. This inaugural rocket is launched on a voyage to Tau Ceti and will become the first of many.\n\nIt is a pastiche of Hitler's own life filtered through a fantasy lens, ending not in defeat but in global, indeed galactic, dominion: the Dominators represent the Jews, Heldon represents Germany, Feric Jaggar represents a cliché, wish-fulfillment, almost Mary Sue-ish self-portrait of Hitler himself, and Jaggar's initial return from Borgravia mirrors Hitler's own birth in Austria.\n\nEssentially, the career of the fictional Feric Jaggar is an idealized version of Hitler's real-life career - taking power in Heldon (Germany) and establishing a dictatorial rule dedicated to the ideal of \"racial purity\"; conquering and annexing his original homeland of Borgravia (Austria); defeating and conquering the countries to his west, with no analogue of a stubbornly resisting Britain; and finally utterly defeating and destroying Zind (Russia) and its capital Bora (Moscow), killing each and every one of the Universalists (Communists) and Doms (Jews). There is in this world no analogue of America, to interfere and foil Jaggar/Hitler's plans for world conquest.\n\nReviewer Michael Ward questions the plausibility of the alternate Hitler coming up with this particular fantasy. \"The Hitler dreamed up by Spinrad had only briefly dabbled in German politics, and has written 'Lord of the Swastika' after several decades of living in America as a law abiding American citizen and science fiction writer. He has no way of knowing what career he would have had if he had not left Germany, in what ways it would have succeeded and how it would have failed.\"\n\nNorman Spinrad was intent on demonstrating just how close Joseph Campbell's \"The Hero with a Thousand Faces\" and much science fiction and fantasy literature can be to the racist ideology of Nazi Germany. Spinrad has said that the original version of the novel was 70,000 words long, but that his editor requested he add an extra 10,000 words \"to justify the advance and the cover price they wanted to put on it.\"\n\n\"The Iron Dream\" won critical acclaim, including a Nebula Award nomination and a Prix Tour-Apollo Award. Ursula K. Le Guin wrote in a review that: \"We are forced, insofar as we can continue to read the book seriously, to think, not about Adolf Hitler and his historic crimes—Hitler is simply the distancing medium—but to think about ourselves: our moral assumptions, our ideas of heroism, our desires to lead or to be led, our righteous wars. What Spinrad is trying to tell us is that it is happening here.\" Le Guin also stated that \"a novel by Adolf Hitler\" cannot \"be well-written, complex, (or) interesting\", as this \"would spoil the bitter joke\", but also asked why anyone should \"read a book that isn't interesting\", arguing that the bad prose of \"Hitler's\" book may have been due, in part, to the poor quality of Spinrad's own prose.\n\nLeslie Fiedler proposed that Spinrad be considered for the National Book Award in 1973, but apparently won no support from his fellow award judges.\n\nIn 1982, the book was \"indexed\" in West Germany by the Bundesprüfstelle für jugendgefährdende Medien for its alleged promotion of Nazism. Spinrad's publisher, Heyne Verlag, challenged this in court and, until the ban was overturned in 1987, the book could be sold, but not advertised or publicly displayed.\n\nThe American Nazi Party put the book on its recommended reading list, despite the satirical intent of the work. In Spinrad's own words:\n\nTo make damn sure that even the historically naive and entirely unselfaware reader got the point, I appended a phony critical analysis of \"Lord of the Swastika\", in which the psychopathology of Hitler's saga was spelled out by a tendentious pedant in words of one syllable. Almost everyone got the point... And yet one review appeared in a fanzine that really gave me pause. \"This is a rousing adventure story and I really enjoyed it,\" the gist of it went. \"Why did Spinrad have to spoil the fun with all this muck about Hitler?\"\n\n\n"}

Aerophagia may also refer to an unusual condition where the primary symptom is excessive flatus, belching is not present, and the actual mechanism by which air enters the gut is obscure. Aerophagia in psychiatry is sometimes attributed to nervousness or anxiety.\n\n\nAerophagia is associated with chewing gum, smoking, drinking carbonated drinks, eating too quickly, anxiety, high continuous positive airway pressure and wearing loose dentures. Aerophagia is also carried out deliberately to increase the length and volume of a belch, as any air successfully swallowed serves to increase the partial pressure in the stomach. In people with cervical spinal blockages, inhaling can cause air to enter the esophagus and stomach.\n\nAerophagia is diagnosed in 8.8% of cognitively delayed patients where the coordination between swallowing and respiration is not well defined.\n\nAerophagia is a dangerous side effect of non-invasive ventilation (NIV), commonly used in treatments of respiratory problems and cardiovascular critical care or in surgery when a general anaesthetic is required. In the case of aerophagia during NIV, it is normally diagnosed by experienced medical specialists who check on patients intermittently during NIV use. The diagnosis is based on the sound heard by listening through a stethoscope placed outside the abdominal cavity. Using this approach, the problem is sometimes detected later than when it develops, possibly also later than necessary. Belated detection of aerophagia may lead to gastric distension, which in turn could elevate the diaphragm or cause aspiration of the stomach contents into the lungs or pneumatic rupture of the esophagus due to extreme gastric insufflation.\n\n\n"}

After the American Revolutionary War, and influenced by Baptist, Quaker and Swedenborgian faith, Carter began what became the largest manumission and release of enslaved African Americans in North America prior to the American Civil War. By a deed of gift filed with Northumberland County on September 5, 1791, and related documents filed in Westmoreland County in subsequent years, Carter began manumitting 500 slaves from his plantations in his lifetime. He also settled many of them on land he gave them\n\nCarter was the grandson of Virginia land baron Robert \"King\" Carter of Corotoman. In 1732, both his father and grandfather died, leaving the young boy in the care of his uncles George, Charles and Landon Carter, as well as his mother. She remarried in 1735 to John Lewis of Warner Hall in Gloucester County. \nAt age 9, young Robert was sent to the College of William and Mary, beginning with preparatory classes. In 1749 he came of age and received his inheritance. \nAfter crossing the Atlantic Ocean to Liverpool with Lawrence Washington, Carter travelled to London, where he and Philip Ludwell Lee started legal studies at the Inner Temple. \n\nCarter returned to Virginia in 1751 where he was admitted to the bar. He took up residence at Nomony Hall. This was his preferred spelling for his inherited plantation on the Northern Neck. \"Nominy\" or \"Nomini\" are more commonly used today, as in the highway marker noting the plantation site. He unsuccessfully campaigned at least twice for a seat in the House of Burgesses, but he did secure an appointment to the Westmoreland County Court in 1752.\n\nCarter left Virginia again in 1754, and married Frances Ann Tasker, daughter of former Maryland governor Benjamin Tasker. They ultimately had seventeen children, of which eight daughters and four sons reached adulthood. The successful marriage seemed to settle Carter, who began to pay attention to his vast landholdings, as well as politics. \n\nIn 1758, using his in-laws' connections with the Board of Trade, Carter secured an appointment by King George II to the Virginia Governor's Council. When George III succeeded his grandfather in 1760, Carter was reappointed to the post, which served as the colony's appellate court as well as advised on executive matters. He purchased a house in Williamsburg from his cousin Robert Carter Nicholas and moved his growing family there in 1761. Carter, whom John Page once called \"illiterate\", began reading voraciously, as well as socializing with the city's intellectuals. These included Governor Fauquier, George Wythe, William Small, John Blair and young Thomas Jefferson.\n\nAt first loyal to his King, Carter expressed support for the Crown during the period of popular rejoicing that accompanied news of George III's repeal of the Stamp Act. But, Parliament passed additional laws obnoxious to colonial interests, and by 1772 the new Governor Dunmore exacerbated tensions. That year, Carter moved his ailing family (having lost three young daughters to unknown illnesses within 11 months) back to Nomony Hall on the Northern Neck, announcing his retirement from public life. Carter never appeared in the Governor's Council minutes (other than as present) after it voted to allow slaveholders or local authorities to punish slaves without due process. Moreover, rather than educate his sons at the College of William and Mary, Carter hired Philip Fithian as tutor.\n\nCarter concentrated his efforts on trade, including ironworks, a textile factory, and a flour mill, in addition to draining swamps around Nomony and diversifying crops at all his plantations. Although publicly neutral, Carter honored the continental boycott declared in 1774, and in 1775 joined Richard Corbin in expressing the council's concern about rumors of British marines being stationed at Williamsburg. Carter declined to give the loyalty assurances Dunmore required, and Dunmore dissolved the council in 1776. The following summer, Carter gave a loyalty oath to the new Commonwealth of Virginia. Although Carter declined political offices mentioned by Patriot friends, he began supplying provisions and bayonets to the American cause in the Revolution, so British ships raided his plantations near the Potomac river.\n\nAlthough his great-grandfather John Carter had freed slaves in his will (as well as provided homesteads and livestock for them), the colony of Virginia made individual manumission illegal in the year Carter's father and grandfather died. It was not authorized again until 1783. King Carter had greatly expanded the institution of slavery in Virginia, by purchasing many from ships to work on his plantations. He owned more than a thousand slaves upon his death. King Carter gave his grandson Robert III his first slave (a girl) when the infant was three months old. By the time he came of legal age in 1749, Robert Carter III owned of land and 100 slaves. \n\nAlthough Carter sold land and some slaves to pay his debts in 1758, he did not purchase more slaves (unlike George Washington and other neighbors). He became known among his neighbors for his humane treatment of the enslaved workers in this region. Carter rarely whipped slaves, or allowed them to be whipped, let alone scarred them, although he whipped his own children, particularly his eldest son Robert Bladen. Carter's plantations had roughly double the rate of slave population increase as others in the state. Carter was particularly moved by the example of Governor Fauquier, who in his will allowed his slaves to choose their masters. \n\nWhen Carter became a co-administrator of his father-in-law's estate, he (with the support of Daniel Dulany) delayed scheduling a sale of the slaves of Bel-Air plantation, since that would break up families. But his delays led to more than 18 years of litigation with his Tasker in-laws. \n\nCarter became known for his religious freethinking and support of dissenters even before the Revolution. He resigned from the Cople Parish Church vestry in 1776. During the following year he had a mystical experience while feverish from a smallpox inoculation. This prompted further spiritual seeking, from composing his own prayer for God to \"have pity upon all Jews, Turks, Infidels & Hereticks\", to making trips to attend services and hear from Quaker, Methodist, Presbyterian and Baptist preachers (all classified as dissenters), and investigating Arminianism and perhaps Catholicism (although these pursuits were illegal in Virginia at the time, where the Anglican Church was the state established church). On September 6, 1778, the Rev. Lewis Lunsford baptised Carter by immersion in Totuskey Creek. Carter scandalized neighbors further by joining Morattico Baptist Church, which had a mixed congregation of white and black, free and slave. In this period, most elite planters still belonged to the Anglican Church. Carter knew he risked persecution, for Eleazar Clay, another wealthy man, had his life threatened after such conversion. During the three weeks preceding his own baptism, Carter attended two different services that were attacked by armed mobs that included Revolutionary War veterans. His wife Frances Ann Tasker Carter, who was declared an invalid in October 1779 after the birth of their 16th child, moved to Bladensburg, Maryland for health reasons. She converted to the Baptist faith there a year before her death in 1787.\n\nMeanwhile, Carter became a prominent Baptist, serving on its General Association, financing the foundation of several churches in the Northern Neck, and corresponding with eminent ministers. The noted Methodist missionary and anti-slavery activist Francis Asbury also lodged at Nomony Hall at least twice after Carter's Baptist conversion.\n\nCarter believed human slavery immoral, and tried to pass his beliefs to his children. However, his eldest son, Robert Bladen (although an admirer of the poet Phyllis Wheatley), at least twice sold young female slaves against his father's wishes. He also gambled and incurred such large debts that when Robert Bladen fled to England in 1783, his father was compelled to liquidate not only lands, but also slaves and thus break up families, in order to pay off his son's debts. In 1785 his son-in-law John Peck sold slaves whom Carter had given to his daughter Anne Tasker Carter as a dowry before the couple married and moved northward. Carter gave his remaining daughters dowries that did not include human property. \n\nIn February 1786, Carter decided to send his youngest sons George and John Tasker Carter to the new Baptist university in Rhode Island (what is now Brown University). He wrote to its minister president James Manning: \nI beg leave to appoint you their Foster Father intimating that my desire is that both my Said Sons shd. be active Characters in Life ... The prevailing Notion now is to Continue the most abject State of Slavery in this Common-Wealth – On this Consideration only, I do not intend that these my two Sons shall return to this State till each of them arrive to the Age of 21 years.\n\nIn November 1788, Carter sent three daughters to live with Baptist friends in Baltimore, instructing their hosts \"Girls are not to act by a Maid, but by themselves.\" But he also sent a slave as barter for their room and board.\n\nDuring the 1780s, the Baptist Church began to segregate its meetings. After the Ketocton Association passed a motion that hereditary slavery was \"contrary to the word of God,\" and Morattico Baptist Church changed its rule to allow only free male members to vote on church issues, tumult rocked the General Committee. Carter's wife had died and the grieving widower responded to the changes by drafting a charter for Yeocomico Church that required egalitarian voting. He left Morattico for the splinter congregation, signing its charter below the signatures of several slaves. Carter unsuccessfully ran for a position in the Virginia Ratification Convention. While struggling with several bouts of illness, he was cared for by his daughter Sarah Fairfax Carter. He postponed her proposed marriage to Richard Bland Lee, perhaps because of the suitor's pro-slavery ideas.\n\nCarter continued to host spiritual seekers, including a \"Mr. Moyce,\" who in January 1788 introduced him to the writings of Emanuel Swedenborg, a Scandinavian aristocrat, scientist and mystic who had developed followers in London. Carter began to request copies of his writings from business correspondents. In December 1789, Carter believed he \"died\", perhaps another religious experience tinged by illness. In 1790, Carter wrote British Baptist elder John Rippon, \"the toleration of slavery indicates very great depravity of mind.\" He also criticized ministers who offered universal redemption, but only \"partial Election before Creation\". In the nineteenth century, as the Baptist Church became more accommodating of slavery, it began to grow in the number of members. In 1790 it claimed 20,000 members in Virginia; a decade later, well after the disestablishment of the Anglican Church, it had become Virginia's second largest sect. \n\nIn the years after the Revolutionary War, Virginia's legislature (having barred the slave trade in 1778) passed several laws sympathetic to freeing slaves, although it did not pass a law legalizing manumission until 1782, and throttled many petitions for wider emancipation. Numerous slaveholders in the Chesapeake Bay area freed their slaves, often in their wills (like Quaker John Pleasants) or deeds, and noted principles of equality and Revolutionary ideals as reason for their decisions. The number of free African Americans increased in the Upper South from less than one percent before the Revolution, to 10 percent by 1810. In Delaware, three-fourths of the slaves had been freed by 1810. In the decade after the act's passage, Virginians had freed 10,000 slaves, without visible social disruptions. The price of slaves reached a 20-year low as the percentage listed as \"black, tithable\" (i.e. slaves) fell below 40%, the lowest point in the century. However, Virginia's courts sidestepped issuing appellate decisions ratifying emancipation until 1799, and the methodology of within-life emancipation was not established.\n\nCarter hoped Virginia's legislature would pass a gradual emancipation plan, as did New York and New Jersey. His neighbor Ferdinando Fairfax published one such plan in a Philadelphia-based journal, and Quaker Warner Mifflin presented petitions to Congress to do the same, but James Madison buried the proposals in committee. In early 1791, Carter refused to rent a plantation to Charles Mynn Thruston, a Revolutionary veteran and Anglican minister, with whose racial views he disagreed. His Baptist friend John Leland left Virginia after a final anti-slavery sermon, which Carter copied in full into his journal.\n\nCarter nonetheless began a personal program of gradual manumission of slaves on his many plantations. He announced his plan on August 1, 1791, and began a new legal process by recording a Deed of Gift in Northumberland County on September 5, 1791. Since the manumission law required a five shilling fee, and Carter had plantations and slaves in several Virginia counties, he corresponded with the Westmoreland County clerk (where he resided) and followed up by filing manumission papers at the Westmoreland County court sessions the following February, May, July and August. His actions were resisted by his son-in-law John Peck, and various overseers and white tenants of his estates. Carter designed the gradual program to reduce the opposition of slave-owning white neighbors, but he failed to gain their support. He refused tenants' requests to relocate slave breeding women in order to circumvent the Deed of Gift. That winter Carter was shunned, although he sought help from fellow slavery opponents, including George Mason (who declined to help and cited his own age and infirmity). By the filings of February 27, 1793, Carter was ahead of his own planned schedule. Moreover, he refused to relocate freed blacks, and began offering them wages to work for him. He also offered some grants and tenancies, sometimes dispossessing obstreperous white tenants. Carter began investigating relocating to the District of Columbia. He leased Nomony plantation and its servants to his son J.T. on April 26, 1793 (expressly conditional to the Deed of Gift).\n\nThen, before the next Westmoreland court session, perhaps victimized by mob action such as tar-and-feathers, Carter and his daughters fled by ship with Negro George and Negro Betty to Baltimore (on May 8, 1793). He never returned, despite numerous entreaties from family and friends. The meetinghouse used by the Yeocomico Baptist Church burned down six months after Carter left; Carter saved an unsigned complaining letter (which he believed from Thruston) that compared the Deed of Gift to fire destroying neighbors' houses.\n\nUpon reaching Baltimore, Carter was told that his son Robert Bladen Carter had died in London, nine days after being assaulted by a city sheriff trying to collect gambling debts. Carter joined the congregation of James Jones Wilmer, an Episcopalian minister receptive to Swedenborg's views, bought a small house on Green Street, and began attending many religious meetings. Before leaving Nomony Hall, Carter locked his books and papers in the library, and gave the only key not to his son J.T., but to a wandering Baptist preacher named Benjamin Dawson. Dawson proved a corrupt debt collector, but a diligent abolitionist, duly securing legal papers from Carter in Baltimore and filing them in Westmoreland and other counties to free slaves. Carter made provision for his relatives, allocating them land, but not the slaves who were the subject of the Deed of Gift. On July 26, 1797, upon learning from Dawson that attorney John Wickham doubted the legal validity of the power of attorney which allowed Dawson to file further manumission papers, Carter executed an agreement selling Dawson his remaining slaves for the nominal sum of a dollar. Dawson duly filed this with the Westmoreland clerk, despite suffering a beating by Carter's son-in-law Spencer Ball.\n\nCarter spent the last decade of his life issuing manumission papers pursuant to his recorded program, writing letters in support of freed slaves whose papers had been stolen, and contemplating religious and political issues. Carter lent money to Baltimore to build its city hall, negotiated with the Bank of the United States, and donated money to refugees from Saint Domingue, who fled the Haitian Revolution]. Carter thought he had lived too long—mourning his daughter Anne's death in childbirth in 1798, and the deaths of Rev. Lunsford and his son-in-law John Maund in Caroline County, Virginia the following year. In 1803, the year before his death, Carter wrote his daughter Harriet L. Maund, \"My plans and advice have never been pleasing to the world.\"\n\nCitizen Robert Carter (as he preferred to be called) died in his sleep, unexpectedly, on March 10, 1804. His son and executor, George, brought the body back to Nomony and buried his father in the garden. The same day that George announced his father's death, he bought slaves for Nomony, in order to replace those his father had freed over his objection.\n\nOn April 3, 1805, Rev. Thruston, acting as judge of Frederick County, Virginia, refused to allow Dawson to record the scheduled deed for emancipation for that year, perhaps because of George Carter's objection. But on March 24, 1808, the Virginia Court of Appeals upheld Dawson's objection, declared the county court had erred, and authorized liberation of the slaves illegally held in bondage. Dawson continued to free sons and daughters born to Carter's slaves after 1791, as did Thomas Buck and John Rust after 1826.\n\n\n\n"}

It is now preserved and operated as a museum by the Lexington Historical Society, with exhibits highlighting the role and perspective of the British soldiers during the outbreak of the war. The house is open for guided tours on weekends starting in April and daily from Memorial Day weekend until the end of October.\n\nThe Munroe family line in America was begun by William Munroe (1625–1719), who was transported to New England in 1651 following his capture at the Battle of Worcester. The earliest part of the Tavern was constructed in 1735 on land then owned by David Comee. Later the proprietor rights were given to others. Another William Munroe (1742–1827), the great-grandson of the original William, purchased the house in 1770, and in October 1774 was granted a taverner's license from the town, shortly before the outbreak of hostilities in April 1775.\n\nOn April 18, 1775, one day before the outbreak of the battle, Munroe Tavern was a meeting spot for colonials, owned by William Munroe, orderly sergeant of Captain John Parker's militia company, and proprietor of the tavern until 1827. At 6:30 p.m. that evening, Solomon Brown of Lexington, who had gone to the market in Boston, returned and reported to Munroe that he had passed a patrol of British soldiers.\nA large force of British troops arrived at Lexington before dawn the next morning, and shots were exchanged on the town common, beginning the Battles of Lexington and Concord. That afternoon the tavern served as the headquarters for Col. Hugh, Earl Percy, and his one thousand reinforcements. The British occupied the tavern for one and one-half hours, during which time the dining room was converted into a field hospital for the wounded, while exhausted British soldiers consumed liberal quantities of food and drink. The troops also shot down John Raymond, an infirm man residing in the family.\n\nPresident George Washington dined at the Munroe Tavern when he visited the Lexington battlefield in 1789. An upstairs room now contains the table at which he sat and documents relating to his trip.\n\nIn the late 19th century, a Munroe descendant who owned the house rented out part of it to artist Edwin Graves Champney (1842–1899). The house was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1976.\n\nThe Lexington Historical Society now employs the Tavern for the Museum of the British Redcoats, providing a view of April 19, 1775 from the perspective of the King's troops. The building underwent renovation and restoration work in 2010–2011.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2202629", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2202629", "title": "Mebendazole", "text": "Mebendazole\n\nMebendazole (MBZ) is a medication used to treat a number of parasitic worm infestations. This includes ascariasis, pinworm disease, hookworm infections, guinea worm infections, hydatid disease, and giardia, among others. It is taken by mouth.\n\nMebendazole is usually well tolerated. Common side effects include headache, vomiting, and ringing in the ears. If used at large doses it may cause bone marrow suppression. It is unclear if it is safe in pregnancy. Mebendazole is a broad-spectrum antihelminthic agent of the benzimidazole type.\nMebendazole came into use in 1971, after it was developed by Janssen Pharmaceutica in Belgium. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Mebendazole is available as a generic medication. The wholesale cost in the developing world is between USD 0.004 and 0.04 per dose. In the United States a single dose is about USD 440.00 as of 2016, while in Australia and the UK it costs about USD 5.00.\n\nMebendazole is a highly effective, broad-spectrum antihelmintic indicated for the treatment of nematode infestations, including roundworm, hookworm, whipworm, threadworm, pinworm, and the intestinal form of trichinosis prior to its spread into the tissues beyond the digestive tract. Other drugs are used to treat worm infections outside the digestive tract, as mebendazole is poorly absorbed into the bloodstream. Mebendazole is used alone in those with mild to moderate infestations. It kills parasites relatively slowly, and in those with very heavy infestations, it can cause some parasites to migrate out of the digestive system, leading to appendicitis, bile duct problems, or intestinal perforation. To avoid this, heavily infested patients may be treated with piperazine, either before or instead of mebendazole. Piperazine paralyses the parasites, causing them to pass in the feces. It is also used rarely in the treatment of cystic echinococcosis, also known as hydatid disease. Evidence for effectiveness for this disease, however, is poor.\n\nMebendazole and other benzimidazole antithelmetics are active against both larval and adult stages of nematodes, and in the cases of roundworm and whipworm, kill the eggs, as well. Paralysis and death of the parasites occurs slowly, and elimination in the feces may require several days.\n\nMebendazole is pregnancy category C, which means it has been shown to cause ill effects in pregnancy in animal models, and no adequate studies of its effects in human pregnancy have been conducted. Whether it can be passed by breastfeeding is unknown.\n\nMebendazole sometimes causes diarrhea, abdominal pain, and elevated liver enzymes. In rare cases, it has been associated with a dangerously low white blood cell count, low platelet count, and hair loss, with a risk of agranulocytosis in rare cases\n\nCarbamazepine and phenytoin lower serum levels of mebendazole. Cimetidine does not appreciably raise serum mebendazole (in contrast to the similar drug albendazole), consistent with its poor systemic absorption.\n\nStevens–Johnson syndrome and the more severe toxic epidermal necrolysis can occur when mebendazole is combined with high doses of metronidazole.\n\nMebendazole works by selectively inhibiting the synthesis of microtubules via binding to colchicine binding site of β-tubulin, thereby blocking polymerisation of tubulin dimers in intestinal cells of parasites. Disruption of cytoplasmic microtubules leads to blocking the uptake of glucose and other nutrients, resulting in the gradual immobilization and eventual death of the helminths.\n\nPoor absorption in digestive tract makes mebendazole an efficient drug for treating intestinal parasitic infections with limited adverse effects. However mebendazole has impact on mammalian cells mostly by inhibiting polymeration of tubulin dimers, thereby disrupting essential microtubule structures such as mitotic spindle. Disassembly of mitotic spindle then leads to apoptosis mediated via dephosphorylation of Bcl-2 which allows pro-apoptotic protein Bax to dimerize and innitiate programmed cell death.\n\nMebendazole is available as a generic medication. Mebendazole is distributed in international markets by Johnson and Johnson and a number of generic manufacturers.\n\nIn the developing world the wholesale cost is between USD 0.004 and 0.04 per dose as of 2014. In the United States a single dose was about USD 18.00 in 2015. In 2016 the price increased to USD 440.00 per dose in the U.S. as Amedra Pharmaceuticals acquired the rights from Teva in 2013.\n\nIn 2010, Amedra also bought the U.S. marketing rights to the only other interchangeable anti-parasitic medication, albendazole, from GSK. The result of these acquisitions created a monopoly on these medications and the price increased dramatically. In 2015 Amedra Pharmaceuticals became a subsidiary of Amneal Pharmaceuticals.\n\nIn Australia and the UK it costs about USD 5.00 per dose.\n\nSeveral studies show mebendazole exhibits potent antitumor properties. MBZ significantly inhibited cancer cell growth, migration, and metastatic formation of adrenocortical carcinoma, both \"in vitro\" and \"in vivo\". Treatment of lung cancer cell lines with MBZ caused mitotic arrest, followed by apoptotic cell death with the feature of caspase activation and cytochrome c release. MBZ induced a dose- and time-dependent apoptotic response in human lung cancer cell lines, and apoptosis via Bcl-2 inactivation in chemoresistant melanoma cells.\nThe anti-cancer effect of mebendazole comes from preclinical studies and case reports.\n"}
