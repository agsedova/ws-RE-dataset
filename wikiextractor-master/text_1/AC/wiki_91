It causes the particle to move towards the area of the weaker field strength, rather than oscillating around an initial point as happens in a homogeneous field. This occurs because the particle sees a greater magnitude of force during the half of the oscillation period while it is in the area with the stronger field. The net force during its period in the weaker area in the second half of the oscillation does not offset the net force of the first half, and so over a complete cycle this makes the particle move towards the area of lesser force.\n\nThe ponderomotive force F is expressed by\nwhich has units of newtons (in SI units) and where \"e\" is the electrical charge of the particle, \"m\" is its mass, \"ω\" is the angular frequency of oscillation of the field, and \"E\" is the amplitude of the electric field. At low enough amplitudes the magnetic field exerts very little force.\n\nThis equation means that a charged particle in an inhomogeneous oscillating field not only oscillates at the frequency of \"ω\" of the field, but is also accelerated by F toward the weak field direction. This is a rare case where the sign of the charge on the particle does not change the direction of the force ((-e)=(+e)).\n\nThe derivation of the ponderomotive force expression proceeds as follows.\n\nConsider a particle under the action of a non-uniform electric field oscillating at frequency formula_5 in the x-direction. The equation of motion is given by:\nneglecting the effect of the associated oscillating magnetic field.\n\nIf the length scale of variation of formula_7 is large enough, then the particle trajectory can be divided into a slow time motion and a fast time motion:\nwhere formula_9 is the slow drift motion and formula_10 represents fast oscillations. Now, let us also assume that formula_11. Under this assumption, we can use Taylor expansion on the force equation about formula_9, to get:\n\nOn the time scale on which formula_10 oscillates, formula_9 is essentially a constant. Thus, the above can be integrated to get:\n\nSubstituting this in the force equation and averaging over the formula_21 timescale, we get,\n\nThus, we have obtained an expression for the drift motion of a charged particle under the effect of a non-uniform oscillating field.\n\nInstead of a single charged particle, there could be a gas of charged particles confined by the action of such a force. Such a gas of charged particles is called plasma. The distribution function and density of the plasma will fluctuate at the applied oscillating frequency and to obtain an exact solution, we need to solve the Vlasov Equation. But, it is usually assumed that the time averaged density of the plasma can be directly obtained from the expression for the force expression for the drift motion of individual charged particles:\n\nwhere formula_25 is the ponderomotive potential and is given by\n\nInstead of just an oscillating field, a permanent field could also be present. In such a situation, the force equation of a charged particle becomes:\n\nTo solve the above equation, we can make a similar assumption as we did for the case when formula_28. This gives a generalized expression for the drift motion of the particle:\n\nThe idea of a ponderomotive description of particles under the action of a time-varying field has applications in areas like:\n\nThe ponderomotive force also plays an important role in laser induced plasmas as a major density lowering factor.\n\n"}

The film is loosely based on the life story of Jean-Claude Romand (though without the criminal element), and it focuses on one of Cantet's favorite subjects: a man's relationship with his job.\n\nThe film received considerable attention internationally and was shown at the Venice Film Festival and Toronto International Film Festival. It was one of the independent films to be featured at the New York Film Festival.\n\nThe film tells the story of Vincent, a middle-aged man who is fired after having spent more than 11 years working for a prestigious consulting firm. Unable to admit to his family that he has been fired, the unemployed former executive continues to pretend he is going to the office every day. In reality, Vincent spends his time aimlessly driving the highways of France and Switzerland, reading papers, or sleeping in his car.\n\nAs time progresses, Vincent invents more and more elaborate lies, throwing himself into a vicious spiral of deceit. To sustain his bourgeois lifestyle, Vincent sets up a Ponzi scheme (an investment scam) and is eventually enlisted into smuggling by career thief Jean-Michel. Murielle, Vincent's wife, after discovering her husband's \"life of lies\" attempts to bring him back into the realm of reality.\n\n\n\"Time Out\" received generally positive reviews from critics. Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 96%, based on 82 reviews, with an average rating of 8/10. The consensus reads, \"A haunting psychological drama, \"Time Out\" takes a penetrating look at the angst of the modern worker.\" At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the film received an average score of 88, based on 30 reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\".\n\nThe film was placed at 99 on \"Slant Magazines \"best films of the 2000s, number 9 of \"The Guardian\"'s best films of the noughties, and number 11 at \"The A.V.

The three were released due to lack of evidence. In April 1972, Sarti was shot to death in Mexico City during a raid of a drug trafficking ring by the Mexican federal police. A detective in Rio de Janeiro was later suspended from the police force after being accused of accepting a bribe to free Sarti and Helena Ferreira, his girlfriend, from jail earlier in 1972. In January 1975, four French citizens alleged to have supplied heroin to Sarti were among a group of 19 indicted by a federal grand jury in Brooklyn.\n\nIn November 1988, Steve J. Rivele's French-published book \"The Murderers of John F. Kennedy\" named Sarti as one of three French gangsters involved in the assassination of John F. Kennedy. Rivele claimed Sarti fired the fatal shot from Dealey Plaza's \"grassy knoll\". According to Rivele, Sarti, Roger Bocagnani, and Sauveur Pironti were contracted by organized crime in the United States to protect their drug interests. The British two-hour television special \"The Men Who Killed Kennedy\" was based on Rivele's book, but preceded its release airing on October 25, 1988. In the French newspaper \"Le Provençal\" published the day following the special, Pironti denied the allegation stating he believed at the time of the assassination that Sarti was held in Marseille's Baumettes Prison and that Bocagnani was in Bordeaux's Fort du Hâ. He also showed the paper military records showing that he was serving on a minesweeper from October 1962 to April 1964. The French Ministry of Justice stated that Bocagnani was in prison on the day of Kennedy's assassination and officials for the French Navy confirmed Pironti's military service.\n\nAfter the death of E. Howard Hunt in 2007, Howard St. John Hunt and David Hunt stated that their father had recorded several claims about himself and others being involved in a conspiracy to assassinate John F. Kennedy. In the April 5, 2007 issue of \"Rolling Stone\", Howard St. John Hunt detailed a number of individuals purported to be implicated by his father including Sarti, as well as Lyndon B. Johnson, Cord Meyer, David Phillips, Frank Sturgis, David Morales, and William Harvey. The two sons alleged that their father cut the information from his memoirs, \"\"American Spy: My Secret History in the CIA, Watergate and Beyond\"\", to avoid possible perjury charges. According to Hunt's widow and other children, the two sons took advantage of Hunt's loss of lucidity by coaching and exploiting him for financial gain. The \"Los Angeles Times\" said they examined the materials offered by the sons to support the story and found them to be \"inconclusive\".\n\n\n\n"}

The route connects Byron with the Atlanta metropolitan area, via McDonough, Stockbridge, and Forest Park.\n\nSR 42 begins at an intersection with SR 49/SR 540 (Peach Parkway) in Byron, in Peach County. It stairsteps its way to the west and northwest, crossing into Crawford County along the way. In Knoxville, it intersects US 80/SR 22 (East Crusselle Street). The three highways head concurrent to the west, into Roberta, where they intersect US 341/SR 7 (South Dugger Avenue). Here, SR 42 leaves the concurrency of US 80/SR 22 and joins the concurrency of US 341/SR 7. The three routes travel to the north-northwest into the town of Musella, where SR 42 splits off to the north-northeast and enters Monroe County. In Dyas is an intersection with SR 74. The route continues to the north-northeast, through rural areas of the county and heads toward Forsyth. Just before entering town, it crosses over Tobesofkee Creek.

However, Malta is non-alcoholic, it has a strong beer smell and flavor and is consumed in the same way as beer or cola in its original carbonated form, and to some extent, iced tea in non-carbonated form.\n\nMalta is often described as being like a beer that has not been fermented. It is similar in color to stout (dark brown) but is slightly sweet, and is generally described as tasting like molasses. Unlike beer, ice is often added to a Malta when consumed. A popular way Africans and Americans sometimes drink is by mixing it with condensed or evaporated milk.\n\nMalta originated in Germany as Malzbier (\"malt beer\"), a malty dark beer whose fermentation was interrupted at approximately 2% ABV, leaving quite a lot of residual sugars in the finished beer. Malzbier in its native form was superseded during the 1960s by its modern form, formulated from water, glucose syrup, malt extract and hops extract, which had been on the market since the latter half of the 19th century, notably in Denmark.\nSuch formulated drinks are called Malztrunk (\"malt beverage\") according to German law, since they are not fermented. In colloquial use, Malzbier has nevertheless remained, along with other nicknames such as Kinderbier (\"children's beer\").\n\nMost Malta is brewed in the Caribbean and can be purchased in areas with substantial Caribbean populations. Aside from the islands of the Caribbean, it is also popular in Caribbean coastal areas such as Curaçao, Aruba, Haiti, Panama, Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic, Colombia, Ecuador, Cuba, Venezuela and Trinidad and Tobago and countries that share a Caribbean coast. Malta is brewed worldwide, and is popular in many parts of Africa like Nigeria which has its own first malt brand - Maltex in 1967. It is also sold in Chad, Ghana, Benin, Cameroon and around the Indian Ocean. Malta Guinness is brewed under licence internationally.\nSome native Malzbiere is available in Germany, notably in Cologne, where the taps of breweries Malzmühle and Sion sell it alongside their traditional Kölsch.\nMany German breweries have a in their range, sometimes produced under licence (for example Vitamalz).\n\nMalta is also occasionally called \"champagne cola\" by some brands. However, there is a separate type of drink with this name, having the flavor of bubble gum. Despite this appellation, neither drink is a champagne or a cola.\n\nDue to its distinctive color, is sometimes known as black brewed beer. In fact, in Chile the word \"malta\" means a Schwarzbier beer.\n\nMalta is high in B vitamins. Some breweries, like Albani Brewery of Denmark, fortify their non-alcoholic beverages with Vitamin B complex. Albani Brewery claims on their website to have been the first brewery to create non-alcoholic malt beverages in 1859.\n\n\n"}

There are an estimated 4,500 such institutions with total enrollments approaching perhaps 2 million.\n\nThe majority of students using virtual campuses to obtain online degrees are adults students for three main reasons:\n\nSchools use a variety of tools for conducting classes – typically called learning management systems (LMS) or course management systems (CMS). CMS may also refer to CONTENT Management Systems.\n\nSome of the aspects that go under virtual campus includes various types of learning activities such as lectures, homework, discussions, readings, assignments. Classes are usually self paced using online documents and databases that might be available to them. Tests and other assignments are available online in specific programs used for online classes. Other methods used in virtual campus are live sessions, videoconferencing, discussing and sharing various applications. Individuals are able to access the materials any time they want under the teacher's control and are able to access anywhere online where they're able to access internet usage. Email is a big part of the virtual campuses and is often used before, during and after sessions. This aids individuals in exchanging information and or point them to the right direction that would be useful in increasing and understanding various methods available to them via documents and online sources.\n\nAlexander et al. conducted a study and found that the use of technology did not in itself result in improvements in the quality of learning but that success depended on the design of the whole learning experience. There are two main models for the virtual campus emerging. The first of these is one in which an educational institution uses communication and information technologies (CITs) to provide all conventional services. In the second model, services are unbundled, with some being sub-contracted to other organizations. Virtual campuses are learner centered, and students can customize their virtual campus to fit their learning styles and preferences thanks to the Internet and telecommunication technologies. Teleconferencing, videoconferencing, computer-based interactive multimedia packages, and various forms of computer mediated communication are technologies that facilitate synchronous delivery of content and real-time interaction between teacher and students as well as opportunities for problem-solving either individually or as a team.\n\n"}

It was acquired by the Thomson Corporation in 2008, forming Thomson Reuters, and moving its head office to Toronto.\n\nReuters Group was best known for the Reuters news agency, which was the original business of the company. By the time of its acquisition by Thomson, the bulk of Reuters Group's revenues came from the provision of financial market data, with news reporting comprising less than 10% of its turnover.\n\nPaul Julius Reuter noticed that, with the electric telegraph, news no longer required days or weeks to travel long distances. In the 1850s, the 34-year-old Reuter was based in Aachen – then in the Kingdom of Prussia, now in Germany – close to the borders with the Netherlands and Belgium. He began using the newly opened Berlin–Aachen telegraph line to send news to Berlin. However, the telegraph did not extend the to Brussels, Belgium's capital city and financial center. Reuter saw an opportunity to speed up news service between Brussels and Berlin by using homing pigeons to bridge that gap.\n\nIn 1851, Reuter moved to London. After failures in 1847 and 1850, attempts by the Submarine Telegraph Company to lay an undersea telegraph cable across the English Channel, from Dover to Calais, promised success. Reuter set up his \"Submarine Telegraph\" office in October 1851 just before the opening of that undersea cable in November, and he negotiated a contract with the London Stock Exchange to provide stock prices from exchanges in continental Europe in return for access to the London prices, which he then supplied to stockbrokers in Paris. In 1865, Reuter's private firm was restructured, and it became a limited company (a corporation) called the Reuter's Telegram Company. Reuter had been naturalised as a British subject in 1857.\n\nReuter's agency built a reputation in Europe for being the first to report news scoops from abroad, such as Abraham Lincoln’s assassination. Almost every major news outlet in the world now subscribes to Reuters' services, which operates in over 200 cities in 94 countries in about 20 languages.\n\nThe last surviving member of the Reuters family founders, Marguerite, Baroness de Reuter, died at age 96 on 25 January 2009, after having suffered a series of strokes.\n\nReuters was financed as a public company in 1984 on the London Stock Exchange and on the NASDAQ in the United States. However, there were concerns that the company's tradition for objective reporting might be jeopardised if control of the company later fell into the hands of a single shareholder. To counter that possibility, the constitution of the company at the time of the stock offering included a rule that no individual was allowed to own more than 15% of the company. If this limit is exceeded, the directors can order the shareholder to reduce the holding to less than 15%. That rule was applied in the late 1980s when Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, which already held around 15% of Reuters, bought an Australian news company that also owned stock in Reuters. Murdoch was subsequently compelled to reduce his holdings to less than 15%.\n\nFurther protecting Reuters from owner actions that might threaten its independence is Reuters Founders Share Company Limited, formed in 1984 as part of the share float. This company's stated mission is to protect the integrity of the company's news output. It holds one \"Founders Share,\" which can veto all other shares if an attempt is made to alter any of the rules relating to the Reuters Trust Principles. These principles set out the company's aims of independence, integrity, and freedom from bias in its news reporting. Subsequent to the forming of Thomson Reuters the trust principles continued, with the RFSC now holding a Founders Share in each of Thomson Reuters Corporation and Thomson Reuters PLC.\n\nReuters grew rapidly after its 1984 IPO, widening the range of its business products and global reporting network for media, financial and economic services. In 1988, Reuters formed a joint-venture with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange to build an automated futures trading system named \"Globex\" at a cost of over US$100 million. Key product launches include Equities 2000 (1987), Dealing 2000-2 (1992), Business Briefing (1994), Reuters Television for the financial markets (1994), 3000 Series (1996) and the Reuters 3000 Xtra service (1999). In the mid-1990s, the Reuters company engaged in a brief foray in the radio sector – with London Radio's two radio stations, London News 97.3 FM and London News Talk 1152 AM. A Reuters Radio News service was also set up to compete with the Independent Radio News. In 1995, Reuters established its \"Greenhouse Fund\" to take minority investments in start-up technology companies, initially in the USA, only. In October 2007, Reuters Market Light, a division of Reuters, launched a mobile phone service for Indian farmers to provide local and customised commodity pricing information, news, and weather updates.\n\nOn 15 May 2007, Canada's The Thomson Corporation acquired Reuters in a deal valued at US$17.6 billion. Thomson controlled about 53 percent of the new company, named Thomson Reuters. Tom Glocer, the former head of Reuters became the CEO of Thomson Reuters. An earlier rule of 15-percent maximum ownership was waived; the reason as given by Pehr Gyllenhammar, the chairman of the Reuters Founders Share Company, as that the \"future of Reuters takes precedence over the principles. If Reuters were not strong enough to continue on its own, the principles would have no meaning.\" citing the recent bad financial performance of the company. The acquisition was closed on 17 April 2008.\n\n\nFrom 1939, corporate headquarters were in London's famous Fleet Street in a building designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens. In 2005, Reuters moved to a larger building in the more modern Canary Wharf. The Reuters Building at 30 South Colonnade is near the One Canada Square tower, Jubilee Park and Canary Wharf tube station. The open space below the Reuters building has since been renamed Reuters Plaza.\n\nThe company's North American headquarters are located in Hoboken, New Jersey. and were previously located at the Reuters Building at 3 Times Square, New York. It is on Seventh Avenue between 42nd and 43rd Streets, and was constructed from 1998 to 2001. The Asian headquarters were located in Singapore, having moved there from Hong Kong ahead of the British handover to China in 1997 (Thomson Reuters retains offices here at ICBC Tower and Cityplaza 3). It had two offices in Singapore, one in the city centre at One Raffles Quay, and another at 18 Science Park Drive next to the National University of Singapore.\n\n\n"}

It is a sequel to \"\" and the third game in the \"Legacy of Kain\" series. Originally developed as a PlayStation and Dreamcast project, it was reworked into a PlayStation 2 and Microsoft Windows title in early production, and was released in 2001. \"Soul Reaver 2\" was followed by two sequels, \"Blood Omen 2\" and \"\", in 2002 and 2003.\n\nThe game continues the adventures of the vampire-turned-wraith Raziel, the protagonist of \"Soul Reaver\". Though Raziel initially seeks to exact revenge on Kain, his murderer and former master, this objective is superseded by a higher quest for knowledge and a desire for freedom, as he finds himself manipulated by those he encounters and begins to learn more about his former life as a human. Traveling through history, he gradually exposes the truth behind his own past and destiny, as he uncovers the history of Nosgoth.\n\nHoping to deliver a more story-focused, cinematic experience than \"Soul Reaver\", Crystal Dynamics researched time travel fiction, theology, and the works of Joseph Campbell when creating \"Soul Reaver 2\"'s narrative. Critics praised the game for its involved storyline, visuals and puzzles, but criticized it for lacking replay value and ending without a definite resolution. Its developers felt the final product fell short of their ambitions, but it performed well commercially, and was included on Sony's \"Greatest Hits\" list.\n\n\"Soul Reaver 2\" is a single-player action-adventure game. The player controls Raziel, a ghostly \"ex-vampire\", from a third-person perspective. Gameplay, which is based on the original \"\", prompts the player to shift between two planes of existence—the material and spectral realms—to progress. The material realm represents the physical, living world, whereas the spectral realm is a warped mirror of this environment. In the spectral realm, the player cannot manipulate objects and weapons, and water is insubstantial. Raziel's health slowly regenerates in the spectral world, whereas it gradually depletes in the material realm. If Raziel runs out of health in the material world, he is shunted into the spectral realm, and if killed in this plane, he returns to the nearest checkpoint. Save points enable players to record their progress and continue their game.\n\nRaziel retains most of the powers he possessed in the previous game, such as the abilities to glide, climb walls, fire bolts of telekinetic energy, and swim. To sustain his strength and travel between the planes, he must devour souls; this is typically accomplished by defeating enemies. The game's combat consists of a hack and slash system, entailing the use of combinations of attacks before executing a finishing move. Human enemies exist only in the material world, and include mercenaries, demon hunters, and the Sarafan, a monastic order of vampire hunters; other material creatures include dogs, thralls, and mutants. Sluagh are enemies who exclusively inhabit the spirit world, whereas cross-planar beings such as demons and shades can pursue the player between both realms. Enemies leave behind souls when killed, which replenish Raziel's health once consumed.\n\nThe player's primary weapon is a ghostly version of the Soul Reaver sword, referred to as the wraith-blade. The wraith-blade is symbiotically bound to Raziel, and can be summoned or dismissed at any time in the material world, but, if overused, the sword can turn against Raziel, siphoning his health. Other weapons include claws, swords and spears. As the game progresses, the player encounters magical forges which imbue the wraith-blade with elemental powers associated with darkness, light, air, and fire. These enhancements have various uses, but are only available in the material realm. If Raziel shifts, he loses his active elemental imbuement, and must re-forge the blade at locations scattered throughout the game world.\n\n\"Soul Reaver 2\" is set in Nosgoth, a fictional land with fantasy aspects. In the first game in the series, \"\", the vampire Kain embarks on a journey to restore the Pillars of Nosgoth—nine supernatural edifices which are inextricably tied to the health of the land, but become corrupted. During his adventure, Moebius, a manipulative sorcerer, tricks Kain into orchestrating the destruction of the vampire race: Kain is left the last surviving vampire in Nosgoth. After restoring eight of the Pillars, Kain discovers that he would need to sacrifice his own life to restore the final corrupt one. Realizing that his death would ensure the annihilation of his species, he refuses to kill himself. This triggers the Pillars' collapse, and dooms the world to eternal decay, but enables Kain to live on and revive the vampire race.\n\nBy the time of \"Soul Reaver\", 1500 years later, Kain is a despotic emperor, his vampires dominate the land, and Nosgoth hinges on the brink of collapse. The Elder God, a demiurge-like entity, lurks beneath Nosgoth and controls the cycle of reincarnation; the vampires, whose biological immortality opposes his doctrine, are his enemies. In \"Soul Reaver\", Raziel—Kain's lieutenant—is executed by Kain, but The Elder God resurrects him and encourages him to exact revenge. Traversing the wasteland and murdering the vampires, Raziel confronts Kain, who attacks him with the Soul Reaver sword, imbued with a spirit which absorbs its victims' souls. The Soul Reaver shatters when it strikes Raziel, and the blade's spirit binds itself to his arm. His motives still mysterious, Kain lures Raziel through a time portal into Nosgoth's past.\n\nIn \"Soul Reaver 2\", it is established that, in Nosgoth, fatalism is an actuality—history is immutable, and all individuals are subject to predestination. Raziel, due to his paradoxical destiny, is the only exception to this rule—his presence enables temporal paradoxes to be triggered, altering history for better or worse. Kain relies on Raziel's free will in a bid to outsmart Moebius and resolve the dilemma he faced in \"Blood Omen\", ultimately hoping to enable both the restored Pillars and the vampire race to co-exist in the future. \"Soul Reaver 2\" opens as Raziel emerges from the time slip and is greeted by Moebius, having arrived in an era 30 years prior to the events of \"Blood Omen\". Two further time periods, 100 years after and 500 years before \"Blood Omen\" respectively, are also explored as the story progresses.\n\nRaziel returns as the protagonist of \"Soul Reaver 2\". In \"Soul Reaver\", Raziel discovered that he was once a human and a leading member of the vampire-hunting Sarafan brotherhood, and his epiphanies drive the conflict in the story. Kain, the antagonist of \"Soul Reaver\", appears as a non-player character in cutscenes, urging Raziel to unearth his destiny. Moebius the Time Streamer, a sorcerer who was a villain in \"Blood Omen\" and had a cameo at the end of \"Soul Reaver\", is a primary antagonist of \"Soul Reaver 2\" who attempts to manipulate Raziel into destroying Kain—it is revealed that he is an agent of The Elder God, Raziel's ally and guide in \"Soul Reaver\", who is slowly established as a more sinister entity. Ariel, a specter bound to the Pillars who featured in \"Blood Omen\" and \"Soul Reaver\", returns, and the vampire Vorador, also from \"Blood Omen\", assists Raziel early in the game. The ancient vampire Janos Audron, a new character who was previously only mentioned in \"Blood Omen\", acts as Raziel's mentor towards the end of the story.\n\nThe game begins by summarizing \"Soul Reavers ending: Raziel confronts Kain in Nosgoth's wasteland, and pursues him through a portal leading to the past. Moebius, the leader of a vampire-hunting crusade in this age, coerces Raziel to re-embrace his former heritage as a Sarafan vampire hunter by killing Kain. Though Raziel is initially eager to do so, his enthusiasm wanes over time as he witnesses the ruthlessness of Moebius's soldiers. Kain, who is destined to die at Raziel's hands in this era, implores Raziel to thwart fate and instead facilitate his quest to restore the Pillars. After he learns that Moebius serves The Elder God, and that he has thus been duped, Raziel faces a decision: indulge his lust for vengeance but submit to fate by killing Kain, or defy his cohorts and exercise his free will by exerting mercy.\n\nWhile exploring this period, Raziel discovers evidence that two ancient races waged war in Nosgoth's distant past. One race created the Pillars to banish their adversaries, but the enemy race—the Hylden—retaliated with a curse which transformed the Pillars' architects into the first vampires. Kain explains that, had he sacrificed himself, the vampire race—the rightful inheritors of the Pillars—would have become extinct. Raziel chooses to spare Kain, causing a paradox; history reshuffles itself to accommodate the extension of Kain's life. He, however, refuses to indulge Kain's plans any further, instead opting to explore his own past. Vorador tells Raziel that the last of the ancient vampires, Janos Audron, held the key to Raziel's destiny, but Janos was murdered by the Sarafan five centuries ago.\n\nDeciding to speak with Janos, Raziel orders Moebius to send him further back in time. Moebius deceives Raziel, instead conveying him over a century into the future, where he and The Elder God highlight the consequences of the Pillars' destruction to turn Raziel against Kain. Raziel navigates the future era and finds his own way back to the age of the Sarafan and Janos Audron. There, Janos presents Raziel with the Reaver, a younger version of the physical Soul Reaver blade which will later house a soul-devouring spirit. Suddenly, a group of Sarafan led by Raziel's former, human self launch an ambush, and Janos sacrifices himself. Raziel swears vengeance as Janos dies, and pursues the attackers. He uses the Reaver to kill them and his younger self, renouncing his Sarafan past.\n\nThe wraith-blade attached to Raziel's arm, over-aroused after the deaths of the Sarafan, suddenly seizes control of the physical Reaver, and impales Raziel; Raziel, horrified, then realizes his destiny. He himself has always been the ravenous spirit inside the Reaver, and therefore is fated to be stuck in a time loop; the sword shattered against him in \"Soul Reaver\" because it was unable to consume itself. While his soul is being drawn into the sword, Kain emerges and tears the Reaver from Raziel's body, saving him in reciprocation and forcing history to reshuffle again. However, this paradox strains Nosgoth's history too far, enabling the Hylden to return and jeopardize his ambition to restore the Pillars. Amidst Kain's dismay, Raziel realizes that the wraith-blade is still bound to him, and laments that his destiny has not been changed, but merely .\n\nEven before the release of \"Soul Reaver\", Crystal Dynamics were aware that they would create a follow-up, but had no \"master plan\". \"Soul Reaver\" uses the engine of \"\". Prior to the beginning of development, director Amy Hennig emphasized that the role-playing game elements of \"Blood Omen\", stronger dialogue and character interaction, a greater variety of acquirable mechanics, and wider use of the spectral realm should figure into the sequel. Pre-production began in late 1999, and the project briefly entered development for the PlayStation and Dreamcast with a targeted release date in fall of 2000. The team was given approval to switch to the PlayStation 2 after creating a proof-of-concept demo for E3 2000, and the game was announced as an console exclusive title for the PlayStation 2, dropping the Dreamcast and original PlayStation versions in the process. Executive producer Andrew Bennett analogized the developers' design sensibilities to the non-linear nature of Nintendo's \"The Legend of Zelda\" and \"Mario\" franchises, but said it was decided that \"Soul Reaver 2\" would not be a \"traditional 'complete a level, fight a boss' type of game\". Level designers constructed a generalized puzzle and object-interaction system, helping to prevent an undesired re-emergence of \"Soul Reaver\"'s abundant block puzzles. Instead of creating more inherent and optional abilities for Raziel, they focused on including new, mandatory enhancements for the Soul Reaver weapon.\n\nOn the decision to downplay Raziel's quest for vengeance against Kain in this sequel, Hennig explained, \"he's being pretty simple-minded, he's sort of being very black-and-white in his interpretation of things, and being kind of petulant [...] he's not really as heroic as Kain is, and he has a lot of stuff to figure out, basically, about what's going on\". \"Soul Reaver 2\" was crafted to feature a more cinematic, story-focused experience than its predecessor, which the developers felt had been \"patchy\" in this regard. It entered production after \"Blood Omen 2\", but shipped almost six months before the latter game. A separate team within Crystal Dynamics, with creative autonomy, developed \"Blood Omen 2\", and contradictions created by its scenario hindered work on \"Soul Reaver 2\". After researching time travel fiction, Hennig devised a subplot concerning temporal paradoxes to resolve the continuity problems between both titles, and established that \"Blood Omen 2\"'s story is a product of the final paradox created when Kain saves Raziel at the end of \"Soul Reaver 2\". Other themes were inspired by the works of Joseph Campbell, and theology surrounding Gnosticism. Concepts which formulated the crux of the story included the idea \"that the only way a hero can ever succeed is by following his own path\", and the question, \"can you change history or not? And if so, what does it mean to change history - in terms of being responsible for the repercussions?\"\n\nBritish comic book writer Paul Jenkins was drafted by Crystal Dynamics to help refine the game's script. Though \"Soul Reaver\" features a variety of boss encounters, \"Soul Reaver 2\" does not; this was a conscious decision on the part of the staff, to ensure the game's pacing more closely emulated that of a novel or a film, although near the end of the game, the Sarafan commanders including Raziel's human self are considered somewhat as a \"bosses\" since they are more challenging than the usual enemies during the game. While expanding the series' fiction, Hennig sought to take people back to the characters and mythology of the original \"Blood Omen\", and built on its latent themes, including issues of fatalism, ethical dilemma and morality. In an interview, she stated that \"the game will have a proper ending this time\", and said \"it has a conclusion. It's the end of a chapter. There won't be a cliffhanger\". However, the story needed to be restructured several times before its completion, and, like the original \"Soul Reaver\", many planned areas and abilities were excised, including three elemental forges (earth, water and spirit), more Reaver enhancements, and nine \"spell-type things\". She explained that the project's small programming crew, its switch to the PlayStation 2, and its limited 17 month production schedule had forced the team to \"pick their battles\", leading numerous features to be simplified or eliminated. Commenting on the final product, lead designer Richard Lemarchand said that \"Soul Reaver 2\" \"fell short of what the team had wanted to accomplish. In particular, some puzzles were too opaque, the combat was rather one-dimensional, [and the story] ended without a decent resolution\".\n\n\"Soul Reaver 2\" was composed by Kurt Harland, of American band Information Society, and Jim Hedges. Harland and Hedges had already collaborated on \"Soul Reaver\", but Hedges had not previously contributed compositions. The adaptive audio framework from the previous game returned; depending on signals from the game in certain situations—such as combat, puzzles, danger or suspense—the game's soundtrack actively changes. Music from both \"Soul Reaver\" and \"Soul Reaver 2\" was released on a promotional soundtrack in 2001.\n\nGordon Hunt returned as the game's recording director, with Kris Zimmerman as casting director. Voice actors from both \"Blood Omen\" and \"Soul Reaver\" reprised their roles, with Michael Bell playing Raziel and Simon Templeman portraying Kain. The Elder God was again voiced by Tony Jay, Richard Doyle voiced Moebius, and Anna Gunn played Ariel. Paul Lukather, absent from \"Soul Reaver\", rejoined the cast as Vorador. René Auberjonois, the only newcomer to the \"Legacy of Kain\" series, provided the voice of Janos Audron.\n\nPublisher Eidos Interactive was \"broadly satisfied\" with the commercial performance of \"Soul Reaver 2\", which sold more than 500,000 copies by June 2002. Later, Sony re-released it under the \"Greatest Hits\" label. Shortly after the initial PlayStation 2 release in October 2001, the Microsoft Windows port shipped, developed by Nixxes Software BV. The PlayStation 2 release featured bonus material, including voice casting outtakes, artworks, a soundtrack, trailers, the game's dialogue script, and a compilation of Nosgoth's history. In 2012, digital distribution services GOG.com and Steam made the Windows port of \"Soul Reaver 2\" available for purchase.\n\nOn the PlayStation 2, \"Soul Reaver 2\" respectively received an aggregate score of 81% and 80/100 from rating websites GameRankings and Metacritic. Various reviewers held its storytelling, visuals and sound in high regard, but described its gameplay as dull and unsatisfying. Doug Perry of IGN praised the game's dark atmosphere and intriguing story, but said that it can become tiresome and drag on. He thought the \"haughtiness\" and drama of the dialogue, particularly between Raziel and Kain, was often overdone, and noted that its gameplay was near identical to that of its predecessor but with less replay value. Perry enjoyed the new puzzles involving the elemental powers of the Reaver for being more complex and diverse than the block puzzles of \"Soul Reaver\", and praised the combat system. He gave the game a score of 9.0, but in his later review for \"Defiance\", he revised his opinion, saying this rating was \"way too high\" and \"that game told a great story, but just didn't deserve that score\".\n\nJoe Fielder of GameSpot gave \"Soul Reaver 2\" a score of 8.8 and called it an excellent sequel, again praising the change to elemental puzzles and the combat system, but criticizing the dearth of sidequests and boss fights, and the lack of definite resolution to the storyline. \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\"'s reviewer said that it triumphed as an aesthetic showcase, but deemed its gameplay mediocre and unappealing. The reviewer for \"Game Informer\" regarded \"Soul Reaver 2\" as \"quite engrossing\". Star Dingo of \"GamePro\" similarly praised its graphics, sound design and voice acting, but condemned missed creative opportunities concerning the potential of the spectral realm and time travel, saying that the game \"takes as many steps back as it does forward, and ends up teetering precariously over the brink of being a disappointment\". The review concurred with IGN that the plot and dialogue, though entertaining, sometimes bordered on pretentiousness, and Game Revolution's Duke Ferris repeatedly compared the story to a soap opera.\n\nOther critics, such as GameZone's Michael Lafferty, were less reserved in their praise of the narrative—\"The Electric Playground\" referred to it as \"a textbook example to other console developers on how to write videogame prose\"—but agreed that its complex and involved backstory could alienate some players. Journalists also commonly cited \"Soul Reaver 2\"'s poor lifespan and replayability as an issue; the reviewer for \"Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine\" opined that \"the problem is that there just isn't much gameplay there\" and Fielder warned that play \"burns bright, but not as long as you'd like\". \n\nJim Preston reviewed the PlayStation 2 version of the game for \"Next Generation\", rating it four stars out of five, and stated that \"Perhaps a little too rococo for our tastes, \"Soul Reaver 2\" is nonetheless an absorbing and expertly crafted game.\"\n"}

She attended Fitch Middle School in Seaside, California, at the time of her abduction. Before moving to California, Williams and her family lived at Yokosuka Naval Base in Japan. It was the first time the family had lived in the mainland United States.\n\nWilliams left her home at around 7:30 p.m. PDT. Greg returned home an hour later trailing his leash. The case attracted widespread, national media attention.\n\nExactly seven months later, a body was found on the former Fort Ord Army Base about from the Williams' home on January 12, 1999. The remains were positively identified as those of Williams. The area where she was found had been searched previously, but nothing had been found. The person who found Williams' body was a botanist from University of California, Santa Cruz who was conducting a scientific survey.\n\nSketches of people suspected of the abduction, a man in his late teens and one in his early twenties, were widely released in the media but they did not help identification of the suspects.\n\nSeveral celebrities, including Clint Eastwood, Mariah Carey, and Reggie Jackson, made a public service announcement for Williams. Her case was also aired on \"America's Most Wanted\". Williams was survived by her parents and two siblings. Many people, including Williams' former friends in Japan, were affected by her abduction. Her family later moved to Florida. Investigators focused their efforts on finding a 1980s Mercury Monarch or Ford Granada car. In 2006, the still-open case was featured on \"CNN\"'s \"Anderson Cooper 360°\". Up to US $100,000 has been offered for information leading to those responsible for her death.\n\nThe City of Marina erected a memorial in Williams' honor located at 15520 Imjin Road, across from Preston Park. At University of California, Berkeley a scholarship in her name was established by a philanthropist.\n\nIt was reported that Charles Holifield was a suspect in Williams' murder. He remains in prison for attempted kidnapping; he had raped teenage girls in the past. In 2011, an ex-girlfriend of Holifield recanted an alibi for Holifield she made in 1998, saying she had previously been threatened with harm if she withdrew it. In 2016, DNA found on Williams' clothing was found to match Holifield's DNA. On April 6, 2017 the District Attorney of Monterey County announced that Holifield would be arrested and charged with the murder. A death penalty trial for Holifield was originally set for October 2019 but was delayed. On December 2019, Holifield waved his right to a trail by jury, in order to remove the possibility of receiving the death penalty; in addition Holifield waved his rights to writs and appeals. On Monday, March 2, the non-jury trial began; on Monday, 16 March the defense team began their portion of the trial. On Friday March 20, Judge Pamela Butler found Holifield guilty of the murder of Williams, with two special circumstances; he was sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.\n\n\n"}

It is the largest non-profit classical music station in the country and the only classical radio station in the Greater Los Angeles Area. \n\nThe station was one of the first radio stations to operate on the FM band when it officially signed on using the frequency of 91.7 on December 5, 1946.. Its primary benefactor was George Allan Hancock. It operated out the Hancock Foundation building on the USC campus and broadcast from a 250 foot tower above the building.\n\nIn the 1970s the station adopted a rock format. On April 2, 1973 new station manager Wally Smith oversaw the return to the all classical station. In 1976 the station's transmitter was placed on Lookout Mountain above the Hollywood sign. In 1993 tower was erected near Mount Wilson. In 1996 Smith left the station after changing the format to talk, classical, jazz, folk and world music (he would go on to develop WPBB).\n\nIn 2010 it moved its broadcast studio to the USC Building in downtown Los Angeles.\n\nIn February 2014, public radio station KCRW of Santa Monica announced that it would buy the Santa Barbara Foundation's classical station KDB (FM) 93.7 in Santa Barbara for $1 million.

{"id": "2171608", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2171608", "title": "Santa Maria, Laguna", "text": "Santa Maria, Laguna\n\n', officially the ', (), is a in the province of , . According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nFrom Mabitac was a mountain path pointed northward leading to a village called Caboan. On this path near the village gateway gathers people and Chinese merchants selling and buying wares, livestock and other farm produce. Aetas sell their herbs, medicinal rootstocks, and wild honey. Women from Mabitac trade chickens with clay pots, pandan mats, and sabutan hats. It was a market place.\n\nCaboan came from the Tagalog word “Kabuhuan,” which means bamboo thicket. “Buho,” is a genus of bamboo, which grows abundantly in the village. Caboan is a miracle of nature. Rare orchids and wild flowers decorated its forests. Its falls called “Ambon-ambon” located in one corner of the village looks like a stair of giant rocks going up to heaven. Its Nilubugan River was rich in exquisite white rocks and stones and its crystal-clear water seems to drift to nowhere.\nThis village used to be a part of the province of Morong. Padre Antonio de la Llave was the first parish priest of Caboan. Residents believe that he was the one responsible for making the village a town and in renaming it into \"San Miguel de Caboan\" in 1602.\n\nA legend tells the story of how San Miguel de Caboan became Santa María. The story says that a couple going home from the market place after trading their vegetable harvest with their basic needs, found lying on the ground an image of the blessed virgin. At first, they thought it was a porcelain piece dropped by a Chinese merchant. Porcelain was a very expensive commodity during the period as it is today. After careful examination, they recognized the image as that of the Virgin Mary. The couple made an altar in their house and enthroned the image there.\n\nThe next morning the couple was astonished. The image was gone. They looked for the image all over, until they decided to look at the place where they found it. They saw a group of women, poking with a long stick something on the ground that looked like a piece of ivory. It was the image of the Virgin. It was back at the very spot where they found it.\n\nIn 1613, Padre Geronimo Vásquez built the first church on the spot where the couple found the image of the Virgin. Thus, San Miguel de Cabuoan became Santa María de los Ángeles, in short — Santa María. The Chinese uprising in 1639 destroyed the church. Parishioners rebuilt it in 1669, before the earthquake of 1880 leveled it again to the ground. Padre Leopoldo Arellano raised it once more in 1891. The facade of the church is still surviving and is now known as the Nuestra Señora delos Angeles Parish Church. The church was again partly destroyed during the earthquake of August 20, 1937, but was not reconstructed until after the Liberation in 1945.\n\nThe first and patronal name of Santa Maria was San Miguel de Caboan. San Miguel was the name given by the Spanish friar who founded the town. It originated from the first patron named San Miguel Arcanghel. Caboan came from the native term \"kabuhuan\", a kind of bamboo abundant in the place during that time. The first church was built in the same place where the present church is erected. It was then made of cogon and bamboo. There was also the first Parochial school ran by Spanish friars. According to information, Catholic faith was well embraced by the people. It was believed that the people of this town had always been good and loyal followers. No remarkable Spanish relics could be traced in this town nowadays. It is only the facade of the church in which traces of Spanish culture could be seen as shown by the materials in which it was made of. That one could distinguish that there had been such regime in this town. However, folk tales on \"Bailes and Comparsas\" could still be heard among elders.\n\nWhen the Philippines was ceded to the United States of America by Spain, the Filipinos realized that they were under another authority for the second time. The people of Santa Maria were at first confused of the new kind of life. So, whenever they heard that Americans were coming, men went up the mountains to evade membership to the American Army. This according to them was due to their sad experience with the Spanish rule.\n\nThe people of Santa Maria were so afraid of the new policies they might encounter. Whenever they heard that Americans would be coming to town, all men in the family went up the mountains and hide. Until the time came when they realized that Americans were far better than the Spaniards when they were given our independence on June 12, 1898.\n\nThrough the provisions of the Otis Commission, Santa Maria then became a barrio of Mabitac, its neighboring town.\nIn the year 1903, through the Governor General's Proclamation, Santa Maria was declared a separate municipality.\n\nThe United States Congress passed a law which granted the Philippine Government the right to give the public lands to persons who wanted to cultivate them. This will become the policy of attraction of the late Municipal President Antonio D. Aguja. Large tracts of public land were opened for agricultural purposes. This cause the influx of settlers from the neighboring towns and provinces then, the development of agriculture as well as the establishment of the different barrios began. People were encouraged to apply for homestead. More lands were given to the landless. The U.S. Congress helped much in the agricultural development of the country soon after peace was declared.\n\nMany farms were abandoned and locust destroyed the crops planted in the place. The U.S. Government aided the people through importing rice to the countries.\n\nWork animals also brought in to improve the animal resources in the country. The Bureau of Agriculture was established. The farmers were taught better farming methods and control of plant pest and diseases. Road and transportation were improved. The different means of communications such as radio telegraph, and postal services were introduced and modernized.\n\nThe town of Santa Maria was benefited by these changes. Jazz and rhumba music took the Philippine air.\n\nGuerilla warfare was carried on different places in the barrios and mountains. There were also attacks made at the poblacion where there were Japanese garrisons.\n\nThe guerilla units who helped the natives of Santa Maria were Marking's Filipino-American ROTC Hunters and V-J units. Their aim was to fight for freedom against the Japanese forces. The people in this town helped these units in terms of food, clothing and cash.\n\nThere were great incident that took place in this town during the regime. The guerilla troop with the leadership of Martin Bautista, a native of this town invaded the Japanese headquarters which was located at the oldest school building. Some civilians were badly hurt. Several houses near the school building were destroyed. Another unforgettable incident that happened in 1942 was when Captain Nacamura, a high-ranking official of the Japanese Imperial Army, was killed. He and his men encountered the guerillas at Barrio Kayhacat. After his death, the natives of Santa Maria witnessed the ceremonial burning of his dead body. The people believed that the ash will be sent to his family. Another Japanese official who was killed was Captain Sakai. He was killed outside the town of Santa Maria by Colonel Pabling, a native of Antipolo, Rizal. One system made by the sponsored Republic of Japan to counteract guerilla was the zone system, where all male inhabitants suspected of being a guerilla were kept in the church without food, little water and tortured or massacred. Ponciano \"Sabu\" Arida of Santa Maria was the youngest guerilla in the country. He was only eleven (11) years old when he made some heroic deeds in our town. He was the runner of the guerilla spy and supply officer. In 1944, Alyas Capadudia, a HUKBALAHAP (Hukbong Bayan Laban sa Hapon) encountered the Japanese Army at Barrio Bubucal. Some guerillas died in this fight and Japanese burned several houses.\n\nOn January 2, 1942, the Japanese Military Administration was established headed by Director General. All public officials in the town were ordered to stay at their post. Civil liberties of the people were suppressed. Economy was geared to the demands of the occupying forces. Education was revamped to reorient Filipino thinking along Japanese lines. Political life was limited to the Japanese. Jose P. Laurel was appointed the President of the Japanese sponsored Republic. Japanese did not allow any political parties except the KALIBAPI. Land farm products, commerce, transportation and prime commodities were ceased. Japanese restricted freedom of movement of the Filipinos. Social activities in and out of town were very few. Orientation classes were held to spread Japanese culture. Niponggo, the Japanese language, was taught in all schools as well as in government and private officers.\n\nRehabilitation began little by little after the liberation. Aids and war damages arrived painting a new the town. Schools were open, bridges were rebuilt, roads were constructed and the economy of the people was gradually elevated. Adoption of the policies of a newly independent nation was at last accepted by the people.\n\nAt present, the Municipality of Santa Maria, situated in the Province of Laguna, having 25 barangays and possessing a population of more than 30,000, faces numerous challenges for the future. Being agricultural town and having a big land area, the place promises to be one of the quality producing citrus in Southern Tagalog. It has also been named as the \"Rice Granary of Laguna\". Endowed with agricultural lands, the place calls for knowledgeable agriculturist, soil technologist and the like to help develop and improve more of its undeveloped areas. At present, there is also a need for more doctors, lawyers and other kinds of professionals who are really native of the town to really look for the welfare of the people. There is a lack of these careers at present that the town folks still go to other places whenever the need arises. This is one of the great challenges that the people looks forward too.\n\nSanta Maria is the northernmost town in Laguna.\n\nBounded by the provinces of Rizal and Quezon from the western portion up to the northern tip down north eastern part, the town has a mountainous terrain. With the MARILAQUE Sub-Regional Plan (Manila-Rizal-Laguna-Quezon), the municipality functions as link between the highly industrialized capital and the marine life-rich Quezon province. A 43 kilometer road network, the Marcos Highway, physically connects to the eyed site for the International Port. Silangan Railway Express 2000 (MARILAQUE Railway) is another infrastructure project proposed for implementation under the PPP Scheme.\n\nSanta María is politically subdivided into 25 barangays: Among these barangays, 6 are classified as highland/upland barangays, 12 are inland barangays, while the remaining 7 are situated in the lowland (poblacion area).\n\nIn the , the population of Santa Maria, Laguna, was people, with a density of .\n\nElected officials (2016 elections):\n\n"}

The Division was proclaimed at the redistribution of 13 September 1922, and was first contested at the 1922 federal election.\n\nCentred on Mosman and the Northern Beaches region of Sydney, it covers most of the land between Middle Harbour and the Tasman Sea. It extends from Port Jackson in the south to the suburb of Dee Why in the north.

The Liberals and their predecessors held the seat without interruption from its creation in 1922 until the 2019 federal election when Zali Steggall won the seat as an independent. Even by northern Sydney standards, Warringah has been especially unfriendly territory for Labor. For example, even in its 1943 landslide, Labor was only able to garner 39 percent of the two-party vote in Warringah; Labor has never won more than 40.5 percent of the two-party vote in any election for this seat. \n\nBefore 2019, the area covered by Warringah had been held by a conservative party without interruption since Federation; most of its territory had been part of North Sydney from 1901 to 1922. \n\nThe seat's most notable member was Tony Abbott, who won the seat at a 1994 by-election and served as Prime Minister of Australia from 2013 to 2015. He retained Warringah until being defeated by Steggall in 2019. That election also saw Warringah become a notional marginal seat in a \"traditional\" two-party contest against Labor for the first time; Abbott would have held the seat on 52.1 percent against Labor, down from 61 percent in 2016.\n"}

Produced by Threshold Entertainment and Film Roman, it aired on the USA Network's Action Extreme Team animation block for one season of thirteen episodes from September to December 1996, back-to-back with the \"Street Fighter\" animated series. The show serves as a combination of an alternative sequel to the first \"Mortal Kombat\" film and the events of \"Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3\".\n\nThe show was focused on a group of warriors assembled by Raiden (spelled Rayden in the series) to defend Earthrealm from invaders who entered through portals from various other dimensions. The assembled warriors included Liu Kang, Stryker, Sonya Blade, Jax, Kitana, and Sub-Zero, with Nightwolf functioning mostly as tech support but still entering the fray on various occasions. The warriors operated out of a hidden base from where Nightwolf and Rayden monitored portal openings; the warriors would fly dragon-shaped jets to deal with disturbances. Shao Kahn was something of an archvillain throughout the series despite appearing in only four of the series' thirteen episodes, being responsible for allowing other realms to invade Earthrealm.\n\nThe characters and their backgrounds were mostly continuous with the movie and Threshold's representation of the series canon, though many original characters exclusive to the program were introduced and some elements of \"Mortal Kombat 3\" were included. The episode plots themselves shared little relation with that of any of the games, though the character designs are based on their \"MK3\" and \"Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3\" sprites (except for Kitana, whose design looks like a blend of her \"MKII\" and her \"UMK3\" looks). Kung Lao, Johnny Cage, Mileena, Sindel, Goro and Kintaro were not shown or referenced in the show at all, while characters based on Reptile, Baraka, and Jade were featured.\n\nThe finale involved Kitana leading a rebellion from Outworld against Kahn. The most notable aspect of the show was that it provided the debut of Quan Chi, who would go on to become a major antagonist in the game series.\n\n\nThe episode 9, “Resurrection“ is part 3 of a 4-episode crossover with several other shows that aired as part of the US “Action Extreme Team\" programming block:\n\n\nThree volumes of 12 episodes (excluding \"Sting of the Scorpion\") were released in the UK, while in Australia, the complete series was released across six volumes. The complete series was also released on a two-DVD set in Russia, containing both Russian and English dubbing. Brazil has also received a three-disc DVD set, with a new Brazilian Portuguese dub and original English audio. In the United States, only a select number of episodes were individually available on VHS, while there was never a DVD release.\n\n\"Defenders of the Realm\" received a negative response from viewers and critics, and was canceled after only one season. In 2011, 1UP.com featured the series in the article \"The Top Ten Times \"Mortal Kombat\" Went Wrong,\" calling it \"a terrible, one-liner-packed train wreck of a kids' show.\" The site also included the show among their list of the top five \"Not-So-Classic Video Game Cartoons\" while quoting the introduction's opening line: \"'Much has changed since the last Mortal Kombat tournament!' Yeah, like nobody being allowed to kill each other anymore.\" GameFront called it an \"abomination.\" GamesRadar included the series among their picks for the worst video game-based animated TV shows. \"Not content with skimping on violence, the show's creators felt that they also needed to ... teach the youth of America life lessons with comically cheesy public service announcements.\" Dorkly rated it sixth in their list of the top eight worst animated video game TV adaptations, citing the lack of violence as a contributor to its demise.\n\n\n"}

Tramp! Tramp!\" and \"The Battle Cry of Freedom\". He is regarded as the first American to compose a secular cantata.\n\nRoot was born at Sheffield, Massachusetts, and was named after the German composer George Frideric Handel. Root left his farming community for Boston at 18, flute in hand, intending to join an orchestra. He worked for a while as a church organist in Boston, and from 1845 taught music at the New York Institute for the Blind, where he met Fanny Crosby, with whom he would compose fifty to sixty popular secular songs.\n\nIn 1850 he made a study tour of Europe, staying in Vienna, Paris, and London. He returned to teach music in Boston, Massachusetts as an associate of Lowell Mason, and later Bangor, Maine, where he was director of the Penobscot Musical Association and presided over their convention at Norumbega Hall in 1856.\n\nFrom 1853-1855, Root helped Lowell Mason and William Bradbury establish the New York Normal Musical Institute, which served as a school for aspiring music educators. From 1855 on, Root would spend most of his summers traveling and teaching at music education conventions throughout New England. He applied a version of Pestalozzi's teaching (although misunderstood by both Root and Mason) and was instrumental in developing mid- and late-19th century American musical education. He was a follower of the teachings of Emanuel Swedenborg.\n\nOn his return from Europe, Root began composing and publishing sentimental popular songs, a number of which achieved fame as sheet-music, including those with Fanny Crosby: \"The Hazel Dell\", \"Rosalie the Prairie Flower\", \"There's Music in the Air\" and others, which were, according to Root's \"New York Times\" obituary, known throughout the country in the antebellum period. Root chose to employ the pseudonym Wurzel (German for Root) to capitalize on the popularity of German composers during the 1850s, and to keep his identity as a serious composer against his composition of minstrel and popular songs.\n\nBesides his popular songs, he also composed gospel songs in the Ira Sankey vein, and collected and edited volumes of choral music for singing schools, Sunday schools, church choirs and musical institutes. Root assisted William Bradbury in compiling \"The Shawm\" in 1853, a collection of hymn tunes and choral anthems, featuring the cantata \"Daniel: or the Captivity and Restoration\". The cantata was a collaboration between Root and Bradbury musically, with text by Fanny Crosby and C.M. Cady.\n\nHe also composed various sacred and secular cantatas including the popular \"The Haymakers\" (1857). Root's cantatas were popular on both sides of the Atlantic throughout the 19th century. His first cantata, \"The Flower Queen: or The Coronation of the Rose\", was composed in 1851 with libretto by Fanny Crosby, and gained immediate success in singing schools across the United States.\"The Flower Queen\" has been regarded as the first secular cantata written by an American. \nBuilding on his talent for song-writing, Root moved to Chicago, Illinois in 1859 to work for his brother's music publishing house of Root & Cady. He became particularly successful during the American Civil War, as the composer of martial songs such as \"Tramp! Tramp! Tramp!\" \"(The Prisoner's Hope)\", \"The Vacant Chair\" (with lyrics by Henry S. Washburn, about the death of John William Grout), \"Just before the Battle, Mother\", and \"The Battle Cry of Freedom\". He wrote the first song concerning the war, \"The First Gun is Fired\", only two days after the conflict began with the bombardment of Fort Sumter. He ultimately had at least 35 war-time \"hits\", in tone from the bellicose to the ethereal. His songs were played and sung at both the home front and the real front. \"Tramp, Tramp, Tramp\" became popular on troop marches, and \"Battle Cry of Freedom\" became well-known even in England.\n\nAfter the war, he was elected as a 3rd Class (honorary) Companion of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States. Root's songs, particularly \"The Battle Cry of Freedom\", were popular among Union soldiers during the war. According to Henry Stone, a Union war veteran recalling in the late 1880s:\n\nRoot was awarded the degree of Musical Doctor by the first University of Chicago in 1872. He died at his summer home in Bailey Island, Maine, at the age of 74. He was buried at the Harmonyvale Cemetery in North Reading, Massachusetts. \n\nRoot was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1970.\n\n\"Tramp, Tramp, Tramp, the Boys are Marching\" provided the tune for the later \"Jesus Loves the Little Children\", with lyrics by C. Herbert Woolston, and also for the later \"God Save Ireland\". \"The Vacant Chair\" provided a tune reused in \"Life's Railway to Heaven\", and sometimes reused in \"To Jesus' Heart All Burning\".\n\n\n\n"}

Products are at a 20-60% discount rate and the stores generally do not carry the same merchandise for an entire season. The firm does not sell online. Its market niche is similar to the American store TJ Maxx, and it is a partnered retailer to department stores HomeSense and Marshalls. \n\nIn 1982, Winners was founded in Toronto, Ontario by David Margolis and Neil Rosenberg. It was one of the first off-price department stores in Canada. In 1990, it merged with TJX Companies, the world's largest off-price department store owner.\n\nSince late 2001, Winners stores have been paired with HomeSense, a home accessory retailer, modelled on TJX's American HomeGoods stores. Winners acquired the struggling \"Labels\" brand from Dylex in 2001. Labels had been meant to compete with Winners, but never succeeded; most of its stores have been turned into Homesense stores.\n\nLes Ailes de la Mode opened a similar concept under the Labels banner after Winners did not renew its trademark on the name.\n\nIn 2016, CBC's Marketplace investigated Winner's \"compared at\" pricing and found that retail price of the manufacture could be misleading and inaccurate. For example, \"researchers at Marketplace found that a Risk board game at Winners was being sold for $49.99, with a \"compared at\" price of $100.00. However, the game was available at full price from retailer F.G Bradley's Canadian website for $74.99.\" Winners responded by saying \"compared at\" prices are accurate and fair, and that the misunderstanding could be a result of an error in pricing merchandise due to their large volume of product intake.. In follow up letter to CBC marketplace, Winners was able to verify every \"compared at\" price for 20 out of the 21 items, by finding the items at the \"compared at\" prices at comparable retailers. For the remaining item, Winners admitted that it was an error on their part and pledged to fix the mismatch. \n\n\n"}

At the theatre, locals and visitors alike were able to watch performances of drama and song. Today its ancient edifice in the rione of Sant'Angelo, Rome, once again provides one of the city's many popular spectacles or tourist sites.\nSpace for the theatre was cleared by Julius Caesar, who was murdered before its construction could begin; the theatre was advanced enough by 17 BC that part of the celebration of the \"ludi saeculares\" took place within the theatre; it was completed in 13 BC and formally inaugurated in 12 BC by Augustus, named after his nephew Marcus Claudius Marcellus who had died in 23 BC.\n\nThe theatre was 111 m in diameter and was the largest and most important theatre in Ancient Rome; it could originally hold between 11,000 and 20,000 spectators. It was an impressive example of what was to become one of the most pervasive urban architectural forms of the Roman world. The theatre was built mainly of tuff, and concrete faced with stones in the pattern known as opus reticulatum, completely sheathed in white travertine. However, it is also the earliest dateable building in Rome to make use of fired Roman brick, then a new introduction from the Greek world.\n\nThe network of arches, corridors, tunnels and ramps that gave access to the interiors of such Roman theatres were normally ornamented with a screen of engaged columns in Greek orders: Doric at the base, Ionic in the middle. It is believed that Corinthian columns were used for the upper level but this is uncertain as the theatre was reconstructed in the Middle Ages, removing the top tier of seating and the columns.\n\nLike other Roman theatres in suitable locations, it had openings through which the natural setting could be seen, in this case the Tiber Island to the southwest. The permanent setting, the \"scaena\", also rose to the top of the \"cavea\" as in other Roman theatres.\nThe theatre fell out of use in the early 4th century and the structure served as a quarry, e.g., the Pons Cestius in 370 AD. However, the statues located inside the building were restored by Petronius Maximus in 421 and the remaining structure still housed small residential buildings.\nIn the Early Middle Ages the theatre was used as a fortress of the Fabii and then at the end of the 11th century (when it was known as \"templum Marcelli\"), by Pier Leoni and later his heirs (the Pierleoni). This saved the complex from further destruction. The Savelli held it in the 13th century. Later, in the 16th century, the residence of the Orsini, designed by Baldassare Peruzzi, was built atop the ruins of the ancient theatre. By the 19th century, rises in the street level meant that almost half the ground floor was below it.\n\nNow the upper floors are divided into multiple apartments, and its surroundings are used as a venue for small summer concerts; the Portico d'Ottavia lies to the north west leading to the Roman Ghetto and the Tiber to the south west.\n\nIn the 17th century, the English architect Sir Christopher Wren explicitly acknowledged that his design for the Sheldonian Theatre in Oxford was influenced by \nSerlio's engraving of the Theatre of Marcellus.\n\nA 1:100 scale model of the theatre is found in Room IX of the Museo della Civiltà Romana in Rome.\n\n"}

He served in the United States Army.\n\nBartell was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, but grew up in Houston, where he got his start at station KRPC. In 1942, he joined the staff of KWKW radio as an announcer.\n\nUpon moving to California, Bartell became a favorite of producer/director Norman MacDonnell, performing frequently on \"Escape\" (notably as Ronald Dawson in \"The Second Class Passenger\" and Peyton Farquar in Ambrose Bierce's \"An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge\"), and was a leading member of the \"Gunsmoke\" repertory company. Bartell was with the latter series from the first broadcast on April 26, 1952 until the last show on June 18, 1961; his roles ranged from friendly townspeople to victims to heavies, from the occasional role of Dodge City printer Mr. Hightower to famed gunslinger Doc Holliday in a 1952 episode. With fellow actor Vic Perrin, he also co-wrote two episodes near the end of the radio run, and appeared many times on the TV version of \"Gunsmoke,\" sometimes reprising his radio roles.\n\nBartell worked on other radio Westerns such as \"The Six Shooter\", \"Frontier Gentleman\", \"Have Gun Will Travel,\" and \"Fort Laramie\" (a regular as Lt. Seiberts). Other recurring radio parts included a stint as one of several actors to play Archie Goodwin in \"The New Adventures of Nero Wolfe\" starring Sydney Greenstreet, Tommy Brooks on the situation comedy \"The Charlotte Greenwood Show\", and Officer Ed Miller on \"Rogers of the Gazette\". As an announcer, he was heard on \"The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes\" for several years, interviewing Dr. Watson and segueing into commercials for Petri Wine (he also announced on \"Silver Theater\" in the 1940s and on the radio version of \"Dear Abby\" from 1960 until 1972).\n\nOther radio acting jobs included multiple roles in Norman Corwin's VE day special \"On a Note of Triumph\", a recurring role as a high strung insurance representative on \"Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar\", frequent appearances on Jack Webb's shows \"Dragnet\" and \"Pete Kelly's Blues\", and episodic parts on \"The Modern Adventures of Casanova\" (starring Errol Flynn), \"My Favorite Husband\", \"The Saint\", \"Suspense,\" and \"Lux Radio Theater\",\n\nIn films and television, Bartell's youthful voice was revealed to come from a silver-haired figure. His TV appearances included guest roles on \"Get Smart\", \"I Love Lucy\", \"Wild Wild West\", and \"The Twilight Zone\", in addition to the television versions of \"Gunsmoke\" and \"Dragnet\" (reprising his radio role of Father Rojas in Christmas episodes of the 1951, 1967, and 1970 series).\n\nBartell's films included \"Voice in the Mirror\", \"Johnny Concho\", the 1954 \"Dragnet\" movie and an unbilled part in Howard Hawks' \"Monkey Business.\"\n\nApart from his acting work, Bartell was an active photographer (many of his photos of the \"Gunsmoke\" cast appeared in the 1990 book on the series \"Gunsmoke: A Complete History\"). In his last years, he was a frequent presence at old-time radio conventions and recreations, wrote online articles about the medium and his experiences, and even participated in radio-themed chat rooms. His final radio appearance was on Seattle radio producer Jim French's series \"The Further Adventures of Sherlock Holmes,\" guest starring as a blustery American publisher in an August 2003 episode. He died the following February.\n\nOn February 26, 2004, Bartell died in Ashland, Oregon. He was 90 years old. He was cremated and his ashes returned to his family in residence.\n\n"}

The first Yosakoi festival was held in 1954 in Kochi. Yosakoi-style dancing has spread throughout much of Japan. The style of dance is highly energetic, combining traditional Japanese dance movements with modern music. The choreographed dances are often performed by large teams. Along with a number of professional yosakoi schools and town dance teams, yosakoi is also a popular event during the sports festivals held by Japanese elementary, junior, and senior high schools. Yosakoi participants include men and women of almost all ages – sometimes within a single team.\n\nThe costumes used by yosakoi teams vary widely. Happi coats and yukata are the most predominant costumes and can be seen in a wide variety of colors. However, some groups choose costumes that are based on historical attire, popular fashions, or ethnic fashions. Typically, all members of a team wear similar costumes.\n\nOne of the defining aspects of yosakoi dance is the use of \"naruko\": small wooden clappers that are held in the hands of each dancer. \"Naruko\" were originally used in Kōchi Prefecture to scare birds away from rice fields. The traditional \"naruko\" has black and yellow beaters on a wooden body, but most modern yosakoi groups create their own \"naruko\", choosing colors and materials that match their costumes. The use of \"naruko\" is required in yosakoi dance, but many groups also use other hand-held instruments or props, such as drums, other percussion instruments, flags, batons, and floats.\n\nThe official yosakoi dance is based on a song called \"Yosakoi Naruko Dancing\", written by Takemasa Eisaku. This song was created by combining elements of three songs: \"Yosakoi-bushi\" (\"yosakoi melody\"), \"Yocchore\" (a children's song), and \"Jinma-mo\" (a folk song of Kōchi Prefecture). The original competition in Kōchi requires that each team's music include some part of this original music. Competitions and festivals in other areas may not have this requirement (thus allowing teams to compose their own music), or may require that elements of different local folk songs are worked into the dance routines.

The number of participants has been increasing yearly: as of 2005 over 10,000 dancers participate in this competition every year.\n\nThe rules of the Kōchi yosakoi competition are as follows:\n\nSince its introduction in 1954, yosakoi has become popular throughout the country of Japan. Yosakoi-Soran festivals are now held all over Japan throughout the year. They vary in size from small villages hosting a few teams of dancers in conjunction with another annual festival, to large cities like Sendai, which hosts the Michinoku Yosakoi Festival, the third largest festival in Japan.\n\nAs of 2005, there were yosakoi festivals and competitions in over 200 locations.\n\nAn example of yosakoi dancing can be seen in the feature film \"The Harimaya Bridge\", which was filmed in Kōchi Prefecture. The 2011 manga series, \"Hanayamata\", which received an anime adaptation in July 2014, also focuses on yosakoi.\n\nYosakoi is performed in Penang, Malaysia every year in March in the middle of UNESCO Heritage City. It's organised by local enthusiasts called the Pink Hibiscus Yosakoi Dancers together with the Penang City Council, as well as in Accra, Ghana as an annual celebration to strengthen ties between Japan and Ghana. \n\nIn Vietnam, yosakoi is performed annually in Japan Sakura Matsuri which is usually held in April in Hanoi by Japan Foundation Vietnam (JPF) to introduce Japanese culture. This festival showed over 10 enthusiastic Yosakoi teams of Vietnam and guest teams from Japan. Yosakoi also appears in anime-manga-cosplay events in large cities such as Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City and Haiphong. Up to now, there are total 4 Vietnamese yosakoi teams participating in Harajuku Omotesando Super Yosakoi Festival, including Hanoi Sennen Yosakoi Team, Nakama Yosakoi Team, Hanuyo and Nui Truc Sakura Yosakoi Team. \n\nThere are also yosakoi teams at universities outside Japan, such as UC Berkeley, Kansas State University., Minnesota State University Moorhead, and in New York City In Canada, a team called Sakuramai performs locally at cultural events and fairs in Toronto and Montreal.\n\nIn Europe, one can learn and dance Yosakoi in the Netherlands, France, Sweden, Germany, or the UK. Formed by the students of Leiden University, the Dutch team Raiden performs yosakoi in various Japan-related activities such as the yearly Japanmarkt, anime conventions and cultural events. Its French counterpart was created back in 2010 and perform in several festivals, including the \"International Fair of Bordeaux\"\". The Swedish team Zyka Yosakoi\" also performs at local Japan-related events or gatherings. There is also a group in London called Temuzu, which has performed at Japanese events such as \"HyperJapan\".\n\n"}

The single was the final classic-era Family Stone recording; it would be 23 months until the next release, the single \"Family Affair\" in late 1971.\n\nSly, his siblings Freddie Stone and Rose Stone, and Larry Graham trade bars for the lead vocal, delivering Sly's assurance that every person is special in their own way. The song with which \"Star\" originally shared a 7\" single, \"Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin)\", marks the beginning of the Family Stone's second era, during which the music would take on a darker, more funk-based feel.\n\nThe song has been covered by several acts, including The Jackson 5, The Pointer Sisters, Gladys Knight & The Pips, Madonna, Fishbone with Gwen Stefani and Family Stone member Rose Stone, and others. The Roots sampled the song for their 2004 single \"Star\", from their LP \"The Tipping Point\". This version of the song, featuring Roots MC Black Thought commenting on how people attempt to earn fame in the wrong way, was also included on a Family Stone tribute/covers album, \"Different Strokes by Different Folks\", released in July 2005.

There are two versions of it: the black canoe and the jade canoe. The black canoe features on Canadian $20 bills issued between 2004 and 2012.\n\nThe sculpture was originally created in 1986 as a -scale clay model, enlarged in 1988, to full-size clay. In 1991, the model was cast in bronze. This first bronze casting was entitled The Spirit of Haida Gwaii, the Black Canoe and is now displayed outside the Canadian Embassy in Washington, D.C. The second bronze casting, entitled The Spirit of Haida Gwaii, the Jade Canoe, was first displayed at the Canadian Museum of History in 1994. Finally, in 1996, the \"Jade Canoe\" (as it is generally called) was moved to the International Terminal at Vancouver International Airport.\n\nThe original plaster pattern for the sculpture is on display in the main hall of the Canadian Museum of History.\nOn 30 April 1996 Canada Post issued \"The Spirit of Haida Gwaii, 1986–1991, Bill Reid\" in the Masterpieces of Canadian art series. The stamp was designed by Pierre-Yves Pelletier based on a sculpture \"The Spirit of Haida Gwaii\" (1991) by William Ronald Reid in the Canadian Embassy, Washington, United States. The 90¢ stamps are perforated 12.5 mm × 13 mm and were printed by Ashton-Potter Limited.\n\nAn image of the sculpture is featured prominently on the reverse of the 2004 edition of the Canadian twenty-dollar bill. These bills are no longer issued; a new design entered use in 2012.\n\n\"The Spirit of Haida Gwaii\" is intended to represent the Aboriginal heritage of Haida Gwaii, formerly called the Queen Charlotte Islands. In green-coloured bronze on the Vancouver version and black-coloured on the Washington version, it shows a traditional Haida cedar dugout canoe which totals six metres in length. The canoe carries the following passengers: Raven, the traditional trickster of Haida mythology, holding the steering oar; Mouse Woman, crouched under Raven's tail; Grizzly Bear, sitting at the bow and staring toward Raven; Bear Mother, Grizzly's human wife; their cubs, Good Bear (ears pointed forward) and Bad Bear (ears pointed back); Beaver, Raven's uncle; Dogfish Woman; Eagle; Frog; Wolf, claws imbedded in Beaver's back and teeth in Eagle's wing; a small human paddler in Haida garb known as the Ancient Reluctant Conscript; and, at the sculpture's focal point, the human Shaman (or in Haida), who wears the Haida cloak and woven spruce root hat and holds a tall staff carved with images of Seabear, Raven, and Killer Whale.\nConsistent with Haida tradition, the significance of the passengers is highly symbolic. The variety and interdependence of the canoe's occupants represents the natural environment on which the ancient Haida relied for their very survival: the passengers are diverse, and not always in harmony, yet they must depend on one another to live. The fact that the cunning trickster, Raven, holds the steering oar is likely symbolic of nature's unpredictability.\nThe sculpture is long, not quite from the base to the top of the Shaman's staff, and weighs nearly .\n\n"}

It stars Vincent Gallo, Tricia Vessey, Béatrice Dalle, Alex Descas and Marilu Marini. The film's soundtrack is provided by Tindersticks.\n\nAlice Houri, who starred in Denis' previous film \"Nénette et Boni\", has a small cameo as a girl on a metro who watches Shane.\n\nAn American couple, Dr. Shane Brown and his wife June, go to Paris, ostensibly for their honeymoon. In reality, Shane has come to Paris to hunt down neuroscientist Dr. Léo Sémeneau and his wife, Coré, whom Shane once knew and was obsessed with. Despite having had a prolific career, Léo is now working as a general practitioner to keep a low profile. He locks Coré in their house every day, but she occasionally escapes and initiates sex with men before violently murdering them. To protect her, Léo buries the bodies.\n\nShane begins investigating Sémeneau's whereabouts. A doctor who once worked with Léo eventually gives Shane the couple's address, explaining that Coré is unwell. Meanwhile, two young men who have been casing the Sémeneau home break in, and ones of them finds Coré in a boarded-up room. After she seduces him, they begin to have sex, but she violently bites him to death, ripping out his tongue with her teeth. When Shane arrives at the house, he discovers Coré covered in blood. She tries to bite him, but Shane is able to overpower her. As he strangles her, she drops a match, setting the house on fire. Shane leaves her to be consumed by the flames. Just after Shane departs, Léo arrives and witnesses the carnage and the dead Coré.\n\nAfter Coré's death, Shane becomes strange and distant. While having sex with his wife, he stops and finishes by masturbating, then runs away from her and adopts a puppy. Finally, he goes to a hotel where he brutally rapes a maid and bites her to death, then showers and washes the blood from his body. His wife enters and the couple agree to return home.\n\n\n\"Trouble Every Day\" was screened out of competition at the 2001 Cannes Film Festival.\n\nThe film received mixed reactions from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 49% rating, based on 49 reviews. The site's consensus states: \"An erotic thriller dulled by a messy narrative.\" On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 40 out of 100 based on reviews from 16 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".\n\nDerek Elley of \"Variety\" wrote that it is \"over-long, under-written and needlessly obscure instead of genuinely atmospheric.\" Chris Fujiwara of \"The Boston Globe\" was more positive, but concludes by calling the film \"a success in some sense, but it's hard to like a film so cold and dead.\"\n\nLater, the film developed a small following who admire it for its themes of existentialism and its unique take on the horror genre as well as gender roles. It was given an in depth analysis by \"Salon.com\" which looked at the intricacies of the film, particularly the metaphorical nature of the narrative. At Film Freak Central, Walter Chaw said, \"Plaintive and sad, Claire Denis' \"Trouble Every Day\" is a rare combination of honesty, beauty, and maybe even genius.\" The film has been associated with the New French Extremity.\n\n\n"}

It was originally released on an indie label in Atlanta called Rising Storm Records in 1993. The track \"Shine\" gained the band attention thanks to college radio. They later signed on with Atlantic Records and the album was released on CD in 1994 under the Atlantic label.\n\nThe album's title is derived from the lyrics of Paul Simon's 1986 hit \"You Can Call Me Al\". The cover art is a modified version of the original logo for the 1979 broadway musical \"\", with the razor replaced with a banner, the picture in color and just the man on the cover. The album's opening track, \"Shine\", would arguably become Collective Soul's biggest hit.\n\n\"Hints, Allegations and Things Left Unsaid\" was recorded in a basement in 1992 as a promotional demo. Frontman Ed Roland hoped to simply sell the songs to a publishing company rather than form a band. He gave the demo to a small college radio station in Atlanta that began playing \"Shine\". The track quickly became their most requested song and the band was asked to perform some concerts for the station. Favoring an opportunity to perform a few shows with his brother, Roland agreed and regathered the demo's guitarist and drummer as well as his brother Dean.\n\nThe attention gained by \"Shine\" allowed it to chart and catapulted the band to national stardom. They were soon picked up by Atlantic Records who wished to release the demo as the debut studio album of Collective Soul. In a 1995 interview, Roland elaborated on his mixed feelings regarding the situation:\n\nConsequently, Collective Soul would regard their self-titled 1995 studio album under Atlantic as the band's official debut. Roland told \"Metal Edge\", \"It's so funny for people to compare the two. It's like comparing one band to another band. [\"Collective Soul\"] is our first record, flat out.\"\n\n\"Hints, Allegations, and Things Left Unsaid\" featured three singles, the most successful of which was \"Shine\". Aside from radio popularity, the song also had a music video which received heavy airplay on MTV.\n\nCollective Soul performed at Woodstock 1994 and opened for Aerosmith during their Get a Grip Tour.\n\nThe album gained overall positive reception from critics. It was given credit for its strong melodies but a less savory response regarding its apparent lack of originality. Also of note was Collective Soul's more upbeat sound amidst their more angst, grunge-influenced contemporaries.\n\nChuck Eddy of \"Entertainment Weekly\" gave a somewhat sarcastic review, describing the album as \"bubble-gum grunge: an idea whose time has come.\"\n\nIn \"The Village Voice\", Robert Christgau was even more negative, singling it out in Consumers Guide \"Turkey Shoot\" feature as a \"Must to Avoid\", an example of \"...mediocre pseudoalternatives from every corner of this embittered, all too grateful land of ours.\"\n\nAll songs written by Ed Roland.\nAlthough Ed Roland has stated that the musicians on the recording \"Hints Allegations and Things Left Unsaid\" were entirely different from Collective Soul's subsequent recordings, the following people are credited in its Atlantic reissue:\n\nCollective Soul\n\nAdditional musicians\n\nString ensemble\n\nProduction\n"}

It was found that his BN(O) passport was genuine.\n\nPursuant to this issue, the British authorities have upgraded all British passports regardless of type to include enhanced security features such as digitised photographs and signatures, and electronic security features that have made requests for verification by foreign immigration officers by the British Consulate-General in Hong Kong far less necessary/frequent.\n\nIn 1999 Wu Man, a British National (Overseas) and a Hong Kong resident, was alleged to be a member of the gang once led by Cheung Tze-keung.

No formal extradition hearing was held for him because, say the Thai authorities, \"he didn't ask for it\". They also claimed that Wu, went willingly to China. The British Foreign Office stated that it should have been informed of Wu's arrest and impending extradition. Wu, in turn, should have been able to seek British consular assistance in Bangkok.

Keaton stars as the title character, a father killed in a car accident before returning to life as a snowman. Three of Frank Zappa's four children, Dweezil Zappa, Ahmet Zappa, and Moon Unit Zappa, appear in the film.\n\n\"Jack Frost\" was released in Australia on December 10, 1998, a day prior to its American release. It received negative reviews and became a box-office bomb, grossing just $34 million.\n\nJack Frost is the lead singer in a rock band simply titled \"The Jack Frost Band\", based in the town of Medford, Colorado, who make their living performing blues covers and an assortment of their own songs in the hope of signing a record deal. He returns to his 11-year-old son Charlie, who has just returned from a snowball fight against local bully Rory Buck. After they build a snowman in their front yard, Jack gives him his best harmonica, which he got the day Charlie was born, jokingly telling him that it's magical, and he'll be able to hear it wherever he is. Jack promises his wife Gabby that he will attend his son's hockey game, but misses it in favor of recording \"Don't Lose Your Faith\". To make up for it, Jack then promises to take his family on a Christmas trip to the mountains, but is called in on a gig that could make or break his career. On his way there, Jack realizes his mistake and borrows his best friend (and keyboardist) Mac MacArthur's car to go home to his family. Unfortunately, Jack encounters a bad storm that he is unable to navigate through, due to a faulty windshield wiper, and unexpectedly crashes the car, killing himself (off-screen).\n\nA year later, Charlie, depressed over his father's death, withdraws from all contact with his friends. One night, Charlie makes another snowman that bears as much of a resemblance to Jack as he can remember and plays Jack's harmonica just before going to sleep. The harmonica turns out to be magical after all, as it resurrects Jack and his spirit awakens in the snowman. Thrilled to be alive again, Jack attempts to greet Charlie, but ends up terrifying him. The next morning, Charlie discovers Jack in his yard and attempts to run away from him. When Charlie winds up in the snowball battlefield, Jack pelts Rory and the other children with snowballs and escapes with Charlie on a sled. After losing them, Charlie realizes that the snowman is his father after Jack uses his nickname \"Charlie boy\". Jack reconnects with Charlie and teaches him the values that he never got to teach him when he was alive. After some hockey lessons, Jack convinces Charlie to rejoin the team instead of continuing to grieve over his death, becoming their best player. In the meantime, Mac continues to be a friend of the family, while also becoming a father figure to Charlie at Gabby's suggestion.\n\nAs winter approaches its end, Jack begins melting and struggles to get to Charlie's hockey game. Afterwards, Charlie decides to take Jack to the mountains where it is colder, but has a difficult time convincing Gabby to do so. Charlie comes across Rory, who also insults the snowman by asking which is more stupid. After Jack speaks in front of Rory by correcting his last sentence, Rory then sympathizes with Charlie not having a father and helps him sneak Jack onto a truck en route to the mountains. Jack and Charlie arrive at the isolated cabin that the family was going to stay at before Jack's death. Jack calls Gabby, nonchalantly asking her to come to the cabin to pick up Charlie; Gabby is shocked, but recognizes his voice and obliges. Jack tells a disheartened Charlie that he has to leave. When his wife arrives, the snowman shell dissipates, revealing Jack in an ethereal form. Jack tells Charlie he will be with him wherever he goes and, after saying farewell and giving his love to both his wife and son, returns to the afterlife.\n\nIn the closing moments of the film, Charlie plays hockey with his group of friends (which now includes Rory), while Gabby happily watches and Mac plays music on the piano. The final street scene shows that all the front lawns have snowmen on them.\n\n\n\nBoth Joseph Cross and Mika Boorem starred together in the \"Touched by an Angel\" episode \"Psalm 151.\" Plus, Cross and Michael Keaton appeared together in \"Desperate Measures\", which was released the same year.\n\nThe costume for Jack Frost's snowman form was created by Jim Henson's Creature Shop.\n\nPrincipal photography began on March 16, 1998, and wrapped on June 23, 1998.\n\nThe film features 22 tracks:\n\n\nNot all of these songs are available on the soundtrack CD, however.\n\nFeatured on the CD release are:\n\nProduced on an $85 million budget, the film took $7 million on its opening weekend.\nIt went on to gross over $34.5 million in North America, becoming a box office flop.\n\nThe film received mostly negative reviews from critics. Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 19% based on 57 reviews. The site's consensus states: \"Sentimental schmaltz and uninspired storytelling sink this film.\"\nAudiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade B+ on scale of A to F.\n\nRoger Ebert gave the film one out of four stars, writing, \"It's possible for the Jim Henson folks and Industrial Light and Magic to put their heads together and come up with the most repulsive single creature in the history of special effects, and I am not forgetting the Chucky doll or the desert intestine from \"Star Wars\".\" Ben Falk of \"Empire Magazine\" gave the film a three out of five stars, saying, \"Despite an astoundingly dodgy-looking central character, this is a children's flick that doesn't apologise for being so and in an environment where even cartoons are stuffed full of gags purely for the grown-ups, that's remarkably refreshing.\" Janet Maslin of \"The New York Times\" gave the film a positive review, saying: \"As one more Hollywood effort to look on the sunny side of fatality, \"Jack Frost\" is so sugarcoated that it makes other recent efforts in this genre look blisteringly honest. On the other hand, it's just cheerful and bogus enough to keep children reasonably entertained.\"\n\n"}

Though the seat of government and capital for the province, the city itself is one of 38 independent cities within the Philippines not controlled by the province in which it is geographically located and is therefore an independent area located within Palawan.\n\nIt is the least densely populated city in the Philippines. In terms of land area, the city is the second largest geographically after Davao City with an area of . Puerto Princesa is the location of the Philippines' Western Command headquarters.\n\nToday, Puerto Princesa is a tourist city with many beach resorts and seafood restaurants. It has been acclaimed several times as the cleanest and greenest city in the Philippines.\nHistorically, the place was named after Maria Cristina, one of the princesses born to Isabella II of Spain and her consort, Francis, Duke of Cádiz. When the princess suffered an untimely death, the Queen changed the name to Puerto de la Princesa. Eventually, the name was shortened to Puerto Princesa.\n\nSpanish Colonizers founded the settlement on 4 March 1872 in the course of their exploration of the province. As they scanned the Palawan shoreline for a capital site, they came upon a hill with steep declivity. Rowing to shore, they surveyed the hill and discovered an extensive plateau which they decided as ideal for settlement.\n\nSoon after, Fr. Antonio Muro levelled a portion of the hill to make way for a chapel. (That section is now occupied by the Catholic Cathedral, the P.C. Barracks and the Rizal Park. The Old Municipal Building used to be there, as well as an Elementary School). The first mass celebrated in Puerto Princesa took place at a site where a marker now stands.\n\nIn May 1872, the Port of Puerto Princesa became the center of Spanish Naval Operations in the area because the Bay met all the Navy's requirements. Royal Decrees later provided incentives to settlers, and by 1883 the settlement had flourished into a town of twelve roads, a hospital and well-built port.\n\nIn 1894, Puerto Princesa was recognized by government authorities as one of the most beautiful towns in the country by virtue of the orderly distribution of streets, buildings and houses as well as the cleanliness of the community.\n\nIn 1911, the New American Administration made Puerto Princesa the seat of the Palawan Provincial Government with Major John Brown as Lieutenant Governor.\n\nIn the year 1936, Governor Heginio Mendoza made a directive on the transfer of the Palawan High School (currently Palawan National School) from the island municipality of Cuyo to the central place of the province, which was the Municipality of Puerto Princesa.\n\nDuring WWII and the Japanese occupation, the village was largely abandoned. The Filipino Constabulary barracks was the scene of the Palawan Massacre, just before liberation with the allied Invasion of Palawan.\n\nIn 1951, the barrios of Tinitian, Caramay, Rizal, Del Pilar, Malcampo, Tumarbong, Taradungan, Ilian, and Capayas were separated to form the town of Roxas.\n\nIn 1955, the sitios of Materingen, Tandayag, Nasedoc, and Panlawagan were separated from the barrio of Maroyogon and elevated into a barrio.\n\nIn 1956, the sitios of Calagbenguen, Tarabanan, Bendoyan, Talabigan, Tagbuan, and Langogan were constituted into the barrio of Concepcion.\n\nIn 1957, the barrio of \"Tapul\" was renamed to \"Salvacion\".\n\nThe town was converted into a city on 1 January 1970 under \"Republic Act 5906\" as amended by \"P.D. 437\", through the effort of then Congressman Ramon Mitra, Jr. Feliberto R.

Aside from being the seat of public administration, it is the heart of trade, commerce, service, and industry in the province.\n\nPuerto Princesa is located in the midsection of Palawan Island. It is bound to the east by the Sulu Sea, to the west iby the South China Sea, to the north by the municipalities of San Vicente and Roxas, and to the south by the municipality of Aborlan. It is approximately from the Philippine capital of Manila, from Panay Island, and from Zamboanga City on the southern Philippine island of Mindanao.\n\nAdministratively and politically, Puerto Princesa is divided into 66 barangay or 1st to 2nd district s, 35 of which are classified as urban barangays and 31 as rural.\n\nPuerto Princesa features a tropical wet and dry climate (Köppen climate classification Aw).

Although the predominant language is Tagalog, Cuyonon is widely spoken and used throughout the whole city, as well as Hiligaynon, other Visayan languages, and English.\n\nPuerto Princesa is known as the \"Eco-Tourism Center of the Philippines\". In recent years, the city has seen an increase in the number of tourists bringing with them trade and businesses for the city.

Rolly Concepcion, who conceptualized the Trikebayan, said that converting a tricycle engine to electric costs . The rechargeable battery under the passenger seat can run for 12 hours. Mr. Conception died before the project was completed.\n\nThis did not discourage the previous mayor Hagedorn from pursuing a dream of seeing all electric vehicles, especially replacing the gas tricycles in the city. There was a dealership for these trikes on the north highway but it closed down in 2011.\n\nAlthough Puerto Princesa has this bold plan for electric vehicles, the municipal government and tourist office has stated (when asked by a tourist in August 2011), that it has no published or announced plan for providing for the current and future needs and safety of pedestrians or bicycle riders.

The third longest is Queen Helen Sandbar at the southern tip of Bugsuk and the fourth is the Angela Sandbar east of Mansalangan.\n\nBalabac is politically subdivided into 20 barangays:\n\nIn the , the population of Balabac was people, with a density of .\n\nThe Molbog people dominate the municipality of Balabac, as well as the municipality of Bataraza in the north. The area is the homeland of the Molbog people since the classical era prior to Spanish colonization. The Molbog are known to have a strong connection with the natural world, especially with the sacred \"pilandok\" (Philippine mouse-deer), which can only be found in the Balabac islands. A Muslim tale tells the Philippine mouse-deer once tricked a prince into giving up his bag of gold and facing a hive of angry bees. Another tale depicts him as a clever guardian of the environment, using his wisdom as an advantage against those who destroy forests, seas, and wildlife. The coconut is especially important in Molbog culture at it is their most prized agricultural crop.\n\nThe Cape Melville Lighthouse, located on the island of Balabac, is one of the Philippines oldest lighthouses built in 1892 during the Spanish era and a major landmark of the town.\n\nBalabac is a three-hour boat trip from Bataraza on the island of Palawan; Bataraza in turn can be reached from Palawan's capital city Puerto Princesa.\n\nAn old airstrip located on the island of Bugsuk serves no commercial flights. Another private airstrip is located on the island of Ramos.\n\n"}

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nLocated between the islands of Palawan and Negros in the Sulu Sea, Cagayancillo is the closest settlement to the Tubbataha National Marine Park. The word Cagayancillo is Spanish meaning \"Little Cagayan.\"\n\nThe farthest provincial limit of the province of Palawan in the east is the island of municipality of Cagayancillo. It is approximately east of Puerto Princesa City and only south-west of Antique. It is located near the middle of the Sulu Sea.\n\nThere are neither mountain ranges nor forested areas in the municipality. A hilly portion in the north-eastern part of the main island has a slope of 3-82%. The other areas are flat with the highest elevation around 2 to 3 meters. The majority of the island has a sandy loam soil not enough to support a forest.\n\nCagayancillo is the smallest municipality in the province of Palawan with a total land area of only as of 2007. The municipality is composed of 31 islands and islets and is subdivided into 12 barangays and two island sitios (Cavili and Calusa) included under the political jurisdiction of Magsaysay.\n\n\nCagayancillo belongs to Type II climate wherein there is no distinct wet or dry season. The dry season is usually from December to May with March as the driest month. The wet season is usually from May to November with August as the rainiest month.\n\nThe municipality is exposed to both monsoons. The \"Amihan\" or north-east winds blow from November to March while the \"Habagat\" or south-west winds visit the area from June to October. The summer months from April to June receive the moderate \"daplak\" wind from the north-west.\n\nThe island was known to the first Spanish settlers in the Archipelago simply as \"Cagayan\". They describe this territory as \"two low islets about fifteen leagues from the island of Panay\". They ruled these islets from the town of Arevalo in Iloilo by sailing south-southeast from this part of Panay, to the open sea. The islands are surrounded by many low reefs. But the Spaniards were able to discover their narrow entry, avoiding the great danger that awaited ships.\n\nDuring the early period of Spanish colonizations, these small islets were inhabited by four hundred people, all of whom were very skillful shipbuilders. They were from Panay, and they came to these islets in order to fortify themselves by the reefs, for fear of pirates. Then they undertook to return to Panay in order to dwell there. But many of their women died there. Seeing this, as they were soothsayers, they returned to the islands of Cagayan, from where they set out every year, and scattered themselves over all the islands to build ships. They built the ships of the Spanish Royal Navy in the Philippines, as well as galleys, galliots, and frigates. They also helped in repairing and righting ships. Being the most important people in the islands for the Spaniards, the adelantado Miguel López de Legazpi allotted their islands to the encomenderos of Negros Island. Afterwards, the colonizers found it best to put them under the direct control of the Spanish Crown. Thus, it was governed from the town of Arevalo in Iloilo.\n\nHistorically, the islands also became part of Antique Province. It was made into a municipality in 1810, with Omabong as its first mayor.\n\nDuring the American regime, it came under the jurisdiction of Negros Occidental.\n\nIn 1959, the following sitios were constituted into barrios of Cagayan:\n\nIn the , the population of Cagayancillo was people, with a density of .\n\nCagayancillo Fort is one of the surviving defense forts in Palawan built during the Spanish Colonial Period. Work on the fort was started in the late 16th century by Father Nicolas Melo and Father Alonso Colosa, but it was not completed till the early 18th century by Father Hipolito Casiano, spanning almost 130 years. The 162-sq. meter (1,740-sq. foot) diamond-shaped fort was built on the coast on a high point on the island and made from sea rocks mixed with lime. Like some of the other Spanish forts in this area, inside is a church surrounded by its massive high and thick walls, providing a safe place for the residents during marauding pirate attacks. The other Spanish Colonial fortifications in Palawan are Fort Santa Isabel in Taytay and Cuyo Fort in Cuyo.\n\nThere are no hospitals in Cagayancillo. Health facilities in the municipality consist of 1 rural health unit and 4 Barangay Health Stations.

It is known for being a vacation spot for those looking for sailing, fishing, and other activities associated with the water. The Middlesex County Board of Supervisors approved a resolution on October 2, 2012 supporting the efforts of the official naming, \" Deltaville, The Boating Capital of the Chesapeake Bay.\" Approximately 500-800 full-time residents call Deltaville home; however, the town's population swells to several thousand in the summer months. Deltaville is also home to numerous retirees. The Census Bureau defines Deltaville as a census-designated place (CDP) with a population of 1,119 as of 2010. The town developed around being a large boat building area, mostly for commercial bay watermen. However those days have passed and now the area is dotted with numerous marinas, boatyards, and marine related businesses.\n\nOriginally known as Sandy Bottom, the community decided to change the town name in 1909. The name Delta was proposed, because of the shape of the town, as it is bordered by the Rappahannock River to the North, the Piankatank River to the south, and the Chesapeake Bay to the east. There was a Delta, Virginia already in existence, so \"ville\" was tacked onto the end. The Deltaville ZIP code is 23043.\n\nDeltaville has been home for over a half century to a semi-pro baseball team, the Deltas. The 1948 vintage Deltaville Ballpark is their home field. Other activities in the town include a town pool, tennis courts, basketball court, and playground, and a community center, all built and maintained by a volunteer Board of the Deltaville Community Association - a (501) (c) (3) organization.\n\nThe Deltaville Maritime Museum and Holly Point Nature Park, home to the Nationally registered historic buyboat, the F.D. Crockett, is located in Deltaville at 287 Jackson Creek Road. Situated on 36 acres crossing both the waters of Mill Creek and Jackson Creek Road, this water accessible park acts as a setting for the Museum, the multi-purpose events pavilion, outside exhibits and the waterfront performance area. Founded in 2002, the Museum and Park's mission is to preserve and present the history of Chesapeake Bay watermen, their workboats, fisheries, and methods. The \"Museum and Park\" also host farmer's markets, plays, concerts, and Holiday events throughout the year.\n\nThe tip end of Deltaville is Stingray Point, named by Captain John Smith on July 17, 1608. According to Captain John Smith's The General History, \"He was stung by a stingray there while exploring the bay. Captain Smith is said to have given orders for his men to dig a grave because he believed himself to be dying from the sting. Walter Russell, a doctor of physic, and also a member of Smith's crew, applied a \"precious oil\" to Smith's wound. The Captain recovered sufficiently to eat the stingray for his dinner that evening. The legend that a cure was given to Smith by local Native Americans, who lived along what is now called Antipoison Creek, has been largely been discredited.\"\n\nOn the evening of April 16, 2011, the community was struck by a devastating tornado. Prior to reaching Deltaville the storm had torn a path from North Carolina to the Chesapeake Bay. With wind gust estimated 135 mph it only took minutes to cause approximately 6.8 million in damages. The tornado touched down near Porpoise Cove, on the south side of Deltaville, and ran a northeast path, destroying 32 homes, along with Zoar Baptist Church, the Community Association Pool, and severely damaged the community hall. Despite injuries, no one was killed.\n\nThe \"F.D. Crockett\" was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2012.\n\nNational Historic Registry Sign in Hartfield, Virginia, \"A Portrait of Deltaville 25th Anniversary Edition\"\n\n"}

He also feels that the title track for \"Final Fantasy VI\" was the most challenging track he has ever made. As for \"Final Fantasy VI Grand Finale\", on the other hand, Uematsu has said that he was \"not satisfied with this album at all\", due to the deviation it took from his original visions for the music due to his lack of personal involvement in the arrangements. Although he did not feel that the album was a poor one, saying that if he said nothing no one would ever know of his dissatisfaction, he felt that it was not what he would have created if he had \"defend[ed] the image of each piece\".\n\nThe Black Mages, a band led by Nobuo Uematsu that arranges music from \"Final Fantasy\" games into a rock music style, has arranged four pieces from \"Final Fantasy VI\".

He had previously served as provisional governor of Arizona Territory from 1860 to 1861.\n\nBorn in Roane County, Tennessee, Owings went to Yell County, Arkansas and then to Texas, where he helped found the town of Helena, serving as the first postmaster. In 1855, he served in the Texas House of Representatives but was defeated for reelection moving to Mesilla, New Mexico, where he had a mine.\n\nIn 1860 Owings was chosen as Provisional Governor of \"Arizona Territory\"—a region including New Mexico and Arizona—in an organization convention at Tucson. The Convention subsequently petitioned the United States Congress for recognition of their government, but the impending conflicts of the American Civil War in the east distracted Washington's attention away from what was then a remote frontier outpost. Owings nevertheless proceeded to carry out the official functions of a \"de facto\" governor in the largely unorganized territory and established three militia companies to protect residents from Indian raids and border smugglers.\n\nOwings held the post until August 1, 1861, when the Arizona Territory was formally reorganized by the Confederacy and declared south of the 34th Parallel by Lieutenant Colonel John R. Baylor, who then assumed the governorship.

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nIts territory includes the western half of Cuyo Island, as well as Bisucay, Caponayan, Cauayan, Imalaguan, Lubid, Manamoc, Pamalican, Pandan, Round, and Quiminatin islands, all part of the Cuyo Archipelago.\n\nCuyo is the oldest town in Palawan which has a culture of its own and was preserved for more than 350 years. During the Spanish colonization of the Philippines, Cuyo became the second capital of Palawan from 1873 to 1903.\n\nFrom the sea, Cuyo Island's first visible landmark is a lighthouse by the pier. Many of the streets leading to the town have already been cemented but the town has preserved the Hispanic plaza-iglesia structures. Dominating the town centre is Cuyo's 1860 church, convent, and fort built by the Spanish and finished in 1680. Nearby stands a schoolhouse, and a monument of national hero Jose Rizal.\n\nThe municipality is served by Cuyo Airport in the neighboring municipality of Magsaysay. The town and its cultural and natural environs are being considered to be nominated in the tentative list for UNESCO World Heritage Site declaration in the future.\n\nCuyo Island is the largest island of the Cuyo Archipelago, about long, wide, and with an area of . It is under the jurisdiction of the municipalities of Cuyo and Magsaysay. The poblacion of Cuyo is home to a Spanish fort, which shelters a church and a convent in its high stone walls..\n\nCuyo is politically subdivided into 17 barangays. In 1956, sitio Danawan was elevated into a barrio.\n\nOriental traders were early discoverers of the Cuyo group of islands and introduced barter trading with the locals.\n\nLater, the Malay chief Matuod and his people arrived in big boats called \"sakayan\" and formed settlements on Cuyo. The Islamic chieftain Datu Magbanua later also settled on Cuyo, later consolidating his power so that chieftains from other islands recognized his rule. The Malays brought with them their dances, and when blended with native dance, the \"Soriano\", it became known as the \"pondo-pondo\" one of the most popular folk dances even up to the present.\n\nDuring the rule of Datu Magbanua, three Chinese arrived on the island and settled also on Cuyo. The Chinese discovered gold deposits in Mount Aguado and introduced gold mining, smith working, pottery, and other handicrafts. The natives of Cuyo became suspicious of their presence and later expelled them. They sailed to Ilongilong (today known as Iloilo) and formed another settlement called \"Parián\".\n\nIn 1622, the Conde de San Agustín, together with five Spanish missionaries, colonised the island they named Cuyo. The friendly character of the people proved to be a blessing to the Spaniards, who found it easy converting the native population to Catholicism. They immediately baptised some 500 inhabitants, however, many still regarded their indigenous Cuyonon religion as sacred and continued to perform Cuyonon rituals. The supreme deity of the Cuyunon people was Diwata ng Kagubatan (literally goddess of the forest), who was honored in a celebrated feast, periodically held atop of Mount Caimamis in Cuyo Island. When most of the natives were converted to Christianity during the Spanish Era, about 2/3 of the converted Cuyunon were still celebrating her feast, angering the Spanish imperialists. The situation led the Spanish authorities to intensify their evangelization and governance efforts, which included the forced Roman Catholic conversion of the Cuyonon people, burning of houses of non-Catholic Cuyonons, and massive slavery. Later, the Spanish called Diwata ng Kagubatan as Virgen Del Monte, in another bid to rebrand the deity as 'Catholic'.\n\nIn 1636, a powerful fleet under the Muslim Datu Tagul raided Cuyo and other places in Palawan. In Cuyo, the Muslims attacked the church and clergy house. They set the town on fire and took with them prisoners including a priest, Fr. Francisco de Jesús María. They then sailed to Agutaya and Culion, where they pillaged and attacked defenceless civilians. The raiders abducted another priest from Culion, Fr. Alonzo de San Agustín, as he was saying Mass. A Spanish naval flotilla of six vessels and 250 men under Captain Nicolas Gonzáles met the returning pirates with their loot and booty on December 21, 1636. Datu Tagul was killed, 300 of his men captured, and 120 prisoners were freed. The two captured priests were killed.\n\nIn 1957, the following sitios were converted to barrios: Emilod and Balading.\n\nIn the , the population of Cuyo, Palawan, was people, with a density of .\n\nElementary Schools\n\n\nSecondary Schools\n\n\nTertiary School\n\n\nDuring the early Spanish period, purposely to protect the Cuyonon from sporadic Moro attacks, Fort Cuyo was constructed and finished in 1680. The original complex of stone and mortar was a square with four bastions. The present complex, which occupies , is a solid rectangular edifice with walls high and thick. It has a tall belfry and watchtowers; its cannons, which face the sea, are now fired only during town celebrations. It is considered as one of the most ancient and unique forts in the Philippines. Unique in the sense that you can find the church, the convent and the Perpetual Adoration chapel all within the fort.\n\nIn 1762 one of the British ships that invaded Manila fired at the Cuyo fort but it was not damaged at all. Another fort was started at Lucbuan seven kilometres away on the east side of Cuyo island, but it was never finished. In 1873, the capital of Paragua (present day Palawan) was transferred to Cuyo from Taytay.\n\nDespite its long history Cuyo has held back the hands of time and preserved its rich cultural heritage preserved since more than 350 years.\n\nThe tipano band, a flute and drum ensemble, and the de kwerdas (string band), supply background music on important social occasions. They also accompany singers and render dance music like the pinundo-pundo. The tipano is reserved for the ati-ati, sinulog, and komedya.\n\nBoth ensembles use available instruments and instrumentalists. The tipano core is basically two drums and four to seven transverse mouth flutes with six finger-holes. One or two tipano \"nga maite\" (small flutes) and three or four tipano \"nga mabael\" (larger flutes) are played with a redublante (snare drum), bombo (big drum), and sometimes a pair of platilyo. The de kwerdas has two or three sabel, and occasionally a guitar, a bajo (six-stringed bass), a banjo, and a banduria. In Cuyunon music the \"akompanimento\" refers to the harmonic accompaniment-principal or \"primera\" to the first or highest voice, and \"segunda\" to the second.\n\nThe Cuyonon youth celebrate love with song during the post-harvest courting season. The Cancion, a popular serenade, is sung with the strumming of a five - or six-stringed guitar in the distinctive punctual manner. Parting is a familiar concern in Cuyunon love songs. Examples of love songs are \"Napopongao Ako\", \"Ang Gegma\", \"Ploning\", \"Daragang Taga Cuyo\", \"Konsomision\", \"Ako Maski Bayan\", \"Tiis Manong Pido\", \"Nagpamasiar Ako\", and \"Komosta\".\n\nCuyonon dances have evolved from native and Spanish influences. Among these are the Pastores (the Christmas dance of the sheppherds), the Chotis (from the German schothische), Lanceros de Cuyo (local French guadrille), Birginia (Virginia reel or square dance), Paraguanen (a romantic comic duet), and La Jota Paragua (a Castillan-type jota using bamboo castanets and manton). The island is known for the Mazurka de Cuyo, a social dance with characteristic mazurka steps. Another popular dance is the Pinundo-pundo, a stylish wedding dance marked by sudden pauses, its first two parts, featuring solo dances of the boy and the girl, are followed by the suring, a love play between the couple.\n\nThe Cuyonon have developed the art of merging song, dance, and drama. Cuyo's Sayaw is a colorful enactment of a story heightened by the music of a string band. It is presented by five pairs of youth arranged in two lines, fully costumed and made up, and bearing props like flowers, crowns, and even knives. After an introductory dance, the leading couple proceed to relate the tale, sometimes using verse. The topic may be anything, from everyday occurrences to special events like winning the sweepstakes. This story is then interpreted in dance and ended with a finale.\n\nYearly on August 28, Cuyo Island celebrates San Agustin's feast. On the eve of the fiesta, a cultural presentation featuring the traditional performing arts and sometimes a separate show of modern songs and dances may be presented. The feast day is begun with a morning mass (sometimes a High Mass officiated by the bishop ) and followed by the Ati-ati, a legacy of the Aklanon. Folk from the nearby islands board barotos (boats) to view the parade which recreates the confrontation of San Agustin and the native \"savages\". Participants portray the Aeta by darkening their bodies with soot and painting their faces with anyel (indigo). They don foot-high headgear of coconut ginit fiber adorned with chicken feathers, and decorate their costumes with coconut leaves. The men, clad in loin cloths, carry spears, bows and arrows, or bolo. The women, wearing patadyong and beaded necklaces, carry baskets with a tumpline\n\nThe participants form two lines, one of men and the other of women. The director signals the start of the singing by striking his cane on the ground. This is followed by a spontaneous dance characterized by sways, hops, jumps, and the jerking of weapons accompanied by chanting; the director also signals the end of the dance. The teniente (barrio head) and his family may recite a series of verses. The director is then approached by the last to recite, customarily the teniente's youngest child.\n\nAs the floats of San Agustin and other saints enter the church at the end of the procession, the participants kneel, prostrate themselves, or sing while performing skipping steps before the images. The merrymaking intensifies when the alakayo, a dancing clown, chases the ladies, stopping only when coins are thrown to him on the ground. The alakayo collects the coins with his mouth.\n\nMeanwhile, the panapatan performance are staged in front of various houses for a fee. These are mostly excerpts of the komedya and ati-ati known as komedya sa kalye and ati-ati sa bukid, the performers of which use simpler clothing than in the more elaborate full-length performances. Ati-ati sa bukid is sung and danced to celebrate a fruitful harvest. Today it is usually danced by young boys wearing masks or indigo-painted faces.\n\nAnother pantomime, innocentes, recreates the descent of the \"savages\" from the hills to pay tribute to San Agustin. They are wearing coconut fibre masks and red striped shirts. The participants frolic and fence with sticks.\n\nKomedya or moro-moro performances are larger (with some 50 actors) and more refined than the ati-ati. The clash between the Mustlims and the Christians is further dramatized by background music; commonly used tunes are the pasadoble, marchas, giyera, and kasal.\n\nThe same subject is portrayed by the sinulog. The Christians are identified by their black costumes, kampilan, and elongated shields; the Muslims by their red turbans and waistbands, and round shields. The participants may wear masks or paint their faces. Both groups, usually of six dancers each, sometimes perform to the beating of tin cans. Alternate steps of offense and defense, e.g., advancing and retreating, with corresponding movements of weapons, are followed by circular formations simulating scenes of strategy plotting.\n\nMt. Aguado features life-size Stations of the Way of the Cross constructed from the foot to the peak of the mountain. Cuyonon devotees, visitors and tourists make the annual pilgrimage to Mt. Aguado as part of the penitential rites done in Cuyo during the Holy Week particularly on Holy Thursday.\n\n\n"}

In 1834 he opened his own perfumery, the House of Rimmel. In the same year father and son produced their first cosmetic products. By the age of 24, Eugène Rimmel had become an immensely talented perfumer and cosmetics innovator. Considered by many beauty historians as a trail-blazer of the beauty and healthcare industries, Rimmel contributed greatly to the concept of hygiene and bathing. He was also among the first to develop scented pomades, mouth rinses and his signature \"Toilet Vinegar\".\n\nHis most innovative invention may well be the first commercial non-toxic mascara, which became so popular that \"rimmel\" is to this day the word for \"mascara\" in several languages including French, Italian, Portuguese, Persian, Romanian, Spanish, Turkish and Arabic.\n\nRimmel was also considered an exceptional marketer and produced detailed mail order catalogues and advertising programmes with English theatres.\n\nIn 1865 he published \"The Book of Perfume\", which appeared in 1870 in a French translation (\"Le Livre des Parfums\") with a preface by Alphonse Karr.\n\nRimmel was so successful that he was granted ten Royal Warrants from heads of state all over Europe, including Queen Victoria, for his perfumes and fragranced products.\n\nWith the headline \"The Prince of Perfumers\", \"The New York Times\" printed Rimmel's obituary on 15 March 1887. It stated that he was one of the founders of the French Hospital and Dispensary in London, and a constant advocate of its claims to the support of the public.\n\nRimmel married a woman from Seurre, eastern France, Elisabeth ('Betsy') Letroublon with whom he had three children, Jules, Henry and Herminie. The sons assumed control of the beauty company at Rimmel's death in 1887, though they delegated the management of the company, which passed out of Rimmel family hands. After many difficulties Rimmel's cosmetics brand is now owned by Coty Inc.\n"}

He continued to work the show sporadically until 1953. His career in the 1930s also included roles in the children's Christmas series \"The Cinnamon Bear\" (as Santa Claus), the crime drama \"Big Town\" (as various gangsters and a stand-in for Edward G. Robinson as Steve Wilson), the soap opera \"Those We Love\" (as con man Ed Neely), and \"The Mickey Mouse Theater of the Air\". He later worked for Arch Oboler on \"Arch Oboler's Plays\" and \"Lights Out\". As related by Mr. Oboler on the Speaking of Radio show (1976), in one dramatic real-life confrontation, Mr. Oboler broke his hand on Mr. Merrill's jaw when the former became incensed over the latter's offensive attitude. A mutual respect resulted from the incident.\n\nIn 1941, he starred as the Nemo-like Captain Craig McKenzie in the now mostly lost sci-fi radio series \"Latitude Zero\" (on which the 1969 film of the same name is based). 12 years later, he starred on the true crime anthology drama series \"Crime Classics\". Merrill played Thomas Hyland, the host/narrator who was fascinated with crime, playing the role deadpan but with subtle humor. Radio comedy appearances included \"Point Sublime\" (a regular as jeweler Aaron Saul) and \"Abbott and Costello\" (guesting as Santa Claus) and the Life of Riley as Punchy (a punch drunk ex-prize fighter). He also appeared on \"Escape\", \"The Man Called X\", \"Suspense,\" \"NBC University Theater\", \"On Stage\", \"The CBS Radio Workshop\", \"Rogue's Gallery\", and \"The Six Shooter\".\n\nMerrill was the narrator for \"Retribution\", a \"psychological mystery series.\"\n\nMerrill first appeared in film with the 1935 Columbia Pictures production \"The Black Room\"; he played the Story Teller in Trailer, though he was left uncredited. His formal debut in movies came in the 1939 Universal Studios production \"Tropic Fury\". He appeared sporadically in films throughout the next three decades, often in small roles along with several uncredited appearances.\n\nIn his later years, Merrill continued doing voice-over work, regularly doing film trailer narration work for American International Pictures. Merrill narrated trailers for films such as \"It Conquered the World\", \"I Was a Teenage Werewolf\", \"War of the Colossal Beast\", \"Teenage Cave Man\", \"Night of the Blood Beast\", \"A Bucket of Blood\", \"Horrors of the Black Museum\", \"The Angry Red Planet\", \"Master of the World\", and \"Burn, Witch, Burn\".\n\nMerrill died on April 7, 1963 in Los Angeles, California, aged 51.\n\nMerrill had two adopted daughters.\n"}

Their repertoire was derived in part from the Dunster Dunces, an earlier Harvard a cappella group that was active from 1946 until 1968. Their first public concert was at Yale University in November 1979, amidst the pageantry of the Harvard-Yale football game.\n\nThe group performed in their first film in 1982, entitled \"First Affair\" and starring Melissa Sue Anderson and Loretta Swit. They also appeared in the movie \"Mona Lisa Smile\", a 2003 film starring Julia Roberts that was set at Wellesley College.\n\nThe Harvard Din & Tonics celebrated their fortieth anniversary with a concert at Harvard's Sanders Theater on April 13, 2019.\n\nPreviously an all-male ensemble, the group admitted its first woman member in 2018, and a second in 2019.\n\nThe name \"Din & Tonics\" is a pun on the popular drink the gin and tonic, and the words \"din\", meaning a loud noise, and \"tonic\", a musical term meaning the first note of a musical scale. The lime green socks worn by the group's members are said to represent the lime that is traditionally served with the gin and tonic, hence the group's slogan, \"\"A cappella\" with a twist.\"\n\nThe Dins, composed of 12 to 15 undergraduate students, is an entirely self-directed group. Most of their arrangements are written by current or former members of the group. Their repertoire consists primarily of jazz standards from the Great American Songbook, as well as humor songs drawn from various periods and styles. Their repertoire also extends at times to numerous other genres, including folk, rock, calypso, spiritual, and pop. They regularly perform in white tie, tails, and their signature lime green socks.\n\nThe Din and Tonics began performing their own arrangement of \"Sh-Boom\" (generally regarded as the first popular doo-wop song after it became a #1 hit on the \"Billboard\" charts in 1954) in 1979. It has served as the Dins' signature song, and they have performed it at almost every concert since. \"Sh-Boom\" is featured on fourteen of the group's fifteen albums.\n\nThe Dins have appeared on television shows, including \"The Price Is Right\" and \"Good Morning America\", and have performed the \"Star Spangled Banner\" for the San Francisco Giants, the Tampa Bay Lightning, the Los Angeles Lakers, the PGA’s Ryder Cup, the Boston Red Sox and the New York Yankees, the Boston Celtics, the Boston Bruins, and the Boston Breakers.\n\nThe Dins have performed overseas since the founding of the group, and began touring Asia regularly in the late 1980s. Since 1990, the Dins have gone on world tours biennially. Each tour is between 2 and 3 months long and includes performances in roughly 15 countries in Europe, Africa, Asia, Australia and North America. Additionally, they travel regularly to Vail, Colorado, Washington, D.C., New York City and spend spring break performing in Bermuda or Whistler, BC.\n\nThe Dins have toured in: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, China, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Egypt, Fiji, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Mexico, Morocco, Nepal, Serbia, Singapore, Slovenia, South Korea, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, the United Kingdom, and the Vatican City.\n\nWhile on tour in 2010, the Dins performed at the closing ceremonies for the Shanghai Expo music festival.\n\nIn January 2017 the Dins performed the National Anthem for the Los Angeles Lakers at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, following a performance with the Harvard Krokodiloes for the Harvard Club of Southern California.\n\nThe Dins have performed for jazz vocalists Ella Fitzgerald and Bobby McFerrin, for members of the New York Voices, singer Lionel Richie, jazz pianist Herbie Hancock, jazz trumpeter Wynton Marsalis, former governor and professional wrestler Jesse Ventura, actresses Julia Roberts, Kristin Chenoweth, Sharon Stone, Jessica Lange, Kathie Lee Gifford, and Kathleen Turner, television host Conan O'Brien, actor Andy Garcia, comedian Jackie Mason, Maestro Keith Lockhart of the Boston Pops, cellist Yo-Yo Ma, Caroline Kennedy, former U.S. President Bill Clinton, as well as the Governor of Bermuda and the U.S. ambassadors to Australia, Germany, Greece, Nepal, Ireland, Morocco, Norway, Italy and Belgium.\n\nDuring their world tour, the Dins have recently performed with the award-winning German vocal quintet Vocaldente and Icelandic vocalist Andrea Gylfadóttir.\n\nMore recently, the Dins performed for John Williams and the assembled graduates at Harvard's 366th Commencement, to celebrate his distinguished career. The group performed an original medley of his most notable songs, ranging from \"Jaws\" to \"Star Wars\" and \"Indiana Jones\".\n\nThey have appeared in the films \"Mona Lisa Smile\" and \"First Affair.\n\n\nThe Din and Tonics have produced 17 albums thus far:\n\n\n"}

It runs a distance of 38 km between Lilydale and Warburton, along the former Warburton railway line. A section between Corduroy Road in Yarra Junction and Warburton is also known as the Centenary Trail.\n\nThe trail begins at Lilydale and passes through the townships of Mount Evelyn, Wandin, Seville, Woori Yallock, Launching Place, Yarra Junction, Wesburn and Millgrove, ending at Warburton.\n\nSince the closure of the Warburton railway line in July 1965 and the dismantling of the track in the 1970s the land had remained vacant. In 1984 and again in 1996 the state government investigated selling off the land, but withdrew these proposals in part due to community opposition.\n\nSince its establishment in 1996 the trail has been continually developed and maintained by a combination of local volunteers, particularly the Friends of the Lilydale to Warburton Rail Trail, as well the Local Council and State and Federal governments. Over several years a significant amount of effort went into clearing the land, restoring 13 bridges and surfacing of the trail. Negotiations were undertaken with neighbouring farmers who had previously occupied the reserve to erect fencing and gates where necessary.\n\nBy 1998 the trail was continuous from Maroondah Highway, Lilydale to the site of the former Warburton station, with only a relatively short section between Lilydale Station and Maroondah Highway remaining incomplete.\n\nThe remaining section of the trail, a bridge across the Maroondah Highway, was completed in early 2011. The next stage of improvements to the trail is a crossing at York Road in Mount Evelyn, which should be completed mid-2011.\n\nAlthough the trail is continuous from Lilydale to Warburton, it does not completely adhere to the former Warburton rail line's alignment. Some from Lilydale station, just before a historic bridge where the original alignment of Anderson Street passed over the railway, the trail deviates around the north, east and south of Mount Lilydale Mercy College. The school currently leases the land formerly occupied by the railway, which connects the old school grounds south-west of the line with an extension on the north-east. The southern end of the deviation rises to meet the original alignment of the trail at a steep grade that makes it unsuitable for wheelchairs.\n\n\n\n"}

Kalayaan's annual budget is 47 million pesos (about $1.1 million).\n\nPag-asa Island has an airstrip, a 5-bed lying-in clinic, and a small elementary school.\n\nOnce strictly a military installation, Pag-asa was opened to civilian settlement in 2002.\n\nThere are records of the island having been inhabited, at various times in history, by the Chinese and by people from the Champa Kingdom of Vietnam, and during the second world war, French Indochina and Imperial Japanese troops. However, there were no large settlements on these islands till 1956, when Filipino lawyer, businessman, adventurer and fishing magnate Tomás Cloma decided to \"claim\" a part of Spratly islands as his own, naming it the \"Free Territory of Freedomland\".\n\nIn 1946, Vice President Elpidio Quirino reiterated the \"New Southern Islands\", the forerunner name for Kalayaan, as part of the Philippines.\n\nIn 1947, Tomás Cloma \"discovered\" a group of several uninhabited and unoccupied islands/islets in the vastness of the Luzon Sea.\n\nOn May 11, 1956, together with forty men, Tomás Cloma took formal possession of the islands, lying some 380 miles west of the southern end of Palawan and named them the \"Free Territory of Freedomland\". Four days later Cloma issued and posted copies of his \"Notice to the Whole World\" on each of the islands as \"a decisive manifestation of unwavering claim over the territory\".\n\nOn May 31, 1956, Cloma declared the establishment of the Free Territory of Freedomland, ten days after he sent his second representation to the Secretary of Foreign Affairs, informing the latter that the territory claimed was named \"Freedomland\".\n\nOn July 6, 1956, Cloma declared to the whole world his claim and the establishment of a separate government for the \"Free Territory of Freedomland\" with its capital on Flat Island (Patag Island). His declaration was met with violent and unfriendly reactions from several neighboring countries especially the Republic of China (ROC; on Taiwan since 1949) when on September 24, 1956 it effectively garrisoned the nearby island of Itu Aba and intercepted Cloma's men and vessels found within its immediate waters.\n\nIn 1974, Cloma ceded his rights over the islands for one peso, after being imprisoned by Ferdinand Marcos.\n\nPresident Ferdinand E. Marcos created the Municipality of Kalayaan by signing \"Presidential Decree 1596\" into law on June 11, 1978.

The Republic of China (Taiwan)'s solitary island is the largest in the archipelago at approximately 43 hectares. Vietnam occupies 21 islets and reefs. Malaysia claims 7 reefs including Layang Layang which currently hosts a naval base and a diving resort.

The Long Beach have two (2) rocky cliffs interrupting the continuous expanse of approximately 14.7 kilometers of sugary white sand beach dividing it into three (3) coves. It is the longest white sand beach in the Philippines and is the flagship of the Municipality. The Long Beach spans to the coastline of four barangays namely Poblacion, New Agutaya, San Isidro and Alimanguan.\n\nIn 1952, migrants from Manamoc, an island of the Cuyo Archipelago, arrived in a place called Malagnang ( muddy/ maputik) a sitio of Kemdeng, formerly part of Puerto Princesa City. The first to arrive were the Dandal brothers (Anastacio, Ricardo, and Lauro), Alberto Radam, and Marcelino Gadiano with their families. After sometime their relatives followed forming a small community which gave rise to the election of Anastascio Dandal as the first Barrio Lieutenant.\n\nThe small ethnic group of Agutaynon and Cuyunon increased in number and with the increase disputes emerged particularly in the choice of the Town’s Patron Saint. The Cuyunon wanted Saint Vincent Ferrer while the choice of Agutaynon was Saint Isidro Labrador. The group decided to resolve the issue by drawing a lot. The name of Saint Vincent Ferrer was drawn thus the name Malagnang was changed to San Vicente.\n\nThe municipality of San Vicente was created on June 21, 1969, by virtue of Republic Act 5821. It officially functioned as distinct municipality on January 2, 1972.\n\nSan Vicente is nestled in the north-west of Palawan’s mainland, bounded by the Philippine West Sea in the West, the municipality of Taytay in the north, Roxas in the East and City of Puerto Princesa in the Southwest. With a forest area of 82,080.09 hectares and 22 identified islands and islets within its municipal boundaries. San Vicente is located in the north-western side of the main island of Palawan and is 186 kilometers from Puerto Princesa City. It occupies a total land area of 165,797.6525 hectares.\n\nSan Vicente is politically subdivided into 11 barangays.\n\nIn the , the population of San Vicente, Palawan, was people, with a density of .\n\nIn the 2010 NSO Census, San Vicente had a total population of 30,919 at a growth rate of 6%. Population increased by 3,500 from 27,065 in 2008 based on CBMS survey within a 2-year gap. The total number of households was 6,460 with average household size of 5 members.\n\nAs with the general climate of the Philippine Archipelago, San Vicente's dry season begins in December, lasting until the month of May while the onset of the wet or rainy season is in June, usually drying up again in November. Northestern winds, the amihan prevail from November to May. Rough coastal waters characterize the season of habagat, or the south-western winds.\n\nFishing and farming are the major economic activities in San Vicente wherein 29.50% and 25.77% respectively are engaged in it. Rice and coconut are the major agricultural crops and fish products are adequate in the municipality.\n\nSan Vicente is predominantly fishing and a farming municipality and now gaining recognition as a center of interest for Tourism. San Vicente can offer a diverse range of attractions for adventure and nature enthusiasts. Roads and other infrastructure support facilities are now on its implementation process through the help of the National Government.\n\nAs San Vicente Palawan slowly emerges to become one of the tourism hot spot in the Philippines, the real industry sector becomes dramatically stronger. Many land owners who have more than tens of thousand hectare properties have earned millions of pesos on selling their lots to investors. Beach front properties sell like pancakes in the real estate market.\n\nMany millionaires have ventured into land banking in San Vicente Palawan with its robust potential, earning exponentially from re-selling their acquired properties. Historically, rice field properties were sold at P300,000 per hectare in 2014. Three years later, an hectare big usually costs P3,000,000, with another increase after the San Vicente Airport started servicing small commercial planes.\n\nThe introduction of the San Vicente Flagship TEZ was initiated with the marking of a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) between the TIEZA and the nearby government unit (LGU) of San Vicente in 2013 – a fearless advance of the neighborhood organization to uphold association and set the course into tourism improvement.\n\nTo meet the vision proclamation as the Flagship TEZ and to be a model goal, a Tourism Master Plan was defined to coordinate, control and accomplish adjusted formative pushes and methodologies of the LGU towards an independent, socially capable and naturally stable group. The Tourism Master Plan expects to advance and encourage feasible and reasonable improvement in the region.\n\nIn light of the Integrated Tourism Master Plan for the Long Beach range, the Flagship TEZ should be zoned by its attributes and into topics to create tourism items, for example, however not restricted to sun and shoreline, relaxation and stimulation, recreational and sports tourism, eco-tourism and agri-tourism.\n\nSan Vicente Palawan Master Plan contains significant information about San Vicente, tourism projections based on other famous tourist destinations, proposed developments and proposed restrictions. The Master Plan also identifies key areas and divided San Vicente Palawan into 4 clusters, based on development and tourism potentials.\n\nThe diversity of San Vicente derives from its 24 ethno-linguistic resident groups, each with their own distinct dialects, and culture heritage. Filipino (Tagalog), however, remains the dominant \"lingua franca\" these diverse people that comprise San Vicente populace. In homage to its patron saint, San Vicente Ferrer, the municipality celebrates its town fiesta from April 1–5, Foundation Day on June 21 and Malagnang Festival on June 17–21 of every year.\n\nThe municipality as well as the northern municipalities of Palawan is served by the San Vicente Airport.\n\nThere are five barangays which are partly served by electricity. The present source of electricity are a 1 unit 500 KW, 1 unit 250 KW and 1 unit 160 KW generating sets operated by National Power Corporation (NAPOCOR) which is sold to consumers through Palawan Electric Cooperative (PALECO). Serving 24 hours since December 2014.\n\nThe town has a water system which comes from the surface water of Little Baguio Falls.\n\nThere are two telecommunication companies, SMART and GLOBE which have installed cell site facilities in Sitio Pinagmangalucan in Barangay Poblacion, Barangay Alimanguan, Barangay Binga, Barangay Port Barton and Barangay Caruray. These modern facilities have made communication much easier, faster and convenient. Likewise cable and internet connection is already available in Barangays Poblacion, Alimanguan and Port Barton.\n\nEndowed with white sand beaches, coral reefs, islands and islets, waterfalls, vast forest cover, mangroves, and varied endemic flora, San Vicente serves as habitat for 23 of the 25 wildlife species found in the island of Palawan.\n\n"}

According to the , it has a population of people.\nSince 2002, its Cathedral of St. Joseph the Worker is the episcopal see of the pre-diocesan missionary Apostolic Vicariate of Taytay.\n\nBefore the Spanish colonization, The Kingdom of Taytay was ruled by a monarch noted as followed everywhere at any given time by ten scribes. The crew of Ferdinand Magellan held the Taytay king and queen for ransom after escaping the Battle of Mactan where Magellan was slain. They intended to secure more supplies as they plan to cross into the Moluccas where the Portuguese were so help could be sought. The native king and his subjects complied with the demands and even added more food supplies than what they asked for. This was duly recorded by Antonio Pigafetta, Magellan's chronicler, who was on board in one of the ships when these events took place.\n\nPigafetta also took note of one curious thing in the kingdom. He found the natives fond of cockfighting, long before this pastime was seen or even heard of in the Western Hemisphere.\n\nDuring the Spanish colonization of the Philippines, Taytay was formally founded in 1623. Taytay became the capital of the province of \"Calamianes\", the entire territory of Paragua (now Palawan), in 1818; and the province of \"Castilla\", a land area occupying the northern part of Palawan, in 1858.\n\nArchived baptismal records of Cuyo, Palawan show that the last monarch of the Kingdom of Taytay was converted to Christianity and christened Flores de los Santos Cabaylo meaning Cabaylo, Flower of the Saints. No other sovereign royal datu after him ruled in his kingdom. King Cabaylo's descendants include the present clans of Cabaylo-Manlavi-Gabinete-Macolor as main genealogical roots. His Royal Highness Datu Dr. Fernando Macolor Cruz who hailed from the Cabailo-Manlavi-Gabinete-Macolor line of the royal house is the present pretender and sole claimant to the most serene and ancient throne of the Kingdom of Taytay.\n\nDuring the American era, Taytay ceased being Palawan's capital, and its administrative boundary was reduced by approximately 500,000 hectares upon the creation of the Municipality of El Nido in 1916.\n\nThe historic Taytay Fort, the \"Fuerza de Santa Isabel\", built in 1667 under the Augustinian Recollect Fathers and named in honor of Spain's Queen Isabela II in the 19th century, was used as a military station during that period. This famous relic was completed in 1738. It was mainly used to defend against Muslim warrior-raiders in their colorful war boats while the Spanish soldiers fire at them with their huge cannons. The fort's small chapel and cannons are still intact. The fort is now under the supervision of the National Museum. The Moro action must be understood not as an act of piracy but as a showdown of power and challenge to Spanish hegemony over the islands. It can be viewed as the Tausug's efforts to recover what was once theirs. Similar raids were also carried out against Christian converts in Spanish Cuyo, Dumaran, Linapacan and Culion.\n\nIn 1957, the Island of Dibangan was constituted into a barrio.\n\nTaytay is politically subdivided into 31 barangays.\n\nIn the , the population of Taytay, Palawan, was people, with a density of .\n\n"}
{"id": "2171817", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2171817", "title": "Miranda July", "text": "Miranda July\n\nMiranda July (born Miranda Jennifer Grossinger; February 15, 1974) is an American film director, screenwriter, singer, actress, author and artist. Her body of work includes film, fiction, monologue, digital media presentations, and live performance art.\n\nShe wrote, directed and starred in the films \"Me and You and Everyone We Know\" (2005) and \"The Future\" (2011). She has authored a book of short stories, \"No One Belongs Here More Than You\" (2007); a collection of nonfiction short stories, \"It Chooses You\" (2011); and the novel \"The First Bad Man\" (2015).\n\nJuly was born in Barre, Vermont, in 1974, the daughter of Lindy Hough and Richard Grossinger. Her parents, who taught at Goddard College at the time, are both writers. They were also the founders of North Atlantic Books, a publisher of alternative health, martial arts, and spiritual titles. Her father was Jewish, and her mother was Protestant.\n\nJuly was encouraged to work on her short fiction by author and friend of a friend Rick Moody. She grew up in Berkeley, California, where she first began staging plays at a local punk rock club. She attended The College Preparatory School in Oakland for high school. When she was 16, she wrote and directed a play titled \"The Lifers\", for which she cast 20 Latina women as actresses. She describes this as an experience that pushed her heavily. She later attended UC Santa Cruz, dropping out in her second year.\n\nAfter leaving college, she moved to Portland, Oregon, and took up performance art, or \"one woman shows\". Her performances were successful; she has been quoted as saying she has not worked a day job since she was 23 years old. In an interview for Tate, she explains that she still tries to practice performance, partially due to its stark differences from filmmaking, such as its live audience or how \"present\" it is in comparison. Portland is also where she began participating in the riot grrrl scene that was beginning to grow in the early 1990s.\n\nIn the early stages of her film career, she created several small video projects and performances years prior to her feature film, \"Me and You and Everyone We Know.\" However, while she worked on her art, July had to work several odd jobs to survive, such as being a waitress, a tastemaker for Coca-Cola, and a stripper.\n\nJuly was immersed in the riot grrl scene in Portland and motivated by its DIY ethos, and she began an effort that she described as \"a free alternative distribution system for women movie-makers\". One of July's reasons for starting the project was to apply the concepts of Riot grrrl into the film making world. The idea was to connect as many women artists as possible, let them see each other's work, and foster a sense of community. Participants sent a self-made short film to July, who mailed back a compilation videotape containing that film and nine others – a \"chainletter tape\". When it began in 1995, the project was called \"Big Miss Moviola\" but was soon renamed \"Joanie4Jackie\". July also credits the project to the loneliness she was experiencing at the time, but felt she learned from the project immensely, saying \"that was my film school\". July's first film, \"Atlanta\", appears on the second tape of the series. July continued to run the project for years, handing it off to the film department of Bard College in 2003.\n\nIn 2017 the Getty Research Institute announced that they had acquired an archive of \"Joanie4Jackie\" as a donation from July. The collection includes more than 200 titles from the 1990s and 2000s, videos from \"Joanie4Jackie\" events, booklets, posters, hand-written letters from participants, and other documentation. Thomas W. Gaehtgens, the director of the Getty Research Institute, stated that the acquisition is \"an esteemed addition to our Special Collections that connects to work by many important 20th century artists who are also represented in our archives, such as Eleanor Antin, Yvonne Rainer and Carolee Schneemann.\"\n\n\"Filmmaker\" rated her number one in their \"25 New Faces of Indie Film\" in 2004. After winning a slot in a Sundance workshop, she developed her first feature-length film, \"Me and You and Everyone We Know\", which opened in 2005.\n\nThe film won The \"Caméra d'Or\" prize in The Cannes Festival 2005 as well as the Special Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival, Best First Feature at the Philadelphia Film Festival, Feature Audience Award for Best Narrative Feature at the San Francisco International Film Festival, and the Audience Award for Best Narrative Feature at the Los Angeles Film Festival.\n\nOn May 16, 2007, July mentioned that she was currently working on a new film. This film was originally titled \"Satisfaction\" but was later renamed \"The Future\", with July in a lead role. The film premiered at the 2011 Sundance Film Festival.\n\nIn March 2018, it was announced July would write and direct a heist film, with Brad Pitt and Youree Henley producing the film, under their Plan B Entertainment and Annapurna Pictures banners, respectively. That same month, Evan Rachel Wood, Richard Jenkins, Debra Winger and Gina Rodriguez joined the cast of the film. In June 2018, Mark Ivanir joined the cast of the film. Principal photography began in May 2018.\n\nHer short video \"The Amateurist\" (1998) features a dowdy researcher examining, via her own video monitor, a stereotypical \"beautiful woman\"; July plays both roles. A lengthier video, the 27-minute \"Nest of Tens\" (2000), juxtaposes four unrelated scenarios in which \"seemingly everyday people go about acting completely normal while demonstrating distinct abnormality\". \"Nest of Tens\" has been placed in the permanent online collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.\nWayne Wang consulted with July about aspects of his 2001 feature-length film \"The Center of the World\", for which she received a story credit. July appears as herself in the 2017 documentary \"\". She was interviewed for the film \"!Women Art Revolution\".\n\nShe recorded her first EP for Kill Rock Stars in 1996, titled \"Margie Ruskie Stops Time\", with music by The Need. She released two full-length LPs, \"10 Million Hours A Mile\" in 1997 and \"The Binet-Simon Test\" in 1998, both on Kill Rock Stars. She collaborated with Calvin Johnson in his musical project Dub Narcotic Sound System, and in 1999 she made a split EP with IQU, released on Johnson's K Records.\n\nJuly has acted in many of her own short films, including \"Atlanta\", \"The Amateurist\", \"Nest of Tens\", \"Are You The Favorite Person of Anyone?\", and her feature-length films \"Me and You and Everyone We Know\" and \"The Future\". She also made an appearance in the film \"Jesus' Son\" (1998). She appeared in an episode of \"Portlandia\" in 2012. She co-starred in Josephine Decker’s 2018 feature film, \"Madeline's Madeline\".\n\nIn 1998, July made \"Love Diamond\", her first full-length multimedia performance piece – in her description, a \"live movie.\" This two-hour stage work had July playing multiple characters, humorously depicting women's perceived cultural roles. This was followed by a second full-length performance piece, \"The Swan Tool\", and a six-minute film, \"Getting Stronger Every Day\" (2001). The latter is an abstract view of a grown man and a little girl, seemingly taunted by indistinct floating shapes while an offscreen narrator recounts a tale of real-life pedophilia. \"The Swan Tool\" is another \"live movie\", a one-woman show in which July plays Lisa Cobb, a woman searching for her lost body. Although it's peppered with deadpan comedy, the surrealist story concerns \"childhood sexual traumas, adult alienation, and persistent, unfocused guilt\".\n\nIn 2006, after completing her first feature film, she went on to create another multimedia piece, \"Things We Don't Understand and Definitely Are Not Going To Talk About\", which she performed in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and New York. This stage show contained several ideas that would become key elements of her later film, \"The Future.\n\nIn March 2015, July premiered her performance work \"New Society\" as part of the 58th San Francisco International Film Festival. In the program for the performance, July requested the audience not share details of the show, stating it is now \"a rare sensation to sit down in a theater with no idea what will happen.\"\n\nWith artist Harrell Fletcher, July founded the online arts project called \"Learning to Love You More\" (2002–2009). The project's website offered assignments to artists whose submissions became part of \"an ever-changing series of exhibitions, screenings and radio broadcasts presented all over the world\". Over 8,000 people participated in the project. In addition to its Internet presentations, \"Learning to Love You More\" also compiled exhibitions for the Whitney Museum, the Seattle Art Museum, and other hosts. A book version of the project's online art was released in 2007. Starting May 1, 2009 the project's website stopped accepting assignment submissions. In 2010 the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art acquired the website, to preserve it as an archive of the project online.\n\nJuly constructed a sculptural exhibition, \"Eleven Heavy Things\", for the 2009 Venice Biennale. Its assortment of cartoonish shapes, made sturdy with fiberglass and steel, were designed for playful interaction by visitors. The exhibition was also shown in New York City at Union Square Park and in Los Angeles at the MOCA Pacific Design Center.\n\nIn 2013 she organized \"We Think Alone\", an art project involving the private emails of public figures. Unredacted except for the recipients' names, the emails were freely donated by a disparate group of notable persons including author Sheila Heti, theoretical physicist Lee Smolin, basketball player Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and actress Kirsten Dunst. July grouped selected emails by topic, and sent a new set to the project's subscribers every week for 20 weeks. As one reviewer described them, the emails are \"simultaneously mundane and eerily revealing; they shed light on how people in the public eye craft their private identities... [they] also underscore, in some way, the way all of us present ourselves over email: excessively formal or passive-aggressive, lovey-dovey, flakey, overly excited.\"\n\nIn 2014 she created an iOS app, Somebody, which allows users to compose a message to be delivered to someone else in-person, or to deliver someone else's message in-person. When you send your friend a message through Somebody, it goes – not to your friend – but to the Somebody user nearest your friend. This person (likely a stranger) delivers the message verbally, acting as your stand-in. Somebody is a far-reaching public art project that incites performance and twists our love of avatars and outsourcing – every relationship becomes a three-way. The project was funded by Miu Miu. The app closed on October 31, 2015.\n\nAs much as a filmmaker, July is also an author, mostly of short stories. Writing was something she did years before her first feature premiered. July in a 2016 interview explains that out of all the mediums she pursues, she is the least confident in her film making, partially because of the less familiar and hyper hierarchical and collaborative environment. She knows most people on her sets have never taken orders from a femme film director, and so she explains that there is an air of confidence you need to be that role.\n\nHer short story \"The Boy from Lam Kien\" was published in 2005 by Cloverfield Press, as a special-edition book with illustration by Elinor Nissley and Emma Hedditch. Another short story, \"Something That Needs Nothing\", was published in the following year by \"The New Yorker\".\n\n\"No One Belongs Here More Than You,\" July's collection of short vignettes, was published by Scribner in 2007.\n\nIt won the Frank O'Connor International Short Story Award on September 24, 2007. In \"The New York Times\", Sheelah Kolhatkar gave the collection a mixed review: \"A handful of these stories are sweet and revealing, although in many cases the attempt to create 'art' is too self-conscious, and the effort comes off as pointlessly strange.\"\n\nAs of 2015 the collection has more than 200,000 copies in circulation.\n\nJuly's non-fiction story collection \"It Chooses You\" was published by McSweeney's in 2011.\n\nWhile procrastinating the writing of her screenplay \"The Future\" in 2009, July crisscrossed Los Angeles accompanied by photographer Brigitte Sireto to meet a random selection of \"PennySaver\" sellers, glimpsing thirteen surprisingly moving and profoundly specific realities, along the way shaping her film, and herself, in unexpected ways. The work received mixed reviews with fans citing the collection's \"lasting impression\" of realistic struggle and critics citing the mumblecore-influenced artist's writing style as a \"cheap trick\" in text-format. \n\nJuly's first novel \"The First Bad Man\" was published by Scribner in January 2015. The narrative centers around Cheryl Glickman, a middle-aged woman in crisis whose life abruptly changes course when a young woman, named Clee, moves into her home. The novel explores the complex relationship between Cheryl and Clee.\n\nIn her review for \"The New York Times Book Review\", reviewer Lauren Groff writes \"The First Bad Man\" \"makes for a wry, smart companion on any day. It's warm. It has a heartbeat and a pulse. This is a book that is painfully alive.\"\n\nJuly was heavily inspired by the riot grrrl movement. She was friends with several of the bands who were part of the movement such as Bikini Kill, Excuse 17, and Heavens to Betsy.\n\nHer films have a common theme of \"intimacy\". For example, many of her work's titles use pronouns (\"me\", \"you\", \"we\", etc.). July creates \"slice of life\" films using ordinary characters and giving them attention within her films. She describes this as her being, \"desperate to bring people together\". However, as she's aged she's become more interested in how people sabotage coming together.\n\nJuly receives criticism for being too \"niche\" or trying too hard to seem \"quirky\". According to \"The New York Times,\" \"July has come to personify everything infuriating about the Etsy-shopping, Wes Anderson-quoting, McSweeney's-reading, coastal-living category of upscale urban bohemia that flourished in the aughts\". She often gets lumped in with directors like Wes Anderson and Noah Baumbach, but says she gets more push back than them due to her films being so emotional and feminine, being called \"precious\" and \"twee\". In this same interview with \"The New York Times,\" July explains that she likes the directors she's been compared to, but they never get criticized for making films about themselves, though she as a femme filmmaker often gets labelled as \"self-obsessed\". In a 2015 \"Guardian\" article, July adds, \"Yes, it's pretty clear that ‘whimsical’ is a diminishing word, [...] I almost think asking the question is like I'm being asked to gossip about myself. I think it's kind of a female thing, being asked to gossip about yourself. I think I'm maybe done with that.\"\n\nJuly also often includes the theme of sex in her film making. \"The New York Times\" describes this theme \"as both a sudden surprise and a way to illuminate the inner lives of her characters\". July elaborates: “I was always interested in sex, even as a kid. Sex includes shame and humiliation and fantasies and longing. It’s so dense with the kinds of things I’m interested in.”\n\nShe has also expressed her interest for rhythm and feeling within film than being necessarily “inspired” by other filmmakers, she states that she wouldn't call herself a “cinephile”.\n\nIn between \"You, Me, And Everyone We Know\" and \"The Future\", July began to incorporate some of the oddball avant-garde things she had done in theater performance into her films, some of which was easier to swallow on stage but not on screen, such as the talking cat in \"The Future\", which she was later criticized for by viewers.\n\nJuly also has a strong interest in clothing and costume. She served as the lookbook creative director for Uniqlo UT's 2019 clothing line.\n\nJuly is married to artist and film director Mike Mills, with whom she has a son. July and Mills met at both of their first Sundance Festival premieres in 2006, and married in the summer of 2009.\n\nIn a 2007 interview with \"Bust\" magazine, July spoke of the importance which feminism has had in her life, saying, \"What's confusing about [being a feminist]? It's just being pro-your ability to do what you need to do. It doesn't mean you don't love your boyfriend or whatever... When I say 'feminist', I mean that in the most complex, interesting, exciting way!\" In another interview she had on Idaho's Public Television station, she explains that once she started confronting the racial issues addressed in current day politics, she started contacting publishers and revising her work, realizing not everything she had said was racially and politically sound.\n\nShe thought up the last name \"July\" when she was 15, inspired by a story she read in a zine, and then proceeded to change her name legally in her early 20s.\n\nJuly describes her family as very \"DIY\", which probably accounts for some of July's makeshift style.

This is in contrast to the slightly \"anteverted\" uterus that most women have, which is oriented forward toward the bladder, with the anterior part slightly concave.\n\nBetween 1 in 3 and 1 in 5 women (depending on the source) have a retroverted uterus, which is oriented backwards towards the spine.\n\nThe following table distinguishes among some of the terms used for the position of the uterus:\n\nA retroverted uterus should be distinguished from the following:\n\nAdditional terms include:\n\nIn most cases, a retroverted uterus is a normal variation present from birth. There are other factors, however, that can cause the uterus to become retroverted. Pelvic surgery, pelvic adhesions, endometriosis, fibroids, pelvic inflammatory disease, or the labor of childbirth can change the position of the uterus to retroverted.\n\nA retroverted uterus is usually noted during a routine pelvic examination or with an internal ultrasound. \n\nIt usually does not pose any medical problems, though it can be associated with dyspareunia (pain during sexual intercourse) and dysmenorrhea (pain during menstruation).\n\nRarely, a retroverted uterus is due to a disease such as endometriosis, an infection or prior surgery. Those conditions, but not the position of the uterus itself, can reduce fertility in some cases. A tipped uterus will usually move to the middle of the pelvis during the 10th to 12th week of pregnancy. Rarely (1 in 3000 to 8000 pregnancies) a retroverted uterus will cause painful and difficult urination, and can cause severe urinary retention. Treatment for this condition (called \"incarcerated uterus\") includes manual anteversion of the uterus, and usually requires intermittent or continuous catheter drainage of the bladder until the problem is rectified or spontaneously resolves by the natural enlargement of the uterus, which brings it out of the tipped position. In addition to manual anteversion and bladder drainage, treatment of urinary retention due to retroverted uterus can require the use of a pessary, or even surgery, but often is as simple as having the pregnant mother sleep on her stomach for a day or two, to allow the retroverted uterus to move forward.\n\nIf a uterus does not reposition, it may be labeled \"persistent\".\n\nTreatment options are rarely needed, and include exercises, a pessary, manual repositioning, and surgery.\n\n\n"}

It is largely coextensive with the Darwin/Palmerston metropolitan area. The only other division in the territory, the Division of Lingiari, covers the remainder of the territory.\n\nThe division was one of the two established when the former Division of Northern Territory was redistributed on 21 December 2000. \nIt is named for Hon Vaiben Louis Solomon, a Premier of South Australia, a delegate to the second Constitutional convention and member of the first Australian Parliament. He represented the Northern Territory in the South Australian House of Assembly, when it was still part of that state.\n\nThe Division was first contested at the 2001 federal election. Although the Darwin/Palmerston area had historically been a stronghold for the Country Liberal Party at the territorial level, recent gains by Labor have made it much more competitive. It has taken on a character similar to mortgage belt seats. As such, for most of its history, it has been a marginal seat usually held by the party of government.\n\nThe CLP's Dave Tollner very narrowly won the seat in 2001, then increased his majority in 2004 before narrowly losing it to Labor's Damian Hale at the 2007 election, where Labour won a landslide victory. At the 2010 election, the CLP's Natasha Griggs won Solomon back with a two-party-preferred margin of 1.75 percent from a 1.94 percent swing. She therefore became the first opposition member in the seat's history. Griggs was re-elected with a reduced two-party margin of 1.4 percent at the 2013 election as the Coalition won government.\n\nA MediaReach seat-level opinion poll in Solomon of 513 voters conducted 22−23 June during the 2016 election campaign unexpectedly found Labor heavily leading the Liberals 61–39 on the two-party vote from a large 12.4 percent swing.\n\nGriggs and the CLP lost Solomon to Labor's Luke Gosling at the 2016 election held on 2 July, with Gosling becoming the first Labor candidate to win the primary vote and defeating Griggs on a 56–44 two-party vote from a record 7.4 percent swing—in both cases, the strongest result in the seat's history. Gosling is the second opposition member to hold the seat. This was later seen as a forerunner to the CLP's disastrous performance at the NT general election held later that year, where the party won just 2 seats out of 25. Gosling retained the seat in 2019 with a reduced majority.\n\n"}

Along with phenelzine and tranylcypromine, it is one of only three classical MAOIs still available for clinical use in the treatment of psychiatric disorders in the United States, though it is not as commonly employed in comparison to the others.\n\nIsocarboxazid is primarily used to treat mood and anxiety disorders. It has also been investigated in the treatment of Parkinson's disease and other dementia-related disorders. Isocarboxazid, as well as other MAOIs, increase the levels of the monoamine neurotransmitters serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine in the brain.\nClassical MAOIs, including isocarboxazid, are used only very rarely due to prominent food and drug interactions and have been largely superseded by newer antidepressants such as the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). The cause of the interactions is because MAOIs inhibit the metabolism of dietary amines (e.g., tyramine) and the monoamine neurotransmitters. In combination with other drugs that increase the levels of the monoamine neurotransmitters such as the SSRIs, or with certain foods high in dietary amines such as aged cheeses, MAOIs can produce dangerous elevations of monoamine neurotransmitters resulting in potentially life-threatening syndromes such as hypertensive crisis and serotonin syndrome.\n\n"}

Kyabram is located in the centre of a rich irrigation district in the Goulburn River Valley, north of Melbourne. It is the second-largest town in the Shire of Campaspe, situated between the towns of Echuca and Shepparton and is close to the Murray River, Goulburn River, Campaspe River and Waranga Basin. As of the 2011 census the town had a population of 7,321 people and provides services to a district population of around 16,000.\n\nThe name of the town is thought to derive from an Aboriginal word Kiambram meaning \"Thick Forest\".\n\nThe Bangerang people were the original inhabitants of the Goulburn valley.\n\nThe township started in the 1870s with the first sale of town blocks held in 1876. Kyabram Post Office opened on 23 September 1878. Sheridan Post Office opened on 1 December 1884. On 8 April 1886, in anticipation of the arrival of the railway at what was then Sheridan, Kyabram was renamed Kyabram East and Sheridan was renamed Kyabram. The Kyabram Mechanics' Institute was built in 1891.\n\nJohn Allan, who lived in Kyabram from 1873, became Premier of Victoria in 1924 and Australia's first Country Party premier. Allan was associated with the Kyabram Reform Movement, a conservative political organisation formed at the start of the 20th century and led by Benjamin Goddard, a local businessman. The movement's campaign played a significant role in the downfall of the Peacock state government in June 1902 and its sound defeat in the subsequent September elections. The incoming Irvine government substantially reduced the number of state parliamentarians, a key demand of the movement.\n\nKyabram was formally proclaimed a town on 4 July 1973.\n\nThe Kyabram Magistrates' Court closed on 1 January 1990.\n\nThe district is dependent on the primary industries of dairying and fruit orchards. Henry Jones IXL, a subsidiary of SPC Ardmona, operate a plant in the town, manufacturing IXL jams. The town provides engineering, financial advisors, solicitors and accounting services to the district. Nestlé (Tongala), Southern Processing Ltd and Fonterra (Stanhope) all have food processing plants nearby.\n\nMedical and aged care services in the town include a 46-bed hospital, a 30-bed home for the aged, infant welfare centre, ambulance station, several doctors, dentists and other health practitioners. In education Kyabram has now combined three state schools (Kyabram Secondary College, Dawes Rd and Haslem St Primary Schools) to one P-12 school containing three campuses (Dawes, Haslem and Fisher). Kyabram also has a Catholic primary and secondary school (St Augustine's College), two kindergartens and the Kyabram Community & Learning Centre providing community services and adult learning opportunities for the people of Kyabram and the surrounding region. The local newspaper is called the \"Kyabram Free Press\", a part of the McPherson media group in the region, with a circulation of roughly 3,300 copies (Victorian Country Press Association 2008).\n\nSurrounding smaller towns include Merrigum (pop. 490), Lancaster, Undera, Cooma, Wyuna, Kyvalley, Girgarre, Stanhope and Tongala.\n\nAttractions include the Kyabram Fauna Park, a reserve housing five hundred species of wildlife. There are free-roaming kangaroos and emus and hides to observe a variety of water birds.\n\nPopular sports in Kyabram include Australian rules football and cricket. Jim Higgs was a spin bowler from Kyabram who played for Australia during the late 1970s. The local football team is known as the Bombers who compete in the Goulburn Valley Football League. Kyabram has produced a number of AFL recruits such as GWS utility and former Richmond best-and-fairest Brett Deledio, former Melbourne & Victorian Captain Garry Lyon, Richmond's Kayne Pettifer, Brisbane's Patrick Wearden, Hawthorn's Cohen Myers, Carlton's Nick Holman, former North Melbourne rookie Brad Mangan, and Kyabrams first AFLW's player, Julia Crockett-Grills.\nNetball and soccer are also popular in Kyabram.\n\nGolfers play at the course of the Kyabram Valley View Golf and Bowls Club on Curr Road, Mount Scobie, or at the Kyabram Parkland Golf Club, the home of the Victorian Par 3 Amateur Championships, on Racecourse Rd, Kyabram.\n\nIn 2016, former resident Kristen Hilton was appointed Victoria's Human Rights Commissioner, head of the Victorian Equal Opportunity and Human Rights Commission.\n\nKyabram is referenced by Irish singer-songwriter Declan O'Rourke on his debut album \"Since Kyabram\".

That year, he moved to San Antonio, Texas and in 1849 to Marysville, California where he engaged in mining. He then moved to Tucson, Arizona in 1856 and began a law practice and was appointed a district judge for New Mexico Territory in Mesilla. Oury was involved in the infamous Crabb Massacre of April 1857, during which no more than 100 Americans were killed after an eight-day battle with Mexican forces at Caborca, Sonora. The Americans were under the command of General Henry A. Crabb, a former California senator, who was allegedly trying to take over Sonora like the filibuster William Walker. Oury was one of the men General Crabb had recruited in Tucson, and he was given the rank of captain and ordered to follow the general into Mexico after recruiting more men. However, when news reached Tucson that a superior force of Mexicans was besieging Crabb's expedition, Major R. N. Wood and Captain Oury were sent across the international border to help their compatriots. Just after crossing the border, the rescue party encountered about 200 Mexicans. A skirmish ensued which forced the Americans back across the border into Arizona. There were no casualties on the Americans' side. Of the Crabb party, all were killed except a fourteen-year-old boy and possibly one other man depending on varying sources.\n\nAt the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861, Oury was elected to the Provisional Confederate Congress representing the Arizona Territory. Around this time, hostile Apaches attacked the town of Tubac, located south of Tucson. Over the course of a few days the Apaches besieged to old Presidio until the settlers were rescued by Oury and a small band of Confederate militia from Tucson. Tubac was destroyed and abandoned but the settlers were saved due to Oury and his men. Oury later resigned his seat in the Confederate Congress to serve as a captain in Herbert’s Battalion of Arizona cavalry in the Confederate Army. He also served as a colonel on the staff of General Henry Hopkins Sibley in Texas and Louisiana from 1862 to 1864. He took the oath of allegiance at Fort Mason in Arizona on October 8, 1865.\n\nAfter the end of the war, Oury returned to his law practice in Tucson. He was elected to the 3rd Arizona Territorial Legislature in 1866, serving as Speaker of the House that year, and was appointed Arizona Territory Attorney General in 1869. He moved to Phoenix in 1871 and was appointed district attorney for Maricopa County serving from 1871 to 1873. That year his brother, William S. Oury, was involved in the Camp Grant Massacre in which over 140 Apache men, women, and children were killed. Granville was elected in 1873 and 1875 to the 7th and 8th Arizona Territorial Legislature, serving as Speaker during the 1873 session.\n\nOury unsuccessfully ran as a Democrat for the United States House of Representatives in 1878 and was appointed district attorney for Pinal County in 1879. He was elected a Democrat to the United States House of Representatives in 1880, reelected in 1882, serving from 1881 to 1885, not running for reelection in 1884. He served as a delegate to the 1884 Democratic National Convention in Chicago, returned to Florence in 1885, and resumed practicing law. He once again served as district attorney for Pinal County in 1889 and 1890. He died of throat cancer in Tucson on January 11, 1891 and was interred in the Adamsville A.O.U.W. Cemetery in Florence.\n\nNote: According to \"Arizona Daily Star\" historical writer David Leighton, Oury Street, just north of downtown Tucson, is named in honor of the Oury brothers.\n\n\n\n Retrieved on 2008-02-13\n"}

A group of historic buildings, mostly private dwellings, centre on it. As the name suggests, it was originally a Béguinage. Today it is also the site of two churches, the Catholic \"Houten Huys\" and the English Reformed Church.\n\nThe Begijnhof is the only inner court in Amsterdam which was founded during the Middle Ages, and therefore lies within the Singel — the innermost canal of Amsterdam's circular canal system. The Begijnhof is at medieval street level, which means a meter below the rest of the old city center. \n\nIt is unclear when exactly the Begijnhof (Beguines' court) was founded. In 1346, the beguines still lived in a house (a document of that time mentioned one \"beghynhuys\"). A courtyard was only first mentioned in 1389, probably after the religious status of the city rose due to the Amsterdam Eucharistic Miracle of 1345.\n\nOriginally the Begijnhof was entirely encircled by water (the \"Nieuwezijds Voorburgwal\", the \"Spui\" and the \"Begijnensloot\" or \"Beguines' Ditch\"), with the sole entrance located at the \"Begijnensteeg\" (\"Beguines' Alley\"), which had a bridge across the Begijnensloot. The back facades were therefore water-locked. The Spui entrance only dates back to the 19th century.\n\nThe Begijnhof differs from the usual Amsterdam patricians' court in that this old people's home was not founded by private persons. It bore closer resemblance to a convent, although the beguines enjoyed greater freedom than nuns in a convent. While beguines took a vow of chastity, and while they considered themselves obliged to attend Holy Mass every day and pray various official prayers, they were free to leave the court at any time in order to get married.\n\nThe buildings in the court are tall, characteristically Amsterdam-style town-houses, emphasising the court's relatively private character. The Begijnhof is the only court whose houses have addresses bearing the name of the court itself. Unlike most courts, the houses here do not form rows joining one dwelling with another; instead, there are 47 regular town houses, each with its individual aspect, and most of them with facades from the 17th and 18th century. However, the buildings themselves are usually of earlier date, eighteen of them still possessing a Gothic wooden framework.\n\nThe ancient, restored wooden house (\"Het Houten Huys\", 34 Begijnhof) is famous as one of the two wooden houses still existing in the center of Amsterdam (the other one being Zeedijk 1); there are annexed villages like Nieuwendam (Amsterdam North) with many wooden houses and even a wooden church. This house dates from about 1528, and is the oldest wooden house in Amsterdam.\n\nThe courtyard has two bleaching greens, one on each side of the chapel.\n\nThe old Begijnesloot gate, restored in 1907, dates from 1574 and has a gable stone depicting Saint Ursula, patron saint of the Amsterdam beguines. The Spui gate from about 1725 was replaced by the present gatehouse in the 19th century. The Begijnhof has a great number of gable stones, many of which show a strong Roman Catholic character.\n\nAfter the Alteration (Protestant takeover) of 1578, when Amsterdam came under Calvinist rule, the Begijnhof was the only Roman Catholic institution to be allowed to remain in existence. This was because the houses were the beguines' private property. The Chapel, however, was closed and lay empty for around 30 years before being ceded to the English Presbyterians, and since that time has been alluded to as the \"English Church\". Several of the pulpit panels were designed by Piet Mondrian.\n\nIn 1671, the architect Philip Vingboons converted two dwellings opposite the Chapel entrance into a \"schuilkerk\", or conventicle church, for Catholics, the \"Church of the Saints John and Ursula\", named after the patron saints of the Begijnhof. This church was kept secret, as was demanded by the city government, and could not be recognized as a church from the outside. In 1908 this became the Miracle Church, after the original Miracle Church had been deliberately destroyed by its Protestant owners.\n\nThe most famous beguine in the Begijnhof's history is sister Cornelia Arens, who died on 14 October 1654. (Her date of birth is unknown, but she professed the vows of chastity and the Catholic faith on 6 July 1621.) Rather than be laid to rest in the Chapel, which she considered \"desecrated\" by Presbyterians, she chose to be buried in the gutter of the court. Legend has it that contrary to her wish, she was in fact buried in the Chapel, but her coffin was found in the adjoining gutter the following day. This happened two more times, until she was at last laid to rest in the gutter. Another version of the legend is that her soul found no peace and roamed the court at night until she was buried in the gutter.\n\n\"Sister Antonia\", whose original name was Agatha Kaptein, was born on 13 April 1887 at Akersloot. The last beguine, she died on 23 May 1971 at the age of 84. She was buried in the Sisters' Grave in the St. Barbara's Roman Catholic Cemetery in Amsterdam on 26 May of the same year.\n\nUntil its renovation in 1979, the court had 140 dwellings — some 110 of them consisting of a single room, and about 25 comprising two. The occupants likewise numbered 140. The renovations enlarged the houses to two or three rooms. Since that time, the number of female inhabitants has been an unvaried 105.\n\n\n"}

The club offices of Mohun Bagan are adjacent to the stadium. This ground is mainly used by Mohun Bagan for Calcutta Football League matches against smaller and local Kolkata sides.\n\nThe first ground of the club was inside the famous marble palace, owned by Kirti Mitra of the Mitra family and known as Mohun Bagan Villa. It was situated in Fariapukur lane of north Kolkata. As a football ground however, this ground was not sufficiently large.\nIt is believed that Mohun Bagan played the first match on this very ground against the students of Eden Hindu hostel. In 1891, with the help of the Maharaja of Shyampukur, Durga Charan Laha, the club ground was relocated to his ground in Shyampukur. That place is now known as Shyampukur Laha Colony. Later, with the help of Mr. Harry Lee, the chairman of Kolkata Municipal Corporation, the ground was again shifted to Shyam Square. The ground was shared with the Aryan F.C. and Bagbazar Club.\n\nIn 1900, Mohun Bagan became the partner of Presidency College and shared the same ground in Kolkata maidan. Mohun Bagan continued to play here for 15 years. Then in 1915, Mohun Bagan got the ground of National AC. On this ground, Mohun Bagan played till 1963. In 1915, that ground was stretched east–west. But afterwards, it became north–south stretched like the other club grounds in Kolkata. Presently, that ground is occupied by one of the oldest clubs of Kolkata, Aryan F.C., who shares the ground with East Bengal.\n\nThe stadium has galleries on three sides and a rampart on the fourth side. The north side gallery is the member's gallery and is the most modern gallery of the stadium, having bucket seats installed. The east side and south side galleries are mainly made of steel & concrete structure and are designated for non-member supporters. The playing pitch is about 100m x 60m in dimension. Just adjacent the stadium, the club tent and main office are located. The club tent consists of a beautiful lawn, with benches known as the Mohun Bagan lawn.\n\nIn 1977 Mohun Bagan became the first club in maidan to have floodlights installed in their stadium. The floodlights operated till the mid-1990s, after which they became fully dysfunctional. The lights were later repaired and renovated and were inaugurated on 25 February 2016 with an IFA Shield match between Mohun Bagan U19s and DSK Liverpool academy.\n\nFor the 2015 ISL season, Kolkata-based franchisee Atlético de Kolkata used the ground as a training ground.\nFrom the 2016–17 season, Mohun Bagan has decided to pitch for hosting I-League matches at their home club ground, especially with modern facilities like bucket seats and properly functional floodlight towers.\n\nIn July 2019, the interiors of the stadium were renovated for making the stadium well equipped to host I-League matches. The dressing room in particular was given a major upgrade.\n\nThe Mohun Bagan Ground hosted a lot of historic matches. It was witness to the 2–2 draw of Mohun Bagan against FC Ararat Yerevan in the 1978 IFA Shield final. The first ever match under floodlight in maidan was held in this ground when Mohun Bagan faced Pakhtakor Tashkent FK in an exhibition game on 10 February 1977. In the 1960s and 1970s majority of the matches in Kolkata football were held in the Mohun Bagan Ground.\n"}

Written by Mark Peploe, Peter Wollen and Antonioni, the film is about an Anglo-American journalist, David Locke (Jack Nicholson) who assumes the identity of a dead businessman while working on a documentary in Chad, unaware that he is impersonating an arms dealer with connections to the rebels in the current civil war. Co-starring Maria Schneider, \"The Passenger\" was the final film in Antonioni's three-picture deal with producer Carlo Ponti and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, after \"Blowup\" and \"Zabriskie Point\", and competed for the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival.\n\nDavid Locke (Jack Nicholson) is a television journalist making a documentary film on post-colonial Africa. To finish the film, he is in the Sahara seeking to meet with and interview rebel fighters involved in the Chadian Civil War. Struggling to find rebels to interview, he is frustrated when his Land Rover gets stuck on a sand dune. After a long walk through the desert back to his hotel, a thoroughly dispirited Locke discovers that an Englishman, Robertson (Charles Mulvehill), who has also been staying there and with whom he had struck up a friendship, has died overnight at the hotel from a heart condition.\n\nLocke decides to switch identities with Robertson; he is tired of his work, his marriage and his life, and sees an opportunity for a fresh start. Posing as Robertson, Locke reports his own death at the front desk, where the hotel manager mistakes Locke for Robertson, and the plan goes off without a hitch.\n\nIn London, Locke's wife Rachel (Jenny Runacre) has been having an affair. She feels guilt-ridden and torn when she is informed of her husband's death. She approaches Locke's friend, Martin (Ian Hendry), a producer at the BBC, in an attempt to get in touch with Robertson to try and learn more about her husband's last days. Meanwhile, \"Robertson\" (Locke) has flown off to Europe with the dead man's belongings, including his appointment book.\n\nLocke soon learns that Robertson was gunrunning for the rebels whom, as a reporter, Locke had been trying to contact in the desert. When he goes to check out an airport locker listed in Robertson's diary, Locke is tracked down by the rebels' point man in Europe. He is there to complete the weapons sale. Since neither man has ever seen the other before, Locke's false identity is not revealed, and he hands the men the documents from Robertson's locker, and receives the first down payment for the set-up arms deal with Robertson before his death.\n\nLater, Locke accidentally spots his friend Martin on a street in Barcelona, as the latter tries to track Robertson down on behalf of Rachel. Locke backtracks and at this point bumps into an architecture student (Maria Schneider) while trying to hide nearby. He asks her to fetch his belongings from the hotel, so he won't be seen there by Martin who camped out to catch up with \"Robertson\". Martin overhears that she is collecting Locke's baggage, and requests she take him to meet \"Robertson\". She manages to evade him, and join Locke, who leaves Barcelona. They become lovers, and later, while trying to explain his rather odd behaviour, Locke confesses that he has stolen a dead man's identity.\n\nLocke is flush with cash from the down payment on the arms he cannot deliver, yet he is drawn to keep the meetings listed in Robertson's note book. In the meantime, Rachel has received his left-behind belongings, which were returned from Africa. Having heard from Martin of his unsuccessful chase of the elusive \"Robertson\", Rachel is shocked as she opens Locke's passport, seeing Robertson's photo pasted inside. Having realised why \"Robertson\" was so elusive, Rachel now heads off to Spain to track down Locke, who is fleeing from the Spanish police, brought in by Rachel to track Robertson. The student girl is, however, still loyal to Locke and helps him to evade them, providing rational advice, but Locke sends her away, intending to meet later in Tangiers.\n\nReaching the Gloria hotel in the Spanish town of Osuna, province of Seville, Locke finds out that the girl has already booked them a double room, but then again he persuades her that she had better leave. Taking her time, she wanders around the dusty square outside. Shortly afterwards the rebel agents in pursuit of Robertson arrive at the hotel. There Locke's assassination takes place, mostly off-screen during one long take, ending with a single gun shot. The rebels leave the scene minutes before the police arrive with Rachel, to find Locke motionless in bed. There his wife says to the police officers that she \"never knew\" the dead man, while the student girl identifies him as Robertson.\n\nIn a long take early in the film, Locke (Nicholson) is exchanging passport photos in his hotel room, with a tape recording playing an earlier conversation between Locke and Robertson, now dead. The camera pans, without a cut, to hold on Robertson's now live appearance on the balcony, when Locke appears beside him and the two of them continue talking, i.e. an in-camera in-single-shot flashback.\n\nThe film's penultimate shot is a seven-minute long take tracking shot which begins in Locke's hotel room, looking out onto a dusty, run-down square, pushes out through the bars of the hotel window into the square, rotates 180 degrees, and finally tracks back to a close exterior view of the room's interior.\n\nAlthough this is often referred to as the \"final shot\" of the film, there is one more. The last passage shows a small driving school car pulling away in the twilight, and the camera holds on the hotel as the film's credits begin to roll.\n\nSome years after the production ended, Nicholson had a dispute with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on an unrelated matter. The former had a deal with MGM in producing a film together, but when that project was not pursued, Nicholson demanded compensation; the result being the acquisition of this film. This explains why, out of the three arranged productions between Carlo Ponti and Michelangelo Antonioni for MGM beginning with \"Blowup\" (1966) and followed up by \"Zabriskie Point\" (1970); this was the only one not passed on to Warner Bros., successor-of-interest to the pre-1986 MGM catalogue via their acquisition of Turner Entertainment, who was the initial purchasor of said catalogue. For years Nicholson kept \"The Passenger\" out of circulation until Sony Pictures Classics courted him with an offer to restore the film.\n\n\"The Passenger\" has been widely praised for its camerawork (by Luciano Tovoli) and its acting. It competed for the Palme d'Or award at the 1975 Cannes Film Festival. The film was praised by such critics as Peter Travers of \"Rolling Stone\" and Manohla Dargis of \"The New York Times.\" Roger Ebert wrote that it was a perceptive look at identity, alienation and the human desire to escape oneself. It was placed 110th in the 2012 \"Sight & Sound\" critics' poll.\n\nAs of December 2019, the film holds a rating of 89% on Rotten Tomatoes from 70 reviews.\n\n\n"}

Its collections include nearly 35 million specimens and artifacts and cover 4.5 billion years of history. This large collection is comprised not only of specimens for exhibition, but also of vast research collections housed on and offsite. \n\nThe museum is actually associated with two other museums in Greater Los Angeles: the Page Museum at the La Brea Tar Pits in Hancock Park and the William S. Hart Ranch and Museum in Newhall. The three museums work together to achieve their common mission: \"to inspire wonder, discovery, and responsibility for our natural and cultural worlds.\"\n\nNHM opened in Exposition Park, Los Angeles, California, United States in 1913 as The Museum of History, Science, and Art. The moving force behind it was a museum association founded in 1910. Its distinctive main building with fitted marble walls and domed and colonnaded rotunda, is on The National Register of Historic Places. Additional wings opened in 1925, 1930, 1960, and 1976.\n\nThe museum was divided in 1961 into The Los Angeles County Museum of History and Science and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA). LACMA moved to new quarters on Wilshire Boulevard in 1965, and the Museum of History and Science was renamed The Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History. Eventually, the museum renamed itself again, becoming The Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County.\n\nIn 2003, the museum began a campaign to transform its exhibits and visitor experience. The museum reopened its seismically retrofitted renovated 1913 rotunda, along with the new \"Age of Mammals\" exhibition. in 2010. Its Dinosaur Hall opened in July 2011. A new Los Angeles history exhibition, \"Becoming Los Angeles,\" opened in 2013. The outdoor Nature Gardens and Nature Lab, which explore L.A. wildlife, also opened in 2013.\n\nThe museum maintains research and collections in the following fields:\n\n\nThe museum has three floors of permanent exhibits. Among the most popular museum displays are those devoted to animal habitats, dinosaurs, pre-Columbian cultures, The Ralph M. Parsons Discovery Center and Insect Zoo, and the new Nature Lab, which explores urban wildlife in Southern California.\n\nThe museum's collections are strong in many fields, but the mineralogy and Pleistocene paleontology are the most esteemed, the latter thanks to the wealth of specimens collected from The La Brea Tar Pits. \n\nThe museum has almost 30 million specimens representing marine zoology. These include one of the largest collections of marine mammal remains in the world, housed in a warehouse off site, which at over 5,000 specimens is second in size only to that of The Smithsonian.\n\nThe museum's collection of historical documents is held in The Seaver Center for Western History Research.\n\nThe museum hosts regular special exhibitions which augment its collections and advance its mission. Recent special exhibits have included Mummies and Pterosaurs.\n\nThe museum also hosts a butterfly pavilion outside every spring and summer and a spider pavilion on the same site in the fall.\n\nOver the years, the museum has built additions onto its original building. Originally dedicated when The Natural History Museum opened its doors in 1913, the rotunda is one of the museum's most elegant and popular spaces. Lined with marble columns and crowned by a stained glass dome, the room is also the home of the very first piece of public art funded by Los Angeles County, a Beaux Arts statue by Julia Bracken Wendt entitled \"Three Muses\", or \"History, Science and Art\". This hall is among the most distinctive locales in Los Angeles and has often been used as a filming location.\n\n"}

{"id": "2171870", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2171870", "title": "FISA–FOCA war", "text": "FISA–FOCA war\n\nThe FISA–FOCA war was a political battle contested throughout the early 1980s by the two representative organizations in Formula One motor racing, the Fédération Internationale du Sport Automobile (FISA) and the Formula One Constructors Association (FOCA). The battle boiled during the late 1970s and early 1980s and came to a head when the racing teams affiliated with FOCA, an equivalent to a racing team union, boycotted the 1982 San Marino Grand Prix.\n\nThe battle for control of Formula One was contested between the Fédération Internationale du Sport Automobile (FISA), at the time an autonomous subcommittee of the FIA, and the Formula One Constructors' Association (FOCA).\n\nThe principals in the matter were Jean-Marie Balestre, then FISA president, Bernie Ecclestone, then the leader of FOCA and owner of the Brabham Formula One team, and Max Mosley, later president of the FIA, but then legal advisor to both Ecclestone's Brabham team and FOCA in general.\n\nThe beginnings of the dispute are numerous, and many of the underlying reasons may be lost in history. The teams (excepting Ferrari and the other major manufacturers – Renault and Alfa Romeo in particular) were of the opinion that their rights and ability to compete against the larger and better funded teams were being negatively affected by a perceived bias on the part of FISA, the controlling organisation, toward the major manufacturers.\n\nIn addition, the battle revolved around the commercial aspects of the sport (the FOCA teams were unhappy with the disbursement of proceeds from the races) and the technical regulations which, in FOCA's opinion, tended to be malleable according to the nature of the transgressor more than the nature of the transgression.\n\nThe battles raged throughout the late 1970s and early 1980s, the first major confrontation being at the 1980 Spanish Grand Prix. In the buildup to the race, FISA fined the majority of the FOCA team drivers who had not appeared at the drivers' briefings at the Belgian and Monaco races and unless the fines were paid, the drivers at fault would have their racing licences revoked by the governing body. After a lengthy debate between the teams, the drivers, FOCA and FISA, the race went ahead at the insistence of King Juan Carlos without FISA's sanctioning or the support of the factory teams. The race, won by eventual World Champion Alan Jones in a Williams-Ford, was therefore run as a non-championship event.\n\nA notable point of the dispute was the formation of a short lived \"World Federation of Motorsport\" in November 1980 to stage a rival championship. The FOCA teams staged a Formula One race under the WFMS banner in South Africa in February , won by Carlos Reutemann in a Williams-Ford. However, the lack of major factory team attendance, the resulting poor fan support and limited media coverage meant that the viability of the rival series was compromised immediately. A grudging settlement was reached thereafter which allowed the FOCA teams to return to the \"FISA\" world championship in time for the first race in March.\n\nThings came to a head just before the beginning of the 1982 season. FISA had introduced a clause into the drivers' super licences, stipulating that they must drive for the team they were currently contracted to and no others. The Grand Prix Drivers' Association led by Didier Pironi and Niki Lauda organised a 'drivers' strike' at the 1982 South African Grand Prix in protest, with the majority of the drivers in support (Italian driver Teo Fabi was the only one not to participate in the strike). After lengthy debates and negotiation between the GPDA, FISA and FOCA the dispute was settled in favour of the drivers, and the clause was dropped.\n\nThe war culminated in a FOCA boycott of the 1982 San Marino Grand Prix three months later. In theory, all the FOCA-aligned teams were supposed to boycott the Grand Prix as a sign of solidarity and complaint at the handling of the regulations and financial compensation. In practice, four of the teams – Tyrrell, Osella, ATS and Toleman – backed out of the boycott, citing \"sponsor obligations\". Nonetheless, there were only 14 cars in the race – the six cars from the FISA-aligned Ferrari, Renault and Alfa Romeo teams, and the eight cars from the four FOCA teams that had broken the boycott. The hard feelings and repercussions of the four FOCA teams' participation in the race would continue into the mid-1980s.\n\nThe FOCA team bosses claimed that their boycott of the 1982 San Marino Grand Prix was in response to the disqualification of Nelson Piquet's Brabham and Keke Rosberg's Williams from the 1982 Brazilian Grand Prix.\n\nThis disqualification was a response to the FOCA teams' attempts to overcome their cars' power deficit to the other (mainly manufacturer backed or owned) teams' turbocharged engines. Renault had introduced turbocharged engines to Formula One in . Initially the turbocharged cars had been heavy, unreliable, and difficult to drive, meaning the Ford-Cosworth DFVs used by the majority of the Formula One teams (with Ferrari's Flat 12 engine the notable exception) were still dominant. However, by turbo engines were becoming faster, more reliable and easier to drive. By this time, Ferrari and later Alfa Romeo () joined Renault in the turbo camp, while even Bernie Ecclestone's Brabham team began using turbocharged BMW engines in 1982. The FOCA teams stuck with the DFV, but even the latest versions of the engine (which had been introduced in ) showed their age and were significantly down on power relative to the newest turbo engines. In order to keep pace with the turbo cars, FOCA team bosses began to look for loopholes in the regulations.\n\nBefore the Brazilian race, the FOCA teams found a loophole in the weighing procedure used at the races. The rules stated a car would be weighed with all coolants and lubricants on board, and said nothing about whether those coolants and lubricants needed to be in the car when the race finished. The FOCA teams claimed this meant that all coolants and lubricants could be 'topped up' after the race. This practice was illegal in all other forms of FIA racing, but was not explicitly banned in Formula One.\n\nWith this in mind, the FOCA teams showed up at the 1982 Brazilian Grand Prix with \"water-cooled brakes\". The cars were also fitted with large water tanks, which the teams claimed were to hold the water needed to cool the brakes. In reality, the water in the tanks wasn't used for cooling the brakes at all, but was instead sprayed out of the car in the early laps of the race. This resulted in the cars running most of the race significantly under the mandated minimum weight limit. However, after the race (or on occasion during a late race pit stop) the teams refilled the tanks before the cars were weighed. Since the cars were supposed to be weighed with all coolants and lubricants on board, and the water was supposed to be a coolant, this was not a violation of the letter of the rules of Formula One.\n\nIn the Brazilian Grand Prix of 1982, the Brabham-Ford/Cosworth of Nelson Piquet and the Williams-Ford/Cosworth of Keke Rosberg finished first and second respectively, with the turbocharged Renault of Alain Prost finishing third (without the water-cooled brakes). Renault immediately protested the top two cars, and Piquet and Rosberg were disqualified for finishing the race underweight. The FISA teams accused the FOCA teams of intentionally mis-interpreting the rule in question, while the FOCA teams claimed since 'topping up' the tanks wasn't specifically illegal, it had to be legal. Brabham and Williams appealed the disqualification of their cars.\n\nAs per normal procedure, there was a delay before the FIA Court of Appeals heard the appeal on the disqualifications. This meant another Grand Prix (the United States Grand Prix West) was run before the appeals were heard, and Ferrari (who was aligned with FISA) took the opportunity to show where things would lead if teams were allowed to exploit loopholes in the regulations. Both Ferrari 126C2s showed up at the race with two rear wings. The wings were located side-by-side, with one slightly in front of the other. Both wings were the legal size, but the effect was the same as running one rear wing that was double the legal width. Ferrari claimed this setup was legal, as there was no rule stating teams could only run one rear wing, so running multiple rear wings had to be legal. The FIA disagreed, and disqualified Gilles Villeneuve after he finished 3rd in a Ferrari.\n\nWhether this episode influenced the FIA Court of Appeals or not is unknown, but either way the appeals from Williams and Brabham were rejected, and the disqualifications stood. Ironically, the rest of the FOCA teams' cars in the Brazilian Grand Prix (some of which had scored points) were not disqualified despite the fact they ran the same water-cooled brakes system. The reason was simple: Renault had only protested the cars which had finished \"in front\" of their driver (Prost). None of the other cars using the system had been protested, meaning they were allowed to keep their points.\n\nDuring this period, the Formula One rules specified that any car must weigh at least 585 kg to be deemed in compliance with the rules. The method of testing was somewhat haphazard – teams would be notified that they would be \"weight checked\" when they exited the pits during practice or qualifying. This gave the teams ample opportunity to add weight to their cars while in the pits so as to pass the test. Former Formula One driver Eddie Cheever claimed that during 1981, when his Tyrrell was tagged for a weight check in qualifying, the team took off the \"racing\" rear wing (a fiberglass/metal hybrid) and replaced it with a \"weight check\" rear wing before allowing him to proceed to the scale. Cheever said it took four of them to lift the \"weight check\" rear wing and the car was largely undriveable with it installed. He believed that the weight check rear wing was made mostly of lead.\n\nSimilarly, after the limiting of ground effect technology in Formula One at the end of 1980 the Brabham team devised a system to circumvent the minimum ride height regulation of 6 centimetres. The FISA had implemented this rule in order to make it relatively easy to eliminate ground effect skirts and underwings, both of which required that the bodywork of the car be very close to the racing surface at all times. The Brabham team at the time was headed by Ecclestone, with legal representation by Max Mosley, and its chief mechanic was Charlie Whiting – all of whom became FIA Senior staffers. The team's designer Gordon Murray produced a hydropneumatic suspension system for the Brabham BT49C, in which compressed air acted as the spring. The air springs supported the car at the regulation height for checks while stationary in parc fermé. At speed, where the ride height could not be measured, downforce compressed the suspension and the car settled to a much lower ride height, creating more downforce. It returned to its original height when the car slowed down to enter the pits. Murray believes the system to have been legal on the basis that all suspension systems compress under download. The loophole was in the degree of compression permitted, which was not specified under the rules.\n\nWhile it is not clear that these issues were ever properly resolved, the FISA–FOCA war was ultimately put into more or less permanent abeyance by the Concorde Agreement to which both parties agreed at the beginning of 1981. The regulatory body (FISA, which was an autonomous satellite body created by the FIA to oversee international motorsport) agreed to a more equal distribution of funds, to arbitration provisions, and to a timetable for technical regulation changes, amongst other things.\nThe teams agreed to appear for every race in the world championship (which had not been the case previously, as to save money, often teams did not enter \"fly away\" races, \"i.e.\" South American, Antipodean, or North American events) under financial penalty. Furthermore, they agreed to abide by the rulings of the arbitration provisions of the agreement. The FOCA teams also agreed to share travel expenses equally amongst all teams who score world championship points in a given season.\nThe initial Concorde Agreement went into effect in 1981 and lasted until 1987. While the Concorde Agreement has been both extended and substantially modified since then, the ten teams contesting the Formula One World Championship in are still covered under its provisions.\n\nThe fallout from the FISA–FOCA war is significant and worthy of mention.\n\nFirstly, the Concorde Agreement hastened the commercial development of the sport. The fact that promoters could guarantee that \"all 26\" cars (as was the custom) would appear at every race led to increased sponsorships and commercial opportunities. This, in turn, led to a significant increase in financial remuneration to each of the teams (including the non-FOCA teams – the manufacturers).\n\nSecondly, those teams who had backed out of the 1982 San Marino boycott were harshly dealt with. The Tyrrell team was the last team to obtain a turbocharged engine contract (essential in order to be competitive in Formula One from 1983 onward), finally signing a deal to run \"customer\" Renault turbos in the latter part of 1985 (roughly three years before turbo engines were ultimately banned). Toleman was effectively squeezed out of the Formula One world championship in 1985 when their tyre supplier pulled out of Formula One. In both cases, it must be said, the teams had previously blotted their copybook with inappropriate acts. In Tyrrell's case, they had backed out of a 1974 contract to run Renault turbo engines, leading directly to the carmaker's entry into Formula One as a factory team in 1977. While in Toleman's case, they broke a Pirelli tyre contract in favour of Michelin tyres in 1984, only to be left without a contract when Michelin withdrew at the end of 1984. Pirelli, understandably, felt they could not reasonably supply the team in 1985. Goodyear, the other supplier, refused to do so on grounds of capacity. This was resolved before the Monaco Grand Prix in 1985, when Toleman bought the Pirelli contract from the recently closed Spirit team, after signing a long-term sponsorship with Luciano Benetton.\n\nFinally, the \"entente cordiale\" between FISA and FOCA led more or less to the inclusion of some of FOCA's principals within the FIA, namely Bernie Ecclestone and Max Mosley. The commercial aspects of Formula One have grown immensely since their involvement in the late 1980s, although the neutrality of the governing bodies and their judgements is still debated by the press and followers of the sport.\n\n\n\n"}

The name comes from a member of the prominent Basque–Spanish Berreyesa family: Nicolas Berreyesa, a Californio settler who was granted Rancho Milpitas in 1834. \n\nThe name North Valley is sometimes used by locals to refer to Berryessa. Informal use of the term sometimes also includes parts of Milpitas and Alviso to mean the northern portion of the Santa Clara Valley.\n\nIn the late 19th century, Berryessa was a small farming community well known across California for its high-quality fruit. Hostetter Road, Capitol Avenue, Piedmont Road, and Lundy Avenue were formerly surrounded by apricot and prune orchards, whereas today this area is distinguished as a fast-growing bedroom community of San Jose, served by VTA light rail and (in 2019), an extension of the Bay Area's BART system.\n\nThe district borders Milpitas along Landess Avenue to the north and the Alum Rock neighborhood of East San Jose along Mabury Road to the south. The residential neighborhood is part of the Fourth City Council District, along with Alviso, and was represented by Chuck Reed prior to his election as Mayor of San Jose. The district representative is now Lan Diep.\n\nThe J. F. Flickinger Fruit Packing Company, one of the largest fruit packing companies in the Santa Clara Valley, was located around present-day Hostetter Road. In the 1960s and 1970s, however, the orchards were developed into suburban residential neighborhoods and businesses. Tiny remnants of these lands remain today, including the Orlando Farm till 2013 when it too was developed into housing on Capitol Avenue and the Mattos' apricot orchard off Piedmont Road.\n\nBerryessa Union School District operates public schools. Schools in Berryessa include:\n\nSaint Victor Catholic School and Milpitas Christian School (founded in Milpitas but now located in Berryessa) are the only private schools in the area.\n\nSan José Public Library operates the Berryessa Branch Library and the Educational Park Branch Library.\n\nThe annual Berryessa Art & Wine festival is one of the most well known local events in the area and has been a yearly tradition for over 30 years. The current festival, typically held in May, includes 120-150 artist booths, 14 food booths (all run by non-profit groups from the Berryessa area), a Community Row area with booths from a variety of service groups and non-profits offering information to the festival goers, a Business Row with representatives from the Berryessa community and other local San Jose Businesses, a stage area with entertainment by local amateur entertainers as well as professional entertainment and booths from several local radio stations.

It was first used in 1944 at Antwerp during the Battle of the Scheldt.\n\nTerrapins served with the Royal Engineer assault teams of the 79th Armoured Division and were used to carry infantry units (Canadian and British) over rivers.\n\nDue to a shortage of US-manufactured DUKWs, the British Ministry of Supply commissioned Thornycroft to design an amphibious vehicle capable of ferrying supplies and troops from ship to shore for the D-Day landings.\n\nSome 500 Terrapin Mark 1 were built by Morris Commercial, the commercial vehicle side of Morris Motors Limited.\n\nA Mark 2 Terrapin with a number of improvements reached the prototype stage, but the war ended before it entered production.\n\nThe Terrapin was powered by two Ford V8 engines mounted side-by-side, with each motor driving the wheels on one side. Wheel braking was used to steer, the brakes being operated by levers.\n\nOn a level surface, the vehicle was supported on the four middle wheels, the front and rear wheels remaining clear of the surface (the front pair being raised significantly, the rear pair only slightly). The front and rear wheels provided support and traction on soft surfaces and when climbing slopes, such as riverbanks. When driven in the water, it was propelled by two rear-mounted propellers.\n\nDespite success in its first military action, the Terrapin was not overall a successful design and had many significant defects, which were never overcome in service.\n\nDue to the large diameter tyres, the Terrapin was a relatively high vehicle and, although open-topped, it was difficult to enter and exit. Any soldier attempting to exit over the side faced both prolonged exposure to enemy fire and possible injury from the fall.\nLike the Medium Mark A Whippet tank of the First World War, the Terrapin had separate engines driving each side of the vehicle with skid steering. This arrangement was awkward on the Whippet, and on the Terrapin as well. If one engine broke down, the Terrapin tended to swing around violently.\n\nThe two centrally located engines split the cargo compartment in two and, though rated as a 4-ton vehicle, this prevented large loads, such as heavy artillery or vehicles, from being carried. In addition, the driver had poor visibility as he was centrally located inside the middle of the vehicle. This was compounded by the installation of a canvas cover over the forward hold. As a result, another crew member typically had to stand behind the driver and provide directions.\n\nIn use, the vehicle was found to be rather slow, and was easily swamped in rough seas. The specification had limited the length to and this made its seagoing characteristics inferior to the American DUKW.\n\nThese failings quickly led to the abandonment of the design in favour of the development of the Mark 2, but the growing availability of large numbers of the much more successful DUKW made further development unnecessary.\n\nThis was similar to the Mark 1, but had a forward driving position. It was a much longer vehicle, being long compared with the length of the Mark I.\n\nOnly five of these 5-ton capacity vehicles were built.\n\nDuring the operations against Walcheren, Terrapins and Buffalo transports carried the 9th Canadian Infantry Brigade in what was intended to be a diversionary attack across a mile wide inlet on 9 October 1944. A sufficiently large bridgehead was made that the attack became the main attempt and the German defences were turned.\n\nTerrapins were used in Operation Vitality II on 26 October to carry units from the British 52nd (Lowland) Division across the Scheldt; Amphibious Sherman DD tanks led the attack.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2171888", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2171888", "title": "Lake Berryessa", "text": "Lake Berryessa\n\nLake Berryessa is the largest lake in Napa County, California. This reservoir in the Vaca Mountains was formed following the construction of the Monticello Dam on Putah Creek in the 1950s. Since the early 1960s, this reservoir has provided water and hydroelectricity to the North Bay region of the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\nThe reservoir was named after the first European settlers in the Berryessa Valley, José Jesús and Sexto \"Sisto\" Berrelleza (a Basque surname, Anglicized to \"Berreyesa\", then later respelled \"Berryessa\"), who were granted Rancho Las Putas in 1843.\n\nThe lake is over 20,000 acres (80 km²) when full. It is approximately 25 km (15.5 miles) long and 5 km (3 miles) wide. It has approximately 265 km (165 miles) of shoreline.\n\nNear the dam on the southeast side of the reservoir is an open bell-mouth spillway, in diameter, which is known as the Glory Hole. The pipe has a straight drop of , and the diameter shrinks down to about . The spillway has a maximum capacity of 48,000 cfs (1360 m³/s). The spillway operates when there is excess water in the reservoir; in 2017 after heavy rains it started flowing, for the first time since 2006. It started flowing again in 2019 after heavy rains. In 1997 a woman was killed after being pulled inside the spillway.\n\nThe active Green Valley Fault runs parallel to the Lake in the hills to the west.\n\nPrior to its inundation, the valley was an agricultural region, whose soils were considered among the finest in the country. The main town in the valley, Monticello, was abandoned in order to construct the reservoir. This abandonment was chronicled by the photographers Dorothea Lange and Pirkle Jones in their book \"Death of a Valley\". Construction of Monticello Dam began in 1953, completed in 1958, and the reservoir filled by 1963, creating what at the time was the second-largest reservoir in California after Shasta Lake. The Monticello Dam with Lake Berryessa, Putah Diversion Dam with Lake Solano, and associated water distribution systems and lands are known collectively as the Solano Project, which is distinct from other water projects in California such as the Central Valley Project.\n\nMonticello residents opposed the government and the Solano Project but were unsuccessful. Residents abandoned their homes, the Monticello cemetery had to be relocated, and houses were destroyed. Monticello ranchers were evicted as equipment was auctioned away and the fertile land destroyed and flooded.\n\nThe discovery of gold in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada caused an influx of people to the central valley. Communities in Solano County grew quickly in the gold rush. More water was needed to accommodate the rising population, so around the 1940s the Solano County Board of Supervisors organized the Solano County Water Council to search for the best place to develop a water project. Monticello Dam and Lake Berryessa were the result.\n\nInterest in damming Putah Creek started around the early 1900s. In 1907, a few cities in the Bay Area were interested enough to hire three engineers, including Arthur Powell Davis and George Washington Goethals. Their interest quickly evaporated in favor of larger projects, but the place continued to attract interest. Small irrigation projects had developed in the surrounding areas but had little success. In the end the Solano Water Council agreed to focus on Monticello Dam. The original plan included alterations to both Putah Creek and Cache Creeks but complications led to a simpler plan which only dammed Putah Creek at Devil’s Gate, which the Bureau of Reclamation assured engineers and planners was the most feasible spot to place a dam on Putah Creek.\n\nSome predicted the dam would be unsuccessful and the valley would never fill.\n\nMonticello, a small farming town was founded by Ezra Peacock in 1867. By the time of the evacuations for the dam it had a population of about 250 with some scattered on the outskirts in the valley. Putah Creek was the town’s life source, it provided them with close access to water for both crop and livestock raising. \n\nA few years after the completion of the dam, Governor Edmund G. Brown proposed a new project to build an even bigger dam and a larger lake. The \"Greater Berryessa Project\" was envisioned to be a much larger project; the 304-foot dam would be replaced with a 600-foot dam that would be capable of holding ten times the amount of water, expanding the lake to three times the current size, flooding productive farmland. The project's primary purpose was storage of northern water for use in parts of southern California.\n\nThe lake is fed by the headwaters to the 576-square-mile (1,490 km²) Putah Creek watershed. It has a storage capacity of , making it one of the larger reservoirs in California. Besides Putah Creek there are three other major tributaries that contribute to the lake: Capell Creek, Pope Creek, and Eticuera Creek. Since all of these creeks do not come from the same area, the lake level rise is hard to predict. Each creek has a different flow rate and that rate is based on the precipitation level where the creek comes from. These smaller tributaries mostly contribute in the winter or wet season only and usually dry out in the summer months. Though Putah Creek is not the only creek that is directly impacted by the project, it is the only creek that is dammed.\n\nThe Solano Projects are much more than just Monticello Dam and Lake Berryessa, including Putah Diversion Dam, Lake Solano, and the Putah South Canal. Lake Berryessa is the largest body of water formed from the Solano Projects and so is the most well-known. Lake Berryessa does help to manage for flooding in the Yolo county. It is estimated that for the first forty years, over five million dollars were saved from avoided flood damage. A study in 1986 shows that it is highly unlikely that Lake Berryessa will overflow. There are few times has it actually gone over 440 ft, as it did on February 17, 2017. In the study, the probability of the lake level reaching 450 ft. was estimated at about one percent; likely only to happen once in a hundred years. The highest water level ever recorded at Lake Berryessa was 446.7 ft. Raising Monticello dam is highly unlikely but one possible way to increase water storage at the lake is to raise the height of Glory Hole.\n\nLake Berryessa supplies water to Vacaville, Suisun City, Vallejo, and Fairfield as well as Travis Air Force Base located south of Lake Berryessa has its water supplied by Berryessa. The Solano County Water Agency (SCWA) and its partners work closely together to manage the water levels at Lake Berryessa. A \"Drought Contingency\" Plan is in place for if the lake level dwindles down below 800,000 acre-feet then SCWA and acting partners will work find supplies for the lake’s recipients and try to conserve the lake’s water as long as possible.\n\nThough the lake and Monticello Dam are in Napa County, the water yield of up to about 245,000 acre-feet per year from the Solano Project is largely contracted to Solano County Water Agency and managed under subcontract by Solano Irrigation District for use in Solano County. The water is used for agricultural, municipal, and industrial purposes under a contract for use of water rights held by the federal Bureau of Reclamation. Another contract allows for use of up to 1,500 acre-feet of water per year around Lake Berryessa in Napa County. The 25-year contracts were renewed in 2009. The Monticello Dam Powerplant built in 1983 generates up to 12 MW of hydroelectric power. A settlement of water right claims to Putah Creek was made in 2000. Known as the Putah Creek Accord, it allowed for scheduled instream flows in lower Putah Creek flowing to the Yolo Bypass. Water rights for the watershed above Monticello Dam were amended in 1996.\n\nLake Berryessa is a monomictic lake, which means that the waters of the lake turnover once a year. For monomictic lakes that turnover time is somewhere in the Fall. Lake turnover happens when the warmer surface water starts to cool to match the lower cooler water. Once the lake is all the same temperature, water can freely circulate all around and oxygen replenishes parts of the water where it has been diminished. Fishing during the turnover time or after can be difficult because the monotone temperature and oxygen level of the lake allows for the fish to go anywhere in the lake.\n\nLake Berryessa is critical for recharging the groundwater in the surrounding areas. Without the dam, Putah Creek can dry out in summer.\n\nThe creation of Monticello Dam and Lake Berryessa were not intended for public and recreational use. The lake was initially fenced off but interest from the public overcame and many people still managed to access the water in the first two years. With no federal or state agencies wanting to manage affairs at the lake, agencies authorized seven concessionaires to provide recreational activities at the lake to the public on federal land in the late 1950s. Those 50 year contracts for the concessionaires have come to an end in 2009. During the time of the concessionaires, they leased some land to RV homes for long term housing. When the contracts ended, all the recreational facilities and mobile homes were forced to move from federal property. The new reclamation has yet to seriously start any new development on recreational activities at the lake though a new multi-purpose trail is to be in the future. Post-contract, recreation levels and activities at Lake Berryessa have perished from the concessionaire days. Estimates from the bureau estimated that visitations at Lake Berryessa dropped to less than half since the termination of all seven resorts. The Bureau of Reclamation held an open bid period in 2015 to businesses for developmental opportunities at Lake Berryessa. As of early 2016 there were no successful bids for any of the concession areas at Lake Berryessa.\n\nThe management of Zebra and Quagga mussels for Lake Berryessa is managed by the SCWA and its interns. The program that has been going on for over 15 years informs, educates, and manages boaters for potential mussels. Any boater that has visited a lake known to have either mussel must wait a full thirty day from the day of inspection before entering the water. Unfortunately, insufficient funds and resources make it difficult to inspect boaters year round so the program runs for about half to a third of the calendar year only.\n\nIn 2007, the SCWA conducted a study on the bottom floors of the lake to determine if the lake has lost some of its capacity due to soil sedimentation as well as map the floor to the most accurate as possible with the newest technologies they had available. The study found that Lake Berryessa did not lose any storage capacity.\n\nThe National Weather Service has maintained a cooperative weather station at the lake since November 1, 1957. Records show that the area has hot, mostly dry summers and cool, wet winters. Normal January temperatures are a maximum of and a minimum of . Normal July temperatures are a maximum of and a minimum of . There is an average of 80.1 days with highs of or higher and an average of 28.0 days with lows of or lower.\n\nThe record high temperature was on July 24, 2006. The record low temperature was on December 22, 1990.\n\nThe wettest year was 1983 with and the driest year was 1976 with . The most precipitation in one month was in January 1995. The most precipitation in 24 hours was on December 31, 2005. Snowfall is very rare, but fell in January 1974.\n\nIn the late afternoon of April 27, 2016, a funnel cloud appeared at Lake Berryessa.\n\nThe 2015-2016 \"El Nino\" did not dramatically raise the lake's water level at Berryessa. The total rainfall at the end of March 2016 was just a few inches from the average and the lake was actually just shy of its capacity the year prior.\n\nPopular activities include fishing, waterskiing, jet skiing, pleasure boating, kayaking and canoeing, hiking, road bicycling, motorcycle pleasure biking, birding, wildlife observation, picnicking, and swimming. The Lake Berryessa Seaplane Base is located on the lake's surface, and an estimated 200 seaplane operations were reported between September 2011 and September 2012. It is used for seaplane landings and splash-ins.\n\nLake Berryessa is a swimming and water skiing site for enthusiasts. The narrow portion of the reservoir, nearest to the Monticello Dam, is referred to as the \"Narrows,\" and is sometimes busy with boaters on holidays and weekends.\n\nThere are several resorts with marinas at the lake, as well as nearby Lake Solano County Park located west of Winters, California. Day use areas include Oak Shores and Smittle Creek. There are swimming areas closed to boats and other watercraft, as well as several hiking trails.\n\nLakeshore lands, facilities, and concessions in Napa County are managed by the Bureau of Reclamation. However, five of the seven resort concessions that expired in 2009 have not yet become fully operational. Based on rules against exclusive occupancy of federal recreation lands, about 1,300 long-term resident trailers were removed from the resorts when the 50-year concession contracts expired. In the following years, public usage of the lake dwindled due to government delays in formulating a future plan.\n\nThere is a seaplane landing area that is open to the public. One of the larger islands contained a small plane landing area but it was closed in the early 1970s in response to a safety report issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).\n\nFishing at Lake Berryessa can be successful year-round as the lake is home to both warm-water and cold-water fish species. Lake Berryessa offers a variety of fish from sunfish to landlocked salmon. Because fish species are plentiful, fishing can be done in a variety of ways; from finesse techniques, bait fishing, and to trolling in the deep. Fish species at Lake Berryessa include; largemouth bass (\"Micropterus salmoides\"), smallmouth bass (\"Micropterus dolomeiu\"), spotted bass, channel catfish (\"Ictalurus punctatus\"), bullhead catfish (\"Ictalurus dolomeiu\"), white catfish (\"Ameiurus catus\"), carp (\"Cyprinus carpio\"), Sacramento pikeminnow (\"Ptychocheilus grandis\"), crappie, bluegill (\"Lepomis macrochirus\"), rainbow trout (\"Onchorhynchus mykiss\"), brown and brook trout, Kokanee, and also Chinook salmon (\"Onchorhynchus tschawytscha\"). The rainbow trout species is native to the region while many other species were introduced. Largemouth bass and smallmouth bass were both introduced into the lake in the late 1950s and spotted bass followed in the 1980s. Bass and salmon are mostly noted as sport fishing species, bluegill, black and white crappie, and catfish are more of a recreational and beginners type of fish and carp and pikeminnow are usually not favored among anglers. The introduced species of carp, is also present and feeds on organic matter, water snails, bloodworm, fresh water mussels as well as their own eggs. Besides the Sacramento pikeminnow, Lake Berryessa also has the golden shiner and threadfin shad which are usually baitfish to the other species of fish. Aside from the fish Lake Berryessa also supports other aquatic organisms such as crawfish, clams, and otters. The California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) has issued a safe eating advisory for any fish caught in Lake Berryessa due to elevated levels of mercury. A copy of these guidelines can also be found at Lake Berryessa’s Visitor Center. Mercury levels at Lake Berryessa are on the rise and there are no fish that OEHHA recommend to eat more than three times a week. In context of mercury, trouts are the best option for Berryessa at this time. Fishing regulations accord with standard California Department of Fish and Wildlife regulations. There are tournaments scheduled throughout nine of the twelve months out of the year for bass.\n\nHunting on Lake Berryessa is not permitted in lands that are managed by the Bureau of Reclamation. Firearms are, however, allowed on these lands under specific criteria; possession of a Carry Conceal Weapon (CCW) certificate or, if the firearm is disassembled, disarmed and you have a valid California Hunting License and a Permit to Transport Firearm. The Permit to Transport Firearm does not allow for possession of firearm while recreating in Bureau of Recreation lands. Hunting can be possible on lands managed by other agencies next to Reclamation lands such as Knoxville Wildlife Area, Knoxville Recreation, and Cedar Roughs Wildlife area. These areas are under the jurisdiction of California Department of Fish and Wildlife and/or the Bureau of Land Management. Hikers are also present in these areas and the perimeter is fairly small so caution and safety should always be the main priority.\n\nAdjoining the Lake Berryessa Recreational Area is the recently designated Cedar Roughs Wilderness Area. The Northern California Coastal Wild Heritage Wilderness Act of 2006 set aside the former study area of located past Pope Creek bridge on the Pope Creek arm of Lake Berryessa. The wilderness area can be accessed by car or boat, although there are no maintained trails (as yet). Hiking can be difficult as more than half of the wilderness area consists of Sargent's cypress, which covers and is relatively pure genetically. It is the second most widely distributed cypress in California, and was named for Charles Sprague Sargent (1841–1927), the founder and director of Harvard University's Arnold Arboretum and author of the 14-volume \"Silva of North America\". The area is jointly managed by the Bureau of Land Management and California Department of Fish and Game.\n\nNotable plants in the area include sergeant cypress, white alder, leather oak, Jepson's navarretia, and Bridge's brodiaea.\n\nThe east side of the lake has a Wildlife Management Area managed by the California Department of Fish and Game that protects wildlife habitats for such species as mountain lion, black-tailed deer, western rattlesnake, raccoon, skunk, osprey, turkey, rabbit and golden eagle.\n\nIn 1969, the lake became the site of one of the infamous Zodiac murders. On the evening of September 27, Pacific Union College students Bryan Hartnell and Cecelia Shepard were picnicking at Lake Berryessa on a small island connected by a sand spit to Twin Oak Ridge. A man approached them wearing a black executioner's-type hood with clip-on sunglasses over the eye-holes and a bib-like device on his chest that had a white 3-by-3-inch (76 mm × 76 mm) cross-circle symbol on it. He approached them with a gun, which Hartnell believed to be a .45. The hooded man claimed to be an escaped convict from Deer Lodge, Montana, where he had killed a guard and stolen a car, explaining that he needed their car and money to go to Mexico. He had brought precut lengths of plastic clothesline and told Shepard to tie up Hartnell, before he tied her up. The killer checked and tightened Hartnell's bonds, after discovering Shepard had bound Hartnell's hands loosely. Hartnell initially believed it to be a weird robbery, but the man drew a knife and stabbed them both repeatedly. The killer then hiked 500 yards (460 m) back up to Knoxville Road, drew a cross-circle symbol on Hartnell's car door with a black felt-tip pen, and wrote beneath it: \"Vallejo/12-20-68/7-4-69/Sept 27–69–6:30/by knife\", the dates of the killer's first two crimes and the date and time of the crime he had just committed.\n\nAt 7:40 p.m. (19:40), the killer called the Napa County Sheriff's office from a pay telephone to report this latest crime. The phone was found, still off the hook, minutes later at the Napa Car Wash on Main Street in Napa, only a few blocks from the sheriff's office, yet 27 miles (43 km) from the crime scene. Detectives were able to lift a still-wet palm print from the telephone but were never able to match it to any suspect.\n\nAfter hearing their screams for help, a man and his son who were fishing in a nearby cove discovered the victims and summoned help by contacting park rangers. Cecelia Shepard was conscious when law enforcement officers from the Napa County Sheriff's office arrived, but lapsed into a coma during transport to the hospital and never regained consciousness. She died two days later, but Hartnell survived to recount his tale to the press. Napa County Sheriff Detective Ken Narlow, who was assigned to the case from the outset, worked on solving the crime until his retirement from the department in 1987.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2171906", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2171906", "title": "Slavery and religion", "text": "Slavery and religion\n\nHistorically, slavery has been regulated, supported or opposed on religious grounds.\n\nIn Judaism, slaves were given a range of treatments and protections. They were to be treated as extended family with certain protections and could be freed. They were property but could also own material goods.\n\nEarly Christian authors maintained spiritual equality of slaves and free persons, while accepting slavery as an institution. Early modern papal decrees allowed enslavement of unbelievers, though popes denounced slavery from the 15th century onward. In the eighteenth century the abolition movement took shape among Christians across the globe, but various denominations did not prohibit slavery among their members into the 19th century. Enslaved non-believers were sometimes converted to Christianity, but elements of their traditional beliefs merged with their Christian beliefs.\n\nEarly Islamic texts encourage kindness towards slaves and manumission, while recognising slavery as an institution and permitting enslavement of non-Muslims imprisoned or bought beyond the borders of Islamic rule. Children born to slaves were also considered legally as slaves.\n\nThe Genesis narrative about the Curse of Ham has often been held to be an aetiological story, giving a reason for the enslavement of the Canaanites. The word \"ham\" is very similar to the Hebrew word for \"hot\", which is cognate with an Egyptian word (\"kem\", which means \"black\") and is used to refer to Egypt itself, in reference to the fertile black soil along the Nile valley. Although many scholars therefore view \"Ham\" as an eponym which is used to represent Egypt in the Table of Nations, a number of Christians throughout history, including Origen and the Cave of Treasures, have argued for the alternate proposition that \"Ham\" represents all black people, his name symbolising their dark skin colour; pro-slavery advocates, from Eutychius of Alexandria and John Philoponus, to American pro-slavery apologists, have therefore occasionally interpreted the narrative as a condemnation of all black people to slavery. A few Christians, like Jerome, even took up the racist notion that black people inherently had \"a soul as black as [their] body\".\n\nSlavery was customary in antiquity, and it is condoned by the Torah. The Bible uses the Hebrew term \"ebed\" to refer to slavery; however, \"ebed\" has a much wider meaning than the English term \"slavery\", and in several circumstances it is more accurately translated into English as \"servant\". It was seen as legitimate to enslave captives obtained through warfare, but not through kidnapping. Children could also be sold into debt bondage, which was sometimes ordered by a court of law.\n\nAs with the Hittite Laws and the Code of Hammurabi, the Bible does set minimum rules for the conditions under which slaves were to be kept. Slaves were to be treated as part of an extended family; they were allowed to celebrate the Sukkot festival, and expected to honour Shabbat. Israelite slaves could not be compelled to work \"with rigour\", and debtors who sold themselves as slaves to their creditors had to be treated the same as a hired servant. If a master harmed a slave in one of the ways covered by the lex talionis, the slave was to be compensated by manumission; if the slave died within 24 to 48 hours, he or she was to be \"avenged\" (whether this refers to the death penalty or not is uncertain).\n\nIsraelite slaves were automatically manumitted after six years of work, and/or at the next Jubilee (occurring either every 49 or every 50 years, depending on interpretation), although the latter would not apply if the slave was owned by an Israelite and wasn't in debt bondage. Slaves released automatically in their 7th year of service, which did not include female slaves, or did, were to be given livestock, grain, and wine, as a parting gift (possibly hung round their necks). This 7th-year manumission could be voluntarily renounced, which would be signified, as in other Ancient Near Eastern nations, by the slave gaining a ritual ear piercing; after such renunciation, the individual was enslaved \"forever\" (and not released at the Jubilee). Non-Israelite slaves were always to be enslaved \"forever\", and treated as inheritable property.\n\nIn New Testament books, including the First Epistle of Peter, slaves are admonished to obey their masters, \"as to the Lord, and not to men\"; and the Epistle to Philemon was used by both pro-slavery advocates as well as by abolitionists; in the epistle, Paul returns Onesimus, a fugitive slave, back to his master.\n\nMore mainstream forms of first-century Judaism did not exhibit such qualms about slavery, and ever since the 2nd-century expulsion of Jews from Judea, wealthy Jews have owned non-Jewish slaves, wherever it was legal to do so; nevertheless, manumissions were approved by Jewish religious officials on the slightest of pretexts, and court cases concerning manumission were nearly always decided in favour of freedom, whenever there was uncertainty towards the facts.\n\nThe Talmud, a document of great importance in Judaism, made many rulings which had the effect of making manumission easier and more likely:\n\nJewish participation in the slave trade itself was also regulated by the Talmud. Fear of apostasy lead to the Talmudic discouragement of the sale of Jewish slaves to non-Jews, although loans were allowed; similarly slave trade with Tyre was only to be for the purpose of removing slaves from non-Jewish religion. Religious racism meant that the Talmudic writers completely forbade the sale or transfer of Canaanite slaves out from Palestine to elsewhere. Other types of trade were also discouraged: men selling themselves to women, and post-pubescent daughters being sold into slavery by their fathers. Pre-pubescent slave girls sold by their fathers had to be freed-then-married by their new owner, or his son, when she \"started\" puberty; slaves could not be allowed to marry free Jews, although masters were often granted access to the \"services\" of the wives of any of their slaves.\n\nAccording to the Talmudic law, killing of a slave is punishable in the same way as killing of a freeman, even if it was committed by the owner. While slaves are considered the owner's property, they may not work on Sabbath and holidays; they may acquire and hold property of the own.\n\nSeveral prominent Jewish writers of the Middle Ages took offense at the idea that Jews might be enslaved; Joseph Caro and Maimonides both argue that calling a Jew \"slave\" was so offensive that it should be punished by excommunication. However, they did not condemn enslavement of non-Jews. Indeed, they argued that the biblical rule, that slaves should be freed for certain injuries, should actually only apply to slaves who had converted to Judaism; additionally, Maimonides argued that this manumission was really punishment of the owner, and therefore it could only be imposed by a court, and required evidence from witnesses. Unlike the biblical law protecting fugitive slaves, Maimonides argued that such slaves should be compelled to buy their freedom.\n\nAt the same time, Maimonides and other halachic authorities forbade or strongly discouraged any unethical treatment of slaves. According to the traditional Jewish law, a slave is more like an indentured servant, who has rights and should be treated almost like a member of the owner's family. Maimonides wrote that, regardless whether a slave is Jewish or not, \"The way of the pious and the wise is to be compassionate and to pursue justice, not to overburden or oppress a slave, and to provide them from every dish and every drink. The early sages would give their slaves from every dish on their table. They would feed their servants before sitting to their own meals... Slaves may not be maltreated of offended - the law destined them for service, not for humiliation. Do not shout at them or be angry with them, but hear them out.\" In another context, Maimonides wrote that all the laws of slavery are \"mercy, compassion and forbearance\".\n\nDifferent forms of slavery existed for over 18 centuries within Christianity. Although in the early years of Christianity, freeing slaves was regarded as an act of charity, and the Christian view that all people were equal including slaves was a novel idea within the Roman Empire, the institution of slavery was rarely criticised. David Brion Davis writes that the \"variations in early Christian opinion on servitude fit comfortably within a framework of thought that would exclude any attempt to abolish slavery as an institution\". Indeed, in 340, the Synod of Gangra condemned the Manicheans for urging that slaves should liberate themselves; instead the canons of the Synod declared that anyone who preached abolitionism should be anathematised, and they also declared that slaves had a \"Christian obligation\" to submit to their masters. Augustine of Hippo, who renounced his former Manicheanism, argued that slavery was part of the mechanism to preserve the natural order of things; John Chrysostom, who is regarded as a saint by Eastern Orthodoxy and Roman Catholicism, argued that slaves should be resigned to their fate, because by \"obeying his master he is obeying God\". but he also stated that \"Slavery is the fruit of covetousness, of extravagance, of insatiable greediness\" in his Epist. ad Ephes. As the Apostle Paul admonished the early Christians; \"There is neither Jew nor Greek: there is neither bond nor free: there is neither male nor female. For you are all one in Christ Jesus\". And in fact, even some of the first popes were once slaves themselves.\n\nIn 1452 Pope Nicholas V issued the papal bull Dum Diversas, which granted Afonso V of Portugal the right to reduce any \"Saracens, pagans and any other unbelievers\" to hereditary slavery. The approval of slavery under these conditions was reaffirmed and extended in his Romanus Pontifex bull of 1455. (This papal bull was issued in response to the wars which were triggered by the Fall of Constantinople in 1453) In 1488 Pope Innocent VIII accepted the gift of 100 slaves from Ferdinand II of Aragon and distributed those slaves to his cardinals and the Roman nobility. Also, in 1639 Pope Urban VIII purchased slaves for himself from the Knights of Malta.\n\nIn the 15th and 16th centuries other Popes denounced slavery as a \"great crime\", including Pius II, Paul III, and Eugene IV. \nIn 1639, pope Urban VIII forbade slavery, as did Benedict XIV in 1741. In 1815, pope Pius VII demanded that the Congress of Vienna suppress the slave trade, and Gregory XVI condemned it again in 1839.\n\nIn addition, the Dominican friars who arrived in the Spanish settlement of Santo Domingo in 1510 strongly denounced the enslavement of the local Indians. Along with other priests, they opposed the mistreatment of the Indians and denounced it as unjust and illegal in an audience with the Spanish king as well as in the subsequent royal commission. As a response to this position, the Spanish monarchy's subsequent \"Requerimiento\" provided a religious justification for the enslavement of the local populations, on the pretext that they refused to convert to Roman Catholicism and therefore denied the authority of the Pope.\n\nVarious interpretations of Christianity were also used to justify slavery. For example,some people believed that slavery was a punishment that was reserved for sinners. Some other Christian organizations were slaveholders. The 18th-century high-church Anglican Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts owned the Codrington Plantation, in Barbados, which contained several hundred slaves, who were branded on their chests with the word \"Society\". George Whitefield, who is famed for his sparking of the so-called \"Great Awakening\" of American evangelicalism, overturned a province-wide ban against slavery, and went on to own several hundred slaves himself. Yet Whitefield is remembered as one of the first evangelists who preached to the enslaved.\n\nAt other times, Christian groups worked against slavery. The 7th-century Saint Eloi used his vast wealth to purchase British and Saxon slaves in groups of 50 to 100 in order to set them free. The Quakers in particular were early leaders of abolitionism, and in keeping with this tradition they denounced slavery at least as early as 1688. In 1787 the Society for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade was formed, and 9 of its 12 founding members were Quakers; William Wilberforce, an early supporter of the society, went on to push through the 1807 Slave Trade Act, striking a major blow against the Atlantic slave trade. Leaders of Methodism and Presbyterianism also vehemently denounced human bondage, convincing their congregations to do likewise; Methodists and Presbyterians subsequently made the repudiation of slavery a condition of membership.\n\nIn the Southern United States, however, support for slavery was strong; anti-slavery literature was prevented from passing through the postal system, and even the transcripts of sermons, by the famed English preacher Charles Spurgeon, were burned due to their censure of slavery. When the American Civil War broke out, slavery became one of the issues which would be decided by its outcome; the southern defeat led to a constitutional ban on slavery. Despite the general emancipation of slaves, members of fringe white Protestant groups like the Christian Identity movement, and the Ku Klux Klan (a white supremacist group) see the enslavement of Africans as a positive aspect of American history.\n\nIn the United States, Christianity not only held views about slavery but also on how slaves practiced their own form of Christianity. Prior to the work of Melville Herskovits in 1941, it was widely believed that all elements of African culture were destroyed by the horrific experiences of Africans who had been forced to come to the United States of America. Since his groundbreaking work, scholarship has found that Slave Christianity existed as an extraordinarily creative patchwork of African and Christian religious traditions. The slaves brought a wide variety of religious traditions with them including tribal shamanism and Islam. Beyond that, tribal traditions could vary to a high degree across the African continent.\n\nDuring the early eighteenth century, Anglican missionaries who attempted to bring Christianity to slaves in the Southern colonies often found themselves butting up against uncooperative masters and resistant slaves. An unquestionable obstacle to the acceptance of Christianity among slaves was their desire to continue to adhere to the religious beliefs and rituals of their African ancestors as much as possible. Missionaries who worked in the South were especially displeased with the slaves' retention of African practices such as polygamy and what they called idolatrous dancing. In fact, even blacks who embraced Christianity in America did not completely abandon the religion of the Old World. Instead, they engaged in syncretism, blending Christian influences with traditional African rites and beliefs. Symbols and objects, such as crosses, were conflated with charms which were carried by Africans in order to ward off evil spirits. Christ was interpreted as a healer who was similar to the priests of Africa. In the New World, fusions of African spirituality and Christianity led to distinctly new practices within slave populations, including voodoo or vodun in Haiti and Spanish Louisiana. Although African religious influences were also important among Northern blacks, the exposure to Old World religions was more intense in the South, where the density of the black population was higher.\n\nThere were, however, some commonalities across the majority of tribal traditions. Perhaps the primary understanding of tribal traditions was the commonly-held belief that there was no separation of the sacred and the secular. All life was sacred and the supernatural was present in every facet and focus of life. Most tribal traditions highlighted this experience of the supernatural in ecstatic experiences of the supernatural which were brought on by ritual song and dance. Repetitious music and dancing were often used to bring on these experiences through the use of drums and chanting. These experiences were realized in the \"possession\" of a worshipper in which one is not only taken over by the divine but actually becomes one with the divine.\n\nEchoes of African tribal traditions can be seen in the Christianity that was practiced by slaves in the Americas. The songs, dances, and ecstatic experiences of traditional tribal religions were Christianized and practiced by slaves in what is called the \"Ring Shout.\" This practice was a major mark of African American Christianity during the slavery period.\n\nChristianity came to the slaves of North America more slowly. Many colonial slaveholders feared that baptizing slaves would lead to emancipation because of vague laws which concerned the slave status of Christians under British colonial rule. Even after 1706, by which time many states had passed laws which stated that baptism would not alter a slave's status, slaveholders continued to believe that the catechization of slaves wouldn't be a wise economic choice. Slaves usually had one day off each week, usually Sunday. They used that time to grow their own crops, dance and sing (doing such things on the Sabbath was frowned upon by most preachers), so there was little time for slaves to receive religious instruction.\n\nDuring the antebellum period, slave preachers - enslaved or formally enslaved evangelists - became instrumental in shaping slave Christianity. They preached a gospel which was radically different from the gospel which was preached by white preachers, who often used Christianity in an attempt to make slaves more complacent with their enslaved status. Instead of focusing on obedience, slave preachers placed a greater emphasis on the Old Testament, especially on the Book of Exodus. They likened the plight of the American slaves to the plight of the enslaved Hebrews of the Bible, instilling hope into the hearts of those who were enslaved. Slave preachers were instrumental in shaping the religious landscape of African Americans for decades to come.\n\nAccording to Bernard Lewis, slavery has been a part of Islam's history from its beginning. The Quran like the Old and the New Testaments, states Lewis, \"assumes the existence of slavery\". It attempts to regulate slavery and thereby implicitly accepts it. Muhammad and his Companions owned slaves, and some of them acquired slaves through conquests.\n\nThe Quran does not forbid slavery, nor does it consider it as a permanent institution. In various verses, it refers to slaves as \"necks\" (\"raqabah\") or \"those whom your right hand possesses\" (\"Ma malakat aymanukum\"). In addition to these terms for slaves, the Quran and early Islamic literature uses \"'Abd\" (male) and \"Amah\" (female) term for an enslaved and servile possession, as well as other terms. According to Brockopp, seven separate terms for slaves appear in the Quran, in at least twenty nine Quranic verses.\n\nThe Quran assigns the same spiritual value to a slave as to a free man, and a believing slave is regarded as superior to a free pagan or idolator. The manumission of slaves is regarded as a meritorious act in the Quran, and is recommended either as an act of charity or as expiation for sins. While the spiritual value of a slave was same as the freeman, states Forough Jahanbakhsh, in regards to earthly matters, a slave was not an equal to the freeman and relegated to an inferior status. In Quran and for its many commentators, states Ennaji, there is a fundamental distinction between free Muslims and slaves, a basic constituent of its social organization, an irreparable dichotomy introduced by the existence of believers and infidels.\n\nThe corpus of hadith attributed to Muhammad or his Companions contains a large store of reports enjoining kindness toward slaves. Chouki El Hamel has argued that the Quran recommends gradual abolition of slavery, and that some hadith are consistent with that message while others contradict it.\n\nAccording to Dror Ze'evi, early Islamic dogma set out to improve conditions of human bondage. It forbade enslavement of free members of Islamic society, including non-Muslims (\"dhimmis\") residing under Islamic rule. Islam also allowed the acquisition of lawful non-Muslim slaves who were imprisoned, slaves purchased from lands outside the Islamic state, as well as considered the boys or girls born to slaves as slaves. Islamic law treats a free man and a slave unequally in sentencing for an equivalent crime. For example, traditional Sunni jurisprudence, with the exception of Hanafi law, objects to putting a free man to death for killing a slave. A slave who commits a crime may receive the same punishment as a free man, a punishment half as severe, or the master may be responsible for paying the damages, depending on the crime. According to Ze'evi, Islam considered the master to own the slave's labor, a slave to be his master's property to be sold or bought at will, and that the master was entitled to slave's sexual submission.\n\nThe Islamic law (sharia) allows the taking of infidels (non-Muslims) as slaves, during religious wars also called holy wars or \"jihad\". In the early Islamic communities, according to Kecia Ali, \"both life and law were saturated with slaves and slavery\". War, tribute from vassal states, purchase and children who inherited their parent's slavery were the sources of slaves in Islam. In Islam, according to Paul Lovejoy, \"the religious requirement that new slaves be pagans and need for continued imports to maintain slave population made Africa an important source of slaves for the Islamic world.\" Slavery of non-Muslims, followed by the structured process of converting them to Islam then encouraging the freeing of the converted slave, states Lovejoy helped the growth of Islam after its conquests.\n\nAccording to Mohammed Ennaji, the ownership gave the master a right \"to punish one's slave\". In Islam, a child inherited slavery if he or she was born to a slave mother and slave father. However, if the child was born to a slave mother and her owner master, then the child was free. Slaves could be given as property (dower) during marriage. The text encourages Muslim men to take slave women as sexual partners (concubines), or marry them. Islam, states Lewis, did not permit \"Dhimmis\" (non-Muslims) \"to own Muslim slaves; and if a slave owned by a dhimmi embraced Islam, his owner was legally obliged to free or sell him\". There was also a gradation in the status on the slave, and his descendants, after the slave converted to Islam.\n\nUnder Islamic law, in \"what might be called civil matters\", a slave was \"a chattel with no legal powers or rights whatsoever\", states Lewis. A slave could not own or inherit property or enter into a contract. However, he was better off in terms of rights than Greek or Roman slaves. According to Chirag Ali, the early Muhammadans misinterpreted the Quran as sanctioning \"polygamy, arbitrary divorce, slavery, concubinage and religious wars\", and he states that the Quranic injunctions are against all this. According to Ron Shaham and other scholars, the various jurisprudence systems on Sharia such as Maliki, Hanafi, Shafi'i, Hanbali and others differ in their interpretation of the Islamic law on slaves.\n\nSlaves were particularly numerous in Muslim armies. Slave armies were deployed by Sultans and Caliphs at various medieval era war fronts across the Islamic Empires, playing an important role in the expansion of Islam in Africa and elsewhere. Slavery of men and women in Islamic states such as the Ottoman Empire, states Ze'evi, continued through the early 20th-century.\n\nBahá'u'lláh, founder of the Bahá'í Faith, commended Queen Victoria for abolishing the slave trade in a letter written to Her Majesty between 1868–1872. Bahá'u'lláh also forbids slavery in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas written around 1873 considered by Bahá'ís to be the holiest book revealed by Bahá'u'lláh in which he states, \"It is forbidden you to trade in slaves, be they men or women.\"\n\nBoth the Báb and Bahá'u'lláh owned slaves of African descent before the writing of the Kitab-i-Aqdas. While the Báb purchased several slaves, Bahá'u'lláh acquired his through inheritance and freed them. Bahá'u'lláh officially condemned slavery in 1874. 21st century scholarship has found that the Báb credited one of the slaves of his elders as having raised him and compares him favorably with his own father. Work has continued on other recent finds in archives such as a very early document of Bahá'u'lláh's explaining his emancipating his slave because as all humans are symbolically slaves of God none can be owned by another saying \"How, then, can this thrall claim for himself ownership of any other human being? Nay,….\"\n\nHindu Vedas regard liberation to be the ultimate goal which is contrary to slavery. Hindu Smritis condemn slavery.\n\nThe term \"dasa\" (dāsa) in ancient Hindu text is loosely translated as \"slave.\" However, the meaning of the term varied over time. R. S. Sharma, in his 1958 book, for example, states that the only word which could possibly mean slave in Rigveda is dāsa, and this sense of use is traceable to four later verses in Rigveda. The term dāsa in the Rigveda, has been also been translated as a servant or enemy, and the identity of this term remains unclear and disputed among scholars.\n\nThe word \"dāsi\" is found in Rigveda and Atharvaveda, states R.S. Sharma, which he states represented \"a small servile class of women slaves\". Slavery in Vedic period, according to him, was mostly confined to women employed as domestic workers. He translates \"dasi\" in a Vedic era Upanishad as \"maid-servant\". Male slaves are rarely mentioned in the Vedic texts. The word dāsa occurs in the Hindu Sruti texts Aitareya and Gopatha Brahmanas, but not in the sense of a slave.\n\nTowards the end of the Vedic period (600 BCE), a new system of \"varnas\" had appeared, with people called shudras replacing the erstwhile \"dasas\". Some of the \"shudras\" were employed as labouring masses on farm land, much like \"helots of Sparta\", even though they were not treated with the same degree of coercion and contempt. They could be given away as gifts along with the land, which came in for criticism from the religious texts \"Āśvalāyana\" and \"Kātyāyana\" \"Śrautasūtras\". The term \"dasa\" was now employed to designate such enslaved people. Slavery arose out of debt, sale by parents or oneself (due to famines), judicial decree or fear. The slaves were differentiated by origin and different disabilities and rules for manumission applied. While this could happen to a person of any \"varna\", \"shudras\" were much more likely to be reduced to slavery.\n\nThe Arthashastra laid down norms for the State to resettle \"shudra\" cultivators into new villages and providing them with land, grain, cattle and money. It also stated that \"aryas\" could not be subject to slavery and that the selling or mortgaging of a \"shudra\" was punishable unless he was a born slave.\n\nIn the territories controlled by the East India Company, in South Asia, an adaptation of a Dharmaśāstra named Manusmriti, and specifically an interpretation of verse 8.415 of the Manusmriti, was used to regulate the practice in Hindu communities, via what became known as the Hindu law.\n\nIn Pali language Buddhist texts, \"Amaya-dasa\" has been translated by Davids and Stede in 1925, as a \"slave by birth\", \"Kila-dasa\" translated as a \"bought slave\", and \"Amata-dasa\" as \"one who sees Amata (Sanskrit: \"Amrita\", nectar of immortality) or Nibbana\". However, \"dasa\" in ancient texts can also mean \"servant\".\n\nWords related to \"dasa\" are found in early Buddhist texts, such as \"dāso na pabbājetabbo\", which Davids and Stede translate as \"the slave cannot become a Bhikkhu\". This restriction on who could become a Buddhist monk is found in Vinaya Pitakam i.93, Digha Nikaya, Majjhima Nikāya, Tibetan \"Bhiksukarmavakya\" and \"Upasampadajnapti\". Schopen states that this translation of \"dasa\" as slave is disputed by scholars.\n\nEarly Buddhist texts in Pali, according to R. S. Sharma, mention \"dāsa\" and \"kammakaras\", and they show that those who failed to pay their debts were enslaved, and Buddhism did not allow debtors and slaves to join their monasteries.\n\nThe Buddhist Emperor Ashoka banned slavery and renounced war.\n\nMedieval Buddhist states codified slavery, combining local customary practices with derivatives of the Vedic Manusmriti. The series of Theravada Buddhist states covering Burma and North West India observed the 14 kinds of slavery set out in the Wareru Dhammathat, while Slavery in Bhutan was regulated into the mid 20th century by a local derivation of the Tibetan Buddhism Tsa Yig Chenmo.\n\nSikh Gurus vehemently protested against the institution of slavery and preached that the multitudes of slaves were not supposed to toil and sweat in the tireless service of privileged one. Many Sikh warriors of 18th century played an important role in fight against slavery and freeing of slaves. For example, Banda Singh Bahadur is known to have halted the Zamindari and Taluqdari system in the time he was active and gave the farmers proprietorship of their own land. The Zamindars, or landlords, were usually from the higher castes. Lower caste individuals borrowed money against their holdings from the landlords for marriage expenses, housing, or farming costs. On defaulting, they would find themselves obliged to repay the debt through labour. Hereditary relationships continued between debtors and their masters, as generations found themselves in debt bondage, leading to slavery. \n\nDuring Ahmad Shah Abdali's invasion of 1757, Sikhs, under the leadership of Baba Deep Singh, not only plundered his loot and but also rescued captive Hindu women. These women were captured by Ahmad Shah Abdali to sell them as maidens and slaves.\n\n\n"}

It occupies a strategic position on an isthmus between Loch Lochy to the east, and Loch Arkaig to the west.\n\nThe settlement has a long association with Clan Cameron: Sir Ewen Cameron of Lochiel built the original Achnacarry Castle in about 1655. This was destroyed by government troops after the Battle of Culloden, but \"New Achnacarry\" was built near the same site in Scottish Baronial style in 1802. In the Second World War it housed the Commando Basic Training Centre and the village retains close ties to British Commandos, the United States Army Rangers and similar units from other allied nations. In 1928, the Achnacarry Agreement was signed, an early attempt to set petroleum production quotas.\n\nAchnacarry is not far from the village of Spean Bridge and about north of the town of Fort William. It has been described by Queen Victoria as follows:\n\n\"As you approach Achnacarry, which lies rather low, but is surrounded by very fine trees, the luxuriance of the tangled woods, surmounted by rugged hills, becomes finer and finer till you come to Loch Arkaig, a little over from the house. This is a very lovely loch, reminding one of Loch Katrine, especially where there is a little pier, from which we embarked on board a very small but nice screw steamer which belongs to Cameron of Lochiel.\"—Royal Visit to Achnacarry, from the Journal of Queen Victoria, Friday, 12 September 1873.\n\nBetween Achnacarry Castle and Loch Arkaig is a path of interwoven trees known as The Dark Mile, or Mile Dorcha.\n\nEwen \"Eoghainn MacAilein\" Cameron, XIII Chief of Clan Cameron, built the highly disputed Tor Castle (said to have been on Clan Mackintosh lands) in the early 16th century. Tor Castle would remain the seat of the Camerons of Lochiel until demolished by his great-great-great grandson, Sir Ewen \"Dubh\" Cameron, XVII Chief.\n\nSir Ewen Cameron wanted a \"more convenient\" house, which was further removed from the Clan Mackintosh, Clan Campbell and Oliver Cromwell's garrison at Inverlochy Castle. He built Achnacarry Castle in around 1655 in a strategic position on the isthmus between Loch Lochy and Loch Arkaig. One of the few remaining descriptions relate that Lochiel's seat was \"a large house, all built of fir-planks, the handsomest of that kind in Britain.\" Sir Ewen's bard described the home somewhere around 1663 in song as \"The generous house of feasting...Pillared hall of princes...Where wine goes round freely in gleaming glasses...Music resounding under its rafters.\" Others portrayed \"old\" Achnacarry as a \"man's home,\" with the feel and look of a grand hunting lodge amidst the West Highlands.\n\nIn 1665 the Stand-off at the Fords of Arkaig took place near Achnacarry, which saw the Camerons finally end their 360-year feud with the Chattan Confederation led by the Clan Mackintosh. \n\nWith Sir Ewen's death in the early 18th century his son John Cameron became Clan Chief, soon after which his son, Donald would assume Achnacarry when Lord Lochiel (as his father was known) fled into exile in Flanders after the first Jacobite Uprising.\n\nFrom Donald Cameron (\"The Gentle Lochiel\") XIX Chief we find the best description of the grounds of Achnacarry. In his marriage contract a requirement was placed in which Lochiel had to build his wife \"a house...to the value of 100 pounds sterling at least, with gardens, office houses [privies], lands, other conveniencys.\" Donald was planting a long line of beech trees near the banks of the River Arkaig when word of \"Bonnie Prince Charlie's\" landing arrived in 1745...it would be the last landscaping done at Achnacarry Castle for years to come.\n\nWith the Jacobite army's defeat at the Battle of Culloden in April 1746 the clans retreated into the Scottish Highlands, with Donald taking the lead in re-grouping them. After this last attempt at resistance failed, he and his men took to the mountains. On May 28, 1746, Donald watched as men from Bligh's Regiment under the command of Lt-Col Edward Cornwallis and an Independent Company of Munros, commanded by George Munro, 1st of Culcairn, burned Achnacarry to the ground. Many valued relics and personal possessions were relocated beforehand, but the great fir-planked \"Old\" Achnacarry was left in ashes.\n\nIn 1802 Achnacarry, which had spent the last fifty or so years in ruin, was rebuilt under Donald Cameron, XXII Chief of Clan Cameron as a Scottish baronial style home, although this \"New Achnacarry\" is still referred to as a castle. His wife Anne \"née\" Abercromby engaged James Gillespie as architect.\n\nIn 1928 Achnacarry served as the meeting place for global petroleum producers in an effort to set production quotas. A document known as the Achnacarry Agreement or \"As-Is\" Agreement was signed on 17 September 1928.\n\nThe current building and the surrounding estate gained fame as the Commando Training Depot for the Allied Forces from March 1942 to 1945. British Commandos, United States Army Rangers and commandos from France, the Netherlands, Norway, Czechoslovakia, Poland and Belgium trained there. Each training course culminated in an \"opposed landing\" exercise around the area of nearby Bunarkaig on Loch Lochy. As live ammunition was used, there were some casualties whilst training at Achnacarry. Some 25,000 commandos completed training at the centre during the four years it was in use.\nThe castle also suffered some damage due to fire. Several military associations still sponsor a Commando march either annually or from time to time. Generally it is a timed march, in full battle gear, backpack and combat boots, from Spean Bridge (site of the striking Commando Memorial) to Achnacarry.\n\nIn August 2001, Achnacarry served as the site of the International Gathering of Clan Cameron, commemorating the 50th anniversary of Colonel Sir Donald Hamish Cameron of Lochiel, K.T., XXVI Chief of Clan Cameron. It also hosted the International Gathering of Clan Cameron in the summer of 2009.\n\nAlthough the castle itself is in private hands and is not open to the public, the commando memorial can be visited.\n\nVisitors are welcome at the Clan Cameron Museum about from the castle. The current Chief of Clan Cameron, traditionally known simply as \"Lochiel\", Donald Cameron of Lochiel, continues to live in Achnacarry. Displays in the museum include the clan's legends, chiefs, slogans, history, clan lands in Lochaber, and notable clansmen. Other exhibits include artifacts associated with the castle and estate's history, with the Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders, and with \"Bonnie Prince Charlie\".\n\n\n"}

Her husband, journalist Georgiy Gongadze, was abducted and murdered in 2000. Since then she has been a prominent advocate for freedom of the press and protection of the safety of reporters in the Ukraine, and has continued to work for justice in the case of her husband's murder.\n\nMyroslava Petryshyn ()\nwas born on June 19, 1972, in Berezhany, Ternopil Oblast, Ukraine. She earned a master's degree in civic law from Lviv University (completed in 1997), and in the early 1990s worked as a legal consultant for local government agencies.\n\nDuring the early 1990s, Petryshyn became involved in journalism and Ukrainian politics. In 1993 she was a specialist in the information department of the journal \"Post-Postup\". In 1994 and 1995 she served as deputy director and director of the press center for the New Wave political alliance (). During 1995 she was the head of the media department for the International Media Center STB (), and in 1998 was the head of public relations for the daily newspaper \"Day\" ().\nAt the same time, Petryshyn became active in filmmaking . She was assistant director of Georgiy Gongadze's documentary short film \"Shadows of War\" (, 1993) about the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict\n\nand executive producer of \"Dream Defenders\" (, 1996).\n\nMyroslava Petryshyn was married to Georgiy Gongadze in 1995, and their twin daughters were born in 1997.\n\nAlong with her husband, Myroslava Gongadze continued to work in journalistic projects opposed to the administration of President Leonid Kuchma.\n\nIn 2000, Georgiy Gongadze was kidnapped and brutally murdered. Secret tape recordings provided by one of the president's bodyguards and released by opposition politicians implicated Kuchma in the crime. The resulting political controversy became known as the cassette scandal, damaged Kuchma's popularity and laid part of the groundwork for the Orange Revolution of 2004. It also brought Myroslava Gongadze to greater prominence as a campaigner for democracy, human rights, and freedom of the press in Ukraine. She has continued to seek justice in the case of her husband's abduction and murder.\n\nShe and her two children received political asylum in the United States in 2001. In an interview with \"Ukrayinska Pravda\" in February 2005, Myroslava Gongadze said she would come back to Ukraine if her husband's murderers, and those who gave the orders to murder him, were punished. Since arriving in the United States, Gongadze has worked as a TV and radio correspondent for VOA, a freelance correspondent for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, and a visiting Scholar at the Institute for European, Russian and Eurasian Studies at George Washington University in Washington, D.C. In 2001, Gongadze was awarded a Reagan-Fascell Democracy Fellowship to study the role of the media in Ukraine's transition to democracy.\nIn October 2009, she was ranked 91st in a top 100 of \"most influential women in Ukraine\" compiled by experts for the Ukrainian magazine \"Focus.\n\nGongadze expressed her skepticism about the political state of modern Ukraine in November 2009; in an editorial in \"The Wall Street Journal\", she argued that its democracy was degenerating and its freedom of the press was at risk.\n\nGongadze has been the head of the Ukrainian Service at the Voice of America since October 4, 2015. She frequently writes on Ukrainian current affairs and political developments in Eastern Europe and NATO.\n\nShe interviewed Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko in 2015 in Ukraine. In the interview, President Poroshenko called for a revocation of Russia's veto in the United Nations Security Council. Despite Russian occupation of the Ukrainian territory of Crimea and the war in Eastern Ukraine, he argued that \"it is impossible to stop Ukraine's resolute drive toward the European home.\"\n\nIn 2018, she covered US representatives' trip to the warzone in Eastern Ukraine. In an interview, U.S. Special Representative for Ukraine Negotiations Kurt Volker said that residents in the embattled Donbass region say they want a peace agreement that restores territorial control of the region to Kyiv. \"And these were clearly ethnic Russians, as you could tell by the language they spoke,\" he said. \"That Russian speakers are pro-Russian or that this is an ethnic conflict, just clearly isn't true.\"\n\nIn 2014-15, she produced and hosted “Prime Time,\" an interview program which featured leading Ukrainian and international policymakers. In one episode, then-US Ambassador to the United Nations, Samantha Power, explained the Obama administration's decision not to support Ukraine with lethal weapons.\n\nIn 2014, she was awarded the civil decoration the Order Princess Olga from the Ukrainian Government, in recognition of her professional achievements and contribution to journalism. In 2018, she was chosen to be a Nieman Fellow at Harvard University.\n\nOn 16 September 2002, she lodged a complaint with the European Court of Human Rights citing Article 2 (right to life) of the European Convention on Human Rights and maintaining that the death of her husband was the result of a forced disappearance and that the Ukrainian authorities failed to protect his life. She also maintains that the atmosphere of fear and uncertainty, as well as the incomplete and contradictory information provided during the investigation, forced her to leave the country and caused her suffering, contrary to Article 3 (prohibition of inhuman and degrading treatment) of the Convention. On 31 March 2005, the court declared her complaint admissible and thereby agreed to pursue her case against the State of Ukraine.\n\nOn 9 November 2005, the European Court of Human Rights passed its judgement in case of \"Myroslava Gongadze vs Ukraine\" in favor of the late journalist's widow. Under the Court's ruling, Ukraine has violated articles 2, 3, 13 and 41 of the European Convention on Human Rights by the Ukrainian power's failure to protect the right to life of the applicant's husband, Georgiy Gongadze.\n\nAccording to the judgement, the investigation was not adequate and caused many moral traumas to the applicant. The court awarded the applicant 100,000 euros in respect of pecuniary and non-pecuniary damages.\n\nDuring the 2004 presidential campaign, the opposition candidate Viktor Yushchenko pledged to solve the case if he became president. Yushchenko did become president following the subsequent Orange Revolution and immediately launched a new investigation, replacing the country's prosecutor-general.\n\nThe Gongadze murder trial began on 9 January 2006, in Kiev. Three former policemen are charged with the killing of Georgiy Gongadze. Another suspect, ex-police general Oleksiy Pukach, who had been believed to have fled abroad but was found in Ukraine in 2009 living under his real name, was arrested and charged. On the day the trial started, Myroslava Gongadze commented on the fact that no one has been charged for ordering the killing: \"They are known and they should be punished just the same as those who will be sitting in the dock today\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2171944", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2171944", "title": "Calapan", "text": "Calapan\n\n', officially the ', (), or referred simply as Calapan City is a and the capital of the province of , . According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nThe city serves as the gateway to the Oriental Mindoro province with the implementation of the Strong Republic Nautical Highway (SRNH) an integrated ferry project of then President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo that extends further to the southern part of the Philippines. The Calapan City Seaport is the largest and busiest seaport on Mindoro Island, which is just 45 minutes away by ferry boats and roll-on/roll-off (RORO) ships to-and-fro Batangas City International Seaport.\n\nCalapan is currently one of the only two cities in Region 4-B (MIMAROPA) the other being Puerto Princesa City in Palawan. Calapan serves as the region's administrative center. It is also the center of commerce, industry, transport, communication, religious activities and education in the entire province of Oriental Mindoro.\n\nCalapan was formerly a small village before the establishment of the first Religious District in Baco. The District convent was transferred to Calapan in 1733 and began its jurisdiction over the Northern Mindoro Ecclesiastical Area.\n\nIn the early 18th century, the town only occupied a strip of land stretching from Ibaba to Ilaya in a cross-shape facing the present church and cut off by the river. Later on, succeeding barrios were founded.\n\nIn 1837, the capital of the province was moved from Puerto Galera to Calapan. When Mindoro became a part of Marinduque on June 13, 1902, the provincial capital was once again moved to Puerto Galera. On November 10, 1902, Mindoro was detached from Marinduque. In 1903, Calapan once again became the provincial capital.\n\nWhen Mindoro was detached from Marinduque on November 10, 1902, Baco, Puerto Galera and San Teodoro were annexed to Calapan in 1905 under Act. 1280, adding a total area of . of land. In 1902, under Act 2824, the three municipalities gained their independence.\n\nIn 1919, the boundary dispute between Calapan and Naujan was adjudicated by \"Presidentes\" (Mayors) Agustin Quijano of Calapan and Agustin Garong of Naujan over a portion of the territory of what is now known as the present boundary. The portion of agricultural area was awarded to Naujan, thus, making the area of Calapan much smaller as compared to that of Naujan which is now considered as the biggest municipality of the province.\n\nIn the year 1998, Calapan was converted from a municipality into a component city by virtue of Republic Act No. 8475. The law was authored in Congress by Rep. Renato V. Leviste and was signed by President Fidel Ramos on February 2, 1998. On March 21, 1998, the people of Calapan ratified the creation of the City of Calapan in a plebiscite marking the same day as the city’s foundation day. Incumbent Mayor Arnan C. Panaligan became the last Municipal Mayor and the first City Mayor of Calapan. To date, it is the first and only city in the whole island of Mindoro.\n\nCalapan was reclassified from a 4th class city in 2007 to a 2nd class city in 2010, on account of its innovations in public service, modernization programs, increased revenue collection, and overall economic improvement.\n\nThe derivation of the name of Calapan cannot be traced with certainty. Some opined that it came from the word “Kalap” which means to gather logs. Thus “Kalapan” was supposed to be a place where logs were gathered. In the old records, however, there was never a mention of Calapan as a place where logs were produced or exported. Furthermore, huge forest trees where logs were produced certainly did not grow near the town, which was swampy. Another theory holds that Calapan was originally pronounced as “Kalapang” which, according to an old Tagalog dictionary, was a synonym for “sanga” or branch. It could then refer to the settlement of Kalapang as a branch of its mother town of Baco, an adjoining town. The name was later hispanized as Calapan.\n\nCalapan is bounded to the north and north-east by the Calapan Bay, south and southeast by Naujan, and to the west by the Baco. The city lies at the quadrangle bounded by 13°12.6 and 13°27’ north latitudes and 121°17’ east longitudes. It is approximately from the nearest point of Batangas, south of Batangas City and south of Manila.\n\nThe city has an area of and is composed of 62 barangays of which 22 are classified as urban and 40, rural. The city also has jurisdiction over the Baco Islands and the two Silonay Islets on Calapan Bay.\n\nThe overall land characteristic is a wide plain with rivers, interspersed with wetlands at the seacoast periphery. The highest elevation is above sea level at Bulusan Hill, a long landform east of the city, which interrupts the mostly flat terrain north-east of the Halcon-Baco Mountain Range.\n\nCalapan's climate is described as mild. It is relatively dry from November to April and wet during the rest of the year. February and March have the least rainfall while October and November are the months of greatest rainfall. Average yearly rainfall is at the City’s south-west portion. The average daily temperature is .\n\nWind direction throughout the year is variable; Northeast monsoons prevail from August, November, December and January to March; East to Northeast on April; Southeast to South on May and June; Northeast to South on July and September, and Easterly on October.\n\nClimate is favorable for vegetation throughout the year under the Type III climate type of the Philippine weather bureau, PAGASA, with relative humidity at 81%.\n\nCalapan has a population of 133,893 as of the 2015 census.\n\nThe city's economy is dependent on agriculture and fishing. However, a growing industry in machinery and tourism has contributed well to the city's annual income making it one of the fastest growing new cities in the country for the last 10 years.\n\nSince 1998, the city has experienced rapid development. The establishment of a special development area, particularly an eco-zone for light industries located at the Urban Development Area (Lumangbayan and Guinobatan), has been promoted and now serves as growth area which generates employment and spurs economic opportunities. Such industries focus on agro-industrial based activities such as food processing, handicraft making, furniture making and other related activities.\n\nCalapan plays a major role in the Philippine economy as one of the major food suppliers in the country. The city is also a major exporter of rice supplying to Metro Manila and major parts of Luzon making it both an agriculturally-progressive and urbanized city. The five major crops are rice, citrus, banana, rambutan and lanzones. The top five industries in Calapan are trading, tourism, services, marine and aquatic, and food processing.\n\nCalapan serves as the province’s industrial hub. It plays a pivotal role in the economic development of the province and its adjacent areas.\n\nTrading and commercial activities are mainly confined in wholesale and retail trade. Other thriving industries are manufacturing, financing, tourism, food and beverages and services. In recent years, the city has witnessed the influx of private investments that increase income and employment opportunities. The City Investment Code encourages new and existing entrepreneurs to increase their investments. All business establishments are also required to employ bonafide residents of the city to at least 70% of the job opportunities that they will generate.\n\nMajority of the vast agricultural lands of Calapan is devoted to rice production. Other crops grown in the area are citrus fruits such as calamansi, banana, lanzones, rambutan, mango, coconut and vegetables.\n\nPort of Calapan is the primary seaport serving the city which connected through routes to the Port of Batangas City in mainland Luzon. Motorized tricycles are a common mode of transport and jeepneys and vans served as transportation options to other municipalities within Oriental Mindoro which passes through the mostly concreted pronvincial road spanning the province.\n\nThe city also has an airport, the Calapan Airport, classified as a secondary airport and is used for general aviation handling mostly small planes and choppers with regular trips from Manila Domestic Airport.\n\nThe city is host to numerous higher educational institutions. The Divine Word College of Calapan, a Catholic college run by the Divine Word Missionaries is currently the largest institution of higher learning in the city and the province of Oriental Mindoro. Other private institutions of higher learning include the St. Anthony College Calapan City (Information Technology, Nursing and Tourism), Luna Goco Colleges (Nursing), Southwestern Luzon Maritime Institute Foundation and Filipino Academy of Scientific Trades (Maritime Studies), AMA Computer Learning Center (Information Technology), and CLCC Institute of Computer Arts and Technology (Information Technology).\n\nThere are currently two public institutions of higher learning in the city. One is the Mindoro State University (Calapan Campus) while the other is the City College of Calapan which was opened last June 2008 through the initiative of City Mayor Salvador Leachon.\n\nCalapan has nine national high schools (NHS), one of which is the Oriental Mindoro National High School (OMNHS) the main campus of the school and the largest public high school in Oriental Mindoro. Other public high schools include the Mamerta Gargullo Tolentino Memorial National High School (former Parang NHS), Ceriaco A. Abes Memorial MNHS, Canubing NHS, Managpi NHS, Pedro V. Panaligan MNHS, the Community Vocational High School, the LEMNAHIS Bucayao Annex and the Nag-iba National High School (former LEMNAHIS Annex Nag-iba).\n\nThe Catholic Church also runs the Holy Infant Academy, while DWCC also maintains a Basic Education Department.\n\nPublic elementary schools meanwhile are organized into three districts. They are the Calapan West, Calapan South (Pedro Tolentino Memorial School (PTMS) and Calapan East Districts.\n\nThe city is served primarily by the Oriental Mindoro Medical Center which is also the largest hospital in the province. There are also numerous private hospitals in the city such as the Medical Mission Group Hospital and Health Services Cooperative which is the only tertiary level hospital in the region, Maria Estrella General Hospital, Santa Maria Village Hospital, Hospital of the Holy Cross and the Luna-Goco Medical Center.\n\nIn addition, the city has public health centers providing free health check-ups and basic medicine supplies to all residents. These public centers are being funded and supported by the City Health and Sanitation Department.\n\nBarangays\n\nThe City of Calapan is divided into 62 barangays, (the smallest local government units) which handles governance in a much smaller area. These barangays are grouped into congressional districts where each district is represented by a congressman in the country's House of Representatives.\n\n\n\n"}

Barangays Bagumbayan, Cantil, Odiong and Paclasan are considered as urban and the rest as rural areas.\n\nFounded by Andres Torrefiel on November 15, 1948, it was formerly known as Paclasan, originally a part of Bulalacao, Oriental Mindoro, then a barrio of Mansalay, Oriental Mindoro. It was named after President Manuel A. Roxas, the first town to be named as such.\n\n\nIn 2003, the Strong Republic Nautical Highway (SNRH) was inaugurated, resulting in the opening of the Port of Roxas, located in Barangay Dangay. The town then became a transit point to Boracay, Romblon (Odiongan and Sibuyan), and Palawan. Several shipping companies such as Starlite and Montenegro Shipping Lines serve this route.\n\nThe town is mostly agricultural, with palay, bananas, coconuts, rambutan, lansones, calamansi, and other fruits as primary agricultural crops. Barangays like Cantil, Victoria, Dangay, San Isidro, and Odiong are primarily planted with rice. Barangay Little Tanauan and San Miguel are noted for its fruit orchards and vegetables. Also, some upland barangays like Maraska, San Jose, and San Rafael have developed backyard goat raising.\n\n=Operational Banks=\n\nThe town can be reached through different modes of transportation. From Calapan, the town can be reached by public utility vans and buses. Roxas is the main port for vessels going to and coming from Caticlan, Malay, Aklan, which is approximately a 4-hour RORO ferry ride from the town. From Caticlan, it is just a short boat ride to the island of Boracay . Bus companies such as RORO Bus Transport, Dimple Star Bus Lines, and Ceres buses also serve the Manila-Roxas route.\n\nCellular phone signal from Globe and Smart is strong in the municipality. Terrestrial and cable television services are also available through CATSI, Dream Satellite TV, Cignal Digital TV, Tamaraw Vision Network of Calapan, and ROMICOM (a local CATV network). Radio programming is available via 93.3 BRIGADA NEWS FM and the DZRH affiliate 98.9 Hot FM Roxas.\n\nTertiary schools\n\nSecondary Schools\n\n"}
{"id": "2171949", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2171949", "title": "San Teodoro, Oriental Mindoro", "text": "San Teodoro, Oriental Mindoro\n\n', officially the ', (), is a in the province of , . According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nThe municipality is classified as partly urban. It has a total land area of . Mineral deposits found in the area are gold and iron.\n\nSan Teodoro is west of the province's capital, Calapan, east from Puerto Galera, and about south of Philippine capital Manila. It is located on the northern part of Oriental Mindoro. It is bounded to the north by the Verde Island Passage, to the east by Baco, to the west by Puerto Galera, and to the south by Santa Cruz in Occidental Mindoro province.\n\nSan Teodoro is politically subdivided into 8 barangays:\n\nThe town of San Teodoro was called \"\"Subaan\"\" during the Spanish times however the town center and seat of government was located at what is now \"Lumangbayan\". Officially, \"Subaan\" and its neighboring town \"Baco\", were \"\"visitas\"\" of Calapan, the \"cabecera\" (capital) of Oriental Mindoro.\n\nIn 1828, the \"visita\" was headed by \"Gobernadorcillo\" Ysidro Crisostomo. He was succeeded by Gobernadorcillo Juan Sextol in 1830. When Subaan became a \"visita del pueblo y cabecera de Puerto Galera\" in 1840, Candido Fulgencia's position was reduced to \"\"Cabeza de Barangay\"\". This was also the title conferred on Marcelino Crisostomo in 1841.\n\n\"Subaan\" and \"Baco\" were again annexed to Calapan in 1852. Melchor Alcones Felix was elected \"gobernadorcillo\" with Rufino Arcon and Justo Arandia as \"cabezas de barangay\" of 2 barangays. In 1856 they were replaced by Domingo Artillero and Bernardo Arenillo. There were just 3 barangays in 1889 and the \"cabezas\" were Faustino Artellero, Telesforo Fernandez and Modesto Alcones. When Subaan was declared a sovereign municipality (\"pueblo\") in 1892, the new \"gobernadorcillo\" was Juan Rojas. In 1897, it was Ruperto Arce but the title \"Gobernadorcillo\" was changed to \"\"Capitan Municipal\"\". When Capitan Juan Rojas won the election again, it made him the only official who had been addressed by 3 different titles in his capacity as mayor of Subaan. He was the last \"gobernadorcillo\" because after his term, it was changed to \"capitan municipal\". He was the last \"capitan\" because when Mindoro fell to the hands of the revolutionaries, he took oath under the emissary of Gen. Miguel Malvar on July 1, 1898 as \"\"Presidente Municipal\"\". Pres. Rojas was the first and the last leader of Subaan under the Revolutionary Government of General Emilio Aguinaldo.\n\nBefore the turn of the century, Subaan had four \"cabezerias\": Ylag, Tacligan, Bigaan and Pauican plus Subaan Proper \"(Lumangbayan)\" which in turn had 7 \"sitios\" namely Agbiray, Calabugao (both named after adjacent rivers), Bulaso, Calero, Calumpang, Tanak and Tubigan. During those times only the coastal areas were populated as water boats were the only mode of transportation between \"barangays\". Bigaan was an exception because it had 10 inhabitants despite being inland.\n\nIn the morning of early February 1902, at the decline of the Philippine–American War, the town people of Subaan proper (now Lumangbayan) were disturbed by the deafening series of horn blasts coming from an American warship escorting a gunboat that anchored off the shores of Subaan Bay. The people headed by Capitan Juan Rojas preferred to flee to the forest and took refuge in the hills of Tanak and Pawikan.\n\nThe people had reasons to be apprehensive. Six months earlier, 25 Mindoreños were killed during the American assault of Calapan. Random firing from Calero hilltop felled the priest named Fr. Vicente Jose and former Gobernadorcillo Pedro Luces Luna. Several houses were torched and large cache of firearms and ammunitions were captured. Mindoro is used to be bypassed by the Americans at the height of their campaign against Filipino insurgency. But after the capture of Gen. Emilio Aguinaldo in March 1901, they turned their attention to Mindoro, one of the islands in Luzon under Filipino control. The Americans employed many Filipino mercenaries whom they called \"\"Macabebes\"\". These mercenaries were feared more by the Mindoreños because of their ruthlessness. The hoisting of the Star-Spangled Banner in Calapan town plaza on July 29, 1901 ended the short-lived revolutionary government in Mindoro. But the insurgency never came to a halt. Sporadic fighting around the island continued. Americans employed reign of terror. Towns were razed to the ground, sources of drinking water poisoned, animals and harvests were confiscated or burned, and prisoners were maltreated. Houses were demolished for the construction materials needed in building military quarters and stockades and to create spaces for plazas and markets. War between the Americans and Mindoreños became destructive. Each camp resorted to atrocities utilizing kidnapping and hostage taking of families to force rebels to surrender as in the case of Governor Juan Morente of Pinamalayan. The group of Valeriano Gasic of Naujan in turn executed 70 suspected American collaborators.\n\nThe sparsely populated Subaan community was defenseless. The US pacification and exploration force leader Commander Lt. Theodore Hutchins and his soldiers went ashore but were surprised to see that the town was deserted. Before noontime, when still nobody showed up, Lt. Hutchins ordered the burning of the town. President Juan Rojas upon seeing what happened from his observation post at Tanak Hills rushed to the shore and approached the Americans. To appease the returning evacuees. Lt. Hutchins through the interpretation of Sgt. Teodoro Viray of Pampanga, offered them a policy of attraction. It was the objective of Governor William H. Taft to “hold the Philippines (as colony) for the benefit of the Filipinos”. He replaced Gen. Arthur MacArthur, the father of Douglas MacArthur of World War II fame, because the military governor treated the Filipinos harshly. Civil Governor-General Taft then launched a sweeping reorganization of central and local government. He later returned to the United States to become the 27th American president.\n\nLt. Hutchins saw that the topographic location of Subaan proper was not suitable for future municipal site expansion. The place was surrounded by nipa swamps and marshland, and the shores were muddy and rocky. He asked Pres. Juan Rojas if they could find a broader place for the town site. The president together with the inhabitants led the Americans to the North crossing Subaan River. After about a kilometer walk, the commander was delighted to see the broad, level land facing Subaan Bay with the hills of Balucanag at the rear and the flat land extending up to the banks of Subaan River.\n\nDuring a meeting with the local leaders, Melecio Apolinar, the \"Cabeza de Barangay\", Simplicio Castillo, Jacinto Jurado, Donato Arcon, and Felix Arguelles, Lt. Theodore Hutchins learned that the place was called \"Ylag\". Sgt. Teodoro Viray suggested that the new town be named \"San Teodoro\" in honor of U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt, the American President during that time who had the sovereign authority over the colonial Philippines. Adding the prefix ‘\"San\"’ in naming a place was customary during the Spanish period in honor of patron saints thus \"San Teodoro\".\n\nBecause the first names of Sgt. Viray and Lt. Hutchins were also \"Teodoros\", this led others to believe that the town was named after them, too. Teodoro Viray was a \"Macabebe\" and Theodore Hutchins ordered the burning of Subaan. Being authors of atrocities, the naming of San Teodoro could not be attributed to their infamous deeds.\n\nA temporary town planning was conceived to formalize the future town site. They fell down some trees and outlined 3 streets parallel to the shore. The new streets from the shore going inward were named after the owners of the lots: the Castillos, Arenillos and Jurados. The 3 streets parallel to the shoreline had undergone several name-change due to provincial politicking until they were officially identified as Juan Luna, J.P. Rizal and Mabini Streets. Some residents of Subaan were advised to move to the new site. Being related by blood, the leaders did not have a hard time on the distribution of the lots.\n\nThereafter, Melecio Apolinar was the designated president. The other officials were Simplicio Castillo, Jacinto Jurado, Aquilino Arenillo, Juan Rojas and Angel Aldaba. Subaan proper became a \"barrio\" of San Teodoro and was called \"Lumangbayan\", meaning “former poblacion”. Ilag is still used today to refer to a neighboring barangay north of Poblacion but it now extends up to the boundary with Puerto Galera near Bisay-an River.\n\nDuring that time, San Teodoro extends up to Pulang Tubig in the south (now part of Baco) up to Matala on the north (Km. 37) along the shores of Subaan Bay and Varadero Bay (now part of Puerto Galera), and to a limitless boundary on the west.\n\nThe new municipal government of San Teodoro was short lived. In 1903, together with Baco and Puerto Galera, San Teodoro was absorbed to become a \"barrio\" of Calapan as organized by the Philippine Commission headed by Gov. William H. Taft. In 1905, the new Philippine Commission Act No. 1280 decreed that the 15 municipalities of the entire island (Mindoro was divided into \"Oriental\" and \"Occidental\" only in 1950 by virtue of Republic Act No. 205) be reduced to eight. Abra de Ylog, formerly a part of Puerto Galera, was added to Mamburao together with Paluan.\n\nIn 1921, due to some political maneuvering, San Teodoro was annexed to Baco as its \"barrio\". Representative M.P. Leuterio lobbied that San Teodoro be incorporated with the newly reconstituted town of Baco, his hometown, in order to gain patronage from his constituents. He was supported by his ally, Gov. Juan Liboro. When their rivals, Juan Luces Luna and Arturo Ignacio were elected representative and governor respectively, they reversed the works of their predecessors.\n\nAct No. 3498 was passed by congress on December 8, 1928 declaring San Teodoro, Baco and Mansalay as separate municipalities. \"Our Lady of Immaculate Conception\" is the patron saint of San Teodoro whose feast day is celebrated every December 8. However, the official founding was held two months later on February 16, 1929 with Governor Arturo Ignacio and Congressman Juan Luces Luna officiating the ceremonies. The official observation and celebration of the founding of San Teodoro started on February 16, 1941 until today.\n\nA street was named after Congressman Juan Luna to show the town’s gratitude for his effort to make San Teodoro a sovereign municipality.\n\nIn 1903, there were only 302 residents in San Teodoro, the smallest among the settlements in the province and elsewhere in the country. There was a slight increase in population by 1918 (1,069 residents). Population doubled by 1939 with 2,911 residents. The density per sq. kilometer was less than 5 persons before 1918.\n\nIt was the gold rush in San Teodoro of that year that brought the influx of migrants from all over the country majority of which were \"Bicolanos\". San Teodoro became famous as No. 1 gold producer in the whole of Mindoro and became known as the logging center of the province. It once had the largest forest reserves supplying the country’s need for lumbers, the rest being exported to other places of the world. The \"Valbueco Inc.\" and \"Philippine Matchwood Co.\" employed many workers and planters in response to the reforestation program of the government. People from adjacent Batangas, Bauan and Isla Verde migrated to San Teodoro.\n\nOwing to the long Spanish rule, the people of San Teodoro were mostly Catholics. After 1920 some changes in religious dominance took place. The migration of Batangueños, most of whom were Aglipayans, caused the town to be multi-sectarian.\n\nIn the morning of December 9, 1920, the Parish Priest from Puerto Galera was not able to come ashore due to sudden change of weather condition and instead proceeded to Calapán. Pres. Melecio Apolinar instructed the intrepid sailors from Isla Verde to cross the sea and fetch a priest from Batangas. They brought with them an Aglipayan priest thus weddings and baptisms were all officiated by him. For almost three years, many were converted to Aglipayan, \"Salve\", Protestant, Adventist and Iglesia ni Cristo faiths.\n\nThe first Aglipayan Priest was Padre Klarín and the last was Padre Belén. After the Calapán–San Teodoro road was completed, the Catholic priest from Calapán took over and once again Catholicism dominated. In the 1950s, Mindoro’s religious landscape was prevailed over by the German SVDs. For 3 decades, San Teodoro had Germans for parish priests as in the rest of the province. The very first resident priest of this town was Fr. Herman Enninga SVD dubbed by the press as “guerilla priest”.\n\nThere was also a time when Mindoro had no parish priest. In 1898 when the Spaniards surrendered to the \"revolucionarios\", all Spanish nationals including priests were sent to a concentration camp in Luzón. The \"sacristán mayor\" of Calapán then administered the church rites himself.\n\nAfter the dissolution of the Philippine Commission and takeover of the senate, San Teodoro regained its township in 1919. Melecio Apolinar, who headed the town since 1902 as municipal president and as barrio captain from 1903 to 1919 when San Teodoro was under Calapan, was the best choice to take the helm of a municipal government. The officials during this short period of autonomy were Melecio Apolinar as President, Conrado Aldaba as Vice-President, Francisco Arenillo, Simplicio Castillo, Benigno Patulan, and Pedro Bae as Councilors. Pres. Apolinar enforced strict rules to the people. Although he allowed gambling, drinking and social gatherings on Saturdays and Sundays, he obliged the people to clear forest, plant coconuts, abaca, other crops and some fruit bearing trees, and enhanced commerce with other towns and ports.\n\nBlas Apolinar was elected as next president of the new town. He died within that year. His vice-president, Emilio Ponce, took over. During Pres. Emilio Ponce’s term, Saclag Settlement Farm School was established for the benefits of the ethnic minorities of San Teodoro, the Mangyans.\n\nOn October 16, 1931, Esperidion Dimaculangan took his oath as President. He was advised by his Councilor Gregorio Castillo for the establishment of a new municipal building but he declined. Instead he held his office in the old Municipal Building along Arenillo and Mabini Streets. The President being wealthy could afford an excellent representation for officials and private visitors so that the popularity of his administration spread far and wide. For having a daughter teacher and a principal teacher son-in-law, it was easy for him to convince school officials to open new schools and grades. President Dimaculangan, being a merchant and a farmer, exerted all his efforts to encourage the people to acquire lands, do farming and increase commerce with other ports. He was so busy in his entire administration, until the last day of his term on October l5, 1934.\n\nFrancisco Arenillo Sr. was elected and took control of the Municipal Government from October 16, 1934 to October 15, 1937. With many years of experience as a legislator, he was an executive with unchanging hatred to vices and laziness. He suppressed gambling and joblessness and was strict in carrying out the regular sessions of his council which got him hated by his councilors. He was generous enough to furnish a spacious yard for the \"Presidencia Building\". He achieved this by procuring the two adjoining lots at the center of the town by exchanging them with his own properties. He then donated them to the Municipal Government moving the Presidencia Building to the site. He transferred the Treasurer’s Office and the Post Office downstairs and a jail was provided. The transfer of the \"Presidencia Building\" at the head of Mabini Street changed the course of the Calapan–San Teodoro–Puerto Galera Road moving farther south of the town, causing the construction of an additional street at the expense of the Insular Government.\n\nPresident Francisco Arenillo Sr. was a determined President. During the joint session of the Municipal Councils of San Teodoro and Baco on matters of boundary dispute, he challenged every opponent to anything should the decision be unfair. He created disorder when the old boundaries were not followed. The members of his council were Eulalio Ramos as Vice-President, Meliton Aldaba, Ceferino Flores, Antero Paglinawan and Emilio Ponce as Councilors. Vice-President Eulalio Ramos died on the later part of April, 1936, Councilor Ceferino Flores took his place and Casiano Evangelista was appointed Councilor. Pres. Arenillo Sr. purchased the market site with his own money and collected from the government later.\n\nExequiel Fernandez became President on October 16, 1937, with Emilio Ponce as his Vice-President, Meliton Aldaba, Mariano Añonuevo, Ceferino Flores, and Isidro Llave as Councilors. President Arenillo’s project of the construction of the public market was pushed through. The market was completed but gave no income to the Municipal Treasury. Young President Exequiel Fernandez took an active part in the organization of the Commonwealth Government against the opinions of his councilors. When the transitory Commonwealth Government was established, Manuel L. Quezon was elected president. The title \"Municipal President\" was changed to \"Municipal Mayor\" making Exequiel Fernandez the last municipal president and the first municipal mayor. His term was extended two and a half months and ended on December 31, 1940.\n\nThe most eventful elective term in the history of San Teodoro was that of Tomas Mendoza who assumed office as Municipal Mayor from January 1, 1941 up to December 31, 1947. His seven-year term of office was without interruption through peace and war: Japanese occupation, guerilla organization, American Liberation, and Philippine reorganization and reconstruction. He was supported by Vice Mayor Domingo Alisna and councilors Gregorio Cubos, Jose Patulan, Delfin Magpantay, and Epitacio Apolinar.\n\nAfter the first conference of Municipal and Provincial Officials in January, 1941, Mayor Mendoza got the support of Raul Eleuterio for the construction of Home Economics building for San Teodoro. An indefinite quantity of asphalt was also granted for asphalting the National Road from Poblacion towards Calapan. With the home economics building completed and road asphalting started, Mayor Mendoza secured the cooperation of the school authorities under the supervisor teacher Luis Raymundo to conduct and maintain the general cleanliness of the whole town and the vicinities next. All yards were fenced, heads of the streets were kept open, seashores were raked, and garbage disposed.\n\nThe official observation and celebration of the founding of San Teodoro was activated on February 16, 1941, 12 years after its creation. Different barrios and schools headed by councilors and teachers were represented in the parade. Academic and athletic contest as well as social programs were held. Supervising teacher Luis Raymundo and Principal teacher Josefa Casanas were very important factors in every public activities of Mayor Tomas Mendoza as the two of them were an ever rolling spirit in school activities.\n\nThe town \"fiesta\" of San Teodoro, December 8 that year, fall on Sunday. Mayor Mendoza advanced it a day and held it on Saturday, December 7, 1941. While fireworks and firecrackers were setting off that night at the festival's pageant coronation program, Japan was bombing Clark Airbase, Nichols Airbase, Manila, Baguio, Davao, and other places shortly after Pearl Harbor starting the Pacific War. On Sunday morning, December 8, 1941 the people of San Teodoro were awakened by the news of the war. Rushing to Calapan to confer with Governor Felipe Abeleda and Major Ramon Ruffi, Mayor Mendoza, Manuel Caeg, and some soldiers were told to organize volunteer guards. Every Councilor was recognized as Lieutenants heading a company. Councilors Epitacio Apolinar and Antero Roxas were recalled by the Army. Delfin Magpantay, murdered by unknown persons, was substituted by Vicente Atienza for Tacligan. Chief of Police Angel Ramirez, by the order of Major Ruffi was relieved successively by Gregorio Saldaña, Lazaro Amparo, and Emilio Ponce.\n\nThe Japanese Imperial Forces landed at Calapan and Puerto Galera on February 27, 1942 after the Fall of Manila. Mindoro fell into the hands of the Japanese without much resistance. The Mayor instructed Secretary Jovencio Ponce and Sanitary Inspector Francisco Fernandez to meet the Japanese and get their intentions. The mayor busied himself visiting the people in different hiding places. After the meeting at Pagsiiran, at the advice of Ex-Governor Liboro, the root of resistance was organized at Nagpatay. Benedicto Arias, Emilio Ponce, Eutequio Caeg, Dominador Caeg, Modesto Calinawan, Leoncio Atienza, and Mariano Bañares formed the local guerrilla organization. Supervising teacher Luis Raymundo was forced to suspend all classes at elementary school.\n\nOn March 8, 1942, Mayor Mendoza walked all the way through Calapan with his most trusted lieutenant, A. dela Cruz of Lumangbayan. He met Governor Abeleda and the Japanese Commander for Mindoro and accepted the designation as Mayor of San Teodoro. Then, he had a meeting with old Manuel Caeg at Santa Rosa. The underground movement of San Teodoro was formally organized on March 10, 1942 designating Sgt. Epitacio Apolinar as head and Old Manuel Caeg as Adviser. Mayor Mendoza remained Chief Executive and Head of Intelligence and Supply Groups. Lauriano Aparato, Alvin dela Cruz, and Ramon Bae joined later. After a meeting with Philippine Constabulary Sgt. Vicente Garachico and Mauro Magpili at Pakala, Tacligan, the resistant organization was greatly strengthened.\n\nWhen the Japanese ordered the opening of schools, Mayor Mendoza, with supervising-teacher Luis Raymundo, exerted his efforts and obliged the teachers to open complete elementary grades in Central School and primary grades in all \"barrios\". Both of them, being guerillas in the intelligence and supply group, convinced the teachers and students that it was a pretext to show peace and order to the Japanese. The schools run well for two successive years bringing graduates in elementary grades. Whenever the Japanese officials visited San Teodoro, Mayor Mendoza and Supervisor teacher Luis Raymundo were proud to show them that there was really peace and order in San Teodoro.\n\nOn January 2, 1943, some Filipino escorts of the Japanese, including Vidal Ilagan who came from Bauan, Batangas, were killed by the guerillas headed by Sgt. Vic Evora at San Rafael bridge. The Japanese soldiers seized Diosdado Peña, Laureano Aparato, Fructuoso Villareal, and Cipriano Guttierez in the old cockpit arena in Lumangbayan together with Leonora Sanchez and the Mayor. They were imprisoned at the Japanese garrison in Calapan for several days. They were sentenced to die by firing squad. Through the intercession of Governor Abeleda, they were set free. Leonora Sanchez was kept for several months to be set free in the condition of the capture of the guerillas in San Teodoro.\n\nOn March 22, 1944, Lt. Fernando Juerto, Antonio Zamora, and San Teodoro guerillas attacked the Japanese soldiers stationed at the house of Cirilo Medina resulting the killing of 5 Japanese and the wounding of 2 guerillas and Edelwina Cruz, the granddaughter of Capt. Dodson, by grenade shrapnel. After two hours of battle, the surviving Japanese soldiers rode their swift boats to Lumangbayan. The following day, the Japanese soldiers stationed in Lumangbayan scoured the vicinities of Tibag and Capipi. After a fruitless search for guerillas in Pawikan, the Japanese soldiers returned to Lumangbayan where they were met again by another group of guerillas in the early night. The encounter enraged the Japanese more and they burned Lumangbayan which last until morning.\n\nAmerican forces led by General Douglas MacArthur with the Filipino soldiers started the invasion of Mindoro on December 15, 1944 in San Jose (the Battle of Mindoro). After the New Year's Day of 1945, guerillas from San Teodoro and Calapan met in Naujan. The combined forces headed by Guerilla Ex-Governor Juan Navarro, together with Alfonso Umali Sr., Major Ruffi and Captain William Dodson, attacked the Japanese garrison (now Gov. Alfonso Umali Memorial High School) liberating Calapan. Captain Dodson with Lt. Maximo Feraren and his platoon, guerillas and some American soldiers, engaged the enemy in the \"Battle of Longos\" which drove the Japanese to the forest of Baco.\n\nOn early March of same year, Mayor Mendoza with about 500 Filipino guerillas from San Teodoro, some of whom were escapees from war camps in Mamburao and Abra de Ilog, reinforced the 300 Americans fresh from Okinawa under the command of Major Brown and Capt. Dodson. They were engaged in the final battle in the Valley of Karayrayan, Baco. After 9 days of fighting, all the Japanese forces were completely crushed.\n\nIn July 1946, few days after the signing of the Treaty of Manila, Mayor Mendoza and some of San Teodoro prominent men held a meeting for the establishment of a secondary school in the town. After so many consultations and preparations, an assembly of interested persons was held at the Municipal Building on the Labor Day of 1947. \"Northern Mindoro Academy, Inc\" was created. The mayor was elected President being one of the main stockholders of the newly established secondary school. The first teachers for Northern Mindoro Academy were the Spouses Severino and Josefa Araullo, Marianito Rivera, Paz Esguerra, Isabel Paradero and the Mayor himself.\n\nMelanio Tuason Sr. was the mayor of this town from 1948 to 1951 with Antero Roxas as his vice mayor. During his time, fishing and logging were the primary sources of livelihood and revenues for the municipal government. Small scale mining sometime brought fortunes to the few lucky prospectors. \n\nThe deed of exchange and selling of the old Presidencia Building and site were concluded by Ex-Mayor Mendoza and the Municipal Government of San Teodoro. The Office of the Municipal Government was transferred temporarily to the Public Dispensary building. Calsapa and Bisay-an were provided elementary schools. Unfortunately the buildings were blown down by a super typhoon.\n\nFaustino Aldaba succeeded Melanio Tuason Sr. in 1952. Antero Roxas continued acting as vice mayor. Mayor Aldaba was named the \"Governor of the Mangyans\". He initiated the mass titling of most of the lots in San Teodoro to generate more revenues for the government. Exportation of logs continued but the pestilence of abaca, swine, and other livestocks occurred in his time.\nMaximo Feraren was elected in 1956. He initiated the construction of the new Municipal Building located at its present site. The arrivals of many families from other towns and provinces increased the agricultural activities locally. The extensive campaign for payment of tax obligation gave the Municipality a good income through the indefatigable works of Assessor Carlos Mendoza and Treasurer Benjamin Garcia. Treas. Garcia was responsible for the construction of the present public market through his appeals in the print media. The Mayor donated a portion of his own property for the site of Bisay-an Elementary School. Roads were asphalted and many other infrastructure projects were initiated by Mayor Feraren, until his term of office ends in 1964.\n\nMelanio Tuason Jr. assumed office in 1964 with Tomas Arcon as his vice mayor. He initiated the release of some forest zones into “alienable and disposable” by the then DANR office. Proper utilization and conservation of marine resources within the municipal fishing territory was strictly enforced by Police Chief Vicente Garachico Jr. for the great benefit of subsistence fishermen.\n\nIn 1968, Primitivo Atayde and Vicente Roxas as his vice took their oath of office. The Mayor initiated the concrete fencing of the town plaza. His diligence in asking support funds from higher agencies of the provincial and national government resulted in the installation of the water system and the \"Sanduguan\" medical mission of the town. During a meeting with other mayors over the old boundary dispute, he was overzealous in emphasizing the San Teodoro claim over several territories. He initiated other infrastructure projects in his term. He lost to Melanio Tuason Jr. in the 1972 election.\n\nDuring Martial Law, after its declaration on September 21, 1972, Mayor Melanio Tuason Jr. continued as the Mayor of San Teodoro. He had Deogracias Añonuevo as his vice mayor. Elections were suspended during the early part of martial rule. The tenure of all public officials were extended.\n\nThe first local election ever held during martial law was in 1980. Claro Patulan won as mayor and his young teammate Antonio Roxas as vice mayor. Mayor Patulan initiated the construction of the Multi-Purpose Building and the concreting of some municipal streets.\n\nIn 1978, the cadastral surveys of San Teodoro and Puerto Galera for tax mapping purposes was executed resulting to the establishment of new political boundaries. San Teodoro lost Barangay Bisay-an to Puerto Galera due to Martial Law politics.\n\nBarangay Bisay-an is now Barangay Villaflor, Puerto Galera which is being disputed by San Teodoro.\n\nThe assassination of Senator Benigno Aquino Jr. in 1983 brought nationwide discontentment culminating in EDSA Revolution causing abrupt termination of incumbent government elected officials. In 1986 the new Philippine president, Corazon Aquino, appointed Officer-In-Charge (OIC) mayors to replace the incumbents. Antonio Chua was appointed as OIC with Albert Gutierrez as Vice-OIC. On December 9, 1987 the two officials were replaced by Leonardo Ramos and Isabel Aldaba respectively.\n\nAntonio Chua and Romulo Flores won the election in 1988 and serve until 1994. Projects they completed are the construction of the Multi-Purpose Building named Claro A. Patulan Memorial Multi-Purpose Center, the construction of the irrigation system of Bigaan, the construction of the Paspasin Elementary School, and the asphalting of the municipal and national road from Poblacion towards Barangay Ilag. The Municipal Health Center was constructed during their tenure. An approved resolution by the Chua administration brought about the establishment of San Teodoro National High School.\n\nIn 1995, retired military Major Oscar Aldaba was elected mayor of San Teodoro. He renovated the present Municipal Building and transferred the Police Station adjacent to the Multi-Purpose Center. He initiated the construction of the Bureau of Jail Management and Penology building. Under his term, he upholds discipline and promotes the clean and green movement. His diligence to obtain public funds from higher government agencies resulted in the granting of heavy equipments to the municipality and the concreting of municipal and part of national road in San Teodoro during the time of Governor Rodolfo G. Valencia. It was during his term when the Chief of Police of San Teodoro, Leodegario Torno was murdered along the National Road in Lumangbayan allegedly by members of the communist New People's Army (NPA).\n\nOscar Aldaba was re-elected for the second term in the 1998 election. He was assassinated at the Catholic Church premises on February 6, 2000. Vice Mayor Manuel Bae succeeded the slain mayor. Councilor Number one Lourdes Alisna was promoted to Vice Mayor and Francisco Marinduque was appointed Councilor.\n\nDuring the 2001 election, Manuel Bae and Malvin Diokno won as mayor and vice mayor respectively. Seven months later the newly wed vice mayor died with Lourdes Alisna taking over. This administration initiated the construction of some infrastructure projects such as basketball courts, concreting of the national road, and the construction of the perimeter fence around San Teodoro National High School. Funds were secured from the provincial government for the repairs of existing municipal and barangay roads. The Municipal Multi-purpose Covered Court and the Pakala Farm-to-Market road were the last government projects that were completed by this administration.\n\nThe following presidents and mayors have presided over San Teodoro:\n\n"}

{"id": "2171962", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2171962", "title": "First Battle of Mesilla", "text": "First Battle of Mesilla\n\nThe First Battle of Mesilla, was fought on July 25, 1861 at Mesilla in New Mexico Territory, in present-day Doña Ana County, New Mexico.\n\nIt was an engagement between Confederate and Union forces during the American Civil War. The battle resulted in a Confederate victory and led directly to the official establishing of a Confederate Arizona Territory, consisting of the southern portion of the New Mexico Territory. The victory paved the way for the Confederate New Mexico Campaign the following year.\n\nFollowing the secession of Texas in February 1861 and its joining the Confederacy, a battalion of the 2nd Texas Mounted Rifles under Lieutenant Colonel John R. Baylor was sent to occupy the series of forts along the western Texas frontier which had been abandoned by the Union Army. Baylor's orders from the Department of Texas commander, Colonel Earl Van Dorn, allowed him to advance into New Mexico in order to attack the Union forts along the Rio Grande if he thought the situation called for such measures. Convinced that the Union force at Fort Fillmore would soon attack, Baylor decided to take the initiative and launch an attack of his own.\n\nLeaving during the night of July 23, Baylor arrived in Mesilla the next night, preparing to launch a surprise attack the next morning. However, a Confederate deserter informed the fort's commander, Major Isaac Lynde, of the plans. The next day, Baylor led his battalion across the Rio Grande into Mesilla, to the cheers of the population. A company of Arizona Confederates joined Baylor here, and were convinced to muster into the Confederate Army.\n\nOn July 25, leaving a small force behind to guard the fort, Lynde led 380 Regulars to the village to drive out Baylor.\n\nLynde approached the town with his command and demanded Baylor's surrender. When Baylor refused, Lynde deployed his men into a skirmish line and opened fire with his mountain howitzers. The infantry was ordered to advance but heavy sand and corn fields interfered with this attack. Lynde then ordered his cavalry, three companies of the Regiment of Mounted Rifles, to charge Baylor's men.\n\nThe Confederates shot many of the Union soldiers during this time, which disorganized the attack. The Union assault was repulsed, and both sides began skirmishing at long range. Lynde reformed his command but decided to retreat back to the fort, with the Confederates troops and armed Arizona citizens in pursuit. Lynde lost a disputed three to thirteen men killed and two officers and four men wounded, while Baylor lost a disputed two dead and seven seriously wounded with twenty horses killed.\n\nAt sunset the next day, Baylor ordered his artillery and more cavalry to reinforce him, while the rest of his command moved into position to attack the fort the next day. During the same night, the Confederates captured 85 of the fort's horses, which formed most of the fort's transportation. Fearing an attack the next day, Lynde abandoned Fort Fillmore after destroying the ammunition and supplies in the citadel. He retreated northeast towards Fort Stanton across the dry Organ Mountains via San Augustin Pass. Many Union troops apparently had filled their canteens with the fort's medicinal whiskey instead of water, hardly wise for a summertime march across desert country.\n\nDuring the pursuit the following day, the Confederates were able to capture dozens of straggling Federals. Lynde's dehydrated command, reduced to 100 men by this time, was overtaken by the Confederates, some of whom used a pass (later known as Baylor Pass) to intercept them. They were forced to surrender at San Augustine Springs on July 27. The prisoners were paroled, and Baylor concentrated his battalion at the fort. He was able to refit his command with the captured Springfield rifles and other captured equipment.\n\nThe Confederate victory at Mesilla actualized local overtures towards secession, which had been ratified by two conventions in March 1861. On August 1 Baylor declared the establishment of an organized Confederate Arizona Territory, consisting of the portion of the New Mexico Territory south of the 34th parallel north. Baylor installed himself as the new territory's military governor, and declared martial law. Baylor's success at Mesilla led to Henry Hopkins Sibley's ambitious New Mexico Campaign the following February.\n\nOn 25 November 1861 Major Lynde was, by direction of the President of the United States, dropped from the Army rolls for \"\"abandoning his post — Fort Fillmore, N. Mex. — on the 27th of July, 1861, and subsequently surrendering his command to an inferior force of insurgents\"\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2171964", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2171964", "title": "Australian snubfin dolphin", "text": "Australian snubfin dolphin\n\nThe Australian snubfin dolphin (\"Orcaella heinsohni\") is a dolphin found off the northern coasts of Australia. It closely resembles the Irrawaddy dolphin (of the same genus, \"Orcaella\") and was not described as a separate species until 2005. The closest relative to the genus \"Orcaella\" is the killer whale, \"Orcinus orca\". The Australian snubfin has three colors on its skin, while the Irrawaddy dolphin only has two. The skull and the fins also show minor differences between the two species.\n\nThe taxonomic specific name, \"heinsohni\", was chosen in honor of George Heinsohn, an Australian biologist who worked at James Cook University, \"for his pioneering work on northeast Australian odontocetes, including the collection and initial analysis of \"Orcaella heinsohni\" specimens which form the basis for much of our knowledge of the new species\".\n\nNew species of large mammals are quite rarely described nowadays, and those that are usually are from remote areas — such as the saola - or are otherwise rarely encountered, see for example Perrin's beaked whale, or the spade-toothed whale, which is only known from two complete specimens and a few bones cast ashore. In fact, the Australian snubfin was the first new dolphin species to be described in 56 years, but was followed, in 2011, by the discovery and description of the Burrunan dolphin (\"T. australis\"), also from the Australian continent. The Australian snubfin dolphin is unusual among recently described mammals in that a population is accessible for scientific study.\n\nNonetheless, the existence of snubfin dolphins in the waters of northern Australia had only become known in 1948, when a skull was found at Melville Bay (Gove Peninsula, Northern Territory). This individual apparently had been caught and eaten by aboriginals. However, the discovery remained unnoted until discussed by Johnson (1964), and soon thereafter a Dutch skipper had his observations of the then-unrecognized species published. The common name “snubfin dolphin” was suggested in 1981 and highlights a diagnostic external character and has previously been used in field guides for identification.\n\nTwo scientists, Isabel Beasley of James Cook University and Peter Arnold of Museum of Tropical Queensland, took DNA samples from the population of dolphins off the coast of Townsville, Queensland, and sent them to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Southwest Fisheries Science Center in La Jolla, California. The results showed George Heinsohn was correct in his hypothesis that the Townsville population was a new species.\n\nThe holotype QM JM4721 (JUCU MM61) is the skull and some other bones of an adult male found drowned in a shark net at Horseshoe Bay, Queensland, on 21 April 1972. It was about 11 years old at the time of its death.\n\nA species of delphinid in the genus, \"Orcaella\", which contains one other species, the Irrawaddy dolphin \"Orcaella brevirostris\", \"O. heinsohni\" females can reach lengths of and males can reach . Australian snubfin dolphins are subtly tricoloured: brownish on the top, lighter brown along the sides, and a white belly; the Irrawaddy dolphin, on the other hand, is uniformly slate grey except for the white belly. The new species has a rounded forehead, very unlike other dolphin species in Australia, and the very small, \"snubby\" dorsal fin distinguishes it from other dolphins in its range. The lack of a groove on each side of the back and the presence of a neck crease further distinguishes this species from its relative. Tail flukes also have an identifiable jagged trailing edge that can help distinguish it from other species of delphinids.\n\nThe number of nasal bones in each side of a snub fin dolphin's skull vertex varies from none to six. There is a poorly developed mesthemoid plate. In the upper jaw there are roughly 11–22 teeth in each half, and in the lower jaw there are roughly 14–19 teeth in each half.\n\nIn a study of Australian snubfin dolphins consisting of 18 individuals, it was determined the approximate life span is around 30 years. However, since sightings are so rare, a lot remains unknown about many about this species. Gestation is estimated to be around 11 months based off rates of similar species.\n\nMuch remains unknown about the ecology and behaviors of the Australian snubfin dolphin. Australian snubfin dolphins have a varied diet, eating a range of fish, shrimp and cephalopods (squid, cuttlefish and octopus). They are found in small groups of about 2–6, but larger groups (up to 14 individuals) have also been observed. Populations are usually smaller than 150 individuals. Some instances long-term sociability has been observed among individuals off the coast of Queensland, Australia. Grouping associations seem to be strongest among male individuals implying some potential correlation to reproductive strategy. Additionally, there was an observation of snubfin dolphins displaying mating courtship between Australian humpback dolphins.\n\nBoth the Australian snubfin dolphin and the Australian humpback dolphin co-occur throughout much of the tropical Northern waters of Australia, and have similar vocal repertoires consisting of click trains, burst pulses, and whistles. As a member of the suborder odontoceti, much of these vocalizations are thought to be associated with echolocation for both navigation and foraging. They produce clicks of short durations with high peaks, making their clicks distinguishable from other odontocetes.\n\nSnub fin dolphins have also been observed interacting with Australian humpback dolphins, and one case of a hybrid between the two species was documented using DNA analysis in 2014.\n\nAustralian snubfin dolphins have been observed to spit jets of water across the surface of the water as a potential feeding strategy. Jets of water appear to cause fish to leap from the water towards the dolphin, making them easier prey targets.\n\nOff the coast of Queensland, Australia, the Australian snubfin dolphin predominantly feeds in coastal-estuarine waters. There is a predominance of feeding activity by rivers and areas off the coast of Cleveland bay. Australian snubfin dolphins have also been seen foraging and then following passing by fish trawlers to capitalize on an opportunity for prey. They can be classified as opportunistic feeders and have been seen congregating to feed in groups. Being opportunistic feeders snubfins consume a large array of prey items. Snubfin dolphin consume a wide array of prey, that can be narrowed down to coastal, estuarine, and reef‐associated fishes throughout the water column and at the bottom. The most common prey items by specie are cardinal fish (\"Apogon\"), proceeded by the cuttlefish (\"Sepia\"), the squid Uroteuthis (\"Photololigo\"), and the toothpony fish (\"Gazza\"). Another big part of the snubfin diet are cephalopods.\n\nThe snubfin dolphin is considered endemic to Australia. In the Pacific Ocean off Townsville, about 200 individual snubfin dolphins were found. The range of the species is expected to extend to Papua New Guinea; that is, \"O. heinsohni\" is endemic to the northern half of the Sahul Shelf, but the majority live in Australian waters. They are found all along the northern coasts of Australia, from Broome, Western Australia, to the Brisbane River in Southeast Queensland. They are not thought to be common, and are being given a high conservation priority. Australian snubfin dolphins are currently listed as “vulnerable” by the IUCN.\n\nHabitat range has primarily been determined through visual sightings and stranding data, limiting the range to areas accessible by humans. Pacific acoustic monitoring methods are being deployed to attempt to more accurately determine the range of these animals by listening for their distinctive echolocation clicks.\n\nAlthough some hunting by indigenous people occurs (as evidenced by the 1948 specimen), this is likely to be insignificant compared to other threats such as drowning in sharknets and fishing gear. Snubfins are particularly at risk from incidental capture in gillnets, which are often placed in near-shore areas and near the mouths of rivers, where these dolphins are more likely to be found. Although it is not known how many dolphins die in this manner, it is considered to be the greatest threat to populations in Papua New Guinea. Anti-shark nets and drumlines put in place for Queensland's shark control program are also a significant threat to snubfins, with about 1.8 snubfin dolphins killed every year between 1997 and 2011.\nThe coastal zones along the Australian snubfin dolphin's range have been highly modified for mining and agricultural purposes as well as ports, aquaculture and residential development. Land reclamation, vessel traffic and construction results in the degradation of the snubfin's natural habitat through increased noise, lower water quality and a reduction in food supply, in addition to direct loss of habitat areas due to land reclamation. This can result in decreased survival rates and/or emigration in search of better resources.\n\nPollution is another threat to snubfin dolphins, as the water discharge from rivers in the dolphins’ Australian range are contaminated by industrial and agricultural runoff. The snubfin dolphins’ strong site fidelity means they are likely exposed to pollutants on a daily basis. Indeed, one study of snubfins on the Great Barrier Reef found levels of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) far exceeding the thresholds for small cetaceans, over which reproductive anomalies and immunosuppression can occur.\nPeriodic floods present a temporary threat to snubfin dolphins in that they result in an increase in freshwater discharge, heavy metals, nutrients, sediment and pesticides in coastal areas. Increases in floods, cyclone severity, storm surges and sea surface temperatures due to climate change will likely also affect the habitat and future food supply of snubfin dolphins.\nAs a result of the cumulative effects of drowning as bycatch and habitat loss and degradation, the Australian snubfin dolphin population is believed to be decreasing and is likely to meet the criteria for IUCN's “endangered” status in the near future.\n\nAs small populations are more vulnerable to extinction due to the small numbers and low genetic diversity, the snubfin dolphin is at significant risk in their human populated habitat. The insufficient data on the species poses additional threat as their general ecology is not fully understood.\n\nThe Australian snubfin dolphin is listed on Appendix II of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS). It is listed on Appendix II as it has an unfavourable conservation status or would benefit significantly from international co-operation organised by tailored agreements.\n\nAustralian snubfin dolphins are also listed as “vulnerable” by the IUCN.\n\nIn addition, Australian snubfin dolphins are covered by Memorandum of Understanding for the Conservation of Cetaceans and Their Habitats in the Pacific Islands Region (Pacific Cetaceans MOU).\n\n"}

Jenkins, 515 U.S. 70 (1995), is a case decided by the United States Supreme Court. On June 12, 1995 the Court, in a 5-4 decision, overturned a District Court ruling that required the state of Missouri to correct \"de facto\" racial inequality in schools by funding salary increases and remedial education programs.\n\nThe case began in 1977 l, when the Kansas City, Missouri School District (KCMSD) sued the State of Missouri, federal agencies, and suburban districts around Kansas City on behalf of the district's students. The District Court then instead named the school district as a defendant. The courts held that the state of Missouri was liable for segregated schools within the boundaries of KCMSD. Originally, the school district wanted a \"metropolitan plan,\" which would have included bus transfers to even out the racial inequalities of inner-city and suburban schools. However, over the 18-year span of the case, the court ordered remedies that were focused instead on improving educational facilities and programs.\n\nIn 1985, US District Court Judge Russell Clark ordered the legal remedy of educational improvement programs, school facility repairs, and magnet schools, which were thought to be the best way to attract white suburban students back into city schools. In 1987, the district courts ordered mandatory salary assistance, arguing that to end segregation in the schools the district needed higher-paid, quality teachers. In 1993, the district court ordered the state to pay for salary increases for teaching and non-teaching personnel.\n\nThe Supreme Court majority interpreted \"Brown v. Board of Education\" as restricting only \"de jure\" segregation, and it referred to \"Milliken v. Bradley\" and other precedents as applying only to intra-district desegregation. The Supreme Court argued that the lower courts had exceeded their authority in ordering measures such as across-the-board state-funded salary increases in order to fund continued quality education programs, which could not be sustained by local government.\n\nThe Court looked to \"Board of Education of Oklahoma City Public Schools v. Dowell\" for the decisive question of \"'whether the [constitutional violator] ha[s] complied in good faith with the desegregation decree since it was entered, and whether the vestiges of past discrimination ha[ve] been eliminated to the extent practicable.'\"\n\nAccording to \"The Living Constitution\", 3rd Revised Edition (Saul K. Padover, Revised by Jacob W. Landynski, 1995), the other issue involved was whether a federal court could order a local government to raise taxes above the state statute amount to cover the cost of removing the \"vestiges of discrimination.\" The Supreme Court ruled that while direct imposition of taxes is indeed beyond judicial authority, it would be permissible for the district court to order the school district to levy the same tax: \"Authorizing and directing local government institutions to devise and implement remedies not only protects the function of these institutions but, to the extent possible, also places the responsibility for solutions to the problems of segregation upon those themselves who have created the problem.\"\n\nThe Court also said: \"To hold otherwise would fail to take account of the obligations of local governments, under the Supremacy Clause, to fulfill the requirements that the Constitution imposes upon them.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "2171998", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2171998", "title": "Repartimiento", "text": "Repartimiento\n\nThe Repartimiento () (Spanish, \"distribution, partition, or division\") was a colonial forced labor system imposed upon the indigenous population of Spanish America and the Philippines. In concept it was similar to other tribute-labor systems, such as the \"mita\" of the Inca Empire or the corvée of Ancien Régime France: the natives were forced to do low-paid or unpaid labor for a certain number of weeks or months each year on Spanish-owned farms, mines, workshops (\"obrajes\"), and public projects. With the New Laws of 1542, the \"repartimiento\" was instated to substitute the \"encomienda\" system that had come to be seen as abusive and promoting unethical behavior. The \"repartimiento\" was not slavery, in that the worker is not owned outright—being free in various respects other than in the dispensation of his or her labor—and the work was intermittent. However, it created slavery-like conditions in certain areas, most notoriously in silver mines of 16th century Peru. In the first decades of the colonization of the Caribbean the word was used for the institution that became the \"encomienda\", which can cause confusion. It was a way for people to pay tribute by doing laborious jobs for the mother country. \n\nThe \"repartimiento\", for the most part, replaced the \"encomienda\" throughout the Viceroyalty of New Spain by the beginning of the 17th century. In Peru \"encomiendas\" lasted longer, and the Quechua word \"mita\" frequently was used for \"repartimiento\". There were instances when both systems (\"repartimiento\" and \"encomienda\") coexisted.\n\nIn practice, a conquistador, or later a Spanish settler or official, would be given and supervised a number of indigenous workers, who would labor in farms or mines, or in the case of the Philippines might also be assigned to the ship yards constructing the Manila galleons. The one in charge of doing the \"reparto\" (\"distribution\") of workers was the \"Alcalde Mayor\" (local magistrate) of the city. Native communities that were close to Spanish populations were required to provide a percentage of their people (2-4%) to work in agriculture, construction of houses, streets, etc. The diminution of the number of natives in the Americas due to European diseases (smallpox, influenza, measles and typhus) to which the native populations had no resistance, as well as to desertion from the work fields, led to the substitution of the \"encomienda\" system and the creation of privately owned farms and haciendas. Many native people escaped the \"encomienda\" and \"repartimiento\" by leaving their communities. Some looked for wage labor; others signed contracts (\"asientos\") for six months to a year, during which time the worker was required to be paid a salary (something the Spanish Crown did not enforce or support), and provided living quarters as well as religious services. There were many cases in which both wage and \"repartimiento\" laborers worked side-by-side on farms, mines, \"obrajes\" or haciendas.\n\n\n"}

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nThe town is being pushed to be included in the UNESCO World Heritage List due to its impressive array of colonial structures with hints of indigenous Mindanaoan architecture.\n\nBalingasag is politically subdivided into 30 barangays.\n\nBalingasag started as a pre-Hispanic settlement, which was eventually discovered by the Spaniards when they came to colonize the Philippines. Presumably, the name came from two contracted Cebuano words \"baling\", which means fishing net, and \"kasag\", crab.\n\nLegend has it that one day during the Spanish regime a group of guardia civil, while patrolling the seashore near the settlement of the natives, chanced upon some fishermen pulling fishing nets. A guardia civil asked a fisherman for the name of the place. Not understanding the language and thinking that he was asked what he what was doing, the fisherman, pointing his finger to the net, answered “baling”, and then turning it to the contents of the boat nearby, added “kasag”.\n\nAccording to early accounts, the present town site of Balingasag was heavily forested, making it the favorite hiding place of bandits and pirates, who constantly terrorized the inhabitants. One of the notorious groups marauding the area was that of Datu Gumpot, who made the area now occupied by Cala-cala, a sitio of Barangay Cogon, as his base. This place was then known as Gumpot Kitagtag. The presence of these lawless elements in the area made the inhabitants evacuate to safer places every now and then.\n\nGumpot’s group later on disappeared and never came back. This motivated the natives to settle. One group, however, moved to Galas, a part of the place known as Sabangan, an area somewhere between what is now Barangay Waterfall and Barangay Baliwagan. The other group remained at Gumpot Kitagtag.\n\nGalas was ruled by Datu Marcos and his wife, Ba’ai Gregoria. On the other hand, Gumpot Kitagtag was under Datu Mateo and his wife Ba’ai Tomasa. Though these rulers now had their own territory, they remained true and loyal to each other. Marriages between the members of these two tribes further strengthened the bond that had since bound the two leaders. Notable of these conjugal unions was that of Marcos Antonio, the son of Datu Marcos, and Rita Gregoria, the daughter of Datu Mateo.\n\nEventually, these two great leaders died and were succeeded by their sons. Marcos Antonio became the Datu of Galas and Manuel Mateo ruled Gumpot Kitagtag. These new leaders maintained the alliance established by their predecessors. They constantly communicated with each other and discussed means, or undertook activities, to improve their settlements.\n\nIn one of their meetings, the idea of establishing a common place, where the members of their tribes could meet and conduct commercial or social activities, was developed. The two rulers, together with their respective followers, presented their choices. Finally, they decided to locate their meeting place or “poblacion” diha tungod nianang balinganan ta sa kasag (in the place where we catch crabs). This place was part of Galas.\n\nThe “poblacion” grew and became popular. In 1749, the Spanish Authority recognized the place and the whole territory of Sabangan under the name Balingasag. Thus, Sabangan could be considered as the old Balingasag.\n\nIn 1790, a great flood swept Sabangan, leaving the inhabitants nothing but desolation and depression. After the flood, the leader of Galas this time, Datu Antonio Ramon, the son of Datu Marcos Antonio, proposed to his followers the notion of transferring their settlement to a safer place. The inhabitants loved their place so much that they disagreed with the idea of their chieftain. In the end, however, the leader prevailed upon the followers.\n\nDatu Antonio Ramon and his followers eyed Gumpot Kitagtag, now under the control of Datu Mamerto Manuel, the son and successor of Datu Manuel Mateo, as the ideal place to relocate. Negotiations ensued. After the conditions were agreed by both parties, the transfer began sometime in 1793 and was completed in 1810.\n\nOne of the important agreements between the two groups was to divide the poblacion into two. The present Rizal Street, then called Calle Real, which now traverses the span between the gate of Balingasag Central School and the town’s wharf, became the demarcation line. All lots on the right side of this street, when facing mountain, and all agricultural lands as far as Baliwagan, would belong to Datu Antonio Ramon and his followers. To Datu Mamerto Manuel and his followers went all the lots on the opposite side of the poblacion and all the agricultural lands as far as Mandangoa. Governor General Narciso Claveria issued on 21 November 1841 a decree (Renovacion de Apellidos) requiring the natives to change their family names and if they had none, they have to adopt a new one. Consequently, Datu Mamerto Manuel chose “Valmores” as his surname, while Datu Antonio Ramon opted for “Madroño”.\n\nBalingasag, being the name recognized by the Spanish Authority, gradually replaced the name of the territory that was Gumpot Kitagtag. In 1842, Balingasag was finally given official recognition as a town through a Spanish Royal Decree. If this royal decree were the basis of the existence of the present Balingasag, Mamerto Manuel Valmores and Antonio Ramon Madroño would then be considered as the “Founding Patriarchs” of this municipality.\n\nThe royal recognition of Balingasag as a political or administrative entity under the Spanish sovereignty engendered new systems and structures of governance, which supplanted the indigenous ways of running community affairs. This time the head of the community was the gobernadorcillo, which bore the title capitan. This position is equivalent to the present day Municipal Mayor.\n\nMamerto Manuel Valmores was appointed in 1820 as the first gobernadorcillo of the town. The last gobernadorcillo was Leon Valmores. Holding this position for about 16 years (1822-1837), Francisco Anuario Valmores, the eldest son of Mamerto Manuel, may be considered as the longest serving gobernadorcillo.\n\nNew leaders had surfaced as changes in the Philippine government took place. Faustino Vega became the first town executive, which has known that time as presidente local, under the short-lived First Philippine Republic (1898-1903). Melquiades Vega, the son of Faustino Vega, served as the first presidente local under the American Regime (1903-1928).\n\nRamon Neri Ludeña became the first mayor under the Commonwealth Government while Jose P. Roa served the same position during World War II (1938-1944). The first municipal mayor under the Republic of the Philippines was Gorgonio B. Tagarda.\n\nThe more recent elected town mayors included Manuel Varquez; Alejo E. Olano, Sr; Porferio R. Roa; Andrea H. Borromeo, Felix H. Borromeo and lawyer Alexis Quina, who is known for civil development. Marietta R.

It is also the largest in terms of land area in the province.\n\nThe town was once named \"Tikala\", a native term for “wonder”. Tikala was once ruled by Datu Manlumupog, a warrior of the native aborigines known as the “Higaunons”, meaning people of the land. The Higaunons observed simple living but with high regard to nature. For them, the vast and rich environment they have means life to them and this is manifested by their unique datu system, e.g., Datu for Agriculture – Igbabasuk; Datu for Hunting – Panumanud; Datu for water respect – Bulalakaw, etc.\nDespite the simple way of life, they were kept united by their Sacred Code named as Bungkatel Ha Bulawan, which under its teaching, land is a gift from the supreme creator for all men, the Magbabaya. Land is life, thus, must be taken cared of under the stewardship of the great, great-great ancestors whose spirits continue to keep watching over it so it could be used for generation to generation.\n\nIn 1912, a Spanish Jesuit Missionary and the curate of Jasaan named Fr. Juan Yras came over the place and renamed Tikala to Claveria in honor of the Spanish Governor-General of the Philippines Don Narciso Claveria y Zaldua.\n\nPolitically, Claveria was under the Municipal District of the province of Bukidnon. Upon the passage of an Act No. 2968, otherwise known as the Artadi Law, Claveria was separated from Bukidnon and was ceded to the province of Misamis Oriental on February 21, 1921, under the administrative control of the Municipal District of Balingasag (MPDC LGU Claveria).\n\nClaveria attained its stature as an independent municipality of the province of Misamis Oriental on July 22, 1950, by virtue of the Executive Order (E.O.) No. 334 issued by then President Elpidio Quirino.\n\nIt is bounded by a series of coastal towns and a component city. From Villanueva Town to Gingoog City to the north, north-west, and west; Bukidnon province to the south; and Agusan del Norte to the east. The municipality can be accessed via public transportation (Van-for-Hires, Jeepneys) from province's capital Cagayan de Oro City. It will take an hour to commute to get in the town's Poblacion. \n\nClaveria is the largest among the 23 towns of Misamis Oriental comprising one-third of the total land area of the province. The current total land area of the municipality measures 825 km as per 2006 data reduced from its original of 894.90 km base from 1990 records. Territorial land dispute has been claimed by several neighboring areas such as the city of Gingoog, towns of Balingasag, Villanueva, Jasaan, and Malitbog of Bukidnon.\n\nThe town has a generally rugged topography, characterized by gently rolling hills and mountains with cliffs and escarpments. The soil is classified as Jasaan clay, with a deep soil profile (greater than 1 m) and rapid drainage. It is generally acidic (pH 3.9 to 5.2), with low cation exchange capacity (CEC), low to moderate organic matter content (1.8%), high aluminium saturation, and low levels of available phosphorus and exchangeable potassium.<ref name=\"http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/eserv/UQ:108365/n25_Macandog_FINAL.pdf\">Claveria's Climate Research Archives</ref>\n\nClaveria has a rainfall distribution of five or six wet months (>200 mm/month) and two or three dry months (<100 mm/month). Rainfall patterns throughout the municipality vary with elevation, with the upper areas having a relatively greater amount of rainfall than the lower areas. The rainfall pattern strongly influences cropping patterns and land use across Claveria’s landscape. Naturally the town is the only municipality of the province which has a cooler temperature ranging below 22 degrees Celsius in as much as 16 degrees Celsius and lower in the higher areas.\n\nClaveria is politically subdivided into 24 barangays.\nIn the , the population of Claveria, Misamis Oriental, was people, with a density of .\n\nAlthough Cebuano or Binisaya/Bisaya is widely spoken in Claveria, majority of the population can speak Filipino the national language and as well as English which is commonly use in schools and government offices. There is a native tribe in the municipality that has their own dialect, the Higaonons which also speaks their \"Binukid\" tongue or Higaonon language. Binisaya/Bisaya is the conversational language spoken by Claverians at home.\n\nApproximately over 85% of the populace are Roman Catholics and the rest comprises the Protestants and others. Every barangay has their own Catholic parish churches with one in Poblacion serves as the mother parish for the entire town. The Our Lady of Lourdes Parish church is the center of Catholic faith within the municipality. There is also a notable group situated in Barangay Aposkahoy known as Doalnara which is a community of people who has their own belief making the talk abouts among the locals. It has been controversial in the past years due to its peculiar way of living among its followers. Although the town's community has various religious beliefs, people all live peacefully and harmoniously altogether.\n\nThe local economy is mainly an agricultural area. Its income basically comes from crop production, freshwater products, and livestock or poultry output. Crop production includes vegetables, corn, root crops, coffee, and rice. The plantation of tomato and bell pepper is a common site in the vicinity. The most recent there has been a major plantation of pineapples by the Del Monte Philippines, Inc. The freshwater products include \"anga\", \"pigok\", \"haloan\" (snakehead murrel), \"bunak\", \"damagan\", \"subok\", \"dalapakan\", and \"kasili\" (eels). Livestock comprises swine, cattle, and poultry products. The Mindanao Silk Mulberry Farm which produces silk is also situated in the municipality.

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nIt is seated about west of the provincial capital of Cagayan De Oro City, east of Iligan City, and about south-south-east of Philippine capital, Manila.\n\nThe partly urban town thrives mostly on fishing and agricultural farming; however, different small and business establishments have flourished, making the town self-sustaining in many ways. All government offices are found in the \"poblacion\": that is the center of the town.\n\nSkirted by Iligan Bay, snorkeling and beaches are some of the attractions. Storms and other natural phenomena rarely strike this town. \n\nThe only significant celebration this town celebrates is the town fiesta in honor of the Patron Saint Francis Xavier which is held every December 2 and 3 although the celebration stretches for a week.\n\nInitao is politically subdivided into 16 barangays.\n\n\nBased on the research report submitted by L.M. Neri, A.M.M. Ragrario, E.C.R. Robles, and A.J. Carlos, the original settlers of Initao were the Bukidnons. They were described as warlike and aggressive and ready to sacrifice their lives in defending their territory. It is said that the early community in Initao was ruled by three (3) brothers named Datu Hukom, Datu Tamparong, and Datu Pulagoyan, who had to protect early settlers in Initao against Moro invasions in the sixteenth century.\n\nBecause of the frequent threat by the Moro pirates, the people of Initao became war-like. They were considered to be /hot-blooded/ and /hot-tempered/ fearless fighters. Hence, the word Initao comes from the word \"init\" which means “hot” and \"tao\" which means “people.” They were people perpetually prepared to fight their enemy to defend their territory and community. Legend also has it that the Moro raiders were defeated, the people planted bamboo along the Initao River as a symbol of peace and truce among them.\n\nThe word Initao, originally spelled by the Spaniards as Ynitao, was mentioned on August 6, 1838, in the inventory of livestock, fruits, exotic and cereal plants in the Provincia de Misamis (Ereccion de Pueblos, Misamis 1808-1839). In May 1858, Ynitao was headed by Gobernadorcillo Francisco Antonio and succeeded by Gobernadorcillo Abariano Caburratan in 1894.\n\nIn 1838, Initao was a Spanish pueblo composed of 3 \"cabecerias\" (Ereccion de Pueblos, Misamis 1808-1839). In October 27, 1877, Ynitao had 7 \"cabecerias\" which became 8 on June 30, 1882. It was decreased to 1 \"cabeceria\", known as Apas, on June 30, 1883, until 1884 with a total population of 1,514. On June 30, 1887, Ynitao again increased its number of \"cabeceria\" to 19 and decreased to 12 in October 3, 1892.\n\nIn 1896-1902, Ynitao was in the province of Lanao. In 1903, Initao once again became a pueblo. The municipality is one of the oldest in the western part of Misamis Oriental.\n\nIn 1957, the barrio of Naawan, then part of Initao, was constituted into the town of Naawan.\n\nIn the , the population of Initao, Misamis Oriental, was people, with a density of .\n\n\n\nThere are three other known beaches in the town aside from Midway White Beach; there is the adjacent Hapitanan (means \"Drop-in\" in local dialect) Beach; this beach is frequented by locals because of its cheap rates; Don Arc Poblete Beach Resort (named after the owner Arc Poblete), or Isidro Beach.\n\nInitao can be reached by plane through Laguindingan Airport. From the airport one can choose to ride a coaster, taxi or a bus. Travel time is 30 minutes west. Like any other in the province of Misamis Oriental town, the National Highway snakes through it. Visitors and locals can go around the town by just hailing a \"\"sikad-sikad\"\", a habal-habal, a motorboat or a jeepney.\n\nPLDT Landlines and \"cell sites\" for all major \"telecom\" providers like Globe, Smart and Sun are serviceable in this town.

{"id": "2172018", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2172018", "title": "Jasaan, Misamis Oriental", "text": "Jasaan, Misamis Oriental\n\n', officially the ', is a in the province of , . According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nIt is approximately east of the capital city of Cagayan de Oro. It borders on the municipalities of Villanueva, Claveria and Balingasag, while Macajalar Bay is to the west. Although its land is mostly rocky, it is able to maintain and support its lush vegetation and its main rivers, Cabulig, Dumagooc and Mandangisiao.\n\nJasaan is politically subdivided into 15 barangays, of which 8 are coastal barangays (Aplaya, Solana, Luz Banzon, Kimaya, Lower Jasaan, Bobuntugan, Jampason and San Antonio) and 7 inland barangays (Upper Jasaan, Corrales, San Isidro, Natubo, Danao, San Nicolas, and Ignacio S. Cruz).\nIn 1830, the mission of Jasaan was established separately from Cagayan de Oro, where its authority and evangelization reached as far as the towns of Sumilao, Linabo and Malitbog in the province of Bukidnon.\n\nThe center of civilization of the new parish and its first Church was at \"Daanglungsod,\" which is now the Aplaya, Jasaan, where an old kota (watchtower) still exists. This kota, however, has been moved a few meters from where it originally stood to allow for the construction of the national highway in the 1970s.\n\nFather Gregorio Parache, S.J. (432 local historical sources of Northern Mindanao by Father Francisco Demetrio, S.J.), was the parish priest of Jasaan at that time. The Jesuits later built the Nuestra Senora de Immaculada Concepcion Church in what is now the Immaculate Conception Church of Jasaan. The original facade of the church has been modified after a series of renovations. The original altar of the church has been moved backward to allow a larger area for the faithful inside the church building. The original sacristy has been moved to the side. The church is registered as a National Cultural Treasure by the National Commission for Culture and the Arts (NCCA).\n\nJasaan is believed to have been already a municipality during the establishment of the Immaculate Conception Parish in 1840. The old church bells (four of them, excluding the one now at the San Agustin Cathedral at Cagayan de Oro) of the Immaculate Conception Church of Jasaan bore these inscriptions around its outer rim: \"\"Para El Pueblo de Jasaan 1860\"\" [more or less], which suggests that the Spanish government had recognized Jasaan as a town.\n\nWith the coming of the Americans at the turn of the 20th century, the national government in 1903 downgraded the political status of Jasaan from that of a municipality to a barrio (a Spanish subdivision of a municipio) and made it a part of the Municipality of Balingasag. The Philippine Commission of 1903, Act No. 960, combined some municipalities in 1903 because the civil government had no control of these municipalities. They could not be defended by the Philippine constabulary or the scouts, nor could they be governed by the pro-American inhabitants!\" The Jasaanons called for the restoration of their municipio into a municipality. Eventually, on August 18, 1948, by virtue of Executive Order No. 165, issued by President Elpidio Quirino, Jasaan regained its municipal status. On November 10, 1948, Jasaan was inaugurated as a municipality, and a set of appointed municipal officials assumed office (from the website of Jasaan Local Government).\n\nThe early 1970s saw the installation of electric power lines and a road widening program. Ubos had some remnant of Hispanic-style houses along its main street, but these were razed by fire in the early 1980s.\n\nIn the , the population of Jasaan, Misamis Oriental, was people, with a density of .\n\nApproximately 20 percent of its 45,310 inhabitants live in the urban center. The population is mostly composed of descendants of those who settled there in the mid-1800s. Most of them are related by consanguinity and they speak a dialect uniquely Jasaanon.\n\nPeople are dependent on coconut, livestock and cattle. Other agricultural products, such as corn and vegetables, were minimal. Employment was provided primarily by the government through the public school system, a few national government agencies and the local government unit. Trading and merchandising was mostly confined to Ubos (now Lower Jasaan) along a stretch ending at the public market.\n\nWith the coming of electricity in the late 1960s, Jasaan slowly developed into an industrial town. Resins Incorporated and Philippine Iron Construction and Marine Works (PICMW) established their plants at Nahalinan, a village which is a part of Lower Jasaan. The Pilipinas Kao, another industrial plant, was established at Luz Banzon in the 1970s. A substation of the National Power Corporation has been established in Aplaya. Vertical infrastructure in the municipality of Jasaan improved when pavement and widening of the national highway that extends the whole of Northern Mindanao was completed in the 1970s.\n\nAt the turn of the millennium, Jasaan has gradually metamorphosed into a resort town. Entrepreneurs have capitalized on the abundance of its spring water sources. The town has spring resorts which draw visitors from neighboring areas.\n\nA number of water resorts have been built in the town. The Sagpulon Falls in San Isidro is a tourist attraction. The Napapong Spring is also an attraction from Corrales. The local tourism office of Jasaan maintains the area to preserve is natural allure. The marine sanctuary is located at the waters around the white sands of Agutayan Island, five kilometers off the coast of Bobuntugan.\n\nSophieRed Hotel and Onshore Restaurant is the second hotel that is built in the town. It opens last July 2017.\n\nThe Christmas season in Jasaan used to end on February 2, to commemorate the feast of the Presentation of the Child Jesus at the Temple and the Purification of the Blessed Virgin Mary.\n\nThe town calendar of activities was associated with the calendar of the Roman Catholic Church. After the Lenten celebration, Jasaanons used to celebrate a second town fiesta on May 5, to honor St. Augustine. Then there was a lull until the All Souls Day, when Jasaanons from all over came to pay respects for their dead. This was followed by the parochial fiesta on December 8, and the Feast of the Immaculate Conception.\n\nDuring the 1960s, the Jasaanon had a calendar of activities that included a New Year's celebration with a \"lubong-lubong\"–a ritual marking the death of an old year and rejoicing in the birth of a new year. \"Lubong-lubong\" (\"lubong\" is vernacular for \"to bury\") was a mock burial, performed in the town plaza. It began with a masked old man in tattered clothes plodding around the hall where townsfolk gathered in merriment to greet the coming year. As the countdown to the New Year continued, the old man in tattered clothes disappeared in the dark. A little tot in diapers appeared in the midst of hall as the church tolled the knell of the dying year. The ringing shifted to the pealing of all the church bells in the twin belfries of the Immaculate Conception Church to mark the New Year. The Jasaanon was then led to the main door of the church, where a funeral bier awaited. A mock person tagged with the year that passed was laid on top of it, and a man dressed in tattered black cloth recited Latin prayer and led people through a funeral march, which ended at the gates of the Catholic cemetery. The bier was left at the gates to end the ritual.\n\nThe town center or poblacion of Jasaan is a picture of the Spanish Catholic concept of settlement model–\"\"bajo de las campanas\"\"–where people live around the vicinity of the church within earshot of the peal of the bells. There used to be a bell at the belfry of the Nuestra Senora de la Inmaculada Concepcion Church, where the peal could be heard as far as the hills of Natubo.\n\nThis town center used to be one big poblacion, subdivided into nine \"puroks\" (hamlets): Purok Uno, Purok Dos, Purok Tres, Purok Cuatro, Purok Cinco, Purok Seis, Purok Siete, Purok Ocho, and Purok Nueve. In the 1960s, these villages adopted names, such as like Siga-Siga, Mauswagon and Mabuligon, etc.\n\nIn the early 1970s, when martial law was in force, then-President Ferdinand Marcos (by a series of presidential decrees) made the barangay the basic political unit of Philippines. The Centro, as it used to known, was then split into Upper Jasaan and Lower Jasaan. Local residents would refer to these two as Ubos and Ibabaw, a vernacular indication of their geographical location in the slope: \"Ubos\" being Lower, and \"Ibabaw\" being Upper. Despite the partition of the Poblacion into two barangays, the old village identifications–the Purok–are still generally referred to in the present Jasaan.\n\nJasaan town plaza is a good example of the separation of church and state property. A road runs through the middle of the plaza, making the demarcation line. The portion fronting the centuries-old church belongs to the Roman Catholic Church, and on portion on the other side of the road is owned by the local government of Jasaan.\n\nThe Jasaan Catholic School (later Mary Immaculate Academy, and recently Saint Mary's Academy of Jasaan) which has been in operation from the start of the 20th century until the mid-70s, experienced competition from Jasaan National High School. The former was established by the Jesuits and later turned over to the Religious of the Virgin Mary, while the latter is a government-operated secondary school.\n\nSchools of higher learning, like the Colegio de Santo Nino and Jasaan School of Midwifery and Jasaan Community College (later Don Mariano Marcos Polytechnic College of Jasaan and now Mindanao University of Science and Technology), were also established in Jasaan.\n\n"}

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nIts most notable landmark is the Laguindingan Airport, located between Cagayan de Oro City and Iligan City.\n\nLaguindingan used to be called \"Daligdigan\" coined from the words \"\"daligdig\"\", meaning trickling water from Soloan Creek, and \"\"digan\"\", a buri plant, which was used by the early settlers as roofing and walling materials. The name later evolved into \"Laguindingan\" because it is easier to pronounce and has a melodious sound.\n\nThe presence of an old Spanish port \"Moog\" at Punta Sulawan manifest the claim that before the settlers came to Laguindingan, the place was the hideout of robbers, pirates and bandoleros because of the once thick forest cover of the municipality. A brave man named Calixto Caseres together with his family moved in from Alubijid and settled for good. Other settlers followed and soon the place became a thriving community. A number of Cagayan de Oro civilians and government officials hide in Laguindingan during the second world war. Blocking force was established in Laguindingan that let Japanese soldiers to use boat instead going to Iligan. The Philippine Independent Church was the first religious order established in the early community. The religious presence was evidenced by the Chapel erected on the highest promontory now known as Salcedo's Hill. The cross still stand today. The silent witness of the establishment of the now growing town.\n\nLaguindingan, was a sitio of Alubijid under the municipality of Cagayan de Oro. The first Barrio Teniente was Mariano Salcedo (from Kauswagan, Cagayan de Oro) which was appointed by the Alcalde de Cagayan. When Alubijid became a municipality, Proceso Pacana became the first Barrio Lieutenant until the end of World War II. Later a move to make Laguindingan a municipality was spearheaded by Glicerio Salcedo (Teniente del Barrio) who became the first Municipal Mayor of the town. The barangays that joined the move for township was known as the Sulawan Block namely: Kibaghot, Sinai, Mauswagon, Moog, Gasi, Aromahon, Tubajon, Sambulawan, Lapad and Liberty. On June 23, 1963 through House Bill No. 5612, President Diosdado Macapagal signed RA 3824, creating the municipality of Laguindingan.\n\nSambulawan derived from the word \"Sulawan\" because the place is situated on a hill or in Bisaya \"ilaya\" going up where the sun rises its bright lights is glaring to the eye, thus \"Sulaw\" in bisaya. The place is also known as a place of \"sabungan\" or where cock fights are held.\n\nLaguindingan is politically subdivided into 11 barangays.\n\nIn the , the population of Laguindingan was people, with a density of .\n\nLaguindingan Misamis Oriental is now the new gateway to Northern Mindanao.

It operates in 15 barrios of Cagayan de Oro City and the whole town and barangays of Talakag, Bukidnon and portions of barangays in Iligan City.

It is located to the east of Cagayan de Oro City and located south-east of the Macajalar Bay. According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nIts name (Tagol-wan) originated from the words \"tago\", which means \"hide\", and \"olohan\", which means \"source\" or \"leader\". It is a residential and industrial municipality, and has five high schools, three colleges, and two hospitals.\n\nTagoloan is about from the provincial capital of Cagayan de Oro City.\n\nTagoloan total land area of 7,938 hectares represents 2.24 percent of Misamis Oriental’s total area of 354,770 hectares. Among the barangays, Sta Ana is the largest, comprising 37 percent of the municipality’s land area. Barangays Rosario, which includes contested areas between Municipality of Tagoloan and Municipality of Malitbog, Bukidnon and Sta Cruz, occupy relatively bigger areas (11.2%) than the other nine barangays.\n\nThe land area of Tagoloan is suitable for six major uses, which include protection forest, plantation forest, rice, tree and vine, pasture and cultivated crops. About 2,405 hectares or 30 percent of Tagoloan’s total area are suitable for forest uses.

Enerio Tacastacas and his assistant vicar is Rev. Fr. Vincente Cervantes. The image commemorates the Presentation of Jesus at the Temple. Its feast is on 2 February.\n\nAgriculture plays a major role in Tagoloan’s economy especially towards supporting agri-industrialization. But because of its industrialization and urbanization, Tagoloan’s agriculture land areas have been permanently diminished.\n\nDuring the last five years, a sizeable agricultural area was virtually unproductive due to encroachment of industries in prime tillable land.\n\nThe major agricultural crops in the area are corn, coconut, mango, peanut, rice, banana, and papaya.\n\nPoultry production, particularly chicken, increased from 70,000 birds in 1995 to 136,542 in 1999, and continuously rose to 226,452 birds in 2002 to 374,000 birds in 2003. The increase in poultry production was mainly due to the advent of broiler contract growing in the area. Multinational companies led by Swift, San Miguel Corporation, and Vitarich contributed to the growth of poultry production.\n\nThe cattle population of Tagoloan has decreased from 2,356 heads in 2002 to 1,102 heads in 2003. Carabao, swine, and goat-sheep populations decreased in production due to lack of interest in raising them and the high cost of investment.\n\nThere are three fishing grounds in Tagoloan, Barangays Baluarte, Sugbongcogon, and Casinglot Macajalar Bay. Volume of catch from Baluarte – Macajalar Bay amounted to per month. In Casinglot – Macajalar Bay, the volume of fishes summed to per month and Sugbongcogon – Macajalar Bay to per month with an estimated total volume of catch of about per month in 2003.\n\n"}

Owned by Charter Communications, it currently serves the Tampa Bay area including Hillsborough, Pinellas, Manatee, Polk, Pasco, Hernando, and Citrus counties. The station, which is exclusive to Spectrum customers, provides rolling news programming 24 hours a day, with the exception of some special programming, including a weekly political program, \"Political Connections\".\n\nThe station was created by Elliott Wiser, who was hired as General Manager by Time Warner Cable in May 1997. At that time Time Warner was building a similar news channel in Orlando. Wiser later created Bay News 9 en Español, Tampa Bay on Demand, and Spectrum Sports.\n\nThe station began operating on September 24, 1997 and gives weather updates every 10 minutes \"on the nines\" and more frequently during serious weather conditions.\n\nIn 2002, Bay News 9 was the first TV station in the area to provide a VIPIR Doppler radar system. In 2007, Bay News 9 became the first station in Florida, and one of only a handful of stations, to provide a Dual-Pole Doppler Radar system. On Monday, January 5, 2009, Bay News 9 launched its upgraded doppler radar system called \"Klystron 9\". This new system is capable of seeing weather features in greater detail than other Doppler radar systems. \"Klystron 9\" combines, for the first time in history, a dual Polarimetry radar, Klystron tube, Pulse compression technology and a 1.25-million watt transmitter. That combination of technology makes Klystron 9 the most powerful television radar in the world. Klystron 9 has the ability to see storms other radars can't see and see deeper into those storms. The Klystron 9's dual-pole technology even tells meteorologists the sizes and shape of raindrops and makes the distinction between rain and ice.\n\nTwo original anchors remain with the station: meteorologists Mike Clay and Alan Winfield. Winfield only works during hurricanes after leaving the station full-time in 2006 to join a religious ministry. In December 2008, Jen Holloway left the station to join the parent company, Bright House Networks, as a marketing spokesperson. Weekend morning anchor Erica Riggins replaced her spot.\n\nBay News 9 was originally seen on channel 9 on all systems, except for Pasco County, where it was seen on channel 6. On August 7, 2013, Bright House Networks moved Bay News 9 to channel 9 in Pasco County, making Bay News 9 available on all of Bright House's cable systems in the Tampa Bay area. The newscasts (with the exception of \"Your Morning News\") are recorded for repeat broadcasts with breaking news and weather forecasts inserted almost hourly.\n\nBay News 9 maintains content partnerships with several local radio stations as well as various Bay Area newspapers including the \"Tampa Bay Business Journal\", the \"Citrus County Chronicle\", and \"The Bradenton Herald\". The channel also operates news bureaus in Tampa, Bradenton, New Port Richey and Spring Hill; as well as at the offices of the \"Citrus County Chronicle\" in Crystal River and \"The Ledger\" in Lakeland. The channel also produces feature reports for Orlando-based sister channel News 13 (Bright House began carrying that channel in the Tampa market on digital channel 1213 in December 2010, with Bay News 9 conversely being added to the provider's Central Florida systems on digital channel 1209).\n\nIn 1999, Bay News 9 introduced \"Health Team 9,\" a team of practicing doctors (Steven Seltzer, Robert DiMasi, Jacentha Buggs and Linda McClintock) and a licensed psychologist (Steve O'Brien) employed by the channel to serve as experts reporting on a variety of medical issues. The channel ran a regular medical news segment during the morning newscast called \"Health Team 9 Health Watch\", as well as a segment during the primetime newscast called \"Health Team 9 Medical Beat\" (which was conducted by the anchor of that night's broadcast). In June 2011, the \"Medical Beat\" segment was replaced with \"Priority Health,\" in which Dr. Randy Shuck answers health questions sent in by viewers via email; the \"Health Watch\" segment was also replaced with \"Health Headlines,\" focusing on the day's medical news headlines. Dr. Steve O'Brien remains with Bay News 9 as its mental health expert.\n\nThe channel operates on a news \"wheel\" format, offering blocks of news segments, weather forecasts and feature reports in regular intervals; regular weather segments are broadcast in 10-minute intervals \"on the nines,\" with more frequent updates during severe weather events and wall-to-wall coverage whenever hurricanes or tropical storms affect the channel's service area. Its programming is presented live, although a digital video \"jukebox\" is used to recycle segments (except for those aired during \"Your Morning News\" block) for broadcast at other times and to provide loops of newscasts originally broadcast live in certain timeslots (particularly during the overnight hours). Producers update the wheel throughout the day, inserting new material as stories are filed and updated information becomes available; coverage of breaking news events are also inserted as warranted.\n\nIn March 2008, Bay News 9 revamped its news cycle, eliminating the \"Beyond the Bay\" segment at 42 minutes past the hour and replacing it with the \"Extra\" segment that aired at 23 minutes past the hour, which was in turn replaced by local news segments. In recent years, traffic segments on weekends have also been eliminated to allow for additional local news coverage. The format returns to the \"original\" news cycle, with \"Extra\" segments appearing at 23 and 53 minutes past the hour during the primetime and overnight newscasts. Bay News 9 also is an affiliate of the national and international video news service CNN Newsource.\n\nIn addition, Bay News 9 produces the half-hour political discussion program \"Political Connections\" (airing Sundays at 11:00 a.m., with an encore at 8:00 p.m.); the program, which is currently hosted by weekday afternoon anchor Al Ruechel debuted in 2005 as part of a partnership between Bay News 9 and the \"Tampa Bay Times\".\n\nUpon the channel's launch, Bay News 9 began producing the nightly half-hour sports highlight program \"Toyota Sports Connection\" (it originally aired at 10:30 p.m., before moving to 11:00 p.m. in 2001), which focused mainly on local sports as well as major national sports headlines. It was originally hosted by former Tampa Bay Buccaneer defensive lineman David Logan until his death in 1999, with Rock Riley assuming hosting duties thereafter (the channel has since begun awarding a scholarship to high school athletes named in Logan's honor, The David Logan Scholarship). The program was moved to Bright House Sports Network (now known as Spectrum Sports) in 2010, retaining its 11:00 p.m. timeslot (the regional sports network repeats the program throughout the following day after the initial broadcast).\n\nBay News 9 maintains a program, \"Project Weather,\" which tours hurricane expos and schools in Tampa Bay area communities providing weather safety information to area students. They do SKYPE sessions with local schools called Weather Wednesdays, where students can SKYPE with a meteorologist. The channel distributes science kits to all 6th grade public school teachers in the channel's seven-county viewing area and \"Project Weather Activity Books\" for preschool and elementary school-aged children at community events. The channel also has an interactive exhibit called \"Bay News 9 Rain or Shine\" at the Glazer Children's Museum in Tampa, a news and weather exhibit at the Explorations V Children's Museum in Lakeland, a news and weather exhibit at Great Explorations Children's Museum in St. Petersburg, and an exhibit at the Clearwater Marine Aquarium in Clearwater.\n\nHolly Gregory - anchor\n\nMike Clay - chief meteorologist\n\nJosh Linker - meteorologist\n\nChuck Henson - traffic anchor \n\nBay News 9 HD is a high definition simulcast feed of Bay News 9 that broadcasts in the 1080i resolution format. The HD feed is carried on Charter Spectrum digital channels 1009 and 1209; it was launched in the spring of 2006, which resulted in the debut of an extensive graphical overhaul to Bay News 9. Newscasts airing on the feed were not originally produced in HD, airing instead in the 480i format (with stylized pillarboxing) and upconverted to 1080i. On October 20, 2011, Bay News 9 and sister network InfoMás began broadcasting their news programming in high definition, with programming being upgraded to the aspect ratio and the introduction of a revised graphics package.\n\nInfoMás was a well-received Spanish language regional news channel operated through a partnership between Bay News 9 and Orlando-based sister network News 13. The channel was the first 24-hour Spanish language regional news channel in the United States; in addition to providing normal rolling news coverage, the channel also carried exclusive stories tailored to Tampa's storied Hispanic and Latin American population. Originally carried on digital channel 139, Bay News 9 en Español was later moved to Spectrum digital channel 900. In 2010, the channel began Spanish language game telecasts from the Tampa Bay Rays and Miami Marlins Major League Baseball, and Orlando Magic NBA franchises. The service originated as a separate 24-hour Spanish news channel focused solely on the Tampa Bay area called \"Bay News 9 en Español,\" which launched in March 2002. On March 11, 2011, Bright House Networks announced that it would merge Bay News 9 and Central Florida News 13's respective Spanish-language news channels into a single regional channel, InfoMás. However, soon after Charter assumed control of the company, InfoMás was discontinued (despite popular demand) on November 20, 2017, due to most of the Hispanic population in the area watching Bay News 9's English coverage. The regional network was launched on July 12, 2011.\n\nSpectrum Travel Weather Now was a 24-hour weather service, which broadcasts on Bright House digital channel 109 and on analog channel 2 (WCLF is digital-only). The channel was launched in 1999 as Bay News 9 Weather Now, and originally provided local forecasts 24 hours a day. In 2004, the channel was relaunched as Bay News 9 Travel Weather Now, reformatted as a 24-hour weather network geared primarily towards business travelers. In October 2009, Bright House Networks revised the channel's name to Bright House Networks Travel Weather Now, with on-air advertisements acknowledging that is content is provided by Bay News 9. After Bright House Networks became Charter Spectrum, Travel Weather Now has been replaced by TV Guide in the bottom screen and a simulcast of Bay News 9 on top.\n\nTampa Bay on Demand is a video on demand service which offers local entertainment programming, and is carried on Charter Spectrum digital channel 340. It features segments conducted by Bay News 9 reporter Virginia Johnson, which focuses on people and places within the Tampa Bay entertainment scene, as well as cooking segments (hosted by Roy DeJesus), restaurant and wine reviews, celebrity interviews, and holiday features. The wine review program, \"Vino Vino\", was nominated for a Cable FAX Award (an awards ceremony presented by industry trade publication \"Cable FAX\") for \"Best Video on Demand Program\" in August 2012.\n\nBay News 9 also operates a news-focused VOD service Bay News 9 on Demand, which features long-form news content such as press conferences.\n\nThe 2011 film \"Dolphin Tale\" and its 2014 sequel \"Dolphin Tale 2\" featured scenes filmed at Bay News 9's St. Petersburg studio facility. Bay News 9 also operates a webcam in which visitors to the channel's website can watch Winter, the real-life dolphin whose rescue inspired the first film, from her home at the Clearwater Marine Aquarium.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2172071", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2172071", "title": "History of the Hellenic Navy", "text": "History of the Hellenic Navy\n\nThe History of the Hellenic Navy () begins with the birth of modern Greece, and due to the maritime nature of the country, this force has been the premier service of the Greek Armed Forces.\n\nAt the beginning of the Greek War of Independence, the naval forces of the Greeks consisted primarily of the merchant fleet of the Saronic islanders from Hydra, Spetsai and Poros and also the islanders of Psara and Samos. The fleet was of crucial importance to the success of the revolt. Its goal was to prevent as much as possible the Ottoman Navy from resupplying the isolated Ottoman garrisons and land reinforcements from the Ottoman Empire's Asian provinces.\n\nAlthough Greek crews were experienced seamen, the light Greek ships, mostly armed merchantmen, were unable to stand up to the large Turkish ships of the line in direct combat. So the Greeks resorted to the use of fireships ( or ), with great success. It was in the use of such ships that courageous seamen like Constantine Kanaris won international renown. Under the leadership of capable admirals, most prominently Andreas Miaoulis of Hydra, the Greek fleet achieved early victories, guaranteeing the survival of the revolt in the mainland.\n\nHowever, as Greece became embroiled in a civil war, the Sultan called upon his strongest subject, Muhammad Ali of Egypt, for aid. Plagued by internal strife and financial difficulties in keeping the fleet in constant readiness, the Greeks failed to prevent the capture and destruction of Kasos and Psara in 1824, or the landing of the Egyptian army at Modon despite victories at Samos and Gerontas. The Revolution was threatened with collapse until the intervention of the Great Powers in the Battle of Navarino in 1827. There the Egypto-Ottoman fleet was decisively defeated by the combined fleets of the Britain, France and the Russian Empire, effectively securing the independence of Greece.\n\nWhen Ioannis Capodistrias became governor of newly liberated Greece, the Greek fleet consisted of few remaining ships, which had participated in the war for independence. The first minister of \"Naval affairs\" was Constantine Kanaris, and the most powerful ship of the fleet at that time, the frigate \"Hellas\", had been constructed in the United States in 1825. The Navy established its headquarters at the island of Poros and the building of a new series of ships began at the naval base while old ships were gradually being retired. Furthermore, continuous efforts towards the education of officers were initiated. Young people were initially trained at the military school of Scholi Evelpidon and afterwards they were transferred to the navy, as there was no such thing as a Naval Academy.\n\nIn 1831, Greece descended into anarchy with numerous areas, including the Mani Peninsula and Hydra, in revolt. It was during this revolt that the flagship \"Hellas\", docked at Poros, was set on fire by Admiral Andreas Miaoulis. Capodistrias was assassinated a few months after.\n\nWhen the new King Otto arrived in the Greek capital, Nafplion, in 1832 aboard the British warship HMS \"Madagascar\", the Greek fleet consisted of 1 corvette, 3 brigs, 6 gollettes, 2 gunboats, 2 steamboats and a few more small vessels. The first Naval School was founded in 1846 on the corvette \"Loudovikos\" and Leonidas Palaskas was assigned as its director. However the inefficient training of the officers, coupled with conflict between those who pursued modernization and those who were stalwarts of the traditions of the veterans of the struggle for independence, resulted in a restricted and inefficient navy, which was limited to policing the sea and the pursuit of pirates. \n\nDuring the 1850s, the more progressive elements of the navy won out and the fleet was augmented with more ships. In 1855, the first iron propeller-driven ships were ordered from England. These were the steamships \"Panopi\", \"Pliksavra\", \"Afroessa\", and \"Sfendoni\".\n\nDuring the 1866 Cretan revolt, the ships of the Royal Hellenic Navy were in no condition to support it. Such failure led to the government awakening to the problem of naval insufficiency and the adoption of a policy stating that: \"The navy, as it represents a necessary weapon for Greece, should only be created for war and aim to victory.\" Because of this, the fleet was supplied with new and bigger ships, reflecting a number of innovations including the use of iron in shipbuilding industry and the invention of the torpedo; with these advances, the effectiveness and the appearance of the Hellenic Navy changed. \n\nMeanwhile after 1878, because of the Russo-Turkish War and the need to expand the Greek navy, a new and larger naval base was established in the area of Faneromeni of Salamis and a few years later it was transferred to the area of Arapis where it remains today. At the same time the Naval Academy was founded and Ilias Kanellopoulos was made Director. In 1884, a French naval mission to Greece, headed by Admiral Lejeune, introduced a new, advanced naval organization and the methodological training of enlisted personnel through the establishment of a training school in the old building of the naval base in Poros. \nDuring the government of Charilaos Trikoupis in 1889, the fleet was further increased with the acquisition of new battleships:\"Hydra\", \"Spetsai\", and \"Psara\" from France. Thus, when Greece went to war in the Greco-Turkish War in 1897, the Hellenic Navy established its dominance in the Aegean Sea; however, it was unable to change the outcome of the war on land, which was a national humiliation. \n\nIn 1907, the Hellenic Navy General Staff (\"Γενικό Επιτελείο Ναυτικού\") was founded, with then-Captain Pavlos Kountouriotis as its first head. After the war in 1897, the Ottoman Empire embarked on a program of naval expansion for its fleet and as a response to that, in 1909, the cruiser \"Georgios Averof\" was bought from Italy. In 1910, an English naval mission arrived, headed by Admiral Tuffnel, in order to recommend improvements in the organization and training of the navy. The mission led to the adoption of the English style of management, organization and training, especially in the area of strategy.\n\n\"For a list of ships in the fleet in this era, see The Hellenic Navy in 1917\"\n\nThe Navy, shortly before the Balkan Wars, was composed of a destroyer and battleship fleet. Its mission was primarily offensive, aiming at capturing the Ottoman-held islands of the Eastern Aegean, and establish naval supremacy in the area. To that end, its commander-in-chief, Rear Admiral Pavlos Kountouriotis, established a forward base at the Moudros bay at Lemnos, directly opposite the Dardanelles straits. After defeating the two Turkish sallies from the Straits at Elli (December 1912) and Lemnos (January 1913), the Aegean Sea was secured for Greece.\n\nThe Balkan Wars were followed by a rapid escalation between Greece and the Ottoman Empire over the as yet unclear status of the islands of the Eastern Aegean. Both governments embarked on a naval armaments race, with Greece purchasing the obsolete battleships and and the light cruiser as well as ordering two dreadnoughts, and the and a number of destroyers. However, with the outbreak of the First World War, construction of the dreadnoughts stopped. \n\nInitially during the war, Greece followed a course of neutrality, with the Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos favoring the Entente and pro-German King Constantine I advocating neutrality. This dispute eventually led to a deep political conflict, known as the \"National Schism\". In November 1916, in order to apply pressure on the royal government in Athens, the French confiscated the Greek ships (see \"Noemvriana\"). They continued to operate with French crews, primarily in convoy escort and patrol duties in the Aegean, until Greece entered the war on the side of the Allies in July 1917, at which point they were returned to Greece. Subsequently, the Greek Navy took part in the Allied operations in the Aegean, in the Allied expedition in support of Denikin's White Armies in the Ukraine, and in the operations of the Greco-Turkish War of 1919–1922 in Asia Minor. \n\nAfter Greece's catastrophic defeat, the 1920s and early 1930s were a politically turbulent period, with the economy in a bad state, so the Navy received no new units, apart from the modernization of four destroyers and the acquisition of six French submarines in 1927 and four Italian destroyers in 1929.\n\nIn 1938, Greece ordered four modern \"Greyhound\"-class destroyers in English shipyards, making a serious step towards modernization. The outbreak of war in Europe, however, allowed only two to be delivered. Greece entered World War II with a weak navy consisting of ten destroyers, two outdated battleships, two light cruisers and six submarines. On the eve of the Italian invasion in 1940, the RHN consisted of 34 ships and 6,500 men. \n\nThe Hellenic Navy suffered its first loss of the war on 15 August 1940 (two months before the formal outbreak of hostilities) when the cruiser \"Helli\" was sunk by the Italian submarine \"Delfino\", possibly acting on Mussolini's orders. During the Greco-Italian War, the Navy took over convoy escort missions in the Aegean and the Ionian Sea and undertook three unsuccessful raids against the Italian supply convoys in the Strait of Otranto. The most important role was given to the submarines, which although obsolete, sank some Italian cargo ships in the Adriatic, losing one submarine in the process. The Greek submarine force (six boats) was however too small to be able to seriously hinder the supply lines between Italy and Albania (between 28 October 1940 and 30 April 1941, Italian ships made 3,305 voyages across the Otranto straits, carrying 487,089 military personnel, including 22 field divisions, and 584,392 tons of supplies while losing overall only seven merchant ships and one escort ship). \n\nWhen Nazi Germany attacked Greece, the RHN was decimated by the Luftwaffe, suffered the loss of 25 ships within a few days during April 1941. It was then decided to shift the remaining fleet (one cruiser -the famous -, six destroyers, five submarines, three torpedo boats and a number of auxiliary vessels) to Alexandria in Egypt. Here the ships were repaired and equipped with modern anti-aircraft weapons. \n\nFor the remainder of the war, the RHN fought alongside the Allies from bases in the Middle East. As the war progressed, the number of Hellenic Royal Navy vessels increased after the concession of several destroyers and submarines by the British Royal Navy, reaching a peak of 44 ships and 8,500 men in early 1944.\n\nThe most notable aspects of the Hellenic Royal Navy's participation in World War II include the operations of the destroyer which, until sunk in Leros on September 23, 1943, was the most successful Allied destroyer in the Mediterranean Sea; the participation of two destroyers in Operation Overlord; and the story of the destroyer \"Adrias\", which while operating close to the coast of Kalymnos in October 1943 hit a mine, resulting in the loss of the vessel's prow, while blowing the two-gun forward turret over the bridge. After some minor repairs at Gümüşlük Bay in Turkey \"Adrias\" managed to return to Alexandria in a 400-mile trip, even though all the forepart of the ship, up to the bridge, was missing. Six Greek warships participated in the Sicilian landings and in the subsequent Italian campaign.\n\nIn April, 1944, a mutiny arising from political causes broke out on five Greek warships berthed in Alexandria and spread to a number of other Greek naval and merchant vessels. It was put down by Greek Marines, who suffered 50 casualties.\n\nAfter World War II, the Royal Hellenic Navy was significantly strengthened by the concession of British and Italian ships. The organisation also changed in line with modern naval doctrines of that era, leaving aside the old battleships after the entrance into NATO in 1952. At the beginning of the 1950s, US military aid formed the core of the country's armed forces. The Royal Hellenic Navy received the first \"Bostwick\"-class destroyers which took on the name \"Beasts\" (Θηρία), while withdrawing the British ones. \n\nThe next significant change was during the early 1970s, when Greece was the first Mediterranean naval force to order missile-equipped fast attack craft (La Combattante II) and the Type 209 submarines, whereas US military aid continued in the form of FRAM II type destroyers. In 1979, Hellenic Navy placed an order in the Netherlands for two modern Standard-class frigates (the ). These were the first acquisitions of new main surface vessels, rather than the use of second-hand ships, in almost four decades.\n\nHellenic Navy was enhanced to his maximum point during the last decade. The arrivals of the \"Hydra\" class (MEKO 200 HN) and more Standard-class frigates along with the orders for more missile corvettes, \"Poseidon\"-class (Type 209) submarines and naval helicopters allowed the retirement of the obsolete vessels. At the same time, Greece was the first Mediterranean country to receive guided missile destroyers, after the transfer of four s from the US Navy in 1992. But all four have since been decommissioned, since their electronics and missiles were considered not able to stand in a modern battlefield.\n\nThe advance continued when Greece ordered Type 214 submarines that feature an air-independent propulsion system, Sikorsky S-70B-6/10 Aegean Hawk helicopters and hovercraft from Russia.\n\nPlans include the modernization of Standard-class frigates with new electronics and radar systems, the modernization of \"Glaukos\" and \"Poseidon\"-class submarines with new sonars, electronics and air-independent propulsion engines (programs Neptune 1/2), while negotiations are being held with the US Navy for the acquisition of two s.\n\n\n\n"}

A Republican, by the 1890s, he was one of the \"Big Four\" key Republicans who largely controlled the major decisions of the Senate, along with Orville H. Platt of Connecticut, William B. Allison of Iowa and Nelson W. Aldrich of Rhode Island.\n\nSpooner was born in Lawrenceburg, Indiana on January 6, 1843, the son of Philip Loring Spooner and Lydia (Coit) Spooner. Philip Spooner was an attorney and judge and served on the bench in both Indiana and Wisconsin. Spooner moved with his parents to Madison, Wisconsin, in 1859. He attended the common schools and graduated from the University of Wisconsin with a Bachelor of Philosophy (Philosophiae Baccalaureus, or P.B.) degree in 1864. While in college, Spooner joined the Psi Upsilon fraternity and was admitted to membership in Phi Beta Kappa.\n\nDuring the Civil War, he enlisted in the Union Army as a private assigned to Company D, 40th Wisconsin Infantry, a three-month unit. After Spooner's 100 days of service were complete, he returned home and recruited a company from his college classmates, Company A, 50th Wisconsin Infantry, which he commanded as a captain. At the close of the war, Spooner received a brevet promotion to major.\n\nAfter the war, Spooner served as private secretary to Wisconsin Governor Lucius Fairchild, and then the governor's military secretary with the rank of colonel He later served as quartermaster general of the Wisconsin Militia with the rank of brigadier general. He studied law with his father from 1865 to 1867, and he was admitted to the bar in 1867.\n\nAfter becoming a lawyer, Spooner was appointed assistant attorney general of Wisconsin and he served from 1869 to 1870. In 1869, Spooner received the honorary degree of Master of Arts from the University of Wisconsin. Spooner moved to Hudson in 1870, and practiced law there from 1870 to 1884.

A popular figure among Republicans, he turned down three cabinet posts during his political career: Secretary of the Interior in President William McKinley's administration in 1898, Attorney General under President McKinley in 1901, and Secretary of State in President William Howard Taft's administration in 1909.\n\nSpooner and fellow Wisconsin Senator, Robert M. La Follette, were known to be bitter rivals. Spooner disagreed with La Follette's progressive policies, which were opposed to his own conservative policies. Spooner was also one of the early opponents of direct primary elections. At the time, party nominees were selected by the party officials, sometimes by party bosses. Spooner's view of political campaigns if direct primaries became standard was:\n\nDirect primaries would destroy the party machinery ... and would build up a lot of personal machines, and would make every man a self-seeker, and would degrade politics by turning candidacies into bitter personal wrangles.\n\nAfter his retirement from the Senate, he practiced law in New York City.

In some countries, denatured alcohol or denatured rectified spirit may commonly be available as \"rectified spirit\".\n\nIn its undiluted form, it contains at least 96% alcohol by volume (ABV) (192 US proof) in the European Union. The purity of rectified spirit has a practical limit of 97.2% ABV (95.6% by mass) when produced using conventional distillation processes, as a mixture of ethanol and water becomes a minimum-boiling azeotrope at this concentration. Rectified spirit is typically distilled in continuous multi-column stills at 96–96.5% ABV and diluted as necessary.\n\nNeutral spirits can be produced from grains, corn, grapes, sugar beets, sugarcane, tubers, or other fermented plant materials. In particular, large quantities of neutral alcohol are distilled from wine. A product made from grain is \"grain neutral spirit\", while a spirit made from grapes is called \"grape neutral spirit\" or \"vinous alcohol\". These terms are commonly abbreviated as either GNS or NGS.\n\nNeutral spirits are used in the production of blended whisky, cut brandy, some liqueurs, and some bitters. As a consumer product, it is almost always mixed with other beverages to create drinks like alcoholic punch or Jello shots or is sometimes added to cocktails in place of vodka or rum. It is also used to make homemade liqueurs, such as limoncello or cassis, and in cooking because its high concentration of alcohol acts as a solvent to extract flavors. Rectified spirits are also used for medicinal tinctures and as a household solvent. It is sometimes consumed undiluted; however because the alcohol is very high proof, overconsumption can cause alcohol poisoning more quickly than more traditional distilled spirits.\n\nSpirytus Rektyfikowany made by Polmos is the iconic brand with 96% ABV.\n\nNeutral spirit is legally defined as spirit distilled from any material distilled at or above 95% ABV (190 US proof) and bottled at or above 40% ABV. When the term is used in an informal context rather than as a term of U.S. law, any distilled spirit of high alcohol purity (e.g., 170 proof or higher) that does not contain added flavoring may be referred to as neutral alcohol. Prominent brands of neutral spirits sold in the U.S. include:\n\n\n\"Grain spirit\" is a legal classification for neutral spirit that is distilled from fermented grain mash and stored in oak containers.\n\nAvailability of neutral spirit for retail purchase varies between states. States where consumer sales of high-ABV neutral spirit are prohibited include California, Florida, Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire, Nevada, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Iowa, and West Virginia. In Virginia, the purchase of neutral spirits requires a no-cost \"Grain Alcohol Permit\", issued \"strictly for industrial, commercial, culinary or medicinal use\". In 2017, Virginia approved the sale of up to 151 proof neutral spirits at its ABC stores without a permit. Pennsylvania sells 151 proof without a permit but requires one for 190 proof.\n\n\"Global 94 %\", a 94% ABV rectified spirit, is available in Quebec through SAQ.\n\nIn Germany, rectified spirit is generically called \"Primasprit\" (colloquial) or, more technically, \"Neutralalkohol\". It is available in pharmacies, bigger supermarkets, and East European markets. In the former East Germany, it was available in regular stores. Primasprit is most often used for making homemade liqueurs; other types of use are rare. Most of the Primasprit produced in Germany is made from grain and is, therefore, a neutral grain spirit.\n\nThe import and sale of spirits containing more than 60% alcohol by volume is prohibited, so only weaker grain spirits are permitted.\n\nMoonshine is usually distilled to 40% ABV, and seldom above 66% based on 48 samples.

This white or colourless crystalline salt is noteworthy for its high solubility in many solvents. It exists both in anhydrous form and as a trihydrate.\n\nLithium perchlorate is used as a source of oxygen in some chemical oxygen generators. It decomposes at about 400 °C, yielding lithium chloride and oxygen:\nOver 60% of the mass of the lithium perchlorate is released as oxygen. It has both the highest oxygen to weight and oxygen to volume ratio of all practical perchlorate salts.\n\nLiClO is highly soluble in organic solvents, even diethyl ether. Such solutions are employed in Diels-Alder reactions, where it is proposed that the Lewis acidic Li binds to Lewis basic sites on the dienophile, thereby accelerating the reaction.\n\nLithium perchlorate is also used as a co-catalyst in the coupling of α,β-unsaturated carbonyls with aldehydes, also known as the Baylis-Hillman reaction.\n\nSolid lithium perchlorate is found to be a mild and efficient Lewis acid for promoting cyanosilylation of carbonyl compounds under neutral conditions.\n\nLithium perchlorate is also used as an electrolyte salt in lithium-ion batteries. Lithium perchlorate is chosen over alternative salts such as lithium hexafluorophosphate or lithium tetrafluoroborate when its superior electrical impedance, conductivity, hygroscopicity, and anodic stability properties are of importance to the specific application. However, these beneficial properties are often overshadowed by the electrolyte's strong oxidizing properties, making the electrolyte reactive toward its solvent at high temperatures and/or high current loads. Due to these hazards the battery is often considered unfit for industrial applications.\n\nConcentrated solutions of lithium perchlorate (4.5 mol/L) are used as a chaotropic agent to denature proteins.\n\nLithium perchlorate can be manufactured by reaction of sodium perchlorate with lithium chloride. It can be also prepared by electrolysis of lithium chlorate at 200 mA/cm² at temperatures above 20 °C.\n\nPerchlorates often give explosive mixtures with organic compounds.\n\n"}

H. Dodd in New York. The work comprehensively records and documents key events of the city's chronology from the 16th to the early 20th centuries. Among other things, it shows the evolution of the Manhattan skyline up to the time of publication.\n\nStokes's worldwide research teams scoured public and private collections of maps, guides and obscure source material to complete his encyclopedic monument to New York City. It describes in detail the growth of a fortified Dutch settlement into a major city, and ultimately included six volumes sold to subscribers and libraries in a limited edition of 360 sets printed on Holland-made paper and 42 on Japanese vellum.\nThe book itself states the paper used for printing the book was of English origin and not from Holland.\n\nThe \"Iconography\"’s many writers lead the reader through picaresque stories about the humble as well as praising major figures. Source material included accounts from ledgers, accounting books and scraps of paper that the author said had been strewn about in unorganized piles from the floors of far flung academies and international halls of records. Much of this primary source material has been lost to time or destroyed by war. In the rare first edition, there is a one page apology made by Stokes to subscribers of the rare set of works indicating where paper stock was - by necessity of shortage - changed from the original supplier's high grade Holland paper to similar high grade stock due to the exigency of the Great War.\n\nI. N. Phelps Stokes was the scion of a progressive, wealthy turn-of-the century New York family. Leaving Harvard University with a desire to reform housing for the poor, Stokes' first contribution included model housing built not far from the \"Five Points\" neighborhood of Lower Manhattan: a breeding ground of crime due to over-crowded housing, poverty and disease.

This white solid forms a monohydrate and is mildly deliquescent. It is a useful source of the Ag ion, although the presence of perchlorate presents risks. It is used as a catalyst in organic chemistry.\n\nSilver perchlorate is created by heating a mixture of perchloric acid with silver nitrate.\n\nAlternatively, it can be prepared by the reaction between barium perchlorate and silver sulfate, or from the reaction of perchloric acid with silver oxide.\n\nSilver perchlorate is noteworthy for its solubility in aromatic solvents such as benzene (52.8 g/L) and toluene (1010 g/L). In these solvents, the silver cation binds to the arene, as has been demonstrated by extensive crystallographic studies on crystals obtained from such solutions. It is also amazingly soluble in water, up to 500 g per 100 mL of water.\n\nSimilar to silver nitrate, silver perchlorate is an effective reagent for replacing halides ligands with perchlorate, which is a weakly or non-coordinating anion. The use of silver perchlorate in chemical synthesis has declined due to concerns about explosiveness of perchlorate salts. Other silver reagents are silver tetrafluoroborate, and the related silver trifluoromethanesulfonate and silver hexafluorophosphate.\n"}
{"id": "2172126", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2172126", "title": "Division of Port Adelaide", "text": "Division of Port Adelaide\n\nThe Division of Port Adelaide was an Australian electoral division in the state of South Australia. The 181 km² seat extended from St Kilda in the north to Grange Road and Findon in the south with part of Salisbury to the east. Suburbs included Alberton, Beverley, Birkenhead, Cheltenham, Findon, Kilkenny, Largs Bay, Mansfield Park, North Haven, Ottoway, Parafield Gardens, Paralowie, Pennington, Port Adelaide, Queenstown, Rosewater, Salisbury Downs, Semaphore, Woodville, West Croydon, and part of Seaton. The seat also included Torrens Island and Garden Island. Port Adelaide was abolished in 2019, after a redistribution triggered by a change in representation entitlement which saw South Australia's seats in the House of Representatives reduced to ten.\n\nThe seat was named after the suburb of Port Adelaide, the working port of Adelaide. Before 1949, most of the seat had been part of Hindmarsh, which moved south as a result of Port Adelaide's creation. The seat was proclaimed at the redistribution of 11 May 1949, and was first contested at the 1949 federal election. For most of its history, it has been a comfortably safe Labor seat. The closest Labor has ever come to losing it was at the 1988 by-election, where Labor candidate Rod Sawford won on a 5.2 percent two-party margin. The two-party margin currently stands, after the 2016 vote, at 20.72 percent, making it the safest Labor seat in the state and one of the safest Labor seats in the nation. Port Adelaide remains the only electorate in South Australia to have voted Labor at every federal election in its existence.\n\nThe seat was pushed slightly northward in 2004 with the abolition of the other safe Labor seat in northern Adelaide, Bonython. A few southern portions of Bonython transferred to Port Adelaide, however the majority of Bonython was transferred to Wakefield which contributed to Wakefield's change from a rural safe Liberal seat to a hybrid urban-rural notional marginal Labor seat.\n\nA notable curiosity in recent years was that in the 1998 and 2001 federal elections, the seat was the only one in Australia where a Communist Party candidate, Michael Perth, stood for election. This was the only occasion when the Liberal Party did not preference the One Nation Party last. He achieved about one percent of the vote on each occasion.\n\nSawford retired at the 2007 election, which saw South Australian Labor's historically safe seat easily won by the newly endorsed Labor candidate, unionist and former head of the Left state Labor faction Mark Butler.\n\nAt the 2016 election, as a result of the emergence of the Nick Xenophon Team, Butler became the first Labor candidate in 20 years, and only the second ever, to come up short of a majority on the primary vote. He easily won after preferences, with NXT pushing the Liberals into third place. While Port Adelaide remains the safest Labor seat in South Australia on two-party terms, Butler's primary vote was actually one percent lower than that of Amanda Rishworth in Kingston. Despite also falling short of a majority on the primary vote, Rishworth received the highest primary vote of South Australia's 11 seats, but remained the second safest Labor seat in South Australia on two-party terms. The presence of NXT candidates in all eleven state seats resulted in a suppressed major party primary vote.\n\nDue to a change in representation entitlements for South Australia, the Redistribution Committee of the Australian Electoral Commission proposed that Port Adelaide be abolished as part of the 2018 boundary redistribution. \n\nIn July 2018, this recommendation was adopted, reducing the number of seats in South Australia to ten for the 2019 election. Most of Port Adelaide's electors will join Hindmarsh, which will change from marginal Labor to fairly safe Labor as a result. Smaller portions will transfer to Spence (formerly Wakefield), Adelaide and Makin. Ironically, most of the Port Adelaide area had been part of Hindmarsh for the first half-century after Federation. Butler transferred to Hindmarsh, while Hindmarsh's incumbent Labor MP, Steve Georganas, transferred to Adelaide.\n\n\n"}

Subongwati Ningdangri Ao and his wife Maongsangla Changkilari, in the village of Changki, in the then Naga Hills District of Assam. He was the fourth of twelve children.\n\nPerhaps one of the most famous Nagas, he was a figurehead of India's football history, and his name is resonant in the collective memory of the people.\n\nIn 1943 Ao joined Mohun Bagan, who were then in the Calcutta Football League. He captained the Maroon and Green in 1948 and 1949, taking over from Sarat Das. Sarat Das was Ao's senior in Cotton College, Guwahati, and both of them had played for the Maharana Club of Guwahati. Ao was a striker in the Maharana Club but on joining Mohun Bagan he was positioned in the defense. In Mohun Bagan, Ao was Centre-Half and along with his two Backs, they were popularly known as \"the Great Wall of China\". He was given the captain's armband in 1948 to captain the Indian Football Team in London. In 1950 Ao captained Bagan in the Durand Cup but lost to Hyderabad Police in the final 1–0. Ao told his son that in this Durand Cup (1950) the Mohun Bagan goalkeeper was injured and that he took over in his place.\n\nIn 1948, a year after India won its independence, Ao was the captain of the India national football team in the 1948 Summer Olympics, in the team's first official game and was the flag-bearer of the Indian contingent. The Indian team's first match was against Burma, but the game was a walkover. In India's second match, against France, the team lost 2–1, with the India goal coming from Sarangapani Raman. Ao played five more matches for India before retiring.\n\nAo studied medicine at R.G.Kar Medical College, Kolkata,West Bengal. He earned his MBBS, and in 1963 he returned to Nagaland where he was given the post of Assistant Civil Surgeon. He later became Civil Surgeon. He went on to be appointed Director of Nagaland Health Services, from which he retired in 1978.\n\nIn 2002 the Mohun Bagan honored him by creating the Mohun Bagan Ratna Award and giving him a Life Membership. In Assam, an outdoor stadium at Kaliabor and an indoor stadium at Cotton College have been named after him.\n\nIn 2009, Union Minister for Mines and DoNER, B.K Handique, inaugurated the first Dr. T. Ao Football Trophy at the DDSC Stadium in Dimapur, Nagaland, to encourage and challenge the North-East Youth to excel in both sports and academics.\n\nEarly in 1998 Ao contracted seasonal influenza. Being already fragile of health and a diabetic, it led to further complications and deterioration. He was transported from Dimapur to Kohima, hospitalized and finally died in the Naga Civil Hospital, where he first served as Civil Surgeon in the early 1960s. He wished to be and was buried in the Naga Cemetery, Khermahal, Dimapur. He is survived by his wife Deikim Doungel, a Staff Nurse, two sons, two daughters and eight grandchildren.\n"}

K. Lohithadas. The film stars Mohanlal, Thilakan, and Parvathy Jayaram, along with Kaviyoor Ponnamma, Mohan Raj, Murali, Sreenath, Kundara Johny, Cochin Haneefa, Jagathy Sreekumar, Philomina, Usha, Jagadish, Maniyanpilla Raju, Mamukkoya, Oduvil Unnikrishnan, and Kanakalatha in supporting roles. The music for the film was composed by Johnson.\n\nThe film is about a Malayali youth, Sethumadhavan (Mohanlal), whose hopes and aspirations are shattered by a combination of fate and human falling. It explores how society type-casts individuals and forces them to act that part whether they like it or not. Mohanlal won the National Film Award – Special Mention \"for portraying young man's agony and pain marvelously and in unique style\". Lohithadas won the Kerala Film Critics Award for Best Screenplay.\n\n\"Kireedam\" was released on 7 July 1989, it received widespread critical acclaim and was a major commercial success at the box office. A sequel to the film titled \"Chenkol\" was released in 1993. \"Kireedam\" was remade into five other Indian languages—in Telugu as \"Rowdyism Nasinchali\" (1990), in Kannada as \"Modadha Mareyalli\" (1991), in Hindi as \"Gardish\" (1993), in Bengali as \"Nayak – The Real Hero\" (2005), in Bangladesh as \"Babar Adesh\" and in Tamil with \"Kireedam\" (2007).\n\nAchuthan Nair, an honest and sincere police constable, has a loving family consisting of his wife Ammu, two sons and two daughters. Achuthan Nair wants his elder son Sethumadhavan to be a police inspector. He shares a cordial and amiable relation with his son. Sethu is engaged to Devi, the daughter of Krishnan Nair, his maternal uncle. One day, for charging a petty case against the son of a Member of Legislative Assembly, Achuthan Nair is transferred to Ramapuram police station. The family also shifts to Ramapuram.\n\nKeerikadan Jose, a hardcore criminal, rules the market of Ramapuram by extorting money from all traders. One day, Achuthan Nair tries to intervene in a scuffle and he is beaten brutally by Keerikadan. Sethu, who was in the market, witnesses it and saves his father by attacking Keerikadan and his goons. Keerikadan gets severely wounded and is admitted in hospital. The entire market celebrates the fall of Keerikadan and finds a new savior in Sethu. His friends misuse this opportunity by creating a brawl in the local pub. Achuthan Nair is deeply disturbed by this and accuses Sethu of slowly turning into a criminal. Though he tried to stay away from all chaos, gradually Sethu is dragged into issues.\n\nHaidrose, a local thug, claims to be a henchman of Sethu and starts collecting extortion money from the local traders. Even Ramanan, his brother-in-law, joins Haidrose. Sethu, on knowing this, beats up both in the market. But, Remanan on reaching home, twists the entire story; Achuthan Nair asks Sethu to leave the house and Sethu walks out. The local police inspector arrests Sethu on a petty case and warns him not to create any more fracas. Keshu, his childhood friend, tries to pacify him; Sethu is broken down completely.\n\nIn the meantime, Devi's parents fix her marriage to a different man, which Devi is not ready for. Sethu meets Devi, explains his helplessness and asks her to follow her parents. She gets married, and he feels completely lonely. After getting discharged from hospital, Keerikadan Jose decides to take his revenge on Sethu. He decides also to severely punish anyone who celebrated his \"death\". He ransacks the entire house and manhandles his mother and sisters. Sethu is attacked by Parameshwaran, the lieutenant of Keerikadan. In a bid to save his life, Sethu vehemently and violently beats him with an iron rod. Parameshwaran gets seriously injured and is admitted in the hospital.\n\nSethumadhavan is targeted again by Keerikadan and, in a bid to escape, ensues a duel with Keerikkadan. They engage in the duel, and Sethumadhavan becomes hysterical with anger. With blood dripping from his face, he threatens to murder anybody who comes near him. Keerikkadan is seriously injured, and tries to get up. Now, Sethu takes up a dagger, and stabs him to death.\n\nAchuthan Nair commands Sethu to drop his dagger. Both of them get extremely emotional, and Sethu falls on his knees, in utter disappointment and anger, after throwing the dagger down. The film ends with Sethumadhavan being disqualified from being a police inspector. Head constable Achuthan Nair reads the Police Verification Report which cites Sethu as a \"notorious criminal\".\n\nA. K. Lohithadas got the plot idea from a story that circulated in his locality about an incident that happened in Chalakudy that narrates how a carpenter knocked down a notorious criminal named Keshavan with a single hit. Lohithadas, who was unable to attend the wedding of Sibi Malayil, wrote the screenplay of \"Kireedam\" as a compensation gift for Malayil. He completed the screenplay in just six days. Filming was completed in 25 days in Thiruvananthapuram. The film cost ₹23.5 lakh to make, produced by N. Krishnakumar and Dinesh Panicker under the company Kripa Films. Mohanlal, who used to get ₹4.5 lakh as remuneration at that time only took ₹4 lakh due to his friendship with Krishnakumar. \"Kireedam\" (crown) was originally the title given by Lohithadas for his previous screenplay, directed by I. V. Sasi. But Sasi did not liked the name and had a dispute with Lohithadas. Malayil on hearing this incident from Lohithadas said he liked the title and would like to adopt it for the film. Sasi's film was released under the title \"Mukthi\" (1988).\n\nInitially, Thilakan declined the role of Achuthan Nair due to scheduling conflicts with the films \"Chanakyan\" and \"Varnam\". The film, originally planned to shoot at Nemmara and Chittur in Palakkad district was changed to Thiruvananthapuram to accommodate Thilakan in the film who was filming for \"Varnam\" at Thiruvananthapuram. Thilakan joined \"Kireedam\" shoot in the intervals of \"Varnam\". The climax scene featuring Mohanlal and Thilakan was shot in Aryanadu. Instead of the melancholic song \"Kanneer Poovinte\", a romantic song was originally shot to feature the romance between Sethumadhavan and Devi. But after realizing it would not align in the story-line, it was scrapped. Since there was not enough time to complete the shoot of \"Kanneer Poovinte\", some of the scenes shot for the romantic song was used in it.The shot where Mohanlal is walking through a long lane in the song alone was filmed in Chennai. The song's composition was a modification version of the romantic song. S. Kumar was the cinematographer.\n\nThe makers initially chose Pradeep Shakthi for the role of Keerikkadan Jose, who had acted in \"Chamaram\" (1980) and was then an established actor in Telugu films. Shakthi also agreed to do the role and was given advance payment. He was supposed to arrive at the filming location, but due to reasons best known for him, he did not reached and they were compelled to make an immediate replacement. It was an associate director who suggested the name of beginner Mohan Raj, who had acted in a minor role in \"Moonnam Mura\". Upon seeing Raj, he was immediately fixed. His character name Keerikkadan Jose later became his stage name. Dubbing artist Nirmal Prakash gave voice for the character.\n\nThe film features original soundtrack composed by Johnson, which consists of two songs written by Kaithapram Damodaran. The soundtrack album was released by Millennium Audios on 7 July 1989. The song \"Kaneer Poovinte\" won M. G. Sreekumar his first Kerala State Film Awards.\n\n\n\n\nA sequel to the film titled \"Chenkol\" was released in 1993.\n\"Kireedam\" is regarded as a classic in Malayalam cinema, particularly noted for its screenplay and acting. Mohanlal won his first National Film Award with the film. The dialogue \"Ninte achanaada parayunne, kathi thaazhe ideda\" of Thilakan's Achuthan Nair said in the climax of the film became a catchphrase. The impact of the film was such that one of its producers N. Krishnakumar went on to be known by the name \"Kireedam Unni\" thereafter, and for Mohan Raj, his character name, Keerikkadan Jose, became his stage name. \"Kireedam\" gave a break for Cochin Haneefa who appeared in a comical role, Hydros. Until then, Haneefa was known for portraying antagonistic roles, he began appearing in more comedic roles after \"Kireedam\" and would be best known for his comedic roles in the later half of his career. A bridge on Vellayani Lake featured in the film (including the song \"Kanneer Poovinte\") would went on to be known as \"Kireedam Paalam\" (Kireedam bridge) after the film's release. Later many films were shot there, but it continues to be known by the name. It is the only location in Thiruvanathapuram that is known by a film's name. \"Kireedam\" is considered as one of the best screenplays written by Lohithadas. \"Kireedam\", the screenplay was released as a book by Mathrubhumi Books in 2009.\n"}

{"id": "2172175", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2172175", "title": "Planogram", "text": "Planogram\n\nPlanograms, also known as plano-grams, plan-o-grams, schematics and POGs, are visual representations of a store's products or services on display. They are considered a tool for visual merchandising. According to the \"Oxford English Dictionary\", a planogram \"is a diagram or model that indicates the placement of retail products on shelves in order to maximize sales.\" The effectiveness of the planogram can be measured by the sales volume generated from the specific area being diagramed.\n\nPlanograms are predominantly used in retail businesses. A planogram defines the location and quantity of products to be placed on display. The rules and theories for creating planograms are set under the terms of merchandising. For example, given limited shelf space, a vendor may prefer to provide a wide assortment of products, or may limit the assortment but increase the facings of each product to avoid stock-outs. Manufacturers often send planograms to stores ahead of new product shipments. This is useful when a vendor wants retail displays in multiple store locations to have the same look and feel. Often, a consumer goods manufacturer releases a planogram with each new product to show how the product can relate to existing products.\n\nFast-moving consumer goods organizations and supermarkets mostly use text and box-based planograms to optimize shelf space, inventory turns and profit margins. Apparel brands and retailers are more focused on presentation and use pictorial planograms that illustrate the look and brand identity for each product.\n\nVisual product placement is supported by different theories including; horizontal, vertical, and block placement. Horizontal product placement increases the concentration of a certain article. Research studies suggest that a product's relation to customer eye levels directly correlates to its sales. This depends on the customer's distance from the unit. Vertical product placement puts products on more than one shelf level to achieve – of placement space. Similar products are placed in blocks.\nA planogram can be compared to a book. A store is the book and its individual modules represent the pages. The customer gradually “reads” individual modules and automatically proceeds from the left to the right, from the top to the bottom as if he/she read a book. This principle is followed by a majority of rules for goods displaying. The rules say that goods should be arranged on a shelf from the least to the most expensive ones. Goods may also be arranged in the reverse order, depending on the kind of goods that the dealer wishes to promote. This makes the difference between dealers of cheap and luxury goods.\n\nCommercial placement is determined by both market share placement and margin placement. Market share research companies like ACNielsen collect sales data for various products and calculate market share of products in various market segments. Margin placement is determined by the profit margin of a specific item. Higher margin places a product closer to the front of the store, where it is most likely to attract attention.\n\n\nThe planogram concept originated with KMart. Planograms are created with the help of planogramming software by a Planogram Specialist, Space Planning Specialist or Space Planning Manager. The retail industry utilizes software to ensure proper stocking. Retailers turn to planogram software to reflect each store’s particular customer profile and localized demand, while maintaining centralized control and supply chain efficiency. \n\nFor example, some software packages focused upon fast-moving consumer goods and hard goods sectors made enhancements to transfer parts of shelving elements to single store measurements, which, according to the producers, should increase efficiency.\n\nRetailers automate the creation of store-specific planograms through use of corporate-level business rules and constraints describing best practices. Such planogramming solutions allow these companies to respond with location and language-specific messaging, pricing, and product placements based on business rules derived from location, campaign and fixture attributes to create localized assortments.\n\nRecent advances in store virtualization and collaboration allow manufacturers, retailers and category management experts from across the globe to work in the same virtual store in real time. \n"}

Krauth reports that it is situated at . \n\nAccording to a statement of the International Hydrographic Bureau (February 9, 1957), it \"was reported in 1902 by the captain of the French ship the \"Ernest‑Legouvé\". The reef was about 100 meters long and another reef was sighted near it.\" It was recorded the same year in the \"Paris Notice to Mariners 164/1122/1902.\" While it is absent from the 1859 Admiralty Chart, it is unclear if the 1902 sighting is the very first one by the \"Ernest‑Legouvé\" or another ship bearing that name. \n\nIt was searched for in 1982 and 1983 but not found, leading to it being considered a phantom island. Nevertheless, it is marked in the 2015 edition of the \"National Geographic Atlas of the World\".\n\nOther nearby historically reported reefs which appear to not exist include Wachusett Reef, Jupiter Reef and Maria Theresa Reef (the supposed site of the fictional, \"Tabor Island\" of Jules Verne's The Mysterious Island).\n\nIn its location and description, the Ernest Legouve Reef could be considered the real-life approximation of the remains of the fictional \"Lincoln Island\" of Jules Verne's \"The Mysterious Island\". The novel places the island, before its explosion, very close by, at . After its explosion, it is described – in the Sidney Kravitz translation – as \"An isolated rock, thirty feet long, fifteen wide, emerging barely ten feet above the water.\" The formation is referred to as a \"reef\" four times after its explosion.\n\nInterestingly, the character, Cyrus Smith, says with surprise after his fellow colonists and he are rescued, \"This island isn't even marked on the maps!\" But, since their rescue, \"this reef [will] henceforth figure on the maps of the Pacific.\" If Verne is referring to real maps or current sightings, these would be as of 1873-1874.\n\nThe reef may also resemble the islet that the castaways first land on, about a half mile off of the coast of Lincoln Island. Verne describes it as \"a tiny islet that did not measure more than two miles in length and much less in width.\" The islet \"occupied a narrow strip of the sea and, although larger in scale, resembled the body of an enormous whale. Its width even at its greatest point was not more than a quarter of a mile.\" And since it was only separated from Lincoln Island by a narrow channel, it could easily be conflated for Lincoln Island itself in its coordinates.\n\nIn Verne's, \"Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea\", the main characters spend a couple of days on a so-called \"Gueboroar Island\" (possibly Gabba Island, or Golboa), which contains many similarities with the fictional Mysterious Island.\n\nFurther association between fact and fiction comes from Vernian scholar, William Butcher. He explains that the real-life man, Ernest Legouvé (1807-1903), \"was a friend of Verne's who promised to help satisfy his cherished ambition of joining the Académie française\" and so \"there may be a hidden connection somewhere\" (xxiv).\n\nWhile we know Ernest Legouve Reef is absent from the 1859 Admiralty Chart, it is unknown if the supposed 1902 sighting of this island/islet/reef by the ship named after Verne's friend is the very first claimed sighting after 1859.\n\nButcher writes at length about how meticulously researched \"The Mysterious Island\" is. If the same ship, or another \"Ernest-Legouvé\" vessel, had also sighted the reef before or around the time of Verne's writing (1873-1874), then Verne could be corroborating this sighting and putting his friend \"on the map,\" by using the reef's coordinates and description in the novel, in exchange for access to the Académie.\n\nIt would be a strange coincidence indeed for a reef to be discovered by a ship named after Verne's friend at coordinates that Verne wrote into a novel 30 years before the discovery, and there not be some connection. As Butcher concludes: \"Just as the missing day in \"Around the World\" emerges in the most surprising places, so the Mystery of the Island is a wide-ranging one.\"\n\n"}

The team is controlled by the Italian Football Federation (FIGC), the governing body for football in Italy.\n\nFormed in 1968, Italy took part in various unofficial international tournaments, hosting the first unofficial European Competition in 1969 and World Cup in 1970. Italy qualified for both the first World Cup in 1991, where they reached the quarter-finals, and the first European Championship. While Italy were runners-up in the European Championship in 1993 and 1997, they are yet to replicate similar success at the World Cup. In 2019, after a 20-year drought, Italy qualified for the World Cup where they equaled their previous best performance, reaching the quarter-finals.\n\nThe women's national team played its first game on 23 February 1968, in Viareggio against Czechoslovakia. However, the national team was not yet part of the Italian Women's Football Federation, which was founded on 11 March in Viareggio. From the beginning, they took part in various continental and international tournaments in Europe and in the world, also achieving good successes. With the birth of the European Competition for Women's Football (1984), organized by UEFA, and later the Women's World Cup, organized by FIFA, the highest international women's competitions became equivalent to the men's competitions.\n\nAfter its debut in 1968, the Italy national team took to the field to compete in other non-official international friendlies and tournaments, such as the European Competition in 1969 that saw it win the final over Denmark, the World Cup in 1970 that saw it lose the final against the aforementioned Danish national team, competitions both organized in Italy, and the Mundial in Mexico in 1971 where they achieved third place. In 1979, Italy hosted, and participated in the unofficial European Competition, reaching the final again, which took place at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, and in which Denmark triumphed again. Between 1981 and 1988 there were five editions of the Mundialito, an international invitation-only tournament, one of the most prestigious events in the women's football scene before the advent of the World Cup. Apart from the first edition in 1981 that was organized in Japan, the next four were organized in Italy, where the Italy national team obtained three victories and two second places overall. The triumphs arrived in 1981, winning the group, in 1984 overcoming West Germany in the final and in 1984 overcoming the United States in the final, while in the other two editions it lost the final against England.\n\nIn 1984, UEFA organized the first European Competition. Italy won Group 3 of the qualifiers, being one of four teams to qualify for the final round. Italy faced Sweden, being defeated both in the first leg, played at the Flaminio Stadium in Rome in front of 10,000 spectators, and in the return match in Linköping. In 1987, Italy again gained access to the European Competition, winning Group 4 of the qualifiers. In the final stage organized in Norway, Italy were defeated in the semi-final against the host nation, but achieved third place by defeating England, with goals by Carolina Morace and Elisabetta Vignotto. Italy were also confirmed in the 1989 edition, having passed the qualifying phase with a play-off win against France. Italy finished fourth in the tournament, having lost the semi-final against West Germany after a penalty shoot-out, as well as in the third place match against Sweden after extra time.\n\nIn the 1991 European Championship, Italy was once again admitted to the four-team finals, after having won the qualifying play-off against the Sweden. In the final tournament, Italy repeated what had happened two years before, losing both the semi-final against the German hosts and the final for third place against Denmark, although even with the fourth-place finish, gained access to the first edition of the World Cup organized by FIFA in the same year. The world championship was organized in China, as Italy was drawn into Group 3 together with Germany, Chinese Taipei and Nigeria. Italy ended the group in second place with two victories against Taipei and Nigeria and a defeat against Germany; all four goals for the team came from Carolina Morace. Italy advanced to the quarter-finals, where they were defeated by Norway 3-2 after extra time.\n\nThe 1993 European Championship was hosted in Italy. After defeating England in the final play-off match, Italy overcame Germany in the semi-finals after a penalty shoot-out. In the final, played at the Manuzzi Stadium in Cesena, Italy was defeated 1–0 by Norway. Norway also denied Italy a place at the 1995 European Championship, with a 7–3 aggregate loss in the qualifying play-offs. Consequently, Italy also didn't qualify for the 1995 World Cup. \n\nItaly participated in the 1997 European Championship, with the number of teams participating in the competition increasing from four to eight. In Group B, Italy defeated Norway and drew against Denmark and Germany, still achieving first in the group advancing to the knockout stage. In the semi-final Italy beat Spain 2–1, but in the final, were defeated 2–0 by Germany. In 1998, Italy qualified for the World Championship for the second time. The 1999 edition took place in the United States, with Italy being drawn in Group B along with Brazil, Germany and Mexico. After a 1–1 draw against Germany in the debut match, Italy lost 2–0 to Brazil, and ended the group with a 2–0 victory over Mexico; Italy finishing third in the group and were eliminated.\n\nWith the beginning of the 2000s, a decline in the performance of the Italy national team began. At the 2001 European Championship, Italy, coached by Carolina Morace, were eliminated in the group stage due to a worse goal difference compared to Norway. \n\nFour years later, at the 2005 European Championship, Italy finished last in its group with zero points, losing all three of their matches against Germany, Norway and France, conceding twelve goals overall. Redemption came in the 2009 edition, with Italy defeating both England and Russia, advancing to the knock-out stage as second-placed in the group behind Sweden who had defeated them. In the quarter-finals, Italy faced Germany, where they lost 2–1; Germany would ultimately win their seventh continental title. \n\nHaving failed to qualify for the 2003 and 2007 editions of the World Cup, Italy also failed to qualify for the 2011 edition in the intercontinental two-legged play-off between UEFA and CONCACAF. The United States won the first leg 1–0 in Padua with a goal by Alex Morgan in the fourth minute of added time, while they also won the second leg by a score of 1–0 in Bridgeview with a goal by Amy Rodriguez in the first half.\n\nItaly qualified for the 2013 European Championship in Sweden by winning the qualifying group with nine victories out of ten matches. At the tournament, Italy was drawn in Group A with hosts Sweden, Denmark and Finland. With one win, one draw and one defeat, Italy advanced from the group stage to the quarter-finals in second place, but were defeated 1–0 by Germany. \n\nIn the following two years, Italy, led by Antonio Cabrini, was involved in the qualification for the 2015 World Championship: despite eight victories out of ten games, including two record victories against Macedonia (11–0 and 15–0), they finished in second place in Group 2 behind Spain, sending Italy to the play-offs. In the first round of the play-offs, Italy defeated Ukraine 4–3 on aggregate, but were defeated by the Netherlands 3–2 on aggregate in the final round of the play-offs.\n\nItaly qualified for the 2017 European Championship second in its group behind Switzerland. At the European Championship, Italy finished in last place in Group B behind Germany, Sweden and Russia, despite the victory in the third game against Sweden.\n\nOn 8 June 2018, twenty years since their last participation, Italy qualified for the 2019 FIFA World Cup, winning its qualifying group with a game in hand. In the group stage of the tournament, Italy won Group C, recording two victories against Australia (2–1) and Jamaica (5–0), which guaranteed advancement to the knockout stage, with Italy's defeat to Brazil (0–1) irrelevant to the final table. In the round of 16, Italy won 2–0 over China, advancing to the quarter-finals for the second time in their history. However, with a 2–0 defeat to European Champions the Netherlands, Italy's World Cup journey came to an end on 29 June 2019.\n\nThe following 23 players were called up for the 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup.\n<br>\n\n\n\nThe following table shows Italy's all-time official international record per opponent:\n\nBelow is a chart of Italy's FIFA ranking from 2003 to the present.\n\n.

{"id": "2172198", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2172198", "title": "Maria Theresa Reef", "text": "Maria Theresa Reef\n\nThe Maria Theresa Reef is a supposed reef in the South Pacific (south of the French Tuamotu islands and east of New Zealand); it appears to be a phantom reef. It is also known as Tabor Island or Tabor Reef on French maps.\n\nBernhard Krauth explains that Tabor/Maria Theresa's existence was reported in three contemporary newspapers as a dangerous reef seen on 16 November 1843 by a Captain Asaph P. Taber (not \"Tabor\") of the \"Maria-Theresa\", a New Bedford, Massachusetts, whaler, to be situated at , later adjusted to .\n\nAccording to Krauth, who makes, however, several mistakes, the logbook of the \"Maria Theresa\" may read \"Saw breakers.\" This means that the Captain recorded simply that he saw \"breakers,\" which are sections of reef against which waves break, thus signaling that an island or system of reefs is near. Krauth further claims that Tabor would be in French waters if it existed.\n\nJean-Paul Faivre reports that map no. 5356 of the (French) Naval Hydrographic Office and the folding map in \"Malte-Brun revised by E. Cortambert, vol. 4\" (without further reference) both mark \"Maria-Theresa,\" apparently 153 degrees W of Greenwich, and that no. 5356 also marks Ernest Legouve Reef.\n\nHugh Cassidy, discussing his escapades, claims that \"A nautical chart... issued by the W. Faden Company, Oceanographers to the King [George III], in 1817 lists Maria Theresa.\" The shoal also apparently appears in US Hydrographic Office chart no. 2683 (1978), together with others in the vicinity.\n\nTabor was unsuccessfully searched for in 1957. New Zealand's HMNZS \"Tui\" made an extensive search of the area in the 1970s and found no shallows or islands. The depths in the region were shown to be 2,734 fathoms (5,000 m). In 1983, the position of the reef was recalculated at , more than 1,000 km further east, and searched for, but not found. Its existence is doubtful.\n\nIn 1966 amateur radio journal \"CQ\" published a photo and description of Don Miller transmitting from what he claimed was Maria Teresa Reef. This has been since proven to be a hoax.\n\nOther nearby historically reported reefs which also may not exist are: Jupiter Reef, Wachusett Reef, and Ernest Legouve Reef (the supposed site of the fictional, \"Lincoln Island\" of Jules Verne's The Mysterious Island). The historical sightings of these reefs were probably inspired by the supposed existence of Maria Theresa Reef. Even in the 21st century, some map and atlas publishers still show this fictitious group of reefs in the South Pacific.\n\nThe island appears in Jules Verne's novels \"In Search of the Castaways\" and \"The Mysterious Island\". It is also present in Verne's play, \"Captain Grant's Children\", but under a different name. Tabor is replaced by the imaginary \"Balker Isle of the southern seas, situated not far from Adelie Coast\" : like Tabor, at 37 degrees South, but with the longitude moved to 165 degrees West.\n\nIn \"In Search of the Castaways\" (\"The Children of Captain Grant\"), the island shelters Captain Grant and two of his crew. Its coordinates being half-erased in the help message found by the children, it takes them months to find the castaways, with the help of Lord Glenarvan on board of his yacht \"Duncan\". Its coordinates are eventually given as using the Paris meridian. At the end of the book, Ayrton, the renegade, is left in Grant's place to live among the beasts and regain his humanity.\n\nIn \"The Mysterious Island\", after they have settled on Lincoln Island, the heroes travel to Tabor island using a small ship, meet Ayrton, and bring him back to civilisation and rehabilitation. The same coordinates for Tabor Island are given here as in \"Castaways,\" except this time using the Greenwich meridian.\n\nThe island is described, in the Sidney Kravitz translation, as having a low coast \"barely emerging from the waves\" ; as being \"much smaller than Lincoln Island\" ; having a \"twisting channel of reefs\" ; and being unmistakable since \"according to the most recent maps, no other island existed in this portion of the Pacific between New Zealand and the American coast.\" If Verne is referring to real maps or current sightings, these would be as of 1873-1874.\n\nVerne goes on to explain that \"It was really an islet, measuring no more than six miles in circumference, an elongated oval hardly fringed by any capes or promontories, coves, or creeks.\"\n\nReturning to the story, after Lincoln Island is destroyed by explosion of its volcano, they are saved by \"Duncan\" whose crew was looking for Ayrton on Tabor island, but instead found there a note, indicating the existence of Lincoln island sheltering the heroes and Ayrton. The note turns out to have been specifically left on Tabor island by the benevolent Captain Nemo.\n\nThe Vernian scholar, William Butcher, to sum up a complex situation of locating Tabor Island in real life, explains that Verne positions Tabor 153 degrees W of both Paris (as in \"Castaways\") and Greenwich (as in \"Mysterious Island\"), whereas in real life it would be about 151 or 153 degrees W of only Greenwich (according to Krauth and Faivre, respectively). Furthermore, the character Cyrus Smith of \"The Mysterious Island\" seems to go wrong in his calculation of Tabor's position, possibly by as much as four degrees. Since Lincoln Island is positioned with reference to Tabor, this in turn means that the position of the Island can not reliably be determined. They could in fact be one and the same island due to a misreading of a meridian.\n\n"}

The seat was a hybrid rural-urban electorate that stretched from Salisbury in the outer northern suburbs of Adelaide at the south of the seat right through to the Clare Valley at the north of the seat, 135 km from Adelaide. It included the suburbs of Elizabeth, Craigmore, Munno Para, and part of Salisbury, and the towns of Balaklava, Clare, Freeling, Gawler, Kapunda, Mallala, Riverton, Tarlee, Virginia, Williamstown, and part of Port Wakefield.\n\nThe division was named after Edward Gibbon Wakefield, who promoted colonisation as a tool for social engineering, plans which formed the basis for settlements in South Australia, Western Australia, New Zealand and Canada. The division was one of the seven established when the multi-member Division of South Australia was redistributed into single-member seats on 2 October 1903. It was first contested at the 1903 federal election on very different boundaries. Two of the seat's former members of particular note have been the inaugural Speaker of the House and two-time Premier of South Australia, Frederick Holder, and Howard government two-term Speaker Neil Andrew.\n\nWakefield was abolished in 2019, following a redistribution triggered by a change in representation entitlement which saw South Australia's seats in the House of Representatives reduced to ten. The division has been mostly replaced by the Division of Spence.\n\nBefore 2004, Wakefield covered most of the eastern rural area of South Australia, and was held by the Liberal Party and its predecessors for all but five years from 1903 to 2004. For most of that time, it was a safely conservative seat. Labor only succeeded in winning it twice, at a 1938 by-election and the 1943 federal election.\n\nIn its final configuration as an exclusively rural seat, it stretched from the Yorke Peninsula in the west to the New South Wales border in the east, and included much of the Riverland. It covered the towns of Angaston, Balaklava, Barmera Berri, Gawler, Gumeracha, Kadina, Kapunda, Loxton, Minlaton, Moonta, Morgan, Mount Pleasant, Nuriootpa, Renmark, Tanunda, Waikerie, Wallaroo and Yorketown.\n\nThe seat's character was dramatically altered by a redistribution prior to the 2004 election. Bonython, a comfortably safe Labor seat based on the outer northern suburbs of Adelaide, was abolished, and Wakefield was pushed well to the south to absorb much of Bonython's territory. In the process, Wakefield lost much of its vast rural territory, which went to Grey and Barker. Wakefield's current area of 6,407 km² is roughly a fifth of its pre-2004 extent of 31,841 km².\n\nNeil Andrew, the seat's member since 1983, had previously held the old rural Wakefield with a comfortably safe majority of 14.6 percent. However, the new hybrid urban-rural (though still classed rural) Wakefield became a marginal Labor seat with a notional 1.3 percent two-party margin. Andrew believed this made Wakefield impossible to hold and retired. However, David Fawcett retained it for the Liberals in 2004 with a 0.7 percent two-party margin, defeating the former member for Bonython, Martyn Evans.\n\nAt the 2007 election, Nick Champion became only the third Labor member ever to win Wakefield, with a 6.6 percent two-party margin. At the 2010 election, Champion made it a safe Labor seat on paper by winning a 12 percent two-party margin. He became the first Labor member to be re-elected to Wakefield, and the second to be elected for a full term. The South Australian federal redistribution in 2011 had the greatest impact on Wakefield where the Labor margin declined by 1.5 percent. Champion retained it at the 2013 election on a 3.4 percent two-party margin even as Labor lost government, marking the first time the non-Labor parties won government at an election without winning Wakefield. Champion increased his two-party margin at the 2016 election to 11 percent, again making Wakefield a safe Labor seat on paper.\n\nUnder the electoral redistribution completed in 2018, Wakefield was renamed Spence in honour of Catherine Helen Spence, and became an entirely urban seat based on Adelaide's northern suburbs. The more rural portions were transferred to Grey and Barker.\n\n\n\n"}

Its administration was fraught with politics, and some artists' cards were revoked on specious grounds. For many performers, the revocation of their cabaret card resulted in the loss of their livelihood. Those of Chet Baker, Charlie Parker, Thelonious Monk, Jackie McLean, Elmo Hope, Billy Higgins and Billie Holiday were suspended because of drug charges, Lenny Bruce's for his reputed obscenity. \n\nBurlesque dancer Sally Rand challenged the refusal to issue her a cabaret card, which was refused based on her alleged scanty attire. A judge overturned the decision as an \"arbitrary and an unjustified act\" but noted that the cabaret regulations took effect only after a card had been issued to a performer and warned her that her privileges could be revoked if she did not follow regulations. J. J. Johnson challenged the withholding of his card at the New York State Supreme Court in May 1959 and won the issue of a valid card.\n\nIn 1960, Lord Buckley died soon after his card was seized under mysterious circumstances. The ensuing scandal led to the abolition of the cabaret card system. Following the seizure of Buckley's card, Harold L. Humes convened a \"Citizens' Emergency Committee,\" which included Norman Mailer, David Amram, and Norman Podhoretz, in the apartment of writer George Plimpton. Humes and Maxwell T. Cohen, Buckley's lawyer, confronted Police Commissioner Stephen Kennedy at a raucous hearing. In January 1961, Mayor Robert F. Wagner, Jr., announced that control of the cabaret card system would be removed from the New York City Police Department. The system was abolished in its entirety in 1967, with the New York City Council voting 35-1 to eliminate the required cards. The Council's discussion of the issue included the reading of a message from Frank Sinatra, who would not perform in New York City and had refused to apply for a cabaret card; he cited the application and investigation process to be \"demeaning.\"\n\n"}

It may also be regarded as the sodium salt of periodic acid. Like many periodates it can exist in two different forms: sodium \"meta\"periodate, which has the formula NaIO, and sodium \"ortho\"periodate, normally this means sodium hydrogen periodate (NaHIO) but the fully reacted sodium orthoperiodate salt, NaIO, can also be prepared. Both salts are useful oxidising agents.\n\nClassically, periodate was most commonly produced in the form of sodium hydrogen periodate (NaHIO). This is commercially available, but can also be produced by the oxidation of iodates with chlorine and sodium hydroxide. Or, similarly, from iodides by oxidation with bromine and sodium hydroxide:\n\nModern industrial scale production involves the electrochemical oxidation of iodates, on a PbO anode, with the following standard electrode potential:\n\nSodium metaperiodate can be prepared by the dehydration of sodium hydrogen periodate with nitric acid.\n\nSodium metaperiodate (NaIO) forms tetragonal crystals (space group \"I\"4/) consisting of slightly distorted ions with average I–O bond distances of 1.775 Å; the Na ions are surrounded by 8 oxygen atoms at distances of 2.54 and 2.60 Å.\n\nSodium hydrogen periodate (NaHIO) forms orthorhombic crystals (space group Pnnm). Iodine and sodium atoms are both surrounded by an octahedral arrangement of 6 oxygen atoms; however the NaO octahedron is strongly distorted. IO and NaO groups are linked via common vertices and edges.\n\nPowder diffraction indicates that NaIO crystallises in the monoclinic system (space group C2/m).\n\nSodium periodate can be used in solution to open saccharide rings between vicinal diols leaving two aldehyde groups. This process is often used in labeling saccharides with fluorescent molecules or other tags such as biotin. Because the process requires vicinal diols, periodate oxidation is often used to selectively label the 3′-ends of RNA (ribose has vicinal diols) instead of DNA as deoxyribose does not have vicinal diols.\n\nNaIO is used in organic chemistry to cleave diols to produce two aldehydes.\n\nIn 2013 the US Army announced that it would replace environmentally harmful chemicals barium nitrate and potassium perchlorate with sodium metaperiodate for use in their tracer ammunition.\n\n\n"}

A common unique feature of the All India Services is that the members of these services are recruited by the Centre (Union government in federal polity), but their services are placed under various State cadres, and they have the liability to serve both under the State and under the Centre. Due to the federal polity of the country, this is considered one of the tools that makes union government stronger than state governments. Officers of these three services comply to the All India Services Rules relating to pay, conduct, leave, various allowances etc.\n\nThe Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions is the cadre controlling authority for the IAS, The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change for the IFS and The Ministry of Home Affairs for the IPS while examination for recruitment of IAS and IPS is conducted by the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) on the basis of the annual Civil Services Examination, a common civil service examination, and for IFS on the basis of the IFS Examination. Since 2012 onwards, the preliminary (first test) of the two examinations are combined. These officers are recruited and trained by the Central Government, and then allotted to different State cadres.\n\nThe history of All India Services dates back to the British era when initially Civil Servants were appointed by the Court of Directors of the British East India Company. The service in those times was known as 'Covenanted Civil Service'. With time, they came to be known as Indian Civil Service (ICS). \n\nIn 1947, with India gaining independence, ICS was replaced by Indian Administrative Service (IAS) and the Indian Police (IP) was replaced by Indian Police Service (IPS) and were recognised by the Indian Constitution as All-India Services. \nIn 1963, Indian Forest Service (IFS) was created and it came into existence in 1966. \nThe All India Services Act, 1951 empowers the government of India to make, after consultation with state governments, rules for the regulation of recruitment and conditions of service of the persons appointed to an All India Service. All India Service is governed by All India Service (Conduct) Rules, 1968 which specifies the code of conduct for Civil Servant in general. The All India Service (Conduct) Rules, 1968 were amended latest by Govt. of India by notification published in official Gazette of India on 10 April 2015.\n\nResponsibilities as vary with the seniority of the civil servant. Junior officers begin with probation and move up in the hierarchy. At the district level the responsibilities are concerned with district matters as well as all developmental affairs while at the divisional level the responsibilities focus on law and order also. Policy framing is carried on at the State and Central levels.\n\nThe central government announced a new cadre allocation policy for the All India Services in August 2017, touting it as a policy to ensure national integration of the bureaucracy and to ensure an All India character of the services. The existing twenty-sixcadres were to be divided into fivezones by the Department of Personnel and Training. Under the new policy, a candidate first selects their zones of preference, in descending order, then indicates a cadre preference from each preferred zone. The candidate indicates his second cadre preference for every preferred zone subsequently. The preference for the zones and cadres remains in the same order and no change is permitted.\n\nOfficers remain in their allocated cadre or are deputed to the Government of India.\n\nIAS Officers are trained to handle Government affairs. This being the main responsibility, every civil servant is assigned to a particular office which deals with policy matters pertaining to that area. The policy matters are framed, modified, interpreted in this office under the direct supervision of the Administrative Officer in consultation with the Minister. The implementation of policies is also done on the advice of the Officer. The Cabinet Secretary stands at the top of the government machinery involved in policy making followed by Secretary/Additional Secretary, Joint Secretary, Director, Under Secretary and Junior Scale Officers in that order. These appointments are filled by civil servants according to seniority in the Civil Services. In the process of decision making, a number of officers give their views to the Minister who weighs the matter and makes a decision considering the issue involved.\n\nThe implementation process involves supervision and touring. The allocation of enormous funds to and by the field officers calls for supervision and the officials concerned have to reply to queries made in the Parliament for which they must remain well informed.\n\nThe Civil servant has also to represent the Government in another country or in International forums. At the level of Deputy Secretary, he is even authorized to sign agreements on behalf of the Government.\n\nA civil servant begins his career in the state with two years in probation. This period is spent at training schools, Secretariat, field offices or in a District Magistrate's office. He is given the position of Sub-Divisional Magistrate and has to look after the law, order and general administration including developmental work in the area under his charge. After the probation and 2 years of services as a junior scale officer, the officer is put in the senior scale. Then he may function as District Magistrate, Managing Director of a Public Enterprise or Director of a Department. Senior Scale comprises the Senior Time Scale (Joint Secretary), Junior Administrative Grade (Additional Secretary) and the Selection Grade (Special Secretary). Selection Grade is given on promotion after 13 years of regular service. The next promotion within the State is that of a Commissioner-cum-Secretary after 16 years. This promotion also entitles them to the Super Time Scale. Then after 24 years of regular service an IAS officer may be promoted to Above super time scale who is designated as Principal Secretaries/Financial Commissioners in some states\n\nEach State has many Secretaries/Principal Secretaries and only one Chief Secretary. Some appointments of Secretaries are considered more prestigious than others, e.g., the Finance Secretary, Development Commissioners, Home Secretary and hence they enjoy the salary of a Principal Secretary. the Chief Secretary in the State is the top ranking civil servant and may be assisted by Additional Chief Secretaries. In some cadres/States e.g. New Delhi, Financial Commissioner and other high ranking secretaries such as Additional Chief Secretaries enjoy the pay of the Chief Secretary .\n\nIn the District, the administrative head is the Collector or Deputy Commissioner or District Magistrate. The DM/Collector/DC handle the affairs of the District including development functions. He necessarily tours all rural sectors inspecting specific projects, disputed sites and looks into the problems of people on the spot also.\n\nAt the divisional level, the Divisional Commissioner is in charge of his division. His role is to oversee law and order and general administration and developmental work. Appeals against the Divisional Commissioner are heard by the Chairman of the Board of Revenue.\n\nIndia was one of the first countries in the world to introduce scientific forest management. In 1864, the British Raj established the Imperial Forest Department. In 1866 Dr. Dietrich Brandis, a German forest officer, was appointed Inspector General of Forests. The Imperial Forestry Service was organized in 1867. \nOfficers appointed from 1867 to 1885 were trained in Germany and France, and from 1885 to 1905 at Cooper's Hill, London, which was a noted professional college of forestry. From 1905 to 1926, the University of Oxford, University of Cambridge, and University of Edinburgh undertook the task of training Imperial Forestry Service officers.\nFrom 1927 to 1932, forest officers were trained at the Imperial Forest Research Institute (FRI) at Dehradun (established in 1906). Later The Indian Forest College (IFC) was established in 1938 at Dehradun, and officers recruited to the Superior Forest Service by the states and provinces were trained there. Forestry, which was managed by the federal government until then, was transferred to the \"provincial list\" by the Government of India Act 1935, and recruitment to the Imperial Forestry Service was subsequently discontinued.\nThe modern Indian Forest Service (IFS) was established in 1966, after independence, under the \"All India Services Act 1951\", for protection, conservation, and regeneration of forest resources.\nIndia has an area of 635,400 km designated as forests, about 19.32 percent of the country. Forest is included in the Concurrent List.\n\nRanks of the Indian Forest Service are as follows: Assistant Conservator of Forests - Probationary Officer, Divisional Forest Officer (DFOs), \nDeputy Conservator of Forests,\nConservator of Forests (CFs),\nChief Conservator of Forests (CCFs),\nAdditional Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (Addl.PCCFs),\nPrincipal Chief Conservator of Forests (PCCF) & Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (HoFF) - highest post in a State,\nDirector General of Forests (India) - highest post at Centre, selected from amongst the senior-most PCCFs of states.\n\nThe training at Indira Gandhi National Forest Academy is designed in such a way that an IFS officer after completion of the probation, should be hardened enough to serve in the most difficult terrains of India. Another remarkable feature of this service is that it needs keen technical knowledge along with excellent administrative capacity to deliver the duty. Government of India is also providing Hari Singh fellowships to IFS officers to get specialized in the field of Remote Sensing and Geographical Information System from the ISRO's Indian Institute of Remote Sensing, University of Twente/ITC Netherlands and in Wildlife Management from the Wildlife Institute of India. The IFS officers also work in various International and National organizations related to management of forests, wildlife and environment such as Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations, International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development, SAARC Forestry Centre, Forest Survey of India, Wildlife Institute of India, Indian Council of Forestry Research and Education (ICFRE), Indira Gandhi National Forest Academy (IGNFA), Directorate of Forest Education, Wildlife Crime Control Bureau (WCCB), etc. besides getting entrusted with senior positions in the Central Secretariat, State Secretariats and various assignments under the Central Staffing Scheme.\n\nThe Indian Police Service more popularly known as the 'IPS', is responsible for internal security, public safety and law and order. In 1948, a year after India gained independence from Britain, the Imperial Police (IP) was replaced by the Indian Police Service. The IPS is not a law enforcement agency in its own right; rather it is the body to which all senior police officers belong regardless of the agency for whom they work.\n\nAn IPS officer is subjected to and faces several life-threatening and harsh conditions which no other service in the country faces, they are entrusted with the overall law and order of the entire State as the Director General of Police and entire Districts as its Superintendent of Police, and in Metropolitan Cities as Deputy Commissioner or the entire City as the Commissioner of Police. As Commissioner of Police they enjoy magisterial powers.\n\nThe IPS officer takes charge as an Assistant Superintendent of Police of a Sub-division/circle after probation of 2 years. The tenure of this post is normally 3 years. The next appointment is as Superintendent of Police or Deputy Commissioner of Police after 4 years, they get promoted to Junior Administrative Grade after 9 years, then they serve as Senior Superintendent of Police and get pay of Selection Grade (Level 13) in 12-14 years, then as Deputy Inspector General of Police or Additional Commissioner of Police in 15 years, an Inspector General of Police in 18 years, Additional Director General of Police in 25 years and finally, the Director General of Police after 30 years in service.\n\nIPS officers also work in national government agencies such as Intelligence Bureau, Research and Analysis Wing, Central Bureau of Investigation, etc. IPS officers also get highly placed in several PSUs such as GAIL, SAIL, Indian Oil Corporation Limited etc. at the State Secretariat the Central Secretariat under the Central Staffing Scheme and in CAPFs such as Director General of Border Security Force, the Central Reserve Police Force and the Central Industrial Security Force, etc. An IPS officer has vast opportunities to work in several International Organisations such as Interpol, International Cricket Council, the United Nations, Consulates (Foreign Missions) and Embassies all over the World in various capacities such as First Secretary, Consul, Consul General, Deputy High Commissioner, Minister, High Commissioner and Ambassador.\n\nThe Director General of Police and Commissioner of Police is the head of the entire police force of the State or Metropolitan City (e.g. Kolkata, Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai etc.) and below him is the Additional DGP/Special Police Commissioner. The Inspector General or Joint Commissioner of Police is at the head of certain specialised police force like Criminal Investigation Department, Special Branch, etc.\n\nIn January 2012, the Government amended All India Services Rule 16 (3) which permits the Central Government in consultation with the State Government to retire in the public interest, incompetent and non-performing Officers after a review on their completion of 15 years or 25 years of qualifying service or attaining the age of 50.\n\nOn recommendation by Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions, from year 2014 state civil servants are required to clear 1000 marks four-stage process including a written exam and interview conducted by Union Public Service Commission to get promoted to the three all India services which was previously based solely on basis of seniority and annual confidential reports.\nExpected Reforms:\n1) Creation of Indian Medical Service for Doctors\n2) All India Judicial Service- to attract best law talent into the higher judiciary\n3) Indian Education Service- to increase the quality of policy making at Central level\n\nIndian Forest Service (IFS) is the oldest service and as per the old British records acronym was used to specify the Imperial Forest Service officers. But when the Indian Foreign Service was created (1946) the acronym IFS was also used to address officers belonging to Foreign Service. Strong protests and arguments were raised by the officers of the Indian Forest Service Officers for the wrong and unhealthy practice of addressing the Indian Forest Officers as IFoS by the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) and Union Public Service Commission (UPSC). As per their version if they want to change the acronym change the Indian Foreign Service as IFoS or Indian Diplomatic Service to avoid confusion.\n\n\n"}

She won a Filmfare Award for Best Actress for her character in \"Khilona\" in 1971. Though she started with small supporting roles, she later rose up the hierarchy, and worked with all the top actors of her time, in the lead roles. She is remembered as one of the best versatile actresses and dancers as well as a sex symbol from 1965 to 1977. She is still recognised as a diva of her times.She is best known for her 10 films opposite Rajesh Khanna.\n\nMumtaz was born to Abdul Saleem Askari (a dry fruits vendor) and Shadi Habib Agha who hailed from Mashhad, Iran. They got divorced just one year after she was born. Her younger sister is actor Mallika who was married to wrestler and Indian actor Randhawa - younger brother of wrestler and actor Dara Singh.\n\nMumtaz appeared as a child actress in \"Sone Ki Chidiya\" (1958). As a teenager she acted as an extra in \"Vallah Kya Baat Hai\", \"Stree\" and \"Sehra\" in the early 1960s. As an adult, her first role in A-grade films was that of the role of the sister of the hero in O. P. Ralhan's \"Gehra Daag\". She got small roles in successful films such as \"Mujhe Jeene Do\". Later, she got the role of the main lead heroine in 16 action films, including \"Faulad\", \"Veer Bhimsen\", \"Tarzan Comes to Delhi\", \"Sikandar-E-Azam\", \"Rustom-E-Hind\", \"Raaka\", and \"Daku Mangal Singh\", with freestyle wrestler Dara Singh, and was labelled as a stunt-film heroine. In the films that Dara Singh and Mumtaz did together, Dara's remuneration was INR 450,000 per film, and Mumtaz's salary was INR 250,000 per film.\n\nIt took Raj Khosla's blockbuster \"Do Raaste\" (1969), starring Rajesh Khanna, to finally make Mumtaz a full-fledged star. Although Mumtaz had a minor role, director Khosla filmed four songs with her. The film made her popular, and she acknowledged that even though she had a small role, it was still one of her favourite films. In 1969, her films \"Do Raaste\" and \"Bandhan\", with Rajesh Khanna, became top grossers of the year, earning around 65 million and 28 million respectively. She played Rajendra Kumar's leading lady in \"Tangewala\". Shashi Kapoor, who had earlier refused to work with her in \"Saccha Jootha\" because she was a \"stunt-film heroine\", now wanted her to be his heroine in \"Chor Machaye Shor\" (1973). She acted opposite Dharmendra as the lead heroine in films such as \"Loafer\" and \"Jheel Ke Us Paar\" (1973).\n\nShe won the Filmfare Best Actress Award for one of her favourite films \"Khilona\" in 1970, and she was \"very happy that the audience accepted her in an emotional role\". Mumtaz frequently acted with Feroz Khan in hits such as \"Mela\" (1971), \"Apradh\" (1972) and \"Nagin\" (1976). Her pairing with Rajesh Khanna was the most successful in a total of 10 films.

Opened by the London and South Western Railway (LSWR) in 1860, it is served by South Western Railway’s London to Exeter services on the West of England Main Line. It is down the line from .\n\nThe station opened on 19 July 1860 by LSWR with its Exeter Extension from to Exeter Queen Street. Main offices and a goods shed were east of the line and a small engine shed existed for the locomotive kept here to help early trains up the 1-in-80 (1.25%) climb through Seaton Junction to . A signal box was built in 1875 (at the south end of the westbound platform).\n\nThe established service pattern was interposed express trains between London Waterloo and other Devon final destinations or Cornwall and local services between Salisbury or Yeovil and Exeter. In 1903 Axminster became a junction when the Lyme Regis branch line was opened. A bay platform (terminus) was built (on the west side) yet the branch climbed at 1 in 80 (1.25%) to cross the main line south of the station by a bridge. A short 1-in-40 connection ran from the goods yard directly to the branch removed in 1915. The engine shed was demolished to make room for the new branch, but a new coal stage and water tank was built next to the terminus. The lever frame in the signal box was extended in 1903 to accommodate the new line, and three years later full signalling on the branch required the building to be extended.\n\nIn 1923 the LSWR became part of the Southern Railway during the Grouping of 1923. The platforms were lengthened in the 1930s to accommodate longer trains and the new Axminster Carpets factory making Axminster carpets opened alongside the goods yard in 1937.\n\nOn 1 January 1948 the Southern Railway was nationalised to become the Southern Region of British Railways. January 1963 saw the all the lines in the area transferred to the Western Region and this was soon followed by the \"Reshaping of British Railways\" report. On 29 November 1965 the Lyme Regis branch line was closed; goods traffic had been withdrawn in 1960. On 11 June 1967 the main line was rationalised – Axminster was now in the middle of a single-track section between Chard Junction and Honiton.\n\nIn the late 1980s the line found itself part of British Rail’s Network SouthEast sector, which invested in new Class 159 trains and extended the platform southwards to remove the need of passengers to pass beneath a narrow bridge arch to reach the 1930s extension at the north end of the site. The privatisation of British Rail in the 1990s saw the line and station franchised to South West Trains.\n\nWork started February 2009 on a £20 million project which included building a new platform on the site of the disused platform, installing a new footbridge, lifts and waiting shelter, strengthening seven bridges and 20 culverts, installing 12 new signals, replacing three miles of signal cables and modernising the signalling panel at Chard Junction signal box and completed that December with a passing loop incorporating the station tracks. This allowed the previous sparse, irregular timetable to be replaced with a regular hourly frequency; trains being timetabled to pass at Axminster.\n\nThe small building at the end of the main platform since 2009 reopened as a café.\n\nSince December 2012 Rail Gourmet UK has had its satellite (auxiliary) service centre on site. An at-seat catering service serves many services from Axminster to Waterloo by hosts based at Axminster on morning train services. The service centre doubles as a turn-around station for its staff based at Salisbury.\n\nThe station is on the west/south-west edge of the compact but linear town centre. The main building was designed by the LSWR's architect Sir William Tite and Edward Clifton in mock gothic style. An old parcels office next door houses the café. Immediately south of the main building is the 2009-built footbridge between the two platforms. Unusually trains ran on the right but in late 2012, this was reversed: trains now run on the left.\n\nSouth Western Railway operate hourly services between London Waterloo and .

Urdu\nAnd Punjabi are also spoken. Urdu and English are the official languages used in various educational and government institutions.\n\nThe city of Ahmadpur East was once the capital of the former Princely State of Bahawalpur. It takes its name from Ahmed Khan, the son of Ghappa Khan Parjani, who was the first cousin of Nawab Sadiq Muhammad Khan I. On the invitation of Nawab Mubarak Khan, the dwelling where Ahmed Khan along with his family, tribe and supporters made their permanent abode was designated \"Ahmed Pur\" and the modern name is derived from this. Numerous important buildings and places constructed by the former rulers of Bahawalpur State remain in the city, including Sadiq Garh Palace, Qadeem Mahal and Jamia Masjid Chowk Bazaar.\n\nThe city lies just south east of the Head Panjnad. It is situated 50 km from Bahawalpur, 470 km from Lahore, 15 km from Uch Shareef, 60 km from Yazman, 320 km from Faisalabad and about 750 km from the national capital, Islamabad. The west region of the city is called the Sindh. The chief crops are wheat, gram, cotton, sugarcane, and dates. Sheep and cattle are raised for export of wool and hides. It is chiefly desert irrigated by the Sutlej inundation canals and yields crops of wheat, cotton, and sugarcane. Farther south, the Cholistan, is a barren desert tract, bounded on the north and west by the Hakra depression with mound ruins of old settlements along its high banks; it is still inhabited by nomads. The climate is mainly hot and dry. In summer's the temperature reaches high forties degrees Celsius during the day and the nights slightly cooler. Since the city is located in a desert environment there is little rainfall. The weather conditions in reach extremes in both summer and winter. Average temperature in summer is 33c and 18c in winter. Rainfall is very scarce and scanty. The average rainfall is 20 to 25 cm annually\n\nAhmedpur East is also an important agricultural training and educational center. Soapmaking and cotton ginning are important enterprises; cotton, silk, embroidery, carpets, and extraordinarily delicate pottery are produced. Factories producing cottonseed oil and cottonseed cake were built in the 1970s. It is an important marketing center for the surrounding areas and is located on the crossroads between Peshawar, Lahore, Quetta and Karachi. Ahmedpur East is also known for its distinctly embroidered khusa and pottery which is made here. The surrounding area is mostly agricultural, which allows agricultural exports in many parts of the world. There is also a large market town for mangoes, dates, wheat, sugarcane, and cotton that bring in continuous demand all year round. In addition, it has soap making and cotton spinning factories\".\n\nThe city of Ahmedpur East is a tourist destination for not only locals but provides an important hotspot for historians and archeologists due to its rich heritage.

He was one of the most prolific early television directors, producing or directing over two dozen series.\n\nWith television in its infancy, Asher introduced the sitcom \"Our Miss Brooks\", which was adapted from a radio show. He began directing \"I Love Lucy\" by 1952. As a result of his early success, Asher was considered an \"early wunderkind of TV-land,\" and was hyperbolically credited in one magazine article with \"inventing\" the sitcom. In 1964, he produced and directed \"Bewitched\", which starred his then-wife Elizabeth Montgomery. \n\nAsher was nominated for an Emmy Award four times, winning once for directing \"Bewitched\" in 1966. He was also nominated for the DGA Award in 1951 for \"I Love Lucy\".\n\nAsher was born in New York City to stage actress Lillian Bonner and producer Ephraim M. Asher (1887–1937), whose movie credits were mostly as an associate producer. His sister, Betty Asher, was an MGM publicist for Judy Garland. His father was Jewish, his mother Catholic. Asher's family moved to Los Angeles when he was around 3, where he often accompanied his father to the movie studio.\n\nAsher's parents divorced when he was 11, resulting in a return to New York with his mother. He later recalled that this period was filled with turmoil, as his mother was abusive and an alcoholic. As a result of having to live in New York with his mother, he dropped out of school and, after working in the mailroom at Universal Studios in Los Angeles, joined the Army in 1941. He served in the Army Signal Corps for four years, stationed in Astoria, Queens as a unit photographer.\n\nAsher returned to California to direct \"Leather Gloves\" (1948), a low-budget film. He eventually gravitated to television (then a new medium), and got a job writing short story \"fillers\" for various programs, which evolved into a series called \"Little Theatre.\" From this work, he gained a contract with Columbia Pictures to work on a film musical for Harry Cohn.\n\nAsher received an offer from CBS Studios to direct \"Our Miss Brooks\", starring Eve Arden, a television version of the popular radio show. In 1952, Desi Arnaz asked Asher to direct an episode of his series \"I Love Lucy\"; by that show's end in 1957, Asher had directed 110 of the series' 179 episodes, Asher later commented that even though the creators knew the show was good, they did not believe it would become an American icon. \"When we did the show, we thought, 'That's it, we're done with it.' We never dreamed it would last this long. Lucille Ball, obviously, was one of TV's true pioneers.\"\n\nAsher was considered an \"early wunderkind of TV-land, blazing a path in the new medium\" of television. Writer and producer William Froug described Asher as a \"hyphenate of a different stripe, a director-producer\", commenting that he was one of many \"restless Hollywood professionals who, like nomads, drifted from job to job, always delivering competent, if not inspired work\".\n\nIn addition to \"Our Miss Brooks\" and \"I Love Lucy\", Asher directed episodes of \"The Colgate Comedy Hour\", \"Make Room for Daddy\", \"The Twilight Zone\" (1959 TV series), \"The Patty Duke Show\", \"Gidget\", \"The Dukes of Hazzard\", and \"Alice\". Asher and Montgomery befriended President John F. Kennedy, and, together with Frank Sinatra, planned Kennedy's 1961 inaugural ceremony.\n\nAsher's best-known work was \"Bewitched\", which he produced for its entire eight-year run. At that time, he was married to the show's star Elizabeth Montgomery. They divorced soon after the series' cancellation in 1972.\n\nAsher also directed a number of theatrical release films, including \"Beach Party\", \"Muscle Beach Party\", \"Bikini Beach\", \"Beach Blanket Bingo\", and \"How to Stuff a Wild Bikini\", for all of which he was also a co-writer. Television historian Wheeler Dixon later suggested that the Beach Party films were not only \"visions of paradise\" for the audience, but also for Asher, who used them \"to create a fantasy world to replace his own troubled childhood.\"\n\nAsher also directed movies made for TV. He later recalled his directorial years:\n\nAsher received a star on the Palm Springs Walk of Stars in November 2003.\n\nAsher was first married in 1951 to Danny Sue Nolan, with whom he had two children; the couple divorced in 1961. Asher then married \"Bewitched\" star Elizabeth Montgomery in 1963. They had three children and divorced in 1973. His third marriage was to Joyce Bulifant from 1976 to 1993. He adopted her son, actor John Mallory Asher. This marriage also ended in divorce. In his later years, Asher resided in Palm Desert, California with Meredith Coffin Asher, his fourth and final wife.\n\nAsher counted Frank Sinatra, Peter Lawford and Sammy Davis Jr. as his friends, and would sometimes carouse with them in Las Vegas, flying there from Hollywood in Sinatra's plane, and then flying back to be at work at the studio at 5 AM.\n\nAsher died from complications of Alzheimer's disease at age 90 on July 16, 2012.\n\n\n"}

The new station is located in the civil parish of Ugborough. It is owned by Network Rail and operated by Great Western Railway.\n\nIvybridge's first station was located at . It was not complete when the South Devon Railway was opened, but was brought into use just six weeks later on 15 June 1848. The building was situated on the north side of the track, immediately to the west of Ivybridge Viaduct. Passenger trains were withdrawn on 2 March 1959 but goods traffic continued until 29 November 1965.\n\nA new station costing £380,000 was opened east of the viaduct on 15 July 1994 by British Rail under the Regional Railways sector. To fit in the narrow site, the platforms are staggered, with the eastbound platform nearer to Plymouth than the westbound. It was marketed as a Park and Ride station with a large 100-space car park to entice car drivers off the A38 road into Plymouth, but the level of train service has never offered the convenient and frequent service that is normally associated with such facilities.\n\nAn early timetable shows just 2 of the 10 trains to Plymouth railway station arriving there before 09:00, and the last return train leaving at 21:11. The afternoon service was gradually reduced until by September 1999 only 7 trains ran to Plymouth and 9 return. From 20 May 2001 a through service from London Waterloo station was introduced by South West Trains, which resulted in 11 trains each way. When First Great Western proposed their new Winter 2006 service there were many complaints as it would have seen a drastic reduction in trains calling at Ivybridge. After considering the position, a total of 9 trains were scheduled by the two companies but with just one train arriving in Plymouth before 09:00.\n\nSince 14 December 2008 three High Speed Train services are operated by Great Western Railway in each direction have given a direct link to/from London Paddington station in addition to established local services.

{"id": "2172352", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2172352", "title": "Scattering theory", "text": "Scattering theory\n\nIn mathematics and physics, scattering theory is a framework for studying and understanding the scattering of waves and particles. Wave scattering corresponds to the collision and scattering of a wave with some material object, for instance sunlight scattered by rain drops to form a rainbow. Scattering also includes the interaction of billiard balls on a table, the Rutherford scattering (or angle change) of alpha particles by gold nuclei, the Bragg scattering (or diffraction) of electrons and X-rays by a cluster of atoms, and the inelastic scattering of a fission fragment as it traverses a thin foil. More precisely, scattering consists of the study of how solutions of partial differential equations, propagating freely \"in the distant past\", come together and interact with one another or with a boundary condition, and then propagate away \"to the distant future\". The direct scattering problem is the problem of determining the distribution of scattered radiation/particle flux basing on the characteristics of the scatterer. The inverse scattering problem is the problem of determining the characteristics of an object (e.g., its shape, internal constitution) from measurement data of radiation or particles scattered from the object.\n\nSince its early statement for radiolocation, the problem has found vast number of applications, such as echolocation, geophysical survey, nondestructive testing, medical imaging and quantum field theory, to name just a few.\n\nThe concepts used in scattering theory go by different names in \ndifferent fields. The object of this section is to point the reader \nto common threads.\n\nWhen the target is a set of many scattering centers whose relative position varies unpredictably, it is customary to think of a range equation whose arguments take different forms in different application areas. In the simplest case consider an interaction that removes particles from the \"unscattered beam\" at a uniform rate that is proportional to the incident flux formula_1 of particles per unit area per unit time, i.e. that\n\nwhere \"Q\" is an interaction coefficient and \"x\" is the distance traveled in the target.\n\nThe above ordinary first-order differential equation has solutions of the form:\n\nwhere \"I\" is the initial flux, path length Δx ≡ \"x\" − \"x\", the second equality defines an interaction mean free path λ, the third uses the number of targets per unit volume η to define an area cross-section σ, and the last uses the target mass density ρ to define a density mean free path τ. Hence one converts between these quantities via \"Q\" = 1/\"λ\" = \"ησ\" = \"ρ/τ\", as shown in the figure at left.\n\nIn electromagnetic absorption spectroscopy, for example, interaction coefficient (e.g. Q in cm) is variously called opacity, absorption coefficient, and attenuation coefficient. In nuclear physics, area cross-sections (e.g. σ in barns or units of 10 cm), density mean free path (e.g. τ in grams/cm), and its reciprocal the mass attenuation coefficient (e.g. in cm/gram) or \"area per nucleon\" are all popular, while in electron microscopy the inelastic mean free path (e.g. λ in nanometers) is often discussed instead.\n\nIn mathematical physics, scattering theory is a framework for studying and understanding the interaction or scattering of solutions to partial differential equations. In acoustics, the differential equation is the wave equation, and scattering studies how its solutions, the sound waves, scatter from solid objects or propagate through non-uniform media (such as sound waves, in sea water, coming from a submarine). In the case of classical electrodynamics, the differential equation is again the wave equation, and the scattering of light or radio waves is studied. In particle physics, the equations are those of Quantum electrodynamics, Quantum chromodynamics and the Standard Model, the solutions of which correspond to fundamental particles.\n\nIn regular quantum mechanics, which includes quantum chemistry, the relevant equation is the Schrödinger equation, although equivalent formulations, such as the Lippmann-Schwinger equation and the Faddeev equations, are also largely used. The solutions of interest describe the long-term motion of free atoms, molecules, photons, electrons, and protons. The scenario is that several particles come together from an infinite distance away. These reagents then collide, optionally reacting, getting destroyed or creating new particles. The products and unused reagents then fly away to infinity again. (The atoms and molecules are effectively particles for our purposes. Also, under everyday circumstances, only photons are being created and destroyed.) The solutions reveal which directions the products are most likely to fly off to and how quickly. They also reveal the probability of various reactions, creations, and decays occurring. There are two predominant techniques of finding solutions to scattering problems: partial wave analysis, and the Born approximation.\n\nThe term \"elastic scattering\" implies that the internal states of the scattered particles do not change, and hence they emerge unchanged from the scattering process. In inelastic scattering, by contrast, the particles' internal state is changed, which may amount to exciting some of the electrons of a scattering atom, or the complete annihilation of a scattering particle and the creation of entirely new particles.\n\nThe example of scattering in quantum chemistry is particularly instructive, as the theory is reasonably complex while still having a good foundation on which to build an intuitive understanding. When two atoms are scattered off one another, one can understand them as being the bound state solutions of some differential equation. Thus, for example, the hydrogen atom corresponds to a solution to the Schrödinger equation with a negative inverse-power (i.e., attractive Coulombic) central potential. The scattering of two hydrogen atoms will disturb the state of each atom, resulting in one or both becoming excited, or even ionized, representing an inelastic scattering process.\n\nThe term \"deep inelastic scattering\" refers to a special kind of scattering experiment in particle physics.\n\nIn mathematics, scattering theory deals with a more abstract formulation of the same set of concepts. For example, if a differential equation is known to have some simple, localized solutions, and the solutions are a function of a single parameter, that parameter can take the conceptual role of time. One then asks what might happen if two such solutions are set up far away from each other, in the \"distant past\", and are made to move towards each other, interact (under the constraint of the differential equation) and then move apart in the \"future\". The scattering matrix then pairs solutions in the \"distant past\" to those in the \"distant future\".\n\nSolutions to differential equations are often posed on manifolds. Frequently, the means to the solution requires the study of the spectrum of an operator on the manifold. As a result, the solutions often have a spectrum that can be identified with a Hilbert space, and scattering is described by a certain map, the S matrix, on Hilbert spaces. Spaces with a discrete spectrum correspond to bound states in quantum mechanics, while a continuous spectrum is associated with scattering states. The study of inelastic scattering then asks how discrete and continuous spectra are mixed together.\n\nAn important, notable development is the inverse scattering transform, central to the solution of many exactly solvable models.\n\n"}

It originally aired in broadcast syndication beginning on January 10, 1993. The episode was written by Katharyn Powers, with additional elements added by executive producer Michael Piller and co-producer Peter Allan Fields. It was directed by Winrich Kolbe.\n\nSet in the 24th century, the series follows the adventures on Deep Space Nine, a space station located near a stable wormhole between the Alpha and Gamma quadrants of the Milky Way Galaxy, in orbit of the planet Bajor. In this episode, a Bajoran terrorist seeks asylum aboard the station from pursuing Cardassians, publicly renouncing his past violent ways. He begins liaising with the Duras sisters (Barbara March and Gwynyth Walsh), leading to suspicion that he was planning further acts of terrorism and causing Major Kira Nerys (Nana Visitor) to consider her loyalties.\n\nThe episode introduces the character of Garak, played by Andrew Robinson, who would return in the and made continued appearances throughout the series. The character's traits were developed by Robinson, who was praised for his work by Kolbe. \"Past Prologue\" was the second most watched episode of the season, receiving a Nielsen rating of 13.4 percent. It was received positively by critics, who praised the introduction of Garak, although it was suggested that the plot was predictable due to the need to maintain the status quo at the end of the episode.\n\nThe crew of Deep Space Nine rescue the Bajoran Tahna Los (Jeffrey Nordling) from a vessel that is being attacked by the Cardassians. They state that Tahna is a known member of a terrorist organization and demand his return, but Tahna asks for political asylum, pleading to his former friend Major Kira Nerys (Nana Visitor) for help. Commander Benjamin Sisko (Avery Brooks) grants his request. Later, Odo (René Auberjonois) spots Tahna with the Duras sisters (Barbara March and Gwynyth Walsh) making covert discussions. Tahna also seeks to gain the use of a runabout from Kira.\n\nDr. Julian Bashir (Alexander Siddig), thanks to his new-found friend Elim Garak (Andrew Robinson), overhears the Duras sisters planning to rendezvous with the Bajoran to give him a vial of bilitrium, a crystalline compound that can release a tremendous amount of power, but only if connected to an antimatter converter. Garak reveals why the Cardassians were chasing Tahna: he stole one from them, meaning he will have the component materials required to build a bomb.\n\nWith no solid evidence to act currently, the crew allow him to take a runabout and intend to arrest him after the transaction. Kira finds herself confused about her own past with the Bajoran resistance and where her current loyalties stand, and offers to go with Tahna in the runabout. Commander Sisko and Chief Miles O'Brien (Colm Meaney) wait in a second runabout nearby while Tahna and Kira complete the transaction. When the second runabout appears, Tahna realizes he has been set up; matters are further complicated by the arrival of the Cardassian warship.\n\nTahna orders Kira at gunpoint to return to the station, intending to collapse the wormhole with an explosive device, because then Bajor will have no motivation to invite Federation presence on Bajoran territory, which he sees as a new occupation. Kira lurches the runabout to one side, causing Tahna to fall over and allowing her to pilot the ship through the wormhole to the Gamma Quadrant; where she ejects the bomb causing it to explode harmlessly in space. However, Tahna has regained control of his weapon and orders Kira to return to the Alpha Quadrant. There, Sisko gives Tahna an ultimatum, either to give himself over to the station's authorities, or to wait to be destroyed by the Cardassians. Tahna hands over his weapon to Kira, and turns himself in; Kira explains that he may come to understand why this was the right thing to do someday.\n\nAlthough it was shown second in broadcast order following the , \"Past Prologue\" was filmed third, following \"\". There were several changes to hair and makeup following \"A Man Alone\", including modifications to Odo, and a simpler, closer haircut for Nana Visitor in her role as Major Kira. Visitor had pushed for her changes as she did not find it believable that the character would style her hair on a daily basis, instead wanting a look that took minimal effort. The episode was directed by Winrich Kolbe, in line with executive producer Rick Berman's policy of only allowing directors with previous experience on \"\" work on the of \"Deep Space Nine\". He would go on to direct the series finale of \"The Next Generation\", \"\", and 48 episodes of the franchise across four separate series.\n\nKatharyn Powers received the sole writing credit on the episode, although elements such as Garak were created by co-producer Peter Allan Fields. Powers had previously written \"\", a episode of \"The Next Generation\". An initial version of her script featured Kira and Tahna as lovers, which was rejected by executive producer Michael Piller. The ending originally showed the terrorist giving up his violent ways and seeking peace with the Cardassians before being killed by the Bajorans. The episode was named after the line from William Shakespeare's \"The Tempest\"; \"what’s past is prologue.\"\n\nFollowing a suggestion by Piller, the Duras sisters were written into the episode. The duo had previously appeared in the two-part \"The Next Generation\" episode \"\" and would go on to appear in \"\" and the film \"Star Trek Generations\". The character of Admiral Rollman made her first appearance in \"Past Prologue\", and would later return in the episode \"\". Susan Bay, who played Rollman, has a long-standing relationship with the \"Star Trek\" franchise as she was the wife of Leonard Nimoy, the actor who portrayed Spock in \"\" and the film series. Also appearing in this episode was Vaughn Armstrong, who would go on to play thirteen different characters within the franchise, including the recurring part of Rear Admiral Maxwell Forrest in \"\".\n\nThe episode is best known for the introduction of the recurring character Elim Garak. Fields said of the character at the time, \"we didn't want to make him an out and out spy, because then what would you do with him after the episode? You'd have to put him in jail on Bajor. So we tread a pretty thin line.\" Fields had decided when creating the character that the station needed a Cardassian on-board and when no-one objected to his suggestion to put him in a tailor shop, that became Garak's profession. This was a reference to \"The Man from U.N.C.L.E.\", which used a tailor shop as a front, as Fields had begun his writing career on that series. Andrew Robinson had originally been considered for the part of Odo, and was one of the final three actors vying for the part alongside Gerrit Graham and René Auberjonois. Robinson was invited back to audition for Garak, while Graham was cast as the Hunter in \"Captive Pursuit\".\n\nKolbe thought at first that casting Robinson was \"really off-the-way\" but he felt the actor made the episode \"bloom\". He gave general guidelines to Robinson about how he could approach the character, but it was Robinson who developed the traits of the character. Kolbe also praised the writing saying that \"I wish there was more writing like this for television. I think we'd have a much healthier industry.\" Robinson said that Garak was a complicated character which required the use of subtext, adding that it wasn't a simple way to portray a character \"but when you do it well, you really get people's attention\". He was told by the producers that they intended to bring him back onto the show, but in a later interview, he said that this was commonplace in the industry and doesn't usually occur. When he was brought back for the second-season episode \"\", executive producer Ira Steven Behr apologized for not bringing him back sooner.\n\n\"Past Prologue\" was first released in broadcast syndication on January 11, 1993. It received a Nielsen rating of 13.4 percent, placing second in its timeslot. This was the second highest rated episode of the season, behind \"Emissary\".\n\nIn 2012, Zack Handlen wrote for \"The A.V. Club\" that Garak was \"striking\" from his first appearance, and it was immediately apparent that he was an important character. He compared Kira's problem of loyalty to those experienced by Ro Laren in \"The Next Generation\" episode \"\", however it didn't work as well since the show would have to maintain the status quo by the end of the episode since Kira was a main character. He summarized, saying that it was a good episode but not great.\n\nIn 2013, Keith DeCandido wrote for Tor.com that Garak could have been a \"walking, talking cliché\", but that Robinson \"imbues him with such charm that it’s impossible not to love the character\". He said that it was an excellent episode, due in part to the way that the character's dynamics are formed. He gave it a rating of eight out of ten.\n\nThe first home media release of the episode was on VHS cassette in the United States on September 10, 1996. It was part of the initial launch of cassettes by Paramount Home Video which saw the first six episodes released and was on a single episode cassette. It was released on DVD as part of the season one box set on June 3, 2003.\n\nIn 2018, SyFy recommend \"Past Prologue\" for its abbreviated watch for the Bajoran character Kira Nerys. They explain that the episode helps establish Kira's backstory, as she encounters a previous relation from the days of the occupation; as the story unfolds her relationship with the Federation is also established.\n\n\n"}

This continued up to 1885 except for a short break on account of war between France and Russia.\n\nOfficers appointed from 1867 to 1885 were trained in Germany and France, and from 1885 to 1905 at Cooper's Hill, London, also known as Royal Indian Engineering College where 173 officers were trained. From 1905 to 1926, the University of Oxford (Sir William Schlich), University of Cambridge, and University of Edinburgh had undertaken the task of training Imperial Forestry Service officers. In 1920, the Government of India took the decision that the IFS Probationers may be trained at one centre and consequent to the establishment of Forest Research Institute at Dehradun, the training started in India in the year 1926.\n\nThe Government of India Act 1935, which transferred forestry to Provisional list, resulted in abolition of the IFS training. Indian Forest College was established in 1938. The Superior Forest Service officers, recruited from different states, were trained in the Indian Forest College. The stated mandate of the service was scientific management of the forests to exploit it on a sustained basis for primarily timber products. It was during this time that large tracts of the forest were brought under state control through the process of reservation under the Indian Forest Act, 1927.\n\nThe management of the forest went into the hands of the provincial government in 1935 and even today the Forest Departments are managing the forest of the country under the respective State governments. Since the subject of forestry was shifted to the concurrent list in the year 1977, the central government plays an important role, particularly at the policy level in the management of the forest.\n\nThe main thrust of managing forests for production of timber products as in the British period continued even after the reconstitution of IFS in 1966. The recommendations of National Commission on Agriculture in 1976 was a landmark shift in forest management. It was for the first time that people's perception was taken care of in addressing biomass needs and extension activities through social forestry were introduced. The concept of sustained yield was addressed in tandem with biomass needs of the people living in and around forest areas. Equal thrust was given to habitat management in protected area and conserving the biodiversity of the land. Today there are over 2700 IFS officers serving in the country, serving in both the 31 Forest Departments in the States and Union Territories and working in various Ministries and institutions both in the State and Central Government of india.\n\nThe modern Indian Forest Service was established in 1966, after independence, under the All India Services Act 1951. The first Inspector General of Forests, Hari Singh, was instrumental in the development of the IFS.\n\nIndia has an area of 635,400 km designated as forests, about 19.32% of the country. India's forest policy was created in 1894 and revised in 1952 and again in the year 1988.\n\nOfficers are recruited through an open competitive examination conducted by the UPSC and then trained for about two years by the Central Government at Indira Gandhi National Forest Academy. Their services are placed under various State cadres and joint cadres, being an All India Service they have the mandate to serve both under the State and Central Governments.\n\nThey are also eligible for State and Central deputations as their counterpart IAS and IPS officers. Deputation of IFS officers to the Central Government includes appointments in Central Ministries at the position of Deputy Secretary, Director, Joint Secretary and Additional Secretary etc.; appointments in various Public Sector Units, Institutes and Academies at the position of Chief Vigilance Officer (CVO), Regional passport officers, Managing Directors, Inspector General, Director General etc.\n\nDeputation of IFS officers is also permissible to foreign governments, United Nations bodies, international organisations, NGOs, voluntary organisations apart from private sector as per the \"Indian Forest Service (Cadre) Rules, 1966\".\n\nAs per Rule 6 of the Indian Forest Service (Cadre) Rules, 1966 deputation of IFS officers broadly falls into two categories:\n\nFor Central Deputation, there are two schemes devised for the purpose of regulating appointments in Government of India and organisations under its control.\n\nAfter the IAS, the Indian Forest Service has the highest number of officers posted as Joint Secretaries, Additional Secretaries and Secretaries to the Government of India, There are two Central Staffing Schemes, one each controlled by Ministry of Environment and Forests (India) (MoEF) and Department of Personnel & Training (DoPT) of Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions and they are respectively called as CSS of MoEF and CSS of DoPT.\n\nManning the pre-identified professional positions in the Ministry, its regional offices, subordinate offices, organisations under its control (located elsewhere in the country) and in other Ministries/Departments, exclusively by IFS, CSS of MoEF scheme has been formulated. The posts included under it are Director General of Forests, Additional Director General of Forests, Inspector General of Forests and Deputy Inspector General of Forests in Ministry of Environment and Forests, Associate Professors and Lecturers in IGNFA, Director of Forest Survey of India, Indira Gandhi National Forest Academy, Project Tiger, Project Elephant, National Zoological Park, Forest Education and Deputy Directors/Conservators in Regional offices of the Ministry.\n\nSimilar to the CSS of the MoEF, for manning pre-identified positions of Under Secretary (US), Deputy Secretary (DS), Director, Joint Secretary to Government of India (JS), Additional Secretary (AS), Special Secretary (SS) and equivalent levels in the Government of India and its organizations, DoPT have formulated a staffing Scheme. A total of 38 Civil Services including the three All India Services viz IAS, IPS, IFS are participants under this Scheme.\n\nSimilar to the CSS, there are two Non-CSSs under the Government of India one each controlled by the MoEF and DoPT.\nAll posts to be filled up by IFS officers in the autonomous bodies under the control of the Ministry viz ICFRE, Dehradun; Wild Life Institute of India, Dehradun and Indian Institute of Forest Management, Bhopal; Wild-Life Crime Control Bureau, Central Pollution Control Board, Central Zoo Authority etc. are called as non-CSS posts. Isolated posts under various Departments and Ministries in Government of India and the posts of Commissions, Autonomous Bodies, Authorities, Trusts, Boards, Societies, etc. constitute non-CSS of DoPT.\n\nAn IFS officer may also be deputed for service under a company, association, corporation which is wholly or substantially owned or controlled by a State Government, a Municipal Corporation or Local Body. Appointment is done by the State Government.\n\nAn IFS officer may also be deputed for service under international organisation by Central Government in consultation with State Government of india.\n\nOfficers are recruited via an open competitive examination conducted by the UPSC and then trained for about two years by the Central Government at Indira Gandhi National Forest Academy. Their services are placed under various State cadres and joint cadres, even though they have the mandate to serve both under the State and Central Governments.\n\nOn acceptance to the IFS, new entrants undergo a probationary period (and are referred to as Officer Trainees). Training begins at the Lal Bahadur Shastri National Academy of Administration in Mussoorie, where members of many elite civil services are trained for the period of 15 weeks.\n\nOn completion of which they go to the Indira Gandhi National Forest Academy at Dehradun, for a more intensive training in a host of subjects important to Forestry, Wildlife Management, Biodiversity, Environment Protection, Climate Change, Forest Policies and Laws, Remote Sensing and GIS, Forest Dwellers and Scheduled Tribes. After completion of their training, the officers are awarded a master's degree in Science (Forestry) of Forest Research Institute. The officers are taught more than 56 subjects of life sciences in these two years.\n\nThey are also taught Weapon handling, Horse riding, Motor Vehicle Training, Swimming, Forest and Wildlife Crime Detection. They also go on attachments with different government bodies and institutes such as Indian Military Academy, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel National Police Academy, Wildlife Institute of India, Bombay Natural History Society etc. They also undertake extensive tours both in India and abroad.After completing training at the academy, candidates go through a year of on-the-job field training in the state to which he or she is assigned, during which they are posted as Assistant Conservators of Forests/ Assistant Deputy Conservators of Forest or Deputy Conservator of Forests. After a total of four years of service in the junior scale, which includes the professional training phase and foundation course, officers are appointed to the Senior Time Scale and are entitled to be posted as Deputy Conservators of Forests/Divisional Forest Officers (DFO) in charge of districts/forest divisions.\n\nThe Union Government announced a new cadre allocation policy for the All India Services in August 2017, touting it as a policy to ensure national integration of the bureaucracy as officers and ensure All-India character of the services. Under the new policy, the existing 26 cadres have been divided into five zones in the new policy by the Department of Personnel and Training of Government of India.\n\nUnder the new policy, a candidate has to first give his/her choice in the descending order of preference from amongst the various Zones. Subsequently, the candidate has to indicate one preference of cadre from each preferred zone. The candidate indicates his second cadre preference for every preferred zone subsequently. The process continues till a preference for all the cadres is indicated by the candidate. The preference for the zones/cadres remains in the same order and no change is permitted.\n\nOfficers continue to work in the cadre they are allotted or are deputed to the Government of India.\nTill 2008 there was no system of preference of state cadre by the candidates; the candidates, if not placed in the insider vacancy of their home states, were allotted to different states in alphabetic order of the roster, beginning with the letters A, H, M, T for that particular year. For example, if in a particular year the roster begins from 'A', which means the first candidate on the roster will go to the Andhra Pradesh state cadre of IFS, the next one to Bihar, and subsequently to Chhattisgarh, Gujarat and so on in alphabetical order. The next year the roster starts from 'H', for either Haryana or Himachal Pradesh (if it has started from Haryana on the previous occasion when it all started from 'H', then this time it would start from Himachal Pradesh). This highly intricate system, in vogue since the mid-1980s, had ensured that officers from different states are placed all over India.\n\nThe system of permanent State cadres has also resulted in wide disparities in the kind of professional exposure for officers, when we compare officers in small and big and also developed and backward states. Changes of state cadre was permitted on grounds of marriage to an All India Service officer of another state cadre or under other exceptional circumstances. The officer may go to their home state cadre on deputation for a limited period, after which one has to invariably return to the cadre allotted to him or her.\n\nFrom 2008 to 2017 IFS officers were allotted to State cadres at the beginning of their service. There was one cadre for each Indian state, except for two joint cadres: Assam–Meghalaya and Arunachal Pradesh–Goa–Mizoram–Union Territories (AGMUT). The \"insider-outsider ratio\" (ratio of officers who were posted in their home states) is maintained as 1:2, with one-third of the direct recruits as 'insiders' from the same state. The rest were posted as outsiders according to the 'roster' in states other than their home states, as per their preference.\n\nShri P. Srinivas\n\nShri Sanjay Singh\n\nDr. S. Manikandan\n\n\n\n"}

The band attempted to continue with alternate singers, but remained largely dormant until this show. The winner of the series, J. D. Fortune, was announced on Tuesday, September 20, 2005 and became the band's new lead singer. Following the series, on November 29, 2005, the band released the studio album \"Switch\" with J.D. Fortune on lead vocals.\n\nContestants were housed in the Paramour Mansion, and squared off in a singing contest featuring well-known rock songs. Each week, viewers voted for their favorite contestant. The three contestants with the fewest votes performed an INXS song the following night. The members of the band then decided which contestant would be sent home, with lead guitarist Tim Farriss invoking the show's catchphrase \"you're just not right for our band, INXS\" to the departing contestant.\n\nThe show originally appeared three nights a week on CBS. The format consisted of a half-hour behind-the-scenes episode on Monday, a one-hour performance episode on Tuesday and a half-hour elimination episode on Wednesday. However, on August 3, 2005, CBS announced the behind-the-scenes episode would move to Sunday nights on VH1 effective August 7, 2005 due to low ratings in the United States. As the show continued, the ratings improved. This prompted the expansion of the Wednesday results show to one hour for the duration of its run. The winner, J. D. Fortune, was announced on Tuesday, September 20, 2005.\n\nRunner-up Marty Casey and his Chicago-based band Lovehammers were invited to open for INXS on their 2006 tour.\n\nThe show was executive produced by \"Survivor\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Mark Burnett and was hosted by Brooke Burke and Jane's Addiction guitarist Dave Navarro. Other producers were David Goffin (\"American Idol\", \"On the Lot\", \"Eco-Challenge\", \"Combat Missions\"), Lisa Hennessy (\"Eco-Challenge\") and INXS managers David Edwards and Michael Murchison were executive producers. Conrad Riggs was co-executive producer. The show was Directed by Michael A. Simon\n\nFive musicians made up the house band that backed the 15 contestants during the show. The house band was made up of Paul Mirkovich, Jim McGorman, Nate Morton, Sasha Krivstov, and Rafael Moreira.\n\nA.J. Dickerson and Scott C. Wilson were among the many video editors of the Tuesday performance shows. Scott C. Wilson did the final mixes on the Tuesday performance shows.\n\nThree contestants reached the finale: Mig Ayesa, Marty Casey, and J. D. Fortune. Fortune was considered by many the underdog of the three as he established a renegade image during the competition, while Casey was considered the favorite due to his popularity with voters. In the finale, Ayesa, Casey, and Fortune each selected a song that was performed previously on the show. Ayesa chose Queen's \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", Casey chose Pink Floyd's \"Wish You Were Here\", and Fortune chose The Rolling Stones', \"You Can't Always Get What You Want\". Based on these performances, INXS eliminated Ayesa.\n\nWith the competition down to Casey and Fortune, each performed an INXS song with, for the first time on the show, all five members of INXS. Casey performed \"Don't Change\" and Fortune performed \"What You Need.\" INXS announced Fortune was the winner.\n\nDuring the competition, Casey and Fortune performed two original songs that became fan favorites. Both songs would receive multiple encores during the competition. Casey's original song was called \"Trees\" and was described by host Dave Navarro as a song that he could imagine being heard on the radio \"today\". In fact, the song received some radioplay as a result of its exposure on the show.\n\nAt one point in the competition, the remaining eight contestants were challenged to write lyrics to melody written by Andrew Farriss. They were divided into two teams of four. When Fortune did not see eye to eye with his team (which included Casey), he decided to venture out on his own and write his own lyrics. At first, Fortune's move was considered to have jeopardized his chances of winning the competition (since it was perceived he couldn't work in a team), but it was this move that resulted in his creation of the lyrics of \"Pretty Vegas.\" This song became a favorite of INXS and played a major role in Fortune winning the competition. It also became the first single from their new album \"Switch\".\n\nThe following is a list of songs performed by each finalist during the competition. The number represents the week in which the song was performed. Except for the second week, each week one finalist was asked to perform an encore performance of the song they performed the night before, noted as an \"Encore Performance\".\n\nEach week the three finalists who had the lowest total audience votes were asked to perform an INXS song of the band's choice, noted as a \"Bottom 3 Performance\". This was the case for every week except for the first and last ones. After everyone performed one non-INXS song in the first and last episodes, the band chose one contestant to be eliminated out of the entire group. There was no voting for the bottom three.\n\nIn the seventh week two contestants were given the chance to perform original songs (Mig & Deanna.)\n\nFor the ninth week performance episode each contestant performed an original song as well as a non-INXS song. In the elimination episode that week all the remaining contestants plus Dave Navarro performed as an ensemble with INXS on their new track Us, as the opening act for that week's encore.\n\nFor the tenth week performance two songs were chosen by INXS to be performed by each of the remaining contestants.\n\nThe ages given below were the ages of the contestants during the recording of the show.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe show spawned a soundtrack entitled \"A Night at the Mayan Theatre\", containing the performance from each contestant from the premiere episode, as well as two bonus tracks of Jordis Unga performing \"The Man Who Sold the World\" and Mig Ayesa performing \"Baby, I Love Your Way\".\n\nThe list of the contestants' performances is:\n\nA DVD titled \"Rock Star: INXS The DVD\" was released on 29 November 2005 containing selected performances by the final six contestants (J. D. Fortune, Marty Casey, Mig Ayesa, Suzie McNeil, Jordis Unga, and Ty Taylor) as well as the post-finale mini-concert by INXS & J. D., short behind-the-scenes footage, and extras including the contestants' casting interviews and a photo slideshow: The DVD when RIAA Certified Gold in 2005.\n\n\n\n\n\nINXS released the album Switch following the series with J.D Fortune on lead vocals and went on tour. \"Switch\" was released on 29 November 2005 and peaked at number 17 on the \"Billboard\" 200, and appeared on the Canadian Hot 100 and Top Internet Albums charts at numbers two and 56, respectively. The album has sold 391,000 copies in the U.S. since release. The single \"Pretty Vegas\" received gold certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on 26 January 2006. In Canada, both the album and the single, Pretty Vegas, went platinum and reached number one on the charts. The album received platinum certification in Dec. 2005 by the Canadian Recording Industry Association (CRIA), and Canadian sales of the album have exceeded 170,000 units. The album went platinum and peaked at number 18 on the ARIA Charts.\n\nBy the end of the competition, CBS was encouraging musicians to submit audition tapes for consideration in a second Rock Star competition. Speculation on which band would be at the center of the competition varied. Van Halen and Alice in Chains were reportedly considered, but both denied the rumours. However, in March 2006, it was announced that the new season would focus on finding a lead singer for a new group entitled Supernova, featuring Mötley Crüe drummer Tommy Lee, former Metallica bassist Jason Newsted, and former Guns N' Roses guitarist Gilby Clarke. The second season of Rock Star premiered on July 5, 2006 on CBS in the United States. Once again, it was hosted by Dave Navarro and Brooke Burke.\n\n"}
{"id": "2172363", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2172363", "title": "South Kasai", "text": "South Kasai\n\nSouth Kasai () was an unrecognised secessionist state within the Republic of the Congo (the modern-day Democratic Republic of the Congo) which was semi-independent between 1960 and 1962. Initially proposed as only a province, South Kasai sought full autonomy in similar circumstances to the much larger neighbouring state of Katanga, to its south, during the political turmoil arising from the independence of the Belgian Congo known as the Congo Crisis. Unlike Katanga, however, South Kasai did not explicitly declare full independence from the Republic of the Congo or reject Congolese sovereignty.\n\nThe South Kasaian leader and main advocate, Albert Kalonji, who had represented a faction of the nationalist movement (the \"Mouvement National Congolais-Kalonji\" or MNC-K) before decolonisation, exploited ethnic tensions between his own ethnic group, the Baluba, and the Bena Lulua to create a Luba-focused state in the group's traditional heartland in the south-eastern parts of the Kasai region. As sectarian violence broke out across the country, the state declared its secession from the Congo on 9 August 1960 and its government and called for the Baluba living in the rest of the Congo to return to their \"homeland\". Kalonji was appointed President. Although the South Kasaian government claimed to form an autonomous part of a federal Congo-wide state, it exercised a degree of regional autonomy and even produced its own constitution and postage stamps. The state, supported by foreign powers, particularly Belgium, and funded by diamond exports, managed numerous crises, including those caused by the large emigration of Luba refugees, but became increasingly militarist and repressive.\n\nSoon after its secession, South Kasaian and Congolese troops clashed after the Congolese central government ordered an offensive against it. The resulting campaign, planned to be the first act of a larger action against Katanga, was accompanied by widespread massacres of Baluba and a refugee crisis termed a genocide by some contemporaries. The state was rapidly overrun by Congolese troops. The violence in the suppression of Kasai provided much legitimacy to Joseph Kasa-Vubu's deposition of Patrice Lumumba from the office of Prime Minister in late 1960 and Lumumba's later arrest and assassination. As a result, South Kasai remained on relatively good terms with the new Congolese government from 1961. Its leaders, including Kalonji himself, served in both the South Kasaian government and the Congolese parliament. South Kasai continued to exercise quasi-independence while Congolese and United Nations troops were able to move through the territory without conflict with the South Kasaian gendarmerie. In April 1961, Kalonji took the royal title \"Mulopwe\" (\"King of the Baluba\") to tie the state more closely to the pre-colonial Luba Empire. The act divided the South Kasaian authorities and Kalonji was disavowed by the majority of South Kasai's parliamentary representatives in Léopoldville. In December 1961, Kalonji was arrested on a legal pretext in Léopoldville and imprisoned, and Ferdinand Kazadi assumed power as acting head of state. UN and Congolese troops occupied South Kasai. In September 1962, shortly after his escape from prison and return to South Kasai, Kalonji was ousted by a military coup d'état which forced him into exile and brought the secession to an end.\n\nThe end of South Kasai's secession is usually held to be either December 1961, the date of Kalonji's arrest, or October 1962 with the anti-Kalonji coup d'état and final arrival of government troops.\n\nEuropean colonial rule in the Congo began in the late 19th century. King Leopold II of Belgium, frustrated by his country's lack of international power and prestige, attempted to persuade the Belgian government to support colonial expansion around the then-largely unexplored Congo Basin. The Belgian government's ambivalence about the idea led Leopold to eventually create the colony on his own account. With support from a number of Western countries, who viewed Leopold as a useful buffer between rival colonial powers, Leopold achieved international recognition for a personal colony, the Congo Free State, in 1885. The Luba Empire, the largest regional power in the Kasai region, was annexed into the new state in 1889. By the turn of the century, the violence of Free State officials against indigenous Congolese and the ruthless system of economic extraction had led to intense diplomatic pressure on Belgium to take official control of the country, which it did in 1908, creating the Belgian Congo.\n\nBelgian rule in the Congo was based around the \"colonial trinity\" (\"trinité coloniale\") of state, missionary and private company interests. The privileging of Belgian commercial interests meant that large amounts of capital flowed into the Congo and that individual regions became specialised. On many occasions, the interests of the government and private enterprise became closely tied and the state helped companies break strikes and remove other barriers imposed by the indigenous population. The country was split into hierarchically-organised administrative subdivisions, and run uniformly according to a set \"native policy\" (\"politique indigène\") – in contrast to the British and the French, who generally favoured the system of indirect rule whereby traditional leaders were retained in positions of authority under colonial oversight.\n\nBefore the start of the colonial period, the region of South Kasai formed part of the Luba Empire, a federation of local kingdoms with a degree of cultural uniformity. During the 17th and 18th centuries, the Baluba spread across large parts of the Kasai-Katanga savannah along the Kasai river basin and eventually developed into a number of ethnic subgroups, notably the Luba-Kasai and the Luba-Katanga. Although never united into a single centralised state, the groups retained a degree of emotional attachment based around shared origin myths and cultural practices. Other groups, like the Songye and the Kanyok, also had long histories in the Kasai region.\n\nOne of the major legacies of colonial rule in Kasai was the arbitrary redivision of the population into new ethnic groups. Despite the shared language (Tshiluba) and culture of the two groups, colonial administrators believed the inhabitants of the Lulua river area to be ethnically different from the Baluba and dubbed them the Bena Lulua. The colonists believed the Baluba to be more intelligent, hardworking and open to new ideas than the Bena Lulua who were believed to be more reactionary and stupid. As a result, from the 1930s, the state began to treat the two groups differently and applied different policies to each and promoted the Baluba to positions above other ethnicities.\n\nDuring the 1950s when the Belgians began to fear that the rise of a powerful Luba elite would become a threat to colonial rule, the administration began to support Lulua organisations. This further contributed to the growing ethnic polarisation between the two groups. In 1952, an organisation called the \"Lulua Frères\" (Lulua Brothers) was established to campaign for socio-economic advancement of the Lulua group and became an unofficial representative of the Bena Lulua. In 1959, Luba-Lulua animosity was brought to a head by the discovery of a colonial proposal to move Luba farmers out of Lulua land to the less fertile land on Luba territory. As a result, hostility increased and violent clashes broke out. In August 1959, Luba demonstrations against the plan which were violently repressed by the colonial military and police.\n\nAn anti-colonial Pan-African and nationalist movement developed in the Belgian Congo during the 1950s, primarily among the \"évolué\" class (the urbanised black bourgeoisie). The movement was divided into a number of parties and groups which were broadly divided on ethnic and geographical lines and opposed to one another. The largest, the \"Mouvement National Congolais\" (MNC), was a united front organisation dedicated to achieving independence \"within a reasonable\" time. It was created around a charter which was signed by, among others, Patrice Lumumba, Cyrille Adoula and Joseph Ileo. Lumumba became a leading figure and by the end of 1959, the party claimed to have 58,000 members. However, many found the MNC was too moderate. A number of other parties emerged, distinguished by their radicalism, support for federalism or centralism and affiliation to certain ethnic groupings. The MNC's main rival was the \"Alliance des Bakongo\" (ABAKO) led by Joseph Kasa-Vubu, a more radical party supported among the Kongo people in the north, and Moise Tshombe's \"Confédération des Associations Tribales du Katanga\" (CONAKAT), a strongly federalist party in the southern Katanga Province.\n\nAlthough it was the largest of the African nationalist parties, the MNC had many different factions within it that took differing stances on a number of issues. It was increasingly polarised between moderate \"évolués\" and the more radical mass membership. A radical and federalist faction headed by Ileo and Albert Kalonji split away in July 1959, but failed to induce mass defections by other MNC members. The dissident faction became known as the MNC-Kalonji (MNC-K), while the majority group became the MNC-Lumumba (MNC-L). The split divided the party's support base into those who endured with Lumumba, chiefly in the Stanleyville region in the north-east, and those who backed the MNC-K, popular in the south and among Kalonji's own ethnic group, the Baluba. The MNC-K later formed a cartel with ABAKO and the \"Parti Solidaire Africain\" (PSA) to call for a united, but federalised, Congo.\n\nThe 1960 elections degenerated into an \"anti-Baluba plebiscite\" in Kasai as the Luba MNC-K succeeded in obtaining a plurality but failed to take control of the provincial government. Instead, Lumumba promoted a Lulua candidate, Barthélemy Mukenge, as provincial president while Kalonji was denied an important ministerial portfolio in Lumumba's government. Kalonji refused Lumumba's offer of the Agriculture portfolio. Mukenge attempted to form a government of unity, even offering MNC-K member Joseph Ngalula a place in his cabinet. Ngalula rejected the offer and on 14 June the MNC-K resolved to establish an alternative government under his leadership. Kalonji did not recognise this government as having any authority. \n\nThe Kalonjists, who felt rejected and marginalised by the central government, began supporting alternative parties. Among them, the Kalonjists supported Tshombe's CONAKAT party in nearby Katanga which, because of its strongly federalist stance, opposed to Lumumba's conception of a strong central government based in the capital Léopoldville. As part of this, the Kalonjists supported CONAKAT against their main local rivals, the \"Association Générale des Baluba du Katanga\" (BALUBAKAT) party led by Jason Sendwe, which, although it represented the Baluba of Katanga Province, was in favour of centralism. The Kalonjists, who believed themselves to be acting on behalf of all the Luba-Kasai, created an animosity between the Luba-Kasai and the Luba-Katanga but also failed to gain the full support of CONAKAT, much of which had racial prejudice against the Baluba and supported only the \"authentic Katangese\".\n\nThe Republic of the Congo received independence on 30 June 1960 under a joint government of Kasa-Vubu and Lumumba. The Chamber of the Léopoldville Parliament had convened one week prior to review Lumumba's cabinet and give it a vote of confidence. During the session, Kalonji, in his capacity as an elected deputy, criticised the proposed cabinet, expressing dissatisfaction that his party had not been consulted in its formation and declaring that he was proud not to be included in an \"anti-Baluba\" and \"anti-Batshoke\" government which had shown contempt for the wishes of Kasai's people. He also stated his intentions to encourage the Baluba and Batshoke to refrain from participating in the government and to take his own steps to form a sovereign state centered in Bakwanga. \n\nOn 26 June, MNC-K officials petitioned the Léopoldville Parliament to peacefully divide the Province of Kasai along the lines suggested by Kalonji. The motion, which would have required the modification of the Congo's new constitution (\"Loi fondamentale\"), was received by a legislature divided between Lumumba and Kasa-Vubu factions and no agreement could be reached.\n\nIn the aftermath of independence, ethnic tensions flared up across the country, much of it directed against the Baluba, and a number of violent clashes occurred. On 3 July the central government ordered the arrest of the rival MNC-K Kasai government, precipitating unrest in Luluabourg. Despite rejecting earlier proposals for Luba repatriations to the province in January 1960, the Kalonjists made an official call to the Baluba across the Congo to return to their Kasaian \"homeland\" on 16 July. Initially, the Kalonjists envisaged the division of Kasai Province in two in order to allow for the creation of a quasi-autonomous MNC-K and Luba-dominated provincial government. The proposed province was termed the Federated State of South Kasai (\"État fédératif du Sud-Kasaï\"). Rapidly, however, Kalonji realised that the chaos in the rest of the Congo could be used to secede unilaterally and declare full local independence. This decision was further re-enforced by the full secession of the State of Katanga (\"État du Katanga\"), led by Tshombe, on 11 July 1960. Kalonji visited Katanga at the start of August 1960, shortly after its secession, where, on the 8 August, he declared that Kasai \"must be divided at all costs.\"\n\nOn 9 August 1960, Kalonji, still in Katanga, declared the region of south-eastern Kasai to be the new Mining State of South Kasai (\"État minier du Sud-Kasaï\") or Autonomous State of South Kasai (\"État autonome du Sud-Kasaï\").\n\nUnlike Katanga, however, South Kasai's secession did not explicitly mean the rejection of its position within the Republic of the Congo. Rather, it resembled the self-declared local governments in Équateur Province. The \"Autonomous State\" title was chosen in order to re-enforce the impression that the secession was not a rejection of Congolese sovereignty, but the creation of a federally-governed region of the Congo. The secession had some support among journalists, intellectuals and politicians in Léopoldville, with one newspaper calling it \"a model by which the many new states now mushrooming in the Congo might form a new federation\". In practice South Kasai had considerably more independence than a regular province and, by mandating its own federated powers unilaterally, was effectively seceding from the Congo. It also did not forward any taxes to the central government and locals—drawing a comparison to the secessionist state to the south—sometimes referred to it as \"Little Katanga\". MNC-K deputies also initially refused to sit in the Congolese Parliament in Léopoldville.\n\nKalonji was declared President and Joseph Ngalula Prime Minister. Although the Luba-Kasai had never lived in a single state before, Kalonji was able to gain the broad support of the Luba chiefs for the secession. He was able to portray the secession internationally as the result of the persecution and the failure of the Congolese government to sufficiently protect the Baluba in the rest of the Congo. At its height, South Kasai numbered around a million inhabitants and of territory, though its borders frequently changed. The state's capital was Bakwanga.\n\nOnce established in power, Kalonji positioned himself personally as \"big man\" and patron from whom state power originated. Tribal leaders from Luba and other ethnic groups enjoyed a close, client-like relationship with Kalonji himself and received preferential treatment in exchange for services rendered. In particular, Kalonji was reliant on tribal leaders to mobilise paramilitaries to support the South Kasaian army. Governance of South Kasai was complicated by the dynamic Luba politics in which it was embedded. Tensions rose between Kalonji and Ngalula, who had different ideas for how the state was to be run; Kalonji wanted the government to be based in tradition and relied on customary chiefs, while Ngalula preferred a democratic system and worked with the intellectual elite. South Kasai had five different governments in the first few months of its existence.\nThe immediate internal problems faced by South Kasai were large number of unsettled Luba refugees and internal dissent from non-Luba minorities. The state was able to direct money from diamond exporting and foreign support to fund public services which allowed Luba refugees to be settled in employment. Social services were \"relatively well-run\". State revenue was estimated to total $30,000,000 annually. The state produced three constitutions, with the first being promulgated in November and the last on 12 July 1961. The July constitution transformed the state into the Federated State of South Kasai (\"État fédéré du Sud-Kasaï\"), declaring the state itself both \"sovereign and democratic\" but also part of a hypothetical \"Federal Republic of the Congo\". The constitution also provided for a bicameral legislature, with a lower chamber composed of all national deputies, senators, and provincial assemblymen elected in constituencies within South Kasai's territory, and an upper chamber filled by traditional chiefs. The state had its own flag and coat of arms, published its own official journal, the \"Moniteur de l'État Autonome du Sud-Kasaï\", and even produced its own postage stamps and vehicle registration plates. Unlike Katanga, South Kasai maintained no diplomatic missions abroad. The Congolese franc was retained as the state's currency.\n\nThe South Kasaian army or gendarmerie grew from just 250 members at its inception to nearly 3,000 by 1961. It was led by 22-year-old \"General\" Floribert Dinanga with the assistance of nine European officers. In 1961, the military led a campaign to expand the size of the state's territory at the expense of neighbouring ethnic groups. Despite receiving some support from Belgium, the gendarmerie was poorly equipped and constantly low on supplies and ammunition.\n\nAs government authority in South Kasai was consolidated, the regime became increasingly militaristic and authoritarian. Non-Luba groups were increasingly marginalised. Political opponents were killed or driven into exile, including Ngalula, who had a falling out with Kalonji in July 1961. Non-Luba groups in the region, especially the Kanyok, fought a constant but low-level insurgency against the South Kasaian government.\n\nKalonji went to great lengths to secure international recognition and support for the state of South Kasai. The former colonial power, Belgium, distrusted the Congolese central government and supported both the governments of South Kasai and Katanga. Like Katanga, South Kasai had important mineral deposits, including diamond fields, and Belgian companies had large sums of money tied up in mines in the area. A Belgian company, , was the state's principal supporter and received concessions from South Kasai in exchange for financial support. The comparatively large income from these companies meant that South Kasai was able to support significant public services and cope with large numbers of internally-displaced Luba refugees. In the context of the Cold War, Kalonji was supported by Western powers and moderates in the Congolese government who viewed him as both a moderate pro-Westerner and anticommunist. Although both Katanga and South Kasai were supported by South Africa, France and the Central African Federation, neither state ever received any form of official diplomatic recognition.\n\nAfter the coup d'état which removed Lumumba from power, Kalonji tried to cultivate good relations with the Congolese government. General Joseph-Désiré Mobutu, in particular, was able to use South Kasai for the execution of his political opponents and dissident Lumumbists including Jean-Pierre Finant. Such activity led the secessionist state to be nicknamed \"the national butcher's yard\".\n\nBecause of the importance of the Luba ethnicity to South Kasai, Kalonji used his support from the traditional Luba tribal authorities to have himself declared \"Mulopwe\". The title, \"Mulopwe\" (usually translated as \"King\" or \"Emperor\"), was extremely symbolic because it was the title employed by the rulers of the pre-colonial Luba Empire and had been disused since the 1880s. By taking it, along with the extra name \"Ditunga\" (\"homeland\"), Kalonji was able to closely tie himself and the South Kasaian state to the Luba Empire to increase its legitimacy in the eyes of the Baluba. In order to avoid accusations of impropriety, the title was bestowed on Kalonji's father on 12 April 1961, who then immediately abdicated in favour of his son. With the accession of Kalonji to the title of \"Mulopwe\" on 16 July, the state's title changed to the Federated Kingdom of South Kasai (\"Royaume fédéré du Sud-Kasaï\").\n\nKalonji's accession to the position of \"Mulopwe\" was heavily criticised even by many Luba in South Kasai. Kalonji remained popular among some groups, but lost the support of the South Kasaian \"évolués\" who saw his elevation as flagrant opportunism. Soon after his elevation, Kalonji was publicly condemned and disavowed by 10 of South Kasai's 13 representatives in the Léopoldville Parliament, beginning the disintegration of the secessionist state.\n\nWhen South Kasai seceded, government troops from the \"Armée Nationale Congolaise\" (ANC) were already fighting Katangese troops in the Kasai region. South Kasai held important railway junctions needed by the Congolese army for its campaign in Katanga, and therefore soon became an important objective. South Kasai also had important mineral wealth which the central government was anxious to return to the Congo. The central government also misunderstood the South Kasaian position, believing that, like Katanga, the region had declared full independence from the Congo and rejected Congolese sovereignty.\nInitially, Lumumba hoped that the United Nations (UN), which sent a multi-national peacekeeping force to the Congo in July 1960, would help the central government suppress both Katangese and South Kasaian secessions. The UN was reluctant to do so, however, considering the secessions to be internal political matters and its own mission to be maintaining basic law and order. Rejected by both the UN and United States, Lumumba sought military support from the communist Soviet Union. Within days of the secession and with Soviet logistical support, 2,000 ANC troops launched a major offensive against South Kasai. The attack was successful. On 27 August, ANC soldiers arrived in Bakwanga.\n\nDuring the course of the offensive, the ANC became involved in ethnic violence between the Baluba and Bena Lulua. When government troops arrived in Bakwanga, they released Lulua detainees from prison and began requisitioning civilian vehicles. When David Odia, the South Kasai Minister of Public Works, protested, soldiers beat him and fatally injured him. Many Baluba first fled in terror, but then began resisting with home-made shotguns. As a result, the ANC perpetrated a number of large massacres of Luba civilians. In September, Dag Hammarskjöld, the UN Secretary-General who had recently deployed a large peacekeeping force to the Congo, referred to the massacres as \"a case of incipient genocide\". The Baluba were also attacked by the Katangese from the south. In the ensuring massacres, in which ANC or Katangese troops often participated, around 3,000 Baluba were killed. The violence of the advance caused an exodus of many thousands of Luba civilians who fled their homes to escape the fighting; more than 35,000 went to refugee camps in Élisabethville (the capital of Katanga) alone. As many as 100,000 sought refuge in Bakwanga. Diseases, notably kwashiorkor but also malaria, smallpox and anemia, were widespread and reached \"epidemic proportions\" among Luba refugees between October and December 1960. The World Health Organization sent one million small pox vaccines to South Kasai to alleviate the problem. The epidemic had been preceded by widespread famine which by December was killing an estimated 200 people daily. The UN appealed to its member states for relief, and by late January government and private aid had reduced mortality by 75 percent. Further assistance in the form of an emergency food airlift, additional medical personnel, and seeds from the Food and Agriculture Organization ensured that the famine was almost entirely resolved by March 1961. \n\nAllegations of genocide and brutality by the ANC were used to provide legitimacy to Kasa-Vubu's dismissal of Lumumba, with the support of Mobutu, in September 1960. In the aftermath of the campaign, the South Kasaian state was able to provide substantial aid to its refugees, many of whom were resettled in homes and jobs. Nevertheless, the invasion caused considerable disruption to the local economy; by December the number of diamonds cut by Forminière and the number of people it employed both had fallen by thousands.\n\nDespite the occupation of South Kasai, the South Kasaian state was not dismantled and co-existed with the rest of the Congo. Congolese delegates, as well as ANC and UN troops were generally able to move around the territory without conflict with the South Kasaian authorities while their sporadic campaign against Katangese forces continued. A UN-sponsored ceasefire in September 1960 gave pause to the Luba-Lulua conflict, but by November Kalonji's forces had broken the truce. Throughout much of the period, the South Kasaian gendarmerie fought with Kanyok and Lulua militias across the region while local ethnic violence persisted.\n\nIn mid-1961, conferences were held at Coquilhatville (modern-day Mbandaka) and later in Antananarivo, Madagascar to attempt to broker a peaceful reconciliation between the secessionist factions and the central government in the face of a rebel government in the Eastern Congo led by Antoine Gizenga. It was believed that, with Lumumba dead, it might be possible to create a federal constitution that could reconcile the three parties. The agreements instead led to more uncertainty. The ousting of Ngalula—the chief organiser of the South Kasai state—in July hastened internal collapse. He established his own political party, the Democratic Union, to oppose the Kalonjists. Later that month Parliament reconvened with Kalonji and the other South Kasain deputies in attendance. A new Congolese central government was formed on 2 August with Ngalula as Minister of Education, and Kalonji went back to South Kasai. In late October 1961 Kalonji and several Lulua leaders made a symbolic union in an attempt to end the Luba-Lulua tribal conflict.\n\nOn 2 December 1961, Kalonji was accused by another deputy, the communist Christophe Gbenye, of having ordered corporal punishment against a political prisoner in South Kasai. Parliament voted to remove Kalonji's parliamentary immunity and he was taken into custody by the ANC in Léopoldville. A delegation of around 400 Luba tribal elders sent to Léopoldville to protest were also briefly arrested. Mobutu and General Victor Lundula visited Bakwanga soon afterwards. Ferdinand Kazadi assumed power as acting head of state of South Kasai.\n\nOn 9 March 1962, the recently re-convened Léopoldville Parliament, under Prime Minister Cyrille Adoula, agreed to modify the Constitution and gave South Kasai official provincial status. In April 1962, UN troops were ordered to occupy South Kasai as part of Secretary-General U Thant's new aggressive stance against secession following Hammarskjöld's death. In Léopoldville, Kalonji was sentenced to five years' imprisonment. On 7 September, however, Kalonji escaped from prison and returned to South Kasai where he hoped to regain an official position in local elections and, at the head of a government, regain his immunity.\n\nAs dissatisfaction with the secession grew, Ngalula and other South Kasaian émigrés in Léopoldville plotted to overthrow the regime in Bakwanga. In September 1962, the Léopoldville government appointed Albert Kankolongo, a former minister in Kalonji's government, as Special Commissioner (\"commissaire extraordinaire\") for South Kasai, giving him full military and civil power, to dismantle the local state. Ngalula approached Kankolongo to lead a mutiny and coup d'état against Kalonji.\n\nOn the night of 29–30 September 1962, military commanders in South Kasai, led by Kankolongo, launched a coup d'état in Bakwanga against the Kalonjist regime. An appeal was broadcast over Radio Bakwanga to all officers of the South Kasaian gendarmerie to support the central government with the promise that they would integrated into the ANC at their current rank and pay. Kalonji and General Dinanga were placed under house arrest, while the other South Kasain ministers were imprisoned in a single home. Kalonji and Dinanga escaped a few days later; the former took a lorry to Katanga. Kankolongo reacted by immediately flying out the remaining ministers to Léopoldville. On 5 October 1962, central government troops again arrived in Bakwanga to support the mutineers and help suppress the last Kalonjist loyalists, marking the end of the secession. Kalonji took up residence in Kamina and attempted to meet Tshombe, but was rebuffed by Katangese Minister of Interior Godefroid Munongo. He then fled to Paris before settling in Barcelona in Francisco Franco's Spain.\n\nIn October 1962, South Kasai returned to the Republic of the Congo. The State of Katanga continued to hold out against the central government until it too collapsed in January 1963 after UN forces began to take a more aggressive stance under Thant. As a compromise, South Kasai was one of the 21 provinces formally established by the federalist constitution of 1964. As the Mobutu regime launched a centralist restructuring of the Congolese state from 1965, South Kasai was one of the few provinces which were retained. The province was later restructured to include new territory in Kabinda and Sankuru Districts and renamed Eastern Kasai (\"Kasaï-Oriental\").\n\nThe majority of the South Kasaian soldiers were integrated into the ANC after the dissolution of the state but nearly 2,000 loyalists went into hiding to await Kalonji's possible restoration. The rebels were led by General Mwanzambala and fought a guerrilla war against the new provincial government until 1963 when they also accepted integration into the ANC. Soon after the end of the secession, the city of Bakwanga was renamed Mbuji-Mayi after the local river in an attempt to signify a Luba intra-ethnicity reconciliation. Regardless, violence among Luba factions lasted through 1964, and a political solution was not reached until 1965 with the election of J. Munkamba as Provincial President of South Kasai.\n\nIn 1965, Mobutu launched a second coup d'état against the central government and took personal emergency powers. Once established as the sole source of political power, Mobutu gradually consolidated his control in the Congo. The number of provinces was reduced, and their autonomy curtailed, resulting in a highly centralised state. Mobutu increasingly placed his supporters in the remaining positions of importance. In 1967, to illustrate his legitimacy, he created a party, the Popular Movement of the Revolution (MPR), which until 1990 was the nation's only legal political party under Mobutu's revised constitution. In 1971, the state was renamed Zaire and efforts were made to remove all colonial influences. He also nationalised the remaining foreign-owned economic assets in the country. Over time Zaire was increasingly characterised by widespread croneyism, corruption and economic mismanagement. Dissatisfaction with the regime in \"Kasaï-Oriental\" was particularly strong.\n\nThe issues of federalism, ethnicity in politics and state centralisation were not resolved by the crisis and partly contributed to a decline in support for the concept of the state among Congolese people. Mobutu was strongly in favour of centralisation and one of his first acts, in 1965, were to reunify provinces and abolish much of their independent legislative capacity. Subsequent loss of faith in central government is one of the reasons that the Congo has been labeled as a failed state, and has contributed violence by factions advocating ethnic and localised federalism.\n\n\n\n"}

Production for the album took place during 2005 to 2006 at several recording studios and was handled by Dr. Dre, Swizz Beatz, Mark Batson, DJ Scratch, J Dilla, Timbaland, Mr. Porter, will.i.am, Sha Money XL, JellyRoll, Black Jeruz, Nisan Stewart and DJ Green Lantern. The official cover artwork was revealed on May 7, 2006. The tracklisting was released on the 15th.\n\nThe album debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 making it Busta's first number one album, selling 209,000 copies in its first week, and certified gold by RIAA.\n\nIt was released on June 13, 2006 & is his first album without his Signature Dreadlocks he had for most of his career as he transitioned a new look with a shaved head. It is his only release under Dr. Dre's Aftermath Entertainment record label. Full production of the album came from Dr. Dre, Swizz Beatz, will.i.am, Mr. Porter, Erick Sermon, Green Lantern, Timbaland, J Dilla and DJ Scratch. Featured guests include Nas, Stevie Wonder, Rick James, Kelis, Raekwon, Eminem and many more. Five singles have been released for the album: \"Touch It\", \"Touch It Remix\", \"I Love My Bitch\", \"New York Shit\" and \"In the Ghetto\". Music videos were released for all of them. The finalized version of the \"Touch It Remix\", for which a video was shot, was not included on the final album.\n\nThe tracks \"I'll Hurt You\" featuring Eminem and \"Where's Your Money?\" featuring Ol' Dirty Bastard both leaked but received lukewarm responses. The first single was \"Touch It\" and reached number sixteen on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart. \"Touch It\" featuring a sampled portion of Daft Punk's \"Technologic\", also garnered a major remix. The second single \"I Love My Chick\" features Kelis and will.i.am. Stevie Wonder plays piano and sings on \"Been Through the Storm\". The song \"Get Down\" was featured in the movie \"\" but was not included on the soundtrack.\n\nBusta Rhymes was really pleased with the album: \"I would not have changed \"The Big Bang\" album for the world. It's still one of my if not the favorite album of mine from a lyrical standpoint, a conceptual standpoint and a musical standpoint.\" He praised the Dr. Dre produced song \"Legends of the Fall Off\" for the \"gravediggin beat with the shovel in the dirt\" calling it \"unbelievable\". He also praised \"You Can't Hold a Torch\", \"Don't Get Carried Away\" and \"Gold Mine\". He also said \"The only thing I probably would have changed is \"I Love My Chick\" would not have been on that album. I probably would have put \"I Love My Chick\" on another album\nthat it would have been more appropriate for.\"\n\nThe song \"Legends of Fall Off\" received further notice from hip-hop fans alike especially for its production. Mitch Findlay from \"hnhh\" said: \"While hardly a banger in the traditional sense, Dre proves why he’s one of hip-hop’s most cinematic producers, deftly arranging foley-esque heartbeats and shovels into the mix. Once again, the line between hip-hop and horror are blurred, though few would be quick to hit either Busta or Dre with the “horrorcore” label. Yet “Legend Of The Fall Offs” seems tailor made for an equally disturbing visual component. But why is such a simple beat so evocative? Is it the melodic structure, which employs repetitive use of the same few notes? For whatever reason, the sound of a piano's lowest octave seems to evoke a profound sense of hopelessness. Dr. Dre understands that better than most.\" On his \"Dr. Dre's top 10 haunting beats\", he said: \"A masterclass in minimalism, Dr. Dre closed out Busta Rhyme's Aftermath debut The Big Bang in a truly disturbing fashion. Conjuring imagery of a moonlit cemetery, Busta plays the role of Death himself, ushering in the bleak tidings to those already lost. With a shovel making for the main percussive track, Dre's steady piano and cricket-fueled ambiance cast a spell of existential dread. Throw in a man legitimately pleading for his life in vain, and \"Legend Of The Fall Offs\" makes for the darkest song of Busta's career.\" \nDan Weiss from Billboard Magazine said: \"Dr. Dre oversaw Busta’s 2006 semi-comeback The Big Bang, which ends with an inspired horrorcore piece that uses Dre’s dirgelike tendencies to its advantage. While Busta buries an unnamed rival in thick subliminal disses, the beat itself is literally shovels and dirt, followed by a pretty horrifying skit in which Busta buries a dude alive as the instrumental has foreshadowed the entire time. Gangsta bloodshed is rarely that thrilling or interesting, and ultimately this track could’ve taken on many more dimensions if a thespian like Eminem was at the helm, but hip-hop’s never seen anything like it before or since and that alone makes it perfectly Busta.\"\n\nThe album became Busta's first and only album to debut at number one on the charts with over 209,000 copies sold during the first-week of release. On August 30, 2006 the album was certified gold for shipments of over 500,000 units. The album has sold 823,000 copies as of November 22, 2011 The album became Busta Rhymes' highest charting album in the UK, debuting on the UK albums chart at number nineteen. His previous highest album peak was #3 for the album \"When Disaster Strikes\", almost ten years before the release of \"The Big Bang\".\n\nNotes\n\n\n"}

It usually means a privately owned establishment, as opposed to a public limited company, the latter of which is owned by investment shares traded in the stock market. In many cases, independent businesses are sole proprietorship companies.\n\nThese businesses are often local small businesses that may be recruited for membership in an Independent Business Alliance, or participate in a Local First or Buy Local campaign. To be considered for these campaigns, Independent businesses are often defined as private, worker or cooperative or community ownership, minimum of 50% of the business is locally owned, decision-making authority is in the local business owners and the business has limited outlets and range geographically. \n\nLocal, independent businesses have been linked to higher income and less inequality; \"In 2013, for example, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta found that counties with larger shares of local small businesses outperform their peers on three critical economic indicators: they have stronger per capita income growth, faster employment growth, and lower poverty rates.\" Independent businesses also generate a higher rate of tax revenue at lower cost to the public.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2172378", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2172378", "title": "Independent politician", "text": "Independent politician\n\nAn independent or nonpartisan politician is a politician not affiliated with any political party. There are numerous reasons why someone may stand for office as an independent.\n\nSome independent politicians may be associated with a political party, perhaps as former members of it, or else have views that align with it, but choose not to stand in its name, or are unable to do so because the party in question has selected another candidate. Others may belong to or support a political party at the national level but believe they should not formally represent it (and thus be subject to its policies) at another level.\n\nIn running for public office, independents sometimes choose to form a party or alliance with other independents, and may formally register their party or alliance. Even where the word \"independent\" is used, such alliances have much in common with a political party, especially if there is an organization which needs to approve the \"independent\" candidates.\n\nIndependents are a recurrent feature of the federal Parliament of Australia, and they are more commonly elected to state parliaments. There have been up to five independents in every federal parliament since 1990, and independents have won twenty-eight times during national elections in that time. A large proportion of independents are former members of one of Australia's four main parties, the Australian Labor Party, the Liberal Party of Australia, the Australian Greens, or the National Party of Australia. In 2013 a political party named the Australian Independents was registered with the Australian Electoral Commission.\n\nAt the dissolution of parliament before the 2019 federal election, four independents sat in the Australian House of Representatives: Andrew Wilkie (Member for Denison), Cathy McGowan (Member for Indi), Kerryn Phelps (Member for Wentworth), and Julia Banks (Member for Chisholm). Of these, Wilkie had previously been a Greens candidate, McGowan had been a Liberal staffer, and Banks was elected as a Liberal MP before resigning from the party in November 2018. At the 2019 election, Wilkie was re-elected as the Member for Clark, while McGowan retired, and both Phelps and Banks lost their seats. However, two new independents entered parliament: Zali Steggall (Member for Warringah) and Helen Haines (Member for Indi).\n\nIndependent Senators are quite rare. In modern politics, Independent Brian Harradine served from 1975 to 2005 with considerable influence at times. Nick Xenophon has been the only elected independent Senator since his election to the Senate at the 2007 federal election. Xenophon was re-elected for another six-year term at the 2013 federal election. DLP Senator John Madigan became an independent Senator in September 2014, while PUP Senators Jacqui Lambie and Glenn Lazarus became Independent Senators in November 2014 and March 2015.\n\nIn Azerbaijan, there are many independent members of the National Assembly, such as Aytən Mustafayeva.\n\nIndependent politicians are not allowed to run for office in Brazil. The Constitution of 1988, in Article 14, §3rd, item V, says that \"Are conditions for eligibility: V - party affiliation.\" However, the Proposal Amendment to the Constitution (PEC) no. 6/2015, authored by independent senator José Reguffe, would allow the independent candidacy of individuals who have the support of at least 1% of the electors able to vote in the region (city, state or country, depending on the election) in which the candidate is running. Currently, members of the legislature can leave their respective parties after being elected, as in the case of senator Reguffe, who left the Democratic Labour Party (PDT) in 2016.\n\nThe President of Bulgaria Rumen Radev is an independent with support from the Bulgarian Socialist Party. Radev was elected in the 2016 election.\n\nIndependent Members of Parliament were numerous in the last decades of the 19th century but diminished as the party system solidified. It remained common, however, to have a small number of Independent Liberal or Independent Conservative MPs into the 1950s. Today, election as an independent is far more common at the municipal level. Many municipalities have no tradition of political parties.\n\nCandidates in federal elections who are not affiliated with a party have two options: independent or no affiliation. In the former case, they appear on the ballot with \"Independent\" following their name; in the second case, they appear with their name only. The two options are otherwise equivalent.\n\nIndependent politicians have on occasion held considerable sway in the House of Commons of Canada in recent years, as Canada has been governed by successive minority governments with independent Members of Parliament (MPs) sometimes sharing in the balance of power. In the 2004 federal election, Chuck Cadman was elected to federal parliament as an independent MP representing the British Columbia riding of Surrey North. Independent André Arthur was elected in the Quebec riding of Portneuf—Jacques-Cartier in the 2006 federal election, and was the only independent to win a seat in that election; he was re-elected in the 2008 federal election. MP Bill Casey, who had been expelled from the Conservative Party for voting against the 2007 budget, also ran as an independent in 2008 and retained his seat. In the 2019 federal election, MP Jody Wilson-Raybould ran as an independent candidate in the riding of Vancouver Granville after being expelled from the Liberal Party over the SNC-Lavalin affair. She was returned to Parliament with 32% of the vote.\n\nThe territorial legislatures of the Northwest Territories and Nunavut are consensus governments with no political parties. All members sit as independents. There are a few independent members of the other provincial and territorial legislatures, which are similar in principle to the federal House of Commons; for example, in the 2009 British Columbia general election, independent candidate Vicki Huntington narrowly defeated incumbent Attorney General Wally Oppal in Delta South.\n\nMore than half of Hong Kong's Legislative Council is made up of independents, or members whose political groups are represented by one sole member in the legislature. They are common in functional constituencies, and are not rare among geographical constituencies.\n\nAfter an inconclusive election in 2015, Tihomir Orešković was named the first non-partisan Prime Minister of Croatia.\n\nAfter serving six years on his first term as President of Finland in the National Coalition Party from 2012 to 2018, Sauli Niinistö was elected for his second term in 2018 after running as an independent candidate.\n\nIn France, independent politicians are frequently categorised as \"sans étiquette\" (\"without label\") in municipal or district elections.\n\nIn the nineteenth-century and first half of the twentieth century, most French national politicians were independents. The first modern French political parties date from the early 1900s (foundation of Action Libérale and the Radical-Socialist Republican Party). The first legislation on political parties dates from 1911, though it was not until 1928 that parliamentarians were required to select a political party for the parliamentary register (either by formally joining a group, or by loosely working with one as an \"apparenté\", or associate), and not until after 1945 that structured political parties came to dominate parliamentary work.\n\nOnce elected, independents tended to attach themselves to a parliamentary party. In some cases independen deputies banded together to form a technical group of their own. In 1932, for instance, there were four technical groups created: the left-of-centre Independent Left, with 12 deputies; the centre-right liberal Independents of the Left, with 26 deputies; the right-wing agrarian Independents for Economic, Social and Peasant Action, with six deputies; and the far-right monarchist Independent Group, with 12 deputies - these four technical groups thus accounted for one-tenth of deputies. In addition, the larger parliamentary parties, including the socialist SFIO, centre-left PRRRS, centre-right ARD and conservative FR all included a greater or lesser number of independents who sat with their group for parliamentary work (\"apparentés\").\n\nIn 1920, Alexandre Millerand was elected president of the Republic under the banner \"without label\".\n\nHowever, it is nowadays rare to have independent politicians at national level, if only because independents usually affiliate themselves to an existing political grouping. Noteworthy independents include José Bové in the 2007 presidential election. Emmanuel Macron was an independent politician as Minister, but formed his own party to stand in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nFrom 2001 to 2008 \"without label\" was no longer used in the nomenclature of the Ministry of the Interior. Candidates and lists presenting themselves as \"without label\" are classified in DVG (various left), DVD (various right), DVC (various center) or AUT (other) according to their political sensitivity. Therefore, from 2008 onwards, the DIV (miscellaneous) or the LDIV code for the \"miscellaneous\" list has been created to group unclassifiable or categorical interests and, by default, mayors without a declared label claiming no political sensitivity, be it left, center or right. The AUT (other) grade replaces the DIV grade without changing its definition.\n\nSalome Zourabichvili won the 2018 Georgian presidential election as an independent candidate, becoming the first-ever female President of Georgia.\n\nJoachim Gauck, President of Germany from March 2012 to March 2017 and the first Federal President without party affiliation, was to date the most prominent independent politician. In the German presidential election of 2010 he was the candidate of the Social Democrats and Greens, in 2012 the candidate of all major parties except The Left. His presidency—though his powers are limited—constitutes an exception, as Independent politicians have rarely held high office in German history, at least not since World War II. It has nevertheless happened that a presidential candidate without any chances of election by the Federal Convention was not a party member: for example, when in 1984 the Greens came up with the writer Luise Rinser.\n\nIn the Bundestag parliament nearly all deputies belong to a political party. The voting system of personalized proportional representation (since 1949) allows any individual holding the passive right to vote to stand for a direct mandate in the electoral districts—299 of the seats in parliament are distributed by districts according to a plurality voting system. Such a candidate has to present 200 signatures in favor of his candidacy, the same as a candidate of a party that had no parliamentary presentation previously. The first Bundestag election in 1949 saw three independents elected; since then, no party-independent candidate has won a seat. At state level, the situation is more or less the same: only party members have a real chance to be elected to a Landtag legislature, and state ministers without party membership are just as rare as at the federal level. However, in local elections it may occur that an independent politician is elected deputy to districts', cities' and municipalities' assemblies, as well as member of a city council or even mayor, especially in Northern Germany. In recent years, independents have formed Free Voters associations which have had success in local governments. Two such associations have managed to enter state parliaments: the Free Voters of Bavaria in 2008 and the Brandenburg United Civic Movements/Free Voters in 2019.\n\nAn independent member of parliament, who also is not a member of a voters' association, holds the status of \"fraktionsloser Abgeordneter\", i.e. not affiliated to any parliamentary group. A representative who leaves his party (and his parliamentary group) and does not join another becomes \"fraktionslos\". In 1989 the Bundestag MP Thomas Wüppesahl, who had left the Green Party in 1987 and was excluded from the Green parliamentary group the next year, obtained more rights as a \"fraktionsloser Abgeordneter\", for example more talking time and representation in a subcommittee, when the Federal Constitutional Court decided partially in his favor.\n\nAfter the German unification of 1871, the first Reich Chancellors (heads of government) \"de jure\" served as executive officers of the German Imperial states as non-partisans, usually recruited from the traditional bureaucratic, aristocratic and/or military elites. In the fierce political conflicts during the Weimar period after World War I, several chancellors and Reich Ministers also had no party affiliation: these chancellors were Wilhelm Cuno (1922–1923), Hans Luther (1925–1926), the former Centre politician Franz von Papen (1932), and Kurt von Schleicher (1932–1933). The last two cabinets appointed by Reich President Paul von Hindenburg, a non-partisan (though strongly Conservative) himself, were regarded as apolitical cabinets of experts with regard to the rise of the Nazi Party; many of the ministers were not party members.\n\nSince World War II, only two ministers of (West) German cabinets have not been party members, though \"on the ticket\" of the major party in the coalition, the Social Democrats: Education Minister Hans Leussink (1969–1972), and Minister of Economy Werner Müller (1998–2002). Minister of Justice Klaus Kinkel only shortly after his appointment joined the Free Democrats in 1991. A special case is the former Federal Minister and Chancellor Ludwig Erhard, whose affiliation with the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) has not been conclusively established: although he served as Minister of Economics from 1949 to 1963 and as Federal Chancellor from 1963 to 1966, and was even elected CDU party chairman in 1966, it seems that he never signed a membership form or paid contributions. Researches by \"Der Stern\" magazine have revealed a record at the CDU party archives created only in 1968, with the faked date of entry of early March 1949.\n\nThe President of Iceland (currently Guðni Th. Jóhannesson) is independent.\n\nIndependent candidate contest elections on the basis of their personal appeal or to promote an ideology different from any party.\n\nIn Ireland, proportional representation, the comparative looseness of formal parties, and strong local sentiment have meant that independents have formed a significant part of the parliamentary landscape since the foundation of the state: in the early elections to Dáil Éireann (parliament), independents accounted for 7% of seats in 1922, 8.5% in 1923, 10.5% in 1927, and 9% in 1932, though with the development of relatively more structured parties their numbers declined thereafter. These were similar proportions to the number of independents elected to other interwar European democracies such as France (see above).\n\nIt was not until the 2010s that independents would see a similar electoral success, with record scores for independents surpassing the previous interwar highs.\n\nAfter the Irish general election in 2016, there were 19 independent TDs (parliamentary deputies) in the Dáil (the lower house of the Irish parliament), representing 12% of the total. Two technical groups were formed by independent deputies to coordinate their activities: the Independents4Change, with four deputies, opposed the government, while the Independent Alliance formed part of the minority government's working majority. A number of other individual independents similarly supported the government, and received cabinet positions.\n\nThere are fourteen independent senators in the 25th Seanad (the upper house of the Irish parliament), representing 23% of the total. Three of these are elected by the graduates of the National University of Ireland and two from Dublin University. There are also five independent senators who were nominated by the Taoiseach and four elected by the technical panels.\n\nThe Prime Ministers Carlo Azeglio Ciampi (1993–1994), Lamberto Dini (1995–1996), Giuliano Amato (2000–2001), Mario Monti (2011–2013) and Giuseppe Conte (2018–present) were independent when they were in office. Ciampi was also the President of the Italian Republic between 1999 and 2006. President Sergio Mattarella, despite being a former member of the Christian Democracy and of the Democratic Party, was elected President in 2015 as an independent.\n\nIndependents have rarely been elected to the Dewan Rakyat and state legislative assemblies. In Malaysian elections, many independent candidates lose their election deposit because they had failed to secure at least 12.5% or one-eighth of the total votes cast. Independent Senators are quite rare.\n\nIn 2010, a group of independent MPs who were sacked from the People's Justice Party formed a political block called \"\". The members were Zahrain Mohamed Hashim (Bayan Baru), Wee Choo Keong (Wangsa Maju), Zulkifli Noordin (Kulim-Bandar Bharu), Tan Tee Beng (Nibong Tebal) dan Mohsin Fadzli Samsuri (Bagan Serai). It did not last beyond the 12th General Elections.\n\n, three independent MPs were elected in GE14, but later joining Pakatan Harapan (PKR), thus causing no representation for independent MP for that time. However, as of June 2018 and December 2018, the number increased to 13 independent Members of Parliament that now currently sit in the Dewan Rakyat as of December 2018.\n\nAt the same time in December 2018, almost all member from Sabah UMNO quit the party and became independent politicians.\n\nJaime Heliodoro Rodríguez Calderón (born in 1957), sometimes referred to by his nickname \"El Bronco\", is a Mexican politician who is the current governor for the northern state of Nuevo León and holds no political party affiliation. elected Governor for Nuevo León, making history as the first independent candidate to win in the country.\n\nOriginally, there were no recognised parties in the New Zealand parliament, although loose groupings did exist informally (initially between supporters of central government versus provincial governments, and later between liberals and conservatives). The foundation of formal political parties, starting at the end of the 19th century, considerably diminished the number of unaffiliated politicians, although a smaller number of independent candidates continued to be elected up until the 1940s. Since then, however, there have been relatively few independent politicians in Parliament. No independent candidate has won or held a seat in a general election since 1943, although two independent candidates have been successful in by-elections (in all cases after having held the seats in question as partisan candidates up until that point). Other politicians have become independents in the course of a parliamentary term, but not been voted into office as such.\n\nThe last person to be directly elected to Parliament as an independent in New Zealand was Winston Peters, who won the in electorate as an independent after having previously held it a member of the National Party. By the time of the next general election, he had formed his own party (New Zealand First), and thus was no longer standing as an independent. Since that time, the only independents in Parliament have been people who quit or were expelled from their original party but retained their seats without going through a by-election. Some have gone on to found or co-found their own parties, with varying levels of success — examples include Peter Dunne, Taito Phillip Field, Gordon Copeland, Tau Henare, and Alamein Kopu. Others have joined parties which were then outside Parliament, such as Frank Grover and Tuariki Delamere.\n\nThere were two independent MPs in the 49th New Zealand Parliament; Chris Carter and Hone Harawira. Carter became an independent after his criticisms of the Labour Party's leadership resulted in his being expelled from the Labour caucus, while Harawira resigned from the Māori Party and, after a short period as an independent, also resigned as an MP in order to force the when he was re-elected as representative of his new political party, Mana and retained the seat in the 2011 General Election. There were also two other parties which had only a single MP: United Future with Peter Dunne and ACT with David Seymour. Neither Dunne nor Seymour was classed as an independent — Dunne's presence in Parliament was due to personal votes in his home electorate, and Seymour's presence was as the sole elected MP of ACT because of a collapse in their support in the . In the 50th New Zealand Parliament there was one independent MP: Brendan Horan, a former New Zealand First MP who was expelled from his party because of allegations of misappropriation of family assets.\n\nPeter Dunne effectively became an Independent MP for a short period after his United Future political party was deregistered on 25 June 2013 by the Electoral Commission, as the party no longer had the required minimum of 500 members. The party was subsequently re-registered.\n\nIn Niue, there have been no political parties since 2003, when the Niue People's Party disbanded, and all politicians are \"de facto\" independents. The government depends on an informal coalition.\n\nPakistan also has independent politicians standing in elections. Pakistan's Parliament has General Elections, 2008 elected 30 Members. In the 2011 four candidates won seats in the National Assembly. In the 2013 General Election nine seats were won by independents.\n\nNoli de Castro, the Philippines' former vice president, ran as senator in 2001 with no political party affiliation. He was a guest candidate of the opposition Pwersa ng Masa coalition but he never joined their campaign rallies. He won in the senate race with the highest votes (then) in Philippine history. In 2004, he ran as vice president as a guest candidate of the administration K-4 coalition and won with just under majority of the vote.\n\nStarting in 2001, several senators had also resigned from their respective parties to become independents; at the start of the 15th Congress, there were more independent senators than any other single political party. However, in contesting elections, all elected independents had been members of either the administration or the opposition coalition, until in the 2007 Senate election when Gregorio Honasan (a former senator) was elected as an independent while not a being member of any coalition. Honasan was earlier elected in 1995 as an independent candidate and being adopted by the Nationalist People's Coalition-led coalition to become the first elected independent senator since Magnolia Antonino in 1967, although Antonino was a guest candidate of the Liberal Party then.\n\nIn the local level, former priest Eddie Panlilio was elected as governor of Pampanga in 2007, defeating two administration candidates. When Panlilio eventually transferred to the Liberal Party in time for the 2010 election, it was ruled that he was beaten in the 2007 election; in 2010, he was defeated.\n\nIn the 2010 House of Representatives elections, seven independents were elected, although all but two joined a political party after the elections.\n\nIn contesting elections, independent candidates, while can spend as much as those with parties can under the law, they aren't able to tap in spending from a political party that nominated them.\n\nThe Polish Sejm is elected by party-list ordination, which does not allow lone candidates to run, although since 2001 there has been a possibility to create non-partisan \"Voters' Electoral Committee\" (pol. \"KWW\", \"komitet wyborczy wyborców\"); they are by almost any means party lists, but no officially registered party is behind them. They can be unregistered parties, e.g. Kukiz'15, or non-partisan movements, although the latter never reached the 5% threshold. National minorities candidates also form Voters' Electoral Committees (like German Minority Electoral Committee, represented in Sejm since 1991), but they do not have to reach the nationwide threshold. However, during a Sejm term many members switch parties or become independents.\n\nTickets such as Civic Platform during the 2001 election were formally non-partisan, Civic Platform was widely viewed as a de facto political party, as it is now.\n\nThe situation in the Senate is different, as the voting system allows independents to run as single candidates and some are elected in their own right. In the last parliamentary election (2015) four independents won seats in the Senate.\n\nThree Presidents since 1990 have technically been independents. Lech Wałęsa was not an endorsed candidate of any party, but the chairman of the Solidarity and he was elected without full support of this union (Solidarity votes split between him and Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki). Aleksander Kwaśniewski was a leader of the Social Democracy of the Republic of Poland, but formally resigned from the party after he was elected, as did Lech Kaczyński, who was the first leader of Law and Justice, Bronisław Komorowski (PO) and Andrzej Duda (PiS). The resignation is required because the Constitution says that the president shall hold no other offices nor discharge any public functions. The aforementioned presidents often participated in their party's campaigns (e.g. Andrzej Duda in the Law and Justice campaign three months after his resignation from the party).\n\nMarcelo Rebelo de Sousa, the current president of Portugal since 6 March 2016, was elected on 24 January 2016 while being a leading member of the Social Democratic Party, but suspended his political affiliation on the day of his swearing-in.\n\nAll of Russia's Presidents have been independents. Former president Dmitry Medvedev declined an offer to join United Russia, saying that he believes the President should be an independent so that he serves the interests of the country rather than his political party.\n\nVladimir Putin, the current president of Russia, was the head of the United Russia party until 26 May 2012, but even then was not its member, thus formally was and still is independent.\n\nThe Swedish election system is based on parties nominating candidate MPs for their party ballots, and each party has to receive 4% or more of the national vote (or 12% in one region, which has never happened). This makes running as an independent MP impossible. Once elected, the seat is personal; MPs may resign their party membership, or be stripped of it, while retaining their Riksdag seats to become independent to become what is commonly referred to as a \"politisk vilde\" (\"political savage\").\n\nIn the executive branch, there is no requirement for ministers to be MPs, or even have a political affiliation (though this has overwhelmingly been the case in modern times). This means that even the prime minister could technically be an independent if chosen by the Riksdag.\n\nAfter the 2018 Taiwanese local elections, there is only one independent local head:\nIn 2019, Ko Wen-je founded the Taiwan People's Party, so there is no independent local head at the moment.\n\nThe Registration of Political Parties Act 1998 laid down the first specific rules in the United Kingdom relating to the use of the term 'independent' by election candidates. That Act was repealed with most of its contents covered by Part II of the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000. Candidates standing for United Kingdom local elections and United Kingdom parliamentary elections, including the devolved parliaments and assemblies, can use the name of a registered political party, or the term 'Independent' (or its Welsh language equivalent \"annibynol\") or no ballot paper description at all (this latter choice was used, for example, by David Icke at the 2008 Haltemprice and Howden by-election).\n\nSome groups in the United Kingdom who are not affiliated to any national or regional party have registered locality-based political parties. Some English examples are the Independent Kidderminster Hospital and Health Concern, the Epsom and Ewell Residents Association, the Devizes Guardians, the Derwentside Independents, and the East Yorkshire Independents.\n\nBefore the twentieth century it was fairly common for independents to be elected to the House of Commons of the United Kingdom, but there have been very few since 1945. S. O. Davies, a veteran Labour MP, held his Merthyr Tydfil seat in the General Election of 1970, standing as an independent, after he had been deselected by the Labour Party.\n\nJournalist Martin Bell was elected at Tatton in the general election of 1997, having stood on an anti-corruption platform, defeating incumbent Neil Hamilton. He was the first independent to be newly elected to the Commons since 1951. He stood unsuccessfully in a different constituency in 2001.\n\nAt the 2001 General Election, Dr Richard Taylor of the Independent Kidderminster Hospital and Health Concern party was elected for the constituency of Wyre Forest. Taylor was re-elected for Wyre Forest at the 2005 General Election, becoming the only independent in recent times to have been elected for a second term.\n\nTwo independent (or local party) members of parliament were elected in the 2005 election, although both were defeated five years later. In the same election, Peter Law was elected as an independent at Blaenau Gwent. Law died on 25 April 2006: the resulting by-election elected Dai Davies of the local party Blaenau Gwent People's Voice. The by-election was unusual as it was the first time in over eighty years that an independent had held a seat previously occupied by another independent.\n\nOnly one independent was elected to the Commons in the 2010, 2015 and 2017 elections: Sylvia Hermon, the member for North Down, a Unionist who left the Ulster Unionist Party because of its links with the Conservatives.\n\nThere have also been several instances of politicians being elected to the Commons as representatives of a political party, then resigning the party's whip, or having it withdrawn. Examples in this in the 2010-2015 parliament included Mike Hancock (formerly a Liberal Democrat), Eric Joyce (formerly Labour) and Nadine Dorries, a Conservative who had the whip withdrawn for part of the parliament and thus sat as an independent during that time.\n\nIndependent candidates often stand in British parliamentary elections, often with platforms about specific local issues, but usually without success. An example from the 2001 general election was Aston Villa supporter Ian Robinson, who stood as an independent in the Sutton Coldfield constituency in protest at the way chairman Doug Ellis ran the football club. Another example an independent candidate, in the Salisbury constituency, is Arthur Uther Pendragon, a local activist and self-declared reincarnation of King Arthur.\n\nOther independent candidates are associated with a political party and may be former members of it, but cannot stand under its label. For instance, after being expelled from the Labour Party but before the Respect Coalition was founded, British Member of Parliament (MP) George Galloway described himself as \"Independent Labour\".\n\nOn 23 March 2005 the Independent Network was set up to support independent candidates in the General Election. The Independent Network still supports Independent candidates in local, regional, national and European elections. It has an organic set of principles which are known as the Bell Principles and are very closely related to Lord Nolan's Standards of Public Life. The Independent Network does not impose any ideology or political influence on their candidates.\n\nIn March 2009, the multi-millionaire Paul Judge established the Jury Team, an umbrella organisation dedicated to increasing the number of independent candidates standing in Britain, in both national and European elections.\n\nPart II of the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 allows individuals who wish to stand as a candidate to all parliaments and assemblies in the UK, including the House of Commons, the right to use one of three ballot paper descriptions. Those descriptions are the name of a registered political party; the word \"independent\" or the Welsh equivalent; or no description at all, leaving the ballot paper description box blank.\n\nUnless a candidate stands as \"independent\" or as a \"No Description\" candidate leaving the ballot paper description box blank, their candidature must be confirmed by a signed certificate from the relevant officer from a registered political party, as set out in Section 52 of the Electoral Administration Act 2006.\n\nThe House of Lords includes many peers independent from political parties. Some are simply not affiliated with any grouping, whilst another, larger, grouping is given the official designation of crossbenchers. Additionally the Lords Spiritual (bishops of the Church of England) do not have party affiliations.\n\nIn the 2003 Scottish Parliamentary elections, three MSPs were elected as Independents: Dennis Canavan (Falkirk West), Dr Jean Turner (Strathkelvin and Bearsden) and Margo MacDonald (Lothians). In 2004 Campbell Martin (West of Scotland region) left the Scottish National Party to become an independent and in 2005 Brian Monteith (Mid Scotland and Fife) left the Conservative Party to become an independent. At the 2007 Scottish Parliamentary elections Margo MacDonald was again returned as an independent MSP and was elected as an independent for the third time four years later. She died in 2014 while still serving as member of the Parliament. As she was elected as an independent regional MSP, there could be no by-election and her seat remained vacant until the 2016 election.\n\nPeter Law was expelled from the Labour Party after standing against an official Labour candidate in Blaenau Gwent at the 2005 UK general election and became an independent in the National Assembly and UK Parliament. In 2006 Peter Law died from a brain tumour and his wife, Trish Law campaigned and took the seat as an independent candidate at the sequent by-election and held onto the seat again in the 2007 Welsh Assembly elections.\n\nIn 2016, Nathan Gill as the then leader of UKIP Wales defected from the group to sit as an independent after a falling out with Neil Hamilton who was elected UKIP Assembly group leader. Dafydd Elis-Thomas left the Plaid Cymru group later in 2016 after multiple fallings out with Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood. Elis-Thomas said his reason for leaving Plaid Cymru was that it not serious about working with the Welsh Labour Government. Neil McEvoy was expelled from Plaid Cymru on 16 January 2018 and is now sitting as an independent AM. Nathan Gill stood down on 27 December 2017 and was replaced by Mandy Jones. Mandy Jones left the UKIP group on 9 January 2018 over a fallout over her staff.\n\nThe introduction of directly elected mayors in several parts of England has witnessed the election of independents to run councils in Stoke-on-Trent, Middlesbrough, Bedford, Hartlepool and Mansfield. The first Mayor of London, Ken Livingstone, was first elected as an independent, having run against the official Labour candidate Frank Dobson. He was subsequently re-admitted to the Labour Party in December 2003 before his first re-election campaign.\n\nIndependent candidates frequently stand and are elected to local councils. There is a special Independent group of the Local Government Association to cater for them. A number of local authorities have been entirely or almost entirely composed of independent members, such as the City of London Corporation, the Isles of Scilly Council, Orkney Islands Council, Shetland Islands Council and Comhairle nan Eilean Siar (Western Isles Council) in the Outer Hebrides.\n\nRoughly a quarter of the police and crime commissioners elected in England and Wales in the 2012 election were independents.\n\nGeorge Washington is the only President elected as an independent to date. President Washington opposed the development of political parties, which had begun to solidify as the Federalist faction centered around Vice President John Adams and Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton and the Democratic-Republican faction centered around Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, fearing that partisanship would eventually destroy the country. He famously warned against \"the baneful effects of the spirit of party\" in his 1796 Farewell Address.\n\nJohn Tyler was expelled from the Whig Party in September 1841, and effectively remained an independent for the remainder of his presidency. He later returned to the Democratic Party and briefly sought re-election in 1844 as a National Democrat, but withdrew over fear he would split the Democratic vote.\n\nSince 1900, notable candidates running as independents for U.S. president have included liberal Republican congressman John Anderson in 1980, billionaire entrepreneur Ross Perot in 1992 and 1996, former Green Party candidate Ralph Nader in the 1996 and 2000 elections, and \"Never Trump\" conservative candidate Evan McMullin in 2016. Out of all independent candidates since Washington, Perot received the best performance, gaining no votes in the Electoral College but receiving 19 percent of the popular vote and at earlier points in the election season leading in polls against his opponents Bill Clinton and George H.W. Bush. Additionally, McMullin received 21 percent of the popular vote in his home state of Utah but received little support from the remainder of the country. Independent Senator Bernie Sanders ran in the 2016 and 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries, but ultimately did not appear on the ballot in the 2016 presidential election, though he did receive 5% of the vote as a write-in candidate in his home state of Vermont.\n\nIn 2008, Nader formed Independent Parties in New Mexico, Delaware, and elsewhere to gain ballot access in several states. This strategy has been pursued by several other candidates for federal races, including Joe Lieberman (Connecticut for Lieberman).\n\nIllinois, Maine, Oregon, Rhode Island, Texas, Alaska and Minnesota have elected formally independent candidates as governor: Illinois's first two governors, Shadrach Bond and Edward Coles; James B. Longley in 1974 as well as Angus King in 1994 and 1998 from Maine; Lincoln Chafee in 2010 from Rhode Island; Julius Meier in 1930 from Oregon; Sam Houston in 1859 from Texas; and Bill Walker in 2014 from Alaska. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. is sometimes mentioned as an independent governor, though this is not technically correct; he ran as an A Connecticut Party candidate (which gave him better ballot placement than an unaffiliated candidate would receive), defeating the Democratic and Republican party nominees. Another former governor who is sometimes mentioned as an independent is Jesse Ventura, who actually ran as a member of the Reform Party's Minnesota affiliate, which later disaffiliated from the party and reverted to their original name the Independence Party of Minnesota.\n\nIn 1971, State Senator Henry Howell of Virginia, a former Democrat, was elected lieutenant governor as an independent. Two years later, he campaigned for governor as an independent, but lost by 15,000 votes.\n\nThere were several unsuccessful independent gubernatorial candidates in 2006 who impacted their electoral races. In Maine, state legislator Barbara Merrill (formerly a Democrat) received 21% of the vote. In Texas, country music singer and mystery novelist Kinky Friedman received 12.43% of the vote, and State Comptroller Carole Keeton Strayhorn received 18.13%. Strayhorn and Friedman's presence in the race resulted in a splitting of the ballot four ways between themselves and the two major parties.\n\nIn 2010, Florida governor Charlie Crist left the Republican party and became Independent (He later became a Democrat.) rather than face former state house Speaker Marco Rubio in the Republican primary (Rubio won, though Crist came in ahead of Democratic nominee Kendrick Meek).\n\nIn 2014, former Honolulu mayor Mufi Hannemann ran as an independent candidate for the governorship of the State of Hawaii after previously campaigning in the state's Democratic primary. As a result, Democratic candidate David Ige was elected as governor with a plurality of 49%.\n\nThere have been several independents elected to the United States Senate throughout history. Notable examples include David Davis of Illinois (a former Republican) in the 19th century, and Harry F. Byrd Jr. of Virginia (who had been elected to his first term as a Democrat) in the 20th century. Some officials have been elected as members of a party but became independent while in office (without being elected as such), such as Wayne Morse of Oregon. Nebraska senator George W. Norris was elected for four terms as a Republican before changing to an independent after the Republicans lost their majority in Congress in 1930. Norris won re-election as an independent in 1936, but later lost his final re-election attempt to Republican Kenneth S. Wherry in 1942. Vermont senator Jim Jeffords left the Republican Party to become an independent in 2001. Jeffords's change of party status was especially significant because it shifted the Senate composition from 50-50 between the Republicans and Democrats (with a Republican Vice President, Dick Cheney, who would presumably break all ties in favor of the Republicans), to 49 Republicans, 50 Democrats, and one Independent. Jeffords agreed to vote for Democratic control of the Senate in exchange for being appointed chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, and the Democrats held control of the Senate until the Congressional elections in 2002, when the Republicans regained their majority. Jeffords retired at the end of his term in 2007. Wayne Morse after two years as an independent became a Democrat. Dean Barkley of the Independence Party of Minnesota was appointed a day before the 2002 elections to fill the senate seat of Paul Wellstone who, while running for re-election, died weeks prior. Barkley refused to caucus with either party.\n\nSenator Bernie Sanders is the longest-serving independent member of Congress in American history. He was an independent member of the United States House of Representatives for Vermont-at-large from 1991 to 2007. Sanders later won the open Senate seat of Jim Jeffords as an independent. Joe Lieberman is a former Democrat who, like Lowell P. Weicker Jr., ran under a third party (Connecticut for Lieberman Party) in the 2006 election. Though both representatives are technically independent politicians, they often caucus with the Democrats. In 2006, Sanders and Lieberman were the only two victorious independent candidates for Congress, both caucusing with the Democrats. In 2012 Angus King was elected to the US Senate as an Independent from Maine. , he has typically caucused with the Democrats.\n\nThe United States House of Representatives has also seen a handful of independent members. Examples include Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Virgil Goode of Virginia, Frazier Reams of Ohio, Victor Berger of Wisconsin, and Justin Amash of Michigan.\n\nIn August 2008, there were 12 independents who held offices in state legislatures. There were four state senators, one from Kentucky, one from Oregon, one from Tennessee, and one from New Mexico. The representatives came from the states of Louisiana (two), Maine (two), Vermont (two), and Virginia (two). In the 2008 general elections, Wisconsin State Assemblyman Jeffrey Wood left the Republican Party and won reelection as an independent. After the 2008 primary election, New Mexico State Senator Joseph Carraro left the Republican Party and registered as an Independent. He did not run for reelection.\n\nIn November 2005, Manny Diaz was elected Mayor of Miami, Florida as an independent. On June 19, 2007, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg switched his party affiliation from Republican to independent. Oscar Goodman, Mayor of Las Vegas, Nevada switched his affiliation to Independent from Democrat in December 2009. Dan Hollingsworth has won four consecutive elections as an Independent since 1998 for mayor of the small city of Ruston, Louisiana, the home of Louisiana Tech University. In 2017, Maine State Representative Ralph Chapman, a Democrat, changed his registration to Maine Green Independent Party, which is the Maine chapter of the Green Party of the United States, giving the Green Party a seat in Maine's State Legislature.\n\nThe Nebraska Legislature is unique in that it is the only nonpartisan state legislature. In the Legislature (which is additionally unique in that it is also the only state legislature that is unicameral), there are no formal party alignments or groups and the members are nominated in nonpartisan primary elections. Members are allowed to register with political parties but choose not to reveal their affiliation while seated, as a professional courtesy. However, the political affiliation of party-affiliated members are considered open secrets and the parties exist in the legislature on an unofficial basis. Some members, such as Ernie Chambers of Omaha, are independent of party officially, while others have not publicly disclosed their affiliation.\n\nNotes:\nReferences:\n\n"}

Independents reached particular prominence between 1642 and 1660, in the period of the English Civil War and of the Commonwealth and Protectorate, wherein the Parliamentary Army became the champion of Independent religious views against the Anglicanism or the Laudianism of Royalists and the Presbyterianism favoured by Parliament itself. The Independents advocated freedom of religion for non-Catholics.\n\nDuring the First Civil War, the Parliamentary cause was supported by an alliance of Anglicans who supported Parliamentary traditions, Presbyterians and Independents. During the period leading up to the war and during its early years, the Presbyterian party under the leadership of John Pym was in the ascendant. However, as was shown in the outcome of negotiations for an alliance with the Presbyterian Scots over the Solemn League and Covenant in 1643, the Independents party were strong enough to prevent Presbyterianism being imposed on them.\n\nAfter the formation of the New Model Army the strength of the Independents grew along with the fortunes of the Army because Independents held many of the senior positions within the Army (Oliver Cromwell being the most famous of them). In 1648, at end of the Second Civil War the Independents in the Army were strong enough to remove from Parliament all those who opposed them in what has become known as Pride's Purge.\n\nAfter Pride's Purge, the so-called Rump Parliament of around fifty Independent MPs sanctioned the trial and execution of King Charles I in January 1649 and the creation of the republican English Commonwealth.\n\nThe Independents dominated English politics for the next decade, until shortly before the Restoration.\n\nAfter the Restoration, the English Parliament was dominated by Anglicans, supporters of both the Parliamentary and Royalist causes, who imposed the Clarendon Code. Combined with the Test Act, this excluded all nonconformists from holding civil or military office, and prevented them from being awarded degrees by the universities of Cambridge and Oxford.\n\nMany nonconformists later migrated to the North American colonies.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2172415", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2172415", "title": "Independent voter", "text": "Independent voter\n\nAn independent voter, often also called an unaffiliated voter in the United States, is a voter who does not align themselves with a political party. An independent is variously defined as a voter who votes for candidates on issues rather than on the basis of a political ideology or partisanship; a voter who does not have long-standing loyalty to, or identification with, a political party; a voter who does not usually vote for the same political party from election to election; or a voter who self-describes as an independent.\n\nVoting systems outside of the United States, including the British parliamentary system, may include independent voters as being \"floater voters\" or swing votes.\n\nThe definition of an \"independent voter\" is controversial and fraught with implications.\n\nThe earliest concept of independents is of a person whose political choices, by definition, were made based on issues and candidates (due to lack of party affiliation). Furthermore, early studies of voting behavior conclusively demonstrated that self-identified independent voters are less interested in specific elections than partisan voters, poorly informed about issues and candidates, and less active politically. However, a contrary view emerged: The independent usually voted on the basis of deeply ingrained beliefs, attitudes and loyalties, and is more like the strongly partisan voter than any other voter (or the idealized \"independent\").\n\nBy the 1960s, scholars attempted to define the independent based on behavior, rather than party identification or loyalty. Focusing on ticket splitters, these studies depicted an independent voter who had the same level of political interest as strong partisans and who voted largely based on the issues with which they strongly agreed and/or disagreed. However, by focusing on voting behavior, this definition of the independent ignored non-voters. Critics claimed that the independent voter is merely a subset of the larger set of independents, which should also include non-voters. Studies also found that voting and not-voting is deeply affected by the particular candidate running in an election. Voting, therefore, is more reflective of what candidate is running—and therefore a poor measure of partisanship.\n\nMore recently, scholars focused on self-identification as a good measure of a person's political independence. The value of self-identification as a measure of a person's political independence or partisanship is that it is seen as a proxy for the behavior which should be exhibited by the independent voter. Additionally, self-identification could be easily captured either with a nominal question (\"Do you self-identify with an existing political party?\", a question which is answered with a \"yes\" or a \"no\"), or by a structured ordinal question (\"Generally speaking, do you consider yourself a Democrat, a Republican, an independent, or what?\"). The first analyses of this measure of political independence found that there were significant differences between those individuals who self-identified as \"independent\" and those who listed \"no preference\" as to party identification. Individuals who expressed \"no preference\" usually exhibited low levels of interest in politics, low levels of knowledge about the candidates and issues, low frequency of voting, and less confidence in their ability to influence politics.\n\nAlthough some scholars continue to conclude that self-description is the best measure of partisanship or independence, a number of studies have found debilitating problems with this measure. The nature of the voter registration system and the appearance of the ballot, the way the question reinforces a unidimensional interpretation of the political arena, the measure's failure to function in a multi-party political system, the measure's confusion of the theoretical relationship between partisanship and the intent to vote, question wording errors which confuse a social group with a political party, failure to predict policy (versus candidate) preferences, question order, and failure to measure partisanship accurately when there are sizeable differences in party size all confound accurate measurement of partisanship and independence using this measure. Even the nature of a survey instrument as a measure of partisanship and independence has been called into question.\n\nThere are several synonyms for the term \"independent voter\". In the U.S. state of Massachusetts, a registered voter who chooses not to enroll in a political party or designation is termed unenrolled. In the U.S. state of Florida, a registered voter who chooses not to affiliate with a political party is termed no party affiliation (NPA).\n\nTo many scholars, independence seemed the flip-side of partisanship. Identifying the variables which are significant in creating partisanship would, therefore, identify the variables which are significant in creating political independence. Subsequently, a very large body of scholarship has emerged which has attempted to analyze partisanship.\n\nParents appear to be a primary source of political socialization and partisanship. Much of the theoretical basis for this hypothesis emerged from the fields of child psychology and social learning, which studied the ways in which children are socialized and values inculcated in them. Studies of political partisanship have found that partisanship is strongest when both parents have the same political loyalties, these loyalties are strong, both parents have similarly strong party loyalties, and parental partisanship accords with socio-economic status (for example, the wealthy are Republicans or the poor are Labour supporters).\n\nSocial groups are another source of partisanship. Friends, relatives, and neighbors often have the same partisan loyalties and strengths as one's parents. The more homogeneous the social group, the more likely the individual will be to develop strong partisan loyalties. When social group homogeneousness is low, the individual is likely to be less strongly socialized into partisan politics and more likely to seek a different party loyalty (whether by disengaging from partisanship or switching partisan loyalties).\n\nLife-cycle and generational effects also contribute to partisanship. Initially, studies indicated that the operative variable was the \"life-cycle.\" That is, a person's partisan attachments naturally grew stronger over time as weak socialization became strong and strong socialization became stronger. Additionally, theorists suggested that older voters favored certain policy preferences (such as strong government pensions and old-age health insurance) which led them to (strongly) favor one party over another. Later studies showed that the initial strong effect of the life-cycle variable was mitigated by generational effects. Party identification seemed strongly affected by certain formative generational events (such as the Civil War, the Great Depression or the social upheaval of the 1960s). Several studies concluded that generational effects were distinct from life-cycle effects, and that both factors were significant in creating (or not) partisanship.\n\nBut if generational events affected partisanship, some scholars hypothesized that lesser political, social, and economic issues might as well. Conceding that major \"shocks\" such as the Great Depression could realign or dealign partisanship, some scholars reasoned that a series of smaller shocks over time could also dramatically influence the direction and strength of partisanship. Many scholars became convinced that partisanship was not bedrock but shifting sand. Important childhood events (such as becoming aware of a presidential campaign) as well as events in adulthood (such as recessions, war, or shifting racial policies) could also affect the level of partisanship. The concept of \"retrospective voting\"—in which the voter makes political judgments based on the party-in-power's performance over the past few years—deeply influenced studies of partisanship. Applying the concept of retrospectiveness to partisanship, more recent analyses have concluded that retrospective and prospective political party success play a significant role in the direction and strength of partisanship.\n\nBoth repeated \"minor shocks\" and retrospective/prospective assessments of political party success are micro-level, rather than macro-level, variables. That is, while very important in creating political independence, they affect individuals only. For example, John may come to believe that Party A is no longer effective and become an independent. Yet, Mary may come to the conclusion that Party A is still effective. Both voters see the same successes and failures, but their retrospective and prospective calculus of success varies.\n\nThis has led some scholars to conclude that independence is not the flip-side of partisanship. Rather, partisanship and political independence may be two distinct variables, each of which must be measured separately and using different theoretical constructs. Other scholars have concluded that the causal direction of partisanship must be questioned. While it has long been assumed that partisanship and the strength of partisanship drive attitudes on issues, these scholars conclude that the causal relationship is reversed.\n\nUsing the self-identification method of measuring political independence, surveys found an increasing number of independent voters beginning in 1966. In 1952, when modern polling on the issue began, the number of independent voters nationwide was 22 percent. By 1976, the number had risen more than half, to 36 percent of the electorate. Regionally, the rise of the independent voter was even more apparent. In the non-Deep South, the number of independent voters had risen from 22 percent to 37 percent. But in the Deep South, the number of independents rose steeply from 14 percent in 1952 to 32 percent in 1976 (and would rise even further, to 35 percent, by 1984).\n\nAlthough the number of self-identified independents has fallen slightly in the 1990s and 2000s, about 30 percent of American voters still say they are independents (as measured by self-identification).\n\nBut by other measures, the number of independents has not increased at all.\n\nSeveral analyses conclude that (whether through survey error or misconceptualization of the nature of political independence) the number of independent voters has remained relatively unchanged in the United States since the 1950s.\n\nIn the United States, voter identification as an independent varies widely across regions as well as states. Inter-party competition, the organizational strength of each party, electoral variables (such as the ease of voter registration, voting procedures, the timing of primaries and elections, etc.), and even turnout seem to greatly affect the number of independents in a state. The effect of these variables is not uniform across all the states, either.\n\nIn the British parliamentary system, a similar concept of a \"floating voter\" is used to describe voters who can change their voting alignment and freedom from political parties. This term may also be applied in referendum votes, such as in the vote for \"Brexit\".\n\nDutch politics also uses the term floating voter to describe party non-affiliation.\n\nThere is a large swing vote in Iran, known as \"Party of the Wind\" (), or \"grey vote\" (), which can be rapidly excited.\n\nBecause independent voters do not have strong affectional ties to political parties, scholars who adhere to the self-identification method for measuring political independence theorize that independents may be more susceptible to the appeals of third-party candidates. It has also been suggested that the more independent voters, the more volatile elections and the political system will be. Others hypothesize that the amount of ticket-splitting will increase, leading to greater parity between the strongest political parties, an increase in the number of minor political parties (particularly \"down-ballot\" in state, county or local races), or possibly even a breakdown in the political party system.\n\nHowever, scholars who hold to the behavioral measure of determining political independence point out that there has been little change in the level of ticket-splitting since the initial upsurge in the 1950s. They also point out that, when independents who strongly lean toward one party are included in the same group as that party's strong partisans, there has also been little change in party loyalty since the 1950s. For example, partisan Republicans and independents who lean Republican tend to vote for Republican candidates just as frequently in the 1990s as they did in the 1950s. Indeed, in the United States, the tendency of both strong and weak partisans to vote a straight ticket in down-ballot races is even stronger than it is for presidential and congressional races.\n\nMany scholars also point out that partisanship is only one of many variables which predict voting choice. A decline in partisanship may have little to no impact on election outcomes, and much depends on fluctuations in these other factors.\n\nFor more than half a century, the concept of a realigning election—a dramatic shift in the electoral coalition supporting the existing political system—has been an important one in political theory. First enunciated by V. O. Key, Jr. in 1955, the theory of realigning elections suggested that certain \"critical elections\" created sudden, massive shifts in the electorate. The political party and policies of the status quo were changed, and a new governing coalition installed which would rule for decades until the next critical election. The theory of critical elections fit well with what scholars knew about generational effects and the emerging literature on \"major shocks\" as a variable in determining the existence, direction, and strength of partisanship. It also helped explain the radical shifts in national politics which occurred irregularly in American history. Scholars also hypothesized that realigning elections rejuvenated public support for the political system, which helped explain the relative stability of American political structures. In time, scholars refined the theory somewhat. The concept of \"secular realignment\" was developed to account for gradual shifts in politics which had similar effects (eventually) to a critical realigning election. Some studies concluded that \"secular realignment\" came in short, jerky, periods called \"punctuations.\" Initially, the concept of a realigning election was monolithic, that is, the effects were believed to be national in effect. But beginning in the 1980s, political scientists began to conclude that realigning elections could occur on sub-national levels (such as regions or even within states).\n\nBut with the \"rise of the independent voter\" and no realigning election, scholars developed the theory of the \"dealigning election.\" In the dealigning election, all political parties lose support as partisanship decreases and political independence rises. Split-ticket voting and issue-oriented voting increase, leading to political volatility. Divided government (one party controls the executive branch, while another controls the legislature) becomes the norm.\n\nA number of scholars have dismissed the theory of realignment and dealignment, however. They argue that the concept is vague and the data do not support mass change in electoral behavior. The large number of qualifications which must be made to the theory of critical elections has rendered it useless, it is argued. The theory of secular realignment has been particularly criticized. The replacement of elderly voters (who die) with a new generation of voters (who come of age and are eligible to vote) is normal, not a unique and irregular \"punctuation\" or \"surge,\" it is claimed. Still other scholars claim there are no regional dealignment variations while others argue that the concept of realignment and dealignment is no longer useful in an era in which political parties are no longer very important in the political system.\n\nScholars argue that political parties play a critical supportive role in democracies. Parties regulate the type and number of people seeking election, mobilize voters and enhance turnout, and provide the coalition-building structure essential for office-holders to govern. Parties also serve as critical reference groups for voters, framing issues and providing and filtering information. These functions, it is claimed cannot otherwise be accomplished, and democracies collapse without them. Only political parties serve these roles.\n\nDealignment—the rise in the number of independent voters—has an extremely deleterious effect on democracy, these scholars claim. Dealignment leads to the rise of candidate-centered elections in which parties and ideologies play little part. Without parties, candidates rely ever-more heavily on mass media for communication, political action committees (PACs) for funds, special interest groups for staff, and political consultants for expertise. The increasing reliance on mass communication leads to a withering of political discourse as the sound bite and an emphasis on the horse-race aspect of politics becomes the norm. This limits the amount and kind of information the public receives, leading to less choice for voters. When voters can stay at home and watch television rather than participate in civic life, the public no longer perceives the need to become involved in democracy—and so the civic life of the democracy withers. As PACs and interest groups become more important, the number of people speaking to the public, providing political information and different political choices and views, declines. Additionally, PAC and interest group spokespeople may not be representative of the public or the groups they claim to speak for, creating disenfranchisement of various (often minority) groups. As independent voting and ticket-splitting rise, parties seek to insulate themselves from the whipsaw effect of elections. The power of incumbency becomes increasingly important, and accessibility by the public declines. Parties seek increasingly moderate positions in order to stay electorally viable, further limiting political choice (\"both parties look and sound the same\"). As the parties distance themselves from the average voter and seem to offer limited policy options, dealignment worsens. As ideology plays less and less a part in elections, it becomes more and more difficult for parties to forge coalitions of like-minded officeholders. Governmental deadlock becomes common, further encouraging independent voting as citizens perceive \"their\" party to be ineffective. As ticket-splitting rises, divided government becomes the norm, making it even more difficult for office-holders to enact and implement policies. Politics becomes increasingly volatile, with first one party and then another governing. Although parties once held politicians accountable for their actions, their increasing irrelevance in politics leads to a decline in accountability (and thus even less responsiveness and less democracy). The \"Imperial Presidency\" becomes more important, since single officeholders with great power become the only politicians capable of governing.\n\nOther scholars have concluded that dealignment has not harmed democracy. Political parties have adapted to the realities of large numbers of independent voters, it is argued. The candidate-centered election has actually revitalized parties, and led to new party structures and behaviors which have allowed parties to survive in the age of mass communication. A minority view, however, suggests that the evidence for a resurgence of political parties too equivocal, and that scholars lack the theoretical concepts to make such judgments.\n\nYet another strain of thought has concluded that \"realignment\" is occurring. The slow \"secular realignment\" is not yet over, these scholars say. Regional differences in the level and impact of dealignment simply point up the fact that major shifts in political coalitions are occurring. Slowly but surely, these studies conclude, realignment is happening and will be obvious within a generation. These scholars argue that the surge in independent voters which began in the 1960s has ended, and that there are distinct signs that partisanship is on the rise again.\n\n\n"}

Due to his fighting prowess, he was known as Tourkofagos (), literally meaning the \"Turk-Eater\".\n\nThe date and place of Nikitaras' birth are disputed, but he is thought to have been born either in the village of Nedoussa (Νέδουσα) in the Peloponnesian province of Messenia or in Leontari in Arcadia circa 1784. He was a nephew of Theodoros Kolokotronis, the most important Greek military leader of the Revolution. Turkish authorities tried to capture him, as well as Kolokotronis, but he escaped and joined his uncle in the British-held Ionian Islands.\n\nWhen the Greek war of Independence began, both returned to the mainland. He was with Kolokotronis, who commanded the Greek army at the Siege of Tripoli early in the war. When the commander and his men tried to escape the city, Nikitaras and his troops cut off the escape of the Turkish commander and his troops and slaughtered them. Nikitas achieved fame and his sobriquet \"Turk-Eater\" in the Battle of Dervenakia, where he is said to have used five swords: four broke from excessive use. During the civil war within the Revolution, he sided with his uncle against the faction around Alexander Mavrokordatos.\n\nNikitaras was a strong patriot, not corrupt like many of the leaders of the Revolution. When Ioannis Kolettis asked him to kill a rival, Odysseas Androutsos, in exchange for a government position, Nikitaras refused the offer and became angry with Kolettis. He also refused to take booty after battle, a normal practice of Balkan irregulars at the time. After the Revolution he and his family were living in poverty.\n\nAfter the war, Nikitaras was jailed with his uncle Kolokotronis as strong opponents of the Bavarian King Otto of Greece. He was also a strong campaigner for the rights of those who fought in the Revolution. Nikitaras was released from prison in 1841, but the period in jail broke his health and he died in 1849 in Piraeus.\n\nHe is especially famous for his words during the Third Siege of Missolonghi. When he arrived in the city with supplies, soldiers, who had not been paid in months, asked him if he had brought any money. Nikitaras, angry, flung down his sword, a weapon taken from a Turk he had killed, uttering the words: \"I have only my sword, and that I gladly give for my country.\" Nikitaras is remembered in the poem by Nikos Gatsos, \"The Knight and Death\".\n"}

Located in the southern section of the Wind River Range (or \"Winds\" for short), the cirque is a very popular destination for technical rock climbers. Climber Orrin Bonney gave the area its current name in 1941 after his survey of the cirque. Prior to this, few if any visitors had ventured into the cirque due to the remote location. The cirque is an almost circular hole or valley carved by a glacier that retreated over 8,000 years ago. As is true with the rest of the Winds, the mountains are composed almost entirely of granite. The Continental Divide spans the crest of the main peaks.\n\nThe towers average lower in altitude than the highest mountains in the northern Winds, with Lizard Head Peak () being the tallest. Other individual mountains in the cirque include Shark's Nose, Warbonnet, Warrior Peak, Wolf's Head and Pingora Peak. There are hundreds of routes to choose from in difficulties ranging from 5.1 to 5.11a and since the mountains are composed primarily of granite rock, there is good anchoring. These climbs include two featured in Steck and Roper's \"Fifty Classic Climbs of North America\" the \"Northeast Face of Pingora\" (IV, 5.9) and the \"East Ridge of the Wolf's Head\" (III, 5.6).\n\nFor both the climber and backpacker, access to the cirque from the west from Pinedale, Wyoming requires a drive, partly paved and partly gravel, to the Big Sandy trailhead. There is a small National Forest campground at the trailhead. An hike beginning at above sea level is relatively level the first and becomes very steep the last mile (1.6 km) and ascends to Jackass Pass at , crossing the continental divide. From there one must descend a steep half mile (800 m) to Lonesome Lake, which is one of four lakes in the cirque. Expect the trail to be busy in July and August as the cirque is the most popular hiking and climbing destination in the Wind River Range. Lonesome Lake was the first lake in the Wind River Range whose water was deemed unfit for consumption due to human waste and consequently, no camping is permitted within a quarter mile (400 m) of the lake. The granitic rocks allow poor filtration of ground water and the ability of many alpine lakes to cleanse themselves is often poorer than one might find at lower altitudes.\n\nEncountering bears is a concern in the Wind River Range. There are other concerns as well, including bugs, wildfires, adverse snow conditions and nighttime cold temperatures.\n\nImportantly, there have been notable incidents, including accidental deaths, due to falls from steep cliffs (a misstep could be fatal in this class 4/5 terrain) and due to falling rocks, over the years, including 1993, 2007 (involving an experienced NOLS leader), 2015 and 2018. Other incidents include a seriously injured backpacker being airlifted near SquareTop Mountain in 2005, and a fatal hiker incident (from an apparent accidental fall) in 2006 that involved state search and rescue. The U.S. Forest Service does not offer updated aggregated records on the official number of fatalities in the Wind River Range.\n"}

This group comprises the minerals lanthanite-(La), lanthanite-(Ce), and lanthanite-(Nd). This mineral group has the general chemical formula of (\"REE\")(CO)·8(HO). Lanthanites include La, Ce, and Nd as major elements and often contain subordinate amounts of other REEs including praseodymium (Pr), samarium (Sm), europium (Eu) and dysprosium (Dy). The lanthanite crystal structure consists of layers of 10-fold coordinated REE-oxygen (O) polyhedra and carbonate (CO) groups connected by hydrogen bonds to interlayer water molecules, forming a highly hydrated structure.\n\nLanthanites are frequently found as secondary minerals formed by the weathering of other minerals and occur as scales or tabular crystals. Originally identified at Bastnäs, Sweden, they have subsequently been found in New Zealand, Japan, Madagascar, Wales, China, France, Germany, Greenland, Finland, Canada, Austria, Romania, Norway, Brazil, and the United States.\n\nRecently, a different mechanism of formation of lanthanites was discovered: Lanthanites also can form via a highly hydrated, nanoparticulate and poorly ordered carbonate precursor. The lifetime of this rare-earth bearing precursor as well as the kinetics of crystallization of the various REE-lanthanites are dependent on the specific trivalent rare-earth ion involved in the reaction. The times needed for lanthanites to fully crystallize increase linearly with the ionic potential of the trivalent rare-earth ion (La, Ce, Pr, Nd) present in their structure. The differences in these ion sizes and ionic potential as well as differences in dehydration energy of the trivalent rare-earth ions control the lifetime of the poorly ordered precursor and thus also the crystallization kinetics of the lanthanites. Furthermore, they also affect the structural characteristics (e.g. unit-cell dimensions and standard shape) of the crystals.\n\n\n"}

It was derived from the German World War II BMW 018 design, and developed by ex-BMW engineers through a progression of more powerful models. The name is derived from its original design group, Atelier technique aéronautique de Rickenbach near Lindau within the French Occupation Zone of Germany. The Atar powered many of the French post-war jet aircraft, including the Vautour, Étendard and Super Étendard, Super Mystère and several models of the Mirage.\n\nHermann Oestrich's team in charge of the development of the BMW 003 engine had moved to the town of Stassfurt, near Magdeburg, in February 1945. An underground production factory was being set up in a salt mine outside town by C.G. Rheinhardt in a desperate attempt to continue engine production in face of the now overwhelming Allied air campaign. This mine is well known historically as it was also being used for the storage of uranium compounds as part of the Nazi atomic bomb program.\n\nThe town of Stassfurt surrendered to US forces on 12 April 1945, and Oestrich hid much of the technical data in a local cemetery. The next day a ten-man team made up primarily of engineers from Pratt & Whitney arrived, and he handed the data over to them. Production restarted for US use while the war ground to a close, and the US forces cleared out the factory while they waited to turn the area over to the Soviets.\n\nOestrich had by this time moved to Munich for further interrogation, and from there to England at the request of British engine designer Roy Fedden. He had them work on the design of a turboprop engine for a proposed C-54 Skymaster-class four-engine transport. While working on this design, Őstrich was secretly approached by French DGER agents with an offer to take up further design of the 003 in France. The French forces had found a number of BMW 003 turbojet engines in their occupation zone after the war, and were interested in setting up a production line. These discussions had not progressed very far when Őstrich was allowed to return to Munich, only to be brought back to England in late August, then returned to Munich again where the US offered him and a hand-selected team jobs in the US, but without their families.\n\nÖstrich instead accepted the French invitation, and by September had been set up at the former Dornier factories in Rickenbach in the French Zone. Here they were soon joined by other former BMW engineers, as well as those from a number of other German firms, bringing the team to about 200 members. The group was named the Atelier Technique Aéronautique Rickenbach (Rickenbach Aeronautical Technical Workshop in French), or ATAR. They had re-engineered the 003 design as the ATAR 101 (model R.101) by October, and granted a production contract on the proviso that actual production would be carried out in France. In January a further five-year contract was offered to the entire team, including protected wages, provisions for their families, few travel restrictions, and the possibility of French citizenship. The contract was signed on 25 April 1946, and the drawings for the ATAR 101 were sent to SNECMA for production.\n\nThe first engine took some time to assemble. The first parts were available as early as May 1946, but a complete compressor or turbine was not ready until the middle of the next year. The first complete engine finally ran on 26 March 1948. By April 5 it had been brought up to thrust and was continually improved until it reached by October. During this time a new turbine made of solid high-temperature steels replaced the earlier air-cooled models, allowing for better aerodynamic shaping and an improved compression ratio. By January 1950 several additional engines had joined the program, bringing the total running time to over 1,000 hours, and a thrust of , making it among the most powerful engines of the era. The BMW 003 that it was developed from provided only , less than a third of the Atar.\n\nThe ATAR 101B introduced Nimonic turbine blades and more stator blades as well as a number of changes to fix minor problems seen in the earlier experimental models. The first B model passed a 150-hour endurance test in February 1951 at . A flight test followed on 5 December 1951 in the Dassault Ouragan, and starting on 27 March 1952, under the wings of a Gloster Meteor F.4. After delivering the initial production run of B models, the Atar 101C used an improved compressor and combustion chamber, raising the thrust to . The Atar 101D featured a slightly larger turbine with new high-temperature alloys that allowed the exit temperature to rise to 1,000 °C and the thrust to . The D model also included a new exhaust consisting of a long pipe ending in a nozzle with two \"eyelid\" shutters in place of the earlier fore/aft moving cone on the inside, a feature of the WW II Junkers Jumo 004 axial-flow turbojet, which was known as the \"Zwiebel\" (onion) from its shape. The Atar 101E added a \"zeroth\" compressor stage, raising the overall pressure ratio to 4.8:1 and the thrust to , surpassing the projected thrust of 34.3 kN (7,700 lbf)of the German BMW 018 turbojet still being developed in 1945. Various Atar 101 models were tested on a wide variety of aircraft.\n\nAn afterburner was incorporated into the D model to produce the Atar 101F of , while the same addition to the E model produced the ATAR 101G. These were flight tested on the Dassault Mystère II in August 1954, but they did not see production on this aircraft. Their first success was on the Dassault Super Mystère which first flew under Rolls-Royce Avon power on 2 March 1955, and followed by the 101G powered version on 15 May 1956. Production started in 1957 with a contract for 370 aircraft, but this was later cut back to 180 in light of the performance of the Dassault Mirage III which was then undergoing testing.\n\nWith the Atar 101 now sitting at the low end of the power scale, in 1954 SNECMA started the design of a more radical upgrade, the Atar 08. Overall design and dimensions were similar to the 101, but the new engine included a nine-stage compressor in place of the earlier seven-stage one, and a smaller two-stage turbine to power it. There were many detail improvements as well, including the replacement of the original compressor rotor with a new one made of magnesium alloy. The first Atar 08 B-3 produced and had a slightly improved overall pressure ratio of 5.5:1.\n\nA new and much improved afterburner was designed for the engine, resulting in the Atar 09. It was first tested in January 1957 at , and was soon improved to . A further improved afterburner with an eighteen-flap nozzle in place of the two eyelids of the earlier designs was introduced on the 09C model in December 1959. This version also featured a new starter from Microturbo. The Atar 9D replaced the exhaust and afterburner area with one made of titanium that allowed continual operation at Mach 2, up from the C's 1.4. Air cooling was re-introduced for the Atar 9K models, further improving overall performance, and especially fuel economy.\n\nWith the Atar 8 and 9 series, the long ten years of development had finally resulted in a successful commercial design. Thousands were produced for a variety of aircraft, including the Étendard and Super Étendard strike aircraft, Mirage III, Mirage 5 and Mirage F1 fighters, the Mirage IV bomber, and a variety of test aircraft.\n\nIn 1955 the French government started a project to explore flight speeds up to Mach 3.0. SNECMA began studies on an engine to power it, initially consisting of the compressor design of the existing Atar 101, but replacing all of the light alloys with steels in order to handle the increased operating temperatures. This also demanded the use of an air-cooled turbine, similar to the ones from the earliest prototypes. Such an engine, the M.26, ran in May 1957, giving 47 kN (10,364 lbf) without an afterburner. Further improvements led to the M.28, which ran in September 1958 at 52 kN (11,466 lbf).\n\nThis work led to the Super Atar design of 85 kN with afterburning. This version also included variable stators, which were in the process of being widely introduced in the industry. However, the project to build the test aircraft, the \"Griffon III\", never went ahead and SNECMA ended development of the Super Atar in 1960.\n\nThe Atar design was also used for a variety of larger, smaller, and experimental developments. Of particular note are the R.104 Vulcain, a scaled-up Atar, and the much smaller R.105 Vesta. Both engines were developed in parallel to the Atar in the early 1950s in order to fill particular performance niches, the Vulcain for the Mystère IV D, and the Vesta for a variety of designs. None of these entered production, however; the Mystère IV D was cancelled, and the Vesta lost out to the Turboméca Gabizo, which was also abandoned.\n\nThe original Atar 101 featured a seven-stage axial compressor using aluminum alloy blades attached to an aluminum rotor. The front bearing was held in place by four vanes, with the \"left\" one as seen from the front containing a power takeoff shaft. One unique feature of the Atar designs was the separate Atar 5000 accessories section, which could be mounted in front of the engine, driven by an extension shaft. The combustion area consisted of twenty steel flame cans arranged in a \"canular\" layout, exiting into the single-stage turbine. Early models were 2.85 m long, 0.9 m in diameter, and weighed 850 kg, while The C models and on were 3.68 m lone including the long extension, 0.89 m in diameter, and weighed 940 kg. Later versions were generally similar to the C model, although the inclusion of the afterburner increased lengths to 5.23 m, and weights varied from 925 to 1,240 kg depending on the model.\n\nThe Atar 8 and 9 used a 9-stage compressor similar to the 101, but including a steel first stage in order to improve resistance to foreign object damage. The turbine included two stages. Length and width remained the same as the 101 models, deliberately, but weights further increased up to 1,350 kg for the 9B.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was active in the non-Marxist wing of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) during the Weimar Republic. He attempted to formulate the theoretical foundations of the social-democratic relations to the state, and nationalism. He was politically active in the relatively conservative Hofgeismarer Kreis of the SPD and is believed to have authored the group's statement of principles.\n\nHeller was born in Teschen, Austrian Silesia. In World War I he volunteered for the army, served in an Austro-Hungarian artillery regiment and got a heart disease at the front. In 1921 Heller was married to the dancer Gertrud Falke (daughter of famed German poet Gustav Falke). They had three children, Jane, Ruth, and Lukas. Lucy Heller, Bruno Heller Emily Heller, and Zoe Heller are his grandchildren. In 1928 Heller had a short relationship with Elisabeth Langgässer. Their daughter, Cordelia, was born in 1929.\n\nIn his short life, he was involved in a number of political debates and controversies, most notably with Hans Kelsen, Carl Schmitt and Max Adler. In short, Heller's theories are both a reinterpretation of Hegelian social theory and an emendation of Bernstein's revisionism. Heller calls for the integration of the working class in the social, cultural and political structures of the nation-state. Against Carl Schmitt he argued that it is not so much the state of emergency, but rather the state of social and political stability which defines the sovereign. He is generally perceived to have been a major influence on Carlo Schmid who, in turn, drafted most of the German Constitution and was the main force behind the reform of the SPD.\n\nHeller was forced to go into exile in 1933 with his wife and children, and died in Madrid in the same year, leaving his Magnum Opus, the \"Staatslehre\", unfinished. His collected works, in three volumes, have been published by the \"Mohr Verlag\" of Tübingen.\n\nRecently, there is a renewed interest in Heller's work, especially in Germany.

Envoys and ambassadors had also gathered intelligence, often using bribery. Such agents included the 17th-century Polish poet Jan Andrzej Morsztyn.\n\nPolish kings and Polish–Lithuanian military commanders (\"hetmans\") such as Stanisław Koniecpolski maintained intelligence networks. The \"hetmans\" were responsible for intelligence-gathering in the Ottoman Empire, its vassal states and disputed territories such as Wallachia, Moldavia and Transylvania. Intelligence networks also operated in Muscovy and among the restless Cossacks.\n\nIn 1683, during the Battle of Vienna, the Polish merchant-spy Jerzy Franciszek Kulczycki secured a promise of military assistance for Vienna, besieged by the Turkish forces of Kara Mustafa Pasha, and thus facilitated the victory of a Christian European coalition led by Polish King Jan III Sobieski. Kulczycki is reported to have received as reward for his services the Turks' supplies of coffee beans and to have established Vienna's first coffee house.\n\nDuring the period when Poland had been partitioned (beginning in 1772, until 1918) by three adjacent empires, intelligence played an important role in patriotic Poles' surveillance of their occupiers and in their planning and conduct of successive Polish uprisings.\n\nIn 1914 Józef Piłsudski created the Polish Military Organization, an intelligence and special-operations organization which worked alongside the Polish Legions. As such, it was independent of Austro-Hungary and loyal to Piłsudski and to a future independent Poland.\n\nImmediately upon achieving independence in 1918, Poland established armed forces. Reflecting the influence of the French Military Mission to Poland, the Polish General Staff was divided into divisions entrusted with specific tasks:\n\nDivision II (colloquially, \"\"Dwójka,\"\" \"Two\") was formed in October 1918, even before Poland had declared her independence. Initially called the \"General Staff Information Department,\" Division II was divided into sections (\"sekcje\"):\n\nAn extensive network of domestic and foreign informants developed rapidly. This was due to Poland's poor economic situation, itself the result of over a century of foreign occupation. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, Poland's economic and political situation had forced hundreds of thousands to emigrate. With the advent of Polish independence, many émigrés offered their services to Polish intelligence agencies. Others Poles who had been living in the former Russian Empire and were now making their way home through war-torn Russia, provided priceless intelligence on the logistics, order of battle and status of the parties in the Russian Civil War.\n\nIn Western Europe (especially in Germany, France and Belgium) the Polish diaspora often formed the backbone of heavy industry; some one million people of Polish descent lived in the Ruhr Valley alone. Many of these provided intelligence on industrial production and economic conditions.\n\nAfter the outbreak of the Polish-Soviet War in early 1919, intelligence from the east proved vital to Poland's survival against a far superior enemy. A separate organization was formed within Polish Intelligence, taking over most intelligence duties for the duration of the war. This was a \"Biuro Wywiadowcze\" (Intelligence Bureau) comprising seven departments:\n\n\nThe fourth department, Offensive Intelligence \"C\", became the most developed because it carried out all the duties connected with \"front-line\" reconnaissance and intelligence, as well as \"long-range\" intelligence and surveillance in countries surrounding Bolshevik Russia, including Siberia (still in the hands of the White Russians), Turkey, Persia, China, Mongolia and Japan.\n\nThe third department, Offensive Intelligence \"B,\" controlled an intelligence network in European Russia.\n\nAdditional intelligence was obtained from Russian defectors and prisoners of war who crossed the Polish lines in their thousands, especially after the 1920 Battle of Warsaw.\n\nAfter the Polish–Soviet War and the Treaty of Riga, Polish Intelligence had to restructure to cope with new challenges. Though Poland had won most of her border conflicts (most notably the war with Russia and the Greater Poland Uprising of 1918–19 against Germany), her international situation was unenviable. By mid-1921, Section II had been restructured into three main departments, each overseeing a number of offices:\n\nUntil the late 1930s the Soviet Union was seen as the most likely aggressor and Poland's main adversary. Section II developed an extensive network of agents within Poland's eastern neighbor and other adjoining countries. In the early 1920s Polish intelligence began developing a network for \"offensive intelligence.\" The Eastern Office (\"Referat \"Wschód\"\") had several dozen bureaus, mostly attached to Polish consulates in Moscow, Kiev, Leningrad, Kharkov and Tbilisi.\n\nShort-range reconnaissance was carried out by the Border Defense Corps, created in 1924. On a number of occasions, soldiers crossed the border disguised as smugglers, partisans or bandits. They gathered information on the disposition of Soviet troops and the morale of the Soviet populace. At the same time, Soviet forces carried out analogous missions on Polish soil. The situation finally stabilized in 1925; however, such missions continued to occur occasionally.\n\nPolish Intelligence produced fairly accurate pictures of the capabilities of Poland's main potential adversaries—Germany and the Soviet Union. Nonetheless, this information was of little avail when war came in September 1939. Good intelligence could not offset the overwhelming superiority of the German and Soviet armed forces. The conquest of Poland took four weeks—too short a time for intelligence services to make a significant contribution. With Poland conquered, her intelligence services had to evacuate their headquarters to allied French and British territories.\n\nUntil 1939 Polish intelligence services did not, as a rule, collaborate with the intelligence services of other countries with exception of Imperial Japan. A partial exception was also France, Poland's closest ally; even then cooperation was lukewarm, with neither side sharing their most precious secrets. An important exception was the long-term collaboration between France's Gustave Bertrand and Poland's Cipher Bureau, headed by Gwido Langer. The situation only began to change in 1939, when war appeared certain and Britain and France entered into a formal military alliance with Poland. The most important result of the subsequent information-sharing was the disclosure to France and Britain of Polish techniques and equipment for breaking German Enigma machine ciphers.\n\nThe initial break into the Enigma ciphers had been made in late 1932 by mathematician Marian Rejewski, working for the Polish General Staff's Cipher Bureau. His work was facilitated, perhaps decisively, by intelligence provided by Bertrand. With the help of fellow mathematicians Henryk Zygalski and Jerzy Różycki, Rejewski developed techniques to decrypt German Enigma-enciphered messages on a regular and timely basis.\n\nSix-and-a-half years after the initial Polish decryption of Enigma ciphers, French and British intelligence representatives were briefed on Polish achievements at a trilateral conference held at Cipher Bureau facilities in the Kabaty Woods, just south of Warsaw, on July 26, 1939, barely five weeks before the outbreak of World War II. This formed the basis for early Enigma decryption by the British at Bletchley Park, northwest of London. Without the head start provided by Poland, British reading of Enigma encryptions might have been delayed several years, if it would have gotten off the ground at all.\n\nKey Polish Cipher Bureau personnel escaped from Poland on September 17, 1939, on the Soviet Union's entry into eastern Poland, and eventually reached France. There, at \"PC Bruno\" outside Paris, they resumed cracking Enigma ciphers through the \"Phony War\" (October 1939 – May 1940). Following the fall of northern France to the Germans, the Polish-French-Spanish cryptological organization, sponsored by French Major Gustave Bertrand, continued its work at \"Cadix\" in the Vichy \"Free Zone\" until it was occupied by German forces in November 1942.\n\nAfter the 1939 invasion of Poland, practically all of the General Staff's Section II (Intelligence) command apparatus managed to escape to Romania and soon reached France and Britain. Reactivating agent networks throughout Europe, they immediately began cooperating with French and British intelligence agencies. After the subsequent fall of France, most of Section II ended up in Britain.\n\nAt that time Britain was in a difficult situation, badly in need of intelligence from occupied Europe after rapid German advances had disrupted its networks and put German forces into areas where Britain had few agents. Following the personal intervention of Churchill and Sikorski in September 1940, cooperation between British and Polish intelligence organizations entered a new phase.\n\nThe Poles placed their Section II at the disposal of the British, but as a \"quid pro quo\" requested and obtained (at that time without any reservations) the right to use, without British oversight, their own ciphers which they had developed in France. The Poles were the only Allied country that was given this unique status, though as the war progressed it was challenged by some agencies of the British government. Due to support from members of the British Special Operations Executive, the Poles kept their ciphers to the end of hostilities.\n\nIn the first half of 1941 Polish agents in France supplied Britain with intelligence on U-boat movements from French Atlantic ports. The Polish network in France grew to 1,500 members and, before and during Operation Overlord, supplied vital information about the German military in France. Agents working in Poland in the spring of 1941 supplied extensive intelligence about German preparations to invade the Soviet Union (Operation Barbarossa).\n\nAgency Africa was set up in July 1941 in Algiers by Mieczyslaw Zygfryd Slowikowski, Lt. Col. Gwido Langer and Major Maksymilian Ciężki; using the codename \"\"Rygor\"\" (Polish for \"Rigor\"). Their information was used by the Americans and British to plan the amphibious Operation Torch landings in North Africa in November 1942, the first large-scale Allied landings of the war. \n\nPolish spies also documented German atrocities being perpetrated at Auschwitz (Witold Pilecki's report) and elsewhere in Poland against Jewish and non-Jewish populations. Polish intelligence gave the British crucial information on Germany's secret-weapons projects, including the V-1 and V-2 rockets, enabling Britain to set back these German programs by bombing the main development facility at Peenemünde in 1943. Poland's networks supplied the western Allies with intelligence on nearly all aspects of the German war effort. Of 45,770 reports received by British intelligence during the war, nearly half (22,047) came from Polish agents.\n\nOn March 15, 1946, Section II was officially disbanded, and its archives were taken over by Britain. At Section II's dissolution, it had 170 officers and 3,500 agents, excluding headquarters staff. Very likely at least some of the Polish agents continued working directly for Britain during the Cold War.\n\nThe Polish intelligence contribution to Britain's war effort was kept secret due to Cold War exigencies. In later years, as official British histories were released, the Polish intelligence role barely rated a mention. Only when British wartime decryption of Enigma ciphers was made public in the 1970s, did a Polish contribution begin to become known; even then, however, the early versions published in Britain (and some versions even to the end of the 20th century) claimed that Polish intelligence had only been able to \"steal\" a German Enigma machine. The truth, which had previously been disclosed in Bertrand's book and would later be detailed in papers by Marian Rejewski (who had survived the war and lived to 1980), made slow headway against British and American obfuscations, mendacities and fabrications. The Polish Enigma-breaking effort had been much more sophisticated than those English-language accounts made out, and had in fact relied largely on mathematical analysis. Historians' efforts to gain access to documentation of other Polish intelligence operations met with British stonewalling and with claims that the pertinent Polish archives had been destroyed by the British.\n\nPolish intelligence supplied valuable intelligence to the Allies; 48% of all reports received by the British secret services from continental Europe in between 1939 and 1945 came from Polish sources. The total number of those reports is estimated about bout 80,000, and 85% of them were deemed high or better quality. Despite Poland becoming occupied, the Polish intelligence network not only survived but grew rapidly, and near the end of the war had over 1,600 registered agents.\n\nWestern Allies had limited intelligence assets in Central and Eastern Europe, and extensive Polish intelligence network in place proved to be a major asset, even described as \"the only allied intelligence assets on the Continent\" following the French capitulation. According to , for the Western Allies, the intelligence provided by the Home Army was considered to be the best source of information on the Eastern Front.\n\nOn occupying Poland and installing a puppet government, the Soviet Union created new Polish intelligence and internal-security agencies. The Soviet special services had begun training Polish officers as early as 1943. That year, some 120 Poles had begun training at an NKVD school in Kuybyshev (now Samara). At the same time, in NKVD-NKGB schools all over the USSR, hundreds of Germans, Romanians, Czechoslovaks and Bulgarians had also undergone the same training in order to prepare them for work in future special services in their respective countries.\n\nIn July 1944 in Moscow the temporary Polish puppet government was established by the name of the Polish Committee of National Liberation (\"Polski Komitet Wyzwolenia Narodowego\"), or PKWN. The PKWN was organized as thirteen departments (\"resorty\"). One of them was the Department of Public Security (Resort Bezpieczeństwa Publicznego), or RBP, headed by long-time Polish communist Stanisław Radkiewicz. The largest and the most important department in the RBP, Department 1, was responsible for counter-espionage and headed by Roman Romkowski. By September 1945 Department 1 had become so large that three additional departments were created, as well as two separate sections. By the close of 1944, the Department of Public Security totaled 3000 employees.\n\nOn December 31, 1944, the PKWN was joined by several members of the Polish government in exile, among them Stanisław Mikołajczyk. It was then transformed into the Provisional Government of Republic of Poland (\"Rząd Tymczasowy Republiki Polskiej\", or RTRP), and the departments were renamed as ministries.\n\nThe Ministry of Public Security was responsible for both intelligence and counter-espionage, as well as surveillance of citizens and suppression of dissent. They generally did not employ former officers of the \"Dwojka\" or follow the traditions of pre-war Polish intelligence services. Personnel were recruited for their \"political reliability\". New formations were trained by Soviet NKVD experts. Additionally, and especially in the early years (1945–49), Soviet officers in Polish uniforms overlooked their operations. After Joseph Stalin's death in 1953 and the later defection of Col. Józef Światło, the Ministry of Public Security was canceled and replaced by two separate administrations - the Committee for Public Security (Komitet do Spraw Bezpieczeństwa Publicznego, or Kds.BP) and the Ministry of Internal Affairs (Ministerstwo Spraw Wewnętrznych or MSW).\n\nThe Kds.BP was responsible for intelligence and government protection and. From September 3, 1955 to 28 November 1956, the Main Directorate of Information of the Polish Army (Główny Zarząd Informacji Wojska Polskiego), which was responsible for the military police and counter-espionage agency, was also controlled by the Kds.BP. The MSW was responsible for the supervision of local governments, Militsiya, correctional facilities, fire rescue and the border and internal guards.\n\nThe next big changes came in 1956. The Committee for Public Security was canceled and the Ministry of Internal Affairs took over their responsibilities. The MSW assumed control of the political police, under the Służba Bezpieczeństwa.\n\nFrom 1956 to the fall of communism in Poland the MSW was one of the biggest and strongest administrations. During this period its responsibilities included intelligence, counter-espionage, anti-state activity (SB), government protection, confidential communications, supervision of the local governments, militsiya, correctional facilities, and fire rescue. The Ministry of Internal Affairs was divided into departments. The most important of these were the first second and third departments. The first dealt with foreign operations and intelligence gathering, the second with spy activities both by Poland and other countries and the third was responsible for anti-state activities and the protection of the country's secrets.\n\nWith the exception of its own departments and sections, the MSW also had control over the Militsiya (Komenda Główna Milicji Obywatelskiej or KG/MO), fire rescue (Komenda Główna Straży Pożarnych or KG/SP), territorial anti-aircraft defense, (Komenda Główna Terenowej Obrony Przeciwlotniczej KG/TOP), management of geodesy and cartography, (Główny Zarząd Geodezji i Kartografii) and health services (Centralny Zarząd Służby Zdrowia). Ministry of Internal Affairs also had control over the command of the Internal Security Corp. (Dowództwo Korpusu Bezpieczeństwa Wewnętrznego or KBW), command of the Border Guard (Dowództwo Wojsk Ochrony Pogranicza or KOP), and management of Information of Internal Troops (Zarząd Informacji Wojsk Wewnetrznych). Through the 1980s the MSW had 24,390 staff in Security Services, 62,276 in the Citizen's Militsiya, 12,566 in Motorized Reserves of the Citizens Militia (Zmotoryzowane Odwody Milicji Obywatelskiej, or ZOMO), 20,673 in Administratively-Economic Units (Jednostki administracyjno-gospodarcze) and 4,594 in ministry schools, not including students.\n\nThe first military special services in Poland after World War II were created in 1943 as part of the Polish military in the USSR. First organ that dealt with military counterespionage was called Directorate of Information by the commander-in-chief of the Polish Army (\"Zarząd Informacji Naczelnego Dowódcy Wojska Polskiego\", or ZI NDWP). On November 30, 1944, the commander-in-chief of the Polish Army, general Michał Rola-Żymierski, transformed the ZI NDWP into the Main Directorate of Information of the Polish Army (Główny Zarząd Informacji Wojska Polskiego, or GZI WP) in his 95th order. From 30 November 1950, the GZI WP became the Main Directorate of Information of the Ministry of Defense (\"Główny Zarząd Informacji Ministerstwa Obrony Narodowej\", or GZI MON). In September 1955 GZI MON became part of the Committee for Public Security (Komitet do spraw Bezpieczeństwa Publicznego), which was the successor of Ministerstwo Bezpieczeństwa Publicznego, more commonly known as the Urząd Bezpieczeństwa or UB, and the name was changed to the Main Directorate of Information of the Committee for Public Security, or GZI KdsBP. In November 1956 the GZI Kds.BP separated from the Committee for Public Security, and returned to its previous role, becoming again the Main Directorate of Information of the Ministry of Defense. After the reform instituted by Władysław Gomułka in 1956, and the role the GZI played in repressions and executions, the Main Directorate of Information of Ministry of Defense was canceled in 1957 and replaced by the Military Internal Service (Wojskowa Służba Wewnętrzna, or WSW). The WSW continuously operated as the main military police and counterespionage service until the fall of communism in Poland.\n\nThe first Polish Military Intelligence after World War II was the Second Section of General Staff of the Polish People's Army (Oddział II Sztabu Generalnego Ludowego Wojska Polskiego, or Odział II Szt Gen LWP) and bore the same name as its precursor from before the war. Odział II Szt Gen WP was established on July 18, 1945, but its origins can be traced to May 1943, when the first reconnaissance company was created in Polish Army units in the USSR. Between July 1947 and June 5, 1950, the Second Section of General Staff of the Polish People's Army operated within the structure of the Ministry of Public Security together with the civilian intelligence branch as Department VII. On June 5, 1950, it returned to the Ministry of Defense. The first head of Odział II Szt Gen WP was Colonel Gieorgij Domeradzki. In November 1945 this position was occupied by General Wacław Komar, and between October 1950 and March 1951 by soviet officer Konstantin Kahnikov. The last commander of the Second Section of General Staff of the Polish People's Army was Igor Suchacki.\n\nOn November 15, 1951, Polish Defence Minister Konstantin Rokossovsky (in his 88th order) transformed the Second Section of General Staff of the Polish People's Army to Second Directorate of General Staff of the Polish Army (Zarząd II Sztabu Generalnego Wojska Polskiego). Internal organization was transformed from sections to directorates and intelligence work among the United States, Great Britain, the Federal Republic of Germany, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland and Austria was expanded to countries such as Norway, Spain, Portugal, Greece, Turkey and Israel. In 1990 the Second Directorate of General Staff of the Polish Army was join with the Military Internal Service (Wojskowa Służba Wewnętrzna, or WSW), in order to have intelligence and counter-intelligence working under one structure as the Second Directorate for Intelligence and Counter-intelligence (Zarząd II Wywiadu i Kontrwywiadu). In 1991 the Second Directorate for Intelligence and Counter-intelligence was transformed into Military Information Services (Wojskowe Służby Informacyjne, or WSI), and continues to function under this name.\n\nAfter the changes of 1989 the Służba Bezpieczeństwa was disbanded by the first free government under the prime minister, Tadeusz Mazowiecki. A new agency, called the State Protection Office (Urząd Ochrony Państwa, or UOP) was formed and staffed mainly by the former SB officers who successfully passed a verification procedure. Its mission was primarily general espionage and intelligence gathering as well as counter-espionage and fighting against high ranked organized crime. It was commanded by a career intelligence officer but was directly supervised by a civilian government official, Coordinator for the Special Services.\n\nMost of the time the agency evaded public attention, although it was dragged into political fighting over appointments of its chiefs, lustration and some perceived failures with organized crime cases. In 2002 the new, post-communist left-wing government reorganized the special services by dividing them into two agencies; the Internal Security Agency (Agencja Bezpieczeństwa Wewnętrznego) and Intelligence Agency (Agencja Wywiadu). The move was widely perceived as a way of cleansing the higher ranks of the officers appointed by previous right-wing governments.\n\nThe military intelligence continued to function under a slightly altered name (Wojskowe Służby Informacyjne- \"Military Information Services\") and without much organizational change; at least none that was visible to the general public. The new Polish conservative government declared dissolution of the WSI and creating new services in October 2005, since the agency skipped serious external reforms after the collapse of communism in 1989. Throughout the transformation the WSI were allegedly involved in dubious operations, arms sales to UN-sanctioned states and corruption scandals. In 2006 the WSI was split into Służba Kontrwywiadu Wojskowego and Służba Wywiadu Wojskowego.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The population of the civil parish was 1,990 at the 2011 Census. Cheveley falls within the local government district of East Cambridgeshire. Geographically, Cheveley stands on the third highest point in Cambridgeshire at above sea level. The attractive hamlet of Cheveley Park is a mile from Cheveley.\n\nIt is the home of Cheveley Park Stud.\n\nThe trees of the Duke of Rutland's old park, no longer a ducal domain, spread over into the roadway and gardens of this village near the Suffolk border. A linear village, Cheveley's non-residential land use consists almost entirely of paddock land used by studs, the most notable being the Cheveley Park Stud, after which the Cheveley Park Stakes are named.\n\nBy the road outside the church, in memory of the men who did not come back, stands a soldier with bowed head in a niche below a cross. The Jacobean Rectory has great (possibly 18th-century) iron gates, said to have come from the Alington family's seat at Horseheath.\n\nThe fine aisleless church, in the shape of a cross, has a 600-year-old tower beginning square and ending with eight sides, a turret rising from the ground, with a winding stairway to the belfry and a summit once used for beacon fires. The fine arches with clustered pillars on which the tower rests are the glory of the church indoors, recalling the days when there were four guilds here, each guild keeping a light burning on these piers. Three of the four brackets for the lights are still here, one carved with a face and one a grotesque little fellow with his legs doubled behind him.\n\nThe church belongs to England's three great building centuries, and still has the oak screen set in its chancel arch 600 years ago. The choir-stalls are 'modern' with fine carvings of dogs, fishes, birds, bats, dragons, and a wolf. There are two Jacobean chairs, and a richly inlaid one of cypress wood, the seat opening to form a chest; it is thought to be the throne of a Venetian Doge of the 14th century. A little glass in a transept window is older still. The painted font is 19th-century, most unusual in its blaze of colour, a new dress in mediaeval style.\n\nUnder an arch on the chancel wall is one of the Folkes family, in a red cloak, reading a book. He died in 1642. There is a memorial to James Hand, who was Rector for 49 years until 1830.\n\nThere are some pictures and a description of the church at the Cambridgeshire Churches website.\n\nChildren initially attend the primary school in the village, with many then going on to the nearby secondary school Bottisham Village College.\n\nPresently, Cheveley has many local amenities. The recreation ground provides an off-road field, where cricket, football and mere dog walking take place. The Red Lion public house is situated to the south of the village. The local village store, Cheveley Post Office is situated opposite the Red Lion pub.\n\nThe Icknield Way Path passes through the village on its 110-mile journey from Ivinghoe Beacon in Buckinghamshire to Knettishall Heath in Suffolk. The Icknield Way Trail, a multi-user route for walkers, horse riders and off-road cyclists also passes through the village.\n\n"}
{"id": "2172482", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2172482", "title": "Saeftinghe", "text": "Saeftinghe\n\nSaeftinghe or Saaftinge was a town in the southwest Netherlands, located in eastern Zeelandic Flanders, near Nieuw-Namen. It existed until 1584. It is now a swamp known as the Drowned Land of Saeftinghe (\"\") and an official nature reserve area. The land is a crosspoint where the river Scheldt meets the salty waters of the North Sea in the estuary Western Scheldt. It is a treacherous place where the tides easily consume large stretches of land in a matter of seconds and must not be explored without an experienced guide.\n\nSaeftinghe was drained in the 13th century under the management of the abbey of Ter Doest. Willem van Saeftinghe was one of the best known occupants of the abbey and gave his name to the stretch of land claimed from the sea. Up to 1570, the land was very fertile polder. Agriculture, peat burning and trade turned Saeftinghe into one of the most prosperous places in the region. There were several additional settlements nearby: Namen, Sint-Laureins, Stampaert, Weele (Sint-Marie), Sint-Laureijns and Casuwele.\n\nThe settlements - mostly small villages with just a few houses and huts - are today buried beneath several layers of clay and sand due to several floods over the years. Large bricks were found at several places in land. Those bricks were probably remainders of the abbey used by the villagers to build their houses when the abbey was destroyed due to several floods. Today some of those bricks can be seen in the nearby Visitors Center.\n\nMost of the land around the town was lost in the All Saint's flood of 1570 (the \"Allerheiligenvloed\"). Four years later the drowned land reached into what is now Belgium. Only Saeftinghe and some surrounding land managed to remain dry.\n\nIn 1584, during the Eighty Years' War, Dutch soldiers found themselves forced to destroy the last intact dike and Saeftinghe sunk into the waters of the Scheldt. Attempts to reclaim the area were made throughout history; the most serious project taking place in 1907, but even then only the was conquered from the sea. Nowadays a hamlet is located within the reclaimed portions of land, called .\nSaaftinge itself has never been retrieved.\nIn 1970, all of the area was incorporated into the municipality of Hulst, when Graauw en Langendam and Clinge ceased to exist.\n\nWithin the historical municipal limits, Saaftinge today has a population of 55. The flag consists of a blue lion rampant on a white field. The lion originates from the personal shield of Willem van Saeftinghe.\n\nA legend of Saeftinghe attributes the All Saint's flood to capturing a mermaid and not setting her free. This caused the region to be cursed by the merman, and led to the flood that destroyed the towns of Sint-Laureins, Namen and Casuwele, killing all inhabitants. The legend holds that a tower bell calls for help from the sunken town. Another Saeftinghe legend holds the believe that visitors of the area and inhabitants of the nearby village of Emmadorp sometimes see 'ghosts' in the fog. According to the legend the ghosts are the spirits of the inhabitants of the three towns killed in the flood.\n\nA visitor centre opened in Emmadorp in 1997, from where excursions to the nature reserve depart. From 1997 to 2007, an average of around 12,000 visitors per year went on excursions.\n\n\n"}

Milan.\n\nThe son of famed Barcelona and Atlético Madrid goalkeeper Miguel Reina, Pepe Reina began his career with the Barcelona youth team and made his La Liga debut in the 2000–01 season. He signed for Villarreal in 2002, winning the UEFA Intertoto Cup twice. Reina moved on to Liverpool and made his debut in the 2005 UEFA Super Cup, which Liverpool won. He instantly became first-choice goalkeeper and went on to win both the FA Cup – where he saved three out of four West Ham United penalties in the final – and the FA Community Shield. In 2007, he reached the Champions League Final with Liverpool, matching the feat achieved by his father in 1974, but Liverpool lost to Milan.\n\nFollowing eight consecutive seasons as Liverpool's first-choice keeper, Reina spent the 2013–14 season on loan at Napoli, where he was reunited with Rafael Benítez, the coach who signed him to play for Liverpool in 2005. During his loan tenure in Naples, Reina was part of the side that won the 2014 Coppa Italia. Reina then completed a permanent move to Bayern Munich in 2014 upon returning to Napoli on a permanent deal in 2015 after having been the second-choice keeper for Bayern behind Manuel Neuer. In 2018, Reina left Napoli for Milan and 1.5 years later he completed a loan move to Aston Villa.\n\nAt international level, Reina played for Spain's youth team, winning the UEFA European Under-17 Football Championship in 1999. He made his senior debut in 2005, and has generally been selected as the second-choice keeper behind Iker Casillas. He was part of the Spain squad for the 2006 FIFA World Cup and made one appearance in their victorious UEFA Euro 2008 campaign, earning him his first international honour. He was later part of the Spain squads that won their first ever World Cup in 2010 and their third UEFA European Championship in 2012, as well as featuring at the 2014 and 2018 World Cups.\n\nReina has made the 4th highest number of appearances by a Spanish player in the Premier League, with more than 200 appearances in just his first five seasons, 108 of the 219 appearances being clean sheets. In the 2010–11 season, he kept his 100th Premier League clean sheet for Liverpool in a 3–0 win against Aston Villa.\n\nThe son of former Barcelona goalkeeper Miguel Reina, Pepe Reina began his football career in the youth academy of Barcelona, La Masia, in 1995. From 1999, he played as a first-choice goalkeeper for the Barcelona reserve side, which then competed in the third tier in the Spanish football pyramid. In 2000, At age 18, he was called up for the Barcelona first-team after the first and second choice goalkeepers, Richard Dutruel and Francesc Arnau, suffered injuries. He made his debut as a substitute for Durtruel in a 3–3 draw with Celta de Vigo on 2 December 2000. He made 19 appearances in the remainder of the 2000–01 La Liga season and appeared seven times in the 2000–01 UEFA Cup, where \"Barça\" lost to Reina's future team Liverpool at the semi-final stage.\n\nReina made 16 appearances for the club during the 2001–02 season, serving as understudy to Roberto Bonano. On 31 October 2001, he made his UEFA Champions League debut in Barcelona's 1–0 group stage win against Fenerbahçe at Camp Nou.\n\nAfter signing the German goalkeeper Robert Enke, Barcelona told Reina he was free to leave the club.\n\nIn July 2002, Reina joined Villarreal and went on to spend three seasons with the Valencian club. In 2004, Villarreal reached the semi-final of the UEFA Cup and, in Reina's final season at the club, he helped \"El Submarino Amarillo\" qualify for the UEFA Champions League for the first time in its history.\n\nReina was signed by Liverpool from Villarreal in July 2005, with manager Rafael Benítez hailing him as \"the best goalkeeper in Spain\". Reina made his Liverpool debut against Total Network Solutions, now known as The New Saints, in the first qualifying round for the 2005–06 UEFA Champions League.\n\nFor the 2005–06 season, Reina took over as Liverpool's first-choice goalkeeper, relegating 2005 UEFA Champions League Final hero Jerzy Dudek to the bench. At the start of the season on 17 August 2005, Reina made his international debut for Spain in a friendly against Uruguay. Spain won 2–0.\n\nThe season turned out to be successful for Liverpool as they improved upon the previous year's league placing and won the FA Cup. It was also a huge success personally for Reina as he made Liverpool records. On 3 December 2005, Reina kept his sixth consecutive clean sheet against Wigan Athletic in the Premier League, to break the Liverpool club record for successive clean sheets in the Premier League. He surpassed David James' record of five games, from the 1996–97 season. Reina's run ended at eight league games, when James Beattie scored for Everton in Liverpool's 3–1 Merseyside derby win on 28 December 2005. Reina also broke Liverpool's clean sheet record in all competitions, with 11 between October and December 2005. Mineiro, of São Paulo, finally scored past him on 18 December 2005, during the 2005 FIFA Club World Cup final.\n\nOn 5 February 2006, in a Premier League match against Chelsea, Reina, having made a challenge on Eiður Guðjohnsen moments earlier, was sent off for violent conduct against Arjen Robben. Robben, who fell to the ground, was described as \"going down like he'd been sledgehammered\" by pundit Alan Hansen. Liverpool lost the match 2–0 and Reina was given a three-match suspension. On 16 April 2006, Reina celebrated his 50th appearance for Liverpool by keeping a clean sheet against Blackburn Rovers. As a result, he holds a Liverpool record for the fewest goals conceded by a goalkeeper in his first 50 matches. The previous record was set by Ray Clemence in 1970–71, when he conceded 32 goals. Reina conceded just 29. In May 2006, Reina was awarded the Premier League's Golden Glove award for keeping 20 clean sheets in the 2005–06 season.\n\nIn the final domestic match of the season – the 2006 FA Cup Final on 13 May 2006 – Reina made a number of errors to allow West Ham United to lead 3–2. Steven Gerrard took the match to extra time with a late equaliser. The match ended 3–3 and went to penalties, where Reina saved three out of four penalties to gain the cup win.\n\nDuring the 2006–07 season, Reina's status as Liverpool's number-one goalkeeper was further cemented after Jerzy Dudek conceded nine goals within a week in two cup ties against Arsenal. After the 2007 Champions League semi-final first-leg against Chelsea, Reina was awarded man of the match by Liverpool supporters after a string of superb saves, including two saves from midfielder Frank Lampard. He repeated his good form in the second leg, keeping a clean sheet. The match went to a penalty shootout, where Reina reinforced his penalty-saving reputation, stopping two of the three Chelsea kicks as Liverpool won 4–1. On his return home from the match, he discovered his house in Woolton had been burgled. \n\nThree weeks later in Athens, Reina became only the third player to follow in his father's footsteps by appearing in a European Cup final. Liverpool lost 2–1 in the final to Milan. Reina signed a new five-year contract Liverpool on 7 June 2007.\n\nIn August 2007, Reina again won the Premier League's Golden Glove Award for the second successive season, after keeping 19 clean sheets in the 2006–07 Premier League campaign.\n\nReina began the season by saving a penalty from Portsmouth's Nwankwo Kanu to help his team to a 0–0 draw. On 2 February 2008, Reina became the quickest goalkeeper in Liverpool history to reach 50 clean sheets. He hit the milestone during a 3–0 win against Sunderland, on his 92nd league outing, beating the previous record by three.\n\nReina played all 38 Premier League matches for Liverpool and won his third consecutive Golden Glove award with 18 clean sheets.\n\nReina played every minute of Liverpool's 2008–09 Premier League season, keeping 20 clean sheets, as the team finished as league runners-up with 86 points. On 22 March 2009, Reina kept his 100th clean sheet for Liverpool in a Premier League match against Aston Villa. During the match, he assisted a goal for Albert Riera with a long pass in Liverpool's 5–0 win.\n\nReina again played all 38 matches during the 2009–10 Premier League season, keeping 17 clean sheets. He tied with Chelsea's Petr Čech for the Golden Glove award for the season, but Čech was awarded the trophy with a superior goals-to-game ratio. Reina was named Liverpool's Player of the Season for 2009–10 with 75% of the vote.\n\nOn 17 October 2009, Liverpool were beaten 1–0 by Sunderland with a goal from Darren Bent, which was deflected past Reina via a beach ball thrown from the crowd.\n\nIn April 2010, Reina signed a new six-year contract with Liverpool.\n\nReina got his 2010–11 season off to a poor start, with a late own goal to give Arsenal a 1–1 draw in Liverpool's opening Premier League fixture. Manager Roy Hodgson, club captain Steven Gerrard and vice-captain Jamie Carragher were all quick to get behind Reina and back him to not let the mistake affect his season.\n\nReina captained the team in Europa League matches against Napoli and Steaua București due to the absences of Steven Gerrard and Jamie Carragher. On 6 December 2010, Reina captained Liverpool in the Premier League in a 3–0 victory against Aston Villa. This clean sheet gave him his 100th in 198 league matches, the fastest Liverpool goalkeeper to reach the milestone.\n\nOn 9 May 2011, Reina played his 150th consecutive league match for Liverpool. He was one of only two players to have played in all of Liverpool's league games for 2010–11 season. In June 2011, Reina underwent double hernia surgery.\n\nReina announced on 3 September 2011 that he wanted to stay at Liverpool for another five or six years.\n\nOn 29 November 2011, Reina broke the club record for most clean sheets in a 2–0 Football League Cup quarter-final win over Chelsea. The record had previously been held by Ray Clemence and Bruce Grobelaar.\n\nOn 26 February 2012, Reina won his second major honour with Liverpool, beating Cardiff City on penalties in the 2012 League Cup final.\n\nOn 1 April 2012, Reina received a red card in a 2–0 defeat against Newcastle United due to violent conduct on Newcastle player James Perch.\nReina's suspension ended his streak of 183 consecutive Premier League appearances which had begun in August 2007. He missed Premier League matches against Aston Villa and Blackburn Rovers, as well as the FA Cup semi-final against Everton on 14 April.\n\nOn 5 May, Reina started for Liverpool in their 2–1 2012 FA Cup Final defeat to Chelsea.\n\nOn 30 August 2012, Reina made a mistake in a 1–1 draw against Hearts in the Europa League to give the Edinburgh club the lead at Anfield. He made another error against Manchester City at the City of Manchester Stadium, allowing Sergio Agüero to score a late equaliser in a 2–2 draw on 3 February 2013.\n\nTowards the end of the 2012–13 season, rumours suggested that Víctor Valdés was to leave Barcelona for Monaco and Reina was to be his replacement. According to his father, an agreement had been reached for Reina to sign, but when Valdés chose to stay at Barcelona for another season, no move took place. In anticipation of Reina's departure, Liverpool had signed Belgian international goalkeeper Simon Mignolet from Sunderland. As a result, on 29 July 2013 Reina completed a loan move to Serie A side Napoli, reuniting him with former Liverpool manager Rafael Benítez.\n\nReina was loaned out to Napoli for the 2013–14 season. Liverpool failed to inform Reina about the loan prior to the move. He had made 394 appearances for Liverpool prior to the loan.\n\nIn August 2013, Reina saved a penalty from Lukas Podolski against Arsenal in the pre-season Emirates Cup tournament, and in September, in a 2–1 win over Milan in September, he saved a Mario Balotelli penalty, the first goalkeeper ever to do so in a competitive match.\n\nOn 28 September, Reina declared that his Liverpool career was over: \"At the moment it's difficult to think about being a Liverpool player next year. They have a young goalkeeper in Simon Mignolet and the manager prefers him to me. That's the reason why I'm here and he will be at the club next year as well. There's no reason to think I'll be a Liverpool player from now on but we'll see where the future takes us. It's been a good move so far and I don't regret what happened. I would have preferred to say goodbye in a different way.\"\nOn 3 May 2014, Reina won the Coppa Italia with Napoli after a 3–1 win against Fiorentina.\n\nOn 8 August 2014, Liverpool confirmed Reina had joined the Bundesliga club Bayern Munich on a three-year deal, bringing an eight-year spell with the club to an end. He wore the number 23 shirt for Bayern, the same number he wears for the Spain national team. On 14 March 2015, Reina made his debut for Bayern, starring in a 4–0 away win against Werder Bremen. His appearance in that match meant that he became the first goalkeeper and Spaniard in history to play in four of Europe's top leagues: Spain, England, Italy and Germany.\n\nOn 9 May, as Bayern had already won the 2014–15 Bundesliga and had a Champions League semi-final second leg against Barcelona to come, regular goalkeeper Manuel Neuer was rested for their home match against FC Augsburg and Reina started. He was given a straight red card after 14 minutes when he conceded a penalty with a foul on Raúl Bobadilla; Neuer came on in place of Philipp Lahm but Paul Verhaegh hit the post for Augsburg, which eventually won 1–0.\n\nOn 23 June 2015, it was announced that Reina would return to Napoli on a three-year deal, after a one-year spell at Bayern Munich.\n\nOn 15 May 2018, it was announced that Reina would move to Serie A rivals A.C. Milan on a Bosman transfer. The deal was officialized on 2 July 2018 and he signed a three-year contract with the \"Rossoneri\". He made his debut for the club in the Europa League on 20 September, in a 1–0 away win over F91 Dudelange. Although he served as back-up to Gianluigi Donnarumma in Serie A during his first season with the club, he was the club's starting goalkeeper in the Europa League during his first season with the team, making six appearances, as Milan suffered a first–round elimination. He made his league debut with the team on 2 April 2019, coming on as a substitute for Donnarumma in a 1–1 home draw against Udinese, following the latter's injury in the opening ten minutes of play. \n\nIn the first half of his second season with the club, he continued to serve as a back-up to Donnarumma, and only made once appearance for the team, which came in a 2–1 away win over Genoa in Serie A on 5 October 2019; during the match, Reina was at fault for the opening goal, as he had misjudged Lasse Schone's free kick, but he later saved a penalty against the same opponent, which he himself had conceded, in stoppage time.\n\nOn 13 January 2020, Reina joined Premier League side Aston Villa on loan for the rest of the 2019–20 season; after the team's usual first choice goalkeeper Tom Heaton was ruled out through injury until the summer.\n\nReina has been a regular in the Spain national team since 2005, mostly as second-choice keeper after Iker Casillas. He was part of the team that won the 2010 FIFA World Cup and the 2008 and 2012 European Championships.\n\nReina made his debut on 17 August 2005, keeping a clean sheet in a 2–0 friendly win over Uruguay at El Molinón in Gijón. He was a member of the Spanish squad which reached the last 16 of the 2006 World Cup, but did not play. At UEFA Euro 2008, he played the final group match in Salzburg as Spain had already advanced, conceding a header by reigning champion Greece's Angelos Charisteas, although Spain came back to win 2–1.\n\nIn October 2008, he and Casillas together broke the national record for the longest time spent without conceding a goal after defeating Estonia 3–0. The pair went unbeaten for 710 minutes since Reina conceded from Charisteas, longer than the legendary Andoni Zubizarreta and Francisco Buyo. Wesley Sonck of Belgium ended their streak when he scored against Casillas in a World Cup qualifier later that month. The following year, he was part of the Spanish squad which reached the semi-finals at the 2009 FIFA Confederations Cup in South Africa. His sole appearance was in the last group game in Bloemfontein, keeping a clean sheet in a 2–0 win over hosts South Africa, a result which was a world record 15th consecutive international victory for Spain.\n\nReina was also in Spain's squad for the 2013 Confederations Cup, in which they reached the final. His sole appearance in the tournament came in the second group game against Oceanian champions Tahiti, a 10–0 win at the Maracanã. With Spain's elimination already confirmed, he was selected to start in Spain's final group match of the 2014 World Cup keeping a clean sheet against Australia in a 3–0 win.\n\nIn May 2018, he was named in Spain's final squad for the 2018 FIFA World Cup.\n\nReina is well known for his distribution, ball skills, technique, positioning, shot-stopping, leadership, and ability to save penalties; he has also functioned as a \"sweeper-keeper\" on occasion throughout his career, due to his anticipation and speed when rushing off his line, as well as his ability to start plays or create chances from the back. Fellow goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon named Reina as the best goalkeeper of his era with his feet. He has set a number of goalkeeping records for Liverpool and won the Premier League Golden Glove award for most clean sheets in a single season in his first three seasons at the club.\n\nReina married his longtime girlfriend Yolanda Ruiz in Córdoba on 19 May 2006, before joining up with the Spain national squad for the 2006 World Cup. The couple have five children. Reina was the former next door neighbour of Atlético Madrid striker and Spanish international teammate Fernando Torres. When he was at Liverpool, Reina was neighbours with teammate Luis Suárez. \n\nReina's father Miguel Reina was in goal for Atlético Madrid in the 1974 European Cup Final, which Atlético lost to Bayern Munich 4–0 in a replay after the first match finished 1–1.\n\nAlthough a steely and serious figure as goalkeeper, Reina is known for his exuberant, jester-like character off the pitch, often entertaining his teammates with jokes and songs, and famously acting as a crowd-pleasing master of ceremonies at Spain's official victory celebrations following the 2008 European Championship, the 2010 World Cup and Euro 2012.\n\nIn March 2020, he tested positive for COVID-19; later that month, in an interview with Spanish radio station \"COPE\", he announced that he had made a \"full recovery.\"\n\nIn July 2018, Reina and former Napoli footballers Paolo Cannavaro and Salvatore Aronica were subject to a hearing by the Italian Football Federation over links to the Esposito brothers, high-ranking members of the Camorra. Reina was also accused of trying to get free tickets for the Lo Russo Camorra clan.\n\nIn May 2020, Reina drew criticism from Spanish rapper Nega, of \"Los Chikos del Maíz,\" for supporting the anti-lockdown protests by far-right political party Vox amidst the COVID-19 pandemic in Spain.\n\nVillarreal\n\nLiverpool\n\nNapoli\n\nBayern Munich\n\nAston Villa\n\nSpain U16\n\nSpain\n\nIndividual\n\n\nDecorations\n\n"}

He was educated by the Jesuits, but felt drawn to the poverty and penitential life of the Franciscan friars. At the age of twenty, he joined the Order of Friars Minor at Montilla, entering the novitiate at St. Lawrence Friary, which was located in a place of great natural beauty. The community there belonged to the Reformed observance within the Order, following a very strict routine of prayer, silence and fasting. Francis followed this regimen rigorously, always going barefoot, abstaining from meat, and wearing a hairshirt throughout that entire year. As a result, however, his health was permanently affected, leaving him sick and fatigued.\n\nSolano was solemnly professed in 1569. He was then sent to the friary of Our Lady of Loreto in Seville for his seminary studies. There he learned not only philosophy and theology but developed his musical talents. He was ordained in 1576, a ceremony his mother was unable to attend due to her poor health. He was then named Master of Ceremonies for the community. Still a lover of simplicity, Francis made a small cell for himself by the chapel of the friary, made of clay and reeds.\n\nAfter completing his final theological studies, Solano was assigned as an itinerant preacher to the surrounding villages of the region. He was eventually given a license as a confessor. During this period, he requested that he might be allowed to go to North Africa, with the hope of achieving martyrdom for preaching the Catholic faith. He was denied this request. At that point, Solano shifted his vision to the American missions.\n\nAfter the death of his father, Solano returned to his hometown of Montilla to care for his mother. During that time, he gained the reputation of a wonderworker, as a number of people were cured of their afflictions through his intercession. In 1583, A pestilence having broken out at Granada, he tended the sick and dying.\n\nSpanish King Philip II requested the Franciscans to send missionaries to preach the Gospel in the Americas. In 1589 Solanus sailed from Spain to the New World, and having landed at Panama, crossed the isthmus and embarked on a vessel that was to convey him to Peru. During the journey, a storm at sea crashed his ship against the rocks not far from Peru. The crew and the passengers abandoned the ship, but Francis stayed with the slaves that were on board. After three days, they were rescued.\n\nFor twenty years Solano worked at evangelizing the vast regions of Tucuman (present day northwestern Argentina) and Paraguay. He had a skill for languages and succeeded at learning many of the regions' native tongues in a fairly short period. It is claimed he could also address tribes of different tongues in one language yet be understood by them all. Being a musician as well, Solano also played the violin frequently for the natives. He is often depicted playing this instrument.\n\nAfter that came Solano's appointment as guardian of the Franciscan friary in Lima, Peru. Further, he filled the same office for the friaries of his Order in Tucuman and Paraguay.\nAround 1601 he was called to Lima, Peru, where he tried to recall the Spanish colonists to their baptismal integrity. It is said that Solanus predicted the devastating 1619 earthquake of Trujillo, Peru. He died at Lima.\n\nSolanus was beatified by Pope Clement X in 1675, and canonized by Pope Benedict XIII in 1726. His feast is kept throughout the Franciscan Order on 24 July (except currently the United States, where it is celebrated on 14 July).\n\nFrancis Solanus is the patron saint of Montilla. The Parish Church of San Francisco Solano is built on the site of the former house where he was born. He is also patron of Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Paraguay and Peru.\n\nMission San Francisco Solano, the northern-most mission along California's El Camino Real, was named in 1823 for Francisco Solano.\n\nIn Humahuaca, every day at precisely 12 noon, on the city hall belltower, heavy copper doors slowly open and a life-sized animated wooden, dramatic-looking statue of San Francisco Solano appears for about two minutes and gives his benediction to the silent crowd amassed on the village plaza.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2172556", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2172556", "title": "New York and Putnam Railroad", "text": "New York and Putnam Railroad\n\nThe New York and Putnam Railroad (a.k.a. Old Put) was a railroad line that operated between the Bronx and Brewster in New York state. It was in close proximity to Hudson River Railroad and New York and Harlem Railroad. All three came under ownership of the New York Central system in 1894. The railroad was abandoned starting in 1958, and most of the former roadbed has been converted for rail trail use.\n\nThe New York & Boston Railroad (NY&B) was chartered May 21, 1869 to build a line from Highbridge on the Harlem River in New York northeast to Brewster. At Brewster connections were to be provided to the New York & Harlem Railroad for travel north to Albany, and to the Boston, Hartford & Erie Railroad to Boston.\n\nThe New York, Boston & Northern Railway (NYB&N) was formed on November 18, 1872 as a consolidation of the NY&B with two companies to the north — the Putnam & Dutchess Railroad (P&D) and Dutchess & Columbia Railroad (D&C). The P&D was a plan for a line to split from the New York and Boston at Carmel to a point midway along the D&C. The D&C opened in 1871, running from the Hudson River to the Connecticut border. The Clove Branch Railroad was to serve as a short connection between the two parts of the planned line.\n\nThe New York, Boston & Montreal Railway was organized January 21, 1873 as a renaming of the NYB&N. It continued north to Chatham on what is now the defunct section of the Harlem Line and then use the Harlem Extension Railroad into Vermont. The Panic of 1873 caused the cancellation of the leases and mergers on December 1 of that year. Construction on the P&D and D&C stopped; D&C later became part of the Central New England Railway, the Harlem Extension became a part of the Rutland Railroad, and the Clove Branch Railroad was abandoned in 1898.\n\nThe New York, Westchester & Putnam Railway was formed on July 3, 1877 as a reorganization, and was leased to the New York City & Northern Railroad (NYC&N), formed on March 1, 1878. Between East View and Pocantico Hills, the NYC&N built a segment leading to a perilous 80-foot-high trestle over a marsh-filled valley. Because of the dangers of crossing the bridge, which often required that trains slow down to a crawl, the line was rerouted west around that valley in 1881. The bridge was torn down in 1883, and the valley became the Tarrytown Reservoir. The line finally opened under the original plan, ending at Brewster, in April 1881. That year, the New York & New England Railroad opened to the north, using some of the grade built for the P&D and D&C. The West Side & Yonkers Railway was leased to the NYC&N on May 1, 1880, extending the line south across the Harlem River to the northern terminal of the Ninth Avenue Elevated at 155th Street. It was merged into the NYC&N by 1887. In the 1910s, the Interborough Rapid Transit Company of the New York City subway (IRT) purchased the bridge across the Harlem river to move its elevated lines north into the Bronx, cutting the NYP back to Sedgwick Avenue. The Yonkers Rapid Transit Railway was opened in 1888 as a branch from the NYP at Van Cortlandt northwest to Yonkers. It was merged into NYP by 1887.\n\nThe company went into receivership by 1887 and was reorganized as the New York & Northern Railway. By 1894 it was reorganized as the New York & Putnam Railroad (NY&P) by J. P. Morgan who in turned leased the railroad to the New York Central & Hudson River Railroad (NYC&HR). The line eventually became the Putnam Division of the New York Central Railroad (NYC) by 1913. The line lacked a direct connection to NYC's flagship station, Grand Central Terminal (GCT), which hurt ridership throughout its existence. Passengers were forced to transfer at Highbridge to reach GCT. The Sedgwick Avenue-Van Cortlandt section and the Yonkers Branch were electrified in 1926.\n\nSeveral short branches were eliminated after the 1920s. The Mohansic Branch near Yorktown Heights, originally built to serve a mental institution that was cancelled by Albany, went first. In 1929, John D. Rockefeller, Jr. had the tracks removed from his Pocantico Hills property, eliminating four stations while creating one. The nearby village of East View was obliterated to build the new line. The Getty Square Branch was abandoned on June 30, 1943. Despite a legal battle by Yonkers residents which reached the United States Supreme Court to save it, the line was scrapped in December 1944.\n\nThe first diesel locomotive passenger train in the U.S. ran on the Putnam on March 18, 1929.\n\nBesides the regular Sedgwick Avenue–Brewster service, service also operated from Golden's Bridge on the Harlem Division via a connecting branch to Lake Mahopac, and then over the Putnam Division to Brewster, where it returned to the Harlem Division. Trains taking this route were said to go \"around the horn\".\n\nNYC saw the Putnam Division as a dispensable stepchild. The line lacked a second track, electrification, commuter parking and direct service to GCT, all of which the parallel Harlem and Hudson Divisions had, resulting in declining patronage. In 1956, the New York Central asked for permission to discontinue service on the line. On May 14, 1957, the Public Service Commission allowed for a 15 percent increase in fares, but required that service be run on the Putnam Division on a limited basis. On March 12, 1958, the Public Service Commission of New York authorized the NYC to end passenger service on the Putnam on June 1, 1958. At the time, the line had less than 500 daily riders, and discontinuing the line was expected to save $400,000. The last trains ran on May 29, 1958 as there was no weekend service on the line. Service \"around the horn\" via the Harlem Division's Lake Mahopac Branch continued until April 2, 1959. Until 1962, when NYC's West Shore Railroad was upgraded, the Putnam served oversize freight trains, due to the lack of tunnels on the line. Tracks between East View and Lake Mahopac were removed in 1962.\n\nNYC merged with long-time rival Pennsylvania Railroad to form Penn Central (PC) in 1968. Freight service on the northern part of the Putnam ended by 1970. The southern end of the line remained in service until the closing of the A&P warehouse in Elmsford in 1975. The decrease in traffic from Stauffer Chemical cut back the line to Chauncey by 1977. Conrail took over the bankrupt PC in April 1976, but had no plans for increasing business. The last customer was the Stella D'Oro bakery in the Bronx, which stopped using the railroad in 1989, after which Conrail wanted to sell the right-of-way to the city and Westchester to reduce its tax bill.\n\nThe Regional Plan Association proposed extending this line and connecting it with the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line () of the New York City Subway.\n\nThe Metro-North Railroad uses the remaining stub near Marble Hill station to store maintenance-of-way and contractors' trains and for material delivery in the vicinity of 225th Street. The roadbed north of the former Van Cortlandt station has been converted into the South County Trailway, North County Trailway, and Putnam County Trailway rail trails.\n\nA replica of the former Bryn Mawr Park station at the former Palmer Road grade crossing is in use as a grocery. The station in Briarcliff Manor was purchased by the village in 1959 and converted into the Briarcliff Manor Public Library. The station in Elmsford serves as a restaurant. The Yorktown Heights station had its exterior restored and is the centerpiece of the town park. The station in Lake Mahopac has been an American Legion Hall since 1965. The freight house in Baldwin Place and the station in Tilly Foster are on private property.\n\nThe Getty Square Branch still shows evidence of its existence, with vestiges of the railroad and stations, and neighborhoods exhibiting characteristics of transit-oriented development. Getty Square station, originally a head house and train shed, was replaced by an office building, which still stands and is ornamented on its exterior and in its lobby with images of locomotives. The -long right-of-way is part of the trail system in Van Cortlandt Park, including the bridge that carried the branch over the Henry Hudson Parkway. Old railroad ties can be found along the right-of-way. The right-of-way within New York City ends at a parking garage for an apartment building in Yonkers. To the north of the apartment building, another parking lot was built. The bridge over the adjacent street was walled in where the ROW used to pass underneath.\n\nAbutments of the former branch can be found at School Street across from Herriott Street, McLean Avenue near South Broadway, and the former Lowerre Station on Lawrence Street at Western Avenue. The former Caryl Station on Caryl Avenue between Saratoga and Van Cortlandt Park Avenues, with the tunnel into Van Cortlandt Park walled off by cinder blocks is now the Caryl parking lot and playground. A lot of the intrusions on the branch were from the expansion of outside storage from adjacent industries, which broke up the right-of-way in many places, especially in Yonkers.\n\nPrivate homes that once served the branch include the termini houses of the Park Hill station's adjacent funicular on Undercliff at Park Hill Terrace, and on Alta Avenue north of Overcliff, and the home of the railroad's president also on Alta Avenue. North from the Yonkers-New York City boundary, the path of the route generally follows the path of the Saw Mill River Parkway until it reaches East Irvington.\n\nNOTE: Stations along pre-1918 Manhattan terminus and pre-1931 Tarrytown Heights alignment are shaded in darker gray.\n\n\n\n"}

He was the brother of Max Adler. \n\nA close friend of Arnold Schoenberg from their schooldays, Adler taught him the rudiments of music, gave him his first grounding in philosophy, and played chamber music with him. Though self-taught, Adler for many years led a string quartet whose regular cellist was another composer-friend, Franz Schmidt. Adler also played in Schoenberg's Society for Private Musical Performances, lectured on music and philosophy, as well as giving musical and spiritual advice to, and casting horoscopes for, many of Vienna's leading creative artists.\n\nIn 1935 the violinist Louis Krasner consulted Adler (as well as Carl Flesch) about the solo part of Alban Berg's Violin Concerto, which Krasner had commissioned but could not, at that time, play. Around this time, Adler was also the teacher of the young Hans Keller, later a musician, writer and Schoenberg-expert resident in the UK.\n\nAfter the Anschluss, Schoenberg tried to arrange for Adler to come to California, but he escaped instead to the United Kingdom, spending the 1940s in the Lake District and his last years in London. Adler and Schoenberg resumed their friendship by letter in the late 1940s; some of the correspondence is published.\n\nAdler's principal books were \"Critique of Pure Music\" (1918, still unpublished), and \"The Testament of Astrology\" (published in 3 volumes 1935–37, many subsequent editions).\n\n\"The Testament of Astrology\" was translated into English by his devoted pupil Zdenka Orenstein and edited by Amy Shapiro.\n\nA biography, by Amy Shapiro, includes letters, stories and memoirs gathered across twenty years of discovery, of people who recounted the vital role that Dr. Oskar Adler played in Vienna's pre-Nazi cultural life before 1938 and while in exile.\n"}

During the French Revolution, after the abolition of the French monarchy (September 20, 1792), the National Convention instituted a new calendar and declared that date to be the beginning of Year I. The Khmer Rouge's takeover of Phnom Penh was rapidly followed by a series of drastic revolutionary de-industrialization policies which resulted in a death toll which vastly exceeded the death toll which resulted from the French Reign of Terror.\n\nThe idea behind Year Zero is that all culture and traditions within a society must be completely destroyed or discarded and a new revolutionary culture must replace it, starting from scratch. All of the history of a nation or people before Year Zero is largely deemed irrelevant, because it will ideally be purged and replaced from the ground up.\n\nIn Democratic Kampuchea, so-called New People—intellectuals and members of the old governments—were especially singled out and executed during the purges accompanying Year Zero.\n\n"}

{"id": "2172575", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2172575", "title": "Maico", "text": "Maico\n\n\"For the manga series, see Maico 2010.\"\n\nMaicowerk A.G. was a West German motorcycle manufacturer. Founded in 1926 by Ulrich Maisch as Maisch & Co, the company originally manufactured 98 and 123 cc Ilo two-stroke engines. After World War II, they began producing their own unit construction two-stroke engines, selling complete motorcycles. Maico () made a brief foray into the automobile business with their own line of microcars in the late 1950s. Maico have also made Go kart engines.\n\nThe road motorcycles were named after winds... 'Blizzard' 'Typhoon' etc., but the company was better known for its purpose-built Motocross and Enduro machines, and for its 'Maicoletta' motor scooter, both of which sold in higher numbers than the road motorcycles.\n\nMaico motocross (MC) and enduro (GS) racing models proved very successful in both European and American competition throughout the 1970s. While lacking the financial capital and big money race-team backing like that of the Japanese factories of Honda, Yamaha, Suzuki, and Kawasaki, Maico riders such as Adolf Weil, Åke Jonsson and Willy Bauer proved to be a serious challenge to the Japanese factories and produced numerous top three finishes in the Motocross World Championships. The firm also experienced some success in Grand Prix road racing competitions with rider Börje Jansson winning three 125cc Grand Prix races between 1972 and 1973. \n\nAmerican publication \"Motocross Action\" called the 1981 Maico Mega 2 - 490cc the greatest open-class motocross bike of all time. The 1974.5 400cc and 440cc GP and 1981 490cc models along with any year 501cc motocross bike are some of the most sought-after vintage MX and twin-shock motorcycles to this day.\n\nOne of the largest contributions to the world of motocross suspension technology came in the 1974 season when the Wheelsmith Motorcycles team in the USA and the Gunther Schier teams in Europe forward-mounted the rear shocks on the Maico factory-backed motorcycles, immediately increasing the travel and ability to trump the competition. This initiated a frantic effort on the part of factory teams and privateers alike; chopping up their frames in a desperate attempt to remain competitive.\n\nMaicowerk AG filed for bankruptcy in 1983, but continued to produce small numbers of motocross and enduro models (re-badged as M-Stars in the United States due to legal issues) up through 1986. Subsequent manufacturers have purchased the brand name and applied it to their own limited production motorcycles. Modern open-class dirt-bikes are still being produced under the Maico brandname The ATK Intimidator dirt-bike (reportedly the most powerful production 2 stroke motorcycle available aside from Maico's own motorcycles) features a Maico motor.\n\nAfter the company went out of business in 1986, its assets were taken over by a Dutch company, but to this day retains a strong cult following. Many riders restore vintage Maicos for display or to take back to the track.\n\nThe new Maico launched in 2013, a 685 Cross model with 82 Horsepower (60 kW), is one of the most powerful motocross bikes on the market.\n\nThe Maicoletta motor scooter of the 1950s was one of the largest motor scooters produced by any manufacturer until the modern era. The engine was a single cylinder 247cc piston port 2-stroke (an export version featuring a 277cc engine was also produced for use with a sidecar), with four foot-operated gears, enclosed chain drive, centrifugal fan cooling and electric start. This was fitted to a tubular frame built on motorcycle principles with long travel telescopic forks and 14-inch wheels. The Maicoletta had a top speed of greater than 70 mph, comparable with most 250cc motorcycles of the time. In the 1950s most scooters such as Vespa, Lambretta, were 125cc to 200cc with 8-10 inch wheels and a top speed of 55 to 60 mph, so the expensive but fast and comfortable Maicoletta developed a following amongst scooter club enthusiasts.\nBy modern standards the brakes (drum front and rear) leave something to be desired, but compared to those of other scooters from the period, the brakes are not inferior. \n\n\"Pendulum starter\"\nAn unusual Bosch 6v 'pendulum' electric starter system was fitted, which was quite advanced for the 1950s, and about which there are a number of common misconceptions. When activated, instead of rotating the crankshaft the starter used the generator coils on the shaft to rock it back and forth under the control of cams on the crankshaft. These cams closed contacts in the generator \nto trigger a reversing switch in the \"Control box\" that changed the crankshaft direction at the end of each swing. This gives the impression of the crankshaft continually bouncing back and forwards against compression, when operated. A separate set of ignition points fired the spark plug in the forward direction only, and when this fires the mixture in the cylinder the engine starts to rotate normally, the starter is released and the normal ignition system takes over.\nThe advantage of this system is that the starter does not have to force the crankshaft to turn over against compression, so less power is required from the 6volt system. Its disadvantage is the unusual number of contacts, which can be difficult to adjust. The reversing switch contacts tend to wear out with extended use and can be very difficult to get repaired, hence the scooter's reputation for requiring roll starts later in life.\n\nThe Maico Mobil, said to resemble a 'two wheeled car', was a highly enclosed two-wheel motorcycle which sold only in small numbers. It was designed to provide motorcycle handling combined with scooter convenience, a large trunk, and weather protection. It was nicknamed \"the dustbin.\" The Mobil was produced from June 1950 through 1958 with aluminum bodywork and a tubular frame.\n\n"}

The series is unrelated to the earlier \"Bad City Blue\" featuring Button Men in \"2000 AD\" #468-479.\n\nHarry Exton, an ex-soldier, is a \"Button Man\", a hired killer pitted against others in an underground sport. Each works for a mysterious \"Voice\", a rich man of unknown identity. The object of the game is to defeat one's opponents, and take their marker – the first two joints of a finger. Button Men who lose three fingers are executed. While killing an opponent is generally acceptable, it is not always the preferred outcome of a match - on one occasion Exton's Voice loses a wager when Exton kills his opponent rather than taking his marker, thus beginning the souring of the relationship between Exton and his Voice. The Voices profit from the game by gambling on the outcome, and a ruthless killer such as Harry Exton can make a modestly wealthy man extremely rich. The Button Men themselves are paid well for their tasks.\n\nDespite being exceptionally good at the sport and not losing any markers during his involvement, Exton decides to quit, and tracks down his Voice killing him, thinking that will remove him from the sport. This grants him temporary freedom and he settles down anonymously in a small town, even starting an affair with a local waitress. He is himself tracked down by other Button Men (and a Button Woman) whose Voices view Exton as the ultimate sport due to his previous unparalleled success. Exton has advance warning of their presence when he spots them disguised as tourists in the Diner his girlfriend works at, and notices that one is missing two markers.

It is the last chapter in his Eugene trilogy, following \"Brighton Beach Memoirs\" and \"Biloxi Blues\".\n\nThe play is about Eugene and his older brother, Stanley, dealing with their parents' relationship falling apart as the brothers work together toward being comedy writers for the radio, and, eventually, television. They discover that their father, Jack, has been cheating on their mother, Kate. It is obvious to the family before Jack even admits it, and they try to find ways for Kate to cope with the loss when Jack may eventually leave. Jack reveals that the woman he has been seeing is dying. \n\nWhen Eugene and Stanley find a job where they can write short comedic skits for the radio, they obscurely make fun of their own family. Jack can hear the similarities between the fictional family in the broadcast and their own family, and becomes outraged. He gets into a major argument with Stanley, which turns into an argument about Jack's affair. Later, Kate holds a nostalgic conversation with Eugene, revealing how she had tried to win his father's heart when she was younger. \n\nEventually, Jack leaves. Stanley and Eugene move out when they get the great offers for which they'd hoped. Kate remains in the house with her father, Ben (an elderly Jewish man with socialist leanings who provides the play with most of its warmth and humor), until Ben goes to follow his wife to Miami.\n\nEugene Morris Jerome - The play's narrator and the focal character of the Eugene trilogy. Carefree, witty to a fault, and quick to joke, he is 23 years old and working in the stock room of a music company before his brother and writing partner, Stanley, helps them both to break into the world of showbiz. While he maintains his affable and seemingly care-free nature, Eugene cares deeply about everyone in his family, especially for his parents - whom he bases the ridiculous characters of his first big comedy sketch on. Neil Simon wrote Eugene as his own self, the playwright's semi-autobiographical analogue in the work.\n\nStanley Jerome - Eugene's older brother. At 28 years old, he is neurotic, high-strung, and constantly obsessing and worrying over the details. He brokers the first opportunity for he and his brother to show their material to NBC Studios and co-writes the sketch with his brother; the two constantly bicker and play as they attempt to write their first big comedy sketch. Later, it is Stanley who stands up to Jack in their iconic argument in Act II.\n\nBen Epstein - Father of Kate, grandfather to Stanley and Eugene. A born socialist and ardent follower of Trotsky, he lives with his daughter and her family in Brighton Beach. Stan and Eugene find Grandpa, in his age, to be one of their greatest goldmines for accidental comedy, with Eugene going so far as to say to the audience that \"he was the greatest teacher of comedy I ever had...and he didn't even know I was studying him.\" He cares deeply for his daughters and their families, but due to his upbringing and beliefs is not an affectionate man.\n\nKate Jerome - A strong woman through and through, Eugene and Stanley's mother has done her best to take care of her father, Ben, while raising her boys and keeping a wary eye on her husband. She values family, and familial experiences - such as the simple act of sitting down and eating together as a family. She knows her boys are grown men, but will never not see them as her babies - when Eugene becomes ill during Act II, she admonishes him as a child for not being in bed when the radio show begins, among other examples. Before the start of the play, she is already aware of her husband's indiscretions, and is the one to confront him over them - however, she stands her ground and does not falter when Jack admits his guilt.\n\nJack Jerome - The father to Eugene and Stanley, he's a tough nut for certain. Having worked as a clothier for many years, making ladies raincoats, he's become a bit numb to the monotony of life. This in turn, before the play's start, lead him to having a brief affair, on again and off again. Like Ben, he is not an affectionate man, masked by his exhaustion and his own self-provided frustrations. He becomes outraged when the radio program his sons wrote turns out to sound eerily similar to their own family situation, and quickly admonishes them before being put back into place by Stanley for his own affairs. He leaves Kate at the end of the play.\n\nBlanche Morton - Kate's (now) well-to-do sister, who featured more heavily in 'Brighton Beach Memoirs'. She has remarried, and her second husband built himself up to afford a home on Park Avenue and the finer things in life. Ben is at odds with Blanche when she comes to visit in Act I - she wants him to move to Florida with his semi-estranged wife, who he avoids speaking with.

She ultimately serves as the beginning framework, in her conversations with Ben, where we learn of the real situation between Jack and Kate.\n\nThe play premiered at Duke University's Reynolds Theater on October 6, 1986. Simon has indicated that the smaller premiere venue took pressure off trying to please the critics. \n\nThe play opened on Broadway at the Broadhurst Theatre on December 4, 1986 and closed on September 25, 1988 after 756 performances. Produced by Emanuel Azenberg and directed by Gene Saks, the cast starred Linda Lavin as Kate, Jonathan Silverman as Eugene, Jason Alexander as Stanley, Phyllis Newman as Blanche and John Randolph as Jack. Joan Rivers took over the role of Kate for the play's final months on Broadway. \n\nThe play received four Tony Award nominations, including Best Play, Linda Lavin (Lead Actress, Play), Phyllis Newman (Featured Actress, Play), and John Randolph (Featured Actor, Play). Linda Lavin won as Best Actress in a Play and John Randolph won as Best Featured Actor in a Play. It received four nominations for the Drama Desk Award, with Lavin and Randolph winning. \n\nIt also was a 1987 finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for Drama.\n\nA Broadway revival, directed by David Cromer, was scheduled to open in November 2009 (previews) at the Nederlander Theatre, running in repertory with \"Brighton Beach Memoirs\". The announced cast included Laurie Metcalf as Kate Jerome, Dennis Boutsikaris as Jack Jerome, Santino Fontana as Stanley Jerome, Jessica Hecht as Blanche, Josh Grisetti as Eugene Jerome and Allan Miller as Ben. However, \"Brighton Beach Memoirs\" closed on November 1, 2009 due to weak ticket sales and the planned production of \"Broadway Bound\" was canceled.\n\n\"Broadway Bound\" was adapted into a television movie in 1992. The film was directed by Paul Bogart with the screenplay written by Neil Simon. The cast starred Anne Bancroft (Kate), Hume Cronyn (Ben), Jerry Orbach (Jack), Jonathan Silverman (Stan) and Corey Parker (Eugene). Cronyn won a 1992 Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie for his role in the film.\n\nFrank Rich, in his review for \"The New York Times\" wrote: \" \"Broadway Bound\" contains some of its author's most accomplished writing to date – passages that dramatize the timeless, unresolvable bloodlettings of familial existence as well as the humorous conflicts one expects. But the seamless merging of laughter, character and emotion that ignited \"Biloxi Blues\" is only intermittently achieved here. There are stretches, especially in Act I, when \"Broadway Bound\" isn't funny or moving but just reportorial and expository, with plot twists and thematic invocations piling up undigested, like the heavier courses at an attenuated Passover seder.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "2172629", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2172629", "title": "Mehregan", "text": "Mehregan\n\nMehregān ( or Jašn-e Mehr \"Mithra Festival\") is a Zoroastrian and Persian festival celebrated to honor the yazata Mithra (), which is responsible for friendship, affection and love. It is also widely referred to as the Persian Festival of Autumn.\n\nAccording to \"The Wiley-Blackwell Companion to Zoroastrianism\" (2015), it was originally a feast honoring the Zoroastrian \"yazata\" Mithra. By the 4th century BCE, it was observed as one of the name-day feasts, a form it retains in today. Still, in a predominantly Muslim Iran, it is one of the two pre-Islamic festivals that continue to be celebrated by the public at large: Mehrgān, dedicated to Mithra (modern \"Mehr\"), and Tirgan, dedicated to Tishtrya (modern \"Tir\").\n\nName-day feasts are festivals celebrated on the day of the year when the day-name and month-name dedicated to a particular divinity intersect. The Mehr day in the Mehr month corresponded to the day farmers harvested their crops. They thus also celebrated the fact Ahura Mazda had given them food to survive the coming cold months.\n\nIrrespective of which calendar is observed, Mehrgān falls on the 196th day of the calendar year. For details on how this date is calculated, see basis for the date, below. For calendars that have March 21 as Nowruz or New Year's Day (i.e. in the \"Fasili\" and \"Bastani\" variants of the Zoroastrian calendar as well as in the Iranian civil calendar), Mehrgān falls on October 2. For the \"Shahanshahi\" variant of the Zoroastrian calendar, which in 2006–2007 has New Year's Day on August 20, Mehrgān fell on March 3 of the following Gregorian year. For the \"Kadmi\" variant, which has New Year's Day 30 days earlier, Mehrgān falls on February 1.\n\nIn al-Biruni's eleventh-century \"Book of Instructions in the Elements of the Art of Astrology\" (233), the astronomer observed that \"some people have given the preference to Mihragān [over Nowruz, i.e. New Year's day/Spring Equinox] by as much as they prefer autumn to spring.\"\n\nAs Biruni also does for the other festival days he mentions, he reiterates a local anecdotal association for his description of Mehrgan (\"ha al-mirjan\" in the author's Arabic parlance) with a fragment of a tale from Iranian folklore: On this day, Fereydun vanquished the evil Zahhak and confined him to Mount Damavand. This fragment of the legend is part of a greater cycle that ties Mehrgan with Nowruz; Dahak vanquished Jamshid (who the legends have as the one establishing Nowruz or New Year's Day), and Fereydun vanquishes Dahak, so restoring the balance. The association of Mehrgan with the polarity of spring/autumn, sowing/harvest and the birth/rebirth cycle did not escape Biruni either, for as he noted, \"they consider Mihragān as a sign of resurrection and the end of the world, because at Mihragān that which grows reaches perfection.\"\n\nMehrgān was celebrated in an extravagant style at Persepolis. Not only was it the time for harvest, but it was also the time when the taxes were collected. Visitors from different parts of the Persian Empire brought gifts for the king all contributing to a lively festival.\n\nDuring pre-Islamic and early Islamic Iran, Mehrgān was celebrated with the same magnificence and pageantry as Nowruz. It was customary for people to send or give their king, and each other, gifts. Rich people usually gave gold and silver coins, heroes and warriors gave horses while others gave gifts according to their financial power and ability, even as simple as an apple. Those fortunate enough would help the poor with gifts.\n\nGifts to the royal court of over ten thousand gold coins were registered. If the gift-giver needed money at a later time, the court would then return twice the gift amount. Kings gave two audiences a year: one audience at Nowruz and other at Mehregān. During the Mehregān celebrations, the king wore a fur robe and gave away all his summer clothes.\n\nAfter the Mongol invasion of Iran, the feast celebration of Mehrgān lost its popularity. Zoroastrians of Yazd and Kermān continued to celebrate Mehrgān in an extravagant way.\n\nFor this celebration, the participants wear new clothes and set a decorative, colorful table. The sides of the tablecloth are decorated with dry marjoram. A copy of the Khordeh Avesta (\"little Avesta\"), a mirror and a \"sormeh-dan\" (a traditional eyeliner or kohl) are placed on the table together with rosewater, sweets, flowers, vegetables and fruits, especially pomegranates and apples, and nuts such as almonds or pistachios. A few silver coins and lotus seeds are placed in a dish of water scented with marjoram extract.\n\nA burner is also part of the table setting for \"kondor\"/\"loban\" (frankincense) and \"espand\" (seeds of \"Peganum harmala\", Syrian rue) to be thrown on the flames.\n\nAt lunch time when the ceremony begins, everyone in the family stands in front of the mirror to pray. Sharbat is drunk and then—as a good omen—\"sormeh\" is applied around the eyes. Handfuls of wild marjoram, lotus and sugar plum seeds are thrown over one another's heads while they embrace one another.\n\nIn 1960s the Postal Service in Tehran issued a series of stamps to commemorate Mehrgan Festival.\n\nAs noted above, Mehrgān is a name-day feast. These name-day feasts are festivals celebrated on the day of the year when the day-name and month-name dedicated to a particular angel or virtue intersect. Indeed, Zoroastrian Persians before Islam had 30-days months, which means that each day in a month had a different name, with 12 of the days also being names of the 12 months. The day whose name corresponded to the name of the month was celebrated. It was a celebration of life, seasons changing, God, and joy. In Zoroastrianism, happiness is very important and is considered as a holy virtue that must be attracted. Thus, this religion has always had many feasts and celebrations.\n\nWhat that day corresponds to in another calendar is subject to which variant of the Zoroastrian calendar is followed:\n\nThe \"Bastani\" calendar is used primarily in Greater Iran and by Persians of the diaspora, while Zoroastrians of India (subject to calendrical faction) use one of the other three variants.\n\nNon-Zoroastrian Iranians do not observe any variant of the Zoroastrian calendar, but instead use Iranian calendars. When introduced in 1925, the Zoroastrian festival days were pegged to the \"Bastani\" variant of the Zoroastrian calendar. The first six months of the civil calendar had 31 days each, while all Zoroastrian calendar months have 30 days each. So by the 7th month (Mehr) there is a difference of 6 days between the two. Thus, October 8, which in the \"Bastani\"/\"Fasili\" calendar is the 16th day of Mehr month, is in the Persian civil calendar the 10th day (Aban) of the same month.\n\nThe relationship between Mehregān and the various calendars is perhaps better understood relative to Nowruz. When (relative to another calendar) the first day of the year occurs is subject to interpretation, but independent of when it occurs, Mehregān is celebrated 195 days after that, that is on the 196th day of the year.\n\n\nhttp://Mehrgan.nipoc.org/\n\n\n"}

He is considered the champion of Croatian modernist literature, opening Croatia to the currents of European modernism.\n\nMatoš was born in Tovarnik, in the eastern Croatian region of Syrmia. In September 1875, when he was two years old, his parents moved to Zagreb, where he went to primary and secondary school. His attempt to study at the Military Veterinary College in Vienna in 1891 ended in failure due to an illness. He was conscripted in 1893, but he deserted in August 1894, fleeing from Croatia to Šabac and then to Belgrade. He spent the next three years in Belgrade, living in his own words as a \"cello player, journalist, and man of letters\". In January 1898 he traveled to Vienna and Munich, stayed for a while in Geneva, and then moved to Paris in 1899, where he would stay for five years. During his stay in Paris, he wrote his greatest stories. In 1904 he returned to Belgrade, visiting Zagreb in secret (as he was still wanted as a deserter) twice that year and again in 1906 and 1907. Finally, in 1908, after thirteen years abroad, he was pardoned and finally settled in Zagreb. In December 1913, as his health was failing, he was admitted to the Sisters of Charity Hospital where he died in March 1914 of throat cancer. He wrote two dozen published or unpublished works: poems, short stories, articles, travelogues, criticisms and disputes.\n\nMatoš is the central figure of Croatian modernism (\"moderna\"), a radical change in Croatian literature under European influences, as it quickly absorbed contemporary tendencies and styles such as Symbolism, modernism or impressionism, relying on French literary heritage from Baudelaire to Mallarmé, Barres and Huysmans. Estheticism and artistic norms became the primary value criterion. National and social activism, which used to be virtually the only measuring stick, became only a part of a wider mission of Croatian writers. After Matoš, the writers were not expected to create art for propaganda purposes (except during communism).\n\nHe entered into Croatian literature in 1892 with a short story called \"Moć savjesti\" (The Power of Conscience). Its publication is considered the start of Croatian \"moderna\". He wrote down his thoughts on literary creation and role models on several occasions. \"As for short story writers, I have the greatest affection for Poe's genius and the superior, concise precision of Merimée and the natural feel of Maupassant's satire,\" he told his friend Milan Ogrizović in a letter.\n\nHis short stories are usually divided into two groups, based primarily on his themes, but also his techniques, methods and styles: \nBoth groups share a strong lyrical note and love plots. They were created in parallel, at the same time, which indicates that it was no \"evolution\" of Matoš as a storyteller, but that he strove to use different subjects for his \"studies in style\", as he described them.\n\nMany elements of his stories with Croatian themes, such as the social problems of his time, spilled into his cycle of grotesque fantasies. That cycle, however, mainly explores the themes of mysterious love, death and nocturnal states and phenomena. For that purpose, Matoš reduced the plot, deeply analyzed the individual destinies of his heroes, removed superficial and anecdotal elements, and introduced implausible events and bizarre characters. Such tales push psychological motives to the forefront, while the social element becomes secondary. Because of all this, the grotesque tales abandoned the regional and national for the cosmopolitan.\nIn his travelogues, Matoš was one of the greatest Croatian innovators. Landscape, not as a part of a tale, but as an independent subject, was introduced by Matoš to the Croatian literature under the influence of Barres. His landscapes are not external images, but active settings in which the author moves. In fact, their purpose is not only to evoke feelings, but also to develop associations that lead to thoughts about wildly different issues. Such clearly impressionist strategy, which uses the landscape for emotional excitement that spills over to all kinds of topics, is a typical feature of almost all the prose works of Matoš. He wrote many exceptional travelogues where the landscape is the only subject, the most famous being \"Oko Lobora\" (Around Lobor).\n\nWhile he wrote and published short stories, travelogues, criticisms and articles over his entire career, Matoš started seriously writing and publishing poetry in his late period, around 1906, and wrote only around 100 poems. There can be no doubt that his great mentor was Baudelaire, since he took many formal elements from the great poet and wrote enthusiastically about Baudelaire on several occasions.\n\nThe style of his poetry is marked by the predilection for the sonnet form, the gift for the musical qualities of verses, the harmony of words, colors and smells (synesthetic metaphor), a very refined rhythm, and the mix of talking and singing intonation.\n\nHis main poetic themes in the early phase are \"love\" and \"flower\", as he merges the abstract quality of love with the concrete poetic symbol of flowers. Another recurrent theme is death, which suffuses his poems with an elegiac quality, an intense feeling of transience and passing, a merging of dreams and reality, with stifled colors and sounds, and the experience of love as pain. His best love poems are \"Samotna ljubav\" (Lonely Love), \"Djevojčici mjesto igračke\" (To a Child Instead of a Toy), \"Utjeha kose\" (Comfort of Hair).\n\nHe wrote some of the best landscape poetry in Croatian literature, reflecting his emotional states in poetic landscapes of \"Jesenje veče\" (Autumn Evening) or \"Notturno\". On the other hand, he also used poems to express his patriotic feelings. In his best patriotic poems – \"Stara pjesma\" (Old Song), \"1909\" and \"Iseljenik\" (Immigrant) – the poet, who returned to his homeland in 1908, shows his disappointment with the Croats under Hungarian oppression.\n\nMatoš left a deep impression on the literary genres of criticism, essay and newspaper article. While using a strong impressionist approach to the works of Croatian (Kranjčević, Vidrić, Domjanić, Kamov) and Serbian writers (Sremac, Veselinović, Pandurović), Matoš often stated his own artistic beliefs in his articles. Since he believed art meant beauty, he considered the intensity of poet's expression or the individual writer's style as the main criterion for the valuation of literature. For this reason, he made no difference between genres: fiction, poetry and criticism are all just art, which should primarily reflect the individual character of the artist and their ability for original expression. Still, despite such general criteria, he never neglected the national element when analyzing Croatian writers.\n\nPoems: collected poetry (posthumous)\n\nShort stories\n\nEssays\n\n"}

This god is not mentioned on any known Roman altarstones from the continent, and is therefore thought to be a native British deity. The fact that the god is revered at Benwell (1327 [et Num Aug], 1328, 1329 [c.AD175-7]) by a legionary legate, the tribune of an auxiliary infantry cohort and the prefect of an auxiliary cavalry ala, lends credence to this assumption, and perhaps proves that the god was not transferred here as the patron deity of an auxiliary regiment.\nThe sandstone head of the statue of Antenociticus was discovered in 1862 at the temple in Benwell. A torc can be seen around the neck, and the hair on the head curls forward so as to resemble two horns. Parts of the lower leg and forearm of the statue were also found, indicating that a life-sized statue of the god once stood in the temple.\n\nThe small temple of Antenociticus stands in the vicus (civilian settlement) outside Benwell (Condercum) Fort, one of 13 permanent forts added to the line of Hadrian’s Wall during its construction. The temple was built in about AD 178-80, probably to mark the promotion of the Roman cavalry prefect who dedicated one of three altars in the temple to Antenociticus. It is thought Antenociticus was possibly worshipped as a source of inspiration and intercession in military matters. Antenociticus is not mentioned at any other Romano-British site or on any inscriptions from the Continent, hence his identification as a local deity.\n\nThe head of Antenociticus and the temple altars, formerly displayed at the Museum of Antiquities at Newcastle University, can now be seen at the Great North Museum in the same city of Newcastle.\n\nArchaeologists have speculated that a similar sandstone head, unearthed at Binchester Roman Fort near Bishop Auckland in 2013, may also be of Antenociticus.\n\nRoss, A (1967): Pagan Celtic Britain: Studies in Iconography and Tradition.

Hetzel's parents were originally from South Australia but in London at the time while Kenneth worked at the University College Hospital. They returned to Adelaide in 1925. There he, along with his brother Peter (born 1924), was schooled at King's College and St Peter's College, Adelaide.\n\nHetzel studied medicine at the University of Adelaide from 1940 to 1944. As a medical student, he was granted reserved occupation status during World War II. He later applied to join the Royal Australian Air Force as a medical officer but was denied on grounds of being unfit due to a long bout of pulmonary tuberculosis in 1945.\n\nHe was a Fulbright Research Scholar in the 1950s which included an appointment at New York Hospital. In 1954, Hetzel and his family travelled to London where he undertook a Research Fellowship in the Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism at St Thomas' Hospital.\n\nHis first job after completing medical studies was as a Resident Medical Officer at Parkside Mental Hospital from 1946 to 1947. Upon completion of his Fulbright Scholar commitments, Hetzel was appointed as the first Michell Research Scholar at the University of Adelaide, where he remained for three years. He then undertook the role of Reader in Medicine at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Adelaide before moving to Monash University as the Foundation Professor of Social and Preventive Medicine. In 2001, the Queen Elizabeth Hospital established the Basil Hetzel Institute for Medical Research in his honour.\n\nIn 1956, Hetzel became a founding member of the South Australian Mental Health Association, and along with other members, went on to assist with the establishment of the crisis support service Lifeline which still runs today.\n\nHe also held the position of first chief of the CSIRO Division of Human Nutrition. Hetzel was the Chancellor of the University of South Australia from 1992, shortly after its establishment, until 1998. In 2005, the building for health sciences at the university's City East campus was named the Basil Hetzel building and the campus library also has a Hetzel room which contains a collection of his research. Hetzel was Lieutenant Governor of South Australia from April 1992 to May 2000. He was chair of the Bob Hawke Prime Ministerial Centre from 1998 to 2007.\n\nHetzel worked in remote areas of Papua New Guinea with the Public Health Department of the then Territory, and his research concluded that the endemic goitre and associated cretinism was attributable to an iodine deficient diet. He also demonstrated that dietary supplementation would entirely prevent these illnesses.\n\nIn the 1980s Hetzel, supported by the Australian Agency for International Development, became an international advocate for iodine supplementation, which is now taken for granted with iodinated table salt. This was part of the stimulus for the creation of the Iodine Global Network, then called the International Council for Control of Iodine Deficiency Disorders (ICCIDD), which is funded by various government, non-government and community organisations including the United Nations, the Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition, UNICEF, the World Health Organization, and the World Bank. The ICCIDD is considered the expert body regarding iodine deficiency disorders and they implement national programs for the prevention of iodine deficiency. As a result of their advocacy, many countries have now legislated that salt for human and animal consumption must be iodised. Much of this success has been attributed to Hetzel's \"indefatigable dedication to elimination of iodine deficiency disorders.\" In 2010, the ICCIDD established a Basil Hetzel International Award for Communications for individuals who contribute to promoting awareness of iodine nutrition. It is claimed that iodine supplementation has been achieved in 70% of households worldwide by 2000.\n\nIn the 1960s, he led research in Papua New Guinea that identified the link between iodine deficiency and significant brain damage in unborn children.\n\nHetzel married Mary Helen Eyles in 1946. Together they had five children; Susan (born 1947), Richard (born 1949), Robert (born 1951), Jay (born 1952) and Elizabeth (born 1956). Helen died of cancer in December 1980. In 1983 Hetzel married again, to Anne Fisher.\n\nHetzel was a member of Pilgrim Uniting Church in Adelaide.\n\nHetzel died on 4 February 2017, aged 94.\n\n\n"}

Rebellious by nature, he was expelled from Rijeka high school and dropped out of the school in Zagreb. Because of his participation in the demonstration against the Hungarian governor in Croatia, Khuen-Héderváry, he was sentenced to three months in prison in 1903. Headstrong and temperamental, he called himself Kamov, after Ham (or Kam) from the Old Testament, who saw his father Noah naked but unlike his siblings Shem and Japhet did not cover his nakedness, thus issuing a curse. Kamov probably saw himself as a revealer of bourgeoise hypocrisy and wrote to his brother Vladimir in 1910 - \"Kamov to me is a literary program...\"\n\nKamov was a very special writer. His literary work was small, but very significant, because in his poems and plays he expressed his anger and displeasure over hypocrisy and injustice of his contemporaries in a way unprecedented in Croatian literature. His masterwork is a modernist novel \"Isušena kaljuža\" (1906–1909) saturated with psychosexual and spiritual conflicts of the iconoclastic first-person narrator and later described as a proto-existentialist prose, written decades before the literary movement's appearance. Kamov's novel, invariably described as the premier Croatian avant-garde major prose work, was printed for the first time in 1956. Because of that he earned reputation as one of the greatest rebels and iconoclasts in history of Croatian culture.\n\nHe died at the age of 24 in Barcelona and was buried at the hospital cemetery near Hospital de la Santa Creu.\n\n"}
