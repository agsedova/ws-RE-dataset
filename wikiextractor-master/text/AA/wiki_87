{"id": "1896834", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1896834", "title": "Lorrie Morgan", "text": "Lorrie Morgan\n\nLoretta Lynn Morgan (born June 27, 1959) is an American country music singer. She is the daughter of George Morgan, widow of Keith Whitley, and ex-wife of Jon Randall and Sammy Kershaw, all of whom are also country music singers. Morgan has been active as a singer since the age of 13, and charted her first single in 1979. She achieved her greatest success between 1988 and 1999, recording for RCA Records Nashville and the defunct BNA Records. Her first two RCA albums (\"Leave the Light On\" and \"Something in Red\") and her BNA album \"Watch Me\" are all certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The 1995 compilation \"\" is her best-selling album with a double-platinum certification; \"War Paint\", \"Greater Need\", and \"Shakin' Things Up\", also on BNA, are certified gold.\n\nMorgan has made over forty chart entries on the \"Billboard\" Hot Country Songs charts, including three number-one singles: \"Five Minutes\", \"What Part of No\", and \"I Didn't Know My Own Strength\", along with eleven additional top-ten hits. Morgan has recorded in collaboration with her father, as well as Whitley, Randall, Kershaw, Frank Sinatra, Johnny Mathis, Tammy Wynette, Dolly Parton, Andy Williams, the New World Philharmonic, and Pam Tillis. She is also a member of the Grand Ole Opry. Morgan's musical style is defined largely by country pop influences and her dramatic singing voice, with frequent stylistic comparisons to Tammy Wynette.\n\nLoretta Lynn Morgan was born in Nashville, Tennessee on June 27, 1959. She is the fifth child of country music singer George Morgan. Her mother was Anastasia \"Anna\" Paridon Trainor, who died in 2018. At age 13, Lorrie Morgan made her first performance on the Grand Ole Opry, when her father brought her onstage to perform \"Paper Roses\". According to Morgan herself, the performance received a standing ovation. Morgan's father died in 1975, so she and the members of his band toured various small clubs until 1977, when they disbanded and she began touring with Roy Wiggins. After this, she worked as a receptionist, songwriter, and demo singer for Acuff-Rose Music.\n\nMorgan's employment at Acuff-Rose led to her signing with that company's Hickory Records label, which issued two singles in 1979: \"Two People in Love\" and \"Tell Me I'm Only Dreaming\". Respectively, these were written by Eddy Raven and Liz Anderson, and both made the lower regions of the Hot Country Songs charts that year. Another single, \"I'm Completely Satisfied with You\", featured electronically overdubbed vocals from her father, and also made the charts by year's end. During the early 1980s, Morgan continued to tour primarily in night clubs, and served as an opening act for Billy ThunderKloud & the Chieftones, Jeannie Seely, and Jack Greene among others. She also toured as a backing vocalist for George Jones, made guest appearances on the television series \"Nashville Now\", and in 1984 became the youngest inductee of the Grand Ole Opry. The same year she issued two singles on MCA Records: \"Don't Go Changing\" reached the lower regions of Hot Country Songs, while \"If You Came Back Tonight\" did not chart.\n\nMorgan signed to RCA Records Nashville in 1988 and issued her debut single \"Trainwreck of Emotion\" that year. The song reached number 20 on the Hot Country Songs chart and served as the lead single to her debut album \"Leave the Light On\". Following the song were the top-ten hits \"Dear Me\", \"Out of Your Shoes\", and then \"Five Minutes\", which became her first number-one single in 1990. The album's last single, \"He Talks to Me\", also reached top ten. Barry Beckett was the album's producer, and contributing songwriters included Mike Reid, Jon Vezner, and Beth Nielsen Chapman. Following the album's last single, RCA also issued \"'Til a Tear Becomes a Rose\", a duet between Morgan and Keith Whitley from the latter's \"Greatest Hits\" album. The song would later win Vocal Event of the Year from the Country Music Association. Thom Owens of AllMusic reviewed \"Leave the Light On\" favorably, calling it \"a skilled and assured blend of traditional country, honky tonk, country-rock and modern pop sensibilities that pointed the direction toward the sound, style and musical eclecticism of '90s contemporary country.\" \"The Chicago Tribune\" writer Jack Hurst rated the album four out of four stars, referring to it as \"fine, well-produced songs and a compelling performer\". In 1993, \"Leave the Light On\" earned a platinum certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipments of one million copies.\n\nHer second RCA album \"Something in Red\" came out in 1991. Also certified platinum by the RIAA, it accounted for four Hot Country Songs entries between then and early 1992: \"We Both Walk\", a cover of George Jones' \"A Picture of Me (Without You)\", and \"Except for Monday\" all reached top ten, while title track reached number fourteen in early 1992. The album also included a duet with Dolly Parton titled \"Best Woman Wins\", which also appeared on the latter's 1992 album \"Eagle When She Flies\". Richard Landis produced the album except for the duet, which Parton produced with Steve Buckingham and Gary Smith. Contributing songwriters included Skip Ewing, Reed Nielsen, and Chris Waters. Brian Mansfield of AllMusic reviewed \"Something in Red\" favorably, noting that it had fewer \"sad songs\" than its predecessor while highlighting the \"laidback country and ballads like the title track\".\n\nMorgan's third album, \"Watch Me\", was issued on BNA Records (then known as BNA Entertainment). The title track was the first single, achieving a peak of number two on Hot Country Songs in 1992. The followup \"What Part of No\" became her second number-one single on that chart, holding that position for three weeks. After this came \"I Guess You Had to Be There\" and \"Half Enough\". The album featured backing vocals from Dale Daniel and The Remingtons, two other acts recording for BNA at the time; Richard Mainegra and Rick Yancey of the latter group also wrote the closing track \"She's Takin' Him Back Again\". As with the previous album, Landis again served as producer. Mansfield praised the album as being superior to its predecessors, but criticized \"What Part of No\" and Morgan's cover of Bonnie Tyler's \"It's a Heartache\". Alanna Nash of \"Entertainment Weekly\" rated the album \"B\", stating that \"Morgan is a take-charge singer with more than a little vulnerability beneath her steely surface as well as an ability to adopt pop stylings without straining her country credibility.\" \"Watch Me\" became her third consecutive platinum album by the end of 1993.\n\nMorgan released her first Christmas album, \"Merry Christmas from London\", at the end of 1993. The album featured orchestral accompaniment from the New World Philharmonic orchestra, and duets with Tammy Wynette (a medley titled \"A Christmas Festival\"), Andy Williams (\"Little Snow Girl\"), and Johnny Mathis (\"Blue Snowfall\"). Roch Parisien of AllMusic panned the album for lacking in country sound. The album charted two seasonal entries on Hot Country Songs: a rendition of \"My Favorite Things\" in late 1993, and of \"Sleigh Ride\" two years later. Morgan sang \"Little Snow Girl\" with Williams as part of a Christmas special hosted at his Moon River Theater in Branson, Missouri which also aired on the television network PBS, and said that she chose to perform with him because she had been a fan of his music since childhood. A year after the album's release, Morgan began a special holiday tour which featured her performing songs from the album with orchestral backing. She also made her acting debut in this timespan, starting with the 1993 made-for-TV movie \"Proudheart\" on the defunct TNN (The Nashville Network). It featured her in the starring role as an assembly-line worker who moves back to a small town in Tennessee after the death of her father. In 1994, she portrayed the lead role in a television pilot for CBS called \"Lorelei Lee\". The show focused on a country music-singing detective, but the pilot was not picked up for series. The following year, she appeared in the ABC TV movie \"The Stranger Beside Me\".\n\nBNA issued her next studio album, \"War Paint\", in 1994. The album's singles were unsuccessful on the charts, with \"My Night to Howl\" peaking at number 31 on Hot Country Songs, \"If You Came Back from Heaven\" failing to reach top 40, and \"Heart Over Mind\" stopping at number 39. Despite this, the album was certified gold by the RIAA for shipments of 500,000 copies. \"War Paint\" also accounted for Morgan's first writing credits on one of her own albums in the title track and \"If You Came Back from Heaven\", the latter of which she wrote as a tribute to Whitley. Also included were two cover songs: Jeannie Seely's \"Don't Touch Me\" and George Jones' \"A Good Year for the Roses\", which she recorded as a duet with Sammy Kershaw. Thom Owens of AllMusic wrote of the album that the singles \"hold up really well, but the rest of the album is a little too familiar for comfort.\" Nash noted Morgan's ability to sing songs with \"intimacy\" and \"attitude\", but criticized the \"Native American stereotypes\" of the title track. By year's end, Morgan had also begun touring as a headlining artist for the first time.\n\nIn 1995, Morgan released her first \"Greatest Hits\" album. It included most of her major hit singles to that point, along with three new tracks which were all issued as singles: \"I Didn't Know My Own Strength\" became her third and final number-one hit that year, followed by the top-five \"Back in Your Arms Again\", but a cover of Billie Jo Spears' \"Standing Tall\" was less successful on the charts. \"Greatest Hits\" also became her highest-certified album by the RIAA, reaching double-platinum status for shipments of two million copies.\n\nMorgan's next album \"Greater Need\" was released in 1996. Leading off the singles was the Jon Randall duet \"By My Side\", which became Randall's only top 40 hit. The song was originally intended to be a duet with Kershaw, but after his label expressed disinterest, the then-president of Morgan's label suggested that she cut it with Randall. While the followup single \"I Just Might Be\" failed to make top 40 on Hot Country Songs, the album's last single \"Good as I Was to You\" reached number four in 1997. Morgan said that she wanted the album to show her \"maturing musically\" over her previous works. She noted that she had originally declined the album's title track until she was encouraged by Thom Schuyler, a singer-songwriter who was also the president of artists and repertoire (A&R) at her label at the time, at which point she realized the song was indicative of the musical themes she wanted to pursue on the album. The album included guest vocals from Vince Gill, Travis Tritt, and her son Jesse Keith Whitley. James Stroud produced the album, and contributing musicians included Dann Huff, Paul Franklin, Billy Joe Walker Jr., Glenn Worf, Alison Krauss, and former Toto member David Hungate. Thom Owens of AllMusic, Alanna Nash of \"Entertainment Weekly\", and Jeffrey B. Remz of \"Country Standard Time\" all praised the album for its varied sounds, with particular emphasis on its ballads.\n\nShe also released \"Shakin' Things Up\" in 1997. It featured the top-ten hit \"Go Away\" and the top-20 single \"One of Those Nights Tonight\", but the following singles \"I'm Not That Easy to Forget\" and \"You Think He'd Know Me Better\" both failed to make top 40. Also included on the album was a cover of The Shirelles' \"Will You Love Me Tomorrow\". Morgan held her first co-production credit on the album, doing so with Stroud; backing vocalists on the album included John Cowan, Vern Gosdin, and Randall. Tom Roland of \"The Tennessean\" considered the album her strongest since \"Something in Red\", saying that it \"combines a commanding, upbeat attitude with a few moments of subtle disturbance. And does so flawlessly.\" Remz highlighted the vocal performance on the Shirelles cover and the single \"One of Those Nights Tonight\" in particular, while calling the Bill Anderson composition \"I've Enjoyed as Much of This as I Can Stand\" the strongest song. \"Shakin' Things Up\" also earned a gold certification. Another album, \"Secret Love\", followed in 1998. This album was composed entirely of cover songs dating largely from the 1940s and 1950s, and produced no singles. Morgan dedicated the album to her father, whom she claims introduced her to such music. Among the songs covered were \"Fly Me to the Moon\", \"I've Got the World on a String\", and \"Good Morning Heartache\". For this album, Landis returned to production duties, while musical accompaniment was largely handled by pianist Beegie Adair and the Nashville String Machine, a session string ensemble. Morgan performed ten concerts in 1998 which promoted the album, with Adair and a small orchestra accompanying her. Charlotte Dillon of AllMusic wrote that \"her voice and emotional delivery are up to the test, even for old ballads and standards\", while Nash found her delivery \"overly dramatic\".\n\nHer last BNA studio album was \"My Heart\" in 1999. The only successful single from the album was the Sammy Kershaw duet \"Maybe Not Tonight\", which was concurrently issued on Kershaw's 1999 album of the same name, and simultaneously promoted by both BNA and Mercury Nashville, the label to which Kershaw was signed at the time. Audio engineer Csaba Petocz produced the album, except for the Kershaw duet, which was handled by Keith Stegall. Also included on the album was a cover of Bryan Adams' \"The Only Thing That Looks Good on Me Is You\", and the Jo Dee Messina duet \"The Things We Do\". Contributing songwriters included Robert Ellis Orrall, Leslie Satcher, Trey Bruce, Stegall, and Randall. Tom Roland of \"The Tennessean\" found the album's first half stronger than its second half, praising the collaborative songs and Morgan's vocal delivery on \"Strong Enough to Cry\", but criticizing the Adams cover. Tom Netherland of \"Country Standard Time\" was largely negative toward the album as a whole, criticizing the \"too-slick production\" and the lyrics on the ballads in particular. BNA issued a second compilation, \"\", in 2000. Included on the album, in addition to several more of her hit singles, were covers of Sarah McLachlan's \"Angel\" and Tammy Wynette's \"Another Lonely Song\". Morgan then ended her contract with BNA at the time of the album's release, with \"The Tennessean\" columnist Brad Schmitt noting at the time that the departure from her label was amicable, and was likely spurred by declining sales and creative differences.\n\nIn 2001, RCA Nashville (of which BNA was a division at the time) signed both Morgan and Kershaw, who had just ended his tenure with Mercury, to a one-album deal. This deal included the collaborative album \"I Finally Found Someone\", featuring six duets and three solo songs from each artist. Morgan's manager noted at the time that RCA's decision to re-sign her after having previously dropped her from the BNA division was \"unusual\". The album's title track was originally recorded by Bryan Adams and Barbra Streisand for the latter's 1996 movie \"The Mirror Has Two Faces\", and Morgan said that she had wanted to record the song after having seen the movie. One single, the duet \"He Drinks Tequila\", became Morgan's last top 40 entry on Hot Country Songs that year. Maria Konicki Dinoia of AllMusic showed favor toward the contrast in the two singers' voices, highlighting the more uptempo songs such as \"He Drinks Tequila\" in particular. Nash was less positive, calling the album \"oddly reminiscent of the worst of '80s radio.\"\n\nMorgan signed to Image Entertainment in 2002. Her first project for the label was \"The Color of Roses\", a two-disc compilation featuring live performances of both her hit singles and pop standards accompanied by the Belmont University School of Music Orchestra, recorded on September 1, 2001 at the Tennessee Performing Arts Center in Nashville. The second disc included two studio recordings (the title track and a rendition of Sammi Smith's \"Help Me Make It Through the Night\") and a 43-minute interview. Charles Calello and Sandy Linzer produced the project, which was also issued on DVD and VHS. Image also released the studio album \"Show Me How\" in 2004. It accounted for her last chart entry, \"Do You Still Want to Buy Me That Drink (Frank)\", which peaked at number 50 on Hot Country Songs. \"Show Me How\" reunited her with Landis on production duties. James Manheim of AllMusic described her vocals as \"better than ever\", while also praising Landis's production and the lyrics.\nMorgan's eleventh album \"A Moment in Time\" was released on October 27, 2009, on the Stroudavarious label. It features fourteen covers of traditional country songs, and duets with Tracy Lawrence and The Mavericks' lead singer Raul Malo. Thom Jurek of AllMusic praised the album's production and song choices, writing that \"she is jaw-droppingly sincere, and her interpretations of these songs make them her own because of their originality, without sacrificing reverence for the standard versions. \" In 2010, Morgan released another studio album called \"I Walk Alone\". It included twelve songs that she co-wrote and co-produced, and she described it as occupying \"a particularly introspective and vulnerable place in her life\". This was followed in 2014 by \"Dos Divas\", a collaboration album with Pam Tillis. Morgan released a further solo album in 2016, \"Letting Go...Slow\", and a second duets album with Tillis in 2017, \"Come See Me and Come Lonely\". In addition to these albums, Morgan has continued to tour and perform on the Grand Ole Opry in the 2010s.\n\nMorgan's style is defined by her singing voice, and the combination of ballads and uptempo material present in her discography. Robert K. Oermann of \"The Tennessean\" described her as a \"the blonde with the torchy delivery\", and Alanna Nash called her voice a \"throaty sob\". Remz wrote in a review of \"Greater Need\" that \"Morgan's voice always has been her strength, often getting right at the heart of songs of heartbreak and loss, her signature\", while saying in a review of \"To Get to You\" that she \"turn[s] in readings with a good deal of emotion tossed in without being overwrought. Sometimes the singing is almost too perfect, sacrificing intensity in the process.\" Nash contrasted her with Tammy Wynette, writing of her first greatest-hits album that it was \"a reminder that Morgan is capable of delivering the kind of feisty songwriting that harkens back to Wynette’s halcyon days in the '70s.\" Morgan also felt that the comparisons to Wynette in her singing style and song choices were helpful in making her music appeal to female fans. Nash has also described Morgan as \"plainspoken\", referring to \"What Part of No\" as a song that \"showcases her pull-no-punches style.\" Writing for \"The Times of Northwest Indiana\", Jim Patterson stated that \"Like Wynette, Morgan is tough but vulnerable, scarred by tragedy and dogged by the tabloids. And like Wynette, she can make it all come pouring out in her voice.\" James Manheim of AllMusic said of her songs' themes that they displayed a \"sense of humor and play to her usual strengths in the genres of the breakup ballad and everywoman barroom encounter song.\"\n\nMorgan has contributed to a number of collaborative works. In 1993, she recorded a rendition of Buck Owens' \"Crying Time\" for the soundtrack of the film \"The Beverly Hillbillies\", and charted for six weeks on Hot Country Songs with this rendition. She contributed to three multi-artist albums in 1994: the Eagles tribute album \"\", which featured her covering that band's 1979 song \"The Sad Café\"; Frank Sinatra's \"Duets II\", on which she sang a medley of James Ingram and Patti Austin's \"How Do You Keep the Music Playing?\" and Sinatra's \"My Funny Valentine\"; and \"\", which dubbed her voice with Whitley's on the duet \"I Just Want You\". The Beach Boys' 1996 album \"Stars and Stripes Vol. 1\", a collaborative album with several country music artists, featured her on a rendition of \"Don't Worry Baby\". Also in 1996, she was one of many artists to contribute to \"Hope: Country Music's Quest for a Cure\", a multi-artist charity single sponsored by the T. J. Martell Foundation to promote leukemia research. This song charted on Hot Country Songs for four weeks in mid-1996.\n\nMorgan is also known for her turbulent personal life. In a July 2004 appearance on \"Larry King Live\", she told Larry King that \"drama is something that lets you know you're still alive.\" Morgan's first husband was Ron Gaddis, a musician in George Jones' road band, to whom she was married from 1979 to 1981. The two had one daughter, Morgan Anastasia Gaddis. Her second marriage was to country music singer Keith Whitley, which lasted from 1986 until Whitley's death from alcohol poisoning in 1989. Of her relationship with Whitley, she said in 1994 that \"At this point in my life, if I met another Keith Whitley, I would walk away 'cause I don't think I could handle it. But as far as him being The One, yeah, I think we could have lasted forever.\" They also had one son, Jesse Keith Whitley.\n\nIn 1991 she married Brad Thompson, a former bus driver for Clint Black, but the two divorced in 1993. During her marriage to Thompson, she suffered from ovarian cysts which led to a hysterectomy. Morgan began dating American football player Troy Aikman in late 1993, but they amicably separated by year's end. From 1994 to 1996, Morgan was romantically linked to actor and politician Fred Thompson. Morgan observed that her relationship with Thompson increased her personal interest in political matters, but also caused her to \"stop and think about the political implications of everything before I uttered a word in public.\" She also observed that she wished to marry Thompson, but felt that his political background would keep him from accepting her for who she was.\n\nMorgan married country singer Jon Randall in 1996, and a year later, she published an autobiography, \"Forever Yours, Faithfully: My Love Story\". In 1998, tabloids published allegations that Morgan had been spotted in the back of a limousine with Bill Clinton, then the President of the United States, but Morgan dismissed the claims as \"fabricated\". Morgan and Randall divorced in 1999. She married her fifth husband, singer Sammy Kershaw, on September 29, 2001. Morgan filed for divorce, citing irreconcilable differences on October 23, 2007. In 2008, Morgan filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, with an estimated $1 to $10 million in debts. She would later state that her bankruptcy was because she \"didn't watch [her] own money\" or audit her accountants. Her sixth marriage took place on September 15, 2010, to Tennessee businessman Randy White.\n\n\n"}

It also incorporates a large open-air museum with more than 150 buildings, relocated from towns and rural districts.\n\nThe Norwegian Museum of Cultural History is situated on the Bygdøy peninsula near several other museums, including the Viking Ship Museum; the Fram Museum; the Kon-Tiki Museum; and the Norwegian Maritime Museum.\n\n\"Norsk Folkemuseum\" was established in 1894 by librarian and historian Hans Aall (1867-1946). It acquired the core area of its present property in 1898. After having built temporary exhibition buildings and re-erected a number of rural buildings, the museum could open its gates to the public in 1901. In 1907, the collections of King Oscar II, on the neighbouring site, was incorporated into the museum. Its five relocated buildings, with the Gol Stave Church in the centre, is recognized as the world's first open-air museum, founded in 1881.\n\nHans Aall was the director until his death in 1946. Under his leadership the museum experienced a substantial growth of its area, staff, collections, buildings and number of visitors. Reidar Kjellberg became Director of the museum in 1947 and remained museum director until he retired, in 1974. From 1990 until 2000, Erik Rudeng was the director. The director since 2001 is Olav Aaraas.\n\nAmong the museum's more significant buildings are the 13th-century Gol Stave Church, which was incorporated into the Norsk Folkemuseum in 1907. The Gol Stave Church is one of five medieval buildings at the museum, which also includes the 14th-century Rauland farmhouse (\"Raulandstua\") and the 1865 tenement building relocated from 15 Wessels gate in Oslo. Seven of the nine flats show typical interiors from various periods of the 19th and 20th centuries, including a flat inhabited by an immigrant family from Pakistan as it was furnished in 2002. In 1951, the Sami collections in the Ethnographic Museum of the University of Oslo were transferred to the Norsk Folkemuseum.\n\nThe museum also possesses a large photographic archive, including a significant portion of the works of Anders Beer Wilse. In 2004, the administration of the adjacent Bygdøy Royal Estate was transferred to the museum. Throughout its existence, research has focused on building and furniture, clothing and textiles, technical and social culture, agriculture, working memory and Sami culture.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1896864", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1896864", "title": "9½ Weeks", "text": "9½ Weeks\n\nConsidered too explicit by its American distributor, the film was heavily edited for release in the U.S., where it was a box office bomb, grossing only $6.7 million on a $17 million budget. It also received mixed reviews at the time of its release. However, it became a huge success internationally in its unedited version, particularly in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom, making $100 million worldwide. It has also acquired a large fanbase on video and DVD and has developed a cult following.\n\nThe title of the film refers to the duration of a relationship between Wall Street arbitrageur John Gray and divorced SoHo art gallery employee Elizabeth McGraw in her early 30s. John initiates and controls the various experimental sexual practices of this volatile relationship to push Elizabeth's boundaries. In doing so, Elizabeth experiences a gradual downward spiral toward emotional breakdown.\n\nElizabeth first sees John in New York City at a Chinese grocer, and later at a street fair where she decides against buying an expensive scarf. John wins her heart when he eventually produces that scarf. They start dating, and Elizabeth is increasingly subjected to John's behavioral peculiarities; he blindfolds Elizabeth, who is at first reluctant to comply with his sexual demands, but eventually surrenders to them. He gives her an expensive gold watch, and instructs her to use it to think about him touching her every day at noon. She takes this imperative even further by masturbating at her workplace at the designated time.\n\nElizabeth wants to include John in her life and meet her friends, but he makes it clear he only wishes to see her in the evenings, and instructs her to see her friends in the daytime.\n\nElizabeth's confusion about John increases when he leaves her alone at his apartment. She examines his closet until she discovers a photograph of him with another woman, April Tover. John asks her if she went through his things, declaring that he will punish her. He then sexually assaults her.\n\nElizabeth's heightened need for psychosexual stimulation drives her to stalk John to his office. When they have lunch and she mentions she would like to \"be one of the guys,\" he arranges for her to crossdress for a rendezvous. On leaving the establishment, two men hurl a homophobic slur when they mistake John and Elizabeth for a gay couple. A fight ensues. Elizabeth picks up a knife from one of the attackers and stabs one of them in the buttocks and both attackers flee. After the fight, Elizabeth reveals a wet tank-top and has sex onsite with John with intensely visceral passion. Following this encounter, John's sexual games acquire sadomasochistic elements.\n\nRather than satisfying or empowering Elizabeth, such experiences intensify her emotional vulnerability. While meeting at a hotel room, John blindfolds her. A prostitute enters the room, and starts caressing Elizabeth as John observes them. The prostitute removes Elizabeth's blindfold and starts working on John. Elizabeth violently intervenes, and flees the hotel, with John in pursuit. They run until they find themselves in an adult entertainment venue. Elizabeth enters a room where a group of men are watching a couple have sex. Elizabeth, visibly upset, notices John watching her, and she starts kissing the man next to her. This affects John, and he moves towards her. Moments later, John and Elizabeth gravitate towards each other, finding themselves interlocked in each other's seemingly inescapable embrace.\n\nElizabeth's exhibition with the artist Farnsworth finally happens, but it's clear she's coming apart. In a sad scene, Farnsworth, clearly uncomfortable at the party, watches Elizabeth hiding in a corner, crying. Elizabeth leaves the party and calls John.\n\nThe following morning, we see Elizabeth has spent the night at John's. She gets up, and slowly packs her belongings from his apartment. When John realizes she's leaving, he attempts to share with her details about his life. Elizabeth tells him that it is too late as she leaves the apartment. John begins his mental countdown from 50, hoping she will come back by the time he is finished.\n\n\nThe film was a significant departure from the much darker tone of the novel it was based upon. In \"9½ Weeks: A Memoir of a Love Affair\", John engages in criminal behaviour and even coerces Elizabeth into committing a violent mugging in an elevator. The book culminates in a quasi-rape scenario which leaves Elizabeth in mental anguish, and he takes her to a mental hospital–never to return to her again. The film ends on a sombre tone, and there is no mention of the psychiatric breakdown that John inflicted upon his lover.\n\n\" Weeks\" has a 61% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 23 reviews. The critical consensus reads: \"\"9 1/2 Weeks\"' famously steamy sex scenes titillate though the drama unfolding between the beddings is relatively standard for the genre.\"\n\nThe film was championed by some critics. Roger Ebert praised the film, giving it three and a half stars out of four, stating: \"A lot of the success of \" Weeks\" is because Rourke and Basinger make the characters and their relationship convincing.\" He further elaborated by saying that their relationship was believable, and unlike many other characters in other erotic films at that time, the characters in this movie are much more real and human.\n\nOver time, some critics have warmed to the film and audiences gave it somewhat of a legacy thanks to its success in the rental market. It performed very well in Europe, particularly in Italy, France and also in Latin America. Its success in France was so strong that it played for five years at a Paris cinema, earning approximately $100 million.

{"id": "1896871", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1896871", "title": "Maasai language", "text": "Maasai language\n\nMaasai (Masai) or Maa (; \"ɔl Maa\") is an Eastern Nilotic language spoken in Southern Kenya and Northern Tanzania by the Maasai people, numbering about 800,000. It is closely related to the other Maa varieties: Samburu (or Sampur), the language of the Samburu people of central Kenya, Chamus, spoken south and southeast of Lake Baringo (sometimes regarded as a dialect of Samburu); and Parakuyu of Tanzania. The Maasai, Samburu, il-Chamus and Parakuyu peoples are historically related and all refer to their language as \"ɔl Maa\". Properly speaking, \"Maa\" refers to the language and the culture and \"Maasai\" refers to the people \"who speak Maa.\"\n\nThe Maasai people, from the Eastern region of the African continent, have been protected from the widespread Westernization of agriculture and colonization because they inhabit a primarily desert area. Because the Maasai have resisted forms of colonization and Western expansion, their systems of communication and exchange revolve primarily around the trade they do within the tribe. Therefore, the spoken language is not only the most significant point of contact that the Maasai use but also one of the only ways that Maasai can continue to thrive in their traditional tribal way of life.\n\nThe loss of the Maasai language, while not rapid, is happening as a result of close contact with other tribal groups in East Africa and the rise of Swahili and English as the dominant languages. In Tanzania, former President Nyerere encouraged the adoption of Swahili as an official language to unite the many different ethnic groups in Tanzania, as well as English to compete on a global scale. Although the Maasai language, often referred to as Maa, has survived despite the mass influx of English and Swahili education systems, economic plans, and more, the socioeconomic climate that the Maasai people face in East Africa keeps them, and their language, as an underrepresented minority.\n\nThe Maasai way of life is embedded in their language. Specifically, the economic systems of trade that the Maasai rely on in order to maintain their nomadic way of life, relies on the survival of the Maasai language, even in its minority status. With language endangerment, the Maasai tribe would continue to be threatened and its cultural integrity threatened. The minority status that the language currently faces has already threatened traditional Maasai practices. Fewer and fewer groups of Maasai continue to be nomadic in the region, choosing to settle instead in close knit communities to keep their language and other aspects of their culture alive.\n\nThe Maasai variety of \"ɔl Maa\" as spoken in southern Kenya and Tanzania has 30 contrasting sounds, which can be represented and alphabetized as followsː \"a\", \"b\", \"ch\" (a variant of \"sh\"), \"d\", \"e\", \"ɛ\", \"g\", \"h\", \"i\", \"ɨ\", \"j\", \"k\", \"l\", \"m\", \"n\", \"ny\", \"ŋ\", \"o\", \"ɔ\", \"p\", \"r\", \"rr\", \"s\", \"sh\" (with variant \"ch\"), \"t\", \"u\", \"ʉ\", \"w\", \"wu\" (or \"ww\"), \"y\", \"yi\" (or \"yy\"), and the glottal stop \"<nowiki>'</nowiki>\" (or \"ʔ\").\n\nTone is extremely important for conveying correct meaning in the Maasai language.\n\nIn the table of consonant phonemes below, phonemes are represented with IPA symbols. When IPA conventions differ from symbols normally used in practical writing, the latter are given in angle brackets.\n\nFor some Maasai speakers, the voiced stop consonants are not particularly implosive (e.g. IlKeekonyokie Maa), but for others they are lightly implosive or have a glottalic feature (e.g. Parakuyo Maa). In Arusha Maa, is typically realized as a voiceless fricative , but in some words it can be a voiced trill . At least in native Maa words, and occur in complementary distribution, with the former occurring directly after consonants and the latter elsewhere.\n\nLike the other Maa languages, Maasai has advanced tongue root vowel harmony. There are nine contrasting vowels, with the vowel being \"neutral\" for harmony.\nWord order is usually verb–subject–object, though order can vary because tone is the most important indicator of subject versus object. What really determines order in a clause is topicality; order in the most simple clauses can be predicted according to the information structure pattern: [Verb – Most.Topical – Less.Topical]. Thus, if the object is highly topical in the discourse (e.g. a first-person pronoun), and the subject is less topical, then the object will occur right after the verb and before the subject.\n\nThe Maasai language has only two fully grammatical prepositions, but can use \"relational nouns\" along with a most general preposition to designate specific locative ideas. Noun phrases begin with a demonstrative prefix or a gender-number prefix, followed by a quantifying noun or other head noun. Other modifiers follow the head noun, including possessive phrases.\n\nIn Maasai, many morphemes are actually tone patterns. Notice how the tone pattern affects the case, voice, and aspect of the words in the example below:\n\nThe Maasai language carries three forms of gendered nouns; feminine, masculine, and place. Native speakers of the language attach a gendered prefix to a noun. The meaning of the noun in context then refers to its gender. Nouns place gender as follows:\n\n\"Who has come?\" would be asked if the gender of the visitor were known. The noun would be preceded by a gendered prefix. If the gender of the visitor were unknown, \"it is who that has come?\" would be the literal [English translation] question. \n\nAdjectives in Maa serve only to describe the noun, and change tenses depending on the noun that they are describing. \n\nPronouns in Maa usually assign gender (male, female, or place); if gender is unknown, the meaning of the noun in context will usually refer to a gender. For example, the context of a female might include working in the house while a male gender would be implied if the action referred to work outside the home. The Maasai language uses place as a personal pronoun because place can help identify male or female (i.e. an action occurring in the house will almost always be done by a female).\n\nTone helps to indicate the verb-subject-order agreement.\n\nPresent tense in Maasai includes habitual actions, such as “I wake up” or “I cook breakfast”. Past tense refers only to past action, not a specific time or place.\n\n\n"}

This includes allegations of unknown sources of capital, favourable treatment by political parties.\n\nOn 26 February 2014, the Supreme Court of India had issues warrants to summon Subrata Roy, Managing Worker, Chairman and founder of Sahara India Pariwar, on a litigation on the Optionally Fully Convertible Debentures issued by the two companies of Sahara India Pariwar to which Securities and Exchange Board of India had claimed its jurisdiction and objected on why Sahara has not taken permission from it. Sahara has claimed that the said bonds are hybrid product, thus does not come under the jurisdiction of SEBI, instead is governed by Registrar of Companies (ROC) under Ministry of Corporate Affairs, from which the two companies of Sahara has already taken permission and submitted the red herring prospectus with ROC before issuing the bonds.\n\nSEBI in return ordered Sahara's two companies to stop issuing the said bonds and return money to investors. Sahara contested the case in various courts which eventually came to Supreme Court of India. On 14 June 2012, (during the final hearing of the case), the group had provided details of its financials up to 30 April 2012. While the court reserved its order, Sahara claims that it has already paid to 95% of the investors and discharged its OFCD liability to the tune of Rs. 23500 crores and only around Rs. 2260.69 crores are left against which Sahara has already deposited more than Rs. 12,000 crore which has with interest swelled to Rs. 16000 Crore. By 31 August 2012 the date of Supreme Court order, the group repaid majority of its OFCD investors between May the last date of hearing and by 30 August 2012 the final order. Since these repayments have not been taken into consideration, Sahara maintains that any money paid now will obviously mean a double payment towards one liability.\n\nIt is also been reported that Sahara has paid Rs 725.97 crore as TDS (tax deducted at source) to the Income Tax Departments on the interest which along with investment was repaid to 95 percent of the investors, between 2009–10 and 2012–13. The income tax authorities had found that the beneficiary investors were existent and accordingly confirmed the repayments made in those particular years. One of Sahara's arguments in the apex court revolves around the fact that if one government body has found investors, why can't the other.\n\nThe case itself comprises big numbers such as collection of over Rs 24,000 crore from three crore individuals, while once in 2013 Sahara sent 127 trucks containing 31,669 cartons full of over three crore application forms and two crore redemption vouchers to Sebi office. Apparently, this had resulted into a huge traffic jam on outskirts of Mumbai, where the regulator is headquartered. SEBI on the other hand because the trucks reached after office hours SEBI rejected the second batch of files, which as per Sahara contained 25% of the investor information.\n\nFurthermore, the market regulator SEBI advertised four times in more than 144 newspapers to ask the investors of Sahara to refund the money. And since August 2012 Sebi has only refunded Rs. 64 crore to the investors while it has Rs. 16000 crore from Sahara. On October 2014, a shocking revelation was made when only around 4,600 investors in two Sahara group companies had come forward to claim refunds from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), which had asked those who had purchased bonds issued by the entities to claim their money. This gave a valid point to Sahara's argument before courts that it had repaid most of the investors who had come forward to claim the investment which they had made in bonds issued by two group companies.\n\nReports also suggested that between the time that SEBI first initiated the inquiry four years ago and Roy's eventual detention and it is to note that till today there is not a single charge against him, there has not been a single instance of an investor in either of the two Sahara firms under watch actually filing a police complaint or going to court.\n\nHe was granted interim bail by the Supreme Court on 26 March 2014 on the condition that he would deposit the huge bail amount of Rs 10,000 crore. Subrata was eventually taken into judicial custody and sent to Tihar jail, along with two other Sahara directors, on 4 March 2014 for failing to deposit Rs 10,000 crore with SEBI. In Tihar jail, Subrata unsuccessfully tried to sell some of his hotel properties to raise Rs 10,000 crore for his bail bond. He remained in Tihar jail for more than two years, and was released on parole in May 2016 to attend the last rites of his deceased mother.\n\nOn 1 July 2018, the group revealed that majority of Rs 20,000 crore of Sahara's money (including the interest) which is with SEBI will be refunded back to Sahara India as the group had already made majority of the payments to its investors. The group also stated that SEBI will be directed to start the verification of the documents of Sahara's investors, which are already provided to them by Sahara India Pariwar. Despite the double payment for single liability, Sahara India has been continuously depositing money of around Rs 20,000 crore (including interest earned) in Sahara-Sebi account.\n\nThe Sahara Welfare Foundation, the social development unit of Sahara India Pariwar, runs social welfare projects. The company assisted the families of Indian soldiers killed in the Kargil war with a commitment of 500 million (US$10.65 million )\n\nIn 2013, Sahara contributed to the relief efforts in flood hit Uttarakhand region wherein one lakh bottles of drinking water, juice bottles and food packets along with candles and match boxes were said to be provided by them. There were 25 medical health unit vans equipped with doctors and free medicines made available and It was said by the group that, they will contribute to the rehabilitation program by constructing 10,000 pre-fabricated houses.\n\n\n\nthousands of consumer court cases are filed against sahara\n"}

His two older siblings were Ann and David Morley Trace.\n\nTrace was educated at Cranleigh School, a boarding independent school in the town of Cranleigh in Surrey, which he left early. \n\nAfter working as a farm labourer, he joined the British Army and trained at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst. Trace received a commission in the Royal Regiment of Artillery of the British Army in 1953. He was promoted to lieutenant in February 1955, but resigned his commission in September 1956. Trace then had a relatively undistinguished acting career – his greatest screen role being Charlton Heston's body double in \"Ben-Hur\" (1959).\n\nAt the age of 25, Trace was the first male presenter of \"Blue Peter\" from its first programme, broadcast on 16 October 1958, and stayed with the programme until 24 July 1967. According to the BBC, he gained the job as presenter because he bonded with producer John Hunter Blair over their shared love of model railways.\nDuring his time hosting \"Blue Peter\", he was also a regular presenter on the BBC Schools programme \"Signpost\" from 1961 to 1965.\n\nBy 1967, the \"Blue Peter\" production team were beginning to find Trace hard to deal with and were looking to replace him on the show, particularly when his wife divorced him for sleeping with another woman during a 1965 \"Blue Peter\" summer expedition to Norway. The couple had two children. Trace often threatened to resign and once the production team were happy that viewers had accepted John Noakes as a member of the team, Trace's next resignation was accepted.\n\nHe became a writer and production manager for a film company named Spectator which failed after two years, losing him his life savings. He was declared bankrupt in 1973, then returned to the BBC, first on local television in East Anglia and then on the network TV programme \"Nationwide\". In the 1970s, he worked as a presenter on BBC East's daily morning radio programme \"Roundabout East Anglia\", a regional opt-out from the \"Today\" programme on BBC Radio 4. He also appeared on local television as a presenter on BBC's early evening news programme \"Look East\".\n\nBy the mid-1970s, he had retired from the media, and briefly worked behind the bar of a pub near Norwich before becoming general manager of an engineering factory, where he lost two toes in an accident. On \"Blue Peter\"’s 20th anniversary in 1978 he appeared on the show and the factory shut for the day so that the workforce could watch his appearance. On the show, without warning anyone in advance, he announced that he wanted to give an Outstanding Endeavour Award. The award became an annual \"Blue Peter\" event. In the 1980s he worked in the press office of the Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Families Association (SSAFA). In the 1990s, he briefly returned to the BBC to guest on and later host the nostalgia series \"Are You Sitting Comfortably?\" on Radio 2.\n\nTrace died in 1992 from cancer of the oesophagus while living in Walthamstow. Valerie Singleton and Biddy Baxter visited Trace in hospital just days before his death.\n\nThe \"Oxford Dictionary of National Biography\" credits Trace with coining two phrases that have become prominent in British popular culture: the line \"And now for something completely different\", later taken up by, and usually attributed to, Monty Python, and \"Here's one I made earlier\", since adopted by nearly all subsequent presenters on \"Blue Peter\".\n\n"}

He was born in Vancouver, Washington. Simmons was a star pitcher at Burbank High School and Glendale College before enlisting in the U.S. Coast Guard. After World War II, he signed with the Philadelphia Phillies and pitched briefly in their minor league system.\n\nHis radio career began in Elko, Nevada, calling Elko High School football and basketball games on KELK. He first announced baseball for a semipro league in Marysville, California. After spending three years broadcasting Fresno State sports on KMJ, Simmons came to San Francisco in 1957 as the sports director at KSFO. That year, he was the color commentator for the San Francisco 49ers of the National Football League, teaming with play-by-play announcer Bob Fouts, the father of Pro Football Hall of Fame quarterback Dan Fouts.\n\nIn 1958, Simmons took over as play-by-play announcer on 49ers radio broadcasts, paired with former 49er Gordy Soltau. Years later, he worked with KSFO disc-jockey Gene Nelson and then with former NFL player and KPIX-TV sports director Wayne Walker. Also in 1958, he became the second announcer for the newly relocated San Francisco Giants of Major League Baseball, teaming with lead announcer Russ Hodges, who moved with the team from New York. To complement Hodges' \"Bye Bye Baby!\" home run call, Simmons created his own, \"Tell It Goodbye!\" When Hodges retired after the 1970 season (he died in April 1971), Simmons was promoted to lead announcer and teamed with Bill Thompson. This pairing lasted through the 1973 season. Al Michaels and Art Eckman became the Giants radio announcers on KSFO in 1974.\n\nSimmons' most famous call during his first stint with the 49ers came on October 25, 1964, when Minnesota Vikings defensive end Jim Marshall picked up a fumble by the 49ers' Billy Kilmer and ran it the wrong way, scoring a safety for the 49ers instead of a touchdown for the Vikings (who won the game anyway, by a score of 27-22). The transcript of his call, including his mid-sentence transition as the moment occurred, reads as:\n\nSimmons returned to the Giants in 1976 as second announcer behind Michaels, then was the lead announcer again in 1977 and 1978, teaming with San Francisco native Joe Angel. When KSFO lost the Giants radio rights to rival KNBR in 1979, Simmons and Angel were replaced by Lindsey Nelson and Hank Greenwald. Three years later in 1981, KSFO acquired the Oakland Athletics' radio rights. Simmons then became an A's announcer, along with longtime Oakland Raiders and San Francisco/Golden State Warriors voice Bill King and youngster Wayne Hagin. Simmons remained part of the A's radio team through the 1995 season. From 1996 to 2002, he called Giants games part-time on KNBR. With the 49ers, he remained as play-by-play announcer through the 1980 season. In 1981, KSFO lost the 49ers radio rights to KCBS, who replaced him with its own sports director, longtime Stanford University play-by-play announcer Don Klein.\n\nSimmons also served as the Warriors TV announcer on KTVU during the 1973–74 NBA season.\n\nDuring the final two games of the 1989 World Series, Athletics lead announcer Bill King came down with laryngitis. Simmons was thus able to announce to his radio audience that the A's had won the World Series over Simmons' former team, the Giants.\n\nDuring Simmons' first tenure as 49ers play-by-play announcer, the team never won an NFL championship. One year after his departure, San Francisco began a run of Super Bowl victories. When KGO acquired the 49ers radio rights in 1987, Simmons returned as the play-by-play announcer and was reunited with long-time colleague, Wayne Walker. During the 1988 regular season, Simmons' call of Steve Young's breathtaking game-winning 49-yard scramble against the Minnesota Vikings became as memorable as the play itself.\n\nThe following January, San Francisco won Super Bowl XXIII over the Cincinnati Bengals, 20-16. Simmons' call of the 49ers' Super Bowl game-winning drive (punctuated by a Joe Montana-to-John Taylor TD pass) can be heard on the NFL Films highlights package of the game. Simmons again departed from the 49ers — this time for good — during the 1989 preseason following a dispute with the KGO management. He was replaced in the play-by-play spot by Joe Starkey, the long-time announcer for the University of California Golden Bears and sideline reporter on 49ers games in 1987 and 1988; Starkey had taken over play-by-play on several October games during the 1988 season. Starkey retired from the position following the 2008 NFL season.\n\nSimmons served in the U.S. Coast Guard for 3-1/2 years during World War II. He initially served on a cutter in Hawaii mostly conducting submarine patrols. During the Battle of Saipan, he served on a landing ship, tank (LST-205) that landed troops and supplies as part of the invasion. Afterwards, he served in the Aleutian Islands until the end of the war.\n\nSimmons died on April 5, 2015 at his home in Daly City, California. Baseball Hall of Famer Willie Mays said at the time, \"Lon was like my big brother. Anybody who knew him knew he was very genuine. He'd always tell you the truth.

Also in 2006, he was inducted into the Glendale Community College Athletic Hall of Fame, along with his teammate, friend and broadcast partner, Bill Thompson. Simmons' trademark call for home runs, \"\"Tell it goodbye!,\"\" is quoted by John Fogerty in his song, \"Centerfield.\"\n\nIn May 2006, Simmons rejoined the San Francisco Giants as a fill-in broadcaster. He was hired back to be in the booth during four in-season trips to San Francisco from his home in Maui for the 2006 baseball season.\n\nThe Giants radio booth at Oracle Park is named after him and Hodges. Both are honored at the ball park with displays depicting a microphone and their names, alongside those of the Giants National Baseball Hall of Fame player inductees. After Simmon's death in April 2015 the San Francisco Giants wore a \"LON\" patch for the 2015 Season on their jerseys to honor their longtime broadcaster.\n\nSimmons provided voice samples for Sega's \"Sports Talk\" video game series, including \"Sports Talk Baseball\", \"\", \"NFL Sports Talk Football '93\", and \"NFL Football '94 Starring Joe Montana\". \"Joe Montana II: Sports Talk Football\" was the first video game ever to feature a full play-by-play running commentary.\n\n"}
{"id": "1896889", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1896889", "title": "Critical management studies", "text": "Critical management studies\n\nCritical management studies (CMS) is a loose but extensive grouping of theoretically informed critiques of management, business and organisation, grounded originally in a critical theory perspective. Today it encompasses a wide range of perspectives that are critical of traditional theories of management and the business schools that generate these theories.\n\nIt is generally accepted that CMS began with Mats Alvesson and Hugh Willmott's edited collection \"Critical Management Studies\" (1992). Critical Management Studies (CMS) initially brought together critical theory and post-structuralist writings, but has since developed in more diverse directions.\n\nA dominant narrative within CMS is that perhaps the most important development in its stimulation was the global expansion of business schools, an American invention, especially in Europe. Decreases in state funding, so the narrative has it, for social sciences and increases in funding for business schools during the 1980s resulted in many academics with graduate training in sociology, history, philosophy, psychology and other social sciences ending up with jobs \"training managers\".\n\nThese academics brought different theoretical tools and political perspectives into business schools. They began to question the politics of managerialism and to link the techniques of management to neo-liberalism. These new voices drew on the Frankfurt School of critical theory, and the work of Michel Foucault, Jacques Derrida and Gilles Deleuze. Later Feminism, queer theory, post-colonial theory, anarchism, ecological philosophies, and radical democratic theory also had some influence. (See Alvesson and Willmott 2003 for a survey of the field.)\n\nThe roots of CMS also came from a series of UK Labour Process Conferences that began in 1983 and reflected the impact of Braverman's (1974) attempt to make Marxist categories central to understanding work organisations. Industrial relations and labor studies scholars have joined the CMS fold in the US, seeking new opportunities for employment as labor-related programs have diminished in number.\n\nAt the same time a significant strand of critical accounting studies began to develop marked by the publication of Tony Tinker's \"Paper Prophets\" (1985) and the appearance of the journal \"Critical Perspectives on Accounting\".\n\nContrasting with the dominant origin narrative is an account which states that, along with the contributors to CMS from the intellectual traditions identified here, there is a significant - and overlapping - bloc among CMS scholars of those who have had extensive pre-University experience as workers and managers. The inconsistencies between their experiences in the workplace and the claims of mainstream managerialism, and an intention to connect those experiences to broader explanations and theorizing leads these people to CMS.\n\nThe main home of CMS has been in the organisation theory and behaviour parts of British, Australian and Scandinavian business schools, though there are strong contributions in related fields such as sociology, sociology of education, and critical pedagogy. Further, contributions stem from accounting with growing interest in other management specialisms, such as marketing, international business, operational research, logistics etc. Since the 1990s academics from North America and other parts of the world are also engaging with this body of writing and research. The CMS Division within the (American) Academy of Management (AoM), with a membership of around 800, is larger and more international than some of its other divisions.\n\nMany heterodox scholars in various parts of the world had been inspired by the international activities of the Standing Conference on Organisational Symbolism. This latter grouping developed work which drew variously on post-structuralism and symbolic interactionism in order to develop a cultural and anthropological understanding of contemporary organizations. Others, though, were without affiliation and/or seeking new formations and alliances. Since 1999, there has been a bi-annual CMS conference held in the UK as well as workshops and a bi-annual conference held at US Academy of Management.\n\nToday there are significant concentrations of CMS scholars in the UK at the School of Business and Management at Queen Mary, University of London, at the School of Management at the University of Leicester, the Essex Business School at the University of Essex, Alliance Manchester Business School at the University of Manchester, and the Marketing Research Group at Royal Holloway. Elsewhere, Copenhagen Business School, Lund School of Economics and Management at Lund University and Istanbul Bilgi University have clusters of CMS scholars, but many CMS scholars globally rely on conferences and journals like \"Tamara Journal for Critical Organization Studies\", \"ephemera: theory and politics in organization\", \"Culture and Organization\", or \"Organization: the critical journal of organization, theory and society\" for their affiliations.\n\nMajor points of debate have focused on CMS's relationship with more orthodox forms of Marxism, on the nature and purposes of CMS critique, on questions of inclusion and exclusion (Fournier and Grey 2000), on the possibilities of social transformation from within business schools (Parker 2002), and on the development of alternative models of globalisation.\n\nOne trend in CMS has seen the incorporation of autonomist Marxist theory, first introduced to the English-speaking world by the work of Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri (2000). New CMS scholars using these theories have interests in proposing alternative non-capitalist forms of organizing work and life - often built around the notion of collective responsibility for the commons. Other developments include engagements with post-colonial theory and critical race theory to investigate the way management and business schools contribute to what Cedric Robinson (1983) has called \"racial capitalism\". Recent critical works have referred to Bourdieusian theory (structuralist constructivism) to point to the risks of elitism and social inequality,\nparticularly in management education. Michael Loughlin of Manchester Metropolitan University has discussed aspects of management theory as \"pseudo-science\".\n\nWider impatience with market-managerial forms of organization occur commonly enough outside the business school, from anti-corporate protests to popular-media presentations of managers. CMS attempts to articulate these voices within the business school, and to provide ways of thinking beyond current dominant theories and practices of organizations.\n\n\n"}

This event was the catalyst for the Second Crusade.\n\nThe County of Edessa was the first of the crusader states to be established during and after the First Crusade. It dates from 1098 when Baldwin of Boulogne left the main army of the First Crusade and founded his own principality.\n\nEdessa was the most northerly, the weakest, and the least populated; as such, it was subject to frequent attacks from the surrounding Muslim states ruled by the Ortoqids, Danishmends, and Seljuk Turks. Count Baldwin II and future count Joscelin of Courtenay were taken captive after their defeat at the Battle of Harran in 1104. Joscelin was captured a second time in 1122, and although Edessa recovered somewhat after the Battle of Azaz in 1125, Joscelin was killed in battle in 1131. His successor Joscelin II was forced into an alliance with the Byzantine Empire, but in 1143 both the Byzantine emperor John II Comnenus and the King of Jerusalem Fulk of Anjou died. John II was succeeded by his son Manuel I Comnenus, who had to deal with consolidating power at home against his elder brothers, while Fulk was succeeded by his wife Melisende and his son Baldwin III. Joscelin had also quarreled with Raymond II of Tripoli and Raymond of Antioch, leaving Edessa with no powerful allies.\n\nIn 1144, Joscelin was able to make an alliance with Kara Arslan, the Ortoqid ruler of Diyarbakır, against the growing power and influence of Zengi. Joscelin marched out of Edessa with almost his entire army to support Kara Aslan against Aleppo. Zengi, already seeking to take advantage of Fulk's death in 1143, hurried north to besiege Edessa, arriving on November 28. The city had been warned of his arrival and was prepared for a siege, but there was little they could do while Joscelin and the army were elsewhere.\n\nThe defense of the city was led by the Latin Archbishop Hugh, the Armenian Bishop John, and the Jacobite Bishop Basil. John and Basil ensured that none of the native Christians would desert to Zengi. When Joscelin heard of the siege he took the army to Turbessel, knowing that he could never dislodge Zengi without help from the other crusader states. In Jerusalem, Queen Melisende responded to Joscelin's appeal by sending an army led by Manasses of Hierges, Philip of Milly, and Elinand of Bures. Raymond of Antioch ignored the call for help, as his army was already occupied against the Byzantine Empire in Cilicia.\n\nZengi surrounded the entire city, realizing that there was no army defending it. He built siege engines and began to mine the walls, while his forces were joined by Kurdish and Turcoman reinforcements. The inhabitants of Edessa resisted as much as they could, but had no experience in siege warfare; the city’s numerous towers remained unmanned. They also had no knowledge of counter-mining, and part of the wall near the Gate of the Hours collapsed on December 24. Zengi's troops rushed into the city, killing all those who were unable to flee to the Citadel of Maniaces. Thousands more were suffocated or trampled to death in the panic, including Archbishop Hugh. Zengi ordered his men to stop the massacre, although all the Latin prisoners that he had taken were executed; the native Christians were allowed to live freely. The citadel was handed over on December 26. One of Zengi’s commanders, Zayn ad-Din Ali Kutchuk, was appointed governor, while Bishop Basil, apparently willing to give his loyalty to whoever ruled the city, was recognized as leader of the Christian population.\n\nIn January 1145 Zengi captured Saruj and besieged Birejik, but the army of Jerusalem had finally arrived and joined with Joscelin. Zengi also heard of trouble in Mosul, and rushed back to take control. There, he was praised throughout Islam as \"defender of the faith\" and \"al-Malik al-Mansur\", the victorious king. He did not pursue an attack on the remaining territory of Edessa, or the Principality of Antioch, as was feared. Joscelin II continued to rule the remnants of the county to the west of the Euphrates from Turbessel, but little by little the rest of the territory was captured by the Muslims or sold to the Byzantines.\n\nZengi was assassinated by a slave in 1146 while besieging Qalat Jabar, and was succeeded in Aleppo by his son Nur ad-Din. Joscelin attempted to take back Edessa following Zengi's murder, and recaptured all but the citadel in October 1146. However, he had no help from the other crusader states, and his poorly planned expedition was driven out of Edessa by Nur ad-Din in November. Joscelin, fearing for the safety of the city's Christian Armenians, attempted to break a hole in Nur ad-Din's forces through which the natives could flee to safety. However, Joscelin's attempt failed and his fears came true when Nur al-Din's troops massacred the fleeing Armenians and forced the survivors into slavery. \n\nBy this time, news of the fall of Edessa reached Europe, and Raymond of Antioch had already sent a delegation including Hugh, Bishop of Jabala, to seek aid from Pope Eugene III. On December 1, 1145 Eugene issued the papal bull \"Quantum praedecessores\" calling for the Second Crusade. This crusade was led by Louis VII of France and Conrad III of Germany, but by 1148 it had ended in disaster, and Edessa was never recovered.\n\n"}

{"id": "1896897", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1896897", "title": "Contactee", "text": "Contactee\n\nContactees are persons who claim to have experienced contact with extraterrestrials. Some claimed ongoing encounters, while others claimed to have had as few as a single encounter. Evidence is anecdotal in all cases.\n\nAs a cultural phenomenon, contactees perhaps had their greatest notoriety from the late 1940s to the late 1950s, but individuals continue to make similar claims in the present. Some have shared their messages with small groups of followers, and many have issued newsletters or spoken at UFO conventions.\n\nThe contactee movement has seen serious attention from academics and mainstream scholars. Among the earliest was the classic 1956 study, \"When Prophecy Fails\" by Leon Festinger, Henry Riecken, and Stanley Schachter, which analyzed the phenomenon. There have been at least two university-level anthologies of scientific papers regarding the contactee movements.\n\nContactee accounts are generally different from those who allege alien abduction, in that while contactees usually describe beneficial experiences involving human-like aliens, abductees rarely describe their experiences positively.\n\nAstronomer J. Allen Hynek described contactees as asserting that:\n\"the visitation to the earth of generally benign beings whose ostensible purpose is to communicate (generally to a relatively few selected and favored persons) messages of 'cosmic importance'. These chosen recipients generally have repeated contact experiences, involving additional messages . . .\"\n\nContactees became a cultural phenomenon in the 1940s and continued throughout the 1950s and 1960s, often giving lectures and writing books about their experience. The phenomenon still exists today. Skeptics often hold that such \"contactees\" are deluded or dishonest in their claims. Susan Clancy wrote that such claims are \"false memories\" concocted out of a \"blend of fantasy-proneness, memory distortion, culturally available scripts, sleep hallucinations, and scientific illiteracy\".\n\nContactees usually portrayed \"Space Brothers\" as more or less identical in appearance and mannerisms to humans. The Brothers are also almost invariably reported as disturbed by the violence, crime, and wars that infest the earth, and by the possession of various earth nations of nuclear and thermonuclear weapons.\nCurtis Peebles summarizes the common features of many contactee claims:\n\n\nThough the word \"contactee\" was not in common use until the 1950s, the authors of the anthologies noted in \"sources\" below use the term to describe persons whose claims occurred centuries before the UFO era, attempting to depict them as a part of the same tradition.\n\nThough not linked to flying saucers or odd aerial lights, it is perhaps worth noting that there is a long history of claims of contact with non-earthly intelligences. The founding revelations of many of the world's religions involve contact between the founder and a supernatural source of wisdom, such as a deity in human form or an angel. In this context, one might expect that most of the 1950s contactees would form their own religions, with the contactee as sole spiritual leader, and that is precisely what happened, almost invariably.\n\nAs early as the 18th century, people like Emanuel Swedenborg were claiming to be in psychic contact with inhabitants of other planets. 1758 saw the publication of \"Concerning Earths in the Solar System\", in which Swedenborg detailed his alleged journeys to the inhabited planets. J. Gordon Melton notes that Swedenborg's planetary tour stops at Saturn, the furthest planet known during Swedenborg's era—he did not visit Uranus, Neptune or Pluto.\n\nLater, Helena Blavatsky would make claims similar to Swedenborg's.\n\nIn 1891, Thomas Blott's book \"The Man From Mars\" was published. The author claimed to have met a Martian in Kentucky. Unusually for an early contactee, Blott reported that the Martian communicated not via telepathy, but in English.\n\nAnother early contactee book, of sorts, was \"From India To The Planet Mars\" (1900) by Theodore Flournoy. Flournoy detailed the claims of Helene Smith, who, whilst in a trance, dictated information gleaned from her psychic visits to the planet Mars—including a Martian alphabet and language she could write and speak. Flournoy determined that Smith's claims were spurious, based on fantasy and imagination. Her \"Martian\" language was simply a garbled version of French.\n\nTwo of the earliest contactees in the modern sense were William Magoon and Guy Ballard (the latter a follower of Madame Blavatsky).\n\nMagoon's book \"William Magoon: Psychic and Healer\" was published in 1930. He claimed that, in the early 20th century, he had been unexpectedly and instantaneously transported to Mars. The planet was essentially earth-like, with cities and wilderness. The inhabitants had radio and automobiles. Though they were invisible, Magoon sensed their presences.\n\nThough Magoon was obscure, Ballard would have more impact via the I Am movement he established. In 1935, Ballard claimed that, several years earlier, he and over 100 others witnessed the appearance of 12 Venusians in a cavern beneath Mount Shasta. The Venusians played music for the audience, said Ballard, then showed the crowd a large mirror-like device that displayed images of life on Venus. The Venusians then allegedly reported that the earth would suffer through an era of tension and warfare, followed by worldwide peace and goodwill.\n\nGeorge Adamski, who later became probably the most prominent contactee of the UFO era, was one contactee with an earlier interest in the occult. Adamski founded the Royal Order of Tibet in the 1930s. Writes Michael Barkun, \"His [later] messages from the Venusians sounded suspiciously like his own earlier occult teachings.\"\n\nChristopher Partridge notes, importantly, that the pre-1947 contactees \"do not involve UFOs\". Rather, he suggests that an existing tradition of extraterrestrial contact via seances and psychic means promptly incorporated the flying-saucer mythos when it arrived.\n\nThe 1947 report of Kenneth Arnold sparked widespread interest in flying saucers, and before long, many people were claiming to have been in contact with flying saucer inhabitants.\n\nThere was a nearly-continuous series of contactees, beginning with George Adamski in 1952. Radio host John Nebel interviewed many contactees on his program during this era. The stereotypical contactee account in these days involved not just conversations with friendly, humanoid spacemen, but also tours inside their flying saucers, and rides to large \"Mother Ships\" in Earth orbit, and even jaunts to the Moon, Mars, Venus, Jupiter and Saturn.\n\nIn support of their claims, early 1950s contactees often produced photographs of the alleged flying saucers or their occupants. A number of photos of a \"Venusian scout ship\" by George Adamski and identified by him as a typical extraterrestrial flying saucer were noted to suspiciously bear a remarkable resemblance to a type of once commonly available chicken egg incubator, complete with three light bulbs which Adamski said were \"landing gear\".\n\nFor over two decades, contactee George Van Tassel hosted the annual \"Giant Rock Interplanetary Spacecraft Convention\" in the Mojave Desert. Another 1950s contactee, Buck Nelson, held a similar convention in the Ozarks of Missouri up until 1965.\n\nEven in ufology—itself subject to at best very limited and sporadic mainstream scientific or academic interest—contactees were generally seen as the lunatic fringe, and \"serious\" ufologists subsequently avoided the subject, for fear it would harm their attempts at \"serious\" study of the UFO phenomenon. Jacques Vallée notes, \"No serious investigator has ever been very worried by the claims of the 'contactees'.\"\n\nCarl Sagan has expressed skepticism about contactees and alien contact in general, remarking that aliens seem very happy to answer vague questions but when confronted with specific, technical questions they are silent:\n\nOccasionally, by the way, I get a letter from someone who is in \"contact\" with an extraterrestrial who invites me to \"ask anything\". And so I have a list of questions. The extraterrestrials are very advanced, remember. So I ask things like, \"Please give a short proof of Fermat's Last Theorem.\" Or the Goldbach Conjecture. And then I have to explain what these are, because extraterrestrials will not call it Fermat's Last Theorem, so I write out the little equation with the exponents. I never get an answer. On the other hand, if I ask something like \"Should we humans be good?\" I always get an answer. I think something can be deduced from this differential ability to answer questions. Anything vague they are extremely happy to respond to, but anything specific, where there is a chance to find out if they actually know anything, there is only silence.\n\nSome time after the phenomenon had waned, Temple University historian David M. Jacobs noted a few interesting facts: the accounts of the prominent contactees grew ever more elaborate, and as new claimants gained notoriety, they typically backdated their first encounter, claiming it occurred earlier than anyone else's. Jacobs speculates that this was an attempt to gain a degree of \"authenticity\" to trump other contactees.\n\nThose who claim to be contactees include:\n\n\n"}

Grammer would become a regular performer on the Grand Ole Opry, eventually designing, and marketing his namesake guitar after co-founding a guitar company, in Nashville, Tennessee.\n\nGrammer, the eldest of 13 children (nine boys and four girls), was born in Benton, Illinois. His father was a musician; he played the violin and trumpet.\n\nHe served in the US Army during World War II, and upon discharge worked as an apprentice toolmaker at the Washington Naval gun factory at Shop No. 20. Grammer married his high school girlfriend, Ruth Burzynski, in 1944. Shortly after the war ended, 18,000 of a 24,000-strong workforce were laid off, including Grammer.

The song peaked at No. 4 on the U.S. Pop Singles chart and No. 5 on the Hot Country Songs chart in 1959. That same year, he became a regular cast member on the Grand Ole Opry. Grammer named his band after his most notable hit as The Travel On Boys. \"Gotta Travel On\" was used as the opening song by Buddy Holly on his final tour in January and February 1959, which ended in tragedy. He recorded the first chart version of Bobby Bare's \"Detroit City\", entitled \"I Wanna Go Home\". It hit the \"Billboard\" country chart in early 1963.\n\nGrammer founded RG&G (Reid, Grammer & Gower) Company in 1965 with Clyde Reid and J.W. Gower. RG&G made the Grammer guitar from 1965 until 1968, when a fire consumed the factory in downtown Nashville. The company was then sold to Ampeg, and a new factory was erected down the street from the old one. The company was renamed Grammer Guitar, Inc. (GGI). GGI produced the Grammer guitar until 1970. His guitar was installed into the Country Music Hall of Fame in Nashville on March 1, 1969.\n\nOn May 15, 1972, Grammer and the Travel on Boys played at the rally in Laurel, Maryland where Alabama governor George Wallace was shot. Grammer and his band played the \"Under the Double Eagle\" march as Wallace mounted the stage to speak. After he spoke, Wallace mingled with the crowd, and Arthur Bremer shot a concealed handgun at the presidential candidate. The outcome was Wallace's paralysis, leaving him using a wheelchair for the rest of his life. \"I've said all along, if they wanted to do something like this, they do it under these circumstances,\" Grammer said, weeping, after the incident.\n\nGrammer delivered the invocation for the Grand Ole Opry House opening on March 16, 1974. In 1990, he was inducted into the Illinois Country Music Hall of Fame, along with Tex Williams, Lulu Belle and Scotty, and Patsy Montana.\n\nGrammer suffered from the degenerative eye disease retinitis pigmentosa and became completely blind. On February 27, 2009, he was honored by the Grand Ole Opry for his 50-year membership.\n\nGrammer died on August 10, 2011, aged 85, at Benton Hospital, where he had been receiving treatment for a long-term illness, which included suffering a heart attack seven months earlier.\n\n"}

From 1974 to 1998 he was the editor of the magazine \"The American Scholar\".\n\nEpstein was born in Chicago, Illinois in 1937. He graduated from Senn High School and attended the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign. He received a Bachelor of Arts from the University of Chicago and served in the U.S. Army from 1958 to 1960. From 1972 to 2002, he was a lecturer in English and Writing at Northwestern University and is an Emeritus Lecturer of English there.\n\nFrom 1974 to 1998 he served as editor of \"The American Scholar\" and wrote for it under the pseudonym Aristides. He edited \"The Best American Essays\" (1993), the \"Norton Book of Personal Essays\" (1997), and \"Literary Genius: 25 Classic Writers Who Define English & American Literature\" (2007). His work has appeared in \"The Atlantic\", \"Commentary\", \"Harper's\", \"The New Criterion\", \"The New Republic\", \"The New York Times Book Review\", \"The New Yorker\", \"The Wall Street Journal\", \"The Weekly Standard, and First Things\". His short stories were included in \"The Best American Short Stories 2007\" and \"The Best American Short Stories 2009\". In 2003, he was awarded a National Humanities Medal by the National Endowment for the Humanities.\n\nEpstein's removal as editor of \"The American Scholar\" in 1998 (following a 1996 vote of the Phi Beta Kappa senate) was controversial. Epstein later said that he was fired \"for being insufficiently correct politically\". Some within Phi Beta Kappa attributed the senate's decision to a desire to attract a younger readership for the journal.\n\nEpstein's essay \"Who Killed Poetry?\", published in \"Commentary\" in 1988, generated discussion in the literary community decades after its publication.\n\nIn September 1970, \"Harper's Magazine\" published an article by Epstein called \"Homo/Hetero: The Struggle for Sexual Identity\" that was criticized for its perceived homophobia. Epstein wrote that he considered homosexuality \"a curse, in a literal sense\" and that his sons could do nothing to make him sadder than \"if any of them were to become homosexual.\" Gay activists characterized the essay as portraying every gay man the author met, or fantasized about meeting, as predatory, sex-obsessed, and a threat to civilization. In the essay, he says that, if possible, \"I would wish homosexuality off the face of the earth\", a statement that was interpreted by gay writer and editor Merle Miller as a call to genocide. A sit-in took place at \"Harper's\" by members of the Gay Activists Alliance.\n\nIn 2015 Epstein wrote an article for \"The Washington Examiner\" in which he mentioned the \"Harper's\" article from 1970. He wrote, \"I am pleased the tolerance for homosexuality has widened in America and elsewhere, that in some respects my own aesthetic sensibility favors much homosexual artistic production... My only hope now is that, on my gravestone, the words Noted Homophobe aren’t carved.\"\n\nWilliam F. Buckley Jr., in his review of \"Snobbery: The American Version\", called Epstein \"perhaps the wittiest writer (working in his genre) alive, the funniest since Randall Jarrell.\" A writer for \"The Forward\" called him \"perhaps the smartest American alive who also writes well.\"\n\nEpstein invented the word \"virtucrat\" and first used it in an article for \"The New York Times Magazine\". He defined a virtucrat as \"any man or woman who is certain that his or her political views are not merely correct but deeply, morally righteous in the bargain.\" In his 2016 essay collection \"Wind Sprints\", he defines it as a person \"whose politics lend them the fine sense of elation that only false virtue makes possible.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1896971", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1896971", "title": "Heinrich Neuhaus", "text": "Heinrich Neuhaus\n\nHeinrich Gustaw Neuhaus (, , Genrikh Gustavovič Nejgauz, 10 October 1964) was a Ukrainian-born pianist and teacher of German and Polish extraction. Part of a musical dynasty, he grew up in a Polish-speaking household. He taught at the Moscow Conservatory from 1922 to 1964. He was made a People's Artist of the RSFSR in 1956. His piano textbook \"The Art of Piano Playing\" (1958) is regarded as one of the most authoritative and widely used approaches to the subject. \nNeuhaus was born in Elisavetgrad, then part of the Russian Empire, known since 2016 as, Kropyvnytskyi, in present-day Ukraine. Although both his parents were piano teachers, he was largely self-taught. A major influence on his early artistic development came from his neighbour and cousin through his mother, Olga, \"Marta\" née Blumenfeld, Karol Szymanowski. He himself was tutored by Heinrich's father, Gustaw Neuhaus. Another strong influence was his uncle, Felix Blumenfeld on the latter's visits to his sisters' home in the locality. He also received lessons from Aleksander Michałowski. At the age of eleven, Neuhaus made his first public appearance, performing an impromptu and some waltzes by Frédéric Chopin. In 1902 he gave a recital in Elisavetgrad with the 11-year-old Mischa Elman and in 1904 gave concerts in Dortmund, Bonn, Cologne and Berlin. Subsequently, he studied with Leopold Godowsky in Berlin and from 1909 until the outbreak of World War I took part in his master classes at the Vienna Academy of Music. \n\nIn 1912, Neuhaus attended a concert in Berlin in which Arthur Rubinstein premiered Szymanowski's Piano \"Sonata No. 2\", and left a suicide note saying that the concert had made clear to him that he would never be successful as a composer or a pianist and that he could not go on living, and was going to Florence in Italy to die. Szymanowski and Rubinstein hastily followed Neuhaus to Florence and tracked him down to a hospital, where he was safe and recovering after cutting his wrist in a hotel.\n\nIn 1914 Neuhaus started teaching in Elisavetgrad and later Tbilisi and Kiev where he befriended Vladimir Horowitz. After a temporary paralysis, Neuhaus was forced to halt his concert career and turned to teaching instead. In 1922 he began teaching at the Moscow Conservatory where he helped to create the famous \"Moscow Central Music School\" for gifted children in 1932. In addition, he also served as director of the Moscow Conservatory between 1934 and 1937. When the Germans approached Moscow in 1941, he was imprisoned on suspicion of being a German spy, but released eight months later under pressure from Dmitri Shostakovich, Emil Gilels and others. His pupils there included, Yakov Zak, Sviatoslav Richter, Emil Gilels, Victor Eresko, Anatoly Vedernikov, Tikhon Khrennikov, Galina Melikhova, Yevgeny Malinin, Lev Naumov, Tamara Guseva, Margarita Fyodorova, Ryszard Bakst, Teodor Gutman, Vera Gornostayeva, Alexander Slobodyanik, Leonid Brumberg, Igor Zhukov, Oleg Boshniakovich, Anton Ginsburg, Valery Kastelsky, Gérard Frémy, Zdeněk Hnát, Eliso Virsaladze, Alexei Lubimov, Aleksey Nasedkin, Vladimir Krainev, Berta Maranz, Evgeny Mogilevsky, Amalya Baiburtyan, Radu Lupu, Valentina Kameníková, Victor Derevianko, Vera Razumovskaya, Nina Svetlanova, Boris Petrushansky and Yuri Krechkovsky.\n\nNeuhaus died in Moscow on 10 October 1964.\n\nNeuhaus was renowned for the poetic magnetism of his playing and for his artistic refinement. He was a lifelong friend of Boris Pasternak, and Osip Mandelstam expressed his admiration for Neuhaus's playing in a poem. Stanislav Neuhaus, Heinrich's son by his first wife Zinaida, who later married Pasternak in 1931, was also a noted pianist. Stanislav Bunin is his grandson.\n\n"}
{"id": "1896973", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1896973", "title": "RheinEnergieStadion", "text": "RheinEnergieStadion\n\nThe RheinEnergieStadion (), officially written as RheinEnergieSTADION, is a German football stadium in Cologne. It was built on the site of the two previous Müngersdorfer stadiums. It is the home of the local Bundesliga team, 1. FC Köln. The stadium was one of 5 stadiums hosting both the 2005 FIFA Confederations Cup and 2006 FIFA World Cup. Local energy company RheinEnergie AG currently holds the naming rights to the stadium.\n\nUnder the terms of the Treaty of Versailles (1919), the fortifications of Cologne were removed, thus allowing for the building of a new structure in the surrounding area. The new construction enabled the city to create 15,000 jobs. The new stadium was called the Müngersdorfer Stadion. This allowed Cologne not only to help stabilize the country but also to gain prestige and economic benefits for the city. The cost was tallied at 47.4 million Deutsche Mark.\n\nFollowing the completion of the stadium the city began to gain prominence in the domestic sports world. Many major football matches were held at the stadium in front of huge crowds. The first international match was held on 20 November 1927, when the German national football team drew 2–2 with the Netherlands. Since then, the German team has played 19 times at the stadium, and only one of those matches resulted in a loss. Another notable match was the first post-war game, which saw 1. FC Nürnberg beat 1. FC Kaiserslautern 2–1, in front of a crowd of 75,000.\n\nOne of the specialties of the Müngersdorfer Stadion was the track meets for non-professional sportsmen. In 1929 there were over 38,000 participants. However, in 1933 Jews were no longer allowed to take part. After the war the stadium has only hosted professional level sports.\n\nIn 2005, the stadium was a venue for three first-round games of the FIFA Confederations Cup, including the opening match between Argentina and Tunisia. The game was won by Argentina 2–1.\n\nThe Müngersdorfer has been host to many important UEFA Cup matches. Bayer Leverkusen played against Barcelona, and Galatasaray against AS Monaco in the 1988–89 European Cup. Borussia Mönchengladbach played both Arsenal and AS Monaco in the 1996–97 UEFA Cup. The stadium also functioned as the home ground to second-tier Alemannia Aachen in their 2004–05 UEFA Cup campaign.\n\nIn July 2004, the RheinEnergieStadion was awarded a bronze medal for distinguished sporting and leisure facilities by the International Olympic Committee.\n\nThere have been two renovations, first from 1972 to 1975 and once more from 2002 to 2004.\n\nIn 1974, the World Cup was held in West Germany, and Cologne had wanted to be a host city. The city's bid was approved and it soon began work on a new stadium that was to replace the now outdated Müngersdorfer Stadion. However, the city was unable to raise the money needed for a stadium of the desired size. The original plan was for an 80,000-seat arena, which was planned to have cost 23.5 million Deutsche Mark. But the total kept growing. In the end, if the stadium had been completed, the cost would have amounted to 93.5 million. At the time, the city was able to provide only an extra 6 million Deutsche Mark.\n\nFollowing the World Cup, Cologne still wanted the stadium completed. Hence, on 12 November 1975, a 61,000-seat arena was inaugurated with a match between 1. FC Köln and SC Fortuna Köln, 1. FC Köln winning 1–0.\n\nWith the news of the prospect of bringing the World Cup back to Germany, the city reacted and started renovation of the stadium, which was completed in 2003. Unlike previous configurations, there are no track-and-field facilities, allowing spectators to be much closer to the pitch than they might have been in a traditional continental multi-purpose stadium. Thus, the stadium was designed like English-style football stadia, e.g., Anfield, Stamford Bridge, Villa Park and White Hart Lane, with spectators almost on top of the pitch and players.\n\nThe capacity is about 50,000 people during club matches and 45,965 for international games, when terracing is not allowed. The entire field is lit with a floodlight system. In the north grandstand there is a museum dedicated to 1. FC Köln.\n\nThe stadium was one of the venues for the 2006 FIFA World Cup. However, due to sponsorship contracts, the arena was called \"FIFA World Cup Stadium Cologne\" during the World Cup.\n\nThe following games were played at the stadium during the World Cup of 2006:\n\nThe stadion is part of Sportpark Müngersdorf, adjacent to Aachener Straße. It is accessible by car via the Cologne Beltway, only some 1200 m off the Bundesautobahn 1. \"RheinEnergieStadion\" is a KVB light rail station of Cologne Stadtbahn.\n\nQueen performed at the stadium on the 19th of July 1986 during their european Magic Tour.\n\nMichael Jackson performed at the stadium three times. The first was on 3 July 1988 during the Bad World Tour, the second on July 11th 1992 during the Dangerous World Tour and the third was on 3 June 1997 during the History World Tour. The singer performed for over 150 000 fans at this stadium.\n\nPink Floyd played at the stadium two times. The first was on 18 June 1989 as part of their A Momentary Lapse of Reason Tour, the second was on 2 August 1994 as part of their The Division Bell Tour.\n\nThe Rolling Stones played a concert at the venue on 4–5 July 1982 on The Rolling Stones European Tour 1982. The band played with Peter Maffey and also the J. Geils Band.\n\nAmerican hard rock band Guns N’ Roses played at the stadium in both May 1992 and June 1993 during its two and a half year long Use Your Illusion Tour.\n\nTina Turner played a sold-out (60,288 / 60,288) concert at the stadium on 28 July 2000 as part of her Twenty Four Seven Tour.\n\nBon Jovi performed at the stadium on June 20th 2001 during the One Wild Night Tour and on June 23rd 2013 as part of the Because We Can Tour.\n\nAC/DC performed at the venue on July 8th 2001 during the Stiff Upper Lip World Tour and on May 19th 2009 as part of the Black Ice World Tour.\n\nThe pop rock singer P!nk performed on May 29th 2010 during her Funhouse Summer Carnival.\n\nBruce Springsteen performed on May 27th 2012 during his Wrecking Ball World Tour in front of a sold out crowd of 40,417 fans.\n\nColdplay played a concert at the stadium on September 4th 2012 as part of their Mylo Xyloto Tour.\n\nGerman Rock Band Unheilig performed their final concert at the stadium on September 10th 2016.\n\nRihanna performed here on 28 July 2016 for her Anti World Tour.\n\n"}

It is the southernmost point of land in Canada, located at 41°41'N, 82°41\"W (41.685,-82.684), or about 41.7 degrees north latitude. It lies in Lake Erie, just south of Pelee Island, and is part of Point Pelee National Park. It forms part of the province of Ontario. The southernmost part of the island lies some from the U.S. maritime boundary. The distance to the northernmost point of land in Canada—Cape Columbia, Ellesmere Island—is .\n\nThe southernmost point of Middle Island is at a latitude of North 41°40'53\", which is at a slightly lower latitude than the southernmost point in Michigan and slightly farther south than downtown Chicago. Twenty-seven U.S. states lie fully or partly north of this point, as do European cities such as Rome and Barcelona and Asian cities such as Sapporo. Thirteen states are entirely north of this latitude (Alaska, Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine). California, Nevada, and Utah, albeit only their northernmost edge, are amongst the states that lie partially north of Middle Island, as their northern border is at the 42nd parallel north.\n\nThere are no permanent settlements on Middle Island, as the entire island is a conservation area. The most common species are double-crested cormorants, though several others also nest there. The birds are so plentiful that in May 2008, Parks Canada attempted to cull the number of cormorants from more than 4,000 nests to between 400 and 800. It once was the site of a lighthouse, built in 1872 but which fell into disuse by 1918.\n\nThe pyramidal square tower burned sometime afterward, but its stone foundation is visible. Located in Canadian waters, and hence indisputably under Canadian sovereignty, the island was privately owned for years by various U.S. owners. Subsequently, Middle Island was purchased in 1999 by the Nature Conservancy of Canada, and then donated to the Canadian national park system on September 6, 2000.\n\nArchaeological evidence from a study done in 1982 suggests human occupation dating from 1000–1500 A.D., with one site containing remains that may date to 500 B.C. Others claim that the island has seen inhabitation for more than 10,000 years. Despite early rumours of burial mounds, none were found.\n\nThe island is part of an archipelago across western Lake Erie, providing a natural migratory corridor for birds and other animals. It has also seen human migrations, mainly from the U.S. northward in the 19th century, including escaped slaves, prisoners of war and army deserters from the U.S. Civil War seeking asylum in mainland Ontario.\n\nThroughout the later decades of the 19th century, parts of Middle Island were used for growing grapes to be used in the production of wine, as was being done on Pelee Island.\n\nDuring Prohibition, the island was a way station for alcohol en route to the United States on the south shore of Lake Erie. Gangster Joe Roscoe acquired part of the island and built a seven-bedroom \"clubhouse\" that became the centre of rum-running activity. The hotel offered electricity, fireplaces, and a large screened-in porch with views of the lake. The basement held a casino, carved out of solid bedrock.\n\nIn the years after 1933, after the ratification of the Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution resulted in the repeal of the \"Volstead Act\", the hotel drew as many as 200 visitors a day in peak season. Its kitchen became known for pheasant dinners.\n\nLikely prior to the 1950s, there was an airstrip of about 275 metres (900 feet) in length. The runway began and ended in water, and is now choked with vegetation.\n\nThere was at one time a stately mansion on the island, rumoured to be a brothel some time after Prohibition. Only a remnant of the foundation remains.\n\nWhen purchased in 1999 by the Nature Conservancy of Canada, the island had no physical improvements and had essentially become a nature preserve over the last ten years, hosting the occasional scientific visit, and curious boaters. Although part of Point Pelee National Park, Middle Island is not officially open to visitors.\n\nInterest in preserving the island prompted a 1982 study by Parks Canada, which recommended naming it a national natural landmark. Its ecological, historical, and aesthetic value led Essex County to include it on its list of Environmentally Sensitive Areas and an Area of Natural and Scientific Interest. A conservation group, Carolinian Canada Coalition, named Middle Island one of 38 critical unprotected sites in its effort to preserve remnants of Ontario's southern forests.\n\n"}

He was executed by the Germans.\n\nJoseph Epstein was born in Zamość, Congress Poland. He studied law at Warsaw University. There he became aware of the Communist Party of Poland, and later he joined it.\nIn 1931, he was arrested by the police after speaking at a communist rally, but he was released after a few weeks. He fled to Czechoslovakia, where he sought asylum, but his plea was rejected. Epstein returned to Poland, only long enough to be deported by the authorities.\n\nIn Tours (France), where he organized immigrant laborers, Epstein met and married Paula Grynfeld, a Jewish pharmacy student from the city of Łódź in Poland. When the French police were informed by the Polish consulate about his participation in the Communist Party, Epstein was arrested and forced to leave Tours. He and his wife traveled to Bordeaux, where they continued their studies. He organized students into a collective, and he was appointed to the regional committee of the French Communist Party.\n\nIn 1933, they moved to Paris. The following year, Epstein passed his final examination, and he completed his law degree; however, he was barred from practicing law because he was not French.\n\nIn 1936, Epstein joined the Republican side in the Spanish Civil War and took part in the defence of Irun where he was severely wounded. In January 1938, he commanded the Romanian communists' artillery battery \"\"Tudor Vladimirescu\"\". On returning to France at the end of 1938, he was imprisoned at Gurs, a detention camp for political refugees and members of the International Brigades.\n\nIn 1939, he entered the ranks of the Polish Army, but later resigned and joined the French Foreign Legion. In 1940, he was captured by the Germans and sent to the Stalag IVB prisoner-of-war camp. Epstein escaped from the camp and went to Switzerland, but was deported to Germany. He managed to obtain false papers on the name of Joseph Duffau and moved to Paris.\n\nIn 1941, he began working with Francs-Tireurs et Partisans (FTP), a communist resistance group; by February 1943, he was an operation commander in the Paris region.\n\nHe proposed a new guerrilla warfare tactic. Up till this point, the FTP had been operating in three-person cells: one person attacked and two provided covering fire for their escape. He proposed that the teams should have 10 to 15 fighters. Three or four would throw grenades or bombs, and the rest would cover their withdrawal.\n\nThe FTP knew that a formation of Wehrmacht soldiers would take part in a parade in a street leading to place de l'Étoile. Epstein's group decided to attack with twelve men. Three of them would attack with grenades while the other nine would secure their withdrawal. Dozens of soldiers were killed or wounded but only one partisan was wounded. German officers reported that their soldiers were attacked by about a hundred guerillas.\n\nIn late 1943, the FTP was betrayed, possibly by Joseph Davidovitch, who was a chief of personnel in Missak Manouchian's group. Davidovitch had been arrested by the Gestapo and then released. He claimed, however, that he had escaped.\n\nOn October 16, 1943, Epstein was arrested in Évry-Petit-Bourg during a meeting with Manouchian. He was tortured in Fresnes prison and tried along with nineteen other members of the FTP and sentenced to death. He was executed by firing squad.\n\n"}

Inspired by American singer Madonna's acclaimed 1998 album \"Ray of Light\", Chisholm and her team recruited several of the album's producers to work with her, including William Orbit, Rick Nowels, Marius de Vries, and Craig Armstrong, as well as Rick Rubin. Chisholm co-wrote every song on \"Northern Star\"s track listing.\n\nThe album's sound is diverse, combining pop music with elements of rock, dance, electronica, trance, techno-rock and R&B which contrasted with the sound of the Spice Girls. AllMusic describes \"Northern Star\" as a \"genre-hopping\" album. Commercially, the album peaked at number one on the Swedish Albums Chart and entered the top ten in several countries including Denmark, Finland, Germany, Ireland, the Netherland, and Norway. In the United Kingdom, \"Northern Star\" reached number four on the UK Albums Chart and went on the sell almost 900,000 copies. With worldwide sales close to four million copies, it is the biggest-selling solo Spice Girl album. The album was re-issued on 21 August 2000 to feature the single mixes of \"Never Be the Same Again\" and \"I Turn to You\", after the massive success of both singles.\n\nMelanie's first solo effort was a duet with Bryan Adams, released as a single on November 30, 1998. \"When You’re Gone\", originally featured on Adams' album \"On a Day Like Today\", secured a top 3 place in UK Singles Chart. The single spent 15 weeks in the UK Top 40, with nine of these in the Top 10. Bryan Adams first met Melanie C in September 1996 at London, while she was performing \"Say You'll Be There\" with the Spice Girls at \"Top of the Pops\". They both liked each other and Bryan Adams always had in mind a possible collaboration with her. They met again in a hotel in the Summer of 1998 when Melanie was on tour with the Spice Girls, and Bryan Adams was doing a video, and asked her to sing on his album. She hadn't even heard \"When You're Gone\" and she said she'd do it. The success of the single gave Melanie aspirations for more solo projects. They went on to write three more songs for Melanie’s upcoming debut solo album: \"Follow Me\", \"Angel on My Shoulder\" and \"You Taught Me\", the first two serving as b-sides to \"Northern Star\" and \"Goin' Down\" singles, while \"You Taught Me\" was released only as a promo to the media.\n\nIn early 1999, the Spice Girls took some time off, after extensively touring around the world. Mel B and Victoria Beckham announced they were both pregnant at the time, so every plan for the Spice Girls was put on hold. In January 1999 Melanie C decided to leave the UK and head to Los Angeles in order to work on her solo album, to be released in autumn of the same year. Melanie C was planning to work with producer Rick Rubin, who had met a year earlier, when the Spice Girls were supposed to record a track with Blackstreet for the \"South Park\" album, before legal wrangles intervened. Rubin was to be at the helm for that track, and when he heard of Melanie's own songwriting ambitions, he offered a hand which she promptly grabbed. Rick Rubin was also Red Hot Chili Peppers' main producer, whose lead singer, Anthony Kiedis was rumoured to be dating Melanie at the time. Melanie C wanted to do an indie rock album, naming Blur, Oasis, Suede and The Cardigans as her inspiration. She was also very fond of Madonna's work - \"Ray of Light\" in particular. Melanie wanted to cut her first album with help from Madonna. According to her interview in July 1999 to the British edition of \"Cosmopolitan\" magazine, Madonna invited her to spend some time with her, and she did succeed in having William Orbit, producer of Madonna's \"Ray of Light\", on opening track \"Go!\" as a writer and producer, while Marius de Vries, Craig Armstrong and Rick Nowels, who also worked with Madonna on \"Ray of Light\", also contributed tracks for Melanie's solo project. Four months after Melanie left for Los Angeles, Virgin Records executives, quite worried about the way the media would feel about her solo album, were given an early promo CD, named “Northern Star - Work In Progress CD”, to give them a premiere on her sound as a solo artist. The last tracks recorded for the album were “Go!” and “I Turn To You”, both not included on the early promo CD.\n\n\"Northern Star\" was released in UK and Europe on 18 October 1999 and later in the United States and Canada on 2 November 1999. To promote the album, Melanie C made a number of televised appearances and live performances of the album's songs. Her first gig as a solo artist took place at Leadmill Club in Sheffield, on 19 August 1999, in front of a crowd of 900 people. Melanie also performed at V99 rock festival on 21 and 22 August, receiving mixed to negative reviews, with BBC noting its confusion about which way Melanie C wants to take as an artist and whether she wants to be a pop star, a rockstar or a punk star. A special documentary entitled \"Northern Star\" was aired on Channel 4 on August 30, focusing on her life in Los Angeles during the recording of her first solo album. \"Closer\", \"Something's Gonna Happen\", \"I Wonder What It Would Be Like\", \"Independence Day\", \"Northern Star\" and \"Why\" made their debut during the documentary, and the music video of \"Goin' Down\" was also shown. She embarked on her first solo tour, From Liverpool to Leicester Square in the Autumn of 1999, and later the Northern Star Tour which started in Warsaw, Poland on 31 August 2000, and finished in Bonn, Germany on 26 August 2001.\n\n\"Northern Star\" debuted at number 10 in the UK Albums Chart, on the issue dated 24 October 1999. Album sales increased in the UK when \"Never Be The Same Again\" released as a single, entering the top 10 again and moving to number five two weeks later. \"Northern Star\" kept selling steadily well during the following months, until \"I Turn To You\" was released on August 2000, when sales took off again and \"Northern Star\" got its peak position on 2 September 2000, hitting number four of the album chart, nearly a year after its release. As of October 2016, \"Northern Star\" had spent 79 weeks on the official UK Albums Chart. Its last appearance on it was in January 2004, nearly 4 and a half years after its release. It has sold over 890,000 copies in the UK, as of October 2016. In the United States, it failed to chart in its first week of release. The album sold 6,717 copies in its first week, missing the bottom of the chart by a few hundred. It charted quite well in Canada, reaching number 16.\n\nCredits adapted from the liner notes of \"Northern Star\".\n\n\nSome songs from the album have also appeared in various films, such as \"Ga Ga\" which is audible in \"Big Daddy\", released the same year, and also appears on its soundtrack. The song \"Go\" makes an appearance in \"Whatever It Takes\". \"Suddenly Monday\" appears in \"Maybe Baby\" and on its soundtrack. \"I Turn to You\" also appears in \"Bend It Like Beckham\". Some songs have also been covered by international artists such as Christine Fan, who covered and translated \"Suddenly Monday\" in Chinese for her debut album \"FanFan's World\", Wig Wam, who covered \"I Turn to You\" for their album, \"667.. The Neighbour of the Beast\", and Dutch pop singer Do who covered the Japanese bonus-track \"Follow Me\", for her album of the same name.\n\n"}
{"id": "1896986", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1896986", "title": "Kendama", "text": "Kendama\n\nThe is a traditional Japanese skill toy. It consists of a handle (\"ken\"), a pair of cups (\"sarado\"), and a ball (\"tama\") that are all connected together by a string. On one end of the \"ken\" is a cup, while the other end of \"ken\" is narrowed down, forming a spike (\"kensaki\") that fits into the hole (\"ana\") of the \"tama\". The \"kendama\" is the Japanese version of the classic cup-and-ball game, and is also a variant of the French cup-and-ball game \"bilboquet\". Kendama can be held in different grips, and the tricks and combinations that can be done are limitless. The principle of these toys are the same: catching one object with another, where both are joined by a string.\n\nThe origins of kendama are disputed, but it is generally believed to have originated during the 17th or 18th century. Kendama started to evolutionize when it came to Japan during the Edo period, and since then the use of the toy has spread throughout the world. The size and materials used to create kendamas now vary as they are offered in jumbo and mini sizes, and have been created out plastic, metal, and nylon. There are now kendama competitions held in countries all over the world, the biggest competition being the annual Kendama World Cup in Japan.\n\nThe \"kendama\" is traditionally made out of wood and comprises the following parts:\n\n\"Stringing\" a kendama is the action of connecting all 3 pieces of the kendama (\"ken, sarado,\" and \"tama\") together. To string a kendama together, you need a bead (or mini bearing) and a piece of string. The steps to string a kendama together are:\n\nA video of this process can be found here\n\nA kendama can be held in numerous types of grips. The grip that a person decides to holds a kendama in depends on what trick that person wants to try and perform. Some of these grips include:\n\n\nThe general concept of kendama is pulling the \"ken\" up and balancing the \"tama\" somewhere on the \"ken\", or vice versa. There are not any specific rules on how to play kendama. However, bending the knees while playing kendama is a method that experts use. Endless tricks and trick combinations can be made with just \"ken grip, sara grip, tama grip,\" and \"candle grip\" by themselves or together in a combination. Some examples of tricks in each of these grips are as follows:\n\nSpike: This trick involves the hole in the \"tama\" and the spike.\n\nSwing Spike: a variation of the Spike.\n\n\nAround Japan: This trick is a combination of the big cup, small cup, and the spike.\n\nNote: The following combination is also ok: big cup→small cup→spike.\n\nNote: This trick can also be done in sara grip.\n\nAround the World: Similar to Around the Block, with the addition of the spike.\n\nBoth of these tricks can also be done in \"sara grip.\"\n\nBird: This trick involves the ball, the hole, the spike, and the big cup or small cup edge. \n\nMoshikame: This is a trick combination of the big cup and bottom cup.\n1. Pull the ball up into the big cup\n\n2. Bend your knees and hop the ball up into the air\n\n3. While the ball is in mid-air, rotate the \"ken\" downwards so that the bottom cup is facing up\n\n4. Catch the ball in the bottom cup.\n\nClack back: This trick uses the big cup (or small cup) and the end of the handle. \n\nAirplane: This trick involves the hole in the ball and the spike. \"Airplane\" mirrors the movement pattern of \"Swing Spike.\"\n\nLighthouse: This trick involves the base cup and the ball.\n\nCandlestick: This trick involves the base cup.\n\nThe origins of the game are disputed. It is believed by some to be a variant of the French ball-and-cup game bilboquet (\"bil\" \"ball\" \"boquet\" \"small tree\"), a toy that dates back to the 16th century and was popular in Europe during the 17th century. During that same period the kendama is believed to have arrived in Japan via the Silk Road from China during the Edo period (1600-1868), with some scholars specifying that it arrived between 1778 and 1779.\n\nHatsukaichi City in Hiroshima Prefecture is considered to be the birthplace of the modern Japanese Kendama due to the city becoming the first place for kendama manufacturing. Hamagatsu Ekusa created the shape of the kendama that is widely recognized today in 1919 in Kure city and during the early 20th century the toy had two side cups and was called a \"jitsugetsu ball\" ., literally translating to \"sun and moon ball.\"\n\nIn the early 20th century, the toy had two side cups and was called a \"jitsugetsu ball\" . This translates to \"sun and moon ball\", named so because of the ball's representation of the sun and the cups' likeness to the crescent moon.\n\nDespite not being originated in Japan, the shape of kendama that is known today was formed and evolved in Japan.\n\nThe dates of when the following 3 kendama models were made or seen are undocumented:\n\n\"Deer horn and ball\" was the form that the kendama took on when it arrived in Japan for the first time, literally a deer horn attached to a ball. Later on, some people replaced the deer horn with a piece of bamboo due to deer horn costing too may resources, making the bamboo and ball. The next model started to resemble what the kendama looks like today: the ken and ball. This model was a \"ken\" piece strung to the ball.\n\nThe jisugetsu ball kendama model was the first model made by Ekusa (1919), and later went on to be produced as many as 300,000 times in one year by Hongo woodworking factory in Hatsukaichi (1921). The \"jisugetsu\" has a similar design as lined folk craft kendamas, which were made by factories that also produced Kokeshi dolls from spinning lathe machines. The strings of both the jisugetsu ball and folk craft kendamas were placed on the \"ken\" using a loose metal fitting, making the string prone to detaching or breaking.\n\nThe S (Shinma)-Type kendama was the first competition style kendama invented in 1975 by Hideo Shinma, the president of the Tokyo Kendama Club. The first S-type prototype emerged in 1976, and the \"Japan Kendama Association\" (JKA) asked Shinma to make them a competition style model based on the S-Type design in 1977.\n\nThe F (Fujiwara)-Type (F16) kendama emerged in 1978, invented by Issei Fujiwara. The F-Type incorporated new modifications unknown to kendamas at the time. The F-Type had two small holes drilled in the middle of each side of the \"sarado\", and also used a sturdier string that was unlikely to break. The two string holes in the \"sarado\" offer more fluidity of play as well as the option to switch the kendama between left handed or right handed.\n\nThe Tortoise kendama by Tortoise, Inc. was a take on the S-type kendama after the S-type discontinued in 1990. Tortoise kendamas came in different models: the T-8, T-14, T-16, and T-17. The numbers indicating each different Tortoise model corresponds with the height of each model in centimeters. Tortoise kendamas stopped production in 2012 due to not having enough resources.\n\nThe F16-2, the second version of the F16, was released in 2001. The main change in the F16-2 from the F16 is that the position of the string hole was moved slightly off from the cup body's center, enabling the kendama to turn and rotate in a new fluid way. This string hole adjustment is still used in various shapes of kendamas to this day.\n\nKendama has increased in popularity since its initial evolution in Japan. During the 2000s, kendama surged in popularity outside Japan, which influenced the creation of the first kendama companies in foreign countries.\n\nThe first kendama company in the United States was Kendama USA in 2006. They began to promote kendama in North America and were able to reach the winter sports, bmx, and rollerblading communities. Since its founding, KendamaUSA has spread kendama nationwide and continue to do so. In 2010, the company Sweets Kendamas was founded in the USA in Minnesota by Matt \"Sweets\" Jorgenson. Sweets Kendamas' mission is to \"Spread Kendama Love,\" and they also have done that over the years.\n\nAs for the European kendama scene, some kendama companies that emerged in the late 2000s were Kendama Europe in 2008. Kendama Europe's first competition model kendama came out in 2011, and they have worked to spread kendama throughout Germany by attending the Nuremberg-Germany toy fair. Another company that emerged in the late 2000s was KROM Kendama from Denmark in 2010.\n\nAlmost every kendama company has a team of sponsored players to help promote their brands. Sponsored players range in age and location around the world.\n\nThe kendama community connects through social media platforms such as Instagram, Youtube, Facebook, Tiktok, Twitch and Twitter.\n\nKendama play has also been used as a measure of accuracy, agility, and learning ability in robotic arms.\n\nThere are no specific rules on how to play kendama. However, all forms of kendama competition are regulated by rules. 4 styles of kendama competition are: speed ladder, open division, freestyle, and Kendama World Cup (KWC). It is rare that the KWC style of competing is used an event other than KWC itself.\n\nThe speed ladder is a style of competition is a race of who can finish a set of tricks the fastest. Players will race through an order of tricks that they are given at the event or prior to the event via the internet. The players who finish the trick ladder the fastest wins. There are divisions that sign up to compete in based on their skill level (ex: beginner, intermediate, and advanced/pro).\n\nOpen Division is a head-to-head 1vs1 competition style format. Each round, 2 players compete against each other and take turns drawing a trick at random. Each trick drawn warrants a maximum of 3 exchanges - the number of times the players can go back and forth attempting the trick. The first player to 3 points wins.\n\n\nNote: In the final round, the first player to 5 points wins.\n\nNote: The labeled champion of each event is usually referring to the Open Division winner.\n\nFreestyle is a head-to-head 1vs1 style of competition. Each match is judged by a panel of 3 or 5 judges. The 2 players competing against each other in each round will take turns performing tricks in 45 second time periods twice each. During the time periods, both players may perform any trick that they choose.\n\nEach judge individually decides which player wins based on who did the best in the following 3 categories: \"Creativity, Consistency,\" and \"Difficulty\". The player with the most votes wins the round.\n\n120 tricks are released online prior to the KWC and are split up into groups of 10 tricks each 12 times, forming a level 1- level 12 trick list. The higher level a trick is, the more difficult it is and the more points it is worth. KWC is split into 2 days of competition: Day 1: Qualifying & Day 2: Finals. Each day has its own set of rules.\n\nDuring Day 1, all players choose 12 tricks from the levels 1-10 in the trick list. Players split the 12 tricks into two rounds of 6 tricks each, and each player will get 3 minutes for each round to complete as many tricks as possible. The 25 players with the highest point scores will advance to Day 2.\n\nNote: The number of points each trick is worth is equivalent to the face value of the level of the trick. (ex. level 6 trick is worth 6 points).\n\nDuring Day 2, the players compete one by one from the lowest scoring qualifying player to the highest scoring qualifying player. Each player has 3 minutes to do an unlimited number of tricks from levels 3-12, and each trick can only be done once. The player who gets the highest number of points in their time period wins.\n\nNote: The number of points each trick is worth is equivalent to the level of that trick squared (ex. level 6 trick is worth 36 points), with the exception of level 11 tricks (worth 151 points) and level 12 tricks (worth 194 points).\n\nKendama competitions have been occurring since 1979, with the first competition being the All Japan Kendama-Do Championships held by the Japan Kendama Association. The British Kendama Association was the first group to hold a formal kendama contest outside Japan in 2008 at the British Juggling Convention in Doncaster. Kendama competitions have taken a variety of formats including speed ladders, freestyle, head-to-head, and world championship style.\n\nTypically at events there are vendors that sell kendamas, clothing, and accessories. Competitions can range from 1–3 days long and prizes are provided for the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place winners of each competition category. Popular competitions include the North American Kendama Open & the Kendama World Cup (KWC).\n\nStarting in 2014, the Kendama World Cup (KWC) is an annual 2-day event in the summer that takes place in Hatsukaichi, Hiroshima, Japan and is the largest kendama competition in the world. In 2018 alone, the KWC had an audience of 49,000 members that were watching 415 competitors from 18 different countries compete for the title of Kendama World Champion.\n\nAt KWC, there is also an abundance of vendors selling their merchandise and kendamas, kendama games, and live performances all spread out over the 2 days of the event. Admission to the KWC is free.\n\n2014: Bonz Atron (KROM Kendama)\n\n2015: Wyatt Bray (Kendama USA)\n\n2016: Bryson Lee (Sweets Kendamas)\n\n2017: So Kanada (Sweets Kendamas)\n\n2018: Nick Gallagher (Sweets Kendamas)\n\n2019: Rui Sora (Kendama USA)\n\nFormerly known as the \"Minnesota Kendama Open,\" the North American Kendama Open (NAKO) has been an annual kendama event in Minnesota every Fall since 2013. The NAKO has developed in length over the years, going from a one day event in 2013-2014, to a two day event in 2015-2017, to a 3 day event in 2018-2019. The event has been hosted all over Minnesota - in 2013 it was held in Saint Paul, in the years 2014-2018 it was held in the Mall of America in Bloomington, and in 2019 it was hosted in Minneapolis at the Varsity Theater.\n\nThe forms of competition that the NAKO offers are as following:\n\n\nEach style of competition is split up into different times across each day of the event, so a portion of every competition is completed by the time each day ends. On the final day, a champion is crowned in all divisions.\n\n\nCatch & Flow, Freestyle World Championship was first held in September 2014 in downtown Tokyo, Japan. Using a new format to determine the best freestyle skills in the world, the Catch & Flow defined a new way to perform freestyle kendama and to judge such style. Players from around the world apply to participate listing their achievements. The top approx. 60 players are selected to perform for 90 seconds one by one. Judges determine 16 finalist who will go head to head with 2 x 45sec for each player in 1 on 1 battles towards the final.\n\nCatch & Flow - World Freestyle Winners\n\n\nThe Battle at the Border is the longest-standing annual kendama competition in the United States. The event is currently hosted by Kentucky-based kendama company Sol Kendamas. The event occurs on the first weekend of each January in Tennessee, USA.\n\nJune 2011, the first public Kendama competition (battle) was held in the state of Tennessee. The event occurred in the city of Nashville hosted by a kendama blog called the \"Kensession Stand\". The event was called the \"Nashville Kendama Battle\", and was held at 12th South Taproom. \nIn subsequent years, a group of kendama players called The Kendama Squad (Chad Covington, Nicholas Bellamy, and John Ross Rudolph) -- alongside the Kensession Stand (Tyler Marshall) -- hosted annual kendama battles in Clarksville, Tennessee. While the competition continued to occur annually, the name \"Battle at the Border\" was not implemented until the 2014 competition. In 2015, Sol Kendamas began officially coordinating the event. In 2015, the competition reached its largest attendance (approximately 150 people). Battle at the Border (2015-2016) was held in Nashville, Tennessee on the first weekend of January at Rocketown. Battle at the Border (2017-2018) was held on the first weekend of January at The Foundry in Nashville, TN. Battle at the Border returned to Rocketown and has continued to be hosted there since.\n\nBattle at the Border Open Winners\n\n\nDama Fest is North Americas original and first large scale Kendama competition, hosted by Kendama USA. The first Dama Fest was in 2011, and the second was in 2013. Kendama players traveled from all over the North America, Europe, and Japan. Players competed in a single elimination head to head bracketed format.\n\n2011 / Sebastian Orrego / USA / Unsponsored\n\n2013 / Keith Matsumura / USA / Kendama USA\n\n\n"}

Commonly known by its original name, Waldstadion (), the stadium opened in 1925. The stadium has been upgraded several times since then; the most recent remodelling was its redevelopment as a football-only stadium in preparation for the 2005 FIFA Confederations Cup and 2006 FIFA World Cup. With a capacity of 51,500 spectators for league matches and 48,500 for American Football and International Football matches, it is among the ten largest football stadiums in Germany. The stadium was one of the nine venues of 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup, and hosted four matches including the final.\n\nThe sports complex, which is owned by the city of Frankfurt, includes the actual stadium and other sports facilities, including a swimming pool, a tennis complex, a beach volleyball court and a winter sports hall. The arena has its own railway station, Frankfurt Stadion, on the national rail network.\n\nThe Commerzbank-Arena is home stadium of football club Eintracht Frankfurt whose offices are also located on the premises.\n\nThe original stadium was opened in 1925. In 24–28 July, Waldstadion hosted the 1925 Workers' Summer Olympiad. The football final between Germany and Finland was played in front of a crowd of 40,000 spectators. In 1937, the spectator capacity through expansion of the back straight was increased to 55,000.\n\nThe first major changes to the stadium were made following a game between Eintracht Frankfurt and 1. FC Nürnberg in May 1953. Almost 70,000 tickets were sold for a stadium envisioned for only 55,000 spectators, and 200 fans were injured as thousands tried to force entry.\n\nThe renovated and enlarged Waldstadion was reopened on 14 May 1955 after 19 months of construction work. The stadium once more hosted national team matches as well as some important games for Eintracht Frankfurt, who reached the final round of the German National Championships in 1959. During the run to the final, 81,000 watched Eintracht beat FK Pirmasens - an attendance record that still stands.\n\nIn December 1960, an ice rink was opened within the oval of the velodrome. Here, the ice hockey team of Eintracht Frankfurt played their home games until 1981. In 1960 the stadium was given floodlights.\n\nThe first Bundesliga game in the Waldstadion took place on 24 August 1963 – a 1–1 draw with 1. FC Kaiserslautern on the first day of the new German national league.\n\nThe stadium hosted the World Championships in track cycling in 1966 and the heavyweight boxing championship between Muhammad Ali and Karl Mildenberger on 10 September 1966, won by Ali with a knockout in the 12th round in front of 22,000 spectators.\n\nThe second major renovation of the Waldstadion was needed for the 1974 FIFA World Cup. From May 1972 to January 1974, the stadium was rebuilt virtually from scratch to meet the requirements of the World Cup venues. The opening ceremony of the 1974 World Cup was held at the Waldstadion. \n\nIn 1978, improved drainage and undersoil heating were installed.\n\nThe first final of the newly introduced Women's European Cup was held at the stadium in May 2002, and the home team of 1. FFC Frankfurt beat Swedish side Umeå IK 2–0 to lift the trophy. \n\nThe new Waldstadion is primarily designed as a football arena, but can be used for other turf sports like American football and major events. The grandstand offers rooms that are for meetings, conventions and other events in external markets.\n\nThe new arena was officially opened at the 2005 FIFA Confederations Cup, the test run for the 2006 World Cup. Both the opening match (Germany 4–3 Australia) and the final (Brazil 4–1 Argentina) were hosted at the stadium. \n\nThe main users of the stadium is the football team Eintracht Frankfurt, which has used the stadium as its home base since 1963. \n\nIn addition, the stadium also serves occasionally as an alternative venue for home games of other teams: 1. FSV Mainz 05 played their qualifying matches for the 2005-06 UEFA Cup against the Armenian representatives Mika and against Keflavík ÍF from Iceland and for the 1st Round proper against Sevilla FC in the Commerzbank Arena. \n\nThe women of the local football team 1. FFC Frankfurt defeated Umeå IK 3–2 in the stadium on 24 May 2008 in the final second leg of UEFA Women's Cup, winning the European Cup for the third time and setting up a record for women's club football of 27,500 spectators \n\nThe Turkish Football Federation has also staged several games in the arena, as Turks form a significant ethnic minority in Germany. Beşiktaş won the Turkish Super Cup with a 1–0 win over Galatasaray. Due to the suspension by UEFA of the Turkish national stadium, the qualifying matches for UEFA Euro 2008 against Malta (final score 2–0 to Turkey), against Moldova (5–0 for the Turks) and against Norway (final score 2–2) were also played here. \n\nThe Waldstadion from 1991 to 2007, with a few interruptions, was home stadium for the NFL Europa's Frankfurt Galaxy American Football team. The stadium hosted World Bowl '98, World Bowl 2000 and World Bowl XV in 2007. \n\nSince 2008 the ground has hosted the final of the German Bowl, final match of the German Football League. An average of around 15,000 fans watched the 2008 and 2009 finals. \n\nThe Commerzbank-Arena hosts numerous concerts and festivals every year, especially during the summer. Since 2013, the stadium hosts the BigCityBeats World Club Dome every end of May or June.\nAs part of a naming sponsorship by Commerzbank AG, the Waldstadion was renamed the Commerzbank-Arena on 1 May 2005 for ten years. Commerzbank will pay around €30 million to the city hosting company as part of the deal. During the 2005 FIFA Confederations Cup and the 2006 FIFA World Cup, the stadium was officially referred to as the \"FIFA World Cup Stadium Frankfurt\", as FIFA rules do not permit commercial naming of stadia.\n\nIn March 2020 Deutsche Bank bought the naming rights until 2027 with an option to extend. The stadium will be named\nDeutsche Bank Park from 2020-21.\n\n"}

The single was released internationally as a double A-side single with \"Holler\". It peaked at number one on the UK Singles Chart, becoming the group's ninth number-one single.\n\nAfter releasing \"Goodbye\" as their first single without member Geri Halliwell, in 1998, the band took a break and only came back to a recording studio in mid-1999, when Rodney Jerkins signed up to give their then-upcoming new album a tougher sound. Jerkins said, \"I went out to dinner with a couple of the Spice Girls about a month and a half ago and they told me that they want me to, you know, do some work on their album, so I'm planning on going to London at the end of January, early February to work on the album, so it should be cool. I'm ready for it, it will still have a pop appeal, but the beats will be a little harder.\" Later, in October 1999, Jerkins also said, \"I did three songs with them, and everybody I've been playing them for can't believe it's the Spice Girls. I like to create for the artist on the spot. I knew I had to do the Spice Girls 10 months beforehand, but I didn't write one single lyric or do one track until I got to London. We started working on the songs the day I met them, because I wanted to get a vibe from them. We did the three songs in five days\".\n\nIn March 2000, BBC Radio announced that the first single from their forthcoming third album would be \"Holler\". However, in May, Melanie C told \"Heat\" magazine that the first single from the album would be a ballad titled \"Let Love Lead the Way\" and would be released in August. In July 2000, the girls said that the first single had not been chosen yet, and that they were still up for discussion which one will be the first single. Finally, in late July, Melanie C confirmed to T4 that their new single will be a double A-side of \"Let Love Lead the Way\" and \"Holler\", saying that the video for \"Let Love Lead the Way\" was filmed a week before. \"Let Love Lead the Way\" received its world premiere on the Malaysian radio station Hitz FM on 14 September.\n\n\"Let Love Lead the Way\" was written by the members of the group Victoria Beckham, Melanie Brown, Emma Bunton and Melanie Chisholm, along with Rodney Jerkins, LaShawn Daniels, Fred Jerkins III and Harvey Mason Jr., while production was handled by Jerkins and Mason Jr. \"Let Love Lead the Way\" is an inspirational song, with the girls singing words of wisdom to a girl. In the chorus, they sing, \"Part of me laughs/Part of me cries/Part of me wants to question why [...] Just keep the faith/And let love lead the way.\" The song is widely believed to be written about Geri Halliwell.\n\nThe song was very well received by most music critics. Helen Marquis of \"Amazon.com\" called it an \"instantly recognisable Spice ballad,\" while \"Sputnikmusic\" called it a \"gorgeous ballad.\" \"The Bland Is Out There\" named it \"a sweet and solid ballad.\" David Browne of \"Entertainment Weekly\" criticized the track, writing that it \"could be sung by any urban radio girl group.\" Whitney Matheson of \"USA Today\" criticized the lyrics and wrote that \"I've heard catchier jingles on feminine product commercials, although I must admit I'm impressed with the deeply imaginative third-person perspective\". While reviewing their \"Greatest Hits\" album, Nick Levine of \"Digital Spy\" wrote that \"Jerkins' slick, stuttering R&B numbers from the \"Forever\" album ('Holler', 'Let Love Lead The Way') fail to capitalise on the girls' very British sense of mischief, but it functions brilliantly on two levels.\"\n\nIn the UK, on 24 October 2000, early sales figures reported that \"Holler\"/\"Let Love Lead the Way\" was set to debut at number one. It sold 31,000 copies during the first day on sale. On 29 October 2000, the song debuted at the top of the UK Singles Chart, becoming the first female group to have nine number one singles. The song became the 11th UK number-one single with Melanie Chisholm as a songwriter, making her the female artist with more number ones than any other in chart history. She held this record until Madonna surpassed it in 2006 with \"Sorry\". However, Mel C remains the only female performer to top the charts as a solo artist, as part of a duo, quartet and quintet. The single was released separately from \"Holler\" in Canada, but was also a success, reaching number five on the Canadian Singles Chart. In Australia, \"Holler\"/\"Let Love Lead the Way\" was a success, debuting and peaking at number two on the ARIA Charts, becoming their highest charting-single since 1998's \"Viva Forever\". In New Zealand, the song debuted at number 47 on the RIANZ chart, remaining for a further week at the position. Later, it jumped to number 36, also remaining for two weeks at the position. Finally, after a week at number 29, the song rose to number two, becoming its peak position and the band's 10th consecutive top-10 single.\n\nThe music video was shot on 17 July 2000. The video is similar in concept to that of \"Holler\" where each of the girls portray one of the four elements. Though this time, Chisholm switches elements with Bunton, representing earth and wearing a green dress. She is shown reclining in a beautiful forest, underneath a large tree. Brown switches elements with Beckham and portrays the element air, dressed entirely in white and dancing in a white room with the canvas walls billowing outwards as if being blown by the wind, while white feathers continuously fall from the sky. Beckham is wearing a dark red dress, representing fire. She is slowly dancing in a barren desert at night, with bursts of fire flaring up behind her. Chisholm plays the part of water, dressed in predominantly blue clothes. She is standing on a blue platform as water cascades from the ceiling to the floor. Throughout the verses of the song, the girls sing in their own areas, before coming together in one of the rooms for the chorus. Towards the end of the song, each of the elements begin to mix, such as water falling down in the fiery desert and wind blowing through the forest. The four girls are then seen singing together in the desert where all the elements are present plus a shower of sparks behind the girls. The song finishes with a slow-motion shot of each of the girls in their own areas, and then a final shot of each of them together in the white room. Additional behind-the-scenes footage was shown on the Spice Girls' website at the time and on \"\".\n\nThe four-piece group performed the song on \"Top of the Pops\", \"\" and \"National Lottery\" in 2000 for the promotion of the single. In 2007 and 2008, the Spice Girls performed the song again on their reunion tour, Return of the Spice Girls. Even though group member Geri Halliwell had returned to the group at this point, she did not take part in performing this song as with \"Holler\", which signaled her departure from the group in the concert's storyline (performing \"Viva Forever\" when Geri is leveled under the stage). Halliwell reunited with the group just as the song ends by rising from the ground.\n\nDuring the Spice World - 2019 Tour Geri took part in performing all three songs from the \"Forever\" album - \"Goodbye\", \"Holler\" and \"Let Love Lead the Way\", singing Victoria's vocals.\n\n\n\n\nPublished by Rodney Jerkins Productions/EMI Music Publishing Ltd., Fred Jerkins Music Publishing/Famous Music Corp, First Avenue Music Ltd., EMI Music Publishing (WP) Ltd.\n"}

It runs the network on a pay-per-use basis, with toll stations placed along its length. The general speed-limit is 120 km/h.\n\nThe first expressway in the country is the A1 Casablanca-Rabat. Construction of the first section started in 1975 but completion of this road between the economic and the administrative capital took 13 years. Originally usage of the road was free of charge. The toll-road system was later introduced as one measure to prevent lengthy construction times (as happened with this first road). Finding investors for new roads would be easier when these roads would generate their own revenue to repay investors.\n\nIn 2006, it was announced that ADM will be investing 6.18 billion dirhams ($859 million) to develop its highway network in 2007. These investment packages are part of the objective that aim to complete 1,500 km by 2012.\n\nAs of August 2016, ADM manages 1808 km of Morocco's toll roads. As of November 2016 the total length of Morocco's motorways is 1,808 kilometres (paid) and 1,093 kilometres (free) expressways.\n\nThe Kingdom of Morocco is planning investments of around 23 billion euros in road construction up to 2035. The Moroccan government has announced that more than 5,500 kilometres of new highways and expressways are to be constructed with investment totalling 8.8 billion euros. This includes 700 km of 3x2 roads which will be constructed.\n\nAlso 45,000 km of new rural roads are created in rural areas and the modernization of 7,000 km of rural roads. It is part of new plan of the Morocco Ministry of Transport, which will invest 660 billion dirhams in the transport and logistics sector.\n\nThe main Moroccan expressways are:\n\n\nThe construction history of these expressways by segment is as follows:\nIn 2007 762 accidents with casualties were reported, a 5% increase on 2006. The accident-rate per 100 million traveled kilometers dropped by 20% from 30.2 to 24.1 between these years, but the total number as well as rate of deaths didn't go down.\n\nA breakdown of these figures:\n\nIncreasing safety is an important goal for the ADM: the new autoroutes are designed to improve safety and the ADM also believes that extending the express-way network will increase overall safety as the through-going (and often high-speed) traffic is moved away from the Route Nationals, that run through the cities and villages along the way. Expressways also use non-level crossings and because there is no oncoming traffic overtaking cars is safer than on normal roads.\nThe ADM also publishes accident figures to increase the attention of the public in road-safety.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2011 the number of accidents on expressways with injuries fell 21% compared to the same period in 2010\n\n"}

Although similar to each other in some ways these New World structures with their flat tops (many with temples on the top) and their stairs bear only a very weak architectural resemblance to Egyptian pyramids. The Mesoamerican region's largest pyramid by volume – the largest pyramid in the world by volume – is the Great Pyramid of Cholula, in the east-central Mexican state of Puebla. The builders of certain classic Mesoamerican pyramids have decorated them copiously with stories about the Hero Twins, the feathered serpent Quetzalcoatl, Mesoamerican creation myths, ritualistic sacrifice, etc.written in the form of hieroglyphs on the rises of the steps of the pyramids, on the walls, and on the sculptures contained within.\n\nThe Aztecs, a people with a rich mythology and cultural heritage, dominated central Mexico in the 14th, 15th and 16th centuries. Their capital was Tenochtitlan on the shore of Lake Texcoco – the site of modern-day Mexico City. They were related to the preceding cultures in the basin of Mexico such as the culture of Teotihuacan whose building style they adopted and adapted.\n\nThe Maya are a people of southern Mexico and northern Central America (Guatemala, Belize, western Honduras, and El Salvador) with some 3,000 years of history. Archaeological evidence shows the Maya started to build ceremonial architecture approximately 3,000 years ago. The earliest monuments consisted of simple burial mounds, the precursors to the spectacular stepped pyramids from the Terminal Pre-classic period and beyond. \n\nThese pyramids relied on intricate carved stone in order to create a stair-stepped design. Many of these structures featured a top platform upon which a smaller dedicatory building was constructed, associated with a particular Maya deity. Maya pyramid-like structures were also erected to serve as a place of interment for powerful rulers. Maya pyramidal structures occur in a great variety of forms and functions, bounded by regional and periodical differences.\n\nThe Tarascan state was a precolumbian culture located in the modern day Mexican state of Michoacán. The region is currently inhabited by the modern descendants of the Purépecha. Purépechan architecture is noted for \"T\"-shaped step pyramids known as \"yácatas\".\n\nThe Teotihuacan civilization, which flourished from around 300 BCE to 500 CE, at its greatest extent included most of Mesoamerica. Teotihuacano culture collapsed around 550 and was followed by several large city-states such as Xochicalco (whose inhabitants were probably of Matlatzinca ethnicity), Cholula (whose inhabitants were probably Oto-Manguean), and later the ceremonial site of Tula (which has traditionally been claimed to have been built by Toltecs but which now is thought to have been founded by the Huastec culture).\n\nThe site called Tula, the Toltec capitol, in the state of Mexico is one of the best preserved five-tier pyramids in Mesoamerican civilization. The ground plan of the site has two pyramids, Pyramid B and Pyramid C.\n\nThe Toltec empire lasted from around 700 to 1100. Although the origin of the Toltec Empire is a mystery, they are said to have migrated Mexico's northern plateau until they set up their empire’s capital in central Mexico, called Tula, which is 70 km/40 mi northwest of modern day Mexico City. When the city of Tula was in its prime it had around 40,000 people living in it and the city flourished from 900 to 1100. The city of Tula had a main plaza surrounded by 2 pyramids and a ritual ball court. The most popular pyramid on this site (pyramid b) is the pyramid of Quetzalcoatl which is a five-tiered pyramid with four giant carved pillars on top. The pyramid of Quetzalcoatl was named after a story of a legendary priest, also named Quetzalcoatl who was exiled from Tula around the year 1000. He is said to have ended warfare between Mayan city states and after that the Toltecs started worshiping Quetzalcoatl.\n\nThe best known Classic Veracruz pyramid, the Pyramid of Niches in El Tajín, is smaller than those of their neighbours and successors but more intricate. \n\nThe Zapotecs were one of the earliest Mesoamerican cultures and held sway over the Valley of Oaxaca region from the early first millennium BCE to about the 14th century.\n\nThe following sites are from northern Mesoamerica, built by cultures whose ethnic affiliations are unknown:\n\nThis astronomical and also ceremonial center was the product of the Chalchihuite culture. Its occupation and development had a period of approximately 800 years (ca. 200—1000). This zone is considered an important archaeological center because of the astonishing, accurate functions of the edifications. The ones that stand out the most are: The Moon Plaza, The Votive Pyramid, the Ladder of Gamio and The labyrinth. In The Labyrinth you can appreciate with precision and accuracy, the respective equinoxes and the seasons.\n\nA great quantity of buildings were constructed on artificial terraces upon the slopes of a hill. The materials used here include stone slab and clay. The most important structures are: The Hall of Columns, The Ball Court, The Votive Pyramid, and The Palace and the Barracks. On the most elevated part of the hill is The Fortress. This is composed of a small pyramid and a platform, encircled by a wall that is more than 800m long and up to six feet high. La Quemada was occupied from 800 to 1200. Their founders and occupants have not been identified with certainty but probably belonged to either the Chalchihuites culture or that of the neighbouring Malpaso culture.\n\n\n"}

It has been said that these teachings will have a long-lasting influence on the Church.\n\nPope John Paul II's philosophical and theological teachings and writings were characterised by explorations in phenomenology and personalism. He was influenced by Hans Urs von Balthasar, Henri de Lubac, Yves Congar, Karl Rahner, his predecessors as Archbishop of Kraków Eugeniusz Baziak and Adam Stefan Sapieha, and his predecessors as Pope - John XXIII, Paul VI, and John Paul I. His closest theological adviser was Cardinal Ratzinger, who succeeded him as Pope. Stanislaw Dziwisz was his personal secretary for forty years and one of his closest friends and advisers, and became Archbishop of Kraków, John Paul's former post, and Cardinal. John Paul met regularly with the Cardinal prefects and presidents of Curial congregations and councils, and outlived many of them.\n\nJohn Paul II published the Catechism of the Catholic Church, which became an international best-seller . Its purpose, according to the Pope's Apostolic Constitution \"Fidei Depositum\" was to be \"a statement of the Church's faith and of Catholic doctrine, attested to or illumined by Sacred Scripture, the Apostolic Tradition and the Church's Magisterium.\" He declared \"it to be a sure norm for teaching the faith\" to \"serve the renewal\" of the Church.\n\nRight after being elected as Pope, he told the cardinals who elected him that he saw that his main work was to implement the teachings of the Second Vatican Council, an important centrepiece of which is a universal call to holiness. This is the basis for his canonization of saints from all walks of life, as well as for establishing and supporting the personal prelature of Opus Dei, that teaches that everyone is called to holiness and that ordinary life is a path to sanctity.\n\nHis first encyclical letters focused on the Triune God; the very first was on Jesus the Redeemer (\"\"Redemptor hominis\"\"). He maintained this intellectual focus on God throughout his pontificate.\n\nIn \"The Splendor of Truth\" (\"\"Veritatis Splendor\"\"), a papal encyclical concerning morality, he emphasised the dependence of man on God and his law (\"Without the Creator, the creature disappears\") and the \"dependence of freedom on the truth.\" He said that man \"giving himself over to relativism and scepticism, goes off in search of an illusory freedom apart from truth itself.\"\n\nIn his master plan for the new millennium, the Apostolic Letter \"At the beginning of the third millennium\", (\"\"Novo Millennio Ineunte\"\") a \"program for all times\", he emphasised the importance of \"starting afresh from Christ\": \"No, we shall not be saved by a formula but by a Person.\" Thus, the first priority for the Church is holiness: \"All Christian faithful...are called to the fullness of the Christian life.\" Christians, he writes, contradict this when they \"settle for a life of mediocrity, marked by a minimalist ethic and a shallow religiosity.\" He highlighted \"the radical message of the gospels,\" whose demands should not be watered down. The \"training in holiness calls for a Christian life distinguished above all in the art of prayer.\"\n\nHis last Encyclical is on the Holy Eucharist, which he says \"contains the Church's entire spiritual wealth: Christ himself.\" Building on his master plan further, he emphasised the need to \"rekindle amazement\" on the Eucharist and to \"contemplate the face of Christ.\"\n\nJohn Paul II's strong Marian devotion was highly influenced by the Mariology of Saint Louis de Montfort. According to his Apostolic Letter \"Rosarium Virginis Mariae\", the pontif's personal motto \"Totus Tuus\" was inspired by St. Louis' doctrine on \"total consecration to the Virgin Mary\", which he quoted:\n\nIn an address to the Montfortian Fathers, the pontiff also said that his reading Saint Louis de Montfort's work \"The True Devotion to Mary\" was a \"decisive turning point\" in his life. On September 19, 1996, Pope John-Paul II made a papal trip to Saint-Laurent-sur-Sèvre to meditate and pray on the adjacent tombs of Saint Louis de Montfort and Blessed Marie Louise Trichet, whom he beatified himself.\n\nHis encyclical \"Redemptoris Mater\" further emphasizes his focus on Mariology.\n\nJohn Paul II also wrote extensively about workers and the social doctrine of the Church, which he discussed in three encyclicals and which the Vatican brought to the fore through the recently published \"Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church\". Through his encyclicals, John Paul also talked about the dignity of women and the importance of the family for the future of humanity.\n\nOther important documents include the encyclicals \"The Gospel of Life\" (\"\"Evangelium Vitae\"\") and \"Faith and Reason\" (\"\"Fides et Ratio\"\"), and the Apostolic Letter \"\"Light of the East\"\" (\"Orientale Lumen\").\n\nJohn Paul II reaffirmed the Church's clear opposition to contraception, abortion and homosexual activity. His book \"Memory and Identity\" said that the push for same-sex marriage might be part of a \"new ideology of evil... which attempts to pit human rights against the family and against man.\" He refined some of these positions in their theological context in his Theology of the Body lectures.\n\nJohn Paul II, who was present and very influential at the 1962–65 Second Vatican Council, affirmed the teachings of the Council and did much to implement them. John Paul II continued to declare that contraception, abortion, and homosexual acts were gravely sinful, and, with Joseph Ratzinger (future Pope Benedict XVI), opposed Liberation theology.\nHe believed in the Church's exaltation of the marital act of sexual intercourse between a baptised man and woman within sacramental marriage as proper and exclusive to the sacrament of marriage that was, in every instance, profaned by contraception, abortion, divorce followed by a further marriage, and by homosexual acts. He explained and asserted in 1994 the Church's lack of authority to ordain women to the priesthood. This was deemed a repudiation of calls to ordain women to the priesthood. (Apostolic Letter 'Ordinatio Sacerdotalis') In addition John Paul II did not end the discipline of mandatory priestly celibacy, although he allowed a few married clergymen of other Christian traditions who later became Catholic to be ordained as Catholic priests.\n\nJohn Paul II, as a writer of philosophical and theological thought, was characterized by his explorations in phenomenology and personalism. He is also known for his development of the Theology of the Body.\n\nPhilosophers and theologians influenced by him include his successor, Pope Benedict XVI, Jürgen Habermas, John Haas, Andrew Greeley, Rocco Buttiglione, Hans Köchler, George Weigel, Scott Hahn, Mary Beth Bonacci, Deirdre McQuade, Antoinette Bosco, Hans Küng, Yves Congar, Avery Dulles, John J.

{"id": "1897033", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1897033", "title": "Sihuanaba", "text": "Sihuanaba\n\nThe Sihuanaba, La Siguanaba, Cigua or Cegua is a supernatural character from Mexican and Central American folklore. It is a shape-changing spirit that typically takes the form of an attractive, long haired woman seen from behind. She lures men away into danger before revealing her face to be that of a horse or, alternatively, a skull.\n\nThe Siguanaba and its variants may have been brought to Latin America from Spain during the Colonial Period, used by the colonists as a means of exercising control over the indigenous and \"mestizo\" population.\n\nWhen encountered, she is a beautiful woman who is either naked or dressed in flimsy white; she usually appears bathing in a public water tank, river, or other water source, although she may also be found washing clothing. She likes to lure lone men out late on dark, moonless nights, without letting them see her face at first. She tempts such men away from their planned routes to lose them in deep canyons.\n\nIn Guatemala, the Siguanaba appears as a beautiful, seductive woman with very long hair. She will not reveal her face until the last moment, when it is revealed as either the face of a horse or, alternatively, a human skull. If her victim (usually an unfaithful man) does not die of fear then he is driven mad by the sight. From afar the Siguanaba can imitate the appearance of a man's girlfriend in order to lead him astray.\n\nWhen appearing to children, the Siguanaba will take on the appearance of the child's mother in order to lure her victim into her grasp; once touched by the Siguanaba the child is driven mad and she will lead her victim into the wilderness to leave the child lost and insane.\n\nTraditional methods are said to ward off the Siguanaba. In the border regions between Guatemala and El Salvador, those who see the Siguanaba make the sign of the cross upon her or bite their machete, while simultaneously banishing both the evil spirit and the fear that grips the victim.\n\nThe word \"siguanaba\" or \"sihuanaba\" has its origin in the indigenous languages of Mesoamerica. Various words have been suggested as its source. In parts of Mexico the Siguanaba is known as \"macihuatli\", a Nahuatl word that can be broken down to two elements; \"cihuatl\" (meaning \"woman\") and \"matlatl\" (meaning \"net\"). This \"net-woman\" encompasses the figurative idea of a woman capturing men in her metaphorical net of attraction.\n\nLikewise, \"cigua\" or \"cegua\", names for the spirit in Honduras and Costa Rica, also have their origin in the Nahuatl word \"cihuatl\", simply meaning \"woman\". Guatemalan historian and folklorist Adrián Recinos gave two possible origins for the word \"siguanaba\". In one of the 20+ languages of Guatemala, he claimed \"ciguanaba\" meant \"naked woman\" but he failed to identify the exact language of origin. In another source he claimed that its origin is the Nahuatl \"ciuanauac\" or \"ciguanauac\", meaning \"concubine\".\n\nIn Guatemala, the word \"siguanaba\" has been linked to \"siwan\", a K'iche' Maya word meaning a cliff or deep ravine, and Guatemalan folk etymology gives this as the origin of the word, although scholars such as Recinos and Roberto Paz y Paz disagree.\n\nIn Guatemala the Sihuanaba is known as \"La Siguanaba\"; she is known as \"Cigua\" in Honduras, \"Ciguanaba\" in El Salvador and as \"Cegua\" in Costa Rica. Although the name varies from place to place, the appearance and actions of the Sihuanaba remain unchanged.\n\nThe Salvadoran legend of La Siguanaba says that the woman, originally called Sihuehuet (\"beautiful woman\"), was a peasant girl that ascended to queen using her charms (and a witch's brew) to lure into marriage Tlaloc's son, Yeisun, who was a Nahuatl prince. After marriage, when her husband went to war, she had affairs with other men, and Cipitio was the child of this relationship. Sihuehuet was a bad mother, neglecting her son, leaving him alone to meet her lovers. To inherit the throne she concocted a plot to use another magic potion to poison Yeisun during a festival, and so claim the throne for her lover.\n\nBut the plan worked too well. Yeisun was transformed into a savage giant monster with two heads, who ravaged the attendants to the palace's feast. The guard struggled and defeated the creature, ending Yeisun's life. When Tlaloc found out about this, he sought the help of the almighty god, Teotl whom condemned and cursed Sihuehuet: She would be called Sihuanaba (\"hideous woman\"); she would be beautiful at first sight, but she would turn into a horrible abomination after luring her victims to isolated gorges. She was forced to wander the countryside, appearing to men who travelled alone at night. She is supposed to be seen at night in the rivers of El Salvador, washing clothes and always looking for her son, Cipitio, who was also cursed by Teotl to remain a boy for eternity.\n\nIn Guatemala, the Siguanaba is said to be encountered washing her hair with a golden bowl and combing her hair with a golden comb. She is said to wander the streets of Guatemala City, luring away men who are in love. In Guatemala, the legend is more common in Guatemala City, Antigua Guatemala (the old colonial capital) and the eastern departments of the country. The most common variant in these areas is that where the spirit has the face of a horse. In Guatemala the Siguanaba is often said to appear to men who are unfaithful in order to punish them.\n\nA Kaqchikel Maya version of the Siguanaba from San Juan Comalapa describes her as a woman with enormous glowing eyes and a hoof for a hand. She wears a glittering dress and has very long hair and haunts the local rubbish dump, frightening disobedient children and drunken husbands.\n\nOn the Guatemalan side of Lake Güija, in Jutiapa Department, the Siguanaba is able to take on many forms but the most common is that of a slim, beautiful woman with long hair who bathes herself on the banks of the Ostúa River, although she may also appear by other water sources or simply by lonely roadsides. To lustful men she appears just as a beautiful woman, while to lovestruck men she takes the form of the object of the man's affections. A tale from San Juan La Isla relates how a man went to meet his wife who was returning on horseback from El Salvador, and after accompanying her for a while his \"wife\" flung herself from her mount and revealed herself to be the Siguanaba. In this same region, the Siguanaba is said to appear on moonlit nights to horseriders on lonely roads, asking to ride pillion. After riding with her victim for a short while, she reveals her fingernails as fearsome claws and her face as that of a horse, causing the rider to die of terror. Those lucky few that manage to flee find themselves lost in the wilderness.\n\nIn Mexico the legend of the Siguanaba is present in almost the entire country, mostly throughout Mesoamerica, where they call her Macihuatli, Matlazihua, X'tabay, X'tabal or, popularly, \"Horse-faced woman\"; and some even relate it to La Llorona.\n\nThere are multiple testimonies and stories about this horror. They all have in common that they can only be seen at night on lonely roads or places, showing themselves as night owl men, partiers, womanizers or drunkards, or all of that at the same time. She shows herself as a woman with an attractive body, very well formed, always on her back or walking away, with her face completely covered by either her hair or a large veil ... Invariably, the victim feels fascinated and attracted to the beautiful woman, whom he decides to follow or approach, filling her with compliments and insinuations of all kinds, color and intention ...\n\nShe always ignores and tries to hide her face even more, which always provokes the victim's insistence, until she turns the woman away, taking the fright of her life, since the woman has a horse's head and red eyes. Sometimes she utters phrases like \"Do I still look beautiful to you?\" or \"I also like you a lot\". The victim screams in terror and flees from there as fast as her legs allow, now without the effects of alcohol; and swearing never to drink again ... Although there are cases in which the victim is \"touched\" and dies shortly thereafter despite attempts by the family to \"take him to clean\" or \"cure him of dread\". As you can see, this appearance plays a sobering role that brings a consequence for a specific behavior, it is not like the famous weeping woman who causes terror to whoever has the misfortune to meet her or hear her famous scream, regardless of gender, age or any other characteristics. The Siguanaba, or the woman with the face of a horse, is an entity that is in charge of complying with it, or else, of the classic recommendations of the grandmother or the mother to the young men: \"do not go out now and behave well.\"\n\nIt should be mentioned that sometimes her head varies, not only can it be that of a horse, but it can also be that of a dog, a pig, an old woman's face, a skull or a disfigured and bloody face. Likewise, the horse's head also varies, it can be that of a common horse, a horse skull, it can be putrefied, it can be a face with rotten meat or a horse face with skin.\n\nIn the state of Nayarit, there is a version similar to the Salvadoran version. According to the Nayarit version, it was a woman or a moon goddess who was the wife of the god Tlaloc, with whom she had a son, who treated her badly, abandoned her and was unfaithful to her husband, who, after discovering his bad actions, He cursed her calling her Sihuanaba, which means 'horrible woman'; being condemned to wander the countryside, appearing to men as a beautiful woman and by the time they got close she would reveal a hideous horse face. He has always been seen more frequently on roads, rivers, fields, and elsewhere. Its victims are mainly infidels, whom it attracts to drive them crazy or kill them. Also, as in Guatemala, it appears to young children.\n\nIn the state of Coahuila, within the city of Torreón, this terrible specter that frightens men would actually be a woman who received a curse or was the victim of witchcraft, black magic or a satanic ritual, so it would be an evil or a demonic entity seeking \"revenge\". In preference, they appear to lustful, womanizing or night owls. Another version tells that it was a beautiful young woman who received a curse, turning her into this being; condemned to be with her woman's body and horse's head. The young woman would be normal, but when they approached her, her face would become that of a horse and everyone would run away from fright, so she would never find true love and be alone forever.\n\nIn the state of Nuevo León, they say that he is seen on the roads at night in search of punishing machistas, gangsters, womanizers, lustful or any man who goes astray to kill him. It is also said to cause accidents.\n\nIn Mexico City, according to the Mexica, the Macihuatli was the deity of the moon called Metztli, who pains the betrayal of her husband Tláloc. Other versions indicate that she was a woman of lousy behavior, which is why she was cursed by her husband or her father-in-law to wander as a ghost hunting men. Today, in some versions, she is described as a woman with a skull similar to that of a horse and with legs of a horse, which is beautiful at first glance, but up close is a monstrous being. In colonial legends she frightened the night owl, the rapist or the woman who walked in bad steps taking them to ravines and then killing him. Inclusively, there is the story of a supposed encounter of Hernán Cortés with this creature.\n\nIn the state of Puebla, it is known as the Andalona, where it is described as a spectrum that has multiple forms; he is said to seduce men who roam the mountains in order to drive them mad or kill them. Some say he dresses in white, has chicken feet and floats in the air.\n\nIn the state of Guerrero, I am known as the Chaneca, where it is said to be the fruit of a relationship between a common woman and a chaneque. She was given the opportunity to get to know the outside world. Like her father, she was very much in love but the men rejected her. For that reason, she decides to take revenge on men by seducing them and then killing them.\n\nIn Oaxaca, where he is known as the Matlazihua or Bandolera, he is associated with a \"Zapotec\" deity of death, formerly known as Mictecacihuatl. According to the old belief, this was the one that reigned and was in charge of collecting the souls of the deceased to take them to the underworld and was the husband of Mictlantecuhtli, the lord of the dead. It is also believed to be the soul in pain of a woman who was cruel and murderous, and wanders in this world by way of punishment. This specter is said to punish people's wrongdoings, or sins, but it generally appears to men (who would be drunkards, womanizers, partygoers, or those who abandon their families). She appears to them as a beautiful woman -of mixed race-, who draws them towards a ravine and when they approach her she reveals her horse face (or human skull, according to other versions; although also most of the time she is never seen face), which causes the man to fall into the ravine - leading them to suicide - and into the thorns so that they can bleed to death, although there are times when the victim survives, waking up in the thorns, in pain and without remembering anything that happened. other versions that say that the Matlazihua bathes or combs in the rivers of Oaxaca and whoever invades their space or takes their comb suffers the consequences. In other versions, like the Guatemalan and Nicaraguan versions, it is stated that she is not a single being, but that there are several that even cooperate with each other to scare her victim, communicate with each other with whistles and leave the men stunned.\n\nIn the state of Durango it is better known as the Caballona, where it also appears to men with sinful behavior. Here it devours or warns them. In the state of Jalisco, she is generally described as a woman dressed entirely in black, and she also appears to lovers and drunkards.\n\nIn the state of Aguascalientes, especially in the city of Calvillo, it is believed that the horse-faced woman was a beautiful woman who was unfaithful to him with many suitors (or with her lover, according to other versions). But, one day, the husband discovered her doing one of her infidelities with her lover, who, in an incredible state of jealousy, killed her lover. In the meantime, he tied his hands with a rope and, holding her by the horse, he made a swift run. This caused the poor woman to be seriously injured and her face was disfigured, which looked like a horse. The injuries were so severe that he ended up dying. Since then, it is said that, at night, an attractive woman can be seen walking who seduces men with bad behavior (especially unfaithful men), as punishment; to later reveal that he has a horse's face. In the town square, there is a monument of the Horse Face Woman, of which many of the inhabitants do not know the legend and its origin.\n\nIn the southeast of the republic they call it the Xtabay or Xtabal, which is, according to Mayan legend, an evil spirit that lives in ceiba trees and seduces anyone who comes near some of these trees. This was a Mayan goddess, dominated as Íxtab, who was the goddess of the hanged, the latter rewarded suicides with heaven but, with the arrival of Christianity, she is now the punisher of those already mentioned and a demon woman who scares the men. A second version tells that it was a Mayan princess named Suluay, daughter of Governor Halach Huinic, who had fallen in love with a young warrior and they saw each other in a ceiba tree. And that it was sent by the granddaughter of a witch, who spell it killing her immediately. Then they left the body in the bush. Although there are other versions that say that warrior was an assistant to the witch to help her kill Suluay. Well, whatever the origin of the Xtabay, it is said that it is a woman who appears in the ceibo trees, combing her long black hair, waiting for a man to approach her and start seducing them, to later reveal her true identity: demonic-looking and face with horse features (disfigured face or a pale woman's face with yellow eyes and snake tongue, according to other versions). Sometimes he lets them go, which drives them crazy or, at other times, they die of fright. Sometimes, she is seen as a punisher for drunks, womanizers and infidels, whom she chooses because they are easier to deceive and catch.\n\nAn important version is the concan version (from the town of Concá) of Querétaro of the Siguanaba, where it is said that it appears in a lake, under a bridge, which is known as the \"Puente del Sapo\", there it is He says that the Siguanaba appears as a beautiful woman who bathes naked to attract men, and always turns her back. The men approaching start talking while trying to see his face, many despair after waiting for a while to see his face; reason why many pull it, showing that, that woman who was supposed to have a beautiful face, has a horse's head that smiles at them maliciously, for which many flee. And the demonic spirit stays to continue its \"ritual of conquest\". Many, at night, fear and avoid passing by so that the horrifying appearance comes out and fear that the legend is true.\n\nFinally, there is the Chiapas version (from the state of Chiapas). In this last version, it is known as the Nöwayomo, Tisigua or Tishanila. In some regions or places it is considered as an evil spirit and in others as a benign spirit. It is said that she is the wife of the Sombrerón. It is said that it appears to men who are unfaithful, bathes in any lake and when they approach it she reveals a demonized horse face (or a disfigured face according to the best known versions) that kills them or lets them go. Many of the unfortunate ones who have seen it change forever. Many of their relatives notice that they no longer eat and see that, in a corner or anywhere, they are seen sitting or standing waiting for the Tisigua or Tishanila. In other regions of Chiapas, it is also said that the Siguanaba may appear on the roads asking motorcyclists to climb it and, after a while of walking, it transforms into a monster with the head of a horse. In other regions it is known like the Yegualcíhuatl who, like the Mayan and Oaxacan version, bewitches men with her beautiful body, she always leads them to a ravine and then begins to throw them off the cliff by causing them to fall down the ravine - leading them to suicide -. It is said that they see that the woman, instead of walking, is floating through the air, but they do not give so much importance to wanting to reach her. In addition, some also sign that she is accompanied by the Cadejo and together they are in charge of punishing by scaring men of bad life.\n\nIn Honduras it is known as \"La Sucia\" or Cigua. The popular story of a beautiful young woman denied marriage at the altar because she was unbaptized. She then wandered out of mind, never removing her increasingly filthy wedding dress until she died of heartbreak after her suitor married another. The story follows that she appears in beautiful form to lure men roaming drunk by rivers and streams, so enraptured by her beauty they follow her until she changes into a filthy horror that drives men crazy.\n\nIn Costa Rica, this spectrum is known by the name of Cegua, a spectrum (colloquially, fright) that is characterized because its face is that of a dead horse in a state of decomposition. In this country, La Cegua is a myth that is present more than anything else in rural areas, although its actions are eminently the same as in the rest of Mexico and Central America (especially in relation to its habit of bathing at night), La Cegua has the peculiarity that sometimes it also appears among herds of horses, mounted on one of these, which causes panic. Other popular versions say that the Cegua appears on the roads as a beautiful woman before the womanizers or drunkards, who are asked to take her to her horse (car or motorcycle, according to the most modern versions). She is described as a very pretty young woman, white (or brunette, depending on the version), with an oval face, large black eyes, long curly black hair and a beautiful mouth, with lips red as blood, with a divine voice that lulls like siren song, and body with pronounced curves, slender and tempting. She is dressed in full black or white, and on some occasions, in a vaporous pink dress, and in other versions, with a luxurious period dress.\n\nLegend has it that no man can resist such a beautiful body and sweet plea, which makes them climb it. Once climbing the woman, after a while of calbalgar, it transforms into a monster with a head similar to that of a horse. La Cegua also appears to those womanizing men who walk late at night on the street, she appears to them and with her sweetness makes him believe that it is a new conquest but at one point shows his horse face. Another important version is that the Cegua can also appear in the form of a child who cries inconsolably on the side of the road or near a river, and when the rider picks him up and puts him on the horse to calm him, he transforms into the monster with horse face. Regarding the origin of the character in the Costa Rican territory, it is believed or believed that La Cegua was a young libertine who had been cursed by her mother when the girl had tried to hit her, as she was denied permission to go to a party. Still others also affirm that it is a demonic manifestation, like that of the Devil. \n\nIn the province of Guanacaste, also in Costa Rica, La Cegua, in addition to appearing to men on the roads, could also appear at dances and festivals in the towns, where he flirts with every man who approaches him. The one who manages to conquer her, accompanies her to the clearing of the Guanacaste pampa, and under a leafy Guanacaste tree, surrender to her love affairs, until late at night, when the man finally tries to kiss her, the metamorphosis occurs.\n\nIn Nicaragua, it is also known as the Cegua (or also Ceguanaba or Ceguanagua). In this country, Cegua is also more present in rural areas and its actions are the same as in other countries; It is said that she is a witch who was betrayed by her partner and that she is looking for revenge against the womanizing men and night owls, for which she would make a pact with the devil in a cornfield, where she would make a ritual to vomit her soul and begin his transformation, first transforming his face into that of a skeletal mare. Following that, the rest of her body transforms: her legs become as long and robust as a horse's hind legs, her feet get bigger, and the same goes for her arms, giving her great physical strength and speed, which will ensure you do not let your victim escape. Thus, with this transformation, the Cegua would walk through the fields in search of womanizers and night owls to punish them. When the rider or night owl is not cautious, the Cegua would ambush him first, playing with him, then tormenting him but not killing him immediately. The specter seizes the man and bites his cheek to mark him as an adulterer, leaving him crazy and scared to death. Of those who were left alive, they remain in a state of idiocy. From there, the Nicaraguan popular saying derives: \"It is played by Cegua.\" There are also stories that the Cegua is not just one, but several ceguas that can even cooperate to catch their victim. Other versions include Mesoamerican horror as a beautiful girl who, when the man approaches, turns into a horrendous old woman.\n\nThere is also another version of the legend, located in the department of León, which describes her as an ugly and old woman, long white hair, with her tits up to her stomach and who laughs mockingly. When she has her victim, who are men and boys, trapped, she offers him one of her boobs; It terrifies her until it drives her crazy. And still today, it is said that the Cegua also appears in the trees of Guanascaste, where a womanizer or late-night waiter awaits under a beautiful veil. When the man approaches, she lifts her veil, showing a horrible skull face in a decomposed state.\n\nIn Panama, this entity is known as the Empollerada Woman. As in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, it is said to punish drunk and womanizing men who travel by transport. She is described as a woman of great beauty who is very brooding, and very well groomed; hence its name. Upon seeing her, she would convince the man to put her on his horse (or car, according to the most modern accounts). The man, then, when turning to look lasciviously at the young woman, finds that he has mounted his horse on a spectrum that, where he previously had the head of a woman, now presents himself with the face of a human skull (or, in the most versions, such as a hatched skeleton). Thus scaring the man who is upset with fear before that terrifying specter. The origin of the ghost tells that it was a woman who committed suicide because her boyfriend or lover was unfaithful to her and, therefore, her spirit wanders in search of revenge, punishing womanizers and drunkards as her partner was.\n\nOther spellings are: Cihuanaba, Sihuanaba, Ciguanaba, Ciguapa.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1897043", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1897043", "title": "LWS (aircraft manufacturer)", "text": "LWS (aircraft manufacturer)\n\nLWS - Lubelska Wytwórnia Samolotów (\"Lublin Aircraft Factory\") was the Polish aerospace manufacturer, located in Lublin, created in 1936 of Plage i Laśkiewicz works and producing aircraft between 1936 and 1939. \n\nThe LWS was created of a nationalized Plage i Laśkiewicz works, the first Polish aircraft manufacturer. Due to plans of the Polish aviation authorities, headed by Ludomił Rayski, to gather all aviation industry in state hands, Plage & Laśkiewicz works were forced to go bankrupt in late 1935. Then, they were nationalized under the name LWS in February 1936. Formally, it was owned by the PWS state aircraft manufacturer, in fact it was subordinated to the PZL. A director was Maj. Aleksander Sipowicz, a technical director and main designer was initially Zbysław Ciołkosz; from autumn 1937 the technical director was Ryszard Bartel and the main designer Jerzy Teisseyre.\n\nThe first LWS aircraft were Plage & Laśkiewicz developments. 18 almost ready Lublin R-XIIIF army cooperation aircraft were completed in 1936 and bought by the Polish Air Force (their quality was the pretext for forcing Plage & Laśkiewicz bankruptcy), and the next series of 32 was built for the Polish Air Force by 1938. The factory also continued works upon a two-engine torpedo bomber seaplane Lublin R-XX prototype, now designated LWS-1, but it was not ordered due to a low performance.\n\nIn 1937 a light ambulance aircraft LWS-2 prototype of Ciołkosz design was first flown, but despite it was quite successful, it did not enter production, since the factory was busy with military orders. \n\nIn 1936, a further development of the medium bomber PZL-30 of Ciołkosz design, was handed to the LWS, under a designation LWS-6 Żubr. Since it was much inferior to PZL.37 Łoś, a planned serial production was finally reduced to 15 aircraft, built in 1938. However, works upon its modernized variant continued until 1939. The factory also proposed its torpedo-bomber seaplane variant designated LWS-5, but it was not accepted due to a low performance and the prototype was not completed.\n\nFrom 1938 to 1939 the LWS built a series of 65 licence RWD-14 Czapla army cooperation aircraft for the Polish Air Force (it was sometimes called the LWS Czapla after the manufacturer). In 1937, there was flown a prototype of a modern reconnaissance aircraft LWS-3 Mewa of own design. A series of 200 aircraft was ordered by the Polish Air Force, but only a couple were completed just after the outbreak of World War II, and about 30 were in not finished state in a factory. \n\nApart from aircraft production, the LWS modified 47 light bombers Potez XXV (licence produced in Plage & Laśkiewicz and PWS) fitting them with radial engines PZL (Bristol) Jupiter. The LWS also designed the LWS-4 light fighter and LWS-7 Mewa II reconnaissance plane, but they were not built. \n\n\n"}

It was depopulated during the 1947–1948 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine on the order of the Haganah. From 1948 to 1951, a temporary Jewish cemetery was established here; a few hundred graves still remain from that time. After 1949, the area was incorporated into a new area called Givat Ram.\n\nThere are claims that the Hebrew University of Jerusalem at Givat Ram, the Supreme Court of Israel, and the Jerusalem International Convention Center were built on land formerly belonging to the village. The counter-claim is that the Knesset was built on land leased from the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem.\n\nSheikh Badr was on a hilltop south of Jaffa Road, extending from the present-day Hebrew University of Jerusalem at Givat Ram to the Jerusalem International Convention Center (Binyanei HaUma). Its western flank was bordered to the north by the Jewish neighborhood of Romema, founded in 1921, placing it close to the entrance to the city of Jerusalem.\n\nAn Ottoman village list of about 1870 described \"Schech Bedr\" as a Muslim Wali in Jerusalem, with ruins from earlier settlements.\n\nDuring the British Mandate for Palestine, Sheikh Badr was a semi-rural Arab village in western Jerusalem which benefited from its proximity to the major Jewish neighborhoods and thus increased employment opportunities. The villagers grew wheat in what is now Sacher Park.\n\nThe final months of the British Mandate saw the British turn a blind eye to Arab attacks on Jewish areas. During the 1947–1948 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine, the Haganah set in motion a plan to occupy (and if met with resistance, evacuate) Arab villages in order to protect nearby Jewish communities and to strengthen the Jewish hold on these sites. Sheikh Badr and Lifta were the first Arab villages to undergo mass evacuation. To create a \"general air of insecurity\" that would speed up the process, the Lehi blew up the home of the village mukhtar, Haj Suleiman Hamini, on January 11, 1948. Two days later Haganah launched another raid on Sheikh Badr, damaging 20 houses. The Arab residents evacuated Sheikh Badr between January 14 and 19, after which British policemen came in to guard the vacated homes. However, Jews from the neighborhood of Nahlaot made several raids on the deserted village, destroying and setting fire to remaining property.\n\nUntil 1948, Jewish burials in Jerusalem were conducted in the centuries-old Jewish cemetery on the Mount of Olives. In January 1948, the Arab siege of Jerusalem made the Mount of Olives inaccessible, as the route to the cemetery passed through hostile Arab villages. After war broke out in May 1948, two temporary burial grounds were opened in central Jerusalem – one in Sheikh Badr and the other on the grounds of the first Shaare Zedek Hospital.\n\nThe Sheikh Badr cemetery functioned as a temporary burial ground from its opening in May 31, 1948 through late 1950. Unlike regular Jewish burials in Israel in which the deceased is placed directly into the grave, the deceased in Sheikh Badr were placed in wooden caskets above-ground to expedite their removal once the war ended. An adjoining quarry was also used for burials; here, bodies were buried in three layers, one atop the other, with a layer of dirt between each one. In late 1950, approximately 300 soldiers buried in the cemetery were reinterred on Mount Herzl, and 600 civilians were reinterred on Har HaMenuchot. In mid-1955, the decision was made to bury the remaining bodies in the Sheikh Badr cemetery in earth and to erect a headstone over each grave.\n\nIn 1949 Sheikh Badr was incorporated into a larger area renamed Givat Ram. \n\nArchaeological excavations indicate that the area of Sheikh Badr was inhabited from Iron Age II to the Byzantine period (late 8th century BCE to early 7th century CE). It appears to have been \"strategically located at the top of the ascent from the coastal plain (or descent for those leaving the Old City of Jerusalem)\". Digs were carried out in 1949, 1968 and 1992-1993.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1897061", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1897061", "title": "Lakehurst Mall", "text": "Lakehurst Mall\n\nLakehurst Mall was the first regional shopping complex in the northern Chicago suburb of Waukegan. The mall officially opened in 1971. It was built to service the growing town of Waukegan, the Great Lakes Naval Training Center, and the northern suburban sprawl of Chicago. After several years of decline, Lakehurst closed in 2001, and was demolished in 2004.\n\nIn December 1968, of farmland close to the busy Tri-State Tollway was purchased from Thomas E. Wilson/Edellyn Farms for $2 million, and annexed into Waukegan, Illinois. Construction on the mall began about one year later, in September 1969. A five-year research project of Lake County had concluded that Lake County would be one of the fastest developing areas of the Midwest. The mixed-use (commercial/office/residential) development including Lakehurst Mall was built to service this new population.\n\nThe mall was designed by Sidney H. Morris and Associates of Chicago and Gruen Associates of Los Angeles; Gruen was a well-known name in mall construction, dating from their pioneering 1956 design of Southdale Center in Edina, Minnesota. Initially, Arthur Rubloff & Co. of Chicago was the management and leasing agent for Lakehurst.\n\nThe new 1.1 million square feet (102,000 m²) mall was substantially larger than other malls in the area. There were three major department stores and about 100 smaller stores. A convenience center, which included the Chicago-native grocery store Jewel-Osco, was added to the original plan, as were over 6,000 parking spaces.\n\nThe mall officially opened on August 19, 1971. Over 5,000 people attended the opening day ceremonies, including the mayor of Waukegan.\nOutparcels of the mall site were developed into the General Cinema Lakehurst 12 movie theatre (which opened in 1974) and restaurants such as Red Lobster. An apartment complex with over 200 rental units was completed by the mid-1970s.\n\nA Marriott hotel was added to the area, and Pier 1 Imports and Service Merchandise were built on outparcels.\n\nJacobs, Visconsi, and Jacobs, of Cleveland, Ohio bought the general areas of the mall and the convenience center from Arthur Rubloff in October 1982. (The anchor properties were owned by their respective department stores.)\n\nThe J. C. Penney Auto Shop closed in 1983 as part of a national decision by JC Penney to leave the auto repair business. \nThe Globe Company, a local Lake County company, founded in 1898, went bankrupt and closed in 1985.\n\nIn August 1986, the Wieboldt's anchor went out of business, prior to the eventual closure of the entire chain. Wieboldt's management blamed the closure on the extensive distance between this store and their Chicago distribution hub, which incurred substantial expenses. The company sold their location to the Jacobs Group. The location being vacant came as a blessing when 1986 brought floods to Gurnee, Illinois, severely damaging two of the city's three elementary schools. Students in kindergarten through fourth grade were housed in the sole undamaged elementary school, while more than 600 fifth through eighth grade students were housed in the old Wieboldt's space. The space was informally known as \"Wieboldt U\" during that time, and the former store's shelving units were used for school storage.\n\nAfter the school was renovated and the \"Wieboldt U\" students left, Dunham's Sports became an anchor on the lower level; several months later, Montgomery Ward moved into the upper level and built a new auto service center on an outparcel. The Montgomery Ward store had previously been located in the Belvidere Mall a few miles down Route 120. With the major anchor at Belvidere Mall gone, most thought that Belvidere Mall would close soon. It turned out that Lakehurst would close before Belvidere.\n\nOn August 8, 1991, Gurnee Mills opened seven miles (11 km) away from Lakehurst. The newer, larger Gurnee Mills proved a much larger draw than expected, devastating Lakehurst's retail base.\n\nThe mall had 100 tenants at the beginning of the 1990s, but by 1997, about fifty businesses remained. In early 1998, both Montgomery Ward and JCPenney pulled out of Lakehurst, leaving Carson Pirie Scott as the sole anchor. The Jacobs Group sold Lakehurst in the summer of 1998; the price was $30 million, a little less than that of the sale price in 1982.\n\nFewer than five tenants remained by 2000. These included the Gift Tree and Barbary Coast stores in the mall, as well as the Carson Pirie Scott anchor. When the leases on the two mall stores ended on January 31, 2001, most of the mall was shuttered, and only Carson's was in operation. During the mall's final days, a portion of the film \"'77\" was filmed inside the former KB Toys building.\n\nOwnership changed from the Jacobs Group to the Shaw Company of Oak Brook, Illinois. A phased demolition began near the JCPenney store in November 2003. Carson's stayed open for the Christmas season and closed on January 15, 2004. Demolition of the JCPenney section was completed February 2004, followed by the Wieboldt's/Montgomery Ward section, then the Carson's section, and ended with the gazebo of the Wieboldts anchor, which had outlasted the anchor.\n\n"}

{"id": "1897067", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1897067", "title": "Health of Pope John Paul II", "text": "Health of Pope John Paul II\n\nPope John Paul II entered the papacy in 1978 as an avid sportsman, enjoying hiking and swimming. The 58-year-old was extremely healthy and active for his age, jogging in the Vatican gardens to the horror of Vatican staff, who informed him that his jogging could be seen by tourists climbing to the summit of the dome of St. Peter's Basilica. The pope's response, according to media reports, was \"so what?\" When the cost of installing a swimming pool in his summer residence was queried by cardinals, John Paul joked that it was \"cheaper than another conclave\".\n\nJohn Paul's obvious physical fitness and looks earned much comment in the media following his election, which compared his health and trim figure to the poor health of John Paul I and Paul VI, the portliness of Pope John XXIII and the constant claims of ailments of Pius XII. The only modern pope with a keep-fit regime had been Pope Pius XI (r: 1922-1939) who was an avid mountain climber. An \"Irish Independent\" article in the 1980s labelled John Paul \"the keep-fit pope\".\n\nHowever, after over twenty-five years on the papal throne, two assassination attempts (one of which resulted in severe physical injury to the Pope), and a number of cancer scares, John Paul's physical health declined.\n\nThe 1981 assassination attempt was costlier to his overall health than was generally known by the public at the time. Rushed to the Agostino Gemelli University Polyclinic to undergo emergency surgery, he experienced profound bleeding leading to a dangerous fall in blood pressure and to cardiac arrest, which was however successfully defibrillated. He received the Anointing of the Sick (formerly known as \"Last Rites\"). Despite difficulties with extensive blood transfusions, which are speculated to have transmitted cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, surgery was eventually successful. The bullet had passed completely through the body, puncturing the intestines and necessitating a colostomy. Seven weeks later, discussions were held about reversing the colostomy and eight of nine doctors voted against it, arguing the Pope was still too weak from the CMV infection. Saying \"I don't want to continue half dead and half alive\", the Pope effectively overruled his physicians and the reversal was done successfully on August 5, 1981.\n\nDespite the shooting and the complications during recovery, John Paul remained in good physical condition throughout the 1980s, and remained active as well. During the 1990s John Paul's health began to decline. A benign intestinal tumor was removed in 1992; he experienced two falls in 1993 and 1994 which dislocated his shoulder and broke his femur respectively; and he underwent an appendectomy in 1996. In December 1995, he had to suspend his \"urbi et orbi\" blessing on Christmas Day after a dizzy spell.\n\nAn orthopaedic surgeon confirmed in 2001 that Pope John Paul II was suffering from Parkinson's disease, as international observers had suspected for some time; this was acknowledged publicly by the Vatican in 2003. Despite difficulty speaking more than a few sentences at a time, trouble hearing and severe osteoarthrosis, he continued to tour the world, although rarely walking in public. Some of those who met him late in his life said that although physically he was in poor shape, mentally he remained fully alert.\n\nHowever, that claim was disputed by among others Rowan Williams, the Archbishop of Canterbury, and Mary McAleese, the President of Ireland, in their accounts of meetings with him in 2003. After John Paul II's death, Williams told \"The Sunday Times\" of a meeting with the Pope, during which he had paid tribute to one of John Paul's encyclicals. According to Williams, John Paul II showed no recognition . An aide whispered in the pope's ear, but was overheard reminding John Paul about the encyclical. However the Pope still showed no recognition. Papal critic John Cornwell claimed that, after Williams and his entourage left, the Pope turned to an aide and asked \"tell me, who were those people?\"\n\nAccording to Cornwell, Mary McAleese told the British Catholic newspaper \"The Universe\" of a visit as President of Ireland to John Paul where he struggled to talk about the Irish College in Rome, where Irish seminarians in the city are trained and to which the Pope prior to his election had often travelled. \"He wanted to be reminded of where the Irish College was, and when he heard that it was very close to St. John Lateran's basilica he wanted to be reminded where that was too.\"\n\nOn 1 February 2005, the Pope was taken to the Gemelli Hospital suffering from acute inflammation and spasm of the larynx, brought on by a bout of influenza. He was released, but in late February 2005 he began having trouble breathing, and he was rushed back. A tracheotomy was performed, allowing him to breathe more easily, but limiting his speaking ability, to which he reacted with evident frustration during a failed attempt at public speaking from the window of the hospital ward.\n\nOn Palm Sunday (20 March 2005) the Pope made a brief appearance at his window and silently waved an olive branch to pilgrims. Two days later there were renewed concerns for his health after reports stated that he had taken a turn for the worse and was not responding to medication. By the end of the month, speculation was growing. The Vatican officials confirmed that he was nearing death when on March 31, 2005 at around 11:00 am, the pope, who had gone to the chapel to celebrate Mass, was beset by strong shivers which was followed by high fever because of a urinary tract infection. Despite the use of antibiotics, the disease continued and he developed sepsis and multiple organ failure. He was not rushed to the hospital again, however, and equipment for medical monitoring was brought to his residence in the Vatican, where he was followed by a team of top physicians. On 2 April 2005 at 9:37 pm, he died in his apartment at 84 years and 319 days of age, 46 days before his 85th birthday. The pope is reported to have died looking towards the window as he prayed, raising his right hand as if he is aware of the crowds present in St. Peter's Square where he made an effort to say \"Amen\" and his life ended. The illumination of a third light in the papal apartment makes some onlookers in the square knew that the end had come. His death was confirmed when an electrocardiogram signal remained flat for more than 20 minutes.\n\nThe Pope was the third-longest serving Pope ever in history, after the first Pope St. Peter and Pope Pius IX. He died after 26 years and 162 days of papacy. He was buried in presence of millions on 8 April 2005.\n"}

It is the administrative centre of the Nyasvizh District (\"rajon\") of Minsk Region and site of Niasviž Castle a World Heritage Site. Its 2009 population is 14,300.\n\nNesvizh was first documented in 1223, becoming after the Union of Krewo (1385) part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and in 1569 part of the Republic of the Two Nations. In the 15th century, while still a minor town, it belonged to the Kiszka family and later to the Radziwiłł family, and remained the family's seat until 1813. \n\nIn 1561 or 1562 Maciej Kawęczyński founded the print works of the Polish Brethren. The first Belarusian language book printed in Latin script, a catechism by Symon Budny, was published in Nesvizh in 1562. The \"Nieśwież Bible\" (\"\"), one of the oldest Polish translations of the Bible, also by Budny, was completed there in 1571 and published in 1572.\n\nNesvizh Castle was erected in 1583, and between 1584 and 1598 the Benedictines and Jesuit religious orders founded monasteries and a college. At the request of Mikołaj \"the Orphan\" Radziwiłł Nieśwież was granted Magdeburg town rights by King Stephen Báthory in 1586. Two epidemics affected the city early in the 17th century which led to the establishment of a pharmacy in 1627.\n\nDuring the Great Northern War of 1700–21, the city was significantly damaged by Swedish troops. It was rebuilt in the 1720s by Michał \"Rybeńko\" Radziwiłł. In the aftermath of the war, in 1740s and 1750s he founded a \"Pas slucki\" factory which was later moved to Sluck. He introduced a military school, several textile factories and restored the Corpus Christi Church and opened a print works. Michał's wife, Franciszka Urszula Radziwiłłowa, founded the \"Nieśwież Radziwiłł Theatre\", including a choir and a ballet school.\n\nBetween 1764 and 1768 the city was occupied by Russian troops, and in 1772, at the First Partition of Lithuania-Poland, the library, which comprised circa 10,000 volumes, along with paintings and other art objects, was seized and transferred to St. Petersburg. Some books from the library were passed to the Russian Academy of Sciences.\n\nAfter the Second partition of Lithuania-Poland in 1793, Nieśwież was annexed by Russia, and renamed \"Nesvizh\". In 1906, the Polish Society \"Oświata\" (\"Education\") in Nesvizh was established, but its activities were hampered by the Russian administration, before banning it at the start of 1910. In 1912 the Russian authorities also liquidated the \"Roman Catholic Charity Society\" in Nesvizh.\n\nAfter the fall of tsarist Russia, fighting broke out for control over the city and surrounding region. During the Soviet occupation (Polish–Soviet War), the unsuccessful Nieśwież uprising by Polish residents took place during March 14–19, 1919. However, Nieśwież was recaptured by Poles on April 19, 1919 and re-integrated with the reestablished Polish state. It was became a powiat in the Nowogródek Voivodeship until the Soviet invasion of Poland in September 1939. During World War II, from 1939 to 1941 it was under Soviet occupation, from 1941 to 1944 under German occupation, and from 1944 to 1945 under Soviet occupation again, before it was once more taken from the territory of Poland and annexed by the Soviet Union, in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement.\nNesvizh was part of:\n\nThe Jewish population in 1900 stood at 4,687,and approx. 4,500 on the eve of the German invasion, Operation Barbarossa. With the occupation from June 27, 1941, a Judenrat was established. On October 30, 4,000 of the town's Jews were murdered and the rest confined to a ghetto. On July 20, 1942, the ghetto was surrounded by Belorussian police and the German commander announced that the ghetto's population would be liquidated with the exception of 30 essential skilled workers. The ghetto's underground organization, based on a Soviet-era Zionist group, called an uprising armed only with one machine gun, small arms but mostly knives. Most of the Jews were killed. A few escaped to nearby forests and joined partisan units, such as the Zhukov Jewish partisan unit.\n\nNyasvizh is twinned with:\n\n\n\n"}

Together with Hans G. Kresse's \"Eric de Noorman\" and Pieter Kuhn's \"Kapitein Rob\" it is regarded as the Big Three of Dutch comics.\n\n\"Tom Poes\" was a funny animal comic, published in text comics format. The main protagonists are Tom Poes, a white anthropomorphic cat, and his best friend, lord Oliver B. Bumble (\"Olivier B. Bommel\" in Dutch). The series is sometimes referred to as the \"Bommelsaga\" as well. Toonder received many awards and honorary distinctions for both his illustrations and literary output. In the Netherlands \"Tom Poes\" became regarded as a work of literature.\n\nIn 1931 Marten Toonder was in Buenos Aires, Argentina, where he met Jim Davis, a former assistant of Pat Sullivan and Otto Messmer, creators of Felix the Cat, who taught him some lessons in drawing comics.\n\nOn March 16, 1941 the first \"Tom Poes\" comic, \"Het Geheim der Blauwe Aarde\" (\"The Secret of the Blue Earth\") was published in the newspaper \"De Telegraaf\", written and drawn by Toonder, replacing the Mickey Mouse comic in 1941. Tom Poes himself was already created in July 1939.\n\nThe name of the character is a pun on the Dutch pastry \"tompouce\" and was thought up by Toonder's wife, Phiny Dick. On December 18 of that same year the series was published in the two-weekly Czech magazine \"Punta\". After the war the stories were published in \"NRC Handelsblad\", \"De Volkskrant\", \"Ons Vrij Nederland\", \"Revue\" and \"Donald Duck\". In daily newspapers \"Tom Poes\" was published as a text comic, like most Dutch comics at the time. In the weekly magazines it was published in balloon format.\n\n\"Tom Poes\" features many anthropomorphic characters who are satirical representations of animal stereotypes, though some human characters like gnomes and wizards exist too. The series is set in a fantasy world of an undetermined age. Some elements are modern, like cars and television sets, others are more reminiscent of older centuries.\n\n\"Tom Poes\" was originally a children's comic, but as the stories progressed they aimed at a more adult audience by introducing satirical elements and eccentric use of language. Several of Toonder's words and expressions became neologisms in the Dutch language. In 1954 Toonder became member of the Maatschappij der Nederlandse Letterkunde (\"Society of Dutch literature\") and by the time the story \"De Bovenbazen\" (\"The Upper Bosses\") was published he was regarded as a creator of genuine quality literature. \"Tom Poes\" is still the only comic strip in the Netherlands to have gained such a reputation among the intelligentsia.\n\nThe success of the series spread to many merchandising products, including theatrical plays and a comics magazine. Toonder founded his own studio and collected several talented artists to assist him with the drawing of \"Tom Poes\", while he still wrote the stories. Among these were Lo Hartog van Banda, Piet Wijn and Dick Matena. From the time Toonder settled down in Ireland in 1965 to the end of \"Tom Poes\" in 1986, Toonder reportedly drew \"Tom Poes\" almost singlehandedly, having grown weary of running a large studio.\n\nThe series was also translated and published in Belgium, Denmark, England, Finland, France, Germany, Indonesia, Ireland and Sweden.\n\n\nDutch names.\n\nIn 1983 an animated film based on the comics was released: \"The Dragon That Wasn't (Or Was He?)\".\n\nFrom 2007 to 2010 \"Tom Poes\" was adapted into a series of audio plays broadcast on the Dutch radio channels NPO Radio 6, NPO Radio 6 and NPO Radio 1.\n\nOn July 12, 2002 a six-meter public monument was built in Rotterdam, honoring several characters from the franchise. It was designed by D.J. Chantelle, Pepijn van den Nieuwendijk, Hans van Bentem and Luuk Bode.\n\n"}

It was built in 1963 to replace the Old Gymnasium, a then-60-year-old facility now known as the Royall Tyler Theater. It is used mainly as the home arena of the Vermont Catamounts men's and women's basketball teams. It has been the site of the 2004, 2005, 2007, 2010, 2013, 2017, 2018 and 2019 America East men's basketball tournament championship games, as the higher seed in the final hosts the game. The championship games were all televised on ESPN or ESPN2. Vermont has consistently been among the America East leaders in home attendance and in 2004–05, it became the only America East men's basketball program to sell out every game for an entire season.\n\nPatrick Gym is also a concert venue, seating up to 4,000. It can also accommodate conventions and trade shows; there are of arena floor space, with an additional at the indoor track and at the indoor tennis courts, both of which are adjacent to Patrick Gymnasium. The current bleachers at Patrick Gym were installed in 1982, and new lighting and the current floor were installed in 1990.\n\nCurrently the university has plans to replace the over 50 year old Patrick Gym with a new event center next to Gutterson Fieldhouse. The new arena will have a capacity of 3,200 with a price tag of $80 million. It was announced in December 2018 that the new arena will be named The Tarrant Event Center, in honor of Rich and Deb Tarrant who donated 15 million dollars to the project. The arena will be ready for the 2020-2021 athletic season.\n\nPatrick Gym is also used as the venue for the Vermont State Division I Boys and Girls Basketball Championship semifinals and final. The Boston Celtics held their training camp at Patrick Gym prior to the start of the 2004–05 NBA season. \nIn the 1960s, the Celtics played several exhibition games at Patrick Gym.\n\nThe gym has played host to many America East championship games because of Vermont men's basketball success in the conference tournament. On March 10, 2018 Vermont hosted UMBC in the America East Championship game. Jairus Lyles hit the game winning three pointer to clinch the America East Championship and advance to the NCAA Tournament, which would later turn out to be a historic run for UMBC.\n\nThe very next season, Vermont returned the favor by beating UMBC 66–49. It was the sixth time UVM had clinched the America East championship and a bid to the NCAA Tournament, and the fifth time they'd accomplished the feat at Patrick Gym.\n\n\n"}

The genus has a northern circumpolar distribution, and most of its members are typically cold-water fish that primarily inhabit fresh waters. Many species also migrate to the sea.\n\nMost char may be identified by light-cream, pink, or red spots over a darker body. Scales tend to be small, with 115-200 along the lateral line. The pectoral, pelvic, anal, and the lower aspect of caudal fins are trimmed in snow white or cream leading edges.\n\nMany members of this genus are popular sport fish, and a few, such as the lake trout (\"S. namaycush\"), are the object of commercial fisheries and aquaculture. Occasionally, such fish escape and become invasive species.\n\nDeepwater char are small species of char living below 80 m in the deep areas of certain lakes. They are highly sensitive to changes in the quality of the water and one species, \"Salvelinus neocomensis\", was driven to extinction in the twentieth century.\n\nAs with other salmonid genera, the delimitation of species in \"Salvelinus\" is controversial. FishBase in 2015 listed 54 species or subspecies in this genus, many of which have very narrow local distributions. Fourteen localised species are listed from the British Isles alone, although these traditionally, and still by the national conservation and fisheries authorities, are all considered to represent the widespread Arctic charr (\"S. alpinus\"). Twenty species are listed from the Asian part of Russia, including several localised taxa from in each of the Kamchatka, Chukotka and Taimyr peninsulas. One of these is the long-finned char, which phylogenetically is part of the \"Salvelinus\" group although it has been so far classified into another genus \"Salvethymus\".\n\nThe Arctic char (\"S. alpinus\") is the most broadly distributed \"Salvelinus\" species. It has a circumpolar distribution, and it is considered the most northern of all freshwater fishes. In North America, five relatively well defined species are present, which, apart from the Arctic char, comprise the brook trout (\"S. fontinalis\"), bull trout (\"S. confluentus\"), Dolly Varden trout (\"S. malma\") and lake trout (\"S. namaycush\").\nThis listing presents the taxa recognised in FishBase grouped by geography:\n\n\nScotland and adjacent islands:\n\nEngland and Wales:\nIreland:\nIceland and Atlantic islands:\nFennoscandia and Northwest Russia:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Its relation to the original Zip drive and disk is the floppy medium and relatively much higher capacity than standard floppy disks. It was known as the \"Clik!\" drive until the click of death class action lawsuit regarding mass failures of Iomega's Zip drives. Thenceforth, it was renamed to PocketZip. A 100 MB Pocket Zip drive version had been in the works, was intended to be backwards compatible with the 40 MB disks, but ended up being vaporware and PocketZip itself would be discontinued as well. \n\nThe PocketZip drive was available originally as a laptop PC card (PCMCIA) slot drive where it could compete with contemporary PC card, MicroDrive, CompactFlash and SmartMedia readers. A dock was available to connect this drive to a desktop computer's parallel port. Later, a USB version of the drive was also offered. It was marketed as a backup and portable storage solution, similar to the original Zip drive, but which could be installed completely inside a laptop computer, as PC cards typically slide completely inside the laptop computer and thus do not increase its dimensions, which also precludes the need for a power supply or cables.\n\nThe PocketZip media is a small, flexible disk inside of a thin metal casing, similar to that found on the shutter of a standard floppy disk. The disks usually came in small format-specific plastic cases, and the drive was also shipped for a while with a small hard metal case - identical, but unrelated to the Aluma Wallet - which could house the drive and two disks. The disks could be bent easily if too much force was applied, thereby completely damaging them.\n\nThe format was also used in a small number of consumer electronics devices such as mp3 players and digital cameras. These include the Iomega HipZip Digital Audio Player, the Sensory Science Rave MP 2300, and the Agfa ePhoto CL30 Clik. The format saw use in other devices as well but proved to be a commercial failure. It suffered heavy competition from flash-based memory cards. The PocketZip was electro-mechanical and, hence, not as reliable as solid-state flash memory cards which have no moving parts. Also, as the capacity and speed of flash memory storage increased and its costs decreased, the PocketZip lost viability as a portable storage solution.\n\n(from Iomega support site):\n\n\nAccording to the original documentation, Pocket Zip USB and PC Card work with Windows 95, Windows 98/98SE and Windows NT 4.0. Iomega provided USB mass storage support for Windows 95 with at least OSR2 (4.00.950B) for use with its Zip products. Under Windows NT 4, Pocket Zip PC Card only works with certain PC Card controllers (which ones are not named by Iomega). Pocket Zip USB also works with Mac OS 8.x, but the PC card version is specified as not working with Apple computers. \n\nIn practice, the USB drive is a standard mass storage device, so it will also work on any modern operating system which can use such devices, including Windows XP, Vista and 7, Mac OS X and Linux. The PC card drive, similarly, is a standard removable ATA device, so it also will typically function without any problems on modern operating systems including Windows XP. The problem on the latest operating systems is unavailability or incompatibility of the software used to operate the proprietary features of the drive, such as low-level formatting and the software write protection.\n\n\n"}

Considered to be one of the leading portrait painters of the Dutch Golden Age, his elegant portraits gained him the patronage of Amsterdam's elite as well as the Stadtholder's circle. Besides portraits, van der Helst painted a few genre pictures as well as some biblical scenes and mythological subjects.\n\nBartholomeus van der Helst was born in Haarlem in 1613. His exact date of birth is not known as the birth records of Haarlem of that time are lost. He was the son of a Haarlem innkeeper called Lodewijk and his second wife, Aeltgen Bartels. Van der Helst had moved to Amsterdam some time before 1636, the year in which he married there Anna du Pire, an 18-year-old woman from a prosperous family from the Southern Netherlands who was already orphaned. The couple had six children of whom one called Lodewijk (1642 - c. 1684) became a portrait painter like his father.\n\nHis first dated picture, the , dates from 1637. The style of this painting suggests that in Amsterdam van der Helst may have trained with Nicolaes Eliaszoon Pickenoy. His first important commission was for a large \"schuttersstuk\" known as the . Van der Helst received the commission in 1639 and finished it in 1642. The large 7.5m wide canvas was hung over the fireplace of the grand assembly of the Kloveniers guild, the same room for which Rembrandt painted \"The Night Watch\". The success, which the artist achieved with this composition, led to many commissions for single and double portraits of Amsterdam's leading class such as his , the mayor of Amsterdam. The city's military brass and wealthy members of the regent class all had portraits made by van der Helst.\nEven though van der Helst was active in Amsterdam at the same time as Rembrandt, he was able to become the most popular portraitist in that city, through his elegant and flattering portrayals in the style of Anthony van Dyck. His work was considered more immediately appealing than the dark, intense and introspective work during this later period of Rembrandt. Rare among portrait artists in Amsterdam of his time, he was able to attract bourgeois patrons from other cities such as Rotterdam.\n\nHis large group portrait, \"Banquet of the Amsterdam Civic Guard in Celebration of the Peace of Münster\" (Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam), was painted in 1648, and exhibited to popular acclaim. It was this painting that sealed his fame for future generations, according to the Dutch artist biographer Arnold Houbraken. The painting was admired by Godfried Kneller and Joshua Reynolds. Van der Helst received a commission from the circle of the Stadtholder family, when he was asked in 1652 to paint the , the widow of William II, Prince of Orange.\nThe artist remained active throughout his life and maintained a high level of production until the end of his career. His late works such as the pendant portraits of and his \n\nHe was the teacher of his son Lodewijk who followed his style. Marcus Waltes was his pupil in 1650. He had no other known pupils but exerted an influence on Govert Flinck, \nEustache Lesueur, Constantin Hansen, Alexander Sanders and Abraham van den Tempel.\n\nThe artist died in Amsterdam in 1670. While the artist had been able to charge very high prices for his work, he appears to have lived above his means. He had bought a large house and acquired many paintings of leading artists such as Frans Floris, Simon de Vos, Goltzius, Adriaen Brouwer, Pieter Lastman, Gerard van Zyl, Simon de Vlieger, Hendrik Gerritsz Pot, Otto Marcelis and Willem van de Velde. After his death his wife was compelled to offer his works and those from his art collection for sale in 1671 in an advertisement in the Haarlems Dagblad.\n\nIn addition to the portraits for which he is most famous, Bartholomeus van der Helst painted a few genre, historical, biblical, mythological and allegorical scenes. In all these paintings, the portrait aspect is still important.\n\nBartholomeus van der Helst was principally a painter of portraits. The majority of his work is made up of individual portraits. He also painted family portraits, double portraits and pendant portraits. An example of the latter are the portraits of and his . Among his most prestigious assignments were the group portraits of Amsterdam 'schutters' (civil militia members) and regents. The most famous work in this category is his 1648 \"Banquet of the Amsterdam Civic Guard in Celebration of the Peace of Münster\" (Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam). In this large-scale composition depicting 25 people, van der Helst was able to do justice to each individual. He also realised a clear composition through his sophisticated use of light and color.\n\nAs a portrait painter to Amsterdam's elite, he created life-sized portraits, which responded to the demand of the patricians of Amsterdam for portraits that offered a good likeness rather than an idealized image. His style is characterized by clear drawing, plasticity, even lighting and a pleasant palette relying on light and clear tones. He preferred balanced compositions.\nHis early works show the influence of Pickenoy, his presumed master, and to a certain extent of Rembrandt. This is clear in the of 1638 (Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen). It shows a man reading a book who looks up at the viewer as if he has been disturbed, a motive derived from Rembrandt. The vivid representation of the sitter is characteristic of van der Helst's early work.\n\nVan der Helst found his own style in the 1640s. The dated 1642 (Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam) is typical his work from this period: it is well modeled, of a strong plasticity and painted with a barely visible brush stroke.\n\nThe fashion for the French elegant style was visible in his work after 1650. An example is the painted in 1654 (Mauritshuis, The Hague). This work was based on a self-portrait of Potter, which he had made shortly before his early death. The gestures and movements of the sitter in the painting are elegant. The artist has further succeeded in rendering the fabrics in a smooth painting style and almost perfect technique.\n\nThe paintings of the final years of van der Helst's career are characterized by increased attention to detail and a more even lighting. The subtlety and intensity that characterizes his earlier work has made way for a clarity of expression that leaves nothing to the imagination. The artist also used a more colourful palette and richer contrasts and emphasized more strongly the distinctions between dark and light tones.\nOne of van der Helst's most famous works is the portrait of Gerard Andriesz Bicker at half-length of 1639 (Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam). Van der Helst painted in 1642 a portrait of Andries Bicker, the father of Gerard Andriesz Bicker and the mayor of Amsterdam, as a pendant to this work. The contrast between the two sitters could not be more pronounced: while the father looks like a stern and sober Protestant, the son looks like a fanciful dandy with a smug look in his eyes. At the time the painting was made Gerard Andriesz Bicker was only 17 years old, but already held the titles of \"Lord of Engelenburg\" and \"High Bailiff of Muiden\".\n\nThis portrait is often used to illustrate the decadent wealth of the Amsterdam merchants of the Dutch Golden Age in Amsterdam.\n\nBartholomeus van der Helst also painted a number of genre scenes. An example of a genre scene by van der Helst is the \"View of the Nieuwmarkt\" (1638, Hermitage Museum, Saint Petersburg), which combines still life, cityscape and figure piece. The composition shows an old woman holding a big wheelbarrow full of vegetables. On her left hangs the carcass of large slaughtered pig. Next to the pig are four children, one of whom blows the pig's bladder while the others look at the viewer. In the background is a view on the Nieuwmarkt with the Sint Anthoniswaag. This work was probably made for van der Helst's private use as it likely depicts the view from his house on the Nieuwmarkt.\n\nAnother genre scene is \"The Musician\" (1662, Metropolitan Museum of Art), which depicts a woman tuning a theorbo while a viola da gamba is resting in front of her. Printed music in tenor and soprano parts is placed on a table nearby. The musician looks directly at the viewer as if inviting him to take up the viola da gamba to join her in a duet. While the work has usually been regarded as a genre scene, it is possible that it is in fact a portrait of Anna du Pire, the artist's wife.\nAs was common in 17th century Dutch artistic practice, Bartholomeus van der Helst regularly collaborated with other specialist artists. A frequent collaborator was Ludolf Bakhuizen, a prominent marine and landscape painter. Bakhuizen painted the marine scenes, which are the backdrop of his portraits of the Dutch naval heroes and with the pendant portrait of his (all three dated 1668 and in the Rijksmuseum).\n\nAn interesting case of a collaboration between multiple Golden Age painters is the . No less than four painters had a hand in its creation: Bartholomeus van der Helst, Cornelis van Poelenburgh, Jan Both and Jacob Duck. Van der Helst was responsible for the general composition and Jan Both for the landscape. It is possible that Duck painted the harness as he was a specialist in guardroom scenes (also called 'kortegards'), which depicted soldiers at leisure among their weapons, harnesses and other military gear in a guardroom. It is likely that van der Helst also painted the face but the role of van Poelenburgh is not clear.\n\nVan der Helst also collaborated with the animal painter Jan Baptist Weenix on the . Bartholomeus van der Helst painted the shepherd boy in the painting. Van der Helst scratched his signature in the wet paint on the boy's collar while Weenix did the same in the wet paint at the upper right. It is believed the painting was intended to be hung over a large fireplace. This probably explains the contrived perspective with the somewhat too large sheep placed right on the edge in the foreground.\n"}

This was the first time a Pope had visited a predominantly Eastern Orthodox country since the East-West Schism in 1054, the event that separated Eastern Orthodoxy and Western Catholicism. On his arrival, the Patriarch and the President of Romania, Emil Constantinescu, greeted the Pope. The Patriarch stated, \"The second millennium of Christian history began with a painful wounding of the unity of the Church; the end of this millennium has seen a real commitment to restoring Christian unity.\"\n\nOn 9 May, the Pope and the Patriarch each attended a worship service conducted by the other (an Orthodox Liturgy and a Catholic Mass, respectively). A crowd of hundreds of thousands of people turned up to attend the worship services, which were held in the open air. The Pope told the crowd, \"I am here among you pushed only by the desire of authentic unity. Not long ago it was unthinkable that the bishop of Rome could visit his brothers and sisters in the faith who live in Romania. Today, after a long winter of suffering and persecution, we can finally exchange the kiss of peace and together praise the Lord.\" A large part of Romania's Orthodox population has shown itself warm to the idea of Christian reunification.\n\nDuring his 2001 travels, John Paul II became the first Pope to visit Greece in 1291 years.\n\nIn Athens, the Pope met with Archbishop Christodoulos, the head of the Church of Greece. After a private 30 minute meeting, the two spoke publicly. Christodoulos read a list of \"13 offences\" of the Roman Catholic Church against the Eastern Orthodox Church since the Great Schism, including the pillaging of Constantinople by crusaders in 1204, and bemoaned the lack of any apology from the Roman Catholic Church, saying \"“Until now, there has not been heard a single request for pardon”\" for the \"“maniacal crusaders of the 13th century.”\"\n\nThe Pope responded by saying \"“For the occasions past and present, when sons and daughters of the Catholic Church have sinned by action or omission against their Orthodox brothers and sisters, may the Lord grant us forgiveness,”\" to which Christodoulos immediately applauded. John Paul II also said that the sacking of Constantinople was a source of \"“profound regret”\" for Catholics. Later John Paul and Christodoulos met on a spot where Saint Paul had once preached to Athenian Christians. They issued a ‘common declaration’, saying \"“We shall do everything in our power, so that the Christian roots of Europe and its Christian soul may be preserved. … We condemn all recourse to violence, proselytism and fanaticism, in the name of religion”\" The two leaders then said the Lord's Prayer together, breaking an Orthodox taboo against praying with Catholics.\n\nDuring the travels between 23 and 26 May 2002 Pope John Paul II visited Bulgaria and met with the Bulgarian Patriarch Maxim. He visited Sofia, Plovdiv and the Rila monastery and told Bulgarian President Georgi Parvanov he never believed that the country participated in organization of the 1981 assassination attempt.\n\nJohn Paul II visited another heavily Orthodox area, Ukraine on 23–27 June 2001 at the invitation of the President of Ukraine and bishops of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church and the Roman Catholic Church in Ukraine. This visit has had a great influence on society of Ukraine. The Pope spoke to leaders of the All-Ukrainian Council of Churches and Religious Organisations, pleading for \"open, tolerant and honest dialogue\".\n\nAbout 200 thousand people attended the liturgies celebrated by the Pope in Kiev, and the liturgy in Lviv gathered nearly one and a half million faithful. John Paul II stated that an end to the Great Schism was one of his fondest wishes. Healing divisions between the Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches regarding Latin and Byzantine traditions was clearly of great personal interest. For a number of years John Paul II actively sought to facilitate dialogue and unity stating as early as 1988 in \"Euntes in mundum\" that \"\"Europe has two lungs, it will never breathe easily until it uses both of them\"\".\n\nWith regard to relations with the Serbian Orthodox Church, Pope John Paul II could not escape the controversy of the involvement of Croatian Catholic clergy with the Ustasa regime of World War II. In 1998, he beatified Aloysius Stepinac, the Croatian war-time Archbishop of Zagreb, a move seen negatively by those who believe that he was an active collaborator with the Ustaše fascist regime, which committed genocide against Serbs as well as Jews. On 22 June 2003 he visited Banja Luka in Bosnia and Herzegovina, a city inhabited by many Catholics before the 1992-1995 war, but since then predominantly Orthodox. He held a mass at the Petrićevac monastery, a place of considerable controversy and distress, both during World War II and during the Yugoslav wars. \n\nCatholics in Belarus (at least 10-15% of the population) had hoped for the Pope to visit their country, a trip he himself wished to make. Resistance from the Russian Orthodox Church and Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, however, meant the visit never happened.\n\nPope's relation with Polish Autocephalous Orthodox Church was marked by a series of hostilities. Pope supported Solidarity and catholic option while Polish United Workers' Party pursued \"russian model\" with Orthodox Church being marginalized but the only official state religion. Official Party's documents clearly stated that Catholicism should be embraced, extended, and extinguished in favour of Orthodox Church.\n\nThe Pope had been also saying during his entire pontificate that one of his greatest dreams was to visit Russia, but this never occurred. He had made several attempts to solve the problems which arose over a period of centuries between the Roman Catholic and Russian Orthodox churches, like giving back the Kazan Icon of the Mother of God in August 2004. However, the Orthodox side was not that enthusiastic, making statements like: \"The question of the visit of the Pope in Russia is not connected by the journalists with the problems between the Churches, which are now unreal to solve, but with giving back one of many sacred things, which were illegally stolen from Russia.\" (Vsevolod Chaplin).\n"}

SAFA was established in 1991. The South African Football Association is the second Football Association in South Africa to be named the \"South African Football Association\" and it is also the second football association in South Africa to affiliate to FIFA. The present day South African Football Association, unlike its predecessor allows for a mixed-race national team.\n\nSAFA was admitted to FIFA in 1992 and its senior team has since represented South Africa at the Africa Cup of Nations and the FIFA World Cup. During SAFA's time as the FIFA-affiliated football organisation, South Africa has also hosted several editions of the COSAFA Cup, the 1996 Africa Cup of Nations and the 2010 FIFA World Cup.\n\nThe South African Football Association is responsible for the administration of the South African national football teams (both men's and women's), and the third tier and below of the South African Football league system. The Premier Soccer League administrates the top two divisions and several cup competitions.\n\nThe founding of the first football associations in South Africa were influenced by arrival of many British soldiers to South Africa. The original South African Football Association was a white only organization established in 1892. The South African Football Association was the first national governing body on the continent and affiliated to FIFA in 1910. The SAFA of 1892 was the first association on the African continent to become affiliated to FIFA. SAFA withdrew from FIFA in 1924 and later regained full membership in 1952.\n\nIn 1932, the South African African Football Association (SAAFA) was formed and a year later the South African Bantu Football Association (SABFA) and the South African Coloured Football Association (SACFA) followed suit. In September 1951, the three merged to form the anti-apartheid South African Soccer Federation (SASF). The South African Football Association struggled for the right to represent South African in world football (FIFA) against South African Soccer Federation (SASF) SASF claimed it was the legitimate representative of South Africa considering three-fourths of football players were registered within SASF.\n\nSAFA were expected to play in the newly formed Confederation of African Football's 1957 Africa Cup of Nations, however they did not. The minutes of the meetings between SAFA and their counterparts from Ethiopia, Egypt and Sudan were lost to fire and so the official reason for their non-appearance is unknown. Fred Fell, SAFA's representative at FIFA said that SAFA withdrew because of the conflict at the Suez Canal. There were also rumours that they were expelled from the initial competition due to their favourable stance on apartheid.\n\nIn November 1954, the SASF attempted to join FIFA. In May 1955, FIFA concluded that SAFA does not have \"the standing of a real national association\" because it did not control all clubs, there were more clubs and players with SASF than SAFA. SASF's application was rejected because there were no white players. In 1956, FIFA chose to accept SAFA's stance that segregation was a \"tradition and custom\" in South Africa.\n\nThe South African Football Association were renamed to the \"Football Association of South Africa (FASA)\" in 1957. The newly renamed association also removed a clause from its constitution excluding non-whites. In his book \"African Soccerscapes\", Professor Peter Alegi says this was to \"create the perception of substantive change while maintaining the status quo\".\n\nIn 1959, the SASF successfully managed to have a FIFA sanctioned game between Brazilian club Portuguesa Santista and white South Africa cancelled, as the Brazilian club had agreed to withdraw its black players from the game. The SASF had complained to the Brazilian consul in Cape Town, the Brazilian government prevented the club from taking part.\n\nAt FIFA's 1960 Congress in Rome,an anti racism resolution was adopted that demanded the Football Association of South Africa (FASA) integrate football within a year or they would be expelled from FIFA. There were calls from the Soviet bloc and Asia for the South African Soccer Federation (SASF) to become a member of FIFA in place of FASA. The calls were rejected as FIFA's own statutes stated that \"a National Association must be open to all who practice football in that country whether amateur, 'non-amateur', or professional and without any racial, religious, political discrimination\". FASA as well as South Africa were also expelled for the Confederation Africaine de Football for discrimination.\n\nIn September 1961, FASA were suspended from FIFA because of their pro-apartheid stance and refusal to field non-white players. This was the first time a major organization had expelled the administration of South Africa. Also, in 1961 the white-South Africa sympathiser Stanley Rous was elected as FIFA President. Rous and United States citizen Joseph Maguire would later visit white South African officials for two weeks. Rous reported to FIFA that there was no wilful discrimination within FASA and on the basis of his report, FASA were allowed back into FIFA in September 1963.\n\nAt the Tokyo Congress, the Confederation of African Football members were lobbying for the expulsion of the FASA unless its \"obnoxious apartheid policy [was] totally eliminated\". They had retained the support of Soviet and Asian National Associations and held meetings with South African Soccer Federation in Durban and the \"South African Non-Racial Olympic Committee\" in London. CAF had already expelled South Africa from its own membership. The request for expulsion from FIFA was downgraded to suspension and it was passed by a majority of associations at the 1964 FIFA Congress.\n\nFollowing the suspension, South Africa were also not allowed to take part in the 1964 and 1968 Olympics and were expelled from the Olympic movement in 1970. During this time Rous had been lobbying to have South Africa re-instated into FIFA and the Olympics. In 1973, Brazilian FIFA President candidate Joao Havelange withdrew Brazil from the 1973 South African Games to curry favour with the anti-apartheid national associations and went to beat Rous in the FIFA Presidential Election. At the FIFA Congress on 16 July 1976 in Montreal, FASA were formally suspended from FIFA. Members of FIFA had voted to exclude South Africa 78 votes to 9.\n\nOn December 8, 1991 many opposing football associations came together in a \"unity\" process that eventually formed a non-racial South African Football Association. In January 1992, the Confederation Africaine de Football also reinstated South Africa into their football organization.\n\nThe new South African Football Association was founded on 23 March 1991, the culmination of a long unity process that was to rid the sport in South Africa of all its past racial division.\n\nA delegation of the SAFA received a standing ovation at the congress of the Confederation of African Football (CAF) in Dakar, Senegal a month later, where South Africa were accorded observer status. South Africa's membership of the world governing body FIFA was confirmed at their congress in Zurich in June 1992.\nMembership of CAF followed automatically and South Africa was back on the world stage, and were awarded the right to host the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa.\nWithin a month the country hosted their first international match as World Cup quarterfinalists Cameroon came to play in three matches to celebrate the unity process. In September 1992, South Africa played its first junior international against Botswana at under-16 level in Lenasia and to date the country has entered a team in each of FIFA's and CAF's competitions, from under-17 to national team level, and also for the women's team.\nIn the short space of six years, SAFA has achieved remarkable success with qualification for the World Cup finals in France in 1998, the title of African champions at the 1996 African Nations Cup finals, which the country hosted, and the runners-up berth in Burkina Faso two years later.\n\nAt under-20 level, South Africa were runners-up at the 1997 African Youth Championship in Morocco and qualified to play at the 1997 FIFA World Youth Championship in Malaysia.\nAt club level, Orlando Pirates won the prestigious African Champions Cup in 1995, the first club from the southern African region to take the title in more than 30 years of competition. Pirates were playing in the event for the first time and won the title away from home in the Ivory Coast to further amplify the magnificence of the victory.\nBehind the scenes, SAFA has worked long and hard to provide the structures to take football to all levels of the South African community. There are now national age-group competitions from under-12 level up, qualified coaches working around the country and nine provincial affiliates, who are further divided into 52 regions.\n\n\n\nSAFA's 9 Provinces and 52 Regions\n\n"}

Bommel in Dutch) is a fictional anthropomorphic bear, one of the two main characters in a Dutch comic book series written by Marten Toonder. The other is Tom Puss (\"Tom Poes\"), and the comic book bears the name of either of these characters.\n\nThe first Tom Puss stories were told as illustrated novels, published in daily installments in the Dutch newspaper \"De Telegraaf.\" Tom Puss first appeared as a replacement for the Mickey Mouse strip in 1941. It was not until later that Tom Puss became more identifiable as a comic strip.\n\nSir Oliver B. Bumble was introduced in 1941, in the third Tom Puss story. Initially, he was only a supporting character, but he soon became a second protagonist. As Tom Puss was noble and heroic, later stories came to depend on the flawed and kind-hearted Oliver B. Bumble as an initiator of events. The final story, published in 1986, ends the story with Bumble marrying his neighbor, Miss Doddel, and settling down.\n\nThere have been over 600 Tom Puss stories in total and most of them feature Oliver B. Bumble. Bumble and Puss' stories have been translated and published worldwide. An animated movie based on the series named \"Als je begrijpt wat ik bedoel\" (\"If you know what I mean,\" one of Bumble's catch-phrases) was released in 1983. In English, it is alternately called \"The Dragon That Wasn't (Or Was He?)\" and \"Dexter the Dragon and Bumble the Bear\". In the 1940s, Toonder created a number of short animated movies featuring the characters in commercials for Philips.\n\nIn February 2007, the Dutch Programme Foundation began a 440-part radio drama based on the series, hosted by Radio 4. The series ended in December 2009. There have been rumors of a new film and animation series.\n\nSir Oliver is a bear of nobility; an eloquent, though not always coherent, gentleman with a slight stutter when he's upset. He enjoys the finer things in life, like a good pipe, and tries to make a good impression with his peers in the \"\"Kleine Club,\"\" the \"Little Club\", a rather exclusive affair. It includes members such as mayor Dickerdack, overly eager to delegate difficult tasks, and Bumble's arch-rival the Marquis de Canteclaer, who is also his neighbor and thinks that \"this, err.. Bumble\" is a parvenu. Bumbles membership is somewhat controversial and he's blackballed on several occasions.\nBumble is quite wealthy; he even makes it into the \"upper ten\" who own almost everything, but always tells others that money is of no importance and is generous to his friends and those in need. He lives in castle , where his butler \"Joost\" sees to his every need. He is a modest bear though; he always dresses in a simple checkered coat and his car, nicknamed \"De Oude Schicht\" (\"The Old Bolt (of lightning)\"), is reliable, but not extravagant. Extravagance is a trait Bumble doesn't possess, following his dear father's lessons of modesty and common sense, exemplified in a \"simple yet nutritious meal\", which is rarely simple but always nutritious. The phrase \"\"een eenvoudig doch voedzaam maal\"\" has become a colloquialism in Dutch.\nHe is a kind soul but he tends to act before he thinks. His compassion and sense of justice can sometimes move him to do great things, although it's usually others, most often Joost and Tom Puss, who do the actual work. He also tends to blame others for his own mistakes and rarely gives Tom Puss the credit he deserves for getting him out of trouble. As he has a \"delicate constitution\", he has no heart for conflict, but in the end he will always help his friends in need.\n\nBumble has two staunch admirers. The first is Miss Doddle, Bumble's Dulcinea and his prime source of fresh tea, courage and resolve in times of great emotional turmoil. She idolizes Bumble and thinks he's the smartest man in the world, even though Bumble is out of his depth more often than not. The second great admirer is the dwarf Kwetal who thinks Bumble has a big thinking-frame (\"denkraam\") and blindly trusts his judgment. He is the source of some weird gadgets which wreak havoc in Bumble's life or work as a \"deus ex machina\" to solve the problems which Bumble's ill-conceived grand designs have caused.\n\nAlthough Bumble has many flaws in his character, and maybe because of it, he's far more popular than Tom Puss and practically reduced the former hero to a sidekick. In many ways Bumble is an antihero, blundering blindly through life, forced by fate, one of several villains or Dorknoper, civil servant first class and tax-collector, to make decisions which greatly influence his world. Hence he is a more interesting figure than Tom Puss, who is a bit boring in contrast.\n\nThe claim that the B. in \"Olivier B. Bommel\" would stand for Berendinus is semi-canonical at best. A middle name is not found in any of the original stories and —according to the author— did not exist.\" Bommel\" was intended to be an American, though it is possible that he did indeed return to ancestral grounds. The lone initial was part of the American attributes of the character. The source of Berendinus was the answer by an editor in the Tom Poes magazine, and thus one given with a semblance of authority, which explains the popularity of the claim.\n\nRelated to this is the play in the original series with the meanings of the Dutch word \"heer\", which does mean gentleman, though it does not mean member of the nobility, which Bumble as American would not be. He is very rich and tries to live like a gentleman. Another meaning is lord, as in (absolute) ruler; as owner of his castle, he turns out to have been the lord of the land for almost the entire series in the last story. \"Sir\" rather obscures this essential part of the character as it rather suggests some noble title under lordship. An acceptable translation might be Oliver Bommel Esq.\n\nOliver B. Bumble uses several catch phrases:\n\n"}
{"id": "1897130", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1897130", "title": "William Muldoon", "text": "William Muldoon\n\nWilliam A. Muldoon (May 25, 1852 – June 3, 1933) was the Greco-Roman Wrestling Champion, a physical culturist and the first chairman of the New York State Athletic Commission. He once wrestled a match that lasted over seven hours. Nicknamed \"The Solid Man,\" Muldoon established himself as champion in Greco-Roman wrestling in the 1880s and over the years gained a remarkable measure of public influence that would continue through his days as a health farm proprietor in Westchester County and his service on NYSAC. Muldoon was a mainstay in New York sports for over 50 years.\n\nBorn in Allegany County, New York, Muldoon was the son of Irish immigrants. His father was a farmer. Showing a knack for strength athletics at a young age, Muldoon gained a local reputation as a standout in caber-tossing, weightlifting, sprinting and amateur wrestling. His youth was otherwise characterized by a brutish, flash temper, and his desire to be treated with the respect of an adult despite being a child.\n\nMuldoon journeyed to Paris to serve as a volunteer in the French Army in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-71, where he met publisher James Gordon Bennett, Jr., who told Muldoon he had the potential to be the best Greco-Roman wrestler in the world if he concentrated on it.\n\nBy 1876, Muldoon was living in New York City, where he accepted appointment to the New York Police Department at the behest of Senator John Morrissey, former bare-knuckle boxing champion. At the time of his resignation in 1881 Muldoon was a detective.\n\nIn 1880, Muldoon gained recognition as World's Greco-Roman Champion with a win over title claimant Thiebaud Bauer. His rise to prominence brought challengers from across the globe, including Edwin Bibby and Tom Cannon of England, Donald Dinnie of Scotland, \"Mat\" Sorakichi of Japan, Carl Abs of Germany, William Miller of Australia, and John McMahon and Clarence Whistler, the latter being Muldoon's opponent in a titanic seven-hour match in 1881, where neither could gain a single fall.\n\nFollowing the celebrated match with Whistler, Muldoon assembled an athletic combination and toured the country promoting athletic events and defending his title against all comers. Muldoon became involved in theater around this time, stemming from his fame in athletics. In 1883 he shared the bill with Maurice Barrymore, a boxer turned actor, in Madame Modjeska's production of Shakespeare's \"As You Like It.\" Barrymore played Orlando and Muldoon was Charles the Wrestler. In 1887, he appeared on Broadway as \"The Fighting Gaul\" in \"Spartacus.\"\n\nMuldoon was one of a party of gentlemen entertained by Robert Emmet Odlum, brother of women's rights activist Charlotte Odlum Smith, on the morning of May 19, 1885, the day he jumped from the Brooklyn Bridge and was killed. Muldoon assisted in unsuccessful resuscitation efforts and summoned an ambulance, which was too late to save Odlum.\n\nIn 1889 Muldoon trained John L. Sullivan for his famous 75-round fight against Jake Kilrain for the world heavyweight bare-knuckle boxing championship. He had done so on a friendly wager and offered to absorb expenses if Sullivan lost. Sullivan won and Muldoon gained national notice for restoring the boxing champion to fighting form. Muldoon's methods at accomplishing Sullivan's rejuvenation gained much public interest.\n\nOn May 28, Muldoon and Sullivan would have an exhibition wrestling bout contested under London Prize Ring Rules that ended on a 5-5 draw. The two would later have a 3 round bout where Muldoon would win two of three bouts\n\nMuldoon was never defeated for his Greco-Roman Championship. He wrestled in his final championship match in 1890, defeating Evan Lewis in Philadelphia. Despite being implored by promoters and challengers to come out of retirement, Muldoon never wrestled another finish match or claimed any active championship. He symbolically passed his World's Greco-Roman Championship to protégé Ernest Roeber (whom Lewis later defeated). Muldoon would make his final public appearance as a wrestler in a charity exhibition match against Roeber at Madison Square Garden in 1894.\n\nThat same year Muldoon moved his health farm from Belfast, New York to White Plains. As he tapered off direct involvement in professional athletics he devoted more time to devising his system on restoring one's health. Muldoon continued to train boxers and wrestlers until boxing was banned in New York at the turn of the century.\n\nIn 1900, Muldoon opened what would become the work of his life, the well-known health institute \"The Olympia,\" at Purchase, New York. In subsequent years through the success of the Olympia Muldoon would again gain national notice as he treated such notables there as U.S. Ambassador to Great Britain Joseph Hodges Choate, publisher Ralph Pulitzer, Senator Chauncey Depew, Major General J. Franklin Bell, essayist Elbert Hubbard novelist Theodore Dreiser and Secretary of State Elihu Root, who was sent to Muldoon by President Roosevelt. In 1907 there was talk that Muldoon would be appointed to the president's cabinet to oversee physical health. For his uncompromised methods at his health farm Muldoon was dubbed the \"Professor.\" Journalist Nellie Bly was the first woman to complete Muldoon's system.\n\nIn the spring of 1909 Muldoon made a final return to the stage in a theatrical tour organized in benefit of The Lambs. Muldoon dedicated a Civil War monument to the town of Belfast, New York, listing the names of local veterans in 1915, including that of his older brother John.\nIn 1921 Muldoon was personally tapped by Governor Nathan Lewis Miller as the inaugural Chairman of the New York State Athletic Commission, when professional boxing's status was legally restored in New York. While on NYSAC, Muldoon's czarish decrees characterized his inflexible sense of integrity to the press and sporting public. He was dubbed in the papers the \"Iron Duke.\"\n\nIn 1927 Muldoon was profiled by \"The New Yorker\" magazine and in 1929 by \"The Saturday Evening Post\". A biography was published in 1928, with a foreword by Jack Dempsey.\n\nWilliam Muldoon died at age 81 in Westchester County, New York, and was interred in a grandiose private mausoleum at Kensico Cemetery in Valhalla, New York. Sometime after the end of his wrestling career and before the turn of the century, Muldoon had mendaciously claimed for years that he was born in 1845, and 7 years older than his age verified in the Muldoon Family Bible, which documents his real birth year.\n\nIn 1996, Muldoon was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame.\n\nIn 2004, he was inducted into the Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame and Museum under the \"Pioneer Era\" category.\n\nMuldoon claimed to be a lifelong bachelor. However, he was married twice; the first marriage ended in divorce, the other in separation. His housekeeper of 30 years Leonie Lutringer left her entire estate to Muldoon in 1922. It was revealed later in his life that he had adopted his longtime secretary Margaret Farrell – she received his entire estate at his death. Muldoon was diagnosed with terminal cancer in 1931, though his doctors did not reveal the nature of his illness to him. Muldoon died two years later. Retired boxing champion Gene Tunney, a disciple of Muldoon, remarked to the \"Times\" at the time of Muldoon's death, \"All I know about training I learned from him…. His patience, intellectual courage and wisdom were inspirational.\" William Muldoon was interred at Kensico Cemetery, Valhalla, NY.\n\nMuldoon was a strong advocate of compulsory military service, equestrianism, physical culture and the Boy Scouts of America, citing the latter as the only organization left devoted to leadership-building for young men.\n\n\n"}

He was a Progressive Conservative member in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1975 to 1990, and was a cabinet minister in the governments of Bill Davis and Frank Miller.\n\nMcCague was born in Essa Township, north of Alliston, Ontario. He was son of J. J. E. McCague, who owned Glenafton Farms which was one of the best known dairy farms of its time. He was educated at Burns Public School, Alliston High School (both schools since closed) and the Ontario Agricultural College in Guelph, Ontario. He worked as a sod and potato farmer and executive and owned a real estate company in Alliston.\n\nMcCague was a councillor in Alliston from 1960 to 1961, deputy reeve from 1962 to 1964, reeve from 1965 to 1966, a public school board member from 1967 to 1968 and Mayor from 1969 to 1973. He was chair of the Board of Governors for Georgian College from 1967 to 1974 and Simcoe County warden in 1966. He also served as chair of the Niagara Escarpment Commission in the early 1970s.\n\nHe was elected to the Ontario legislature in the 1975 provincial election, after defeating long serving Dufferin Simcoe MP Wally Downer for the Progressive Conservative nomination. He defeated Liberal Bob Beattie by 1,691 votes in the riding of Dufferin—Simcoe. He was elected by greater margins in the elections of 1977, 1981, and 1985.\n\nMcCague served as parliamentary assistant to the Treasurer just before the 1977 election, and was brought into Bill Davis's cabinet on September 21, 1977 as Minister of Government Services. On January 21, 1978, he was shifted to the Ministry of the Environment. He was named Chair of the Management Board of Cabinet on August 18, 1978. He retained this position until Davis resigned as Premier in 1985. McCague tried to convince Davis to remain in office for another election, but afterwards endorsed Frank Miller to succeed him as party leader.\n\nWhen Miller replaced Davis as Premier on February 8, 1985, he appointed McCague as Minister of Transportation and Communications. Soon after this, the Tories were reduced to a tenuous minority government in the 1985 election under Miller's leadership. McCague was retained in his portfolio after the election, but did little of significance before the government was defeated in the house. He sat in opposition for the remainder of his time in the legislature.\n\nMcCague was narrowly re-elected in the 1987 election, defeating Liberal candidate Gary Johnson by only 306 votes in the redistributed constituency of Simcoe West. He did not seek re-election in 1990.

The two segments, although not directly connected, are linked by U.S. Route 3, from which they derive their route number.\n\nThe southern terminus of the southern segment is at the Massachusetts state line in Hudson, where it continues south as Massachusetts Route 3A. The northern terminus is in the city of Concord at US 3. This segment of NH 3A follows the Merrimack River for its entire length. The route begins in Hudson at the Massachusetts line and shortly intersects the eastern end of the Nashua Circumferential Highway, which provides access to US 3 and the F.E. Everett Turnpike. NH 3A passes through Hudson Village, the historic center of town, where it intersects with NH 111 just across the river from downtown Nashua. NH 102 begins at this intersection and is cosigned with NH 3A for its first mile, before 3A splits to the north west, while 102 continues on towards Londonderry. NH 3A continues along the eastern bank of the river, through Litchfield and into the city of Manchester, where it crosses under I-293/NH 101 and follows a short surface alignment in the southwest section of town. NH 3A intersects with US 3 and is actually cosigned with it (in a wrong-way concurrency) on Queen City Avenue across the river, where the two routes intersect NH 114A at its eastern terminus. At this point, NH 3A leaves US 3 and merges onto I-293 northbound (which also carries the Everett Turnpike) at exit 4. NH 3A is concurrent with I-293 for , departing at exit 7 and crossing into Hooksett. The highway immediately interchanges with I-93 (which it parallels for the remainder of its length) near the northern terminus of I-293, and continues north (now paralleling on the west side of the river). Hackett Hill Road provides another access point to I-93, while nearby Main Street connects to US 3/NH 28 across the river. NH 3A enters Bow and meets the southern end of the I-89 freeway before crossing into the city limits of Concord. The highway interchanges with I-93 one last time before ending at US 3 just south of downtown Concord.\n\nThe southern terminus of the northern segment is in the city of Franklin at US 3, NH 11, and NH 127. Where US 3 takes a more easterly route from here, NH 3A continues due north, following the western bank of the Pemigewasset River along North Main Street. North of Franklin, it enters the town of Hill, continuing to follow the Pemigewasset, passing through the William H. Thomas State Forest on the way to the town of Bristol. It forms the main commercial thoroughfare through Bristol, with a brief concurrency with NH 104 in the center of town, following first South Main Street, then Pleasant Street, and finally Lake Street. At Bristol, 3A leaves the Pemigewasset, which turns east here, and continues north into Bridgewater and the southern shores of Newfound Lake. Following the Mayhew Turnpike along the eastern side of Newfound Lake through Bridgewater, 3A continues through rural areas on the eastern side of Hebron and the western side of Plymouth. In Plymouth, the route joins with NH 25 and heads due east to rejoin US 3 at an interchange with Interstate 93, US 3 and NH 25, which is the northern terminus of this segment.\n\nFrom 1922 to 1926, Route 3A was part of the New England road marking system as New England Route 6A (NE-6A).

Wodehouse, and features the young gentleman Bertie Wooster and his valet Jeeves. The story was published in the \"Saturday Evening Post\" in the United States in November 1916, and in \"The Strand Magazine\" in the United Kingdom in April 1923. The story was also included in the 1925 collection \"Carry On, Jeeves\".\n\nBertie meets Jeeves for the first time in this story. Florence Craye, Bertie's fiancée, wants him to destroy his uncle's scandalous memoirs.\n\n24-year-old Bertie Wooster returns to London from Easeby, his Uncle Willoughby's home, after firing his valet for stealing. An agency sends him Jeeves, who prepares a drink that cures both Bertie's hangover and his fatigue after trying to read a difficult book titled \"Types of Ethical Theory\", which his fiancée, Lady Florence Craye, expects him to read. Impressed, Bertie hires Jeeves. Bertie receives a telegram from Florence, who is at Easeby, telling him to return at once. Jeeves wants Bertie to wear a simple brown or blue suit with a hint of quiet twill, but Bertie wears his check suit instead.\n\nAt Easeby, Florence tells Bertie that his uncle is writing a memoir called \"Recollections of a Long Life\". Many of the stories feature Florence's father, Lord Worplesdon. Florence is appalled by the rowdy stories. She tells Bertie to destroy the manuscript. Bertie does not want to upset his uncle, upon whom he is financially dependent, but Florence is adamant. Bertie steals the parcel, and after running into Florence's young brother Edwin, Bertie locks it in a drawer in his room.\n\nUncle Willoughby tells Bertie that his publishers have not received his manuscript. He fears it has been stolen. Feeling guilty, Bertie tries to take a walk, but overhears Edwin telling Willoughby that he saw Bertie hiding a parcel. Bertie rushes back to his room to move the parcel but finds he has misplaced the key to the locked drawer. Willoughby arrives, and searches. When he reaches the locked drawer, Jeeves appears and provides the key. At first Bertie is angry with Jeeves, but the drawer is empty. After Willoughby leaves, Bertie thanks Jeeves, who moved the parcel.\n\nLater, Willoughby reports that his publishers received his manuscript. Florence is furious with Bertie and ends their engagement. Distressed, Bertie questions Jeeves, who admits sending the parcel to the publishers. He says Florence overestimated the offensiveness of Sir Willoughby's \"Recollections\". When Jeeves shows no sympathy about the broken engagement, Bertie fires him. Jeeves opines that Bertie would not have been happy with Florence. After sleeping on it, Bertie realizes that Jeeves is right. He rehires Jeeves and allows Jeeves to dispose of the check suit. Jeeves thanks him and says he has already given the suit away to the under-gardener.\n\nCharacters in Wodehouse's stories rarely tell conventional jokes, and humour is instead created indirectly through a number of stylistic devices. Bertie Wooster seldom tells a traditional joke, for example, but often uses puns, such as when he describes how his valet Meadowes stole his socks: \"I was reluctantly compelled to hand the misguided blighter the mitten\", and, \"directly I found that he was a sock-sneaker I gave him the boot\".\n\nIn Wodehouse's stories, information is frequently repeated in two or more ways through the use of alternative words, placing concentration on humorous language rather than on a steady flow of new narrative information. For instance, pairs of synonymous words are often used in Bertie's narration and dialogue, as in the following quote from this story: \"This infernal kid must somehow be turned out eftsoons or right speedily\".\n\nHenry Raleigh provided illustrations for the 1916 publication of the story in the \"Saturday Evening Post\". The story was illustrated by A. Wallis Mills in the \"Strand\". In 1980, the story was reprinted in the \"Saturday Evening Post\" with illustrations by Phil Smith.\n\nThe story was included in the American edition of the 1939 Wodehouse collection \"The Week-End Wodehouse\", and in the 1958 collection of Wodehouse stories, \"Selected Stories by P. G. Wodehouse\".\n\nThe first part of the story, in which Bertie hires Jeeves, was adapted into the \"Jeeves and Wooster\" episode \"Jeeves' Arrival\", the first episode of the first series, which first aired in the UK on 22 April 1990. The rest of the story, concerning Florence and scandalous memoirs, was adapted into \"Sir Watkyn Bassett's Memoirs\", the fifth episode of the fourth series, which first aired in the UK on 26 April 1992.

{"id": "1897176", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1897176", "title": "Hiking (sailing)", "text": "Hiking (sailing)\n\nIn sailing, hiking (stacking or stacking out in New Zealand; leaning out or sitting out in United Kingdom) is the action of moving the crew's body weight as far to windward (upwind) as possible, in order to decrease the extent the boat heels (leans away from the wind). By moving the crew's weight to windward, the moment of that force around the boat's center of buoyancy is increased. This opposes the heeling moment of the wind pushing sideways against the boat's sails. It is usually done by leaning over the edge of the boat as it heels. Some boats are fitted with equipment such as hiking straps (or toe straps) and trapezes to make hiking more effective.\n\nHiking is most integral to catamaran and dinghy sailing, where the lightweight boat can be easily capsized or turtled by the wind unless the sailor counteracts the wind's pressure by hiking, or eases the sails to reduce it. The heavy keel on larger keelboats means that it is rare to capsize them due to wind alone, but keelboat racers will still hike to prevent unnecessary heeling, or leaning sideways to leeward, because the more vertical in the water the keel is, the more effective it is at keeping the boat moving in a forward direction and preventing it from drifting to leeward, slowing the boat due to drag, and potentially increasing the distance the boat must sail when beating. Improper heel creates a tendency for the boat to turn off course, necessitating a correction with the rudder, which also increases drag. Sails use wind most efficiently when they are at a proper heel, another reason for controlling heel.\n\nMany boats, especially dinghies, have equipment that facilitates effective hiking. \"Hiking straps\" (toe straps) made from rope or webbing hold the sailor's feet down, allowing them to lean back over the gunwale of the boat while sitting facing in. These simple devices are almost universal on dinghies that do not have more complex hiking systems. Some sailors wear special shorts fitted with pads or stiff battens to help them hike more effectively and without tiring.\n\nSome dinghies and catamarans, such as the 505, 420, International 14, or Hobie 16, have a \"trapeze\" to allow the crew to increase their righting moment on the boat. These are wires attached high up on the mast, and fitted with a bracket that fits into a hook on a harness worn by the crew. This wire and harness then supports the crew as they stand and lean back over the water, pulling against the mast. On some boats, such as the Laser 2, the skipper uses hiking straps, and the crew uses a trapeze. On high-performance skiffs, such as the International 14 or 49er, both the skipper and the crew use trapezes.\n\n\"Hiking boards\" are long boards fitted perpendicular to the boat's hull, and sometimes stretching several feet over the water. These allow the crew to move their weight far out to windward. They are commonly designed to slide from side to side, so they are moved to the windward side whenever the boat tacks. They are most often used on sailing canoes, but can be installed on many kinds of dinghy. there are also two racing classes that use planks and they are the VJ, and the bigger Skate (dinghy).\n\nSome racing keelboats are fitted with elastic lifelines running down the sides of the boat. These allow the crew to lean into the lifeline to get further out on the windward rail. Many kinds of racing keelboat are raced with more crew aboard than is strictly necessary to operate the boat in order to increase the amount of weight on the upwind side of the boat, keeping the boat flatter.\n\nA few high performance keelboats, such as the Moore 30 and the Kiwi 35, have structural hiking \"wings\" built into their hull, which allows a lower displacement hull and increased leverage for hiking. See Turtling.\n\nOn most dinghies the tiller is fitted with a \"tiller extension\" or \"hiking stick\", which allows the skipper to steer the boat while hiked out.\n"}

Sampson was a journalist and a member of EOKA, which rose against the British colonial administration, seeking \"Enosis\" (Union) of the island of Cyprus with Greece. He was eventually arrested and sentenced to death, but was imprisoned in Britain after the sentence was commuted, returning after Cyprus gained independence.\n\nUpon his return upon the formation of the Republic of Cyprus, he entered politics, becoming a member of Parliament. Following the coup of 1974 by the Greek Junta, he was appointed President by the leaders of the coup Kombokis and Georgitsis as a solution of necessity because nobody else accepted, and remained in the position for eight days. Following the Turkish invasion of Cyprus on 20 July he resigned. He was later sentenced to twenty years in prison for abuse of power, the only person convicted \"vis-à-vis\" the coup, maintaining there had been a setup and cover up.\n\nAccording to Cyprus-based Polish-American journalist, Andrew Borowiec, several members of the US embassy in Nicosia had been on friendly terms with Sampson and he had even toured the USA at the US government's invitation. Three years into his sentence, he was allowed to go to France on medical grounds, and subsequently settled in France. He returned to Cyprus in 1990 to resume his sentence, and was pardoned for the remainder of his sentence in 1993. Following his release, he went into the newspaper publishing business. He died of cancer in 2001.\n\nSampson was born in the Cypriot port city of Famagusta to Sampson Georgiadis and Theano Liasidou. During his teenage years, he was a footballer, playing as a right back in the Anorthosis Famagusta second team. He began his working life at a Cyprus newspaper, \"The Cyprus Times\", which was owned and edited by Charles Foley. His original name was Nikos Georgiadis, but he adopted his father's forename as his surname.\n\nDuring the Cyprus Emergency, in which the EOKA guerrilla group waged a campaign of resistance to British colonial rule in Cyprus from 1955 to 1959, Sampson joined EOKA and adopted the nom de guerre Atrotos (), or \"Invulnerable\". Sampson joined EOKA and formed part of an execution team under the direct orders of General Georgios Grivas (\"Digenis\"), leader of EOKA. Another member of this team was Neoptolemos Georgiou who was later arrested for various activities whilst being a member of EOKA-B. Sampson and Georgiou participated in a number of murders carried out along Ledra Street in Nicosia, which was nicknamed \"Murder Mile\", and shot dead numerous British servicemen, police officers, and civilians. He was involved in at least 15 killings. According to British sources, the actual number was much higher. Among his victims were three police sergeants, and in May 1957, Sampson was tried for one of their murders. He confessed, but was acquitted on the grounds that his confession may have been coerced by torture.\n\nAt the time, Sampson was working as a journalist, and he would often photograph the bodies of his victims after killing them, then send the photographs to \"The Cyprus Times\" newspaper to be published. The police became suspicious about how Sampson was always the first reporter to arrive at the murder scene and he was arrested. Only a month after his acquittal, he was given away by informants and arrested in the village of Dhali. He was convicted of weapons possession which, under the emergency regulations of the moment, carried a death sentence. The death sentence was subsequently commuted to life imprisonment and Sampson was flown to the United Kingdom to serve it. A year and a half later, under a general amnesty as part of the 1959 Zürich and London Agreement, he was released but he remained in exile in Greece until Cyprus gained formal independence in August 1960. He returned to Nicosia shortly after Independence Day.\n\nSampson returned to newspaper publishing. In 1960, he set up the newspaper \"Makhi\" (), meaning battle, or struggle, which was one of the first Greek newspapers in circulation in the nation of Cyprus. In 1961, in a series of newspaper articles, he admitted his service fighting the occupying police officers in 1956 during the resistance campaign against British rule of the Greek island of Cyprus. According to the \"Telegraph\", as a journalist, he flew to Algeria to interview Ben Bella and to Washington to talk to US President John F. Kennedy.\n\nOn 14 May 1961, he was arrested, along with another man, a garage mechanic who was also a former EOKA member, in connection with the murder of a British architect, Peter Gray, who had been only three weeks in the country and had been shot and killed in Kyrenia in his car. Sampson was charged with the murder, but released three days later. \"Makhi\" later printed a claim that Gray was working for the British Secret Intelligence Service. His murder remained unsolved.\n\nFollowing an explosion to the statue of EOKA hero Markos Drakos in Nicosia, Sampson actively participated in clashes between the Greek and Turkish communities in December 1963. On the morning of 24 December, the clashes in Nicosia spread and fighting continued into the subsequent year. Sampson led armed groups in fierce battles between Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot irregulars. Following the fight in Omorphita, Nikos Sampson was nicknamed by the Turkish Cypriots as the \"Butcher of Omorphita\".\n\nIn 1969 Sampson founded the Progressive Party, which later merged into the Progressive Front. Sampson was elected to the House of Representatives in the 1970 elections. In 1971, EOKA head George Grivas returned to Cyprus and gave the campaign for \"enosis\" further momentum, forming EOKA B whose goal was enosis. Following the death of Grivas in January 1974, the Greek military junta of 1967-1974 gave active support to EOKA-B. Nikos Sampson maintained a strongly nationalist, pro-Greek position throughout these years.\nOn 15 July 1974, Makarios was deposed by a military coup which was led by Greek officers of the Cyprus National Guard.\n\nThe Greek military junta installed Sampson as President, as a result of a decision of Colonel Constantinos Kombokis, Deputy leader of the coup, when the President of the Supreme Court could not be found and an ex Makarios minister Zenon Severis refused to take over as President. Sampson's appointment was an on-the-spot decision to avoid a power vacuum.\nThe second Junta of Greece fell on 24 July 1974, only eight days after Sampson had been appointed. Sampson was forced to resign. The Greek Cypriot government was restored under Glafkos Clerides. When Sampson resigned on Tuesday July 23, 1974 Turkey was in control of 3% of the territory of Cyprus and the Turkish Cypriot enclaves (around 4-5% of the territory) had almost all fallen in the hands of Greek-Cypriots (H Tragiki Anametrisi kai i Prodosia tis Kyprou-Marios Adamides – 2012).\n\nThe invasion lost Sampson much of his popular appeal. He claimed not to have anticipated the impending coup that had installed him, adding that, after military officers had insisted, he \"saw the possibility of civil war and accepted\" to prevent the clashes.\nNonetheless, Sampson was prosecuted and sentenced to 20 years in prison for abuse of power () in 1976.\n\nIn 1979, only three years into his prison sentence, he was allowed to go to France on medical grounds. Living in Neuilly, and then in Fourqueux, he was supported by funds of friends. He spent much of his time between Paris and Marseilles before returning to Cyprus in June 1990 to complete his sentence.\n\nFollowing his release from Nicosia Central Prison in 1993, he went back to the newspaper publishing business. He died of cancer on 10 May 2001 in Nicosia at the age of 65.\n\nHe is survived by his wife Vera and two children, one of whom is a lawyer and the other a journalist. His son Sotiris Sampson was elected member of the House of Representatives of Cyprus for three terms in a row in Famagusta District.\n\nThe right wing community refers to Sampson as a hero of the EOKA struggle, whereas the left wing community, although it acknowledges his contribution to the EOKA struggle, sees him as a traitor to the Republic of Cyprus for his involvement in the coup and complicity in the murder of numerous liberal and left-wing Greek Cypriots.\n\n"}

The TREC cycle ends with a workshop that is a forum for participants to share their experiences.\n\nTREC uses binary relevance criterion that is either the document is relevant or not relevant. Since size of TREC collection is large, it is impossible to calculate the absolute recall for each query. In order to assess the relevance of documents in relation to a query, TREC uses a specific method call pooling for calculating relative recall. All the relevant documents that occurred in the top 100 documents for each system and for each query are combined together to produce a pool of relevant documents. Recall being the proportion of the pool of relevant documents that a single system retrieved for a query topic.\n\nIn 1992 TREC-1 was held at NIST. The first conference attracted 28 groups of researchers from academia and industry. It demonstrated a wide range of different approaches to the retrieval of text from large document collections .Finally TREC1 revealed the facts that automatic construction of queries from natural language query statements seems to work. Techniques based on natural language processing were no better no worse than those based on vector or probabilistic approach.\n\nTREC2 Took place in august 1993. 31 group of researchers where participated in this. Two types of retrieval were examined. Retrieval using an ‘ad hoc’query  and retrieval using  a ‘routing query.\n\nIn TREC-3 a small group experiments worked with Spanish language collection and others dealt with interactive query formulation in multiple databases. \n\nTREC-4 they made even shorter to investigate the problems with very short user statements\n\nTREC-5 includes both short and long versions of the topics with the goal of carrying out deeper investigation into which types of techniques work well on various lengths of topics.\n\nIn TREC-6 Three new tracks speech, cross language, high precision information retrieval were introduced. The goal of cross language information retrieval is to facilitate research on system that are able to retrieve relevant document regardless of language of the source document.\n\nTREC-7 contained seven tracks out of which two were new Query track and very large corpus track. The goal of the query track was to create a large query collection.\n\nTREC-8 contain seven tracks out of which two –question answering and web tracks were new. The objective of QA query is to explore the possibilities of providing answers to specific natural language queries\n\nTREC-9 Includes seven tracks\n\nIn TREC-10 Video tracks introduced Video tracks design to promote research in content based retrieval from digital video.\n\nIn TREC-11Novelity tracks introduced. The goal of novelty track is to investigate systems abilities to locate relevant and new information within the ranked set of documents returned by a traditional document retrieval system.\n\nTREC-12 held in 2003 added three new tracks Genome track, robust retrieval track, HARD (Highly Accurate Retrieval from Documents \n\n\"New tracks are added as new research needs are identified, this list is current for TREC 2018.\"\n\n\nIn 1997, a Japanese counterpart of TREC was launched (first workshop in 1999), called NTCIR (NII Test Collection for IR Systems), and in 2000, CLEF, a European counterpart, specifically vectored towards the study of cross-language information retrieval was launched. Forum for Information Retrieval Evaluation (FIRE) started in 2008 with the aim of building a South Asian counterpart for TREC, CLEF, and NTCIR,\n\nNIST claims that within the first six years of the workshops, the effectiveness of retrieval systems approximately doubled. The conference was also the first to hold large-scale evaluations of non-English documents, speech, video and retrieval across languages. Additionally, the challenges have inspired a large body of publications. Technology first developed in TREC is now included in many of the world's commercial search engines. An independent report by RTII found that \"about one-third of the improvement in web search engines from 1999 to 2009 is attributable to TREC. Those enhancements likely saved up to 3 billion hours of time using web search engines. ... Additionally, the report showed that for every $1 that NIST and its partners invested in TREC, at least $3.35 to $5.07 in benefits were accrued to U.S. information retrieval researchers in both the private sector and academia.\"\n\nWhile one study suggests that the state of the art for ad hoc search has not advanced substantially in the past decade, it is referring just to search for topically relevant documents in small news and web collections of a few gigabytes. There have been advances in other types of ad hoc search in the past decade. For example, test collections were created for known-item web search which found improvements from the use of anchor text, title weighting and url length, which were not useful techniques on the older ad hoc test collections. In 2009, a new billion-page web collection was introduced, and spam filtering was found to be a useful technique for ad hoc web search, unlike in past test collections.\n\nThe test collections developed at TREC are useful not just for (potentially) helping researchers advance the state of the art, but also for allowing developers of new (commercial) retrieval products to evaluate their effectiveness on standard tests. In the past decade, TREC has created new tests for enterprise e-mail search, genomics search, spam filtering, e-Discovery, and several other retrieval domains.\n\nTREC systems often provide a baseline for further research. Examples include:\n\nThe conference is made up of a varied, international group of researchers and developers. In 2003, there were 93 groups from both academia and industry from 22 countries participating.\n\n\n"}

Its southern terminus is in Winchester at the Massachusetts state line, where it continues south as Massachusetts Route 10. Administratively, the northern terminus is at a junction with U.S. Route 302 in Haverhill.\n\nIn the field, however, NH 10 is cosigned along US 302 for an additional from Haverhill to an intersection with New Hampshire Route 18 in Littleton. However, this is not officially part of the route.\n\nNH 10 is a multi-state route along with Massachusetts Route 10 and Connecticut Route 10. Its number is derived from its original 1922 designation as New England Interstate Route 10.\n\nNH 10 begins at the Massachusetts state line in Winchester, where it connects to Massachusetts Route 10. It runs northeast into the town center where it intersects with NH 78 and NH 119. NH 119 joins NH 10 briefly before splitting off to the east. NH 10 continues north along the Ashuelot River, through the town of Swanzey and into the city of Keene. NH 10 meets NH 12 and NH 101 at a traffic circle near Keene State College and turns west, joining the latter two routes to their intersection with NH 9. At this intersection, NH 101 ends while NH 10 and NH 12 turn north onto NH 9 eastbound. The three overlapped routes pass west of downtown Keene for just over , then NH 9 and NH 10 exit NH 12 at a trumpet interchange and turn northeast. NH 9 and NH 10 remain overlapped for another before NH 10 splits off to the north and crosses into the town of Gilsum. \n\nNH 10 passes through Gilsum with no major junctions, then enters Marlow, where it has a overlap with NH 123. Continuing north, NH 10 meets the eastern terminus of NH 123A then crosses into Lempster. The highway has no major junctions in Lempster and continues north into Goshen where it intersects the northern terminus of NH 31. NH 10 continues into the town of Newport, where it shares a brief concurrency with NH 11 and NH 103 in the town center. The highway continues through Croydon with no major junctions, then into Grantham where it intersects with the northern terminus of NH 114 before interchanging with Interstate 89. \n\nNH 10 joins I-89 at exit 13 and runs along the Interstate highway for , through the southwest corner of the town of Enfield and into Lebanon, where it leaves I-89 at exit 19. \n\nNH 10 exits I-89 onto U.S. Route 4, which it immediately joins westbound. US 4 and NH 10 cross the Mascoma River into the village of West Lebanon, where they intersect with NH 12A (providing local access to I-89). Just over to the north, US 4 splits off to cross the Connecticut River into White River Junction, Vermont. Now running along the eastern bank of the river, NH 10 continues north into the town of Hanover. At Dartmouth College in the heart of town, NH 10 meets its only child route, NH 10A, a connector to I-91 and US 5 in Norwich, Vermont, then intersects the northern terminus of NH 120 (NH 120 is cosigned with NH 10 on North Park Street). NH 10 continues north into the town of Lyme, where the only intersection of note is to East Thetford Road, a connector to Thetford, Vermont, which becomes Vermont Route 113 upon crossing the border to the west. Crossing into Orford, NH 10 intersects and briefly overlaps NH 25A before that route splits off to cross into Fairlee, Vermont, and meet US 5. NH 10 continues into Piermont and intersects with NH 25 (connecting to VT 25 just to the west) and NH 25C. NH 25 turns onto NH 10 northbound, and the two routes are cosigned for into the neighboring town of Haverhill. After crossing the town line, NH 25 splits off to begin its eastward trek across the state. NH 10 continues north along the Connecticut River and intersects the western terminus of NH 116 in the village of North Haverhill. Several miles to the north, NH 10 intersects the southern terminus of NH 135 and enters the village of Woodsville, where it reaches US 302, which crosses into Wells River, Vermont, just to the west. \n\nNH 10 officially ends at US 302, but is cosigned with it through Bath, Landaff, Lisbon and into Littleton to its intersection with NH 18, just north of I-93.\n\nNH 10 was first designated in 1922 as part of the New England road marking system. The original New England Interstate Route 10 extended from Route 1 (now U.S. Route 1) in New Haven, Connecticut, to Route 18 (now US 302 / NH 18) in Littleton, New Hampshire.\n\nWhen the U.S. Highway system was introduced in 1926, it supplanted the New England route system and the entirety of existing Route 10 was redesignated as state highways. Around the same time, the newly designated U.S. Route 302 was assigned to the existing route between Haverhill and Littleton, effectively making the northernmost part of NH 10's routing redundant. As a result, NH 10 was eventually truncated back to the junction with US 302 in Haverhill, but for historical reasons it seems the state decided to post NH 10 signage along the former route.\n\nNH 10 as signed today retains most of its original 1922 alignment. The one major exception to this is the routing of NH 10 along I-89 between Grantham and Lebanon. Many segments of the former surface alignment are still in use, with several labeled as \"Old Route 10.\"\n\nNH 10A is an east–west highway in Hanover. It is known as the shortest state highway in New Hampshire.\n\nThe eastern terminus of Route 10A is in the center of Hanover at the junction with NH-10, which is Main Street. The western terminus of NH-10A is on the bridge over the Connecticut River, which is the border with Vermont. The road continues into Vermont and becomes Main Street in the town of Norwich. Total length of NH-10A is approximately 0.6 mile (0.9 km). This road is locally named West Wheelock Road in Hanover.\n\n"}

The Religious groups were; Protestant, 72.8% (Baptists 35.8%, Church of God 11.7%, Roman Catholics11.4%, Anglicans 10%, Methodists 9.3%, Seventh-Day Adventists 6%, Jehovah's Witnesses 1.8% and Other 14%\n\nThe Baptist denomination was organized in the Turks and Caicos Islands in 1835 with its first church located in Grand Turk. Today the Baptist churches operate under the guidance of the Turks and Caicos Islands Baptist Union.\n\nThe first set of Sabbath keepers were discovered in the Turks and Caicos Islands on the island of Grand Turk in 1906 by a Jamaican colporteur (religious book salesman) as he sold books. The church's main periodical 'The Review and Herald' of 16 November 1905 noted that \"A woman on one of the Turks Islands at the turn of the twentieth century had come to recognize the seventh-day Sabbath through reading her Bible\".\n\nIn 1945 the territory saw the establishment of a permanent presence of the SDA church when Clyde Nebblett, another colporteur, migrated to Grand Turk with his wife and began a small prayer group that met in their home. Later that year the island of Grand Turk was devastated by the 1945 Homestead hurricane. This forced the Nedletts to move to Providenciales in the community of Blue Hills where 26 individuals were baptized through their efforts. In December of the same year the Turks and Caicos Islands along with Mayaguana of the Bahamas were organized into the Salt Cays Mission. In 1947 the believers on Grand Turk were organized into a church after an evangelistic campaign and Pastor Gordon Prenier purchased a warehouse and transformed it into the first Adventist Church building in the Turks and Caicos. Between 1950 and 1988 the territory fluctuated between mission and district categorization. \"In January 1988 it reverted to mission status under the direction of West Indies Union\".[4]When the mission was organized, it became a part of the West Indies Union Conference. West Indies Union comprised the conferences in Jamaica, the Bahamas, the Turks and Caicos Islands Mission, and the Cayman Islands Conference.\n\nIn November 2010 at Northern Caribbean University in Mandeville, Jamaica, West Indies Union was dissolved and gave birth to the Atlantic Caribbean Union Mission and the Jamaica Union Conference. \"The new configuration will see the formation of the Atlantic Caribbean Union Mission, comprising four Fields: the Bahamas Conference (now South Bahamas Conference), the North Bahamas Conference, the Cayman Islands Conference, and the Turks and Caicos Islands Mission, with approximately 25,000 members\".\n\nSeventh-day Adventism has moved in sync with the population growth of the Turks and Caicos Islands, hence Providenciales, the economic hub of the country has become the island that has seen the most growth over the years.\n\nThere are 10 churches in the Turks and Caicos Islands. Grand Turk has (2) Ebenezer and Antioch churches. Providenciales has (5) Bethel, Blue Hills, Ephesus, Filadelfia, Five Cays churches. There is a church on Salt Cay, Kews on North Caicos, and Maranatha on South Caicos.\n\nThe Turks and Caicos Islands belong to the \"Anglican Diocese of the Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos Islands\" within the \"Church in the Province of the West Indies\". The Anglican Church has a significant presence ln the islands and among many-a-tourists.\n\nAs of January 2009, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons) were officially established in the islands. However, the islands are under the jurisdiction of the New Providence, Bahamas District. Until August 2006, the district was presided over by mission president of the Florida Ft Lauderdale Mission. After August 2006, the Bahamas and Turks and Caicos were reassigned to the Jamaica Kingston Mission.\n\nPrior to 1984, Turks and Caicos Islands was a part of Archdiocese of Nassau in the Bahamas. In 1984, it became a mission sui iuris (Independent Mission), the first Ecclesiastical Superior being Archbishop Lawrence Aloysius Burke. During that time the islands were served by a number of priests who stayed anywhere from a few months to a year and a half.\n\nIn the three years prior to 1998 the islands were served by a priest who came for some eight months of the year. The remaining six months of those last three years there was no priest present on the islands.\n\nJuly 1998, at the request of the Holy See, the Archbishop of Newark provided two priests to serve on a full-time basis the Catholic community of the Turks and Caicos Islands. In the Fall of 1998 the Archbishop of Newark, Theodore McCarrick, assumed responsibility as Ecclesiastical Superior of the Mission Sui Iuris of Turks and Caicos Islands. On 9 October 2001 The Most Reverend John J. Myers succeeded Cardinal McCarrick as Archbishop and as Ecclesiastical Superior. Presently serving the Mission is the Reverend Monsignor Ronald J. Rozniak, the Archbishop's Vicar General for the mission, and two parochial priests.\n\nThere are about 51 Muslims living in Turks and Caicos Islands.\n\nThere will be a chabad lubavitch branch opening up in December.\nLong term shluchim (the Lubavitcher rebbes messengers) will be moving out to insure Jewish life in the island.

The lenses typically give the wearer's vision a brown or grey tint. The mirror coating decreases the amount of light passing through the tinted lens by a further 10–60%, making it especially useful for conditions of sand, water, snow, and higher altitudes. Mirrored sunglasses are one-way mirrors.\n\nThe color of the mirror coating is independent of the tint of the lenses. It is determined by the thickness and structure of the layer.\n\nTheir popularity with police officers in the United States has earned them the nickname \"cop shades\". The two most popular styles for these are dual lenses set in metal frames (which are often confused with Aviators), and \"Wraparound\" (a single, smooth, semi-circular lens that covers both eyes and much of the same area of the face covered by protective goggles, combined with a minimal plastic frame and single piece of plastic serving as a nosepad). Wraparound sunglasses are also quite popular in the world of extreme sports.\n\nThe simplest version of a mirror coating is a single layer of a deposited thin film of a suitable metal, usually prepared by ion beam deposition, sputter deposition or vapor deposition. However, this kind of coating is very prone to scratching, and degrades, especially in a corrosive environment like salt water.\n\nMore modern reflective coatings usually have several alternating layers of specific thickness, made of dielectric materials and sometimes metals. The metal layer can be made from titanium, nickel or chromium, or from an alloy like Nichrome or Inconel, and has thickness ranging from 0.5 to 9 nanometers. The dielectric layer comprises a suitable oxide, e.g. chromium oxide, silicon dioxide, or titanium dioxide; its thickness determines the reflective properties of the resulting dielectric mirror. The manufacturing process is similar to making anti-reflective coating, and mirror and antireflective coatings can be deposited in the same sequence of operations.\n\n"}

The purpose of applying the coating may be decorative, functional, or both. The coating itself may be an all-over coating, completely covering the substrate, or it may only cover parts of the substrate. An example of all of these types of coating is a product label on many drinks bottles- one side has an all-over functional coating (the adhesive) and the other side has one or more decorative coatings in an appropriate pattern (the printing) to form the words and images.\n\nPaints and lacquers are coatings that mostly have dual uses of protecting the substrate and being decorative, although some artists paints are only for decoration, and the paint on large industrial pipes is presumably only for the function of preventing corrosion.\n\nFunctional coatings may be applied to change the surface properties of the substrate, such as adhesion, wettability, corrosion resistance, or wear resistance. In other cases, e.g. semiconductor device fabrication (where the substrate is a wafer), the coating adds a completely new property, such as a magnetic response or electrical conductivity, and forms an essential part of the finished product.\n\nA major consideration for most coating processes is that the coating is to be applied at a controlled thickness, and a number of different processes are in use to achieve this control, ranging from a simple brush for painting a wall, to some very expensive machinery applying coatings in the electronics industry. A further consideration for 'non-all-over' coatings is that control is needed as to where the coating is to be applied. A number of these non-all-over coating processes are printing processes.\n\nMany industrial coating processes involve the application of a thin film of functional material to a substrate, such as paper, fabric, film, foil, or sheet stock. If the substrate starts and ends the process wound up in a roll, the process may be termed \"roll-to-roll\" or \"web-based\" coating. A roll of substrate, when wound through the coating machine, is typically called a web.\n\nCoatings may be applied as liquids, gases or solids.\n\n\nNumerous methods exist for evaluating coatings, including both destructive and non-destructive methods. The most common destructive method is microscopy of a mounted cross-section of the coating and substrate. The most common non-destructive techniques include ultrasonic thickness measurement, XRF coatings thickness measurement, and ultra-micro hardness testing. \n\nCoating processes may be classified as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\nCommon roll-to-roll coating processes include:\n\n\n"}

He retired in 1812 due to ill health and was made Commodore-Governor of Newfoundland from 1813 to 1816. In 1821 he was made Governor of Greenwich Hospital in Greenwich, London. Keats held the post until his death at Greenwich in 1834. Keats is remembered as a capable and well respected officer. His actions at the Battle of Algeciras Bay became legendary.\n\nKeats was born at Chalton, Hampshire the son of Rev. Richard Keats, Rector of Bideford and King's Nympton in Devon and Headmaster of Blundells School, Tiverton, by his wife, Elizabeth. His formal education was brief. At the age of nine, in 1766, he entered New College School and was then admitted briefly to Winchester College in 1768 but lacked scholastic aptitude and determined on a career in the Royal Navy.\n\nKeats entered the navy as a midshipman in 1770 aboard the 74-gun under Captain John Montagu and followed Montagu when he was promoted rear admiral, given command of the North American Station and the governorship at Halifax. He served in a number of ships on the Newfoundland Station under his patron and his patron’s son Captain James Montagu.\n\nIn April 1777 he was promoted to lieutenant under Captain Robert Digby in in which he took part in the First Battle of Ushant on 27 July 1778. As one of Digby's followers he was moved with him to the second-rate, ninety-gun . Prince William Henry, later William IV, served aboard \"Prince George\" as a midshipman for almost two years during this time.\n\nIn 1780 Keats was on \"Prince George\" with Admiral Rodney's fleet at the Moonlight Battle that culminated in the relief of Gibraltar. Keats was with the fleet once more when it again relieved the beleaguered rock in 1781. In September 1781 Keats returned to the North American station with Digby in .\n\nOn 18 January 1782 Keats was put in command of the store ship which was later fitted out as a floating battery in the defense of New York City. By May 1782 he had been transferred to the sloop in which he was part of the squadron that captured a French squadron including the 38-gun which was bought into British service. \"Bonetta\" was paid off in 1785 and between that time and 1789 Keats lived in France.\n\nOn 24 June 1789 he was promoted to post-captain in , possibly at the behest of the Duke of Clarence (Prince William Henry) as a royal favour to a friend. Between 1790 and 1793 Keats commanded the frigate on the Channel Station. He commissioned in 1793 as the newly appointed flag-captain to the Duke of Clarence but was to be disappointed when the Board of Admiralty determined that it would be dangerous for the Prince and recalled him to London.\n\nIn 1794 Keats was in Sir John Borlase Warren’s squadron in the Channel in command of the 32-gun frigate . In her he took part in the running battles along the French, English and Irish coasts that became highly publicized and exemplified the romantic image of naval warfare as it was perceived by the general public. In 1795 \"Galatea\" captured \"La Revolutionnaire\".\n\nIn the same year \"Galatea\" took part in the failed landing of an invasion force at Quiberon Bay. The invasion force consisted of French Royalist émigré, counter-revolutionary troops in support of the Chouannerie and Vendée Revolt. They were landed by the Royal Navy on 23 June. The aim of the invasion was to raise the whole of western France in revolt, bring an end to the French Revolution and restore the French monarchy. The Landing of the émigrés at Quiberon was finally repulsed on 21 July, dealing a disastrous blow to the royalist cause.\n\nOn 23 August 1795 Keats in \"Galatea\" drove the French frigate \"Andromaque\" ashore and set her alight to stop the French refloating her.\n\nIn May 1797 \"Galatea\" was at the Nore anchorage and Keats along with several other captains was put ashore during the fleet mutiny.\n\nSubsequently he commissioned the newly built 40-gun . Under Keats she served on the Channel station for several years during which time she captured at least three prizes. The first was the 22-gun Spanish ship \"Union\", which she captured on 14 August 1797. On 9 December 1798 \"Boadicea\" captured the 20-gun French privateer \"L'Invincible General Bonaparte\". The Admiralty took this vessel into service as the 18-gun sloop . On 1 April 1799 Keats also captured \"L'Utile\", a brig of 16 guns. During this time Keats was stationed mainly off Brest. He continued there until 1800 when he was reassigned by Earl St. Vincent to Ferrol.\n\nBy March 1801 Keats was placed in command of the ship with which he is most associated. was a 74-gun third-rate ship-of-the-line ordered in 1795 and completed in 1798.\n\nIn July 1801 she was stationed off Cadiz and took part in the second Battle of Algeciras Bay. During the French and Spanish retreat Admiral Sir James Saumarez hailed \"Superb\" and ordered Keats to catch the allied fleets rear and engage. \"Superb\" was a relatively new ship and had not been long on blockade duty. As a consequence she was the fastest sailing ship-of-the-line in the fleet. As night fell Keats sailed \"Superb\" alongside the 112-gun on her starboard side. Another Spanish ship, the 112-gun , was sailing abreast, on the port side, of \"Real Carlos\". Keats fired into \"Real Carlos\" and some shot passed her and struck \"San Hermenegildo\". \"Real Carlos\" caught fire and Keats disengaged her to continue up the line. In the darkness the two Spanish ships confused one another for British ships and began a furious duel. With \"Real Carlos\" aflame the captain of \"San Hermenegildo\" determined to take advantage and crossed the stern of \"Real Carlos\" in order to deal a fatal broadside that would run the length of the ship through the unprotected stern. A sudden gust of wind brought the two ships together and entangled their rigging. \"San Hermenegildo\" also caught fire and the two enormous three-deck ships exploded. \"Superb\" continued on relatively unscathed and engaged the French 74-gun under Commodore Julien le Roy. \"Saint Antoine\" struck after a brief exchange of broadsides. The action came to an end with the intervention of Captain Amable Troude aboard . Troude placed his ship, which had been damaged in the earlier engagement and could not keep up with the main allied fleet, between the escaping allied fleet and the British. He fought off four ships before escaping into Cadiz.\n\nBoth Troude and Keats were highly praised by their commanders and the general public. Troude received an audience with Napoleon. Nelson said of Keats in a letter to the Duke of Clarence: “Our friend Keats is quite well in his own person he is equal in my estimation to an additional Seventy-four; his life is a valuable one to the State, and it is impossible that your Royal Highness could ever have a better choice of a Sea friend, or Counsellor, if you go to the Admiralty.”\n\nAfter the Treaty of Amiens in 1802 Keats and \"Superb\" remained in the Mediterranean under Admiral Sir Richard Bickerton. When Nelson relieved Bickerton and took command of the fleet in the Mediterranean Keats remained with him off Toulon and accompanied the fleet to the West Indies in 1805 in the famous chase of Admiral Villeneuve that culminated in the Battle of Trafalgar. After the fleet's return to European waters, \"Superb\" was sent to Portsmouth to re-fit. Unfortunately, she did not rejoin the fleet off Cadiz until November 1805, missing the Battle of Trafalgar by less than a month.\n\nOn 9 November 1805 Keats was made an honorary Colonel of Marines, received the thanks of Parliament and a presentation sword from the Lloyd's Patriotic Fund.\n\nAdmiral Duckworth took \"Superb\" as his flagship in 1806. Duckworth took the fleet blockading Cadiz and chased Contre-Admiral Jean-Baptiste Willaumez to the West Indies. Vice-Admiral Corentin Urbain Leissègues had separated from Willaumez in the Atlantic and made for Santo Domingo to resupply and refit. Duckworth was in the process of resupplying his ships at St. Kitts when he learned of the French squadron anchored in Santo Domingo. Duckworth took his squadron of seven line-of-battle ships and attacked Leissègues' five ships of the line. The Battle of San Domingo was the last open sea fleet action of the Napoleonic War. During the battle \"Superb\" suffered 62 casualties in what became an almost total victory for the Royal Navy. Of the five French line-of-battle ships engaged two were captured and three driven on shore and later destroyed. The British did not lose a single ship.\n\nBy 1807 \"Superb\" had returned to the Channel and Keats was relieved by Sir Richard Strachan. Keats then took command of and was promoted commodore with Admiral Gambier’s squadron in the Baltic where between 16 August and 7 September he took part in the Second Battle of Copenhagen. During the battle Keats placed a portrait of Nelson on the mizzen mast. It was later said that the portrait had encouraged and inspired the officers and men aboard.\n\nKeats was promoted rear-admiral on 2 October 1807 and moved into . He led the expedition with Lieutenant General Sir John Moore to the aid of the Swedish at Gothenburg. As a reward for his services he made a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath.\n\nKeats moved his flag to \"Superb\" in early 1808. After convoying the Swedish trade from Gothenburg to England he joined Sir Richard Strachan on his expedition to the Scheldt river. On \"Superb\"s return to Portsmouth in 1809 she was paid off and Keats was promoted to rear-admiral of the white squadron.\n\nOn 26 December 1809 was given the post of His Majesty's Commissioner for the Civil Affairs of Malta. In 1810 after a nearly twenty one year's continuous service took leave ashore.\n\nAfter only a few months however Keats hoisted his flag in and took command of naval forces off Cadiz. On 1 August 1811 Keats was promoted vice-admiral and joined Sir Edward Pellew off Toulon.\n\nKeats was forced to haul down his flag in 1812 due to ill health and in recognition of his service on 9 March 1813 he was made Governor and Commander-in-Chief of Newfoundland. During his term as governor the British government agreed for the first time to let Newfoundland settlers lease land for cultivation. Keats granted 110 leases around St. John's in the first year alone. In 1816 he returned to England and was succeeded as Governor of Newfoundland by Francis Pickmore.\n\nOn 7 May 1818 Keats was promoted to the honorary title of Major-General of His Majesty's Royal Marine Forces. On 12 August 1819 Keats was promoted Admiral of the Blue.\n\nIn 1821 he was further honoured by his appointment as governor of Greenwich Hospital and investiture as Knight Grand Cross of the Most Honourable Military Order of the Bath.\n\nKeats died in Greenwich on 5 April 1834 and his funeral was held at the hospital chapel with the Admiralty Board in attendance. His coffin was borne by six admirals as pall-bearers.\n\nWilliam IV ordered a bust of his friend to be erected in the chapel and it remains there, under the organ loft on the left hand side of the main entrance. The right hand side is occupied by a bust of Sir Thomas Hardy.\n\nIn 1816 Keats married Mary, eldest daughter of the late Francis Hurt of Alderwasley in Derbyshire. There were no children from the marriage.\n\na. The battle is described in the novel \"Master and Commander\" by Patrick O'Brian, from the viewpoint of Jack Aubrey. The battle is also described in the novel \"Touch and Go\", by C. Northcote Parkinson\n\n"}

It begins in Morocco's capital of Rabat, and connects to the northern port of Tanger-Med. The expressway's identity marker is \"A5\".\n\nThe Rabat-Tanger expressway originates at an interchange along the Rabat-Fes expressway, at the end of the Rabat bypass. The road then continues to the toll station at the Kénitra centre interchange, before continuing north towards the Kénitra north interchange where it passes under the RP2 road. Just north of here lies the Kénitra north toll station. The expressway then follows the coast past the fishing village of Moulay Bouselham. 30 km north of there is the town of Larache where there is an intersection. Another 30 km along the way is the interchange at Sidi El Yamani, connecting to the road to Tetouan and Ceuta. There is another intersection at Asilah, with 40 km remaining to Tanger. The road then crosses the Tahaddart river estuary before reaching its final destination.\n\nConstruction started in 1993 and in 1995 the first section, between Rabat and Kénitra north, was opened. The road was prolonged to Larache in 1996. In 2000, the section to Sidi El Yamani was opened, with Asilah being connected in 2002. In July 2005, 12 years after the start of construction, the totality of the axis was completed.\n\nThe axis technically comprises also the Rabat bypass, although it does not conform with motorway regulations.

{"id": "1897262", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1897262", "title": "In Search of Excellence", "text": "In Search of Excellence\n\nIn Search of Excellence is a book written by Tom Peters and Robert H. Waterman, Jr.. First published in 1982, it sold 3 million copies in its first four years, and being the most widely held monograph in the United States from 1989 to 2006 (WorldCat data).\n\nThe book purports to explore the art and science of management used by several 1980s companies.\n\nIn 1982, at the time of publication of \"In Search of Excellence\", America was looking to Japan as the rising economic force. American businesses were studying Japanese management techniques and looking to learn from their successes.\n\n\"In Search of Excellence\" went against this trend, by focusing on American companies and studying what made the most successful American companies successful.\n\n\"In Search of Excellence\" did not start out as a book, as Tom Peters explained when interviewed in 2001 to mark the 20th anniversary of \"In Search of Excellence\". In the same interview, Peters claims that he and Waterman were both consultants on the \"margins\" of McKinsey, based in the San Francisco office.\n\nIn 1977 McKinsey director Ron Daniel launched two projects; the first and major one, the Business Strategy project, was allocated to top consultants at McKinsey's New York City corporate HQ and was given significant resources, but could not manage to effectively implement strategy.\n\nPeters states that directly after graduating with a PhD from Stanford, and returning to McKinsey, Daniel handed him a \"fascinating assignment.\" Motivated by the new ideas coming from Bruce Henderson's Boston Consulting Group, Peters \"was asked [by Daniel] to look at 'organization effectiveness' and 'implementation issues' in an inconsequential offshoot project nested in McKinsey's rather offbeat San Francisco office.\" While Daniel's first project was focused on Business Strategy, this second project was concerned with Organization, which Peters defined as involving \"the structure-and-people side.\" This \"Organization\" project was seen as less important, according to Peters in a Fast Company interview.\n\nDespite being described as \"marginal,\" the project \"had an infinite travel budget that allowed [Peters] to fly first class and stay at top-notch hotels and a license from McKinsey to talk to as many cool people as [he] could all around the United States and the world.\" Peters admits that \"There was no carefully designed work plan. There was no theory that I was out to prove. I went out and talked to genuinely smart, remarkably interesting, first-rate people.\" In addition to Karl Weick and Einar Thorsrud, Peters notes that Douglas McGregor's theory of motivation known as Theory X and Theory Y was directly influential on the direction of the project.\n\nIn a 1978 article, \"Symbols, Patterns and Settings,\" Peters argued that \"shifting organizational structure\" and \"inventing new processes\" - structure and system, respectively - were only two tools of organizational change. Peters then outlines eight \"mundane\" tools that every manager has at their fingertips. He described this article as a \"tentative presentation\" and \"the first public expression of these ideas.\"\n\nIn 1979 McKinsey's Munich office requested Peters to present his findings to Siemens, which provided the spur for Peters to create a 700-slide two-day presentation. Word of the meeting reached the US and Peters was invited to present also to PepsiCo, but unlike the hyper-organised Siemens, the PepsiCo management required a tighter format than 700 slides, so Tom Peters consolidated the presentation into eight themes. These eight would form the chapters of \"In Search of Excellence\".\n\nIn 1980, Waterman joined Peters, and, along with Waterman's friend Tony Athos and Richard Pascale - both academics - came together at a two-day retreat in San Francisco to develop what would become known as the 7S Framework, the same framework that would organize \"In Search of Excellence\". In June 1980, Peters published an op-ed in the \"Manager's Journal\" section of the \"Wall Street Journal\" titled \"The Planning Fetish.\" In this article, he \"stressed the importance of execution and dismissed the whole idea of strategy.\" As strategy was McKinsey's main operation at the time, this was seen as a \"frontal assault\" on the company, leading Mike Bulkin, the head of the New York office, to demand that Daniel fire Peters.\n\nThe primary \"innovative\" theme that under-girded what would become \"In Search of Excellence\" was that \"structure is not organization.\" This also happened to be the title of a 1980 journal article authored by Bob Waterman, Tom Peters, and Julien Phillips in which they argue that the \"picture of the thing is not the thing...An organizational structure is not an organization.\" This article also introduced what would become the McKinsey 7S Framework.\n\nIn December 1981, Peters left the company, after agreeing to a fifty percent royalty split with McKinsey. Later co-author Waterman stayed at the firm for three more years, but received no royalties from \"In Search of Excellence\"\n\nThe book consisted of three parts:\n\n\nIn the first chapter of the book, Peters and Waterman introduced the background for the book and their research method.\n\nInitial investigations\n\nThey started out by interviewing leaders of successful organisations to get a feel for what themes emerged.\n\nThey then refined their initial observations, using the approach described below.\n\nThe McKinsey 7S framework\n\nPeters and Waterman were concerned with how organizations were organized and managed. They wondered whether structure follows strategy, as Alfred Chandler had suggested.\n\nTo address this, their perspective was that:\n\nThey used these seven \"variables\" to create a visual framework, which became known as the McKinsey 7S Framework.\n\nThe interviews and resulting insights\n\nThey then used their 7S framework as a lens through which to evaluate organizational excellence. They conducted in-depth interviews with leaders at 43 \"excellent\" companies using this lens.\n\nThey then reduced the set of emerging insights from these interviews down to eight \"themes.\"\n\nCompanies covered\n\nForbes.com provides a list of companies covered in the book, and their subsequent financial performance. This list includes only publicly traded companies.\n\n\"In Search of Excellence\" is a critique of a \"rationalist\" approach to management.\n\nThe second chapter of the book, \"The Rational Model,\" introduces and then critiques the rationalist approach.\n\nAn example of the rationalist mindset is reproduced below:\n\nBy contrast, a more \"social\" form of management takes into account the realities of what really motivates people. This set of real human motivations is explored in the third chapter, \"Man Waiting for Motivation.\"\n\nThe fourth chapter puts these concerns into a historical context, exploring the evolution of management theories between 1900 and the time of publication of the book in the early 1980s. The latest era of management is characterised as more \"social\" than \"rational,\" meaning that real human motivations drive business goals and activities. It also more \"open\" than \"closed,\" meaning that outside forces such as market pressures can shape the evolution of structure and organisation within a firm.\n\nThis leads to an increasing concern with the ongoing evolution of an organization, and the role of culture in maintaining and shaping an organization.\n\nUltimately, these chapters would be seen in today's terms as advocating for leadership over management. Leaders articulate values and purpose, and achieve buy-in to vision and values from employees.\n\nThese chapters set the foundation for the rest of the book, which address eight core themes for the book.\n\nPeters and Waterman found eight common themes which they argued were responsible for the success of the chosen corporations. The book devotes one chapter to each theme.\n\n\nBefore and after \"In Search of Excellence\", Peter Drucker was probably the preeminent management theorist.\n\nHowever, while Peters and Waterman reviewed management theory over the preceding eight decades within \"In Search of Excellence,\" they did not consider Peter Drucker's contributions to management theory within their review.\n\nAccording to the \"Los Angeles Times\", Peters and Waterman had not read Drucker's work:\n\nIt seems unlikely that Peters and Waterman were completely unaware of Peter Drucker, if for no other reason than they cite Drucker three times in the index of \"In Search of Excellence.\"\n\nPeters himself wrote that he read Drucker's \"The Effective Executive\" in 1968:\n\nPeters shared in an interview that when writing \"In Search of Excellence\", he was \"pissed off\" at Peter Drucker:\n\nApparently Peters had construed Druckman as advocating a Taylor-style reductionism:\n\nAfter publication of \"In Search of Excellence\", Peters re-read a wider body of Drucker's work, and commented:\n\nIn 2005, on the occasion of Drucker's passing, Peters summarized Drucker's contributions to the theory of management:\n\nPeter Drucker presaged and covered similar perspectives to Peters and Waterman's approach to management theory, for example in Drucker's \"The Practice of Management\" (first edition in 1954).\n\nJim Collins noted in \"Built to Last\" (p. 254) that a number of companies featured in both \"In Search of Excellence\" and in \"Built to Last\", such as HP and P&G, \"were tremendously influenced by Drucker's writings.\"\n\nThe omission of any reference to Drucker's theory of management in \"In Search of Excellence\" was a serious gap, undermining Peters and Waterman's claim that \"In Search of Excellence\" helped develop a new approach to management theory.\n\nThis omission doesn't however change the validity of the points raised by both Drucker and Peters and Waterman.\n\nPeters and Waterman organized their work into eight \"themes.\"\n\nThere may be issues with their chosen way of structuring this information for presentation, including atomicity and surfacing.\n\n1. Atomicity\n\nSometimes the one \"theme\" consisted of two quite different points.\n\nFor example, \"Hands-on, value driven\" is about two different things:\n\n\nThese are related, because leaders being hands-on is a way to institutionalise and embed the guiding values. But conceptually these are two different points, and arguably are better discussed as such.\n\nSimilarly, \"Simple form, lean staff\" is about two different things:\n\n\nThese are different points. So much so that the chapter on \"Simple form, lean staff\" does not discuss \"lean staff\" at all. It is covered only in an overview of the chapter, elsewhere in the book.\n\n\"Atomicity\" would reduce each of the book's \"theme's\" to making a single major point.\n\n2. Surfacing.\n\nSometimes there is an idea within a \"theme\" that arguably deserves to be surfaced as a main theme in itself.\n\nFor example, the theme \"A bias to action\" in \"In Search of Excellence\" also includes the sub-idea that excellent organizations adopt an experimental approach. Arguably this deserves to be raised to the level of a major \"theme\" in and of itself in the book - as it is in Jim Collins' \"Built To Last\" (in his chapter on experimentation, \"Try A Lot of Stuff and Keep What Works\").\n\nIn December, 2001, \"Fast Company\" printed an article, crediting Tom Peters as author, entitled \"Tom Peters's True Confessions\". Most of the \"confessions\" were humorously self-deprecating remarks (\"In Search of Excellence\" had been \"an afterthought... a hip-pocket project that was never supposed to amount to much\"). One of them, however, used the term \"faked data:\"\n\n\"BusinessWeek\" ran an article about Fast Company's article. As related by \"BusinessWeek\", the article was actually written by Fast Company founding editor Alan M. Webber, based on a six-hour interview with Peters. Peters reviewed and approved the article prior to publication, but the actual phrase \"we faked the data\" was Webber's, and Peters had not actually used these words during the interview. \"BusinessWeek\" quoted Peters as saying \"Get off my case. We didn't fake the data.\" According to \"BusinessWeek\", Peters says he was \"pissed\" when he first saw the cover. \"It was his [Webber's] damn word,\" he says. \"I'm not going to take the heat for it.\"\n\nAs early as 1984 it was apparent, to certain analysts, that the book's choice of companies was poor to indifferent. NCR, Wang Labs, Xerox and others did not produce excellent results in their balance sheets in the 1980s.\n\nRick Chapman titled his book on high-tech marketing fiascoes, \"In Search of Stupidity\", as a nod to Peters's book and the disasters that befell many of the companies it profiled. He notes that \"with only a few exceptions... [the excellent companies were] large firms with dominant positions in markets that were senescent or static.\"\n\nIn an article in \"Fast Company,\" Peters remarked that the criticism that \"If these companies are so excellent, Peters, then why are they doing so badly now,\" in his opinion \"pretty much misses the point.\"\n\nThe research methodology employed by the authors of this book is also severely criticized by Phil Rosenzweigh in his book \"The Halo Effect\" \nas the \"Delusion of Connecting the Winning Dots\". Rosenzweigh opines that it was not possible to identify the traits that make a company perform simply by studying already-performing companies which Peters and Waterman did.\n\nAlmost 40 years after its original publication \"In Search of Excellence\" remains a widely read classic, and an influential book for leaders and managers.\n\nA 2002 panel of experts convened by \"Forbes\" rated \"In Search of Excellence\" as the most influential business and management book from the decades between 1980 and 2000.\n\n\"Inc\" magazine reported that by March 1999, \"In Search of Excellence\" had sold over 4.5 million copies. \"Forbes\" in 2016 ranked the best-selling business books ever - based on sales tracking data that was not collected before 2004 - and put \"Strengths Finder 2.0\" at number 1 with 4.5 million copies sold. Since \"In Search of Excellence\" had equalled this level of sales in 1999, and presumably made further sales in the succeeding 17 years, there is an argument to be made that \"In Search of Excellence\" is either the best-selling business book of all time or the equal best-selling business book of all time.\n\nTom Peters identified several key contributions from the book, that changed the field of future management books.\n\nFirst was the reorientation from a focus on strategy to recognising the importance of \"soft\" aspects of business like culture and people.\n\nSecond was the use of research and specific case studies to bring ideas about management to life:\n\n\"In Search of Excellence\" opened up the way for further research and publication around excellence in business. Jim Collins's books \"\" and its sequel \"Good to Great\" are widely-known influential later works in this genre.\n\nThird, Peters reflected that \"In Search of Excellence\" brought management ideas to a broader audience than previous theorists like Peter Drucker had reached.\n\nThe ideas in the book remain influential today.\n\nThe book essentially boils down to five main tenets:\n\n\nThe authors advocated an agile, customer-centric organization with a core commitment to values.\n\nFrom that perspective, many of the points made in the book are timeless rather than ephemeral - and they stand strong today.\n\n\"In Search of Excellence\" is not widely regarded as being great at predicting future success for individual \"excellent\" companies.\n\nHowever, the set of \"excellent\" companies studied, as a whole, still outperformed the market. A 2002 analysis in \"Forbes\" found that\n\n\n"}

Together they established a military government that ruled Chile from 1973 until 1990.\n\nBorn in La Serena, he was son of Vice Admiral José Toribio Merino Saavedra, , and of Bertina Castro Varela. He entered the Naval Academy in 1931, graduating in 1936 as a midshipman. During World War II he served in the US Navy at the until 1945. After World War II he served in different units of the Chilean Navy such as: Destructor Serrano (2do), Crucero O'Higgins (4to) (CL02), Corbeta Papudo(1º), Transporte Angamos (3ro)\n\nBetween 1955 and 1957 he served as aide and counsel in weaponry to the Chilean embassy in London. During the construction of the s \"Williams\" and \"Riveros\". In 1960, he was assigned as a teacher at the Naval War Academy (AGN) teaching Logistics, Geopolitics, Geostrategy. In 1969 he became Naval Director of Weapons. In January 1970 he was appointed as Director of Navy Services, and in November of the same year he assumed the command of the Chilean main combat fleet (CJE).\n\nAfter the military coup that ousted socialist President Salvador Allende on September 11, 1973, a military junta was formed to govern the country, and Merino was named commander-in-chief of the Chilean Navy. General Pinochet was soon named as the chairman of the ruling junta, as he was head of the army, the oldest branch of the Chilean military. As the navy was the second oldest branch, Merino was vice-chairman and second-in-command to Pinochet.\n\nAs the second in command and also as member of the Governing Junta he was in charge of the economic sector of the country and presided over the Economic Committee of the Council of Ministers, where the economic measures were born. In addition, all the decrees were elaborated and the laws on the matters had to dictate to regulate the economic sector.\n\nFrom the Economic Committee of the Council of Ministers, he impelled, the first economic measures of the Military Government, the liberation of prices of goods and services; the fiscal cost was reduced and the interest rates were freed to give birth to capital markets ; the companies of the State were reorganized as well, standardizing them.\n\nBy the end of 1974, he represented the Government and State of Chile before the Spanish Government, to renegotiate contracts that appeared unfavorable to Chile. Specially, the Pegaso contract renegotiated, successfully. The study of the Statute for foreign investors was initiative of Admiral Merino. He impelled the study and the decree law of exporter promotion of Chile, which gave origin to PROCHILE. In 1975 he participated in the Statute of the Governing Junta, the Legislative Commissions and the Secretariat of Legislation were created.\n\nAdmiral Merino presided over the First Legislative Commission after a law established the organization of the junta was enacted on 1974 which made the ruling junta the legislative power of the country and vested formally Pinochet the executive power as the self-proclaimed new President of Chile. Under Merino's leadership, the junta as the Legislative Commission first legislated mainly for the economic sectors and of Foreign Relations, and soon, the Fourth Legislative Commission of the junta enacted laws for the Defense Sector. In this period impulse the Decree Law to discount the forestation, settling down incentives to develop the plantations of this nature in the country. Again it represented the Government of Chile before the United States Government and one met with President Jimmy Carter. With great sense of social justice, Law N 3,480, allowed to indebted of the System of Saving and the Loan Houses to re-pact its debts, which came to favour of workers of the medium class sector.\n\nDuring the conflict with Argentina over the Beagle Channel, Merino was one of the most belligerent junta members. He only reluctantly accepted Pope John Paul II's peace proposal, telling him, \"I only signed the treaty because I'm Catholic and I respect Your Holiness. If I weren't, I wouldn't have signed it.\" Also, he ordered the commander of the surface fleet \"go there... and win the war\".\n\nIn 1980 law N 3,500 was dictated to the decree that created the new provisional system. Admiral Merino was a great defender of this legislation, giving his approval and endorsement during the study and discussion of this matter. He was the main legislative person in charge of the materialization. When in 1980 the new constitution was approved, Admiral Merino presided over the Governing Junta. This constituted the legislative power legitimized by the constitution and remained in effect until March 1990, when democratic government was restored. In addition the admiral presided over the fifth Legislative Commission of the junta.\n\nIn 1982 the country was affected by the worldwide recession and the Government had to take economic measures to palliate the crisis that developed.\nAdmiral Merino, from the Legislative Power, impelled laws on the modernization of the financial sector, guarantee of the State to the deposits and savings, lowering of the tariffs to the imports and in general, the normalization of the sectors more affected by the crisis, giving the maximum support to the Executive authority, which was allowed to remove to the country from the crisis.\n\nDuring this period he impelled the initiative of the Law of promotion to the Merchant Marine, remarkably contributing to the growth of this sector and also to the sector of shipyards and naval industry through the Law N 18.454. He presented the relative motions to replace the Code of Commerce; to adapt the Chilean marine limits to the Convention of Jamaica, by means of the corresponding reform to the Civil Code, and to countermand the legislation that allowed the therapeutic abortion, everything which was approved by means of the corresponding laws dictated in that period.\n\nAlso, he impelled all the Constitutional Statutory laws, which allowed the Military Government to fulfill the constitutional itinerary and delivery the power to the civil elected authority. In 1989 he proposed to the Executive authority the law of Fishing and Agriculture, which was obtained after a great discussion in the sector. Its aim was to put the conditions for the conservation of renewable the marine resources.\n\nFinally, it corresponded to him to preside over the Joint Legislative Commission destined to reform the Political Constitution, whose text, approved by the Governing Junta, was ratified by the conducted plebiscite the 30 of June 1989.

It is episode sixteen of season nine, and the final episode of the series. It originally aired on May 16, 2005, and was preceded by an hour-long special looking back on the whole series.\n\nThe episode starts with Ray walking into the kitchen having just seen his doctor. He tells Debra that the doctor told him his adenoids have to come out. Debra tells him that it's a routine procedure and Ray is appalled at Debra's lack of concern for his well-being. Marie worriedly comes rushing in and hugs Ray, saying the doctors are \"trying to take a piece of my Raymond away.\" Ray gives Debra a hard time over the course of the next week, fretting about his upcoming surgery and asking questions such as \"What if the nurses' top button is undone and the doctor gets distracted?\" On the day of the operation, Ray goes into surgery and Debra, Robert, Amy, Frank and Marie wait in the waiting room. Robert laments how the whole world has to stop because Ray is having a routine procedure, and states that the only reason he is there is because Marie dragged him there since he is the same blood type as Raymond. The family tells jokes to lighten the mood, of which Marie disapproves; she says that she needs to go to the bathroom and when she returns everyone should have a sign of concern.\n\nA few moments after Marie leaves, a nurse enters the waiting room and asks for Debra. Debra asks how the procedure went and the nurse, after asking whether Ray had any medical conditions that he did not disclose, states that they are having trouble bringing Ray out of the anesthesia. Debra starts to cry and the rest of the family (minus Marie who is in the bathroom) comes over. Debra tells them what the nurse said and everyone begins to panic. Robert attempts to rush to the operating table, telling the nurse that he and Ray are the same blood type and that he can wake his brother up. Just before he walks through the door, the doctor emerges and says that everything is fine and that it occasionally happens due to hypertension. Everyone is relieved and agrees that they can't tell Ray or Marie about what happened.\n\nLater that evening, Debra brings Ray ice cream in bed. She watches as he starts eating and looks at him lovingly, telling him about what she is planning to do the next day, breaking down when she starts talking about the kids. Ray asks her if it is \"that time of the month.\" Debra begins passionately kissing Ray. Meanwhile, over at Marie's and Frank's, Frank reflects on what happened. Marie notices something is up because he's too silent and he turned down dessert. She finally gets Frank to tell her what happened at the hospital and is hysterical when she finds out that \"her son almost died\" and nobody told her.\n\nBack across the street, Ray and Debra are still in bed kissing and Marie rushes into their bedroom, jumping on the bed and embracing Raymond. With a central theme of the series being Marie's coddling of Ray, an annoyed Debra says to nobody in particular, \"I knew one day this would happen.\" Ray is mortified that \"his worst nightmare is coming true\" and asks what is going on. Amy, Robert, and Frank come into the bedroom and Frank tells Ray about what happened at the hospital. Ray is furious that nobody told him, but becomes curious as to how everyone reacted when they thought he might be dead. There is a pause and Ray irritably envisions what he thinks must have been going through Debra's head, saying that while she has to plan a funeral and raise three kids herself, she can finally start dating again. The scene takes on a moment of seriousness when Frank shouts at Raymond that he saw Debra fall apart in the waiting room, telling his son \"I've never seen her like that, and I'll tell you, I never want to see her like that again!\" Amy says that Robert had to pull the car over on the way home from the hospital because he was crying after \"You Are the Sunshine of My Life\" came on the radio (though Robert claims he pulled over because he thought he hit a cat). Everyone leaves and Debra and Ray are alone again. While one of the themes in the show has centered on Debra's constant annoyance at Ray, they both express how much they love one another.\n\nThe final scene of the series shows the entire family eating breakfast together after Frank breaks Marie's stove in an attempt to \"work on it.\" Each character seems to emote an amalgam of their signature qualities as they sit and eat together, and with Ray at the center of the table, Debra tells Ray, \"It's getting a little crowded in here,\" to which Ray responds, \"Yeah, you know what? We need a bigger table.\"\n\nFilming of the episode began on January 20, 2005 (Actual film was used for this series).\n\n\nOn the night of its airing, \"The Finale\" aired after \"Everybody Loves Raymond: The Last Laugh\", an hour-long behind-the-scenes documentary of making the episode; and an episode of \"Late Show with David Letterman\" that re-showed Romano's 1995 skit on the show that caused \"Everybody Loves Raymond\" to be green-lit. The top price for a 30-second commercial during the U.S. broadcast was approximately $1 million. The episode, according to the Nielsen ratings, averaged 33 million viewers, the largest audience in the show's nine-year run.\n\nMiriam Di Nunzio of \"Chicago Sun-Times\", awarding \"The Finale\" three-and-a-half stars, wrote the premise of all the family members loving each other made the episode \"emotional and unforgettable.\" Jeffrey Robinson called it \"a great episode with a solid combination of heartwarming material and comedy,\" also stating no other \"Raymond\" episode had the same level of sentimentality.\n"}

The trail is heavily used.\n\nThere are two trails between Lexington Reservoir and downtown Los Gatos. The portion of the trail on the west side of the creek is the Los Gatos Creek Trail proper and is a smooth, wide, unpaved trail on an old railway bed. The portion on the east side is the Jones Trail near the reservoir which connects to the Flume Trail. The north portion of this trail is for pedestrians only as it's windy and goes down to the stream level in several places. Jones Road is an alternative for cyclists. The Jones and Flume trail connect with Novitiate Park and the St. Joseph's Hill Open Space Preserve. There is a limited amount of parking available in Novitiate Park and at the end of Jones Road.\nThere are mile markers on the Los Gatos Creek trail, with the mile zero marker being located about north of the trailhead from Alma Bridge Road. The first half-mile offers a significant drop in elevation.\n\nAs the trail reaches downtown Los Gatos, the first access point is at the Main Street bridge. The trail then passes the 1854 Forbes Mill, which houses a history museum. It then crosses from the east to the west of Highway 17 via a dedicated bridge. From this point northward the trail is paved. Next, there is an access point immediately behind the Old Town shopping area. 250 yards to the North, there is an access point and a parking lot with a few spaces meant for the trail next to a small park north of Old Town that can be reached via Miles Avenue.\n\nThe trail next runs through Oak Meadow Park and Vasona Park. Attractions in this pair of parks include the Billy Jones Wildcat Railroad and a T33 airplane that kids can crawl on. The trail follows the east side of the lake and goes up and over the dam. \n\nAfter travelling under highway 85, the trail next enters Los Gatos Creek County Park. Attractions in this park include fishing, a casting pond, and a dog park. A bike/pedestrian bridge across Highway 17 connects to the trail at this point.\n\nThe trail goes through Campbell Park. Downtown Campbell is only a three block walk to the west from the trail via Campbell Avenue. The trail is present on both sides of the creek from Campbell Park south to the bridge just north of San Tomas Expressway. An parallel mountain bike single-track trail exists east of the trail on the east side of the creek between the trail and the freeway.\n\nThe trail next passes by the back of the Pruneyard Shopping Center in Campbell. The access point is at the northwest corner of the complex, behind the parking structure. The Pruneyard has offices, shops, restaurants, and a movie theater.\n\nThe trail next heads through San Jose's Willow Glen neighborhood, ending at Meridian Avenue.\n\nA section of trail connects Lonus St. and Dupont Avenue, traveling under I-280. This section provides a key link for the trail as a whole, connecting Willow Glen and Downtown and removing the previous surface-street crossing of I-280. This section terminates at Dupont Avenue, immediately below a set of stairs that allows easy access to the bridge that carries West San Carlos Street over the creek and the Caltrain lines. This bridge connects the trail into central downtown San Jose.\n\nThe Guadalupe River Trail can be reached by travelling east on the nice bike trail on Willow Avenue, turning left onto Delmas Avenue and then right onto Virginia Avenue. Travel east on W. Virginia Avenue until you reach the termination of the Guadalupe River Trail, which is on the northside of W. Virginia Ave, just east of the bridge over highway 87.\n\nThe city of San Jose has been actively developing the Three Creeks Trail on an abandoned former WPR/UPRR rail spur. Most of that trail is complete. The northern end of this rail spur crosses Lonus Avenue, is part of the defined project, and is awaiting the opening of the bridge over the creek just south of Lonus Avenue. Opening this bridge will allow connection to the northern section of the Los Gatos Creek Trail without requiring travel on busy Lincoln Avenue.\n\nA bridge across highway 17 connects to the trail at the south end of Los Gatos Creek County Park.\n\nThe connection is via University Avenue and Miles Avenue, which is south of Los Gatos-Saratoga Road. The Town of Los Gatos has applied for grants to improve this access.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1897313", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1897313", "title": "Christian punk", "text": "Christian punk\n\nChristian punk is a form of Christian music and a subgenre of punk rock with some degree of Christian lyrical content. Much disagreement persists about the boundaries of the subgenre, and the extent that their lyrics are explicitly Christian varies among bands. For example, The Crucified explicitly rejected the classification of \"Christian punk\" while staying within the Christian music industry.\n\nGiven the nature of punk and some of its subgenres, such as hardcore punk, many bands have been rejected by the Christian and CCM music industry. Christian punk has been deemed novel in that it \"seeks authenticity in two differently organized and orientated cultures: secular punk on the one hand and Evangelical youth culture and CCM on the other\".\n\nIt has been noted that, \"measured purely by record sales, Christian punk dwarfs all other religious contributions to the genre\", with certain individual Christian punk bands outselling the entire market for the next largest religious punk genre, Krishnacore.\n\nChristian punk's origins during the wider 1980s punk rock scene are somewhat obscure. The rise of the Jesus Movement and its cultural institutions, such as Jesus People USA (JPUSA), served as an incubator for various Christian subcultures including punk, in part through JPUSA's label Grrr Records. Crashdog is one characteristically punk band that was rooted in JPUSA. In the 1980s, many bands performed at Chuck Smith's Calvary Chapel in Orange County California. One popular band within that scene was Undercover, who proclaimed that \"God Rules\", with a combination of rockabilly and hardcore punk elements. Other notable early Christian punk bands included the Altar Boys, Nobody Special, The Crucified, Circle of Dust, Under Midnight, Scaterd Few and One Bad Pig.\n\nDuring the 1990s, the underground Christian punk scene grew as bands such as MxPx, Ghoti Hook, Squad Five-O, The Huntingtons, Slick Shoes, Dogwood, Pocket Change, Officer Negative, Blaster the Rocket Man and Headnoise greatly influenced many of their peers and paved the way for many bands to follow.\n\nIn the 21st century, developments in Christian punk have paralleled the broader punk scene, with bands such as Relient K, Hawk Nelson, FM Static, Flatfoot 56, Stellar Kart, and This Providence becoming popular with more mainstream audiences.\n\nFashion is similar to normal punk fashion, but features Christian symbols such as the Christian Ichthys, the cross, crown of thorns, the JCHC symbol, and similar symbols. Chi Rho is a popular symbol amongst more anarcho-Christian bands, such as The Psalters. In Europe the most used symbol is a modified anarchy symbol made up of the Greek characters A and Ω. These two Greek letters, \"Alpha\" & \"Omega\" (the beginning and end of the Greek alphabet), are taken from and when used together in Christian art symbolize that God is eternal, omnipresent, and the giver and taker of life. The symbol is a visual play on the anarchy symbol but with a different meaning and intent.\n\nThere are strong elements of anti-authoritarianism in the punk subculture and in Christianity, such as challenging the uncritical acceptance of social norms in the church and the world. One illustration of this is seen in the concept of \"anticonformity\", which can be seen in Christian punk music, including the song \"Anticonformity\" by Krystal Meyers. Within this perspective, the Christian's view of anticonformity is different from the punk view. The Christian's reason for anticonformity is found in the Biblical Epistle to the Romans: \"Do not conform to the patterns of this world, but be transformed.\" Popular culture is also commented on or satirized by Christian punk bands. One of Relient K's most popular songs from their self-titled debut album, \"My Girlfriend\", contained the line, \"Marilyn Manson ate my girlfriend.\" Calibretto 13 wrote songs critical of MTV, such as \"Why Can't I Be on MTV?\" and conformity, as in \"Sheep of the USA\". The Deadlines, likewise, parodied horror film themes on their album \"The Death and Life Of...\". One analysis notes that the \"Evangelical authenticity of Christian punk is also predicated on the same anticommercialism of secular punk\", which is \"not a total rejection of commerce, but an insistence that the music and its spiritual sentiments supersede the profit\".\n\nDetractors, however, view punk as anti-religious. Adherence to the practice of Christianity (or any religion, established or not) is, by definition, conformity to rules set forth by someone other than the individual for him or herself. Because punk is ideologically nihilistic, many view \"Christian Punk\" as an oxymoron and view it simply as a subgenre of Christian rock and completely separate from punk rock; although Christian punk appropriated punk sound and fashion, no other similarities exist and the two genres have completely isolated origins. Followers of Christian Punk tend to cite punk's individualistic values and argue that punk ideology does not preclude critical and non-dogmatic religious belief.\n\nSome Christian Punks also do not agree with or are very critical of organized religion. They say that real Christianity is not just a religion because it's not supposed to be about rituals and rules; attacking these notions of legalism is a common theme in Christian punk lyrics, especially with older Christian punk bands, such as Nobody Special, Ninety Pound Wuss, Scaterd Few, and One Bad Pig. They believe true Christianity is a relationship with Jesus Christ, not necessarily a religion. Many Christian Punks are against religion like other Punks, yet they are strongly in support of a personal relationship with Jesus Christ, separate from rules and tradition. This idea gave rise to Christian punk's term \"JCHC\", meaning \"Jesus Christ Hard Core\", which draws its name from an Officer Negative song of the same name.\n\nAlthough punk rock has strong ties to anarchism and Marxism, Christian Punks are not a subculture of Marxism or a form of anarchy or communism, instead, it is a subculture with both Christian and Punk affiliations. This belief was often held by extreme conservatives during the 1970s and 1980s, however, this was primarily used because of the clash between the King-James-Only Movement and the Jesus Movement. Evangelists such as Jimmy Swaggart associated the Jesus Movement and Christian rock in general as anti-Christian.\n\nThe vast majority of Christian punk bands do not advocate anarchy or communism; Officer Negative's logo is a parody of the Circle-A commonly associated with anarchism. Many Christian punk bands, especially pop-punk bands such as Relient K, FM Static, and MxPx, have very few songs about political topics; others, most notably older bands, contain strongly political lyrics in many of their songs. Political Christian punk bands come from a variety of areas on the political spectrum. The Psalters, who openly advocate the ideas of anarcho-primitivism, Liberation theology) and Christian anarchism, are Christians who believe God is the only true authority. Some politicized Christian punk bands are also socialists. Crashdog operated a section of their website devoted to political issues and candidates that they supported, such as former United States Green Party Presidential candidate Ralph Nader and various human rights causes. Crashdog disbanded in the late 1990s to start Ballydowse, a more political band which also took strong stances on human rights issues.\n\nOther Christian punk bands take more conservative stances. Calibretto 13's song \"America\", from their album \"Adventures in Tokyo,\" expressed the band's displeasure with America's moral decline. Christian punk bands are also often vocal against abortion in their songs. Rock for Life categorizes bands based on their advocacy for or against abortion; they include many Christian punk bands, such as Dogwood, Flatfoot 56, Relient K, and One-21, on their list of pro-life bands.\n\n\n\n"}

He is most known for the 1895 story of \"Travel Diary of Ebrahim Beg\" (\"sīyāhat nāmeh-ī Ebrāhīm-ī Beg\"). This work was critical in the development of novel writing in twentieth-century Iran, and played an important political role as well. The story was a criticism on Iran's political and social affairs. It was widely read in Iran and gained the interest of revolutionaries and reformers who made the Constitutional Revolution of 1906.\n\nMaraghei was born into a family of merchants who, although were initially followers of Shafi’i Sunni school, later became Shias. He received schooling until the age of sixteen and then joined his father’s trade and worked as a merchant. Facing troubles for agitating officials (of the \"kadkhuda\" and \"farash\" titles in particular), he left Iran for Tbilisi where he worked as a small merchant, at a time when Iranian workers were gradually moving to the city for work. He was eventually employed at the Iranian consulate, but the mismanagement caused him to leave. He then went to Russia and renounced his Iranian citizenship, which gave him a guilty conscience (he regained his Iranian citizenship later through a connection in Istanbul). Maraghei then took permanent residence in Istanbul where he became associated with Persian-language s\"hams\" paper published in Istanbul and \"hablul matin\" published in Calcutta.\n\nThe main character in the \"Travel Diary of Ebrahim Beg\" resembles the author himself. Ebrahim too is a merchant who lives outside the country of his birth, but has a mental and spiritual preoccupation with his homeland, and above all, he wants it to change and reform. Ebrahim lives in Egypt where his father took residence many years ago, and has a reputation as an honest merchant. He loves Iran so much that he refuses to speak Arabic. The image of his homeland Iran is conceived utopically. His love for Iran motivates him to travel there; but, he is also motivated by his father’s will that instructs him to take time off from work and travel for several years recording his experiences. Before reaching Iran, Ebrahim is saddened when he sees miserable Iranians migrants doing the most difficult labor. His despair is only exacerbated when he reaches Iran. Ebrahim travels through many cities, and everyone suffers from the same problems: people are ignorant and self-centered; the clerics are deceitful, act for their own profit, and focus more on ritual purity than on the well-being of the nation; state officials (even in consulates abroad) take bribes, disregard the rule of law, assign jobs without regard for merit, and subordinate the nation’s interests to colonial concessions. Then, there are infrastructural problems: no institutions exist to address widespread opium use that even has currency among the ulema, clean water is hard to come by and there are not adequate schools and health facilities.\n\nIn Tehran, Ebrahim seeks to meet officials and explain to them the poor conditions of the country so that they may act. But, his eloquent descriptions are futile: officials become irritated and ask him to go away. Because of their response (or lack thereof), he puts his suggestions into writing. His reforms include respect for freedom and independence, the advancement of nation’s industries, promotion of culture, ending of colonial influence, and creation of a trade surplus.\n\n"}

Early on he wrestled as Bruce Reed adopting the “Hacksaw\" nickname over time. Reed and Jerry Roberts beat Mike George and Bob Sweetan for the NWA Central States Tag Team Championship in 1980 and lost it to The Kelly Twins in January 1981. His next title also came as one half of a tag team when he and Sweet Brown Sugar won the Florida version of the NWA North American Tag Team Championship when they beat Dory Funk, Jr. and David Von Erich in 1982. Reed wrestled mainly for the NWA in the early 1980s and made a name for himself in their St. Louis, Florida Championship Wrestling and Georgia Championship Wrestling territories.\n\nReed established himself as a force to be reckoned with while competing in Bill Watts’ Mid-South Wrestling from 1983 through early 1986. In Mid-South, he was known as “Hacksaw\" Butch Reed and came into the territory as a tag team partner for the main face in the territory the Junkyard Dog. Reed immediately came face to face with \"Hacksaw\" Jim Duggan over the “Hacksaw\" nickname. Back in 1983, Duggan was part of the heel group the \"Rat Pack\" along with Ted DiBiase and Matt Borne and used every dirty move he could think of to beat Butch Reed. Reed and Duggan would feud over the “Hacksaw\" name until Jim Duggan turned face. Duggan's face turn resulted in Butch Reed's heel turn when Duggan was picked to be the Junkyard Dog's tag team partner over Reed.\n\nReed appeared on TV stating that \"Butch Reed is going to start looking out for Butch Reed\", which prompted the Junkyard Dog (JYD) to join him in the ring. After arguing back and forth, Reed attacked JYD and was soon joined in the attack by Ted Dibiase. On July 16, 1983, Butch Reed won the Mid-South North American Heavyweight Championship and proceeded to turn back JYD's challenges in subsequent months. In October 1983, Reed's arrogance made him agree to let the Mid-South fans pick a challenger for the North American title; he let them pick from the JYD, “Hacksaw\" Jim Duggan, newcomer Krusher Khruschev, and Magnum T.A.. The fans picked JYD but Reed dismissed the choice; he also said Duggan and Khruschev did not deserve a shot and instead gave the title shot to T.A. As fate would have it, T.A. beat Reed to win the title, then lost it 12 days later to Nikolai Volkoff.\n\nOn the same night that Reed lost the North American title, he and partner Jim Neidhart beat Magnum T.A. and “Hacksaw\" Jim Duggan to win the Mid-South Tag Team Championship. After a few weeks the North American title was returned to Reed, claiming that the title match with T.A. was not legal since the fans chose JYD. Reed's run as a double champion did not last long as JYD got his title shot with Dusty Rhodes as the special guest referee. After losing the North American title, Reed and Neidhart focused on the tag team titles and defended them against all comers. When Magnum and Mr. Wrestling II challenged for the titles, they felt that the challengers had to put up something of their own: Mr. Wrestling II's mask. Mr. Wrestling did not unmask that night as they took the gold from Reed and Neidhart in a Steel cage match on Christmas of 1983. Neidhart and Reed started to blame each other and had a short, brutal feud.\n\nThe Neidhart feud was soon replaced with one with Terry Taylor who came out to save Neidhart from being beaten down with a football helmet after a match. The Reed/Taylor feud raged all through the spring of 1984 and was instrumental in establishing Terry Taylor as a star in Mid-South. The feud soon expanded to include \"Nature Boy\" Buddy Landel as Reed's tag team partner and saw Reed attack Taylor with a “Coalminer’s Glove\" on several occasions. After fighting with Terry Taylor for months on end, Reed's attention turned from Taylor back to his old enemy the Junkyard Dog. During a match, Reed and Landel attacked JYD as he performed under a mask as “Stagger Lee\" and painted him yellow. The war between the two brought in Sonny King and later Ernie Ladd to team with Junkyard Dog. After the tag matches, came brutal singles matches such as Dog Collar Matches.\n\nJust as the feud was about to reach its heated highlight, the Junkyard Dog left Mid-South and signed with the World Wrestling Federation without informing booker Bill Watts of his decision. This meant that the federation was without their biggest face and the shows had to be hastily rebooked. Watts brought in \"Master G\" (journeyman wrestler George Wells) to take JYD's place but the feud between Reed and “Master G\" never took off forcing Watts to rethink his options. When \"General\" Skandor Akbar entered the Mid-South and started to build a stable of heels, he presented Buddy Landel with a golden Rolex watch with the understanding that it wasn't actually for Landel but for someone else Akbar was trying to recruit. When Landel tried to give the watch to Reed, he became incensed, in the storyline, stomped on the watch, and started to brawl with his former partner. Akbar and his cronies came to ringside, which prompted Reed to rant on them getting the crowd behind him as he told them he didn't need back-up. When “Hacksaw\" Jim Duggan came to his rescue from a 3 on 1 attack, Reed's face status was cemented. The two Hacksaws feuded with Akbar's army of Landel, Ted Dibiase, Steve Williams, and Hercules. The two Hacksaws were successful at first, until Reed came up against Kamala. He proved to be too much for Reed, beating him all over the Mid-South territory before Reed quietly left.\n\nReed would go to the American Wrestling Association for a short stint as Jimmy Garvin's bodyguard, but would return to Mid-South in the middle of 1985 only a few short months after leaving it. In October 1985, Butch Reed beat Dick Murdoch for the North American title. Around this time, he had a famous one-hour time-limit draw with NWA Champion \"Nature Boy\" Ric Flair and feuded with Dick Slater when Slater helped Ric Flair keep the world title. In January 1986, Slater won the North American title from Butch Reed through underhanded means.\n\nAfter leaving Mid-South Wrestling once more, Reed returned to Kansas City and the \"NWA Central States\" territory run by Bob Geigel. In Kansas, Reed initially teamed with Rufus R. Jones as the Soul Patrol. Reed later turned on Jones and joined the group of manager Slick (Jones' real-life son) in 1986. After a brief feud with Jones, Reed got involved in a feud with Bruiser Brody. That summer, he lost a Loser Leaves Town match to Bruiser Brody and left the territory along with Slick.\n\nReed and Slick signed with the WWF and were brought in as a package. Reed dyed his hair blond and became \"The Natural\" Butch Reed, an updated version of Sweet Daddy Siki. He feuded initially with Tito Santana, a target of Slick's verbal jabs, and made his pay-per-view debut at WrestleMania III, where he defeated Koko B. Ware.\n\nIn the weeks after WrestleMania, Reed targeted new Intercontinental champion Ricky Steamboat and faced him at house shows and on an episode of \"Wrestling Challenge.\" According to a persistent myth, Reed no-showed a set of TV tapings where he was booked to win the title, resulting in the championship instead being put on The Honky Tonk Man. However, in a shoot interview, Reed has said this is untrue. In fact, when the Honky Tonk Man won the title from Steamboat in June 1987, Reed was shown celebrating with Honky and other heel wrestlers in the locker room although, in fairness, that was a taped segment. In a 2018 shoot interview with KayfabeCommentaries, Reed contradicted his earlier statements in past interviews and confirmed that he did lose the opportunity to become the champion because he had indeed no-showed a bunch of tapings out of burnout from never being home.\n\nIn the fall, the WWF was heavily hyping a feud between Reed and Superstar Billy Graham, a former WWF champion who was staging a comeback after hip-replacement surgery. However, Graham's condition was such that he could no longer handle the physical demands of being a wrestler, so Reed and Slick's newest acquisition, the One Man Gang, \"injured\" Graham in a sneak attack that was used to explain his permanent retirement. Graham began managing the man who came to his aid, Don Muraco, with Muraco immediately entering into a rivalry with Reed. The enemies were on opposing teams in the main event of the first Survivor Series (Muraco took Graham's place on Hulk Hogan's team); Reed (a member of André the Giant's team), was the first elimination of the match, by Hogan.\n\nReed competed in (and was the first wrestler eliminated from) the first Royal Rumble match in January 1988. Two months later, he was eliminated in the first round of the WrestleMania IV championship tournament in the first round by eventual tournament winner Randy Savage. Reed dominated most of the match against Savage, but spent too much time mouthing off to Savage's manager (and real life wife) Miss Elizabeth while climbing to the top turnbuckle. Savage caught Reed, threw him off for a slam and immediately hit his Diving elbow drop off the top turnbuckle for the win.\n\nShortly after WrestleMania IV, Reed and the WWF parted ways, Reed's manager Slick stayed with the WWF while Reed struck out on his own once more. Butch Reed resurfaced in the NWA's Jim Crockett Promotions as \"Hacksaw\" Butch Reed. He more or less immediately resumed his Mid-South feud with The Junkyard Dog. He was briefly managed by James J. Dillon before his contract was \"sold\" to Hiro Matsuda's \"Yamasaki Corporation\". Reed did not see much success in the early parts of his run with JCP; his biggest match was a loss to Sting at the Chi-Town Rumble on February 20, 1989. During the summer of 1989, Reed would flounder in the mid card as Jim Crockett Promotions grew to become a national wrestling organization.\n\nThe Steiner Brothers were involved in an angle with Woman who promised \"Doom\" for the two brothers but never specified exactly what this meant. Woman unveiled her threat at Halloween Havoc 1989, a couple of brawny, hard hitting masked African-Americans. It was obvious to most wrestling fans that Ron Simmons and Butch Reed were under the masks — they had both been on WCW. television shortly before Doom debuted, and they were the only two African-American wrestlers in the company with the same massive physical appearance — but the announcers were made to keep up the storyline (although Jim Ross accidentally exposed Reed's identity on commentary during Starrcade 89: Future Shock). Doom won their debut match against the Steiners when one of the members of Doom pinned Rick Steiner after a headbutt with an illegal object in his mask. Doom followed up on this success by defeating Eddie Gilbert and Tommy Rich at Clash of the Champions IX, looking very strong in the process.\n\nDoom's next PPV outing did not come with the same success. Along with the Steiner Brothers, The Road Warriors, and the Samoan Swat Team they were entered in a one night, tag team round robin tournament. They did not score a single point, ending dead last in the tournament. Doom's misfortune continued as Woman soon dropped the team and left the federation. Then on February 6, 1990, at Clash of the Champions X, Doom were defeated by the Steiner Brothers and as a result of the stipulation were forced to unmask.\n\nDoom beat the Steiner Brothers at Capital Combat; at that point in time, the Steiners didn't lose very often. Doom won the tag team titles and quickly set about defending them against the former champions the Steiners as well the rest of WCW's very talented tag team division. In the fall of 1990, Doom soon feuded with The Four Horsemen and defended against them in two inconclusive tag team title matches at Halloween Havoc 1990 and Starrcade 1990. At Clash of the Champions XIV, Doom lost a non-title match to Sting and Lex Luger in a match that foreshadowed the trouble that lay ahead.\n\nOn February 24, 1991 at WCW's WrestleWar PPV, Doom took on former tag team champions The Fabulous Freebirds and lost due to miscommunication between Reed and Simmons. After the Freebirds left the ring, Reed turned on Simmons and beat him up; this turned Simmons face and ended the team of Doom forever. Teddy Long sided with Butch Reed as the former Doom partners engaged in a short but intense feud. The feud culminated at SuperBrawl I where Ron Simmons pinned Butch Reed in a Steel cage match (referred to as a \"Thunder-Doom\" cage match). After the PPV, Reed left the company for a short while only to return in 1992 siding with The Barbarian and Cactus Jack. Reed and the Barbarian teamed up to defeat Dustin Rhodes and Barry Windham at Clash of the Champions XX but left WCW for good shortly afterwards.\n\nAfter leaving WCW, Reed went to the United States Wrestling Association where he once again started feuding with longtime opponent the Junkyard Dog. Reed even managed to beat JYD for the USWA Unified World Heavyweight Championship on October 12, 1992. Reed only held the title for a week before he lost it to Todd Champion. Reed left the promotion before 1992 ended.\n\nReed next appeared for a notable promotion was in 1994 when he started to wrestle for the Global Wrestling Federation during its last days of existence. Reed became the second to last GWF North American champion on June 4, 1994 when he beat Rod Price for the held up title. The title had been held up the previous day after a match between Reed and Price got out of hand and ended inconclusively. Reed held the title for almost a month before losing it to \"Gentleman\" Chris Adams, who would be the last GWF North American champion.\n\nReed continued to work on the independent scene on a part-time basis so that he could participate in the rodeo circuit in Kansas City. In 2000-2001, Butch Reed started working for Harley Race's WLW promotion. Reed beat “Luminous Warrior\" for the WLW Heavyweight Title on March 31, 2001 and held the title until Dennis McHawes beat him for it on January 25, 2002. After losing the title, Butch Reed retired from wrestling.\n\nAfter being retired for about three years, Reed returned in 2005, appearing several times for Mid States Wrestling and eventually defeating Heavyweight Champion \"Mr. Saturday Night\" Michael Barry on November 11, 2005 for the Mid States Wrestling Heavyweight title. He also participated in the “Legends of Wrestling\" tour in 2006.\n\nOn September 9, 2007, he made a cameo appearance backstage at the September 14 WWE \"SmackDown!\" taping during a segment involving his former manager and SmackDown! General Manager Theodore Long.\n\nReed's last match to date in his career was on November 4, 2011, teaming with Angel 5th, wrestling Justin Lee and Max McGuirk to a no-contest.\n\nIn July 2016, Reed was named part of a class action lawsuit filed against WWE which alleged that wrestlers incurred traumatic brain injuries during their tenure and that the company concealed the risks of injury. The suit is litigated by attorney Konstantine Kyros, who has been involved in a number of other lawsuits against WWE. In September 2018, the lawsuit was dismissed by US District Judge Vanessa Lynne Bryant.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1897333", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1897333", "title": "Criticism of Pope John Paul II", "text": "Criticism of Pope John Paul II\n\nPope John Paul II was criticised, amongst other things, for lack of any response to sex abuse of children in the Catholic Church.\n\nJohn Paul II was criticised for his support of the Opus Dei prelature and the 2002 canonisation of its founder, Josemaría Escrivá, whom he called \"‘the saint of ordinary life.’\"\n\nMore importantly, John Paul II has been criticised for hindering the investigation into the charges of sexual immorality leveled against Father Marcial Maciel Degollado. This is despite the fact that Maciel was already under investigation by the Vatican in 1956 for drug addiction when he established the Legionaries in Ireland. At the time the Vatican had removed him as superior of the Legionaries and was investigating allegations that he abused morphine.\n\nAllegations about Maciel began resurfacing in the 1980s but were consistently ignored by the Vatican hierarchy, which approved bylaws for the group that effectively banned internal criticism of Maciel and allowed a personality cult to flourish around him. He was eventually found to have molested many seminarians and abused children he had fathered with different women despite his vows of chastity. Campaigners accuse John Paul II more generally of putting the interests of the Catholic Church above all and turning a blind eye to child sex abuse allegations.\n\nJohn Paul II's defense of teachings of the Catholic Church regarding gender roles, sexuality, euthanasia, artificial contraception and abortion came under criticism. Some Christian feminists challenged views of his on the role of women in society, including the ordination of women. However, John Paul was being consistent with Catholic teaching.\n\nIn addition to all the criticism from those demanding modernisation, traditionalist Catholics sometimes denounced him as well. These issues included demanding a return to the Tridentine Mass and repudiation of the reforms instituted after the Second Vatican Council, such as the use of the vernacular language in the formerly Latin Roman Rite Mass, ecumenism, and the principle of religious liberty. He was also accused by these critics for allowing and appointing liberal bishops in their sees and thus silently promoting Modernism, which was firmly condemned as the \"\"synthesis of all heresies\"\" by his predecessor Pope Pius X. In 1988, the controversial traditionalist Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre, founder of the Society of St. Pius X (1970), was excommunicated under John Paul II because of the unapproved ordination of four bishops, which was called by the Holy See a \"schismatic act\".\n\nThe World Day of Prayer for Peace, with a meeting in Assisi, Italy, in 1986, in which the Pope prayed only with the Christians,\nwas heavily criticised as giving the impression that syncretism and indifferentism were openly embraced by the Papal Magisterium. When a second ‘Day of Prayer for Peace in the World’ was held, in 2002, it was condemned as confusing the laity and compromising to \"\"false religions\"\". Likewise criticised were his kissing of the Qur'an in Damascus, Syria, on one of his travels on 6 May 2001. His call for religious freedom was not always supported; bishops like Antônio de Castro Mayer promoted religious tolerance, but at the same time rejected the Vatican II principle of religious liberty as being liberalist and already condemned by Pope Pius IX in his \"‘Syllabus errorum’\" (1864) and at the First Vatican Council.\n\nSome Catholics opposed his beatification and canonization for the above reasons.\n\nJohn Paul's position against artificial birth control, including the use of condoms to prevent the spread of HIV, was harshly criticised by doctors and AIDS activists, who said that it led to countless deaths and millions of AIDS orphans. However, some experts have questioned the efficacy of condom distribution. Edward C. Green, director of the AIDS Prevention Research Project at the Harvard Center for Population and Development Studies: \"We have found no consistent associations between condom use and lower HIV-infection rates, which, 25 years into the pandemic, we should be seeing if this intervention was working. James Shelton, of the US Agency for International Development, said that one of the ten damaging myths about the fight against AIDS is that condoms are the answer. \"Condoms alone have limited impact in generalised epidemics [as in Africa],\" Shelton wrote. Critics have also claimed that large families are caused by lack of contraception and exacerbate Third World poverty and problems such as street children in South America. The Catholic Agency for Overseas Development published a paper stating, \"Any strategy that enables a person to move from a higher-risk towards the lower end of the continuum, [we] believe, is a valid risk reduction strategy.\"\n\nJohn Paul II was also criticised for failing to respond appropriately to the sex abuse crisis. In his response, he stated that \"there is no place in the priesthood and religious life for those who would harm the young\". The Church instituted reforms to prevent future abuse by requiring background checks for Church employees and, because a significant majority of victims were teenage boys, disallowing ordination of men with \"deep–seated homosexual tendencies\". They now require dioceses faced with an allegation to alert the authorities, conduct an investigation and remove the accused from duty. In 2008, the Church asserted that the scandal was a very serious problem and estimated that it was \"probably caused by 'no more than 1 percent'\" (or 5,000) of the over 500,000 Catholic priests worldwide.\n\nIn addition to cases of abuse, much of the scandal has focused around members of the Catholic hierarchy who did not report abuse allegations to the civil authorities. In many cases they reassigned those accused to other locations where they continued to have contact with minors. In defending their actions, some bishops and psychiatrists contended that the prevailing psychology of the times suggested that people could be cured of such behavior through counseling. Members of the church hierarchy have argued that media coverage has been excessive.\nIn response to the widening scandal, Pope John Paul II emphasised the spiritual nature of the offenses. He declared in 2001 that \"a sin against the Sixth Commandment of the Decalogue by a cleric with a minor under 18 years of age is to be considered a grave sin, or \"delictum gravius\".\" With the approval of the Vatican, the hierarchy of the church in the United States said that it instituted reforms to prevent future abuse including requiring background checks for Church employees and volunteers, while opposing extensions of the statutes of limitations in sex abuse cases.\n\nHe was criticised for recentralising power back to the Vatican following what some viewed as a decentralisation by Pope John XXIII. As such he was regarded by some as a strict authoritarian. Conversely, he was also criticised for spending far too much time preparing for and undertaking foreign travel. The frequency of his trips, it was said, not only undermined the \"specialness\" of papal visits, but took him away from important business at the Vatican and allowed the Church, administratively speaking, to drift. Especially in South America, he was criticised for conservative bias in his appointments of bishops; with an unusually long reign of over 25 years, the majority of bishops in place at his death had been appointed by him.\n\nSome Catholic theologians disagreed with the call for beatification of Pope John Paul II. Eleven dissident theologians, including Jesuit professor Jose Maria Castillo and Italian theologian Giovanni Franzoni raised seven points, including his stance against contraception and the ordination of women as well as the Church scandals that presented \"facts which according to their consciences and convictions should be an obstacle to beatification\".\n\n"}
{"id": "1897341", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1897341", "title": "The Pianist (2002 film)", "text": "The Pianist (2002 film)\n\nThe Pianist is a 2002 biographical war drama film produced and directed by Roman Polanski, with a script by Ronald Harwood, and starring Adrien Brody. It is based on the autobiographical book \"The Pianist\" (1946), a Holocaust memoir by the Polish-Jewish pianist and composer Władysław Szpilman, a Holocaust survivor. The film was a co-production of France, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Poland.\n\n\"The Pianist\" met with significant critical praise, and received multiple awards and nominations. It was awarded the Palme d'Or at the 2002 Cannes Film Festival. At the 75th Academy Awards, the film won for Best Director (Polanski), Best Adapted Screenplay (Harwood), and Best Actor (Brody), and was nominated for four others, including the Best Picture. It also won the BAFTA Award for Best Film and BAFTA Award for Best Direction in 2003, and seven French Césars, including Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Actor for Brody. It was included in BBC's 100 Greatest Films of the 21st Century in 2016.\n\nIn September 1939, Władysław Szpilman, a Polish-Jewish pianist, is playing live on the radio in Warsaw when the station is bombed during Nazi Germany's invasion of Poland. Hoping for a quick victory, Szpilman rejoices with his family at home when learning that Britain and France have declared war on Germany. But the promised aid does not come. Fighting lasts for just over a month, with both the German and Soviet armies invading Poland at the same time on different fronts. Warsaw becomes part of the Nazi-controlled General Government. Jews are soon prevented from working or owning businesses, and are also made to wear blue Star of David armbands.\n\nBy November 1940, Szpilman and his family are forced from their home into the isolated and overcrowded Warsaw Ghetto, where conditions only get worse. People starve, the SS guards are brutal, starving children are abandoned and there are dead bodies everywhere. On one occasion, the Szpilmans witness the SS kill an entire family in an apartment across the street during a round-up, including dumping a wheelchair-bound man out a window.\n\nOn 16 August 1942, Szpilman and his family are transported to Treblinka extermination camp as part of Operation Reinhard. But a friend in the Jewish Ghetto Police recognizes Władysław at the \"Umschlagplatz\", and separates him from his family. He becomes a slave labourer, and learns of a coming Jewish revolt. He helps the resistance by smuggling weapons into the ghetto, on one occasion narrowly avoiding a suspicious guard. Szpilman eventually manages to escape, and goes into hiding with help from a non-Jewish friend, Andrzej Bogucki, and his wife, Janina.\n\nIn April 1943, Szpilman watches from his window as the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, which he aided, unfolds, and then ultimately fails. After a neighbor discovers Szpilman in the flat, he is forced to flee to a second hiding place. The new room has a piano in it, but he is compelled to keep quiet, while beginning to suffer from jaundice.\n\nIn August 1944, during the Warsaw Uprising, the Armia Krajowa attacks a German building across the street from Szpilman's hideout. Tank shells hit the apartment, forcing him to flee. Over the course of the following months, Warsaw is destroyed. Szpilman is left alone to search desperately for shelter and supplies among the ruins. He eventually makes his way to a house where he finds a can of pickled cucumbers. While trying to open it, he is noticed by \"Wehrmacht\" officer Wilm Hosenfeld, who learns that Szpilman is a pianist. He asks Szpilman to play on a grand piano in the house. The decrepit Szpilman manages to play Chopin's \"Ballade in G minor\". Hosenfeld lets Szpilman hide in the attic of the empty house. From here, he is regularly supplied with food by the German officer.\n\nIn January 1945, the Germans are retreating from the Red Army. Hosenfeld meets Szpilman for the last time, promising he will listen to him on Polish Radio after the war. He gives Szpilman his greatcoat to keep warm, and leaves. In Spring 1945, former inmates of a Nazi concentration camp pass by a Soviet prisoner-of-war camp holding captured German soldiers and verbally abuse them. Hosenfeld, being one of the prisoners, overhears a released inmate lamenting over his former career as a violinist. He asks him whether he knows Szpilman, which he confirms, and Hosenfeld wishes him to beg Szpilman, to return him favour and help release him. Later the violinist and Szpilman reach the prisoners camp, but find it abandoned.\n\nAfter the war, Szpilman is back at the Polish Radio, where he performs Chopin's \"Grand Polonaise brillante\" to a large prestigious audience. An epilogue states that Szpilman died in 2000 at the age of 88, whereas Hosenfeld died in 1952, still in Soviet captivity.\n\n\nThe story had deep connections with director Roman Polanski because he escaped from the Kraków Ghetto as a child after the death of his mother. He ended up living in a Polish farmer's barn until the war's end. His father almost died in the camps, but they reunited after the end of World War II.\n\nJoseph Fiennes was Polanski's first choice for the lead role, but he turned it down due to a previous commitment to a theatrical role. Over 1,400 actors auditioned for the role of Szpilman at a casting call in London. Unsatisfied with all who tried, Polanski sought to cast Adrien Brody, whom he saw as ideal for the role during their first meeting in Paris.\n\nPrincipal photography on \"The Pianist\" began on 9 February 2001 in Babelsberg Studio in Potsdam, Germany. The Warsaw Ghetto and the surrounding city were recreated on the backlot of Babelsberg Studio as they would have looked during the war. Old Soviet Army barracks were used to create the ruined city, as they were going to be destroyed anyway.\n\nThe first scenes of the film were shot at the old army barracks. Soon after, the film crew moved to a villa in Potsdam, which served as the house where Szpilman meets Hosenfeld. On 2 March 2001, filming then moved to an abandoned Soviet military hospital in Beelitz, Germany. The scenes that featured German soldiers destroying a Warsaw hospital with flamethrowers were filmed here. On 15 March, filming finally moved to Babelsberg Studios. The first scene shot at the studio was the complex and technically demanding scene in which Szpilman witnesses the ghetto uprising.\n\nFilming at the studios ended on 26 March, and moved to Warsaw on 29 March. The rundown district of Praga was chosen for filming because of its abundance of original buildings. The art department built onto these original buildings, re-creating World War II–era Poland with signs and posters from the period. Additional filming also took place around Warsaw. The Umschlagplatz scene where Szpilman, his family, and hundreds of other Jews wait to be taken to the extermination camps was filmed at the National Defence University of Warsaw.\n\nPrincipal photography ended in July 2001, and was followed by months of post-production in Paris.\n\n\"The Pianist\" was widely acclaimed by critics, with Brody's performance, Harwood's screenplay, and Polanski's direction receiving special praise. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 95% based on 181 reviews, with an average rating of 8.2/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Well-acted and dramatically moving, \"The Pianist\" is Polanski's best work in years.\" On Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating to reviews, the film has a weighted average score of 85 out of 100, based on 40 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".\n\nRoger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" gave a positive review of the film, noting that, \"perhaps that impassive quality reflects what [director Roman] Polanski wants to say. ... By showing Szpilman as a survivor, but not a fighter or a hero—as a man who does all he can to save himself, but would have died without enormous good luck and the kindness of a few non-Jews—Polanski is reflecting ... his own deepest feelings: that he survived, but need not have, and that his mother died and left a wound that had never healed.\" Michael Wilmington of the \"Chicago Tribune\" said that the film \"is the best dramatic feature I've seen on the Holocaust experience, so powerful a statement on war, inhumanity, and art's redemption that it may signal Polanski's artistic redemption\". He would later go on to say that the film \"illustrates that theme and proves that Polanski's own art has survived the chaos of his life—and the hell that war and bigotry once made of it\". Richard Schickel of \"Time\" magazine called it a \"raw, unblinkable film\", and said that, \"We admire this film for its harsh objectivity and refusal to seek our tears, our sympathies.\" Mick LaSalle of the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" said that the film \"contains moments of irony, of ambiguity, and of strange beauty, as when we finally get a look at Warsaw and see a panorama of destruction, a world of color bombed into black-and-white devastation\". He also said that, \"In the course of showing us a struggle for survival, in all its animal simplicity, Polanski also gives us humanity, in all its complexity.\" A.O. Scott of \"The New York Times\" said that Szpilman \"comes to resemble one of Samuel Beckett's gaunt existential clowns, shambling through a barren, bombed-out landscape clutching a jar of pickles. He is like the walking punchline to a cosmic jest of unfathomable cruelty.\" He also felt that \"Szpilman's encounter, in the war's last days, with a music-loving German officer, \"courted sentimentality by associating the love of art with moral decency, an equation the Nazis themselves, steeped in Beethoven and Wagner, definitively refuted\".\n\n\"The Pianist\" was released digitally on 27 May 2003 in a double-sided disc Special Edition DVD, with the film on one side and special features on the other. Some Bonus Material included a making-of, interviews with Brody, Polanski, and Harwood, and clips of Szpilman playing the piano. The Polish DVD edition included an audio commentary track by production designer Starski and director of photography Edelman.\n\nUniversal Studios Home Entertainment released the film on HD-DVD on 8 January 2008 with extras comprising the featurette \"A Story of Survival\" and rare footage of the real Władysław Szpilman playing his piano, as well as additional interviews with Adrien Brody and other crew.\n\nOptimum Home Entertainment released \"The Pianist\" to the European market on Blu-ray as part of their \"StudioCanal Collection\" on 13 September 2010, the film's second release on Blu-ray. The first was troublesome due to issues with subtitles; the initial BD lacked subtitles for spoken German dialogue. Optimum later rectified this, but the initial release also lacked notable special features. The \"StudioCanal Collection\" version includes an extensive Behind the Scenes look, as well as several interviews with the makers of the film and Szpilman's relatives.\n\n\n\n"}

He used his political passion to begin his career after the Islamic revolution in 1979 by writing articles in the left political newspapers.\n\nIn the 1980s, he wrote two novels which were published illegally because of the political constraints: \"What are the Kurds saying?\" and \"Kurdistan after the resistance party\".\n\nWhen he immigrated to the Netherlands, he felt as if political issues were no longer relevant to his life and he fell into a state of depression because he had thought of political activities as the essence of his life. Learning Dutch and to write in the language is therefore described by him as a political tool for fighting. Literature had turned into the incentive for a new fight.\n\nKader Abdolah studied physics in Arak College of Science (today's Arak university) in Arak, Iran and graduated in 1977. After graduation he served his mandatory military service at Iranian Navy in Bandar Pahlavi (today's Bandar-e-Anzali) During the revolution he joined the left-wing movement opposing the Shah – and later the Khomeini – regimes. He fled to the Netherlands as a political refugee in 1988. In 2006 he was writer in residence at Leiden University. Today he lives in Delft, writing under a pseudonym composed of the names of two executed friends.\n\n\"Het huis van de moskee\" (\"The House of the Mosque\") catapulted Abdolah onto the Dutch bestseller lists. In 2007. it was voted second best Dutch novel ever in the Netherlands in an online survey organized by NRC Handelsblad and NPS. The English translation was released worldwide in January 2010.\n\n\n\n"}

Mason settled a large tract of land along the Cache la Poudre River in present-day north Fort Collins, and he played in an instrumental role in persuading the United States Army to found Camp Collins along the river adjacent to his property in 1864. After Colorado became a territory in 1861, Mason was appointed to the first board of county commissioners. He became prominent in politics and business in Fort Collins after the founding of the town in 1867, and served in several official posts, including becoming Sheriff of Larimer County in 1871.\n\nJoseph Mason was born Joseph Messier on a farm near Montreal, Canada, January 28, 1840. He was the youngest child in a family of 10 He attended school in both Montreal and Sherbrooke before immigrating to the United States at the age of 15. After moving to the New England region of the United States, he Americanized his name to Mason .\n\nAfter spending a year in Mississippi, in early 1859, Mason travelled to St. Louis, Missouri and joined the Raynolds Expedition which was traveling west to explore the headwaters of the Yellowstone River, but Mason left the expedition, before it was complete, in the winter of 1859-1860 while they were wintering over in Deer Creek Station in central Wyoming. From there, Mason traveled south to Laporte, Colorado, arriving on February 10, 1860, where he found a settlement of mountaineers, trappers, and Native Americans. Mason briefly left Laporte to spend time in the mining camps, but returned to the area to settle 4 miles downstream from the town in 1862. \n\nUpon returning to the Cache la Poudre valley, Mason purchased a 160 acre tract of land from a Native American woman who was the recent widow of a man named Gangros. The land was located on the south side of the river a little over a mile northwest of present-day Fort Collins. In 1862, the governor of the Colorado Territory, John Evans, appointed Mason to the first board of county commissioners.\n\nIn June of 1864, a flood destroyed the nearby Army camp called Camp Collins. When Lt. James Hannah and his men were looking for safer ground on which to relocate the camp, they encountered Mason, who suggested they relocate on land near his property. He suggested that this ground would be high enough to be safe from flooding and would allow a good vantage point for spotting impending attacks from hostile Native American groups in the area.\n\nOnce the camp was moved to its new location, Mason and Major Asaph Allen built the first store, called Old Grout, in 1865. It was a two-story concrete sutler’s store built on the south edge of the camp, and Mason was appointed as the sutler, or store keeper for the camp. Mason and his partner, Mr. Sherwood, also supplied horses to the army camp. When the post office was located in the sutler's store, Mason was also appointed as the first postmaster to the camp. In 1877, President Hayes reappointed Mason as \npostmaster but Mason resigned the office in 1879. \n\nIn 1868, Mason was instrumental in getting the county seat of Larimer County to Fort Collins from Laporte. Once the county seat was moved to Fort Collins, the courthouse was located on the second floor of the Old Grout sutler's store building.\n\nIn 1871, Mason was elected Sheriff of Larimer County. He was reelected to the position in 1873. During his time as sheriff, Mason arrested noted criminal Happy Jack, but he subsequently escaped custody.\n\nIn 1872, Mason purchased the Lindell flour mill from Elizabeth Auntie Stone and Henry C. Peterson.\n\nJoseph Mason donated 50 acres of land to help build Colorado State University.\n\nMason Street in Fort Collins is named for Joseph Mason.\n\nIn 1861 in Denver, Mason took part in a duel with a Frenchman over a Native American woman. The Frenchman fainted before either party could draw their weapon, so no shots were fired. It is not known what became of the woman, but she did not end up with Mason. The woman's name was Mary Polzell\n\nMason married Luella M. Blake, the daughter of George G. Blake on July 3rd, 1870. The couple had two children who survived to adulthood, Minnie Luella Mason and Albert J. Mason, and one child, Lizzie C. Mason, that died in early infancy.\n\nOn February 9, 1881, Mason was kicked in the head by one of his horses. Local doctors removed 62 pieces of skull fragment from the wound, but could not save him. On February 11, 1881, Mason died of his wounds. He is buried in Grand View Cemetery in Fort Collins.\n\nJoseph Mason is the subject of the Country music song \"I Remember Joe\" written and performed by Nanci Griffith.\n"}

{"id": "1897417", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1897417", "title": "Photochrom", "text": "Photochrom\n\nPhotochrom (Fotochrom, Photochrome or the Aäc process) is a process for producing colorized images from black-and-white photographic negatives via the direct photographic transfer of a negative onto lithographic printing plates. The process is a photographic variant of chromolithography (color lithography).\n\nThe process was invented in the 1880s by Hans Jakob Schmid (1856–1924), an employee of the Swiss company Orell Gessner Füssli—a printing firm whose history began in the 16th century. Füssli founded the stock company Photochrom Zürich (later Photoglob Zürich AG) as the business vehicle for the commercial exploitation of the process and both Füssli and Photoglob continue to exist today. From the mid-1890s the process was licensed by other companies, including the Detroit Photographic Company in the US (making it the basis of their \"phostint\" process), and the Photochrom Company of London.\n\nAmongst the first commercial photographers to employ the technique were French photographer Félix Bonfils, British photographer Francis Frith and American photographer William Henry Jackson, all active in the 1880s. The photochrom process was most popular in the 1890s, when true color photography was first developed but was still commercially impractical.\n\nIn 1898 the US Congress passed the Private Mailing Card Act which let private publishers produce postcards. These could be mailed for one cent each, while the letter rate was two cents. Publishers created thousands of photochrom prints, usually of cities or landscapes, and sold them as postcards. In this format, photochrom reproductions became popular. The Detroit Photographic Company reportedly produced as many as seven million photochrom prints in some years, and ten to thirty thousand different views were offered.\n\nAfter World War I, which ended the craze for collecting photochrom postcards, the chief use of the process was for posters and art reproductions. The last photochrom printer operated up to 1970.\n\nA tablet of lithographic limestone called a \"litho stone\" was coated with a light-sensitive surface composed of a thin layer of purified bitumen dissolved in benzene. A reversed halftone negative was then pressed against the coating and exposed to daylight (ten to thirty minutes in summer, up to several hours in winter), causing the bitumen to harden in proportion to the amount of light passing through each portion of the negative. Then a solvent such as turpentine was applied to remove the unhardened bitumen and retouch the tonal scale, strengthening or softening tones as required. Thus the image became imprinted on the stone in bitumen. Each tint was applied using a separate stone that bore the appropriate retouched image. The finished print was produced using at least six, but more commonly ten to fifteen, tint stones.\n\n"}

He became known for pioneer works in various fields in geography, notably urban development in developing countries. He is considered the father of Critical Geography in Brazil.\n\nSantos was born in Brotas de Macaúbas, Bahia, Brazil on May 3, 1926. Santos' parents were elementary school teachers and taught him at home how to read and write. By the time he was eight, he had already completed the equivalent of an elementary school education. Milton's father was a descendant from slaves, which gave Santos motivation to study. From 1934 to 1936, he lived in Alcobaça, learning French and good manners.\n\nSantos taught geography to high school students to finance university classes in Salvador. He graduated majoring in law yet he did not practice it. He instead took and passed a public examination for secondary teacher and went to teach geography in Ilhéus.\n\nSantos went on to study and teach in Europe, America, and Africa. Although he is considered exiled by the military government, he was actually forbidden to leave the country and could only do so after a negotiation between the French ambassador and the government. He turned the painful exile that the military dictatorship had imposed on him for thirteen years into benefits. Milton Santos wrote more than forty books in several languages. His works became a reference for all those who intended to understand the world in a critical way, that is to say, not in a negative way necessarily, but applying concepts of Critical Geography and the Frankfurt School.\n\nSome of his works include \"Por Uma Geografia Nova\" (1978) and \"A Natureza do Espaço\" (1996). His work \"O Espaço Dividido\", in which Santos develops a theory on urban development in underdeveloped countries, is considered a geography classic.\n\nMilton Santos went on to win the Vautrin Lud International Geography Prize - the highest award that can be gained in the field of geography. The award is modeled after the Nobel Prize and is considered and colloquially called the Nobel Prize for geography.\n\nMilton Santos died in São Paulo, on June 24, 2001, at age 75, as a result of prostate cancer diagnosed about seven years earlier.\n\nOn 1 October 2018, search engine Google celebrated Milton Santos with a Doodle.\n\n\n"}

It was the world's first packaged, branded laundry soap. Designed for washing clothes and general household use, the success of the product led to the name for the company's village for its workers, Port Sunlight. The soap formula was invented by a Bolton chemist named William Hough Watson, who also became an early business partner. Watson's process created a new soap, using glycerin and vegetable oils such as palm oil rather than tallow (animal fats). William Lever and his brother James Darcy Lever invested in Watson's soap invention and its initial success came from offering bars of cut, wrapped, and branded soap in his father's grocery shop. This was an early labour-saving device for the housewife as prior to this, commercially made soap was bought in long bars. Sunlight soap was eventually supplanted by modern products made from synthetically produced detergents rather than naturally derived soaps.\n\nIn 1971, the company rebranded Sunlight as a washing-up liquid in the UK. The new packaging for Sunlight Lemon Liquid had a large picture of a lemon, and only featured the words \"washing up liquid\" in small letters. There were complaints that children might mistake the product for lemon squash and drink it. The matter was discussed in the House of Lords. The company responded by changing its packaging.\n\nIn several markets (e.g., Belgium and the Netherlands) Sunlight soap has survived as a personal wash product rather than a laundry detergent.\n\nSunlight is still used in some markets as a brand by Unilever (the successor of Lever Brothers). In Sri Lanka, Sunlight laundry soap has a market share of more than 75%, and won the “brand of the year” award in 2004. In South Africa, the brand is used for bath soap, dishwashing liquid, washing powder and fabric conditioner.\n\nThe brand was also used in the Philippines during the 1990s as detergents. It was discontinued until it was revived in 2015 as a liquid dish-washing detergent traded alongside the Surf line.\n\nHowever, production for Ireland and the UK ceased in 2009 due to low demand; it is available only as an import. In Norway it was taken over by Lilleborg in 1930.\n\nIn 2003, exclusive licensing rights to the Sunlight brand for dishwashing detergents in the United States, Canada, Puerto Rico were sold along with several Unilever brands to Lehman Brothers Merchant Banking Group, which established Phoenix Brands LLC for the purpose. In 2008, the North American trademark rights to Unilever laundry brands including Sunlight were acquired by Sun Products Corporation. In early 2010, Sun Products acquired the American and Canadian business rights to the Sunlight brand. Sun Products was itself acquired by Henkel North American Consumer Goods in 2016.\n\nThe Sunlight brand was used by JohnsonDiversey Professional Products in Canada and the USA in 2011.\n\nIn Australia, it is a brand of Symex, who manufacture, distribute and export Sunlight bar soap and Sunlight dishwashing liquid.\n\nIn Turkey in the summer of 2010, washing-up liquids produced under the brand Cif began marketing with the new compound brand \"Sunlight Cif\". As well as the regular liquid, a concentrated washing-up liquid was introduced in three varieties (lime, lemon and orange); when it comes into contact with water, it turns into a gel which remains in the sponge longer than regular washing-up liquid.\n\n\n"}

These were the first incarnations of the \"Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\" franchise. Both were written by Douglas Adams and consist of six episodes each.\n\nThe series followed the aimless wanderings of Arthur Dent, Ford Prefect and his book, the eponymous \"Guide\". It introduced unfamiliar music, mind stretching concepts and the newest science mixed together with out of context parodies, unfeasibly rude names, \"semantic and philosophical jokes\", compressed prose and \"groundbreaking deployment of sound effects and voice techniques\". By the time the sixth episode was broadcast, the show had become a cult. A Christmas special would follow, many repeats and a second series. The two original series were followed by three more in 2004 and 2005.\n\nThe following article is a list of episodes from the Primary and Secondary Phases. For information on its production, see \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\".\n\nThe first radio series was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in March and April 1978. It was split into episodes, known as \"Fits\" (an archaic term for a section of a poem revived by Lewis Carroll for \"The Hunting of the Snark\"). The original series comprised Fit the First to Fit the Sixth. Fits the Fifth and Sixth were co-written by John Lloyd; subsequent versions of the story omit most of Lloyd's material.\n\nThe success of the series encouraged Adams to adapt it into a novel, which was based on the first four Fits and released in the second week of October 1979. A slightly contracted double LP re-recording of the first four Fits was released in the same year, followed by a single LP featuring a revised version of Fits the Fifth and Sixth and the second book, both in 1980.\n\nCast\n\nAs the episode opens Arthur Dent is attempting to prevent the local council, represented by Mr Prosser, from bulldozing his house to make way for a bypass. Dent's friend, Ford Prefect arrives and takes him to the pub. At the pub, Ford explains that he is not from Guildford after all, but from a small planet somewhere in the vicinity of Betelgeuse, and that the world is about to end.\n\nMeanwhile, Lady Cynthia Fitzmelton, a character unique to the radio series, has arrived at the site of Arthur Dent's house. She makes a speech about progress, and the future for the village of Cottington, and insults the residents in the process. She begins the construction of the bypass, and the demolition of Arthur Dent's house, by smashing a bottle of \"very splendid and worthwhile\" champagne against a yellow bulldozer. Ford and Arthur hear this, and Arthur races back to the former site of his house, Ford chasing after him after first buying some peanuts.\n\nShortly after Arthur and Ford return to the ruins of Arthur's house, a fleet of Vogon Constructor Ships arrives in the sky, and Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz broadcasts an announcement that they are to demolish the Earth to make way for a hyperspace bypass. Panic ensues. Ford uses his \"electronic thumb\" to hitch a lift onto one of the ships, taking Arthur with him, just moments before the Earth is destroyed.\n\nOn board the Vogon Constructor Ship, Ford explains that he was a field researcher for the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, and had been stuck on the Earth for several more years than he originally expected. The two are soon captured by the Vogons, who take an unfriendly view of hitchhikers.\n\nThe episode ends on a cliffhanger, after the Vogon Captain tortures them by reading them some poetry, with them due to be thrown into space afterwards.\n\nMusic: \n\"Journey of the Sorcerer\" from \"One of These Nights\" by The Eagles; \"Lontano\" by György Ligeti; \"A Rainbow in Curved Air\" by Terry Riley; \"Volumina\" by György Ligeti.\n\nCast\n\nAfter the initial narration, the episode opens with a recap of the cliffhanger with the Vogon captain demanding what Ford and Arthur thought of his poem. They attempt to flatter him to avoid execution, but he decides to throw them off the ship anyway. Whilst being escorted to the airlock, Ford attempts to persuade the Vogon guard to give up his job, but fails.\n\nThe pair are thrown into space. Improbably, they are rescued after 29 seconds, by a starship. After some more improbable events they discover they have been picked up by the Starship \"Heart of Gold\", which has been stolen by Ford's semi-cousin, and President of the Galaxy, Zaphod Beeblebrox. The \"Heart of Gold\" works on a basis of infinite improbability, allowing its drive to do anything for which the improbability factor is known.\n\nAlso on the \"Heart of Gold\" are Trillian (Tricia McMillan), whom Arthur met at a party in Islington, before she left the party (and the planet) to go with Zaphod Beeblebrox, and Marvin, a depressed android. The episode ends with a post-credit announcement from Eddie the Shipboard Computer that the ship is moving into orbit around the legendary planet of Magrathea.\n\nNotes: First appearance of Marvin the Paranoid Android, Trillian, Eddie the computer, Gag Halfrunt, and Zaphod Beeblebrox.\n\nMusic: \"Wind on Water\" from \"Evening Star\" by Fripp and Eno; \"A Rainbow in Curved Air\" by Terry Riley; \"Poppy Nogood and the Phantom Band\" by Terry Riley; \"Cachuaca\" by Patrick Moraz.\n\nCast\n\nThe episode begins with a narration describing the significance of Magrathea, a planet that long long ago manufactured custom-designed planets for rich businessmen. Due to its immense success, Magrathea became the richest planet in the galaxy and the galactic economy collapsed. Ford and Zaphod argue about the accuracy of this legend, Ford believing that it is nonsense, Zaphod believing he has found the long-lost planet.\n\nAs the ship orbits the planet, it triggers an automated recorded message, from the Commercial Council of Magrathea, that notes that Magrathea is currently closed for business, and to leave. A follow-up message announces that nuclear missiles will be launched against the ship.\n\nThe missiles are detected, and the crew struggle to get the \"Heart of Gold\" to escape the missiles. Disaster is averted when Arthur activates the Infinite Improbability Drive and the missiles are turned into a bowl of petunias and a very surprised-looking sperm whale. Trillian notes that her white mice (that she had taken with her from the Earth) have escaped.\n\nThe ship lands, and Ford, Arthur, Zaphod, Trillian and Marvin go onto the surface. \"(The episode, as released on CD, is edited here to avoid possible musical copyright concerns. )\" They split up, and Zaphod, Trillian and Ford explore a tunnel, noting that they seem to be following the mice, whilst Arthur and Marvin are left on the surface as lookout. Eventually, Slartibartfast comes to meet Arthur, and takes him into the interior of the planet, leaving Marvin behind. Inside Magrathea, he shows Arthur a planet that they are working on at the moment. Arthur recognises it as the Earth. Slartibartfast explains that the original Earth had been destroyed five minutes too early, and they are constructing a replacement. The original Earth had apparently been commissioned by some mice in order to find the \"Ultimate Question\".\n\nNotes: First appearance of Slartibartfast.

He plays Arthur some recordings explaining the historical events. This race of pan-dimensional beings had constructed a great computer, called Deep Thought, to answer the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe and Everything. It did, after seven and a half million years, have the answer to the Ultimate Question, a rather disappointing 42. Deep Thought explains that this is only disappointing because they never really understood what the Question was. They ask the computer if he can find out what the Ultimate Question is. Deep Thought cannot, but promises to design a computer that can, and names it, \"Earth\".\n\nSlartibartfast explains that this computer was built by the Magratheans, and that the Vogons came and destroyed it five minutes before it was due to complete its run. The mice summon Arthur and Slartibartfast to a meeting room, where they have discussed a proposal with Zaphod, Ford and Trillian. The mice believe that as last-generation products of the computer matrix, Arthur and Trillian should be in an ideal position to find out the Question, and offer to make them \"extremely rich\" if they can do so. (In later versions this would be replaced with the mice wishing to extract Arthur's brain). The negotiations are interrupted by the arrival of a Galactic Police ship, pursuing Zaphod for his theft of the \"Heart of Gold\".\n\nThe Police confront Arthur, Ford, Trillian and Zaphod, and shoot at them, whilst explaining that they find violence upsetting. After a particularly long volley of fire, the computer bank they are hiding behind explodes, and the episode ends.\n\nMusic: \"A Rainbow in Curved Air\" by Terry Riley; \"Moon City\" from \"In Search of Ancient Gods\" by Absolute Elsewhere; \"Mikrophonie I\" by Stockhausen.\n\nCast\n\nThe episode begins where previous episode ended, with the computer bank exploding. Arthur, Ford, Trillian and Zaphod wake up in a strange place, and assume it must be the afterlife. It becomes apparent however that in fact it is Milliways, the Restaurant at the End of the Universe, which is located in the far future at the moment that the universe ends. They dine, but are interrupted by a telephone call from Marvin. A waiter explains that the Restaurant was in fact constructed in the ruins of Magrathea. Meanwhile, Marvin has been waiting on the surface of the planet. After he whines somewhat, the four go down to the car park (where Marvin has been parking cars), and meet up with Marvin. Ford and Zaphod are transfixed by the spaceships in the carpark, and discover a totally black, totally frictionless ship. Stuck without the \"Heart of Gold\", they decide to steal it, with Marvin's help.\n\nWhen on the ship, they discover that it is out of control, and since the interior is also totally black none of the controls are legible. They debate what the Question is, and Marvin reveals that he can read it in Arthur's brainwave patterns. Before he can reveal what it is, they are interrupted by the control panels lighting up suddenly and the ship coming out of hyperspace. They realise they are outside of the galaxy, and part of an intergalactic battle fleet.\n\nMusic: \"Melodien by György Ligeti; \"The Engulfed Cathedral\" from \"Snowflakes are Dancing\" by Isao Tomita; \"A Rainbow in Curved Air\" by Terry Riley; \"Wind on Water\" from \"Evening Star\" by Fripp and Eno.\n\nCast\n\nThe episode opens with the main characters on the black ship. Soon, they receive a transmission from the second-in-command of the battle fleet, who makes a report to Zaphod, believing him to be the Admiral. This is considered confusing as Zaphod was just presumed to be the Admiral, despite bearing no resemblance to the second-in-command, who looked like a leopard.\n\nShortly afterward, they receive another transmission, this time with Trillian in the chair. The second-in-command, who now looks like a shoebox, assumes that Trillian is the Admiral.\n\nThey look up the name \"Haggunenon\", spoken by the second-in-command, in the Guide, and discover that they are a race of xenophobic shape-shifters. They realise that the Admiral is in fact on the ship, but had shapeshifted. It becomes a \"carbon copy\" of the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal. The group split up, Arthur and Ford taking one escape capsule and Zaphod and Trillian attempting to take another.\n\nArthur notices that the other escape capsule isn't escaping, and presses a button in his escape capsule that ends up teleporting him and Ford to a strange spaceship. Meanwhile, Zaphod, Trillian and Marvin are all eaten by the copy of the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal, with Marvin's leg coming off in the process, and Zaphod's second head is revealed to know French (via an ad-lib by Mark Wing-Davey). This is the last appearance of the character of Trillian until the Tertiary Phase.\n\nThe spaceship to which Ford and Arthur have teleported, marked as \"Golgafrincham Ark Fleet, Ship B\" is filled with bodies, such as frozen telephone sanitisers, hairdressers, and advertising account executives. Whilst inspecting the bodies, they are captured by Number Two, the third-in-command of the ship, who takes them to the bridge.\n\nHere, they meet the Captain (who is taking a bath in a large bathtub in the bridge, and has been for several years). He reluctantly grants permission to Number Two to interrogate Arthur and Ford, and asks him to find out what they want to drink.\n\nConversing with the Captain, they discover that the bodies are not, as they believed, dead, but frozen. They are intending to colonise another planet, because their original planet was \"doomed\". The \"A Ark\" was supposed to contain leaders, the \"C Ark\" to contain workers, and the \"B Ark\" to contain middle-men. It becomes apparent that the stories of impending doom were nonsense, and the A Ark and C Ark were never launched.\n\nThe story resumes some months later, with a meeting of the Colonisation Committee. Reports to the Committee include an update on the development of the wheel (it is unclear what colour it should be), and a documentary about the native cave-men of the planet, who have started to die out since the arrival of the Golgafrinchams.\n\nFord explains that they had done some research on the planet, and that it will last only two million years (but not why - because it is the pre-history of the Earth, and is thus due to be destroyed by the Vogons in two million years time).\n\nArthur attempts to teach the cave-men Scrabble, in order to try to stop the Golgafrinchams supplanting them. The cave-man spells out \"FORTY TWO\" on the scrabble board, and Ford and Arthur realise that the program must have gone wrong because of the arrival of the Golgafrinchams. They decide to use the same technique (of choosing scrabble letters) randomly to find out what the question in Arthur's brainwave patterns is, although it might be wrong anyway.\n\nThe question in his brain is revealed as \"WHAT DO YOU GET IF YOU MULTIPLY SIX BY NINE\". The episode ends as they decide to rejoin the Golgafrincham colony, and lament the inevitable eventual destruction of the Earth.\n\nThe regular ending music is replaced with \"What a Wonderful World\" by Louis Armstrong.\n\nMusic: \"Oxygène\" by Jean Michel Jarre; \"Volumina\" by György Ligeti; \"Volkstanz\" from \"Einsteig\" by Gruppe Between\".\n\nWhat became \"Fit the Seventh\" actually started as a \"Christmas Special\" episode, and an early draft included a reference to the holiday, though the episode, as transmitted, does not. Five further episodes, to complete the second series (later retitled \"The Secondary Phase\") were commissioned in May 1979. These final five episodes (the last on radio until 2004) were 'stripped,' or broadcast on each of five days in a single week in January 1980.\n\nTrillian is entirely missing from this series. Her fate is addressed in Fit the Seventh, that she had effected an escape but had then been forcibly married to the President of the Algolian chapter of the Galactic Rotary Club. The character returns in The Tertiary Phase, where she dismisses most of the events of the Secondary Phase as having been one of Zaphod's \"psychotic episodes.\"\n\nCast\n\nThe episode opens in the Hitchhiker's offices on Ursa Minor Beta, with a receptionist claiming that Zarniwoop, the editor of the guide, is too busy to take a call because he is both in his office, and on an intergalactic cruise.\n\nIt then moves to the bridge of a megafreighter that is due to land on Ursa Minor Beta. A crewmember denounces the Hitchhiker's Guide for being soft, and notes that he has heard they have created a whole artificial universe. Zaphod Beeblebrox is a hitch-hiker on the freighter, and as he listens to the radio, he hears a report that he has died, by being eaten by a Haggunenon. The manner of his escape is left unclear.\n\nMeanwhile, Arthur and Ford are stuck in Earth's pre-history, drunk. As they discuss their predicament, they notice a spaceship half-appearing in front of them. They celebrate their rescue, and it vanishes. Eventually they deduce that this is a time paradox, and they need to figure out how to signal the ship in the future so they can be rescued. Following this is the \"Guide's\" entry on the subject of towels, making its first appearance.\n\nOn the ship, Zaphod explains to the crewmember that he is going to Ursa Minor Beta to find out what he's doing. He received a message from himself the previous night, telling him to see Zarniwoop in order to learn something to his disadvantage. Zaphod then explains how he escaped - the Haggunenon turned into an escape capsule before it got the chance to eat him.\n\nZaphod arrives at the Hitchhiker's offices, and demands to see Zarniwoop, but is given the same excuses as before. After revealing his identity, he is directed to Zarniwoop's office, and meets up with Marvin, who had also survived and coincidentally arrived at the same place. After Marvin persuades the lift to take them upwards, the building starts to shake, due to it being bombed.\n\nZaphod is met by Roosta, who blames the bombing on Zaphod failing to conceal his presence on the planet adequately. A Frogstar Robot class D soon arrives to come and get Zaphod. Zaphod orders Marvin to stop it (which he does, by tricking it into destroying the floor it is standing on), whilst Zaphod and Roosta escape into the pocket universe in Zarniwoop's office.\n\nFrom the perspective of the three later radio series, all of the subsequent events of the Secondary Phase occur only in Zarniwoop's artificial universe, and not in the 'real' universe. They are later dismissed by Trillian as \"psychotic episodes.\"\n\nEventually, the Frogstar Robots decide to take the entire building back to the Frogstar.\n\nCast\n\nThe episode opens with Zaphod and Roosta in the Guide building, which is being towed to the Frogstar, \"the most totally evil place in the Galaxy\". Roosta explains that they are going to feed Zaphod to the \"Total Perspective Vortex\", which no one has ever survived. A Frogstar Prisoner Relations Officer teleports in, to taunt Zaphod.\n\nMeanwhile, in Earth's past, Ford and Arthur are still dealing with the rescue ship that has half-appeared in front of them. Rather stuck for how to signal it, they wave a towel at it, and surprisingly, the spaceship appears to notice this and lands rather catastrophically, trapping them under a boulder, and sending the towel into a lava flow.\n\nThey appear to be stuck, so they ask The Guide what to do if one is stuck under a rock, with no hope of rescue. The guide has an entry that begins, 'Consider how lucky you are that life has been good to you so far...'\n\nHowever, it becomes apparent that the boulder they are under is actually the ship, the \"Heart of Gold\", and Zaphod Beeblebrox comes out of it, rather the worse for wear. He explains that he has been put in the Total Perspective Vortex, and survived. After this, he celebrated and is hungover from a week's celebration. He explains that the towel had been fossilised, and when the Earth was blown up two million years later, the Improbability Drive picked it up.\n\nThe story then continues in flashback, picking up with Zaphod and Roosta on the Guide building. They attempt to escape with a \"body debit\" (teleport) card, but are foiled by the Relations Officer. He then tricks Zaphod into signing a consent form for entering the Vortex, and is then teleported to the service. He meets Gargravarr, a disembodied voice, the guardian of the Vortex. He is then placed in it, and exposed to its action, which is to place the user into Total Perspective by showing, with unfiltered perception, themselves in relation to the universe, for a moment. Zaphod survives, much to the astonishment of Gargravarr. He reports that it showed him that he is a \"really great guy\".\n\nCast\n\nThe episode opens with Ford and Arthur discussing Zaphod's sanity on board the \"Heart of Gold\". Ford also starts correcting Arthur's grammar, forcing Arthur to refer to Earth in the past tense, as it had been demolished in Fit the First. Ford then begins to question the reason given for the demolition, stating \"that was all done away with centuries ago. No one demolishes planets anymore.\" Ford has noticed another fleet of Vogon ships following the \"Heart of Gold\" at a distance of five light years for half an hour. He then calls for Marvin to bring Zaphod to the bridge.\n\nMeanwhile, Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz confirms the identity of the ship and its occupants, then proceeds to wipe out half his crew in a fit of rage. After this massacre, he contacts Gag Halfrunt. Halfrunt is revealed not only to be Jeltz's psychiatrist (as well as Zaphod's), but also the psychiatrist who originally hired Jeltz to destroy first the Earth, then any survivors. Jeltz is asked to hold off on his final destruction of the \"Heart of Gold\" until Halfrunt can make an arrangement for fees still owed by Zaphod.\n\nHalfrunt contacts Zaphod, who has since arrived on the \"Heart of Gold's\" bridge, but refuses to see the Vogon threat as anything more than a delusion of grandeur. Zaphod destroys the \"Heart of Gold's\" radio, then attempts to get the ship's computer to engage the Infinite Improbability Drive in order to get the \"Heart of Gold\" away from the Vogons. The computer states that this is not possible, as all its circuits have become busy with another task, and insists that the result will be something they can all \"Share and Enjoy.\"\n\nThe Guide explains that \"Share and Enjoy\" is the motto of the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation Complaints Division. A song, sung by the company's robots, with voices a flattened fifth out of tune, is heard. Another product of SCC that never works, the Nutrimat, is introduced, as Arthur is attempting to get it to dispense tea. Arthur eventually converses with the Nutrimat, the floor and the ventilation system, trying to convince them that he wants tea, when Eddie the ship's computer is finally brought in, to work out \"why the human prefers boiled leaves to everything we have to offer him...\"\n\nThis is then revealed to be the problem preventing the computer from evading the Vogons. Zaphod decides to contact his great-grandfather, Zaphod Beeblebrox IV, through a seance. More background behind Zaphod's actual job and a conspiracy to discover the real ruler of the universe is revealed. As the episode ends, Eddie has been restored to normal function, and engages the IID, getting the ship out of firing range of the Vogons in the nick of time.\n\nCast\n\nThe episode opens with more background material on Arthur Dent, specifically how the \"remarkably unremarkable\" human from Earth had an effect on the war between the G'Gugvunts and Vl'Hurgs, and will now have further significance on the planet Brontitall, where the \"Heart of Gold\" has just arrived. Zaphod and Ford discuss their arrival in a cave with Eddie the computer, noting the cold. Eddie calculates after they, and Arthur and Marvin, have departed the ship, that they are thirteen miles above ground level, despite there not being any mountains on the planet.\n\nThe four begin to explore the cave. Shortly, Arthur falls out of the cave mouth. Zaphod nearly falls as well, but catches the lip of the cave mouth, then discovers for himself that they are \"miles up in the air.\" Ford talks to Zaphod while the latter dangles.\n\nMeanwhile, Arthur has managed to fall onto a large passing bird. The bird reveals that the \"cave\" is actually a mile long marble sculpture of a plastic cup, hanging in the sky, part of a larger statue. The bird flies Arthur to the main statue, which is known as \"Arthur Dent Throwing the Nutrimatic Cup.\" Arthur then reveals himself to be the very person that the statue is modeled after, and the bird flies into the statue's right ear, where the rest of his kind live. Arthur meets them, and their leader, the Wise Old Bird, and learns a few things about the past of Brontitall. For example, the statue was built in Arthur's honour after his argument with the Nutrimat Machine inspired them to rid themselves of the \"blight of the robots\". There is one thing the birds refuse to speak of, however, and the Wise Old Bird tells Arthur, \"if you want to know, you will have to descend to the ground...\"\n\nThe Guide mentions how little is still considered to be unspeakable in the galaxy, except for the rudest word in existence: \"Belgium\". Zaphod uses this word to finally convince Ford to attempt a rescue, still dangling from the lip of the mile-long cup. The attempt fails, and both of them fall out of the cup, and onto another passing bird.\n\nOn the surface, Arthur encounters a Footwarrior, who has declared the planet of Brontitall to be the property of the Dolmansaxlil Galactic Shoe Corporation. Fleeing the Footwarrior, Arthur takes refuge in a trench with an archaeologist named Lintilla, who tells Arthur that she's on Brontitall to discover why the Footwarriors are all limping due to blisters, as the episode ends.\n\nCast\n\nAfter a brief recap, the episode opens with a conversation between Lintilla and Arthur. Lintilla mentions that she's an archaeologist, stranded on Brontitall, as her spaceship was disabled. She activates her crisis inducer, and leads Arthur through a set of tunnels. While they're running, the narrator describes the state of medical science in the universe, with artificially induced injuries.\n\nMeanwhile, Zaphod and Ford have landed on the back of one of the birds from the previous episode, and eventually convince it to reach the ground by wrapping Ford's towel around its eyes. But because the bird had to reach the ground, it and its fellow birds are upset, and start attacking Zaphod and Ford on the surface. A loud noise occurs, which causes the narrator to explain its lack of immediate context.\n\nArthur emerges from a tunnel behind Lintilla, who had overcompensated for her artificially induced crisis. Lintilla introduces Arthur to two of her \"sisters\" (actually clones), and they begin discussing the noise, finally establishing a context for it. Lintilla finally admits that there are 578,000,000,000 clones of herself in the universe. The narrator explains how this happened, and what is being done about it. Lintilla takes Arthur to the shaft suddenly created after the mysterious loud noise, and they finally confirm what the three Lintillas had been looking for: \"An entire archaeological layer of compressed shoes.\" After making this confirmation, they are captured by Hig Hurtenflurst, a Dolmansaxlil Shoe Corporation executive.\n\nThe narrator finally describes what made the noise and created the shaft that gave the Lintillas their breakthrough. It's none other than Marvin, who himself finally fell out of the cup that the \"Heart of Gold\" is parked in. He's lying at the bottom of a mile deep shaft, and goes \"zootlewurdle.\" Meanwhile, Hig has decided to take Lintilla and Arthur back to his office.\n\nHig explains the background of what happened to Brontitall - they fell victim to a Dolmansaxlil Shoe Shop Intensifier Ray, forcing them to construct nothing but shoe shops, and selling nothing but badly made shoes. Arthur learns that Earth was to be one of the next targets, spared from this by being demolished by the Vogons. The film being shown to Arthur and Lintilla explaining the Shoe Shop Intensifier Ray is suddenly interrupted, as is power to the office, when Marvin decides to rescue Arthur and Lintilla, and her two clones.\n\nThe narrator then explains that the Shoe Shop Intensifier Ray was unnecessary, that a \"Shoe Event Horizon\" would have occurred on that planet, and many other worlds, as part of their natural economic histories. A lesson from the future is heard, explaining this principle. Lintilla, Arthur and Marvin continue their escape, while Ford and Zaphod finally arrive at a large, very old building, and enter it to take shelter from the still angry bird people.\n\nThey discover that the building is a spaceport, and find abandoned ships left inside it. One such ship is still connected to supply lines, and still has power. Zaphod makes himself a stethoscope (for both heads), and holds it to the hull of this ship. He's stunned by what he hears inside, and here the episode ends.\n\nCast\n\nThe episode begins with a reprise of the action from Fit the Eleventh: Ford and Zaphod have discovered a derelict spaceport, including one ship, still intact, with its supply lines still connected, and still having power. Zaphod creates a stethoscope for both heads out of some pieces of tubing, and is shocked at what he hears inside. Ford asks to listen, and finally, everyone gets to hear an android stewardess making an announcement about their delayed space flight. Zaphod calculates that the ship is in fact over 900 years late. Ford and Zaphod agree to find their way into the ship to investigate further.\n\nMeanwhile, Arthur and Lintilla finally find Lintilla's two clones on Brontitall, but they, along with Marvin, are discovered by the Footwarriors as power is restored. Arthur agrees to run down the corridor while the others lay down cover fire with \"a gun of some sort\", then Arthur will have them throw the gun to him, so that he can lay down cover fire while they run to meet him. As Arthur completes the first part of this task, he's met by a man named Poodoo, a priest named Varntvar, and three men named Allitnil. During this confusion, Arthur manages to get Lintilla to throw the gun down the corridor, and starts firing to cover their run to join him. While Arthur does this, Poodoo is explaining how keen he is to introduce the Allitnils to the Lintillas, for a quiet social evening, and \"a priest [is] on hand in case anybody wants to get married at all. Just to round off the evening.\" Arthur questions his sanity.\n\nThe Lintillas finally join Arthur, and Poodoo seizes his opportunity to introduce the Allitnils to them. They are immediately overwhelmingly attracted to each other, but are warned off from kissing each other until married. The priest is then called upon to perform three weddings. As the weddings conclude and the men kiss their brides, two of the three pairs disappear in \"a puff of unsmoke\" as Arthur discovers that the marriage certificates are actually cloning machine company \"Agreements to Cease to Be\" and cries out, stopping the final couple from kissing.\n\nAt this point, we go back to Ford and Zaphod entering the very late space ship, just as the passengers are being woken from suspended animation for coffee and biscuits. Ford and Zaphod flee the scene, eventually arriving on the flight deck, where they are continually ordered by the autopilot to return to their seats. The autopilot argues with them over the statistical likelihood of another civilisation delivering the lemon soaked paper napkins required by the spaceship before it can depart, and Ford and Zaphod flee again, this time to the First Class compartment. Here, a man introduces himself to Zaphod as Zarniwoop, whom Zaphod had been seeking since Fit the Seventh.\n\nThe action returns to Arthur, the remaining Lintilla, and Marvin. We learn that Arthur had killed the last Allitnil, the anti-clone, and Marvin tied up Poodoo and Varntvar, leaving them forced to listen to a cassette tape of Marvin's autobiography. As they finally exit the Dolmansaxlil building, they set out for the same spaceport that Ford and Zaphod are in, but then discover that the suspended cup is heading towards the surface, with the \"Heart of Gold\" still inside.\n\nMeanwhile, Zarniwoop has offered Ford and Zaphod some drinks, and attempts to explain the whole situation to them. Zarniwoop starts by explaining that they had been in an artificially created universe within his office, then explains that he and Zaphod had co-conspired to discover who was really ruling the galaxy, as it was obvious it wasn't the President. Zaphod succeeds in his task, bringing the \"Heart of Gold\" - its improbability drive being necessary to reach the realm of the real ruler of the galaxy - to Zarniwoop's hiding place. Zarniwoop begins \"dismantling\" the artificial universe, and causes the cup to head to the surface outside.\n\nAfter the narrator describes who might be ruling the universe, we hear the voice of an old man attempting to feed his cat a bit of fish. This old man seems to have his own unique perspective on things, but had noticed a white ship approaching. This ship, the \"Heart of Gold\", discharges four of its passengers: Ford, Zaphod, Arthur and Zarniwoop, who approach the old man's shack. They attempt to question him about the decisions he makes about the galaxy, but he gives everything a vague answer. He does however reveal that he may have given his assent to the men who regularly seek his advice, thus giving Zaphod permission, under the pressure of the galaxy's psychiatrists, to destroy Earth before the Ultimate Question was revealed, thus securing their jobs. Arthur leaves angrily. Zarniwoop attempts further questions, but is eventually brushed off, and it's discovered that Arthur has made away with the \"Heart of Gold\", with Lintilla and Marvin aboard. This leaves Ford, Zaphod and Zarniwoop stranded on the \"Old Man in the Shack\"'s planet, and here the episode ends - though open-ended with a spoken possibility of another series.\n\nAs the first episode was originally commissioned as a pilot, much of the casting was done by Adams and Simon Brett, his original radio producer. Brett departed the BBC after the pilot episode was recorded, and so casting suggestions and decisions were made by Adams and Geoffrey Perkins for the remainder of both series. Perkins, using Brett's original notes, remarks that three or four people were auditioned for the part of the narrator, in search of a \"Peter Jones-y sort of voice\" before Peter Jones himself was actually contacted. Perkins also describes the casting of Simon Jones, Geoffrey McGivern, Jo Kendall, Bill Wallis and many others throughout the book containing the original radio series scripts.\n\nAdams's own notes on the casting of Peter Jones (\"who can we get to do a Peter Jonesey voice?\"), Stephen Moore (\"Stephen would find the character immediately and would make it really excellent\"), Mark Wing-Davey (\"He played a guy [in \"The Glittering Prizes\"] who took advantage of people and was very trendy\"), David Tate (\"He was one of the backbones of the series. We had him there every week\"), Richard Vernon (\"He's so funny. He carved himself a niche playing all sort of grandfatherly types\"), Susan Sheridan (\"Susan never found anything major to do with the role, but that wasn't her fault, it was my fault\") and Roy Hudd (\"To this day he still claims he doesn't know what it was all about\") can be found in Neil Gaiman's book \"Don't Panic: The Official Hitch-Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy Companion\".\n\nThe programme was aired on BBC Radio 4, a station that normally does not entertain repeats, on the following dates:\n\n\nIn 1980 a few American radio stations had broadcast the series (and a hardback was released in October), and the programme was finally broadcast in stereo by US National Public Radio in March 1981, prior to the first US book's paperback release in October of the same year. The episodes aired on NPR were not the complete episodes heard in the UK—they were edited down from their original 29+ minute running time to 25–26 minutes.\n\n"}

Produced in 2003, 2004 and 2018 by Above the Title Productions for BBC Radio 4, they are radio adaptations of the third, fourth, fifth and sixth books in Douglas Adams' \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\" series: \"Life, the Universe and Everything\"; \"So Long, and Thanks For All the Fish\"; \"Mostly Harmless\" and \"And Another Thing...\".\n\nThese radio series consisted of a total of twenty episodes, following on from the twelve episodes from the original two series (the Primary and Secondary Phases) which originally aired in 1978 and 1980.\n\nThe producers chose not to continue the ordinal sequence established by the Primary, Secondary and Tertiary phases. If they had done so, the fourth, fifth and sixth series would have been termed quaternary, quinary and senary. Humorously, they chose \"Quandary\", which means \"dilemma\", \"Quintessential\", which today means \"the most perfect example of something\" (although the original meaning of quintessential was \"fifth element\"), and \"Hexagonal\", which refers to something else entirely.\n\nThe Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy: Tertiary Phase, based on \"Life, the Universe and Everything\", ran on BBC Radio 4 from Tuesday 21 September to 26 October 2004, with repeats on the following Thursdays. Episodes were subtitled \"Fit the Thirteenth\" through \"Fit the Eighteenth\". The third novel was adapted by Dirk Maggs, John Langdon and Bruce Hyman following instructions left by Adams.\n\nMost of the original radio series cast returned, with the exception of three, due to their deaths: Richard Vernon (died 1997) as Slartibartfast, replaced by Richard Griffiths; Peter Jones (died 2000), replaced by his friend William Franklyn, with some brief excerpts from Jones' original narration used in disguised as the Book's speech-generation system changing as part of updates to the Guide from the publisher; David Tate (died 1996), who played a multitude of minor roles in the two original radio series including Eddie, the \"Heart of Gold's\" computer. Bill Wallis, who played the roles of Mr Prosser and Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz in the original series, was not available. Toby Longworth took the role of Jeltz in the new series. On the other hand, John Marsh, who was the original series' continuity announcer, returned to announce the credits. There was even a cameo role by Adams himself (who had died in 2001) as Agrajag, edited from his BBC audiobook recording of the novel.\n\nThe original novel was based on a treatment that Adams wrote for an unmade \"Doctor Who\" movie, \"Doctor Who and the Krikkitmen\". The idea was re-proposed during Tom Baker's tenure in the title role, and again for a potential (but unmade) second television series of \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\".\n\nBefore the final episode was broadcast, BBC Worldwide released the Tertiary Phase on CD, including additional material. A DVD of the series was released on 2 October 2006 in the UK. This marks the first commercial release of any BBC radio programme in a 5.1 surround mix. The disc contains as extras: the full version of the Krikkit Song, a photogallery, the original online and radio trailers, the appearance of the series on Pick of the Week, and thirty minutes of behind the scenes video in five short segments. Note that while the BBC online shop is still listing the disc as a DVD-Audio disc, their own image confirms that the disc is a lower-definition standard DVD-Video. .\n\nSince the opening of the third book starts at the same place and time (prehistoric Earth) as the opening of the second radio series, the entire Secondary Phase was dismissed as one of Zaphod's \"psychotic episodes\" (including events that did take place in the books). Hints, however, were interspersed in the subsequent fourth and fifth series that would ultimately tie all five together. The UK edition of the novel was used for the adaptation—this becomes evident in Fit the Sixteenth, when the \"Rory\" award is said to be given for the Most Gratuitous Use Of The Word Fuck In A Serious Screenplay. The US edition of the same novel substituted \"Belgium\" for \"fuck\", as well as the explanation for why the former word is considered to be devastatingly rude in the rest of the galaxy, which is drawn from Fit the Tenth of the Secondary Phase. The broadcast version avoids saying \"fuck\" on radio by well-timed crashes and explosions—the CD version moves these so that the \"fuck\" is audible.\n\n\nArthur wakes up in a cave on pre-historic Earth (thus ignoring the events of the Secondary Phase), on the day, four years after he last saw Ford Prefect, that Ford arrives back. Ford carries news that he has detected disturbances in the \"space-time wash\", and that they might be able to escape. The disturbance turns out to be an old sofa, which materialises in a field. They chase the sofa as it runs off, and then are transported elsewhere.\n\nZaphod and Trillian are on the \"Heart of Gold\", without Marvin. Zaphod is extremely hung over, and upset that Trillian is dismissing the events of The Secondary Phase as a \"psychotic episode\". Trillian wishes to do something and is getting increasingly annoyed at Zaphod. After preparing a fabulous meal, and Zaphod still refusing to come out of the bathroom, she teleports away, telling the ship to \"transport me the hell out of Zaphod Beeblebrox's life.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Marvin is on a swamp on Sqornshellous Zeta, conversing with the native life-forms, mattresses. He is circling around and around on one leg, while his artificial (i.e. replacement) leg is stuck in the swamp.\n\n\nArthur and Ford arrive at Lord's Cricket Ground on the sofa that they had caught in the previous episode. They have arrived in the final Test Match in the Ashes, in the middle of the field. A policeman apprehends them, and they retire to the pavilion.\n\nWatching the match, Arthur drinks some tea and glances upon a newspaper. He notices the date on the newspaper, and realises that it was from the day before the Earth was demolished. A ball lands in Arthur's bag, and when the fielder comes to collect it, Arthur decides to keep it.\n\nWith the planet about to be demolished again, they then look for another lift from the planet. They discover a spaceship, hidden by a \"Somebody Else's Problem field\", hidden behind a screen.\n\nThe game finishes, with England winning the Ashes, and Slartibartfast joins Arthur and Ford. Slartibartfast explains that he has arrived because \"something terrible is about to happen\". He walks to the centre of the cricket pitch, and asks to be given the Ashes saying that they are \"vitally important for the past, present and future safety of the Galaxy\".\n\nAnother spaceship arrives. Eleven white robots, carrying bats, and wearing rocket pads on their shins (dressed like cricketers), come suddenly out, and start attacking the spectators and players with their bats, using them to hit grenade-like explosives at the humans present. They take the Ashes, say \"we declare\", and go back into their ship. Ford and Arthur catch a lift with Slartibartfast on his ship.\n\nMeanwhile, Marvin is once again making conversation with a mattress. A similar ship to before arrives, and white robots get out and take Marvin's one remaining leg. After a brief while, they return and decide to take all of Marvin instead.\n\n\nSlartibartfast shows Ford and Arthur an Informational Illusion about the Krikkit Wars and the Wikkit Gate, and that the game of cricket on Earth is a \"racial memory\" of the Wars. Investigating further, they discover that the Krikkitmen, a previously peaceful people, built their first spaceship in a year, after a spaceship landed on their planet. The planet and its sun had been previously obscured in a dust cloud that left the Krikkitmen unaware of the existence or even possibility of existence of stars. It is considered remarkable that they constructed a working ship in just a year. After they saw the rest of the universe existed, they decided to annihilate it.\n\nMeanwhile, on the \"Heart of Gold\", Zaphod Beeblebrox hears the noise of thousands of people saying \"Wop\". He intercepts them on the bridge, where he is told they want the \"Golden Bail\", the ship's Infinite Improbability Drive. They take it, shoot him, and leave.\n\nBack on Slartibartfast's ship, Ford and Arthur watch the Krikkit War Crimes Trial, presided over by Judiciary Pag. Pag's sentence is that Krikkit will be locked in an envelope of \"Slo-Time\", until the universe has ended, when it will be released, thus saving the universe from attack from Krikkit, and allowing Krikkit to exist in isolation after the end of the universe. However, a Krikkit ship escaped.\n\nSlartibartfast notes that parts of the key to the Wikkit Gate, sealing the envelope of Slo-Time, have been re-appearing. After a failed attempt to recover the Wooden Pillar (the Ashes), Slartibartfast plans to go to a party, to locate the Silver Bail. Ford disagrees with this objective but agrees with the concept of going to a party. They teleport from the ship.\n\nArthur does not materialise with Ford and Slartibartfast, but elsewhere, in a gloomy room, with signs such as \"DO NOT BE ALARMED. BE VERY VERY FRIGHTENED, ARTHUR DENT\". The episode ends on a cliff-hanger, with the previously unintroduced character of Agrajag saying \"Bet you weren't expecting to see me again.\"\n\nThe episode includes several Guide interludes, notably the story of Lallafa the poet, and a description of Brockian Ultra-Cricket.\n\n\nThe episode begins with Arthur, who has been \"diverted\" by Agrajag, who claims that Arthur has killed previous incarnations of him hundreds of times. He also claims to have been the bowl of petunias that materialised into existence in Fit the Third. Eventually it transpires one of the deaths was at Stavromula Beta, where someone tried to assassinate Arthur, and he ducked, hitting Agrajag. Arthur however has never been there. Agrajag cries \"I've brought you here too zarking soon\", but decides to attempt to kill Arthur anyway.\n\nArthur and Agrajag struggle, and Agrajag dies. Arthur escapes from the Cathedral of Hate, to which he had been diverted, by running into a passageway in the mountain. He notes that he has somehow ended up with the wrong bag—one he lost on Earth many years ago. He trips, and falls, only to discover that he is flying. He experiments with flying for a while, only to be hit in the small of the back by the party which Ford and Slartibartfast are attempting to enter.\n\nThe party is flying as well, and Ford and Slartibartfast are on a ledge around the building, not being permitted entry due to the lack of a bottle. Arthur remembers that his bag contains a bottle of Retsina, and this gets them entry. They see Trillian and Thor at the party, where Thor is chatting Trillian up.\n\nThey quiz people trying to find the Silver Bail, and discover that it has been instantiated as an award (a Rory) for the Most Gratuitous Use Of The Word Fuck In A Serious Screenplay. Before they are actually able to find it, the Krikkit robots appear, massacre the party-goers and take the Silver Bail.\n\nArthur tricks Thor into walking out of the building by challenging him to fight, leaving Trillian with no choice but to come with them. The Krikkitmen now have all the parts of the Wikkit Key, and Slartibartfast notes that their next move must be to go to the Wikkit Gate itself and try to intervene.\n\n\nThe episode opens with a Guide entry about the Silastic Armorfiends, a very aggressive species, who apparently were the first race ever to shock a computer, by asking it (Hactar) to design the \"Ultimate Weapon\". Hactar designed one, a small bomb which would destroy every sun in the universe by connecting them in hyperspace. However, it turned out to be a dud, because Hactar had decided that any possible consequence of making it a dud would be better than it actually being used. The Silastic Armorfiends were unimpressed with this and destroyed Hactar, and later themselves.\n\nThey arrive at the asteroid, but too late to do anything but watch. The Krikkit robots place the key into the Wikkit Gate, revealing Krikkit. As the robots from the escaped Krikkit ship leave their ship, they notice that Zaphod Beeblebrox is with them, who gets knocked out by the Krikkitmen, who then proceed to actually destroy the lock. Zaphod explains that they had brought him on their ship, but had not killed him; but not for any obvious reason.\n\nZaphod comes with the others on Slartibartfast's ship, where Slartibartfast announces that they have no choice but to go down to the surface of Krikkit. Arthur had recovered two items—the Golden Bail, in order to allow the \"Heart of Gold\" to work once more, and more importantly, the Ashes of the Wooden Pillar. Zaphod returns to the \"Heart of Gold\", and asks Trillian whether she wishes to come with him—she declines.\n\nArthur, Ford, Trillian and Slartibartfast finally land on Krikkit, where they notice that there are hundreds of floating buildings and warships above the surface. They are soon apprehended by some Krikkitmen, who ask them if they are aliens. The Krikkitmen ask them about the \"balance of nature\". They express concern that the plan of universal destruction would upset the balance of nature, and also would stop them from having sporting links with the rest of the Galaxy.\n\nThe leader of the group, in private, explains to Trillian they have a bomb, that can destroy everything that exists, and cries about this. Aware of the cliche, Trillian asks him to \"take me to your leader\", who resides \"up there\" in the sky, far away from the Krikkitmen on the surface.\n\nMeanwhile, the others notice that the \"Heart of Gold\" is visible in the war zones above the planet. Zaphod sneaks into one of the floating buildings, where he finds the original starship that crash-landed on Krikkit. He recognises it instantly as a fake, designed to teach a non-spacefaring race how spaceships work. He later overhears a conversation between two Krikkit officers, and that apparently the robots are getting depressed and do fiendishly difficult quadratic equations instead of fighting. The episode ends with Zaphod over-hearing Marvin sing a depressing song.\n\n\nFord, Arthur and Slartibartfast are on the surface of Krikkit, prisoners of the Krikkitmen, and waiting for Trillian to get back, or for Zaphod to do something.\n\nZaphod has discovered Marvin, who since he was stolen by the Krikkit robots, has been plugged into the Krikkit mainframe and is being used as its central computer, hence depressing the robots, and making them unable to kill Zaphod. Marvin shows Zaphod CCTV of Trillian talking to the Elders of Krikkit.\n\nTrillian is explaining that Krikkit's history is a sequence of contrived coincidences that was set up in order to provoke a race into wanting to destroy the universe. She points out their ultimate weapon, the supernova bomb, would destroy Krikkit as well, and that they ought to know that if they'd built it themselves instead of taking instructions from Hactar. A robot (independent from Marvin) detonates the bomb, only for it to turn out to be a dud.\n\nArthur, Ford, Marvin, Slartibartfast, Trillian and Zaphod all return to the \"Heart of Gold\", just outside the dust cloud. A pocket of pseudo-gravity has opened with an oxygen atmosphere, and Arthur and Trillian exit the airlock into it.\n\nThere, they meet Hactar, who explains that when the Silastic Armorfiends tried to destroy him, they failed, and because of his cellular nature, he was eventually able to coalesce sufficiently to influence things. In the long years he grew to regret his decision to make the bomb a dud. He created the dust cloud around Krikkit and also the fake wrecked spacecraft that provoked them to develop spaceflight. He knows they are going to destroy them, and they do. His final words are \"I have fulfilled my function...\"\n\nThey have in the mean-time picked up a man named Prak, who was a witness at a trial when the Krikkit robots broke in and stole the Perspex Pillar. The robots jogged the arm of the person administering him truth drugs, and he took a huge overdose. He was then told to tell \"the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth\"—a horrifying fate. The court-house was abandoned, with him in place.\n\nHe has apparently stopped telling it (\"there not nearly as much of it as people imagine\"), but is still finding much of it, particularly frogs and Arthur Dent, hilarious. They ask him if he knows the Question to the Ultimate Answer of 42. He explains that knowledge of the Question and the Answer are mutually exclusive and that if both were to be known the universe would be replaced by something more bizarre and inexplicable. However, he does have the address of God's Last Message to his Creation, which he gives to them, but before Arthur is able to take down the address, Prak dies.\n\nAfter this, they return to Lord's Cricket Ground, on Earth, after the Krikkit robot attack, to return the Ashes. In the destruction, Arthur is unable to find anyone to return the Ashes to. He notes that he is at Lord's, and one of his ambitions was always to bowl at Lord's. He still has the ball he caught last time he was there, he decides to bowl the ball at the batsman standing at the wicket.\n\nMid-run, Ford points out that \"it's not an England batsman, it's a Krikkit robot\", and that the ball is probably a supernova bomb, and not a dud. He finds himself unable to stop running and bowls anyway. It goes wide, and Ford catches the ball, the universe being saved by Arthur's poor bowling. Arthur decapitates the robot with its own bat, and then expresses his desire for a cup of tea.\n\nA fourth and fifth series based on \"So Long, and Thanks For All the Fish\" and \"Mostly Harmless\" respectively follow. The names for these series were chosen because they sound \"less daunting, more memorable and are a bit easier to spell\" than the standard terms quaternary and quinary.\n\nWhile these were treated as the fourth and fifth Hitchhiker's Guide radio series, they were broadcast in one eight-week stretch in May and June 2005. The tradition of \"Fits\" continues; these were known as Fit the Nineteenth through Fit the Twenty-Sixth. The manner of broadcasting these episodes carries over from the Tertiary Phase: the original broadcast was on Tuesday, with a Thursday repeat (with the exception of Fit the Nineteenth, which was not repeated due to election coverage). After the initial Tuesday broadcast, audio streams of the episode were available until the following Tuesday. For these final phases, the core cast (Simon Jones, Geoffrey McGivern, Mark Wing-Davey, Susan Sheridan and Stephen Moore) returned, along with William Franklyn as the new voice of The Book (assisted by Rula Lenska). In addition, David Dixon, Sandra Dickinson, Bill Paterson, Roy Hudd and Jonathan Pryce, who had roles in the TV adaptation or the original radio series, all returned, though Dixon and Paterson both play new roles.\n\nThe \"Quandary Phase\" was released in a 2-CD set in late May 2005. The CDs contain material not present in the original transmissions, due to time constraints. The enclosed booklet contains notes from Dirk Maggs, Simon Jones, Bruce Hyman and Helen Chattwell. A 2-CD release of the \"Quintessential Phase\" was released in mid-June 2005, with similar material left out of the original transmissions, and notes in the booklet by the same four individuals.\n\n\nArthur discovers that the entry for \"Earth\" in the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, which formerly had been edited down to \"Mostly Harmless\", has been replaced, with Ford's original full version. They head towards Earth independently, Arthur arriving first. After landing in a field in Somerset, Arthur tries to hike a lift to Cottington, to see if his house still exists. Along the way, he meets Rob McKenna, a man who complains about the rain, before realising he has hitched a lift the wrong way. He gets out, and gets a lift with Russell, whose sister, Fenchurch, is out cold on a back seat of the car. Arthur is instantly smitten, and asks about her. Russell claims that she is mad, and has been ever since \"the hallucinations\"—the Vogon Constructor Fleet.\n\nOn the Constructor Fleet, a junior crew member notices that Earth has re-appeared. He is overridden by the captain, Jeltz, who declares that he saw it destroyed himself.\n\nMeanwhile, Ford is stuck in a bar with a large bill, which he avoids paying by promising to write an entry for the bar in the Guide. On the streets, he is asked by a hooker whether he is \"rich\", and says that he might be—being owed several years back pay for writing two words. He shows the two words—\"Mostly Harmless\"—to the hooker, and is shocked to see the guide updating this to his full entry. He decides to go to Earth himself.\n\n\nArthur arrives at his house, finding it undemolished and the phone ringing. He is unable to get to the phone before it rings off. The contents of the house are as he left them, apart from a large pile of junk mail just inside the front door, and a strange bowl, bearing the inscription \"So Long and Thanks for All the Fish\". He phones his boss at the BBC to explain that he has been absent due to going mad and would return to work when hedgehogs come out of hibernation (plus a few minutes to have a shave).\n\nDriving, he encounters Fenchurch again, and gives her a lift to the train station, saying that he has something he wants to tell her. At the station pub they attempt to engage in conversation, but are interrupted by someone offering raffle tickets. Fenchurch has to leave to catch her train, and leaves her phone number on a ticket—with which Arthur then wins the raffle.\n\nDistraught, Arthur decides to find the Islington cave that he spent some years in during prehistoric times. He knocks on a few doors in Islington near where he thinks that cave was, firstly calling at Friends of the World. When there he attempts to make a donation to \"save the dolphins\" but is met with mockery from the \"Ecological Man\" (played by David Dixon, Ford Prefect from the television series. There is a brief allusion to the TV series as Arthur asks if they've met before). The next door he knocks on is Fenchurch's. She is surprised that he didn't call first, shows him his misplaced copy of the Guide, and notes that they need to talk.\n\n\nFenchurch tells Arthur about her revelation at the time of the Vogon fleet's visit. At her urging, Arthur figures out that her feet do not touch the ground, leading him to suspect that she also can fly, and to a romantic tryst on the wing of a Heathrow-bound airplane.\n\nCurious about the dolphins' fate, Arthur and Fenchurch head to California to visit Wonko the Sane, a scientist considered the foremost expert on the species. Wonko, who lives in an inside-out house called \"The Outside of the Asylum\" and claims to have had conversations with green-winged angels, tells Arthur and Fenchurch that they all received the same glass bowls—farewell gifts from the dolphins that, when pinged, play their final message to humans.\n\nMeanwhile, a Vogon inquiry reveals that Earth's location in a plural zone means that any destroyed version is highly likely to be replaced by an alternate one. The Vogons decide that all Earths must still be destroyed, even though the bypass project has been cancelled.\n\nThe music that plays when Arthur determines that Fenchurch can fly, and again during the end credits, is strongly reminiscent of the style of Dire Straits. The book, \"So Long, and Thanks for all the Fish\", says that Arthur and Fenchurch listened to Dire Straits on a Walkman cassette player, with two sets of headphones, while flying together (inspired by the music that Douglas Adams listened to whilst writing the book).\n\n\nFenchurch and Arthur return to England, to discover that a large spaceship has landed in Knightsbridge, London, bringing Ford Prefect with it. Fenchurch, Arthur and Ford leave on the ship. Arthur begins to suspect that this is not the Earth he and Ford knew—there is a \"Tricia McMillan\" on the news, with an American accent and blonde hair (voiced by Sandra Dickinson, who played Trillian in the TV series), but otherwise identical to the Trillian who left his earth with Zaphod Beeblebrox. Fenchurch and Arthur go to see God's Final Message to His Creation, and bump into Marvin, who is also en route to see it. Marvin is now 37 times older than the universe itself, and needs assistance to read the message, which turns out to be \"WE APOLOGISE FOR THE INCONVENIENCE\". Declaring that he thinks he feels good about the message, Marvin dies.\n\nThis is followed by an event only mentioned in \"Mostly Harmless\". Fenchurch asks Arthur to show her the universe. However, on a commercial liner flight, Fenchurch disappears, and the ship's crew deny she ever existed...\n\nAt the conclusion of the show's credits, a tie-in website is announced: McKenna's All-Weather Haulage.\n\nThe Quintessential Phase has one sub-plot of Zaphod attempting to reach Zarniwoop (which did occur in Fit the Twelfth, but that version was dismissed during the Tertiary Phase as Zaphod having a \"psychotic episode\"—another version of events occurs here, in an attempt to interconnect all five series). Zarniwoop has been merged with the character Vann Harl from \"Mostly Harmless\". This radio series also sees the return of the characters of Max Quordlepleen, Thor, and Zarquon (who all appeared in Fit the Fifth at Milliways), and also Mr. Prosser, from Fit the First. None of these characters appear in the book version of \"Mostly Harmless\".\n\nThe start of some of the plot threads from \"Mostly Harmless\" were introduced in the Quandary Phase (though they did not appear in \"So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish\")—notably the Vogons discovering that Earth had re-appeared and resolving to destroy all versions of it, Arthur having sold his DNA, a mention that Trillian now has a child and is now a reporter. Also the final episode saw the introduction of an alternate version of Trillian, still known as Tricia McMillan, who is identical to the original Trillian except for being blonde and American. This alternate McMillan is played by Sandra Dickinson, who played Trillian in the television series.\n\nThe events at the end of this series are referenced in the latest \"Hitchiker\" book, \"And Another Thing...\" by Eoin Colfer, where the dream sequence the Hitchhiker's Guide Mk.2 puts Trillian into involves the Babel Fish teleporting her and the other main characters away from the destroyed Earth to Milliways, similar to one of the endings. Van Harl is also mentioned as Zarniwoop Van Harl, among other nods to the radio series such as a reference to Brontitall and the bird people from the Secondary Phase that were never put into the novels.\n\n\nThe episode opens with a Grebulon spaceship suffering an accident, and losing nearly all records of what it is and what it should be doing, along with the crew's memories of why. Based on what little remains of their orders, they land on the tenth planet from the Sun, and start to 'monitor' Earth.\n\nAfter a year's travelling Arthur has returned to the co-ordinates ZZ9 plural Z alpha—where he is expecting to find Earth, and perhaps Fenchurch. In its place, he finds a barely colonised planet called NowWhat, although with the right continents for Earth. The creature at the information desk explains that beings from a \"plural\" region are not advised to travel in hyperspace due to the risk of slipping in dimensions. He is directed to Hawalius, a planet of oracles.\n\nDuring a flashback, the introduction between Trillian and Zaphod Beeblebrox is revealed. But on a parallel Earth, an American and blonde Tricia McMillan (who was left behind by her universe's Zaphod) is interviewing Gail Andrews, an astrologer, about the effect that the recently discovered planet Persephone (nicknamed Rupert) will have on astrology. The Grebulons, monitoring this, have an idea.\n\nLater, Andrews and McMillan talk. Andrews has sensed that McMillan is unhappy about the stars—McMillan reveals that she met an alien (Zaphod Beeblebrox) at a party once (a variation of the previous flashback ensues), but didn't get to go with him because she fetched her bag. She also reveals that she just missed out on a TV job in New York City because she did not go back to fetch her bag.\n\nMeanwhile, Zaphod (who does not appear in the book) is attempting to meet Zarniwoop once more, convinced that the Total Perspective Vortex (from Fit the Eighth) was not just his imagination. He has arrived at Saquo-Pilia Hensha, the new location of the offices for The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. He sneaks into the building pretending to deliver pizza, and goes to the editor's office. He meets Zarniwoop Vann Harl, who promises to explain matters.\n\nThe story turns back to Arthur, who has arrived at Hawalius. He is told by an oracle that prophecy is a dead business now, due to news reports from the future using time travel. He is given a piece of free advice—\"it'll all end in tears, probably already has\", and sent on his way to the next cave.\n\nBack at the Hitchhiker's building, Ford is also sneaking in. He climbs into the building through the ventilation system, disables a security robot (which he dubs \"Colin\") by hardwiring it to be happy all the time, and then gets it to cover his entrance to the editor's office, finding out along the way that the Guide has been taken over and is no longer owned by Megadodo Publications. He too manages to get into the editor's office and finds that Vann Harl has been expecting Ford. The episode ends here on a cliff-hanger.\n\n\nArthur is still trying to gain advice on the planet Hawalius, but when he finally leaves the planet, the spaceship he's on develops \"a major glitch\" just as they jump into hyperspace. Meanwhile, on Earth, Tricia McMillan agrees to go with the Grebulons and work out a system of astrology that would be valid on the planet Persephone (Rupert), in exchange for exclusive rights to the story.\n\nBack in \"The Guide\"'s offices, Zarniwoop Vann Harl, the new editor of the guide, asks Ford to be his restaurant critic. He explains that there is a new Guide, aimed at families rather than hitchhikers, and they plan to make one and sell it in billions of billions of alternate worlds. Ford steals the Dine-a-Charge and Ident-i-Eze cards from him, then hacks into the accountancy system. The universe there is equated with the artificial universe inside Zarniwoop's office, and Ford discovers Zaphod, in a shack by the beach, claiming he has been there on his own for a month. Zaphod claims that the Presidency and the Krikkitmen were just a distraction, and that they have \"shrunk the Vortex and given it the voice of that Lintilla chick\" in order to create the new Guide. The episode ends with Ford going to floor 23, and being forced to jump out of a window, in order to escape from Zarniwoop Vann Harl, who is revealed to be a disguised Vogon.\n\n\nArthur Dent has, since the last episode, settled on the planet his ship crash-landed on, Lamuella, which is partly in a \"plural zone\". He is occupied as The Sandwich Maker, making sandwiches for the inhabitants of a village from the meat of the Perfectly Normal Beast. Perfectly Normal Beasts are rather like bison, and migrate.\n\nA messenger brings news to the Sandwich Maker that a spaceship has landed on the planet. When Arthur approaches it, he is surprised to see Trillian disembark. Trillian explains that the crash was known about, but nobody has been to rescue him for insurance reasons. She explains that she had a daughter, named Random, using sperm sold by Arthur, and has come to drop off her daughter (of indeterminate age due to time travel, but probably around 16), whilst she is off covering a war.\n\nAt the Hitchhiker's Guide building, Ford saves himself by using Colin's antigravity systems to get to a ledge on the 13th floor of the building. He bypasses the rocket-proof glass by unlatching the window. Colin notes that the rocket-proof glass was installed after the Frogstar attack on the building (in Fit the Seventh), which Ford knows nothing about.\n\nMeanwhile, on Lamuella, Random is not settling in well. Born on a spaceship going from one place to another place, she doesn't consider anywhere home, and Earth, the world both her parents are from, has been destroyed. A robot courier arrives with a package, for Ford Prefect care of Arthur Dent, which Arthur decides to keep safely closed on the basis that anything that involves Ford Prefect is dangerous. Distraught at her lack of place in the universe, Random runs off with the package into the forest, which is considered haunted by the natives of Lamuella.\n\nRandom discovers that the holo-entertainment system from the rocket ship that Arthur Dent crash landed in, which is still functional, as the source of the \"hauntings\". She opens the package, revealing the Guide Mark II, in the form of a black bird. The Bird explains the nature of probability and that some alternative Earths do exist, and persuades Random to go to one of them. Random challenges the Bird to get her a spaceship there, and just at that moment, one lands. She downs the pilot with a well-thrown rock, and leaves Lamuella.\n\nThe alternate Tricia McMillan has been taken to Rupert and meets the Grebulon leader, who explains their problem of having forgotten everything, and their reasoning in trying to gain purpose through astrology. Meanwhile, Arthur has been looking for Random and has seen the spaceship. Searching the forest he stumbles onto the pilot of the ship, Ford Prefect.\n\n\nThe episode opens with Ford and Arthur on Lamuella. Ford explains about the new guide and its ability to use Reverse Temporal Engineering in order to arrange circumstances for the benefit of its user. Ford's spaceship itself he obtained by jumping from a building and falling into it, its previous occupant having accidentally pressed the wrong sort of eject button. Tracing\nback, he discovered that a trail of coincidences led back to the new Guide, which was responsible. With Random stealing the ship and the Bird, they are stuck, with no immediate way to get offworld to prevent the Vogons from doing whatever it is they intend to do. They decide that the Perfectly Normal Beasts are the best way off the planet. The migration has already started, and this sees them appear at one point, run past Lamuella, and then disappear again, evidence of a dimensional shift. Old Thrashbarg helps them slow a Perfectly Normal Beast long enough for them to get onto it, and tells them that they will be entering the Domain of the King.\n\nOn the alternate Earth, Tricia McMillan has returned from Rupert, and is lamenting that none of the footage she has taken is usable. She is interrupted by a member of the hotel staff, telling her that a spaceship has landed in Regent's Park, and the young girl on the ship is demanding to see her. Meanwhile, the Grebulon leader is still unhappy. Whilst they now have horoscopes, he now knows that unless he takes positive action, then due to the Earth rising, he will have a very bad month. He decides to investigate the possible astrological uses of the Grebulon's gun turrets.\n\nArthur and Ford arrive at the \"Domain of the King Bar and Grill\", which has numerous spaceships outside of it, including a large pink one. Inside, they have a couple of bacon rolls, whilst Ford buys the pink spaceship from the bar singer, Elvis Presley. They then depart for Earth. After arriving, they find that Tricia McMillan has taken Random to a club, and go there themselves. A strange man confronts Arthur, and says \"I told you not to come here!\" Arthur and Ford find Random, along with Tricia and Trillian (who had arrived in the meantime on a third spaceship). Random is holding a gun and threatening to shoot. Trillian explains they must leave the planet immediately, as the Grebulons (a missing spaceship from the war she was sent to cover) are about to destroy the planet, once again.\n\nArthur explains it is impossible for him to die (and hence for the planet to be destroyed), but the strange man goes for Random's gun and she ends up shooting him. Trillian points out the name of the club to Arthur—Stavro Müller Beta—while Arthur realizes the strange man is Agrajag. Arthur accepts his fate, and the Earth is destroyed...\n\nAn updated edition of the Guide notes that Babel fish share the ability of the dolphins in shifting sideways in probability when required, bringing their host and sometimes other people in the vicinity with them, and notes that this in fact has happened. The Guide shares the fate of Arthur in two alternate realities: the first, continuing from the end of Fit the Twelfth, sees Arthur and Lintilla and several of her clones aboard the \"Heart of Gold\"; the second sees Arthur from the beginning of the story, this time battling Prosser over the fate of his home, with Fenchurch now lying with him in front of the bulldozer.\n\nThe Guide then details the true reality of what happened: the Babel Fish brought Arthur, Ford, Random, Zaphod and Trillian (now merged with Tricia) to Milliways, the Restaurant at the End of the Universe, Table 42. Zaphod discovers Marvin was still under warranty and has been restored to physical health, and is once again washing cars at Milliways, albeit with a promotion, and Arthur discovers the waitress serving their table is Fenchurch, who has been at Milliways waiting for him to turn up. As Wowbagger the Infinitely Prolonged arrives to insult the Great Prophet Zarquon, making his perennial appearance on the Milliways stage, Wowbagger's immortality is rescinded, and he dies. Elsewhere in the universe, Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz, having finally destroyed the Earth after all this time, is able to tick the box on his orders and move on. Reunited, Arthur promises to take Fenchurch flying.\n\nOn Thursday 8 March 2018, 40 years to the day of the first series' original broadcast in 1978, a sixth series dubbed the \"Hexagonal Phase\" began broadcasting on BBC Radio 4. This series was based on the sixth novel And Another Thing... by Eoin Colfer and featured members of both the original radio and television casts.\n\nCast:\n\n"}
{"id": "1897463", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1897463", "title": "Wah-Wah (film)", "text": "Wah-Wah (film)\n\nWah-Wah is a 2005 drama film written and directed by Richard E. Grant. Loosely based on his childhood in Swaziland (now Eswatini), as depicted in Grant's memoir, \"The Wah-Wah Diaries\", it stars Nicholas Hoult, Gabriel Byrne, Emily Watson, Miranda Richardson and Julie Walters.\n\nFilmed and set in Swaziland, the film was first shown at the Cannes Film Market on 13 May 2005 and premiered at the Edinburgh International Film Festival on 17 August 2005. It then toured to various festivals before receiving a limited release in the United States on 5 May 2006, followed by its release in the United Kingdom on 2 June 2006.\n\nWith this semi-autobiographical tale of his childhood in Swaziland during the last days of the British Empire in Africa in the 1960s, Grant relates the story of Ralph Compton, whose family’s disintegration mirrors the end of British rule. After witnessing his mother's adultery with his father's best friend, Ralph must survive not only boarding school but also his beloved father's remarriage to Ruby, a fast-talking American Airlines flight attendant, and his father's gradual descent into alcoholism.\n\nGrant initially wrote the film loosely based on his own childhood experiences after a screenwriter recommended he write a screenplay after reading his memoirs of his \"Withnail and I\" experiences. The first meeting with a producer took place in 1999 and the film took almost seven years from then to complete. Grant initially had trouble securing actors; Rachel Weisz, Toni Collette, Meg Ryan, Emmanuelle Béart, Ralph Fiennes and Jeremy Irons all turned down roles. Julie Walters was eventually the first actor to be signed. Grant intended for the part of Ralph to be played by two actors but the casting director, Celestia Fox, insisted on one actor. During the casting sessions, Grant noticed the similarity between Zac Fox and Nicholas Hoult and persuaded Celestia Fox to cast them. The part of the father was meant to be younger but, as all the actors asked in that age range passed on the role, an older actor (Gabriel Byrne) was chosen. After the original producer left the project due to a career change, Grant was approached by Marie-Castille Mention-Schaar to produce the project, a decision he later came to regret.\n\nThe film was the first to have been shot in Swaziland. Filming began in July 2004 and took place over seven weeks and post-production took place in England and France.\n\n\"Wah-Wah\" received its premiere at the Edinburgh International Film Festival and received a special Toronto International Film Festival screening in September 2005. Grant also kept a diary of his experiences of the film, later published as a book, (\"The Wah-Wah Diaries\"), which was met positively by the critics, many of whom were impressed at the honesty of the tale, especially in regard to his frictional relationship with the \"inexperienced\" producer. Grant mentioned in subsequent interviews that she was a \"control freak out of control\" and that he would \"never see her again as long as [he] lives\". In a BBC interview, he again mentioned his \"disastrous\" relationship with Mention-Schaar, relating that he received five emails in the last two months of pre-production from her, that she rarely turned up on the set and failed to obtain clearance both for the song rights and to actually film in Swaziland (without the knowledge of Grant, who eventually was forced to meet the King of Swaziland to seek clemency).\n\nCritics were split on \"Wah-Wah\". BBC Movies said it was \"superbly performed and fluently shot\", but lamented its uninteresting subject. David Hughes of Empire magazine said that the film was \"an unforced, engaging and surprisingly incisive account of the disintegration of British rule in Africa\". \"Time Out\" noted that \"Gabriel Byrne gives a great performance as Ralph’s troubled father, Harry, and Miranda Richardson and Emily Watson are enjoyable as Harry’s wife and American lover\". Variety said that \"above all, the film has a wonderful sense of ensemble in the portrayal of its inbred community, and the focus stays tight on the people rather than political events\" and The Los Angeles Times said that \"Grant opens up his life, not with embarrassment or explanation but with humanity and gratitude. Emotional, melodramatic and sentimental, the film unabashedly wears its heart on its sleeve, and is the better for it.\" Roger Ebert was less praising, noting that he \"admired the movie and was happy to see it but can think of two other films about whites in Africa that do a better job of seeing their roles (\"Nowhere in Africa\" and \"White Mischief\").\" It currently (February 2018) has a 53% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, the review aggregator site.\n\nThe film received a limited release and only grossed $2.8 million worldwide on a $7 million budget.\n\n"}
{"id": "1897473", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1897473", "title": "Gustavo Leigh", "text": "Gustavo Leigh\n\nAir General Gustavo Leigh Guzmán (September 19, 1920 – September 29, 1999) was a Chilean general, who represented the Air Force in the 1973 Chilean coup d'état and, for a time, in the ruling junta that followed. Leigh was forced out of the military government in 1978.\n\nLeigh was born in Santiago, son of Army Colonel Hernán Leigh Bañados and Laura Guzmán Cea. After a brilliant career as a combat pilot, President Salvador Allende named him commander-in-chief of the Air Force on August 17, 1973, disregarding the established basis of seniority. However, Leigh was the first to sign the coup document, drafted by Vice Admiral José Toribio Merino, to depose Allende.\n\nLeigh quickly emerged as the toughest member in the four-man military junta. Just hours after the coup, Leigh vowed that the military would \"\"eradicate the Marxist cancer from our fatherland, until the last consequences.\"\" It was on his personal orders, he disclosed later, that the Air Force bombarded and heavily damaged the presidential palace to put down the resistance by Allende and a small group of his followers. He responded to criticisms that his order to bomb the La Moneda palace saying, \"\"It was a hard measure to take, but believe me when I say that [...] it was a measure that saved many lives, because President Allende had decided to die in La Moneda [...].\"\"\n\nA fierce persecution of leftists followed, and Leigh's Air Force gained a reputation as especially implacable with dissidents. Leigh defended the coup, arguing that a civil war between Chileans was inevitable. When American President Jimmy Carter criticized the military rule in Chile in 1977, Leigh said, \"He [Carter] is a hypocrite. He condemns Chile, but at the same time he wants closer relations with a dictatorship like Castro's in Cuba, that had led an authoritarian regime for 18 years.\"\n\nHe purged the Air Force of left-wing officers such as General Alberto Bachelet (the father of Michelle Bachelet, future Chilean president) and repeatedly called on Chileans to denounce left-wingers to the new authorities. Nonetheless he clashed with Augusto Pinochet, the leader of the junta over the latter's refusal to name a date for a return to democracy. Leigh opposed Pinochet's growing power within the junta. In 1978, when Pinochet called a vote to request that Chileans reject the United Nation's condemnation of the regime's human rights record, Leigh called the move \"typical of governments in which power is in the hands of a single dictator.\" Pinochet believed Leigh wanted to challenge him to lead the country. \"Pinochet always felt that I was interested in taking over from him, something that never even entered my mind,\" Leigh said in one of his last television interviews.\n\nGeneral Leigh was a supporter of strong state intervention in the economy. He was heavily influenced by the Egyptian model being built by Anwar Sadat (he was a close friend of Hosni Mubarak, the Egyptian Air Force Chief, since 1971) of a mixed economy based on free market principles but a strong state presence in heavy industry and a strong state regulation over imports and the financial speculation market. He had continuous disagreements with the prevailing free market economic policy of the so-called Chicago Boys that was favoured by the US as well as Pinochet himself. He was strongly opposed to any divestment or privatisation in the State owned mining company Codelco. That led to his dismissal on July 24, 1978, in a decree signed by other junta members.\n\nThe junta selected General Fernando Matthei to replace him. Despite his strong differences with General Pinochet, he strongly opposed Pinochet's 1998 arrest as a violation of Chilean sovereignty.\n\nLeigh was detained by a judge investigating his role in the disappearance of twelve communist leaders, but the Supreme Court of Chile ordered his release by virtue of the Law of Amnesty.\n\nOn March 21, 1990 members of the leftist guerrilla group, the Manuel Rodríguez Patriotic Front, broke into Leigh's office and opened fire at him. Five bullets hit his body. Other than the loss of an eye, he was able to make a complete recovery.\n\nLeigh died of cardiovascular ailments in Santiago's Air Force Hospital on September 29, 1999, aged 79.\n\nMarras S.

Primarily a tag team wrestler, Roberts is known for his appearances as one of The Hollywood Blonds in the 1970s and as one of The Fabulous Freebirds in the 1980s. He was inducted into the Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame in 2015 and the WWE Hall of Fame in 2016.\n\nHey was raised in Newton, Surrey and went to Princess Margaret High School, in BC Canada graduating in 1965. After school, he worked in local lumber mills as well as being a bouncer at nightclubs including the Grooveyard in New Westminster. He became an American citizen in 1974.\n\nHey was trained as a professional wrestler by Ivan Koloff. He debuted in 1965 under the ring name \"Dale Valentine\", billed as being the younger brother of Johnny Valentine.\n\nAt the tail end of the 1960s, he was working as a preliminary wrestler in the American Wrestling Association (AWA).\n\nIn 1970, Hey was brought into the Oklahoma-based NWA Tri-State promotion by booker Bill Watts. Watts had intended to create a new tag team comprising Jack Donovan and veteran journeyman Jerry Brown. After Donovan left the promotion following a dispute with Watts, Watts hired Hey in his place. Hey was renamed \"Buddy Roberts\" and began teaming with Brown as The Hollywood Blonds. In 1972, Oliver Humperdink began managing The Hollywood Blonds.\n\nThe team of Brown and Roberts won numerous regional tag team titles across the United States throughout the 1970s.\n\nAfter splitting from Brown, Roberts joined with Michael Hayes and Terry Gordy to form The Fabulous Freebirds. Again, Bill Watts played a major role in this decision. Hayes and Gordy had been teaming together in various promotions in the Mid-South and Southeastern regions of the United States for several years, but Watts was not as impressed with Hayes's in-ring work as he was with his skills on the microphone. His original plan was to have Gordy and Roberts as the actual tag team, with Hayes as their manager. Except for a high-profile stint in 1980 in Mid-South Wrestling (formed by Watts the previous year after breaking away from NWA Tri-State) with Hayes and Gordy as the Freebirds, Roberts did not work full-time with the team until they joined World Class Championship Wrestling (see below).\n\nHe later became known as Buddy \"Jack\" Roberts, due to his penchant for drinking Jack Daniel's whiskey.\n\nThe Fabulous Freebirds won several titles and moved on to World Class Championship Wrestling in late 1982 and began a high-profile feud with the Von Erich family. They wrestled David Von Erich, Kerry Von Erich, Mike Von Erich and Kevin Von Erich numerous times in 1986. Roberts also had a long-standing feud with Von Erich ally Chris Adams, which lasted on and off for more than five years.\n\nRoberts' most famous singles angle came in WCCW in 1983, and involved the invention of what the Freebirds referred to as \"Freebird Hair Removal Cream\". The angle culminated in a hair match between Roberts and Iceman Parsons on June 17. Roberts seemingly won the match via tight-pulling, but the decision was reversed and the match restarted. In the fracas, Roberts' head was lathered in the hair removal cream. At subsequent events, Roberts wore a wig, kept in place by boxing headgear.\n\nIn 1984, Roberts and the Freebirds had a short stint in the World Wrestling Federation, mainly competing in six-man tag matches. Here, they were managed by Cyndi Lauper's manager, David Wolff. They left the promotion when WWF officials stated their intention to split the team up. At the AWA's SuperClash in 1985, Roberts helped Hayes and Gordy defeat The Road Warriors for the AWA World Tag Team Championship, but the decision was later reversed.\n\nIn early 1986, The Freebirds went to the Universal Wrestling Federation, where Roberts won the UWF Television Championship on September 28. He lost it to Savannah Jack on November 9.\n\nIn 1987, The Freebirds split up and reformed. Roberts and Gordy turned on Hayes and teamed with Iceman Parsons to feud with Hayes and the Von Erichs. Gordy eventually left Roberts to rejoin Hayes. The feud ended in late 1988 when Hayes and Gordy left for the NWA's Jim Crockett Promotions, and Roberts acted as a manager to the Samoan Swat Team before he retired from wrestling. Roberts also had a short feud with World Class referee David Manning, which included several gimmick matches, such as Roberts wrestling with one arm tied behind his back. Manning, who was touted as an accomplished amateur wrestler by the promotion to compensate for the obvious size difference between the two, won most of the matches on a fluke.\n\nRoberts managed Hayes and Jimmy Garvin in one match against Steve Armstrong and Tracy Smothers in World Championship Wrestling (WCW) on September 5, 1990. He came out of retirement on April 2, 1993 for the Global Wrestling Federation's Kerry Von Erich Memorial Show, and teamed with Michael Hayes (with Skandor Akbar in their corner), losing to Kevin Von Erich and Chris Adams (with Fritz Von Erich in their corner).\n\nRoberts later developed throat cancer, and had surgery to treat it. He was quoted as saying \"Don't smoke. I think the reason this happened to me is because I was smoking too much. I recommend to anyone who smokes to quit now. It is hard, but it is worth it.\"\n\nRoberts died on November 26, 2012, at the age of 65, of pneumonia.\n\nOn April 2, 2016, Roberts was posthumously inducted into the WWE Hall Of Fame by his son, Buddy \"Jack\" Roberts Jr. as part of The Fabulous Freebirds.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1897483", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1897483", "title": "Costa Rican Central Valley", "text": "Costa Rican Central Valley\n\nThe Central Valley () is a plateau and a geographic region of central Costa Rica. The land in the valley is a relative plain, despite being surrounded by several mountains and volcanos, the latter part of the Central Range. The region houses almost three quarters of Costa Ricans, and includes the capital and most populous city, San José. The valley is shared among the provinces of Alajuela, Heredia, San José and Cartago. The region occupies an area of 11,366 km², more than a fifth of the country, and is drained by the Tárcoles River on the west side and by the Reventazón River on the east side.\n\nThe Central Valley is commonly considered to extend from the city of San Ramón in Alajuela in the west, to the city of Paraíso in Cartago in the east. The mountains north of the valley are part of the Central Range. There are four main volcanoes north of the valley, namely Poás, Barva, Irazú and Turrialba. The mountains that round the plateau to the south form part of the Talamanca Range. A smaller range, the Carpintera Hills, which runs from north to south roughly along the border between the provinces of San José and Cartago, divides the valley into two sections. The western section is normally referred to as \"Western Valley\" or \"Central Valley\" proper and the eastern section is referred to as the Eastern Valley or \"Valle del Guarco\". This smaller range also impacts the weather and ecosystems of the two subregions, with the Western Valley significantly influenced by the weather patterns of Costa Rica's Pacific coast and the Eastern Valley influenced by the Caribbean coast weather.\n\nBecause of its altitude, the temperature in the Central Valley varies between 15°C and 30°C, mainly because of the position toward the mountains (the altitude also varies between 800 m and 1,500 m above sea level). The western part of the valley is influenced by trade winds in summer, and, as the rest of the country with the exception of the Caribbean region, there are two climate seasons clearly defined, wet and dry. The eastern part of the valley is influenced more by Caribbean conditions, which are more volatile. Precipitation in the region varies from 1,900 mm in an urban and central place like Pavas to 3,200 mm in a rural and mountainous place like Fraijanes. Humidity varies from 75% (10% of volatility) in Pavas, to 87% (rarely descending to less than 80%) in Fraijanes.\n\nThe Central Valley had been traditionally the favorite place for Costa Ricans to live, and even today it contains an unequal distribution of population of the country, in relation to its size. This is because of the fertility of land in the region, helped by the influence of volcanoes and rivers that run through the valley. Weather also favours agriculture and farming activities. Because of the agglomeration of population, the valley is the center of commerce, industry and service activities, sustained by ports on both coasts, and by Liberia in Guanacaste (which has the other international airport besides Juan Santamaría Airport in Alajuela) that have similar economic movement.\n\nCosta Rica's Greater Metropolitan Area (GAM) covers an extension roughly the same as the Central Valley.\n"}

He was part of the Junta from 1977 to 1990, retiring from the Air Force in July 1991.\n\nThe son of Fernando Matthei Aubel Gunkel and Luisa Gunkel Renz, Matthei entered the Aviation School in 1945 and the following year he was assigned to the Condors Air Base, where he obtained his appointment as a fighter pilot. In 1948, he was commissioned as a sublieutenant and was assigned to the No. 4 Bomber Group in Colina, serving concurrently as a flight instructor at the School of Aviation and Officers. He was promoted to lieutenant in 1951. That same year he married Elda Fornet, with whom he had five children: Fernando, Evelyn, Robert, Hedy Jaqueline and Victor Alejandro.\n\nIn 1953 he traveled to the United States to study flight instruction at Craig Air Force Base in Alabama. He was promoted to flight captain in 1954, teaching classes in arms at the Aviation School. In 1957, he was assigned to Wing 1 in the Antofagasta Cerro Moreno Base.\n\nPosted to Santiago in 1960, he was promoted to squadron commander and sent to the School of Aviation. He became the adjutant to the air force commander in chief, General Eduardo Iensen, the following year.\n\nIn 1966 he was promoted to group commander and served as commander of Aviation Group Nº7 between 1968-1969, when he was sent to visit facilities of the Royal Air Force (RAF).

Later the same day, the government stated that the referendum result would be respected and that the 1980 Constitution path to democracy would be strictly followed.\n\nIn 1990, with the return of democracy, Matthei ceased to be a member of the military junta, but retained his position as the commander in chief of the Air Force. He retired voluntarily on 31 July 1991 (although, as Pinochet, he could have continued to serve until 1998) and noted that with his retirement, the air force could fully adapt to democracy.\n\n2003 saw the publishing of the book \"Matthei. Mi testimonio\", written by Chilean historians Patricia Arancibia and Isabel de la Maza, in which Matthei recounts his public life.\n\nIn September 2005, Matthei admitted in a television program that he \"did everything possible so that Argentina would lose\" the 1982 Falklands War with Britain. The extent of Chilean assistance to the UK is documented in a book, \"My Secret Falklands War\", by retired Royal Air Force Wing Commander Sidney Edwards, who was sent to Chile by the British government to act as a liaison between the Chilean and British governments during the conflict.\n\nMatthei was born among a community of German Chileans in Southern Chile.

It is currently driven by Mark List, Elvis Lainez, Armando Castro, Marc Mcdonald, and Scott Buetow. Other drivers of have included Dan Rodoni, Aaron Basl, Ryan Huffaker, Joey Parnell, Chris Baker, and Nathan Weenk. It features one of the first 3-D body shells, with horns sticking out of the roof. This body was originally designed for Bulldozer, and was found a second use for El Toro Loco. As El Toro Loco has increased in popularity, it has become the primary truck for the body style. The truck is commonly known for \"snorting\" smoke out of its nose, which is toggled by a button inside the truck.\n\nThe truck was created by SFX and PACE Motorsports in 2001, and the truck was driven by Lupe Soza, who had previously owned and driven Warrior from the 80s. The truck was a huge success among kids primarily. The idea stuck around.\n\nIn 2003, the truck made its first Monster Jam World Finals appearance with Lupe Soza still behind-the-wheel. With a poor performance in racing, \"The Crazy Bull\" made up for it in freestyle. Lupe Soza had the performance of a lifetime, featuring a crazy corkscrew flip off of an RV, and then getting the truck stuck on top of a sea container, earning him a second-place performance with a sensational score of 36 out of a possible 40.\n\nIn 2004, El Toro Loco was a Monster Jam World Finals freestyle co-champion with Madusa driven by Debrah Miceli, and Maximum Destruction driven by Tom Meents, all tied with a score of 31.\n\nIn 2013, El Toro Loco was given a makeover, creating a new black bodied truck piloted by Marc McDonald and a yellow bodied truck under the reign of Becky McDonough. The classic red bodies are still ran by Chuck Werner, Dan Rodoni, and veteran Lupe Soza.\n\nWith the truck being in the Top 10 of top merchandise sales with Monster Jam, the team was expanded to now 4 trucks as of 2012. The trucks are similar in terms of body design, but each chassis is unique and different. Marc McDonald is considered the \"leader\" of the pact of trucks, and he drives the newest El Toro Loco of anybody, with a Carroll Racing Development (CRD) chassis, featuring a lower center-of-gravity design and a softer landing suspension. Becky McDonough drives a Patrick Enterprises Incorporated (PEI) chassis, that is a couple of years old, and has been used before in competition. Chuck Werner was a part of Meents Racing a few years before, so his chassis is a Willman-style chassis, with the engine in the front and the axles designed a little different from many others. Aaron Basl and Ryan Huffaker use to share driving duties with a Racesource designed chassis by monster truck racing legend Pablo Huffaker until 2014 where they pilot the Wolverine monster truck.\n\nIn 2015, Becky McDonough drove the yellow El Toro Loco on the inaugural #MoreMonsterJam tour. Chuck Werner drove the red El Toro Loco on the new Fox Sports 1 Championship Series, and made history by scoring the first ever point on the series for being the fastest qualifier at Houston. He won freestyle in St. Louis a few weeks later.\n\nFor 2016, a red El Toro Loco is run on the AMSOIL Series with rookie driver Mark List behind the wheel. Mark won the first overall event in 2016 at Tulsa, Oklahoma. Becky McDonough currently has two points on the FS1 Championship Series in the yellow El Toro Loco. Dan Rodoni put his two trucks up for sale and has not driven in 2016.\n\nIn 2019, an El Toro Loco is run on Stadium Championship Series 2 in team ice for the Monster Jam Fire and Ice element.

It stars Aishwarya Rai, Naveen Andrews, Miranda Richardson, Robbie Coltrane, Nandita Das and Steve McFadden. The film is loosely based on the true story of Kiranjit Ahluwalia, who killed her abusive husband.\n\nCinematography for the film was handled by Madhu Ambat. The film's score and soundtrack was composed by A. R. Rahman, and the theme song for the film, \"Alive\", was composed by Rahman and sung by Karen David, who has a small cameo in the film. Shot in London, the film was released theatrically in April 2007.\n\nKiranjit Ahluwalia (Aishwarya Rai), a Punjabi woman, marries Deepak Ahluwalia (Naveen Andrews) in an arranged marriage and moves to Southall, UK with him to be closer to his family. Initially he seems caring and affectionate towards her but soon enough the true colors of her husband begin to show as Deepak gradually reveals a darker, threatening, and even sociopathic side of himself. After enduring ten years of abuse and having two children with him, Kiranjit, unable to bear the brutality and repeated rapes at the hands of her husband any longer, sets fire to his feet while he is sleeping, unintentionally killing him. Charged with murder, her case comes to the notice of a group of South Asian social workers running an under funded organization called the Southall Black Sisters.\n\nKiranjit is sentenced to life imprisonment with possibility of parole in 12 years. She befriends her cellmate, a White woman named Veronica Scott (Miranda Richardson), who teaches her English. Veronica is also friends with several girls in the prison and stands up for Kiranjit against the local prison bully, Doreen (Lorraine Bruce). Veronica enlists her brother, Edward Foster (Robbie Coltrane), a highly respected Queen's Counsel, to aide in Kiranjit's appeal. Edward, in turn, realizes Kiranjit's importance to his sister and the importance of her case. His sister's request has additional meaning given that Veronica would not let him help her with her own appeal due to their on off relationship since childhood.\n\nBefore Kiranjit's appeal hearing the Southall Black Sisters bring her plight to the attention of the media by organizing rallies to gather public support for her freedom. She is ultimately freed by the judicial system in a landmark case called \"R v Ahluwalia\", redefining \"provocation\" in cases of battered women in the UK.\n\nThis film was screened in the Marché du Film Cannes Film Market during the Cannes Film Festival in April 2006. Aishwarya Rai was present with director Jag Mundhra to promote the film through press conferences and parties. In June, the film opened the 2006 International Indian Film Academy Film Festival in Dubai. The screening was attended by Bollywood personalities including Amitabh Bachan and Shabana Azmi, as well as by international media.\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes the film has a rating of 29 percent. View London gave a two stars out of five said \"Provoked is just about worth seeing for its important subject matter and for Aishwarya Rai's performance but it's a real struggle at times, due to the astonishingly inept direction.\" BBC gave three stars said, \"Provoked avoids sentimentality and illustrates how one woman's bravery helped fuel a nationwide crusade and irrevocably altered British laws on domestic violence\". Derek Elley from \"Variety\" stated \"With Rai dignified in a largely reactive role, it's the playing by thesps like Richardson and Das, both excellent, that broadens the pic's emotional palette. Main weakness is that, in the flashbacks, Deepak's role has little backgrounding, and his violent outbursts are given no psychological underpinnings. Picture is more a quality meller, with clearly defined heroes and villains, than a slice of social realism. But for viewers prepared to go with the flow, it works at a gut, movie-movie level\". The Times which gave a three stars describes \"The key to the picture is its resonant message: everyone should see it to be reminded that domestic violence will never be acceptable, and that the law will now not tolerate it. Mundra thankfully gets Aishwarya Rai to drop her annoying Bollywood mannerisms and surrounds her with sturdy, mainly British, supporting actors. The result is that the actress finally delivers a performance which is not only moving but worthy of the fiery material\". UK Channel Film4 rated four stars gave a verdict \"A bold story, told with sensitivity and compassion\".\n\nRediff gave a three stars said \"Provoked is an important story which definitely needs to be told. What is disheartening is the way it is. Sure, the treatment is realistic, production values are good, and the acting is mostly commendable -- but the screenplay (Paul Austin, Rahila Gupta) is shockingly superficial. Aishwarya Rai, on her part, is sincerity personified. No make-up, pretty clothes or even a smile adorn her naturally gorgeous disposition. But those eyes play their part. With changing circumstances her big blue-green brimming eyes look shocked, grieved, frightened, confused and relieved. Her effort to speak in fluent Punjabi is truly impressive\". CNN-IBN's Rajeev Masand gave a \"Good\" verdict and stated \"In all honesty, \"Provoked\" wouldn't work if it wasn't for two performances that uplift the film considerably. It's a sensitive film about domestic abuse. The real star of Provoked is Aishwarya Rai who delivers a performance that is appropriately restrained. [...] I'll say here, she surprises you with what she strums up. It's a performance that penetrates into your consciousness because she plays it with a slow-burning passion rather than an all-out flourish. This is easily one of her better acting jobs\".\n\n\"Daily News and Analysis\" which also gave a three star rating said \"With a story like this it would have been very easy to go overboard, it is to director Jag Mundhra's credit that he keeps a tight leash on the melodrama aspect of the story. Aishwarya Rai plays the battered wife in what is undoubtedly one of her best performances to date. Starting as the young, coy and simpering wife, Kiranjit, who is abused to such an extent that she sets her husband Deepak, (Naveen Andrews), on fire after a particularly brutal beating one night, Rai convincingly goes through the various stages of shock, bewilderment, remorse and finally vindication.\" \"Times Of India\" stated that \"It's Aishwarya's film from the word go. The story is powerful, yes, but the passion and the pain finds articulation through Aishwarya's sensitive rendition of the protagonist. From the very first shot, the actor grabs the role by its horns and shakes it around to sculpt a moving portrayal of a battered woman who happens to chance upon a rare source of inner strength to fight against domestic terror and terrifying traditions that demand silence from a wife, come what may\". Critic Subhash K Jha wrote \"Provoked answers the complicated question of domestic disharmony with a deft and direct approach to the question of a woman's place in the man's scream of things. Full credit to Aishwarya Rai for plunging deep into a part that she plays straight from her heart. There're moments in the narrative where Rai melts your heart like an ice-cream cone left out in the sun for too long\".\n\n\"The Indian Express\" gave four stars stating, \"It's a film of substance. A film based on real life. A film that would move many. A film that would make a difference in many a lives. Aishwarya has done a good job. She has definitely brought forth the trauma and torture borne by the character. And the absence of her overdone make-up and glamorous good-looks has made her look more attractive (!) and fit into the role well\".\n\nAfter seeing the film, Patel is said to have told the \"Observer\" newspaper \"I cringe a bit because I was so closely involved. Sometimes I think people should rise to the challenge of reflecting real life better. My view is that the reality is far more interesting.\"\n\nRahila Gupta, who co-wrote \"Circle of Light\" and the script, stated: \"It's a shame that film is an artistic form in which you have to make a fair amount of compromises to make it happen.\" She criticised the film's characterisation as \"one dimensional\", and the portrayal of Kiranjit Ahluwalia's husband as an alcoholic.\n\nIn the film Kiranjit Ahluwalia is portrayed as a middle class homemaker instead of a factory worker as she was in reality, Pragna Patel and Rahila Gupta's characters are merged to create one person, played by the Indian actress Nandita Das, and Americanized legal terminology rather than the actual British. The director Jagmohan \"Jag\" Mundhra in his defense said \"Even if you tell a true story, a true story is never really a true story. How do you define the truth? None of us were really there and obviously the recollections of people who were there have changed now. Ultimately I do have to tell an engaging story. If I can't tell an engaging story no matter what cause is at stake, nobody will see it.\"\n\nThe film fared well at the UK BoxOffice, thus turning out to be a success.\n\nThe score and the theme song of the film were composed by Academy Award winner Indian composer A. R. Rahman. The theme song, \"Alive\" was composed by Rahman, and written and performed by Karen David. The other tracks were done by Karen David. According to her blog, these songs were co-written with Rahman, however Rahman has officially confirmed that he has done only a single track for the film. Another version of the song \"Alive\" was recorded by Shreya Ghoshal but was not featured in the movie or officially released. The Hindi Version of 'Alive' was named 'Zindagi and was written by Mayur Puri.\n"}

{"id": "1897503", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1897503", "title": "Bruno Taut", "text": "Bruno Taut\n\nBruno Julius Florian Taut (4 May 1880 – 24 December 1938) was a renowned German architect, urban planner and author. He was active during the Weimar period and is known for his theoretical works as well as his building designs.\n\nTaut was born in Königsberg in 1880. After secondary school, he studied at the Baugewerkschule. In the following years, Taut worked in the offices of various architects in Hamburg and Wiesbaden. In 1903, he was employed by Bruno Möhring in Berlin, where he acquainted himself with \"Jugendstil\" and new building methods combining steel with masonry. From 1904 to 1908, Taut worked in Stuttgart for Theodor Fischer and studied urban planning. He received his first commission through Fischer in 1906, which involved the renovation of the village church in Unterriexingen.\n\nIn 1908, he returned to Berlin to study art history and construction at the \"Royal Technical Higher School of Charlottenburg\" (\"Königlich Technische Hochschule Charlottenburg\"), now the Technical University of Berlin. A year later, he established the architecture firm Taut & Hoffmann with Franz Hoffmann.\n\nTaut's first large projects came in 1913. He became a committed follower of the Garden City movement, evidenced by his design for the Falkenberg Estate.\n\nTaut adopted the futuristic ideals and techniques of the avant-garde as seen in the prismatic dome of the Glass Pavilion, which he built for the association of the German glass industry for the 1914 Werkbund Exhibition in Cologne. His aim was to make a whole building out of glass instead of merely using glass as a surface or decorative material. He created glass-treaded metal staircases, a waterfall with underlighting, and colored walls of mosaic glass. His sketches for the publication \"Alpine Architecture\" (1917) are the work of an unabashed utopian visionary, and he is classified as a Modernist and in particular an Expressionist. Much of Taut's literary work in German remains untranslated into English.\n\nIn 1910 after training in Berlin, working for Theodor Fischer's firm in Stuttgart, and establishing his own firm in Berlin, the experienced architect Hermann Muthesius suggested that Taut visit England to learn the garden city philosophy. Muthesius also introduced him to some of the \"Deutscher Werkbund\" group of architects, including Walter Gropius. Taut had socialist sympathies, and before World War I this hindered his advancement.\n\nTaut's practical activity changed with World War I. He became a pacifist and so avoided military service. He began to write and sketch, less to escape from the brutalities of war than to present a positive utopia in opposition to this reality. Taut designed an immense circular garden city with a radius of about 7 km (4.3 mi) for three million inhabitants. The \"City Crown\" was to be in the very center. \"Mighty and inaccessible\", it would have been the culmination of a community and cultural center, a skyscraper-like, purpose-free \"crystal building\". \"The building contains nothing but one beautiful room which can be reached by either of two staircases to the right and to the left of the theatre and the little community center. How can I even begin to describe what it is only possible to construct!\", said Taut of the City Crown.\n\nTaut completed two housing projects in Magdeburg from 1912 through 1915, which were influenced directly by the humane functionalism and urban design solutions of the garden city philosophy. The reform estate, created for a housing trust, was built in 1912–15 in the southwest of Magdeburg. The estate consists of one-story terrace houses and was the first project in which Taut used colour as a design principle. The construction of the estate was continued by Carl Krayl. Taut served as a city architect in Magdeburg from 1921 to 1923. During his time a few residential developments were built, one of which was the Hermann Beims estate (1925–28) with 2,100 apartments. Taut designed the exhibition hall \"City and Countryside\" in 1921 with concrete trusses and a central skylight.\n\nA lifelong painter, Taut was distinguished from his European modernist contemporaries by his devotion to color. As in Magdeburg, he applied lively, clashing colors to his first major commission, the 1912 \"Gartenstadt Falkenberg\" housing estate in Berlin, which became known as the \"Paint Box Estates\". The 1914 Glass Pavilion, an illustration of the new possibilities of glass, was also brightly colored. The difference between Taut and his Modernist contemporaries was never more obvious than at the 1927 \"Weissenhofsiedlung\" housing exhibition in Stuttgart. In contrast to the pure-white entries from Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and Walter Gropius, Taut's house (Number 19) was painted in primary colors. Le Corbusier is reported to have exclaimed, \"My God, Taut is colour-blind!\"\n\nIn 1924 Taut was made chief architect of , a Berlin public housing cooperative, and was the main designer of several successful large residential developments (\"Gross-Siedlungen\") in Berlin, notably the 1925 \"Hufeisensiedlung\" (\"Horseshoe Estate\"), named for its configuration around a pond, and the 1926 Onkel-Toms-Hütte development (\"Uncle Tom's Cabin\") in Zehlendorf, named for a local restaurant and set in a thick grove of trees. Both of these constructions became prominent examples of the use of colorful details in architecture.\n\nTaut worked for the city architect of Berlin, Martin Wagner, on some of Berlin's Modernist Housing Estates, now recognized as UNESCO World Heritage Sites. The designs featured controversial modern flat roofs; access to sunlight, air, and gardens; and generous amenities like gas, electric light, and bathrooms. Political conservatives complained that these developments were too opulent for 'simple people'. The progressive Berlin mayor, Gustav Böss, defended them: \"We want to bring the lower levels of society higher.\"\n\nBetween 1924 and 1931, Taut's team completed more than 12,000 dwellings. In tribute to Taut, GEHAG incorporated an abstracted graphic of the Horseshoe Estate in its logo. This state housing association was sold by the Senate of Berlin in 1998; its legal successor is Deutsche Wohnen.\n\nBeing a noted advocate of socialist political policies, Taut was compelled to look for opportunities to emigrate from Germany when the Nazis gained power. He was promised work in the USSR in 1932 and 1933 but was obliged to return to Germany in February 1933 to a hostile political environment.\n\nLater in the same year, Taut fled to Switzerland. Then, with an invitation from Japanese architect Isaburo Ueno, he traveled to Japan via France, Greece, Turkey and Vladivostok, arriving in Tsuruga, Japan, on May 3, 1933. Taut made his home in Takasaki, Gunma, where he produced three influential book-length appreciations of Japanese culture and architecture, comparing the historical simplicity of Japanese architecture with modernist discipline. For a time Taut worked as an industrial design teacher, and his models of lamps and furniture sold at the Miratiss shop in Tokyo.\n\nTaut was noted for his appreciation of the stark, minimalist vein of Japanese architecture found at the Ise Shrine and the Katsura Imperial Villa in Kyoto. He was the first to write extensively about the architectural features of the Katsura Imperial Villa from a modernist perspective. Contrasting it with the elaborately decorated shrines of shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu at Nikkō, Tochigi, he famously said that \"Japan's architectural arts could not rise higher than Katsura, nor sink lower than Nikko\". Taut's writing on the Japanese minimalist aesthetic found an appreciative audience in Japan and subsequently influenced the work of Le Corbusier and Walter Gropius.\n\nThe only extant Taut-designed architectural work in Japan is the extension to the Hyuga Villa at Atami in Shizuoka. Built-in 1936 on a site below the original villa owned by businessman Rihei Hyuga, and part modern and part traditional Japanese in style, the three rooms provided additional space for social events and views over nearby Sagami Bay.\n\nOffered a position as Professor of Architecture at the State Academy of Fine Arts in Istanbul (currently, Mimar Sinan University of Fine Arts), Taut relocated to Turkey in 1936. In Ankara he joined other German wartime exiles, including Martin Wagner and Taut's associate Franz Hillinger, who arrived in 1938. Some of Taut's work was received unfavorably, however, and labeled as \"cubic\". In a letter to a Japanese friend he wrote, \"They gave me a great opportunity in that they gave me freedom for my craft. I will make a building that is not 'cubic'; they are calling all modernism cubic. For this building, I am thinking of using some Turkish motifs.\" He proceeded to design his own house in İstanbul's Ortaköy neighborhood, bridging the architectural traditions of his exile existence. His studio resembled that of the Einstein Tower in Potsdam, while the front view recalled a Japanese pagoda.\n\nAfter leaving Germany, Taut gradually moved away from modernism. A colleague remarked that \"Like everyone who gets old, Taut is stuck with Renaissance principles and cannot find a way towards the new! I am very disappointed... It is a shame for such an avant-gardist.\"\n\nBefore his death in 1938, Taut wrote at least one more book and designed a number of educational buildings in Ankara and Trabzon under commissions from the Turkish Ministry of Education. The most significant of these buildings were the Faculty of Languages, History and Geography at Ankara University, Ankara Atatürk High School and Trabzon High School. His last building project, the Cebeci School, was left unfinished. Taut's final work, one month before his death, was the catafalque that was used for the official state funeral of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk on 21 November 1938 in Ankara. It was a simple design, consisting of large wooden columns and a flag that covered the coffin.\n\nTaut died on 24 December 1938 and was laid to rest at the Edirnekapı Martyr's Cemetery in Istanbul as its first and only non-Muslim.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1897526", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1897526", "title": "Paris Pike", "text": "Paris Pike\n\nParis Pike is the local name for the 14 mile (23 km) stretch of U.S. Routes 27/68 between Paris and Lexington, Kentucky.\n\nFor years, this stretch of road had only two side-by-side lanes and no emergency breakdown lane. Given the large amount of auto and farm machinery traffic the road carried, plus the high number of fatalities from vehicular accidents, the Commonwealth of Kentucky Department of Transportation opted to add two more lanes.\n\nIn 1966, discussions were held about how best to widen the road. The original project razed historical structures and would mandate a four-lane divided highway with a uniform grassy median. Local citizens took the Transportation Cabinet to court to stop the plans.\n\nIn 1977, the Bluegrass Land and Nature Trust stepped in to help oppose the plans.\n\nIn 1979, an injunction was issued and the existing plans for widening were scrapped. The court issued a statement in that it wanted more considerate and careful alternatives that would preserve the highway's historic significance. In 1980, the Paris Pike widening project was cancelled. An injunction was issued.\n\nIn 1986, proponents and opponents of the Paris Pike widening project met, agreeing to work together in order to improve the safety and capacity of the deadly road. Fatalities up to that point were increasing every year, claiming, for instance, a family of five in 1985.\n\nIn 1990, Bluegrass Tomorrow created a committee of supporters and opponents of the Paris Pike project with hope that a compromise could be reached on how the roadway should be improved. Unfortunately, later that year the Kentucky Department of Transportation released their Record of Decision, in that the Paris Pike should be improved by widening the highway to four-lanes with a median, almost exactly like the plans in 1966 which were later cancelled.\n\nIn 1991, in order to reach a compromise, a Memorandum of Agreement that was coordinated with the state transportation cabinet, the Federal Highway Administration, the National Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, and the Kentucky State Historic Preservation Office in order to satisfy Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act.\nThe Memorandum of Agreement stated that several activities would need to occur before any design or construction on the Paris Pike would take place.\n\nLater in 1991, the U.S. District Court turned down a request by federal and state officials to lift portions of a 1979 injunction and denied the state transportation cabinet from selecting a design task force. During this time, a proposal by then governor Brereton Jones was derailed as it would have utilized an abandoned railroad corridor to the east of the existing Paris Pike.\n\nIn 1992, the Paris Pike Committee was formed with representatives from Fayette and Bourbon counties and two preservation organizations. This new committee would later set specific guidelines regarding roadway design, land use, and preservation, stating that the new highway could be more beautiful than what currently existed. Later meetings extended those statements with a pact to preserve the land around the highway from development forever.\n\nSeveral of those design specifications called for a four-lane highway with grass shoulders, and where possible, the existing roadway would be used. The highway would flow with the contours of the landscape, and the existing rock walls and entryways would be preserved. Other features that were mentioned included guardrail considerations and landscaping. The final report from the Paris Pike Committee was signed off on in May 1993 and endorsed by all preservation and conservation groups who at one point were at odds over this widening project.\n\nThe injunction was lifted in September 1993. Landscape architect Grant Jones and his Seattle-based firm, working with engineering consultant H. W. Lochner, Inc. of Lexington, designed the new Paris Pike utilizing the criteria set forth by the Paris Pike Committee.\n\nThe widening project began in 1997 and the four-lane divided highway was completed in 2003. The total budget for the project was $69.9 million, however, it was completed at a cost of $93 million or $4.5 million per mile, 1.8 times the cost of a typical four-lane highway in the state.\n\nAs a result of the widening project, the level-of-service along the highway went from an overall grade of 'F' (failing) to 'A' (excellent) and became one of the most scenic byways in the nation. The desire by the designers of the highway, the general public, and the numerous preservation organizations to maintain the historic character of the corridor and to maintain its unique character made the cost extraordinarily high but it was well worth the cost. Dry-laid limestone rock fences were dismantled and reconstructed by hand, for instance, and extensive landscaping and tree planting using native species were utilized. As a result of this careful construction, the Paris Pike project won a 2002 Merit-Design award from the American Society of Landscape Architects as well as the 2003 Federal Highway Administration's Environmental Excellence Award and the National Partnership for Highway Quality 2003 State Award.\n\nA horse named after Paris Pike won the Scottish Grand National Steeplechase in 2001 before falling at the first fence in the famous 2002 Grand National at Aintree, England.\n\n\n"}

They were instrumental in the solidification of the minstrel show into a fixed three-act form. The troupe also invented or popularized \"the line\", the structured grouping that constituted the first act of the standardized three-act minstrel show, with the interlocutor in the middle and \"Mr. Tambo\" and \"Mr. Bones\" on the ends.\n\nIn 1846 they first performed in Polmer's Opera House in New York City. From March 1847, they ran for a seven-year stint at New York City's Mechanics' Hall (until July 1854).\n\nAfter performing at a benefit performance for Stephen Foster in Cincinnati, Ohio, on August 25, 1847, the group specialized in performances of Foster's works. Foster sold his song, \"Old Folks at Home\", to Christy for his exclusive use. The troupe's commercial success was phenomenal: Christy paid Foster for the exclusive rights to the song.\n\nBesides Christy himself, the troupe originally included Christy's stepson George Christy, often considered the greatest blackface comic of the era. When by September 1855 George and Edwin Christy had retired from the group, the company continued under the name of 'Christy's Minstrels', until Edwin Christy took out an injunction to prevent them.\nChristy was emotionally affected by the American Civil War, and committed suicide in 1862.\n\nJ. W. Raynor and Earl Pierce formed a new troupe, using many of the former Christy Minstrel members. It opened in London, England, as \"Raynor & Pierce's Christy Minstrels\" at the St. James's Theatre on 3 August 1857. They then performed at the Surrey Theatre and later the \"Polygraphic Hall\" on King William Street, where they appeared for ten months. \"Nellie Grey\" by Michael Balfe, as sung by Raynor, became popular. In 1859, the troupe moved to the St. James's Hall (Liverpool), performing for another four months and then touring the British provinces. It then returned to Polygraphic Hall, disbanding in August 1860. The success of this troupe led to the phrase \"Christy Minstrels\" coming to mean any blackface minstrel show. Soon, four new companies were formed, each claiming to be the \"original\" Christy Minstrels, because they each boasted one or two former members of the old troupe. One group played in Dublin at the Chester Theatre in 1864, moving to London at the Standard Theatre in Shoreditch in 1865. The Dublin performances were evidently popular enough that James Joyce mentions them in his short story collection \"Dubliners\" and alludes to them on the opening page of \"Finnegans Wake\". Three months later, it moved to St. James's Hall, where it began a run of 35 years until 1904. Eventually, the original members of that troupe retired or died, leaving only \"Pony\" Moore and Frederic Burgess surviving into the 1870s. Therefore, the troupe changed its name to the \"Moore & Burgess's Minstrels\". Other groups continued to use the title \"Christy\", but historian Frank Andrews describes their quality as poor. Some of them continued to perform into the twentieth century.\n\nChristy's novel three-part shows began with a \"walkaround\", the company marching onto the stage singing and dancing. A staple of the walkaround was the cakewalk, which white audiences loved despite not realizing that it originated with plantation slaves imitating their masters' walks. The troupe was then seated in a semicircle, with one member on each end playing the tambourine or the bones. The endmen were named Brother Tambo and Brother Bones, and they engaged in an exchange of jokes between the group's songs and dances. It was customary for Tambo to be slim and Bones to be fat. A character called Mr. Interlocutor sat in the middle of the group, acting as the master of ceremonies. As the interlocutor took his place in the middle of the semicircle he uttered the time-honored phrase: \"Gentlemen, be seated. We will commence with the overture.\" During the performance he conducted himself in a dignified manner that contrasted well with the behavior of the rowdy endmen.\n\nPart two (the \"olio\") was the variety section, a precursor to vaudeville. It included singers, dancers, comedians and other novelty acts, as well as parodies of legitimate theater. A preposterous stump speech served as the highlight of this act, during which a performer spoke in outrageous malapropisms as he lectured. The performer's demeanor was meant to be reminiscent of the hilarious pomposity of Zip Coon; he aspired to great wisdom and intelligence, but his hilarious mangling of language always made him appear foolish and ignorant.\n\nPart three ended the show with a one-act play, typically a vignette of carefree life on the plantation. After Uncle Tom's Cabin was published in 1852 and the play became famous, minstrel shows appropriated the major characters for sketches that changed the abolitionist themes in the original into an argument for the supposedly benign character of slavery.\n\nThe New Christy Minstrels, a folk group from the 1960s, were named with reference to this group, but they did not perform in blackface.\n\n\n"}

Its alignment runs from southeast to northwest and roughly corresponds to part of the once-proposed Outer Beltway around Washington, D.C. The first segment of the roadway opened in 1987; the road was completed in 2010.\n\nThe Franconia–Springfield Parkway (SR 289, formerly SR 7900) is a short east-west spur near the south end of SR 286, leading east through Springfield and serving the Franconia–Springfield Metro station. While SR 286 has access to the main lanes of I-95 (Shirley Highway), SR 289 interchanges with the reversible HOV lanes in the median of I-95.\n\nThe Fairfax County Parkway and its branch to Franconia generally have interchanges at major roads, traffic signals intermediate roads, and right-in/right-out (RIRO) intersections with minor roads and neighborhood streets. Along the main parkway (SR 286), there are 17 full or partial interchanges and 39 signals, with eleven of those signals at interchanges; the Franconia–Springfield Parkway (SR 289) has five interchanges and only three signals. In addition, there are many unsignalized intersections along the road, but none of these are driveways, since the road is limited-access. The road generally has a speed limit of .\n\nThe south end of SR 286 begins at an intersection with US 1 at Accotink and heads northwest through Fort Belvoir, leaving the fort at a diamond interchange with Telegraph Road (SR 611), crossing I-95 at a full cloverleaf (exit 166), crossing over Fullerton Road, passing through interchanges with Boudinot Drive and Barta Road, and turning west through West Springfield at Rolling Road. This portion replaced the existing Backlick Road (SR 617), which continues north from the I-95 interchange and connects to the Franconia–Springfield Parkway (SR 289). During most of the parkway's life, the portion between Fullerton Road and SR 289 had not been constructed due to delay caused by environmental issues, including an oil spill along its path through the Fort Belvoir Proving Ground. Since approval in 2008, construction began in 2009 and the new portion was opened in late 2010.\n\nAfter merging with the Spur, there is in interchange with Hooes and Pohick Roads (SR 636/SR 641). Continuing northwest to the interchange with Ox Road (SR 123), SR 286 is a surface road, built directly on the former Pohick Road. The parkway beyond Ox Road was built on a new alignment, and has a much smaller number of intersections. Just past Ox Road, SR 286 passes under Clara Barton Drive, a minor residential street. It intersects the west end of Burke Center Parkway (SR 643), crosses over the Virginia Railway Express Manassas Line and Fairfax Station Road (SR 660), and intersects several other roads before a freeway section begins at a folded diamond interchange with Braddock Road (SR 620). A complicated three-level diamond takes SR 286 over Lee Highway (US 29) at the south end of West Ox Road (SR 608), and SR 286 crosses I-66 at exit 55, a cloverleaf. After passing over Fair Lakes Circle (SR 7701), there is a diamond interchange with Fair Lakes Parkway (SR 7700) and Monument Drive (SR 7969). The next interchange, at Lee Jackson Memorial Highway (US 50), is a partial cloverleaf with two signals on SR 286.\n\nFrom US 50 to Franklin Farm Road, the parkway curves northwest to reach the Outer Beltway right-of-way. This straight path is followed until Baron Cameron Avenue (SR 606), and includes an overpass at Pinecrest Road in the Fox Mill Estates neighborhood. After crossing the Dulles Access Road (SR 267), SR 286 follows the east border of Herndon, with interchanges at Sunset Hills Road (SR 675) and Baron Cameron Avenue (SR 606). The parkway leaves the straight Outer Beltway alignment just beyond Baron Cameron Avenue, curving northwest and north to end at a diamond interchange with Leesburg Pike (SR 7), at which the traffic signals are on SR 286. Algonkian Parkway continues north as a four-lane local road, eventually curving back west and south to SR 7 just east of SR 28.\nSR 286 is also known as the John F. (Jack) Herrity Parkway, designated by the Virginia General Assembly in 1995, and the Trooper Charles Mark Cosslett Memorial Highway, designated in 2010 as the final link through Fort Belvoir. In 2001, SR 289 was named the Joseph V. Gartlan Jr. Parkway. Jack Herrity served for 12 years on the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors, and was instrumental in getting the road built; Joseph V. Gartlan Jr. was a state senator who served Fairfax County for 28 years. These names are ceremonial, and are rarely used by the public.\n\nThe Fairfax County Parkway Trail is a multi-use trail that runs alongside the Franconia–Springfield Parkway and Fairfax County Parkway from Beulah Street in Springfield to SR 7, mostly as a sidepath, but sometimes using adjacent frontage roads and old alignments of the roads that the parkway replaced. It intersects the Washington and Old Dominion Trail north of Sunset Hills Road at Herndon, near that trail's mile 19. The final section of the trail was opened in 2002.\n\nSR 289 begins at an intersection with Beulah Street (SR 613), with Manchester Boulevard/Kingstowne Boulevard continuing east to Van Dorn Street. The road heads west, with interchanges at the Franconia–Springfield Metro/VRE station, Frontier Drive, the Shirley Highway reversible HOV lanes, and Backlick Road (SR 617). At the Rolling Road (SR 638) interchange, SR 289 ends and merges with SR 286. Rolling Road south of the interchange was rebuilt to carry SR 286, and a large loop ramp is designed for northbound SR 286 traffic. Beyond this interchange, SR 286 has two diamond interchanges, with Sydenstricker Road/Gambrill Road (SR 640) and Pohick Road (SR 641)/Hooes Road (SR 636), before a stretch of several miles with only at-grade intersections. From Backlick Road (SR 617) west to this SR 636 interchange, the parkway paralleled and replaced the existing Hooes Road (SR 636).\n\nThe Outer Beltway was first planned in 1950 as the \"Cross Country Loop\", part of the National Capital Planning Commission's comprehensive plan. In Virginia, by the time of a 1965 plan, it was to run through southern and western Fairfax County, crossing the Potomac River at Mason Neck and north of Great Falls, and passing generally west of State Route 123 (Ox Road) and east of SR 645 (Clifton Road, Stringfellow Road, and Lees Corner Road). The straight part of the Fairfax County Parkway between south of Franklin Farm Road and north of Baron Cameron Avenue is built where the beltway would have been. During the 1970s, attention was focused on the Metrorail system, and environmental concerns temporarily pushed the Outer Beltway onto the back burner. In the 1980s and 1990s, when the plan was revived as the Western Transportation Corridor, the route was shifted further west.\nThe idea for the Springfield Bypass started in the 1970s as a bypass of SR 644 (Old Keene Mill Road) in Springfield. It was soon expanded, by 1978, to include most of what had been planned as the Outer Beltway. The Commonwealth Transportation Board approved final plans on July 16, 1987 for the road, with 16 interchanges and 35 traffic signals between U.S. Route 1 at Fort Belvoir and State Route 7 near Dranesville. A spur to Franconia was included, providing access to the Shirley Highway HOV lanes and the Franconia–Springfield Metrorail station. Except for a short six-lane piece in Reston, the $242 million plan included only four lanes. Since it was a surface road, the highway could incorporate existing roads. This included portions of SR 617 (Backlick Road), SR 636 (Hooes Road), SR 641 (Pohick Road), and SR 680 (Stuart Road).\n\nFifty-five homes and five businesses had to be taken by eminent domain to build the road. Included in these 55 homes were five at the brand-new Innisfree subdivision in Springfield. Only months after families moved into the houses, located between SR 636 (Hooes Road) and the proposed highway, they were informed that their land would be needed for the interchange at SR 640 (Sydenstricker Road). Originally planned as an at-grade intersection, projections of increased traffic led to a redesign that required more right-of-way.\n\nThe Fairfax County Board of Supervisors changed the name to the Fairfax County Parkway on June 23, 1988, noting that it traveled far from Springfield. The Franconia Spur was not renamed to the suggested Springfield Parkway at that time, to give time to find a single name for the entire spur, already known as Kingstowne Boulevard at its east end. By the next year, the permanent Franconia–Springfield Parkway name had been applied to the portion west of State Route 613 (Beulah Street); the rest of the road was not built as part of the project, and now carries the Manchester Boulevard and Kingstowne Boulevard names.\n\nThree bond issues were approved by Fairfax County voters to pay for construction of the highway, as well as other roads in the county: $135 million in November 1985, $150 million in April 1988, and $130 million in November 1992. The first portions of the road to open were financed by developers building in the area: the Cavalier Land Development Corporation from a new interchange on Interstate 66 north to U.S. Route 50, and the Hazel/Peterson Companies from Stringfellow Road north to Franklin Farm Road, both completed in 1987. On October 24, 1989, the gap from US 50 to Stringfellow Road was filled, and the road was extended from Franklin Farm Road north to West Ox Road (SR 608). It was further extended north to a new interchange on the Dulles Toll Road (SR 267) on October 22, 1991, and north to Sunset Hills Road (SR 675) on July 7, 1993.\n\n\nThe first piece of the Franconia–Springfield Parkway, a short bypass of Hooes Road (SR 636) from Rolling Road (SR 638) east over Accotink Creek to near Lackawanna Drive, opened on August 7, 1989. The rest of this spur to Beulah Street (SR 613) in Franconia opened on June 8, 1992, along with the reversible HOV ramps to the Shirley Highway (I-95/I-395). (The Franconia–Springfield station did not open for Virginia Railway Express and Metrorail trains until four and five years later, respectively; the interchange at Frontier Drive serving the station opened in December 1995).\n\nThe next pieces of the road to open were in the southwest, with an upgrade and bypass of Hooes Road (SR 636) from Pohick Road (SR 641) east to Rolling Road (SR 638) and the Franconia–Springfield Parkway opening by November 1993. The highway from Ox Road (SR 123) north to Braddock Road (SR 620) opened on July 28, 1995, and was connected to the existing portion at I-66 on September 19. Two interchanges along this portion and the older one to the north – at US 50 and at US 29 – opened on December 14 and December 20 respectively. From SR 123 southeast to the beginning of the Franconia–Springfield Parkway, existing two-lane roads were widened, opening the road from SR 123 east to Lee Chapel Road (SR 643) by May 1996 and to Pohick Road (SR 641) on July 2, 1996, completing the road from Springfield to Herndon. However, until a new bridge opened in early September 2002, traffic on Pohick Road northbound (just east of Hooes Road) was required to turn right onto the parkway.\n\nThe southernmost portion, from US 1 north across I-95 to Fullerton Road, mostly an upgrade of Backlick Road (SR 617), opened south of Telegraph Road (SR 611) by July 1997 and north of Telegraph Road later that year. The first part north of Sunset Hills Road (SR 675), a short piece from the new interchange with SR 7 south to Sugarland Road (SR 604), opened by June 1999. The parkway was extended south from Sugarland Road to Wiehle Avenue (SR 828) on November 1, 2000. The road was extended to Walnut Branch with two lanes extended to Baron Cameron Avenue (SR 606) on December 21, 2000. The gap between Walnut Branch and Sunset Hills was filled on November 5, 2001, finally completing the parkway north of Springfield.\n\nConstruction has been delayed many times on the last segment, between Fullerton Road (just north of I-95) and Rolling Road (SR 638), which will allow traffic on the main part of the parkway to connect directly to the I-95 main lanes. Plans were made here in the late 1980s, and it was to be paid for by a developer who was to build a development on land bought from the U.S. Army's Fort Belvoir. But those plans fell through, and traffic growth necessitated a redesign. Plans were again postponed in the early 2000s due to necessary environmental cleanup of that part of Fort Belvoir, which included unexploded ordnance. The Environmental Protection Agency discovered in 2005 that an oil spill on the property had not been properly cleaned. , the project had been designed as a full freeway but was placed on hold. As of September 2010, this portion of the parkway opened for traffic, closing the gap that once existed.\n\nPlans have been made for an interchange at Fair Lakes Parkway, just north of I-66. This project will be funded with American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 funds. This project was certified on August 10, 2009, and the construction contract is expected to be let August 2010. Furthermore, improvements are being made to the West Ox Road and Sunrise Valley Drive intersections with the parkway along with interchanges with the new portion of the parkway between Fullerton Road and Rolling Road at Boudinot Drive. Additions and improvements to the I-95 interchange with Fairfax County Parkway are currently under development as well.\n\nOn February 16, 2012, the Fairfax County Parkway was designated SR 286 and the Franconia–Springfield Parkway was designated SR 289. In June 2012, signage was updated to reflect the new designation with a mix of SR 286 and \"old SR 7100\" signs and reassurance markers.\n\n\n"}

Erlanger\n\nAbraham Lincoln Erlanger (May 4, 1859 – March 7, 1930) was an American theatrical producer, director, designer, theatre owner, and a leading figure of the Theatrical Syndicate.\n\nErlanger was born to a Jewish family in Buffalo, New York. Erlanger and his partner, Kentucky lawyer Marc Klaw, started out as a theatrical booking agency in New York City in 1888. Immensely successful, together they built a large chain of theatres and vaudeville playhouses. In 1896 they joined with theatre operators Al Hayman, Charles Frohman, Samuel F. Nixon, and Fred Zimmerman to form the Theatrical Syndicate. Their organization, known as \"Klaw & Erlanger\", established systemized booking networks throughout the United States and created a monopoly that controlled every aspect of contracts and bookings until the late 1910s when the Shubert brothers broke their hold on the industry.\nThe operations of Klaw & Erlanger produced dozens of Broadway shows during the first three decades of the 20th century, including \"Dracula\", \"Ben-Hur\", and \"The Jazz Singer\". They produced the first \"Ziegfeld Follies\" in 1907 at the rooftop \"Jardin de Paris\" in New York City. They also built several of Broadway's most outstanding theaters such as the art nouveau New Amsterdam Theatre in 1903 and in 1927 Erlanger's Theatre (renamed the St. James) plus the new Erlanger Theatre in Philadelphia. Also in 1927, he leased a newly built theatre in Buffalo, New York and applied the Erlanger name to it. In addition to playhouses, he and his partner owned the \"Klaw & Erlanger Opera Company\" and \"Klaw and Erlanger's Costume Company.\"\n\nErlanger's cold disdain and ruthless tactics helped bring about his own downfall. He made a bitter enemy of the Shubert brothers after Sam Shubert died in a train wreck in 1905, when he is said to have refused to abide by any legal agreements \"with a dead man.\" The enraged Shubert brothers Lee and Jacob began an all out campaign to wrestle power in the industry away from the Theatrical Syndicate. In 1910, he drew the ire of New York mayor William Jay Gaynor when one of his theaters hosted \"The Girl with the Whooping Cough\", a risque farce that the mayor condemned as indecent. In 1919, after he dismissed out of hand the demands of the Actors' Equity Association, the labor union launched a strike that eventually shut down all the theatres in New York City, Chicago, and Boston. In the end, Erlanger suffered large financial losses and had no choice but to accede to union demands.\n\nThe strike spelled the demise of his once powerful organization and the partnership of Klaw & Erlanger produced their last Broadway show in 1919 (\"The Velvet Lady\"). Erlanger continued to produce on Broadway. He died on March 7, 1930. He is interred at Beth El Cemetery in Ridgewood, New York.\n\nAccording to Groucho Marx, when Erlanger approached Gen. Lew Wallace about acquiring the stage rights to his epic novel , Wallace asked him fiercely, \"Do you believe in our lord, Jesus Christ?\" Erlanger responded, \"Frankly, I don't. My partner Klaw does—but \"he's\" up in Boston!\"\n\nTheaters controlled by Erlanger include:\n\n"}

It was the first single and music video from their third full-length album, \"Lateralus\". In 2002, Tool won the Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance for the song. \"Schism\" was released as a DVD single on December 20, 2005. The DVD contains the music video, audio commentary by David Yow, and a remix by Lustmord.\n\nMost of the songs on \"Lateralus\" use math and science as metaphors for human issues. Singer Maynard James Keenan says, \"They're all about relationships. Learning how to integrate communication back into a relationship. How are we as lovers, as artists, as brothers - how are we going to reconstruct this beautiful temple that we've built and that's tumbled down? It's universal relationship stuff.\" As for the trademark hook, bassist Justin Chancellor said, \"The twiddly 'Schism' riff came from fooling around. I just play as much as possible, and I don't write stuff down - so when I get a good idea, I play it until I can't forget it.\"\n\n\"Schism\" is known as a prime example of Tool's use of complex rhythms and changing meters. It is also well known for its distinctive bass line throughout. An extended version of the song is performed live. \"Schism\" was Tool's only entry on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 until \"Fear Inoculum\" in 2019, peaking at number 67 and staying on the charts for 20 weeks. It also hit number two on both the Alternative Songs and Mainstream Rock Tracks charts. It almost reached number one on both charts, but was blocked behind Staind's \"It's Been Awhile\".\n\nThe song is featured in the video game \"Guitar Hero World Tour\".\n\n\"Schism\" is renowned for its use of uncommon time signatures and the frequency of its meter changes. In one analysis of the song, the song alters meter 47 times.

These included the Monster Jam monster truck series as well as motocross, quad racing and others. Having passed through multiple owners, the rights to the group are now owned by Feld Entertainment, which continues to operate the Monster Jam series.\n\nThe USHRA was founded as \"Truck-O-Rama\" in the late 1970s by Bob George, Ed Thayer, and Tony Vaccaro. By the early 1980s, the company became known as SRO Motorsports, and began promoting events under the USHRA banner. The early events focused on tractor pulling and mud bogging, and were primarily held in stadiums and arenas. Often, specialty vehicles were booked for events as intermission entertainment between competitions. In 1982, one such vehicle, Bob Chandler's Bigfoot, was booked for an event at the Pontiac Silverdome. It was that event, during which Bigfoot drove over a pair of cars in its first stadium car crush, that launched the phenomenon of monster trucks.\n\nIn 1985, USHRA held their first monster truck racing event, The Battle of the Monster Trucks, at the Louisiana Superdome. Up to this point, monster trucks had only performed freestyle exhibitions, and although for several years exhibitions would be a part of smaller arena shows, racing became used in all events by the early 1990s.\n\nAlthough monster trucks grew in popularity throughout the 1980s, tractor pulling and mud bogging (subsequently known as \"mud racing\") remained marquee events. Popular pullers included Art Arfons, who competed with the \"Green Monster\" unlimited tractor, David Willoughby, who pulled with his reputable \"Back in Time\" modified four-wheel-drive truck, Kenneth and Paula Geuin's Black Gold and Oklahoman four-wheel-drive trucks, Allen Gaines, who had an entire fleet of \"Orange Blossom Special\" truck pullers, and Gary Collins and his \"Budweiser Boss\" semi-truck. In mud racing, Tom Martin's \"Mud Patrol\" and \"Super Trooper\" police-themed vehicles dominated for several years, while a young Tom Meents began his rise to fame in the \"Shake Me\" machine. \n\nIn 1991, the parent company, now known as SRO/Pace, bought out competitor TNT Motorsports, and in the process acquired the rights to promote events at several more venues, as well as the booking rights to several of their best known trucks, including Carolina Crusher, Equalizer, and, most notably, Grave Digger. These trucks all competed in the \"Camel Mud & Monster Series\", which ran from 1990 to 1994. By the end of the Camel series, monster trucks were the headlining competitors.\n\nIn 1993, USHRA produced the syndicated television show \"Monster Wars\", which was controversial for its implementation of professional wrestling style characters representing the monster trucks. This was also the year that some events began to be promoted with the name \"Monster Jam\", which would become the official series name in 1995. \n1998 saw competitor USA Motorsports bought out by USHRA's parent, now known as Pace Motorsports, which led to Monster Jam events being shown on TNN's Motor Madness television show.\n\nIn 1998, Pace was bought by SFX Entertainment, which was bought in turn by Clear Channel in 2000. The live events division of Clear Channel was split off as Live Nation in 2005, and the motorsports division was sold to Feld Entertainment in 2008. Under Feld ownership, all events except Monster Jam and the AMA Supercross Championship, which is sanctioned by the American Motorcyclist Association, have been discontinued, and the USHRA name has largely been phased out in favor of the better known Monster Jam name.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1897554", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1897554", "title": "Fraser Canyon", "text": "Fraser Canyon\n\nThe Fraser Canyon is a major landform of the Fraser River where it descends rapidly through narrow rock gorges in the Coast Mountains en route from the Interior Plateau of British Columbia to the Fraser Valley. Colloquially, the term \"Fraser Canyon\" is often used to include the Thompson Canyon from Lytton to Ashcroft, since they form the same highway route which most people are familiar with, although it is actually reckoned to begin above Williams Lake, British Columbia at Soda Creek Canyon near the town of the same name.\n\nThe canyon was formed during the Miocene period (23.7–5.3 million years ago) by the river cutting into the uplifting Interior Plateau. From the northern Cariboo to Fountain, the river follows the line of the huge Fraser Fault, which runs on a north-south axis and meets the Yalakom Fault a few miles downstream from Lillooet. Exposures of lava flows are present in cliffs along the Fraser Canyon. They represent volcanic activity in the southern Chilcotin Group during the Pliocene period and the volcanic vents of their origins have not been discovered.\n\nThe canyon extends north of Yale to the confluence of the Chilcotin River. Its southern stretch is a major transportation corridor to the Interior from \"the Coast\", with the Canadian National and Canadian Pacific Railways and the Trans-Canada Highway carved out of its rock faces, with many of the canyon's side-crevasses spanned by bridges and trestles. Prior to the double-tracking of those railways and major upgrades to Highway 1 (the Trans Canada Highway), travel through the canyon was even more precarious than it is now. During the frontier era it was a major obstacle between the Lower Mainland and the Interior Plateau, and the slender trails along its rocky walls - many of them little better than notches cut into granite, with a few handholds - were compared to goat-tracks.\n\nNorth of Lytton, it is followed by BC Highway 12, then from Lillooet to Pavilion by BC Hwy 99 (the farther end of the Sea-to-Sky Highway, though not carrying that name in this area). The British Columbia Railway (the BC Railway is now owned and operated by the CN) line follows the same stretch of canyon from Lillooet to just beyond Pavilion. Between there and the mouth of the Chilcotin River there are only rough ranching roads, and the terrain is a mix of canyon depths flanked by arid benchland and high plateau. Between Pavilion and Lillooet, the river's gorge is at its maximum depth, with the river throttled through a series of narrow gorges flanked by high cliffs, though still flanked above those cliffs by wide benchlands which stand on the foreshoulder of the mountain ranges flanking the gorge.\n\nAt Hells Gate, near Boston Bar, the canyon walls rise about above the rapids. Fish ladders along the river's side permit migrating salmon to bypass a rockslide that diverted the river during the blasting of the Canadian Northern Railway line in 1913. The area around Hell's Gate carries the name Black Canyon, which may either be a reference to the colour of the rocks when it rains, or the name of a community built on the cliffsides here during the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush. At the site that once housed railway workers, a tourist attraction built in 1971 takes visitors across Hell's Gate via an aerial tramway. \n\nAt Siska, a few minutes south of Lytton, there are the Cisco bridges—a pair of railway bridges at the throat of a rocky gorge. From south to north, the Canadian Pacific has been on the west side of the canyon, while the Canadian National has been on the east side. At Siska, the two railways switch sides: the CP— truss bridge—crosses to the east, the CN—on a steel-arched bridge over the CP—is now on the west. The two railways now have an agreement to allow directional running through the canyon as far as Basque. All eastbound trains—CN, CP, and Via Rail's eastbound \"Canadian\"—run on the CP line. All westbound trains—CN, CP, Via Rail's westbound \"Canadian\"—use the CN tracks.\n\nJust north of Lillooet, narrow rock ledges choke the river just at the confluence of the lower canyon of the Bridge River, forming an obstacle to migrating fish that has made this spot the busiest aboriginal fishing site on the river, from ancient times to the present. Concentrations of First Nations people here, from all tribes of the Interior, were believed to have been in excess of 10,000.\n\nMany stretches of the Fraser are named in their own right, starting with the Little Canyon between Yale and Spuzzum, which is officially the lowest reach of the Fraser Canyon (although in regional terms Hope, farther south, is considered a canyon town and to be the southern outlet of the canyon because the highway became more difficult from that point; the river is navigable to Yale). Between the Spuzzum and Boston Bar was known in the gold rush as the Big Canyon or Black Canyon; there are several named subcanyons of the Big Canyon, most famously Hells Gate Canyon (in some descriptions the Black Canyon is below Hell's Gate). Above the Big Canyon there are the Lillooet Canyon, Fountain Canyon, Glen Fraser Canyon, Moran Canyon, High Bar Canyon, French Bar Canyon and more all the way up to Soda Creek Canyon near Quesnel. Upstream from there the river flows in wider country, but in the Robson Valley between Prince George and Tête Jaune Cache, the river enters the Grand Canyon of the Fraser. The Black Canyon was the site of a shantytown of the same name, much of which was on catwalks on the ramparts of its dark-rock cliffs.\n\nNearly all tributaries of the Fraser have canyons of varying scale; the few exceptions include the Pitt and the Chilliwack in the Lower Fraser Valley. The Thompson Canyon, from Lytton to Ashcroft, is a sequence of large canyons of its own, some of them also named, although most British Columbians and travellers think of it as part of the Fraser Canyon. Other important canyons on tributaries include Coquihalla Canyon, the Bridge River Canyon, Seton Canyon and adjacent Cayoosh Canyon, Pavilion Canyon, Vermilion Canyon (Slok Creek) and Churn Creek Canyon. The Chilcotin River also has several subcanyons, as does the Chilko River, notably Lava Canyon and another Black Canyon.\n\nThere are other canyons on the Fraser that are not considered part of the canyon, notably at Soda Creek, between Williams Lake and Prince George. The official but comparatively diminutive Grand Canyon of the Fraser is in the river's upper stretch through the Rocky Mountain Trench, about 115 km (71 mi) upstream from Prince George and about 20 km (12 mi) upstream from the Fraser's confluence with the Bowron River. Despite its name, the Grand Canyon of the Fraser is only one treacherous switchback rapid in a shallow rock gorge, and it has neither the roughness of water nor the depth and severity of canyon as is found in the area south from Big Bar to Lillooet or between Boston Bar and Yale.\n\nAlmost all of the rivers and creeks feeding the Fraser from Williams Lake south have their own canyons which open onto the Fraser, or are just up side-valleys a few miles. These include Marble Canyon, Churn Creek, the Chilcotin River, the Bridge River, Seton Lake and Cayoosh Creek, the Stein River, the Nahatlatch River, the Coquihalla River and the innumerable smaller creeks flanking the river between Kanaka Bar and Yale.\n\nThe Canadian Pacific Railway has at least 30 tunnels in its Yale to Lytton section with one up to half a mile in length.\nThe Fraser Canyon Highway Tunnels were constructed from the spring of 1957 to 1964 as part of the Trans-Canada Highway project. There are seven tunnels in total, the shortest being about ; the longest, however, is about and is one of North America's longest. They are situated between Yale and Boston Bar.\n\nIn order from south to north, they are: Yale (completed 1963), Saddle Rock (1958), Sailor Bar (1959), Alexandra (1964), Hell's Gate (1960), Ferrabee (1964) and China Bar (1961). The Hell's Gate tunnel is the only tunnel that does not have lights, while the China Bar tunnel is the only tunnel that requires ventilation.\n\nThe China Bar and Alexandra tunnels have warning lights that are activated by cyclists before they enter the tunnels. This was required because the tunnels are curved. It is expected that the Ferrabee tunnel will get the same warning lights as it too is curved.\n\nAt the mouth of the Canyon, an archeological site documents the presence of the people in the area from the early Holocene period, 8,000 to 10,000 years ago after the retreat of the Fraser Glacier. Research farther upriver at the Keatley Creek Archaeological Site, near Pavilion, is dated to 8000 BP, when a huge lake filled what is now the canyon above Lillooet, created by a slide a few miles south of the present-day town.\n\nDuring the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush of 1858–1860, 10,500 miners and an untold number of hangers-on populated its banks and towns. The Fraser Canyon War and the series of events known as McGowan's War occurred during the gold rush. Other important histories connected with the Canyon include the building of the Cariboo Wagon Road and the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway.\n\nThe river is navigable between Boston Bar and Lillooet and also between Big Bar Ferry and Prince George and beyond, although rapids at Soda Canyon and elsewhere were still difficult waters for the many steamboats which piloted the river in the 19th and early 20th centuries. The first sternwheeler to pass the rapids was \"Skuzzy\", which was built with a multiple-compartment hull to preserve her from sinking from rock damage. She was used to haul equipment and supplies during the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway, beginning in the 1880s.\n\nWith the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway in the 1880s came the destruction of key portions of the Cariboo Wagon Road, as there was no room for both railway and road on the narrow, steep mountainsides above the river. As a result, the towns of Lytton and Boston Bar were cut off from road access with the rest of the province, other than by the difficult wagon road to Lillooet via Fountain. During the automotive age and following the construction of the Canadian Northern Railway in 1904–05, a newer version of the road was built through the canyon. The Fraser Canyon Highway was surveyed in 1920 and constructed in 1924–25 with a through-route available after the completion of the (second) Alexandra Suspension Bridge in 1926. This was known as the Cariboo Highway and Highway 1 until the construction and designation of the Trans-Canada Highway (circa-1962).\n\n\n\n\n"}

In 1961, the \"Journal\" was purchased by S.I. Newhouse and Advance Publications, owners also of \"The Oregonian\", the city's morning newspaper.\n\nThe Portland \"Evening Journal\" was first published on March 10, 1902. This newspaper began as a campaign paper owned by A. D. Bowen, with William Wasson as the first editor. However, within a few months the paper had floundered and was being liquidated. In July 1902, the \"Evening Journal\", was taken over by C.S. \"Sam\" Jackson, who had been the publisher of the \"East Oregonian\" based in Pendleton. Jackson renamed the paper \"The Oregon Daily Journal\". In his first editorial as publisher of the \"Journal\", on July 23, 1902, Jackson declared:\n\n\"The \"Journal\" in head and heart will stand for the people, be truly Democratic and free from political entanglements and machinations, believing in the principles that promise the greatest good to the greatest number – to ALL MEN, regardless of race, creed or previous condition of servitude... It shall be a FAIR newspaper and not a dull and selfish sheet – [and] a credit to 'Where rolls the Oregon' country.\"\n\nSam Jackson served as the \"Journal's\" editor and publisher for 22 years, from July 1902 until his death in 1924. He was succeeded by his son, Philip L. Jackson, who, following his father's footsteps, ran the newspaper for 29 years, expanding into broadcasting.\n\nUnder the Jacksons' leadership, the \"Journal\" competed with the state's major newspaper, \"The Oregonian\", also based in Portland, with the \"Journal\" touting itself as the \"strong voice of the Oregon Country.\" The paper was involved in a number of early 20th century crusades for reform, including better control of Oregon timberlands, adoption of the initiative, referendum and recall laws, direct election of U.S. senators, pure milk, and dredging of the Columbia River navigation channel to allow development of Portland as a major world port.\n\nThe \"Journal\" ventured into radio, purchasing KOIN radio (AM 970). In 1932, the \"Journal\" purchased its second station, KALE. In 1946 KOIN was sold to Field Enterprises,\n\nIn 1947, the \"Journal\" became the first newspaper in the country to employ a helicopter on a regular basis to gather news photographs.\n\nOn June 6, 1948, KALE became KPOJ, standing for, Portland Oregon Journal. Also on this date KPOJ-FM was launched.\n\nThe \"Journal\"'s circulation peaked in 1948, with daily sales of 201,421 and Sunday circulation of 217,808.\n\nIn 1953, Philip Jackson died from a heart disease. William W. Knight, who had been the paper's legal counsel, was brought in as its new publisher. C.S. Jackson's widow, Maria Clopton Jackson, died just a few years later, in 1956. With the successive deaths of C.S. Jackson II, Philip Jackson, and Maria Jackson, no family heirs were left to oversee the business and its operations. In this era, afternoon newspapers began their decline due to the rise of television, changing commuting patterns and other forces. The paper's economic vitality was further sapped by a lengthy strike against both Portland newspapers that began in November 1959. The newspapers published a joint strike edition, but while separate publication of the \"Journal\" resumed in 1960, its circulation never approached pre-strike levels.\n\nAlthough the will of C.S. Jackson's widow, Maria Clopton Jackson, had specified that the newspaper's stock should be transferred to its employees upon her death, the trustees of her estate challenged that decision in court. Eventually, the courts ruled that the provision was written in wishful, not binding language.\n\nIn 1961 the trustees, believing that losses from the strike could bankrupt the paper and deprive the foundation of much of its principal, sold the \"Journal\" to \"The Oregonian's\" publisher, S. I. Newhouse, for $8 million. This amount was twice the bid made by an Oregon group. Newhouse had acquired \"The Oregonian,\" Portland's morning daily, in 1950. Newhouse consolidated production and business operations of the two newspapers in \"The Oregonian's\" building while keeping their editorial staffs separate. As a result of the Newhouse acquisition, publication of the \"Journal\"'s Sunday edition was discontinued. The company's radio stations were sold in 1961 to make way for the \"Journal's\" sale.\n\nThe \"Journal\" never recovered the readership lost in the 1959 strike. Its circulation steadily declined through the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nWilliam Knight continued as publisher, retiring in 1971. Other key creative forces in the paper's final decades included Editor Donald J. Sterling Jr., columnists Dick Fagan (creator of Mill Ends Park, the world's smallest park) and Doug Baker, Sports Editor George Pasero and prize-winning photographer David Hume Kennerly.\n\nUnder the terms of sale of the \"Journal\" by The Jackson Foundation, the newspaper was to remain under \"independent editors until 1981\". In 1982 the \"Journal\" was shut down due to declining circulation and advertising revenues. Most of its reporters and many of its features were moved into a revamped \"Oregonian\". The final edition of \"The Oregon Journal\" was published on September 4, 1982.\n\n\nThe \"Journal\" was published at four downtown Portland locations during its 80-year history. From 1902 to 1912, it was headquartered in the Goodnough Building at Fifth and Yamhill Streets. In 1912, the newspaper moved to a 12-story building it had constructed at Southwest Broadway and Yamhill Streets. (The building, now known as Jackson Tower, has been on the National Register of Historic Places since 1996.) The paper had outgrown that structure by the 1940s, and in 1948, the Journal moved to a three-block-long structure on SW Front Avenue that had originally been constructed in 1933 as the Portland Public Market. That building was the paper's home until the Newhouse acquisition in 1961. It was torn down in 1969 and is now the site of Tom McCall Waterfront Park.\n\nArchives of the \"Journal\" are maintained by \"The Oregonian\".\n\nThe firm's legacy lives on in the airwaves, as well: KOIN today is KUFO; FM 101.1 is now KXL-FM; KALE is KKPZ; and KPOJ-FM is KUPL.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1897561", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1897561", "title": "Classical fencing", "text": "Classical fencing\n\nClassical fencing is the style of fencing as it existed during the 19th and early 20th century. According to the 19th-century fencing master Louis Rondelle,\n\nA classical fencer is supposed to be one who observes a fine position, whose attacks are fully developed, whose hits are marvelously accurate, his parries firm and his ripostes executed with precision. One must not forget that this regularity is not possible unless the adversary is a party to it. It is a conventional bout, which consists of parries, attacks, and returns, all rhyming together.\n\nUsed in this sense, classical fencing is a style of historical fencing focusing on the 19th- and early 20th-century national fencing schools, especially in Italy and France, \"i.e\". the schools out of which the styles of contemporary sports fencing have developed. Masters and legendary fencing figures such as Giuseppe Radaelli, Louis Rondelle, Masaniello Parise, the Greco brothers, Aldo Nadi and his rival Lucien Gaudin are today considered typical practitioners of this period.\nClassical fencing weapons included the standard foil, épée (using pointes d'arret), and sabre (including both blunted dueling sabres and, beginning in the early 20th century, modern sporting sabres).\n\nDuring the classical period, fencing was used both for sport and preparation for the duel. Fencing as a sport was one of the original events in the Olympic Games and widely practiced at schools and domestic competitions. Additionally, there were professional fencers competing for prize money. Fencing tournaments were extremely popular events, with spectators flocking to see the most celebrated swordsmen battle it out on the piste. In many cases, fencers of the period trained for sport fencing the same way they trained for duels—indeed, many fought highly celebrated duels.\n\nDueling went into sharp decline after World War I, following the wartime deaths of many members of the classes that practiced it, and the social changes following the war's mass carnage. After World War II, dueling went out of use in Europe except for rare exceptions. Training for a duel, once almost mandatory for males of aristocratic backgrounds, all but disappeared, along with the classes themselves. Fencing continued as a sport like boxing or karate, with tournaments and championships. However, the need to prepare for a duel with \"sharps\" all but vanished.\n\nScoring was done by means of four judges who determined if a hit was made. Two side judges stood behind and to the side of each fencer, and watched for hits made by that fencer on the opponent's target. A director followed the fencing from a point several feet away from the center of the action. At the end of each action, after calling \"Halt!\", the director (or, formally, the president of the jury) would describe the action (\"Attack is from my left. Parry and riposte from my right.\"), and then poll the judges in turn (\"Does the attack land?\"). The judges would answer \"Yes\", \"Yes, but off-target\", \"No\", or \"Abstain\". If the judges differed or abstained, the director could overrule them with his vote.\n\nThis method was universally used, but had limitations. As described in an article in the London newspaper, \"The Daily Courier\", on June 25, 1896: \"Every one who has watched a bout with the foils knows that the task of judging the hits is with a pair of amateurs difficult enough, and with a well-matched pair of maîtres d’escrime well-nigh impossible.\" There also were problems with bias: well-known fencers were often given the benefit of mistakes (so-called \"reputation touches\"), and in some cases there was outright cheating. Aldo Nadi complained about this in his autobiography \"The Living Sword\" in regard to his famous match with Lucien Gaudin.\n\nThe article in the \"Daily Courier\" described a new invention, the electrical scoring machine, that would revolutionize fencing. Starting with épée in the 1930s (foil was electrified in 1950s, sabre in 1980s), side judges were replaced by an electrical scoring apparatus, with an audible tone and a red or green light indicating when a touch landed. The scoring box reduced the bias in judging, and permitted more accurate scoring of faster actions, lighter touches, and more touches to the back and flank than were possible with human judges.\n\nThe advent of the electrical scoring apparatus had far-reaching consequences. The electrical scoring apparatus and the 20th century's overall modernization of athletic activities occurred alongside an increase in the emphasis on fencing as a sport. The electrical scoring apparatus encouraged an emphasis on the athletic and offensive (rather than defensive) aspects of fencing by altering the ways in which a touch would be considered valid. The result was an eventual schism between sport and classical fencing, both stylistically and philosophically.\n\nAt the time electronic scoring was introduced, all fencers were classically trained, but there were differences in accepting 20th-century changes in fencing practice. The fencing masters who rejected these changes either preserved their tradition, abandoned it in favor of employment as fencing masters in sport fencing, or, as time passed, simply retired. However, enough classically oriented fencers remained to keep traditional, classical fencing alive. \nMany people self-identify as classical fencers, but do not share the concept of classical fencing described in this article, preferring the early to mid-20th-century style of competitive fencing (which, in the United States, was formalized and governed by the American Fencing League, or AFL) to the more classical style of the 19th century. This should not be confused with the Amateur Fencers League of America (AFLA), which was renamed to the current United States Fencing Association (USFA) in 1981, which is affiliated with the FIE.\n\nIn the United States (and elsewhere), renewed interest in Western martial arts (beginning in the 1990s) has led some groups—often peer-led—to attempt to study classical fencing (e.g. from books or instructional videos) without the guidance of a classically trained instructor, creating further variation in the classical fencing community. These groups, in an effort to become more historically authentic, sometimes shift their focus to older, pre-19th-century weapons and techniques—i.e. historical fencing.\n\nToday, classical fencing clubs (and classical fencing instructors and masters) can be found in Europe, the United States, Canada, and Australia. Because there is no agreement as to the exact rules of classical fencing and because competition is de-emphasized, what competitions exist are generally local or regional in nature, with the rules depending upon where the tournament is held.\n\nHowever, there are a number of generalizations that unify contemporary classical fencing.\n\nFirst of these is the expression that \"classical fencing is a frank encounter between two opponents\" where the object is to touch the other fencer without being touched. Even though the \"weapons\" are blunt, the fencers treat them as though they were in fact sharp.\n\nClassical fencing still uses the same weapons that have been used in fencing since the early 19th century—namely, the standard (non-electric) foil, standard épée (equipped with a pointe d'arret), and sabre (including both blunted dueling sabres and modern standard sporting sabres).\n\nOlympic and classical fencing differ in the use of weapon grips for foil and épée. In sport fencing, the most used handle for foil and épée is the pistol grip, with the French retaining significant use in épée. Classical fencing prohibits the pistol grip, and uses the Italian and French grips primarily, and occasionally the Spanish grip.\n\nSafety equipment for classical fencing is essentially the same as used in Olympic fencing. It includes:\n\nFencers also usually wear breeches of material similar to the jacket, with knee-high white socks, or long pants and athletic shoes. There should be no exposed flesh.\n\nIn addition, female fencers wear rigid breast protection in the form of cups or a chestplate (as do some male fencers, albeit a flat chestplate in that case). Male fencers often wear an athletic cup. Fencers of both genders wear an underarm protector called a plastron worn on the side of the fencer facing the opponent. This provides additional protection in the event of a broken blade penetrating the fencing jacket.\n\n\n"}

He is best known for his appearances with the American Wrestling Association and World Class Championship Wrestling in the 1980s as Nord the Barbarian and Yukon John and with the World Wrestling Federation, All Japan Pro Wrestling and World Championship Wrestling in the 1990s as The Berzerker and under his birth name.\n\nNord was trained to wrestle by Eddie Sharkey. He debuted in late 1984 under the ring name \"The Barbarian\" for Mid-South Wrestling, where he was managed by Skandor Akbar.\n\nIn 1985, the AWA originally promoted him as a member of the New Jersey Generals of the United States Football League.\n\nIn 1986, he became Nord the Barbarian and wrestled in singles and tag team matches (under manager Sheik Adnan El-Kaissey) in the American Wrestling Association. Here, he frequently teamed with Bruiser Brody. The two faced Greg Gagne and Jimmy Snuka as part of a triple main event at WrestleRock 86.\n\nNord then went to World Class Championship Wrestling in 1987. As Nord The Barbarian he was (managed by Gary Hart), where he feuded with Kevin Von Erich over the WCWA World Heavyweight Championship. He challenged Von Erich for the title at the fourth annual David Von Erich Memorial Parade of Champions at Texas Stadium in 1987.\n\nIn 1989, he returned to the AWA under the name Yukon John (a lumberjack gimmick where he would come to the ring with an ax, dressed in blue jeans, flannel shirt, animal skin hat and boots). He mainly competed in singles matches, until forming a tag team in 1990 with Scott Norton, called The Yukon Lumberjacks. They briefly feuded with The Texas Hangmen.\n\nAfter the American Wrestling Association closed in 1991, Nord joined Pacific Northwest Wrestling as \"Nord the Barbarian\". He formed a tag team with The Grappler called \"The Breakfast Club\". After winning matches, Nord and The Grappler would humiliate their opponents by pouring Cheerios and milk on them.\n\nIn 1991, Nord joined the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) as The Viking. He soon became The Berzerker (managed by Mr. Fuji) and feuded with Davey Boy Smith and Jimmy Snuka. His preferred method of winning matches was by throwing his opponents over the top rope for a countout, all the while holding his wrist, licking his hand, shouting \"Huss! Huss!\", and falling flat on his back. He was using the gimmick of his deceased former partner King Kong/Bruiser Brody. He wrestled as part of a four-man team in an elimination match at the 1991 \"Survivor Series\" pay-per-view event. He was the last man eliminated for his team. He then feuded with The Undertaker, at one point attempting to stab him with his sword. He wrestled in the \"1992 Royal Rumble.\" In July 1992, he won a 40-man Battle Royal on \"WWF Prime Time Wrestling\", and challenged Bret Hart for the WWF Championship that November. Nord's final appearance was as a participant in a battle royal on the February 1, 1993 edition of \"Monday Night Raw\".\n\nIn 1994, Nord traveled to Japan where he competed for All Japan Pro Wrestling under his real name. There he formed a tag team with Stan Hansen. During 1995 he was inactive. \n\nIn 1996 he wrestled in Malaysia as the Viking. He lost to Rick Martel on March 5 and also lost to Dick Murdoch on March 6. Then he went to South Africa to work for All Star Wrestling. Later that year he wrestled in the independent circuit in Texas.\n\nIn 1997, Nord joined World Championship Wrestling (WCW) with bleached blond hair and a fu manchu moustache, under his real name, John Nord. He wrestled mainly on \"WCW Saturday Night\" and had a long winning streak that ended with a loss to another streak holder, Bill Goldberg, on July 4, 1998. Nord then formed a short-lived team with Barry Darsow, and was soon gone from WCW.\n\nAfter retiring from wrestling, Nord went to work at his brother's auto dealership, Nord East Motors, in Hilltop, Minnesota.\n\nIn July 2016, Nord was named part of a class action lawsuit filed against WWE which alleged that wrestlers incurred traumatic brain injuries during their tenure and that the company concealed the risks of injury. The suit is litigated by attorney Konstantine Kyros, who has been involved in a number of other lawsuits against WWE. The lawsuit was dismissed by US District Judge Vanessa Lynne Bryant in September 2018.\n\nNord appeared on the January 24, 2018 episode of \"Judge Mathis\" where he was sued by Christine Schmidt, who he had befriended at the substance abuse facility at which she worked, for $4,759 she covered on two credit cards she had opened for him. Nord said he had been in substance abuse recovery since December 2016 and that he and the plaintiff had actually burned through a $10,000 royalty check from WWE on such things as fancy restaurant dinners. Initially, he intended to repay her with funds from another royalty check he expected, but which never materialized. She, therefore, accepted as reimbursement \"205 valuable wrestling dolls\" from his days in the business to sell online. Schmidt sold them for a total of $1,700. Nord claimed she would have earned much more if she sold them at their estimated value, including 5 that were allegedly worth approximately $750 each, about which he informed her when offering them as settlement. Schmidt defended the sale by claiming that she was ignorant about selling online and needed money quickly to pay bills. Mathis ruled that she should have done her due diligence before accepting and selling the dolls, and reduced the amount owed to her by the proceeds from the sale to $3,059.\n\nOn March 23, 2019, Nord was arrested on two charges, a felony for driving while intoxicated/operating a car under the influence of a controlled substance, and a gross misdemeanor for driving after his license was canceled, which he was deemed \"inimical to public safety.\" Nord was placed on a $60,000 bond for the felony DWI charge. This was his seventh DUI arrest, and the latest of 16 incidents over the last decade in which Nord has faced either felony or misdemeanor charges.\n\nOn July 15, 2019, Hennepin County District Judge Jay Quam sentenced Nord to five years' probation on the condition that he remain in restrictive housing and refrain from \"driving whatsoever.\" The prosecution had argued for a four-year prison term, arguing that Nord's history shows him to be a significant risk to public safety. The judge, however, in his decision, took into consideration the fact that Nord is in treatment, has been diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis which has confined him to a wheelchair and will spend the remainder of his life in assisted-living facilities.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1897573", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1897573", "title": "California State Route 209", "text": "California State Route 209\n\nState Route 209 (SR 209) was a state highway in the U.S. state of California, connecting Cabrillo National Monument with the interchange of Interstate 5 (I-5) and I-8 in San Diego, passing through the neighborhoods of Point Loma. The majority of the route was along Rosecrans Street; it also included Cañon Street and Catalina Boulevard leading to the tip of Point Loma.\n\nThe Rosecrans Street portion of SR 209 corresponded to the original routing of the historic La Playa Trail. Rosecrans Street was paved in the late 1900s through the community of Roseville, and was added to the state highway system in 1933 as Route 12. SR 209 was designated in the 1964 state highway renumbering, and a full interchange with I-5 and I-8 was completed in 1969. The designation was removed from the state highway system in 2003 and responsibility for the road was transferred to the city of San Diego.\n\nThe route began at a turnaround next to the Old Point Loma Lighthouse in the Cabrillo National Monument, near the southern tip of Point Loma. Heading north along the crest of the Point Loma peninsula, it passed through Fort Rosecrans Military Reservation and Fort Rosecrans National Cemetery before exiting the former through a gate and entering the Wooded Area neighborhood of Point Loma as Catalina Boulevard. SR 209 passed through this residential neighborhood and provided access to Point Loma Nazarene University. The SR 209 designation then made a right turn onto Cañon Street, curved to the southeast, and went downhill to the bayside location of the old La Playa Trail. At the intersection with Rosecrans Street, the designation made a turn to the northeast at a right angle onto Rosecrans.\n\nAs it continued northeast through the Roseville and Loma Portal neighborhoods, SR 209 intersected both Harbor Boulevard and Nimitz Boulevard before passing along the northwestern edge of the Naval Training Center San Diego (now closed and redeveloped as Liberty Station) and providing access to the Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego at Barnett Street. SR 209 continued from Midway Drive northeast to the intersection of Sports Arena Boulevard and Camino del Rio West, where the highway continued north onto the latter, terminating at the ramps leading into the interchange with I-5 and I-8.\n\nIn 1996, SR 209 had an annual average daily traffic (AADT) of 2,600 vehicles at the southern end in Cabrillo National Monument, and 61,000 vehicles at the northern end at the I-5/I-8 junction, the latter of which was the highest AADT for the highway.\n\nThe Rosecrans Street portion of the highway followed the route of the historic La Playa Trail, the oldest European trail on the west coast, which connected the Spanish settlements in Old Town and Mission San Diego de Alcala with the ship loading and unloading area at La Playa.\n\nIn February 1907, a petition to construct a railway line along Rosecrans Street from 38th Street to MacAuley Street was introduced to the San Diego City Council. By July, work was to begin on grading Rosecrans Street through what was known as the city of Roseville in preparation for construction of the Point Loma Electric Railway line. The work was briefly disrupted due to a labor dispute, but by June 1908, of the had been paved. By March 1909, railroad tracks were being placed along Rosecrans Street. The city assumed maintenance of the road on May 1, after it had been paved from Tide Street to Ocean Beach. Private citizens paid for over $100,000 of the costs, and the city was to pay for $12,000, according to an agreement made in 1904. However, by December the bill had not been paid by the city due to a lack of funds, and the construction company filed a claim; on December 29, the city agreed to pay $12,000, using funds from the water department.\n\nThe termination of the Point Loma streetcar line was considered in 1923, but the San Diego Electric Railway decided to keep it running after residents opposed the idea of using buses instead. However, by 1946, bus lines were in place on Rosecrans Street, and a petition for increased bus service to Point Loma was given to the city in October 1947.\n\nThe new divided highway known as Rosecrans Boulevard from Lytton Street to Canon Street was dedicated on June 5, 1940, and was a part of the state highway system extending to Cabrillo National Monument, which served as the western end of Legislative Route 12. Before this project, it was a two-lane road that had issues such as traffic congestion and flooding. A monument marking La Playa Trail at Avenida de Portugal and Rosecrans Street that had been installed in 1934 was removed by the construction in the 1940s; however, a replacement was installed in 2010. Another of the six monuments was moved out of the median near the Midway Drive intersection to a commercial area that same year. During the 1950s, the route from Lytton Street and Rosecrans Street to Pacific Highway was considered a part of US 80.\n\nSR 209 was designated in the 1964 state highway renumbering. Plans for an interchange between I-5, I-8, SR 209, and SR 109 date from 1965, although several concerns had to be taken into account, including the preservation of historical Old Town and keeping traffic through the area moving during construction. The goal was to begin construction in 1966, and complete the interchange in 1969. There were concerns about a $3 billion shortfall in funding during May 1966, which caused the San Diego Chamber of Commerce Highway Committee to recommend the completion of SR 109 as a project.\n\nConstruction had begun on September 22, 1966, and the interchange was to replace the intersection of Pacific Highway and Rosecrans Street. The cost of the interchange was projected to be $10.86 million. The eight-lane freeway was projected to relieve traffic in the Frontier Street area coming from the San Diego Sports Arena. Completion of both the interchange and SR 109 was planned for early 1969. The ramp from south I-5 to Camino del Rio opened in February 1968, with the remainder of the project to be completed in summer 1969. The entire project was completed in September, with the road scheduled to open in October; just a few months before, the routing of SR 209 had been determined. The routing of SR 109 was officially added to I-8 in 1972.\n\nIn 1971, there was a state proposal to remove SR 209 from the state highway system, which the City of San Diego objected to. However, SR 209 was deleted from the system in 2003, and had been given to the City of San Diego in 2001.\n\n"}

He was a soldier, swimming and kayak instructor, agricultural worker, technician in construction, technical designer, radio speaker, and journalist for 26 years. He is a painter and sculptor and an author of several poetry books.\n\nHe came to central Havana when he was 37 and was astonished by the level of violence but also by the energy of the people who lived there.\n\nHe is the author of \"Dirty Havana Trilogy\", \"King of Havana\", \"Tropical Animal\" (winner of Spain's Alfonso Garcia Ramos Prize in 2000), \"The Insatiable Spiderman\", \"Dog Meat\" (winner of Italy's Narrativa Sur del Mundo Prize), \"Snake's Nest\" (winner of the Prix des Amériques Insulaires et de la Guyane in 2008), \"Our GG in Havana\", and the short stories of \"Melancholy of Lions\". \"Dirty Havana Trilogy\", \"Tropical Animal\" and \"The Insatiable Spiderman\" have been translated to English. Since 1994, he has written ten prose books and five books of poetry. In 2007, he published \"Corazón Mestizo\", a Cuban travel book.\n\nCalled a master of \"Cuban dirty realism,\" like Zoé Valdés and Fernando Velázquez Medina, he tells the stories of the Cuban underclass in a direct, visceral style. His books describe contemporary Cuba from his semiautobiographical perspective as a disillusioned journalist.\n\nHis books are typically gritty, tragicomic accounts of himself and his countrymen hustling for money, searching for pleasure and happiness, and struggling in desperate situations. He makes heavy use of irony. His stories illustrate the difficulty of achieving self-sufficiency and contentment in a dysfunctional and poverty-stricken society with a paternalistic government.\n\nHis narrative voice is skeptical, intellectual, humorous, crass, sardonic, and bluntly frank. His literary persona is chiefly concerned with escaping poverty. However, efforts are rarely successful, and much of his time is spent escaping misery through sex and his preferred vices of rum, cigars and marijuana.\n\n\"Dirty Havana Trilogy\" (\"Trilogía sucia de La Habana\") (1998) is his best known work. It is set during the economic depression in Cuba in the early to mid-1990s. Its first two parts, \"Anclado en la tierra de nadie\" (\"Anchored in No-man's Land\") and \"Nada que hacer\" (\"Nothing to Do\"), follow the picaresque adventures of a protagonist, who, like the author, is a one-time journalist called Pedro Juan. He struggles with loneliness, claustrophobia and alcoholism. The third part, \"Sabor a mí\" (\"Essence of Me\"), is a collection of short stories in which Pedro Juan appears only intermittently.\n\nDespite his grim depiction of Cuban life, his writing stresses his overriding love for Cuban culture. He frequently praises Cuban music, resourcefulness, and \"joie de vivre\". He writes scornfully of people who avoid risk and self-expression in exchange for smothering safety and boredom-inducing banality.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1897579", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1897579", "title": "Rocky Mountain News", "text": "Rocky Mountain News\n\nThe Rocky Mountain News (nicknamed the Rocky) was a daily newspaper published in Denver, Colorado, United States, from April 23, 1859, until February 27, 2009. It was owned by the E. W. Scripps Company from 1926 until its closing. As of March 2006, the Monday–Friday circulation was 255,427. From the 1940s until 2009, the newspaper was printed in a tabloid format.\n\nUnder the leadership of president, publisher, and editor John Temple, the \"Rocky Mountain News\" had won four Pulitzer Prizes since 2000. Most recently in 2006, the newspaper won two Pulitzers, in Feature Writing and Feature Photography. The paper's final issue appeared on Friday, February 27, 2009, less than two months shy of its 150th anniversary. Its demise left Denver a one-newspaper town, with \"The Denver Post\" as the sole remaining large-circulation daily.\n\nThe \"Rocky Mountain News\" was founded by William N. Byers and John L. Dailey along with Dr. George Monell and Thomas Gibson on April 23, 1859, when present-day Denver was part of the Kansas Territory and before the city of Denver had been incorporated. It became Colorado's oldest newspaper and possibly its longest continuously operated business. Its first issue was printed on a printing press from Omaha, Nebraska, that had been hauled by oxcart during the start of the Colorado Gold Rush. Elizabeth \"Libby\" Byers accompanied the press from Nebraska to Denver and joined her husband as a copublisher and journalist at the paper. That first issue was printed only 20 minutes ahead of its rival, the \"Cherry Creek Pioneer\".\n\nThe \"Rocky\" went from a weekly to a daily newspaper in August 1860, and from an evening to a morning newspaper in July 1870.\n\nIn 1883, the newspaper took a stand against corruption and crime in Denver. One of its primary targets was city crime boss Jefferson Randolph Smith, alias \"Soapy\" Smith. In one crime-fighting campaign, the managing editor, John Arkins, allowed disrespectful comments about Smith's wife and children to be published and Smith assaulted Arkins with a cane, severely injuring the editor. The \"News\" continued its crusade to rid Denver of its most celebrated bad man, which took nearly a decade to complete.\n\nThe E. W. Scripps Company bought the \"Rocky Mountain News\" in 1926. The \"Rocky Mountain News\" and its competitors, including \"The Denver Post\", resorted to gasoline giveaways and other promotions in an attempt to boost circulation. By the early 1940s, the \"Rocky\" had nearly died.\n\nIt was saved by then editor Jack Foster when he convinced Scripps to approve changing the newspaper from a broadsheet format to a tabloid design. Foster reasoned that the new format would make it easier for readers to hold and navigate and would make advertising more affordable.\n\nFoster's wife, Frances, introduced America's first \"advice\" column, called Molly Mayfield. It became an instant favorite among readers and was soon adopted in many other newspapers, paving the way for advice columnists such as Ann Landers and Abigail Van Buren.\n\nAfter a continued rivalry that almost put both papers out of business, the \"Rocky\" and \"The Post\" merged operations in 2001 under a joint operating agreement. Through the agreement, the Denver Newspaper Agency was formed. The new company ran all noneditorial operations of both papers, namely advertising and circulation, and was equally owned by the E. W. Scripps Company and by MediaNews Group, which owns \"The Post\".\n\nThe two newspapers continued to publish separately except during the weekends, when the \"Rocky Mountain News\" was published only on Saturday and \"The Denver Post\" only on Sunday; each newspaper had one page of editorials in the other paper's weekend edition. They maintained their rivalry. The \"Rocky\" was considered more politically conservative than the \"Post\".\n\nOn January 23, 2007, the \"Rocky Mountain News\" was redesigned to a smaller, magazine-style format with more color pages and photographs, full-page photo section covers, a new masthead logo, and different page numbering from the previous design.\n\nThe redesign was the result of new presses that allowed the newspaper to print about 25% faster than its old presses, at an average speed of 60,000 issues per hour.\n\nOn December 4, 2008, E. W. Scripps put the \"News\" up for sale, with industry analysts saying the move was possibly a prelude to shutting down the paper. Although Scripps was contacted by Brian Ferguson, a private equity investor from Texas, who expressed interest, that deal fell through for reasons that included complications of the joint operating agreement. On February 26, 2009, Scripps announced that the \"Rocky Mountain News\" would print its final edition the next day, and that the newspaper's masthead, archives, and web site would be offered for sale, separate from its interest in the newspaper agency.\n\nFollowing the shutdown of the \"Rocky\", the \"Post\", now the only daily newspaper in Denver, resumed seven-day-a-week publication.\nA few years later, a study by a Portland State University professor attributed a decline of 30% in civic engagement following the closure of the Rocky.\n\nOn March 16, 2009, several former \"Rocky Mountain News\" staffers announced a plan to develop a new on-line, real-time local newspaper, with a staff of about 30 journalists. The plan required 50,000 subscriber pledges before April 23, 2009; if that goal was met, the full website, with the name \"INDenver Times\", would launch on May 4, 2009. On April 23, 2009, \"INDenver Times\", the name for the proposed restart, reported that only 3,000 people had subscribed to the premium content subscription model. The three co-founders said that they did not intend to continue the planned business model, and, instead, would create a less-staffed news site, while Steve Foster and several former \"Rocky Mountain News\" journalists said that they believed that the original business model of a robustly staffed on-line alternative newspaper could succeed and were looking for new backers.\n\n\"INDenver Times\", still on-line , does not use the subscription model, instead depending on advertising for its revenue. , the three co-founders Kevin Prebuld, Brad Gray, and Ben Ray, editor Steve Haigh, and contributors Drew Litton and Ed Stein were the only remaining staff from the original venture. The site relies on 15 contributors and six \"INSighters\". On September 7, 2009, INDT.com unveiled a new website design, allowing readers to read the news in a more organized format.\n\nOn July 4, 2009, Steve Foster and several former \"Rocky Mountain News\" employees launched a new venture known as the \"Rocky Mountain Independent\". The new website used a three-pronged revenue strategy: advertising, subscription revenues, and outside contributors. Subscriptions cost $4.00 per month and yearly subscriptions were 50% for the first three months, at $24. The 12 owners of the website committed to working for free until the end of September 2009. The website stopped publishing new content on October 5, 2009.\n\nIn December 2014 Denver billionaire Philip Anschutz was reported to be exploring the possibility of reviving the \"Rocky Mountain News\"; he had placed a prototype online and was conducting market research to assess the feasibility of a relaunch.\n\nIn 2000, the \"Rocky Mountain News\" photo staff was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Breaking News Photography \"for its powerful collection of emotional images taken after the student shootings at Columbine High School.\"\n\nIn 2002, the paper won more first-place awards than any other Western newspaper.\n\nIn 2003, the Pulitzer Prize for Breaking News Photography was awarded to the \"Rocky Mountain News\" photography staff \"for its powerful, imaginative coverage of Colorado's raging forest fires.\" The paper also won the Colorado Press Association's General Excellence Award, the award for the best large daily newspaper in Colorado (for the eighth year in a row).\n\nThe photo and design staffs won 25 Society for News Design awards, placed eighth in the world, and won nine National Press Photographers Association awards and six Pictures of the Year International awards.\n\nIn 2006, Jim Sheeler of the \"Rocky Mountain News\" won the Pulitzer Prize for Feature Writing for his \"Final Salute\" special report, the story of a Marine major assigned to casualty notification and how he helps families with fallen relatives in Iraq cope with their losses. Todd Heisler won the Pulitzer Prize for Feature Photography the same year for his photos in the same special report.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1897581", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1897581", "title": "A Maggot", "text": "A Maggot\n\nA Maggot (1985) is a novel by British author John Fowles. It is Fowles' sixth major novel, following \"The Collector, The Magus, The French Lieutenant's Woman, Daniel Martin,\" and \"Mantissa.\" Its title, as the author explains in the prologue, is taken from the archaic sense of the word that means \"whim\", \"quirk\", \"obsession\", or even a snatch of music (see earworm). Another meaning of the word \"maggot\" becomes apparent later in the novel, used by a character to describe a white, oblong machine that appears to be a spacecraft. Though the author denied that \"A Maggot\" is a historical novel, it does take place during a precise historical timeframe, May 1736 to February 1737, in England. It might be variously classified as historical fiction, mystery, or science fiction. Because of the narrative style and various metafictional devices, most critics classify it as a postmodern novel.\n\nThe book opens with an objective narration about a group of five travellers travelling through Exmoor in rural England. They arrive at an inn in a small village, and soon it becomes clear that they are not who they seem to be. The \"maid\" Louise casually rebuffs the sexual advances of the servant, Dick Thurlow, but then goes to his master's room and undresses before them both. Bartholomew calls his supposed uncle \"Lacy\" and they discuss Bartholomew's refusal to disclose his journey's secret purpose, as well as fate versus free will. Eventually the narration stops and is followed by letters, interview transcripts, and snatches of more third-person narration, interspersed by facsimile pages from contemporary issues of The Gentleman's Magazine. We learn from a fictional news story that a man has been found hanged near the place where the travellers were staying.\n\nThe subsequent interviews are conducted by Henry Ayscough, a lawyer employed by Bartholomew's father, who is a Duke. The interviews reveal that Bartholomew had hired the party to travel with him but deceived them about the purpose of his journey. Variations of his story are (1) he was on his way to elope against the wishes of family; (2) he was visiting a wealthy, aged aunt to secure an inheritance from her; (3) he was seeking a cure for impotence; (4) he was pursuing some scientific or occult knowledge, possibly concerning knowledge of the future. He takes Rebecca and Dick to a cave in a remote area. Rebecca's initial tale, retold by Jones, is that he there performed a satanic ritual, and Rebecca herself was raped by Satan and forced to view a panorama of human suffering and cruelty. Rebecca's own testimony admits this was a deception to quiet Jones. She says that she actually saw Bartholomew meet a noble lady who took them all inside a strange floating craft (which she calls \"the maggot\"). In this craft she sees what she describes as a divine revelation of heaven (\"June Eternal\") and the Shaker Trinity (Father, Son, and female Holy Spirit or \"Mother Wisdom\"). She also sees a vision of human suffering and cruelty in this version of her story. Modern readers may interpret her visions as films and her overall experience as a contact with time travellers or extraterrestrials. Rebecca then loses consciousness; she wakes, finds Jones outside the cave, and they leave together. She then tells Jones the satanic version of her experience. Meanwhile, Jones has seen Dick leave the cave in terror, presumably to go and hang himself.\n\nRebecca later finds herself pregnant. She returns to her Quaker parents but then converts to Shakerism, marries a blacksmith named John Lee, and gives birth to Ann Lee, the future leader of the American Shakers. The mystery of Bartholomew's disappearance is never solved, and Ayscough surmises that he committed suicide out of guilt from his disobedience to his father in the matter of an arranged marriage.\n\n\nThe novel's narrative technique of using letters, interviews, a fictional news story (see false document), and real historical documents harks back to, and to some extent satirises, the conventions in place early in the history of the novel, when the epistolary novel was the most common form. (Fowles' book is set in 1736, just a few decades after the first novels in English, and just a few years before Samuel Richardson's landmark \"Pamela\".) Originally, these strategies were intended to strengthen the illusion of reality and mitigate the fictionality of fiction; Fowles uses them ironically to highlight the disconnect between fiction and reality. At several points in the novel, the characters or narrator foreground their existence as characters in a story, further highlighting the book's fictionality. Moreover, the novel resists many conventions of fiction, such as the omniscient narrator (Fowles' narrator seems omniscient but divulges little of importance) and the drive for climax and resolution. In particular, the novel resists the convention of detective fiction which satisfies the desire for a final solution.\n\nThe novel also examines the nature of history, historiography, and criminal justice, as Ayscough represents the historian/judge trying to create a coherent narrative out of problematic testimonies. The \"maggot\" itself, as a possible time machine, represents historians as intruders in the past who alter it according to their own desires and needs. The power struggle between Ayscough and Rebecca to create the narrative of the past problematises the objectivity of history, making it subordinate to interests of social class and gender. In the end, Fowles uses Rebecca and Ayscough as representatives of two classes of people, one subjective, intuitive, mystical, artistic (i.e., \"right-brained\"); the other objective, analytical, and judgmental (i.e., \"left-brained\"). See cerebral hemisphere.\n\nFinally, Fowles explicitly positions \"A Maggot\" in an era which, he claims, saw the beginning of modern selfhood (see self (psychology), self (philosophy), individual). Rebecca is a prototypical modern individual experiencing the difficulty of breaking free from the restraints of society and convention to be radically self-realized. In this we can see Fowles' residual existentialism, though the novel as a whole represents a move beyond existentialism. His postscript both praises the struggle for modern selfhood and criticises it for having been co-opted by capitalism to create excessive consumerism.\n\n\n"}

He first appeared in The Eternals #13 (July 1977) and was created by Jack Kirby. He is a member of the near-immortal hidden race known as the Eternals. He was also a member of the Avengers.\n\nDon Lee portrays Gilgamesh in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, debuting in \"The Eternals\" (2021).\n\nThe Forgotten One was created by Jack Kirby, and first appeared in \"The Eternals\" #13 (July 1977).\n\nDuring his millennia of activity, the adventurer and warrior Forgotten One has used the names of or been mistaken for numerous heroes of myth and legend, including Gilgamesh and Hercules. He became an outcast from his fellow Eternals when their ruler, Zuras, decreed that he had been too proud a meddler in the mortal world and confined him to a sector of Olympus. Eventually the Eternal known as Sprite convinced him to come out of exile and journey to the mother-ship of the Fourth Host of the Celestials to assist the Eternals in battle against the Deviants.\n\nAfter this battle, he was renamed Hero by the One Above All, the chief of the alien Celestials, who had created the Eternals and Deviants. After losing a battle with Thor, Hero and the other Eternals assisted Thor in battling the host of the Celestials to prevent them from destroying humanity. Hero also fought Hercules.\n\nHero later became known as the Forgotten One. He helped the other Eternals in battle against Ghaur.\n\nLater, when the membership of the Avengers had been virtually emptied, the Forgotten One joined them for a time. He renamed himself Gilgamesh, donning a costume that resembled the hide of the Bull of Heaven and went to work as a monster-slayer. He assisted the Avengers in battles against the Growing Man, Nanny, the Orphan-Maker and N'astirh's demons. He participated in the Avengers' battle against Supernova and helped them fight the U-Foes. He assisted the Avengers in their struggle with the Lava Men, and was somehow severely injured during the battle. Gilgamesh was brought to the Eternals' home of Olympia, which had temporarily fallen into the Negative Zone, to recover from his injuries. There, he fought against Blastaar, who had temporarily disintegrated the other Eternals. Gilgamesh left the Avengers at that time, as his essence had been bound to Olympus. He later recovered from his injuries and defeated B'Gon the sorcerer, thereby winning a reputation as a hero on modern day Earth. Gilgamesh was later seen among the superhumans selected by Her as potential mates.\n\nHe returned to the Avengers Mansion during \"The Crossing\", a crossover, only to be killed by Neut, an agent of the time traveler Immortus, who was at the time disguised as Kang the Conqueror. It was later shown that Gilgamesh is alive, and once again associated with his fellow Eternals.\n\nThe Forgotten One is a member of the Eternal race, and possesses a number of superhuman abilities common to the Eternals, but has trained some of them far beyond the norm. While the exact limits are unknown, his immense, superhuman strength makes him the physically strongest of all known Eternals, save for Thanos. His strength has been shown to rival that of Thor, and Hercules.\n\nLike all other Eternals, The Forgotten One is virtually immortal. He hasn't aged since reaching adulthood and he is immune to all known diseases; his body is also highly durable and resistant to physical injury. He is capable of withstanding high caliber bullets, falls from great heights, powerful concussive forces, and temperature extremes, all without being injured. However, it is possible to injure him by disrupting the mental discipline that he maintains over his body. This ability allows him to control every molecule in his body, which in turn allows him to regenerate any damaged or destroyed tissue. However, should his mental discipline be broken, it is possible to permanently injure or kill him.\n\nOther abilities that he has in common with most other Eternals include the power to levitate himself and/or fly at great speed, project beams of concussive force or heat from his eyes and hands, and the power to manipulate matter. To what degree these powers have been developed in comparison with other Eternals isn't known, but the first two have been stated as presumed to be average. He also has highly developed senses that helped to compensate for his former blindness, enabling him to be an excellent hunter and tracker.\n\nThe Forgotten One is one of the most accomplished hand-to-hand combatants among the Eternals. He possesses an extraordinary melee capacity, with knowledge of most methods of hand-to-hand combat known in ancient Earth civilizations. He sometimes wears battle armor of unknown composition, and usually arms himself with simple hand weapons such as an axe, spear, or club.\n\nOther characters have used the identity of either Gilgamesh or Hero. These include:\n\n\"Newsarama\" ranked the character, as Gilgamesh, as the second worst Avengers member commenting: \"What's that you say? You aren't familiar with Gilgamesh, the ancient Sumerian hero? And why is this guy wearing a cow on his head? Let's just say there's a reason this guy is called \"The Forgotten One\". Maybe next time you can get Mithras, or at least Marduk\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1897596", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1897596", "title": "William W. Thomas Jr.", "text": "William W. Thomas Jr.\n\nWilliam Widgery Thomas Jr. (August 26, 1839 – October 7, 1927) was a United States politician from Maine.\n\nHe was born in Portland, Cumberland County, Maine, the son of William Widgery Thomas and Elizabeth White (Goddard) Thomas. A lawyer before entering foreign politics, most notable was his effort to bring Swedish colonists to northern Maine and later founding the community of New Sweden, Maine in 1870. He is also noted for being the last U.S. ambassador to the united kingdoms of Sweden and Norway.\n\nA Republican, Thomas found a love for the people of Scandinavia at an early age. At only 23 years of age, and full of enthusiasm for his task, he was appointed consul to Gothenburg, Sweden on October 23, 1862. Prior to that he had gone as American consul to Galatz in Romania, and after a voyage of four months, he reached Gothenburg in the middle of June 1863. He learned quickly to understand and speak Swedish, and as consul, in the kingdom of Sweden-Norway he laid plans for a large emigration of both Swedes and Norwegians, with the hopes that most would seek new fortunes in his home state of Maine. As he wrote April 5, 1864, for the encouragement of immigration: \"Besides all other reasons, I believe these honest, pious, plodding Swedes would form an excellent balance to the fickle, merry, light-hearted Irish, who are now crowding in such goodly numbers to our shores.\"\n\nAfter the Second war of Schleswig between Denmark and Prussia ended in 1864, Swedish volunteers coming back from Denmark wanted to go to America and continue fighting there in the American Civil War. Thomas solved this problem without asking his government for directions. He arranged with the captains of the Hamburg steamers to take these soldiers across the ocean at half price, and together with some friends he \"made up a little purse\" with which they could be sent to Hamburg. \"I am well aware,\" he reported to the U.S. Department of State, \"that as consul I can have nothing to do with enlisting soldiers, but no international law can prevent me from paying a soldier's passage from here to Hamburg out of my own pocket.\" In the course of the following winter, Thomas induced more Swedish soldiers to go to America.\n\nThe same year he had planned to enlarge his propaganda for emigration considerably. He wrote to the Department: \"I have the honor to ask for a leave of absence from this Consular district, but not from this Kingdom, for three months; my absence to commence about the middle of May next. My design is to visit the mines in the interior of Sweden and Norway and to see and talk with the people of this country in their own homes. One of the chief objects of my expedition will be to encourage all whom I meet to emigrate to the United States. In every hamlet where I pass the night, at every post-station where I await fresh horses, I shall scatter such information as I have found by experience to be best calculated to promote the emigration of these Scandinavians to our own land. It is my intention on my return to report the results of my expedition to the Department, giving special attention to the subject of immigration, stating what impediments still exist, and the best means of overcoming them. Hon. J. S. Haldeman, Minister Resident at Stockholm, has authorized me to mention that he warmly approves of my intended journey.\"\n\nThe Department, too, approved. It granted, on March 26, the leave of absence Thomas had applied for. But when this permission arrived, he was so busy arranging his other plans that he decided to postpone his trip until the next year. Towards the end of June 1865, he set out on the journey he had planned, taking with him the text of the Homestead Act and other documents printed in the language of the country, proposing to sow this good seed broadcast all along his way. In fact, the journey came to embrace Norway almost exclusively. Returning to Gothenburg after several months, he sent his report to the Department of State, an excerpt of it reads:\n\nOne of the chief objects of my expedition was to diffuse knowledge tending towards emigration, and whether driving over the fjelds, scaling mountains, resting at stations, or coasting along the shore in steamers, I everywhere preached an immigration crusade to the laborer's paradise in the New World. I spoke of our homestead law — the fertility of our soil — the length of our summer — the richness of our immense mining districts, but I found nothing so telling as the simple description of the condition and prospects of the working man in the United States of America. Of fifty odd postillions I had along the road, all promised me to immigrate to the United States next Spring, save one; he, I ascertained, had been in England for nine months, and, judging all foreign countries by the one he had visited, concluded, perhaps wisely according to his light, to remain at home. ( ... ) Sometimes some Norwegian proprietors, not liking perhaps the tendency of things, would commence a discussion in presence of the deck-passengers. I found it very easy to refute all their arguments. When driven from every other point they invariably took refuge under the palladium of patriotism — love for Gamle Norge (Old Norway). To this I replied, that I recognized no love of country, not connected with love for our countrymen; if then, as they had been constrained to admit, the Norwegian laborer bettered his condition by immigrating into the United States, true patriotism should assist him to go, not hinder him from going. I however always treated these Norwegian gentlemen personally with the greatest respect. In no case did one discussion descend to altercation, and no unfriendly words were ever used.\n\nThomas estimated a total of 10,000 immigrants that year to the United States from Sweden and Norway, but he was quick to add the numbers would prove rather under than over the truth.\n\nShortly after this propaganda trip through Norway, the consular activities of Thomas came to an end. At the beginning of November 1865, he received notice from the Department of State that, under the act of Congress, it was not authorized to continue his salary anymore. Consequently, he resigned and left for his home state of Maine.\n\nIn Maine, he became, in 1870, a member of the immigration commission, virtually its leading member, and in that year he went to Sweden, brought a whole colony of Swedes back to America, and founded New Sweden in the northern forests of Maine, where he himself spent the better part of the next four years. He was a member of the Maine House of Representatives 1873–1875 and served as Speaker of the Maine House of Representatives from 1874 to 1875. Also a member of the Maine State Senate in 1879 and delegate to Republican National Convention from Maine in 1880.\n\nThomas would return to Scandinavia, serving as American Minister to Sweden and Norway in three separate terms: 1883-1885, 1889-1894 and 1898-1905. Sweden in particular would always remain his great love; he married a Swedish noblegirl, Dagmar Törnebladh (1869-1912), on October 11, 1887 in Stockholm.\n\nThomas was appointed American Minister for his third and last period on December 18, 1898, until he was recalled on May 31, 1905. In a letter to the U.S. Department of State February 2, 1905, Thomas wrote: \"A serious crisis for the union of Sweden and Norway seems very imminent.\" He was commenting on the growing concerns that the Norwegian government was about to renounce the union with Sweden. He added in the letter that he was convinced there wouldn't be a war between the two countries, and personally he hoped the union could be preserved. He continued, \"in this conviction of peace, lies the greatest hope for every friend of Scandinavia, that the union between these two noble nations in the high north, must be preserved in one form or another.\" In March 1905 he reported home that the Norwegian government had resigned and a new one would be formed. He noted the new one would probably be composed of \"members of the extreme left, meaning those who wish for an immediate and radical action in regard to the relationship between Sweden and Norway.\" This \"extreme left\" was now prime minister Christian Michelsen, who to all Norwegians would become the leading symbol of the movement towards dissolution of the unpopular union. Thomas' last mission as American Minister ended that spring, he was recalled on May 31, making him in effect, the last US ambassador to the united kingdoms of Sweden and Norway. On June 7, 1905, the union of Sweden and Norway ended, and he would be succeeded by Charles H. Graves.\n\nThomas moved back home to Maine. He married a second time on June 2, 1915, in Solna, Sweden, his first wife´s younger sister, Aina Törnebladh (1877-1967). On June 2, 1919, William Widgery Thomas Jr. donated the Thomas Memorial Library to the Inhabitants of the Town of Cape Elizabeth to be maintained as a free public library forever. Ambassador Thomas died on April 25, 1927 at the age of 88 and was buried at Evergreen Cemetery, Portland, Maine.\n\nHis wives were the daughters of Dr Henrik Ragnar Törnebladh (1833-1912), a headmaster and member of the Swedish Parliament 1873-1875, 1879-1888 and 1889-1909, and his wife Elisabeth Maria Siljeström (1842-1929).\n\nWilliam Widgery Thomas was honoured with the Royal Swedish Order of the Polar Star, Knight Commander 1st class, in 1887, and Grand Cross in 1905.\n\n\n"}

Johnson on September 24, 1965, established requirements for non-discriminatory practices in hiring and employment on the part of U.S. government contractors. It \"prohibits federal contractors and federally assisted construction contractors and subcontractors, who do over $10,000 in Government business in one year from discriminating in employment decisions on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\" It also requires contractors to \"take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed, and that employees are treated during employment, without regard to their race, color, religion, sex or national origin.\" The phrase \"affirmative action\" had appeared previously in Executive Order 10925 in 1961.\n\nThe order was a follow-up to Executive Order 10479 signed by President Dwight D. Eisenhower on August 13, 1953 establishing the anti-discrimination Committee on Government Contracts, which itself was based on a similar Executive Order 8802 issued by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1941. Eisenhower's Executive Order has been amended and updated by at least six subsequent Executive Orders. It differed significantly from the requirements of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which only required organizations to document their practices once there was a preliminary finding of wrongdoing. This Executive Order required the businesses it covered to maintain and furnish documentation of hiring and employment practices upon request.\n\nThe Executive Order also required contractors with 51 or more employees and contracts of $50,000 or more to implement affirmative action plans to increase the participation of minorities and women in the workplace if a workforce analysis demonstrates their under-representation, meaning that there are fewer minorities and women than would be expected given the numbers of minorities and women qualified to hold the positions available. Federal regulations require affirmative action plans to include an equal opportunity policy statement, an analysis of the current work force, identification of under-represented areas, the establishment of reasonable, flexible goals and timetables for increasing employment opportunities, specific action-oriented programs to address problem areas, support for community action programs, and the establishment of an internal audit and reporting system.\n\nThe Order assigned the responsibility for enforcing parts of the non-discrimination in contracts with private industry to the Department of Labor. Detailed regulations for compliance with the Order were not issued until 1969, when the Nixon administration made affirmative action part of its civil rights strategy.\n\nIn 1971, a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed the validity of Executive Order 11246 in a case brought by the Contractors Association of Eastern Pennsylvania in January 1970 that challenged the Nixon Administration's implementation known as the Philadelphia Plan. In April 1971, the court rejected numerous challenges to the order, including claims that it was beyond the President's constitutional authority, that it was inconsistent with Titles VI and VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and that it was inconsistent with the National Labor Relations Act. The Supreme Court of the United States declined to hear the case, \"Contractors Association of Eastern Pennsylvania v. Secretary of Labor\", in October.\n\nIn 1986, the Reagan administration was opposed to the affirmative action requirements of this Executive Order and contemplated modifying it to prohibit employers from using \"quotas, goals, or other numerical objectives, or any scheme[,] device, or technique that discriminates against, or grants any preference to, any person on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\" The contemplated change was never issued because it faced bi-partisan opposition in Congress that threatened to counteract it by enacting Executive Order 11246 into law by a veto-proof majority.\n\nOn October 13, 1967 Executive Order 11375 amended Executive Order 11246 adding the category \"sex\" to the anti-discrimination provisions.\n\nOn July 21, 2014, Executive Order 13672 amended Executive Order 11246 and Executive Order 11478 to change \"sexual orientation\" to \"sexual orientation, gender identity\".\n\n\n"}

It exempted newspapers from certain provisions of antitrust laws. Its drafters argued that this would allow the survival of multiple daily newspapers in a given urban market where circulation was declining. This exemption stemmed from the observation that the alternative is usually for at least one of the newspapers, generally the one published in the evening, to cease operations altogether.\n\nIn practice two daily newspapers published in the same city or geographic area combine business operations while maintaining separate—and competitive—news operations.\n\nThe first joint operating agreement was between \"Albuquerque Tribune\" (then the \"New Mexico State Tribune\") and the \"Albuquerque Journal\" in Albuquerque, New Mexico, signed on February 20, 1933. Their agreement became typical of the type—both papers were printed on the same presses at different times of day. Classified advertising sales were consolidated, as were distribution agents. A joint entity to perform these functions was created, with equal representation on its board from both papers. Newsgathering and editorial operations remained completely separate, although located under one roof in different portions of the same building.\n\nArrangements similar to this allowed most medium-sized United States cities to have two daily newspapers until fairly recently. The number of joint operating agreements, as well as the number of evening-published daily newspapers, has declined considerably in recent years, due to the ongoing consolidation of the newspaper industry as a whole, and the decline in readership and interest in evening newspapers in particular, which many observers have attributed to television and the internet, of which the former seems to be magnified by the presence of several 24-hour-a-day news operations on cable television. There have been 28 Joint Operating Agreements to date. The \"Chattanooga Times\" and the \"Chattanooga News-Free Press\"s joint operating agreement became the first to be terminated on August 27, 1966.\n\nThe Newspaper Preservation Act was touted as a relief measure to allow multiple newspapers competing in the same market to cut costs, thus ensuring that no one paper could have supremacy in the market by driving the other(s) out of business. However, mounting evidence suggests the passage of the Act was less about protecting editorial diversity within community newspaper markets than about inflating the profit margins of national newspaper chains. By quietly and informally taking on some behaviors of a cartel, large newspaper chains were able to sustain artificially high profits while driving independent newspapers out of business (or forcing them to sell their stake to a chain). Note that many of the papers listed in the sections below have the same few ownership groups. In fact, President Richard M. Nixon initially opposed the passage of the act (as had his predecessor, Lyndon B. Johnson) as being antithetical to the essential practices and character of free market capitalism.\n\nHe reversed himself upon receiving a letter from Richard E. Berlin, CEO of the Hearst chain of newspapers and magazines. In the 1969 letter, Berlin intimated that failure of the law to pass would carry political consequences and hinted that support from Nixon would conversely help the President and his allies. The Nixon Administration supported the Act's passage, and in the 1972 Presidential Campaign, every Hearst newspaper endorsed Nixon for reelection.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1897646", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1897646", "title": "Bennington Triangle", "text": "Bennington Triangle\n\n\"Bennington Triangle\" is a phrase coined by New England author Joseph A. Citro during a public radio broadcast in 1992 to denote an area of southwestern Vermont within which a number of people went missing between 1945 and 1950. This was further popularized in two books, including \"Shadow Child\", in which he devoted chapters to discussion of these disappearances and various items of folklore surrounding the area. According to Citro, the area shares characteristics with the Bridgewater Triangle in neighboring Massachusetts.\n\nPrecisely what area is encompassed in this hypothetical \"mystery triangle\" is not clear, but it is purportedly centered on Glastenbury Mountain and would include some or most of the area of the towns immediately surrounding it, especially Bennington, Woodford, Shaftsbury, and Somerset. Glastenbury and its neighboring township Somerset were both once moderately thriving logging and industrial towns, but began declining toward the late 19th century, and are now essentially ghost towns, unincorporated by an act of the state legislature in 1937.\n\nAccording to Citro's books, stories of strange happenings had been told about Glastenbury and the surrounding area for many years prior to the disappearances in the 1940s, the best-known of which is probably that of Paula Jean Welden.\n\nBetween 1945 and 1950, five people disappeared in the Bennington area. The first occurred on November 12, 1945 when 74-year-old Middie Rivers disappeared while out hunting. Rivers was guiding a group of four hunters up the mountains. On the way back, Rivers got ahead of the group, and was never seen again. An extensive search was conducted, but the only evidence discovered was a single rifle cartridge that was found in a stream. The speculation was that Rivers had leaned over and the cartridge had dropped out of his pocket into the water. The disappearance had occurred in the Long Trail Road area and Vermont Route 9. Rivers was an experienced hunter and fisherman and was familiar with the local area.\n\nPaula Jean Welden, 18, disappeared about a year later on December 1, 1946. Welden was a sophomore at Bennington College. She had set out for a hike on the Long Trail. Many saw her go, including Ernest Whitman, a \"Bennington Banner\" employee who gave her directions. She was alleged to have been seen on the trail itself by an elderly couple who were about behind her. According to them, she turned a corner in the trail, and when they reached the same corner, she had disappeared. An extensive search was conducted when Welden didn't return to the college campus, which included the posting of a $5,000 reward and help from the FBI. However, no evidence of her was ever found. Unconfirmed rumors speculated that she had moved to Canada with a boyfriend or that she became a recluse living in the mountains.\n\nJames E. Tedford (also spelled as Teford or Tetford), a veteran, was the third person to disappear. He went missing on December 1, 1949, exactly three years after Paula Welden had disappeared. Tedford was a resident of the Bennington Soldiers' Home. He had been in St. Albans visiting relatives, and was returning home on the local bus when he vanished. According to witnesses, Tedford got on the bus, and was still on the bus at the last stop before arriving in Bennington. Somewhere between the last stop and Bennington, Tedford vanished. His belongings were still in the luggage rack and an open bus timetable was on his vacant seat.\n\nThe fourth person to vanish was eight-year-old Paul Jephson. On October 12, 1950, Jephson had accompanied his mother in a truck. She left her son unattended while she fed some pigs. His mother was gone for about an hour. When she returned, her son was nowhere in sight. Search parties were formed to look for the child. Nothing was ever found, though Jephson was wearing a bright red jacket that should have made him more visible. According to one story, bloodhounds tracked the boy to a local highway, where, according to local legend, four years earlier Paula Welden had disappeared.\n\nThe fifth and last disappearance occurred sixteen days after Jephson had vanished. On October 28, 1950, Frieda Langer, 53, and her cousin, Herbert Elsner, left their family campsite near the Somerset Reservoir to go on a hike. During the hike, Langer slipped and fell into a stream. She told Elsner if he would wait, she would go back to the campsite, change clothes and catch up to him. When she did not return, Elsner made his way back to the campsite and discovered Langer had not returned, and that nobody had seen her since they had left. Over the next two weeks, five searches were conducted, involving aircraft, helicopters, and up to 300 searchers. No trace of Langer was found during the search. On May 12, 1951, her body was found near Somerset Reservoir, in an area that had been extensively searched seven months previously. No cause of death could be determined because of the condition of her remains.\n\nLanger was the last person to disappear and the only one whose body was found. \nNo direct connections have been identified that tie these cases together, other than the general geographic area and time period.\n\nThe Bennington Triangle was discussed in Season 3, Episode 8 of the television program William Shatner's \"Weird or What?\" The episode, entitled \"Mysterious Vanishings,\" first aired on July 23, 2012.\n\nThe events of 1945 - 50 are told in episode 67 of Lore (podcast), titled \"The Red Coats\".\n\n"}
{"id": "1897656", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1897656", "title": "Minnie Vautrin", "text": "Minnie Vautrin\n\nWilhelmina \"Minnie\" Vautrin (September 27, 1886 – May 14, 1941) was an American missionary, diarist, educator and president of Ginling College. She was a Christian missionary in China for 28 years. She is known for the care and protection of as many as ten thousand Chinese refugees during the Nanking Massacre in China, at times even challenging the Japanese authorities for documents in an attempt to protect the civilians staying at her college.\n\nAfter persisting in the Nanking Safety Zone from 1937, she returned to the United States under extreme stress in 1940. She committed suicide there in 1941, still wishing in her diary that she could return to her work in China. Vautrin was posthumously awarded the Emblem of the Blue Jade by the Chinese government for her sacrifices during the Nanjing Massacre.\n\nWilhelmina Vautrin was born in Secor, Illinois on September 27, 1886 to Pauline (née Lohr) and Edmond Louis Vautrin. Her father, Edmond, a French immigrant from Lorraine, moved to Peoria, Illinois in 1883 to undergo a blacksmithing apprenticeship with his uncle, and later moved to Secor, where he married Pauline. Minnie was the second of the couple's three children; her elder brother died as an infant.\n\nWhen Minnie was six years old, her mother died of unrecorded causes. After this, Minnie was sent to several different foster homes. Three years later, the courts permitted her to return home to her father, where she assumed many household chores and excelled in school. Her teacher, commending Vautrin's work at school, later said that \"Minnie was a born student...She could excel in most anything she tried, and was a genuinely Christian girl.\" After primary schooling, Vautrin attended Secor High School. During her high school career, Vautrin worked several part-time jobs to save for her schooling and volunteered at local churches.\n\nVautrin was accepted to Illinois State Normal University in Normal, Illinois in 1903. Due to her financial situation, Vautrin had to delay her studies several times to work. When she graduated in 1907, she was ranked first in her class of 93 students and spoke at the commencement ceremonies. She taught mathematics at LeRoy High School, Illinois before continuing her studies at the University of Illinois. At the University, Vautrin was president of the Student Volunteer Movement for Foreign Missions. She graduated in 1912 as salutatorian of her class with a A.B. in science. The university pastor recommended Vautrin to the recruiters of the Foreign Christian Missionary Society, who requested that she replace a teacher in China. Iris Chang notes that Vautrin was \"Tall and Handsome in her youth, with long dark hair, she was a vivacious and popular woman who attracted numerous suitors,\" but who decided that instead of getting married she would become a missionary.\n\nWhen Vautrin received this request \"circa\" 1912, Christian missions to China, facilitated by groups such as the Foreign Christian Missionary Society, had begun to flourish as a result of the treaties ending the First Opium War (1840–42) and Second Opium War (1863-65) that opened Chinese seaports to Christianity. Hua-ling Hu, one of Vautrin's biographers and writer of \" American Goddess at the Rape of Nanking: The Courage of Minnie Vautrin\", writes that \"by 1914, about six thousand young Americans went to foreign countries as missionaries, over one-third of them to China.\" Vautrin accepted the Foreign Christian Missionary Society's request to develop a girls' school in China, and when she was 26 years old, she traveled to Hofei to establish the San Ching Girls' Middle School. During her time at the school the number of pupils increased and a high school department was added. In Hofei, Vautrin also met her future fiancé, a fellow American missionary whose name is unknown.\n\nIn 1918, after serving for a period of six years in China, Minnie returned to the United States for furlough. She enrolled in Columbia University in New York City to pursue a master's degree in education, which she received in 1919. While at Columbia University, Vautrin was approached by a teacher from Ginling College, and was asked to serve as president of the institution for one year. The College was the third institution founded by a group of American missionaries who sought to \"establish four woman's colleges in China – one each in north, central, west, and south.\" Vautrin postponed her wedding for one year in order to become the acting president at Ginling College in 1919. However, she later broke off her engagement and never married.\n\nAt Ginling College, Vautrin decided to extend her one-year agreement. She created courses on education administration and management, an innovative student-teaching program, and handled the planning and funding of the new campus by the West Gate of Nanking. During the fall semester of 1922, Vautrin hosted a fundraiser to build an elementary school for 150 local, mostly illiterate children who lived in the homes near Ginling College's campus. The biographer Hua-ling Hu writes that, while at Ginling College, Minnie \"attempted to lead the students to fulfill the spirit of Ginling's motto, 'abundant life,' by making them walk out of the 'ivory tower' to see and understand the suffering of the poor and by encouraging them to devote their lives for the betterment of the society.\" However, some of the College's staff members and students did not support Vautrin's method, who found her overbearing, conservative, and self-righteous. This may be due to her \"watchful and interfering administrative style.\"\n\nIn 1926, after Vautrin returned from a brief visit to her family in America, the Nationalist government's Northern Expedition troops under General Chiang Kai-Shek captured Nanking. While in Nanking, the army perpetrated the Nanking Incident, which involved the destruction and looting of the city and the slaughter of native citizens as well as foreigners. Ginling College was not harmed during the looting, and Vautrin hid in the College's attic with a few others while Chiang Kai-shek's troops were on Ginling's campus. The Nanking Incident deterred many American missionaries from serving in China, and many left the country.\n\nHowever, Vautrin remained at Ginling College, and served as its president until the Chinese Nationalist government mandated that all colleges in China have native-born presidents. She was replaced by a Ginling graduate, Dr. Wu Yi-fang, in September 1928. In 1931, Vautrin returned to the United States on furlough and in order to care for her aging father. She returned to Ginling in 1932. On June 21, 1937, Vautrin received word that her father, Edmond, had died at the age of 83.\n\nUpon hearing of the Marco Polo Bridge Incident in 1937, Vautrin cancelled her planned furlough, scheduled for 1938, and immediately returned to Nanking from Tokyo in order to protect Ginling College and its students. Vautrin prepared intensely for the approaching Japanese army. She made arrangements to prepare the campus by sending records to Shanghai, purchased supplies, instructed students and faculty on emergency precautions, cleaned out and converting rooms in campus buildings for storage and refuge, and ordered the building of trenches. The first Japanese air raid on Nanking took place on April 14, 1937. As a result of the raid, the American embassy arranged for the evacuation of Americans from the city. In her diary, Vautrin wrote that she felt compelled to stay in Nanking:\n\nI personally feel that I cannot leave... Men are not asked to leave their ships when they are in danger and women are not asked to leave their children.\n\nBy September, only three Ginling students remained on campus. Due to financial strains, the salaries of the fifteen remaining faculty members at Ginling College were halved. Anticipating a direct Japanese assault on the city, the foreigners who chose to stay in Nanking organized the International Committee for the Nanking Safety Zone (ICNSZ) on November 15, 1937. The committee requested that the Japanese and Chinese governments treat a refugee zone of Nanking as neutral, and both nations agreed and granted the ICNSZ neutrality. The Japanese placed one condition on the neutrality, requiring that the neutral zone would be made void if Chinese military personnel were found hiding within it.\n\nIn the first few nights of the Japanese attack on the city, 850 refugees came to Ginling College, which was designated as one of the twenty-five refugee camps in Nanking. When the Imperial Japanese Army took complete control of Nanking in December 1937, she and other foreign nationals, including John Rabe, worked to protect civilians in the Nanking Safety Zone. Ginling College took up its full role as a refugee haven, at times harboring up to 10,000 women in buildings designed to support between 200 and 300. During this period, Vautrin wrote fairly frequently in her diary. One of her entries was a prayer:\n\nOh, God, control the cruel beastliness of the soldiers in Nanking tonight, comfort the heartbroken mothers and fathers whose innocent sons have been shot today, and guard the young women and girls through the long agonizing hours of this night. Speed the day when wars shall be no more. When thy Kingdom will come, Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.\n\nWhen all other refugee camps closed on February 4, 1938, a large number of women and children again sought refuge at the College and a census in mid-March showed 3,310 refugees were resident there. Vautrin would patrol the campus grounds and repel incursions of Japanese soldiers into the College and rescue and care for refugees. She saw to the burial of the dead and the reception of newborn babies and was successful in tracing missing husbands and sons. Industrial or crafts classes were provided for women who had lost their husbands, so that they might support themselves. One hundred women graduated under this program.\n\nVautrin recounted the war in her diary in 1937:\n\nThere probably is no crime that has not been committed in this city today. Thirty girls were taken from language school last night, and today I have heard scores of heartbreaking stories of girls who were taken from their homes last night—one of the girls was but 12 years old. Food, bedding and money have been taken from people. … I suspect every house in the city has been opened, again and yet again, and robbed. Tonight a truck passed in which there were eight or ten girls, and as it passed they called out \"救命！救命！ Jiuming! Jiuming!\"—save our lives. The occasional shots that we hear out on the hills, or on the street, make us realize the sad fate of some man—very probably not a soldier.\n\nOn 19 December:\n\nIn my wrath, I wished I had the power to smite them for their dastardly work. How ashamed women of Japan would be if they knew these tales of horror.\n\nIn 1938, she wrote in her diary that she had to go to the Japanese embassy repeatedly from December 18 to January 13 to get proclamations to prohibit Japanese soldiers from committing crimes at Ginling because the soldiers tore the documents up before taking women away.\nNear the end of her service at Ginling College, Vautrin wrote several entries that lacked her previous determination and optimism. Among these was April 14, 1940:\n\nI'm about at the end of my energy.

After attempting to commit suicide using sleeping pills, Vautrin appeared to recover for a short while. However, she later committed suicide by turning on the stove gas in her apartment in Indianapolis. She was 54 years old.

He is one of the founders of punk band The Mekons, post-punk group The Three Johns, and alternative country ensembles The Waco Brothers and Pine Valley Cosmonauts. He has worked to campaign against the death penalty in Illinois.\n\nLangford was born in Newport, Wales, the youngest son of Kit Langford and Denis Langford, a Registered Chartered Accountant for Lloyd's Brewery. Langford's older brother is science-fiction author and critic David Langford, who lives in Reading, England.\n\nWhen he was young, Langford would visit his grandparents in Croesyceiliog, whose family friend ran two pubs, the Cambrian Arms and The Six In Hand. He attended Gaer Infants School and Gaer Junior School, then Brynglas Primary School, the Newport High School middle school, before Queen's Hill. In 1972-1973, after playing rugby and football, at the age of 15 Langford decided he liked playing music better. He played a lot of David Bowie and was listening to a lot of Man.\n\nLangford attended art school at University of Leeds as a painter. He left school temporarily when the Mekons were founded, but later went back to college and finished his degree.\n\nSince the mid-1980s, Langford has been one of the leaders in incorporating folk and country music into punk rock. He has released a number of solo recordings as well as recordings with other bands outside of The Mekons, most notably the Waco Brothers, which he co-founded after moving to Chicago in the early 1990s. He is involved with the Chicago-based independent record label Bloodshot.\n\nIn a 2010 interview, Langford said his earliest influences were Tom Jones, Slade, T. Rex, The Kinks, Johnny Cash, Man and Black Sabbath.\n\nLangford was originally the drummer for the punk band The Mekons when it formed at the University of Leeds in 1977, but he later took up the guitar as other band members left. The Mekons were signed to Virgin Records but according to Langford they \"got fired.\" They played their first US appearance on New Year's Eve in 1980, gave up live performances for a while, and released 1982's \"The Mekons Story\". They began performing again in public in 1984, playing their first shows as benefits for the British miners' union. After being signed by major American label A&M Records in the late 1980s, label shuffling resulted in the band trying to leave the label. In response, they gave the label, \"The Curse of the Mekons,\" which became only available overseas as an import. A documentary called \"The Revenge of the Mekons\" was released in 2014 by director Joe Angio. The Mekons continue to record and perform live, as of 2019.\n\nWith John Hyatt and Phillip Brennan, Langford released several albums of drum-machine-fueled punk between 1982 and 1987. A retrospective box set was released in August 2015.\n\nThe Waco Brothers make country-punk music, and are a Chicago-based amalgam of players from the Pine Valley Cosmonauts family and others, who have been recording since 1995. For their first albums, they included Dean Schlabowske (guitar/vocal), Tracey Dear (mandolin/vocal), Alan Doughty (bass/vocal), Mark Durante (pedal steel guitar), and Mekons drummer Steve Goulding) By 2015, Goulding, now based in New York City, had been replaced by Joe Camarillo (drums), and Durante had left.\n\nLangford initiated another project, the Pine Valley Cosmonauts, which performs the music of other country music groups. Several alternative country musicians have guested alongside a revolving assortment of Chicago musicians who have backed both Langford and other musicians such as Kelly Hogan.\n\nWee Hairy Beasties were a children's music group based in Chicago, composed of Jon Langford, Sally Timms, Kelly Hogan, and Devil in a Woodpile. They played their first gig together at the Brookfield Zoo near Chicago, and released two albums in 2006 and 2008.\n\nLangford's first official solo album, \"Skull Orchard\", a look back at his hometown of Newport, Wales, was released in 1998. He followed it with \"All the Fame of Lofty Deeds\", in 2004, \"Gold Brick\" in 2006, \"Old Devils\" in 2010 and \"Here Be Monsters\" in 2014.\n\nLangford and Sally Timms, the other Chicago-based member of the Mekons, continue to collaborate on various recording and performance projects, as of 2020.\n\nCirca 2003, Langford started the band \"Ship & Pilot\", to perform his songs. It continued to perform into 2006, and very occasionally since. Ship & Pilot also included Sally Timms, Tony Maimone, Jean Cook, and on drums variously Steve Goulding or Dan Massey.\n\nIn the late 2000s Langford came into contact with the Burlington Welsh Male Chorus based near Toronto. He invited them first to accompany him at a CeltFest in Chicago in 2007, and then to re-record the whole of the \"Skull Orchard\". The album \"Skull Orchard Revisited\" (credited to Jon Langford and the Burlington Welsh Male Chorus) was released on 3 June 2011 by Bloodshot Records.\n\n2010's \"Old Devils\" is a follow up to the first \"Skull Orchard\" album.\n\nAt the 2014 Hideout Block Party in Chicago, Langford debuted the band Bad Luck Jonathan (a name likely inspired by that of then-president of Nigeria, Goodluck Jonathan). The band, described as \"socialist voodoo space boogie\", featured Alan Doughty and Joe Camarillo from the Waco Brothers, Phil Wandscher from Whiskeytown, and Martin Billheimer from Chicago's Pritzker Military Museum and Library.\n\nFour Lost Souls is a collaboration between Langford, John Szymanski, Tawny Newsome and Bethany Thomas. Their eponymous debut album was produced by Norbert Putnam and released in 2017.\n\nAre a group of mainly Newport-based musicians, including members of Give Me Memphis and The Darling Buds. Previously known as LL, the group have written and recorded intermittently for over 20 years, and have been playing live since 2007. As LL, their only release was a demo track (\"Rechem\") on the 1999 compilation \"Fear of a Red Planet\". Debut album \"The Legend of LL\" was released on Country Mile Records in 2015 and included reworkings of several songs from the same LL demos, as well as a new version of \"Pill Sailor\", first released on \"Skull Orchard\" in 1998. Second album \"President of Wales\" was released in November 2019.\n\nThe Killer Shrews were a group composed of Langford (lead vocals), Gary Lucas, and Tony Maimone. They released one self-titled album on Enemy Records in 1993. \n\nLangford has produced portraits of country music icons including Hank Williams, Johnny Cash, and Elvis Presley. His paintings appear on bottles and other items for the Dogfish Head Brewery, and Few Spirits.\n\nLangford has produced paintings of famous and forgotten figures from the dawn of country music. His artwork is available from the Yard Dog Art Gallery in Austin, TX and LeMieux Galleries in New Orleans, LA. \n\n\"Nashville Radio\", a collection of his artwork and writings, was published in 2006.\n\nFor over 10 years, Langford illustrated the comic strip \"Great Pop Things\" under the pseudonym Chuck Death with a friend from his hometown, Newport, Wales, Colin B. Morton, who wrote the text. The cartoon strip was published in alternative weekly newspapers in Los Angeles and Chicago, and was a pen-and-ink history of rock-and-roll. An anthology of the best strips was published in a book of the same name.\n\nIn 2015, Langford was commissioned by the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum to paint a series of portraits for its \"Dylan, Cash, and the Nashville Cats: A New Music City\" exhibition, which opened on March 27, 2015. That commission lead to a collaboration between Langford and Hatch Showprint Master Printer Jim Sherraden. Out of this collaboration, their artwork was adapted for the album cover of the 2016 double-LP \"Trio: Farther Along\" by Dolly Parton, Linda Ronstadt, and Emmylou Harris. \n\nSince 2015, Langford has designed covers for a series of novels by author Jay Spencer Green, including \"Breakfast at Cannibal Joe's\" and \"Ivy Feckett is Looking for Love\".\n\nIn 2018, Langford designed the cover for \"Commercial Suicide Man\", a collaborative single by the Nightingales and Vic Godard.\n\n\n\n\nLangford considers himself \"working class socialist.\" Langford said he became politicized on the death penalty after the execution of John Wayne Gacy.\n\nIn 1988, Langford co-produced (with Mark Riley) a Johnny Cash tribute album, \"'Til Things are Brighter...\", to raise funds for the Terrence Higgins Trust. The album was endorsed and admired by Cash himself who is featured alongside Langford and Riley on its cover. \n\nLangford is an honorary board member of the Chicago-based nonprofit organisation Rock for Kids.\n\nLangford produced \"The Executioner's Last Songs, Vols. 1, 2, & 3\" record compilations to benefit charitable organizations working to end the death penalty (Artists Against the Death Penalty, the Illinois Death Penalty Moratorium Project, and the National Coalition To Abolish the Death Penalty). In 2006, Langford was commissioned to develop a performance based on the compilations for the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago; the show was also performed at the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis.\n\nLangford is married to architect and jewelry designer, Helen Tsatsos. Tsatsos' jewelry was awarded Macy's \"Designer of Distinction\" award in 2010 and has a line of pieces that incorporate Langford's artwork. Langford met his wife in 1986 at a party after a gig in her home town of Chicago. They currently live in Chicago and have two children, Jame and Tommy. Jame Langford is a clothing designer and, while in high school, was in a band called the Ungnomes; Tommy is a songwriter and lead singer in a band called Mock Nine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Hart was one of the pivotal driving forces behind what is considered to be World Class Championship Wrestling's \"golden years\" in the early 1980s.\n\nGary Hart started out as a wrestler in 1960 in Chicago at the Marigold Arena. His uncle, Billy Gates, was a booking agent for Chicago promoter Fred Kohler. After Chicago, he worked in Detroit until 1964. He then worked on and off in Australia under Jim Barnett until 1974 when he relocated with Barnett to Atlanta becoming involved in Georgia Championship Wrestling. After Georgia, he worked in Florida in 1975 managing Pak Song Nam.\n\nIn the late 1960s, he became a manager called \"Playboy\" Gary Hart. During the late 1960s, he managed The Spoiler, as well as the tag team duo The Spoilers, which consisted of Spoilers #1 (Don Jardine) and #2 (Smasher Sloan). They won several tag team titles in 1968 and 1969 under Hart's guidance.\n\nOn February 20, 1975, Hart and wrestlers Austin Idol and Bobby Shane were passengers on a Cessna 182 flown by wrestler Buddy Colt, which crashed into Tampa Bay in Florida, killing Shane.\n\nHart became the booker for World Class Championship Wrestling (WCCW; then known as Big Time Wrestling) in 1976, a position he held until January 1983, then again from 1986-1988. The years between 1982 and 1985 are considered to be the \"Golden Years\" of the promotion. Hart created the classic feud between the Von Erichs and the Fabulous Freebirds, as well as forming The Stable of H. & H. Ltd in 1982 with Arman Hussian that introduced characters (Bugsy McGraw, Bill Irwin, Checkmate, Killer Brooks and Ten Gu), he also managed The Great Kabuki, the One Man Gang and the Samoan Swat Team. Hart additionally managed talent such as \"Gorgeous\" Gino Hernandez and Gentleman Chris Adams. Along with booking, he also managed Nord the Barbarian, Abdullah The Butcher, Al Perez and Jeep Swenson under the stable \"New Age Management\".\n\nDuring World Class' golden era, Hart was also a manager in the Georgia and Mid-Atlantic regions of the NWA; joining these two areas exclusively in 1983 shortly after the start of the Freebirds-Von Erichs feud, when he left World Class due to a pay dispute. Hart returned to Texas in the summer of 1984 and following a short hiatus in 1986; stayed with the promotion until 1988. Hart was also a promoter and manager in San Antonio for Texas All-Star Wrestling, the successor of Joe Blanchard's Southwest Championship Wrestling (SCW) group. He also worked for the ICW, first as the heel manager of Bruiser Brody, Kevin Sullivan and Mark Lewin. During one storyline, Hart had a falling out with Sullivan, after which Lewin attacked Hart with a sleeper hold.\n\nShortly after the folding of WCCW, Hart continued to manage Al Perez in the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA)'s Jim Crockett Promotions in 1988, along with Larry Zbyszko. In 1989, he managed the stable J-Tex Corporation, which included Terry Funk, Dick Slater, Buzz Sawyer, The Dragonmaster, and The Great Muta. They feuded primarily with Ric Flair and Sting, but Ole and Arn Anderson later teamed up with Flair and Sting to even the sides up (and thus bringing back The Four Horseman briefly). J-Tex disbanded in early 1990.\n\nAfter leaving WCW, Hart returned to Texas and began a new wrestling promotion in North Dallas, the Texas Wrestling Federation, which showcased many former stars of World Class and those who are competing in the USWA/World Class promotion.\n\nDuring the 1990s, following the demise of the Global Wrestling Federation, Hart and Chris Adams were involved in many Texas-based wrestling promotions, including an ill-fated attempt to revive World Class (billed as World Class II: The Next Generation) at the Dallas Sportatorium. Hart retired in 1999, but made a surprise return in Major League Wrestling (MLW), during the promotion's \"Reloaded Tour\" on January 9–10, 2004. Hart appeared following the main event (on January 9) pitting Low Ki against Homicide, where the three laid out several wrestlers from the locker room, as well MLW president Court Bauer.\n\nHart died on March 16, 2008, following a heart attack at his home in Euless, Texas, after returning from an autograph session in Pennsylvania. On April 5, 2008, Peach State Pandemonium, an internet wrestling program, aired a two-hour tribute program in the memory of Hart. From Tulsa, Oklahoma Kris Thorn, \"Cowboy\" Bill Watts, Jack Brisco, James Beard, Abdullah The Butcher, Michael \"P.S.\" Hayes, Kevin Sullivan, George Steele, Skandor Akbar, and Jim Ross were among those who attended.

The team finished a respectable 6-6 in their inaugural season, but missed the playoffs on a tie-breaker. Following the season, losses of $250,000 forced owner Chris Fritz to look for partners. Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment considered purchasing the team, but ultimately a group which included Bill Watters, the then Assistant General Manager of the Toronto Maple Leafs, Paul Beeston, former president of the Toronto Blue Jays, Tie Domi, player for the Maple Leafs, and Bobby Orr, former NHL player, bought it for $250,000 and promptly relocated the team to Toronto's Maple Leaf Gardens where they rebranded it the Toronto Rock.\n\n"}

In many places wynds link streets at different heights and thus are mostly thought of as being ways up or down hills.\n\nThere are many wynds in North Yorkshire and County Durham, such as \"Bull Wynd\" in Darlington and Lombards Wynd in Richmond, North Yorkshire.\n\nThe Old Town of Edinburgh had many wynds, such as St. Mary's Wynd, Blackfriars Wynd and Niddry Wynd, until Victorian street improvements in the 19th century led to their being widened and renamed \"streets\".\nWynds feature prominently in the city centre of Aberdeen, a testament to the medieval street pattern in the city’s past. Before the levelling of St. Catherine’s Hill and the construction of Union Street, Back Wynd served as the main thoroughfare to and from The Green, the main point of entry into the city of Aberdeen in the early 1500s. Another medieval wynd still existing in the city centre, Correction Wynd, was built to link the top half of the city to its lower half. \n\nIn the East Neuk fishing village of Pittenweem in Fife, all walking connections between the shore and the raised beach—apart from the road down to the harbour—are wynds, namely: West Wynd, Calman's Wynd, Bruce's Wynd, School Wynd, Water Wynd and Cove Wynd.\n\nOn North Carolina’s Bald Head Island the main roads are referred to as wynds, such as North, South and West, Bald Head Wynd and Stede Bonnet Wynd and Edward Teach Wynd.\n"}

Thomas and Sibyl Addenbrooke. He had two younger brothers, John and David. His father, a Presbyterian minister who was ethnically Welsh, and his mother, a schoolteacher who was ethnically English, stressed the importance of reading, education, and memorization to their son. Thomas says that his father stressed mental images as an important speaking tool. For example, he told his son if he were talking about horses he had to picture horses in his mind.\n\nThomas began his career at 14 as an announcer on a local radio show. Since the station could not pay him due to his age, they arranged for the sponsor, Piper Aircraft, to give him flying lessons in a Piper Cub. Within just a few years, Thomas would be hosting Big Band remotes.\n\nWith the onset of World War II, Thomas left The Stony Brook School and volunteered for the United States Army in 1943, after being offered an Armed Forces Radio deferment, and served with the First Infantry Division in five major campaigns, including the Battle of Normandy and the Battle of the Bulge. He was issued a Battle star for each of the five campaigns. He was also awarded the Bronze Star, the Purple Heart, the Unit French Croix de guerre, and Belgian Fourragère.\n\nThomas received many awards for his work but cited, as one of his best, the Oscar won by a documentary he narrated, \"One Survivor Remembers\".

She was beatified by the Catholic Church for the holiness of her life. Her feast day is 7 February.\n\nShe was born Jeanne-Marie Rendu on 9 September 1786, in Confort, France, not far from Geneva. The eldest of four girls, she came from a family of small property owners which enjoyed a certain affluence and respect throughout the area. She was baptized the day she was born in the parish church of Lancrans. Her godfather by proxy was Jacques Emery, a family friend and future Superior General of the Society of Saint-Sulpice (Sulpicians) in Paris.\n\nRendu was three years old when the Revolution broke out. Starting in 1790 it was compulsory for the clergy to take an oath of support for the Civil Constitution of the Clergy. Numerous priests, faithful to the Church, refused to take this oath. They were driven from their parishes, with some being put to death and others having to hide to escape their pursuers. The Rendu family home became a refuge for these priests, some fleeing to Switzerland. The Bishop of Annecy found asylum there under the assumed name of Pierre. Jeanne-Marie was fascinated by this hired hand who was treated better than the others. One night she discovered that he was celebrating a Mass.\n\nIt was in this atmosphere of faith, exposed to the dangers of denunciation, that Rendu was educated. She made her First Communion one night by candlelight in the basement of her home. This exceptional environment forged her character.\n\nThe death of her father, 12 May 1796, and that of her youngest sister, at four months of age, on 19 July of the same year, shook the entire family. Rendu, aware of her responsibility as the eldest, helped her mother, especially in caring for her younger sisters.\n\nMadame Rendu, concerned about the education of her eldest daughter, sent her to the Ursuline Sisters in Gex. Jeanne Marie stayed two years in this boarding school. She was \"highly intelligent\" but her education was essentially practical. During her walks in town, she discovered the hospital where the Daughters of Charity cared for the sick. She had only one desire, to go and join them. Her mother gave her consent that Jeanne-Marie, in spite of her young age, might spend some time at this hospital. There she gained some experience in caring for the sick.\n\nHaving decided to join the Daughters of Charity, on 25 May 1802, Rendu arrived at the Motherhouse on the Rue du Vieux Colombier in Paris. She was nearly 17 years old. The reopening of the novitiate (suppressed by the Revolutionaries) took place in December 1800. On their arrival, the travelers were welcomed by fifty young women in formation. Upon entering the community, she was given the name of Rosalie.\n\nAs a young sister, Rendu suffered from a delicate constitution that was weakened by the sustained seclusion required of the novices, and by a lack of physical exercise. On the advice of her physician and that of her godfather, the Abbé Emery, Rendu was sent to house of the Daughters of Charity on Rue des Francs-Bourgeois-Saint-Marcel in the Mouffetard District. She remained there 54 years.\n\nAt the time, it was one of the most impoverished districts of the quickly expanding capital, with poverty in all its forms, psychological and spiritual. The houses were dilapidated and damp, the streets narrow and squalid, with refuse-filled streams running across them. She made her \"apprenticeship\" accompanying sisters visiting the sick and the poor. Between times, she taught catechism and reading to little girls accepted at the free school. In 1807, Rendu, surrounded by the Sisters of her Community, made vows for the first time to serve God and the poor.\n\nIn 1815 Rendu became the Sister Servant (local religious superior) of the community at the Rue des Francs-Bourgeois. Two years later the community would move to the Rue de l'Épée de Bois for reasons of space and convenience. \"Her poor,\" as she would call them, became more and more numerous during this troubled time. She worked with the Department of Welfare established by the Napoleonic government, administering a program that provided vouchers for coal and food. She sent her Sisters into all the hidden recesses of St. Médard Parish in order to bring supplies, clothing, care and a comforting word.\n\nShe dealt with the poor with great consideration, guessing that they are much more sensitive to the manner in which one helps them than to the help itself. \"One of the greatest ways of doing good to the poor\", she affirmed, \"is to show them respect and consideration.\" Rendu's example encouraged her Sisters. Rendu found her strength in a saying of the founder of the Daughter, Vincent de Paul: \"You will go and visit the poor ten times a day, and ten times a day you will find God there ... you go into their poor homes, but you find God there.\" Her prayer life was intense, as a Sister affirmed, \"... she continually lived in the presence of God.\"\n\nRendu was attentive to assuring that her companions had time for prayer, but sometimes there was a need to \"leave God for God\" as Vincent de Paul taught his Daughters. Once, while accompanying a Sister on a charitable visit, she said to her: \"Sister, let's begin our meditation!\" She suggested the plan, the outline, in a few simple, clear words and entered into prayer. Like a monk in the cloister, Rendu walked everywhere with her God. She would speak to God of this family in distress as the father no longer had any work, of this elderly person who risked dying alone in an attic: \"Never have I prayed so well as in the streets,\" she would say.\n\nSuperiors sent Rendu postulants and young Sisters to train. They put in her house, for a period of time, Sisters who were somewhat difficult or fragile. To one of her Sisters in crisis, she gave this advice one day, which is the secret of her life: \"If you want someone to love you, you must be the first to love; and if you have nothing to give, give yourself.\" As the number of Sisters increased, the charity office became a house of charity, with a clinic and a school. She saw in that the Providence of God.\n\nIn the outbreaks which followed the Revolution of 1830 Archbishop Quelen and other clergy took shelter at the Rue de l'Épée de Bois.\n\nTo assist all the suffering, Rendu opened a free clinic, a pharmacy, a school, a child and maternal care center, a youth club for young workers and a home for the elderly without resources. For young girls and needy mothers, Rendu soon organized courses in sewing and embroidering. Soon a whole network of charitable services would be established to counter poverty.\n\nRendu was very mindful of the manner of receiving the poor. Her spirit of faith saw in them our \"lords and masters.\" \"The poor will insult you. The ruder they are; the more dignified you must be,\" she said. \"Remember, Our Lord hides behind those rags.\" One of Rendu's companions remarked that, \"the poor themselves noted her way of praying and acting.\" \"Humble in her authority, Sr. Rosalie would correct us with great sensitivity and had the gift of consoling. Her advice, spoken justly and given with all her affection, penetrated souls.\"\n\nRendu's reputation quickly grew in all the districts of the capital and also beyond to the towns in the region. She knew how to surround herself with many efficient and dedicated collaborators. The donations flowed in quickly as the rich were unable to resist this persuasive woman. Even the former royalty did not forget her in their generosity. Bishops, priests, the Spanish Ambassador, King Charles X, the powerful General Louis-Eugène Cavaignac, and the most distinguished men of state and culture, even the Emperor Napoleon III with his wife, were often seen in her parlor.\n\nStudents of law, medicine, science, technology, engineering, teacher‑training, and all the other important schools came seeking from Rendu information and recommendations. Or, before performing a good work, they asked her at which door they should knock. Rendu became the center of a charitable movement that characterized Paris and France in the first half of the 19th century. Her experience was priceless for these young people. She directed their apostolate, guided their coming and going in the suburbs, and gave them addresses of families in need, choosing them with care. Afterwards, she facilitated discussion and apostolic reflection on their experiences among persons who were poor.\n\nHer cousin, Eugene Rendu, said wrote of her: \"Sister Rosalie’s principal character trait was her common sense, pushed to the point of genius.\" In 1833 began mentoring the first members of the Society of Saint Vincent de Paul. Among these, Frédéric Ozanam, founder of the \"Society of St. Vincent de Paul,\" and Jean Léon Le Prevost, future founder of the Religious of St. Vincent de Paul, knew well the road to her office. They came, with their other friends, to Rendu seeking advice for undertaking their projects.\n\nIn 1840 she helped re-establish the Ladies of Charity, who helped in the home visits. In 1851 she took over the running of an orphanage.\n\nRendu also formed a relationship with the Superior of Bon Saveur in Caen and requested that she too welcome those in need. She was particularly attentive to priests and religious suffering from psychiatric difficulties. Her correspondence is short but touching, considerate, patient and respectful towards all.\n\nHardships were not lacking in the Mouffetard District. Epidemics of cholera followed one after another. Lack of hygiene and poverty fostered its virulence. Most particularly in 1832 and 1846, the dedication shown and risks taken by Rendu and her Sisters were beyond imagination. The sisters attended to the living, accompanied the dying, and buried the dead. She herself was seen picking up dead bodies in the streets.\n\nIn February 1848, barricades and bloody battles were the marks of the opposition of the working class stirred up against the powerful. The Archbishop of Paris, Denis Auguste Affre, was killed trying to intervene between the fighting factions. Rendu was deeply grieved by this. She herself climbed the barricades to try to help the wounded fighters without considering their political loyalties in the fight. Without any fear, she risked her life in these confrontations. Her courage and sense of freedom commanded the admiration of all.\n\nWhen order was reestablished, Rendu tried to save a number of these people she knew and who were victims of fierce repression. She was helped a great deal by the mayor of the district, Dr. Ulysse Trélat, a true republican, who was also very popular.\n\nIn 1852, Napoleon III decided to give her the Grand Cross of the Legion of Honor. She was ready to refuse this individual honor but Jean-Baptiste Etienne, Superior General of the Congregation of the Mission and the Daughters of Charity, made her accept it.\n\nAlways in fragile health, Rendu never took a moment of rest, always managing to overcome fatigue and fevers. However, age, increasing infirmity, and the amount of work needing to be done eventually broke her strong resistance and equally strong will. During the last two years of her life she became progressively blind. She died on 7 February 1856 after a brief but acute illness.\n\nEmotions ran high in the district and at all levels of society in both Paris and the countryside. After the funeral rite at St. Médard Church, her parish, a large and emotional crowd followed her remains to the Montparnasse Cemetery. They came to show their respect for the works she had accomplished and show their affection for this “out of the ordinary” Sister.\n\nNumerous newspaper articles witnessed to the admiration and even veneration that Rendu received. Newspapers from all sides echoed the sentiments of the people.\n\n\"L'Univers\", the principal Catholic newspaper of the time, edited by Louis Veuillot, wrote as early as 8 February: “Our readers understand the significance of the sadness that has come upon the poor of Paris. They join their sufferings with the tears and prayers of the unfortunate.”\n\n\"Le Constitutionnel\", the newspaper of the anticlerical left, did not hesitate to announce the death of this Daughter of Charity: “The unfortunate people of the 12th district have just experienced a regrettable loss. Sr. Rosalie, Superior of the Community at rue de l'Epée de Bois died yesterday after a long illness. For many years this respectable woman was the salvation of the numerous needy in this district.”\n\nThe official newspaper of the Empire, \"le Moniteur Universel\", praised the kindly actions of this Sister: “Funeral honors were given to Sr. Rosalie with unusual splendor. For more than fifty years this holy woman was a friend to others in a district where there are many unfortunate people to care for and all these grateful people accompanied her remains to the church and to the cemetery. A guard of honor was part of the cortege.”\n\nMany visitors came to the cemetery to meditate and pray but had difficuly locating the common gravesite reserved for the Daughters of Charity. The body was then moved to a more accessible plot, close to the entrance of the cemetery. On the simple tomb surmounted by a large Cross are engraved these words: “To Sister Rosalie, from her grateful friends, the rich and the poor.” Flowers continue to be placed at her gravesite.\n\n"}

He became a very important player in Stoke's successful early 1970s side, helping the club win the League Cup in 1972. A left-back, he was renowned for being a tough player and was prone to being sent-off, and on one occasion was suspended for five matches. He broke his leg in February 1975, and in his absence City's genuine First Division title challenge fell away. He was sold to Everton for a £135,000 fee in February 1977, where he played three seasons before joining Aston Villa in 1979. He retired due to injury in 1980.\n\nHe later managed Leek Town, Northwich Victoria, Chester City, and Malaysian side Selangor FA, and also coached Port Vale from 1986 to 1992. In the late 2000s he coached at Plymouth Argyle and Ipswich Town.\n\nPejic was born in Chesterton in Newcastle-under-Lyme and supported Stoke City from an early age. His father, a Serbian immigrant miner from Yugoslavia, took him to watch the matches at the Victoria Ground. In his teenage years Pejic was playing for Newcastle-under-Lyme schools as a left-winger and signed professional forms with Stoke in 1967, where manager Tony Waddington took the decision to convert him into a left-back. After two years in the reserves he made his debut against West Ham United at Upton Park, helping Stoke keep a clean sheet against World Cup winner Geoff Hurst. He took over from the disappointing Alex Elder and established himself in the first team. Pejic was a strong athlete with a sweet left foot and was compactly built at 5 ft 8in. Pejic was a 'hard player' and was a strong tackler who enjoyed letting his opposing winger know he was around with a scything tackle. He was a fitness fanatic who, unlike many of his Stoke teammates had another job outside of football, as he kept a farm near Leek.\n\nHe became a regular in the Stoke squad in 1969–70 and the early seasons in the 1970s. Stoke enjoyed a successful period, reaching the semi-final of the FA Cup twice and winning their first major trophy – the League Cup – in 1972. He played the whole ninety minutes of the final, as the \"Potters\" beat Chelsea 2–1 at Wembley thanks to goals from Terry Conroy and George Eastham. During two seasons, 1970–71 and 1971–72, Pejic played in over 100 senior matches. He earned a call up to the England national side in 1974, playing in four matches, but lost his place to Liverpool's Alec Lindsay. During his time at Stoke Pejic was prone to being sent-off and was once suspended for five matches by the FA. He broke his leg in February 1975, and injuries to three other key players caused Stoke's bid for the First Division title in 1974–75 to fall away to a fifth-place finish. In January 1976, the Butler Street stand roof at the Victoria Ground collapsed after a powerful storm gripped the area. To cover the costs the club had to sell their most valuable players and Pejic joined Everton for £135,000.\n\nUnder the stewardship of Gordon Lee, the \"Toffees\" finished in ninth place in 1976–77. They also reached the League Cup Final, but lost to Aston Villa at Old Trafford without Pejic in the team. He did though play 46 games in the 1977–78 season, as Everton finished third in the league. At Goodison Park, Pejic again suffered a broken leg this time against Leeds United in December 1978, and was limited to 26 appearances in the 1978–79 season.\n\nHe was replaced by John Bailey at Everton and in 1980 he joined Ron Saunders's Aston Villa. But injuries again took their toll and he was limited to 12 appearances in the 1979–80 season before he decided to retire at Villa Park in 1980.\n\nPejic won eight caps for the England under-23 team, before Sir Alf Ramsey handed him his full England debut in a friendly against Portugal in Lisbon on 3 April 1974; the game finished 0–0. After appearances against Wales and Northern Ireland, he won his fourth and final cap on 18 May 1974, in a 2–0 defeat to Scotland at Hampden Park that left England to share the 1973–74 British Home Championship. Ramsey's successor, Joe Mercer, dropped him in favour of Alec Lindsay.\n\nPejic took charge at North West Counties League side Leek Town, and led the \"Blues\" to a ninth-place finish in 1984–85. His stay at Harrison Park was brief, as he resigned to take over as manager of Northwich Victoria. He took the \"Vics\" to a 16th-place finish in the Alliance Premier League in 1985–86.\n\nHe was appointed youth coach at Port Vale in July 1986, being promoted to first team coach in December 1987. He helped manager John Rudge to lead the club to promotion in 1988–89. However, he was sacked in March 1992, twelve months later an employment tribunal ruled that he had been unfairly dismissed and Vale were forced to pay a four-figure compensation sum.\n\nPejic was named Chester City manager in June 1994 after the shock resignation of Graham Barrow. He inherited a very bare side after the loss of several key players, and an immediate relegation back to Third Division was inevitable after the side began the 1994–95 season without a point from their first seven games. Pejic was sacked in January 1995 after a 4–0 thrashing by York City at the Deva Stadium. He returned to Leek Town as caretaker-manager in 1998, before the appointment of Ernie Moss.\n\nHe went on to be the regional director for the North East FA and has coached such stars as Jermain Defoe, Aaron Lennon and Stewart Downing. He then taught FA coaching courses at NWHC in Nuneaton. In 1999, he managed Malaysian side Selangor FA. He also coached in Zimbabwe and Kuwait. In February 2007, he became Head of Youth Coaching at Championship side Plymouth Argyle. In June 2010 he left Argyle to take up a similar position at Ipswich Town. On 14 November 2010, Pejic was suspended from his coaching role at Ipswich Town after allegations of bullying.\n\nHe took up the martial art of taekwondo at the age of 62 and earned a place in the national team for the over 60 age group. He married Marilyn, sister of singer Jackie Trent, in June 2017. In April 2019, he became the over 65's Taekwondo European champion after winning the gold medal in Antalya, Turkey.\n\nPejic married in December 1970 and again in April 1991. He married his third wife, Marilyn – younger sister of singer Jackie Trent, in August 2017. His younger brother, Mel, played for Stoke City, Hereford United and Wrexham. Shaun Pejic, the son of Mel and nephew of Mike, was in the Wales under-21 team. Pejic worked as a co-commentator on Stoke City matches for local radio station for Signal 1. He also writes a column about Stoke in the Saturday edition of \"The Sentinel\".\n\nSource:\n\nSource:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1897714", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1897714", "title": "Korean ruling class", "text": "Korean ruling class\n\nThe Korean ruling class refers to persons in contemporary South Korean society known for holding multiple offices in government, education, and the chaebol, stressing degrees from elite (especially American) universities, and reserving important positions for one another and their family members. According to social theory, this class protects and perpetuates itself by valuing family background, prestigious education, loyalty to friends/classmates/hometown, and chaebol wealth, while those excluded from the class are unable to access these prerequisites for class membership. Leaders of admired institutions, such as Samsung, are often insulated from criticism, but there is occasionally popular backlash against the perceived abuses of the elite class, such as the 2014 Korean Air \"nut rage\" scandal. \n\nThe idea of a contemporary Korean ruling class has an important basis in the historical stratification of Korean society, but the exact function of the historical connection is a topic of debate. Prior to the 20th century, the dynastic traditions of Confucianism and the historical legacy of the yangban shaped the Korean aristocracy. On the one hand, the parallels can be seen today in the prestige of elite educational credentials, the wealth of landowners in South Korea's tight real estate market, as well as Confucian ideals of paternalism and loyalty to social connections formed during youth. On the other hand, the parallels are at best symbolic and at worst misleading. As a result of over 35 years of Japanese occupation and the subsequent Korean war, the older Korean polity and its traditions were broken off.\n\nAs monastic orders did during the Europe's Middle Ages, the Buddhist monks became the purveyors and guardians of Korea's literary traditions while documenting Korea's written history and legacies from the Silla period to the end of the Goryeo dynasty. Korean buddhist monks also developed and used the first movable metal type printing presses in history—some 50 years before Gutenberg—to print ancient buddhist texts. Buddhist monks also engaged in record keeping, food storage and distribution, as well as the ability to exercise power by influencing the Goryeo royal court.\n\nThe bone rank system was the system of aristocratic rank used in the ancient Korean kingdom of Silla. It was used to segregate society, and particularly the layers of the aristocracy, on the basis of their hereditary proximity to the throne and the level of authority they were permitted to wield.The idea of royal blood in other societies is a close analogue to the idea of sacred bone in Silla thought. Bone rank was strictly hereditary, and thus acted as a caste system.\n\nThe yangban Confucian scholars grew to prominence during the Joseon dynasty period. From the late 14th century onwards, the \"yangban\" class formed the administrative backbone of the Korean nation. They occupied the highest echelon of social caste system.\n\nThe annexation of Korea by Japan from 1905 to 1945 ushered in not only a harsh colonial period wherein the Japanese took over and dominated every aspect of Korea's sociopolitical, cultural and economic life, it created a demand for Koreans skilled in working alongside the Japanese as petty bureaucrats, minor officials, junior administrators, clerks and low-level public officials such as policemen, station masters, railroad engineers, and army officers. This fostered the need and creation of a skilled indigenous workforce trained and schooled in Japanese ways and methods. Although small in number, this elite group of Koreans represented the first generation of Korean yuhaksaeng(유학생), or overseas students, to be sent abroad for foreign study. From 1910 to 1945 these Koreans studied mostly in Japan's best high schools and universities, especially Tokyo Imperial University. While many overseas Korean students were forcibly conscripted into the Imperial Japanese Army to fight against the allies, many survived the war mostly by being able to evade routine roundups by the Japanese police, usually with the help of sympathetic Japanese teachers and mentors. After Korea's liberation from Japan on August 15, 1945, they immediately were called upon to form Korea's first provisional government in conjunction with a U.S.-administered trusteeship. As they represented the only class of Koreans who were capable of administering the newly formed Republic of Korea upon its establishment in 1948, they became the de facto inheritors of the Japanese colonial system and founders of the first sovereign Korean state in modern times. Among their ranks were a generation's worth of Japanese-trained and educated bureaucrats, administrators, technocrats, military and business leaders, e.g., Park Chung-hee, Lee Byung-chul, etc. In toto, these trailblazers who were educated in Japan during the colonial period, became the founding members of the Republic of Korea as well as movers and shakers in Korean politics and business all the way up till the late 1980s. Collectively, this generation is called the Japanese Generation.\n\nAfter the Korean war and by the 1960s, a new generation of heavy manufacturing millionaires and soon to be billionaires came into being.\n\n\nKorea's first group of business, political and academic elites was the Japanese Generation, or specifically, those Koreans born during the waning days of the Joseon dynasty or the early years of the colonial period, who were trained and educated exclusively in Japan at elite universities and military academies during the Japanese colonial period from 1910 to 1945. This first generation of Korean overseas students, who as returnees to their native country after Korea's liberation from Japan in 1945, were called upon to form the first sovereign Korean state in modern history. Their studies in administration, agriculture and engineering and other subjects that the Japanese had deemed useful in the creation of a Korean administrative sub-class, were quickly put to use in filling the administrative void and power vacuum left behind by the departing Japanese colonial government.\n\nBy quickly assuming key technical and administrative positions in South Korea's fledgling government and bureaucracy, as well as assuming leadership in its post-colonial military and police force at the behest of U.S. trusteeship, Korea's Japanese Generation proved themselves as quick learners adept at jump starting Korea's ancient tradition of self-rule. These Koreans were also instrumental in forming, creating and leading Korea's post-war governmental institutions and driving its export-oriented economy well into the 1990s.\n\nToday, near the end of the first decade of the 21st century, while a majority of the Japanese Generation has long since retired or passed on, their legacy continues to drive Korea's sociopolitical and economic scene for the time being, albeit less and less so. Meanwhile, increasing numbers of overseas educated Koreans—this time trained in the West and fluent in English—continue to return to Korea after their studies in overwhelming numbers seeking commensurate positions in Korea's public and private sector in order to establish their own imprimatur on Korean society based on their own experiences and learning acquired during their stints abroad as students studying at some of the best universities in America and Europe.\n\nThe overall impact of such disparate experiences in terms of influencing Korea's sociopolitical geography and economic millieu for the future is debatable though, as the current generation differs substantially from its predecessors. Specifically, Korea's current generation, although better educated and more privileged in many respects, lack a defining and unifying experience for their generation. The Japanese Generation, on the other hand was largely successful in terms of acting as Korea's legitimate power elites because they were able to quickly coalesce by capitalizing on the defining and unifying experience of their generation, which was the strong resentment of Korea's poverty and low status attributed to Japanese colonization and the Korean War. As a result, that generation felt an overwhelming obligation to put Korea on the right track at all costs, in order to prevent another return to an abysmal state.\n\nTechnocrats with degrees in the sciences or engineering have mostly been subsumed in power and influence in the political process, but have contributed to great success in the larger manufacturing combines, energy and resource cartels, \"chaebols\", and cross-linked industries.\n\nBy 2005, a new ruling elite spurred by telecommunications and the internet had come into being: and English studies abroad fell, with a new class of elite studying in China, and planning on extensive business dealings with China upon graduation. At the same time because of the similarity of the Turkic languages to Korean, there have been extensive links with Mongolia launching new elites who will base their fortunes upon export and development in this region.\n\nThere is currently no published Korean rich list, despite the Wikipedia entry, but Forbes and other chroniclers of the power elites of the world have found sufficient high profile rich in Korea as to generate accurate numbers.\n\nForbes magazine has hinted at Korea having at the very least 7 high billionaires living on the peninsula, and at least ten families alone who control in the high billions in assets. There are possibly another 5 Korean billionaires abroad, mostly in the USA who maintain dual citizenship.\n\nLow billionaire families are generally accepted to number more than 10 and less than 20; while domestic newspapers have indicated that there are at least 100 families who have more than $250 million in assets: primarily real estate and land being developed; or in manufacturing who have a high enough profile as to be reasonably defined as amongst the very wealthy of the world.\n\nEstimates on the number of Koreans who own more than a million US dollars in assets apart from their houses, and discarding all debts, are figured to be in the range of 65,000 high-net-worth individuals (HNWI) according to Merrill Lynch research by June 16, 2004.

He appeared in almost every issue until #41 (April 1944). \n\nThe character was revived in the Modern Age in \"Femforce\" #59, by AC Comics, and in \"Tom Strong\" #11, by Alan Moore and Chris Sprouse.\n\nHis secret identity is Professor Archibald (Archie) Masters, an astronomy professor at an unnamed university in the Eastern United States.\n\nThe character debuted in 1941, his mousy alter-ego being similar to that of Superman's Clark Kent identity. He accidentally got caught in a room with a device called an atom smasher, and, inevitably, the experiment went awry. Instead of killing him, the accident blasted him with radiation, which endowed him with various superhuman abilities. He used these powers to fight crime as the American Crusader.\n\nCribbed from Superman's relationship with Lois Lane, Prof. Masters has a secretary named Jane Peters, who despised the professor but idolized the hero. The Crusader also briefly has a teen sidekick named Mickey Martin.\n\nHis enemies include Nazis, mad scientists, and Nazi mad scientists, as well as Nazi zombies.\n\nThe Crusader appeared in the following titles in the Golden Age:\n\nThe American Crusader, along with other heroes from Nedor Comics, was revived by AC Comics through the Vault of Heroes, a suspended animation program for superheroes. He later joined the Sentinels of Justice.\n\nThe American Crusader, along with other heroes from Nedor Comics, was revived by Alan Moore in his series \"Tom Strong\". This revival set the characters on a parallel world called Terra Obscura, which was also the title of the resulting mini-series.\n\nThe Crusader apparently (from a Terra Obscura continuity standpoint) operated as a superhero until 1969, when, on a mission to stop an alien from converting Earth into a spaceship, he was imprisoned in an alien restraining device which Tom Strong imagined to be a heavily localized time-loop. This bubble kept him in suspended animation until he was freed in 2000 by Strong and his fellow SMASH member, Tom Strange.\n\nWithin the Terra Obscura continuity, he is an alcoholic, currently seeking help for his addiction. He operates with the modern incarnation of SMASH.\n\nThe American Crusader made a brief appearance in the prose story \"Living Legends\", published by Metahuman Press.

He is kept imprisoned and unconscious by a totalitarian government, and clones called Crusaders are created from his DNA to function as super-powered soldiers.\n\nIn the related \"Black Terror\" series, the Black Terror finds Archie and helps him to lure the Crusaders and destroy them, using the last of Archie's energy in the process.

The core products of Wärtsilä include technologies for the energy sector, including gas, multi-fuel, liquid fuel and biofuel power plants and energy storage systems; and technologies for the marine sector, including cruise ships, ferries, fishing vessels, merchant ships, navy ships, special vessels, tugs, yachts and offshore vessels. Ship design capabilities include ferries, tugs, and vessels for the fishing, merchant, offshore and special segments. Services offerings include online services, underwater services, turbocharger services, and also services for the marine, energy, and oil and gas markets. At the end of June 2018, the company employed more than 19,000 workers.\n\nWärtsilä has two main businesses; Energy Business focusing on the energy market, and Marine Business focusing on the marine market. The Marine Business is mainly present in Europe, China and East Asia, while its key Energy Business markets are South and South East Asia, Middle East, Africa and Latin America. Wärtsilä has locations in around 80 countries but operates globally.\n\nThe company has signaled its intention to transform from an equipment maker to a Smart Marine and Energy company, following acquisitions of companies such as Transas, Greensmith, Guidance Marine, and MSI, and the setting up of Digital Acceleration Centres in Helsinki, Singapore, Central Europe, and North America.\n\nWärtsilä was established when the governor of the county of North Karelia approved the construction of a sawmill in the municipality of Tohmajärvi, Finland on 12 April 1834. The sawmill was soon taken over by industrialist Nils Ludvig Arppe, who built ironworks in the premises. In 1898 the company was renamed Wärtsilä Ab.\n\nIn 1938 the diesel engine era began when Wärtsilä signed a licence agreement with Friedrich Krupp Germania Werft AG in Germany. The first diesel engine was produced in Turku, Finland in November 1942. During the following decades more focus was put on manufacturing diesel and gas engines with the acquisitions of the Swedish firm NOHAB in 1978, the French Société Alsacienne de Constructions Mécaniques (SACM), and the Dutch Stork-Werkspoor in 1989.\n\nIn 1997 Wärtsilä absorbed the diesel motor producing New Sulzer Diesel (NSD), having been created by Sulzer in 1990.\n\nIn 2020, Wärtsilä made plans to supply hybrid engine solutions for the ultra environmentally friendly Finnlines\n\nThrough acquisitions of marine propulsion systems supplier John Crane-Lips in 2002, marine automation company Total Automation in 2006, specialist equipment company Hamworthy in 2012 and L-3 Marine Systems International in 2014, Wärtsilä expanded their portfolio considerably.\n\nThe company services the merchant, offshore, cruise and ferry, naval, fishing, tugs, yachts and special vessel markets, and the offering includes ship design, main and auxiliary engines, auxiliary power systems, electrical and automation packages, propulsors (such as water jets, thrusters, propellers, and nozzles), seals, bearings, gears, rudders, scrubbers, boilers, and all related services, such as repair, configuration, upgrading, training, maintenance, and environmental services.\n\nCustomers comprise both shipyards and ship owners. The environmental products range from reduction of air emissions, such as NOx, SOx, CO, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), to oily waste water treatment and other water systems such as ballast water management systems.\n\nWärtsilä Marine was an important Finnish shipbuilder from 1935 until 1989, building cruiseferries, cruise ships and a large share of the icebreakers of the world. The former Wärtsilä Marine Turku Shipyard is now owned by Meyer Werft under its Meyer Turku subsidiary and the Helsinki shipyard is operated by Arctech.\n\nWärtsilä is a provider of power plants in distributed and flexible power generation. The product portfolio consists of installations up to 600 MW, running on any gaseous or liquid fuels, such as Heavy fuel oil, natural gas, liquefied natural gas (LNG), different types and qualities of fuel oils, and renewable fuels like biogas and biofuel. In addition for the reliability of traditional base power generation, the engines have the capability to start and stop quickly and they maintain their efficiency in part load, which makes them well suited for peaking power production, smart grids, and emergency power systems. They can also utilize the combined cycle and cogeneration to produce steam or hot water for heating, and trigeneration for chilled water, which can be used for air conditioning.\n\nWärtsilä also provides products and services for grid stability management, utilization of gas flares, pumping applications (such as pump and compression drives), financial services, and project management services for projects concerning power generation.\n\nIn May 2017, Wärtsilä signed an agreement to acquire Greensmith Energy Management Systems Inc.\n\nIn March 2018, the company announced that it had delivered the world's largest solar hybrid power plant], situated in Burkina Faso.\n\nWärtsilä provides about 25 percent of Bangladesh's total grid capacity, with the company's total power supply to Bangladesh rising to more than 4200 MW when a 105MW power plant being built by Baraka Shikalbaha Power Ltd goes fully operational in spring 2019.\n\nWärtsilä's wide energy products and systems footprint includes the US, Germany, the UK, China, Russia, Singapore, Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Myanmar, Senegal, the Dominican Republic, Australia, Saudi Arabia, Tanzania, Morocco, Argentina, Sierra Leone, Brazil, Finland, Mauritius, Rwanda, Honduras, El Salvador, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Jordan and Oman.\n\nThe wholly owned service network consist of over 4,500 field services professionals in more than 160 locations in over 70 countries globally, with the installed base of over 180 000 MW. The focus lies on optimising operations and life cycle performance of land based power plants and ship installations.\n\nWärtsilä provides services, spare parts, maintenance, upgrades, and fuel conversions products for medium and low-speed gas and diesel engines and other related systems, propulsion systems, electrical & automation systems, boilers including environmental solutions regarding particulates and NOx, covering scrubber, selective catalytic reduction (SCRs), oxidation catalysts, ballast water treatment systems and oily-water systems, long-term service agreements, training, condition monitoring, and condition-based maintenance and advisory services.\n\nIn January 2017, Wärtsilä and Carnival Corporation announced a 12-year performance-based agreement worth 900 million euros.\nAcquisitions in the Services business include Eniram in 2016, Trident B.V in 2017, and Lock-N-Stich.\n\nOn October 1, 2018 Wärtsilä announced that it would reorganize into two business areas, incorporating the Services business into the existing Marine and Energy businesses.\n\nAt the end of 2017, Wärtsilä's market share in marine medium-speed main engines was 47% and in auxiliary engines 10%. Wärtsilä's market share for gas and liquid fuel power plants was 19%.\n\nWärtsilä's biggest competitors in the marine market are MAN Diesel & Turbo, Caterpillar Inc. and Rolls-Royce plc. and in the energy market the biggest competitors are mainly gas turbine manufacturers like General Electric and Siemens.\n\nWärtsilä produces a wide range of medium-speed diesel, gas and dual- and multi-fuel engines for marine propulsion, electricity generation on board ships and for land-based power stations.\n\nA joint venture agreement between Wärtsilä and China State Shipbuilding Corporation (CSSC) for the take-over of Wärtsilä's 2-stroke engine business was announced in July 2014 and finalized in January 2015.\n\nThe engine models are generally identified by the cylinder bore diameter in centimeters, which range from for medium-speed and for low-speed engines. The smallest engine series, four-stroke medium-speed Wärtsilä 20, produces a modest per cylinder while the largest, two-stroke low-speed Wärtsilä RT-flex96C, has a maximum output of per cylinder. In addition, Wärtsilä also produces the most powerful medium-speed engine series in the world, Wärtsilä 64, with an output of per cylinder. Depending on the engine model, Wärtsilä offers medium-speed engines in both straight and V configurations with the number of cylinders ranging from four (4L20) to twenty (20V46F), and low-speed engines in inline configuration with five (5RT-flex35) to fourteen cylinders (14RT-flex96C). The most powerful low-speed engine ever produced by Wärtsilä, a 14-cylinder version of the RT-flex96C, produces and is used to propel the Mærsk E-class container ships.\n\nIn 2015, the Wärtsilä 31 engine achieved a Guinness World Records title for the most efficient 4-stroke diesel engine.\n\nWärtsilä revealed manipulation of fuel consumption tests after an internal audit in 2016, with a few hundred engines affected. According to the company, the customer impact of the deviations was marginal.\n\nKey figures of Jan-Dec 2018:\n\nAll numbers are shown excluding non-recurring items and selling profits.\n\n\n"}

In 2011, Ibrahim, along with his D-Company, was number three on the FBI's \"World's 10 Most Wanted Fugitives\" list.\n\nDawood Ibrahim established a criminal syndicate in 1970s India.\n\nOther prominent members of the gang include Chhota Shakeel, Tiger Memon, Yakub Memon (linked), Abu Salem and Fazlur rahman . The organization has a history of rivalry with the Mumbai police and other underworld dons such as Chhota Rajan, Ejaz Lakdawala, who was arrested in Canada in 2004, and Arun Gawli.\n\nIn the 1970s, Dawood Ibrahim worked for a local smuggler named Bashu Dada. Bashu Dada had a close friendship with Dawood's father, who was a police constable. His father wielded immense clout among the gangsters and common people due to his sense of morality and justice, while also being a part of the Crime Branch. However, Bashu Dada and Dawood had a falling-out after Bashu Dada insulted the latter's father. In 1976, Dawood — along with seven of his close friends and his elder brother Shabir Ibrahim Kaskar — attacked Basu Dada with empty soda bottles, a first in the history of gang warfare in Bombay.\n\nAfter this incident Bashu Dada's key enforcer Khalid Pehlwan persuaded Dawood to start his smuggling operations, which led to the formation of the D Company. Dawood and his elder brother Shabir, with the help of Khalid Pehlwan, began their smuggling operations. This ultimately led them to clash with the Pathan gang, the most influential gang in Mumbai at the time. By 1986, D Company had eliminated most of the Pathan gang leadership, emerging as the dominant gang in Mumbai.\n\nIn 1993, D-Company associates were accused of organizing the 1993 Bombay bombings. , although Dawood denies any involvement to this day.\n\nIn 1997, D-Company former member Abu Salem and Fazlur Rahman was responsible for the murder of T-Series founder and Bollywood music producer Gulshan Kumar.\n\nIn 2011, Indian intelligence agencies managed to link Dawood Company with the 2G spectrum case, through DB Realty and DB Etisalat (formerly Swan Telecom) promoted by Shahid Balwa. Later in March, security at CBI headquarters in Delhi was tightened after it had been suggested that D-Company might launch an attack in an attempt to destroy documents relating to the ongoing probe of the 2G spectrum case.\n\nIn 2015, a US Congressional report alleged that the D-Company was a \"5,000-member criminal syndicate operating mostly in Pakistan, India, and the United Arab Emirates,\" which has a \"strategic alliance\" with ISI and has \"forged relationships with Islamists, including Lashkar-e-Taiba and al-Qaida.\" However, the report had no political implications, and was mainly to brief lawmakers.\n\nIn 2018, Dr Louise Shelley, Professor at the George Mason University, stated that the D-Company was now mainly based in Pakistan and had diversified its assets like Mexican drug organisations». He was also wire-taped by Indian investigators who found out he had real estate assets in Dubai under someone else's name.\nAt times, Dawood Company has been linked to the Bollywood film industry, as well as real estate and betting businesses, from which it is said to derive considerable revenue. The 2002 film \"Company\" is based loosely on its activities, as well as its sequel (prequel to the storyline) \"D\" (2005), \"Shootout at Lokhandwala\" (2007), and \"Once Upon a Time in Mumbai\" (2010). The 2013 film \"Shootout at Wadala\" is based on the rise of the D-Company. It also features in Salman Rushdie's 2018 novel \"The Golden House\", where it is called Z-Company.\n\n\n"}

The kibbutz was named in honor of Léon Blum, the Jewish socialist former Prime Minister of France who was the focus of a widely publicized, and ultimately unsuccessful, show trial in 1942 mounted by the collaborationist Vichy regime.\n\nAgriculture (cotton, dairy, fruit) and light industry (metal working) have formed the primary economic basis for the kibbutz. In recent years this has been supplemented increasingly by tourism. Kfar Blum's location near the Jordan River at the foot of Mount Hermon has made it a center for outdoor recreational activities including walking, hiking, kayaking, rafting and bird watching.\n\nThe kibbutz has a regional school, a sports arena and a hotel. It was also home to Hapoel Galil Elyon, a top division basketball team, which in 1993 became the first club from outside Tel Aviv to win the championship.\n\nBetween 1969 and 1993, Kfar Blum was home to 24 years of the American Class, an academic-year-long program for an annual cohort of 15 to 30 U.S. and Canadian 10th-graders.

He played college football at Boston College.\n\nMamula played college football at Boston College. He redshirted in 1991 and then hurt a shoulder at the beginning of the 1992 season, although he played through it. In 1993, as a junior, Mamula had 84 tackles and 11 sacks as a rush-backer in a 3-4 defense for Boston College. Mamula added another sack in the Carquest Bowl, bringing his season total to twelve. In 1994, his senior year they switched to a 4-3 defense and Mamula was a right defensive end. From that position he had 73 tackles and 13 sacks and four more in the team's 12-7 Aloha Bowl win over Kansas State University, bringing his season total to 17 sacks. For his efforts, he was voted All-Big East.\n\nMamula was one of the first players to train specifically for the combine drills, performing each drill hundreds of times in the months leading up to the combine. Although that practice is prevalent today, in 1995 most players performed football drills and paid less attention to the specific drills measured at the combine. Mamula had 26 reps of 225 lb bench presses, which was more reps than the top tackle taken in the draft (Tony Boselli), and his 4.58 40-yard dash time was considered extremely fast for his position. He scored a 49 out of 50 in the Wonderlic Test, which is the second highest score ever recorded by an NFL player. In addition he also had a 38.5\" vertical jump, higher than cornerback Jimmy Hitchcock.\n\nMamula also performed the Four-Square run in 7.82#.

All picks involved in this trade were in the 1995 NFL Draft. The Eagles then selected Mamula, apparently hoping he would fill the void left by Reggie White two years earlier. The Buccaneers went on to draft Warren Sapp with the 12th pick, and traded the pair of second-round picks for the 28th overall pick in the same draft, which they used to get Derrick Brooks. \n\nDuring a 77 game career with the Eagles, Mamula had 209 total tackles and 31.5 sacks. His best seasons were 1996 and 1999. In 1996, he logged 8 sacks and in 1999 he had 8½, after recovering from missing the entire 1998 season. He also picked off a pass from Kurt Warner and returned it for a touchdown in the last game of the 1999 season. He was forced to retire after the 2000 season due to injuries. Mamula was inducted into Boston College's Sports Hall of Fame.\n\nBecause Mamula's subsequent NFL career did not track with projections extrapolated based upon his top combine showing, he is often pejoratively referred to as a \"Workout Warrior\" and his name is frequently invoked when players go into the combine as relative unknowns and come out as hot properties. Michael David Smith wrote an article for \"The New York Times\" in 2008 refuting these characterizations, noting that scouts were impressed with Mamula's play while he was at BC and arguing that Mamula had an underrated career.\n"}
{"id": "1897789", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1897789", "title": "Type 99 rifle", "text": "Type 99 rifle\n\nThe was a bolt-action rifle of the Arisaka design used by the Imperial Japanese Army during World War II.\n\nDuring the Second Sino-Japanese War in the 1930s, the Japanese soon found that the 7.7mm cartridge being fired by their Type 92 heavy machine gun in China was superior to the 6.5×50mm cartridge of the Type 38 rifle, necessitating the development of a new weapon to replace the outclassed Type 38. The Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) developed the Type 99 based on the Type 38 rifle but with a caliber of 7.7mm. The Type 99 was produced at nine different arsenals. Seven arsenals were located in Japan, with the other two located at Mukden in Manchukuo and Jinsen in Korea.\n\nThe IJA had intended to completely replace the Type 38 with the Type 99 by the end of the war. However, the outbreak of the Pacific war never allowed the army to completely replace the Type 38 and so the IJA used both rifles during the war. As the war progressed, more and more cost saving steps were introduced in order to speed up production. Late war rifles are often called \"Last Ditch\" or \"Substitute Standard\" due to their crudeness of finish. They are generally as crude as the 1945 dated Mauser K98k of Germany, or worse.\n\nThe Type 99 was produced in four versions, the regular issue Type 99 Short Rifle, the Type 99 Long Rifle (a limited production variant), the take-down Type 2 Paratroop Rifle, and the Type 99 Sniper Rifle. The standard rifle also came with a wire monopod and an anti-aircraft sighting device. The Type 99 was the first mass-produced infantry rifle to have a chrome lined bore to ease cleaning. All of these features were abandoned by mid-war.\n\nDuring the Korean War, approximately 126,500 short and 6,650 long Type 99 Rifles were re-chambered under American supervision at the Tokyo arsenal to fire the then-standard .30-06 Springfield cartridge. Apparently intended for the South Korean \"gendarmerie\", few rifles appear to have been issued at the end of the war in 1953. These rifles were fitted with a lengthened magazine well and had a small notch cut in the top of the receiver to accommodate the .30-06 round's 1/3 inch greater length. Accuracy suffered, due to the difference in cartridges, rifling rate and characteristics, but they were nonetheless functional. Conversions to both .30-06 and 7.62 NATO as well 7.62 Russian have also been performed by civilians, often along with sporterising modifications.\n\nAfter 1946, the Republic of China re-chambered large numbers of Type 99 rifles to fire the 8×57 IS cartridge. Indonesian forces used a large number of Type 99 rifles in the fighting against the Dutch during the Indonesian National Revolution (1945–1949), although late Japanese production was less reliable. Sniper rifles were also used. The Royal Thai Army received Japanese rifles of all types after 1945 and converted some short Type 99 rifles to fire the U.S. .30-06 cartridge during the early 1950s.\n\nIn the West, Japanese equipment is commonly referred to as \"Type XX\", rather than \"Model XX\". In the case of a firearm, \"Model\" is a more accurate interpretation of the SHIKI (式) character, but the word \"Type\" has become well-established by collectors for decades.\n\nTo gain the superior hitting power of the larger 7.7mm cartridge, several caliber 6.5mm Type 38 rifles were modified for the new round. Although the tests proved satisfactory, the army decided that the added recoil and larger chambering for the 7.7mm cartridge would require an entirely new rifle for the cartridge. It utilized a cock-on-closing action and an unusual safety mechanism, operated by pressing in the large knurled disk at the rear of the bolt with the palm of the hand and rotating it in a 1/8 clockwise turn, which is often misunderstood by Western shooters who are used to the Mauser's thumb lever safety. It featured a quick-release bolt and antiaircraft sights, as well as a sliding bolt cover and monopod. As a bolt-action rifle, the Type 99 was a very solid weapon, but as with all manually operated rifles used during World War II, they were in most close combat situations outclassed by semi-automatic rifles and submachine guns.\n\nThe Type 99 is one of the strongest military bolt action rifles ever made, but many late-war (\"last ditch\") rifles used lower quality parts, and a complete lack of finish, as well as shortcuts taken to ease production. The \"last ditch\" rifles are usually distinguished by their crudeness: poorly finished stock, wood buttplate, very obvious tooling marks in the metal, rudimentary sights and an unfinished bolt knob and handle. Unlike its predecessors, however, a disadvantage of the Type 99 was its increased recoil due to the lighter weight combined with a heavier cartridge.\n\nIn some cases, these rifles may actually be training rifles intended for firing cartridges with a wood projectile only. The training rifles were made of mild steel and were never intended for ball ammunition. It is possible that reports of Type 99 rifles blowing up were simply the results of soldiers testing captured weapons. Unaware that they were using drill rifles, they fired ball ammunition in them with poor results and possible injuries. It is possible that this may have unjustly led to the Arisaka having a reputation (at least for the last ditch rifles) for being of poor construction.\n\nThe Type 99 can be fitted with a Type 30 bayonet. The Type 30 bayonet had a very long, slender blade, and was grooved to reduce weight. The early models featured a hooked quillion. These bayonets attached to a lug under the barrel and were further stabilized by a loop that fit around the muzzle. Unmounted, it handled like a machete.\n\nType 99 long rifle\n\nThe initial production rifle of the Type 99. Made only by Nagoya Arsenal and Toyo Kogyo under Kokura Arsenal supervision. Only about 38,000 were produced, 8,000 at Nagoya and 30,000 at Toyo Kogyo between summer of 1940 and spring of 1941 when production was switched to the much more common new Type 99 short rifle of which millions were made. Like the early Type 99 short rifles, these rifles were made with a monopod, anti-aircraft lead arms on the rear sight and a dust cover.\n\nThough the Arisaka rifle has never been exported to the United States in great numbers, there are thousands available—most having been brought home by Marines and soldiers returning from the Pacific theater. In many cases, the imperial chrysanthemum atop the receiver has been defaced by the surrendering Japanese in order to preserve the Emperor's honor: the mark indicated that the rifle was the Emperor's personal property. Rifles with an intact chrysanthemum often bring a premium on the collector market, sometimes almost double the price for a like model defaced rifle. Many have been rechambered to more common calibers due to the relative scarcity of factory 7.7×58mm Arisaka; it is particularly suitable for this due to its robust action.\n\n"}
{"id": "1897797", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1897797", "title": "The Grange (Toronto)", "text": "The Grange (Toronto)\n\nThe Grange is a historic Georgian manor in downtown Toronto, Ontario. It was the first home of the Art Museum of Toronto. Today, it is part of the Art Gallery of Ontario. The structure was built in 1817, making it the 12th oldest surviving building in Toronto and the oldest remaining brick house. It was built for D'Arcy Boulton (1785–1846), one of the town's leading citizens and part of the powerful Boulton family that played an important role in the Family Compact. Originally, it was considerably west of the city, but over time, the city grew and Boulton sold his considerable land holdings surrounding the manor at great profit.\n\nThe house was inherited by D'Arcy's son and Toronto mayor, William Henry Boulton. When he died in 1874, the house passed to his widow, Hariette Boulton. She remarried the prominent scholar Goldwin Smith, and the couple lived in The Grange for the rest of their lives. Upon Goldwin's Smith's death in 1910, the couple bequeathed the building to the Art Museum of Toronto (now known as the Art Gallery of Ontario) and The Grange became the new home of the gallery. The building also served as the first home of the Ontario College of Art and Design, now OCAD University. Since the early 20th century, the Art Gallery of Ontario has been expanded a number of times and the original manor makes up only a small part of the structure.\n\nThe expanse of lawn to the south of the building, what is left of the grounds, is operated by the city as Grange Park. Also on the old grounds is St. George Church, which was founded by the Boultons and which burned down in 1956. Only the tower and original Sunday school building remain.\n\nIn 1970, The Grange was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in recognition of the house's significance to the history of Toronto.\n\nThe Grange was built in 1817 as the home of D'Arcy Boulton (1785–1846; son of G. D'Arcy Boulton), his wife, Sarah Anne, and their eight children. It was located on 100 acres (40 ha) of land that extended from Queen Street in the south to Bloor Street in the north and from Beverley Street east to McCaul Street. The north section of the property was sold to Bishop Strachan in 1828, to be used for the establishment of King’s College, an Anglican university. Property to the south was donated in the 1830s and 1840s for St. George the Martyr Church and St. Patrick's Market, both still in existence.\n\nSarah Anne Robinson was born in Lower Canada in 1789 to a loyalist family who had previously moved north from Virginia after the American Revolution. D’Arcy Boulton, in contrast, immigrated to Canada in 1797 when he was 12 years old. The two met through Sara Anne’s older brother Peter Robinson and settled at The Grange (so named for the Boulton family estate in Lincolnshire, England) in 1817.\n\nSarah Anne quickly established herself as a superior hostess and The Grange became a central site for the social and political happenings of early Toronto. Over the course of their lives, the Boultons had eight children. D’Arcy Boulton made his living running a dry good store and obtaining three governments posts. He died in 1846 after a rough decade of family deaths, a cholera epidemic and financial strain. When D’Arcy died, the house was left to Sarah Anne. She put the house and the land around it in trust for her daughter-in-law, Harriette, as a marriage settlement. Thus, the house was under Harriette’s control and it was Harriette who bequeathed the house to the Art Museum of Toronto. The head of the household was now his eldest son, William Henry Boulton.\n\nOver the course of his life William was mayor of Toronto three times in 1845, 1846, 1847 and was a member of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada. In 1846, William married Harriette Mann Dixon from Boston, yet the couple never had any children. William, however, was fond of gambling and Harriette and her mother-in-law, Sarah Anne, spent much time trying to keep The Grange in Boulton hands. William died in 1874, leaving Harriette as the sole owner of The Grange.\n\nIn 1875, Harriette married Goldwin Smith, British scholar and political writer. Goldwin Smith was once regius professor of history at Oxford University and personal tutor to the Prince of Wales. However, he decided to settle in Toronto in 1871. Smith was a proud supporter of the arts in Toronto and founded journals and encouraged young artists to paint Canadian subjects. The couple lived happily in The Grange until their deaths in 1909 (Harriette) and 1910 (Goldwin).\n\nBy the turn of the 20th century, it was decided that Toronto should have an art gallery, much like many other major cities at the time. By 1900, local artist George Reid was the president of the Ontario Society of Artists and was pushing for the creation of an art gallery. Between Reid and Edmund Walker (prominent banker and champion of the arts), a campaign was established to raise money for the gallery scheme. In 1902, the Smiths joined the cause and decided to bequeath The Grange as the first location of the Art Museum of Toronto. It wasn’t until 1913 that the museum held its first exhibition, composed of Smith’s own collection. By 1966, The Art Museum of Toronto was renamed the Art Gallery of Ontario (AGO) and The Grange now sits on the south side of the larger AGO building.\n\nFrom the early days of the Art Museum of Toronto until the restoration of the 1960s, The Grange underwent a variety of changes, including electrification and the inclusion of an apartment for a live-in caretaker. In 1918 and 1926 respectively, additional gallery wings were added to the AGO and several rooms in The Grange were used as staff offices. A tea room was also established in the drawing room and breakfast parlour.\n\nBy the 1960s, the AGO was once again expanding, therefore forging a new path for The Grange. This was a time in Ontario of increased interest in heritage preservation and so the Junior Women's Committee raised $650 000 for a restoration project. This money was used to restore The Grange to how it would have looked in 1835. In 1970, The Grange was named a National Historic Site of Canada. Designated by the City of Toronto under the \"Ontario Heritage Act\" by By-law 130-91\n\nToday, The Grange houses the Norma Ridley Members’ Lounge and exhibit spaces. While it is no longer furnished as a historic house depicting the 1830s, it retains its historic roots and architectural integrity. Visitors to the AGO are free to enjoy The Grange and explore the exhibits, take a tour, and speak to a volunteer about The Grange history.\n\nThe original house, designed by an unknown architect, was two storeys high, 60 by 40 feet (18 m × 12 m) in area, with a low hipped roof containing a circular window. It is likely that the bricks were made on the property from the heavily clayed soil. The windows are double-hung with brick lintels and louvered wooden shutters. They are 12-over-12 sash on the main floor and 8-over-8 sash on the second. The front door has a moulded reveal and a semi-circular fanlight, with separate sidelights. Originally, the gate of the building extended to Queen Street, however the gates have been crowded back to the head of John Street. As was the custom at the time, The Grange was built in the middle of a hundred-acre park lot. It received the name \"The Grange\" after a family estate in England.\n\nReflecting a sense of Georgian balance, the front door opened onto a central hall with the dining room on the left and the drawing room on the right. At the back of the house and on the second floor were bedrooms for the family. There were also four large rooms in the attic, probably for the servants. The kitchen, food storage areas and scullery were in the basement.\n\nThe property saw two major expansions, with the first series of expansions occurring in the 1840s. Several additions were made to the house, possibly because there had been a fire (this is difficult to confirm). These changes included the enlargement of the drawing room; the elimination of three bedrooms to create a large second-floor assembly room; and an addition on the west end to house an office. William Boulton, who was mayor of Toronto four times and a Member of Parliament, might have needed such a space. The front hall was also enlarged and a new central staircase installed. The painted glass window depicting the family crest was also added. This crest is a visual play on the name Boulton, as it shows a barrel pierced by an arrow, or \"bolt\", with a hogshead of wine or \"tun\". The family motto — \"\"Dux vitae ratio\"\" (\"The guide to life is reason\") — rests below the crest, always reminding the Boultons of their British ancestry. William, the secretary of the Turf Club, built St. Leger Race Course to the north.\n\nFollowing the marriage of Harriette Boulton to her second husband, Goldwin Smith, the property was expanded again in 1885. additions to the house were undertaken. Smith was a scholar and a large library was added to the west of the house. The Georgian-style staircase was replaced with an angular Victorian-style oak stair that skirted the painted window. The wooden front porch was replaced with a stone version.\n\nOriginally, there was a path running up to the front steps, with an oval drive around the front lawn. The house stood on raised ground with terraces, as it does today. Around it was a mix of open spaces, stands of trees and flower gardens. Behind the house were vegetable and fruit gardens and, farther north, an orchard. The front lawn of The Grange, now known as the Grange Park, was central to Grange activities. This was the site for many garden parties, church school picnics and even a royal visit.\n\nSeveral images of The Grange show a domed glass conservatory on the east side of the house, which would have been filled with plants readily available from catalogues. One 1827 catalogue advertised 79 varieties of apple among other fruit and ornamental trees, as well as a wide variety of shrubs, flowers and greenhouse plants. We know that there was an orchard house on the property growing peaches, nectarines and grapes. William Boulton won prizes at the 1844 Toronto Horticultural Society Show for geraniums, roses, greenhouse plants and pansies. The gardener, John Gray, named a geranium he developed \"Pelargonium boultonianum\" after the Boultons.\n\nWith the sale of the southern part of the property in the mid-19th century, a new entrance to The Grange was created, which included a lodge — home to William Chin, the butler, and his family. Other buildings included a stable, a root house, a tool house and a drive shed. Later in the century, cottages for married servants were also erected.\n\n"}
{"id": "1897800", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1897800", "title": "Type 11 light machine gun", "text": "Type 11 light machine gun\n\nThe was a light machine gun used by the Imperial Japanese Army in the interwar period and during World War II.\n\nCombat experience in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–1905 had convinced the Japanese of the utility of machine guns to provide covering fire for advancing infantry. This was reinforced by the first-hand observations of European combat tactics by Japanese military attachés during the First World War, and the Army Technical Bureau was tasked with the development of a lightweight machine gun, which could be easily transportable by an infantry squad. The resultant “Type 11 light machine gun” (named after the 11th year of the reign of Emperor Taishō, or 1922) was the first light machine gun to be mass-produced in Japan and the oldest Japanese light machine gun design to see service in the Pacific War. It was superseded by the Type 96 light machine gun in 1936.\n\nThe Type 11 light machine gun was a design by famed arms designer Kijirō Nambu, based on a modification of the French Hotchkiss M1909 Benét–Mercié machine gun. It was an air-cooled, gas-operated design, using the same 6.5×50mm Arisaka cartridges as the Type 38 infantry rifle.\n\nA feature of the Type 11 machine gun is its detachable hopper; it can be refilled while attached and does not require removal during operation. Instead of a belt or box magazine, the Type 11 was designed to hold up to six of the same cartridge clips used on the Type 38 rifle. The five-round clips were stacked lying flat above the receiver, secured by a spring arm, and the rounds were stripped from the lowest clip one at a time, with the empty clip thrown clear and the next clip automatically falling into place as the gun was fired. The system had the advantage that any squad member could supply ammunition and that the hopper could be replenished at any time. The relatively short barrel (17.5 inches) produced excessive flash with standard ammunition (initially intended for Type 38 rifles with barrel more than a foot longer). A new loading was introduced for this reason, which had a slightly lower muzzle velocity (under 100fps), but burned much more completely in the Type 11 short barrel and produced much less flash as a result. This new round was called the 6.5×50mm Arisaka genso round, the cartons identified by a circled \"G\".\n\nThe inherent disadvantage of the hopper was that the open feeder box allowed dust and grit to enter the gun, which was liable to jam in muddy or dirty conditions due to issues with poor dimensional tolerances, which gave the weapon a bad reputation with Japanese troops. Another issue was that the weight of the rifle cartridges in the side-mounted hopper unbalanced the weapon when fully loaded. To compensate, the buttstock was designed in a way that it bent to the right, leading to the Chinese nickname for the weapon \"bent buttstock\" (). Reloading the weapon during an assault charge proved impossible due to the clip feeding system.\n\nType 89 \"flexible\" – two Type 11 actions mounted on a flexible mounting for anti-aircraft use and as a rear-defense aerial gun. The machine gun was chambered for the 7.7x58mmSR Type 89 cartridge. It was equipped with a metallic Y-shaped stock and two spade grips, the barrels had no cooling fins. It was fed from two 45-round quadrant-shaped pan magazines (each magazine had a place for nine five-round stripper clips). The double-barrelled machine gun weighted about 28 kg and had a rate of fire of around 1,400 rpm.\n\nType 91 – was a modified Type 11 for use on tanks and armoured vehicles. The machine gun was equipped with an angled pistol grip, the stock and bipod were removed. Additionally, the machine gun was equipped with two brackets (on the right side) for mounting a 1.5x30 scope manufactured by Tomioka Kogaku.\n\nTe-4 – a modified Type 11 which was designed to replace the Type 89 \"flexible\" due to the excessive weight of the latter. It used a different flexible mounting, had a shorter wooden stock and a straight pistol grip with an enlarged trigger guard, the barrel had no cooling fins. It was chambered for the 7.7x58mmSR Type 89 cartridge and fed from 70-round pan magazine. It is uncertain whether the Te-4 was made by splitting the Type 89 \"flexible\" or was a direct derivative of Type 11.\n\nThe Type 11 came into active service in 1922, and some 29,000 were produced by the time production stopped in 1941. It was the primary Japanese light machine gun through the Manchurian Incident and in the early stages of the Second Sino-Japanese War. Although superseded by the Type 96 light machine gun in production in 1936, it remained in service with front-line combat through the end of World War II. Many were captured by the Chinese and were used against the Japanese. Manchukuo Imperial Army received replace its ex-Chinese ZB vz. 30s with Type 11s in 1936. Both sides also used Type 11 machine guns during the Chinese Civil War and North Korea used Type 11 and Type 91 during the Korean War. The Viet Minh also used the Type 11 during the First Indochina War, as did the Viet Cong during the Vietnam War.\n\n"}
{"id": "1897810", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1897810", "title": "Type 96 light machine gun", "text": "Type 96 light machine gun\n\nThe was a light machine gun used by the Imperial Japanese Army in the interwar period and in World War II.\n\nCombat experience in the Manchurian Incident of 1931 and subsequent actions in Manchuria and northern China reaffirmed the Japanese army of the utility of machine guns to provide covering fire for advancing infantry. The earlier Type 11 light machine gun was a lightweight machine gun, which could be easily transportable by an infantry squad into combat. However, the open hopper design of the Type 11 allowed dust and grit to enter into the gun, which was liable to jam in muddy or dirty conditions due to issues with poor dimensional tolerances.\n\nThis gave the weapon a bad reputation with Japanese troops, and led to calls for its redesign. The Army's Kokura Arsenal tested the Czech ZB vz. 26 machine gun, samples of which had been captured from the National Revolutionary Army of the Republic of China, and (after borrowing certain elements) issued a new design, designated the Type 96 light machine gun, in 1936. The gun was produced at Kokura, Nagoya Arsenal and Mukden between 1936 and 1943, with a total production run of about 41,000.\n\nWhile the Japanese design was completely different internally, it did resemble the ZB vz. 26 in its basic layout using the top feed magazine and a bipod mount. The similar looking Type 97 heavy tank machine gun however was a true license built copy of the ZB design firing the heavier 7.7x58mm Arisaka cartridge; it was mounted in the tanks of the Japanese Army.\n\nType 96 light machine gun was almost identical in construction to the Type 11 in that it was an air-cooled, gas-operated design based on the French Hotchkiss M1909 machine gun. As with the Type 11, it continued to use the same 6.5x50mm Arisaka cartridges as the Type 38 rifle infantry rifle, although the more powerful 7.7x58mm Arisaka round had already been adopted and was starting to enter into service with front line combat units. Due to its similarity with the Bren, they're mistaken as clones.\n\nThe major difference with the Type 11 was the top-mounted curved detachable box magazine holding 30 rounds, which somewhat increased reliability, and lessened the weight of the gun. The finned gun barrel could also be rapidly changed to avoid overheating. The Type 96 had a blade front sight and a leaf rear sight, with graduations from 200 to 1,500 meters, with windage adjustment. A 2.5X telescopic sight with a 10 degree field of view could be attached at the right side of the gun.\n\nThe Type 96 also had a folding bipod attached to the gas block, and could be fitted with the standard infantry bayonet, which could be attached to the gas block below the barrel. The gun was capable of automatic fire only, although it was possible to fire single shots by briefly pulling the trigger.\n\nHowever, arms designer Kijiro Nambu did nothing to address the dimensional tolerance issue between the bolt and gun barrel, which led to frequent failures when fired cases became stuck in the chamber. In order to ensure reliable feeding (theoretically), Nambu resorted to oiling the cartridges via an oil pump in the magazine loader. In practice, this tended to worsen the problem instead, as the oiled cartridges tended to become coated with dust and sand. This feature and its inherent faults were dropped with the introduction of the Type 99 light machine gun.\n\nThe Type 96 came into active service in 1936 and was intended to replace the older Type 11; however the Type 11 had already been produced in large quantities, and both weapons remained in service until the end of the war. The Type 96 was regarded as rugged and reliable, but its 6.5 mm bullets lacked penetration against cover, and the design was supplemented by the more powerful Type 99 light machine gun with the larger 7.7 mm bullet in 1937.\n\nAfter World War II, it was used by Indonesian forces during the Indonesian National Revolution against Dutch forces notably during the Attack on Jogjakarta 1949. It was used by the Viet Minh and the North Vietnamese forces during the First and Second Indochina Wars.\n\n\n\n\n"}

More broadly, they can also include musical ensembles of other federal and state uniformed services, including the Public Health Service and NOAA Corps, the state defense forces, and the senior military colleges.\n\nDuring the colonial period, most British army units posted in the area that would become the United States had bands attached. The first recorded instance of a local American military band was in 1653 in the New Hampshire militia. The oldest extant United States military band is the United States Marine Corps Band, formed in 1798 and known by the moniker \"The President's Own\". The U.S. armed forces field eleven ensembles and more than 100 smaller, active-duty and reserve bands.\n\nBands provide martial music during official events including state arrivals, military funerals, ship commissioning, and change of command and promotion ceremonies; they conduct public performances in support of military public relations and recruitment activities such as street parades and concerts; and they provide popular music groups to entertain deployed military personnel. Most bands of the U.S. armed forces reconfigure into combat units during wartime during which they have non-musical responsibilities, including guarding prisoners of war and defending command centers.\n\nUnlike Canada, the United Kingdom, and some other nations, the United States federal armed forces do not maintain any \"voluntary bands\", or bands composed of unpaid civilian musicians who dress in military uniforms. All U.S. military bands are composed of regularly enlisted or commissioned military personnel. One exception to this is the United States Coast Guard Pipe Band, which is drawn from the U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary.\n\nFor hundreds of years, military forces have used music to signal their troops.\n\nEvidence of the attachment of musicians to military units operating in what would become the United States dates to 1633, when colonial Virginia militia employed drummers to beat marching cadences during drills and maneuvers. According to research by the U.S. Armed Forces School of Music, the first complete military band in the American colonies was organized in New Hampshire in 1653 with an instrumentation of 15 oboes and two drums. The exposure of Americans to martial music increased with the growth of the number of British Army units being rotated through the colonies; most British infantry regiments had military musicians attached, consisting of both field music units that sounded signals during combat, as well as \"Bands of Musick\" that performed for special and ceremonial occasions.\n\nAt the outset of the American Revolution, United States military units primarily relied on fife and drum corps for musical support. Americans were first introduced to the bugle horn (forerunner to the modern bugle) during the Battle of Harlem Heights, when British infantry used the instrument, causing Joseph Reed to later recall, \"the enemy appeared in open view, and sounded their bugles in a most insulting manner, as is usual after a fox chase. I never felt such a sensation before—it seemed to crown our disgrace.\" Some American cavalry units adopted bugle horns during the war, however, a shortage of brass in the Thirteen Colonies largely limited use of the instrument to the opposing British and German forces, with American troops continuing to rely heavily on fifes, drums, and even – at the Battle of Saratoga – turkey calls. Among the most noted American military musicians during the revolutionary period was Barzillai Lew whose fifing during the bloody Battle of Bunker Hill has been credited with keeping troop morale high.\n\nThe end of the revolution came \"the end of everything military\" in the United States and it was not until 1798, with the establishment of the U.S. Marine Corps, that military music returned in an organized fashion. In the enabling legislation authorizing the creation of the Marines, Congress authorized the funding of a Drum-Major, Fife Major and 32 musicians. This band, the U.S. Marine Band, as of 2015 remains the oldest extant military music organization in the United States and, indeed, the oldest professional musical ensemble in that nation.\n\nThe establishment of regular U.S. armed forces brought with it a standardization of uniforms. Federal soldiers and Marines wore a variety of uniforms based around the basic color blue with the exception of bandsmen whose uniforms were patterned in red to allow them to be more easily identifiable to field commanders who would need them to signal his orders to troops. The use of red in musician's uniforms is maintained to varying degrees by U.S. military bands today, as seen in the uniforms of the U.S. Marine Corps Band, the U.S. Marine Drum and Bugle Corps, the Old Guard Fife and Drum Corps of the 3rd Infantry Regiment, and in the peaked hats of the U.S. Army Band which are colored red in contrast to the standard U.S. Army blue design.\n\nThe modern bugle was first introduced to American military units around the time of the War of 1812. During that conflict, only the Rifle Regiment was authorized to use the bugle. All other American forces were required to continue using the traditional American fife. Gradually, however, bugles became more widely adopted by the United States military.\n\nIn 1855 United States Marine Band director Francesco Scala adopted the bearskin helmet for that band's drum-major in emulation of European trends. This transition occurred as the band was reorganizing itself from a traditional American fife and drum corps into its modern incarnation and the style later became popular headgear used by many military band drum-majors in the United States. (A shortage of bearskins in the late 1880s caused the price of the hats to skyrocket, with the \"New York Times\" then reporting their use might be phased out entirely. \"It can readily be seen what a price has to be paid for keeping up a custom which is rather old, it is true, but is practically a useless one save for the purpose of military display,\" the newspaper opined.)\n\n \nAt the time of the American Civil War, U.S. Army bands had a normal strength of 24 musicians for infantry units, and 16 for cavalry. With the mobilization of the Union Army, transition to total war, and decreasing importance of bands in signaling troops, the United States Department of War in 1861 considered cutting military bands entirely, estimated a potential cost savings of $5 million. The proposal was shelved in the face of opposition from officers and soldiers, however, a trimming of bandsmen occurred by eliminating some regimental ensembles in favor of brigade-level bands. Nonetheless, a survey in October 1861 found that 75-percent of Union regiments had a band and, by December of that year, the Union Army had 28,000 musicians in 618 bands. Bandsmen were also, for the first time, tasked with performing combat duties in addition to musical performance, frequently as stretcher-bearers and field hospital orderlies.\n\nMusicians were often given special privileges. Union general Phillip Sheridan gave his cavalry bands the best horses and special uniforms, believing \"music has done its share, and more than its share, in winning this war\". In addition to ceremonial and maneuver music, bands during this period also began performing concerts for troops with the popular music of the day, many regimental bands having formerly been civilian bands that enlisted en masse at the outbreak of hostilities. John Partridge, a soldier in the 24th Massachusetts Volunteer Regiment, recorded in a letter home the value the men in his unit placed on the regimental band, formerly a civilian orchestra from Boston led by Patrick Gilmore:\n\nIn the post-war era, aided by the large body of work being created by prolific American composers such as John Philip Sousa, Henry Filmore and Edwin Eugene Bagley, American military and military-like bands became known for performing a unique style of quick-tempo marches with thundering brass and heavy percussion. One music critic, writing about the Boston Jubilee of 1872, contrasted the \"velvety smoothness\" of the invited Band of the Grenadier Guards to the follow-up performance orchestrated by U.S. Army bandmaster-general Patrick Gilmore which involved \"a heterogeneous choir of nearly twenty thousand, an orchestra of about a thousand instrumentalists of decidedly mixed abilities, an organ blown by steam power ... a drum of the most preposterous magnitude, and a few batteries of artillery.\"\n\nBeginning in the 1880s, the United States Army Corps of Engineers maintained a band at the U.S. Army Engineer School (then the Engineers School at Willets Point, New York). Then, it was led by Julius Hamper, a Swiss immigrant and conductor. It was dissolved in the early 1900s after over 20 years of servie in Washington D.C.\n\nBy the early 1900s military bands were being established in the far-flung reaches of the American colonial empire. Most notable among them was the Philippine Constabulary Band under the direction of Walter Loving. The group, described by \"Army and Navy Life\" as \"one of the finest of all military bands in the world,\" and credited with John Philip Sousa as being equal in quality to the U.S. Marine Band, led the 1909 U.S. presidential inauguration parade, the first time a band other than \"The President's Own\" had done so.\n\nDuring World War I, the U.S. armed forces experienced a great influx of professional civilian musicians resulting, in part, from the mobilization of 27 African-American regiments to augment the U.S. Army's existing four black regiments. The regimental bands of these newly formed units were frequently led by black blues and jazz musicians experienced performing in the clubs of New York and Chicago. Among them was James Reese Europe, whose 369th Regiment band (the \"Harlem Hellfighters Band\") is credited with introducing jazz to Europe. Regimental bands during this time varied greatly in size and quality and \"intensive recruiting by an ambitious colonel with a band fund and an able conductor might coax a significant number of voluntary enlistments and result in a flexible, professional-quality ensemble.\"\n\nDuring World War II, the Women's Army Corps (WAC) formed female military bands to perform for departing and arriving troops, on training bases in the U.S., and as part of war bond drives, including the 404th Armed Service Forces Band, the only all-black all-female band in U.S. military history.\n\nIn 1949 the U.S. Air Force established the USAF Drum and Bugle Corps and a USAF Pipe Band. The former group continued until it was eliminated in 1961 as a cost-cutting measure. The USAF Pipe Band was deactivated nine years later, in 1970.\n\nBy the 20th century military music had effectively ceased to be an integral part of combat operations with the existence of military bands becoming a function of public duties and troop morale and welfare. Occasional exceptions existed, however. One later example of the use of a band in combat occurred during the Vietnam War when U.S. Army Major-General John Hay ordered the 1st Infantry Division band to march down a road held by the North Vietnamese Army (NVA) while playing the \"Colonel Bogey March\". NVA forces were, reportedly, so confused by the impromptu parade that they withdrew from the area, allowing American infantry to seize the road without opposition.\n\nIn 1992 Senator Sam Nunn – fighting to stop closures of U.S. military bases in his home state as part of the peace dividend – instead suggested elimination of military bands that support the U.S. Military Academy, U.S. Naval Academy, and U.S. Air Force Academy. Nunn said that cadets and midshipmen should volunteer to form their own bands instead, which would save the U.S. up to $10 million. Representatives of service academies responded by explaining that, due to the unique nature of cadet life relative to student life at civilian universities, it would not be practical for volunteer ensembles to replace the academy bands. The proposal ultimately became stalled in a larger debate about trimming $1 billion from the Strategic Defense Initiative and did not move forward.\n\nIn 2011 Rep. Betty McCollum, responding to a proposal she opposed that would curb funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, called for 40-percent of military band budgets to be slashed. McCollum's suggestion was decried by the Fleet Reserve Association and described by the National Association for Music Education as \"potentially devastating.\" The McCollum bill was initially defeated, but reintroduced by the congresswoman a second time, when it narrowly passed with bipartisan support. It was ultimately dropped by the U.S. Senate. In 2012, McCollum again attempted to defund military music programs by reintroducing her amendment. In an effort to preempt further action by McCollum, the U.S. Air Force proactively disbanded the Band of the Air Force Reserve, the Band of the Pacific-Alaska, and the Band of Liberty. At the time of its deactivation, the Band of the Air Force Reserve was the Air Force's oldest musical ensemble, founded in 1941 as the First Air Force Band of the U.S. Army Air Corps. In addition to the three active-duty bands, six of what were then eleven Air National Guard bands were also deactivated.\n\nIn 2016, U.S. Representative Martha McSally, a Republican from Arizona, introduced an amendment to the defense spending bill to remove $430 million in funding for military bands to eliminate their performing at concerts, parades, dinners and other public events. The amendment passed the House of Representatives on a voice vote and now goes to the Senate. McSally said military bands would still be allowed to play at military funerals and certain ceremonies.\n\nDuring the American Revolution, some military units, lacking heraldic insignia, painted eagles on the facing of their drums (in the British custom a regiment's armorial achievement would be used to decorate drums). This tradition continued after the war, and the decoration of drums with eagles in various poses, often dictated by the tastes of the individual band, continued. By the War of 1812, eagles were required to be painted on a blue ground for infantry units and red for artillery, though the design of eagles remained a largely individual art. Beginning in the 1840s, the U.S. Army attempted to standardize the eagles used on drums and, by the Civil War, stencils were issued to bands to apply the authorized designs, though some flair continued in the finishing and painting of the final product. With the later establishment of the Army Institute of Heraldry, eagle drums were phased out in favor of drum designs emblazoned with distinctive unit insignia, a return to the British tradition. Today, The U.S. Army Field Band and the U.S. Army Band \"Pershing's Own\" use \"eagle drums\". Those drums feature a eagle designs created by Gus Moeller known as \"the Grand Republic\".\n\nMost U.S. military bands are issued a set of regalia, which typically include a baldric worn by the Drum-Major charged with the distinctive unit insignia of the unit to which the band is assigned and, frequently, other symbols as well such as miniature campaign streamers; a chrome mace carried by the Drum-Major and engraved with the unit's name; and a special mural unique to the unit used to wrap the band's drums.\n\nDrum-majors often augment their uniforms with bearskin helmets and white leather gauntlets.\n\nSome U.S. Army units have officially recognized unit marches. Army units with attached bands can adopt a unit march or song at the request of the commanding officer and approval of the United States Army Center of Military History. Units with official marches and songs include the 1st Infantry Division (\"Big Red One Song\"), the 3rd Armored Division (\"Spearhead Song\"), the 7th Infantry Division (\"New Arirang March\"), and the 3rd Infantry Division ( \"Dogface Soldier\") among others.\n\nA U.S. military premier ensemble is a military band given special status within the U.S. armed forces. Such groups are configured and commanded in a way intended to attract the highest-quality musicians available and competition for enlistment is typically fierce. Unlike non-premier ensembles, which provide musical support to specific military units or commands, premier ensembles exist to promote the U.S. military to the public at-large and to preserve the heritage of American martial music. There are currently eleven such groups.\n\nIn addition to its two premier ensembles, the United States Air Force has ten additional active-duty bands: the Air Force Band of the West (at Lackland Air Force Base), the Air Force Heritage of America Band (at Joint Base Langley-Eustis), the Air Force Heartland of America Band (at Offutt Air Force Base), the Air Force Band of Mid-America (at Scott Air Force Base), the Air Force Band of the Golden West (at Travis Air Force Base), the Air Force Band of Flight (at Wright Patterson Air Force Base), the Air Force in Europe Band, the Air Force Band of the Pacific – Asia, and the Air Force Band of the Pacific – Hawaii (at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam). There are also five Air National Guard bands.\nIn addition to its four premier ensembles, the U.S. Army fields 25 active-duty bands assigned as unit ensembles to support divisions, corps, and armies. A further 17 part-time U.S. Army Reserve and 44 part-time National Guard bands are also maintained. \n\nDuring combat operations, Army bands reconfigure as light infantry units responsible for reinforcing military police \"by performing command post security, all-source production section security, and perimeter security for the division EPW central collecting point and EPW holding area.\"\n\nThough the Coast Guard does not have additional ensembles other than the U.S. Coast Guard Band, a mixed civilian/military volunteer unit provides regional musical support to Coast Guard bases. The United States Coast Guard Pipe Band is a 70-member pipe and drums band, organized into nine detachments which provide bagpipers and drummers for Coast Guard ship commissioning, change-of-command ceremonies, and funerals. Though a privately maintained and funded organization, it operates with special permission from the U.S. Coast Guard that allows it to use the name \"Coast Guard.\" All of its members are, additionally, personnel of the U.S. Coast Guard Reserve and U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary. The band wears uniforms of modified highland dress with kilts in the Coast Guard tartan. The Arizona Band Flotilla of USCG Auxiliary and Coast Guard Academy \"Windjammers\" Drum and Bugle Corps are also maintained through private funds.\n\nIn addition to its two premier ensembles, the U.S. Marine Corps also maintains ten, 50-person field bands assigned to the active-duty divisions and air wings. Marine Corps field bands, unlike the United States Marine Band \"The President's Own\" and the U.S. Marine Drum and Bugle Corps \"The Commandant's Own\", are not mission-exclusive to music. During combat operations, bands are responsible for rear-area defense, reorganizing as the security platoon for the divisional or wing command center.\n\nThe 10 USMC field bands and \"The Commandant's Own\" are options for the Marine Corps Musician Enlistment Option Program (MEOP).\n\nThe Navy has nine \"fleet bands\" in addition to its two premier ensembles, six of which are located in the Continental United States, the remaining three based in Hawaii, Italy, and Japan. The Navy School of Music at Joint Expeditionary Base Little Creek–Fort Story is responsible for training Navy and Marine Corps musicians.\n\nThe NOAA Corps, with less than 400 personnel, is one of two United States uniformed services, the other being the United States Space Force, without active-duty or reserve musicians. In the past, U.S. Navy bands have provided music for the commissioning of NOAA ships and the graduation of NOAA officer classes.\n\nThe United States Public Health Service has ceremonial bands in Washington, DC and Atlanta, Georgia. Each band is funded from private sources and staffed by part-time volunteers from the Public Health Service officer corps. The combined bands, as well as accompanying choirs, are officially known as the Public Health Service Commissioned Corps Musical Ensemble or \"The Surgeon General's Own\".\n\nThe United States Space Force, established on December 20, 2019, is one of two United States uniformed services, the other being the NOAA Corps, without any active-duty or reserve musicians, and the only armed service without active-duty or reserve musicians. As of December 2019, no plans are currently known if the USSF will establish a bands program or not.\nEach of the six senior military colleges, as well as the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy, maintain a cadet-staffed band for ceremonial support and performance at athletic events. The band of Norwich University, founded in 1819, is the oldest such group. The Texas A&M University Fightin' Texas Aggie Band is the largest military band in the United States with more than 400 members. The U.S. Merchant Marine Academy is the only federal service academy not to have a co-located full-time ensemble. The student band, known as \"George M. Cohen's Own,\" is the successor to a full-time band that was established at the school during World War II, but later deactivated.\n\nSeveral academies maintain bagpipe bands. The West Point Pipes and Drums, the pipe band of the U.S. Military Academy's Corps of Cadets, was established in 1973, while the U.S. Naval Academy Pipes and Drums was established in 1996 with an endowment from the academy's class of 1961. Both ensembles wear highland dress patterned in their respective service tartans.\n\nThe VMI Pipe Band, established in 1997 at the Virginia Military Institute, wears modified highland dress consisting of standard VMI cadet uniforms with kilts patterned in the VMI tartan in lieu of trousers. The Citadels Regimental Pipe Band is composed of between 35 and 40 pipers and drummers. In 1991 it, along with the Citadel's Regimental Band, became the first university military band from the United States to participate in the Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo.\n\nThis is also the case in only three out of the currently four US Military Junior Colleges, all of them sporting military band traditions of their own.\n\nSome state defense forces maintain military bands to provide ceremonial support to their state governments. Examples include the Maryland, California, Connecticut's First and Second Companies of the Governor's Foot Guard, Georgia State Defense Force Bands, the 2nd Company Governor's Horse Guards, a mounted band of the New Hampshire Defense Force.\n\n\n"}

The Type 96 had been introduced into combat service in 1936, and quickly proved to be a versatile weapon to provide covering fire for advancing infantry. Both the earlier Type 11 and current Type 96 light machine guns used the same 6.5x50mmSR Arisaka cartridges as the Type 38 infantry rifle. Using similar ammunition in both guns simplified supply and had the added advantage that any squad member could supply ammunition for the light machine gun, or \"vice versa\".\n\nHowever, in 1939 the Japanese army was in the process of switching to a larger and more powerful 7.7 mm cartridge which also had no rim, which improved cartridge handling. This more powerful cartridge: 3,136 J energy, compared to the earlier 6.5x50mmSR Arisaka cartridge: 1,966 J energy, required a firearm that had more steel, bigger springs and a heavier bolt to handle the extra forces involved. This required a switch from the Type 38 rifle to the Type 99 Rifle which could handle the more powerful round. Similarly, it was necessary to develop a new version of the reliable Type 96 light machine gun that would also be able to use this new larger caliber; thus the advantages of common ammunition between riflemen and machine gunners could continue. The Type 99 light machine gun was produced at Kokura, Nagoya Arsenal and Mukden with a total production of about 53,000 weapons.\n\nThe Type 99 was basically the same design as the Type 96 light machine gun, and had a number of parts in common. However, it dispensed with the oiler and had better primary extraction, increasing reliability over its predecessors. Early models had a mono-pod at the stock and a flash suppressor on the muzzle, which was screwed onto a threaded portion of the gun barrel. A top-mounted curved detachable box magazine held 30 rounds, and the finned gun barrel could be rapidly changed to avoid overheating.\n\nThe Type 99 had a blade front sight and a leaf rear sight, with graduations from 200 to 1,500 meters, with a wind adjustment. A 2.5X telescopic sight with a 10 degree field of view could be attached at the right side of the gun. These were often issued to the best marksmen of the unit and occasionally employed like a sniper rifle. A standard infantry bayonet could be attached to the gas block below the barrel, but on the battlefield this feature proved inconsequential due to the weight of the gun and the fact that the blade was largely obstructed by the flash hider when it was fixed on the muzzle.\n\nThe Type 99 came into active service in 1939, and was used side-by-side with the older Type 11 and Type 96, as these models had been produced in large quantities and many front line troops continued to use the Type 38 rifles with their 6.5 mm ammunition. All three weapons remained in service until the end of the war. The Type 99 was used by Communist forces (Chinese and North Korean armies) during the Korean War. It was used by the Viet Minh and the North Vietnamese forces during the First and Second Indochina Wars.\n\nA limited production version of the Type 99 was produced for paratroopers. It had a detachable stock and a forward-folding pistol grip. For deployment, the barrel and butt were detached from the gun, the pistol grip and bipod folded, and the entire set packed into a carrying bag.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1897833", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1897833", "title": "Government of Pakistan", "text": "Government of Pakistan\n\nThe Government of Pakistan () abbreviated as GoP, is a federal government established by the Constitution of Pakistan as a constituted governing authority of the four provinces two autonomous territories and one federal territory of a parliamentary democratic republic, constitutionally called the Islamic Republic of Pakistan.\n\nEffecting the Westminster system for governing the state, the government is mainly composed of the executive, legislative, and judicial branches, in which all powers are vested by the Constitution in the Parliament, the Prime Minister and the Supreme Court. The powers and duties of these branches are further defined by acts and amendments of the Parliament, including the creation of executive institutions, departments and courts inferior to the Supreme Court. By constitutional powers, the President promulgates ordinances and passes bills.\n\nThe President acts as the ceremonial figurehead while the people-elected Prime Minister acts as the chief executive (of the executive branch) and is responsible for running the federal government. There is a bicameral Parliament with the National Assembly as a lower house and the Senate as an upper house. The most influential officials in the Government of Pakistan are considered to be the federal secretaries, who are the highest ranking bureaucrats in the country and run cabinet-level ministries and divisions. The judicial branch systematically contains an apex Supreme Court, Federal Shariat Court, high courts of five provinces, district, anti-terrorism, and the green courts; all inferior to the Supreme Court.\n\nThe full name of the country is the \"Islamic Republic of Pakistan\". No other name appears in the Constitution, and this is the name that appears on money, in treaties, and in legal cases. The \"Pakistan Government\" or \"Government of Pakistan\" are often used in official documents representing the federal government collectively. Also, the terms \"Federal\" and \"National\" in government institutions or program names generally indicate affiliation with the federal government. As the seat of government is in Islamabad, \"Islamabad\" is commonly used as a metonym for the federal government.\n\nThe Constitution of Pakistan established and constituted the federal government of four provinces of federation of nation-state, known as State of Pakistan. The Constitution reads as:\n\nThe basic civil and criminal laws governing the citizens of Pakistan are set down in major parliamentary legislation (a term inherited from the United Kingdom), such as the Exit Control List, the Pakistan Penal Code, and the Frontier Crimes Regulations. By the Article 246th and Article 247th to the constitution, the Islamic \"Jirga\" (or \"Panchayat\") system has become an institution for local governance. The 1950s reforms in the government administration, the constitutional law and jurisprudence in Pakistan have been greatly influenced by the United States Of America ' legal system. Since the 1970s, the traditional jirga-based law has also influenced the country's judicial development.\n\nThe legislative branch is known as the parliament, a term for legislature inherited from the United Kingdom. The parliament has two houses;\n\n\nThe Parliament enjoys parliamentary supremacy. All the Cabinet ministers as well as the Prime Minister must be members of Parliament (MPs), according to the constitution. The Prime Minister and the Cabinet Ministers are jointly accountable to the Parliament. If there is a policy failure or lapse on the part of the government, all the members of the cabinet are jointly responsible. If a vote of no confidence is passed against the government, then the government collapses and a new one must be formed.\n\nBy general definition, the executive branch of government is the one that has sole authority and responsibility for the daily administration of the state bureaucracy. The division of power into separate branches of government is central to the republican idea of the separation of powers. The separation of powers system is designed to distribute authority away from the executive branch – an attempt to preserve individual liberty in response to tyrannical leadership throughout history.\n\nThe Prime Minister of Pakistan (Urdu: وزيراعظم; lit: 'Wazir-e- Azam\"), is the executive head of government of Pakistan, constitutionally designated as the Chief Executive (CE). Popularly elected by direct elections in the parliament, the Prime minister is responsible for appointing a cabinet as well as running the government operations.\n\nThe Prime Minister makes key appointments on various important positions, including;\n\nThe Cabinet can have a maximum of 11 percent (50 members including the Prime Minister) of the total strength of the Parliament.\nEach Cabinet member must be a member of Parliament (MP). The Cabinet Ministers chair the Cabinet and are further assisted by the Cabinet Secretary of Pakistan, whose appointment comes from the Civil Services of Pakistan. Other Ministers are Ministers of State, junior members who report directly to one of the Cabinet Ministers, often overseeing a specific aspect of government.\n\nOnce appointed by the Prime Minister, all Cabinet Ministers are officially confirmed to their appointment offices by the President in a special oath of ceremony.\n\nThe President of Pakistan is a ceremonial figurehead, a ceremonial head of state representing the unity of the country.\n\nElected for a five-year term by an indirect election, the electoral college consisting of members of the Senate, National Assembly and the four provincial assemblies, the president is now not eligible for reelection (18th amendment). However no individual may hold the office for more than two consecutive terms. The president may resign or be impeached and removed from office for incapacity or gross misconduct by a two-thirds vote of the members of the parliament.\n\nThe President enjoys all constitutional powers and exercises them directly or through officers subordinate to him as per the aforesaid Article 41-Article 47.\n\nThe President is responsible for making a wide variety of appointments.\n\nThese include:\n\n\nThe President, as Head of State also receives the credentials of Ambassadors from other countries, whilst the Prime Minister, as Head of Government, receives credentials of High Commissioners from other members of the Commonwealth, in line with historical tradition.\n\nThe President is the civilian Commander in Chief of the Pakistan Armed Forces.\n\nThe President of Pakistan can grant a pardon to or reduce the sentence, reprieve and respite, and remit, suspend or commute any sentence passed by any court, tribunal or other authority, particularly in cases involving a death sentence. The decisions involving pardoning and other rights by the President are independent of the opinion of the Prime Minister or the Parliamentary majority. In most other cases, however, the President exercises his or her executive powers on the advice of the Prime Minister.\n\nPakistan's independent judicial system began under the British Raj, and its concepts and procedures resemble those of Anglo-Saxon countries. Institutional and judicial procedures were later changed, in 1950s, under the influence of American legal system to remove the fundamental rights problems. The judiciary consists of the Supreme Court of Pakistan, Provincial High Courts, District Courts, Anti-terrorism courts, \"Sharia\" courts, and Environmental courts all over the country; Supreme Court being the superior court. The Supreme Court of Pakistan consists of a Chief Justice, and Senior Justices appointed by the President after consultation with the Chief Justice of Pakistan. The Constitution does not fix the number of justices of the Supreme Court, though it can be fixed by Parliament through an act signed by the President.\n\nThe Constitution grants powers to the Supreme Court to make judicature transfers. Although the proceedings in the Supreme Court arise out of the judgement or orders made by the subordinate courts, the Supreme Court reserves the right to transfer any case, appeal or proceedings pending before any High Court to any other High Court.\n\nMisconduct of judges is highly intolerable as is mentioned in the constitution. Under the mainframe of the Supreme Judicial Council Article 209 an inquiry into the capacity or conduct of a Judge, who is a member of the Council, may be conducted.\n\nThe civil service of Pakistan is the permanent bureaucracy of the Government of Pakistan. The civil servants are the permanent officials of the government, occupying a respected image in the civil society. Civil servants come from different cadres (e.g. Pakistan Administrative Service, Police Service of Pakistan etc.) after passing the CSS examinations. Not all the employees of the Government of Pakistan are civil servants; other employees of the Government of Pakistan come from the scientific institutions, state-owned corporations and commissioned military science circles.\n\nIn the parliamentary democracy, the ultimate responsibility for running the administration rests with the elected representatives of the people which are the ministers. These ministers are accountable to the legislatures which are also elected by the people on the basis of universal adult suffrage. The cabinet and its ministers are expected to lay down the policy guidelines, and the civil servants are responsible for implementing and enforcing it.\n\nThe federal secretaries are the most senior, experienced, and capable officials in the country. Each ministry/division has its Secretary to oversee and enforce the public policy matters.\n\nThe secretaries, who are basic pay scale (BPS)-22 grade officers, are largely considered to be the most powerful officials in the country. Due to the importance of their respective assignments, there are twelve specific federal secretaries which are considered to be the most vital in the Government of Pakistan. These include the Secretary Establishment (responsible for civil service matters), Secretary Commerce (responsible for trade), Secretary Cabinet (responsible for Cabinet Division), Secretary to the Prime Minister (responsible for Prime Minister's Office), Secretary Interior (responsible for law and order), Secretary Finance (responsible for the country's treasury), Secretary Foreign Affairs (responsible for foreign relations), Secretary Maritime Affairs (responsible for ports and shipping), Secretary Power (responsible for the electricity and power sector), Secretary Planning and Development (responsible for development projects), Secretary Petroleum (responsible for the petroleum sector) and Secretary Industries (responsible for industrial development).\n\nManagement of major crisis situations in the country and coordination of activities of the various Ministries in such situations are the functions of the Cabinet Division. Appointment for the chairman of the FPSC, the prestigious body responsible for the recruitment of elite bureaucrats, is made by the President after consulting the Prime Minister, according to Article 242 of the Constitution.\n\nSince 1947, Pakistan has an asymmetric federal government, with elected officials at the national (federal), provincial, tribal, and local levels. Constitution has set the limit of government for five years, but if a Vote of no confidence movements takes place in the parliament (and prelude of movements are proved at the Judicial branch), the government falls and immediately replaced with caretaker government initiated by the president (consultation of Prime Minister also required to make such move), in regards to Article 58 of the constitution.\n\nThere has been four times that the martial law has been in effect, and controversially approved by the supreme court. Through a general election where the leader of the majority winning party is selected to be the Prime Minister. All members of the federal legislature, the Parliament, are directly elected. Elections in Pakistan take place every five years by universal adult suffrage.\n\nThere are four provincial governments that rule the four provinces of the state; the Chief Minister heads the state government. All provincial assemblies are unicameral, elected for five years. The Governors appointed by President after consulting the Prime minister, act only as representatives of federal government in the province and do not have any part in running the government.\n\nThe provincial governments tend to have the greatest influence over most Pakistanis' daily lives. The tribal and Local government functions at the basic level. It is the third level of government, consisting \"Jirga\" in rural tribal areas.\n\nPakistan has a complex taxation system of more than 70 unique taxes administered by at least 37 tax collection institutions of the Government of Pakistan. Taxation is a debated and controversial issue in public and political science circle of the country, and according to the International Development Committee, Pakistan had a lower-than-average tax take. Only 0.57% of Pakistanis, or 768,000 people out of a population of 190 million pay income tax.\n\nThe Finance Minister of Pakistan presents the annual federal budget in the Parliament in the midst of the year, and it has to be passed by the both houses of the Parliament. The budget is preceded by an economic survey which outlines the broad direction of the budget and the economic performance of the country for the outgoing financial fiscal year.\n\nConstituted under the Article 160 of the Constitution of Pakistan by the Constitution, the National Finance Commission Award (NFC) program is a series of planned economic programs to take control of financial imbalances and equally manage the financial resources for the four provinces to meet their expenditure liabilities while alleviating the horizontal fiscal imbalances.\n\nAccording to stipulations and directions of the Constitution, the provisional governments and Federal government compete to get higher share of the program's revenues in order to stabilize their own financial status.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1897836", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1897836", "title": "Ossolineum", "text": "Ossolineum\n\nThe Ossolineum or the National Ossoliński Institute (, ZNiO) is a historic cultural foundation and publishing house located in Wrocław, Poland since 1947, second only in size to the ancient Jagiellonian Library in Kraków. It is an archival institute and research centre of national and international significance. Its publishing arm is the oldest continuous imprint in Polish since the early 19th century. Both institutions bear the name of their founder, Polish magnate, Count Jozef Ossoliński (1748-1826). Although their origin may be traced to the foreign imposed partitions of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in the 18th century, the institute's actual history dates from 1817 in the former Polish city of Lwów, then known as Lemberg, capital of Galicia, a province of the Austro-hungarian empire, (now \"Lviv\", Ukraine). The institute first opened its doors to the public in 1827. Ossoliński's purpose was not only to establish a library with archival and other historical materials and a printing works as a basis for the most important Polish national cultural institution at a time when sovereign Poland did not exist, but also to disseminate information to the Polish population through publishing as a means of maintaining cultural ties.\n\nDue to continued existential ordeals provoked by two world wars and other military and political conflicts, such as the ethnic cleansing of the Polish population of the Kresy borderlands after the annexation of one third of Poland's landmass in 1939, much of the library and other collections were plundered, scattered or deliberately destroyed. Barely one third of the artefacts and printed items from the Ossolineum made it to Wrocław after World War II. However those items which survived, did so thanks to the heroic dedication of staff, not least, Mieczysław Gębarowicz. \n\nSince its westerly relocation in 1947 the Ossolineum's Polish department has become the most extensive in the country as it strives to complete a record of the whole Polish scientific and literary oeuvre. It is the repository of manuscripts of some of the foremost Polish scientists, writers and poets, including: Nicolaus Copernicus' \"De revolutionibus orbium coelestium\", Jan Kochanowski, Adam Mickiewicz, Adam Asnyk, Jan Kasprowicz, Władysław Reymont, Stefan Żeromski, Juliusz Słowacki and in particular, Henryk Sienkiewicz whose chief publisher it has been.\n\nThe ZNiO departments are: the Ossolineum Library (1816), the Lubomirski Museum (1823), Ossolineum Publishers (1827), the Pan Tadeusz Museum.\n\nOssoliński who was a politician, writer and researcher had already devoted his long life to building and cataloguing an extremely rich library collection, consisting of books, manuscripts, prints and coins. It was only upon mature consideration and after observing developments since the Congress of Vienna that he opted for Lwów, as the most suitable place in which to house his 52 crates of materials having obtained prior approval of the Austrian emperor, Francis I. Thus began his Institute in Lwów (\"Institut in Lemberg\" in German). The income from Ossoliński's landed properties served for over three decades to finance his acquisitions and collection. The Ossolineum quickly became a celebrated centre for Polish science and culture which not only survived under foreign rule, but throughout the Second Polish Republic in the Interwar period. \n\nUntil the 1939 invasion of Poland it had combined a library, publishing house, and the Lubomirski Museum.\nThe National Ossoliński Institute had been located from its foundation until 1945 in the former convent and church buildings of the Carmelite Order of nuns in Lwów at 2, Ossolińscy street, (since renamed vulytsia Stefanyka). After the first partition of Poland and the dissolution of many convents by the Austrian emperor Joseph II, the convent buildings had become a ruin. Their restoration became a project for General Józef Bem who in 1823 merged the Lubomirski Museum (originally founded by Prince Henryk Lubomirski) with the Ossoliński Institute.\n\nUnder Austrian rule the Ossolineum became a beacon for the Polish independence movement and was one of the most important centres of Polish culture despite foreign rule and the Germanization of its structures. During that time there were many persecutions such as police searches and arrests of employees of the Institute. It housed a clandestine Polish printing works in the early 1840s, and had exclusive rights for publishing textbooks under the relative Galician autonomy. During the revolutionary upheaval in 1848, the Ossolineum became a Polish landmark in an otherwise highly ethnically diverse city.\n\nIn accordance with the intentions of its founder the Ossolineum became one of the most important research centres for history and Polish literature, with one of the largest book collections in Poland as well as a large collection of manuscripts and autographs, including medieval manuscripts and some of the rarest incunabula. There were also individual smaller archives and book collections deposited at the Ossolineum by grand families such as the: Jabłonowski, Piniński, Pawlikowski, Skarbek, Balzer, Sapieha, Lubomirski and Mniszech.\n\nAfter the Russian Revolution and the collapse of Austria-Hungary, before World War I had even ended, Galicia was the scene of further major more localised armed conflict. The Ossolineum was attacked by Ukrainian soldiers during the fighting over the city in 1918.\n\nBefore the Second World War, the Ossolineum library consisted of 220,000 works, over 6,000 manuscripts, over 9,000 autographs, over 2,000 diplomas and over 3,000 maps (the collection of J.M. Ossoliński from the year 1827 included 10,121 works, 19,055 volumes, duplicates, 567 manuscripts in 715 volumes, 133 maps, 1,445 figures). The Ossolineum also kept a complete collection of the published Polish press from 19th and 20th centuries, the largest in Poland.\n\nIn his last will, Józef Ossoliński had named members of his family as curators and directors to ensure the continuity of the institute and nominated 28 notable Polish families from among whom successors could be chosen in the event his own family died out.\n\nAfter the takeover of Lwów by the Soviet Union in the September 1939 attack on Poland, the Communist Party nationalized and redistributed all private property. The Ossolineum was closed and its library holdings were absorbed in the newly created \"Lviv Branch of the Academy of Sciences of the Ukrainian SSR\". The \"Lubomirski Museum collection\" was distributed among various Lwów museums managed by the Ukrainians for the next two years. During the subsequent German occupation of Lwów, from 29 June 1941 to 27 July 1944, the Ossolineum library was incorporated into the structure of the new German \"Staatsbibilothek Lemberg\". At the beginning of 1944, the German government decided to move not only the collection of Staatsbibilothek Lemberg (Lwów’s library), but also the university and polytechnic libraries and the Shevchenko Scientific Society collection.\nFollowing German orders, two archival consignments were prepared by professor Mieczysław Gębarowicz, the Ossolineum's manager during part of the war, and were supposed to include only specifically German literature and a reference book collection from the main reading room. However, in the event it also contained the most valuable and carefully selected special collections of the Ossolineum’s cimelia. Gębarowicz sent instructions by covert letters to his colleagues in Kraków. Altogether there were 2,300 manuscripts, ca. 2,200 documents, ca. 1,700 old prints, ca. 2,400 figures and drawings from an old collection in the Lubomirski Museum, the Pawlikowski collection and hundreds of old coins. Moreover, it also included c. 170 of the most valuable manuscripts of another Polish foundation library the Baworowscy Library, and the most valuable manuscripts and incunabula of the University Library in Lwów. Among the evacuated literature of the 19th and 20th centuries there were the autographs of \"Pan Tadeusz\" by Adam Mickiewicz, the entire literary legacy of Juliusz Słowacki: his manuscripts with autographs of \"Mazepa, Lilla Weneda, Król-Duch\", and Aleksander Fredro, with autographs of \"Pan Jowialski, Śluby panieńskie\", \"Zemsta\" and \"Dożywocie\", and the autographs of works by Seweryn Goszczyński, Teofil Lenartowicz, Józef Conrad, Henryk Sienkiewicz, including autographs of \"The Deluge\", Józef Ignacy Kraszewski, Jan Kasprowicz, Władysław Reymont, including the autograph of \"Chłopi\", and the papers of Stefan Żeromski.\nThe manuscript collection of Lwów’s own scholars was included in the move: Wojciech Kętrzyński, Ludwik Bernacki, Oswald Balzer, Karol Szajnocha along with the archive of the Galician activist peasant movement of Bolesław and Maria Wysłouch. In terms of documents, the oldest and most valuable items were selected, including the documents of Pope Gregory IX from 1227 and the Silesian prince, Henry I the Bearded from 1229.\n\nThe Ossolineum cargo reached German occupied Kraków during March and April 1944, with the intention of safe storage in a cellar of the Jagiellonian Library during the expected military actions. However in the summer of 1944, the consignment was transferred by the Germans further West and stored in Adelin (Zgrodno) near Złotoryja in Lower Silesia. Fortunately, it survived the whole war and in 1947 was able to be incorporated in the collection of the relocated Ossolineum Library in Wrocław.\n\nAfter the subsequent reversal of military fortunes and a second seizure of the city of Lwów by the Soviet army, till then under German occupation, from August 1944 the library holdings became part of the so-called \"Polish Sector of the Lviv Institute of Sciences' library\". Only a small part of the library and archival material was transported from Lviv to Wrocław during 1946–1947 as a \"gift from the Ukrainian people to the Polish nation\". It arrived in two train consignments in sealed carriages in Wrocław, which was still in ruins at the time, and was opened to readers in September 1947.\n\nIn 1946–1947, the Ukrainian authorities divided the Ossolineum collection into two parts. They followed the general rule that all materials referring to or with origins in lands east of the Curzon line, especially those connected with (in the Ukrainian commission's opinion) the history and culture of West Ukraine, and those connected in any way with Russia, Belarus, Podolia, Volhynia (Wołyń), Lithuania, Turkey were to remain in Lviv. This rule applied even to those materials in which there was only a single reference to West Ukraine. As an example, a large carton of papers pertaining to Greater Poland and Silesian could not be released to Poland since it contained a single page referring to Zhovkva (Żółkiew). The same happened to foreign materials which, in the Ukrainian commission's opinion, were not connected to Poland.\n\nOriginally, the Ukrainians planned to hand over just 30,000 volumes from the \"Ossolineum Library\". This number was reviewed several times so that in May 1946 it had finally reached 150,000 items including books, prints from the 19th and 20th centuries and manuscripts. It constituted only 15–20% of the entire collection because the graphical and cartographical collections, and almost the entire collection of Polish periodicals from the 19th and 20th centuries were not taken into consideration.\nPolish staff was not allowed to participate in the decision-making and were assigned solely to technical tasks, whereas management decisions and therefore ultimate control were the preserve solely of Ukrainian staff. The premises where materials were being packed were closed off, and Polish staff were denied access to them. The whole operation was conducted in a great hurry.\nWhile dividing the collections, apparently arbitrary criteria were applied. Among the deeply questionable decisions to withhold documents were:\nIn Lviv stayed a priceless collection of the Polish press, which lay unprotected and “temporarily” stored for 50 years in the Jesuit Saints Peter and Paul Church. This collection was subsequently deliberately destroyed as a part of the Soviet tendency to eradicate any evidence of Polish heritage and its 600 year role in the history of Lviv.\n\nThe \"National Ossoliński Institute\" in Lviv was renamed \"W. Stefanyk Lviv's National Scientific Library of Ukraine\".\n\nSince 1947, the Ossolineum Library in Wrocław has been reassembled from the original collections in the Lwów Ossolineum, which Poland had only partially recovered from the Soviet authorities. It is estimated that about a third of the entire Interwar period collection found its way to Wrocław. The Wrocław city authorities allocated a former German secondary Catholic boys school, which had ceased to function in 1945, as the main building for the Ossolineum in the old St. Matthew's Academy at 37, Szewska street. Two further buildings were later provided, one at 24, Sołtysowicka Street and the other a Museum and exhibition space at \"Kamienica pod Złotym Słońcem\" at 6, Rynek ('The House under the Golden Sun' at no. 6, in the Market Square).\n\nAfter the \"Agrarian reform Act\" 1945 in Poland which abolished landed estates, the main source of finance for the Institute's maintenance dried up so the Budget took over responsibility in the new order of the Polish People's Republic. Since 1953, when the Polish Academy of Sciences came into being, the Ossolineum Library and publishing house became integrated with the Academy institutions as two distinct operations, whereas the Lubomirski Muzeum was closed down.\n\nWith an Act of January 5 1995, the National Ossoliński Institute was granted the status of a foundation subsidized from the National Exchequer. At the same time the Ossolineum stopped being part of the Polish Academy of Sciences. Relations between the Ossolineum and the Stefanyk Library were established in the early 1990s, but for a long time the parties could not come to a mutually satisfactory agreement. In 1997, Poland put forward a proposal for the return of all of the Ossolineum collections from Lviv. In 2003, the Ossolineum was offered the option of full access to the Polish collection stored in the Stefanyk Library with access to copy (scanning and microfilming) for research purposes by Polish specialists. In Wrocław an agreement was reached and signed about mutual access for copying the extant Polish and Ukrainian collections in Lviv.\n\nIn 2006, the Lviv branch of the Wrocław National Ossoliński Institute was opened. It is located in the renovated premises of the former Baworowscy Library. It consists of an exhibition hall and office for an Ossolineum employee, who is responsible for copying the collection, preparing a catalogue, vetting the condition of the collection and other maintenance needs.\n\nIn 2015 the Ossolineum library contained items, including complete editions, serial editions, incunabula, manuscripts, prints, drawings, exlibris bookplates, coins and medals, seals, documents relating to social events and microfilms.\n\nEver since Józef Ossoliński donated his own vast collection to start the foundation and persuaded Henryk Lubomirski to do likewise in 1823, Poles have continued to donate their family collections to the Ossolineum. In some instances, there were deposits as \"loans\" or deposits for \"safe-keeping\" when the clouds of war began to gather. Such donations continue to this day. The story of the autograph of \"Pan Tadeusz\" is a case in point. When the representative of the original owners of Mickiewicz's epic, the Tarnowski family, came to reclaim their \"deposit\" of the Polish national bard's manuscript after the Fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, its destiny seemed on a knife-edge. Delicate negotiations as described by the Ossolineum's director, Adolf Juzwenko, and Mr. Tarnowski eventually led to a 1/3 purchase and 2/3 donation, which managed to both indemnify the family for a sum and ensure the autograph stayed in the Ossolineum.\n\nEven before de-merging from the Polish Academy of Science, the publishing arm of the National Ossoliński Institute continued its independent publishing operation and has resumed its popular world literary classics series, \"Biblioteka Narodowa\", as well as major publishing projects, such as Roman Aftanazy's monumental work of reference \"Dzieje rezydencji na dawnych kresach Rzeczypospolitej\" - \"History of Residences in Poland's Former Eastern Borderlands\", (1991–1997), in eleven volumes by voivodship listing, illustrating and describing the cultural heritage contained in the myriad estates and grand residences in the once Polish Kresy and Inflanty regions.\n\nRestituted in part on 5 January 1995 to Wrocław as the Lubomirski Museum, it is now the Fine art section of ZNIO housed in its own building. Its foundation in Lwów traces back to a pact made between prince Henryk Lubomirski and Józef Ossoliński on 25 December 1823. In 1939 the collection was seized by the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic on behalf of the USSR. The original collection consisted of works by leading European masters and items related to the history of Poland. \n\nThe Lubomirski collection in Lwów was made up of:\n\nRepresentatives of the Polish school of art were: Bacciarelli, Brandt, Fałat, Juliusz and Wojciech Kossak, Lampi, Matejko and his first canvas, depicting the \"Union of Lublin\", Piotr Michałowski, Norblin, Aleksander Orłowski, Kazimierz Pochwalski and Leon Wyczółkowski.\n\nItems from the Lubomirski collection recovered in Kraków and in Zagrodno, Lower Silesia and part of the art that belonged to the Pawlikowski Library (Biblioteka Pawlikowskich), were handed to the Ossolineum, where they became the nucleus of the Cabinet of Graphic arts and the Numismatic section. At present there are 700 European works on paper from Henryk Lubomirski's original donation, from count Skarbek and part of the Kühnel donation. Over 1,600 drawings come from the Pawlikowski family bequest representing \"original works of Polish artists\", from the letters \"D\" to \"R\", so the drawings by Daniel Chodowiecki and Franciszek Smuglewicz are missing. There are however European prints from the Piniński bequest and several hundred Polish Art Deco and other prints of the interwar period and a collection of 218 Miniature Portraits. The remainder has been withheld in Lviv, including most of the paintings now in the \"Lviv Gallery of Art\" and part of the graphical collection, that is, works by Chodowiecki which remain in the Vasyl Stefanyk Library. Of the Dürer drawings, apart from one, they either went missing or were sold off.\n\n\n"}

A variety of laser cut shapes were developed.\n\nWhen Mini CDs were first introduced in the United States, they were initially marketed as CD3, in reference to their approximate size in inches; larger CDs were called CD5, despite the fact that both CD specifications are defined solely in terms of metric units. Now, they are known as either Mini CDs or 80 mm CDs.\n\nMost tray-loading CD devices have 2 'circular indentation'; one sized for a regular 120 mm CD, and a smaller, deeper circular indentation for Mini CDs to fit into, except for some Blu-ray players.\n\nDevices that feature a spindle also support Mini CDs, as the disc can simply be placed onto the spindle as with a normal CD.\n\nSome vertically aligned tray-loading devices, such as the older pre-slimline PlayStation 2 consoles when placed vertically, require an adapter for use with 80 mm CDs.\n\nMost slot-loading CD drives are generally incompatible (the PlayStation 3 and the car CD players in many Honda vehicles are exceptions), but adapters are available into which one can snap an 80 mm round Mini CD in order to extend the width to match that of a 120 mm CD, and thus work in many slot-loading devices.\n\nMost CD players in the late 1980s and early 1990s didn't handle the Mini CD circular indentation and required the use of an adapter, or very careful placement of the CD in the exact middle of the tray. Not until after the major record labels discontinued them, did the CD Players start to have the 80 mm circular indentation as standard.\n\nSince the mid-1990s, all tray loading players have a circular indentation for the Mini CD.\n\nMini CD-R, Mini CD-RW: As of 2007, many manufacturers offer 80 mm CD-R and CD-RW discs for sale in retail electronics and office supply stores. These are sometimes marketed as \"Pocket CD-R/CD-RW\" (Memorex) or \"Mini CD-R\" (TDK). Most of the blank discs available in retail hold either 185 MB (21 minutes) or 210 MB (24 minutes) of data. The mini discs, despite having less weight and plastic, are generally more expensive than full size CD-R/CD-RW discs.\nMini CD Replication Manufacturing: Custom-manufactured Mini CDs with integral data are available to the retail market. There are two variations on how the finished product is created:\n\nThe short lived \"Lid Rock\" promotion that gave away CD singles on the underside of soda lids from Regal Movie Theaters used Mini CDs.\n\nWhile almost any spindle-based or tray-based CD device can utilize mini CD media, some devices have been designed expressly to use the smaller format, usually for portability reasons.\n\nThe first shirt-pocket CD player was the Sony D-88 (ca. 1990). It only played standard PCM audio (Red Book) CDs. It could play 120 mm discs if a guard was moved to allow the disc to protrude from the unit.\n\nIn 2002, Compaq offered a compact, lightweight Mini CD player that made up for the capacity difference between 120 mm and 80 mm audio CDs by using MP3 compression, resulting in 1.1x to 3.5x the capacity of a standard audio CD, depending on compression ratio.\n\nMemorex offered a portable CD player that matched the form factor for the 80 mm CD (Model MPD8081). The player was marketed as an MP3 device, and the user was encouraged to burn MP3 music files to a mini CD, and then play them in the player, which was noticeably smaller than a standard portable CD player. The player could also play Red Book audio content burned onto mini CDs. It can play both CD-R and CD-RW media, as well as pressed mini CDs.\n\nSony's Mavica line of digital cameras also offered some cameras that record directly to mini CD media. There were two models, the CD350 and the CD500, which offered 3.2 megapixels and 5.0 megapixels, respectively. These cameras could also record MPEG video directly to the Mini CD - a sort of precursor to mini DVD camcorders. The media size for these devices was quoted at 156 MB, rather than 185 MB. It is possible that these devices used a packet writing format which took away some available disk space for use by formatting information. A common problem for Mavica owners has been incorrect disc size. If a disc size other than 156 MB is used, the camera will appear to work, but data loss will likely occur.\n\nThe Imation RipGo! was a portable CD-R burner that was a similar form factor to that of the Memorex Mini CD player. Again, it was marketed as an MP3 device, and it could play MP3 and WMA files burned onto Mini CD media. It was powered by an internal lithium ion battery that could power the unit for five hours of playback. The device suffered some setbacks, most notably a slow CD initialize time (the time during which the drive analyzes the contents of an MP3 CD), maximum of 4X burning speed (due to the device using USB 1.1 to connect to its host computer), and no support for CD-RW media. Some have also reported issues using the device with 24 minute (210 MB) mini CD media; the device was shipped with 21 minute (185 MB) media and seemed unreliable when burning on the slightly higher density media.\n\nSony also manufactured a mini CD burning device, designed to be \"PC-free.\" The device allowed the user to directly burn images from a Memory Stick or a USB flash drive or camera to a mini CD. It was a precursor to the various portable media storage devices such as the iPod Photo adapters and various other hard disk based photo storage units.\n\n"}

It could use both a rimless and semi-rimmed 7.7x58mm Shiki round. A 7.7 mm round could be used if needed or if other ammunition supplies dwindled. Rounds fired from the gun traveled at about , and the rate of fire was about 450 rpm. It was sometimes used as a light anti-aircraft gun during the Pacific War. It was nicknamed \"the woodpecker\" by Western Allied soldiers because of the characteristic sound it made when fired due to its relatively low rate of fire, and the \"chicken neck\" () by Chinese soldiers due to its appearance. The Type 92 had a maximum range of 4,500 meters, but a practical range of 800 meters.\n\nThe gun was intended to be fired on a tripod with a team of 3 men. The unusual tripod was designed with removable carry poles, so that the weapon could be transported fully assembled for quicker deployment.\n\nAn unusual characteristic of this gun was the placement of its iron sights – canted slightly to the right instead of center. A number of different sights were produced for the weapon, the Type 93 and Type 94 periscopic sights as well as the Type 96 telescopic sight. A ring-type anti-aircraft sight was also produced.\n\nMajor problems with this weapon included the short feed strips, which did not allow for as high a volume of fire as a belt-fed gun, and the oiler, which enabled better extraction in clean conditions but could bring dirt inside the gun in the field. The gun has an internal oil pump which is mechanically activated by the bolt. The oil pump dispenses a small amount of oil onto a brush, which then lubricates each cartridge as it is fed into the gun.\n\nIt was used extensively by the Imperial Japanese Army and Collaborationist Chinese forces. Captured weapons were also used by Chinese National Revolutionary Army troops against the Japanese during World War II, the Korean People's Army against the United Nations forces during the Korean War, the Viet Minh against the CEFEO forces during the First Indochina War, and the Indonesian Army against the Netherlands Forces during the Indonesian National Revolution. The Type 92 refers to the Japanese Imperial year 2592 – 1932 in the Gregorian calendar – in which the gun entered service.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1897847", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1897847", "title": "OTC Markets Group", "text": "OTC Markets Group\n\nOTC Markets Group (previously known as Pink Sheets) is an American financial market providing price and liquidity information for almost 10,000 over-the-counter (OTC) securities. The group has its headquarters in New York City. OTC-traded securities are organized into three markets to inform investors of opportunities and risks: OTCQX, OTCQB and Pink.\n\nThe company was first established in 1913 as the National Quotation Bureau (NQB). For decades, the NQB reported quotations for both stocks and bonds, publishing the quotations in the paper-based Pink Sheets and Yellow Sheets respectively. The publications were named for the color of paper on which they were printed. NQB was owned by CCH from 1963 to 1993. In September 1999, the NQB introduced the real-time Electronic Quotation Service. The National Quotation Bureau changed its name to Pink Sheets LLC in 2000 and subsequently to Pink OTC Markets in 2008. The company eventually changed to its current name, OTC Markets Group, in 2010. Today, a network of 89 broker-dealers price and trade a wide spectrum of securities on the OTC Markets platform.\n\nTo be quoted on the platform, companies are not required to file with the SEC, although many choose to do so. A wide range of companies are quoted on OTC Markets, including firmly established foreign firms, mostly through American depositary receipts (ADRs). In addition, many closely held, extremely small and thinly traded U.S. companies have their primary trading on the OTC Markets platform.\n\nMany foreign issuers adhere to the listing requirements of qualified foreign stock exchanges and make their home country disclosure available in English. There are also a significant number of U.S.-based issuers who are current in their reporting to regulators such as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or make available ongoing quarterly and audited annual financial reports through OTC Markets Group. Many companies in the Pink market tier of the OTC categorization system do not meet the United States' listing requirements for trading on a stock exchange such as the New York Stock Exchange or NASDAQ. Many of these issuers do not file periodic reports or make available audited financial statements, making it very difficult for investors to find reliable, unbiased information about those companies. For these reasons the SEC views many of the lower-tier companies traded on OTC Markets as \"among the most risky investments\" and advises potential investors to heavily research the companies in which they plan to invest.\n\nSecurities trading on the OTCQB and higher-tiered OTCQX trading marketplaces have status of Blue Sky secondary trading exemptions in 33 states and brokers may recommend such securities to their clients like securities listed on national stock exchanges.\n\nOTC Markets Group designates securities in one of three markets to indicate the level of financial and corporate disclosure provided by the companies using its quotation system. Apart from the OTCQX market, which has rules that include financial requirements, the designations do not signify issuer quality or merit of any security. Designation is based on the level and timeliness of a company's disclosure and OTCQB and any of the Pink categories can include both high quality as well as speculative, distressed, or questionable companies. Strict promotion policies have been enacted to flag these companies and deny their application for trading if they engage actively in campaigns marked by misleading information or manipulative promotions.\n\nThe OTCQX and OTCQB markets are considered 'Established Public Markets' by the SEC for the purpose of determining the public market price when registering securities for resale with the SEC in equity line financings. OTC Markets Group can facilitate electronic trading with its SEC-registered Alternative Trading System known as OTC Link® ATS.\n\nThe OTCQX market includes both multinational companies seeking access to U.S. investors and domestic growth companies. To be traded on this tier, companies must undergo a qualitative review by OTC Markets Group. Companies are not required to be registered with or reporting to the SEC, but they must post financial information with OTC Markets Group. In addition, U.S. companies must be ongoing operations (i.e., no shells) and may not be in bankruptcy, while foreign issuers must meet the requirements of qualified foreign exchanges. Additional oversight of OTCQX securities is provided by requiring every issuer to be sponsored by approved third-party investment banks or law firms, called OTCQX Sponsors.\n\nThe OTCQB market contains a one penny ($0.01) bid price requirement \"intended to remove companies that are most likely to be the subject of dilutive stock fraud schemes and promotions\". Each company verifies via an annual OTCQB Certification, signed by the company CEO or CFO, that their company information is current, including information about a company’s reporting status, company profile, information on management and boards, major shareholders, law firms, transfer agents, and IR / PR firms. Investor confidence improves when there is more information about a company’s ownership structure, professional advisors and service providers. This certification will be required for any security newly qualified to be publicly quoted by a broker-dealer under SEC Rule 15c2-11, or when a Pink traded company becomes a current SEC reporting company, beginning May 1, 2014. International Reporting companies are also allowed to upgrade from Pink to OTCQB if they publish their 12g3-2(b) compliant disclosure online and verify their company profile. There is an annual fee for the OTCQB market of $12,000 per year and a one-time $2,500 application fee.\n\nAs of November 2018, the OTCQX Market has Blue Sky status in 33 states and the OTCQB Market in 30 states. Blue Sky Laws are state regulations established as safeguards for investors against securities fraud. The laws, which may vary by state, typically require sellers of new issues to register their offerings and provide financial details. This allows investors to base their judgments on verifiable information. Since the SEC recognized OTCQX and OTCQB as established public markets, OTC Markets Group has worked collaboratively with state regulators since the 2014 JOBS ACT to apprise them of the easily accessible, free, public online disclosure of current information provided by companies traded on the OTCQX and OTCQB premium markets. As of April 2018, 60% of the 50 states now acknowledging the OTCQX Market for the purposes of secondary trading exemptions. The investor protection and quality control standards of the OTXQX and OTCQB therefore are of Status to meet or exceed the Blue Sky standards of the respective states.\n\nPink is an open market that has no financial standards or reporting requirements. The stock of companies in the Pink tier are not required to be registered with the SEC. Companies in this category are further categorized by the level and timeliness of information they provide to investors and may have current, limited, or no public disclosure. \n\nCompanies submitting regular Quarterly and Annual Reports go into the Current category. This category can still include shell companies or development stage companies with little or no operations as well as companies without audited financial statements. Companies in this category must not only have Quarterly reports duly posted every three months, but most have Annual reports for at least the preceding two years on file.\n\nCompanies that have submitted information no older than six months to the OTC Markets data and news service or have made a filing on the SEC's EDGAR system in the previous six months are rated as having limited information. Companies that are unwilling or unable to meet OTC Markets' Guidelines for Providing Adequate Current Information with Quarterly and Annual Reports every three months, but which still submit information at least every six months, are in this category. These are often companies with financial reporting problems, economic distress, or in bankruptcy.\n\nThis tier indicates companies that are unwilling or unable to provide disclosure to the public markets. Companies in this category do not make current information available via OTC Markets disclosure and news service, or if they do, the available information is older than six months. This category includes defunct companies that have ceased operations as well as \"dark\" companies with questionable management and market disclosure practices. Securities of publicly traded companies that are not willing to provide information to investors are considered highly risky.\n\nThere is a public interest concern associated with the company designated as Caveat Emptor. Buyer beware. This may include a spam campaign, stock promotion or known investigation of fraudulent activity committed by the company or through inside information. During a spam campaign, any stock that is not in the Current Information category will also have its quotes blocked on otcmarkets.com.\n\nThe OTC Bulletin Board (OTCBB) is only a listing of securities that are also traded \"over the counter\" similar to the OTC Markets. The OTCBB as an exchange was closed by owner FINRA. OTCBB companies are required to file timely reports to a U.S. regulatory agency. Almost all OTCBB companies are now quoted via OTC Markets' OTC Link ATS because its fully electronic trading platform better meets the needs of automated broker-dealers.\n\nSecurities that are not listed on any stock exchange nor formally quoted on OTC Markets or OTCBB are considered to be in the Grey Market. Unsolicited transactions are processed independently and not centrally listed or quoted. Trades are reported to a self-regulatory organization (SRO), which then passes the data on to market data companies. The Grey Market is also called OTOTC or Other OTC.\n\nThe Compliance Analytics Product creates a security specific risk score for all OTCQX, OTCQB, Pink and Grey securities. Risk is assessed over 19 parameters including caveat emptor, shell status, penny stock status, price/volume changes and stock promotion data. Recently, the product integrated \"Hot Sector\" information about cannabis, cryptocurrency and blockchain.\n\nThe Promotion Data Product provides market professionals and investors with active and historical promotion data for OTCQX, OTCQB, Pink and Grey securities.\n\nThe company calculates and licenses indices of securities that trade on one of the top two market tiers, including the OTCM QX ADR 30 Index of OTCQX-traded American depository receipts \n\n"}

Several other projects were completed including a 3-LP boxset titled \"Domineer/Asesino/Retro\" and a CD release titled \"Life-Sense Revoked\", a collaboration with other artists.\n\nPBK has performed live throughout the U.S. and in Europe. A restless collaborator, he has worked with some of the most respected names in experimental music. A partial list would include such musicians as Asmus Tietchens, Aube, Jarboe(Swans), Jim O'Rourke, Minóy, Vidna Obmana and Wolf Eyes. Over the course of nearly thirty years PBK has had over 75 full-length albums released internationally, establishing a complex body of work that reveals a unique approach to the Noise music aesthetic.\n\n"}
{"id": "1897854", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1897854", "title": "Harold Glasser", "text": "Harold Glasser\n\nHarold Glasser (November 24, 1905 – November 16, 1992) was an economist in the United States Department of the Treasury and spokesman on the affairs of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) 'throughout its whole life' and he had a 'predominant voice' in determining which countries should receive aid. Glasser was a member of the Perlo group of Soviet spies during World War II and worked closely with Harry Dexter White. His code name in Soviet intelligence and in the Venona files is \"Ruble\".\n\nHarold Glasser joined the United States Department of Treasury in 1936 and became its assistant director of the Division of Monetary Research by late 1938. In 1937, J. Peters transferred Glasser to the Soviet Main Intelligence Directorate (\"Glavnoe Razvedyvatel'noe Upravlenie\") or GRU in order to report on Harry Dexter White's cooperation with Soviet intelligence (Soviet case officer Boris Bykov had pressured Whittaker Chambers on the subject of White's intelligence production). Glasser, the number two man in the division beneath White, reported back that as far as he could discern, White was providing everything of importance.\n\nIn 1940, Glasser was appointed Chief American economic adviser to Ecuador through a joint program of the Treasury and U.S. Department of State. In December 1941, the Secret Service forwarded a report to Harry Dexter White indicating that it had evidence Glasser was involved in Communist activities. White never acted on the report. Glasser continued to serve in Ecuador until 1942.\n\nAfter America became involved in World War II, Glasser received appointments to higher-level positions, such as Vice-Chairman of the War Production Board, was dispatched to serve as economic adviser to American forces in North Africa, U.S. Treasury representative to the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, and Treasury representative to the Allied High Commission in Italy.\n\nWhen Glasser returned to the United States in 1944, he reestablished contact with the Perlo group. Victor Perlo, the groups head, explained to Elizabeth Bentley that Glasser had been a member of the group before the War started, and Glasser was transferred to work with another group. Charles Kramer, another member of the Perlo group, told Bentley that Glasser joined Alger Hiss' group.\n\nIn a 25 April 1945 memo from Pavel Fitin, head of KGB foreign intelligence, to Vsevolod Merkulov, head of the overall KGB organization, Fitin asked fair treatment for an award to be given to a longtime operative, Harold Glasser. Fitin called Merkulov's attention to the fact that Glasser had been working for Soviet intelligence for a long time, since May 1937, usually for the KGB but also at times for the GRU. Fitin explained how, while Glasser was working with the GRU, Glasser felt he had been slighted. Fitin explained how the group of GRU agents of which Glasser was part, was decorated with honors of the Soviet Union, but Glasser had been neglected because of his transfer back to KGB. The text from KGB Archives reads in part as follows:\n\nOur agent RUBLE, drawn to work for the Soviet Union in May 1937, passed initially through the military \"neighbors\" and then through our station valuable information on political and economic issues. ... To our work RUBLE gives much attention and energy is devoted and disciplined agent.\n\nAccording to data from VADIM the group of agents of the \"military\" neighbors whose part RUBLE was earlier, recently was decorated with orders of the USSR. RUBLE learned about this fact from his friend ALES, who is the head of the mentioned group. Taking into account RUBLE's devoted work for the USSR for eight years and the fact that, as a result of transfer to our station, RUBLE was not decorated together with other members of the ALES group, consider expedient to put him forward for a decoration of the Order of the Red Star. Ask for your consent.\n\nFitin's account corroborates Elizabeth Bentley's deposition.\n\nIn the transcript # 1759 KGB Washington to Moscow 28 March 1945, Glasser reports the Treasury Department is sending a young lawyer, Josiah DuBois, to Moscow to serve on the American delegation to the Allied Reparations Commission meeting. Glasser says he established \"most friendly relations\" with DuBois and judged him to be ideologically a Communist, although he was not a CPUSA member. Glasser reports how he counseled DuBois to be more \"discreet\" in expressing left-wing views and notes that his personal relationship with DuBois was such that he could \"normally obtain by asking\" anything he wanted.\n\nGlasser is in the subject of several June 1945 Venona cables. Three June 1945 transcripts report Glasser's transmitting U.S. State Department reports of Soviet war losses, a State Department report on a Finnish company believed to be hiding Nazi financial assets, and an Office of Strategic Services report on the movement of Nazi gold through Swiss banks.\n\nAfter the war, he was economic adviser to the American delegation at the Council of Foreign Ministers meeting in Moscow in 1947 and economic adviser to the Treasury secretary at the board of governors meeting of the World Bank. In December 1947, at the time of his resignation, Glasser was assistant director of Treasury's Office of International Finance.\n\nGlasser's promotions and job ratings throughout his career were determined by fellow Communists Frank Coe and William Ullmann; promotions and job ratings were reviewed and backed by Harry Dexter White. Transcripts of Glasser's promotions and job rating forms signed by Coe, Ullmann, and White are in \"Interlocking Subversion in Government Departments\" Report.\n\nPavel Fitin later described as \"valuable\" the political and economic information Glasser passed along, all of which found its way into thirty-four special reports to Joseph Stalin and other top Kremlin leaders. Glasser's materials were \"all of critical interest to the leadership of the USSR\" because it included the contents of an Office of Strategic Services (OSS) memorandum about the economic consequences of stripping Germany of heavy industry; an internal memorandum from the Department of the Treasury concerning conferences at State Department on postwar reparations; and an internal memorandum by the Treasury Department concerning Lend-Lease policy toward the Soviet Union. A 4 June 1945 cable reports Glasser would be on the Treasury committee advising Supreme Court Justice Robert Jackson, the U.S. prosecutor at the Nuremberg War Crimes Tribunal.\n\nHe died on November 16, 1992.\n\nHarold Glasser is referenced in the following decrypted Venona project cables:\n\n\n"}

His mother Madelaine was the daughter of the fur trader John Askin and an Ottawa woman. His father, Dr. Robert Richardson, was a surgeon with the Queen's Rangers. As a young boy, Richardson lived for a time with his grandparents in Detroit and later with his parents at Fort Malden, Amherstburg. His time at Fort Malden would later impact his literature and his life.\n\nAt age 16, Richardson enlisted in the British 41at Regiment of Foot. During his service with this regiment. he met Chief Tecumseh and Major General Isaac Brock, whom he later wrote about in his novel \"The Canadian Brothers\". While stationed at Fort Malden during the War of 1812, Richardson witnessed the execution of an American prisoner by Tecumseh's forces at the River Raisin, a traumatic experience which haunted him for the rest of his life. During the War of 1812, Richardson was imprisoned for a year in the United States after his capture during the battle of Moraviantown.\n\nRichardson was commissioned into the 8th Foot in 1813, exchanged into the 2nd Foot in 1816 and transferred to the 92nd Foot in 1818. His later military service took him to England and, for two years, to the West Indies. While in the West Indies, Richardson was appalled by the treatment of slaves there. \n\nRichardson stated that his mixed racial background made him uneasy with his fellow officers in the West Indies. This may have contributed to his evenhanded treatment of First Nations people in his novels. Richardson's most savage characters, Wacousta in the novel \"Wacousta\" (1832) and Desborough in \"The Canadian Brothers\" (1840), are in fact white men who have turned \"savage\".\n\nRichardson began his fiction-writing career with novels about the British and French societies of his time. In his third and most successful novel, \"Wacousta\", he turned to the North American frontier for his setting and history. He followed the same practice in the sequel, \"The Canadian Brothers\".\n\nIn 1838, Richardson returned to Canada from England, promoted to the rank of major. He tried to earn his livelihood by writing fiction and by setting up a series of weekly newspapers. He was appointed superintendent of the police on the Welland Canal in 1845, but was fired the next year. In 1849 Richardson moved to New York City, where he continued to write fiction. However, his attempts to build a literary career in the US failed.\n\nJohn Richardson died (supposedly of starvation) in New York City in 1852. He was buried in the paupers' cemetery in New York; his grave site is unknown.\n\n\n"}

Police began as a three-part OVA series seen as a prequel to the \"Bubblegum\" series that was called \"A.D. Police Files\" released in 1990. Nine years later the production team decided to use the world view/ background of the original A.D. Police and fleshed it out a bit more, making an animated series consisting of 12 30-minute episodes. By updating the storyline as well as adding more updated elements of reality that have to do with the coming of the new millennium, the makers of the new A.D. Police series sought to create a series that surpassed its predecessor. \n\nIn the not-too-distant future VOOMERS (VOodoo Organic Metal Extension Resource), robots manufactured by the Genom Corporation, take care of most of the manual labor in Genom City. Recently the VOOMERS have been malfunctioning and becoming BOOMERS, crazed robots who are often involved in many violent and criminal activities. This is when the A.D. Police comes into play. They are Genom City's anti-robot crime division, specially trained to deal with VOOMER-related situations. Kenji Sasaki is one of the A.D. Police's most skilled officers. His biggest problem is that he doesn't follow orders and his partners either end up getting killed or seriously injured. Enter Hans Kleif, Kenji's newest partner and an amnesiac who was recently transferred to Genom City. Together the two must overcome their differences, fight their past demons, and come together to ensure that Genom City survives the onslaught of the BOOMERS.\n\n\"A.D. Police: To Protect and Serve\" is available in North America in a 2-disc special edition DVD from ADV Films. The original series is on DVD from Animeigo.\n\nIn 1999 Tokyo was ravaged by an enormous earthquake, leaving the city a desolate wasteland. The government functions relocated to the surrounding suburbs, leaving the former capital to deteriorate into a slum. Reconstruction of the area was thought impossible until a company named Genom, a corporation that made humanoid machines called VOOMERS, began to implement a plan to rebuild Tokyo in 2005. Tokyo has been reborn as \"Genom City\", a metropolis completely under the control of Genom. This resurrection did not come without a price, as overdrive accidents concerning illegal VOOMERS produced by \"Packer Syndicate\" have been on the rise.\n\nThe story is based around the lives of Sasaki Kenji and Hans Kleif, two young A.D. Police Detectives who find themselves forging a bond after being forced to work together in order to stop the rogue VOOMERS from turning Genom City back into an urban wasteland. Kenji is a loner who is known for his lack of teamwork. It is this attitude that causes many of his previous partners to be injured or even killed. His latest partner, Paul, was heavily injured during their last mission together and it is said that nobody is willing to work with Kenji. He goes to his favorite bar and has a fight with a man named Hans. When he goes to his office the next morning, he is informed that Hans is actually his new partner. \n\nThroughout the series Kenji, Hans, and the rest of the A.D. Police Force find themselves pitted against Liam Fletcher, the series' main antagonist and a leading figure in the Packer Syndicate. The series features different members of the police force responding to BOOMER-related situations and growing closer, not only as a unit of police officers, but as a group of friends. The series places an extremely heavy emphasis on the growing relationship between Kenji and Hans although others, such as the romantic connection between Kenji and Kyoko, also play an important role.\n\nKenji Sasaki\n\nKenji is a lone wolf who refuses to work alongside anyone, believing that he can do anything on his own. Recognized among the A.D. Police force due to his superior vision and reflexes, his only major falling is his tendency to put his partners into unnecessary danger. He is the strong, silent type but begins to open up gradually thanks to his girlfriend, Kyoko, and his partner, Hans.\n\nHans Kleif\n\nAfter an accident in which a piece of shrapnel gets embedded in his brain, Hans loses all memories of his past. He was transferred from the regular police force in Germany and joins the A.D. Police as the resident rookie. His great sense of humor and friendly attitude make him much easier to get along with than Kenji, and it comes as no surprise that the two do not get along well when they first meet. Slowly but surely Hans gets adapted to this new life, but he still worries about the memories he lost.\n\nHideaki Kurata\n\nKurata is a man who refuses to leave the frontlines of the war against the BOOMERS. He has had many chances for promotion but has always refused the jobs that would take him away from the action. He cares for his crew members, and refuses to leave their side. His love with his ex-girlfriend, Nancy, also makes it harder for him to leave his job.\n\nNancy Wilson\n\nNancy is a beautiful and assertive New York native. She used to date Kurata, but the couple broke up and Nancy married another. She is recently divorced and her responsibilities as the Section Manager often seem to supersede those of a mother.

From 1910 until the mid-1930s, the American Giants were the most dominant team in black baseball. Charter members of Foster's Negro National League, the American Giants won five pennants in that league, along with another pennant in the 1932 Negro Southern League and a second-half championship in Gus Greenlee's Negro National League in 1934. The team ended in 1956.\n\nIn 1910, Foster, captain of the Chicago Leland Giants, wrested legal control of the name \"Leland Giants\" away from the team's owner, Frank Leland. That season, featuring Hall of Fame shortstop John Henry Lloyd, outfielder Pete Hill, second baseman Grant Johnson, catcher Bruce Petway, and pitcher Frank Wickware, the Leland Giants reportedly won 123 games while losing only 6. In 1911, Foster renamed the club the \"American Giants.\"\n\nPlaying in spacious Schorling Park (formerly the home field of the American League's Chicago White Sox), Foster's club relied on fielding, pitching, speed, and \"inside baseball\" to succeed in the young Negro National League (NNL), winning championships in 1920, 1921, and 1922. When the Kansas City Monarchs supplanted the American Giants as the dominant team beginning in 1923, Foster tried rebuilding but by 1926 his health (physical and mental) was failing. Accordingly, his protégé Dave Malarcher took over on-field management of the team. Malarcher followed Foster's pattern, emphasizing pitching and defense, and led the American Giants back to the top-tier of the Negro leagues, winning pennants in 1926 and 1927. Both seasons also saw the American Giants defeat the Bacharach Giants of Atlantic City, champions of the Eastern Colored League, in the Negro League World Series.\n\nThe NNL collapsed in 1931, and in 1932 the team won the Negro Southern League pennant as Cole's American Giants. The next season the American Giants joined the new Negro National League, losing the pennant to the Pittsburgh Crawfords in a controversial decision by league president Gus Greenlee (owner of the Crawfords). The 1933 season saw the Giants get kicked off of their home field after the end of May; the park owners preferred to use the land as a dog racing track for the remaining summer months. This forced the Giants to play the majority of their home games in Indianapolis for the balance of that season. In 1934, the American Giants won the NNL's second-half title, then fell to the Philadelphia Stars in a seven-game playoff for the championship. In 1937, after a year spent playing as an independent club, the American Giants became a charter member of yet another circuit, the Negro American League.\n\nTed \"Double Duty\" Radcliffe was appointed manager in 1950. The team's owner, Dr. J.B. Martin, was concerned about black players joining major league teams so he instructed Radcliffe to sign white players. Radcliffe recruited at least five young white players (Lou Chirban, Lou Clarizio, Al Dubetts, Frank Dyall, and Stanley Miarka).\n\nThe Giants first played at South Side Park (III) (1920–1940) and Perry Stadium (Indianapolis) (1933), when South Side Park was briefly re-purposed mid-season in 1933. Finally, they shared Comiskey Park (I) (1941–1956), playing when the White Sox were on the road.\n\nThe Chicago White Sox have honored the Giants by wearing replica uniforms during regular-season baseball games on several occasions, including July 1, 2007 (at Kansas City), July 26, 2008 (at home vs. Detroit) and July 16, 2011 during the 9th Annual Negro League weekend at Detroit, where the home team also worn the jerseys of the Detroit Stars during the 17th Annual Negro League Tribute Game.\n\n\n - for a comprehensive list of players\n\n° Negro League Traveling Exhibit\n"}

Federal judges, prisoners and those in mental institutions have gained the franchise as a result of this provision, whereas the restriction on minors voting was found to be permissible due to section 1.\n\nSection 3 is one of the provisions in the \"Charter\" that cannot be overridden by Parliament or a legislative assembly under Section 33 of the Charter, the notwithstanding clause. Section 3's exemption from Section 33 provides extra legal protection to the right to vote and it may prevent Parliament or the provincial governments from disenfranchising any Canadian citizen for ideological or political purposes, among others.\n\nUnder the heading \"Democratic Rights,\" the section reads:\n\nNo formal right to vote existed in Canada before the adoption of the \"Charter\". There was no such right, for example, in the \"Canadian Bill of Rights\". Indeed, in the case \"Cunningham v. Tomey Homma\" (1903), it was found that the government could legally deny the vote to Japanese Canadians and Chinese Canadians (although both groups would go on to achieve the franchise before section 3 came into force).\n\nThe section has generated some case law expanding the franchise. In 1988, section 3 had been used to grant suffrage to federal judges and those in mental institutions. A more controversial example is \"Sauvé v. Canada\" (2002), in which it was found that prisoners could vote. They did so in the 2004 federal election, despite public opposition from Conservative leader Stephen Harper.\n\nIn the 2002 case \"Fitzgerald v. Alberta\", the Court of Queen's Bench of Alberta found that although a minimum voting age of 18 violated section 3 of the Charter, it was justifiable under section 1 of the Charter. The decision was upheld upon appeal.\n\nIn Figueroa v Canada (AG) the court determined that Section 3 explicitly grants both the right to vote and the right to run for office to all Canadian citizens. In Szuchewycz v. Canada the Court of Queen's Bench of Alberta found that the $1000 federal candidate deposit requirement violated Section 3 and could not be justified under Section 1. Justice Inglis noted in paragraph 59 \"I agree that the potential to prevent a serious and impressive candidate from running in an election, due to the financial pressure a $1000 deposit could create, is a real risk of the requirement. In my opinion, the impugned Deposit Requirement Provision would infringe many individuals’ – including the Applicant’s – ability to communicate their messages to the public, and participate meaningfully in the electoral process as a candidate.\"\n\nGenerally, the courts have interpreted section 3 as being more generous than simply providing a right to vote. As stated in the case \"Figueroa v. Canada\" (2003), the section has been viewed as a constitutional guarantee to \"play a meaningful role in the electoral process,\" which in turn encourages governmental \"respect for a diversity of beliefs and opinions.\" This does not mean, however, that interest groups have complete freedom to promote their beliefs and opinions. Since the voter must have an opportunity to balance \"various\" ideas in his or her own mind before \"meaningfully\" participating in an election, the Supreme Court has, in the case \"Harper v. Canada (Attorney General)\" (2004), upheld laws that limit the amount of money a single group can contribute in the election (to prevent a monopolization of the campaign).\n\nAlthough one cannot see this on the face of the Charter, the Supreme Court has also ruled that section 3 guarantees a measure of equality in voting. In \"Reference re Prov. Electoral Boundaries (Sask.)\" (1991), it was found that constituencies should have roughly the same number of voters, although perfection was not required. The reasoning behind this expansion of section three's meaning was that it supposedly reflected the original purpose of the section, namely to allow \"effective representation.\" The concession that perfection is not required stemmed from the fact that perfection would be impractical, given geographical limits in drawing boundaries and a general desire to give minorities more representation. While Saskatchewan's constituencies were found to be valid in the 1991 decision, Prince Edward Island's were later deemed unconstitutional by the courts and the province's electoral map had to be redrawn.\n\nWhile section 3's reach has been expanded to cover the sizes of constituencies, it has not been extended to guarantee the right to vote in a referendum. In \"Haig v. Canada\" (1993), it was ruled that since section 3 was designed in specific reference to electing representatives, the right could not include participation in a \"device for the gathering of opinions\". It was also noted that unlike elections, governments do not have to hold referendums, nor do governments have to commit themselves to the result of a referendum. Thus, how a referendum is administered is within governmental discretion.\n\n"}
{"id": "1897901", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1897901", "title": "Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Ranchi", "text": "Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Ranchi\n\nThe Ranchi Catholic Archdiocese (Latin: \"Archidioecesis Ranchiensis\") comprises the districts of Ranchi and Lohardaga of Jharkhand state, India. It was established by a decree of the Holy See dated 25 May 1927, when it was separated from the Calcutta Archdiocese to form a new Diocese, with its episcopal seat at Ranchi. In 1953 it was elevated to the status of an archdiocese. The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Ranchi declares that it \"subscribes to ahimsa and satyagraha\".\n\nThe first Belgian Jesuit to enter Chotanagpur was Fr Auguste Stockman. He traveled by bullock cart from Midnapur and after a difficult journey of a fortnight reached Chaibasa on 25 November 1868. His work among the Ho tribe did not yield results, so he moved towards Ranchi district in January 1875.\n\nOther Belgian Jesuits came to Ranchi in 1877 to act as military chaplains to the troops at Doranda (Ranchi). As the prospects of evangelization among the tribals of Chotanagpur were bright, the first mission stations were opened among the Mundas. However, the real impetus came from Fr Constant Lievens, who arrived at Doranda on 18 March 1885. He is often called the Apostle of Chotanagpur. He left Ranchi on 26 August 1892, a broken man. He died at Leuven in Belgium on 7 November 1893. A century later on 7 November 1993 his mortal remains were re-interred in the Ranchi Cathedral.\n\nTo assist the missionaries, the Loreto Sisters from Ireland opened a convent in the red Lodge on Purulia Road, Ranchi, in March 1890. It was here that the Daughters of St. Anne, a Diocesan Congregation, had their beginning in 1897. The Ursuline Sisters of Tildonk, Belgium established themselves in the same compound on 13 January 1903.\n\nBy 1927 the Ranchi Mission had developed to such an extent that by decree of the Holy See, dated 25 May 1927, it was separated from the Calcutta Archdiocese to form a new Diocese with Ranchi as its Episcopal seat and Msgr. , sj, as the first bishop. He was succeeded by Rt. Rev. Oscar Sevrin sj, in 1934, who was pastor for 18 years (1934 - 1952).\n\nAs the faith spread and took firm root in Chotanagpur, the Catholic Church was being built up and developed, especially through parishes and schools. Soon the rapid growth of the mission made it imperative to call in other labourers, the S.V.D. Fathers, the Australian and American Jesuits.\n\nFor better pastoral care of the faithful, the vast Archdiocese of Ranchi was divided and on 14 June 1951, the Diocese of Sambalpur gave birth to Rourkela Diocese on 4 July 1979 and Ambikapur became a separate diocese on 14 December 1977. On 19 September 1953, the Diocese of Ranchi was raised to the status of an Archdiocese with Sambalpur and Cuttack as its suffragans. On 2 July 1962, the Diocese of Jamshedpur was created. Then in 1968, the Diocese of Patna and Bhagalpur and the Prefecture of Balasore were made suffragans of Ranchi Archdiocese. Again on 5 June 1971 the Diocese of Daltonganj, comprising the civil districts of Hazaribagh (which itself became a diocese on 12 May 1995), and Palamau was carved out of the Archdiocese of Ranchi. In 1980, Muzaffarpur Diocese was formed from a part of Patna Diocese and made suffragan of Ranchi.\n\nThe Andamans and Nicobar Islands, became part of Ranchi in 1947, and were since 1966 under the care of the Pilar Fathers, and became a new Diocese on 26 June 1984.\n\nOn 1 July 1993, two new Dioceses, Gumla and Simdega, were established with territories taken from the Ranchi Archdiocese. On 12 May 1995 the new Diocese of Khunti was established with territories taken from the Archdiocese of Ranchi. It comprises the whole Khunti civil Sub-division. In 1998 two more new Dioceses were created, North of the Ganges, and made suffragans of Ranchi, Bettiah and Purnea.\n\nThus the original Ranchi Diocese divided into 14 Dioceses including the present Archdiocese of Ranchi. On 16 March 1999 the Ranchi Ecclesiastical Province was bifurcated in anticipation of the creation of Jharkhand. Patna, Capital of Bihar, became an Archdiocese with four suffragans: Bettiah, Bhagalpur, Muzaffarpur and Purnea.\n\nThe dioceses Daltonganj, Dumka, Gumla, Hazaribag, Jamshedpur, Khunti, Port Blair and Simdega are suffragans of the archdiocese.\n\nCardinal Telesphore Toppo was Archbishop of Ranchi from 1985 to 2018.\n\nVincent Barwa is auxiliary bishop since 2004. Binay Kandulna was appointed auxiliary bishop in February 2009.\n\nFelix Toppo is the present Archbishop of Ranchi.

As a part of a broader range of legal rights guaranteed by the Charter, section 10 rights may be limited by the Oakes test and/or the notwithstanding clause. However, section 10 has also spawned considerable litigation, and has made an impact in numerous cases.\n\nThe section reads:\n\nSection 10 is only triggered if a person is arrested or detained. In R v Grant, the Supreme Court stated that \"detention\" refers to a suspension of an individual's liberty interest by a significant physical or psychological restraint. Psychological detention is established either where the individual has a legal obligation to comply with the restrictive request or demand, or a reasonable person would conclude from the state conduct that there was no choice but to comply.\n\nIn cases without physical restraint or legal obligation, it may not be clear whether a person has been detained. To determine whether a reasonable person in the individual’s circumstances would conclude they had been deprived by the state of the liberty of choice, the court may consider, \"inter alia\", the following factors:\n\n\nSection 10(a) requires that a person who is arrested or detained must be told why.\" In R. v. Latimer (1997)\", the Supreme Court of Canada considered an argument in which a person, Robert Latimer, was told he was being \"detained\", but was not told he was being \"arrested\" and could be charged with the murder of his daughter. The Court found section 10(a) was not infringed. Section 10(a) is meant to ensure those arrested or detained are aware of the gravity of the situation. Latimer argued that since the police did not call the detention an arrest, he was not fully aware of the severity of the trouble he was in. He also claimed this was the reason why he had declined to talk to a lawyer. The Court argued the words used did not matter, but rather how the suspect can interpret the situation. Latimer could be expected to understand the seriousness of the situation since he was told he was being detained in connection with his daughter's death. The police had explicitly said the situation was serious, and had told him of rights one has when being arrested.\n\nThe right to consult a lawyer is considered to be important, and the courts have been understanding if, even in cases in which the person arrested or detained preferred not to see any lawyer, it is later argued section 10 is violated because the arrested or detained person did not know any better. This applies, for example, to cases in which the arrested or detained person has a low IQ.\n\nSection 10 has also been held not only to guarantee the right to see a lawyer, but also a right to be told that one may see a lawyer, a right to legal aid, and a right to be told that one may seek legal aid. Although the right to counsel itself could be found in the 1960 Canadian Bill of Rights, the right to be \"told\" that one may see counsel is new to Canadian bills of rights. Indeed, in the Bill of Rights case \"Hogan v. The Queen\" (1978), the Supreme Court found the right to be told that one may see a lawyer did not exist even in a penumbra of the Bill of Rights. \"In effect,\" Professors F.L. Morton and Rainer Knopff write, \"section 10(b) of the Charter overrules \"Hogan\".\"\n\nIn \"R. v. Bartle\" (1994) the Supreme Court ruled that rights to be informed that one may seek counsel included rights to be told of duty counsel and how to obtain it (e.g., through a free telephone call).\n"}
{"id": "1897938", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1897938", "title": "Section 16 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms", "text": "Section 16 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms\n\nSection 16 of the \"Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms\" is the first of several sections of the Constitution dealing with Canada's two official languages, English and French. Section 16 declares that English and French are the official languages of Canada and of the province of New Brunswick.\n\nUnder the heading \"Official Languages of Canada\", the section reads:\n\nThis section sets out general principles that are expanded in sections 16.1 to 22. Section 16 itself expands upon language rights in the \"Constitution Act, 1867\"; whereas section 133 of the \"Constitution Act, 1867\" merely allowed for both languages to be used in the Parliament of Canada and in the Quebec legislature, and in some courts, section 16 goes further by allowing bilingualism in the federal and New Brunswick bureaucracies, and in the New Brunswick legislature. This was not entirely new, as Canada's \"Official Languages Act\" had provided for this at the federal level since 1969, and New Brunswick had similar legislation. Those laws, however, were merely statutes, and section 16 thus made some of their key aspects into constitutional principles.\n\nIt has not been easy to understand how section 16 can be applied. In \"Société des Acadiens v. Association of Parents\" (1986), Chief Justice Brian Dickson made reference to the \"academic debate about the precise significance of s. 16,\" and the question of \"Whether s. 16 is visionary, declaratory or substantive in nature.\" He did, however, decide that \"at the very least it provides a strong indicator of the purpose of the language guarantees in the Charter [ie., sections 17 to 22]... the federal government of Canada and the government of New Brunswick have demonstrated their commitment to official bilingualism within their respective jurisdictions.\"\n\nIn the same case, Justice Jean Beetz wrote that the political nature of section 16, as opposed to the generous nature of the rights in the rest of the Charter, indicate that courts should be cautious in interpreting section 16 in new ways. Elected governments would play a larger role in determining its scope. Justice Bertha Wilson went on to speculate that section 16 is meant to represent an opportunity for expansion of language rights. Thus, courts must always ask themselves how their rulings fit in with the current state of affairs regarding official languages policy, and how their rulings are consistent with it. While the rights guaranteed under another language provision of the \"Charter\", section 20, are limited, this does not mean that section 16 is limited or cannot have an effect on the growth of language rights. As far as New Brunswick is concerned, she added, bilingualism was considered \"crucial\" to \"social and cultural development,\" and thus there should be \"heightened public expectations\" that this could be supported by the \"Charter\".\n\nIn \"R. v. Beaulac\" (1999), the Supreme Court rejected some of its earlier conservative interpretations. It ruled that a purposive (generous) interpretation would be appropriate for language rights, since this would help minority language communities (i.e. those who speak English or French in a region where that language is the minority language) achieve equality.\n\nMany \"Charter\" cases regarding the use of the English and French languages have not been fought on the grounds of section 16. For example, Quebec's Bill 101, which limited the use of English, was considered to be invalid in certain respects not because it conflicted with section 16, but because it infringed freedom of expression, which is guaranteed by section 2 of the \"Charter\".\n\nLikewise, section 16 does not really apply to provinces besides New Brunswick; as the only province that currently considers itself to be officially bilingual, New Brunswick is the only province to have its bilingualism guaranteed by section 16. When Manitoba's laws declaring English to be the only official language of the province were found to be invalid in \"Re Manitoba Language Rights\" (1985), this was due to its contradictions with the \"Manitoba Act\".\n\nSubsection 16(3) provides that a Parliament or provincial government may strive for progress in official bilingualism. This reflects a 1975 court decision, \"Jones v. Attorney General of New Brunswick\", in which it was found governments may do this. Thus, the Supreme Court in \"Société des Acadiens\" has argued that it is the elected governments and \"political compromise\", rather than the courts, that will mostly advance language rights.\n\nJustice Wilson added that subsection 16(3) demonstrates that while language rights need to be improved, they should not be eroded once they have been established.\n\n"}
