The park lies between the gardens of Hampton Court Palace and Kingston upon Thames and Surbiton in south west London, England, mostly within the post town of East Molesey, but with its eastern extremity within the post town of Kingston. In 2014, part of the park was designated a biological Site of Special Scientific Interest (with Bushy Park and Hampton Court Golf Course). It takes up most of the final (lowest) meander of the non-tidal reaches of the River Thames and is mainly divided between a golf course, meadows interspersed with trees used for deer, seasonal horse grazing and wildlife. A corner of the park is used annually for the Hampton Court Flower Show and the part nearest to the palace has the Long Water — an early set of hydro-engineered ponds or lakes, fed by water from the distant River Colne, as are the bodies of water in the neighbouring park, Bushy Park.\n\nHampton Court Park is a walled deer park of around (1.1 sq mi), with a herd of fallow deer, and has been open to the public since 1894. Verges by the A308 road lightly scattered with deciduous trees line the northern wall. These trees, with few evergreens, continue across much of the park. It is documented Cardinal Wolsey inclosed with a wall about 2,000 acres to form this park and Bushy Park for his purchase and reconstruction into an exceptionally grand house on the former manor house of Hampton. It formed what became before his death Hampton Court Palace, taken over by Henry VIII. The king was an avid hunter and had the park used for breeding rabbits and/or hares, pheasants and partridges.\n\nThe inventory of Cromwell's goods made in 1659 records \"about 700 deer\", compared to \"about 1,700\" and \"about 30 red deer\" in Bushy Park. \n\n\nA tree, called the Mediaeval Oak (or Methuselah's Oak), in one of the tees for the golf course in the southern part of the park, is said to be 750 years old.\n\n\nThe public towpath by the lowest part of the non-tidal Thames above Teddington Lock lies in all other directions apart from the palace (west). An emergency conditions flood meadow but not a lowered \"Flood Storage Area\" most of it is in planning (policy Flood Zone 2 or 3, and mostly in long term flood risk zones ranging across its four categories (very low to high risk) High risk, affecting a small portion means that each year this area has a chance of flooding of greater than 3.3%.\n\nNorth of the road and a cluster of houses connected with the parks is a narrow set of Paddocks and Bushy Park; the Royal Mews graze horses on the park in the summer.\n\nThe Long Water, a namesake of a more well-visited lake in Kensington Gardens (see The Long Water), flows gently in the park roughly eastward from the back of Hampton Court Palace ending at the Golden Jubilee Fountain and is underground connected to a landscaped channel, the Longford River after the Upper Lodge Water Gardens and the Diana Fountain, Bushy Park.\n\nThe annual Hampton Court Flower Show is held in of the park. It is organized by the Royal Horticultural Society and began in 1990. Many prefer it to the better known Chelsea Flower Show because there is more space, and plants and equipment can be bought at the show. As it is the world's most popular event of this type extensive traffic jams can build up. The show has sometimes been criticized for risking damage to historic features in the park.\n\n\n"}

The first batch was classified 168/0 under TOPS and resembled the Class 165 units previously built by BREL York. The Networker-design cab was an interim solution pending the design of a completely new cab for further Turbostar batches. Subsequent builds, subclassed as 168/1 and 168/2, were constructed at the same time as the Class 170 Turbostar and thus are part of the Turbostar family of trains.\n\nThe first batch of Clubman carriages ordered by Chiltern Railways were the first units ordered by any train operating company since the privatisation of the UK industry in 1996. They were delivered as 3-car sets but later lengthened to 4-car sets.\n\nA typical Class 168 consists of 2+2 standard-class seating throughout, arranged either around tables or in airline-style seating with pull-down tables.

{"id": "2264838", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2264838", "title": "Urban Renewal Authority", "text": "Urban Renewal Authority\n\nThe Urban Renewal Authority (URA) is a quasi-governmental, profit-making statutory body in Hong Kong responsible for accelerating urban redevelopment.\n\nThe authority's predecessor, the Land Development Corporation (土地發展公司, or 土發 for short), was founded in 1988. The new Urban Renewal Authority was founded in 1999 with the aim of speeding up urban renewal. Difficulties reaching agreement on compensation packages for people affected by planned redevelopments delayed the actual commencement of the URA. The agency was finally established on 1 May 2001 and the LDC was dissolved the same day.\n\nA main difference between the former LDC and the URA is the URA's ability to directly resume land (akin to expropriation in other countries). The LDC was required to undertake lengthy negotiations with owners in order to acquire land, and had to demonstrate that it had taken all steps to acquire land on a fair and reasonable basis before it could apply to the Secretary for Planning, Environment and Lands for compulsory land resumption. The difficulty in overriding dissenting property owners was the main reason the LDC was slow to undertake urban renewal.\n\nUnlike the LDC, the URA is also tax-exempt.\n\nAt present, there are about 16,000 private buildings that are 30 or more years old within the metro area of Hong Kong Island, Kowloon, Tsuen Wan District and Kwai Tsing District. By 2030, the number of buildings over 30 years old will increase fourfold.\n\nUrban renewal in Hong Kong typically involves relatively large-scale redevelopment of urban areas, rather than piecemeal rebuilding of individual buildings or the provision of specific facilities. Streets are often closed, combining smaller urban blocks into larger superblocks. When urban renewal is announced for a specific area, a \"freezing survey\" is undertaken to identify the current inhabitants, with an aim to preventing opportunists from moving into urban renewal sites in order to receive compensation. The URA then compensates owners and demolishes the district. URA redevelopments generally comprise luxury shopping centres and luxury residential developments.\n\nWith the stated aim to address the problem of urban decay and improve the living conditions of residents in dilapidated areas, the Urban Renewal Authority Ordinance (Chapter 563) was enacted in July 2000. The Ordinance provides a new institutional framework for carrying out urban renewal in locations that the private market finds unprofitable. The Hong Kong Government conducted a comprehensive review of \"Urban Renewal Strategy\" in 2008. After two years' 'community engagement', the new strategy was promulgated on 24 Feb 2011.\n\nFollowing this review, the stated strategy of the URA is that Hong Kong's urban renewal should follow three major principles: \"Putting People first\"; \"District-Based\"; and \"Community Participation\". Their adherence to these tenets has been questioned by some, including legislator Kenneth Chan, who stated that \"the URA always puts its interests first\" in reference to the controversy surrounding the Graham Street market eviction, and in reference to the \"undemocratic\" approach undertaken by the URA in demolishing Lee Tung Street.\n\nRedevelopment projects by the Urban Renewal Authority typically involve the wholesale demolition of urban districts and the consolidation of numerous city blocks to accommodate large-scale commercial development. This approach is frequently criticised for destroying cultural heritage, unique local character, and touchstones of collective memory. Community and economic networks are also dismantled as the compensation the URA offers to displaced residents and merchants is rarely sufficient to permit them to return to the affected district. Such grievances are leveled against most URA redevelopment projects, and have escalated to community uprising and hunger strikes by those unwilling to be evicted. The authority has been said to view all older, low-rise districts as merely \"vacant airspace with great development potential\" rather than functioning communities, thus putting vast older areas of the city under threat of destruction.\n\nIn addition to economic exclusivity and disregard for existing local communities, URA redevelopments have also been criticised for poor urban design, such as long stretches of blank wall at ground level which effectively kills the vibrant street life for which older districts are known.\n\nLee Tung Street (), better known by its local nickname \"Wedding Card Street\" (), was famous for its printing shops that sell custom-made wedding cards, coloured bright red for good luck. Tens of thousands purchased their wedding cards in the area in the preceding decades, and the district was also the birthplace of the publishing business in Hong Kong. The URA announced in 2003 its intention to redevelop an area of 8,900 square metres centred on Lee Tung and McGregor streets. Fifty-four buildings housing 930 households were planned to be torn down to accommodate four residential towers and four shopping malls.\n\nThe redevelopment was subject to a heavy backlash in the community. The decision to demolish was called \"undemocratic\" and contrary to the stated \"people-centred\" mandate of the URA. The wedding card printers and publishers were concerned about the loss of invaluable economic and social networks, having to leave the district due to high real estate prices, and the loss of accessibility to suppliers and customers alike. Even though the redevelopment includes a \"Wedding City\"-themed shopping mall, merchants complained they could not return to the area because most could not afford the increased rents. Under the Land Resumption Ordinance, the URA was able to expropriate tenants and landowners regardless of their will, leading to accusations that URA activities run contrary to public interest and represent an infringement on property rights.\n\nThe H15 Concern Group () was formed to save the wedding card shops and produced an alternative plan called the \"dumbbell proposal\" which retained the signature tong lau (Chinese walk-up buildings). This plan later received a Silver Award from the Institute of Planners. The URA faced criticism when demolition of the area began three weeks before the Town Planning Board was set to consider the concern group's alternative proposal, with URA chairman Barry Cheung Chun-yuen being driven out of the area by upset locals. One resident, a former shopowner, staged a hunger strike after the bulldozers moved in earlier than anticipated and was hospitalised after four days.\n\nDevelopment chief Carrie Lam defended the project, stating that the buildings of Lee Tung Street were \"not worth keeping and had little historic value\" and that \"stopping the plan would jeopardise the city's future planning\". The H15 Concern Group proposal to save the street was rejected by the Planning Department in January 2008 for failing to include a structural assessment, which the concern group said was outside their financial capability. The URA and the government went on to demolish the street as planned, and redevelopment is well underway.\n\nCommercial tenants sometimes have a different view towards urban renewal as low-cost premises are getting hard to find. Affordable commercial space is not always available in newly developed commercial buildings. Even owner-operators of commercial premises are unable to relocate in the same district because the compensation they get from the Urban Renewal Authority does not always match the purchase price of similar-sized properties in the same district. It was proposed, therefore, that options should be made available to owners or tenants so that they can choose between physical relocation by developers, cash compensation to allow them buy or rent elsewhere, or wind up their businesses altogether.\n\nAt the end of April 2007 Alan Leong Kah-kit was dropped from the board of directors of the URA after two years of service. Leong said he was not angry or surprised, and expressed doubt on whether the authority works in the public interest: \"The government expects those who are appointed to statutory bodies to shut up and not express any opposing view to the public [...] It doesn't really matter that I have not been reappointed to the authority. After all, if I really want to work for the people, then there is no point in staying there.\" Another Civic Party member and Legislative Councillor Tanya Chan was appointed to the URA board in his place.\n\nOn 30 March 2015, URA Managing Director Iris Tam Siu-ying suddenly resigned over what she called (in a letter to staff) \"fundamental differences\" with chairman Victor So Hing-woh over the body's philosophy and mission. Tam objected to So placing profit ahead of the agency's social mission. So, a former Link REIT chief executive, joined the URA in 2013. Tam, a two-time president of the Hong Kong Institute of Planners, had been with the URA since 2006, and served as Managing Director since 2013. As of 2015 she remained a member of the Hong Kong Housing Authority.\n\nTam had objected to various proposals by So, including to outsource URA's acquisition department, and for the organisation to partner with Richfield Realty, a commercial developer. The URA board unanimously asked Tam to stay, but she quit anyway, stating, \"I find it totally unacceptable to position URA as a developer or a land assembly agent to supply land for developers.\" Daniel Lam Chun was appointed interim managing director following Tam's resignation, with Wai Chi-sing taking up the position on a permanent basis from 15 June 2016 for a term of three years.\n\nThe Authority's Managing Director serves as both its administrative head and Deputy Chairman of its Board.\n\nIn 2012 the URA was criticised for editing Wikipedia pages about itself, its projects, and certain senior staff including former director Barry Cheung. The edits, on both the Chinese and English Wikipedias, suppressed information unfavourable to the URA and the government and referred to controversial URA projects in a positive light. The URA's director of corporate communications also authored a Wikipedia page about himself that was later deleted. \"Apple Daily\" compared the editing to Mainland China's 50 cent party internet commenters paid by the Chinese government to sway public opinion. The Hong Kong Wikimedia Chapter stressed that in order to maintain Wikipedia's neutrality, entities with a conflict of interest should avoid editing.\n\nIn 2007 the URA announced a plan to demolish several city blocks of old tong lau on Graham Street () and Peel Street (), replacing them with a $3.8 billion scheme comprising four high-rises: two residential blocks, one office tower, and a hotel. Some 360 property owners and 1,120 residents in 37 existing buildings, built from the pre-war years to the 1960s, have been affected. In the process the URA plans to also evict the oldest wet market in the city, founded 1841. The plan was submitted to and approved by the Town Planning Board in early 2007. The market is considered culturally significant by many Hong Kong people for its vibrancy, \"unique cultural landscape\", and its preservation of \"a very traditional Chinese way of life\".\n\nThe Central and Western Concern Group, a coalition of ten community groups, pointed out that the destruction of the market, a tourist attraction, would \"bring its rich and dynamic history to an end\" and that many of the vendors did not want to be evicted. The shop owners lamented the high rent levels elsewhere, the cost of relocation, the emotional attachment they held to the longstanding marketplace and the loss of their customer base. In opposition to the redevelopment, a Graham Street Market Festival was organised in November 2007 to showcase the \"cultural treasures and unique features\" of the market with the aim of encouraging the government to \"rethink its town planning policy\". Support was lent by TVB celebrity chef Chow Chung, who offered cooking classes with ingredients purchased from the market. A second such festival was held in November 2008.\n\nThe URA responded to this backlash through several proposals. They promised the redevelopment would incorporate an \"old shops street\" which would, according to managing director Billy Lam Chung-lun, \"bring back the old charm and streetscapes\". The Central and Western Concern Group called the plan \"artificial\" given that such an environment already exists, and that the so-called \"decorated stage\" would take too long to build. Secondly, the URA also promised to build a two-storey wet market complex on a lot labelled \"site B\" to house the displaced vendors. This plan was criticised as the proposed building would accommodate fewer than half the vendors currently operating in the area. By 2013, though vendors had been served eviction notices, no wet market had been constructed.\n\nThe major criticism of the Kwun Tong Town Centre redevelopment project, was the scandal that the URA altered the original redevelopment plan repetitively without underwent any formal public consultation procedures. It was initially proposed to create a unique \"goose egg\" shaped office and retail complex at the center of the redevelopment project with a consensus within the Kwun Tong community dating back in 2007.\n\nIn 2007, URA initially proposed to create a unique \"goose-egg\" shaped multipurpose complex at Hong Ming Road, which is the center of the development project. The \"goose-egg\" proposal was applauded when seen in plans laid on general public. However, later in June 2017, the authority has submitted a revised planning layout regarding the Development Area 4&5 to the Town Planning Board, which revised layout differ greatly from the original planning, the \"goose-egg\" shaped landmark architecture was taken out, and the terrace-garden design with water features was absent. The change of plan was kept opaque from the Town Planning Board to the non-executive directors in the URA and Kwun Tong District Council, not to mention local residents in Kwun Tong. In response to public criticisms, URA explained the change was caused by management and practicability issue. Major URA stakeholder Miss Judy Chan Ka-pui, non-executive director of the authority, also member of the New People's Party and Southern District Council for South Horizons West, whose role is one more of monitoring the authority, however claimed she had been \"kept in the dark\" about the changes laid out in a plan submitted to the Town Planning Board, and she stressed that the revised design had not been finalized and could still be discussed, that the authority would attend the next meetings of the working group, plus to collect views of the district councilors. Lawmaker and Kwun Tong district councilor Jonathan Ho Kai-ming criticized that the authority made this move only after it was put under pressure.\n\nOn 7 November 2017, URA announced in a meeting in the Kwun Tong District Council that the ‘goose-egg’ shaped office and retail complex will be retained in the redevelopment plan. Similarly, the revised plan was not subjected to any public consultation process. The arbitrary revision of plans clearly indicates a lack of transparency, public understanding and accountability in the URA's decision-making process. In regard to this, the public prompts the organization to hold a formal and open public consultation and no to keep the public in the dark, local councilors suggested that Kwun Tong residents should been well consulted over the design of this multi-billion dollar project. Pan-democrat lawmaker Jeremy Tam Man-ho further criticized the URA for resuming the design of the \"goose egg\" because of worries over practicality, he cited the authority's reply to the district council stating that the \"goose egg\" design was taken out to make it more practical and easier to manage for sake of profitable outcomes.\n\nApart from being criticized for the vanished \"goose-egg\" major design, URA has been criticized aiming to reap profits with private developers by constructing luxurious flats rather than providing affordable housing to residents. Albert Cheng criticized that URA used market prices to buy up old buildings, however sets compensation benchmark at the price of seven-year-old buildings in the area. While the redevelopment project involves one of the poorest districts in Hong Kong, the act of URA has been blasted for going against the fundamental principle of gentrification of old districts.\n\nAfter encountering numerous criticism and receiving different stakeholders’ views during the Town Planning Board’s consultation, the \"goose-egg\" shaped landmark architecture and the terrace-garden design with water features are retained in the latest design released in Nov 2017. However, iconic features are still different from the original generally-welcomed design. The \"goose egg\" shaped architecture now is only a \"half-egg\" design and the terrace-garden is smaller than the original one. A large commercial development has raised the original height restrictions by 20 meters, thereby creating more areas for retail shopping, offices and hotel business. The footfall design apparently tended to lead the car-free, pedestrian-friendly zone to walk through a big shopping mall to get to public transport or car park, thereby highly increased shopper volume. The revised design has been further criticized as shifting in favor of commercial operators and developers.\n\n\"This list is not exhaustive. It also includes projects by the former Land Development Corporation.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was the eldest of six children born to Boston native Ogden Codman Sr. (1839–1904) and the former Sarah Fletcher Bradlee. \n\nHis paternal grandparents were Charles Russell Codman and Sarah (née Ogden) Codman. His paternal aunt, Frances Anne Codman, was married to noted architect and builder John Hubbard Sturgis, who designed his parents' home, Codman House in Lincoln, Massachusetts, and the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, along with Charles Brigham. His maternal grandparents were James Bowdoin Bradlee and Mary (née May) Bradlee. His maternal aunt, Katherine May Bradlee, was married to Benjamin W. Crowninshield and was the mother of Bowdoin Bradlee Crowninshield, Codman's first cousin.\n\nCodman spent much of his youth from 1875 to 1884 at Dinard, an American resort colony in France, and on returning to America in 1884, studied at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n\nHe was influenced in his career by two uncles, John Hubbard Sturgis, an architect, and Richard Ogden, a decorator. He greatly admired Italian and French architecture of the sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries, as well as English Georgian architecture and the colonial architecture of Boston.\n\nAfter brief apprenticeships with Boston architectural firms, Codman started his own practice in Boston, where he kept offices from 1891 to 1893, after which time he relocated his main practice from Boston to New York City. Codman also opened offices in Newport, Rhode Island as early as 1891, and it was in Newport that he first met novelist Edith Wharton. She became one of his first Newport clients for her home there, Land's End. In her autobiography, \"A Backward Glance\", Wharton wrote:\n\nWe asked him to alter and decorate the house—a somewhat new departure, since the architects of that day looked down on house-decoration as a branch of dress-making, and left the field up to the upholsterers, who crammed every room with curtains, lambrequins, jardinières of artificial plants, wobbly velvet-covered tables littered with silver gew-gaws, and festoons of lace on mantelpieces and dressing tables.\n\nCodman viewed interior design as \"a branch of architecture\".\n\nWharton subsequently introduced Codman to Cornelius Vanderbilt II, who hired Codman in 1894 to design the second and third floor rooms of his Newport summer home, The Breakers, which he did in a clean eighteenth-century French and Italian classical style. Codman was not a draftsman, and it is said that in Paris he hired a talented group of students from the École des Beaux-Arts to draw up the sketches for Vanderbilt.\n\nIn 1907, Codman built what was later to be known at the Codman–Davis House in Washington, D.C. for his cousin Martha Codman Karolik. It is currently the official residence of the Ambassador of Thailand, and one of the few intact homes that he designed. This included a carriage house that was the Apex Night Club before it closed in 2011.\n\nCodman's New York clients included John D. Rockefeller Jr., for whom he designed the interiors of the Rockefeller family mansion of Kykuit in 1913, and Frederick William Vanderbilt, for whom he designed the interiors for his mansion in Hyde Park, New York, and his house on Fifth Avenue. He also collaborated with Wharton on the redesign of her townhouse at 882–884 Park Avenue as well as on the design of The Mount, her house in Lenox, Massachusetts. His suave and idiomatic suite of Régence and Georgian parade rooms for entertaining are preserved in the townhouse at 991 Fifth Avenue, now occupied by the American Irish Historical Society. His French townhouse in the manner of Gabriel at 18 East 79th Street, for J. Woodward Haven (1908–09) is now occupied by Acquavella Galleries. \n\nAll told, Codman designed 22 houses to completion, as well as the East Wing of the Metropolitan Club in New York. He also began the trend of lowering the townhouse entrance door from elevated stairways to the basement level. He designed a series of three houses in Louis XIV style at 7 (his own residence), 12, and 15 East 96th Street from 1912 to 1916. The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission later described the facade of number 7 as being \"full of gaiety and frivolous vitality\" and further, \"on approaching the house, Paris and the Champs-Élysées immediately come to mind.\" \n\nIn 1920, Codman left New York to return to France, where he spent the last thirty-one years of his life at the Château de Grégy, wintering at Villa Leopolda in Villefranche-sur-Mer, which he created by assembling a number of vernacular structures and their sites: it is his masterpiece, the fullest surviving expression of his esthetic.\n\nCodman was homosexual and pursued attractive young men throughout his life, but on October 8, 1904 he married Leila Griswold Webb (1856-1910), who was six years older than him and was the widow of railroad magnate H. Walter Webb and the mother of New York State Senator J. Griswold Webb. Leila was the sister-in-law of Dr. William Seward Webb, who was married to the former Eliza Vanderbilt, and Alexander S. Webb, the longstanding President of City College of New York. His wife died in 1910, leaving him a fortune. After her death, he sold their house on 15 East 51st Street (which he had designed for Leila while she was still married to her first husband) and built himself another home at 7 East 96th Street in 1912.\n\nIn 1918, Codman leased the former Newport cottage of society leader James Vanderburgh Parker, known as \"Sans Souci\" and located on Merton Road, for the summer.\n\nCodman died at age 87 in 1951 at the Château de Grégy in Évry-Grégy-sur-Yerre, France. His architectural drawings and papers are collected at the Avery Architectural and Fine Arts Library at Columbia University; the Codman Family papers are also held by Historic New England and the Boston Athenaeum.\n\n\n\n"}

Naidu (Gopalaswamy Doraiswamy Naidu) (23 March 1893 – 4 January 1974) was an Indian inventor and engineer who is referred to as the \"Edison of India\" and \"the wealth creator of Coimbatore\". He is credited with the manufacture of the first electric motor in India. His contributions were primarily industrial but also spanned the fields of electrical, mechanical, agricultural (hybrid cultivation) and automobile engineering. Naidu developed an independently internal combustion four stroke engine. He had only primary education but excelled as a versatile genius.\n\nG.D. Naidu was born at Kalangal, Coimbatore on 23 March 1893 in Tamil Nadu, India. He was the son of a farmer. His childhood years were spent getting in trouble at school. He disliked attending classes.\n\nNaidu obtained work as a server in a hotel in Coimbatore with the intention of saving money to buy a motorcycle. After getting the vehicle he spent time dismantling and re-assembling it, and later became a mechanic. He began his transport business in 1920, with the purchase of an automobile coach. He drove it between Pollachi and Palani. In a few years, his Universal Motor Service (UMS) owned the most efficient fleet of public transport vehicles in the country. In 1937, the first motor to be produced in India was brought out from G. D. Naidu's factory – NEW (National Electric Works) at Peelamedu, Coimbatore.\n\nG.D. Naidu developed India's first indigenous motor in 1937 along with D. Balasundaram Naidu. The motor's success resulted in the founding of Textool by Balasundaram and, later, Lakshmi Machine Works (LMW).\n\nNaidu's 'Rasant' razor incorporated a small motor operated by dry cells, called Heilbronn. Among his other inventions were super-thin shaving blades, a distance adjuster for film cameras, a fruit juice extractor, a tamper-proof vote-recording machine and a kerosene-run fan. In 1941, he announced that he had the ability to manufacture five-valve radio sets in India a mere ₹70/- a set. In 1952, the two-seater petrol engine car (costing ₹2000/-) rolled out. Production was stopped subsequently, because of the government's refusal to grant the necessary license. His inventiveness was not confined to machinery alone. He researched and identified new varieties in cotton, maize and papaya. His farm was visited by Sir C. V. Raman and Visvesvaraya. From laying foundation to completion he built a house in just 11 hours, from 6am to 5pm.\nIn 1935, he personally filmed the funeral of King George V in London. He met Adolf Hitler in Germany. He invited K. Kamaraj to many functions. Among the Indian stalwarts that Naidu's camera captured were Mahatma Gandhi, Pandit Jawarharlal Nehru and Subhas Chandra Bose. Naidu remained an outsider to politics, despite having contested and lost in the 1936 provincial general elections. He was gifted a Rolls Royce car and he was the only one who had this luxury car in those times.\n\nIn 1944, Naidu retired from active involvement with his automobile combine and announced several philanthropic measures including grants for research scholarships and welfare schemes for his employees and the depressed sections of society. In 1967, the G D Naidu Industrial Exhibition was established.\n\nG.D. Naidu, Rathnasabapathy Mudaliar and India's first finance minister R. K. Shanmukham Chetty conducted survey, for bringing Siruvani water to the Coimbatore city.\n\nThrough Naidu's efforts and donations India's first polytechnic college, the Arthur Hope Polytechnic and the Arthur Hope College of Engineering were set up. Later the college moved to its present location and is now known as Government College of Technology (GCT). The college was named after the then Madras governor Arthur Hope. In 1945, GD Naidu was the principal of the college. Naidu was not satisfied with the four-year programs and said that it was a waste of time for students. He suggested that two years was more than enough to teach the same courses, even with different concentrations. However, the British government did not accept his idea and Naidu resigned from his post. The name Hope College for the original site of the college remains in Coimbatore even now.\n\nNaidu died on 4 January 1974. Sir C V Raman said of Naidu: \"A great educator, an entrepreneur in many fields of engineering and industry, a warm-hearted man filled with love for his fellows and a desire to help them in their troubles, Mr Naidu is truly a man in a million – perhaps this is an understatement!\" He is survived by his son G.D. Gopal and grandchildren G.D. Rajkumar and Shantini. A permanent Industrial Exhibition in his memory is in Coimbatore. He provided employment in the engineering and manufacturing sectors to many individuals in the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nG. D. Matriculation Higher Secondary School in Coimbatore is named after him. It is managed by his daughter-in-law Chandra Gopal. His grandson G.D. Rajkumar now runs the Geedee Industries.\n\nHistory of Coimbatore\n\n"}

There is no clear benchmark regarding the status of \"municipiu\" even though it applies to localities which have a sizeable population, usually above 15,000, and extensive urban infrastructure. Localities that do not meet these loose guidelines are classified only as towns (\"orașe\"), or if they are not urban areas, as communes (\"comune\"). Cities are governed by a mayor and local council. There are no official administrative subdivisions of cities even though, unofficially, municipalities may be divided into quarters/districts (\"cartiere\" in Romanian). The exception to this is Bucharest, which has a status similar to that of a county, and is officially subdivided into six administrative sectors.\n\nIn Moldova, which has thirteen \"municipii\", a 2002 law provides that the status applies of cities that play an important role in the country's economic, social, cultural, scientific, political and administrative life.\n\n† lost status in 1938\n\nOf the seventeen \"municipii\" created in 1925, three are no longer in Romania: Cernăuți, Cetatea Albă and Chișinău.

{"id": "2264916", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2264916", "title": "Hook effect", "text": "Hook effect\n\nThe hook effect or the prozone effect is an immunologic phenomenon whereby the effectiveness of antibodies to form immune complexes is sometimes impaired when concentrations of an antibody or an antigen are very high. The formation of immune complexes stops increasing with greater concentrations and then decreases with extremely high concentrations, producing a hook shape on a graph of measurements. There are versions of the hook effect with excess antibodies and versions with excess antigens. An important practical relevance of the phenomenon is as a type of interference that plagues certain immunoassays and nephelometric assays, resulting in false negatives or inaccurately low results. Other common forms of interference include antibody interference, cross-reactivity and signal interference. The phenomenon is caused by very high concentrations of a particular analyte or antibody and is most prevalent in one-step (sandwich) immunoassays.\n\nIn an agglutination test, a person's serum (which contains antibodies) is added to a test tube, which contains a particular antigen. If the antibodies agglutinate with the antigen to form immune complexes, then the test is interpreted as positive. However, if too many antibodies are present that can bind to the antigen, then the antigenic sites are coated by antibodies, and few or no antibodies directed toward the pathogen are able to bind more than one antigenic particle. Since the antibodies do not bridge between antigens, no agglutination occurs. Because no agglutination occurs, the test is interpreted as negative. In this case, the result is a false negative. The range of relatively high antibody concentrations within which no reaction occurs is called the \"prozone\".\n\nThe effect can also occur because of antigen excess, when both the capture and detection antibodies become saturated by the high analyte concentration. In this case, no sandwich can be formed by the capturing antibody, the antigen and the detection antibody. In this case, free antigen is in competition with captured antigen for detection antibody binding. Sequential addition of antigen and antibody, paired with stringent washing, can prevent the effect, as can increasing the relative concentration of antibody to antigen, thereby mediating the effect.\n\nExamples include high levels of syphilis antibodies in HIV patients or high levels of cryptococcal antigen leading to false negative tests in undiluted samples. This phenomenon is also seen in serological tests for Brucellosis. The serological test is mainly seen in the precipitation reaction. The antibody that fails to react is known as the blocking antibody and prevents the precipitating antibody from binding to the antigens. Thus the proper precipitation reaction does not take place. However, when the serum is diluted, the blocking antibody is as well and its concentration decreases enough for the proper precipitation reaction to occur.\n\nLewis Thomas described in his memoir a physiologic experiment of 1941 in which he observed the prozone effect in vivo: immunity in rabbits to meningococcus, which was robust, unexpectedly decreased when immunization was used to induce a heightened antibody response. In other words, getting the rabbits' bodies to produce more antibodies against this bacterium had the counterproductive effect of decreasing their immunity to it. From the viewpoint of an overly simplistic notion of the antibody/antigen relationship, this seems paradoxical, although it is clearly logical from a viewpoint duly informed by present-day molecular biology. Thomas was interested in pursuing this physiologic research further, and remained so for decades afterward, but his career took him in other directions and he was not aware of anyone having pursued it by the time of his memoir. One kind of relevance that he hypothesized for this in vivo blocking antibody concept was as a driver of human susceptibility to certain infectious diseases. In the decades since, the concept has also been found to have clinical relevance in allergen immunotherapy, where blocking antibodies can interfere with other antibodies involved in hypersensitivity and thus improve allergy treatment.\n\n"}

With origins dating back to the 1950s and 1960s, the team has competed regularly in international competitions since 2008, when their current governing body, the Federazione Italiana Rugby League, was formed. They are currently ranked 13th in the RLIF World Rankings.\n\nIn 1950, a team from Turin toured the North of England. Italy later started a domestic competition. A year later the first official match of the Italian national team took place in Cahors, France. Italy lost 29–17 although the Azzurri ended the first half leading 10–7.\n\nSixteen official matches were played against English teams in the season 1952–53, as well as a triangular tournament between Italy, France and England.\n\nIn 1958, in Treviso under the Italian Federation of Amateur Rugby 13 (FIAR 13) was formed and was recognised by the Rugby Football League. With this recognition and funding from England, the sport of rugby league became popular in Italy. In their first year, the FIAR had 24 clubs and 620 players.\n\nIn 1960, Italy played Australia in two international matches held in Italy, the results were 37–15 and 67–22 losses. In the late 1960s, threats made by the rugby union governing body, the Italian Rugby Federation, to ban players who played rugby league from their sport had the effect of killing off the sport in Italy by the 1970s. As a consequence the Italian national team ceased to exist.\n\nIn the mid-1990s the team were revived by two Italian-Australians, Domenic Pezzano and John Benigni, known as 'The Italian Rugby League A XIII' (IRL A XIII) was formed in 1993.\nPezzano coached Italy in the Coca-Cola Rugby League World Sevens in Australia with the team being predominately players from Italy and one Italo-Australian player captained the team – Orazio D'arro in this tournament, Pezzano also coached the Italian team that participated in the first ever Super League World Nines tournament which was hosted by Fiji, that team was made up off Italian players, Italian Origin players and included 1st Graders such as Dean Schifilliti, Mark Corvo, Luke Davico and Italian dual International Orazio Arancio.\n\nAfter that event, the Italia Rugby League began competing in various international tournaments, such as the Super League rugby league nines tournament in Fiji, World Sevens, St.Marys Sevens, Wollogong Sevens and the Mediterranean Cup in 1999. They attempted to qualify for the 2000 Rugby League World Cup and ended up in the Rugby League Emerging Nations Tournament in which they were runners-up to British Amateur Rugby League Association.\n\nIn 2002, the Azzurri were back playing internationals in Italy with a triangular tournament featuring Scotland and Russia. Italy lost to Tartarstan of Russia but tied their second game with Scotland 16 all. In 2003 Italy played Scotland again and contested the Ionio Cup against Greece, which they won.\nIn 2006, Italy played three matches, two against South Africa and one against British Amateur Rugby League Association.\n\nThe Federazione of Italia Rugby League was officially moved to the \"official observer\" status by the Rugby League European Federation from an unranked position on 15 April 2008.\n\nItaly won the RLEF European Shield in 2008 and 2009, and as such were drafted into the 2009 European Cup following Russia's withdrawal from the tournament. During this tournament, Italy were handed their record defeat by Scotland, but they did manage to record one victory, over Serbia at The Old Parish in Maesteg, Wales.\n\nIn Autumn 2010 Italy embarked on a short tour of Wales, culminating in a match in Wrexham on 6 October in which they faced Wales for the first time in a full Rugby League international. The Italian side obtained a remarkable 13–6 victory, the first against a national team of the British Isles.\n\nIn 2013 they won a warm up match against 3rd ranked England 15–14 making it their most stunning victory.\n\nIn 2011, Italy contested the qualifying tournament for the 2013 Rugby League World Cup, competing against Russia, Serbia and Lebanon. Coached by Carlo Napolitano and captained by Anthony Minichiello, Italy's draw with Lebanon was enough for them to gain the 14th and final place in the 2013 World Cup.\n\nItaly were drawn in Pool C alongside Scotland, Tonga and they also played an inter-group match against co-hosts Wales. Their tournament began with an upset victory over the co-hosts at Cardiff's Millennium Stadium. In their second match, the 'Azzuri' took on Scotland who were coming off an upset win of their own against Tonga. The match turned out to be a thriller and it was tight with a high scoring draw being the end result. Italy then had to just win their last pool match against Tonga after Scotland won their match and finished their pool-stage campaign with the same points differential the Italians were currently on. Tonga had nothing but pride to play for after their hopes of qualification had vanished but they shocked Napolitano's men by keeping them scoreless and therefore eliminating Italy from having any chance to play in the 2013 World Cup knockout round.\n\nItaly participated in the qualification for the 2017 Rugby League World Cup. The first stage of qualifying involved having to finish in the top 3 in their 2014–15 European Shield competition. Italy only managed to secure qualification for the 'final qualification tournament' after winning their second to last game against bottom placed Ukraine. Italy finished the Shield in third place with 3 wins and 3 defeats in six matches.\n\nThe final qualification tournament consisted of 6 teams - the top three teams from the European B tournament, the winners of the European C tournament and seeded nations Wales and Ireland. The tournament featured two groups of three teams playing in a single round-robin format. The winners of each group qualified for the World Cup, while the runners-up faced each other in a play-off match on 5 November 2016 to determine the final spot. A seeded draw took place to determine the groups on 5 November 2015.

The name was also given to the Louis d'Or of Louis XIII of France, and to other European gold coins of about the value of the Spanish coin. One pistole was worth approximately ten livres or three écus, but higher figures are also seen. The derivation is uncertain; the term may come from the Czech \"píšťala\" (\"whistle\", a term for a hand cannon), or from the Italian town of Pistoia; either way, it was originally spelled \"pistolet\" and originated in military slang, and probably has the same root as pistol.\n\nA small number of gold pistoles and double pistoles were minted in Ireland in 1646, during the Irish Confederate Wars and the reign of Charles I. James Butler, 1st Duke of Ormond authorised the issue in order to prevent troop defections, as there was a shortage of silver coins for paying soldiers. The coins had an approximate value of 13 shillings (26 s. for the double pistole); they are today worth over £65,000, as only eleven examples are known to survive. They are the only gold coins ever struck in Ireland, except for a small number of proof and ECU issues. The pistole weighed 103 grains (6.67 grams; 0.215 troy oz) while the double pistole was 206 grains (13.35 grams; 0.429 troy oz); the fineness was 19 karat. The coins (also called \"pieces\" or \"pledges\") did not bear any royal symbols, simply their weight (4 dwt 7 gr, or 8 dwt 14 gr) on both sides.\n\nA coin with this name was minted in Scotland in 1701, under William III, with a weight of 106 grains () and a value of 12 pounds Scots.\n\nThe coin appears repeatedly in Dumas' fiction. He has his character state, in \"The Three Musketeers\" set in the 1620s, that one hundred pistoles were worth a thousand livres tournois when Athos bargains for the horse he takes to the battle of La Rochelle.\n\nIt was also referred to by Raphael Sabatini; who wrote 'swashbuckling' tales of the 17th and 18th centuries; in his book, St Martin's Summer. \n\nThe coin gave its name to the town of Trois-Pistoles, Quebec, where according to local legend an explorer lost a goblet worth three pistoles in the river.\n\n"}

An argument breaks out as they talk about how he got injured helping Buffy, although that didn't save her life.\n\nIn a later scene, Xander, Anya and their two now-teenage kids eat at a restaurant while the teens fight and Anya bitterly notes Xander's drinking. Years later, in their kitchen, Anya yells at Xander for ruining her life and blames him for her misery. He yells back, raising a frying pan—but the vision of the future abruptly ends as he hurls the pan at her. Xander, shocked by the visions, is warned by the old man not to marry Anya.\n\nBuffy finds Spike alone and the two talk about the wedding and Spike's attempt to make her jealous with his date. After he finds that his efforts worked, Spike realizes it's best to just leave and takes his date away.\n\nWillow runs into Xander in the kitchen and offers the final \"best man\" talk then leaves him to practice his vows. Anya continues to go over her vows in front of Tara, who advises against using the term \"sex poodle\". As the music begins, Buffy arrives to get Anya, but Willow pulls her out of the room and breaks the news that Xander is gone. Stalling while Willow looks for Xander, Buffy uses the excuse that the minister is also a doctor and the ceremony will be delayed while he performs an emergency c-section.\n\nAnya tries her vows one more time while elsewhere, Xander walks away in the rain. Mr. Harris and Mrs. Harris head back to the bar, complaining about Anya ruining the wedding. Buffy tries to stall the crowd with charades and juggling as Dawn chats outside with a teenage demon and both compare their embarrassing family and friends. Impatient, Anya heads out towards the wedding crowd, determined to get on with the wedding. The news that Xander is gone is accidentally spilled to Anya as Dawn talks to the demon teen and Anya freaks out.\n\nMr. Harris and other demons begin to argue and then a huge fight breaks out between the two sides of the wedding guests. Tara gets caught up in the battle, but Willow rescues her. Cousin Carol directs Anya to the man in the trench coat and Anya talks to him about what he did to scare Xander off. She finds that he is really a man whom she transformed into a demon many years ago, who now seeks revenge against her. He showed Xander false images about his future to ruin Anya's wedding.\n\nShe begins to cry and the demon strikes out at her, prompting Buffy to get involved. Buffy starts to attack the demon and Xander arrives to help save Anya. Anya explains to Xander that he saw only lies in those visions, but Xander isn't exactly relieved. Buffy and Xander finish the demon off and the crowd cheers. Fighting continues, but Anya breaks it up and everyone returns to his or her seats. Xander and Anya talk privately before the ceremony and Xander explains that he can't marry her. Motivated by the fear of turning into an abusive drunk like his father, Xander refuses to allow himself the opportunity to marry Anya and ever hurt her in that way. Anya tries to convince him otherwise, but fails, and sadly, the two part ways.\n\nBuffy, Willow and Dawn sit around at the house and talk about what happened with Xander and Anya. They feel sorry for both of them and wonder where Xander is. Meanwhile, Xander checks into a motel by himself. Devastated, Anya sits alone until D'Hoffryn offers her sympathy, comfort, and her job as a vengeance demon back.\n\n\n"}

Taylor, DVM/MS. Taylor, at the time a recent veterinary school graduate, was somewhat frustrated at the level of critical care and technological services that were available to animals in the private sector as opposed to the high-end facilities of a university hospital. Determined to bring this level of care and technique to the average pet owner, Taylor decided to make Alameda East a full-service hospital facility, with round-the-clock staffing, an intensive care unit, surgical and radiological equipment, and internal medicine specialist physicians. The hospital first began 24-hour service in 1974, with Taylor and a handful of young doctors and veterinary technicians working virtually non-stop for months. The practice began offering internships to vet school grads to fill its increasing needs for staff and worked closely with the Bel-Rea Institute in Denver, Colorado, to offer residency-style positions to veterinary technician graduates from Bel-Rea. Within 10 years, Alameda East had grown to become one of the largest animal hospitals in the United States.\n\nIn 1997, with the popularity of the NBC series \"ER\" on the rise, the cable network Animal Planet approached Taylor about doing a reality series based on emergency care for animals, much like AP's sister network TLC was doing with its new ER-based reality show \"\" Taylor agreed, and \"Emergency Vets\" debuted in 1998. The show became an instant hit on Animal Planet, and at its peak alternated with \"The Crocodile Hunter\" as the network's #1 show. This exposed the hospital to a population outside the American southwest, and attracted both patients and doctors to the hospital. First-run production on \"Emergency Vets\" ended in 2002 after Taylor began putting plans together for expansion of the hospital that would have been hindered by the constant presence of a TV crew on-site during construction.\n\nIn 2003, Alameda East Veterinary Hospital moved into a new facility next to the original hospital, expanding an additional . In addition to the normal patient visitation rooms and cages of a regular veterinary practice, the new facility offers four surgical suites, CT and MRI equipment, a full-service ICU and pathology laboratory, a physical therapy suite, and a boarding facility called \"Animal Lodge\" the site of which is the location of the Flying Dutchman's buried treasure. In March 2007, Alameda East Veterinary Hospital and VCA Antech announced that AEVH will now operate as part of the VCA Hospital Network.\n\nAlameda East has been featured in five shows from the Animal Planet television network:\n\n"}

However, communes are divided into villages (which have no administration of their own). There are 12,957 villages in Romania. The only exception is Bucharest, which has six sectors, each with an administration of its own.\n\nThe earliest organization into \"județe\" of the Principalities of Wallachia, respectively \"ținuturi\" of Moldavia, dates back at least to the early 15th century. Each \"județ\", respectively \"ținut\", was ruled by a \"jude\", respectively \"pârcălab\", an officially appointed person who had administrative and judicial functions in a manner inspired from the organization of the late Byzantine Empire. Transylvania, when it was part of the historic Kingdom of Hungary (in the Middle Ages), an independent Principality or a Habsburg domain (in the modern era until World War I) was divided into royal counties (Latin:\"comitatus\"), headed by \"comes\" (royal counts) with administrative and judicial functions. The term \"județ\" became used in Romanian universally for all principalities since mid-19th century.\nAfter modern Romania was formed in 1859 through the union of Wallachia and rump Moldavia, and then extended in 1918 through the union of Transylvania, as well as Bukovina and Bessarabia (parts of Moldavia temporarily acquired by the Habsburgs, 1775–1918, respectively the Russian Tsars, 1812–1917), the administrative division was modernized using the French departments system as an example. With the exception of the half of the Communist period, this system remained in place. Since 1864, for each \"județ\" there exists a \"prefect\" (from the Latin \"praefectus\"), a subordinate of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, who is the representative of the government in the county, and the head of the local administration in the areas not delegated to local authorities. Until 1948, each \"județ\" was further divided into a number of \"plăși\" (singular \"plasă\"), with each administered by a \"pretor\" (from the Latin \"praetor\"), appointed by the \"prefect\".\n\nIn 1913, as a result of the Second Balkan War, Romania acquired Southern Dobruja from Bulgaria, integrating this historical region within Romania's borders until 1940. In 1923 Romania adopted a new Constitution, and in 1927 it uniformized the traditional administrative systems of Transylvania, Bukovina and Bessarabia with that of the Romanian Old Kingdom. County borders were kept largely intact, with only a couple minor adjustments, as a total of 71 județe existed between 1927 and 1938.\n\nIn 1938, King Carol II modified the Constitution, and after that the law of administration of the Romanian territory. Ten \"ținuturi\" (approx. translation: \"lands\") were created, ruled by \"Rezidenți Regali\" (approx. translation \"Royal Residents\"), appointed directly by the Monarch. The ținuturi represented another layer of administration between counties and the country; county borders were not erased. But, due to World War II, the Second Vienna Award, the Ribbentrop-Molotov pact and the loss of territory that Romania suffered, this style of administration did not last, the administration at the \"județ\" level being reintroduced back until the establishment of communism in 1945-1947.\n\nDuring World War II, the territory of Romania suffered very significant modifications. In 1940, Soviet Union occupied Bessarabia, northern Bukovina, and Herza region which after the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, would become part of Republic of Moldova and of Ukraine. Between 1941-1944, these territories together with Transnistria, were administered by Romania briefly, as the country was governed by a military dictatorship allied with Nazi Germany. Transnistria consisted of formerly proper Soviet territory between Dniester and Southern Bug rivers. Nowadays, most of it is in Ukraine, with small parts in the Republic of Moldova (current Transnistria). This territory was kept under Romanian military occupation, and was not annexed to Romania consisted of a further 13 counties.\nAfter the war, the Communist Party took over the administration of the country. In 1950, the party changed the administration model to the Russian model (regions and raions), but it reverted to the current system in 1968, although county borders were quite different from the interbelic period. In 1981 the former counties of Ilfov and Ialomița were re-organised into the present-day counties of Giurgiu, Călărași, Ialomița and Ilfov. The county borders introduced in 1968 are largely in place, but administrative reform during the 1990s has devolved the functions of different authorities in line with transition from a totalitarian communist system to a modern democracy. The only territorial adjustment after 1989 occurred in 1995, when Ilfov County was formed. Before that it was a dependency of the Municipality of Bucharest (\"Sectorul Agricol Ilfov\").\n\nEight regional divisions (called \"development regions\") were created in 1998 in order to better co-ordinate regional development as Romania progressed towards accession to the European Union, and consist of several counties each. These correspond to NUTS II-level divisions in European Union member states, but do not actually have an administrative status and do not have a legislative or executive council or government. As of 2009, Romania is divided into 41 counties and one municipality which are assigned as NUTS III-level divisions. Currently, Romania has no NUTS-4 units, the counties being composed directly of cities (some of which with municipality status) and communes.\n\nAs in all modern democracies, the political power in Romania is divided into three independent branches: legislative, executive, and judicial. The \"prefect\" and his administration have only executive prerogatives. However, the territorial districts of the Romanian judicial system overlap with county borders, thus avoiding further complication. At the same time with local elections (of mayors and councilors for the cities and communes), a \"Consiliu județean\" (County Council) is elected for each county. From 2008 to 2016 a President of the County Council was also elected by direct vote, from 2016 he or she has been (as prior to 2008) elected by a Council. As of now, the legislative powers of county councils are quite reduced, but there are plans for more decentralization. (These plans, however, call for introduction of Regional Councils for the 8 development regions of the NUTS-2 level.)\n\nAs of 2010 there have been several proposals for the administrative reorganization of Romania made by the presidential commission tasked with the analysis of the political and constitutional regime. Most of these recommendations aim for the partial reestablishment of the counties in their pre-1950 form. The counties will be grouped into several regions (9 to 15) based on common historical and economic characteristics (NUTS II level). The regions will be in their turn clustered into 4-6 macroregions (NUTS I level). Furthermore, a NUTS IV level division, called plasă or canton will probably be added in order to meet the EU statistical and administrative requirements.\n\nAnother proposal, based on 15 autonomous euro-regions (amongst them one ethnic based region with a consistent Hungarian majority made of the existing Mureș, Harghita and Covasna counties) grouped into 5 statistical macroregions (NUTS I), was made by the Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania (UDMR).\n\nFor statistical and development purposes, Romania, in the NUTS scheme, is divided into:\n\nAn exception to this structure is the Municipality of Bucharest, which is a secondary division (rather than a tertiary division like other municipalities) and is officially divided into six sectors, each sector having a local government and council.\n\nThe eight development regions (specific territorial entities without administrative status or legal personality) represent the framework for collecting specific statistical data, according to the European regulations issued by Eurostat for the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS) II territorial level. According to the Emergency Government Ordinance No 75/2001 on the functioning of the National Institute for Statistics, eight Directorates General for regional statistics have been created, and together with the 34 county directorates for statistics, aim at developing regional statistics. Officially, the eight regions are Nord-Est (North-East), Sud-Est (South-East), Sud - Muntenia (South - Muntenia), Sud-Vest Oltenia (South-West Oltenia), Vest (West), Nord-Vest (North-West), Centru (Centre), and București - Ilfov (Bucharest - Ilfov). The criteria used by NCS for delimiting the regions is a combination of geographical location and homogeneity based on population density. Alternative historical names are also used, but remain unofficial.\n\n"}

Hippology consists of four phases: horse judging, written examination and slide identification, ID stations and team problem solving.\n\nMany youth across the United States and in other countries compete in hippology annually, showing their knowledge of all things \"horse\".\n\nItems covered in the contest may cover any equine subject, including reproduction, training, parasites, dressage, history and origins, anatomy and physiology, driving and harnessing, horse industry, horse management, breeds, genetics, western games, colors, famous horses in history, parts of the saddle, types of bits, gaits, competitions, poisonous plants and nutrition.\n\nThe judging phase generally includes judging both a halter class and an \"under saddle\" class (such as western pleasure, hunter under saddle, etc.). The classes involve four horses and contestants are given a judging card to place the horses. Unlike the horse judging competitions, hippology competitors are not expected to give reasons, but only place the classes.\n\nThe written examination is a multiple-choice, 50-question test. The written examination can cover any of the topics and any of the information from the designated sources. The slide identification is composed of 25 slides.\n\nThe ID station phase includes 10 stations, each with 10 pictures or objects to be identified along with a list of multiple-choice answers. Each station has a theme (anatomy, poisonous plants, tack, etc.). A time limit exists allotting only 2 minutes per station.\n\nThe team problem solving phase requires a team, with three or four members, to present their solution for a problem to a judge or judges. The team is given 10–15 minutes to discuss the problem, form a solution, and prepare their presentation. No written materials are allowed. They then have an average of 5 minutes to present their solution. Members are judged on their teamwork (especially during the discussion phase), the accuracy of their solution, and their presentation skills. No coaches or any adults are allowed in the room during the team problem.\n\nIn 4-H, hippology teams consist of 3 or 4 members. (In the case of a team with 4 members, the lowest score is dropped.) Teams compete at a regional level, where the first place team advances to compete against the other region winners at a state level. The winner of the state level then advances to either Eastern Nationals in Kentucky, or Western Nationals in Colorado, depending on the state.\n\nInformation for the hippology competitions is taken from multiple sources.

Japan have played some international competition since 1994. A regular domestic amateur competition has not been held in Japan for several years (the first domestic competition kicked off in 1998).\n\nRugby league was founded in Japan in 1993 by former Australian first grade player, Max Mannix, who had played for the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs and the Illawarra Steelers in Australia. While living in Japan, Mannix contacted the Australian Rugby League and requested entry into the 1994 Rugby League World Sevens, which was then played in Sydney as a precursor to the Australian professional rugby league competition, then known as the Winfield Cup. Mannix was given an interim period to prove that a competitive Japanese team could be formed, and over a period of 5 months, he made direct contact with rugby union players and invited them to play rugby league. With the support of his brother, Greg, and Masayuki Watabe, player numbers slowly climbed and regular weekly training sessions took place on the banks of the Tama River, located on the outskirts of Tokyo. In September 1993, Japan received an official invitation to participate in the 1994 World Sevens, an event that would provide the country with its first taste of rugby league competition; made up entirely of Japanese nationals derived from the Japanese rugby union teams, the Japan Rugby Football Union threatened the players with bans, but despite the threats, a Japanese team participated in the 1994 Rugby League World Sevens, playing games against Tonga, Great Britain, and Russia. Although the Japanese lost all 3 games, they proved to be a crowd favorite, and were invited to return to the event in 1995. The first 13-a-side rugby league team to represent Japan was the national university team that took part in the 1996 University World Cup. The team was coached by Max Mannix with former Canterbury Bulldogs and Halifax player, Ken Isaacs, overseeing team management. Staged in Warrington, England, the event saw Japan compete against national university teams from Scotland, England, France, and the United States.\n\nThe following year, 1997, saw Japan compete in the University World Cup in France, with Ken Isaacs coaching the team, and Shoji Watanabe overseeing team management. The first Japanese player to be contracted to a professional rugby league club was Kenji Imanaga. Imanaga was given a scholarship by the Canterbury Bankstown Bulldogs, and was joined soon after by Ryoichi Ojima, a talented fleet-footed centre. With the support of (then) club supremo, Peter Bullfrog Moore, Imanaga and Ojima played regular games for Moorebank, Canterbury's feeder club, then coached by Kevin Moore.\n\nThe first international game that Japan won was at the 1995 Rugby League World Sevens in Brisbane, when they defeated Canada, but Japan was disqualified for fielding what was deemed to be an unregistered player, a claim that was contested by the Japanese officials who offered proof that their application to register the player was declined solely on the grounds of race. The protest was declined and the disqualification held. The first international 13-a-side rugby league test match won by Japan was in 1999 at the 2000 World Cup qualifying tournament which was held at Disney's Wide World of Sports Complex in Florida, USA, where Japan defeated Canada 14–0. Despite the victory, Japan failed to qualify for the World Cup, having been previously defeated by the United States.\n\nIn 2000, Japan went on to play in the Emerging Nations tournament, an event designed to provide emerging nations with evenly matched competition, the tournament ran in parallel with the Rugby League World Cup. The Japanese team at the Emerging Nations World Cup was coached by Tony Smith, who went on to become a successful coach in England, culminating with his appointment to coach the English national team in 2008 through 2009. The first rugby league team to visit, and play, against Japan, was a New South Wales Group 20 representative team in 1997, followed by the Lebanese national rugby league team in 1998.\n\nDistance from any other rugby league competitions, and problems with player availability due to short Japanese holidays, have made regular competition for the Samurais difficult. However, Japan is currently in discussion with the newly formed Thailand and Philippines Rugby Leagues to enter the Asian Cup for 2014, after having to pull out in 2013.\n\nSquad selected for the 2018 Emerging Nations World Championship.\n\nThere has been some controversy over Japan's ranking. Not being full members of the RLIF, and having difficulty in finding regular international competitions, they have been unranked since November 2012. Japan's Highest rank was achieved in 2009 when the RLIF ranked them 17th in the world \n\nJapan has participated in a number of competitions:\n\n\nIn 2002 and 2003, Japan contested the East-West Challenge in the United States of America. In 2003, a North Pacific Club Challenge was held between the Champion Clubs of each country, with the Kagoshima Broncos defeating the New York Knights.

The poem describes the drifting and sinking of a boat lost at sea in a fragmented first-person narrative saturated with vivid imagery and symbolism.\n\nRimbaud, then aged 16, wrote the poem in the summer of 1871 at his childhood home in Charleville in Northern France. Rimbaud included the poem in a letter he sent to Paul Verlaine in September 1871 to introduce himself to Verlaine. Shortly afterwards, he joined Verlaine in Paris and became his lover.\n\nRimbaud was inspired to write the poem after reading Jules Verne's novel \"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea\", which had recently been published in book form, and which is known to have been the source of many of the poem's allusions and images. Another Verne novel, \"The Adventures of Captain Hatteras\", was likely an additional source of inspiration.\n\nThe poem is arranged in a series of 25 alexandrine quatrains with an \"a/b/a/b\" rhyme-scheme. It is woven around the delirious visions of the eponymous boat, swamped and lost at sea. It was considered revolutionary in its use of imagery and symbolism. One of the longest and perhaps best poems in Rimbaud's œuvre, it opens with the following quatrain:\nRimbaud biographer Enid Starkie describes the poem as an anthology of memorable images and lines. The voice is that of the drunken boat itself. The boat tells of becoming filled with water, thus \"drunk.\" Sinking through the sea, the boat describes a journey of varied experience that includes sights of the purest and most transcendent (\"l'éveil jaune et bleu des phosphores chanteurs\", \"the yellow-blue alarum of phosphors singing\") and at the same time of the most repellent (\"nasses / Où pourrit dans les joncs tout un Léviathan\", \"nets where a whole Leviathan was rotting\"). The marriage of exaltation and debasement, the synesthesia, and the mounting astonishment make this hundred-line poem the fulfillment of Rimbaud's youthful poetic theory that the poet becomes a seer, a vatic being, through the disordering of the senses. To these attractions are added alexandrines of immediate aural appeal: \"Fermentent les rousseurs amères de l'amour!\" (\"fermenting the bitter blushes of love\").\n\nThe boat's (and reader's) mounting astonishment reaches its high point in lines 87-88: \"Est-ce en ces nuits sans fonds que tu dors et t'exiles / Million d'oiseaux d'or, ô future Vigueur?\" (\"Is it in these bottomless nights that you sleep and exile yourself / a million golden birds, o future Strength? ) Afterwards the vision is lost and the spell breaks. The speaker, still a boat, wishes for death (\"Ô que ma quille éclate! Ô que j'aille à la mer!\" \"O that my keel would break! O that I would go to the sea!\" ). The grandiose aspirations have deceived, leaving exhaustion and the sense of imprisonment. In this way, \"Le Bateau Ivre\" proleptically recapitulates Rimbaud's poetic career, which dissipated when he discovered that verse could not provide the universal understanding and harmony that it had seemed to when he was younger.\n\n\"Le Bateau Ivre\" remains one of the gems of French poetry and of Rimbaud's poetic output. Vladimir Nabokov translated it to Russian in 1928. French poet-composer Léo Ferré set it to music and sang it in the album \"Ludwig-L'Imaginaire-Le Bateau ivre\" (1982).\n\n\n\"Le Bateau ivre\" as a wall poem in Paris.\n\n\n"}

In 2017, Mercado top billed the Philippine remake of \"My Love from the Star\".\n\nMercado's success in Philippine cinema has made her one of the top actresses in the country and established her status as the \"Ultimate Star\".\n\nJennylyn Mercado was born on 15 May 1987, to a mother who was a beauty consultant in a duty-free store. Her stepfather abused her as a child and burned her skin with cigarette butts. He was jailed for abusing Mercado, who was four years old at the time. Her mother, who was working in Dubai, immediately flew back to the Philippines not to help her daughter but to bail him out. After the incident, her aunt took her away and raised her, eventually adopting Mercado as her legal daughter. Mercado grew up in Parañaque, Metro Manila. She spent her senior year of high school at the Augustinian Abbey School in Las Piñas.\n\nOn 14 October 2004, Mercado's life story was featured in the weekly drama anthology \"Magpakailanman\". She is an official spokesperson of the Bata Foundation (Christian Mission Services), a non-governmental organization.\n\nMercado is the niece of television reporter Abner Mercado. She has three cousins: Cherie Mercado is a news and radio anchor for News5, and sisters Charee Pineda and Eliza Pineda both work under the same network. She is also a distant relative of child actor Onyok Pineda.\n\nMercado started as a recording artist with Alpha Records in 1999 through the recommendation of her voice coach, Susanna Pichay. Mercado was in Nonoy Tan's singing group, G4. The group recorded two songs but never released an album due to two of the four members dropping out. After G4, Mercado went into commercial modeling, landing a stint with Bambini cologne and a Pond's TV advertisement. She was also part of the Elite Circle of \"10 Modeling Search\", where she competed with \"StarStruck\" co-finalist, Dion Ignacio.\n\nIn 2002, Mercado made her debut acting appearance playing a minor role in ABS-CBN's TV series \"Kay Tagal Kang Hinintay\", which was top-billed by Bea Alonzo and John Lloyd Cruz.\n\nIn 2003, Mercado joined the reality show \"StarStruck\". She and Mark Herras won, receiving 1,000,000 pesos and exclusive contracts from the GMA Network. After winning \"StarStruck\", Mercado starred in numerous TV series, including \"Encantadia\", \"I Luv NY\", \"Dangal\", \"Super Twins\", \"Paano Ba Ang Mangarap?\", \"\", \"Ikaw Sana\", and \"Gumapang Ka Sa Lusak\". She also acted in films such as\"So Happy Together\" (2004) and teen-flick \"Let the Love Begin\" (2005).\n\nMercado released her first album \"Living the Dream\", which contained original compositions by Vehnee Saturno, and a carrier single titled \"Kahit Sandali\". In May 2006, Mercado released her second album \"Letting Go\", which included the single \"Sa Aking Panaginip\" by Vehnee Saturno. Mercado's first major concert was held at the Music Museum in Greenhills on 15 May 2006. In May 2009, she held a sold-out birthday concert titled \"I Am Woman\" at the Music Museum. In January 2010, under Viva Records, she released her third album, \"Love Is... Jennylyn Mercado\".\n\nMercado starred in Filipino period piece \"Rosario\" (2010). Her acting career was handled by Becky Aguila and Viva Entertainment, where she joined her \"Starstruck\" co-alumnus Cristine Reyes. Mercado's singing career was managed by Viva Records. In 2011, her contract with Viva ended and was not renewed, though she joined Cristine Reyes. In 2013, Mercado signed with Regal Entertainment. She also signed with PolyEast Records, hoping to her reinvent herself as singer.\n\nMercado branched out into television hosting, hosting reality series \"\" with co-hosts Ogie Alcasid and Dingdong Dantes. She was also in the GMA-7 Sunday talk show, \"Showbiz Central\".\n\nIn 2013, Mercado acted in the romance \"The Bride and the Lover\" (2013). Her contract with Polyeast Records ended that year. In 2014, she played the role of a woman with a split personality through Rhodora X. According to Mercado, this was the most challenging role she has ever played. In late 2014, she released her fifth album through GMA Records.\n\nAt the end of 2014, Mercado agreed to participate in the 2014 Metro Manila Film Festival (MMFF). Her entry, \"English Only, Please\" (2014), was originally offered to singer-actress Angeline Quinto and was chosen as one of the eight official movies for the film festival. It became a success despite having fewer promotions than the other movies included. Critics deemed it a \"sleeper hit\". In the film, Mercado played the role of Tere Madlansacay, a Filipino tutor. The film's success established her as a movie star. In early 2015, Mercado received the MMFF Best Actress award for the recently concluded film festival.\n\nIn 2015, Mercado was first in the \"FHM\" \"Philippines' 100 Sexiest Women\" list after Marian Rivera vacated the title. Before Mercado traveled to New York for the film \"PreNup\" with actor Sam Milby, she was surprised and given a plaque by publisher Aeus Reyes, Allan Altera, and GMA News reporter Nelson Canlas. On 11 July, Mercado participated in the two-part \"FHM\" 100 Sexiest party at the SMX Convention Center in the SM Mall of Asia.\n\nMercado played the lead role of Melanie \"Mel\" Fernandez-Dela Paz in the GMA series \"My Faithful Husband\", which aired on 10 August 2015. Despite its success, the series was not extended due to scheduling conflicts with Mercado, who at the time was acting in two films, \"The Prenup\" and \"WalangForever\". The series earned the lead actors multiple acting awards and nominations. After the commercial success of \"WalangForever\", Mercado earned her second consecutive MMFF Best Actress award in 2015.\n\nThrough social media, Mercado announced her upcoming project, confirming that she was acting in a new film with actor John Lloyd Cruz. The film, titled \"Just the 3 of Us\", was produced by Star Cinema. It earned 16 million pesos in its opening day, which was the highest opening day gross of any of Mercado's movies and set a record for the highest opening day gross for a Philippine film. It went on to be one of the highest-grossing Philippine films of 2016.\n\nAfter months of negotiations, Mercado and the GMA Network renewed their contract on 4 July 2016. As part of the contract, Mercado hosted GMA's new comedy-singing show \"Superstar Duets\". She was later chosen to play the role of Steffi for the Philippine remake of the South Korean series \"My Love from the Star\".\n\nIn October 2018, Mercado became the first Filipina brand ambassador for international makeup brand Max Factor.\n\nIn 2008, at age 21, Mercado announced that she was pregnant. Her ex-boyfriend Patrick Garcia, who distanced himself upon learning of her pregnancy, was announced as the father of her child. On 16 August 2008, she gave birth to her son, Alex Jazz, via Caesarian section.\n\nIn 2007, Mercado and actor Patrick Garcia admitted that their relationship had lasted for a year after Mercado got pregnant. In 2010, Mercado began dating actor Dennis Trillo until they broke up in 2011. In 2011, television host and actor Luis Manzano admitted he was dating Mercado during an interview in ABS-CBN talk show \"Showbiz News Ngayon\". They eventually broke up in 2013. After working together again in 2015, Mercado and Trillo were rumored to be in a relationship again, but this has not been confirmed.\n\nMercado is a political activist. She works with GABRIELA, a Philippine women's organization.\n\nMercado is also an aspiring triathlete. In her free time, she takes jujitsu and Muay Thai lessons. \"They built up my muscles. I looked heavy onscreen,\" Mercado recounted. \"I realized that I needed cardio exercises to slim down.\" She discovered running and biking, which soon led her to join duathlon competitions in Alabang and Laguna. She is also a diver and wishes to inspire people to be environment friendly.\n\n"}

Ion wind is an electrohydrodynamic phenomenon. Ion wind generators can also be considered electrohydrodynamic thrusters.\n\nThe term \"ionic wind\" is considered a misnomer due to misconceptions that only positive and negative ions were primarily involved in the phenomenon. A 2018 study found that electrons play a larger role than the negative ions during the negative voltage period. As a result, the term \"electric wind\" has been suggested as a more accurate terminology.\n\nThis phenomenon is now used in an MIT ionic wind plane, the first solid state plane, developed in 2018.\n\nB. Wilson in 1750 demonstrated the recoil force associated to the same corona discharge and precursor to the ion thruster was the corona discharge pinwheel. The corona discharge from the freely rotating pinwheel arm with ends bent to sharp points gives the air a space charge which repels the point because the polarity is the same for the point and the air.\n\nFrancis Hauksbee, curator of instruments for the Royal Society of London, made the earliest report of electric wind in 1709. Myron Robinson completed an extensive bibliography and literature review during the 1950s resurgence of interest in the phenomena.\n\nIn 2018, researchers from South Korea and Slovenia used Schlieren photography to experimentally determine that electrons, in addition to ions, play an important role in generating ionic wind. The study was the first to provide direct evidence that the electrohydrodynamic force responsible for the ionic wind is caused by a charged particle drag that occur as the electrons and ions push the neutral particles away.\n\nIn 2018, a team of MIT researchers built and successfully flew the first-ever prototype plane propelled by ionic wind.\n\nNet electric charges on conductors, including local charge distributions associated with dipoles, reside entirely on their external surface (see Faraday cage), and tend to concentrate more around sharp points and edges than on flat surfaces. This means that the electric field generated by charges on a sharp conductive point is much stronger than the field generated by the same charge residing on a large smooth spherical conductive shell. When this electric field strength exceeds what is known as the corona discharge inception voltage (CIV) gradient, it ionizes the air about the tip, and a small faint purple jet of plasma can be seen in the dark on the conductive tip. Ionization of the nearby air molecules result in generation of ionized air molecules having the same polarity as that of the charged tip. Subsequently, the tip repels the like-charged ion cloud, and the ion cloud immediately expands due to the repulsion between the ions themselves. This repulsion of ions creates an electric \"wind\" that emanates from the tip, which is usually accompanied by a hissing noise due to the change in air pressure at the tip. An opposite force acts on the tip that may recoil if not tight to ground.\n\nA vaneless ion wind generator performs the inverse function, using ambient wind to move ions, which are collected yielding electrical energy.\n\n"}

The company came under the ownership of MPF Industry Group in 2010. Since the acquisition, FÉG is one of the biggest exporters of HVAC products to the international markets in the East-Central European heating device industry.\n\nOn February 24, 1891, the legal predecessor of the Fegyver- and Machinery Factory (FÉG) was founded in Budapest. In the beginnings the company produced rifles and pistols for the Austro-Hungarian Army and also exported its products for foreign armies.\nThe company became an important arms manufacturer in the country, but it also produced gas equipment, water heaters, lamps and miscellaneous metalware. The production of Diesel engines started in 1899, when the Hungarian engineer Oszkár Epperlein (1844-1903) and Jenő Böszörményi (1872 - 1957) bought the patent rights of Diesel engines for the FÉG company from his collaborator Rudolf Diesel. Throughout its history it was renamed several times for various reasons; to Fémáru, Fegyver- és Gépgyár (\"Metalware, Arms and Machine Factory\") in 1935, to Lámpagyár (\"Lamp Factory\") in 1946, to Fegyver- és Gázkészülékgyár (\"Arms and Gas Equipment Factory\") in 1965. Decades later, in post-communist times it was renamed as FÉGARMY Fegyvergyártó Kft. (\"FÉGARMY Arms Factory Ltd.\").\n\nThrough its history it always fulfilled a crucial role in supplying the Honvédség with small arms, this company also manufactured and exported a variety of semi-automatic pistols and rifles, including the P9M and the PJK-9HP models (copies of the famous Browning Hi-Power) and the FÉG PA-63 (a Walther PP/PPK clone in 9×18mm Makarov), but currently only self-loading pistols (P9L, P9M, P9R, etc.) and break-barrel air rifles (LG 427, LG 527). In Hungary the company is also famous for its starting pistols, for example the GRP-9, as well as manufacturing most of the propane water boilers and heaters found in Hungarian panel houses.\n\nAfter 2004 many of its traditional export markets were put under embargo and this caused the company to stop its activity connected to the defence industry. At the end of 2010, FÉG almost went bankrupt when HUF 1.7 billion of funds disappeared from the company. MPF Industry Group made an important investment to rescue the company and restarted the production. Since MPF Industry Group's reorganization, FÉG is one of the biggest East-Central European HVAC manufacturers.\n"}

It was opened in 1956 in response to population growth in southern Christchurch during the 1950s.\n\nThe school is located in the suburb of Cashmere, New Zealand, on the northern bank of the Heathcote River overlooked by the Cashmere Hills. Serving Years 9 to 13, Cashmere has a roll of students as of , making it the third-largest school in Christchurch.\n\nThe school opened at the beginning of the 1956 school year with 198 students under founding headmaster Terry McCombs, a former Member of the New Zealand House of Representatives who had served as Minister of Education from 1947 to 1949. McCombs served seventeen years as headmaster before retiring at the end of the 1972 school year.\n\nIn the late 1980s, state school administration across New Zealand was reformed by the Fourth Labour Government in what was known as the \"Tomorrow's Schools\" reforms. From 1989, Cashmere was no longer under the governance of the Canterbury Education Board, which had been abolished, but under the self-governance of a Board of Trustees elected by the school community.\n\nThe current principal, Joe Eccleton, replaced Mark Wilson in July 2019.\nCashmere suffered moderate damage in 22 February 2011 Christchurch earthquake, mainly from liquefaction. On the day, the school had closed for instruction for the day at 12:00 pm due to the Post Primary Teachers' Association, the main secondary school teachers' trade union, holding a paid union meeting that afternoon, meaning very few students and staff were on site when the quake struck at 12:51 pm. The school reopened on 14 March after the school buildings were inspected and deemed safe, and essential repairs and temporary fixes had been carried out. In the aftermath of the earthquake, the school played host to Linwood College in a site sharing agreement while Linwood's severely damaged facilities were inspected and repaired. Cashmere used the site in the morning, while Linwood used the site in the afternoon for five months, until Linwood College moved back to its original site on 1 August.\n\nCashmere operates an enrolment scheme to help curb roll numbers and prevent overcrowding. The school's home zone, in which students residing are automatically entitled to be enrolled without rejection, covers the southern suburbs of Christchurch as well as the settlements around the western and southern shores of Lyttelton Harbour. Suburbs and towns within the zone include Beckenham, Cashmere, Huntsbury, Murray Aynsley, Saint Martins, Somerfield, Spreydon, Sydenham, and Westmorland; parts of Addington and Hoon Hay; Hillsborough, Opawa and Waltham west of State Highway 76; and Governors Bay, Diamond Harbour, and Port Levy. Students residing outside the zone are accepted as roll places allow per the enrolment scheme order of preference and secret ballot.\n\nAt the October 2013 Education Review Office (ERO) review, Cashmere had 1666 students enrolled, including 46 international students. There was an even number of male and female students. Seventy-five percent of students identified as New Zealand European (Pākehā), nine percent as Māori, three percent each as Asian, and Pacific Islanders, and ten percent as another ethnicity.\n\nCashmere High School operates a regular timetable with five 55-minute teaching periods per day, except on Wednesdays where teaching periods are only 50 minutes each.\n\nIn Year 9, English, Mathematics, Science, Social Studies, Physical Education and Health are compulsory and are studied for the whole year, while students rotate through four Technology subjects: Design Technologies, Graphic Communication, Materials and Electronics and Control, and Food Technology, studying one of them per school term. Students choose two Arts options out of Visual Art, Drama and Music to study for two terms each, and a Foreign Language option out of French, Japanese, Te Reo Māori and Spanish. There are no optional subjects.\n\nIn Year 10, English, Mathematics, Science, Social Studies, Physical Education and Health remain compulsory subjects. Students elect between two and four optional subjects to fill the two remaining subject lines on their timetable – either two full-year subjects, a full-year and two half-year subjects, or four half-year subjects.\n\nIn Years 11 to 13, students complete the National Certificate of Educational Achievement (NCEA), the main secondary school qualification in New Zealand. Levels 1, 2 and 3 of NCEA are usually completed in years 11, 12 and 13 respectively, although students can choose subjects from different levels depending on their progress through the NCEA level system. Students study six subjects per year (five in Year 13), with English being compulsory in Years 11 and 12, and Mathematics and Science being compulsory in Year 11.\n\nIn 2013, 91.4 percent of students leaving Cashmere High held at least NCEA Level 1, 79.6 percent held at least NCEA Level 2, and 54.0 percent held at least University Entrance. This compares nationally to 85.2%, 74.2%, and 49.0% respectively.\n\nThe school has a Conductive education unit, which opened in 2002, and caters for up to 20 secondary school-aged students.\n\nCashmere has six school houses into which students are grouped, each is named after a notable New Zealander.\n\n\n"}

It is down the line from and is situated between and on the main line. It is managed by London North Eastern Railway.\n\nIt is a major passenger interchange between the main line, Cross Country Route and local services running across the North of England. It is also the point for which London North Eastern Railway services branching off to diverge from the main route continuing north towards Edinburgh.\n\nThe railway station was built in 1849 replacing a temporary structure constructed a year earlier. It was rebuilt in its present form in 1938 and has had several slight modifications since that date, most notably in 2006, when the new interchange and connection to Frenchgate Centre opened.\n\nIn May 2015, construction commenced on a new Platform 0 to the north-east of the station adjacent to the Frenchgate Centre on the site of the former cattle dock. It will be used by terminating Northern services to Hull, Beverley, Bridlington and Scarborough. This will allow these services to operate independently of the East Coast Main Line. It is joined to the rest of the station via a fully accessible overbridge.\n\n\nThe station has nine platforms on three islands. Platforms 1, 3, 4 and 8 can take through trains. Platforms 2 and 5 are south-facing bays, and 0, 6 and 7 are north facing bays. A first class lounge is available on platform 3A.\n\nPlatform 0 is scheduled to take almost exclusively Northern services to and from Hull, Beverley and Bridlington. The brand new platform opened on 12 December 2016.\n\nPlatform 1 is scheduled to take southbound London North Eastern Railway, Grand Central and Hull Trains trains towards London King's Cross. \nLondon North Eastern Railway services come from Leeds and Edinburgh, Grand Central services from Bradford Interchange to London King's Cross, which operate non-stop from Doncaster and Hull Trains services from Hull.\n\nPlatform 2 has no scheduled trains and is not normally for public use.\n\nPlatform 3A is scheduled to take some southbound East Coast Main Line trains towards London King's Cross – London North Eastern Railway services here usually originate in York calling at all stations along the route (Retford, Newark North Gate, Grantham, Peterborough, and Stevenage); and the platform is scheduled to take some southbound Hull Trains services to London King's Cross.\n\nPlatform 3B takes services to Sheffield and Manchester / Manchester Airport, operated by Northern and TransPennine Express and will take services from Sheffield when there is congestion.\n\n\"Between platforms 3 and 4 are the high speed up and down lines from London\"\n\nPlatform 4 is scheduled to take northbound London North Eastern Railway services towards York, Newcastle and Edinburgh; Hull Trains services to Hull; Northern through services to Bridlington and Scarborough from Sheffield; and TransPennine Express services to Cleethorpes. However, southbound CrossCountry services towards Birmingham New Street and beyond also depart from this platform.\n\nPlatform 5 is a bay platform used for Northern and East Midlands Railway services to Sheffield and Lincoln Central (some of which extend to Peterborough).\n\nPlatform 6 is a bay platform used almost exclusively for Northern commuter services to Leeds.\n\nPlatform 7 is seldom in public use, but when it is, is used for Northern services towards Scunthorpe via all stations.\n\nPlatform 8 is used for northbound London North Eastern Railway services towards Leeds; and CrossCountry services to Newcastle; and local services in both directions – south to Sheffield and north to Adwick. The platform is also used for Northern local services to Scunthorpe via all stations. Southbound CrossCountry services are also scheduled to use this platform, but only at times when the station is otherwise congested.\n\nThere are presently no ticket barriers in operation at this station; however on race days (at Doncaster Racecourse), manual ticket checks are in operation in the subway.\n\nThe station has been recently refurbished in 2006 and is now directly connected to the Frenchgate Centre extension in Doncaster town centre. The station now has a new booking office for tickets and information, three new lifts, refurbished staircases and subway. There is a newsagent and some food outlets. More recently, interactive touch screens have been installed around the station by London North Eastern Railway services to provide information about local attractions, live departures and disruptions and station facilities. As well as this, mobile phone charging points are now available on the concourse, touch screen, self-service ticketing machines have been installed across the concourse and the stairways to the subway have now been divided into two way systems to improve the flow of passengers during peak times.\n\nIn a route study by Network Rail it was proposed that new platforms could be built on the western side of the station to meet demand expected in the future.\n\nIn March 2019, it was revealed that there were plans, as part of the East Coast improvement programme in , to add an additional platform at Doncaster.\n\n\nSeven train operating companies (TOCs) call at Doncaster, which is the highest number of companies in the UK and is also equal in number only to Crewe and Liverpool Lime Street in the UK. Train operators include the following:\n\nCrossCountry\nCrossCountry have dropped most Doncaster to Edinburgh services. They offer an hourly service to Newcastle and Reading with one service per day running through to both Edinburgh Waverley and Guildford or Southampton Central. The majority of CrossCountry services at Doncaster use 4-car Voyager DEMUs (Class 220s).\n\nEast Midlands Railway\nEast Midlands Railway offer a limited direct service to London St Pancras and to Leeds, York and Scarborough. Services to London St Pancras run via Sheffield, Chesterfield, Derby and Leicester but less often and have longer journey times than London North Eastern Railway services. They also operate a local service to Lincoln which occasionally extends to Sleaford and Peterborough.\n\nHull Trains\nHull Trains operates services between London King's Cross and Hull or Beverley via Selby.\n\nTransPennine Express\nTransPennine Express serve stations towards the east to Cleethorpes, and to the west towards Manchester Airport. TransPennine services operate hourly in each direction generally.\n\nGrand Central\nGrand Central offers four trains a day between Bradford Interchange and King's Cross. All Bradford-London services call at Doncaster. Southbound the next stop is King's Cross with a journey time of around 90 minutes – the fastest on the route due to the non-stop nature of the service.\n\nNorthern\nNorthern generally offers services from Doncaster to stations within Yorkshire and Lincolnshire, such as Sheffield, Leeds and Lincoln. It provides stopping services, stopping at every station along-route, and 'fast' services, stopping at just the principal stations. It is possible to travel on Northern Rail to Retford from Doncaster, via Sheffield, on a direct train. However, this involves a journey of 80 min from Adwick. The direct London North Eastern Railway service takes, on average, just 14 min.\n\nLondon North Eastern Railway\nLondon North Eastern Railway offers regular (55 trains per day) direct trains services to London King's Cross, which can be reached in 100–115 mins, depending on the service. All trains to Leeds call at Doncaster, and an hourly service to Newcastle or Scotland (Edinburgh and the once daily Glasgow Central service). London North Eastern Railway also offer services to cities such as Leeds (terminating services), York, Newcastle, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Inverness and Aberdeen.\n\nThere were plans to add platforms 9 and 10 to cope with Eurostar trains but this project was cancelled when it was decided that Eurostar would not serve Britain outside the South East of England.\n\nIn 1973 the station was featured in the first episode of \"Whatever Happened to the Likely Lads?\", entitled \"Strangers on a Train\", featuring James Bolam and Rodney Bewes. Although it is not stated where the scenes in the station were filmed, signs for Grimsby Town and Scunthorpe are visible in the background.\n\n"}

{"id": "2265038", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2265038", "title": "Caret notation", "text": "Caret notation\n\nCaret notation is a notation for control characters in ASCII. The notation assigns to control-code 1, sequentially through the alphabet to assigned to control-code 26 (0x1A). For the control-codes outside of the range 1–26, the notation extends to the adjacent, non-alphabetic ASCII characters.\n\nOften a control character can be typed on a keyboard by holding down the and typing the character shown after the caret. The notation is often used to describe keyboard shortcuts even though the control character is not actually used (as in \"type ^X to cut the text\").\n\nThe meaning or interpretation of, or response to the individual control-codes is \"not\" prescribed by the caret notation.\n\nThe notation consists of a caret () followed by a single character (usually a capital letter). The digraph stands for the control character whose ASCII code is the same as the character's ASCII code with the uppermost bit, in a 7-bit encoding, reversed. A useful mnemonic, this has the effect of rendering the C0 control character with code \"N\", (where \"N\" is from 1 up to ) as the \"N\"th capital letter of the alphabet, since capital letters are represented by the ASCII code range 65–90 (0x41–0x5A). Seven ASCII control characters map outside the upper-case alphabet: 0 (NUL) is , 27 (ESC) is , 28 is , 29 is , 30 is , 31 is , and 127 (DEL) is .\n\nExamples are \"\" for the Windows CR,LF newline pair, and describing the ANSI escape sequence to clear the screen as \"\".\n\nOnly the use of characters in the range of 63–95 (\"\") is specifically allowed in the notation, but use of lower-case alphabetic characters entered at the keyboard is nearly always allowed – they are treated as equivalent to upper-case letters.\n\nReversing the uppermost of 7 bits is accomplished by a bit-wise exclusive or with 0x40 (64). This is identical to adding 64 modulus 128, or adding 64 and masking with 0x7F. This same operation is done both to convert from a control code to the character to print after the caret, and the reverse to convert a character to a control code. When converting to a control character, except for '?', masking with 0x1F will produce the same result and also turn lower-case into the same control character as upper-case.\n\nThere is no corresponding version of the caret notation for control-codes with more than 7 bits such as the C1 control characters from 128–159 (0x80–0x9F). Some programs that produce caret notation show these as backslash and octal (\"\" through \"\"). \"Also see the bar notation used by Acorn Computers, below\".\n\nMany computer systems allow the user to enter a control character by holding down and pressing the letter used in the caret notation. This is practical, because many control characters (e.g. EOT) cannot be entered directly from a keyboard. Although there are many ways to represent control characters, this correspondence between notation and typing makes the caret notation suitable for many applications.\n\nUsually the need to hold down is avoided, for instance lower-case letters work just like upper-case ones. On a US keyboard layout produces DEL and produces ^@. It is also common for to produce ^@.\n\nCaret notation is used to describe control characters in output by many programs, particularly Unix terminal drivers and text file viewers such as and commands. Although the use of control-codes is somewhat standard, some uses differ from operating system to operating system, or even from program to program.

{"id": "2265040", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2265040", "title": "Lebanon national rugby league team", "text": "Lebanon national rugby league team\n\nThe Lebanon national rugby league team (Arabic: المنتخب اللبناني للرجبي ليغ) is the representative side of Lebanon in rugby league football. It is the top tier team of the Lebanese Rugby League Federation. They are nicknamed \"The Cedars\" after the Lebanon Cedar tree, which is also on the Lebanese flag. The team has been participating in international competition since 1998. The team was originally formed in New South Wales, Australia, composed of Lebanese Australians. But their success has helped the game grow in Lebanon and now players are also taken from the newly formed Lebanon Championship as well as the National Rugby League in Australia.\n\nThe team played in the 2000 World Cup, having defeated the USA to get there. But it failed in getting out of the group stages, despite a draw against the Cook Islands in Cardiff and a 24–22 defeat against Wales in Llanelli. The Cedars then attempted to qualify for the 2008 World Cup but lost their group to Ireland and finally losing the repechage final to Samoa. In other competitions they have been more successful. They have taken part in the Mediterranean Cup and have won it in every year it has been played. In 2006 they won the Phoenician Cup by beating Malta.\n\nThe Cedars had a successful World Cup 2017 campaign, qualifying by beating South Africa, and then getting through the tournament \"group of death\" first stage with England, France and Australia, by beating France in their first game. In the knock out stage a very close loss to Tonga meant no further progress, but guaranteed entry into the next World Cup due to be held in the UK in 2021\n\nInitially the Lebanese players were all Australian born or raised and came mostly from inner-city Sydney. They started playing full internationals in 1998 and in their first match defeated Japan in Tokyo. This got them a place in Mediterranean Pool for qualification to the 2000 World Cup. In their first game they defeated Italy 36–16, and then defeated Morocco 104–0. In this match, captain Hazem El Masri scored a total of 48 points, the highest number of points ever scored by one player in an international match. To qualify they had to beat the Pacific Rim Pool winners, the USA. They won 62–8 and secured the final place in the World Cup. Following the match the team were warned about their conduct after a car-park fight which resulted in American winger Tony Fabri being taken to hospital.\n\nThe Cedars were in a pool with favourites New Zealand, Wales and Cook Islands. The team were well beaten against New Zealand in Gloucester, where there were ferocious winds and rain. Head coach John Elias said after the game that his team were simply out of their depth. However Lebanon did much better in the match against Wales. It wasn't until Wales had scored four tries that Lebanon had finally got on the score board with a Michael Coorey try in the 35th minute. In the second half Lebanon performed much better, but two late Hassan Saleh tries left Lebanon losing 24–22. By far the easiest game on paper was the match against the Cook Islands. With just five minutes remaining though, The Cedars found themselves 22–10 down, before Hazem El Masri scored a second try and centre Charles Baynie scored one too in last minute to seal a 22–22 draw for Lebanon. This point was enough to keep them off bottom place in the group, but they had not done enough to earn a place in the quarter-finals.\n\nIn 2002, Lebanon beat France 36–6 in front of 16,713 spectators at Tripoli to clinch the Mediterranean Cup for a second time. In 2003 played host to another Mediterranean Cup with Lebanon beating France again in final, albeit this was a much closer match at 26–18 with Wissam El Masri only fully securing the win in the last minute. In the final Mediterranean Cup in 2004, Lebanon made it three victories in a row. Just like last year's cup, they easily beat Morocco and Serbia to face the French in the final again. France trailed 30–8 at half time but in the second half it was a much tighter affair with Toufiq Nicolas and a third Ahmed Al Masri try finally sealing a 42–14 victory for Lebanon despite a late consolation try for France. It is also worth noting that a young Thomas Bosc featured in that match for France. He would then go on to play in the 2007 Challenge Cup Final.\nDespite wanting to host another Mediterranean Cup in 2005, Lebanon did not play another international until November 2006. With a place in the 2008 World Cup up for grabs, Lebanon were drawn in a group with Russia and Ireland. In Darren Maroon's first match as head coach, Lebanon beat Russia 22–8 in a tight and tense match at the New River Stadium in North London. Ireland however had already thrashed Russia beforehand and so Lebanon needed to beat Ireland in Dublin to go top of the table. Centre Daniel Chiha crossed over the line after 13 minutes, but the conversion was missed. John Koborsi then extended the lead for Lebanon and the team went into half time 0–10 up. However within 6 minutes after half-time, Ireland had scored two tries and they were now in front. A little later Chris Salem then intercepted a ball near his own line and ran the whole length of the pitch to score a spectacular try. This lead didn't last though and in the last minutes of the game Ireland scored a try to end the game 18–18. In 2007 the World Cup qualifying matches continued. In October the team travelled to Moscow and put nine-tries past Russia to win 0–48. This meant that their last match against Ireland was crucial. Because Ireland had a significantly better points difference then Lebanon, The Cedars needed a win to qualify, a draw or a narrow defeat was simply not good enough. At the end of the Russia match, despite the easy victory, Darren Maroon said that the team must make big improvements if they were to beat the Irish. Due to the volatile situation in Lebanon, The Cedars had to play their \"home tie\" in Dewsbury, England. A George Ndaira try in the first half meant that Lebanon went into half time on the wrong end of a 12–4 scoreline. Chris Salem immediately scored a try after the interval though and Lebanon were back in the game. In the 63rd minute prop Charlie Nohra was sent off, leaving Lebanon with 12 men and a huge upward struggle. Frank Samia scored a converted try near the end of the match and so Lebanon were ahead for the first time in the match. In the last minute the two points were taken away as a high-tackle gave Ireland a penalty which they scored to end the game 16–16. Lebanon had not done enough to secure a place in the World Cup.\n\nBut because they had finished, they went into a repechage match with three other teams, Wales, USA and Samoa. They faced Wales first and won that match in Widnes, England. In took a long time for Lebanon too actually take the lead for the first time in the match, but in the second half Lebanon were much stronger than Wales and eventually posted nine tries, including three by Chris Salem, against Wales' five. This victory also meant that Lebanon had extended their unbeaten streak to 13 matches, and in doing so beating Australia's record of 12 unbeaten matches from 1999 to 2001. Samoa had beaten the US in the other match and so Lebanon and Samoa faced each other in Featherstone, England for the tenth and final place in the 2008 World Cup. Samoa had a lot of the possession during the match and were noticeably physically larger. Samoa went into half time with a 28–8 lead despite a George Ndaira try for Lebanon on the 18th minute and an Adnan Saleh try very near to half-time. Two more tries in the second half were not enough for Lebanon and they lost the match 16–38, scoring four tries but converting none of them.\n\nLebanon were drawn against Serbia, Italy and Russia in the qualifying group for the 2013 Rugby League World Cup, with the winners of the group progressing to the final tournament. Following comfortable victories over Serbia and Russia, Lebanon set up a winner-takes-all match against Italy in Belgrade on 29 October. The game finished in a draw with the score at 19–19, which unfortunately meant that Italy qualified for the World Cup ahead of Lebanon based on points difference. This is the second time in a row that Lebanon have failed to qualify for the World Cup despite not losing a game in the qualifiers.\n\nLebanon were drawn initially in a one-off playoff in Dubai, United Arab Emirates against the African rugby league nation of South Africa, however the match was shifted to a two match play-off in Pretoria, South Africa due to a controversial arrest of Sol Mokdad following a complaint from UAE rugby union officials.\n\nLebanon comfortably won the play-off fixtures with an aggregate score of 90-28 with Travis Robinson scored 3 tries in each of the games.\n\nLebanon were drawn into a tough group with Australia, England and France. Three teams from the group would qualify for the quarter-finals with Lebanon being the favourites to be knocked out. Lebanon's team was mostly made up of Lebanese-Australians who played their club rugby in Australia, the most high profile of these players being captain and NRL star Robbie Farah who had previously played for Australia, and upcoming prospect Mitchell Moses. The Cedars were coached by Australian legendary player Brad Fittler\n\nThey started the tournament with a game against France at Canberra Stadium, Canberra. Travis Robinson, who had scored 6 tries in the qualifying play-off series, scored 2 tries in the game to cause an upset and win 29-18. This win was Lebanon's first at a world cup. Their next game came against England, losing 10-29. Their last group game also saw them lose 34-0 to overwhelming tournament favourites Australia. This performance however was seen as a decent one due to Lebanon's admirable defensive effort and ability to keep Australia's score much lower than was expected.\n\nLebanon's win against France was enough to send them into the knock-out stages of the competition where they faced Tonga. With a score of 22-24, Lebanon lost by just two points in the quarter-final. Lebanon's progression to the knock-out stages of the tournament has also qualified them for the 2021 Rugby League World Cup.\n\nLebanon automatically qualified for the 2021 Rugby League World Cup having reached the quarter finals of the previous Rugby League World Cup.

Most of Lebanon's games have been played as friendlies or as part of the Mediterranean Cup which has taken place sporadically from 1999, with Lebanon winning all 5 tournaments that have been held.\n\nLebanon have a 65% win record, holding impressive records against a number of more experienced teams such as France whom they hold an 80% win record from 5 games and a 71% win record against Italy whom they have played 7 times. Lebanon have played the 'big three' teams of Australia, New Zealand and England once each, losing each time, the losses against Australia and England coming in the group stage of the 2017 World Cup.\n\nOver the 19 years of Lebanon's existence, they have played 20 different countries, playing Italy the most with 7 games, France and Morocco being the second most at 5 games each.\n\nThe following table underneath shows Lebanon's all-time rugby league results record: They have been participating in International fixtures since 1998.\n\nLebanon have taken part in two world cups, in 2000 and 2017. In 2000, they were knocked out in the group stages after losing two games and drawing one, a 22-22 result against Cook Islands. Lebanon qualified for the 2017 tournament after beating South Africa in a two match play-off series. Lebanon won their first game in a world cup after beating France 29-18 in the group, a win that was enough to send them into the quarter-finals. Reaching this stage of the competition has also automatically qualified them for the 2021 Rugby League World Cup.\n\nThe most cap for Lebanon is Robin Hachache with 21 caps. Robin Hachache is a local domestic player in the Lebanese Rugby League Championship.\n\n\n"}

He regularly exhibits in Puerto Rico and the United States and participates in arts events around the world. He spends his time between his workshops in Ponce, Hato Rey, and New York City, his presentations worldwide and his academic work in Cayey, Puerto Rico.\n\nMartorell Cardona was born on April 18, 1939, in Santurce, Puerto Rico. He is the son of Antonio Martorell II and Luisa Cardona. His father left the family when Martorell was ten years old. He is the first of three children. He first started showing interest in arts as a small child with drawings.\n\nHe studied diplomacy at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., and then in 1961 went to study painting with Julio Martín Caro in Madrid. In the 1960s, he worked in Ponce, collaborating with Sor Isolina Ferre in the creation of community art workshops. He also worked at the workshop of Lorenzo Homar at the Instituto de Cultura Puertorriqueña between 1962-1965. He currently is the Resident Artist of the University of Puerto Rico at Cayey.\n\nMartorell's incursion into the arts came by the way of theater on 25 April 2001. He participated in the scenography of \"Celebración Verdiana \" for the opera by Plácido Domingo.\n\nMartorell currently has a workshop in New York City and another one on Calle Salmon (old Calle Comercio) in barrio Playa, Ponce, at a building that dates to 1815 and which he has occupied since 2007. Of his breezy workshop at Playa de Ponce and his spiritual connection there he has said \"more than Ponceño, I am a Playero...My north now is the South and its wide horizons.\"\n\nMartorell was the winner of the Bienal de Arte de San Juan, and has illustrated books of several authors including Alma Rosa Flor, Heraclio Cepeda, Nicholasa Mohr, and Pura Belpré. He also illustrated the \"ABC de Puerto Rico\" published by Troutman Press.\n\nIn the 1980s, Martorell dedicated himself to writing, producing various books. As a writer, Martorell has written books such as \"La piel de la memoria\" (translated as \"Memory's Tattoo\" by Andrew Hurley), and \"El libro dibujado\" (The Drawn Book). He currently writes a column for \"Escenario\", a section of Puerto Rican newspaper El Vocero.\n\nHe is the father of dancer Alejandra Martorell, stepfather of Giovanni Rodríguez, who directed the cult film, \"Red Canyon\", and the grandfather of Gael Rodríguez.\n\nIn December 2006, Martorell's workshop in Cayey, Puerto Rico, was subjected to arson with the loss of many works of art.\n\nThe most extensive publication on Martorell's work is Antonio Díaz-Royo's biography \"Martorell: la aventura de la creación\" (The Adventure of Creation). His paintings are found at the Instituto de Cultura Puertorriqueña, Museo de la Universidad de Puerto Rico, Museo de Arte de Ponce, Museo de Arte de Puerto Rico, Galería Nacional de San Salvador, Museo de Arte Moderno de México, Museo del Barrio, Whitney Museum and Hotel Melia in Ponce, Puerto Rico.\n\nMatorell's works have been reviewed by numerous critics. One, Nelson Rivera Rosario, analyzed three works by Martorell: Catálogo de objetos [Catalogue of Objects] (1974); White Christmas (1980); and Simplicity Patterns (1981). In his interpretation, Rivera Rosario believes the three works represent Martorell’s attempt to provide the Puerto Rican viewer with \"the means to see and evaluate their colonial status” so that, hopefully, they might lead to “eventual decolonization.”\n\n\n"}

He was a merchant clerk accompanying a fleet of \"thirty transports laden with goods for Edo,\" who, along with a number of others, had been caught in a storm; they found their way to Kamchatka, where only Dembei survived, to be found by Atlasov in 1701 or 1702. Despite pleading to be brought back to Japan, Dembei was instead brought to Saint Petersburg, where he told Peter the Great what he could about Japan; he also began teaching the Japanese language to a few Russians, making him the father of Japanese language education in Russia. He was baptized under the name of Gabriel and spent the rest of his life in St. Petersburg.\n\nAs a poor fisherman from Osaka, it is doubtful that he had any inside knowledge of Japan's politics or military organization, or anything else that might prove particularly interesting or important to the Russians. Nevertheless, it whetted their appetite for exploration of Kamchatka and the Kurils, and for attempting to open up trade with Japan.\n\nSome time between 1714 and 1719, he met traveller John Bell who gave the following account:\n\"I am persuaded that the islands of can be at no great distance from the southern parts of . What confirmed me in this opinion is, that I saw at a young man, a native of , who, I believe, is yet alive in the Academy of Sciences at that place. I asked him, by what accident he was brought so far from his own country; and he gave me the following account. That his father and himself, with a few persons more, being at a noted town called , on the west coast of the island, employed about some affairs of trade, and having finished their business, intended to return to their own habitations, on the north shore, by sailing round the coast. Therefore went they on board a small boat, and begun their voyage homeward; but, meeting with a strong gale off the land, they were unfortunately driven out to sea; and, in a few days, were cast upon the coast of , half-starved, and in the greatest distress. In this condition they met with a officer, who afforded them all that assistance which common humanity dictates on such occasions.

Her father and paternal grandfather held important positions at the imperial court, and many of her relatives and ancestors had high reputations for their literary abilities. Her real name does not survive. The name \"Nijō\" was given to her at the court: it was common practice at the time to designate court ladies by street names, and \"Nijō\" (\"Second Avenue\") designates a high rank. According to the \"Towazugatari\", Emperor Go-Fukakusa was in love with Nijō's mother, Sukedai. However, she died shortly after Nijō was born, and Go-Fukakusa turned his affections to Nijō. She was taken to the court at the age of four, and was subsequently raised there. In 1271, Nijō, aged 14, was given by her father to Go-Fukakusa as a concubine. It is unclear whether Nijō should be considered a formal wife (\"seisai\") or a concubine (\"meshudo\"): there is evidence in the \"Confessions\" to support both interpretations.\n\nNijō's life at the court was plagued by numerous troubles. Her father died when she was 15, and her relationship with the emperor was strained from the beginning, because she took several other lovers over the years, including one whom she knew before becoming a concubine. Matters were complicated further by Nijō's pregnancies: the only child she bore to Go-Fukakusa died in infancy, and the other three children she had were not by the emperor. Go-Fukakusa's consort, Higashi-nijō, was greatly displeased with Nijō's behaviour and Go-Fukakusa's apparent affinity for the concubine. Ultimately, it was due to Higashi-nijō's request that Nijō was expelled from the court in 1283.\n\nNijō's life after leaving the imperial court are revealed in Books 4 and 5 of \"Towazugatari\". Like many women in Medieval Japan whose lives met with unfortunate circumstances, Nijō became a Buddhist nun. She traveled to saсred and historical places, following the footsteps of the famous poet and priest, Saigyō, returning to the capital regularly. Kimura Saeko notes that some of these visits never actually took place, meaning that sections of Nijō's travels are fictionalised. Book 4 begins in 1289, skipping several years (thus leading scholars to believe that some material may be missing); Book 5 skips some more years and describes Nijō's grief at Go-Fukakusa's death in 1304. \"Towazugatari\" ends in 1306, and nothing is known about what happened to Nijō afterwards or when she died.\n\n\"Towazugatari\" was written c. 1307 and covers events of the period from 1271 to 1306.The work is considered one of the greatest works of Japanese literature, as well being a rare account of events not typically recorded in premodern Japanese literary works, such as sexual coercion.\n\nNijō's autobiography did not enjoy wide circulation, potentially due to later factionalism that split the imperial family or the fact that Nijō's portrayal of Emperor Go-Fukakusa was both intimate and humanising. A single 17th-century copy was discovered among the holdings of the Imperial Household in 1940 by Yamagishi Tokuhei, with several gaps in Book 5, noted by the scribe. The book was published in 1950, with a complete annotated edition following in 1966.

{"id": "2265118", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2265118", "title": "IAR 99", "text": "IAR 99\n\nThe IAR 99 Șoim (\"Hawk\") is an advanced trainer and light attack aircraft capable of performing close air support and reconnaissance missions. The IAR 99 replaced the Aero L-29 Delfin and Aero L-39 Albatros as jet trainer of the Romanian Air Force. The aircraft is of semi-monocoque design, with tapered wings and a swept back tail unit. A large blade-type antenna installed beneath the nose on the port side of the fuselage gives the IAR 99 trainer a distinctive appearance.\n\nThe design of the aircraft started in 1975 and this would be the first jet trainer fully designed and built in Romania. In 1979 funding was approved for building the first trainer by I.Av. Craiova where the IAR 93 attack aircraft was currently built. The prototype (S-001) flew on 21 December 1985 with Lt. Col. Vagner Ștefănel at the controls. S-002 served for static (ground) testing, S-003 being the second flying prototype (later re-serialled 7003). The aircraft entered series production in 1987, with 17 aircraft delivered to the Romanian Air Force by 1989. Two were lost in the 1990s (numbers 710 and 714). In 1990 the fall of the Eastern Bloc created new export opportunities for the aircraft, but while the aircraft had excellent aerodynamic and handling qualities, it was left behind in its class because of its obsolete avionics, with upgrading becoming a priority. The first upgrade attempt was made in 1990 by I.Av.Craiova together with the Texas-based Jaffe Aircraft Corporation. Two aircraft were modified by installing Honeywell avionics, while the canopy was changed to a two piece design instead of the original one piece. The aircraft were displayed at the 1990 Farnborough Airshow, being proposed for the Joint Primary Aircraft Training System program for the United States of America, although this work resulted in no orders.\n\nIn 1992 a new upgrade program was started in partnership with IAI Lahav of Israel, for both Romanian Air Force use and export. One aircraft (number 7003, the third prototype) was brought to the new IAR 109 \"Swift\" standard. It was equipped with HOTAS (Hands On Throttle and Stick) controls in both cockpits, a wideangle HUD (Head-Up Display) with Up Front Control Panel in the front cockpit, two 3 inch displays in both cockpits, a ring laser gyro Inertial Navigation System (INS), as well as the integration of both Eastern and Western weapon systems on the aircraft. The aircraft was displayed at the 1993 Paris Air Show. In 1994, however, this program also ground to a halt.\n\nIn 1996 the upgrade program of the IAR 99 was revived with the need for a lead-in trainer for the newly upgraded MiG-21 Lancer. The Israeli company Elbit was chosen as an integrator and the avionics package is compatible with 5th generation fighter systems and it is inspired from the MiG-21 Lancer upgrade but adapted to IAR 99 needs. The first upgraded IAR 99 was the 18th production aircraft (number 718), which performed its first flight on 22 May 1997. The upgraded IAR 99 was displayed at Paris in 1997 and Farnborough in 1998. On 6 August 1998, the Romanian Government approved the introduction into series production of the upgrade program for 24 IAR-99s out of which 4 were supposed to be delivered by 2001.\n\nLater the number was reduced to 12, only seven of which are to be new-built (numbers 719-725), and five upgraded from existing IAR-99 (numbers 709,711,712,713,717). Thus, RoAF will have 12 IAR-99C Soim (upgraded) and ten IAR-99 Standard, with 7003 and 718 probably remaining with Avioane Craiova SA as demonstrator aircraft.\n\nA modernized version of the IAR-99 called IAR-99 TD is currently being developed. A prototype is expected to be completed by 2022.\n\nThe aircraft has a tandem stepped dual control cockpit equipped with Martin-Baker Mk 10 zero-zero ejection seats. The instructor's seat at the rear position is raised by 35 cm to provide better visibility. The canopy was made as a single piece (prototypes and planes 701-707), later changed to a two-piece canopy, both opening to the starboard side.\n\nThe cockpit is equipped with HOTAS control. The cockpit is equipped with liquid crystal displays. Both the pilot and the instructor are equipped with an DASH Display and Sight Helmet which is currently deployed on the MiG 21 Lancer. The helmet slaves the onboard weapons systems to the pilot's line of sight. The visor's display confirms when target acquisition has been achieved. The visor also displays the data from the HUD. Flying and navigation data are displayed on HUD (Head-Up Display), on the helmet DASH and MFDC (color multifunction displays).\n\nElbit is supplying the aircraft's advanced avionics suite installed on a MIL-STD-1553B data bus. The advanced avionics suite, including communications, navigation, identification systems and the cockpit configuration, are similar to those of the MiG 21 Lancer and F-16 fighter aircraft. The IAR-99 is also equipped with video and debriefing systems.\n\nThe communication systems include VHF and UHF communications, voice-activated intercom and an IFF transponder. The flight systems include a VOR/ILS, linked VHF omnidirectional antenna radio ranger linked to the instrument landing system. Other navigation tools include distance measuring equipment (DME), an automatic direction finder (ADF), a Northrop Grumman inertial navigation system and a Trimble GPS system.\n\nOne of the best features of the aircraft avionics is a virtual training system which allows, based on a data link system, inflight simulations of firing and air combat capabilities using two or more aircraft.\n\nThe IAR 99's electronic warfare suite is based on the Elisra Electronic Systems radar warning receiver and electronic countermeasures pod plus a chaff and flare decoy dispenser. The systems are integrated through the 1553 data bus. The radar warning receiver detects pulse-Doppler, pulse and continuous wave radar threats and provides threat identification by comparing signal characteristics against a threat database.\n\n\n\n"}

The cathedral is Leicester Cathedral, where the Bishop of Leicester has his episcopal chair.\n\nThe diocese is divided into two archdeaconries, the Archdeaconry of Leicester in the east of the county and the Archdeaconry of Loughborough in the west. The former is divided into the rural deaneries of City of Leicester; Framland (Melton Mowbray); Gartree First and Second; and Goscote. The latter is divided into the rural deaneries of Akeley East, South and West; Guthlaxton; and Sparkenhoe East and West.\n\nThe diocese owns a retreat house at Launde Abbey near East Norton.\n\nThe Middle Angles first had a bishopric in 680 and the Anglo-Saxon cathedral was probably located close to (if not on the site of) the present cathedral. The original diocese fell victim to the invasion by the Danes around 870 and after the establishment of the Danelaw in 886 the diocese's seat was moved to Oxfordshire and, taking over the existing Diocese of Lindine (created in 678), became the Diocese of Dorchester. From Dorchester, Oxfordshire, the see was later moved to Lincoln in 1072 under King William I, the diocese then becoming the Diocese of Lincoln. Henry VIII divided the larger dioceses at the time of the English Reformation and the Diocese of Lincoln was divided in three. Leicestershire was included in the new Diocese of Peterborough. In 1539 a new cathedral \"was\" being erected, but it was never completed and Peterborough was chosen as the seat of the new diocese and Peterborough Abbey as the cathedral.\n\nIn the 19th century there were suffragan bishops of Leicester whilst the bishopric was still within the Diocese of Peterborough. The modern diocese was founded on 12 November 1926 from the archdeaconries of Leicester and Loughborough and part of the Archdeaconry of Northampton, all from the Diocese of Peterborough. St Martin's Church, Leicester, was elevated as the cathedral of the new see.\n\nThe diocesan Bishop of Leicester is assisted by the Bishop of Loughborough (the sole suffragan bishop, Guli Francis-Dehqani). Alternative episcopal oversight (for parishes in the diocese which reject the ministry of priests who are women) is provided by the provincial episcopal visitor, Norman Banks, Bishop suffragan of Richborough, who is licensed as an honorary assistant bishop of the diocese. There are currently two retired bishops living in the diocese who are licensed as honorary assistant bishops: Christopher Boyle, former Assistant Bishop of Leicester, and Peter Fox, former Bishop of Port Moresby.\n\n"}

The agreement was signed at the Washington Summit, on June 22, 1973. The United States and the U.S.S.R. agreed to reduce the threat of a nuclear war and establish a policy to restrain hostility.\n\nIn reality, the agreement had little impact, with Henry Kissinger doubting whether it was \"worth the effort\" and describing the outcome as only \"marginally useful\".\n\nThe agreement was initially presented to US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger on his 1972 visit to Moscow by the Soviets. Kissinger described the initial draft as \"a dangerous, Soviet maneuverer to lure us into renouncing the use of nuclear weapons, on which the free world's defence after all depended ... Given the Soviet superiority in conventional weapons, such a move would demoralise our allies and deeply disquiet China, who would see it as a sign of the much dreaded U.S.-Soviet collusion ... It was strong stuff. We were being asked to dismantle the military strategy of NATO and at the same time to proclaim a virtual U.S.-Soviet military alliance designed to isolate or impose our will on China or any other country with nuclear aspirations.\"\n\nWith the help of British diplomat Thomas Brimelow, Kissinger presented a counterproposal which he described as \"180 degrees removed from his (Brezhnev's) original design. In short, in over a year of negotiation we had transformed the original Soviet proposal of an unconditional renunciation of the use of nuclear weapons against each other into a somewhat banal statement that our objective was peace, applying as well to allies and third countries and premised on restrained international conduct, especially the avoidance of the use or the threat of force\".\n\nUnlike the original Soviet proposal, which Kissinger considered entirely unacceptable, the agreed text provided \"marginally useful\" accommodations to the United States, not specifically in the realm of preventing nuclear war but in Kissinger's specialist subject of geopolitical realpolitik: in his estimation it would make \"it impossible for the Soviets to turn on either NATO or the Middle East without violating the agreement. And it even gave us a kind of legal framework for resisting a Soviet attack on China.\" Nevertheless, Kissinger doubted whether the agreement was \"worth the effort.\"\n\nAGREEMENT BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND THE UNION OF SOVIET SOCIALIST REPUBLICS ON THE PREVENTION OF NUCLEAR WAR\n\nSigned at Washington June 22, 1973\nEntered into force June 22, 1973\n\nThe United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, hereinafter referred to as the Parties,\n\nGuided by the objectives of strengthening world peace and international security, Conscious that nuclear war would have devastating consequences for mankind, Proceeding from the desire to bring about conditions in which the danger of an outbreak of nuclear war anywhere in the world would be reduced and ultimately eliminated,\n\nProceeding from their obligations under the Charter of the United Nations regarding the maintenance of peace, refraining from the threat or use of force, and the avoidance of war, and in conformity with the agreements to which either Party has subscribed,\n\nProceeding from the Basic Principles of Relations between the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics signed in Moscow on May 29, 1972,\n\nReaffirming that the development of relations between the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics is not directed against other countries and their interests,\n\nHave agreed as follows:\n\nArticle I\n\nThe United States and the Soviet Union agree that an objective of their policies is to remove the danger of nuclear war and of the use of nuclear weapons.\n\nAccordingly, the Parties agree that they will act in such a manner as to prevent the development of situations capable of causing a dangerous exacerbation of their relations, as to avoid military confrontations, and as to exclude the outbreak of nuclear war between them and between either of the Parties and other countries.\n\nArticle II\n\nThe Parties agree, in accordance with Article I and to realize the objective stated in that Article, to proceed from the premise that each Party will refrain from the threat or use of force against the other Party, against the allies of the other Party and against other countries, in circumstances which may endanger international peace and security.

Over 245 insurance companies and provident societies were merged to create the state-owned Life Insurance Corporation of India.\n\nAs of 2019, Life Insurance Corporation of India had total life fund of ₹28.3 trillion. The total value of sold policies in the year 2018-19 is ₹21.4 million. Life Insurance Corporation of India settled 26 million claims in 2018–19. It has 290 million policy holders.\n\nThe Oriental Life Insurance Company, the first company in India offering life insurance coverage, was established in Kolkata in 1818. Its primary target market was the Europeans based in India, and it charged Indians heftier premiums. Surendranath Tagore had founded Hindustan Insurance Society, which later became Life Insurance Corporation.\n\nThe Bombay Mutual Life Assurance Society, formed in 1870, was the first native insurance provider. Other insurance companies established in the pre-independence era included\n\nThe first 150 years were marked mostly by turbulent economic conditions. It witnessed India's First War of Independence, adverse effects of the World War I and World War II on the economy of India, and in between them the period of worldwide economic crises triggered by the Great depression. The first half of the 20th century saw a heightened struggle for India's independence. The aggregate effect of these events led to a high rate of and liquidation of life insurance companies in India. This had adversely affected the faith of the general in the utility of obtaining life cover.\n\nIn 1955, parliamentarian Feroz Gandhi raised the matter of insurance fraud by owners of private insurance agencies. In the ensuing investigations, one of India's wealthiest businessmen, Ramkrishna Dalmia, owner of the \"Times of India\" newspaper, was sent to prison for two years.\n\nThe Parliament of India passed the Life Insurance of India Act on 19 June 1956 creating the Life Insurance Corporation of India, which started operating in September of that year. It consolidated the business of 245 private life insurers and other entities offering life insurance services; this consisted of 154 life insurance companies, 16 foreign companies and 75 provident companies. The nationalization of the life insurance business in India was a result of the Industrial Policy Resolution of 1956, which had created a policy framework for extending state control over at least 17 sectors of the economy, including life insurance.\n\nThe LIC's executive board consists of Chairman, currently M R Kumar, and Managing Directors, Vipin Anand, T. C. Suseel Kumar, Mukesh Kumar Gupta and Raj Kumar\n\nFrom its creation, the Life Insurance Corporation of India, which commanded a monopoly of soliciting and selling life insurance in India, created huge surpluses and by 2006 was contributing around 7% of India's GDP.\n\nThe corporation, which started its business with around 300 offices, 5.7 million policies and a corpus of INR 45.9 crores (US$92 million as per the 1959 exchange rate of roughly 5 for US$1), had grown to 25,000 servicing around 350 million policies and a corpus of over by the end of the 20th century.\n\nIn August 2000, the Indian Government embarked on a program to liberalise the insurance sector and opened it up for the private sector. LIC emerged as a beneficiary from this process with robust performance, albeit on a base substantially higher than the private sector.\n\nIn 2013 the first year premium compound annual growth rate (CAGR) was 24.53% while total life premium CAGR was 19.28% matching the growth of the life insurance industry and outperforming general economic growth.\n\nToday LIC functions with 2048 fully computerized branch offices, 8 zonal offices, around 113 divisional offices, 2,048 branches and 1408 satellite offices and the Central Office; it also has 54 customer zones and 25 metro-area service hubs located in different cities and towns of India. It also has a network of 1,537,064 individual agents, 342 Corporate Agents, 109 Referral Agents, 114 Brokers and 42 Banks for soliciting life insurance business from the public.\n\nNow LIC also has the 1899 branches of IDBI bank at its disposal thus it can carry out its insurance business through these branches of the bank.\n\nLIC's slogan \"yogakshemam vahamyaham\" is in Sanskrit which loosely translates into English as \"Your welfare is our responsibility\". This is derived from ancient Hindu text, the Bhagavad Gita's 9th chapter, 22nd. The slogan can be seen in the logo, written in Devanagari script.\nThis line means \"I carry what they lack, and I preserve what they have\" (refers to Krishna speaking to Arjuna), when taken in context of the entire verse.\n\n\nAs on 31 March 2018, LIC had 111,979 employees, out of which 24,510 were women.\n\nThe total number of Agents on our Roll is 11,48,811 as at 31.03.2018 as against 11,31,181 as on 31.03.2017. The number of Active Agents is 10,71,945 as at 31.03.2018 as compared to 10,46,484 as on 31.03.2017.\n\nGolden Jubilee Foundation<br>\nLIC Golden Jubilee Foundation was established in 2006 as a charity organization. This entity has the aim of promoting education, alleviation of poverty, and providing better living conditions for the under privileged. Out of all the activities conducted by the organisation, Golden Jubilee Scholarship awards is the best known. Each year, this award is given to the meritorious students in standard XII of school education or equivalent, who wish to continue their studies and have a parental income less than .\n\nLIC holds shares worth about ₹2.33 lakh crore in all the Nifty companies put together, but it lowered its holding in a total of 27 Nifty companies during the quarter.\n\nThe cumulative value of LIC holding in these 27 companies fell by little over ₹8,000 crore during the quarter shows the analysis of changes in their shareholding patterns.\n\nIndividually, LIC is estimated to have sold shares worth ₹500-1,000 crore in each of Mahindra & Mahindra, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, Tata Motors, L&T, HDFC, Wipro, SBI, Maruti Suzuki, Dr Reddys and Bajaj Auto.\n\nThe insurance behemoth also trimmed holdings in Ambuja Cements, Cipla, TCS, Lupin and Asian Paints. A marginal decline was also witnessed in its stakes in companies such as IDFC, Hindustan Unilever, Grasim, ACC, BPCL, Bank of Baroda, Punjab National Bank, Sun Pharma and Tata Power.\n\nOn the other hand, LIC further ramped up its stake in a total of 14 Nifty constituents with purchase of shares worth an estimated ₹4,000 crore.\n\nThe major companies where LIC has raised its stake include Infosys, RIL, Coal India Ltd and Cairn India. Other such companies are ITC, Power Grid Corp, NTPC, Siemens, Bharti Airtel and Hero MotoCorp.\n\nThe state-run insurer also marginally hiked its exposure in Ultratech, Gail India, Ranbaxy, Kotak Mahindra Bank and HCL Technologies, while its shareholding remained almost unchanged in companies like ONGC, Tata Steel, BHEL and Reliance Infra.\n\nAmong the Nifty companies, LIC's holding in terms of value in 2012 were estimated to be the highest in ITC (₹27,326 crore), followed by RIL (₹21,659 crore), ONGC (₹17,764 crore), SBI (₹17,058 crore), L&T (₹16,800 crore), and ICICI Bank (₹10,006 crore).\n\nThe share price drop in ITC on 18 July 2017 had caused LIC a major loss of around 7000 Crores.\n\nLIC now also holds 51% stake in IDBI bank thus making it the only insurer in India to own a bank, since regulations prohibit insurers from holding more than 15% stake in any company, LIC will have to decide a timeline for paring its stake in IDBI bank; also LIC will have to pare its stake in LIC Housing Finance Ltd as a company cannot be promoter of 2 finance companies carrying out same housing finance business so either LIC has to sell its stake in LIC housing or close down housing business of IDBI bank.\n\n"}

Syneresis has also been proposed as the mechanism of formation of the amorphous silicate composing the frustule of diatoms.\nIn the processing of dairy milk, for example during cheese making, syneresis is the formation of the curd due to the sudden removal of the hydrophilic macropeptides, which causes an imbalance in intermolecular forces. Bonds between hydrophobic sites start to develop and are enforced by calcium bonds which form as the water molecules in the micelles start to leave the structure. This process is usually referred to as the phase of coagulation and syneresis. The splitting of the bond between residues 105 and 106 in the κ-casein molecule is often called the primary phase of the rennet action, while the phase of coagulation and syneresis is referred to as the secondary phase.\n\nIn cooking, syneresis is the sudden release of moisture contained within protein molecules, usually caused by excessive heat, which over-hardens the protein shell. Moisture inside expands upon heating. The hard protein shell pops, expelling the moisture.\n\nThis process is what changes juicy rare steak to dry steak when well-done. It creates weeping in scrambled eggs, with dry protein curd swimming in released moisture. It causes emulsified sauces, such as hollandaise, to \"break\". It creates unsightly moisture pockets within baked custard dishes such as flan or crème brûlée.\n\nIn dentistry, syneresis is the expulsion of water or other liquid molecules from dental impression materials (alginate for example) after an impression has been taken. Due to this process, the impression shrinks a little and therefore its size is no longer accurate. For this reason, many dental impression companies strongly recommend to pour the dental cast as soon as possible to prevent distortion of the dimension of the teeth and objects in the impression.\n\nThe opposite process of syneresis is imbibition, meaning, a material that absorbs water molecules from the surrounding. Alginate is also an example of imbibition since if soaked in water, it will absorb it.\n\n"}
{"id": "2265148", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2265148", "title": "Without a Clue", "text": "Without a Clue\n\nWithout a Clue is a 1988 British comedy film directed by Thom Eberhardt and starring Michael Caine and Ben Kingsley. It is based on Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's characters from the Sherlock Holmes stories but in this version Sherlock Holmes is an actor hired by Doctor Watson to play the part of the brilliant detective, so that Watson can maintain his reputation as a doctor.\n\nSherlock Holmes is a fictional creation of Dr. John Watson who serves as the central character in a series of short stories published in \"The Strand Magazine\". Watson uses the character to enable him to solve crimes incognito, so as not to disrupt his career as a doctor. He therefore decides to satisfy public demand to see Holmes in person by hiring unemployed actor Reginald Kincaid to play the part of the hero of his detective stories. Kincaid must rely on direction from Watson, memorizing the doctor's exacting, detailed instructions every step of the way.\n\nAfter a major case, Kincaid oversteps his boundaries with Watson, who fires him. Watson wants to write the character off so as to start a new series about \"The Crime Doctor\", with Watson himself being recognized as the great detective, but the idea is received coldly. And with a new crime of arson at a paper warehouse to investigate, Watson finds that he is unable to get information on his own.\n\nThat crime then becomes a link in a major case when the British government seeks the aid of \"Holmes\" and will accept no one else. The mystery involves the theft of printing plates for £5 banknotes, with the printing supervisor, Peter Giles, having gone missing on the night of the robbery. The counterfeiting of these notes would cause the inevitable collapse of the British Empire's economy. Watson is therefore forced to retrieve \"Holmes\" from the pub to which he has retired.\n\nScotland Yard's Inspector Lestrade is jealous of \"Holmes\". Rather than relying on the regular police, therefore, Watson uses the twelve-year-old street urchin, Wiggins, the leader of a street gang that he calls \"Baker Street Irregulars\", to keep an eye on people and hunt out evidence. One line of enquiry leads Watson to the printer’s daughter Leslie, whom he and the womanising \"Holmes\" invite back to their quarters to recover from the shock of false evidence of her father’s death.\n\nWatson and “Holmes” discover that Professor Moriarty is the mastermind behind the scheme and disturb him on the docks while receiving a consignment of printing ink. Watson is apparently killed while tracking him, forcing “Holmes” to solve the case on his own. The trail takes him to an abandoned theatre where the forgeries are being printed. There he discovers that Watson is still alive after all and the two team up to defeat Moriarty for good. In the process Leslie is unmasked as an impostor and Moriarty’s spy.\n\nWhen they return to 221B Baker Street, “Holmes” announces to a reception committee of reporters that he is now retiring and gives full credit to the qualities of his partner Watson. For his part Watson assures the public that, far from this being so, the team of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. John Watson will continue their detective work from now on as friends.\n\n\nWritten by Gary Murphy and Larry Strawther, two devoted Sherlockians, the film originally had the working titles \"The Imposter of Baker Street\" and \"Sherlock and Me\". The script was filled with numerous Doyle references, some of which were excised from the final film to make it more accessible. A reference from the real world that survived, was the character of Norman Greenhough, based on Herbert Greenhough Smith, editor of \"The Strand Magazine\", whose faith in the Holmes/Watson characters brought fame and fortune to both writer and periodical.\n\nAt the time of its release, the film was poorly reviewed. On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 60% based on 10 reviews, with an average rating of 5.47/10. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade B+ on scale of A to F.\n\nRoger Ebert gave the film only two stars out of four on the grounds that the \"amusing premise\" that Holmes is in fact a third-rate actor hired by Watson to play the role is not enough to carry the film. This was echoed by \"The Monthly Film Bulletin\"s judgment that \"If this premise were to be workable, it would require the casting of an actor who could actually pass as the genuine Holmes. As it is, we are simply given a buffoon.\" Dave Kehr, writing for the \"Chicago Tribune\", agreed that a \"Sherlock Holmes movie can be many things, but stupid isn`t one of them. Still, there`s no other way to consider \"Without a Clue\", a mystery-comedy so klutzy that it tips one of its few surprises in the credit list.\"\n\nVincent Canby writing for \"The New York Times\" stated that \"Without A Clue\" was \"an appallingly witless sendup of the Sherlock Holmes–Dr. Watson stories\". \"Variety\" conceded that the film \"generates a few laughs and smiles, but of a markedly mild nature and most of them provoked by the shrewdly judged antics of the two stars.\" Harvey O'Brien thought the film seemed \"more like a television production\", although the choice of actors for the main characters convincingly addresses \"the artificiality of the Holmes mythos\" and \"presents a unique redemption of the Watson figure\".\n\nThe film won the 1989 Special Jury Prize at the Festival du Film Policier de Cognac.\n\n"}
{"id": "2265167", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2265167", "title": "Pays de Bray", "text": "Pays de Bray\n\nThe Pays de Bray is a small (about 750 km²) natural region of France situated to the north-east of Rouen, straddling the French departments of the Seine-Maritime and the Oise (historically divided among the Provinces of Normandy and Picardy since 911, now divided among the administrative regions of Upper Normandy and Picardy). The landscape is of bocage, a land use which arises from its clay soil, and is suited to the development of pasture for the raising of dairy cattle. It produces famous butters and cheeses such as Neufchâtel.\n\nEtymologically, the name of \"Bray\" comes from the Gaulish word \"braco\", which became the Old French \"Bray\", meaning marsh, swamp, or mud. The area appears to be so named as the soil distinguishes it from the neighbouring Pays de Caux; the sticky clay is quite different from the dry, firm chalk of the Pays de Caux.\n\nViewed geologically, the Pays de Bray is a relatively small eroded anticline along the Bray fault, breaking through rocks on the fringe of the Parisian Basin, which forms the chalk plateaus around it. It is a smaller version of the Weald of Kent and Sussex, but reveals the beds more deeply; down to the Upper Jurassic clay.\n\nTo the north is the Upper Cretaceous plateau of Picardy with the Pays de Caux to the west and the Vexin to the south-east. The erosion has exposed clay beds in an elliptically-shaped region which is called the \"buttonhole\" of the Pays de Bray. A \"boutonnière\" (buttonhole), in French geological language, is an eroded anticline. This is why the Pays de Bray's outline is shaped as a buttonhole, marked as it is with surrounding escarpments of 60 to 100 metres in height, making it a distinct physical and cultural entity.\n\nThe Pays de Bray is rich in springs and several watercourses rise there; notably the Epte and the Andelle, tributaries of the Seine. The Béthune and the Eaulne flow into the Arques which enters the English Channel at Dieppe. Among the most notable springs are those of Forges-les-Eaux (\"Forges-the-Waters\") which gave it and its surroundings the renown of a spa. As a result of its clay-rich soil, the traditional building style of the Pays de Bray is of cob (sometimes changed to brick since the 19th) and tile throughout, showing wattle and daub structures.\n\nThe Bray Fault is part of the Lizard front which is represented also in The Lizard and Start Point, Devon. It is also part of the anticline which lies to the south of the Isle of Wight. The chalk of that island's central ridge is cognate with that of the Pays de Bray's northern escarpment. The syncline to the north of the Isle of Wight underlies the Hampshire Basin and rises in the next anticline to form Salisbury Plain and the Wealden ridge of which the territory of Boulogne-sur-Mer, the Boulonnais is the equivalent feature in France. The syncline of south Hampshire is represented by the bay and département of Somme.\n\nFundamentally, the Bray fault dates from the late Carboniferous and Early Permian but the effect in France and England, of its associated earth movements, has quietly continued so as to gently fold the overlying Jurassic and Cretaceous strata.\n\nThe main towns of the Pays de Bray are Neufchâtel-en-Bray, Forges-les-Eaux and Gournay-en-Bray. It is primarily an agricultural region. Its \"brand\" products are its three AOC, Neufchâtel cheese, the cider spirit, Calvados and Normandy pommeau. The famous local speciality of fromage frais called petit Suisse was launched from a farm near Gournay-en-Bray; Charles Gervais set up his first factory at Ferrières-en-Bray and his second one at Neufchâtel-en-Bray (closed in 2009).\n\nThe Pays de Bray is served by several axial roads:\n\nThe rail network is reduced to two lines. The main one, electrified, joins Rouen-Rive-Droite to Amiens. The second was joining between gare de Paris-Saint-Lazare and Dieppe \"via\" Pontoise but is closed between Serqueux (where it meets the first one) and Dieppe\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2265184", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2265184", "title": "Islip, Oxfordshire", "text": "Islip, Oxfordshire\n\nIslip is a village and civil parish on the River Ray, just above its confluence with the River Cherwell in Oxfordshire, England. It is about east of Kidlington and about north of Oxford. The 2011 Census recorded the parish's population as 652.\n\nThe remains of a Romano-British villa have been found about half a mile (800 metres) southwest of the village.\n\nEdward the Confessor (born \"circa\" 1004, died 1066) was born in Islip and tradition holds that he was baptised in a church here. Parts of the present church date from about 1200. The chancel was rebuilt in 1780 and the church was restored in 1861. The church is Islip's only Grade I Listed Building. The belltower has a ring of eight bells. The Church of England parish is now part of the Benefice of the Ray Valley.\n\nA chapel associated with Edward the Confessor existed north of the church. The chapel was damaged in April 1645 in a military engagement in the English Civil War, and in the 1780s it was demolished.\n\nThe former rectory was built in 1689 for Robert South and enlarged in 1807 for William Vincent. It is one of several Grade II* Listed Buildings in Islip.\n\nThe Domesday Book of 1086 recorded a watermill at Islip. A mill operated in the village until 1947.\n\nWhen the Domesday Book was compiled, Islip's common fields system was on the north side of the River Ray. At some time before 1300, Islip's villagers assarted (cleared) about of uncultivated land south of the River Ray and east of the River Cherwell and divided it into strips as a new common field for strip farming. In the 1970s this area of farmland was called Sart Field.\n\nThe Black Death in the 14th century led to the end of week-work in the parish. This was unpaid work that peasants had to do for the Lord of the Manor, and the number of days per week that the manor could ask was fixed. This system had been reinstated by the harvest of 1357 and was probably stopped in Islip in 1386.\n\nSir William Fermor was Steward of the Manor of Islip in March 1540. His brother Richard Fermor was a wool merchant. The Fermor family had its seat at Somerton, Oxfordshire and had a number of estates in the northern part of the county.\n\nThe medieval road linking London and Worcester crossed the Ray at Islip. The original crossing was a ford but was later supplemented by a bridge.\n\nIn the 1640s the bridge and Islip's nearness to Oxford made the village a strategic objective for both sides in the English Civil War. Early in the war, Islip was a strategic outpost for the Royalist capital at Oxford. In May 1644 a force under the Parliamentarian Earl of Essex occupied Islip but early in 1645 a Royalist force under the Earl of Northampton retook it. In April 1645 a force under Oliver Cromwell retook the village and routed the Earl of Northampton's men in an engagement on Islip Bridge. On 4 July 1645 the Parliamentarian Lord Fairfax had his men demolish the bridge, which was described as having been \"new-built\". Then in 1646 during the Third Siege of Oxford a force under the Parliamentarian Colonel George Fleetwood occupied the village.\n\nAfter the war the bridge was rebuilt or replaced, and John Ogilby's \"Britannia Atlas\" of 1675 describes it as having six arches. Until the 18th century the ford remained the main crossing except in winter. In that century the road between London and Worcester became a coaching route and Islip developed as a staging post. Islip was on the winter route between Oxford and Buckingham when Gosford Bridge was impassable.\n\nA number of houses in the village bear the names of its numerous coaching inns. The Plume of Feathers, also called the Prince's Arms, was built around 1780 reputedly from materials from the demolished Confessor's Chapel. It has since been demolished. The King's Head, also called the Coach And Horses, was built in the 17th century and became a private house in about 1976. There were inns called the Boot, the Britannia, the Fox and Grapes and the Saddlers Arms. The Saddlers Arms was still trading in 1949 but has since closed. Some of the Westminster Prebends met their tenants at the Red Lion.\n\nIn 1788 the bridge was turnpiked and the turnpike trustees closed the ford. The Dean and Chapter of Westminster Abbey, who were responsible for the bridge's upkeep, objected to the increased traffic and wear on the bridge. In 1816 they tried and failed to pass responsibility for these repairs to either the turnpike trustees or the county. In 1815 Parliament passed the Otmoor Enclosure Act, which after violent local objection led to the partial drainage of Otmoor. The increased flow of the River Ray scoured the river bed and undermined the bridge. Otmoor Drainage Commissioners denied liability but paid for the repair of two of its arches. An engraving published by John Dunkin in 1823 shows the bridge as having four arches. In 1878 the Thames Valley Drainage Commission widened the river and replaced the bridge with a one of three arches.\n\nVillagers in the \"seven towns\" of Otmoor resisted the proposed enclosure and drainage of Otmoor. Unrest came to a head in 1830–31, and the Oxfordshire Militia and the Buckinghamshire Yeomanry were deployed to quell it. The militia was joined by a company of Coldstream Guards that had marched from London on 30 July 1831 and was billeted in the village.\nIn 1850 the Buckinghamshire Railway completed its line from through Islip parish to , and opened Islip railway station to serve the village. British Railways withdrew passenger services from the line in 1967 and Islip station was demolished. Oxfordshire County Council and Network SouthEast reinstated passenger trains between Oxford and in 1987 and opened a new station in 1989. The line and Islip station were closed for upgrading under Chiltern Railways' Evergreen 3 project and reopened on 26 October 2015. Trains between London Marylebone and serve Islip. When the East West Rail is completed, trains between Oxford and Milton Keynes Central will also pass through Islip.\n\nIn 1704 the Rector, Robert South, founded a trust for apprenticing two children from the parish each year, and in 1709 he enlarged and endowed the trust to create a school for poor boys of the parish. A school building was completed in 1710, and in 1712 South finalised the size of the school at not less than 15 and not more than 21 pupils. The school issued each boy with a uniform of a blue coat and a blue cap.\n\nIn 1812 the number of pupils was increased and in 1815 there were between 90 and 100 boys at the school. By then Dr South's school was following the national school system. By 1833 the number of pupils had fallen to 75 but girls were also admitted. By 1856 a separate infants' school had been added, but later in the 19th century this was absorbed as the infants' department of Dr South's school. In 1893 a new school building was completed to replace the original 1710 premises. The combined total of infants and older pupils was 102 in 1889 and 100 in 1906.\n\nDr South's was reorganised as a junior school, with secondary age pupils transferred to Kidlington Church of England Central School at Gosford. This left Dr South's with only 34 pupils by 1937. In 1950 Dr South's became a voluntary aided school. In 1954 Dr South's had 84 pupils; it now has modern 20th century premises.\n\nA mummers play, dating from 1780, has been linked to Islip. Mummery continued in Islip until at least 1894 with a play depicting a girl called Molly who fell ill with toothache only to find, on extraction, that a nail was causing her the pain. There is another play featuring Fat Jack, a comic servant.\n\nThe Shakespearean scholar and collector of English nursery rhymes and fairy tales James Orchard Halliwell-Phillipps lived in Islip in the 1840s.\n\nEarly in the 1920s Robert Graves and Nancy Nicholson lived here, and Graves describes their life in the village in \"Goodbye to All That\". In 2014 the Oxfordshire Blue Plaques Board unveiled a blue plaque to Graves on the house that he and Nicholson shared in Collice Street.\n\nA village resident, Paul O'Connor, made a 30-minute video documentary about the history of Islip. Called \"The Village\" and presented by Jojo Tobitt of Laneside house, the video was premiered in Islip village hall in 2002 and broadcast via Undercurrents, an Oxford production company.\n\nThe rock band the Candyskins had its origins in Islip in the late 1970s and 1980s.\n\nIslip has two public houses: The Red Lion and The Swan. It has also a community shop and a village hall.\n\nCharlton-on-Otmoor Services bus route 94 provides Islip and neighbouring villages with a Monday to Saturday service between Bicester and Oxford \"via\" Arncott and Gosford.\n\n\nThis area has a maritime temperate climate (\"\"Cfb\"\" by the Köppen system). Precipitation is uniformly distributed throughout the year and is provided mostly by weather systems that arrive from the Atlantic. The lowest temperature ever recorded was in January 1982. The highest temperature ever recorded in Oxford is in August 2003 during the 2003 European heat wave.\n\nThe average conditions below are from the Radcliffe Meteorological Station. It has the longest series of temperature and rainfall records for one site in Britain. These records are continuous from January 1815. Irregular observations of rainfall, cloud and temperature exist from 1767.\n\n"}

{"id": "2265201", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2265201", "title": "Easter Lily (badge)", "text": "Easter Lily (badge)\n\nThe Easter Lily () is a badge in the shape of a calla lily flower, worn at Easter by Irish republicans as symbol of remembrance for Irish republican combatants who died during or were executed after the 1916 Easter Rising. Depending on the political affiliations of the bearer, it can also commemorate members of the pre-Treaty Irish Republican Army, the post-Treaty Irish Republican Army, and either the Provisional IRA or the Official IRA. It may also be used to commemorate members of the Irish National Liberation Army.\n\nThe Easter Lily was introduced in 1926 by Cumann na mBan. Proceeds from the sale of the badge went to the Irish Republican Prisoners' Dependants Fund. Traditionally, they were sold outside church gates on Easter Sunday and worn at republican commemorations. In the early years of their existence, people from a broad political spectrum – from Fianna Fáil to Sinn Féin – wore lilies, which were sold by members of those political parties as well as the Irish Republican Army (IRA), Fianna Éireann, and Conradh na Gaeilge.\n\nIn the 1930s, relations between Fianna Fáil and the IRA deteriorated considerably. Following the murder by the IRA of Richard More O'Ferrall in February 1935, the Fianna Fáil leadership instructed party members to stop selling the lily as it was \"the symbol of an organisation of whose methods we disapprove\". For its Easter commemorations that same year, Fianna Fáil introduced a new symbol called the Easter Torch. This was sold for a number of years but was discontinued as the badge proved unpopular with the party grass roots, many of whom continued to wear the Easter Lily.\n\nSince the 1930s, successive Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael governments have attempted to suppress sales of the Easter Lily according to \"An Phoblacht\", Sinn Féin's national newspaper.\n\nAt the 1967 Sinn Féin Ard Fheis a motion from the Tipperary Cummain calling for the Easter Lily to be supplied with a self-adhesive backing was passed. After the 1969/70 IRA split, which led to the emergence of the Provisional IRA, the Official IRA and Official Sinn Féin kept the Easter Lily with a self-adhesive backing while the Provisional's reverted to the traditional paper and pin Easter Lily. This led to the members of the Official IRA and Official Sinn Féin being referred to pejoratively as the \"Stickies\". On the other hand, the Provisionals became known as the \"Pinheads\", a nickname which has not lasted.\n\nBoth the Officials and the Provisionals also saw the Easter Lily as a symbol of remembrance for their members who died on \"active service\". With the decline in the Official IRA, the Easter Lily became more and more associated with the Provisionals.\n\nIn the 1990s, metal versions of the Lily became popular and are worn by some at any time of the year. Their sales and usage has increased with the rise in electoral support of Sinn Féin.\n\nCumann na mBan continue the sale of the Easter Lily from their headquarters on 223 Parnell Street.

{"id": "2265202", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2265202", "title": "The Peckham Experiment", "text": "The Peckham Experiment\n\nThe Peckham Experiment was an experiment designed to determine whether people as a whole would, given the opportunity, take a vested interest in their own health and fitness and expend effort to maintain it. The experiment took place between 1926 and 1950, initially generated by rising public concern over the health of the working class and an increasing interest in preventive social medicine.\n\nGeorge Scott Williamson (1884–1953) and Innes Hope Pearse (1889–1978), two doctors who later married, opened the Pioneer Health Centre in a house in Queen's Road SE5 in 1926, choosing Peckham, in south east London, because \"this populace roughly represents a cross-section of the total populace of the nation with as widely differing a cultural admixture as it is possible to find in any circumscribed metropolitan area\" –. Their aim was to study health as a medical condition in a manner comparable to studies of the natural history of disease. The first phase closed in 1929. The findings were disseminated, and funding was then sought to build a larger, purpose-designed, centre. This re-opened in 1935 in a purpose-built Modern building in St Mary's Road, often quoted as an early example of how new architectural techniques could help further bold new social experiments.\n\nThe new building, designed by Sir Owen Williams was described in detail in the \"Bulletin of the Pioneer Health Centre\", 1949. It moved away from the traditional lines dominating medical buildings. Williams created a large open space using the latest structural techniques allowing the Centre's doctors to properly observe the members. At the middle of the Centre a large swimming pool was covered by a glazed roof, which, along with large areas of windows, allowed natural light into the building. These windows could be fully opened to circulate fresh air into the building. The cork floors allowed people to move about barefoot.\n\nWilliamson and Pearse recruited 950 local families to be part of \"The Peckham Experiment\". Paying one shilling (equivalent to 5 pounds today) a week, they had access to a range of activities such as physical exercise, swimming, games and workshops. Members underwent a medical examination once a year, and they were monitored throughout the year as they participated in the Centre's events. Central to Scott Williamson's philosophy was the belief that left to themselves people would spontaneously begin to organise in a creative way, and this happened, the members initiating a wide range of sporting, social and cultural activities using the facilities offered by the Centre.\n\nThe Centre went into abeyance during the Second World War, but was restored to a condition fit for re-opening by the members themselves.\nEdwina Mountbatten was a governor in 1949.\nIn 1950, however, it finally closed, since its innovative approach did not fit well with the new National Health Service, and it proved impossible to obtain adequate funding from other sources to keep it going as an independent concern. As noted by Duncan (1985),\n\n“In many ways, both the wellness movement and the family practice movement were foreshadowed by their family-centered approach and their finding that most apparently well individuals actually suffered from some detectable disorder.”\nThe buildings were later transferred to Southwark Council. The Council operated a leisure centre in the buildings (including the swimming pool), and they also provided educational facilities as part of the Southwark Adult Education Institute.\n\nWilliamson, Pearse and some others involved in the Experiment were supporters of organic farming, and they became involved with the Soil Association in 1946.\n\nWriting in the 1960s the sociologist Prof Peter Townsend reflected that 'as a boy I knew one of the doctors involved in the Peckham health Centre and had always been inspired by its ideals'\n\nIn the 1990s the remaining buildings were sold by the Council and converted into housing, but remain a Listed Building. This occurred after the responsibility for adult education was significantly reduced and transferred from the local council to Southwark College. Replacement leisure facilities were provided at the Peckham Pulse Healthy Living Centre by Peckham Town Square.\n\nThe Pioneer Health Foundation, the charity responsible for the Peckham Experiment continues to exist as a registered charity under English law, the Trustees recognising a need to disseminate the findings and also to keep open the possibility of a further centre or centres opening. Notwithstanding the many changes to society and medicine since the Peckham Experiment, The Pioneer Health Foundation Ltd, as it is now known, believes that the principles identified by Dr George Scott Williamson are basic to health and are of continuing relevance to society. This includes the valuable evidence produced about the relationship between social and home environment and individual motivation and health.\n\nAs part of its activities, the Foundation has launched the \"Mary Langman Prize\", an annual award for an essay on \"The Relevance of the Peckham Experiment in the 21st Century\" that furthers the lessons learnt at the Pioneer Health Centre about the social, emotional and environmental determinants of health. Mary Langman was personal assistant to Scott Williamson and made a bequest to enable such initiatives.\n\nThe Peckham Experiment is referred to in the classic science fiction novel \"Macroscope\" by Piers Anthony, wherein an extension of the Peckham Experiment techniques are used to raise a group of children to far-above-average intelligence, resulting in one transcendental genius. It is also mentioned in \"Notes Toward the Definition of Culture\", by T. S. Eliot during his discussion on education and the family.\n\nThe surviving archives of the Pioneer Health Centre, which include personal papers of Scott Williamson and Innes Pearse, as well as material on subsequent attempts to recreate the experiment elsewhere, are now in the Wellcome Library. There are also numerous books published during and after the Centre's lifespan by individuals who were involved in its work. \n\n\n\n"}

It has four different programs (Radio Belgrade 1, Radio Belgrade 2, Radio Belgrade 3, and Radio Belgrade 202), a precious archive of several hundreds of thousands records, magnetic tapes and CDs, and is part of Radio Television of Serbia.\n\nThe predecessor of Radio Beograd, \"Radio Beograd-Rakovica\", started its program in 1924 and was a part of a state wireless telegraph station. \"Radio Beograd, AD\" started in March 1929. Its program consists of music, news, radio-drama, broadcasting from theaters, etc.\n\nRadio Beograd stopped broadcasting on April 6, 1941, when bombed during the German air raid of Belgrade, (Operation Punishment). After the occupation of Belgrade, Radio Belgrade became the German forces' radio station under the name of \"Soldatensender Belgrad\" (Soldiers Radio Belgrad) on the same frequency. It could be received throughout Europe and the Mediterranean. A lieutenant working at the station who was taking leave in Vienna was asked to collect some records to broadcast. Amongst a pile he obtained from a second hand shop was the little-known two-year-old song Lili Marleen sung by Lale Andersen, which up to then had sold only around 700 copies. Karl-Heinz Reintgen, the German officer in charge of station, began playing the song on the air. Due to their limited collection of records at the time the song was played frequently.\n\nAfter the Nazi government then ordered it to stop broadcasting the song, Radio Belgrade received many letters from Axis soldiers all over Europe asking them to play Lili Marleen again. In response, Radio Belgrade returned the song to its programming. From then on, the station played Andersen's recording every evening at 9:55 PM and its popularity continued to grow. Soldiers stationed around the Mediterranean, including both German Afrika Korps and British Eighth Army troops, regularly tuned in to hear it. Even Erwin Rommel, the commander of the Afrika Korps admired the song. He asked Radio Belgrade to incorporate the song into their daily broadcasts, which they did.\n\nAfter Josip Broz Tito's Partisans seized power in 1944, a new Radio Belgrade, this time under Communist control, continued its operation and gradually became the most influential broadcast medium in Serbia and the former Yugoslavia.\n\nNowadays, Radio Beograd is transformed into a public service broadcaster.\n\n"}

{"id": "2265239", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2265239", "title": "Periodontology", "text": "Periodontology\n\nPeriodontology or periodontics (from Ancient Greek , – 'around'; and , – 'tooth', genitive , ) is the specialty of dentistry that studies supporting structures of teeth, as well as diseases and conditions that affect them. The supporting tissues are known as the periodontium, which includes the gingiva (gums), alveolar bone, cementum, and the periodontal ligament. A periodontist is a dentist that specializes in the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of periodontal disease and in the placement of dental implants.\n\nThe term periodontium is used to describe the group of structures that directly surround, support and protect the teeth. The periodontium is composed largely of the gingival tissue and the supporting bone.\n\nNormal gingiva may range in color from light coral ink to heavily pigmented. The soft tissues and connective fibres that cover and protect the underlying cementum, periodontal ligament and alveolar bone are known as the gingivae. The gingivae are categorised into three anatomical groups; the free, attached and the interdental gingiva. Each of the gingival groups are considered biologically different; however, they are all specifically designed to help protect against mechanical and bacterial destruction.\n\nThe tissues that sit above the alveolar bone crest are considered the free gingiva. In healthy periodontium, the gingival margin is the fibrous tissue that encompasses the cemento-enamel junction, a line around the circumference of the tooth where the enamel surface of the crown meets the outer cementum layer of the root. A natural space called the gingival sulcus lies apically to the gingival margin, between the tooth and the free gingiva. A non-diseased, healthy gingival sulcus is typically 0.5-3mm in depth, however, this measurement can increase in the presence of periodontal disease. The gingival sulcus is lined by a non-keratinised layer called the oral sulcular epithelium; it begins at the gingival margin and ends at the base of the sulcus where the junctional epithelium and attached gingiva begins.\n\nThe junctional epithelium is a collar-like band that lies at the base of the gingival sulcus and surround the tooth; it demarcates the areas of separation between the free and attached gingiva. The junctional epithelium provides a specialised protective barrier to microorganisms residing around the gingival sulcus. Collagen fibres bind the attached gingiva tightly to the underlying periodontium including the cementum and alveolar bone and varies in length and width, depending on the location in the oral cavity and on the individual., The attached gingiva lies between the free gingival line or groove and the mucogingival junction. The attached gingiva dissipates functional and masticatory stresses placed on the gingival tissues during common activities such as mastication, tooth brushing and speaking. In health it is typically pale pink or coral pink in colour and may present with surface stippling or racial pigmentation.\n\nThe interdental gingiva takes up the space beneath a tooth contact point, between two adjacent teeth. It is normally triangular or pyramidal in shape and is formed by two interdental papillae (lingual and facial). The middle or centre part of the interdental papilla is made up of attached gingiva, whereas the borders and tip are formed by the free gingiva. The central point between the interdental papillae is called the col. It is a valley-like or concave depression that lies directly beneath the contact point, between the facial and lingual papilla. However, the col may be absent if there is gingival recession or if the teeth are not contacting. The main purpose of the interdental gingiva is to prevent food impaction during routine mastication.\n\nThis area of tissue is non keratinized and is located beyond the mucogingival junction. It is less firmly attached and is redder than attached gingiva. It provides for the movement of cheek and lips.\n\nThe periodontal ligament is the connective tissue that joins the outer layer of the tooth root, being the cementum, to the surrounding alveolar bone. It is composed of several complex fibre groups that run in different directions and which insert into the cementum and bone via ‘Sharpey’s fibres’. The periodontal ligament is composed mostly of collagen fibres, however it also houses blood vessels and nerves within loose connective tissue. Mechanical loads that are placed on the teeth during mastication and other external forces are absorbed by the periodontal ligament, which therefore protects the teeth within their sockets.\n\nIn periodontal health, the alveolar bone surrounds the teeth and forms the bony socket that supports each tooth. The buccal and lingual plates and lining of the sockets are composed of thin, yet dense compact or cortical bone. Within the cortical plates and dental sockets lies cancellous bone, a spongy or trabecular type bone which is less dense than compact bone.\n\nCementum is the outer layer of the tooth root; it overlies the dentine layer of the tooth and provides attachment for the collagen fibres of the periodontal ligament. It also protects the dentine and provides a seal for the otherwise exposed ends of the dentinal tubules. It is not as hard as enamel or dentine and is typically a light yellow colour.\n\nGingivitis is a common condition that affects the gingiva or mucosal tissues that surround the teeth. The condition is a form of periodontal disease; however, it is the least devastating, in that it does not involve irreversible damage or changes to the periodontium (gingiva, periodontal ligament, cementum or alveolar bone). It is commonly detected by patients when gingival bleeding occurs spontaneously during brushing or eating. It is also characterised by generalised inflammation, swelling, and redness of the mucosal tissues. Gingivitis is typically painless and is most commonly a result of plaque biofilm accumulation, in association with reduced or poor oral hygiene. Other factors may increase a person's risk of gingivitis, including but not limited to systemic conditions such as uncontrolled diabetes mellitus and some medications. The signs and symptoms of gingivitis can be reversed through improved oral hygiene measures and increase plaque disruption. If left untreated, gingivitis has the potential to progress to periodontitis and other related diseases that are more detrimental to periodontal and general health.\n\nPeriodontal disease encompasses a number of diseases of the periodontal tissues that result in attachment loss and destruction of alveolar bone.\n\nPeriodontal diseases take on many different forms but are usually a result of a coalescence of bacterial plaque biofilm accumulation of the red complex bacteria (e.g., P. gingivalis, T. forsythia, and T. denticola) of the gingiva and teeth, combined with host immuno-inflammatory mechanisms and other risk factors that can lead to destruction of the supporting bone around natural teeth. Untreated, these diseases can lead to alveolar bone loss and tooth loss. , Periodontal disease accounted for 70.8% of teeth lost in patients with the disease in South Korea. Periodontal disease is the second most common cause of tooth loss (second to dental caries) in Scotland. Twice daily brushing and flossing are a way to help prevent periodontal diseases.\n\nHealthy gingiva can be described as stippled, pale or coral pink in Caucasian people, with various degrees of pigmentation in other races. The gingival margin is located at the cemento-enamel junction without the presence of pathology. The gingival pocket between the tooth and the gingival should be no deeper than 1-3mm to be considered healthy. There is also the absence of bleeding on gentle probing.\n\nPeriodontal diseases can be caused by a variety of factors, the most prominent being dental plaque. Dental plaque forms a bacterial biofilm on the tooth surface, if not adequately removed from the tooth surface in close proximity to the gingiva a host-microbial interaction gets underway. This results in the imbalance between host and bacterial factors which can in turn result in a change from health to disease. Other local and/or systemic factors can result or further progress the manifestation of periodontal disease. Other factors can include age, socio-economic status, oral hygiene education and diet. Systemic factors may include uncontrolled diabetes or tobacco smoking.\n\nSigns and symptoms of periodontal disease: bleeding gums, gingival recession, halitosis (bad breath), mobile teeth, ill fitting dentures and build up of plaque and calculus\n\nIndividual risk factors include: Gender, smoking and alcohol consumption, diabetes, obesity and metabolic syndrome, osteoporosis and Vitamin D conditions, stress and genetic factors.\n\nIn 1999 the American Academy of Periodontology (AAP) reworked the existing classification of periodontal diseases from 1989 to alter the weaknesses present. The old classification placed too much emphasis on the age of disease onset and rate of progression, which are often difficult to determine. The 1999 classification was published in the Annals of Periodontology. Below is the abbreviated version of the 1999 classification of periodontal diseases and conditions.\n\nI. Gingival Diseases\nA. Dental plaque-induced gingival diseases\nB. Non-plaque-induced gingival lesions\nII. Chronic Periodontitis\n(slight: 1–2 mm CAL; moderate: 3–4 mm CAL;\nsevere: > 5 mm CAL)\nA. Localised\nB.

Generalised (> 30% of sites are involved)\nIV. Periodontitis as a Manifestation of Systemic Diseases\nA. Associated with haematological disorders\nB. Associated with genetic disorders\nC.

Mucogingival deformities and conditions around teeth\nC. Mucogingival deformities and conditions on edentulous\nridges\nD. Occlusal trauma\n\nIn 2018 a new classification of periodontal disease was announced. It was determined that the previous AAP 1999 classification did not cater for the needs of patients with peri-implant diseases and conditions. The new classification of periodontal and peri-implant diseases and conditions is as follows.\n\nPeriodontal Health, Gingival Diseases and Conditions:\nPeriodontal Health and Gingival Health\nGingivitis: Dental-Biofilm Induced\nGingival Diseases: Non-Dental Biofilm-Induced\nPeriodontitis:\nNecrotizing Periodontal Diseases\nPeriodontitis\nPeriodontitis as a Manifestation of Systemic Disease\nOther Conditions Affecting The Periodontium:\nSystemic Diseases or conditions affecting the periodontal supporting tissues\nPeriodontal Abscesses and Endodontic-Periodontal Lesions\nMucogingival Deformities and Conditions\nTraumatic Occlusal Forces\nTooth and Prosthesis Related Factors\nPeri-Implant Diseases and Conditions:\nPeri-Implant Health\nPeri-Implant Mucositis\nPeri-Implantitis\nPeri-Implant Soft and Hard Tissue Deficiencies\nPrevention:\nThe most effective prevention method is what can be achieved by the patient at home, for example, using the correct tooth brushing technique, interdental cleaning aids such as interdental brushes or floss and using a fluoridated toothpaste. It is also advised that patients receive bi annual check ups from their dental health provider along with thorough cleaning. \n\nTreatment:\nAlong with specialist periodontist treatment, a general dentist or oral health therapist/dental hygienist can perform routine scale and cleans using either hand instruments or an ultrasonic scaler (or a combination of both). The practitioner can also prescribe specialised plaque removal techniques (tooth brushing, interdental cleaning). The practitioner can also perform a plaque index to indicate to the patient areas of plaque they are not removing on their own. This can be removed through the procedure of a dental prophylaxis.\n\nPeriodontology also involves the placement and maintenance of dental implants, including the treatment of peri-implantitis (inflammatory bone loss around dental implants). The etiology of peri-implantitis is thought to be very similar to periodontal disease.\n\nThe primary etiological factor for periodontal disease is plaque biofilm of dental biofilm. A dental biofilm is a community of microorganisms attached to a hard, non shedding surfaces. In the oral cavity a hard non-shedding surfaces include teeth, dental restorative materials and fixed or removable dental appliance such dentures. It is this adherence to non-shedding surface that allows bacteria in a dental biofilm to have unique characteristics of clinical significance. \nThe stages of biofilm formation: \n\nBacteria contained within the biofilm are protected by an slimy extracellular polysaccharide matrix which helps to protect them from the outside environment and chemotherapeutics agents. An example of a chemotherapeutic agent is an antiseptic such as Chlorhexidine mouth-rinse or antibiotics. Thus, antibiotics are not generally used in the treatment of periodontal disease unlike other bacterial infections around the body. The most effective way to control the plaque biofilm is via mechanical removal such as toothbrushing, interdental cleaning or periodontal debridement performed by a dental professional.\n\nAn individual's host response plays an important role in the pathogenesis of periodontal disease. Even in a mouth where the gingiva appear healthy there is constant low level inflammatory response facilitated by the host to manage the constant bacterial load of plaque micro-organisms. Leukocytes and Neutrophils are the main cells that phagocytose bacteria found in the gingival crevice or pocket. They migrate from the tissues in a specialised exudate called gingival crevicular fluid also known as GCF. Neutrophils are recruited to the gingival crevice area as they are signalled to by molecules released by plaque microorganisms. Damage to epithelial cells releases cytokines which attract leukocytes to assist with the inflammatory response. The balance between normal cell responses and the beginning of gingival disease is when there is too much plaque bacteria for the neutrophils to phagocytose and they degranulate releasing toxic enzymes that cause tissue damage. This appears in the mouth as red, swollen and inflamed gingiva which may be bleeding when probed clinically or during tooth brushing. These changes are due to increased capillary permeability and an influx of inflammatory cells into the gingival tissues. When gingival disease remain established and the aetiology is not removed there is further recruitment of cells such as macrophages which assist with the phagocytic digestion of bacteria and lymphocytes which begin to initiate an immune response. Pro-inflammatory cytokines are produced inside the gingival tissues and further escalate inflammation which impacts the progression of chronic systemic inflammation and disease. The result is collagen breakdown, infiltrate accumulation as well as collagen breakdown in the periodontal ligament and alveolar bone resorption. At this stage, the disease has progressed from gingivitis to periodontitis and the loss of supporting periodontium structure is irreversible.\n\nA risk factor is a variable that in health, can be defined as \"a characteristic associated with an increased rate of a subsequently occurring disease\".\nRisk factors are variables that contribute to disease, rather than being factors that induce disease. Risk factors may be seen as modifiable and non-modifiable. Modifiable risk factors are often behavioural in nature and can be changed by the individual or environmental circumstances, whereas non-modifiable are usually intrinsic to an individuals genetics and cannot be changed. To determine risk factors for a disease, evidence based research and studies are needed for evidence, with longitudinal studies giving the most statistically significant outcomes and the best reliability for determining risk factors. Risk factors often coexist with other variables, rarely acting alone to contribute to a disease. Risk factors can be genetic, environmental, behavioural, psychological, and demographic in nature.\n\nThere are many risk factors that contribute to placing an individual at higher risk for developing gingival and periodontal diseases. However, the only aetiological factor for periodontal disease is bacterial plaque, or biofilm. Identifications of ones risk factors play an important role in the diagnosis, treatment and management of periodontal diseases. It was previously believed that each human being had the same risk of developing periodontal diseases, but through the identification and classification of risk factors, it has become well understood that each individual will have a differing array of risk factors that generate susceptibility and contribute to severity of periodontal disease.\n\nIndividual, modifiable risk factors include:\n\nNon-modifiable risk factors include:\n\nRisk characteristics must be considered in conjunction with risk factors as variables that may also contribute to increasing or decreasing ones chances of developing periodontal disease. Numerous studies show that Age, Gender, Race, Socioeconomic status, Education and Genetics also have strong relationships on influencing periodontal disease.\n\nPeriodontal disease is multifactorial, requiring dental and oral health professionals to have a clear and thorough understanding of the risk factors and their mechanisms in order to implement effective disease management in clinical practice.\n\nPeriodontitis and associated conditions are recognised as a wide range of inflammatory diseases that have unique symptoms and varying consequences. In order to identify disease, classification systems have been used to categorise periodontal and gingival diseases based on their severity, aetiology and treatments. Having a system of classification is necessary to enable dental professionals to give a label to a patient's condition and make a \"periodontal diagnosis.\" A diagnosis is reached by firstly undertaking thorough examination of the patient's medical, dental and social histories, to note any predisposing risk factors (see above) or underlying systemic conditions. Then, this is combined with findings from a thorough intra and extra oral examination. Indices such as periodontal screening record (PSR) and the Community Periodontal Index of Treatment Needs (CPITN) are also used in making a diagnosis and to order or classify the severity of disease.\n\nIf disease is identified through this process, then a full periodontal analysis is performed, often by dental hygienists, oral health therapists or specialist periodontists. This involves full mouth periodontal probing and taking measurements of pocket depths, clinical attachment loss and recession. Along with this other relevant parameters such as plaque, bleeding, furcation involvement and mobility are measured to gain an overall understanding of the level of disease. Radiographs may also be performed to assess alveolar bone levels and levels of destruction.\n\nContemporary periodontal treatment is designed based on the ‘Trimeric Model’, and is performed in 4 phases. These phases are structured to ensure that periodontal therapy is conducted in a logical sequence, consequently improving the prognosis of the patient, in comparison to indecisive treatment plan without a clear goal.\n\nThe non-surgical phase is the initial phase in the sequence of procedures required for periodontal treatment. This phase aims to reduce and eliminate any gingival inflammation by removing dental plaque, calculus (dental), restoration of tooth decay and correction of defective restoration as these all contribute to gingival inflammation, also known as gingivitis. Phase I consists of treatment of emergencies, antimicrobial therapy, diet control, patient education and motivation, correction of iatrogenic factors, deep caries, hopeless teeth, preliminary scaling, temporary splinting, occlusal adjustment, minor orthodontic tooth movement and debridement (dental).\n\nDuring this phase, patients after 3–6 weeks from initial therapy; it is required to re-evaluate the steps carried out after the phase I therapy. Usually 3–6 weeks re-evaluation is crucial in severe cases of periodontal disease. The elements which are required to be re-evaluated are the results of initial therapy (Phase I Therapy), oral hygiene and status, bleeding and plaque scores and a review of diagnosis and prognosis and modification of the whole treatment plan if necessary.\n\nAfter post Phase I, it is necessary to evaluate the requirement of periodontium for surgery. Factors identifying the Surgical phase is required are: periodontal pocket management in specific situations, irregular bony contours or deep craters, areas of suspected incomplete removal of local deposits, degree II and III furcation involvements, distal areas of last molars with expected mucogingival junction problems, persistent inflammation, root coverage and removal of gingival enlargement.\n\nDuring this phase, any defects need to be restored with removable or fixed through dental prosthesis, prosthodontics, or other restoration process.\n\nThe last phase of Periodontal Therapy requires the preservation of periodontal health. In this phase, patients are required to re-visit through a scheduled plan for maintenance care to prevent any re-occurrence of the disease. The maintenance phase constitutes the long-term success for periodontal treatment, thus contributes to a long relation between the oral health therapist/dentist/periodontist and the patient.\n\nThe prognosis of the restorative treatment is determined by the periodontal health. The goals for establishing periodontal health prior to restorative treatment are as follows:\n\nNon-surgical therapy is the golden standard of periodontal therapy which consists of debridement (dental) with a combination of oral hygiene instructions and patient motivation. It mainly focuses on the elimination and reduction of putative pathogens and shifting the microbial flora to a favourable environment to stabilise periodontal disease. Debridement (dental) is thorough mechanical removal of calculus and dental biofilm from the root surfaces of the tooth. Debridement (dental) is the basis of treatment for inflammatory periodontal diseases and remains the golden standard for surgical and non-surgical treatment in the initial therapy. It is conducted by hand instrumentation such as curettes or scalers and ultrasonic instrumentation. It requires a few appointments, depending on time and clinician skills for effective removal of supragingival and subgingival calculus (dental), when periodontal pocket is involved. It can assist in periodontal healing and reduce periodontal pocketing by changing the subgingival ecological environment. Prevention of periodontal disease and maintenance of the periodontal tissues following initial treatment requires on the patient's ability to perform and maintain effective dental plaque removal. This requires patient to be motivated in improving their oral hygiene and requires behaviour change in terms of tooth brushing, interdental cleaning, and other oral hygiene techniques. Personal oral hygiene is often the considered an essential aspect of controlling chronic periodontitis Research has shown that it is important to appreciate the motivation of the patient behaviour changes that has originated from the patient. Patients must want to improve their oral hygiene and feel confident that they have the skills to do this. It is crucial for the clinician to encourage patient changes and to educate the patient appropriately. Motivational interviewing is a good technique to ask open-ended questions and express empathy towards the patient.\n\nAn Oral Health Therapist is a member of the dental team who is dual qualified as a Dental Hygienist and Dental therapist. They work closely with Dentists and a number of Dental Specialists including Periodontists. It is common for the Oral Health Therapist to be involved in the treatment of gingival and periodontal diseases for patients. Their scope of practice in this area includes oral health assessment, diagnosis, treatment and maintenance and referral where necessary. They also have expertise in providing oral health education and promotion to support the patient to maintain their at home oral care. Oral Health Therapists are employed into the dental team to share the responsibilities of care. They are an important asset as they have been uniquely and specifically trained in preventative dentistry and risk minimisation. This allows the dental team to work more competently and effectively as Dentists can manage more complex treatments or significantly medically compromised patients.\n\nA periodontist is a specialist dentist who treats patients for periodontal related diseases and conditions. They are involved in the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of periodontal disease. Periodontists receive further specialist training in Periodontics after completing a dental degree. Periodontists provide treatments for patients with severe gingival diseases and/or complex medical histories. Periodontists offer a wide range of treatments including root scaling and planing, periodontal surgery, implant surgery and other complex periodontal procedures.\n\nList of procedures performed by a periodontist:\n\nPatient's are able to access treatment from a specialist periodontist with an appropriate referral from a dental practitioner. The Dental Hygienist, Oral Health Therapist or Dentist will decide upon whether or not the patient requires further treatment from a Periodontist. The practitioner will then fill out a referral form outlining both patient and practitioner concerns, needs and wants.\n\nBefore applying to any postgraduate training program in periodontology, one must first complete a dental degree.\n\nAlthough each European country has its own independent system, an umbrella organisation—the European Federation of Periodontology (EFP)—has the ability to accredit post-graduate programs according to specific guidelines. The EFP awards a certificate of specialized training in periodontology, periodontics and implant dentistry to every successful European candidates after 3 years of full-time training in an accredited post-graduate program. The EFP organizes bi-annual meetings around Europe under the title EuroPerio where many thousands of dentists attend the sessions featuring over 100 of the world's top perio speakers. The graduate programs that have been approved are the following: , University of Bern, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Institute for Postgraduate Dental Education Jönköping, UCL Eastman Dental Institute, University of Louvain (UCLouvain), University Complutense in Madrid, University of Dublin, Trinity College, University of Strasbourg in France, Paris Diderot University at Rothschild hospital.\n\nAustralian programs are accredited by the Australian Dental Council (ADC) and are 3 years in length and culminate with either a Master's degree (MDS) or a Doctor of Clinical Dentistry degree (DClinDent). Fellowship can then be obtained with the Royal Australasian College of Dental Surgeons, FRACDS (Perio).\n\nCanadian programs are accredited by the CDAC and are a minimum of three years in length and usually culminate with a master (MSc or MDent) degree. Graduates are then eligible to sit for the Fellowship exams with the Royal College of Dentists of Canada (FRCD(C)). Dentistry is a regulated profession. To become a licensed dentist in Canada you must have a BDS/DDS/DMD degree and be certified by the NDEB. To further specialise into periodontics, accredited dentists are required to undertake a specialty core knowledge examination and complete a postgraduate degree.\n\nPeriodontics is offered as a specialization field of dentistry in India. Periodontists attend a Master of Dental Surgery (M.D.S.) program affiliated with dental schools in India. The minimum qualification required for the M.D.S. degree is a Bachelor of Dental Surgery. A majority of dental schools in India offer M.D.S. degrees specializing in Periodontology. The course is three years duration and students are trained for implantology as well as diagnosis and treatment of peri implant diseases along with Periodontology.\n\nThe British Society of Periodontology exists to promote the art and science of periodontology. Their membership includes specialist practitioners, periodontists, general dentists, consultants and trainees in restorative dentistry, clinical academics, dental hygienists and therapists, specialist trainees in periodontology and many others.\n\nSpecialist training in periodontics in the UK is either a three-year full-time or four years at three days per week. At the end of the training, candidates are awarded a Master of Clinical Dentistry (MClinDent) before being entered on the specialist list held by the General Dental Council.\n\nThe American Dental Association (ADA) accredited programs are a minimum of three years in length. According to the American Academy of Periodontology, U.S.-trained periodontists are specialists in the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of periodontal diseases and oral inflammation, and in the placement and maintenance of dental implants. Many periodontists also diagnose and treat oral pathology. Historically, periodontics served as the basis for the specialty of oral medicine. Following successful completion of post-graduate training a periodontist becomes Board eligible for the American Board of Periodontology examination. Successful completion of board certification results in Diplomate status in the American Board of Periodontology.\n\nAfter periodontal treatment, whether it be surgical or non-surgical, maintenance periodontal therapy is essential for a long term result and stabilization of periodontal disease. There is also a difference in the maintenance of different types of periodontal disease, as there are different types, such as:\n\nThe reversible inflammation of the gums, is easily maintained and easily done by patients alone. After the removal of the inflammatory product, usually plaque or calculus, this allows the gums room to heal. This is done by patients thoroughly cleaning teeth every day with a soft bristle toothbrush and an interdental aid. This can be floss, flosset, pikster or what is preferred by patient. Without patient compliance and constant removal of plaque and calculus, gingivitis cannot be treated completely and can progress in to periodontitis that is irreversible.\n\nAlso Acute necrotising ulcerative gingivitis and necrotising ulcerative periodontitis, a type of periodontal disease, different than many other periodontal diseases, clinical characteristics of, gingival necrosis (break down of the gums), gingival pain, bleeding, and halitosis (bad breath), also has a grey colour to the gingiva and a punched out appearance. It is treated through debridement usually under local aesthetic due to immense pain. To maintain and treat the condition completely, a Chlorhexidine mouth wash should be recommended to the patient to use twice daily, oral health instruction should be provided, using a soft bristle toothbrush twice a day or an electric toothbrush and an interdental cleaning aid, such as floss or piksters which cleans the areas that the toothbrush cannot reach. Patient should also be educated on proper nutrition and diet, and also healthy fluid intake, also to complete cease disease smoking cessation should be done not just to completely eradicate disease but also for health od patient. Pain control can be done through ibuprofen or Panadol. In the case of an immunocompromised patient antibiotics should be prescribed. Assessment of treatment should be done after 24 hours of treatment and continued to do so every 3–6 months until signs and symptoms are resolved and gingival health and function restored.\n\nThe inflammation of the gums and irreversible destruction of the alveolar bone and surrounding structures of the teeth, usually slow progressing but can have bursts. Local factors explain presence of disease, such as, diet, lack of oral hygiene, plaque accumulation, smoking etc. Characterised by pocket formation and recession (shrinkage of the gums) of the gingiva. Treatment and maintenance are important in stopping disease progression and to resolve the inflammation, treatment usually consist of scaling and root planning, surgical therapy, regenerative surgical therapy. After treatment, patient care and regular maintenance check ups are important to completely eradicate disease and present reappearance of the disease. This is done through patient effective plaque control and removal, done through daily toothbrushing of twice a day and interdental cleaning once a day, chlorhexidine mouthwash can also be effective. Patient should also present to dentist for maintenance check ups at least every three-months for in office check-up and if necessary, plaque control.\n\nInvolves inflammation of the gingiva and rapid and severe destruction of the periodontal ligament, alveolar bone and surrounding structures, different to chronic periodontitis often happens in patients with good oral health and plaque control and can be genetic. Patients generally appear clinically healthy. It can be localised, which generally has a circumpubertal onset, and generalised which usually occurs in individuals above the age of 35. Treatment is determined on the severity of the disease and the age of the patient. Usually supra gingival (above gums) and sub gingival (under gums) debridement and antibiotics are sometimes necessary. To maintain the treatment and prevent reoccurrence of disease patient care is necessary, such as oral hygiene, like all other forms of periodontitis and gingivitis, brushing twice a day and interdental cleaning is a necessity in maintaining a healthy periodontium and preventing the continuation of periodontal destruction. Regular periodontal check ups are also necessary, every 3–6 months.\n\nPeriodontitis that is caused by systemic disease, there are currently at least 16 systemic diseases that have been linked with periodontal disease, such as, diabetes mellitus, haematological disorders such as acquired neutropenia and leukemia, down syndrome etc. Treatment and preventions are a very important concept in the management and maintenance of periodontitis as a manifestation of systemic disease. Treatment can consist of either surgical or non surgical treatment depending on severity. After treatment patient compliance is important which includes oral hygiene which is tooth brushing twice a day, interdental brushing at least once a day and chlorohexidine mouth wash may also be helpful.\n\n\n"}

He settled in the then isolated area of Berowra, before moving to nearby Hornsby, New South Wales. \n\nSince his French academic qualifications as a \"Professeur\" were not recognised by Australian universities, he worked as an artist and art teacher, and contributed drawings and articles to local newspapers. He founded the first Australian art magazine, , and was one of the founders of the Royal Art Society of New South Wales .\n\nHis publication of \"The Discovery of Australia\" in 1895 earned him accolade as a \"genius\" and as \"an authority on geographical matters\" from members of the Royal Geographical Society as well as foreign honours: in 1908 he was created a Knight Commander of the Order of Santiago by the King of Portugal. In 1917 he was made a Knight Commander of the Order of Isabella la Catolica by the King of Spain. However, not everyone was as complimentary; his official biographer, O.H.K. Spate, described him as of \"undisciplined intellect\" and lacking a \"rigorously judicial habit of mind\"; the book was a financial failure; and a proposed scheme to use a simplified version of the book, \"The First Discovery of Australia and New Guinea\" (1906), in schools was withdrawn.\n\nCollingridge published \"Alice in One Dear Land\" in 1922. It is a handmade book with numerous small tipped in plates. Alice is depicted in the Australian bush with a koala, this is the first depiction of \"Alice in Wonderland\" in an Australian setting.\n\nCollingridge's distant relative, Vanessa Collingridge, published a book on Captain Cook, entitled \"Captain Cook\" (2002), and the publication of this book has caused a certain resurgence of interest in George Collingridge in recent years.\n\n\n"}

The service followed the same route as the non-stop Heathrow Express service but called at certain intermediate stations, connecting several locations in West London with each other, the airport, and Central London. It ran every half-hour throughout the day and evening. The service was launched on 12 June 2005 and ceased on 19 May 2018, when it was absorbed into the TfL Rail franchise, in advance of becoming part of the Elizabeth line in 2021.\n\nHeathrow Connect had a complex operating structure: Heathrow Airport Holdings (formerly the BAA) supplied the rolling stock and on-board staff through its Heathrow Express subsidiary, and owned the track from Airport Junction to the terminals. The GWR collected the revenue for journeys between Paddington and Hayes & Harlington, while Heathrow Airport Holdings collected the revenue for journeys between Hayes & Harlington and the terminals.\n\nFares between Paddington and Hayes & Harlington were the same as for GWR services, but the single fare between Hayes and Heathrow was £6.30 . Oyster cards, Travelcards and Freedom Passes were not valid between Hayes & Harlington and Heathrow, but could be used throughout the rest of the route. When the service was first introduced in 2005, the fare for the journey from Hayes to Heathrow was £6, which at £2 per mile made it one of the most expensive train journeys in the world.\n\nThe service was designed principally for the use of airport staff and West London residents for travel to Heathrow or Paddington. With a staff ID card, discounted fares were available for the journey between Hayes and Heathrow.\n\nHeathrow Connect was marketed as a cheaper way to reach Paddington from Heathrow and vice versa, with a single fare of £10.30 (less than half the Heathrow Express fare, but almost double the price of a London Underground journey) and a journey time of 25 minutes against the Express time of 15 minutes. Passengers were also permitted to use their Railcards to access discounts. Originally it was not intended to be used as a cheaper (but slower) alternative to the Heathrow Express service from Paddington to Heathrow: every Connect service was overtaken by an Express service en route, and at Paddington trains were originally advertised on departure boards as running to Hayes & Harlington only. Standard-class travel between Heathrow Airport terminals was free, and this included Heathrow Connect services.\n\nHeathrow Connect used the relief lines of the Great Western Main Line between Paddington and Airport Junction, replacing some stopping services operated by First Great Western Link. As part of the original Heathrow Express project, these lines were electrified at 25 kV AC overhead as a diversionary route, and feature Automatic Train Protection. An additional flyover bridge was built in 2008 as part of Crossrail works to enable trains to enter or leave the airport spur without crossing any of the Great Western Main Line tracks.\n\nServices initially terminated at Heathrow Central. Following Heathrow Express services being diverted to Terminal 5, from March 2008 Heathrow Connect services were extended to Terminal 4.\n\nThe service pattern, , was as follows:\n\nHeathrow Connect used five-car electric multiple units. Four were built by Siemens Mobility in Krefeld, Germany for Angel Trains as demonstrator Desiros. One was brought to Northampton Kings Heath Siemens Depot in 2002 before South West Trains' Class 450s were delivered. The others were used at the Wildenrath Test Centre.\n\nAll four were purchased by Heathrow Connect and rebuilt before being sent to England. A fifth five-car set was delivered in November 2005, but did not enter service until December 2006. A fifth carriage was added to the original four four-car sets in 2006.\n\nOn 20 May 2018, TfL Rail took over the services operated by Heathrow Connect as a precursor to the full opening of the Elizabeth line. Fares on the line are now integrated into the TfL fare scheme, and therefore match the fare scheme of London Underground services, with the exception of a premium for single journeys to and from Heathrow using Pay As You Go (Oyster and contactless). Passengers are able to use Oyster cards, Travelcards and Freedom Passes to travel between Hayes & Harlington and Heathrow.\n\nEventually the service will be re-branded as the Elizabeth line and train paths will be extended through the new tunnels at Paddington through Central London, calling at stations such as Bond Street, Liverpool Street and Canary Wharf. When the line opens fully, eastbound trains from Heathrow will terminate at Shenfield or Abbey Wood.\n\nTfL Rail had originally planned to replace the existing Class 360 units with Class 345s, but due to delays with the signalling system in the Heathrow Airport tunnels and late delivery of Class 345 units, a contingency plan has been implemented. The Class 360s will continue to be used between London Paddington and Heathrow, supplemented by two Class 345 trains per hour running between London Paddington and the extended bay platform at Hayes & Harlington, until the Class 360s can be fully replaced.\n"}

This yellow flag is the Q flag in the set of international maritime signal flags.\n\nSince flying the Q flag involves a request for boarding by Port State Control, it has also become an invitation to Customs to inspect a vessel for dutiable goods or contraband, as in the \"Rich Harvest\" case, where a yacht carrying a large quantity of alcohol flew the Q flag in order to seek exemption from having to pay duty during a temporary visit to port. The same vessel was also flying the Q flag when she was boarded in Cape Verde and found to be carrying more than one ton of cocaine.

South Africa to date have competed at two Rugby League World Cups in 1995 and 2000 but have failed to win a game in the competition.\n\nRugby league was originally introduced to South Africa in the 1950s with the staging of several series tournaments within the country that saw fixtures between the English and the French however this concept failed to generate the needed interest and was not upheld. The South Africans did not see further international rugby league until the 1960s where the first national side undertook fixtures against the visiting British and a tour to Australia. From the 1960s onwards the international fixture list for the South Africans was minimal and it was not until the early 1990s when they began to play with some lasting regularity.\n\nSince they began playing international rugby league South Africa have always found it difficult to compete against the more established nations and so progress and improvement have been slow. Possibly their greatest achievement to date has been the qualification and participation in two World Cups in both 1995 and 2000 where South Africa failed to win a fixture after being seeded in tough groups at both tournaments where they had to play world champions Australia along with England, Fiji, France, Papua New Guinea and Tonga.\n\nSouth Africa traditionally play in a predominately green uniform with black shorts, they have commonly been referred to as \"The Rhinos\" since the early 1990s. The South African emblem is a red and yellow King Protea plant which is the national flower of South Africa. South African internationals are played at a variety of venues throughout the country with no singular home ground being used.\n\nIt has often been said that South Africa has great potential for rugby league, but the sport has a relatively low profile in the country with rugby union being the predominant and more established code. This is exacerbated by the fact that very few schools offer rugby league as an extracurricular activity and there are relatively few youth clubs. The popularity of the South Africa national rugby union team and South Africa national rugby sevens team in the country further hinders the development of rugby league as potential players are groomed to play in the national and provincial Rugby union teams and the national Rugby sevens team from a young age.\n\nRugby league first gained attention in South Africa when the English and French attempted expansion in the 1950s for the purpose of creating further international opposition. Three games were then played between the two nations on the continent but both sides viewed the matches as nothing more than friendly fixtures so never undertook the games in a serious manner and the public never subsequently took to the three exhibition games. Though rugby league was only seriously played in South Africa beginning in the 1950s, the sport was not unknown to South Africans prior to that decade; for example, a number of notable black and Coloured rugby union players, such as David Barends, Green Vigo, and Enslin Dlambulo, code-switched from union to league and moved overseas, in part because of the allure of professionalism, while also escaping the apartheid regime. \n\nOver the next several years, rugby league lay dormant in South Africa and it was not until the 1960s when talks of creating a national side began. After much discussion within South Africa, it was eventually agreed for a national side to play a touring Great Britain and then undertake a tour of Australasia. The first South African national side played their first competitive fixture on 23 August 1962 and put on a good showing against the much stronger British but eventually lost by nineteen points 49–30. The following two fixtures turned out to be much the same with the South Africans being defeated on another two occasions but putting in good performances whilst never being comprehensively beaten. The South Africans embarked on their first tour eleven months later with a twenty-four-man squad that included several former Springboks. The tour started with several friendly fixtures against various minor representative sides where they gained two comfortable victories; the first international fixture of the tour took place in Brisbane against the world champion Australians and the South Africans performed with courage but eventually lost the match 34–6. The following test was played a week later in Sydney that again saw the team put in a tough effort but lost again 54–21. South Africa left Australia without an international win and be low on confidence heading to New Zealand to play a sole fixture against the New Zealand national side whom were expected to win comfortably. However, the match turned out to be a tough encounter and surprisingly saw the team gain its first international victory 4–3 The South Africans featured several Australian players bought in to cover injuries and improve the quality of the side and so the match against New Zealand is not counted as a test match.\n\nAfter this first string of international fixtures the South Africans became disheartened after only winning four of the thirteen tour matches and rugby league again lay dormant for decades.\n\nThe Rugby League World Cup tournament had been scheduled to be held in France in 1965, this time with the inclusion of the South African team. However the tournament was abandoned.\n\nThe early 1990s saw new South African administrators begin to rebuild the international facet of South African rugby. During 1992, the South African national side again played for the first time in years against several combined African representative teams and the following years saw things look more promising for the Africans with their qualification into the 1995 World Cup and more regularity in international fixtures. Their first World Cup saw the South Africans seeded into the toughest group of the competition containing Australia, England and Fiji. The South Africans found their three group matches extremely difficult and failed to win a match during the tournament.\n\nThe following years saw the South Africans play on an inconsistent basis against several touring sides and qualify for their second consecutive World Cup in 2000. Leading into the tournament they were hopeful of gaining their first Cup win after being drawn into an easier yet still competitive group with France, Papua New Guinea and Tonga. After initial optimism leading into the competition the South Africans faced Tonga in their first world cup fixture and be comprehensively beaten 66–18. The following world cup matches added further disappointment and diminish all optimism the South Africans originally had with further heavy losses to both Papua New Guinea and the French.\n\nAfter a second disappointing World Cup the side again began playing irregularly with one off fixtures over the next several years and it was not until 2006 when they again undertook another tour. A tour to Italy was undertaken in June 2006, which saw the South Africans play in two tests and a nines competition in Montelanico.\n\nIn 2008, the South Africa Rhinos were scheduled to participate in the 2008 Rugby League World Cup Qualifiers in the Atlantic pool also featuring the USA, Japan and the West Indies. The winner of the tournament entered into the repecharge round for the chance to qualify for the 2008 Rugby League World Cup. South Africa withdrew alongside the West Indies due to financial reasons, leaving the tournament as a one off fixture between the USA and Japan. As a result of their withdrawal South Africa forfeited the opportunity to qualify for the World Cup.\n\nIn 2011 however, the South Africa national rugby league team participated in the Atlantic Qualification Tournament as part of the 2013 Rugby League World Cup Qualifiers. The winner of the tournament qualified for the 2013 Rugby League World Cup that is to be held in England and Wales. Despite beating Canada 36–22 in a warm-up match before the beginning of the tournament, South Africa nevertheless lost to USA 40–4 in the opening match of the tournament.\n\nIn 2015 South Africa were confirmed to take on Lebanon in a one-off 2017 Rugby League World Cup qualifier in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. However the match was shifted to a two match playoff in Pretoria, South Africa due to a controversial arrest of an illegal immigrant who was in charge of organizing the initial match at the Dubai Sports City complex.\n\n\nSince rugby league has been known to the nation of South Africa since the 1950s many players of South African birth or heritage have gone on to attain notability in representing either South Africa, other nations or appearing in major domestic leagues around the world, some of the more notable South Africans have included:\n\n\n"}

Surface finishes for steel strap include: paint, paint and wax, bluing or zinc and wax. The wax is used to better transmit the tension around the bundle and for use with certain types of tensioners. Common applications include steel coils, bundles of metal, baling wire, bricks and pavers, and roll end-binding. Steel Strapping is sold by weight rather than length, due to the natural expansion and contraction of steel in the manufacturing process. A 3/4 x .020 Steel Strapping Coil yields approximately 19.6 feet per pound. \n\nPolypropylene strap (oriented or tensilized) is an economical material designed for light to medium duty unitizing, palletizing and bundling. It is available in various widths, thicknesses, and polymer variations (e.g., copolymers). Most polypropylene is embossed, some of which is also printed. This product offers higher elongation at break but tends to have irrecoverable dead stretch with constant stress.\nWhat is not generally known to end users is that polypropylene strapping will lose about 50% of the applied tension within one hour, and that this tension loss is accelerated with increases in ambient temperature, consequently although suitable for packs with a degree of stored energy that will take up any relaxtion that occurs in the strap, unacceptable strap slackness may occur after time if used on product that is 'Solid' such as bricks or concrete. Furthermore polypropylene strapping is susceptible to UV degradation and can quickly degrade if left outside exposed to the elements. The sensible choice of colour will retard the process, such as specifying black strap. Similarly, a UV inhibitor can be specified.\n\nPolypropylene strapping may be printed, either during production and pre-embossing for the highest quality and precision, or post production over the embossing for a reduced quality. Both offer security and marketing advantages to the strapped product.\n\nOriented or tensilized polyester and nylon are the strongest plastic strapping products and are used as a viable alternative to steel strapping in some industries. Polyester provides excellent retained tension on rigid loads. Its excellent recovery properties help a load absorb impact without strap breakage.\n\nThere are specialized types available for specific applications. For instance, in cold climates a strap bonded in hot melt glue is used because it is weather-proof.\n\nNylon strap has the greatest specific strength of the three plastics, however it is rarely used due to its high price. In the past nylon strap used to be very popular, but over time polyester has replaced almost all of its use. One application that still uses this type of strap is cold room applications, because it does not creep as much as the other types of plastic.\n\nCorded and woven strapping are available in several constructions, primarily involving polyester and rayon. Some types are reusable. Because this system uses a buckle for a joint, corded and woven strapping can have a larger system strength than steel banding. Corded polyester strapping also has a higher elongation than other strapping systems, which gives it an ideal memory for sea and rail shipments. Because corded and woven polyester straps are light and soft, they are also a safer alternative to steel banding.\n\nPaper strap is used to strap paper products between industrial processes. This allows the bundle to be introduced into the process without the need to cut the straps, which can lead to the product falling apart prematurely.\n\nComposite strapping has filaments embedded in it. In the load securing industry it is often referred to as “synthetic steel”. It is very abrasion resistant and has the highest joint efficiency when used with a buckle. Both advantages are not affected by climate.\n\nExamples include:\n\nStrapping is most often used in complete horizontal or vertical bands. \"Edge protectors\" are used to help spread the load at corners and reduce damage to the load by the tensioned strap. Strapping can also be used in loops attached to holding locations on rail cars, skids, etc.\n\nAfter the strap is tensioned, the strap is often sealed to itself. Steel strap is sealed with a seal and notch joint, a seal and crimp, seal-less joint, or via welding. Seals come in various shapes depending on the application; some can be put on after the strap is tensioned, while others must be installed before tensioning. To create the seal, the seal and strap are notched on both sides; if one set of notches are created then it is called a \"single notch\" joint, if two sets of notches are created then it is called a \"double notch\" joint. Crimp joints also use a seal, but crimp undulations are used instead of formed notches. These crimps form great frictional forces which keep the joint from seeping. Seal-less joints are created by forming interlocking \"keys\" into the middle of the strap.\n\nPlastic strap is most commonly joined by melting the straps together by adding heat to the joint. For lighter gauge strap, usually and narrower, heat is introduced with a hot knife system. First, the hot knife moves in between the straps. Then a platen comes up and compresses the straps and hot knife against an anvil on the order of tens of milliseconds. The platen then drops and the hot knife is removed. After the hot knife is completely clear of the straps the platen comes back up and compresses the joint so that the melted portions of the strap mix and harden.\n\nFor thicker plastic strap, usually and thicker, friction is used to create heat within the joint. The process starts with the strap compressed between the platen and the anvil. There is a vibrator built into either the platen or the anvil, which has teeth; there are also teeth on the opposite component that does not move. The vibrator is quickly vibrated, which creates enough heat to melt the interface between the two strap, because of friction. To complete the weld the vibrator is stopped and the pressure held until the joint has solidified. Polypropylene and Polyester strapping can also be sealed in a similar manner with the heat being produced by sound in the form of Ultrasonic waves passing through the materials and exiting the molecular structure. They are then compressed as in a heat seal. In ultrasonic welding of plastics, high frequency (15 kHz to 40 kHz ) low amplitude vibration is used to create heat by way of friction between the materials to be joined. The interface of the two parts is specially designed to concentrate the energy for the maximum weld strength.\n\nIt may also be joined manually by crimping a seal or via a buckle.\n\nThe joint is the weakest part of the system, therefore the type of joining method used is very important if strength is an issue. The strength of a joint is defined as the force required to break the strap in uniaxial tension. This is then compared to the uniaxial strength of the strap and recorded as the percent difference (e.g., a sample of steel strap may have a break strength and the seal may fail at , so the seal is said to have a 60% strength). Hot knife welds have a minimum break strength of 55%. Friction welds have a minimum break strength of 65%. Well set up strapping machines or friction weld tools will aim for around 80% of break strength. Metal clips/seals are surprisingly low with circa 100 – 120 kg slip resistance.\n\nFor pallets strapping based on norm ASTM D3953 Standard Specification, the number of the strapping procedure is around 10 times for a minimal.\n\nThere are two major types of equipment available for strapping: hand tools and \"strapping machines\" or \"banding machines\". A dispenser is used with both types of equipment to dispense the strap. Some strapping machines have the dispenser built-in, others (typically those on large arch machines) have a separately powered dispenser, which can automatically load or thread new coils. Non-powered separated dispensers have a pulley which releases and activates a brake to stop the inertia of the coil to keep the strap from over-running onto the floor. Typically dispensers used on large arch strapping machines have multiple pulleys to act as a way to store strap in a way that can be quickly dispensed. Smaller arch machines such as tabletop machines will feed strap into a pool box/accumulator instead. In both cases this is required otherwise the strapping machine will draw the strap faster than the dispenser can pay off.\n\nWithin hand tools, there are manual and automatic tools. Manual tensioners and crimping systems are available for low volume applications. Automatic hand tools are used for higher volume applications. Automatic tools are available using a battery power source or compressed air. Both manual and automatic tools are available as combination tools, which perform the tensioning, sealing and cutting, or as separate tensioners, sealers, and cutters. Manual sealers for plastic strap always use a seal and a compression (serrated seals) or crimp joint (smooth-faced seals). Manual and automatic hand sealers for steel can use a seal or a seal-less joint. Automatic hand tools for plastic strap use a friction weld.\n\nStrapping machines, also known as \"bundlers\" or \"banders\", are used for higher volume applications or special applications. They are available in horizontal and vertical orientations, however the vertical orientation is far more common. They are also available in bottom seal, side seal, and top seal orientations, which define where the joint is located on the bundle. They are available in semi-automatic and automatic varieties. The automatic versions can additionally to be used inline with conveyor systems. A photocell is used to detect when the bundle is in the correct location, stop the conveyors, and activate the strapping machine. Most however will be found in standalone applications.\n\nSemi-automatic and fully automatic strapping machines substantially improve efficiency in a warehouse and also the overall presentation of your packaged product. The labour-saving can often easily cover the relatively low cost of the strapping machine.\n\nBoth semi and fully automatic strapping machines can easily be included in a packing production line where packing tables and strapping machines are positioned at workable heights.\n\nBanding machines like strapping machines allow the unitization and securing of products with a variety of different shapes and sizes. \n\nBanding machines, however, are less damaging to the product being strapped, since the larger widths of bands available (20mm - 100mm) allow greater surface area that minimizes the harm on sensitive products. Banding machines can also run on paper straps for a more eco-friendly alternative to plastic strapping. \n\nOperation is by photo-sensor, foot pedal, or a PLC, allowing these machines to be integrated into production lines or for standalone operation.\n\nAutomatic strapping machines allow hands-free securing of parcels with automatically tensioned, sealed and cut polypropylene strapping. \n\nOperation is either by a foot pedal or parcel sensor making these machines ideal for volume throughput.\n\nSemi-automatic strapping machines will allow one operator to automatically tension, seal and cut polypropylene strapping to give neat and secure fastening on any size box. \n\nAdjustable strap tensioning to suit each package prevents strap damage to softer boxes.\n\n\n\n"}

Howard and first published in the January, 1933 issue of \"Weird Tales\" magazine. It is set in the pseudo-historical Hyborian Age and concerns a middle-aged Conan battling rival kingdoms, being captured through treachery and escaping from an eldritch dungeon via unexpected aid. The story includes Tsotha-lanti, an evil wizard whose sorcerous arts help to ensnare King Conan.\n\nThe story was republished in the collections \"King Conan\" (Gnome Press, 1953) and \"Conan the Usurper\" (Lancer Books, 1967). It has more recently been published in the collections \"The Conan Chronicles Volume 2: The Hour of the Dragon\" (Gollancz, 2001) and \"\" (Del Rey, 2003).\n\nThe story is very similar to\" The Hour of the Dragon\", which shares the points of Conan's capture and later escape from a dungeon, even though it tones down the supernatural element.\n\n\"The Scarlet Citadel\" was the second Conan story to be published in \"Weird Tales\" magazine and involves an older, wiser Conan as king of Aquilonia. King Conan receives a call for help from Amalrus, the ruler of neighbouring Ophir, who claims that Strabonus, the Emperor of Koth, is threatening his kingdom.\n\nWhen Conan marches into Ophir, with an army of five thousand Aquilonian knights, his planned campaign is revealed to be a trap as the two monarchs are working together to destroy him with the assistance of a Kothian wizard named Tsotha-lanti. The Aquilonian knights are driven-off by a swarm of giant crabs while Conan, having been captured, is imprisoned within a Korshemish dungeon. This dungeon is used by Tsotha-lanti for nefarious experiments, and Conan discovers many of the bizarre horrors during his escape.\n\nEventually, Conan frees Pelias, a former rival wizard of Tsotha-lanti, who helps him escape the dungeon and regain his position as king of Aquilonia. This notably makes Pelias a rare case of a sorcerer who is Conan's ally rather than his enemy (the only other being the witch Zelata in \"The Hour of the Dragon\"). The story climaxes with a gigantic battle, where Tsotha-lanti meets a grisly fate at the hands of Pelias.\n\nRobert Weinberg described \"The Scarlet Citadel\" as \"Howard at his best\", and praised the character of Pelias.\n\nThe story was adapted by Roy Thomas and Frank Brunner in \"Savage Sword of Conan\" #30 in 1978, then by Tim Truman and Tomas Giorello in 2011 in \"King Conan: The Scarlet Citadel\".\n\n"}

They live in rocky deserts across the northern parts of the continent. The family comprises four living genera and five species (Speke's gundi, Felou gundi, Val's or desert gundi, common or North African gundi and Mzab gundi), as well as numerous extinct genera and species. They are in the superfamily Ctenodactyloidea. Local people in northern Africa have always known about gundis, however they first came to the notice of western naturalists in Tripoli in 1774, and were given the name \"gundi mice\". While they are not regarded as pests, some people hunt gundis for food.\n\nGundis are from 17 to 18 cm in body length, with compact bodies covered in soft fur, short legs, and large eyes. They have only four toes on all feet and the middle toes of the hind feet carry comb-like bristles, which earned them the name \"comb rat\". Gundis have short tails, which in some species are covered in a large fan of hair that aids in balancing as they move about their rocky and uneven environments. Their ribcages are flexible, which helps them fit into small crevices.\n\nGundis are herbivorous, eating almost every type of available plant. Like many other desert animals, they do not drink, obtaining all the moisture they need from their food. Their incisors lack the layer of tough, orange, enamel found in other rodents, and they have a dental formula of: \n\nFemales typically give birth to two young at a time, after a gestation period of about two months. Because of the need to preserve moisture, female gundis produce only a small amount of milk, and the young are fully weaned by four weeks of age. On average, female gundis are bigger than males. Gundis live about 3 to 4 years in the wild.\n\nGundis live in all manner of rocky desert habitats: cliffs, hills, rocky outcrops, scree slopes, and so on. They are found between sea level and 2,500 meters in elevation.\n\nGundis live in colonies of up to a hundred or more individuals, although this is much less in environments where food is particularly scarce. They shelter in existing rock crevices at night, or during midday when the sun becomes too hot for them to remain active. Most shelters are temporary, but some are occupied for years. Gundis pile onto each other for heat, especially in cold or windy weather. They are not known to hibernate. Gundi colonies have a dunghill that all the members of the colony use.\n\nGundis are vocal animals, with a range of alarm calls and communication signals for group bonding, greetings, and alerting other gundis of predators. All members of Ctenodactylidae thump their hind feet on the ground when alarmed. Gundis rely on their acute hearing.\n\nIf a gundi is threatened, it will run to the nearest rock crevice or play dead. While gundis are generally slow, they can sprint when threatened. Gundis can also climb up almost vertical surfaces.\n\nAccording to a DNA sequence study, the ancestors of the gundis diverged from those of the Laotian rock rat around the Lutetian, some 44 million years ago (Early/Middle Eocene).\n\nFossils within Ctenodactylidae have been found in Asia, dating back to the mid-Eocene. Gundi fossils from the Pleistocene have been found in Asia, North Africa, and parts of Italy.\n\n"}

Howard. It's set in the pseudo-historical Hyborian Age and concerns Conan infiltrating a perilous tower in order to steal a fabled gem from an evil sorcerer named Yara. Due to its unique insights into the Hyborian world and atypical science fiction elements, the story is considered a classic of Conan lore and is often cited by Howard scholars as one of his best tales.\n\nThe story is set in the decadent, evil Zamorian city of Arenjun, the City of Thieves. A callow young Conan, just beginning his career in the civilized regions, is drinking at a rowdy tavern when a Kothian rogue mentions a fabulous jewel known as the \"Heart of the Elephant\". It is kept in the tower of the evil sorcerer Yara, who has long terrorized the Kingdom of Zamora, most recently having transformed a prince into a spider and crushed the young man underfoot. When Conan interrogates the rogue for more information, the man mocks him and a fight ensues. The candle is knocked over and the tavern is plunged into darkness, but Conan's sword finds his opponent in the dark, and he escapes into the moonlit streets. (The Kothian's death saves a damsel he had planned to kidnap and sell into slavery.)\n\nWithout further planning, Conan ventures into Yara's garden to steal the jewel, but immediately encounters another intruder, Taurus of Nemedia, the \"Prince of Thieves\". The cunning Taurus, who is fat but amazingly agile, is impressed by Conan's daring and they agree to work together, with the master thief assuming a patronizing role to the inexperienced young barbarian. After battling lions in the tower gardens, the thieves ascend Yara's spire by grappling hook and rope. On the roof, Taurus enters a treasure chamber, but is ambushed by a lurking giant spider, and killed by three bites in the neck. After a desperate battle, Conan crushes the spider with a chest of gems, then descends in search of his prize, the Heart.\n\nLower in the tower, he discovers a strange \"trans-cosmic being\" with the body of a man and the oversized head of an elephant. The creature, named Yag-kosha, is a blind and tortured prisoner of Yara.\n\nYag-kosha reveals to Conan the pre-cataclysmic saga of his alien people, their arrival on Earth from the planet Yog, and how he taught Yara the art of magic, only to have his own apprentice betray him; but Conan's intrusion is the perfect opportunity for revenge. Moved to pity by Yag-kosha's plea, Conan, as instructed, grabs the fabled jewel, mercifully kills the elephant-like being, extracts the heart from his corpse, and drips its blood over the Heart of the Elephant. When he sets the blood-infused relic in front of Yara in his sleeping-chamber, the gem's magic shrinks and draws the soceror into the jewel. Inside, a revived Yag-kosha, limbs and wings restored, pursues the screaming Yara as the Heart vanishes.\n\nObeying Yag-kosha's instructions, Conan leaves immediately and emerges empty-handed from the tower at dawn, just as it collapses behind him. He has nothing for his night's work but his sword, loin-cloth, and sandals.\n\n\n\"The Tower of the Elephant\" has been adapted into comic form three times: twice by Marvel and once by Dark Horse.\n\nThe first adaptation by Marvel appeared in \"Conan the Barbarian\" #4. The story was adapted by Roy Thomas and illustrated by Barry Windsor-Smith and Sal Buscema.\n\nThe second adaptation by Marvel appeared in the \"Savage Sword of Conan\" #24 and was again written by Roy Thomas but this time drawn by John Buscema and Alfredo Alcala.\n\nThe newest adaptation, in Dark Horse's \"Conan\" issues 20-22, was written by Kurt Busiek and illustrated by Cary Nord, Dave Stewart and Mike Kaluta. Two of these have recently appeared in collections released by Dark Horse: the Conan the Barbarian adaptation in \"The Conan Chronicles Volume 1: The Tower of the Elephant and other stories\", and the Dark Horse adaptation in \"Conan Volume 3: The Tower of the Elephant and other stories\".\n\nEpisode 3 of the animated series \"Conan the Adventurer\" is adapted from \"Tower of the Elephant\", although the character of Taurus is replaced with Jezmine who becomes an ongoing character in the series rather than dies.\n\nA variant on this story has been added into the massively multiplayer online role-playing game \"Wizard101\", a dungeon called the \"Tower of the Helephant\". The thief Taurus is the only name that remains true to the original tale, however the parallels between the stories are evident to anyone that is familiar with the story. The players must scale a tower and descend into it, ultimately freeing the elephant-headed interstellar being by defeating the wizard that bound him and destroying the \"Heart of the Helephant\".\n\nThe story is the inspiration for a sequence in \"Conan the Barbarian\", which includes Conan and his fellow thieves scaling a tower, battling a giant snake, and stealing a jewel.\n\nIn the 2011 film \"Conan the Barbarian\" a character extols Conan's past accomplishments and mentions his adventure in the Tower of the Elephant.\n\nThere is a modular adventure based on this tale for \"\".

Thus, other things being equal, a player exhibiting spite will prefer an allocation in which other players receive less than more (if more of the good is desirable).\n\nIn this language, spite is difficult to analyze because one has to assess two sets of preferences. For example, in the divide and choose method, a spiteful player would have to make a trade-off between depriving his opponent of cake, and getting more himself.\n\nWithin the field of social evolution, spite is used to describe those social behaviors that have a negative impact on both the actor and recipient(s). Spite can be favored by kin selection when: (a) it leads to an indirect benefit to some third party that is sufficiently related to the actor (Wilsonian spite); or (b) when it is directed primarily at negatively related individuals (Hamiltonian spite). Negative relatedness occurs when two individuals are less related than average.\n\nThe iterated prisoner's dilemma provides an example where players may \"punish\" each other for failing to cooperate in previous rounds, even if doing so would cause negative consequences for both players. For example, the simple \"tit for tat\" strategy has been shown to be effective in round-robin tournaments of iterated prisoner's dilemma.\n\nThere is always difficulty in fairly dividing the proceeds of a business between the business owners and the employees.\n\nWhen a trade union decides to call a strike, both employer and the union members lose money (and may damage the national economy). The unionists hope that the employer will give in to their demands before such losses have destroyed the business.\n\nIn the reverse direction, an employer may terminate the employment of certain productive workers who are agitating for higher wages or organising a trade union. Losing productive workers is a setback to both the business and the employees but this can serve as an example to others and thus maximise employer power.\n\nPolyembryonic wasps, including C. floridanum, exhibit spite through instances of precocious larval development. Spite provides an explanation for how natural selection can favor harmful behaviors that are costly to both the actor and the recipient; spite is typically considered a form of altruism that benefits a secondary recipient. Two criteria demonstrate that spite is truly occurring: (i) the behavior is truly costly to the actor and does not provide a long-term direct benefit; and (ii) harming behaviors are directed toward relatively unrelated individuals.\n\n\n"}

Howard, and first published in \"Weird Tales\" magazine, in December, 1932. The tale, in which Howard created the character of Conan, was a rewrite of the unpublished Kull story, \"By This Axe I Rule!\", with long passages being identical. The Conan version of the story was republished in the collections \"King Conan\" (Gnome Press, 1953) and \"Conan the Usurper\" (Lancer Books, 1967). It has most recently been republished in the collections \"The Conan Chronicles Volume 2: The Hour of the Dragon\" (Gollancz, 2001) and \"\" (Del Rey, 2003). It is set in the pseudo-historical Hyborian Age and details Conan foiling a nefarious plot to unseat him as king of Aquilonia.\n\nThe first Conan story depicts him as a king—which means that when writing later stories placed earlier in Conan's life, as a thief, pirate, mercenary, etc., Howard (and his readers) already knew that the character was ultimately destined to become a king.\n\n\"The Phoenix on the Sword\" begins with a middle-aged Conan of Cimmeria attempting to govern the turbulent kingdom of Aquilonia.\n\nConan has recently seized the crown of Aquilonia from King Numedides after he strangled the tyrant upon his throne. However, his rule over Aqualonia is nonexistent, as Conan is more suited to swinging his broadsword than signing official documents with a stylus. The citizens of Aquilonia, who originally welcomed Conan as their liberator from Numedides' tyranny, have gradually turned against him due to his foreign Cimmerian blood. They have constructed a statue to Numedides' memory in the temple of Mitra, and priests burn incenses before their slain king, hailing it as the holy effigy of a saintly monarch who was done to death by a red-handed barbarian.\n\nDesiring to give the Aquilonian crown to someone of royal blood, a daring band known as the Rebel Four is formed: Volmana, the dwarfish count of Karaban; Gromel, the giant commander of the Black Legion; Dion, the fat baron of Attalus; and Rinaldo, the hare-brained minstrel. The Rebel Four recruit the services of a southern outlaw named Ascalante. However, in secret, Ascalante plans on betraying his employers and claiming the crown for himself.\n\nAscalante has a slave named Thoth-Amon, formerly a powerful Stygian wizard, who has fallen on hard times since he lost a mystical ring. A thief had stolen his ring and left Thoth-Amon defenseless, forcing him to flee from Stygia. Disguised as a camel driver, he was waylaid in Koth by Ascalante's reavers. While the rest of his caravan was slaughtered, Thoth-Amon saved himself by revealing his identity and swearing to serve Ascalante.\n\nThe story revolves around the conspirator's attempt in assassinating King Conan when he is unprepared and defenseless. However, two unforeseen events ultimately thwart their plan. Conan is forewarned of an impending coup by the arrival of a long-dead sage named Epemitreus, who marks Conan's sword with a mystical phoenix representing Mitra, a Hyborian god. Meanwhile, Thoth-Amon murders Dion and recovers his lost ring of power, then summons a fanged ape-like demon who he wishes to slay Ascalante. Conan slays the three remaining members of the Rebel Four, breaking his sword upon the helm of Gromel and using a battle-axe against the rest of his would-be assassins. Conan hesitates to kill Rinaldo, whose songs once deeply touched the King's heart—a scruple which costs Conan dearly, as Rinaldo manages to stab him before being finally killed.\n\nAscalante, seeing his goal within reach, moves to finish off the wounded king.

Howard. Set in the pseudo-historical Hyborian Age, it concerns several parties, including Conan, fighting over and hunting for the eponymous treasure in Hyborian Africa. The tale was first published in the March, 1935 issue of \"Weird Tales\". Howard's original title for the story was \"The Servants of Bit-Yakin\".\n\nRobert E. Howard set his story in Hyborian Africa. The \"Teeth of Gwahlur\" are legendary jewels, kept within the ancient city of Alkmeenon, in the country of Keshan \"which in itself was considered mythical by many northern and western nations\".\n\nConan, following rumors of this treasure, journeys into Keshan and offers his services in training the local army against their rival, Punt. However, Thutmekri, a Stygian thief with similar intentions, and his Shemitish partner, Zargheba, also arrive in the country with an offer for a military alliance with another of Punt's neighbors, Zembabwei, with some of the \"Teeth\" to seal their pact. The high priest of Keshan, Gorulga, announces that a decision on the matter can only be made after consulting with Yelaya, the mummified oracle of Alkmeenon. This is all the treasure hunters require. Zargheba joins Gorulga in his expedition while Conan travels ahead of them.\n\nIn the abandoned city, an initial atmosphere of the supernatural gives way to intrigue over the oracle. Zargheba has brought along a Corinthian slave girl, Muriela, to play the role of Yelaya and tell the priests to give all of their jewels to Thutmekri. Conan is at first frightened by the living oracle, but quickly discovers the ruse. Intrigue and mystery follows as the imposter and the body of the genuine oracle switch roles. Gorulga, however, is innocent in this, genuinely attempting to consult his oracle.\n\nHowever, a fourth faction quickly appears. A Pelishti traveller, Bit-Yakin, had visited the valley where Alkmeenon is located centuries ago. When the natives of Keshan visited the site to worship Yelaya as a goddess, Bit-Yakin provided prophecies from a nearby cave. Eventually, he died there; his undying servants buried him as per his instructions and, free of their master's control, brutally slaughtered any priests from Keshan who attempted to visit the city while consulting with Yelaya afterwards. Bit-Yakin's servants, revealed to be large gray-haired apes, kill the survivors of Gorulga's party after they attempt to claim the jewels. Conan manages to acquire a chest containing the jewels, but is forced to abandon his prize so he could rescue Muriela. The two escape together and Conan ends his adventure by outlining a new plan.\n\nSeveral parts of the story highlight Conan's intellect, in particular his grasp of written and spoken languages: \"In his roaming about the world the giant adventurer had picked up a wide smattering of knowledge, particularly including the speaking and reading of many alien tongues. Many a sheltered scholar would have been astonished at the Cimmerian's linguistic abilities, for he had experienced many adventures where knowledge of a strange language had meant the difference between life and death.\" Conan's polyglottery is also a plot point in Robert E. Howard's only Conan novel, \"The Hour of the Dragon\", while his literacy and knowledge were noted in the very first Conan story, \"The Phoenix on the Sword\".\n\nThe ending emphasizes Conan's chivalry and his strong tendency to save damsels in distress. Being able to save either Muriela or the chest of priceless gems which he spent months in seeking, and only seconds to make a choice, Conan without hesitation chooses to save the girl and let the treasure be irrevocably lost. \n\nThe Conan stories are ambiguous with regard to whether the various gods truly exist. In \"Black Colossus\" Mitra is quite real and unequivocally manifests himself to those who come to his shrine; conversely, in the present story all \"manifestations\" of the goddess are nothing but cynical frauds; but in L. Sprague de Camp's sequel, \"The Ivory Goddess\", the balance turns again to real and actually manifest deities. \n\nThe Conan stories take place in a fictional past, known as the Hyborian Age, but based on real places. The main country of Keshan takes its name from \"Kesh\", the Egyptian name for Nubia. Their enemy, the Land of Punt, has a similar Egyptian origin. The other nation, Zembabwei, takes its name from the ruins of Great Zimbabwe (as did the real-world country Zimbabwe 45 years after this story was published).\n\nFritz Leiber rated it among the worst Conan stories, \"repetitious and childish, a self-vitiating brew of pseudo-science, stage illusions, and the 'genuine' supernatural.\"\n\nThe collections \"King Conan\" (Gnome Press, 1953) and \"Conan the Warrior\" (Lancer Books, 1967) republished the story. It has more recently been published in the collections \"The Conan Chronicles Volume 2: The Hour of the Dragon\" (Gollancz, 2001) as \"Jewels of Gwalhur\" and \"The Conquering Sword of Conan\" (2005) under Howard's original title, \"The Servants of Bit-Yakin\".\n\nRoy Thomas and Dick Giordano adapted the story in Marvel Comic's \"Savage Sword of Conan\" magazine #25 in 1977. In 2008, that adaptation was reprinted in the trade paperback collection \"Savage Sword of Conan\" Volume 3.\n\nP. Craig Russell also adapted the story in Dark Horse comics in 2005 as a three issue mini-series and collected in 2006 as a hardcover book.\n\nAn audiobook edition was narrated by Phil Chenevert in 2013 and released by LibriVox in the public domain.\n\n"}

It is an extended version of his first doctoral dissertation, written before the author had seriously undertaken the study of mathematics. The booklet was reissued without Leibniz' consent in 1690, which prompted him to publish a brief explanatory notice in the \"Acta Eruditorum\". During the following years he repeatedly expressed regrets about its being circulated as he considered it immature. Nevertheless it was a very original work and it provided the author the first glimpse of fame among the scholars of his time.\n\nThe main idea behind the text is that of an alphabet of human thought, which is attributed to Descartes. All concepts are nothing but combinations of a relatively small number of simple concepts, just as words are combinations of letters. All truths may be expressed as appropriate combinations of concepts, which can in turn be decomposed into simple ideas, rendering\nthe analysis much easier. Therefore, this alphabet would provide a logic of invention, opposed to that of demonstration which was known so far. Since all sentences are composed of a subject and a predicate, one might\n\n\nFor this, Leibniz was inspired in the \"Ars Magna\" of Ramon Llull, although he criticized this author because of the arbitrariness of his categories and his indexing.\n\nLeibniz discusses in this work some combinatorial concepts. He had read Clavius' comments to the Tractatus de Sphaera of Sacrobosco, and some other contemporary works. He introduced the term \"variationes ordinis\" for the permutations, \"combinationes\" for the combinations of two elements, \"con3nationes\" (shorthand for \"conternationes\") for those of three elements, etc. His general term for combinations was \"complexions\". He found the formula\n\nwhich he thought was original.\n\nThe first examples of use of his ars combinatoria are taken from law, the musical registry of an organ, and the Aristotelian theory of generation of elements from the four primary qualities. But philosophical applications are of greater importance. He cites the idea of Thomas Hobbes that all reasoning is just a computation.\n\nThe most careful example is taken from geometry, from where we shall give some definitions. He introduces the Class I concepts, which are primitive.\n\n\nClass II contains simple combinations.\n\n\nWhere των means \"of the\" (from ). Thus, \"Quantity\" is the number of the parts. Class III contains the \"con3nationes\":\n\n\nThus, \"Interval\" is the space included in total. Of course, concepts deriving from former classes may also be defined.\n\n\nWhere 1/3 means the first concept of class III. Thus, a \"line\" is the interval of (between) points.\n\nLeibniz compares his system to the Chinese and Egyptian languages, although he did not really understand them at this point. For him, this is a first step towards the Characteristica Universalis, the perfect language which would provide a direct representation of ideas along with a calculus for the philosophical reasoning.\n\nAs a preface, the work begins with a proof of the existence of God, cast in geometrical form, and based on the Argument from Motion.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2265382", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2265382", "title": "Chanyuan Treaty", "text": "Chanyuan Treaty\n\nThe Chanyuan Treaty () in 1005 was the pivotal point in the relations between the Northern Song (960-1127) and the Liao Dynasties (916-1125). The ruling class of the Liao were a people of nomadic origin known as the Khitan (Qidan in Chinese) who rose in the northeast around present-day Heilongjiang Province. The Song dynasty, also referred to as the Northern Song, ruled virtually all of China from the late tenth century when it eliminated the last of the kingdoms in the north and the south that stood against Chinese unification.\n\nEarly on from the succession of the Song dynasty from the Five Dynasties in 960, relations between the Song and Liao were cordial. The Song had more important matters on their hand, namely the taking of the remaining kingdoms in the south and one in the north to reunify the realm. With that accomplished in 979, the Song turned their eyes on the Liao. The Song destroyed the Northern Han state in 979. The Northern Han was a Shatuo Turk kingdom that considered itself the legitimate successor of the Later Han dynasty that fell in 950. As it was under the protection of the Liao, it engendered some friction between the two. However, what concerned the Song even more was the continued Liao possession of the strategic Sixteen Prefectures, which included present-day Beijing.\n\nAfter the Northern Han was destroyed by the Song, the emperor decided to march on Liao holdings in the Sixteen Prefectures. The Song forces were routed and the emperor had to retreat in ignominy.\n\nThe Song once again tried in 986, this time trying to take advantage of a boy emperor on the Liao throne. The Song advanced on the Sixteen Prefectures in three columns. However, the Liao won decisive victories on all three fronts, and diplomatic relations were soon resumed. Emperor Zhenzong succeeded to the Song throne in 997. Throughout the decade, relations between the two worsened. In 999, the Liao Emperor Shengzong commenced annual attacks against the Song. While achieving victories in each, none were noteworthy. In 1004, this changed completely.\n\nEmperor Shengzong decided to launch an imperial expedition against the Song personally in the summer of 1004. He took Khitan cavalry and encamped about one hundred miles (160 kilometers) north of the Song capital of Kaifeng. Reluctantly, Emperor Zhenzong marched northward to meet the Liao at Chanyuan. He decided upon Chanyuan because it was the first large city across from the Yellow River. The emperor believed that crossing the Yellow River in an imperial expedition would have great symbolic and psychological value. The Song begun to worry that the expedition was not safe for the emperor because the Kitans were making serious advances in Hebei Circuit. To make it safer, K'ou Chun, the lead planner of the expedition, implemented defensive measures such as digging trenches. Chanyuan's defenses was weakened after heavy fighting, resulting in many thousands of casualties, including many generals. However, the arrival of the emperor raised the Song troops' morale, making the battle ever-lastingly famous.\n\nA Song giant crossbow killed the Liao Khitan leader Xiao Dalin in battle in January 1005. This led to major depression and despair among the Khitan and crippled the impetus of the Khitan offensive.\n\nFrom January 13 to January 18, 1005, the two sides worked out a peace treaty. Some sources say 1004 as it happened prior to the New Year on the Chinese lunar calendar. While the Liao initially expected a territorial concession in Kuan-nan, this demand was eventually abandoned. The specific terms of the treaty include: (1) The Song will give the Liao an annual tribute of 200,000 bolts of raw silk and 100,000 taels of silver (2) The State Finance Commission shall deliver these tributes to Hsiung-chou (3) Civilians and the military will abide by the present territorial boundaries (4) If there are robbers or bandits that flee arrest neither side shall give them refuge (5) Neither the north nor the south shall grant licenses to sow or reap furrowed fields (6) All moats and walls already in existence can be kept up but no new ones can be established (7) Neither side shall make requests outside of this treaty.\n\nThough not specifically stated in the treaty, the two imperial families used familiar terms with one another. The Khitan Emperor would address the Song Emperor as \"elder brother\", while the Song Emperor would address the Khitan Empress Dowager as \"aunt\". Despite the Song getting an arguably more prestigious position, opposition to this treaty among the Song was considerable, as it was believed that the Khitan were overexposed. Nevertheless, this treaty avoided any further major wars between the two.\n\nWang a native Kaifeng, was captured by the Kitans in 1003 at the battle of Wang-Tu. The Kitan emperor awarded Wang with official rank in the Kitan bureaucracy. Wang made the best of his circumstances and spoke with the Kitans of the advantage of resolving their conflict with the Song peacefully. The dowager empress Ch'eng-t'ien, who was in actual control of the Kitan state at the time, had grown tired of war, and she listened to Wang's proposals. With the Liao empress dowager’s approval, Wang submitted a memorial to the Song emperor through the Song prefect of Mochou, stating that the Liao court wished to restore friendly relations. So, Wang facilitated the first talks of peace between the two empires. He had inside information for both of the empires so he knew exactly what each of them wanted in return for peace so he proposed exactly that to both sides. In the end it was Wang who persuaded the empress to give up on her land claims which ultimately lead to the Chanyuan Treaty.\n\nThe signing of the Chanyuan Treaty was the first time that the Liao forced the Song, who considered themselves the natural heirs to the Central Kingdom (Zhong Yuan), to recognize them as peers. This relationship lasted until 1125, when the Song broke the treaty by inviting the Jurchens (later known as Manchus) to attack the Liao. The Jurchen attack in fact brought an end to both the Liao and the Northern Song relationship.\n\nThis treaty immediately reduced the strain on Liao finances. Politically speaking, these annual payments were used to facilitate the construction of Liao’s central capital. Peace with the Song allowed the Liao to focus more on their internal affairs and its relations with other people. So, this capital ultimately allowed the Liao to establish an international trade network. Without these annual payments from the Song it would have been highly unlikely that the Liao would have been able to create such a trading network and become the international force that they did. Economically, these payments secured the Liao a steady source of income and even helped facilitate trade with its neighbors because it now had more resources to produce goods in which they specialized in. More importantly, this treaty led to the growth of international trade along the Liao-Song border.\n\nThis treaty allowed the Song to secure disputed territory in exchange for a very minimal yearly payment. In addition now that the war was over the Song were able to focus on other matters. For one, they were able to advance their foreign diplomacy. On a different note, the Song were able to stop their military spending which was putting a serious strain on their economy. In the grand scheme of things, the yearly payments were a far less burden than the Song's military spending against the Liao.\n\nThis treaty became the basis for relations between the Song and other Inner Asian states including Western Xia and the Jin dynasty. Xi Xia incursions in the northwest (at the urging of the Liao) forced the Song to raise their payments to 300,000 bolts of silk and 200,000 ounces of silver.\n\nAlong the way there were incidents that jeopardized the peace between the Liao and Song. Basically, in 1042 the Khitans threatened to launch a military expedition against the Northern Hotung circuit in order to get the Song to increase their annual tributes to the Khitans. Then in 1076 the Song ceded the Liao a few parcels of land along the Ho-Tung border. This inevitably created a predicament because the original guidelines of the treaty made sure that the Song did not cede any territory to the Liao.\n\nThe accounts of the treaty in the Liao records and the Song records does not tally with each faction. The altering of some details shows a great deal of political boundary maintenance and an attempt at keeping dignity bias, which is prevalent in the Song dynasty faction. After the treaty was signed, the nature of the relationship between these two states changed from one of purely political rivalry to a supposed fraternal relationship. For the first time in Chinese history there were two Sons of Heaven, recognized by each other.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2265384", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2265384", "title": "Queen of the Black Coast", "text": "Queen of the Black Coast\n\n\"Queen of the Black Coast\" is one of the original short stories about Conan the Cimmerian, written by American author Robert E. Howard and first published in \"Weird Tales\" magazine c. May 1934. It's set in the pseudo-historical Hyborian Age and concerns Conan becoming a notorious pirate and plundering the coastal villages of Kush alongside Bêlit, a head-strong femme fatale.\n\nDue to its epic scope and atypical romance, the story is considered an undisputed classic of Conan lore and is often cited by Howard scholars as one of his most famous tales.\n\nHoward earned $115 for the sale of this story to \"Weird Tales\" and it is now in the public domain.\n\nThe story begins in an Argos port where Conan forcefully demands passage aboard a sail barge, the \"Argus\", which is casting off for southern waters to trade beads, silks, sugar and brass-hilted swords to the black kings of Kush. At first, the captain of the barge objects to his demand to travel without paying for the passage, and Conan threatens him and the crew with his drawn sword. But eventually the captain agrees to let Conan stay on board, since \"It would be useful to have a fighting man on the voyage\" and gradually Conan and the captain, named Tito, become quite friendly. The captain is soon informed that Conan is fleeing the civil authorities of Argos due to a court dispute in which Conan refused to betray the whereabouts of a casual friend to a magistrate and instead drew his sword and killed the magistrate - whereupon he had to swiftly flee. It is emphasized that at this moment Conan was a complete land-lubber, with no previous experience or knowledge of the sea. \n\nUpon reaching the pirate-infested waters of Kush, their trade ship is attacked by the infamous reavers led by Bêlit, the \"Queen of the Black Coast\". Bêlit and her ebony-skinned warriors slaughter the crew of the \"Argus\", who are no match for the ferocious pirates. Conan tries to rally the crew after the captain was killed, and when the fight becomes clearly hopeless he manages to jump aboard the pirate ship, intending to sell his life dearly. Conan kills many of the pirates, fully expecting to be overwhelmed and killed - whereupon Bêlit suddenly orders her crew to step back and spare Conan, being impressed with the Cimmerian's courage and ferocity (and being sexually attracted to him, as she immediately and forthrightly declares). Bêlit offers Conan the chance to sail with her, be her chosen mate, and help lead her fierce warriors. Oddly smitten by this fiery woman, Conan agrees and, for a time, they raid the Black Coast together brutally pillaging coastal towns and instilling fear into the superstitious natives.\n\nSoon, the Hyborian legends begin that the she-devil of the sea, Bêlit, has found a mate, Conan, an iron man whose wrath is that of a wounded lion. Survivors of butchered Stygian ships curse the name of Bêlit and her Cimmerian warrior with fierce blue eyes, who is given the name \"Amra\" (\"the Lion\").\n\nSailing up the poisonous waters of the river Zarkheba, Bêlit and Conan encounter ancient ruins in which is found a lost treasure, a winged monstrosity and skulking hyenas that were once men. Despite the bizarre murders of their crew and the various horrors lurking in the jungle, Bêlit and Conan still find time for a thorough theological discussion, comparing Conan's grim god Crom with Bêlit's more ambiguous Semite deities - all of which they discuss in between continuing their sexual romance which is alluded to by Howard as having sadomasochistic undertones. In a moment of passion, Bêlit promises that even death could not keep her from Conan's side, a promise which she must keep far sooner than she expects.\n\nDespite her intense love for Conan, Bêlit is soon captivated by a cursed jeweled necklace found among the lost treasure which seemingly instills the wearer with a mix of madness and monomania. In such a twisted mental state, Bêlit issues faulty orders. Given the constant bizarre dangers and her own madness, her crew is soon decimated and Bêlit herself is hanged by the winged monster. Driven to rage and now alone, Conan confronts her supernatural murderer. He is on the verge of being slain when the spirit of Bêlit intervenes. Conan slays the winged horror and leaves the ruins in Bêlit's ship with her corpse.\n\nThe story closes with Conan giving Bêlit a Viking funeral - setting on fire the ship, with her surrounded by all her treasures - and reflecting upon his loss.\n\nEverett F. Bleiler described \"Queen of the Black Coast\" as \"probably the best of the Conan stories, perhaps because it is the only one based on another emotion than lust, greed, or hatred.\"\n\nThe story was first published in the May 1934 issue of \"Weird Tales\" magazine. It was republished in the collections \"The Coming of Conan\" (Gnome Press, 1953) and \"Conan of Cimmeria\" (Lancer Books, 1969). It has most recently been republished in the collections \"The Conan Chronicles Volume 1: The People of the Black Circle\" (Gollancz, 2000) and \"\" (Del Rey, 2003).\n\n\n"}

The route runs from the M20 outside Limerick to Tralee with connecting roads to other parts of County Kerry. It is in length. It runs through the towns of Abbeyfeale, Newcastlewest, Adare and the village of Templeglantine. Prior to October 2010 the N21 also ran through the town of Castleisland. The town has recently been bypassed. Rathkeale has also been bypassed in 1992.\n\nThe N21 route commences about southwest of Limerick city, just beyond Patrickswell. At the junction, which is reached by the main M20 motorway, the N20 diverges south to Cork and the main dual-carriageway becomes the N21 west.\n\nPrior to the 2001 opening the new dual-carriageway, traffic to Kerry left the city on the old N20 in a southwest direction on the Ballinacurra Road through Raheen and then went through Patrickswell to the beginning of the N21.\n\nThe new M20/N21 dual-carriageway route begins at junction 1 on the Rosbrien Interchange as the M20 where it leaves the M7/N18 Limerick Southern Ring Road, and bypasses the Limerick suburbs of Dooradoyle, Raheen and Patrickswell, and continues, as the N21, almost to Adare. At this point the N21 becomes a standard two-lane road and flows through the main street of the scenic village.\n\nThe N21 then runs by Croagh and Rathkeale, which were bypassed in 1986 and 1992 respectively, before entering the main county town of Newcastle West and filtering through the town. Further along the route the N21 passes through Templeglantine, before going through the town of Abbeyfeale.\n\nThe road continues southwest, at the townland of Kilkinlea it crosses over the River Feale into County Kerry passing by Knocknagoshel and heading towards Castleisland. A new roadway from Abbeyfeale to Knocknagoshel, bypassing the accident-prone \"Headleys bridge\" near Knocknagoshel opened in July 2006. The remainder of the road to Castleisland was realigned in the 1980s. A section north of Casleisland was overlaid and brought up to standard in 1999.\n\nAt Castleisland, the N21 heads west to Tralee. The short N23 continues southwest to Farranfore, allowing traffic to continue south along the N22 to Killarney. A new road from Castleisland to Ballycarty near Tralee was opened in early 2001. This was followed by a new section into Tralee, opened in April 2005. The N21 terminates at Camp Roundabout on the N22/N69 Tralee Bypass which opened in August 2013.\n\nThe \"Castleisland Bypass\" was the only major national road project starting construction in 2009. Construction work completed in October 2010. The new road was officially opened on Friday, October 22, 2010, by Minister for Defence Tony Killeen. The route consists of 5.3 km of type 2 dual carriageway and connects the N21 to the N23 bypassing Castleisland to the west of the town.\n\nA section west of Newcastle West was one of the more dangerous stretches of road in the country, known locally as Barnagh, between Newcastlewest and Templeglantine and once claiming 4 lives in 4 weeks, with 5 total deaths there in 2010. A local group known as the N21 Barnagh Road Realignment Petition campaigned to realign this section.\n\nThe stretch of road was upgraded between 2011 and 2013.\n\nThe N21 is also known as a notorious traffic bottleneck particularly in the County Limerick towns of Abbeyfeale, Newcastlewest and Adare. The towns (most notably Adare) feature regularly on morning and evening traffic reports where delays of up to 30 minutes can occur. Local traffic, commuters and tourist traffic all contribute to the congestion.\n\nThe Adare bypass is in the design phase and when finished, will carry the N21 around the village of Adare, Limerick. The proposed bypass is part of the Foynes to Limerick Road Improvement Scheme; near Rathkeale the N21 will connect with the proposed Foynes to Limerick road, which itself will bypass Adare and connect with the N20 en route to Limerick.\n\nA Rathkeale/Abbeyfeale road scheme, with a bypass of Newcastle West and Abbeyfeale was at the planning stage in 2006. As of October 2008 it has not advanced beyond planning stage.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2265392", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2265392", "title": "Proselyte", "text": "Proselyte\n\nThe biblical term \"proselyte\" is an anglicization of the Koine Greek term προσήλυτος (\"proselytos\"), as used in the Septuagint (Greek Old Testament) for \"stranger\", i.e. a \"newcomer to Israel\"; a \"sojourner in the land\", and in the Greek New Testament for a first-century convert to Judaism, generally from Ancient Greek religion. It is a translation of the Biblical Hebrew phrase גר תושב (\"ger toshav\").\n\n\"Proselyte\" also has the more general meaning in English of a new convert to any particular religion or doctrine.\n\nThe Law of Moses made specific regulations regarding the admission into Israel's community of such as were not born Israelites.\n\nThe New Testament makes mention of proselytes in synagogues. The name \"proselyte\" occurs in the New Testament only in Matthew and Acts. The name by which they are commonly designated is that of \"devout men\", or men \"fearing God\", or \"worshipping God\", \"fearers of Heaven\" or \"God-fearers\".\n\nOn the historical meaning of the Greek word, in chapter 2 of the apocryphal gospel Acts of Pilate (roughly dated from 150 to 400 CE), Annas and Caiaphas define \"proselyte\" for Pilate:\n\nThere are two kinds of proselytes in Rabbinic Judaism: \"ger tzedek\" (righteous proselytes, proselytes of righteousness, religious proselyte, devout proselyte) and \"ger toshav\" (resident proselyte, proselytes of the gate, limited proselyte, half-proselyte).\n\nA \"righteous proselyte\" is a gentile who has converted to Judaism, is bound to all the doctrines and precepts of the Jewish religion, and is considered a full member of the Jewish people. The proselyte is circumcised as an adult (\"milah l'shem giur\"), if male, and immerses in a \"mikvah\" to formally effect the conversion.\n\nA \"gate proselyte\" is a resident alien who lives in the Land of Israel and follows some of the Jewish customs. They are not required to be circumcised nor to comply with the whole of the Torah. They are bound only to conform to the Seven Laws of Noah (do not worship idols, do not blaspheme God's name, do not murder, do not commit fornication (immoral sexual acts), do not steal, do not tear the limb from a living animal, and do not fail to establish rule of law) to be assured of a place in the World to come.\n\nThe \"religious proselytes\" spoken of in Early Christian writings were likely righteous proselytes rather than gate proselytes. There is some debate however as to whether proselytes known as God-fearers (Phoboumenoi) and/or Worshippers (Sebomenoi), who were baptized but not circumcised, fall into the righteous or gate category. The New Testament uses the word four times, exclusively referring to converts to Judaism, and never referring to conversion to Christianity.\n\n\n"}

A part of the China Global Television Network group, it is owned and operated by China Central Television (CCTV), a state-owned media organization of China, under the control of the Publicity Department of the Communist Party of China. The service is aimed at the overseas market, and it was launched on 25 September 2000. Coverage includes newscasts, in-depth reports, and commentary programs, as well as feature presentations. Its free-to-air satellite signal is received in over 100 countries.\n\nCGTN is registered as a foreign agent in the US. In February 2020, the United States Department of State designated CGTN and other Chinese state-owned media outlets as \"foreign missions.\"\n\nCCTV began considering English-language international news programming on 1 January 1979, at the start of China's \"Reform and opening up\" period. English news bulletins began on CCTV-2 in 1986 and became available to overseas viewers when they moved to CCTV-4 in February 1991. CCTV-9 began broadcasting across China on 25 September 2000, becoming the country's first all-English television station.\n\nOn 1 January 2003, CCTV-9 entered the United States cable market, as part of a deal that allowed AOL, Time Warner, and News Corporation access to cable systems in Guangdong. In its early years, CCTV-9 broadcast English language news bulletins and cultural interest shows for most of each day, and aired mostly reruns during the overnight hours in China. One of its biggest projects was covering the 2008 Beijing Olympics.\n\nUntil April 2010, CCTV-9 was a mixed general interest channel featuring news, travel programming, and language training. But on the 26th of that month, CCTV-9 was relaunched as a 24-hour English-language news service, and its name was changed to \"CCTV News.\"\n\nAt 04:00 London Time/12:00 Beijing Time, on 31 December 2016 the channel was relaunched as CGTN (\"China Global Television Network\"), and new programs debuted with the first programme \"Global Watch\" and first news anchored by Rachel Bubble.\n\nIn 2018 Kong Linlin, a CGTN reporter, verbally accosted a panel at the Conservative Party Conference and accused them, among other things, of being “fake Chinese.” After being asked to leave she assaulted another attendee.\n\nThe channel name of CCTV-9 was changed to CCTV News on 26 April 2010. Some shows were rebranded while other new programs were added. The English website is managed by China Network Television (CNTV), a web streaming service of CCTV. On 1 January 2011, the channel's former name CCTV-9 was taken over by CCTV's two documentary channels.\n\nWith new faces, new studios, and new equipment, the channel's upper managers said they hoped to strengthen the network's news gathering abilities, while aiming to present more perspectives from throughout China, and across Asia, to the rest of the world. The next steps in this process included hiring additional foreign correspondents and setting up a number of international bureaus.\n\nOn 6 February 2012, the channel launched \"CCTV America\" and a schedule of daily programming originating from a production center in Washington, D.C. On 11 October 2012, CCTV News launched its Africa operation in Nairobi, Kenya. CCTV News currently has three broadcast centers—Beijing (main), Nairobi, and Washington—with 70 additional bureaus across the globe.\n\nThe revamp also saw the permanent addition of news and world financial markets tickers, similar to those seen on leading news channels, although these features had already been used intermittently in the previous decade.\n\nCGTN usually airs a live news bulletin in the first half of each hour. As well as the standard news strand \"The World Today\" (which broadcasts 15 times a day, 7 days a week), there are specialist bulletins focusing on Chinese and Asian news, such as \"China 24\" and business news (with regional variations) \"Global Business\". Programming in the second half of each hour includes, sports bulletins, a travel show called Travelogue which takes viewers to destinations around China and the world, and magazines covering the arts, science and sports.\n\nThe news programs on CGTN include \"Africa Live\", \"Americas Now\" and \"Asia Today\", providing comprehensive news coverage that caters to the respective continents. \"The Link\" is a mix of the three aforementioned programs, though it still has an international appeal. \"Global Watch\" features a Chinese perspective on the news. Specialized programs include \"New Money\", \"Matchpoint\", \"Global Business\", \"Culture Express\" and \"Sports Scene\", providing news and information on business, finance, economics, culture, and sports. Shows such as \"Dialogue\" and \"World Insight\" extend balanced and critical perspectives on current affairs affecting all corners of the globe.\n\nCGTN also provides programs on culture, history, and modern society of China and Asia. In \"Crossover\", hosts and guests of various backgrounds and experiences talk about issues throughout China. \"Travelogue\" is the ticket to dynamic and exciting landscapes in China and abroad. \"Rediscovering China\" explores contemporary Chinese and Asian culture and social changes through the eyes of international visitors. Finally, \"Faces of Africa\" delivers African human interest stories.\n\nThe Chinese staff members at CGTN English range in experience from interns to media professionals with years in the business. Executive producers, producers and senior news anchors typically have higher education, often from universities in other countries. By 2007, the channel had about 300 staff members, of whom 70 were full-time with about 30 foreigners on contract. Ahead of the channel's 2010 relaunch, it began to hire foreign correspondents based in countries around the world, and in 2011 CCTV News started to hire English-speaking Chinese reporters based in 30 provincial bureaus across China.\n\nIn addition to Chinese anchors, CGTN employs foreigners as news presenters, some of whom have extensive experience, such as Edwin Maher (a former newsreader and weatherman from the Australian Broadcasting Corporation), while others may be recent university graduates just embarking upon their careers.\n\nFormer comptroller Jiang Heping defended the policy of putting foreigners on air, arguing that \"we feel international on-air personalities boost the credibility of CGTN and befit its image as an international channel. In this regard, CGTN will not restrict the origin of its employees and choose to build its unique identity through its programming.\"\n\nThe first foreign news anchor on what was then known as CCTV-9 was Chris Gelken, who joined the channel from Hong Kong's TVB and presented the 30-minute business show, \"BizChina.\" Gelken left CCTV News in 2005, and returned to TVB from 2010 to 2013.\n\nAnother prominent personality in CCTV-9's first decade was Mark Rowswell, otherwise known as Dashan. He hosted \"Travel in Chinese\" on CCTV News and has been honored for his work in promoting cancer awareness in China.\n\nIn addition to those individuals, the channel later recruited Phillip Yin of Bloomberg Television, and Mike Walter from USA Today, to helm Biz Asia America and The Heat, respectively, when the Washington bureau opened in 2012.\n\nThe weather on CGTN is hosted by a rotating cast of presenters, so the staff changes on a frequent basis, partially because these updates are produced by an outside company which supplies content for several English-language media outlets around China.\n\nThe regions division which runs the bureau is listed in brackets after the city. Bureaus in China are not listed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCCTV Africa is China Central Television's news productions center which was launched in Kenya on 11 January 2012. CGTN Africa focuses on African news and perspectives as well as international news.\n\nCGTN Africa is responsible for newsgathering and task assignments on the African continent. CGTN Africa initially produce a one-hour program every day, including Africa news, Talk Africa and Face of Africa editions, and broadcast through CGTN's English news channel.\n\nCGTN America is the Americas division of CGTN the English-language news channel run by Chinese state broadcaster China Central Television. It is based in Washington, DC and runs bureaus across North and South America. The service employs a mix of American and Chinese journalists and produces Americas-based programming for CGTN and CCTV.\n\nCGTN America is led by director general Ma Jing with veteran Asia journalist Jim Laurie as executive consultant. It began broadcasting on 6 February 2012.\n\n\n\nIn 2010, the CCTV-NEWS won the National Window award at 2010's Hot Bird TV awards.\n\nThe channel's Washington, DC based broadcast center, CGTN America, has won a News & Documentary Emmy for \"Jen Bricker: When Can't is a Four-Letter Word\", and has also won multiple New York Festivals medals and White House News Photographers Association awards.\n\nDespite its revamp launching of CCTV America, critics have voiced concerns over the level of self-censorship exercised by the channel, especially on sensitive domestic issues in China. Philip Cunningham of Cornell University, who has appeared more than 100 times on China Central Television talk shows said sensitive issues such as Tibet and Xinjiang were heavily edited on various programs.\nMa Jing, Director of CCTV America defends such allegation by saying that the channel edits stories the same way other news organizations do. She said: \"We uphold the traditional journalistic values. We consider accuracy, objectivity, truthfulness, and public accountability very important, more important than anything else.\"\n\nThe UK's Ofcom is inquiring into alleged state bias over its coverage of the Hong Kong protests since September 2019.\n\nOn 23 November 2018, a British corporate investigator named Peter Humphrey submitted a formal complaint to the United Kingdom's government communications regulator The Office of Communications, or Ofcom, maintaining he was forced under duress to confess on air over Chinese state broadcaster China Central Television's (CCTV) network and that, as the confession was subsequently broadcast over the international arm of CCTV, China Global Television Network (CGTN), CGTN itself should be held culpable by Ofcom and denied the right to operate its broadcast service in the U.K. Humphrey's complaint cited two films produced by CCTV and additionally aired in the UK by CGTN, stating that both were scripted and directed by the Chinese police, the public security bureau, while he was a prisoner, in conditions of duress amounting to torture. One such confession, staged in August 2013, was filmed by a CCTV crew with Humphrey locked in an iron chair inside a steel cage, wearing handcuffs and an orange prison vest. This was before he had been indicted, tried or convicted of a crime. The second, in July 2014, was once again filmed by CCTV, not in a cage this time, but still in a prison vest and handcuffs, before he had been tried or convicted on the charge of illegal information gathering.\nReportedly Ofcom has said it is investigating the complaint and would \"take necessary enforcement action\" if rules are determined to have been violated.\n\nIn November 2019, CGTN aired a video of a UK consular employee, Simon Cheng, in captivity \"confessing\" to consorting with prostitutes. Within a week, Cheng had filed a new complaint to Ofcom.\n\nDuring President Xi Jinping's tour of state media outlets in February 2016, he emphasized that they must “speak for the Party,” and, further, that they must expand their influence abroad in order to “tell China’s story to the world.” \"The Guardian\"'s Louisa Lim and Julia Bergin wrote that while the \"[China] Communist Party has always maintained a tight grip over domestic media, their strategy has shifted in recent years to spread that control globally\", by \"exerting their influence on media abroad, through a multifaceted approach that includes offering generous salary packages to recruit talented journalists away from local media in Africa, Latin America, and elsewhere; buying advertising supplements in mainstream foreign publications; buying foreign media companies outright; and making deals with local broadcasters in Africa and elsewhere to spread their content in local markets\". One result of the China Communist Party's international media strategy has been the elimination of the independent Chinese-language media outlets in the United States, \"through a mix of co-option and aggressive expansion of its own competitors\". Alongside their international media strategy, the Chinese Communist Party has also stepped up the use of \"Pro-Beijing trolls -- the so-called 50-cent army, named for the price they are supposedly paid for each post\" plus the \"state-backed media and botnets [who] have been employed to pump out huge quantities of disinformation and misinformation\" on social media platforms like Twitter.\n\nCGTN initially claimed that it had “editorial independence from any state direction or control”. This was debunked by \"New York Times\" reporter Paul Mozur in interviews with \"current and former CGTN employees [who] say CCTV editors in Beijing often dictated plans for covering China. American employees sometimes pushed back, they said, and Ms. Ma allowed some flexibility when Beijing’s orders didn’t specifically forbid or dictate content. But three people interviewed said they had little choice but to air propaganda clips when Beijing said so\". CGTN employees were disciplined when a news report mentioned Falun Gong, the religious group labeled as a cult and banned by the PRC. The flag of Taiwan, the self-governing island that is claimed by PRC, are banned from broadcasts. In November 2018, amid growing international criticism of China's imprisonment of hundreds of thousands of Muslim Uighurs in indoctrination camp programs designed to discourage Islam, CGNT America aired a pro-Beijing documentary portraying the camps as successful vocational training and antiterrorism centers and Uighurs as grateful. In addition, CGTN America has broadcast \"exclusive\" coerced confessions of people accused of a wide variety of crimes in China, most notably the example of a Briton, Peter Humphrey. In addition, some CGTN journalists \"recall being asked to cross a sometimes blurred line between news reporting and intelligence gathering as they were asked to report on high-level government meetings\". International observers noted that while RT (formerly Russia Today) aims to divide its audience with controversial content, the \"aim [of CGTN] is to influence public opinion overseas in order to nudge foreign governments into making policies favourable towards China’s Communist party\" through more subtle means.\n\nThe United States Department of State characterised \"CGTN America’s relationship with a foreign government and a foreign political party as one of interest to Washington\". The United States Department of Justice was concerned about an \"expanding influence campaign being waged by Beijing through the global arms of state media outlets\" like CGTN and Xinhua News Agency. In putting pressure upon Xinhua and CGTN, a senior US official noted that US grievances towards the lack of reciprocity from Beijing on trade and media access as many American and international news outlets are blocked in China. CGTN America said in its filings stamped Feb. 1 2019 that it disagreed with the Justice Department's decision, but has registered as a foreign agent under the Foreign Agent Registration Act. While this permits them to continue operating in the United States, they are required to disclose information about their annual budget and ownership structure, while also including disclaimers on broadcasts, published materials and social media identifying themselves as registered foreign agents. After registering with the FARA, CGTN America director general Ma Jing and a dozen other staffers were recalled to Beijing.\n\nOn 18 September 2019, Nick Pollard, a veteran British TV executive, resigned from his post as consultant and advisor to CGTN, giving his reason for leaving as being CGTN's failure to comply with Ofcom's rules on impartiality in connection to its coverage of the Hong Kong anti-extradition bill protests. He had joined CGTN in December 2018.\n\n\n"}

None of the original movie cast appear in the radio show.\n\nThe movie's producer Dean Devlin gave Dirk Maggs permission to produce an original radio adaptation provided that he did not reveal certain details of the movie's plot, and that he did not depict the British as saving the day. Maggs wrote, produced and directed the programme, with Devlin credited as \"Creative Consultant\".\n\nIn order to achieve authentic aircraft sounds, Maggs' crew recorded actual aircraft and cockpit interior sounds at an RAF base.\n\nThe programme's tagline is, \"It's the Battle of Britain all over again, but this time our enemies aren't just unstoppable. They're \"inhuman\"\".\n\nThe drama was subsequently released on audio cassette by Polygram.\n\nAfter a brief Orson Welles-style opening announcement, recalling Welles' notorious radio adaptation of \"The War of the Worlds\", the programme begins with a 20th Century Fox fanfare. The first 25 minutes take the form of a live \"UFO watch\" broadcast hosted by Radio 1 DJ Nicky Campbell and veteran TV astronomer Patrick Moore (of \"The Sky at Night\") aboard an RAF Sentry aircraft. Campbell and Moore and the RAF crew deliver authentic reactions to the news that a large object is approaching the Earth. The object is subsequently revealed to be an alien spacecraft.\n\nWhen the alien mothership disgorges dozens of smaller ships that take up position over the world's cities, the broadcast switches to a press conference called by Prime Minister John Major and Opposition Leader Tony Blair to announce the formation of an emergency coalition government. DJ Mark Goodier reports from a rooftop on the alien ship's approach to London until it fires its weapon and the broadcast goes silent.\n\nAfter a brief pause the story continues in Maggs' trademark \"audio movie\" style, with original music from the film and sound effects and dialogue in Dolby Surround.\n\nAboard the RAF Sentry, Moore and Campbell are shocked to learn that London has been destroyed. The alien ships launch fighters and the RAF Tornado pilots John Reginald and Becky Johnson engage them.\n\nMoore draws upon his vast scientific knowledge to advise the pilots on how to combat - or at least evade - the aliens.\n\nThe fighters are then called upon to defend a BBC traffic helicopter that is attempting to carry the British Royal Family to safety.\n\nThe RAF succeed in bringing down one of the alien fighters, and Moore has a close (and given his age, surprisingly violent) encounter with the alien pilot. Meanwhile, Wing Commander Reginald engages the aliens in a prototype Eurofighter.\n\nAt the end of the show we learn that the Royal Family are safe and have invited Becky - a staunch republican - for tea at Balmoral. The surviving military forces of Europe and the Middle East are preparing to regroup in the Beqaa Valley. One of the RAF men comments that \"when this is all over and we've defeated these monsters, the Yanks'll take the credit for it, you wait and see.\"\n\n\n\n"}

Margaret Diana Hopetoun Chetwynd. In childhood, Henry Birkin gained the nickname \"Tim\", after the children's comic book character Tiger Tim, created by Julius Stafford Baker, who was extremely popular at the time. It was his nickname for the rest of his life.\n\nBirkin married Audrey Clara Lilian Latham, daughter of Sir Thomas Paul Latham, 1st Bt. and Florence Clara Walley, on 12 July 1921; they divorced in 1928. \nHe and Audrey had two daughters, Pamela and Sara, both of whom married and had issue. The elder daughter Pamela (d. 1983) married two Buxton cousins in succession, and her second husband was the Life Peer Baron Buxton of Alsa, KCVO, MC. She had seven children including wildlife film-maker Cindy Buxton. The younger daughter Sara (d. 1976) married twice, and had two sons by her first husband..\n\nAt his death in 1933, without sons of his own, he was succeeded by his next surviving male relative, his paternal uncle Sir Alexander Russell Birkin, 4th Baronet (died 1942). His younger brother, Archie Birkin, was killed during practice for the 1927 Isle of Man TT motorcycle races.\n\nBirkin joined the Royal Flying Corps during World War I and gained the rank of Lieutenant in the service of the 108th (Norfolk and Suffolk Yeomanry) Field Brigade, serving in Palestine where he contracted malaria, a disease from which he would suffer for the rest of his life.\n\nIn 1921 Birkin turned to motor racing, competing in a few races at Brooklands. Business and family pressures then forced him to retire from the tracks until 1927 when he entered a three-litre Bentley for a six-hour race. For 1928 he acquired a 4½ litre car and after some good results decided to return to motor racing, very much against his family's wishes. Soon Birkin, racing with a blue and white spotted silk scarf around his neck, would be a familiar sight on the race tracks driving with the works team (the \"Bentley Boys\"). In 1928 Birkin entered the Le Mans race again, leading the first twenty laps until a jammed wheel forced him to drop back, finishing fifth with co-driver Jean Chassagne who heroically rescued the abandoned, damaged car, winning the hearts of the crowds; Chassagne received a trophy from W O Bentley in recognition of this extraordinary feat.\n\nThe next year Birkin was back as winner, racing the \"Speed Six\" as co-driver to Woolf Barnato. If Bentley wanted a more powerful car he developed a bigger model and the Speed Six was a huge car. Ettore Bugatti once referred to the Bentley as \"\"the world's fastest lorry\"\" (\"Le camion plus vite du monde\"). Back in 1928 however, Birkin had come to the conclusion that the future lay in getting more power from a lighter model by fitting a supercharger to the 4½ litre Bentley. When Bentley Motors refused to create the supercharged model Birkin sought he determined to develop it himself. With technical help from Clive Gallop and supercharger specialist Amherst Villiers, and with Dorothy Paget financing the project after his own money had run out, Birkin rebuilt the car at the engineering works he had set up for the purpose at Welwyn Garden City in Hertfordshire. Adding a huge Roots-type supercharger (\"blower\") in front of the radiator driven straight from the crankshaft gave the car a unique appearance. The 242 bhp \"blower Bentley\" was born.\n\nThe first car, a stripped down Brooklands racer known as Bentley Blower No.1, first appeared at the Essex six hour race at Brooklands on 29 June 1929. However, the car initially proved to be very unreliable. W.O. Bentley himself had never accepted the blower Bentley. Nevertheless, with Wolf Barnato's support, Birkin persuaded \"W.O.\" to produce the fifty supercharged cars necessary for the model to be accepted for the Le Mans twenty-four-hour race. In addition to these production cars built by Bentley Motors, Birkin put together a racing team of four remodelled \"prototypes\" (three road cars for Le Mans and Blower No.1) and assembled a fifth car from spare parts. Birkin's blower Bentleys were too late for Le Mans in 1929 and only two of the cars reached the start line in 1930. After an epic duel between Dudley Benjafield and Birkin's privately entered blower Bentleys and Rudolf Caracciola's Mercedes SSK all three retired, leaving the victory to the Bentley works team Speed Six of Barnato and Glen Kidston. Birkin's courage and fearless driving, in particular his selflessly harrying Caracciola into submission, are regarded as embodying the true spirit of the Vintage Racing era.\n\nBack in 1925 the energetic motor sports enthusiast Eugène Azemar, who was involved with the Tourist Board in Saint-Gaudens in southern France, succeeded in persuading the Automobile Club du Midi to arrange a Grand Prix race in the region. A great success, the Saint-Gaudens track later got the honor of hosting the 1928 French Grand Prix. If they can, so can we, thought the city council in the nearby town of Pau and decided to try to take the French Grand Prix to their own town. Pau had some Grand Prix traditions, as the town held the honour of arranging the first race ever to be called a Grand Prix back in 1901. For the 1930 Grand Prix a triangular, Le Mans-type track outside the city was selected. Known as the Circuit de Morlaas it should not be confused with the well-known street track in the Parque Beaumont. The French had hoped to run the race to the International Formula, but when the response was poor the event was postponed and changed to a Formula Libre event instead. The new date meant that the Italian teams were unable to attend, leaving it to be mostly an internal French affair with sixteen Bugattis, two Peugeots and a Delage among the twenty five starters. Among the top Bugatti drivers were Louis Chiron, Marcel Lehoux, Count Stanislas Czaikowski, Jean-Pierre Wimille, Philippe Étancelin and William Grover-Williams.\n\nA curiosity in the largely single-seat entry list was Tim Birkin's blower Bentley touring car, stripped down to racing trim, with headlights and mudguards removed. The race distance was twenty five laps of the 15.8 km track, making a total of 396 km. Guy Bouriat took an early lead, followed by Williams, Zanelli, Czaikowski and Étancelin, with Birkin as first non-Bugatti driver, in sixth place. Williams in a works Bugatti then became the next leader. Czaikowski fell back through the field and Bouriat in the other works Bugatti made a pitstop giving over the car to Chiron. Then Williams also had to make a stop for a new wheel. That all made way for Étancelin to advance and he was followed by Birkin, the track with its long straights suiting the supercharged Bentley perfectly.\n\nAt one-third distance Chiron led, followed by Étancelin, Williams and Birkin. Birkin's fourth place became a third as Williams got engine troubles but then Zanelli, who had made an early stop, came rushing through the field pushing Birkin back to fourth. At lap ten \"Sabipa\" crashed and was thrown out of his Bugatti, Birkin only avoiding the injured driver by the slightest of margins. After eleven laps Chiron encountered problems with oil pressure and Étancelin took over the lead. Soon Chiron was also passed by Zanelli and Birkin. The Bentley driver used his horn to warn the Bugatti to move over, surely a unique occurrence in Grand Prix racing! With seven laps to go Zanelli made another pitstop and Birkin was up into second place. While Étancelin, with a 2.5 minute lead, nursed his Bugatti home to take victory, Zanelli had not given up and was catching Birkin fast. At the flag the margin was down to fourteen seconds but it was enough for the British Bentley driver to make Grand Prix history.\n\nBirkin's life changed dramatically at the end of 1930. Bentley Motors withdrew from racing and closed down the following year. (Although purchased by Rolls-Royce the marque did not reappear for several years.) Dorothy Paget withdrew her support for Birkin's road team in October 1930. She continued however to support Birkin's red single seater track car, the original Blower No.1. The car (nicknamed the Brooklands Battleship) had been re-bodied with a single shell by Reid Railton after its lightweight fabric two seater body had caught fire in the 1929 500 mile race due to a cracked exhaust. Birkin kept his motor workshop going by entering into a partnership with Mike Couper and developing a business specialising in tuning high performance cars. In addition, an \"electric model Brooklands\" — an elaborate miniature racetrack game with motorized cars running on single rails — was manufactured at the works. Birkin's partnership with Couper came to an end in 1932 however and the works closed.\n\nBirkin continued racing despite these setbacks. In 1931 he won Le Mans with Earl Howe in an Alfa Romeo, even receiving a telegram from Mussolini congratulating him on his \"win for Italy\". On 24 March 1932 he raised the Brooklands Outer Circuit lap record to 137.96 mph in the Brooklands Battleship, a record which stood for another two years before being beaten by John Cobb driving the 24 litre Napier Railton. On 7 May 1933 he started the Tripoli Grand Prix in a new 3 L Maserati 8C owned by fellow driver Bernard Rubin, finishing third. During his pit stop Birkin burnt his arm badly against the hot exhaust pipe while picking up a cigarette lighter. There are different opinions of what then happened. The traditional view is that the wound turned septic, whilst others say Birkin suffered from a malaria attack. It was probably a combination of both that proved fatal, as Birkin died at Countess Carnavon Nursing Home in London 22 June 1933, aged thirty-six.\n\nBirkin's life was portrayed in the 1995 TV drama \"Full Throttle\" with comedian Rowan Atkinson in the role of Birkin.\n\nIn 2000, the last 54 of the Bentley Arnage Green label powered cars were created as a limited edition, called \"The Birkin Arnage.\" German aftermarket tuner MTM have latterly produced a tuned version of the Bentley Continental GT called \"The Birkin Edition,\" producing 641 hp.\n\nBirkin House, a Victorian country guest house in Stinsford, Dorchester, is named after Birkin.\n\nThe artist Terence Cuneo unveiled his painting The 'Spirit of Brooklands,' which shows Tim Birkin racing John Cobb (racing driver) as the result of a wager, three laps of Brooklands to win. Cobb drove a ten and a half litre Delage, once holder of the land speed record, and Birkin his four and a half supercharged Bentley, the 'Brooklands Battleship.' The higher top speed of the Bentley gave Birkin the edge over the distance, and the painting depicts Birkin on the outside line of the high banking edging past Cobb to win. The actual race had taken place in the August Bank Holiday of 1932, and Birkin had won by 25 yards after a third lap at 137 mph.\n\n\n"}

Howard and first published in \"Weird Tales\" magazine, v. 25, nos. 5-6, May-June 1935. The story was republished in the collections \"King Conan\" (Gnome Press, 1953) and \"Conan the Warrior\" (Lancer Books, 1967). It has more recently been published in the anthology \"The Mighty Swordsmen\" (Lancer Books, 1970), and the collections \"The Conan Chronicles Volume 2: The Hour of the Dragon\" (Gollancz, 2001) and \"\" (Del Rey, 2005). It's set in the pseudo-historical Hyborian Age and concerns Conan's battle against a savage tribe of Picts in the unsettled lands beyond the infamous Black River.\n\nThe story takes place in Conajohara, a newly established Aquilonian province recently annexed by King Numedides from the Picts. Balthus, a young settler on his way to Fort Tuscelan at the Black River, the province's border to the Pict Lands, encounters Conan in the forest slaying a marsh devil. Accompanying the young man back to the fort, Conan finds the corpse of a merchant left by a Pictish wizard named Zogar Sag and slain by a swamp demon. The fort's commander, Valannus, desperately asks Conan to slay Zogar Sag before he raises the Picts against the whole borderlands, especially since Tuscelan is vastly undermanned after Numedides foolishly decided to withdraw most of its garrison. Taking a hand-picked team of scouts and Balthus, Conan sets off stealthily in his canoe.\nSoon, Balthus is captured and most of Conan's men are slaughtered in an ambush. Balthus and one of the scouts are tied to stakes in a Pictish village, and soon the scout is sacrificed by Zogar Sag to one of his jungle creatures. Before Balthus can meet a similar fate, Conan sets the village on fire, and the two flee into the forest. Conan tells Balthus information on the cult of Jhebbal Sag, now forgotten by most. Once all living creatures worshipped him when men and beasts spoke the same language. Over time, both men and beasts forgot his worship. Zogar Sag has not, however, and can control those few animals and creatures who also remember, sending them on Conan's trail.\n\nConan is able to fend off the pursuing beasts using a symbol he once noticed, and the pair return to the Fort to warn everyone of an impending Pictish assault, but they are too late. The Picts have already surrounded the fort, and a fierce battle is going on. The number of Picts ensures that eventually the fort will be overwhelmed and the defenders slaughtered. The only thing left to do is warn the settlers to flee while the Picts are busy with the fort - otherwise they will be slaughtered, too. \n\nThe two soldiers go to warn everyone that an army of Picts have crossed the river and are about to attack. They are joined by Slasher, a feral dog formerly owned by a settler who had been slain by the Picts. Balthus is sent on to warn the settlers of an incoming raid, and Conan parts from him to aid a group of fishermen who had gone to gather salt. Balthus warns the women and children to leave their huts and flee. When a band of Picts arrive, who move quicker and might overtake the women, Balthus stays behind to cover their escape. Accompanied by Slasher, he makes his last stand against the coming Pictish raiders, first shooting arrows from concealment and then in a furious face-to-face battle. Both Balthus and Slasher's sacrifice delays the Picts, giving the settlers time to reach safety. Conan manages to warn the salt-gathering party in time, but finds he has been marked for death by the gods of darkness for misusing the symbol of Jhebbal Sag, and is attacked by a demonic creature who tells him that it and Zogar Sag are of one blood. Conan triumphs against the creature, but the fort is lost, and so is the entire province.\n\nThe story ends in a tavern on the other side of Thunder River, the former boundary between the Pict Lands and Aquilonia. A sole survivor from Tuscelan tells Conan about the courageous act of Balthus and Slasher. He also relates that in the midst of his victory at Tuscelan, Zogar Sag was mysteriously struck dead, sporting the same kind of wounds Conan had inflicted on the swamp demon. Upon hearing of Balthus and Slasher's demise, Conan vows to take the heads of ten Picts to pay for Balthus, along with seven heads for the dog, who was \"a better warrior than many a man\".\n\nAs Conan turns back to his drink, the survivor mutters, \"Barbarism is the natural state of mankind. Civilization is unnatural; it is a whim of circumstance... And barbarism must always ultimately triumph!\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2265413", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2265413", "title": "The Hour of the Dragon", "text": "The Hour of the Dragon\n\nThe Hour of the Dragon, also known as Conan the Conqueror, is a fantasy novel by American writer Robert E. Howard featuring his sword and sorcery hero Conan the Cimmerian. It was one of the last Conan stories published before Howard's suicide, although not the last to be written. The novel was first published in serial form in the December, 1935 through April, 1936 issues of the pulp magazine \"Weird Tales\". The first book edition was published by Gnome Press in hardcover in 1950. The Gnome Press edition retitled the story \"Conan the Conqueror\", a title retained by all subsequent editions until 1977, when the original title was restored in an edition issued published by Berkley/Putnam in 1977. The Berkley edition also reverted the text to that of its original \"Weird Tales\" publication, discarding later edits. Later editions have generally followed Berkley and published under the original title. The 1997 film \"Kull the Conqueror\" is loosely based on \"The Hour of the Dragon\", replacing Conan with Kull but otherwise keeping the same basic plot.\n\nThe plot is a loosely based on a melange of motifs from previous Conan short stories, most notably \"The Scarlet Citadel\", with which its early chapters shares an almost identical storyline: Conan, captured and placed in a monster-infested dungeon, finds an unexpected ally and escapes. Meanwhile, the population of the Aquilonian capital, believing him dead, riots and is ready to accept an alternative King. From here the two diverge: \"The Scarlet Citadel\", a short story, ends with Conan coming back when the rioting just started and making short work of his foes; in the book-length \"Hour of the Dragon\" it's much more complicated, Aquilonia has to live under a long and harrowing foreign occupation while Conan goes through a long hazardous quest, before he could finally come back and dispose of his foes.\n\nThe book begins when Conan is about forty-two, during his reign as the King of Aquilonia, and deals with a plot by a group of conspirators to depose him in favor of Valerius, heir to Conan's predecessor Numedides, whom he had slain to gain the throne. To accomplish this they resort to necromancy, resurrecting Xaltotun, an ancient sorcerer from the forgotten empire of Acheron. With his aid, the Aquilonian army is defeated by the rival kingdom of Nemedia and occupied. Conan, captured, is slated for execution until a sympathetic slave girl, Zenobia, risks her life to free him.\n\nConan's quest to retrieve the Heart of Ahriman in order to defeat the wizard and regain his throne takes him through all the kingdoms of the Hyboria Age.\n\nAfter his eventual triumph, he vows to make Zenobia his queen.\n\nIt was Howard's only full-length novel about Conan, and is considered by many to be one of his best works. It was originally written for British publisher Dennis Archer and was submitted to them in May 1934. Archer had turned down a collection of works in 1933 but made the suggestion of a novel. However, the publisher went bankrupt before the novel could be printed and it was held by the Official Receiver.\n\nThe story was first published as a five-part serial in \"Weird Tales\" between the months of December 1935 to April 1936 (with chapter 20 being misprinted as chapter 21). It was first published in book form in hardcover by Gnome Press in 1950 under the title \"Conan the Conqueror\", a title retained by all later editions until 1977. The first paperback edition was published by Ace Books in 1954. The novel has been reissued a number of times since by various publishers, notably Lancer Books in 1967 and Berkley/Putnam in 1977; the latter, reedited by Karl Edward Wagner, was the first edition to restore the original magazine text and title, under which most subsequent editions have been issued. Donald M. Grant, Publisher, Inc. published an edition in 1989, with illustrations by Ezra Tucker, as volume XI of their deluxe Conan set. More recently the novel appeared in the collections \"The Essential Conan\" (1998), \"Conan Chronicles Volume 2: The Hour of the Dragon\" (2001) and \"\" (Del Rey, 2005). It has also been translated into Japanese, Italian, Finnish, French, German, Swedish, Czech, Russian, Sinhalese, and Spanish.\n\nIn the hardcover Gnome Press edition of the Conan stories, \"Conan the Conqueror\" follows the short stories collected as \"King Conan\"; in the paperback Lancer/Ace edition, it follows the short stories collected as \"Conan the Usurper\". In both editions it precedes the Björn Nyberg/L. Sprague de Camp novel \"The Return of Conan\" (also known as \"Conan the Avenger\").\n\nReviewing the Gnome Press edition, Groff Conklin found the novel to have \"real merit\" considered as an imaginative work, but characterized Howard's writing as \"only average [and] laden with bombast\". He recommended the book to \"those who like to lean back and read with their minds closed\". L. Sprague de Camp, acknowledging that Howard was \"an almost-very-good writer . . . with limiting quirks,\" praised the novel as \"a sanguinary combination of sorcery, skulduggery, and swordplay.\"\n\nIn 1974, the story was adapted by Roy Thomas, Gil Kane and John Buscema in Marvel Comic's \"Giant-Size Conan\" #1-4 and \"Savage Sword of Conan\" #8, 10. The lead story in \"Giant-Size Conan\" #1 was a 25-page chapter from \"The Hour of the Dragon\". The plan was to adapt the novel over the first six issues, but \"Giant-Size Conan\" #4 was the last full color chapter. The story was concluded in the black & white magazine \"Savage Sword of Conan\" #8 and #10.\n\nA number of amateur audiobook editions exist, including one narrated by Morgan Saletta (2009-2010) released as part of SF Audio's Second Book Challenge; and one narrated by Mark Nelson for LibriVox (2013). There is an eight and half hour professional commercial reading available under the title of \"The Bloody Crown of Conan\" (originally Trantor, 2009, now available through Audible).\n\nThe 1997 film \"Kull the Conqueror\" is loosely based on \"The Hour of the Dragon\", replacing Conan with Kull but keeping the basic plot of a barbarian king being removed from his throne by the machinations of an undead sorcerer.\n\nIn 2012, Dark Horse began a new comic series called \"Conan the Conqueror\"; the first stories are an adaptation of \"The Hour of the Dragon\"\n\n"}

Thus, the Queen's Colleges became derided as the \"godless colleges\" — Pope Pius IX even ventured as far as declaring them to be \"detrimental to religion\" in an official condemnation. This non-acceptance was articulated in the creation of a rival to the Queen's Colleges — the Catholic University of Ireland in Dublin.\nIn 1845 the Mayor of Limerick applied to have a Queen's College located in the city; however Cork, Galway and Belfast were chosen.\n\nThe colleges were incorporated on 30 December 1845; and on 30 October 1849 they opened for students. A \"Board of Queen's Colleges\" was created to draw up regulations for the colleges, consisting of the President and Vice-President of each college.\n\nAcademic degrees were conferred by the chancellor and senate of the university with a status similar to those of other universities of the former United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.\n\nIn 1866 the university considered examining and conferring degrees on students other than those of the Queen's colleges, such as the Catholic Carlow College the \"St. Patricks College Carlow Report\" was conducted and the college was deemed to meet the suitable, however it was never enacted.\n\nThe Queen's College at Belfast became predominantly Protestant, unlike the colleges at Cork and Galway.\n\nA number of significant figures in Irish public life participated in the governing senate of the university such as Sir Dominic Corrigan (Vice-Chancellor). Naturalist Robert Ball became secretary of Queen's University of Ireland in 1851.\n\nThe Queen's University was superseded by a new, inclusive, degree-awarding institution, the Royal University of Ireland in 1880. The Queen's University was formally dissolved on 3 February 1882. Immediately on incorporation, the Royal University broke with the \"“godless\"\" convention, by setting examinations for, and awarding degrees to students of colleges with a religious heritage, notably Magee Presbyterian College, and the Catholic University of Ireland (that included St. Patrick's College, Maynooth and University College Dublin.)\n\nThe Belfast college was separated from the other two in 1908, and became the Queen's University Belfast (QUB). Queen's College, Cork is now known as \"University College Cork (UCC)\", while Queen's College Galway is now known as \"NUI Galway\".

It is set in the pseudo-historical Hyborian Age, and concerns Conan inadvertently becoming involved in the struggle between two powerful men fighting for control of a city-state. It was the seventh Conan story Howard had published. It is famous for the fight scene between Conan and an ape, often known as the cover by artist Frank Frazetta.\n\n\nThe story begins in an unnamed city-state between Zamora and Corinthia during a power struggle between two powerful leaders: Murilo, an aristocrat, and Nabonidus the \"Red Priest\", a clergyman with a strong power base. After he is delivered a written threat by Nabonidus, Murilo learns of Conan's reputation as a mercenary and turns to him for help.\n\nPrior to the story's beginning, Conan kills a corrupt priest of Anu, who was both a fence and police informer. However, Conan was arrested after he became intoxicated and a prostitute turned him in. Languishing in a jail cell while awaiting his execution, Conan receives Murilo's visit and is proposed a bargain: in exchange for setting him free and getting him out of Corinthia with a bag of gold, Conan will assassinate Nabonidus.\n\nAfter accepting his offer, Conan is given food and wine by Murilo. However, while he's consuming a roasted duck, the jailer who should release Conan when Murilo has left (thus with an alibi) is arrested on unrelated corruption charges (corruption seems to run rampant in the city). Soon, his replacement is flabbergasted to see a prisoner awaiting execution while chomping down on a slice of beef. As he's entering the cell to confiscate it, Conan splits the man's skull with the very bone he was gnawing on and makes his escape.\n\nFor a while, he considers leaving Murilo on his own, but then decides to follow the original plan and keep his word.\n\nAfter taking revenge on the prostitute who turned him in (he slays her new lover and throws the woman into a foul cesspit), Conan sneaks into Nabonidus' trap-filled mansion. However, he finds that Murilo and Nabonidus himself are being held captive by a mysterious third party who took control of Nabonidus' position while impersonating him. This turns out to be Thak, a primitive ape-like creature who Nabonidus had captured as a cub and trained as his personal bodyguard. The three observe Thak, via a series of hidden periscopes, and see that the creature has learned to imitate Nabonidus well enough to activate a toxic pollen trap, which eliminates yet another party of assassins (nationalistic agitators) penetrating the villa.\n\nFinally, Conan and the other two men manage to regain entry into Nabonidus' mansion from the basement. Later, Conan defeats Thak in hand-to-hand combat. The Red Priest soon betrays both Conan and Murilo; but, while Nabonidus is gloating over his plans in a detailed monologue, Conan slays him with an expertly hurled stool. The surviving pair leave and go their separate ways.\n\n\"Rogues in the House\" is written in an extremely ironic fashion and as a Jacobean revenge story. It is eventually revealed that Nabonidus' \"usurper\" is actually his pet, Thak, an intelligent ape-like creature who got the better of his master.\n\nThe story's title also reflects the other main irony, the conflict between Murilo and Nabonidus. Each man has been using his position of influence for personal profit (Nabonidus by manipulating the king; Murilo by selling state secrets to foreign rulers). After stumbling upon each other in a pit beneath Nabonidus' house, the two rivals realize that they're equally corrupt and, indeed, Conan may be the most morally honest of the three men because he doesn't attempt to conceal his criminal nature.\n\nIn a January 1934 letter to H. P. Lovecraft, Clark Ashton Smith (discussing the January 1934 issue of \"Weird Tales\") praised \"Rogues in the House\". Smith stated, \"Conan, as usual, put on a very entertaining and imaginative show.\" \n\nThe point where Conan clamors to be brought food while he waits to be set free evidently struck a chord in Lin Carter, the post-World War II heroic fantasy writer who cooperated with L. Sprague de Camp in bringing Lovecraftian and Howardian fiction back into publication. He included similar scenes in almost all instances when his Conan-inspired Lemurian hero Thongor managed to end up imprisoned.\n\nThe story was adapted by Roy Thomas and Barry Smith in Marvel Comics' \"Conan the Barbarian\" #11 (Nov 1971), and by Tim Truman and Cary Nord and Tomás Giorello in Dark Horse Comics' \"Conan #41–44\".\n\n"}
{"id": "2265432", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2265432", "title": "Teisco", "text": "Teisco\n\nTeisco was a Japanese musical instrument manufacturing company from 1948 until 1967, when the brand \"Teisco\" was acquired by Kawai (河合楽器製作所; Kawai Gakki Seisakusho). The company produced guitars as well as synthesizers, microphones, guitar amplifiers and even drum kits. Teisco products were widely exported to the United States and the United Kingdom.\n\nIn 2018, the brand \"Teisco\" was relaunched –along with former guitar company Harmony– by Singaporean BandLab Technologies to produce effects units.\n\nThe brand name \"Teisco\" was established in 1948, and sometimes incorrectly explained as an acronym of \"Tokyo Electric Instrument and Sound Company\". However, the exact name of company establishing and producing the Teisco brand was not that name, and rather, they had frequently renamed their company.\n\nThe company was founded in 1946 by renowned Hawaiian and Spanish guitarist Atsuwo Kaneko and electrical engineer Doryu Matsuda. The company was originally called \"Aoi Onpa Kenkyujo\" (roughly: Hollyhock Soundwave or Electricity Laboratories). In 1956, the company name was changed to \"Nippon Onpa Kogyo Co.\", and changed to \"Teisco Co.\" in 1964. In 1967, the company was acquired by Kawai Musical Instruments Manufacturing Co. Ltd. (河合楽器製作所; Kawai Gakki Seisakusho), who discontinued the Teisco brand name for guitars in 1969 (1977 in Japan), but continued to use it for electronic keyboards until the 1980s.\n\nTeisco guitars were imported to the United States since 1959 or early 1960, and then re-badged as \"Teisco Del Rey\" after 1964.\nFrom 1948 to the early 1960s Teisco products often, like many Japanese products of the period, shared several designs with American and Western European products of the time including Hagström and EKO.\n\nHowever, in the early 1960s Teisco products became increasingly unique. Teisco guitars became notable for unusual body shapes, such as the \"May Queen\" design resembling an artist's palette, or other unusual features such as having four pickups (most guitars have two or three). The vast amount of controls; typically an individual switch for each pickup, plus a tone or phase-cancellation switch, along with as many as five tone and volume knobs gave a wide variety of sounds yet were easily switched while playing.\nAfter Kawai bought Teisco in 1967, they started to produce all the Teisco guitars, as well as their own brand, \"Apollo\". Hound Dog Taylor famously used a variety of these Kawai-era Teiscos, which he bought at his local Sears department store. Jim Reid of The Jesus and Mary Chain used a \"Spectrum V\". Also, James Iha of The Smashing Pumpkins played a \"K-2L\", which can seen in the music video for Rocket (The Smashing Pumpkins song) as well as the inside of the Pisces Iscariot CD jewel case. Ben Waugh (Scott Campbell), singer & guitarist for Apparition, The Sillies, and Scott Campbell Group played a modified ET-200 onstage and for studio recordings until it was stolen in 1985.\nSinger, songwriter Vance Brescia, guitarist and music director for Herman’s Hermits Starring Peter Noone and frequent guest musician with The Monkees, Micky Dolenz and other artists plays a Teisco Del Rey EP-8 model. He has played Teisco guitars since childhood and just before joining Peter Noone in 2001 found this one from the Teisco 1964 line screwed to the wall at a Guitar Center as junk art. He talked the manager into a trade, took the guitar home, rebuilt it and has played it on stage ever since. The light weight of this guitar is a bonus to the sonic attributes.\n\nMany Teisco guitars had a primitive tailed bridge in their extended tail bridges with limited timbre when used in an extended technique. When the strings are attacked behind the bridge, a 3rd bridge sound is created. This is one of the reasons these guitars became popular again during the 90s among many noise artists as a cheaper alternative for the Fender Jaguar or Jazzmaster, which were beginning to attract collector interest.\n\nTeisco also produced a six-string bass called \"TB-64\" (or \"ET-320\") in 1964, similar to the Fender Bass VI which was itself an uncommon instrument. Teisco six-string bass followed an unusual body shape that was used on one of their guitars. It had an off-set body shape similar to a Jazzmaster, but with an extended top horn, a 'monkey handle' cutout on the left-facing side of the bridge and a Fender-style headstock with an oversized scroll. This instrument, as well as its regular-scale guitar equivalent, can be heard extensively on Blonde Redhead's early albums of the 90's, where they used its wide range to switch between bass and guitar melodies in the course of single songs.\n\nAlso, 2 or 4-pickup baritone guitars (27 3/4 inch scale) with a tremolo, known as \"Demian\" or \"Orlando\" \"VN-2\" or \"VN-4\" ca.1964 manufactured by FujiGen, are often referred as Teisco models. However the formal relations between Teisco and these models are not enough verified yet. The \"VN-2\" is used by The Noble Gasses band of Los Angeles, California.\n\nTeisco basses are easily identified through a unique pickup design exclusive to the Del Rey series. This design consisted of a large rectangular chrome pickup with black plastic holding the four poles in one place. Other designs may vary, but are all easily distinguishable and unique among subsequent bass designs. Teisco made a short scale bass under the Heit Deluxe name. With a scale length of 23.5\", it was a student or beginner instrument. It featured a single pickup, volume and tone controls and a rudimentary bridge/tailpiece.\n\nTeisco also produced numerous models of guitar and bass amplifiers which were often sold under the \"Checkmate\" brand name, but also named Teisco or Silvertone as well as Beltone and Melody. In the 1950s, early amplifier models were very basic 5-10 watt tube/valve designs. During the 1960s, more advanced and powerful models were offered, such as \"Checkmate 25\", \"Checkmate 50\",and \"Checkmate 100\" featuring dual channels, reverb and tremolo effects. Teisco also made solid-state (transistor-based) models, some designed no less radically than their guitars of the time. The \"Sound Port 60\" (60 watts/RMS) and \"Sound Port 120\" (120 watts/RMS) amplifiers from the late 1960s were copies of Fender's silverfaced Vibro Champ and Twin Reverb.\n\nTeisco also produced a range of synthesizers, with models including the 60F, 110F, 100F, 100P, SX-210, SX-240, and SX-400.\n\nBands such as Hot Chip (UK), Pure Reason Revolution (UK), and Goose (Belgium) are known to use Teisco synthesizers.\n\nTeisco marketed drum sets in limited sizes and configurations during the 1960s, sold under the brand name \"Del Ray\". They were produced by sub-contractors to fill out the company's catalog as a supplier of combo instruments, but discontinued after the acquisition by Kawai.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2265433", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2265433", "title": "Marie Tharp", "text": "Marie Tharp\n\nMarie Tharp (July 30, 1920 – August 23, 2006) was an American geologist and oceanographic cartographer who, in partnership with Bruce Heezen, created the first scientific map of the Atlantic Ocean floor. Tharp's work revealed the detailed topography and multi-dimensional geographical landscape of the ocean bottom. Her work also revealed the presence of a continuous rift valley along the axis of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, causing a paradigm shift in earth science that led to acceptance of the theories of plate tectonics and continental drift.\n\nMarie Tharp was born to Bertha Louise Tharp, a German and Latin teacher, and William Edgar Tharp, a soil surveyor for the United States Department of Agriculture. Marie often helped him with this task, which gave her an early introduction to mapmaking. Due to the nature of William Tharp's work, the Tharp family moved constantly until William retired in 1931. At that point Marie had attended over 20 public schools in Alabama, Iowa, Michigan and Indiana. A full school year in Florence, Alabama, USA, was particularly influential for Marie. There, she attended a class called \"Current Science\", in which she learned about contemporary scientists and the research projects they were working on. In addition, she got the chance to undertake school field trips on weekends to study trees and rocks. \n\nAfter his retirement, William Tharp and the rest of the family moved to a farm in Bellefontaine, Ohio where, shortly after, Marie graduated from high school. Influenced by her mother, a teacher, she took a year off before going to college; after graduating, she too planned to become a teacher. Staying on the farm to help after her mother’s death in 1936, Marie later matriculated in college. Advised by her father to choose a subject of study that she not only loved, but also would provide her with a career and financial security, Tharp graduated from Ohio University in 1943 with bachelor's degrees in English and music and four minors. After the attack on Pearl Harbour by the Japanese army, many young men dropped out of schools and universities to join the armed forces. World War II hence meant more women were being recruited into professions like petroleum geology, hitherto largely restricted to men. Having taken a geology class at Ohio, Tharp was recruited to the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor's petroleum geology program, where she completed a master's degree. Tharp's leap into a career in earth sciences is extraordinary given longstanding discrimination against women in this field — women obtained fewer than 4% of all earth sciences doctorates at this time. She took a job at the Stanolind Oil company in Tulsa, Oklahoma, as a junior geologist, but soon found it unsatisfying. At that time, in fact, women were not allowed to go on field trip to look for oil and gas. She was therefore confined to the office, where her duties were to collect the maps and data for the men going in the field. While still working as a geologist for the Stanolind Oil company, Tharp enrolled in the faculty of mathematics at the University of Tulsa, obtaining her second BSc. In 1948, Tharp had spent 4 years in Tulsa and was looking for her next career step. At that time, she moved to New York to work with Maurice Ewing, the founder of Columbia University’s Lamont Geological Observatory, as a research assistant. Curiously, when interviewed for the job, Tharp did not mention she had a master's degree in geology.\n\nTharp moved to New York in 1948, where Maurice Ewing employed her at the Lamont Geological Laboratory (now the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory) at Columbia University, initially as a general drafter. Before the early 1950s, scientists knew very little about the structure of the ocean floor. Studying the field of geology on land was cheaper and easier. The complete idea of the structure of the entire earth could not be accomplished without knowledge of the structure and evolution of the seafloor. Marie Tharp was one of the first women to work at the Lamont Geological Observatory. There, Tharp met Bruce Heezen, and in early work together they used photographic data to locate downed aircraft from World War II. Tharp was employed and continuously promoted from 1952 to 1968, when her position was cut and moved to grant-funded status due to lab politics involving Heezen (she remained in a grant-funded position until Heezen's death in 1977). Because of the Cold War, the U.S. government forbade seafloor maps to be published, for fear that Soviet submarines could use them. In 1952 Heezen and Tharp began working together to map the topography of the ocean floor. For the first 18 years of their collaboration, Heezen collected bathymetric data aboard the research ship, the \"Vema\", while Tharp drew maps from that data, since women were still excluded from working aboard ship at that time. Although restricted, early in her career, from conducting research at sea due to her gender, Tharp was later able to join a 1968 data-collection expedition. Tharp independently used data collected from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution's research ship \"Atlantis\", and seismographic data from undersea earthquakes. Her work with Heezen represented the first systematic attempt to map the entire ocean floor.\n\nIn 1952, Tharp painstakingly aligned sounding profiles from \"Atlantis\", acquired during 1946 - 1952, and one profile from the Naval ship \"Stewart\" acquired during 1921. She created a total of approximately six profiles stretching west-to-east across the North Atlantic. From these profiles, she was able to examine the bathymetry of the northern sections of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Tharp identified an aligned, v-shaped structure running continuously through the axis of the ridge and believed that it may be a rift valley. She believed that the rift valley formed when new material welled up to the surface, pushing either side of the ridge apart. Heezen was initially unconvinced as the idea would have supported continental drift, then a controversial theory. At the time many scientists including Heezen believed that continental drift was impossible. Instead, for a time he favored the expanding Earth hypothesis, ridiculing her theory as \"girl talk\".\n\nHeezen soon hired Howard Foster to plot the location of earthquake epicenters in the oceans for a project relating large-scale turbidity currents to undersea earthquakes. The creation of this earthquake epicenter map proved to be a useful secondary dataset for examining the bathymetry of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. When Foster's map of earthquake epicenters was overlain with Tharp's profile of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge it became clear that the location of these earthquakes aligned with Tharp's rift valley. After putting together these two datasets, Tharp became convinced that a rift valley did in fact exist within the crest of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. It was only after seeing that the location of earthquake epicenters aligned with Tharp's rift valley that Heezen accepted her hypothesis and turned to the alternative theories of plate tectonics and continental drift.\n\nTharp and Heezen published their first physiographic map of the North Atlantic in 1957. Still, Tharp's name does not appear on any of the major papers on plate tectonics that he and others published between 1959 and 1963. Tharp continued working with graduate student assistants to further map the extent of the central rift valley. Tharp identified that the rift valley extended along with the Mid-Atlantic Ridge into the South Atlantic, and found a similar valley structure in the Indian Ocean, Arabian Sea, Red Sea, and Gulf of Aden, suggesting the presence of a global oceanic rift zone. Subsequently, in collaboration with the Austrian landscape painter Heinrich Berann, Tharp and Heezen published their map of the entire ocean floor in 1977 (coincidentally, also the year of Heezen's death). Although still recognized and attributed to for her work today on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, it was Heezen, who at the time in 1956, put out, and received credit for the discovery that was made. The map was published by the Office of Naval Research in 1977.\n\nAfter Heezen's death, Tharp continued to serve on the faculty of Columbia University until 1983, after which she operated a map-distribution business in South Nyack during her retirement. Tharp donated her map collection and notes to the Map and Geography Division of the Library of Congress in 1995. In 1997, Tharp received double honors from the Library of Congress, which named her one of the four greatest cartographers of the 20th century and included her work in an exhibit in the 100th-anniversary celebration of its Geography and Map Division. In 2001, Tharp was awarded the first annual Lamont-Doherty Heritage Award at her home institution for her life's work as a pioneer of oceanography. Tharp died of cancer in Nyack, New York on August 23, 2006 at the age of 86.\n\nIn 1948, she married David Flanagan and moved with him to New York. They were divorced by 1952.\n\nMarie Tharp appears in The Lost Worlds of Planet Earth, the ninth episode of Neil deGrasse Tyson’s science documentary show \"\" in animation form voiced by actress Amanda Seyfried. The episode depicts her discovery of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and subsequently later in the episode deGrasse Tyson recognized Tharp not only as an influential scientist who happens to be a woman but also as one who should be recognized as a scientist who overcame sexism to contribute to her field.\n\nIn 2009, Google Earth included the Marie Tharp Historical Map layer, to allow people to view Tharp's ocean map using the Google Earth interface.\n\nIn 2013, author Hali Felt published a biography of Marie Tharp entitled \"Soundings: The Story of the Remarkable Woman Who Mapped the Ocean Floor\". It was cited by the New York Times for its standing as an \"eloquent testament both to Tharp's importance and to Felt's powers of imagination.\"\n\nIn 2015 the International Astronomical Union named a Moon Crater in her honour.\n\nIn 2020, a group of geologists began selling mugs with a photo of Tharp, donating all proceeds to the Earth Science Women's Network.\n\nLike many women of her era in science, Marie Tharp was recognized mainly later in life. She was awarded noteworthy recognition such as:\n\n1978 - National Geographic Society’s Hubbard Medal\n\n1996 - Society of Woman Geographers Outstanding Achievement Award\n\n1999 - Woods Holes Oceanographic Institution’s Mary Sears Woman Pioneer in Oceanography Award\n\n2001 - Lamont–Doherty Earth Observatory Heritage Award\n\nLamont had created the Marie Tharp Visiting Fellowship Program in 2004. Women who are accepted are given the opportunity to work with the faculty, research staff, postdoctoral researchers and graduate students. Additionally in the duration of 3 months, they are awarded up to $30,000 as financial aid to promote up-and-coming women researchers.\nThe Marie Tharp Fellowship is a competitive academic visiting fellowship awarded to women to work with researchers at Columbia University's Earth Institute.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2265435", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2265435", "title": "Arabic chat alphabet", "text": "Arabic chat alphabet\n\nThe Arabic chat alphabet, Arabizi (, ), Franco-Arabic (, , or ), Arabish, Araby (, ), and Mu'arrab (), refer to the Romanized alphabets for informal Arabic dialects in which Arabic script is transcribed or encoded into a combination of Latin script and Arabic numerals. These informal chat alphabets were originally used primarily by youth in the Arab world in very informal settings—especially for communicating over the Internet or for sending messages via cellular phones—though use is not necessarily restricted by age any more and these chat alphabets have been used in other media such as advertising.\n\nThese chat alphabets differ from more formal and academic Arabic transliteration systems, in that they use numerals and multigraphs instead of diacritics for letters such as qāf (ق) or Ḍād (ض) that do not exist in the basic Latin script (ASCII), and in that what is being transcribed is an informal dialect and not Standard Arabic. These Arabic chat alphabets also differ from each other, as each is influenced by the particular phonology of the Arabic dialect being transcribed and the orthography of the dominant European language in the area—typically the language of the former colonists, and typically either French or English.\n\nBecause of their widespread use, including in public advertisements by large multinational companies, large players in the online industry like Google and Microsoft have introduced tools that convert text written in Arabish to Arabic (Google Translate and Microsoft Translator). Add-ons for Mozilla Firefox and Chrome also exist (Panlatin and ARABEASY Keyboard ). The Arabic chat alphabet is never used in formal settings and is rarely, if ever, used for long communications.\n\nDuring the last decades of the 20th century, Western text-based communication technologies, such as mobile phone text messaging, the World Wide Web, email, bulletin board systems, IRC, and instant messaging became increasingly prevalent in the Arab world. Most of these technologies originally permitted the use of the Latin script only, and some still lack support for displaying Arabic script. As a result, Arabic-speaking users frequently transliterate Arabic text into Latin script when using these technologies to communicate.\n\nTo handle those Arabic letters that do not have an approximate phonetic equivalent in the Latin script, numerals and other characters were appropriated. For example, the numeral \"3\" is used to represent the Arabic letter (\"\")—note the choice of a visually similar character, with the numeral resembling a mirrored version of the Arabic letter. Many users of mobile phones and computers use Arabish even though their system is capable of displaying Arabic script. This may be due to a lack of an appropriate keyboard layout for Arabic, or because users are already more familiar with the QWERTY or AZERTY keyboard layout.\n\nOnline communication systems, such as IRC, bulletin board systems, and blogs, are often run on systems or over protocols that do not support code pages or alternate character sets. Thus, the Arabic chat alphabet has become commonplace. It can be seen even in domain names, like Qal3ah.\n\nBecause of the informal nature of this system, there is no single \"correct\" or \"official\" usage. There may be some overlap in the way various letters are transliterated.\n\nMost of the characters in the system make use of the Latin character (as used in English and French) that best approximates phonetically the Arabic letter that one would otherwise use (for example, corresponds to \"b\"). Regional variations in the pronunciation of an Arabic letter can also produce some variation in its transliteration (e.g. might be transliterated as \"j\" by a speaker of the Levantine dialect, or as \"g\" by a speaker of the Egyptian dialect).\n\nThose letters that do not have a close phonetic approximation in the Latin script are often expressed using numerals or other characters, so that the numeral graphically approximates the Arabic letter that one would otherwise use (e.g. is represented using the numeral \"3\" because the latter looks like a vertical reflection of the former).\n\nSince many letters are distinguished from others solely by a dot above or below the main portion of the character, the transliterations of these letters frequently use the same letter or number with an apostrophe added before or after (e.g. \"'3\" is used to represent ).\n\nEach of the different varieties of Arabic chat alphabets is influenced by the particular phonology of the Arabic dialect being transcribed and the orthography of the dominant European language in the area—typically the language of the former colonists. Below are some examples of Arabic chat alphabet varieties.\n\nThe frequent use of \"y\" and \"w\" to represent ي and و demonstrates the influence of English orthography on the romanization of Egyptian Arabic. As was the case in other parts of the region, English became the primary European language in Egypt as a result of British colonialism in the first half of the 20th century.\n\nAdditionally, the letter qāf (ق) is usually pronounced as a glottal stop, like a Hamza (ء) in Metropolitan (Cairene) Egyptian Arabic—unlike Standard Arabic in which it represents a voiceless uvular stop. Therefore, in Egyptian \"Arabizi\", the numeral 2 can represent either a Hamza or a qāf pronounced as a glottal stop.\n\"Lebanese, Syrian, Jordanian, Palestinian \"\nThe use of ch to represent ش demonstrates the influence of French orthography on the romanization of Moroccan Arabic or Darija. French became the primary European language in Morocco as a result of French colonialism.\n\nThe phenomenon of writing Arabic with these improvised chat alphabets has drawn sharp rebuke from a number of different segments of Arabic-speaking communities. While educators and members of the intelligentsia mourn the deterioration and degradation of the standard, literary, academic language, conservative Muslims, as well as Pan-Arabists and some Arab-nationalists, view the Arabic Chat Alphabet as a detrimental form of Westernization. Arabic chat alphabets emerged amid a growing trend among Arab youth, from Morocco to Iraq, to incorporate former colonial languages—especially English and French—into Arabic through code switching or as a form of slang. These improvised chat alphabets are used to replace Arabic script, and this raises concerns regarding the preservation of the quality of the language.\n"}

Howard. A novella, it was originally serialized in \"Weird Tales\" magazine from July to October 1936. It's set in the pseudo-historical Hyborian Age and concerns Conan encountering a lost city in which the degenerate inhabitants are proactively resigned to their own destruction. Due to its dark themes of decay and death, the story is considered a classic of Conan lore while also cited by Howard scholars as one of his best tales.\n\nThe story was republished in the collections \"The Sword of Conan\" (Gnome Press, 1952) and \"Conan the Warrior\" (Lancer Books, 1967). It was first published by itself in book form by Donald M. Grant, Publisher in 1975 as volume IV of their deluxe Conan set. It has most recently been republished in the collections \"The Conan Chronicles Volume 2: The Hour of the Dragon\" (Gollancz, 2001) and \"The Conquering Sword of Conan\" (Del Rey, 2005) (published in the United Kingdom by Wandering Star as \"\"), as well as \"The Best of Robert E. Howard, Volume 2: Grim Lands\" (Del Rey, 2007).\n\n\"Red Nails\" begins in the jungles far to the south of any known civilized or barbarian kingdoms. Valeria of the Red Brotherhood is fleeing persecution after she murdered a would-be rapist. She is followed into the wilderness by Conan, a fellow adventurer who wishes for an alliance with Valeria as her lover. Suddenly, Conan's stand-off with Valeria is interrupted by a dragon (actually a dinosaur, although described with the characteristics of a Stegosaurus and Allosaurus) which mauls their horses. Both Conan and Valeria escape the dragon by climbing across an eroded hillside. However, the hillside has no food or water. Soon, Conan recognizes some poisonous fruit growing nearby. Acting quickly, he coats the tip of a spear in poison and pierces the dragon's lower jaw with a well-aimed throw. Although blinded, the enraged beast pursues the two fugitives by their scent. Fortunately, Conan lures the injured beast towards a ravine.\n\nThe couple emerge from their shelter and journey towards a mysterious walled city, which Conan sighted from the hill. With a lack of grazing livestock or cultivated fields, the city appears deserted. Afterwards, Conan forces open the main gate, long since rusted shut. The couple slowly enter a bizarre twilight world. The city, which is known as Xuchotl, is a massive structure completely enclosed and roofed off by an emerald dome. A single great hallway runs across the entire city. However, no streets or open courtyards are present. The structure consists entirely of four tiers of rooms, chambers, and passageways. Xuchotl, itself, is carved from jade with traces of other exotic materials.\n\nThe two separate and search the city's empty corridors. Valeria encounters a man named Techotl, who she joins in his feud between two factions which dwell in the once populous city. Soon, Techotl invites Conan and Valeria into the stronghold of his tribe, the Tecuhltli. Eventually, the couple are welcomed by the rulers of Xuchotl, Olmec and Tascela. After a ritual, Olmec reveals the history of his civilization.\n\nThe city of Xuchotil was built centuries before its current inhabitants arrived. One day, a slave — Tolkemec — betrayed his master and guided the newly arrived invaders into the city while slaying the original inhabitants. The conquerors were led by two brothers, Tecuhltli and Xotalanc, who ruled peacefully over their city. However, a feud developed when Tecuhltli stole Xotalanc's bride during one of their arguments. Meanwhile, Tolkemec betrayed both sides for his own reasons and was exiled to the catacombs. Nails driven into a pillar inside of Olmec's stronghold keeps count the number of slain rivals, and provides the title for this story.\n\nAfter Olmec tells his story, Tascela develops an interest with Valeria. Soon, she has a slave attempt to drug Valeria with a narcotic plant. Valeria manages to capture the slave and interrogates her into revealing who is responsible for such treachery. However, she avoids submission and escapes the city.\n\nValeria's pursuit of the slave is interrupted when Xotalanc's army breaches the stronghold. Eventually, all of Xotalanc's troops are exterminated while Conan, Valeria, Olmec, Tascela, and fifteen Tecuhltli warriors remain alive. When Conan begins an expedition towards Xotalanc's stronghold, Valeria is left behind while her wounds are treated.\n\nWhile Conan is away, Olmec tries to rape Valeria. However, his efforts are thwarted by Tascela. She reveals herself as a sorceress and the stolen bride who originally started the feud. Tascela plans on using Valeria's vitality in restoring her own youth. Meanwhile, Olmec secretly orders for his guards to execute Conan. Conan kills the two warriors and hurries back for Valeria. Returning to Tecuhltli, Conan finds a bruised Olmec inside Tascela's dungeon. After rescuing him, Olmec attempts to betray Conan and is killed.\n\nConan faces off against Tascela who has Valeria chained to an altar. Caught in a steel trap, Conan watches helplessly as Tascela proceeds with her sacrifice of Valeria. Suddenly, Tascela's ceremony is interrupted by Tolkemec who has returned from his exile, wielding an ancient sceptre with destructive magic. Desperate for assistance against her nemesis, Tascela releases Conan. Conan defeats Tolkemec by stealing his sceptre. After freeing herself, Valeria kills Tascela by plunging a dagger into her heart.\n\nWith the last inhabitants of Xuchotl killed, Conan and Valeria depart from the now-dead city.\n\nValeria is an Aquilonian pirate who served as a mercenary prior to the story's events. Like Conan, she is a famous adventurer. Most of \"Red Nails\" is told from Valeria's point of view.\n\n\"She was tall, full-bosomed and large-limbed, with compact shoulders. Her whole figure reflected an unusual strength, without detracting from the femininity of her appearance. She was all woman, in spite of her bearing and her garments. The latter were incongruous, in view of her present environs. Instead of a skirt she wore short, wide-legged silk breeches, which ceased a hand's breath short of her knees, and were upheld by a wide silken sash worn as a girdle. Flaring-topped boots of soft leather came almost to her knees, and a low-necked, wide-collared, wide-sleeved silk shirt completed her costume. On one shapely hip she wore a straight double-edged sword, and on the other a long dirk. Her unruly golden hair, cut square at her shoulders, was confined by a band of crimson satin.\n\n\"Against the background of somber, primitive forest she posed with unconscious picturesqueness, bizarre and out of place. She should have been posed against a background of sea-clouds, painted masts and wheeling gulls. There was the color of the sea in her wide eyes. And that was how it should have been, because this was Valeria of the Red Brotherhood, whose deeds are celebrated in song and ballad wherever seafarers gather.\"\n\n\"[Valeria's] thoughts were scattered by the rustling of the leaves below her. She wheeled cat-like, snatched at her sword; and then she froze motionless, staring wide-eyed at the man before her.\"\n\n\"He was almost a giant in stature, muscles rippling smoothly under his skin which the sun had burned brown. His garb was similar to hers, except that he wore a broad leather belt instead of a girdle. Broadsword and poniard hung from this belt.\"\n\nAt this point in the saga, Conan is a seasoned warrior with years of experience acquired in many lands:\n\n\"'I was a \"kozak\" before I was a pirate... They live in the saddle. I snatch naps like a panther watching beside the trail for a deer to come by. My ears keep watch while my eyes sleep.'\n\n\"And indeed the giant barbarian seemed as much refreshed as if he had slept the whole night on a golden bed. Having removed the thorns, and peeled off the tough skin, he handed the girl a thick, juicy cactus leaf.\n\n\"'Skin your teeth in that pear. It's food and drink to a desert man. I was chief of the Zuagirs once, desert men who live by plundering the caravans.'\n\n\"'Is there anything you haven't been?' inquired the girl, half in derision and half in fascination.\"\n\nTechotl is typical of the warriors of Xuchotl. Howard relates Valeria's impressions in her first encounter with one such warrior:\n\n\"...He was slightly above middle height, very dark, though not negroid. He was naked but for a scanty silk clout that only partly covered his muscular hips, and a leather girdle, a hand's breadth broad, about his lean waist. His long black hair hung in lank strands about his shoulders, giving him a wild appearance. He was gaunt, but knots and cords of muscles stood out on his arms and legs, without that fleshy padding that presents a pleasing symmetry of contour. He was built with an economy that was almost repellent.\"\n\nTechotl soon befriends both Conan and Valeria. We are told, \"In the cold, heartless, and altogether hideous life of the Techultli, his admiration and affection for the invaders from the outer world formed a warm, human oasis, constituted a tie that connected him with a more natural humanity that was totally lacking in his fellows, whose only emotions were hate, lust and the urge of sadistic cruelty.\"\n\n\"On a wide ivory seat on a jade dais sat a man and a woman who differed subtly from the others. He was a giant, with an enormous sweep of breast and the shoulders of a bull. Unlike the others, he was bearded, with a thick, blue-black beard which fell almost to his broad girdle. He wore a robe of purple silk which reflected changing sheens of color with his every movement, and one wide sleeve, drawn back to his elbow, revealed a forearm massive with corded muscles. The band which confined his blue-black locks was set with glittering jewels.\n\n\"The woman beside him sprang to her feet with a startled exclamation as the strangers entered, and her eyes, passing over Conan, fixed themselves with burning intensity on Valeria. She was tall and lithe, by far the most beautiful woman in the room. She was clad more scantily even than the others; for instead of a skirt she wore merely a broad strip of gilt-worked purple cloth fastened to the middle of her girdle which fell below her knees. Another strip at the back of her girdle completed that part of her costume, which she wore with a cynical indifference. Her breast-plates and the circlet about her temples were adorned with gems. In her eyes alone of all the dark-skinned people there lurked no brooding gleam of madness...\"\n\n\"Framed in the door to the left of the dais stood a nightmare figure. It was a man, with a tangle of white hair and a matted white beard that fell over his breast. Rags only partly covered his gaunt frame, revealing half-naked limbs strangely unnatural in appearance. The skin was not that of a normal human. There was a suggestion of \"scaliness\" about it, as if the owner had dwelt long under conditions almost antithetical to those conditions under which human life ordinarily thrives. And there was nothing at all human about the eyes that blazed from the tangle of white hair. They were great gleaming discs that stared unwinkingly; luminous, whitish, and without a hint of normal emotion or sanity. The mouth gaped, but no coherent words issued --only a high-pitched tittering.\n\n\"'Tolkemec!' whispered Tascela, livid, while the others crouched in speechless horror. 'No myth, then, no ghost! Set! You have dwelt for twelve years in darkness! Twelve years among the bones of the dead! What grisly food did you find? What mad travesty of life did you live, in the stark blackness of that eternal night?...\"\n\nE. F. Bleiler placed \"Red Nails\" among \"among the better Conan stories,\" citing its \"Extravagant adventure embodying a considerable amount of antiquarian lore and imagination.\"\n\nRobert E. Howard's stories often express the author's belief on how civilizations carry the seeds of their own destruction. Howard found in the lost city genre a vehicle for expressing these views. Howard's Puritan adventurer Solomon Kane explored the lost African city of Negari in \"The Moon of Skulls\", published in \"Weird Tales\" in 1930. In Howard's novella, one can discern the influence of \"She\" by H. Rider Haggard and the lost city of Opar which appears in the \"Tarzan\" novels by Edgar Rice Burroughs Howard's Negari is ruled by the seductive queen Nakari, recalling Haggard's Ayesha and Burroughs' La of Opar.\n\nWhen Howard moved onto the Conan series, he began to place his own distinctive stamp on the lost city tale. In \"Xuthal of the Dusk\" (published in the September 1933 issue of \"Weird Tales\" as \"The Slithering Shadow\"), Conan and a female companion discover an inhabited lost city and encounter its resident femme fatale. Though not without merit, \"Xuthal of the Dusk\" is generally regarded as a second-rate Conan story. However, its themes such as the decadence of a stagnant and dying culture is clearly evident. \"Xuthal\" is commonly viewed as the direct precursor to \"Red Nails\".\n\nThe theme of cultural decadence maintained its grip on Howard's imagination. In early 1935, he remarked to Novalyne Price: \n\nThe idea that would become \"Red Nails\" continued to germinate in Howard's mind, and later that year he began the actual writing of the tale. It would be the last major fantasy story Howard would complete.\n\nIn 1935, Howard found himself burdened with medical expenses for the treatment of his ailing mother. Payment from \"Weird Tales\" was becoming increasingly unreliable. In early May, Howard wrote to his editor Farnsworth Wright, pleading for the money owed him. At that time, \"Weird Tales\" owed Howard over eight hundred dollars for stories already published, and payable upon publication. Wright had been paying Howard in a series of monthly installments, but these checks ceased just when Howard needed them most. Howard explained the circumstances surrounding his need and made it clear that he understood that \"Weird Tales\" was undergoing its own share of financial difficulties due to the Depression. However, he felt moved to state in no uncertain terms, \"A monthly check from \"Weird Tales\" may well mean for me the difference between a life that is at least endurable and God alone knows what.\" \n\nHoward received no immediate reply from Wright. A week later, he wrote to his agent, Otis Adelbert Kline, inquiring if Kline had any inside knowledge concerning the situation at the \"Weird Tales\" editorial offices. Howard was ultimately moved to concentrate on better-paying markets, primarily those for Western fiction. In a letter to H. P. Lovecraft he confided, \"As for my own fantasy writing, whether or not I do any future work in that field depends a good deal on the editors themselves. I would hate to abandon weird writing entirely, but my financial needs are urgent, immediate and imperious. Slowness of payment in the fantastic field forces me into other lines against my will.\"\n\nOn July 22, 1935, Howard mailed his manuscript for \"Red Nails\" to \"Weird Tales\". At the time, he shared his thoughts with Clark Ashton Smith, another colleague: \"Sent a three-part serial to Wright yesterday: 'Red Nails,' which I devoutly hope he'll like. After Conan yarn, and the grimmest, bloodiest, and most merciless story of the series so far. Too much raw meat, maybe, but I merely portrayed what I honestly believe would be the reactions of certain types of people in the situations on which the plot of the story hung...\"\n\nLater in the year, Howard told Lovecraft, \"The last yarn I sold to \"Weird Tales\" --and it well may be the last fantasy I'll ever write-- was a three-part Conan serial which was the bloodiest and most sexy weird story I ever wrote. I have been dissatisfied with my handling of decaying races in stories, for the reason that degeneracy is so prevalent in such races that it can not be ignored as a motive and as a fact if the fiction is to have any claim to realism. I have ignored it in all other stories, as one of the taboos, but I did not ignore it in this story...\"\n\nOn the verge of abandoning fantasy for more commercial concerns, Howard devoted considerable thought and effort to his final allegorical statement.\n\nThe story was later adapted by Roy Thomas and Barry Windsor-Smith for issues #2-3 of the Marvel Comics magazine series \"Savage Tales\". The Thomas/Smith tale was later reprinted in the 1987 black-and-white magazine \"Conan Saga\". It has also been reprinted many times since then, both in black-and-white and in full color, by Marvel and more recently by Dark Horse.\n\nAn unfinished and unreleased animated feature based on this story, \"Conan: Red Nails\", went into production around 2005. Actor Ron Perlman was cast as providing the voice of Conan, while Tolkemec was to be voiced by Mark Hamill. The film was originally due to be released in 2010. However, production was stalled and since 2007 there have been no updates as to this film's status on its official website. IMDB still has the original listing for the (proposed) release of the film. \"Red Nails\" remains an unfinished film with no planned release.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2265453", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2265453", "title": "Michelago", "text": "Michelago\n\nMichelago is a village in the Monaro region of New South Wales, Australia. The village is in the Snowy Monaro Regional Council local government area, south of Canberra on the Monaro Highway. It was founded in the 1820s, on the main route from Sydney to the Snowy Mountains. At the , Michelago had a population of 562.\n\nMichelago is situated in a valley between two mountain ranges, the Tinderry Range to the East and the Clear Range to the west. The Tinderry Road crosses the Tinderry range from Michelago, leading ultimately to the 1950s silver mining settlement Captains Flat. The highest peaks in the picturesque Tinderry Range reach approximately 1600m above sea level, while Michelago itself has an elevation of around 800m. The Murrumbidgee River separates the village from the Clear Range. The Michelago Creek passes through the village, and is a source of water for the residents. Its catchment area is in the Tinderry Range, and after passing the town the creek flows into the Murrumbidgee River. It has been claimed that Michelago represents the territorial divide between white-backed and black-backed magpies on the Monaro Highway from Canberra to Cooma.\n\nCurrie and Ovens explored the Michelago region in 1823 and the first settlement proceeded soon thereafter, involving the ex-convict couple, Emmanuel and Catherine Elliot. The explorer Dr John Lhotsky claimed that his journey in 1834 south from the Limestone Plains toward Michelago represented a descent into what he considered barbarism: no church south of Sutton Forest, no window pane south of Canberra, no white woman south of Michelago.\n\nSix hundred and forty acres of Crown Land at “Miccelago” were advertised to be sold on 9 December 1835. The community was served by a licensed Inn by 1850.\n\nThe first Monaro Superintendent of Police, the Corsican Francis Nicholas Rossi, built an ironbark slab homestead in the region called \"Micilago\" on 35,000 acres (14,175 hectares) in 1837; this station was bought in 1859 by Alexander Ryrie who married Charlotte Faunce the daughter of Alured Tasker Faunce the police magistrate at Queanbeyan; one of their children being Granville Ryrie, later a General in World War I, knighted and involved with the League of Nations in Geneva. Alexander Ryrie who'd renamed his property \"Michalago,\" built St Thomas' church in the village of Michelago and life for those in the area was very self-sufficient, with income from wool, cattle for meat, milk and butter, locally grown fruit and vegetables, with soap and tallow candles also being made by hand.\n\nA big social event was the picnic races and over 200 people attended the Michelago Public School picnic in 1906. During the 1930-50's eucalyptus stilling was a profitable occupation in the Tinderry Range above Michelago and a drum of eucalyptus oil (44 gallons or 200L) was worth 100 pounds on site in the 1940s. Notable families of the early years of Michelago include the Kellys, Cotters, ,Shanahans, Lawlers, McTernans and Poveys. Many of their descendants still live in the region.\n\nLea-Scarlett notes that in October 1840 a gang of five bushrangers broke out of the lockup at Queanbeyan and police magistrate Captain Faunce had to give chase to Michelago before he recaptured them. On 1 June 1866 a bushranging gang consisting of the Clarke brothers, Patsy Connell and two accomplices held up Michelago town (which then consisted of Thomas Kennedy's Hibernian Hotel, a police station and lockup, Abraham Levy's store, a Church of England schoolhouse, a Catholic church and a few houses) and drank its entire liquor supply before staggering off to their rocky hide-out called 'Beefcask' in the Tinderrys.\n\nIn February 1866, two armed men robbed the post office, destroyed the letters and escaped with three horses, one of them a race horse.\n\nSt Patrick’s Catholic Church, a small building made of stone, was too small for its congregation by 1906 and it was decided to build a new brick church. The foundation stone for the Michelago Memorial Church was laid in October 1906. The bricks were locally made from red clay and 75,000 were used. The building was roofed with slate. The cost of construction was £1,134 pounds and six shillings, of which £50 was the architects fee. He was James Nangle and the builder Mr J. G. Taylor, both of Sydney. The building had seating for 150 people and it was officially opened on 28 April 1907.\n\nThe railway to the town opened on 7 December 1887 and Bernard Ferris's railway pub at Michelago established during the construction period was called the 'Navvies' Arms'. In the 1920s Michelago was visited by the Great White Train with fifteen exhibition coaches encouraging people to 'Buy Australian Made'. The railway line closed in 1989—along with the rest of the line from Queanbeyan to Cooma. From 1993 until 1997, the Australian Railway Historical Society ACT Division operated the line to Michelago as a heritage railway. However, as the line deteriorated, services were truncated to Royalla (approx north). Due to significant damage to some of the older wooden bridges in the 2010 floods near Queanbeyan, the ARHS ACT is unlikely ever to run to Michelago again. To the south, the railway is also disused between Michelago and Chakola, and a 1990s resurfacing of the Monaro Highway north of Bredbo, severed where the railway crossed the highway.\n\nMichelago has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:\n\n The George Washington Lambert painting \"The Squatter's Daughter\" was painted at Michelago. Lambert also painted \"Michelago Landscape\" (both paintings are in the National Gallery of Australia collection) and wrote this poem about it:\n\n\"The sun is down and 'Micalago' is at rest\nLike Chinese silk of faded gold, the grass and all the hills like breasts of turtle-doves\nMy soul could find a home 'midst blades of grass\nAnd get its music from the whispering trees\nThese pleasant little hills that lure us on\nTo ride and ride until we reach beyond.\"\n\nDavid Campbell wrote a poem \"The Squatter's Daughter\" about the funerals of Granville Ryrie and his daughter at Michelago:\n\n\"Veterans shed tears and limped the sweet-briar miles\nBehind his guncarriage to Michelago\nAnd now The Squatter's Daughter follows him:\nThe grey lake blurs beneath\nGovernor's Hill, her candid spirit mourned\nBy grandchildren with hair of daffodil.\"\n\nThe artist Robert Pengilley lives and paints in the Michelago region. In 1986 a painting of \"Ryrie's Creek\" by Pengilley was presented as a gift from the Australian Government to the People's Republic of China. Another of his works \"Storm over the Tinderrys\" is held by the Australian National University in Canberra.\n\nThe 1999 film \"Passion\", about the life of Percy Grainger was partly filmed in Michelago. The 2004 Cate Shortland film \"Somersault\" included scenes filmed at the Ryrie homestead at Michelago; scenes from the Gillian Armstrong 1979 film \"My Brilliant Career\" were also shot at that location.\n\nThere was a big bushfire in the Tinderry Range in November 1957 which burnt out 90% of the reserve and was not contained until 24 December. In January 2003, bushfires ravaged the Canberra region and, spreading from Namadgi National Park, devastated much of the flora and bush landscape around Michelago, particularly down from the Clearview Road toward the Murrumbidgee River. While the village itself was not affected by the fires, several farms and houses were destroyed and mountains of the Clear Range were left blackened and barren. A bushfire which began on 17 December 2009 devastated the area east of Michelago, burning out over 9,000 hectares and destroying three homes and a sawmill.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2265454", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2265454", "title": "South African nationality law", "text": "South African nationality law\n\nThe Republic of South Africa rewrote its nationality law after the end of apartheid in 1994 and the establishment of majority rule in the country under the newly-elected African National Congress. The 1995 South African Citizenship Act revoked the previous Union of South Africa Act of 1949 (which replaced the British Nationality Act) and apartheid-era 1970 Act, the 1970 Act had established separate bantustan citizenship to the country's African majority and inferior levels of citizenship to the country's Asian and coloured minorities.\n\nAccording to Chapter 2 of the 1995 law, anyone who was considered to be a \"citizen by birth\" prior to the enactment of the law or who is born in the Republic on or after the enactment of the law is a citizen by birth. Also, a person is a \"citizen by birth\" if they can be considered a citizen by descent and at the time of birth at least one parent was: 1) in the service of the government, 2) was employed by a person or group located in the Republic, or 3) was in the service of an international organization in which South Africa had membership.\n\nThere is an exception to the birthright citizenship provision: those born to visiting foreign diplomats or their employees, or nonresident aliens are not considered to be \"citizens by birth\" (unless their other parent is a citizen, in which case they are a citizen by birth).\n\nUnder the 1995 law, a person born outside South Africa to a South African parent is a South African citizen by descent upon registration of the birth under South African law. Those who did not retain their citizenship after they applied for another citizenship cannot transmit their previously held citizenship.\n\nCitizenship Amendment Act, 2010 (Act No. 17 of 2010) which came into operation on 1 January 2013, citizenship can be acquired by adults through naturalisation if the following conditions are met:\nNaturalisation of an adult also confers South African citizenship upon that adult's minor children.\n\nNaturalised South Africans who left South Africa before 6 October 1988 and did not obtain a 'Letter of Exemption' from the South African authorities may have lost South African citizenship after seven years absence.\n\nVisa requirements for South African citizens are administrative entry restrictions enforced by the authorities of other states placed on citizens of South Africa. In 2017, South African citizens had visa-free or visa on arrival access to 98 countries and territories, ranking the South African passport 55th in the world according to the Visa Restrictions Index. Presently, South African citizens have visa-free or visa-on-arrival access to 103 countries, according to the February 2018 score ranking, the South African passport is 53rd in the world. There are many exemptions for South African citizens in lieu of obtaining a visa if in possession of an Exemption Document, see Visa requirements for South African citizens.\n\n\nIt is beyond understanding how the Home Affairs find most of the citizens who obtained another citizenship.\n\nPrior to 2004, South Africa in principle did not recognise the multiple citizenship of its nationals unless the citizen applied for an exemption or permission letter under a 1995 law permitting South African citizens to travel using foreign passports.\n\nSince 2004, South African dual nationals may travel without hindrance as long as they enter and leave South Africa on their South African passports. Dual nationals may petition for temporary, emergency or \"permanent\" South African passports for this purpose.\n\nHowever, a South African citizen who by a formal and voluntary act acquires the citizenship of another country, automatically loses his or her South African citizenship unless they apply for, and receive permission to retain their South African citizenship before acquiring the citizenship of the new country. A naturalized citizen however cannot apply for such a retention under the law. There is not a specific requirement to do so if residing in South Africa or if the claim is inevitable such as a dual Zimbabwean-South Africa possessing the Right of Abode in the UK then registering as a British Citizen but it is advised by the Department of Home Affairs. The Home Affairs has the responsibility to decide whether or not the application would meet by a Voluntary or Formal and decide on whether or not it is necessary to give that permission. If a South African Citizen wishes to restore a previously lost Citizenship (usually by birth in another country or of their ancestors) due to acquiring Citizenship of another country, for instance citizenship of one of the territories that the Soviet Union controlled, then it is not a Voluntary or Formal Act when applying and retention of South African Citizenship is not necessary.\n\nDo note: Upon the introduction of patrility, a concept colloquially known as the right of abode in the United Kingdom, A South African citizen cannot possess the Right of Abode in the United Kingdom as they were not Commonwealth Citizens in 1983 unless they are a Commonwealth Citizen of another country, however if due to registration, British Citizenship and the Right of Abode is given simultaneously.\n\nSouth African citizens under the age of eighteen (18) years are exempt from the retention requirement and do not require permission as long as they acquire the foreign citizenship before their eighteen (18th) birthday by their parent's right or application. They automatically retain their South African citizenship for life unless; once they have reached the age of 18, they wish to acquire a further foreign citizenship. They will then have to apply for prior permission to retain their South African citizenship – failing to do so, they will automatically lose their South African citizenship.\n\nThese laws are not heavily guarded thus entering South Africa with a South African passport will immediately suggest the holder's citizenship.\n\nEntering South Africa on a foreign or another country's Commonwealth Passport is illegal when in the possession of South African citizenship. If the holder is assumed to have renounced their South African citizenship because there is no evidence to suggest that they are ‘presently’-'once were' South African, then they may pass under the assumption of another state/ that citizen but when it seems that they are a South African citizen, then may they face interrogation when entering or leaving South Africa when entering on another passport. An example of a person still holding South African citizenship to the officer would be: a person (generally above 18) seeking entry with a British citizen passport describing them as above 18, having been born in Republic of South Africa and the person's passport states birth as Johannesburg, but the Home Affairs Officer detects that they last entered on a South African passport by an unknown method. This provision of the Citizenship Act (section 26(B)) only applies to adults (\"major citizens\").\n\nHowever, children must also enter and leave on a South African passport.\n\nThose who previously held South African citizenship (other than by naturalization) are always entitled to permanent residence in South Africa and may apply to resume (naturalize) their South African citizenship after indefinitely returning so long there is sufficient proof of previously held South African citizenship. The permanent residence holder will then be required to reside in South Africa until (they) become eligible to restore or naturalize as a South African citizen. The application for resumption of South African citizenship requires proof of residence in South Africa for one year immediately prior to the application. Municipal rates and other utility bills are usually accepted.\n\nResuming South African citizenship within South Africa after losing by gaining another citizenship by a voluntary or formal act after living for one year in South Africa Permanent Resident can be a lengthy task, thus all ACTION must be taken to avoid the loss of South African citizenship entirely. Should a parent choose make an application to resume, their child will not automatically become citizens. If the child entered in immigration exemption or clearance then later on as a dependent of the permanent visa holder (the parent), then they can later naturalize after a five years residence or after they turn 18, whichever comes first. However, the child could be subject to the one year residence requirement under certain conditions.\n\nThose who naturalized after obtaining permanent residence (South African citizenship not by birth or descent or registration) cannot apply for permanent residence then citizenship through their claim to previously being a South African citizen as previously stated unless (they) re-reside in South Africa on a pathway to possible permanent residence with an eligible visa again. This is not applicable to those who were born in South Africa or the UK and former colonies or obtained their citizenship by descent and have since lost it.\n\nMany South Africans have claims to another citizenship, in particular Jews' ancestors who came from the Baltic region or those who were deported from Germany during the Second World War and deprived of their German citizenship and possessions. There is a huge Irish community who declares themselves Irish but do not know they are entitled to an Irish passport by an application. (see: Demographics of South Africa).\n\nThe information below is informative and should be viewed as a summary of the influence and History of the presence of the British Nationality Law in South Africa as well as the present effects and entitlements:\n\n\nBetween 1949 and 1961, all South African citizens remained \"British subjects\" by virtue of their South African citizenship whilst South Africa remained an independent Commonwealth nation, this was known as a Dominion prior to 1949, similarly in what is known today as a Commonwealth citizen under the U.K. Nationality Law. During this period South Africans were regarded as: [British Subject: Citizen of the Union of South Africa/ Union National, a British Commonwealth Nation/ Citizen]. The passport's format was similar to a CUKC passport and included the words “British Subject” inside as with all Commonwealth realms at the time.\n\nThis was ended in 1961 when South Africa left the British Commonwealth on becoming a Republic, and formally abandoned all of its connections, with Union nationals becoming citizens of the Republic of South Africa. By the time South Africa returned to the Commonwealth in 1994, the phrase \"British Subject\" had been replaced by \"Commonwealth citizen\". Australia was the last to phase out British Subject in the Citizenship law which was in 1986.\n\nThe full title of a South African citizen presently is: Republic of South African Citizen, a Commonwealth Citizen either * with or without the Right of Abode in the United Kingdom \"(formerly British Subject).\"\n\nRight of Abode is the right for its holder to remain in the UK indefinitely (indefinite relationship) without immigration control or restrictions as long as the right can be proved. It is viewed as a status greater than Indefinite Leave to Enter/ Remain (also referred to as Permanent Residency).\n\nHolders of Right of Abode (except British Citizens) must have a Certificate of Entitlement in their passport as proof that their right exists or describing them as a British Subject with the Right of Abode in their British Subject Passport or hold a British Citizen (ROE co-exists with British Citizenship). Those who hold the ROE as a stand-alone status without Citizenship of the United Kingdom must be a Commonwealth Citizen, also applicable to some (British) Nationals which include some British Subjects and some British Overseas Citizens. All British Citizens have the ROE, however ulike British Citizenship which contains the Right of Abode regardless of personal circumstances, the Right of Abode as a Commonwealth Citizen including some forms of British Nationality can be revoked in cases such as in criminal conduct or applications made in fraud which are assessed incorrectly.\n\nAs South Africa was a foreign country (under United Kingdom law) between 1 January 1973, the date the Immigration Act 1971 came into force in the UK, and 1 January 1983 (when the British Nationality Act 1981 came into force) South African Citizens cannot have right of abode in the UK unless they also held before 1983 and still hold citizenship of another Commonwealth country (such as by descent from their parent, e.g. Australia or Zimbabwe which did not cease to be Commonwealth Nations under U.K. Law) or of the UK itself, the holders would most likely have acquired that Citizenship by descent from a parent who was a Citizen of that Commonwealth Country at the time of their birth or through marriage. A Present Day Commonwealth country refers to any country within the Commonwealth of Nations, for instance, Australia, New Zealand or Canada. Since Queen Elizabeth II is not the head of state in South Africa (Queen/ monarch), as South Africa is a Republic, the Queen is the head of the Commonwealth of Nations only and is not the Constitutional Monarch which is the case for systems of the Monarchy for 16 of the Commonwealth nations which are known as realms (including the United kingdom).\n\nThis particularly affects South Africans born before 1983 to a British mother, who would have otherwise acquired the right of abode in the UK on 1 January 1983. Many South Africans possessing Zimbabwean Citizenship have the Right of Abode if their mother was born in the UK prior to 1983 even though Zimbabwe is not part of the Commonwealth under their own laws, but has since applied to re-join or “re-establish” the connection.\n\nBritish Nationality: Citizenship of the \n\nThe changes to British nationality law on 30 April 2003 have since allowed those born in South Africa from 8 February 1961 to 31 December 1982 to a UK-born, naturalized or registered citizen mother to apply for registration as a British citizen (by descent) [which is a less regarded version of British Citizenship by Birth or Naturalization or *some registrations] and with this comes the right of abode in the UK as British Citizenship coexists with the Right Of Abode. This could also enable Citizenship to be passed onto the Grandchildren in various circumstances. This concession is not specific to South African citizens, this applies to all countries including non-Commonwealth realms and members such as the United States and its territories.\n\nIt remains very difficult to obtain many documents from South Africa's Department of Home Affairs for registration. Nationality was not considered something of great significance prior to 1983 (before many governments enforced major immigration changes), nor was this communicated by the U.K. Government frequently unless enquired about usually from the High Commissions. Travel was limited from South Africa due to strict laws imposed by the Apartheid regime, thus many individuals have misplaced their documents which could very well have helped many apply for Registration as a British Citizen by Descent today, many also never requested them.\n\nFor those with a UK born mother, it is important to note that applying for a UK Visa is particularly difficult as South Africa was not always part of the British Commonwealth although is part of the new Commonwealth. The individuals affected are those born to British mothers between 1961 and 1982. The rule of who can possess the Right of Abode is very controversial but in most instances, those who apply for a Visa will generally have their applications refused. Those who later apply for a Certificate of Entitlement as an alternative entry method will also have their applications refused which then leaves them in a difficult situation whereby both the Certificate of Entitlement and UK Standard Victor Visa (C) are usually refused due to the officer not being aware of these restrictions when a British-born mother is mentioned in applications. Therefore, it is imperative to make a claim to register as a British Citizen by Descent if born to a British Mother prior to 1983 to avoid any travel complications. The only associated cost is the Certificate of Citizenship collection of £80.00 as of September 2018.\n\nRegistration as a British Citizen by marriage is also one of the common ways to register if married to a British man prior to 1983.\n\nIt is possible to obtain British citizenship by double descent (from the grandparent) in numerous instances by registration of which some include:\n\n1) +The parent of the child has the Right of Abode and is some form of a British National (e.g. British Citizen) by descent and has spent 3 years in the UK either prior to their birth or before their 18th birthday which would allow their minor child to become registered through the child's grandparent as long as it is within a specific timeframe (must be registered before the child turns 18), child does not have to live in the UK.\n\n2)There is substantial proof that the Grandparent is/ was a British Citizen, their child was either born in a former Colony (between a certain number of years) or did not possess a passport, this will ultimately enable the grandchild to apply for British Citizenship by Registration but the law makes it unclear whether the parent would first have to be British / obtain or possess the ROA. This would essentially confer British Citizenship by 'Double Descent'.\n\n3) Another way is if the mother registered before 1983, the child could potentially become registered.\n\n4) There is the possibility for a child to become Registered as a British Citizen from their British Grandfather if the child's parent became British by Descent at birth automatically but was not able to register her child's birth at the High Commission due to discrimination in the past: the ability in the case: Grandfather whose female child had a child can apply to register.\n\nOther ways include:\n\n5) Children born prior to 2006 to an unmarried British father can Register as a British Citizen.\n\nRegistration: The term registration refers to gaining British Citizenship where it was previously not available (obtained).\n\nRegistration of different forms can make one a Citizen by Descent, by Marriage and even by Double Descent in some instances, and so forth.\n\nSince claims by double descent are very difficult and require an explanation, the UK Ancestry Visa was introduced (read below); this enables the acquisition of Citizenship in the form of \"otherwise than by descent\" by Naturalization which can be transmitted by descent upon a successful application for British Citizenship after meeting the basic residence requirement of 5 year then a further 1 year as the holder of Indefinite Leave to Remain/ Enter, whereas Citizenship by Double \"Descent\" can only be transmitted in limited circumstances.\n\n+Registering as a British Citizen can sometimes assist the child of the grandparent to become British as Registration generally refers to (otherwise than by descent).\n\nNaturalization is a process of becoming a British Citizen after meeting a residence requirement of 5 years, then a further one year as a ' Permanent Resident' which differs from registration where there is generally no residence requirement.\n\nAs for people born on or after 1 January 1983, they can only possess the Right of Abode to the United Kingdom if they hold British Citizenship.\n\nIf South Africa had remained a Permanent Member of the Commonwealth, those born prior to 1983 to British mothers would have possessed the Right of Abode however, those born after 1983 are British Citizens by descent and can choose whether to have a Certificate of Entitlement in their South African (Commonwealth) Passport or hold a British Passport irrespective of the fact that South Africa became a Commonwealth Nation again in 1994 (period of rejoining), women could only pass on their citizenship after 1983.\n\nMuch of what is seen above is based on previous gender discriminatory laws where children could not enjoy the same rights had their father's been British at the time of birth and is a summary only.\n\nFollowing South Africa's return to the Commonwealth in 1994, South Africans are treated as \"Commonwealth citizens\" in the United Kingdom and amongst other Commonwealth Countries (formerly British Subjects). This includes the following benefits:\nThis is a five year's entry clearance (visa) which enables the holder to eventually apply for Indefinite Leave to Remain/ Enter (Permanent Residence) after five years of stay then eventually British Citizenship after a waiting period of one-year by Naturalization, which is in total 6 years of residence. Children (minor) of the qualifier are encouraged to join the UK Ancestry Visa holder as a dependent prior to their eighteenth as they will not be able to join the qualifier in the UK at the age of majority and will therefore be required to make their own method of entry unless they decide to join their parent's by switching from a Visa other than the Standard Visitor Visa (whilst in the UK) or whilst the parent is a Permanent Resident which is on an unlimited-time Family Visa, the child could become a British Citizen as well at a later date. There is no age restrictions for spouses. It is important to note that unlike other UK Work Visas, the Ancestry Visa cannot be revoked as it is ancestral right. Once the right is established, it is indefinite but the Visa will always need to be valid in order to use that right for entry/ re-entry into the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\n\nThus, if a Five Year Entry Clearance/ Visa is approved, it will be the qualifier's responsibility to ensure that the visa is valid throughout the length (they) anticipate to remain in the UK and Crown Dependencies. Once the initial Visa expires, it can be extended whilst in the UK or a new Visa can be applied for outside the UK but the right would then need to be re-established (not applicable for extensions of visas from the UK). Border processing is less demanding when in possession a UK Ancestry Visa.\n\n+A non-British Citizen from another Commonwealth Nation residing in the UK can simply vote.\n\nThere are no specific concessions in terms of eligibility for British citizenship, and South Africans must meet the same rules for registration or naturalisation as citizens of any other foreign country. It was however possible for a citizen of the British Commonwealth (other than UK) to register as a British Subject: Citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies (CUKC) prior to 1983 after 1 year's residence or even register without residing before 1961. South Africans that were in the United Kingdom after South Africa became a Republic were permitted to stay and even register as a CUKC. Those that left but did not register may have a Settled Status and can now register as a British Citizen. Those who do not have a Settled Status may apply for a Resident Return Visa if they are part of the Windrush Countries: Commonwealth Citizens that left the United Kingdom or never left.\n\nSince South Africa became a Republic in 1961 after a referendum was held by the National Party, more than 50% of the country ruled in favour of the pro-Apartheid majority Afrikaner National Party's interest of a new form of government, one completely severed/ free from the Commonwealth of Nations and the Crown and end all ties with it and the Queen, in order to avoid Criticism from the rest of the world by having no connection to the Crown, but in particular to avoid further criticism from the Queen about her South African Government laws of segregation, this then later installed the fate of South Africa.\n\nSouth African Citizens (and other Citizens from the Commonwealth) before 1961 enjoyed benefits with the United Kingdom which included the free movement of Commonwealth Citizens entering the United Kingdom, the ability to apply for British Citizenship after a residence of one year, an equal status shared with British Citizens and other Commonwealth country's Citizens being British Subjects, now Commonwealth Citizens.\n\nToday, despite South Africa being in the Commonwealth as a Republic after it rejoined in 1994, it enjoys virtually none of these previous associations with the U.K. and other Realms such as Australia, Canada, New Zealand nor does it have the Queen as its head as it used to. The working holiday two-year visa scheme was scrapped specifically for South Africa in 2008 due to rising concern.\nBefore 1961 South African citizens could simply arrive in the U.K. without restriction as if it was a domestic trip from the Union of South Africa, passports were not stamped, etc.\n\nAfter South Africa became a republic it continued to have visa-free entry to the United Kingdom for a period of six months until 2009, after which the Home Office implemented visa requirements.\n\nHad the National Party not implemented the Apartheid policy in 1948 and then later become a Republic in 1961, South Africa would have continued to be the Union of South Africa and likely continued its strong connections with the U.K. and other Commonwealth Realms; it would have been a very different country today.\n\n\n"}

Redfern was an original cast member of children's variety show, \"Young Talent Time\" from April 1971 to early 1972. According to Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, he \"possessed a booming, mature voice which belied his tender age... [he] scored four Top 40 hit singles and sold more than $1.3 million worth of records.\" His equal highest charting singles were the double-A sided covers of \"Rainbow on the River\"/\"We'll Meet Again\" (November 1972), and \"Venus\" (August 1973), which each peaked at No. 8 on the \"Go-Set\" national charts.\n\nJamie Redfern was born on 9 April 1957 in Liverpool to Sam and Mary Redfern; he has five siblings, including his younger brother, Derek Redfern. The family emigrated to Australia and settled in Melbourne. He took singing lessons with United States-born theatre actor and singer, Evie Hayes. He made his TV debut in 1964 on \"Brian and the Juniors\", a children's variety-talent series, hosted by Brian Naylor on HSV-7 and remained with the show until 1970. In 1968 he appeared alongside Happy Hammond in an early colour television demonstration for the same channel. Redfern also guested on \"Happening '70\" (1970) and \"Happening '71\" (1971), which were co-produced by former pop star, Johnny Young, and his associate, Kevin Lewis.\n\nIn April 1971 Redfern became an original cast member of the Australian children's variety show, \"Young Talent Time\", hosted by Young and co-produced by Lewis and Young. Hayes was a long-term judge on the program. He was appointed to the Young Talent Team without an audition, Young recalled \"He came in, he was only 13, 14 or something, and, er, what a voice. He'd could just stand there and sing a song without any accompaniment. You know, the true boy soprano with a really, really big powerful voice.\" His father, Sam, was his road manager and his brother, Derek, was a latter day Young Talent Team member.\n\nYoung arranged to have Redfern signed with Festival Records, which issued his debut single in 1971. It was a cover version of \"The Little White Cloud\", which peaked in the \"Go-Set\" National Top 60. It was recorded as part of his debut album, \"When You Wish upon a Star\" (1971), at T.C.S. Studios, Melbourne, with Young as record producer. The album peaked at No. 16 on the \"Go-Set\" Top 20. At the \"TV Week\" King of Pop Awards for 1971, he won the Outstanding Newcomer category, which was presented by visiting US entertainer, Liberace. His second single, \"When You Wish upon a Star\" (1971) reached the \"Go-Set\" Top 40 in February of the following year.\n\nIn mid-1972 Redfern toured the US with his mentor, Liberace. He was described by \"Australian Women's Weekly\"s Dita Cobb as \"a lovely contrast to the local product of his age. Americans adore him. He is so fresh and funny and unassuming and downright young. Nothing seems to have gone to his head.\" Redfern remembered his early US performances, \"lt was great... I was nervous at first. I got songs in the wrong order and the band was playing different music from what I was singing. But it soon straightened out, and I loved the excitement every night.\"\n\nAt the \"TV Week\" King of Pop Awards for 1972 he won Most Popular Australian Album for \"When You Wish upon a Star\". His second studio album, \"Sitting on Top of the World\" (1972), also reached No. 16. It provided a double-A sided single with his versions of \"Rainbow on the River\"/\"We'll Meet Again\" (November 1972), which peaked at No. 8. At 15 he was the youngest Australian artist to have a top 10 hit until Nikki Webster's \"Strawberry Kisses\" in June 2001.\n\nIn January 1973 he briefly returned to Australia to record an album, \"Johnny Young, The Young Talent Team and Jamie Redfern Sing the Hits!\" (1973), he provided lead vocals for \"Waltzing Matilda\" and joined the then-current Young Talent Team on two tracks; his brother, Derek, sang lead for another track, \"Puppy Love\". His next single, \"Venus\" (1973), was a cover version of Frankie Avalon's song, which peaked at No. 8. For most of that year, Redfern was in the US for another touring stint with Liberace.\n\nRedfern's third studio album, \"Hitch a Ride on a Smile\" (1974), provided the title track as its lead single in March, which reached the top 30. Also that year he was dubbed the King of Pop at the \"TV Week\" King of Pop Awards for 1974. In the following year he provided a compilation album, \"Jamie Redfern's Golden Hits\". According to Australian music historian, Ian McFarlane, Redfern \"slipped from view\" during that year.\n\nIn May 1977 he was interviewed for \"Flashez\", a youth pop show on ABC TV. In April 1981 he told John Vidler of \"The Australian Women's Weekly\"s \"TV World\" that he was performing regularly at Sydney RSL and Leagues Clubs and clubs in Melbourne. He also worked as a singing instructor and \"tries his hand at penning a few songs.\" He presented \"Jamie Redfern's Rascals\" on Aurora TV.\n\nJamie Redfern married Judy, a former dancer, in about 1997, they have two children. He was the director of the Australian Showbusiness Academy, which ran talent schools in Melbourne's western suburbs. Redfern told Dani Valent of \"The Sydney Morning Herald\", \"If I hadn't been a singer I would have been an Anglican minister. My faith has always been strong and I've got that need and desire to help people and to understand them.\" He told Joel Dwyer of \"Star Weekly\" that his time in the US ended as \"My contracts in Australia were about to run out. There was only about a month to go... but at that time my voice was changing and the keys were having to be brought down... I asked them to give me a break for a year, but nobody did and nobody listened. I do feel a bit resentful about that now. Being a singing teacher, I look after kids' voices and I am very aware of when you need rest and why.\"\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2265492", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2265492", "title": "Shadows in Zamboula", "text": "Shadows in Zamboula\n\n\"Shadows in Zamboula\" is one of the original stories by Robert E. Howard about Conan the Cimmerian, first published in \"Weird Tales\" in November 1935. Its original title was \"The Man-Eaters of Zamboula\".\n\nThe story takes place over the course of a night in the desert city of Zamboula, with political intrigue amidst streets filled with roaming cannibals. This story also introduced a fearsome strangler named Baal-Pteor, who is one of the few humans in the Conan stories to be a physical challenge for the main character himself.\n\nBy present-day sensibilities, the story is seriously marred by including a vicious racial stereotype - blacks as cannibals - though Howard strove to lessen this by making it clear that the cannibals in Zamboula are only the specific blacks from Darfar, other blacks being untainted. A white character, Aram Baksh, proves to be a more sinister antagonist by facilitating, exploiting, and profiting from the cannibalism of the Dafari slaves.\n\nDespite the warning he received in a suq by an elderly nomad, Conan spends the night at a cheap tavern in Zamboula, owned by Aram Baksh. As night falls, a black cannibal from Dafar enters his chamber, by means of a trap door, to drag Conan away and feast on him. All of the Darfarian slaves in the city are cannibals who roam the streets at night. Since the cannibals only prey on travelers, the inhabitants of the city tolerate this and stay locked securely in their homes, while nomads and beggars make sure to spend the night at a comfortable distance from Zamboula. Even worse, Aram Baksh has made a deal with the cannibals - he provides them with \"fresh meat\" and profits from the belongings of his ill-fated guests at the inn. This night, however, the unfortunate cannibal attempts to prey on a fully aware Conan and pays with his life. Realizing his room is actually a trap, Conan escapes into the Zamboulan streets where he encounters both a naked woman and her deranged fiancé. Soon, Conan rescues her from an attack by the cannibals. The woman tells him how she tried to secure her finance's unending affection via a love potion, which instead made a raving lunatic of him. After promising Conan \"a reward\" in return for his assistance, the two attempt to murder a high priest responsible for the lover's insanity.\n\nThe woman is captured in their attempt, and forced - via hypnotism - to dance before the high priest until she is exhausted. Conan, after defeating - quite literally - a strangler named Baal-Pteor at his own game, rescues the woman and kills the corrupt priest. Right before Conan could claim his payment, the woman reveals herself as Nafertari, mistress of the satrap of Zamboula, Jungir Khan (the insane lover). Taking the antidote to Jungir, Nafertari promises Conan a position in her council and vast wealth.\n\nConan, however, leaves the city and reveals to the reader how he had recognized the two almost immediately. He takes his revenge on Aram Baksh, by cutting out Baksh's tongue and slicing off his beard. Soon, Conan renders him mute and unrecognizable. Eventually, he turns Baksh over to the hungry cannibals so they can devour him (one of the most profound displays of Conan's ironic sense of humor). After dealing with Aram Baksh, Conan leaves the city with gold and a magic ring which started the night's intrigues (Conan had stolen it from the insane Jungir during their first encounter), with the intent of selling his prize to another interested party.\n\nThe story was republished in the collections \"Conan the Barbarian\" (Gnome Press, 1954) and \"Conan the Wanderer\" (Lancer Books, 1968). It has more recently been published in the collections \"The Conan Chronicles Volume 1: The People of the Black Circle\" (Gollancz, 2000) as \"Shadows in Zamboula\" and in \"\" (Del Rey, 2005) under its original title, \"The Man-Eaters of Zamboula.\"\n\nThe story was adapted by Roy Thomas and Neal Adams in \"Savage Sword of Conan\" #14.\n\n"}
{"id": "2265493", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2265493", "title": "Pseudospeciation", "text": "Pseudospeciation\n\nPseudospeciation refers to the claim that cultural differences cause humans to separate into different social groups, with different language, dress, customs, etc. These cultural differences are claimed to be analogous to the formation of different biological species (speciation). In the extreme, pseudospeciation leads to dehumanization of other cultural groups (out-groups).\n\nPseudospeciation, according to the \"Oxford English Dictionary\", refers to the tendency of members of in-groups to consider members of out-groups to have evolved genetically into different, separate, and inferior species to their own. The term was first used by Erik Erikson in 1966, according to his biographer, Lawrence J. Friedman. Dehumanization is one possible outcome of pseudospeciation, as is ethnic discrimination or genocide.\n\nFrancisco Gil-White proposed in 2001 that humans evolved in such a way that the brain perceives different ethnic groups to be equivalent to different biological 'species', thus suggesting that pseudospeciation is innate. His hypothesis has yet to receive widespread empirical support. His theory and data are found in \"Current Anthropology\", Vol. 42, No. 4, pp. 515–554.\nPseudospeciation is an especially virulent form of ethnocentrism. Karl Marlantes, in his book \"What It Is Like to Go to War\" (Grove Press, 2011), referred to pseudospeciation by American soldiers in World War II and in Viet Nam as a coping mechanism for dealing with Japanese and Vietnamese soldiers differently from European (Germans and Italians for instance) soldiers in those wars. Since an underlying precept of pseudospeciation is the dehumanization of the enemy, it helps the soldiers rationalize barbaric or socially unacceptable behavior visited upon soldiers of a race and culture visually and contextually different from their own. One example Marlantes posits is the treatment of prisoners, or what might be characterized as the murder of soldiers attempting to surrender.\n"}
{"id": "2265498", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2265498", "title": "The God in the Bowl", "text": "The God in the Bowl\n\n\"The God in the Bowl\" is one of the original short stories featuring the sword and sorcery hero Conan the Cimmerian, written by American author Robert E. Howard but not published during his lifetime. It's set in the pseudo-historical Hyborian Age and concerns Conan robbing a temple museum only to be ensnared in bizarre events and deemed the prime suspect in a murder mystery. The story first saw publication in September 1952 in \"Space Science Fiction\" and has been reprinted many times since.\n\nOne night in the Nemedian municipality of Numalia, the second largest city of Nemedia, Conan enters a fantastic establishment: a great museum and antique house which citizens call the Temple of Kallian Publico.\n\nIn the midst of robbing this museum, Conan finds himself embroiled in a murder investigation when the strangled corpse of the temple's owner and curator, Kallian Publico, is found by a night watchman. Though the Cimmerian is the prime suspect, the investigating magistrate, Demetrio, and the prefect of police, Dionus, show remarkable forbearance. The two allow Conan not only to remain free, but also to keep his unsheathed sword while their nervous men search the shadowy premises. It was a combination of Conan's massive physique, the fiery glare in his eyes, and the insistence that he'll disembowel the first person who tried to apprehend him which kept the royal guards at bay.\n\nAs his on-scene investigation unfolds, the magistrate soon learns from Promero, Publico's clerk, that Publico had received from distant Stygia a strange bowl-like sarcophagus which now lies unsealed, open, and empty. This sarcophagus was said to be a priceless relic found among the darkened tombs far beneath the Stygian pyramids and sent to Caranthes of Hanumar, Priest of Ibis, \"because of the love which the sender bore the priest of Ibis\". Intercepting this rare item meant for Caranthes, Publico had believed the sarcophagus contained the fabled diadem of the giant-kings whose primordial kin dwelt in that dark southern land before the ancestors of the Stygians arrived. However, the object contained within was never the diadem, but something of a more insidious nature.\n\nWhile the magistrate and his men are baffled when uncovering this aforementioned information, the reader quickly begins to suspect the murderer may have been something other than entirely human and was contained within the now-opened sarcophagus.\n\nAn inhuman scream forces the police to retreat from the museum, leaving Conan to fend for himself with the roaming \"murderer\". Soon, Conan eventually locates the culprit whom he hesitantly dispatches with his long sword.\nThe original version of the story was rejected by pulp magazine \"Weird Tales\" in Howard's lifetime and only rediscovered in 1951. It was then edited by L. Sprague de Camp for publication, and this edited version was the first version to see print. Several other differently-edited versions followed. The unedited, original version was only printed in 2002 with \"\".\n\nMany of the changes made to the story by de Camp were slight. They have been characterized as technically correct and giving greater precision to the text, but as losing some of the richness and energy of Howard's original. One instance of the differences in texts follows (the first is by Howard, the second by de Camp):\n\nDe Camp's editorial work on both this and other Howard Conan stories, in which he reportedly substantially altered and rewrote whole sections, often to include references to his own work, have been decried by Howard purists.\n\nEverett F. Bleiler, commenting on the edited text, described \"The God in the Bowl\" as \"a primitive detective story\" and found it to be \"not very good\". Carson Ward commented further: \"A more fitting term would be \"an anti detective story\"- since it turns upside down the basic conventions of the genre. It begins in normal detective story fashion - a murder is discovered, the police arrives, a rationalist detective (Dionus) starts a thorough investigation, discards red herrings, and looks for the real culprit. But in total opposition to the conventional ending of a detective story - i.e, the detective solving the mystery and triumphantly apprehending the culprit - 'God in Bowl' ends with the forces of law and order totally routed, detective and constables fleeing the scene in panic. The stage is left to the clash of primeval forces, the barbarian from the north against the sinister magic from the south. The outcome is entirely due to Conan's sword-arm. The laws and criminal procedures of the surrounding city and kingdom are effectively nullified.\"\n\nReprints of this story have appeared in the collections \"The Coming of Conan\" (Gnome Press, 1953) and \"Conan\" (Lancer Books, 1967). It has most recently been republished in the collections \"The Conan Chronicles Volume 1: The People of the Black Circle\" (Gollancz, 2000) and \"\" (Del Rey, 2003). Recent versions have removed all alterations made by L. Sprague de Camp.\n\nThe story introduces the god Ibis and his priest, Caranthes of Hanumar, but not much is told of them - except for the evident fact that somebody in sinister Stygia disliked the priest (and presumably, his god) enough to spend considerable effort in the attempt to kill him. Howard never made much more of Ibis in the rest of the canonical Conan stories, leaving him a rather obscure feature of the Hyborian age. But, some writers of future Conan stories gave Ibis a more prominent role. In particular, the plot of Sean A. Moore's \"Conan and the Grim Grey God\" takes up in detail thousands of years' of the history of Ibis and his priesthood, and their hereditary conflict with the Stygian priests and gods.\n\nThe story was adapted by Roy Thomas and Barry Smith in Marvel Comics' \"Conan the Barbarian\" #7 (\"The Lurker Within\", July 1971) and by Kurt Busiek and Cary Nord in Dark Horse Comics' \"Conan\" #10 & 11.\n\n"}
{"id": "2265503", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2265503", "title": "Quentin Durward", "text": "Quentin Durward\n\nQuentin Durward is a historical novel by Walter Scott, first published in 1823. The story concerns a Scottish archer in the service of the French King Louis XI (1423–1483).\n\n\"Quentin Durward\" was composed in a remarkably short space of time. After carrying out some preparatory research towards the end of 1822 Scott began writing in January 1823 and supplied the finishing sentences in response to a request from his coadjutor James Ballantyne on 3 May.\n\nScott's principal source was the \"Mémoires\" of Philippe de Commines. As usual he adapts historical facts freely in the construction of his fiction, though he generally follows Comines' balanced approach to the character of Louis XI. He was able to make substantial use of other documents and the editorial commentary in the collection in which Comines was included, the first series of the \"Collection complete des mémoires relatifs a l'histoire de France\" by [Claude Bernard] Petitot (1819‒26). Occasional details are drawn from a wide range of historians, most of whom were more hostile to Louis. It is likely that some details for Scott's descriptions of northern France were derived from manuscript material deriving from continental journeys by his friend James Skene of Rubislaw. For his gipsy material Scott relied largely on two works: \"'Dissertation on the Gipseys ... from the German of H. M. G. Grellmann\" (1807), and \"A Historical Survey of the Customs, Habits, and Present State of the Gypsies\" by John Hoyland (1816).\n\nThe first edition was published in three volumes in London on 17 May 1823 and in Edinburgh two days later. As with all the Waverley novels before 1827 publication was anonymous. In 1830 Scott provided it with an introduction and notes for the 'Magnum' edition, where it appeared in two volumes in December 1831 and January 1832. The standard modern edition, by J. H. Alexander and G. A. M. Wood, was published as Volume 15 of the Edinburgh Edition of the Waverley Novels in 2001: this is based on the first edition; the 'Magnum' material appears in Volume 25b.\n\nThe plot centres on the medieval rivalry between Louis XI of France and Charles the Bold, Duke of Burgundy. Louis incites the citizens of Liège to revolt against Charles, and they seize and murder Charles's brother-in-law, Louis de Bourbon, Bishop of Liège, under the command of Louis's ally, William de la Marck, who was hoping to install his son in Louis de Bourbon's place (a real historical event which occurred in 1482).\n\nAt the time of the murder, Louis is present in Charles' camp at Peronne, hoping to fool him with a false display of friendship. Charles, however, sees through his mask of deceit, accuses him of instigating the uprising, and has him imprisoned. Louis's superior coolness of mind permits him to allay Charles's suspicions and to regain his liberty. In a sub-plot, the Burgundian heiress Isabelle de Croye takes refuge at Louis's court when Charles attempts to give her hand in marriage to his odious favourite Campo-Basso. Louis, in turn, resolves to give her in marriage to the bandit-captain William de la Marck, and sends her to Flanders under the pretence of placing her under the protection of the Bishop of Liège. She is guarded on her journey by Quentin Durward, an archer, who has left behind poverty in Scotland to join the Archers of Louis's Scottish Guard. Quentin prevents the intended treachery and earns Isabelle's love. Charles, though, promises her in marriage to the Duke of Orléans (heir to the French crown) but she refuses, and, in anger, the Duke promises her to whoever brings him the head of de la Marck. This Quentin does with the help of his uncle, Ludovic Lesley, and wins Isabelle's hand.\n\nThe story takes place in the year 1468. The age of feudalism and chivalry was passing away, and the King of France was inciting the wealthy citizens of Flanders against his own rebellious vassal the Duke of Burgundy. Quentin Durward had come to Tours, where his uncle was one of the Scottish body guard maintained by Louis XI, to seek military service, and was invited by the king, disguised as a merchant, to breakfast at the inn, and supplied by him with money. Having narrowly escaped being hanged by the provost-marshal for cutting down Zamet, whom he found suspended from a tree, he was enlisted by Lord Crawford, and learned the history of Jacqueline. In the presence-chamber he was recognised by Louis, and the royal party were preparing for a hunting excursion, when the Count of Crèvecœur arrived with a peremptory demand for the instant surrender of the duke's ward, the Countess of Croye, who had fled from Burgundy with her aunt to escape a forced marriage; and proclaimed that his master renounced his allegiance to the crown of France. In the chase which followed Durward saved the king's life from a boar, for which service Louis, after consulting with his barber, entrusted him with the duty of conducting the Countess and Lady Hameline, ostensibly to the protection of the Bishop of Liege, but really that they might fall into the hands of William de la Marck. After proceeding some distance they were overtaken by Dunois and the Duke of Orléans, who would have seized the countess, but were prevented by Lord Crawford, who arrived in pursuit and made prisoners of them. Then Hayraddin came riding after them, and under his guidance they journeyed for nearly a week, when Quentin discovered that the Bohemian was in league with De la Marck. He accordingly altered their route, and they reached the bishop's castle in safety.\n\nA few days afterwards, however, it was assaulted by the citizens, and Hayraddin having effected Lady Hameline's escape with Marthon, Quentin rushed back to save the countess, and, at Gieslaer's suggestion, Pavilion passed them as his daughter and her sweetheart into the great hall where the outlaw, who was known as the Boar of Ardennes, was feasting with the rioters. The bishop, who was also governor of the city, was then dragged in, and, having denounced his captor, was murdered by a stroke of Nikkel Blok's cleaver. There was a shout for vengeance, but De la Marck summoned his soldiers, upon which Quentin held a dirk at the throat of his son Carl, and exhorted the citizens to return to their homes. With the syndic's help Lady Isabella and her protector reached Charleroi, where she was placed in a convent, while he carried the news to the Duke of Burgundy, at whose court Louis, with a small retinue, was a guest. Charles, in a furious rage, accused the king of being privy to the sacrilege, and caused him to be treated as a prisoner.\n\nAt a council the following day he was charged with abetting rebellion among the vassals of Burgundy, and the countess was brought as a witness against him. She admitted her fault, and Quentin Durward was being questioned respecting his escort of her, when a herald arrived with a demand from De la Marck to be acknowledged as Prince-Bishop of Liège, and for the release of his ally the King of France. Louis replied that he intended to gibbet the murderer, and the messenger, who was discovered to be Hayraddin, was sentenced to death, the quarrel between the duke and the king being at the same time adjusted, on the understanding that the Duke of Orléans should marry Lady Isabelle. Crèvecœur, however, interceded for her, and it was arranged that whoever should bring the head of the Boar of Ardennes might claim her hand. Quentin, who had learnt his plans from the Bohemian, advanced with the allied troops of France and Burgundy against his stronghold, and a desperate battle ensued. At length the young Scot was in the act of closing with De la Marck, when Pavilion's daughter implored his protection from a French soldier; and, while placing her in safety, his uncle La Balafré fought the ruffian, and carried his head to the royal presence. Lord Crawford declared him to be of gentle birth, but the old soldier having resigned his pretensions to his nephew, King Louis vouched for Quentin's services and prudence, and the duke being satisfied as to his descent, remarked that it only remained to inquire what were the fair lady's sentiments towards the young emigrant in search of honourable adventure, who, by his sense, firmness and gallantry, thus became the fortunate possessor of wealth, rank and beauty.\n\n\"Principal characters in bold\"\n\n\nVolume One\n\nIntroduction: In the course of an extended residence in France the Author comes across some family papers in the Chateau de Hautlieu, the basis of the narration that follows.\n\nCh. 1 The Contrast: The calculating Louis XI and the impulsive Charles the Bold of Burgundy are set against each other.\n\nCh. 2 The Wanderer: Quentin, a Scottish archer in search of mercenary employment in France, encounters Maitre Pierre and a companion; after attending a hunting-mass they approach the royal castle of Plessis.\n\nCh. 3 The Castle: Maitre Pierre conducts Quentin past the castle to an inn.\n\nCh. 4 The Dejeuner: Maitre Pierre and Quentin discuss the archer's employment over breakfast.

Particularly appreciated were the witty Introduction, the contrasting depictions of Louis and Charles, the striking incidents and descriptions, the control of the plot (though some thought it thin), and the vivid presentation of an interesting and unfamiliar period. The most common adverse criticisms were that historical analysis was too prominent, threatening to overpower the fiction, and that the female characters were weak. Sales in Britain were initially rather slow, perhaps because it came too quickly after \"Peveril of the Peak\", but it was an immediate hit on the Continent.\n\n\n"}

Her feast day is 23 October.\n\nOda was born blind and her father sent her on pilgrimage to Liège to visit the relics of Saint Lambert. While praying at Saint Lambert's grave she was miraculously cured of her blindness. The miraculous cure of Oda is recorded in Saint Lambert's 8th century \"vitae.\" Vowing to dedicate her life to God, she returned to Scotland.\n\nAccording to records written in the 13th century, her father wanted her to arrange a marriage for her. Because of her vow she and her maid fled across the North Sea. After a pilgrimage to Rome and Monte Sant'Angelo sul Gargano, Oda prayed in various villages in the Netherlands and Belgium and finally settled in Venray, only to be repeatedly disturbed by magpies. Seeking solitude, she fled from the magpies and the birds led her to the open space in the forest. There the villagers built a hut for her.\n\nIn order to protect their humble shelter from the wind, hail, rain and snow and to hide from the view of the world, Oda planted some bushes. The following day they had already grown into a thick hedge. Her father sought for her, and as in the story of St. Dymphna, her location was disclosed by her use of coins from her homeland. However, when he attempted to approach her hut, magpies repeatedly drove him off. Eventually he gave up and returned to Scotland without her. She remained there as a hermitess.\n\nSaint Oda is usually depicted wearing a long blue gown with one shoulder bare. She usually carries a staff or a book (symbolic for her cure of blindness). She is always shown with a magpie on her hand and a crown under her feet (symbolic of her rejection of her earthly father's kingdom).\nAfter Oda's death, her humble hut became a place of pilgrimage. \"Saint Oda's place in the woods\" became the town of Sint-Oedenrode, Netherlands (in Dutch, a small manmade open space in the woods is called a 'rode'). Like the flag of Scotland, the flag of Sint-Oedenrode is a white saltire on a blue field.\nPieces of Saint Oda's skull and teeth are kept in the Saint Martin Church of Sint-Oedenrode. Various statues and paintings are kept in a chapel dedicated to Oda in the church's garden. Pilgrims visited Saint Oda for relief of sore eyes and illnesses related to the head.\n"}

A virtual globe provides the user with the ability to freely move around in the virtual environment by changing the viewing angle and position. Compared to a conventional globe, virtual globes have the additional capability of representing many different views on the surface of the Earth. These views may be of geographical features, man-made features such as roads and buildings, or abstract representations of demographic quantities such as population.\n\nOn November 20, 1997, Microsoft released an \"offline\" virtual globe in the form of \"Encarta Virtual Globe 98\", followed by Cosmi's 3D World Atlas in 1999. The first widely publicized \"online\" virtual globes were NASA World Wind (released in mid-2004) and Google Earth (mid-2005).\n\nVirtual globes may be used for study or navigation (by connecting to a GPS device) and their design varies considerably according to their purpose. Those wishing to portray a visually accurate representation of the Earth often use satellite image servers and are capable not only of rotation but also zooming and sometimes horizon tilting. Very often such virtual globes aim to provide as true a representation of the World as is possible with worldwide coverage up to a very detailed level. When this is the case the interface often has the option of providing simplified graphical overlays to highlight man-made features since these are not necessarily obvious from a photographic aerial view. The other issue raised by such detail available is that of security with some governments having raised concerns about the ease of access to detailed views of sensitive locations such as airports and military bases.\n\nAnother type of virtual globe exists whose aim is not the accurate representation of the planet but instead a simplified graphical depiction. Most early computerized atlases were of this type and, while displaying less detail, these simplified interfaces are still widespread since they are faster to use because of the reduced graphics content and the speed with which the user can understand the display.\n\nAs more and more high-resolution satellite imagery and aerial photography become accessible for free, many of the latest online virtual globes are built to fetch and display these images. They include:\n\n\nAs well as the availability of satellite imagery, online public domain factual databases such as the CIA World Factbook have been incorporated into virtual globes.\n\nThe use of virtual globe software was widely popularized by (and may have been first described in) Neal Stephenson's famous science fiction novel \"Snow Crash\". In the metaverse in Snow Crash there is a piece of software called Earth made by the Central Intelligence Corporation. The CIC uses their virtual globe as a user interface for keeping track of all their geospatial data, including maps, architectural plans, weather data, and data from real-time satellite surveillance.\n\nVirtual globes (along with all hypermedia and virtual reality software) are distant descendants of the Aspen Movie Map project, which pioneered the concept of using computers to simulate distant physical environments (though the Movie Map's scope was limited to the city of Aspen, Colorado).\n\nMany of the functions of virtual globes were envisioned by Buckminster Fuller who in 1962 envisioned the creation of a Geoscope that would be a giant globe connected by computers to various databases. This would be used as an educational tool to display large scale global patterns related to topics such as economics, geology, natural resource use, etc.\n\n\n"}

The banquet, which lasts 4 hours, features music by the United States Marine Band as well as a political roast. There are approximately 200 members of the club, all of them influential politicians and business executives. The club has an invitation system; members are required to be invited to join. Invitations are extended to prospective members annually to fill the spots of recently deceased members. Several Presidents of the United States have been members of the club. The press is not allowed to attend the banquet.\n\nThe club was named in reference to the alfalfa plant's supposed willingness to \"do anything for a drink.\"\n\nIf in attendance, the President of the United States is usually asked to deliver remarks at the banquet. President George W. Bush spoke at the banquet each year of his presidency; the Alfalfa Club was one of only three clubs that his father, George H. W. Bush, was a member of as president. President Obama attended and spoke at the banquet in 2009 and in 2012. Donald Trump has not attended the event, presumably because such social gatherings contend with his campaign platform. \n\nOne of the evening's activities includes the playful nomination of a presidential candidate by the Club's leadership. The candidate is then required to make a speech. Several such candidates became President of the United States after being nominated, including Richard Nixon in 1965 (elected in 1968), Ronald Reagan in 1974 (elected in 1980), and George W. Bush in 1998 (elected in 2000). In 1969, it nominated Harold Stassen. In 2004, the Club nominated Jack Valenti, the former president of the Motion Picture Association of America. Its 2000 nomination was Australian-born James Wolfensohn, constitutionally ineligible for election to the U.S. presidency. In 2001, the presidential nomination went to John McCain. In 2011, Sandra Day O’Connor became the first female president of the club. In 2017, Michael Bloomberg was elected president of the club. In 2018, John Kerry was elected president. In 2019, Mitt Romney was elected. In 2020, David Rubenstein was elected.\n\nThe club was formed by four southerners in the Willard Hotel to celebrate the birthday of Confederate Civil War General Robert E. Lee. It began admitting blacks in 1974 and women in 1994. In 2009, President Barack Obama spoke at the club's annual dinner, saying, \"This dinner began almost one hundred years ago as a way to celebrate the birthday of General Robert E. Lee. If he were here with us tonight, the General would be 202 years old. And very confused.\"\n\nIn addition to its January banquet in Washington, the club previously held an annual summer picnic.\n\nIn 1986, William H. Rehnquist's membership in the club became the subject of discussion in a Senate Judiciary hearing after Rehnquist was nominated to be Chief Justice of the United States. He described the club as one that \"met once a year to listen to patriotic music and 'hear some funny political speeches and said \"he did not think his membership in such a once-a-year group violated the canons of judicial ethics.\"\n\nIn 1994, after a boycott by President Bill Clinton over a lack of women in the club, the club admitted its first women members, Sandra Day O'Connor, Elizabeth Dole, and Katharine Graham, whose father, Eugene Meyer, had also been a member.

This treaty implies that Alaksandu had previously secured a treaty with Muwatalli's father, Mursili II, as well.\n\nAlaksandu was a successor of one Kukkunni, although it is not known if he was his immediate successor. Muwatalli recalls the friendship of Kukkunni with his own grandfather, Suppiluliuma I, and further evokes over three centuries of friendship between the Hittites and Wilusa dating back to the reign of Hattusili I.\n\nMuwatalli in his letter downplays the importance of royal ancestry, suggesting that Alaksandu had come to power by other means than regular succession, so that Alaksandu is not necessarily a blood-relation of Kukkunni's. This has been taken as a hint that he may have been an early Greek ruler called Alexander, and he has been associated with Homer's \"Alexandros\" of \"Ilios\", who is better known by his nickname Paris of Troy. However this is uncertain, since Alaksandu lived at least half a century before the generally agreed date of the Trojan War, although the name \"Alaksandus\", which does not conform to the Anatolian onomastic tradition, must be a transcription of the Greek name \"Alexandros\". One of three gods guaranteeing the terms of the treaty on the side of Alaksandu is the \"Stormgod of the Army\", Apaliunas (\"A-ap-pa-li-u-na-aš\"), who is usually equated to Apollo. Apollo is portrayed in the \"Iliad\" as the foremost champion of the Trojans and the one who helped Paris kill Achilles. Another deity in the letter was a local goddess of springs named Kaskalkur.\n\nThis chronology is consistent with the archaeology of Troy (assuming its identity with Hisarlik), which shows that Troy VI was destroyed by an earthquake, around 1300 BC, after over 300 years of occupation, and then rebuilt.\n\n\n"}

While \"Accepted\" was not well received by critics, Lively's performance was, earning her a 'Breakthrough Award' from Hollywood Life. In 2007, she played one of the two title characters in \"Elvis and Anabelle\" as Anabelle, a bulimic girl who hoped to win a beauty pageant. Lively said of getting into character for the role that she had 'shed serious weight' for her height. Lively stated that that process was difficult for her because food is \"the No. 1 love of my life.\" MovieLine.com praised her performance in the film and credited it as having been her \"breakthrough role\".\n\nLively was cast in The CW's series \"Gossip Girl\", based on the novel series of the same name by Cecily von Ziegesar, which premiered in September 2007. Already having deferred college for a year, Lively intended to turn the role down and become a student, but was told that she could attend college part-time while filming the show (she later said \"This is advice to anyone: when they say, 'We promise, but we can't put it in writing,' there's a reason they can't put it in writing\"). She played the role of Serena van der Woodsen in the teen drama until 2012 when the show ended. Her first magazine cover was the November 2007 issue of \"Cosmo Girl\", where she discussed her time in high school and her career prior to \"Gossip Girl\".\n\nIn 2008, Lively reprised her role as Bridget in the sequel \"The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2\". Similarly to the first film, Lively's performance was positively received by critics. As of November 2008, the film had earned over $44 million at the box office. In 2009, she appeared as Gabrielle DiMarco in the romantic comedy \"New York, I Love You\", a sequel to the 2006 film \"Paris, je t'aime\". Despite positive critical reception, the film failed at the box office.\n\nOne of Lively's most acclaimed roles to date is her supporting role as the younger version of the title character in \"The Private Lives of Pippa Lee\" (2009). Paul Byrnes, of the \"Brisbane Times\", described Lively's performance in the film as \"sensational\". In October 2009 Lively began filming her scenes for her role as Kristina \"Kris\" Coughlin in the 2010 film \"The Town\", based on Chuck Hogan's novel \"Prince of Thieves\". The film, which was directed by and starred Ben Affleck, was released in the United States on September 17, 2010. In December of that year, Lively appeared in the music video for The Lonely Island's \"I Just Had Sex\" together with Jessica Alba. Lively played Carol Ferris, the female lead and love interest of Hal Jordan in the superhero film \"Green Lantern\", which was released in June 2011. The film grossed a worldwide total of $219,851,172. In 2011 she was featured in the annual \"TIME\" magazine 100 influential people. Additionally, AskMen.com named her the most desirable woman of 2011 and \"People\" magazine named her one of 2012's Most Beautiful at Every Age.\n\nIn 2012, she starred in Oliver Stone's \"Savages\" alongside Taylor Kitsch, Aaron Johnson, Salma Hayek, and John Travolta. Lively replaced Jennifer Lawrence as Ophelia, after the latter dropped out to do \"The Hunger Games\". \"HitFix\" film critic Drew McWeeny praised Lively's performance, which he described as \"smart and sad precisely because she plays O as such a broken, needy little soul\". Also that year, she was selected as the face of the new Gucci fragrance, Gucci Premiere. She appeared in a short film ad directed by Nicolas Winding Refn for the fragrance.\n\nIn October 2013, Lively was named the new face of L'Oreal, marking her first major makeup campaign. Lively starred in the film \"The Age of Adaline\" (2015), opposite Michiel Huisman and Harrison Ford, playing a woman who \"stops aging after recovering from a near-fatal accident.\" The film was a modest commercial success, grossing $65.7 million from a production budget of $25 million. In 2016, Lively starred in the survival horror film \"The Shallows\". It received positive reviews and Lively's performance was praised by critics.\n\nIn 2018, Lively starred in the mystery-thriller \"A Simple Favor\", alongside Anna Kendrick and Henry Golding, and directed by Paul Feig. The film was released on September 14 and Lively's performance was acclaimed. Lively next played the lead, a drug-addicted prostitute turned assassin, in \"The Rhythm Section\", the film adaptation of the Mark Burnell novel of the same name, produced by Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson, and directed by Reed Morano. The film was released from Paramount Pictures on January 31, 2020.\n\nLively describes herself as a \"foodie and cook\", and has said Martha Stewart is her \"idol\". She is also a fan of Nigella Lawson's work. In 2008, Lively baked a cake with Stewart during an episode of \"The Martha Stewart Show\". In 2009, Lively stated that she \"hoped one day to have an interior decorating company\", citing her love for antiques and fascination with \"colors and textures and layering things\". In 2010, she attended a tailor-made workshop at Le Cordon Bleu in Paris, and has spoken of her desire to return to the culinary school for further instruction.\n\nAlso in 2010, Lively spent an evening working as a pastry chef at the renowned Per Se in New York City. She has remarked that, when travelling, she always takes cookery classes to immerse herself in the local culture. In 2010 and again in 2011, Lively spoke publicly of her desire to become a restaurateur. In 2011, she created a s'mores cupcake to be sold at Sprinkles bakeries. In 2012, Lively's wedding reception was featured in \"Martha Stewart Weddings\"; food photography was the focal point of the picture spread. In 2013, she appeared in \"Elle Decor\" to recount her experiences designing a custom La Cornue oven for her newly purchased Bedford home. In 2013, she filmed a cooking segment for \"Vogue\"'s website, demonstrating how to make a brie pastry. In 2014, she launched \"Preserve\", a digital magazine and e-commerce website with hand-made one-of-a-kind items all selected by Lively; on October 9, 2015, Lively closed the site, stating that it had been launched before it was ready, and that she plans to rebuild and relaunch it properly.\n\nDuring the 2008 United States presidential election, Lively expressed her support for Barack Obama. Lively and Penn Badgley appeared in a pro-Obama commercial, as part of MoveOn.org's Youth Vote program. The commercial, directed by Doug Liman, aired during \"Gossip Girl\" on the CW, MTV and Comedy Central. In 2013, she appeared in a video clip for Gucci's \"Chime for Change\" campaign that aims to raise funds and awareness of women's issues in the areas of education, health, and justice.\n\nLively dated \"Gossip Girl\" co-star Penn Badgley for four years but then broke up. Lively first met Ryan Reynolds in early 2010 while filming \"Green Lantern\", in which they co-starred. In October 2011, they began dating. The couple married on September 9, 2012, at Boone Hall Plantation in Mount Pleasant, South Carolina. They have three daughters together: James (December 2014), Inez (September 2016), and a third (2019). The family lives in Pound Ridge, New York.\n\n"}
{"id": "2265563", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2265563", "title": "KCCI", "text": "KCCI\n\nKCCI, virtual and VHF digital channel 8, is a CBS-affiliated television station licensed to Des Moines, Iowa, United States. The station is owned by the Hearst Television subsidiary of Hearst Communications. KCCI's studios are located on Ninth Street in downtown Des Moines, and its transmitter is located in Alleman, Iowa. On cable, the station is available on Mediacom channel 8 in standard definition and on digital channel 808 in high definition.\n\nKCCI started on the air on July 31, 1955 as KRNT-TV, the third television station in Des Moines and the ninth in Iowa. It was owned by the Cowles family, publishers of the \"Des Moines Register\" and \"Des Moines Tribune\" newspapers, along with KRNT radio (AM 1350 and the original KRNT-FM at 104.5, which went dark). The calls stood for the papers' nickname in central Iowa, \"the R 'n T\".\n\nThe Cowles family and rival KSO radio (now KXNO, also owned by the Cowles interests until 1942) both applied for the channel 8 construction permit. A decision was held up due to issues with the Cowles' ownership of \"Look\" magazine. Eventually, the two stations reached a settlement that allowed KRNT to own 60 percent of the TV station and KSO to own 40 percent. Yet once the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) approved the station's license, KRNT immediately bought out KSO's share of the station. KRNT-TV's broadcasting day was originally about five to six hours long, and included a 15-minute news program later in the evening. The station has been part of the CBS television network through its entire history, owing to KRNT radio's long affiliation with the CBS Radio Network.\n\nThe FCC tightened its ownership rules in the 1970s, forcing the Cowles interests to sell one of their Des Moines broadcast outlets. They opted to sell KRNT radio and KRNQ-FM (originally the second KRNT-FM, now KSTZ) to Stauffer Communications in 1974 and retain both newspapers and KRNT-TV, with the callsign changing to KCCI-TV on February 25; the new calls standing for owner Cowles Communications, Inc. (FCC rules at the time had a restriction on call letters being used by TV and radio stations in the same market, but with different ownership, which led to the TV station changing its callsign.)\n\nOver the years, Cowles Communications bought several other media outlets, including KTVH (now KWCH-TV) in Hutchinson, Kansas (and its satellites in the western part of Kansas), WESH-TV in Daytona Beach, Florida and WQAD-TV in the Quad Cities area.\n\nIn 1983, the Cowles family announced it was breaking up its vast media empire, selling off most of its assets except the Minneapolis \"Star Tribune\". While the \"Register\" went to the Gannett Company and the Register and Tribune Syndicate (best known as syndicators of \"The Family Circus\") went to the Hearst Corporation's King Features Syndicate division, KCCI and WESH went to H&C Communications. The two stations were sold again in 1993, this time to Pulitzer. What was then known as Hearst-Argyle Television bought all of Pulitzer's television holdings in 1998.\n\nKCCI began broadcasting in high-definition television on channel 8.1 in 2002. On July 24, 2006, KCCI launched \"Weather Now\", a 24-hour local weather channel that appeared on digital subchannel 8.2 as well as local Mediacom digital cable channel 247, and the station's website until June 30, 2011. On July 1, 2011, KCCI replaced the weather channel with MeTV on subchannel 8.2.\n\nThe station operates a website at www.kcci.com. For several years the station's website was known as www.theiowachannel.com, following the practice of other Hearst-Argyle stations, and people going to kcci.com were redirected to theiowachannel.com. In October 2005, the station switched back to the kcci.com name for its web site, with theiowachannel.com serving as a redirect to kcci.com.\n\nOn December 10, 2008, current KCCI President and General Manager Paul Fredericksen announced a staffing reorganization which eliminated six positions, including on-air talent.\n\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\nKCCI shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 8, on June 12, 2009, the official date in which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station's digital signal relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 31 to VHF channel 8.\n\nSome viewers have had trouble receiving KCCI's channel 8 VHF digital signal, so KCCI has applied for authority to construct a fill-in translator station on its pre-transition channel 31. But on June 12, 2013, the station cancelled the permit.\n\nA weather beacon was once affixed to the auxiliary tower atop the station's downtown Des Moines studios and was a landmark of the Des Moines skyline. The lighted beacon changed colors depending on the forecast:\n\nThe beacon was active until the 1970s energy crisis, then powered back up by the station in 1987. However, an ice storm in January 2010 caused some damage to the weather beacon, but was repaired later that year.\nThe weather beacon was turned off for the last time on the morning of Thursday, September 27, 2012.\nSyndicated programming includes \"The Dr. Oz Show\", \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show\" and \"Inside Edition\".\n\nKCCI alternates Minnesota Vikings preseason football between its main channel and subchannels. Regular season National Football League games on the station primarily involve the Kansas City Chiefs, whose home field is three hours from Des Moines, as well as other teams of regional interest such as the Vikings, Green Bay Packers and Chicago Bears, when CBS carries them.\n\nKCCI presently broadcasts 30½ hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with 4½ hours each weekday and four hours each on Saturdays and Sundays).\n\nAlthough it was the last Big Three station to sign on in the area, channel 8 has been the highest-rated station in Des Moines for most of its history, mainly due to its roots in the \"Register.\" It often garnered more viewers than WHO-TV and WOI-TV combined. However, in the February 2010 sweeps period, KCCI fell to second behind WHO in the mornings and at 6 p.m. The latter was significant, as it was the first time KCCI had lost the lead in that timeslot in memory. In the May 2011 sweeps, KCCI lost the lead at 5 p.m. as well, but still held a narrow lead at 10 p.m. After tight ratings races in 2011 and 2012, in July 2013, KCCI won every time slot, among all audiences as well as the 25- to 54-year-old age group. KCCI also widened its lead over WHO in many slots, including midday and evenings, compared with the year prior.\n\nOn April 20, 2009, KCCI became the first station in Des Moines to broadcast local news in 16:9 widescreen. Even as the other major stations made the upgrade to high-definition local newscasts in the two years following KCCI's upgrade to widescreen, KCCI's newscasts remained in enhanced definition widescreen until April 26, 2011 when it became the last major station in Des Moines to upgrade its local newscasts to high definition beginning with the 5 p.m. newscast.\n\nIn 2009, KCCI won \"National\" Edward R. Murrow Awards for Best Newscast and Overall Excellence. In 2010, KCCI won Regional Edward R. Murrow Awards for Best Newscast and Overall Excellence. In 2009 and 2011, KCCI won the Photography Station of the Year award in the small market division from the National Press Photographers Association (NPPA). The NPPA also named Photojournalist Cortney Kintzer as the Photographer of the Year in Region 5 (Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin and Illinois).\n\nKCCI added a 9 p.m. newscast to its MeTV subchannel on March 21, 2016 to compete with the WHO-produced news airing on KDSM-TV. In some instances, such as live CBS Sports coverage on weekends, other newscasts will move to MeTV.\n\nFormer sports director Heidi Soliday had the distinction of being the first female local sports director in the United States.\n\n\n\n"}

It is an annual college football rivalry game between the Florida Atlantic University Owls and the Florida International University Panthers. The game's winner receives a traveling trophy, the \"Don Shula Award,\" for one year. The current winner is Florida Atlantic, winning 37–7 on November 9, 2019. Florida Atlantic leads the all-time series thirteen games to four.\n\nThe game and trophy are named after former Miami Dolphins head coach Don Shula. Don Shula was the head coach of the Miami Dolphins from 1970 to 1995. Each school's first head coach has previous ties to Don Shula. Florida Atlantic's first head coach Howard Schnellenberger was an assistant of Shula in the 1970s, and FIU's first head coach Don Strock was a player under Shula in the 1970s and 1980s. Don Shula set numerous records as head coach of the Miami Dolphins and his legacy is seen throughout the Miami area. The Shula Bowl pays homage to Shula, to South Florida football and the ties and history of both universities.\n\nThe Shula Bowl was first played at Hard Rock Stadium, then known as Pro Player Stadium, in present-day Miami Gardens, Florida on November 23, 2002. The game alternates between Florida Atlantic and FIU's home fields. Until 2010, Florida Atlantic used Pro Player Stadium (later renamed Dolphin Stadium in 2006) as their home field, where FIU has almost always used FIU Stadium on the FIU campus as its home field. On one occasion, in 2007, FIU used the Miami Orange Bowl in Little Havana, Miami as its home field, while FIU Stadium was undergoing an expansion. The 2007 game was played in the final months of the Orange Bowl before being demolished for the construction of Marlins Park. Beginning in 2012, Florida Atlantic used its newly built FAU Stadium in Boca Raton as its home field, marking the first time the Shula Bowl was played on both rival schools' campuses.\n\nFor years the game was telecast on the ESPN family of networks through an agreement to broadcast games in the Sun Belt Conference. In 2013, both schools moved to Conference USA, and the game was instead aired on Fox Sports 1, as C-USA did not air games on the ESPN networks (save for the conference championship game). In recent years the game has aired on Stadium and is carried locally on WSFL-TV The CW South Florida.\n"}

The beach extends from Xcalak in the south to the southern border of Sian Ka'an in the north, a distance of approximately .\n\nXcalak is approximately south of the Costa Maya cruise port, and the fishing village of Mahahual is only about away. Cruise ships can easily be seen from the village. Mahahual has soft sand beaches, grass thatched palapas, and a coral reef a short distance off-shore called Banco Chinchorro, as well as several bars, restaurants, and shops. A new development called New Mahahual is being created directly inland from the port. When ships are in port, the village is busy with cruise passengers.\n\nCosta Maya's port has a new and modern tourist shopping mall. The center has a central plaza with saltwater pools and 'swim-up' style bars. There are several jewellery stores and many small shops selling ubiquitous souvenir items. It is generally open only to cruise ship passengers.\n\nCosta Maya is the closest port of access to many of the lesser-known Mayan ruins in the Yucatan including Chacchoben and Kohunlich. These sites are substantially less excavated than the better-known pyramids of Tulum and Coba to the north; Chichen Itza and Uxmal in Yucatan.\n\nThe port sustained heavy damage due to Hurricane Dean in August 2007. This included the dock designed for cruise ships. Holland America's Westerdam was the first cruise ship to return to the port since Hurricane Dean on October 31, 2008.\n\nAround 6500 BC the Native Americans started agricultural activities. The agriculture was of the slash and burn type. Around 3500 BC the agricultural skill had developed as such that they formed permanent villages in the center of Mexico. The Maya are not the first culture to appear in Mexico; they were preceded by the Olmecs near the Gulf coast. The first Maya like culture appeared around 200 BC in the south of Mexico (Chiapas).\n\nThe Maya were predominant in three areas: the northern area which is the Yucatán Peninsula, the central area which is the Petén area and the western area which are the lowlands bordering to Belize. The Costa Maya falls under the western lowlands. The agricultural skills evolved between 200 BC and 900 AD to the extent that workers could be made available to build the beautiful cities as we know them today. In the area around the Costa Maya the building styles called Rio Bec and Chennes are found. The Mayan culture weakened during the period of 900 AD to 1200 AD. Other cultures influenced the building styles in that period (an example of this is Tulum).\n\nThe Río Bec and Chennes sites are some of the most recent found in Mexico. Most of the sites were found by rubber farmers scouting the forest in search of rubber trees. The discovered sites are as follows:\n\nDuring the Mayan high times there was a flourishing maritime trade along the Yucatan coast. The Mayans used large dugout canoes. They traded in fabrics, jade, obsidian, salt, and shells. The area of Xcalak was a landing point because of the two openings in the reef. Xcalak means 'the twins' in Yucatec Maya. A small unnamed site was found just east of the current village of Xcalak.\n\nThe first contact between the Spanish conquerors and the Maya took place in 1502 in Honduras. Initial contacts were friendly; however when Francisco Hernández de Córdoba arrived on the Yucatán Peninsula in 1517 intent on conquest, the Maya resisted. Thousands of Spaniards were killed within a short period of time, giving subsequent conquistadores adequate excuse for subjugating the native population.\n\nHernán Cortés landed in 1519 on Cozumel and within three years he had conquered most of the area, with more help from the smallpox with which his men had unintentionally infected the natives, than actual battle. Twenty years later the Mayans suffered their final defeat by Francisco de Montejo. Not content in having reduced the native population by half or more, the Spaniards destroyed many Mayan artifacts in an attempt to suppress the culture itself.\n\nFollowing Mexican independence in 1821, the Mayan territories of Chiapas and Yucatan decided to join the United States of Mexico in 1840.\n\nIn the 19th century Mennonites came to Mexico from the Netherlands. The Mennonites can also be found around the Costa Maya and can easily be recognized by their denim overalls and checkered red shirts.\n\nThe history of Xcalak dates back to pre-Hispanic times, with 16 archaeological sites having been discovered between Punta Herrero (south of Bahia Espiritu Santo) and Boca Bacalar Chico. Seven of these sites are located between Punta Gavilan (just north of Guacamaya) and Boca Bacalar Chico, the border with Belize.\n\nIn the 16th century, English pirates took over a large part of the coast and attacked Spanish ships that transported gold and riches back to Spain. Spain tried to defend its interests by constructing forts such as the one at Bacalar. Pirates continued to devastate the region, intending to take over the entire peninsula in the name of the English Crown. The reign of the pirates lasted until the end of the 19th century, taking advantage of the indigenous rebellions and the abandonment in which the region was found.\n\nAt the end of the 19th Century, the Mexican Navy took control over what is today the state of Quintana Roo. In 1897, during the presidency of Porfirio Diaz, a treaty was signed which established the territorial limits between British Honduras (now Belize) and Mexico. This caused serious problems for Mexico because the territorial limit was at the center of Boca Bacalar Chico canal. This natural canal separates the Xcalak peninsula from Ambergris Key, and as a result, Mexican military vessels lost access to Chetumal Bay and remain at the mercy of Belize for permits.\n\nDue to the lack of access to Chetumal Bay, Brigadier Angel Ortiz Monasterio, the Mexican consulate, commissioned engineer Rebolledo to find a suitable place to build a port in this area. Rebolledo selected Xcalak because two natural entrances through the barrier reef would permit navigation. The port was established in an effort to permanently occupy this area. From this site, Mexico intended to direct a military campaign to stop the supply of arms to the Maya rebels of Quintana Roo, who were participating in what is known as the Caste War. This led to the establishment of a base on the southern limits of Xcalak peninsula.\n\nIn October 1899, a site was constructed on the Zaragoza Canal to provide access to Chetumal Bay. (This canal south of town has recently been reopened and re-dredged in another effort to allow military vessels access to the bay.) At the same time, on the Caribbean coast the widening of the entrance through the reef was initiated. In addition, a 'Decauville' railroad was built between Xcalak and La Aguada (on Chetumal Bay) in order to relieve the boat traffic through the narrow international canal.\n\nThe development resulted in a port system which overcame the lack of a direct entrance into Chetumal Bay. Equipment was unloaded in Xcalak, taken by train to La Aguada, and then reloaded and taken to Payo Obispo, which was founded two years earlier. Thus, the village of Xcalak was founded on May 19, 1900 as the base for the 'Southern Fleet' and the first shipyard in the Mexican Caribbean. At the same time, the first telegraph in the state was built.\n\nWhen the Federal Territory of Quintana Roo was created in 1902, there were three important villages on the coast: Xcalak in the south, Vigia Chico in the middle, and Puerto Morelos in the north. The Xcalak village was the only village in the territory that did not depend on mahogany and chicle (used for chewing gum). Xcalak relied upon fishing and the exportation of coconut. The organization of copra, or coconut ranches, began in Xcalak and expanded to the bay area. Copra exportation eventually replaced fishing.\n\nIn the 1950s, Xcalak's economy was very healthy, boasting developments such as stone and wood construction, an ice factory, and electric plant, storehouses for large quantities of copra, grocery stores, a billiard hall, a movie theater, and an ice cream factory. Xcalak was the most important supply center in the region. After Hurricane Janet (1955), Xcalak was in ruins. Many of its inhabitants died, including the lighthouse keeper and many sailors. The survivors were traumatized and a large group migrated to interior towns. The survivors who remained in Xcalak returned to fishing. The area was repopulated with people from San Pedro and Sarteneja, Belize, as well as from Honduras and El Salvador.\n\nThe fishing trade resulted in social organizations. On October 25, 1959, the Cooperative Fishing Production Society of Andrea Quintana Roo was founded. It consisted of 49 members. Fishing techniques were greatly altered with the arrival of the first outboard motors made by Calipso and Lister.\n\nIn 1980, a gravel road was built, forming the Chetumal − Carrillo Puerto highway. This established a land route between the village of Xcalak and the rest of the state. People often recall that the first vehicle to arrive in the village was a Land Rover.\n\nAt the end of the 1980s Costa de Cocos and the first dive shop, 'Aventuras Chinchorro' (now XTC Dive Center), opened. Soon after that a second dive shop 'Xcalak Dive Center' appeared. These developments increased tourism and marked the beginning of a new period.\n\nOn August 24, 1995, the government of Quintana Roo published the decree for the 'Ecological regulation for the area referred to as the Maya Coast' (Punta Herero - Xcalak). The decree outlined tourism development plans for the Costa Maya corridor. Xcalak was designated as one of the sites for the greatest development. The restoration of the municipal pier in Xcalak was completed at the end of 1995 to facilitate tourism development. In June 1996, a ferry pier was built at La Aguada in order to provide service between Chetumal and Xcalak. At the same time, the existing airstrip in Xcalak was enlarged.\n\nThere are approximately 300 native inhabitants of Xcalak. Most rely on fishing for their livelihood; however, many are now working in tourism and recently the Tourism Cooperative was formed. Officials that have their headquarters in Xcalak include: the Municipal Delegation, State Government representative of the Judicial Police, a port captain, immigration officer, and Navy base. As part of the social structure, other associations have been formed: the Parents Association, the Electricity Committee, the fishing Cooperative, and a Community Committee in which different representatives of all community sectors participate. It is through the Community Committee that issues regarding the management and conservation of natural resources are addressed.\n\nThe resort was hit directly by Category 5 Hurricane Dean in August 2007. The area was also hit significantly by Hurricane Ernesto in early August 2012. Although much of the resort was not hit heavily, the surrounding town of Mahahual has experienced a large amount of damage.\n\nThe Mexican government is trying to improve the standard of living for the indigenous population in the Costa Maya area by developing small scale ecologically-based tourism.\n\nMahahual is to be a larger tourist center with an airport and a large dock for cruise ships.\n\nXcalak is to be preserved as a middle-sized village with tourism based on ecological principles. To achieve this development, ecological laws have been implemented on the Costa Maya. Sian Ka'an South of Tulum is a protected natural reserve, Banco Chinchorro is declared as a protected archaeological marine park and the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System in front of Xcalak is declared a natural reserve park.\n\n"}

{"id": "2265662", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2265662", "title": "Eilhard Mitscherlich", "text": "Eilhard Mitscherlich\n\nEilhard Mitscherlich (; 7 January 179428 August 1863) was a German chemist, who is perhaps best remembered today for his discovery of the phenomenon of crystallographic isomorphism in 1819.\n\nMitscherlich was born at Neuende (now a part of Wilhelmshaven) in the Lordship of Jever, where his father was pastor. His uncle, Christoph Wilhelm Mitscherlich (1760–1854), professor at the University of Göttingen, was in his day a celebrated scholar. Eilhard Mitscherlich was educated at Jever by the historian Friedrich Christoph Schlosser, and in 1811 went to the University of Heidelberg devoting himself to philology, with an emphasis on the Persian language. In 1813 he went to Paris to seek permission to join the embassy which Napoleon I of France was establishing in Persia.\n\nThe abdication of Napoleon Bonaparte in 1814 put an end to this, and Mitscherlich resolved to study medicine in order that he might enjoy that freedom of travel usually allowed in the East to physicians. He began at Göttingen with the study of chemistry, and this so arrested his attention that he gave up his idea of traveling to Persia. From his days in Göttingen dates the treatise on certain parts of Eurasian history, compiled from manuscripts found in the university library and published in Persian and Latin in 1814, under the title \"Mirchondi historia Thaheridarum historicis nostris hucusque incognitorum Persiae principum\".\n\nIn 1818 Mitscherlich went to Berlin and worked in the laboratory of Heinrich Friedrich Link (1767–1851). There he studied phosphates, phosphites, arsenates and arsenites, and was able to confirm the conclusions of Jöns Jakob Berzelius as to their composition. His observation that corresponding phosphates and arsenates crystallize in the same form was the germ from which grew his theory of isomorphism (crystallography), which theory was published in the proceedings of the Berlin Academy of Sciences in December 1819. In that same year Berzelius suggested Mitscherlich to the Prussian education minister Karl vom Stein zum Altenstein as successor to Martin Heinrich Klaproth at the University of Berlin. Altenstein did not immediately carry out this suggestion, but he obtained for Mitscherlich a government grant to enable him to continue his studies in Berzelius' laboratory at the Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm. Mitscherlich returned to Berlin in 1821, and in the summer of 1822 he delivered his first lecture as extraordinary professor of chemistry at the university; in 1825 he was appointed ordinary professor. In 1823 Mitscherlich was elected as foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.\n\nIn the course of investigating the slight differences discovered by William Hyde Wollaston in the angles of the rhombohedra of the carbonates isomorphous with calcite, Mitscherlich observed that this angle in the case of calcite varied with the temperature. On extending this inquiry to other allotropic crystals, he observed a similar variation, and was thus led, in 1825, to the discovery that allotropic crystals, when heated, expand unequally in the direction of dissimilar axes. In the following year he discovered the change, produced by change of temperature, in the direction of the optic axes of selenite. His investigation, also in 1826, of the two crystalline modifications of sulfur threw much light on the fact that the two minerals calcite and aragonite have the same composition but different crystalline forms, a property which Mitscherlich called polymorphism.\n\nIn 1833 Mitscherlich made a series of careful determinations of the vapor densities of a large number of volatile substances, confirming the law of Gay-Lussac. In 1833-34, Mitscherlich investigated the synthesis of diethyl ether from ethanol and sulfuric acid. Through his careful studies, he realized that the acid was not being consumed during the production of the ether, although the reaction would not proceed unless the acid was present. After reviewing Mitscherlich's findings, Swedish chemist Jöns Jacob Berzelius was led to coin the term \"catalysis\" for the acceleration or enablement of a chemical reaction by a substance that itself was not consumed in the reaction. He obtained selenic acid in 1827 and showed that its salts are isomorphous with the sulphates, while a few years later he proved that the same thing is true of the manganates and the sulfates, and of the permanganates and the perchlorates. He investigated the relation of benzene to benzoic acid and to other derivatives. As related by Gustav Rose Mitscherlich turned away from inorganic chemistry (crystallography) and devoted his attention to organic chemistry, starting out with an investigation of fuel and oil. Mitscherlich kept working on problems of organic chemistry until 1845. His interest in mineralogy led him to study the geology of volcanic regions, and he made frequent visits to the Eifel in an attempt to develop a theory on the cause of volcanism. He did not, however, publish any papers on the subject, though after his death his notes were arranged and published by J. L. A. Roth in the Memoirs of the Berlin Academy (\"Ueber die vulkanischen Erscheinungen in der Eifel und über die Metamorphie der Gesteine durch erhöhte Temperatur\", Berlin, 1865).\n\nMitscherlich was an honorary member of almost all the great scientific societies, and received the gold medal from the Royal Society of London for his discovery of the law of isomorphism. He was one of the few foreign associates of the French Institute. In 1855, Mitscherlichwas elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.\n\nIn December 1861, symptoms of heart disease made their appearance, but Mitscherlich was able to carry on his academic work until December 1862. He died at Schöneberg near Berlin in 1863 and was buried in the St Matthäus Kirchhof Cemetery in Schöneberg close to the (eventual) gravesites of Gustav Kirchhoff and Leopold Kronecker.\n\nMitscherlich published, according to the \"Catalogue of Scientific Papers\", some 76 papers, which appeared chiefly in the \"Abhandlungen der Königlichen Akademie der Wissenschaften in Berlin\", in Poggendorff's \"Annalen\", and in the \"Annales de chimie et de physique\". In 1829 the first installment of the first volume of Mitscherlich's \"Lehrbuch der Chemie\" appeared. Not until 1840 the second installment of the second part of this monumental text book was printed. The fourth edition of Mitscherlich's \"Lehrbuch der Chemie\" was published in 1844-1847; a fifth was begun in 1855, but was never completed. A complete edition of his works was published in Berlin in 1896.\n\n\n"}

The epic movie, spanning the periods between 1919 and 1933, was directed by Raoul Walsh and written by Jerry Wald, Richard Macaulay and Robert Rossen.\n\nIt was based on \"The World Moves On,\" a short story by Mark Hellinger, a columnist who had been hired by Jack L. Warner to write screenplays. The movie is hailed as a classic in the gangster movie genre, and considered an homage to the classic gangster movie of the early 1930s.\n\n\"The Roaring Twenties\" was the third and last film that Cagney and Bogart made together. The other two were \"Angels with Dirty Faces\" (1938) and \"The Oklahoma Kid\" (1939).\n\nThree men meet in a foxhole during the waning days of World War I: Eddie Bartlett, George Hally and Lloyd Hart, and experience trials and tribulations from the Armistice through the passage of the 18th Amendment leading to the Prohibition period of the 1920s and the violence which erupted due to it, all the way through the 1929 stock market crash to its conclusion at the end of 1933, only days after the 21st Amendment brought an end to the Prohibition era.\n\nFollowing World War I, Lloyd Hart starts his law practice, George Hally, a former saloon keeper, becomes a bootlegger, and Eddie Bartlett, a garage mechanic, finds his old job filled. At the suggestion of his friend Danny Green, Eddie becomes a cab driver. While unknowingly delivering a package of liquor to Panama Smith, he is arrested. Panama is acquitted and after a short stint in jail, they go into the bootlegging business together. Eddie uses a fleet of cabs to deliver his liquor, and he hires Lloyd as his lawyer to handle his legal issues. He re-meets Jean Sherman, a girl he formerly corresponded with during the war while she was in high school, who is now an adult working at a nightclub. Eddie gives her a job singing in Henderson's cabaret, where Panama is hostess. Eddie wants Jean as his wife, giving her an engagement ring that he asks her to hold until he's saved up enough money to quit the criminal rackets.\n\nEddie and his henchmen hijack a shipload of liquor belonging to fellow bootlegger Nick Brown who had refused to cooperate with him. In charge of the liquor shipment on board is George who proposes that Eddie bring him in as a partner. Eddie agrees and back home they inform the authorities about one of Brown's liquor shipments. After the shipment is confiscated, Eddie and George lead a heist of the warehouse and steal it. As they are leaving, George recognizes one of the watchmen as his former sergeant that he disliked and murders him. After learning of the murder, Lloyd quits with George threatening to kill him if he ever informs on them. In time, as the bootlegging rackets prosper, Eddie sends Danny to arrange a truce with Brown, but Danny's body is dropped off in front of The Panama Club. Eddie goes after Brown for revenge, but George, by now resentful with Eddie's increasing power, tips off Brown, who sets a trap. A gunfight ensues, and Eddie kills Brown while escaping. Suspecting George's betrayal but unable to prove it, Eddie dissolves their partnership.\n\nThings continue to go bad for Eddie as he discovers that Jean has never really loved him and is in fact in love with Lloyd. Subsequently, after speculating in the stock market, Eddie's bootlegging empire crumbles in the 1929 crash. He is forced to sell his cab company to George at a price far below its value. George mockingly leaves Eddie one cab for himself, correctly foreseeing that Eddie will soon have fallen so low that he'll be back to being a mere cab driver.\n\nBy chance, one day Jean steps into Eddie's cab and he renews his acquaintance with her and with Lloyd, meeting their young son. Lloyd is now with the district attorney's office and Eddie is aware that the office is preparing to bring a case against George. Eddie reminds Lloyd that George will still follow through on his threat against Lloyd from years earlier. The encounter leaves Eddie despondent since he's still in love with Jean and he becomes an alcoholic, though he'd never drunk at all during the years that he was bootlegging.\n\nWhen Jean discovers that George is indeed planning to have Lloyd killed, she appeals to the drunken Eddie for help. He initially declines, but ultimately decides to go to George's house to ask him to have mercy on the couple. While there, Eddie is mocked again by George for his shabby looks. Not only does George refuse to cancel the hit on Lloyd, but he decides he'll have to kill Eddie too since he now believes that Eddie will inform on him to the police in order to help Jean. This results in a shootout in which Eddie kills George and some of his men, redeeming himself.\n\nAfter running outside, Eddie is shot in the back by one of George's men and collapses on the steps of a nearby church. As the police arrest the remainder of George's gang, Panama runs to Eddie and cradles his lifeless body. When a police officer begins inquiring about who Eddie was, she replies, \"He used to be a big shot.\"\n\nCredited Cast\n\nUncredited Cast\n\nGladys George had replaced Ann Sheridan who had replaced Lee Patrick who had replaced Glenda Farrell for the character of Panama Smith.\n\nAnatole Litvak was the original director.\n\nThe Carol Burnett Show parodied the movie as \"The Boring Twenties\", with Carol Burnett parodying the Panama Smith character as \"Havana Jones\".\n\nIn 2008, the American Film Institute nominated the film for its Top 10 Gangster Films list.\n\nIn 2009 \"Empire\" magazine named \"The Roaring Twenties\" #1 in a poll of the 20 Greatest Gangster Movies You've Never Seen* (*Probably).\n\n"}

Along with Oscar Wilde's imprisonment for a similar offence, this episode was one of the major events in gay history in England during the 19th century.\n\nThe White Swan on Vere Street in London was established as a molly-house in early 1810 by two men, James Cook (not the seafarer) and Yardley (full name unknown).\n\nThe club had been operating for less than six months when, on 8 July 1810, it was raided by the Bow Street police.

The crowds who turned out to witness the scene were violent and unruly, throwing various objects (including rotten fish, dead cats, \"cannonballs\" made of mud, and vegetables) at the convicted men. The women in the crowd were reported as being particularly vicious. The city provided a guard force of 200 armed constables, half of them mounted and the other half on foot, to protect the men from even worse mistreatment.\n\nA man and a boy, John Hepburn (46) and Thomas White (16, a drummer boy), were convicted of the act of sodomy, despite not being present at the White Swan during the night of the raid. They were hanged at Newgate Prison on 7 March 1811.\n\nVere Street Coterie is also known in connection with alleged same sex marriages there, performed by Reverend John Church.\n\nThe history of the White Swan and the Vere Street Coterie were related by the lawyer Robert Holloway in \"The Phoenix of Sodom\" in 1813.\n\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Draft:English_and_Welsh_executions_in_the_Nineteenth_Century&oldid=885832171\n\n"}

The shooter was identified as Rocori High freshman John Jason McLaughlin, who shot and killed 15-year-old freshman Seth Bartell and 17-year-old senior Aaron Rollins. Prior to the shooting, McLaughlin was described as a \"quiet and withdrawn\" student with severe acne.\n\nOn September 24, 2003, McLaughlin arrived at school with a loaded Colt .22-caliber handgun with the intention of killing Bartell, whom McLaughlin claimed bullied him over his acne. McLaughlin met Bartell and Rollins as they were exiting the school locker room. He shot at Bartell, hitting him in the chest. McLaughlin fired a second shot at Bartell, which missed and hit Rollins in the neck, killing him instantly. Bartell attempted to flee the scene, but was followed by McLaughlin, who fired another shot at Bartell, hitting him in the forehead. Gym coach Mark Johnson then confronted McLaughlin, who initially brandished the gun at Johnson and then emptied the bullets from the gun and dropped it. Johnson secured the gun and took McLaughlin to the school office.\n\nBartell was taken to the St. Cloud Hospital, where he was treated for severe head and brain trauma. Bartell died 16 days later, on October 11, 2003.\n\nThe trial began on July 5, 2005. The defense argued that McLaughlin did not plan to kill anyone and that the teen had only intended to scare Bartell. The prosecution argued that the deaths were premeditated, as McLaughlin had stated to police that he had planned the shooting \"several days in advance\". Six mental health experts were brought in to testify in court. Three of the experts diagnosed McLaughlin with schizophrenia while the other three diagnosed him with major depression in remission and an \"emerging personality disorder\".\n\nMcLaughlin was found guilty of first and second-degree murder.\n\nIn August 2005, he was sentenced with two consecutive prison sentences. McLaughlin was sentenced to life in prison for first-degree murder and 12 years in prison for second-degree murder. Prior to the sentences, McLaughlin's attorneys attempted to have him declared insane at the time of the shootings, which would have resulted with McLaughlin serving his sentence at a mental hospital rather than a correctional facility. The Judge ruled that McLaughlin was sane at the time of the killings based on McLaughlin's writings and videotaped confession, where he detailed his planning of the crime. McLaughlin was also ordered to pay restitution in the amount of $15,000 to the Minnesota Crime Victims Reparations Board.\n\nJason McLaughlin was incarcerated at Minnesota Correctional Facility – Stillwater. He will not be eligible for parole until 2038.\n\nIn September 2006 the families of victims Aaron Rollins and Seth Bartell filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the McLaughlins, the Rocori school district, and former Rocori High School Principal Doug Standke. The families alleged that the school district had prior knowledge of the shootings about a week before their occurrence and that they could have prevented its occurrence. The lawsuit was initially dismissed, but later settled out of court for $200,000.\n\n"}

Classic Mode functions like the original \"Tetris\" game for the Game Boy except with different music and visuals. However, because the cartridge has battery-powered SRAM, it also has the ability to remember high-scores, unlike the original Game Boy game. Puzzle Mode is a twist on the classic gameplay that provides a new scenario. Also included is an editor for making Puzzle levels, and Link capability for competitive multiplayer in either game mode. The console versions also have a two-player Versus Mode, which is essentially puzzle mode with two players racing for the finish line.\n\nThe biggest addition to \"Tetris Plus\" is the Puzzle Mode. The player starts with the first zone, the Egypt; later there are in order: Angkor Wat, Maya and Knossos. The final area, Atlantis, is unlocked by successfully completing the other four stages. Each of the four locations has a different level set. Once the game starts, the player is presented with a cluster of pre-placed bricks, and the professor enters the play-area through a disappearing gate. The objective is to get the professor to the bottom of the screen, by placing blocks and clearing lines, before the spiked ceiling at the top comes down and crushes him.\n\nThe player's goal is to guide this archaeologist to the bottom as fast as possible. Two blocks wide and tall, he will aimlessly walk forward until he bumps into a block, after which he turns around and walks the other way. If he comes across a gap that is large enough for him to fit through, he will fall down onto the blocks below him. Conversely, if blocks are placed on top of him, he will climb up them until he reaches the top. If these blocks lead too closely to the spikes, the professor will die.\n\nUpon starting the level, the spiked ceiling will start at the top of the play area. About once every eighteen seconds, it will move down one row, slowly taking away workable space. The player is able to make the ceiling go back up, however, if they can clear three or four rows at once. The ceiling will also destroy any placed blocks that are in its way. This can be used as a garbage disposal, by having it remove any unwanted pieces until the piece the player wants shows up.\n\nThe game was published in 1996 in the United States by Jaleco, shortly after the company signed an agreement with Blue Planet Software giving Jaleco exclusive rights to publish \"Tetris\" games for the Saturn and PlayStation in the United States for the following two years. The PlayStation version sold well enough to be re-released for the Greatest Hits budget range.\n\nCritical response to the Sega Saturn version was generally unenthusiastic. GameSpot editor Peter Criscuola referred to it as \"a feeble attempt at reviving a legend\", \"GamePro\"s Scary Larry as \"a poor addition to the Tetris library\", and Stephen Fulljames of \"Sega Saturn Magazine\" as \"certainly nothing to get excited about.\" The four reviewers of \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" were more positive than most, with Dan Hsu deeming it \"a good package for even a part-time Tetris fan\" and Sushi-X \"a rewarding title with multiple levels of fun with the same classic challenge.\" The Puzzle Mode was met with disapproval for various reasons: Criscuola said it was too easy, Fulljames said it was frustratingly hard, Scary Larry said it didn't differ enough from the original \"Tetris\", and a \"Next Generation\" critic said it simply wasn't as appealing as the original. Other frequent criticisms were that the graphics are subpar, and that the controls in all the modes are more difficult and counterintuitive than in previous versions of \"Tetris\".\n\nIn a retrospective review, Allgame editor Jon Thompson called the Saturn version \"boring\".\n\n is an arcade game released by Jaleco in 1997.

A slow waltz, the piece uses a repetitive ABCAB structure and a distinctive rising and falling woodwind arpeggio.\n\n\"Sailing By\" is played every night on BBC Radio 4 at around 00:45hrs before the late Shipping Forecast. Its tune is repetitive, assisting in its role of serving as a signal for sailors tuning in to be able to easily identify the radio station. It also functions as a buffer: depending on when the final programme before closedown finishes, \"Sailing By\" (or part of it) is played as a \"filler\" as the forecast starts at 00:48hrs precisely.\n\nIn the 1990s the tune was also adopted for the weekly maritime programme \"Seascapes\" on Ireland's RTÉ Radio 1, ceasing at the end of 2009.\n\nBesides its intended function, \"Sailing By\" is thought of affectionately by many British radio listeners as it is considered a soothing accompaniment to bedtime. The lead singer of the Britpop band Pulp, Jarvis Cocker, chose \"Sailing By\" as one of his \"Desert Island Discs\", saying for many years he had used it \"as an aid to restful sleep\".\n\nThe BBC issued it as a single in 1973 on its own BBC Records label, played by the John Fox Orchestra.\n\nThe piece appeared on a single recorded by the Royal Ballet Sinfonia in a quest to save the \"Radio 4 UK Theme\". In 1993 there was a similar reaction by BBC listeners when \"Sailing By\" was temporarily taken off the air on weekday schedules, leading to it being re-instated in 1995.\n\nThe recording used by the BBC (performed by the Alan Perry/William Gardner Orchestra) was originally only available as library music, but has since 1997 been available commercially as track 11 on the second disc of the EMI CD set titled \"The Great British Experience\" (EMI Classics CDGB50). It is also available as track 8 on the CD \"Elizabethan Serenade: The Best of British Light Music,\" produced by Naxos and performed by the Slovak Radio Symphony Orchestra. The unexplained crediting of the BBC recording to the \"Perry Gardner Orchestra\", suggesting the existence of a conductor or arranger by that name, is apt to be confusing; indeed, \"Alan Perry\" and \"William Gardner\" are in fact pseudonyms for composers Ernest Tomlinson and Peter Hope. The BBC broadcast the original stereo version for a few weeks in the late 1980s, but soon reverted to a mono version.\n\n"}

The players rearrange the maze to their advantage by moving a row of pieces in turn. Each player has one token, which they move in the maze. The player's goal is to collect treasures in the labyrinth and then return to their own starting position. The treasures appear in the cards that are dealt to the players in the beginning of the game.\n\nThe player is allowed to see only the card that shows their current destination. The player has to reveal the card when they reach the destination, and take a new card from their pile. The other players notice when the pile is empty, and then usually try to prevent the leading player from returning to the starting position. Advanced players also try to guess other players' destinations in order to make their proceeding more difficult or try to trap them in dead ends.\n\nThe game was designed by the German psychologist Max Kobbert and published by Ravensburger under the name \"\"Das verrückte Labyrinth\"\", which is a pun on the German words \"\"verrücken\"\" (displace) and \"\"verrückt\"\" (crazy), roughly translatable in English as \"\"labyrinthal disorder\"\". In English-speaking countries, the name was initially translated as \"\"THE aMAZEing LABYRINTH\"\", but the pun was dropped in subsequent versions.\n\nRavensburger has published a number of follow-on labyrinth games, starting with an advanced version of the game, \"Master Labyrinth\", created by Kobbert in 1991. This version of the game won the 1991 Mensa Select award, the 1991 Deutscher Spiele Preis, and the Spiel des Jahres special award for \"most beautiful game\". It was followed by \"Junior Labyrinth\" (1995), a simplified version on a smaller board with fewer items to find; \"Secret Labyrinth\" (1998), a version on a circular board with simplified combat; the \"Labyrinth Card Game\" (2000); \"3-D Labyrinth\" (2002), a version with a plastic 3D board; \"Lord of the Rings Labyrinth\", a book/movie themed version; \"Labyrinth Treasure Hunt \"(2005), a version which features simultaneous play; and a dragon-themed version again called \"Master Labyrinth \"(2007)\".\"\n\nIn February 2008, videogame website DS-x2.com reported that dtp entertainment was planning a Nintendo DS version of the board game. Three months later, they included screen shots of the game, but ultimately it was never released.\n\nIn 2009-2010, the RIT CS department adopted the game for a freshman-level CS project in the Python programming language.\n\nIn July 2010, LEGO game Harry Potter Hogwarts (number 3862) was released that follows a similar game mechanic. Each player must collect one copy of each of four items and return to their start position.

The APFA changed its name in 1922 to the National Football League, which it has retained ever since. From 1921 to 1931, the APFA/NFL determined its champion by overall win–loss record, with no playoff games; ties were not counted in the winning percentage total. The APFA did not keep records of the 1920 season; they declared the Akron Pros, who finished the season with an 8–0–3 (8 wins, 0 losses, 3 ties) record, as the league's first champions by a vote of the owners.

Austin\n\nDavid Charles Henshaw Austin (16 February 1926 at Albrighton – 18 December 2018 in the same village) was a British rose breeder and writer who lived in Shropshire, England. His emphasis was on breeding roses with the character and fragrance of old garden roses (such as gallicas, damasks and alba roses) but with the repeat-flowering ability and wide colour range of modern roses such as hybrid teas and floribundas.\n\nAustin's first commercially available rose, Rosa 'Constance Spry', was introduced in 1961. In 1967 and 1968 he introduced 'Chianti' and 'Shropshire Lass' respectively. Although these first roses bloomed only once in spring or early summer, they led, in 1969, to a series of remontant (repeat-flowering) varieties, including 'Wife of Bath' and 'Canterbury' (both in honour of the English author Geoffrey Chaucer). Austin's roses soon became the most successful group of new roses in the twentieth century.\n\nThough Austin's roses are not officially recognised as a separate class of roses by, for instance, the Royal National Rose Society or the American Rose Society, they are nonetheless commonly referred to by rosarians, at nurseries, and in horticultural literature as 'English Roses' (the term he uses) or 'Austin Roses'.\n\nSince its founding in 1969, he and his firm David Austin Roses in Albrighton, near Wolverhampton, introduced over 190 rose cultivars during his lifetime. Cultivars have been named in honour of his family, well-known rosarians, geographical landmarks in Britain, historical events, and British writers, particularly Shakespeare and Chaucer, and their works or characters. For instance, roses have honoured such diverse entities as the rosarian and artist Graham Thomas and King Henry VIII's flagship, the Mary Rose.\n\nIn the twenty-first century, Austin separated his roses into four groups as a guide to further developments. The four groups are:\n\nIn 2003, David Austin was awarded the Victoria Medal of Honour by the Royal Horticultural Society for his services to horticulture and the Dean Hole Medal from the Royal National Rose Society.

{"id": "2265764", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2265764", "title": "Korean Wave", "text": "Korean Wave\n\nThe Korean Wave (, , a neologism, literally meaning \"wave/flow of Korea\") is the increase in global popularity of South Korean culture since the 1990s. First driven by the spread of K-dramas and K-pop across East, South, and Southeast Asia during its initial stages, the Korean Wave evolved from a regional development into a global phenomenon, carried by the Internet and social media and the proliferation of K-pop music videos on YouTube. While some sources attribute the term \"Hallyu,\" a variation of a Japanese expression using \"Ryu\" (流) as a postfix to refer ‘～way’, ‘~style’, ‘～group’, to being first used by the Ministry of Culture and Tourism in South Korea in 1999, when the ministry produced a music CD titled in Chinese \"韓流—Song from Korea;\" other scholarly sources attribute the term's ascendance from Korean television dramas first airing on Chinese television in 1997, naming the phenomenon \"hanliu\" (), meaning \"Korean wave\". The term was adopted by Chinese media to refer to the success of South Korean popular culture in China. The term was reintroduced in Japan as \"hanryu\" or \"kanryu\" by the \"Asahi Shimbun\" in 2001.\n\nSince the turn of the 21st century, South Korea has emerged as a major exporter of popular culture and tourism, aspects which have become a significant part of its burgeoning economy. The growing popularity of Korean pop culture in the world was at least partly driven by the South Korean government supporting its creative industries through subsidies and funding for start-ups, as a form of soft power with the goal of becoming a leading global exporter of culture along in line with Japanese and British culture, a niche that the United States has dominated for nearly a century. In 2014, the South Korean government allocated 1% of its annual budget to cultural industries and raised a $1 billion fund to nurture popular culture. During this time, Korean society began to be recognized as developed on par with the Western world.\n\nThe success of the Korean Wave is, in part, due to the development of social networking services and online video sharing platforms, which have allowed the Korean entertainment industry to reach a sizable overseas audience. Through the use of social media in facilitating promotion, distribution, and consumption of various forms of Korean entertainment—specifically K-Pop—that has contributed to the surge in worldwide popularity since the mid-2000s.\n\nThe Korean Wave has become an influential global phenomenon since the start of the 21st century, heavily impacting the contemporary cultures, music industry, film industry, television industry, and behavioral aspects of various people throughout the world.\n\nThe Korean term for the phenomenon of the Korean Wave is \"Hanryu\" (Hangul: 한류), more commonly romanized as \"Hallyu\". The term is made of two root words: \"han\" (한/韓) meaning \"Korean\", and \"ryu\" (류/流) meaning \"flow\" or \"wave\", and referring to the diffusion of Korean culture.\n\nThis term is sometimes applied differently outside of Korea; for example, overseas, \"Hallyu\" drama refers to Korean drama in general, but in Korea, \"Hallyu\" drama and Korean drama are taken to mean slightly different things. According to researcher Jeongmee Kim, the term \"Hallyu\" refers only to dramas that have gained success overseas, or feature actors that are internationally recognised.\n\nThe Korean Wave encompasses the global awareness of different aspects of South Korean culture including film and television (particularly \"K-dramas\"), K-pop, manhwa, the Korean language, and Korean cuisine. Some commentators also consider traditional Korean culture in its entirety to be part of the Korean Wave. American political scientist Joseph Nye defines the Korean Wave as \"the growing popularity of all things Korean, from fashion and film to music and cuisine.\"\n\nAn early mention of Korean culture as a form of soft power can be found in the writings of Kim Gu, leader of the Korean independence movement and president of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea. Towards the end of his autobiography, he wrote the following: \n\nAbout 20 years after the Korean War (1950–53) and the 1953 Korean Armistice Agreement, South Korea's economy began to fully recover from the war and experienced a period of rapid economic growth known as the Miracle on the Han River.\n\nIn the film industry, screen quotas were introduced in South Korea during Park Chung-hee's presidency, restricting the number of foreign films shown in cinemas. These were intended to prevent competition between domestic films and foreign blockbuster movies. However, in 1986, the Motion Pictures Exporters Association of America filed a complaint to the United States Senate regarding the regulations imposed by the South Korean government, which was compelled to lift the restrictions. In 1988, Twentieth Century Fox became the first American film studio to set up a distribution office in South Korea, followed by Warner Brothers (1989), Columbia (1990), and Walt Disney (1993).\n\nBy 1994, Hollywood's share of the South Korean movie market had reached a peak of around 80 percent, and the local film industry's share fell to a low of 15.9 percent. That year, president Kim Young-sam was advised to provide support and subsidies to Korean media production, as part of the country's export strategy. According to South Korean media, the former President was urged to take note of how total revenues generated by Hollywood's \"Jurassic Park\" had surpassed the sale of 1.5 million Hyundai automobiles; with the latter a source of national pride, this comparison reportedly influenced the government's shift of focus towards culture as an exportable industry. At this time, the South Korean Ministry of Culture set up a cultural industry bureau to develop its media sector, and many investors were encouraged to expand into film and media. Thus, by the end of 1995 the foundation was laid for the rise of Korean culture.\n\nIn July 1997, the Asian financial crisis led to heavy losses in the manufacturing sector, prompting a handful of businesses to turn to the entertainment sector.\n\nAccording to \"The New York Times\", South Korea began to lift restrictions on cultural imports from its former colonial ruler Japan in 1998. With an aim of tackling an impending \"onslaught\" of Japanese movies, anime, manga, and J-pop, the South Korean Ministry of Culture made a request for a substantial budget increase, which allowed the creation of 300 cultural industry departments in colleges and universities nationwide.\n\nIn February 1999, the first local big-budget film, \"Shiri,\" was released and became a major commercial success. It grossed over US$11 million, surpassing the Hollywood blockbuster \"Titanic\".\n\nAround this time, several Korean television dramas were broadcast in China. On November 19, 1999, one of China's state-controlled daily newspapers, the \"Beijing Youth Daily\", published an article acknowledging the \"zeal of Chinese audiences for Korean TV dramas and pop songs\". In February 2000, S.M. Entertainment's boy-band H.O.T. became the first modern K-pop artist to give an overseas performance, with a sold-out concert in Beijing. As the volume of Korean cultural imports rapidly increased, China's State Administration of Radio, Film, and Television responded with a decision to restrict and limit the number of Korean TV dramas shown to Chinese audiences.\n\n\"My Sassy Girl\" (2001) was a major international breakthrough for Korean films. It became a box office hit across East Asia, and its DVD release also drew a large cult following across Southeast Asia and parts of South Asia. It also spawned a number of international remakes, including a Hollywood remake and several Asian film remakes, as well as television adaptations and a sequel.\n\nHowever, several other countries in Asia were also experiencing a growth in the popularity of Korean dramas and pop songs. In 2000 in the Indian state of Manipur, where Bollywood movies were banned by separatists, consumers gradually turned their attention to Korean entertainment. According to Agence France-Presse, Korean phrases were commonly heard in the schoolyards and street markets of Manipur. Many Korean dramas and films were smuggled into Manipur from neighbouring Burma, in the form of CDs and DVDs. Popularity in Korean products subsequently spread to other parts of Northeast India including Assam, Meghalaya, Sikkim, Arunachal Pradesh, Tripura, Mizoram, and Nagaland.\n\nIn 2002, following the reversal of a decades-long embargo on media between the two countries, BoA's album \"Listen to My Heart\" became the first album by a Korean musician to sell a million copies in Japan. Following this success, other K-pop artists also ventured into the Japanese music industry as well.\n\nAt the same time that \"Hallyu\" was experiencing early success, there was an equally noticeable growth in cultural imports from Taiwan, also one of the Four Asian Tigers. The 2001 Taiwanese drama \"Meteor Garden\" (an adaptation of the Japanese shōjo manga series \"Boys Over Flowers\") was popular over the continent; it became the most-watched drama series in Philippine television history, garnered over 10 million daily viewers in Manila alone, and catapulted the male protagonists from Taiwanese boyband F4 to overnight fame, spawning a sequel and later adaptations by other networks (including Korean channel KBS in 2009.)\n\nOn June 8, 2001, Shinhwa's fourth album \"Hey, Come On!\" was released to success over Asia. The group became particularly popular in China and Taiwan.\n\nIn 2002, \"Winter Sonata\" (produced by Korean channel KBS2) became the first drama to equal the success of \"Meteor Garden\", attracting a cult following in Asia. Sales of merchandise, including DVD sets and novels, surpassed US$3.5 million in Japan. This drama marked the initial entrance of the Korean Wave in Japan. In 2004, former Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi noted that the male protagonist of the drama was \"more popular than I am in Japan\". Other Korean dramas released in subsequent years such as \"Dae Jang Geum\" (2003) and \"Full House\" (2004) saw comparable levels of success.\n\nSince 2002, television programming trends in Asia began to undergo changes as series from both South Korea and Taiwan began to fill prime time slots previously reserved for Hollywood movies.\n\nThe breakthrough for K-pop came with the debuts of TVXQ (2003), SS501 (2005), Super Junior (2005), the early success of BIGBANG (2007–present), and other artists hailed by a BBC reporter as \"household names in much of Asia.\" In 2003, South Korean girl group Baby V.O.X. released a Chinese single entitled \"I'm Still Loving You\" and topped various music charts in China, making a huge fanbase there. Both \"I'm Still Loving You\" and their subsequent Korean single \"What Should I Do\" also charted in Thailand.\n\nMeanwhile, the popularity of Korean television continued to spread across the continent. Reports about Asian women travelling to South Korea to find love inspired by Korean romance dramas began to appear in the media, including in the Washington Post.\n\nIn Nepal, Bhutan, and Sri Lanka, Korean dramas began to increasingly take up airtime on TV channels in these countries with \"Winter Sonata\" and \"Full House\" credited to igniting the interest in Korean pop culture in these countries. Korean fashion and hairstyles became trendy amongst youth in Nepal and led to a Korean language course boom in the country which has persisted to today. Korean cuisine experienced a surge of popularity in Nepal with more Korean eateries opening in the country throughout the early to mid 2000s. Similarly, Korean cuisine also became popular in Sri Lanka and Bhutan with Korean restaurants opening to satisfy the demand in these countries.\n\nBy the late 2000s, many Taiwanese musicians had been superseded by their K-pop counterparts, and although a small number of groups such as F4 and Fahrenheit continued to maintain fan bases in Asia.\n\nIn the United States, Korean culture has spread outwards from Korean American communities, most notably those in Los Angeles and New York City. The overall reception of Korean culture in the United States is rather lukewarm compared to that in Asia; Mnet Media said that its employees' attempt to pitch over 300 K-pop music videos to American producers and record labels was unsuccessful, there being \"relationships so they would be courteous, but it was not a serious conversation.\" Attempted US debuts by artists such as BoA and Se7en failed to gain traction, being labelled by a CNN reporter as \"complete flops.\"\n\nThat said, Korean culture products (series such as \"Jumong\" being particularly well received by audiences in the Muslim world) have seen increasing popularity, with a dedicated and growing global fanbase, particularly after Psy's video for \"Gangnam Style\" went viral in 2012–13 and was the first YouTube video to reach over a billion views. YouTube has been a vital platform in the increasing international popularity of K-pop, overriding the reluctance of radio DJs to air foreign-language songs in reaching a global audience. KCON, originally a one-day event dedicated to K-Pop in Irvine, California in 2012, has now expanded into eight different countries spanning over multiple days and locations.\n\nThe Korean Wave has developed into the foreign diplomacy of South Korea, used as a means to promote Korean culture to foreign countries. South Korea's Former President Park Geun-hye intended to allocate at least 2 percent of the national budget to further develop South Korea's cultural industry and to seek more cultural exchanges with North Korea. Cuisine and cosmetic products are two of the most recognizable features of South Korean culture overseas. Among the largest beauty companies in the Asia-Pacific region are Amorepacific and LG Household & Health Care. The cultural boom has also propelled tourism growth, South Korea welcoming over 12 million visitors in 2013, with 6 million tourists from China alone. However, a poll conducted in nine countries (China, Japan, Taiwan, Thailand, the US, Brazil, France, the UK, Russia) in 2013 reported that 66% of the respondents concerned that the temporary boom would \"subside in the next four years\".\n\nKorean skincare products have gained widespread popularity in Asia. Amorepacific and LG Household & Health Care have become the top two beauty companies in the Asia-Pacific region. China has become the largest market for Korean cosmetics and account for 25% of China's cosmetic imports. In Sri Lanka, European beauty products have largely been replaced in favour of Korean cosmetic and skincare products which have become popular because of their cheaper prices and their suitability for Asian skin. Similarly, Korean products have become popular in Singapore because they meet the concerns of Asians and that they have been designed for Asian people. The popularity of Kpop in Cambodia has also led to the influx of Korean beauty products into the Cambodian market. Korean cosmetic and skincare products have also become popular in Thailand, Malaysia, and Japan among other countries. Recent political issues between South Korea and China have led Amorepacific to look elsewhere and revamp its products in order to specifically target Muslim and darker-skinned women in Southeast Asia. In 2017, Innisfree released a range of darker-toned cushions in order to match skin tones of Southeast Asian women.\n\nHallyu 2.0 is the \"New Korean wave\" that began around 2007 as a result of South Korea taking advantage of 21st century digital technologies and social media. The term \"Hallyu 2.0\" was first used in August 2010 by Japanese media after Girl's Generation's successful showcase at Ariake Coliseum in Tokyo. The concept of Hallyu 2.0 rose in tandem with Web 2.0, which emphasizes user generated content and usability. Hallyu 2.0 is larger in scope than the first Korean wave, and is also differentiated by the increased role and popularity of Korean pop music and other Korean exports like video games and animation. This in contrast to the importance of the Korean television drama during the first wave that was more geographically focused in East Asia. However, at the center of Hallyu 2.0 are the social networking sites (SNS) and user-generated content (UGC) sites such as YouTube that enable fans across the world to interact with South Korean pop culture. Overall, Hallyu 2.0 refers to different means (technology) to reach far beyond the Korean Peninsula and the continent of Asia.\n\nThe success of South Korean cultural products throughout the beginning of the 21st century has led some governments in Asia passing measures to protect their own cultural industries. Japan, China, and Taiwan made specific efforts to stem the flow of Korean films and dramas into their countries, which caused those films and dramas to suffer in sales. This necessitated Korea's finding new markets in which to export their cultural products. K-pop and Korean idols have been a core part of Hallyu 2.0 finding these new markets.\n\nMuch Korean investment in arts and culture prior to 1993 focused on traditional forms of Korean culture that were essential to hold on to given the turbulence of the 20th century in Korean history. After 1993, cultural commercialization became government policy as leaders saw the necessity of integrating culture and economy. In 1999, the \"Basic Law for Promoting Cultural Industries\" was passed by the Korean government, establishing government support for \"coproduction with foreign countries, marketing and advertising of Korean pop culture through broadcasting and the Internet, and the dissemination of domestic cultural products to foreign markets\". Establishing their clear and public support for cultural industries, however, caused antagonism in other Asian countries, which were, at the time, the primary market for Korea's cultural exports. Therefore, indirect support had to be practiced. In 2008, the budget for the cultural industries sector increased, and the government introduced the \"creative content industry\", emphasizing K-pop and video games as important foreign exports.\n\nSun Lee, the head of music partnerships for Korea at YouTube, said, \"It might have been impossible for K-pop to have worldwide popularity without YouTube's global platform\" Since 2012, views of the top 200 K-pop artists on YouTube have tripled. In 2016, 80% of the 24 \"billion\" views of videos by the top 200 K-pop artists came from outside of South Korea. YouTube is essential to Hallyu 2.0, as it allows labels to deliver music videos and other K-pop related content to audiences abroad without going through television or other traditional media outlets.\n\nK-pop's relationship with YouTube began in 2009, when the \"big three\" record labels (SM, YG Entertainment, and JYP Entertainment) partnered with the user-generated content site, after several failed attempts to break the American market between 2006 and 2008. This partnership proved itself effective in 2011, when YouTube metrics showed that the United States accounted for the heaviest concentration of K-pop views outside of Asia.\n\nYouTube has enabled fans to connect with K-pop through their own content, such as dance covers and reaction videos/channels. Such channels include JREKML, a channel that has amassed over 1 million subscribers and consists mainly of K-pop reactions, skits, and vlogs. The creation of remakes helped \"Gangnam Style\" rise to world popularity. YouTube, and other social media platforms were instrumental as it allowed remakes to be created that adapted to the locality. This worked because it allowed the consumer to also become the producer, unlike before where adaptations to the local or regional culture would cost the original producer money.\n\nState-funded trade promotion organisations KOTRA and KOFICE publish together an annual index measuring the global reach of the Korean Wave in specific countries. The index is calculated by a combination of export data and public surveys. In 2017, public surveys were conducted across 16 countries. The results shown below indicate that the period of high growth of the Korean wave has faded, with its popularity currently hovering in the middle. However, in all countries surveyed, except Japan, the Korean wave is growing.\n\nAccording to a 2011 survey conducted by the South Korean Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism, the total number of active members of \"Hallyu\" fan clubs worldwide was estimated at 3.3 million, based on statistics published by official fan clubs in regions where there are Korean Cultural Centers. In the same year, the Korea Tourism Organization surveyed 12,085 fans of \"Hallyu\" and concluded that most fans were young adults, over 90% were female, and most were fans of K-pop. According to the Korea Foundation, in 2018 there were about 89 million fans of 'hallyu' around the world, and 1,843 fan clubs. The number of fans grew by 22% from the year before, which is largely attributed to the growing popularity of boy band BTS.\n\nSouth Korea's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) has been responsible for international advocacy of Korean culture. The South Korean government is involved in the organisation of concerts such as the annual K-Pop World Festival.\n\nIn the past decade or so, many Chinese officials have expressed positivity towards Korean media and entertainment, including former President Hu Jintao and former Premier Wen Jiabao, who was quoted by Xinhua News Agency as saying: \"Regarding the \"Hallyu\" phenomenon, the Chinese people, especially the youth, are particularly attracted to it and the Chinese government considers the \"Hallyu\" phenomenon to be a vital contribution towards mutual cultural exchanges flowing between China and South Korea.\" The Massachusetts Institute of Technology released a report that states that China is South Korea's biggest export at $121 billion a year. Tourism between the two countries has increased as a result of the Korean Wave, with South Korea receiving a 27% increase of tourists from China (3.8 million people) in 2016.\n\nThe \"Hallyu fever\" that once was connected to just entertainment is also starting to extend to a broader fetishism of Korean lifestyles. Culinary styles have been connected as well as the cultural exchanges are now able to encourage a broader exchange of lifestyles in China. South Korean cosmetics have also benefited from the Chinese market, such as in the case of the Amorepacific Corporation, which received a 44% boost in sales.\n\nA four-member research study led by Kang Myung-koo of Seoul National University published a controversial report in 2013 suggesting that Chinese viewers of Korean dramas were generally within the lower end of the education and income spectrum. This led to an angry response from Chinese fans of Korean television, with one group purchasing a full-page advertisement in the Chosun Ilbo to request an apology from the authors of the study.\n\nSince 2016, China virtually banned Korean Wave because South Korea agreed to establish Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) with the US. Chinese government regarded THAAD in South Korea as a potential risk to Chinese national security. In order to defend its national security and achieve political purposes, Chinese government restricted the spread of Korean Wave and prevented South Korea from generating economic benefits from K-Wave. On August 4, 2016, the fan meeting of a popular Korean drama, \"Uncontrollably Fond,\" including the leading actor and actress, Kim Woobin and Bae Suzy, was cancelled without any notified reasons in Beijing. In March 2017, Beijing issued a suspension of group tours to South Korea for Chinese travel agencies. Many Korean entertainers and music bands, such as Lee Kwang Soo, BTS, EXO, and Girls Generation, faced difficulty performing in China. On December 7, 2017, Yonhap reported that EXO Planet #3 concert which scheduled at Nanjing Olympic Sports Centre Stadium on December 17 has been abruptly cancelled by Chinese agency. Despite of performances, Chinese people have a limited access to Korean music and drama on Chinese online sharing platforms. Korean media such as television shows and K-pop music videos were blocked from streaming in China. This ban resulted in significant financial losses for the Korean entertainment industry with SM Entertainment down 18% since July 2016, a total of $150 million loss in market value. YG Entertainment was down 32%, representing a $230 million loss. Many Chinese-Korean television shows were put on hold as a result of THAAD.\n\nIn November 2016, Chung Sye-kyun, then-Speaker of the Korean National Assembly was still positive about the spread of Korean Wave in China by announcing at the China Forum,\"China has been and is the largest stage for hallyu, from the beginning of its popularity. The meaning of hallyu is to grow, even though the relationship between two countries has wavered due to THAAD.\" In late 2017, the ban of Korean Wave appeared to be ending. Many large Chinese online video platforms, including iQiyi and Youku, restarted import of Korean dramas. Chinese travel agencies also restarted group tours to South Korea. Dr. Pang Zhongying, an international and global affairs professor at the Ocean University of China said, \"I think that relations are improving since President Moon’s visit to China, and travel is one example of that.\"\n\nIn 2017, China started to lift their ban on the Korean Wave with bands such as Mamamoo making appearances on Chinese TV shows after the South Korean and Chinese governments announced an agreement regarding the THAAD dispute.\n\nThe \"hanryu\" or \"kanryu\" wave in Japan is marked by the popularity of Korean TV series \"Winter Sonata\" in 2003 but likely emerged earlier with travel trends, food culture, the beauty industry, and World Cup soccer. Korean actor Bae Yong-Joon, also known in Japan as \"Yon-sama\", was the early face of the wave, generating an economic burst as Japanese rushed out to buy the DVD of \"Winter Sonata\", along with DVD players and related accessories. Early reporting of the popularity of Yon-sama included derogatory remarks about his female fan base in Japan, labeling them as sex-deprived \"hags.\" However, the buying power of the Yon-sama fan base could not be ignored. \"Winter Sonata\"-themed beverages, foods, accessories, beauty products, and more sold out in Japan. Other Korean TV series soon followed, such as \"Jewel in the Palace.\" The Japanese fan base easily recognized and connected historical Chinese elements present in the shows, such as calligraphy, and imperial court intrigues. Japanese women also connected to the comforting, communicative character played by Yon-sama. Since the arrival of the Korean wave, Korean cuisine and products have increased in Japan. Shin-Okubo Station in Tokyo, known for its Korean neighborhood, has since become featured in Japanese tourist brochures.\n\nAs a result of the Korean wave, some hoped political tensions between Japan and South Korean may improve. Some effort has been taken to avoid tense associations, resulting in the adoption of the term \"koria\" from English \"Korea\" rather than using the politically-charged term for Korea, \"kankoku\". However, the overall effect has been limited.\n\nThe Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs acknowledges that the Korean Wave in Japan has led to discussion and mutual cultural exchange between the two countries, with high-profile fans of Korean television including former First Lady Miyuki Hatoyama and current First Lady Akie Abe. However, remaining tension between Japan and Korea has led to instances of street protests involving hundreds of people, demonstrating against the popularity of Korean entertainment exports. These protests were mostly organized by critics of Korean pop culture with the support of right-wing nationalists.\n\nStill, the Japanese Cabinet Office survey in 2004 found that favorable feelings towards South Korea rose to 56.7% a three-year record high in Japan.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Korean TV dramas first entered Taiwanese market but they didn't gain wide popularity. Local broadcasting channel GTV began to broadcast Korean television dramas in the late 1990s. The shows were dubbed into Mandarin and were not marketed as foreign, which may have helped them to become widely popular during this time. Since 2000, Korean pop culture was so popular that it even replaced the positions of long-lasting, favourable Japanese TV operas and Hong Kong pop music in Taiwan. It was a reverse in the Taiwanese entertainment market because Japan and Hong Kong maintained stable relationships with Taiwan for exchanging culture for hundreds of years, whereas South Korea was regarded negatively by Taiwanese, especially after South Korea readjusted the relationship with Taiwan and established a new relationship with mainland China since 1992. The boom of Korean Wave changed Taiwanese perspectives on South Korea and promoted the relationship between Taiwan and South Korea. Taiwanese TV stations gradually imported Korean TV series, such as \"DaeJang Geum,\" one of the most famous series. The production of Taiwanese TV dramas has been influenced by Korean dramas. Besides Korean dramas, Korean pop music has also gained public attention in Taiwan. In July, 2018, Taiwan News reported that Korean pop music was getting even more popular in Taiwan by holding seven K-Pop concerts within two months in Taipei, including live concerts by Zion.T, and Wanna One.\n\nSince the mid-2000s, Israel, Iran, Morocco and Egypt have become major consumers of Korean culture. Following the success of Korean dramas in the Middle East & North Africa, the Korean Overseas Information Service made \"Winter Sonata\" available with Arabic subtitles on several state-run Egyptian television networks. According to Youna Kim (2007), \"The broadcast was part of the government’s efforts to improve the image of South Korea in the Middle East, where there is little understanding and exposure towards Korean culture\" (p. 31). The \"New York Times\" reported that the intent behind this was to contribute towards positive relations between Arab & Berber audiences and South Korean soldiers stationed in northern Iraq.\n\nMBC4 (Middle East Broadcasting Channel) played a major role in increasing the Korean wave's popularity in the MENA region (Middle East and North Africa). This broadcasting channel hosted a series of Korean drama starting 2013 such as \"Boys Over Flowers\" (أيام الزهور), \"You're Beautiful\" (أنت جميلة), \"Dream High\" (حلم الشباب ), \"Coffee Prince\" ( مقهى الأمير). Some Arab countries opposed Korean shows (dramas and reality TV shows) because of the fear they would lead to Islam youth to abandon their traditions wholesale in order to adopt Western modernity wholesale. However, this did not stop the Korean industries from exporting more Korean Dramas to the Arab world in the following years such as \"The Heirs\" ( الورثة).\n\nThe popularity of Korean dramas in the MENA region-and its continuous growth- originates from the content of these dramas. As the majority of the plots of Korean dramas focus on social issues (love between different social classes or family problems for instance), the Arab audiences fit themselves and could relate to the Korean socio-cultural values as they seem appealing to them. So Korean dramas play the role of an equilibrium point where two, somehow, different cultures could create a new cultural space where these two different cultures could meet.\n\nIn 2006, the Korean drama \"My Lovely Sam Soon\" was aired on Israeli cable channel Viva. Despite a lukewarm response, there followed a surge in interest in Korean television shows, and a further thirty Korean dramas were broadcast on the same channel.\n\nIn 2008, a Korean language course was launched at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, offering lectures on Korean history, politics, and culture.\n\nIt is hoped by some commentators that the surging popularity of Korean culture across Israel and Palestine may serve as a bridge over the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. The Hebrew University of Jerusalem reported that some Israeli and Palestinian K-pop fans see themselves as \"cultural missionaries\" and actively introduce K-pop to their friends and relatives, further spreading the Korean Wave within their communities.\n\n\"Autumn in My Heart\", one of the earliest Korean dramas brought over to the Middle East, was made available for viewing after five months of \"persistent negotiations\" between the South Korean embassy and an Egyptian state-run broadcasting company. Shortly after the series ended, the embassy reported that it had received over 400 phone calls and love letters from fans from all over the country. According to the secretary of the South Korean embassy in Cairo Lee Ki-seok, Korea's involvement in the Iraq War had significantly undermined its reputation among Egyptians, but the screening of \"Autumn in My Heart\" proved \"extremely effective\" in reversing negative attitudes.\n\nIran's state broadcaster, Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB), aired several Korean dramas during prime time slots in recent years, with this decision attributed by some to their Confucian values of respect for others, which are \"closely aligned to Islamic culture\", while in contrast, Western productions often fail to satisfy the criteria set by Iran's Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance. In October 2012, the \"Tehran Times\" reported that IRIB representatives visited South Korea to visit filming locations in an effort to strengthen \"cultural affinities\" between the two countries and to seek avenues for further cooperation between KBS and IRIB.\n\nAccording to Reuters, until recently audiences in Iran have had little choice in broadcast material and thus programs that are aired by IRIB often attain higher viewership ratings in Iran than in South Korea; for example, the most popular episodes of \"Jumong\" attracted over 90% of Iranian audience (compared to 40% in South Korea), propelling its lead actor Song Il-gook to superstar status in Iran.\n\nResearchers from both countries have recently studied the cultural exchanges between Silla (one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea) and the Persian Empire. The Korea Times reported that the two cultures may have been similar 1,200 years ago.\n\nIn the early 2000s, Korean dramas were aired for South Korean troops stationed in northern Iraq as part of coalition forces led by the United States during the Iraq War. With the end of the war and the subsequent withdrawal of South Korean military personnel from the country, efforts were made to expand availability of K-dramas to the ordinary citizens of Iraq.\n\nIn 2012, the Korean drama \"Hur Jun\" reportedly attained a viewership of over 90% in the Kurdistan region of Iraq. Its lead actor Jun Kwang-ryul was invited by the federal government of Iraq to visit the city of Sulaymaniyah in Kurdistan, at the special request of the country's First Lady, Hero Ibrahim Ahmed.\n\nIn February 2012, JYJ member Jaejoong was invited by the South Korean Embassy in Ankara to hold an autograph session at Ankara University. Before departing for concerts in South America, Jaejoong also attended a state dinner with the presidents of South Korea (Lee Myung-bak) and Turkey (Abdullah Gül).\n\nIn December 2013, Morocco's Marrakech International Film Festival, the largest film event in the Middle East and Africa, opened with Korean percussion music samulnori performance and screened more than 40 Korean movies, including \"Painted Fire\" (취화선) by director Im Kwon-Taek. The same festival's top prize, the Golden Star, went to the Korean movie Hang Gong-Ju by Lee Su-Jin.\n\nOn August 31, 2014, the \"Moroccan fans of Korea\" association invited the Korean-American K-pop singer Eric Nam to Rabat, Morocco to take part in the finals for the regional competition for KBS's K-pop world festival, where participants competed in dancing and singing.\n\nIn March 2012, former Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard visited South Korea's Yonsei University, where she acknowledged that her country has \"caught\" the Korean Wave that is \"reaching all the way to our shores.\"\n\nIn November 2012, New Zealand's Deputy Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Andrea Smith, delivered a key note address to South Korean diplomats at the University of Auckland, where she asserted that the Korean Wave is becoming \"part of the Kiwi lifestyle\" and added that \"there is now a 4,000 strong association of K-pop followers in New Zealand.\"\n\nThe first Korean drama in Romania was aired on TVR in August 2009, and in the following month it became the third most popular television program in the country. Since then, Korean dramas have seen high ratings and further success.\n\nThe French Foreign Ministry acknowledges the status of \"Hallyu\" as a global phenomenon that is characterized by the \"growing worldwide success of Korean popular culture\".\n\nThe German Foreign Office has confirmed that \"Korean entertainment (\"Hallyu\", telenovelas, K-pop bands, etc.) is currently enjoying great popularity and success in Asia and beyond.\"\n\nIn November 2012, the British Minister of State for the Foreign Office, Hugo Swire, held a meeting with South Korean diplomats at the House of Lords, where he affirmed that Korean music had gone \"global\".\n\nDuring a bilateral meeting with South Korean President Park Geun-hye at the White House in May 2013, U.S. President Barack Obama cited \"Gangnam Style\" as an example of how people around the world are being \"swept up by Korean culture – the Korean Wave.\" In August 2013, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry also affirmed that the Korean Wave \"spreads Korean culture to countries near and far.\"\n\nOn October 30, 2012, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon delivered a speech in front of the National Assembly of South Korea where he noted how Korean culture and the \"Hallyu\"-wave is \"making its mark on the world\".\n\nThe Korean Wave has spread the influence of aspects of Korean culture including fashion, music, television programs and formats, cosmetics, games, cuisine, manhwa and beauty standards.\n\nIn China, many broadcasters have taken influences from Korean entertainment programs such as \"Running Man\"; in 2014 SBS announced the Chinese version of this program, \"Hurry Up, Brother\", which was a major hit as an example of a unique category of programs known as 'urban action varieties'.\n\nKorean media has also been influential throughout Asia in terms of beauty standards. In Taiwan, where the drama \"Dae Jang Geum\" was extremely popular, some fans reportedly underwent cosmetic surgery to look similar to lead actress Lee Young-ae.\n\nIn 2012, a poll conducted by the BBC revealed that public opinion of South Korea had been improving every year since data began to be collected in 2009. In countries such as Russia, India, China and France, public opinion of South Korea turned from \"slightly negative\" to \"generally positive\". This increase in 'soft power' corresponded with a surge in exports of US$4.3 billion in 2011.\n\nKorean producers have capitalised on high demand in Asia due to the popularity of Korean media, which enabled KBS to sell its 2006 drama \"Spring Waltz\" to eight Asian countries during its pre-production stage in 2004.\n\nThe following data is based on government statistics:\nThe following data is from the Korea Creative Contents Agency (part of the Korean Ministry of Culture, Sports, and Tourism) for the first quarter of the 2012 fiscal year:\nIn North Korea, the term associated with the Korean wave is 남조선 바람 namjoseon baram (literally \"South Korean wind\"). The ninth President of South Korea, Roh Moo-hyun, acknowledged the possible use of \"Hallyu\" as a tool to help to reunify the Korean Peninsula. In May 2007 the television series \"Hwang Jini\", adapted from a novel by a North Korean author, became the first South Korean production to be made available for public viewing in North Korea.\n\nWith the end of the Roh Moo-hyun administration's Sunshine Policy towards North Korea and a deterioration of North-South relations, however, \"Hallyu\" media was quickly restrained by North Korean authorities, although a report published by Radio Free Asia (a non-profit radio network funded by the U.S. federal government) suggested that the Korean Wave \"may already have taken a strong hold in the isolated Stalinist state\".\n\nIn 2010, researchers from the Korea Institute for National Unification surveyed 33 North Korean defectors and found that the impact of shows such as \"Winter Sonata\" had played a significant role in shaping the decision of the defectors to flee to the South. It was further revealed that a small number of people living close to the Korean Demilitarized Zone have been tampering with their television sets in order to receive signals from South Korean broadcast stations in the vicinity, while CDs and DVDs smuggled across the border with China also increased the reach of South Korean popular culture in the North. In 2012, the Institute surveyed a larger group of 100 North Korean defectors. According to this research, South Korean media was prevalent within the North Korean elite. It also affirmed that North Koreans living close to the border with China had the highest degree of access to South Korean entertainment, as opposed to other areas of the country. Notels, Chinese-made portable media players that have been popular in North Korea since 2005, have been credited with contributing to the spread of the \"Hallyu\" wave in the Northern country.\n\nIn October 2012, the Leader of North Korea, Kim Jong-un, gave a speech to the Korean People's Army in which he vowed to \"extend the fight against the enemy's ideological and cultural infiltration\". A study conducted earlier that year by an international group commissioned by the U.S. State Department came to the conclusion that North Korea was \"increasingly anxious\" to keep the flow of information at bay, but had little ability to control it, as there was \"substantial demand\" for movies and television programs from the South as well as many \"intensely entrepreneurial\" smugglers from the Chinese side of the border willing to fulfill the demand.\n\nIn February 2013, South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported that Psy's 2012 single \"Gangnam Style\" had \"deeply permeated North Korea\", after a mission group had disseminated K-pop CDs and other cultural goods across the China–North Korea border.\n\nOn May 15, 2013, the NGO Human Rights Watch confirmed that \"entertainment shows from South Korea are particularly popular and have served to undermine the North Korean government's negative portrayals of South Korea\".\n\nSouth Korea's tourism industry has been greatly influenced by the increasing popularity of its media. According to the Korea Tourism Organization (KTO), monthly tourist numbers have increased from 311,883 in March 1996 to 1,389,399 in March 2016.\n\nThe Korean Tourism Organisation recognises K-pop and other aspects of the Korean Wave as pull factors for tourists, and launched a campaign in 2014 entitled \"Imagine your Korea\", which highlighted Korean entertainment as an important part of tourism. According to a KTO survey of 3,775 K-pop fans in France, 9 in 10 said they wished to visit Korea, while more than 75 percent answered that they were actually planning to go. In 2012, Korean entertainment agency S.M. Entertainment expanded into the travel sector, providing travel packages for those wanting to travel to Korea to attend concerts of artists signed under its label.\n\nMany fans of Korean television dramas are also motivated to travel to Korea, sometimes to visit filming locations such as Nami Island, where \"Winter Sonata\" was shot and where there were over 270,000 visitors in 2005, or Dae Jang Geum Theme Park. The majority of these tourists are female. K-drama actors such as Kim Soo-hyun have appeared in KTO promotional materials.\n\nThe Korean Wave has also been met with backlash and anti-Korean sentiment in countries such as China, Japan, and Taiwan. Existing negative attitudes towards Korean culture may be rooted in nationalism or historical conflicts.\n\nIn China, producer Zhang Kuo Li described the Korean Wave as a \"cultural invasion\" and advised Chinese people to reject Korean exports.\n\nIn Japan, an anti-Korean comic, \"Manga Kenkanryu\" (\"Hating the Korean Wave\") was published on July 26, 2005, and became a No. 1 bestseller on the Amazon Japan site. On August 8, 2011, Japanese actor Sousuke Takaoka openly showed his dislike for the Korean Wave on Twitter, which triggered an Internet movement to boycott Korean programs on Japanese television. Anti-Korean sentiment also surfaced when Kim Tae-hee, a Korean actress, was selected to be on a Japanese soap opera in 2011; since she had been an activist in the Liancourt Rocks dispute for the Dokdo movement in Korea, some Japanese people were enraged that she would be on the Japanese TV show. There was a protest against Kim Tae-hee in Japan, which later turned into a protest against the Korean Wave. According to a Korea Times article posted in February 2014, \"Experts and observers in Korea and Japan say while attendance at the rallies is still small and such extreme actions are far from entering the mainstream of Japanese politics, the hostile demonstrations have grown in size and frequency in recent months.\"\n\nThe Korean entertainment industry has also been criticised for its methods and links to corruption, as reported by Al Jazeera in February 2012.\n\nIn the West, some commentators noted similarities between the South Korean Ministry of Culture's support of the Korean Wave and the CIA's involvement in the Cultural Cold War with the former Soviet Union. According to The Quietus magazine, suspicion of \"hallyu\" as a venture sponsored by the South Korean government to strengthen its political influence bears \"a whiff of the old Victorian fear of Yellow Peril\".\n\nThe South Korean entertainment industry has been faced with claims of mistreatment towards its musical artists. This issue came to a head when popular boy group TVXQ brought their management company to court over allegations of mistreatment. The artists claimed they had not been paid what they were owed and that their 13-year contracts were far too long. While the court did rule in their favor, allegations of mistreatment of artists are still rampant.\n\n\n"}

It was founded on 1 March 1926 by the Alliance of Protestant Churches - The Church of Scotland Mission (later known as the Presbyterian Church of East Africa or PCEA), Church of the Province of Kenya (CPK), African Inland Church (AIC), the Friends Church (Quakers) and the Methodist Church.\n\nThe school is situated in Kikuyu, about 22 kilometers (12 miles) from Nairobi's central business district. The school is a 10-minute walk from the Alliance Girls' High School, which has been its sister school.\n\nAlliance High School has always been ranked within the top ten best schools in each year's National Examinations. It was ranked first in the country from 1960 to 1985. In 1986 it lost its top ranking for the first time in 25 years, slipping to third. It was ranked first in the country in 2005 based on the results of the Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (KCSE). In 2006, it was ranked third. In 2009 and 2010, the school emerged top in the KCSE results posting sterling performance. In 2011, the school dropped one place to second. In 2013 the school was on top again with a mean grade of A- beating other famous schools like Starehe Boys' Centre and School\n\nThe school motto is \"Strong to Serve\". The Old Boys association has a website and a Yahoo group known as Bushfire.\n\nIn the early days of the colonial era in Kenya, the colonialists believed that Africans should not be allowed an education beyond the basic level as they would not benefit from any higher education. The rationale was that Africans were only useful as a source of cheap labour. Missionaries who had been arriving in the country from the beginning of the 20th century strongly opposed this idea. The missionaries had been trying to set up primary schools to provide basic education to Africans, but they faced challenges due to lack of funding. Dr. John Arthur, who was in charge of the Kikuyu mission arranged for a conference with other Protestant missions to address these problems. The first meeting took place in 1913 in Kikuyu. Later in the year 1918, the Alliance of Protestant Missions was formed comprising the Church of Scotland Mission, Church of the Province of Kenya, the African Inland Mission, the Friends Church (Quakers) and the Methodist Church.\n\nDr. Arthur pushed the British government to open education to Kenyans and all Africans in all colonies. He believed that Kenyans should be given access to primary, secondary and tertiary level education as a matter of right. His efforts bore fruit when the Devonshire White Paper was written in 1923. This meant that Africans were also entitled to a quality education. Dr. Arthur realised the need to have new institutions set up. He worked tirelessly, without the government's backing to establish a high school for Africans in Kikuyu. The school was finally established on 1 March 1926 under the auspices of the Alliance of Protestant Missions. Thus, the Alliance High School was born.\n\nEvery year, 200 students are selected based on academic merit and quota as per the education policy. Academic merit is based on performance of the K.C.P.E exams. Its quota system sees to it that the school admits boys from every county in the country though with bias to students from public schools as the current education policy requires.\n\nStudents are admitted on a need-blind basis. At any given time, there are needy students whose tuition and boarding fees are paid by parties other than their parents or guardians. This is thanks to the school's strong alumni network (the Old Boys Club) as well as the large number of friends the school has around the world.\nThe school is the highest performing high school in the country academically, always being ranked among the top 10 positions every year. The school holds the country record for most consecutive years holding the pole position in the national exams(1960-1985) . In the K.C.S.E results announced in 2011, the school emerged top in the country. In that same year, the school had more than 100 students scoring a mean grade of A in the national exams. In 2009 and 2010, the school emerged top in the K.C.S.E results posting sterling performance. In 2011, the school was ranked second.\n\nEvery year, over 98% of the school's graduates get admission to Kenyan universities. Some Alliance High alumni have proceeded to join various universities around the world such as Harvard, Yale, Brown, Stanford, Duke University, Williams College, Tufts University, and MIT. Others go on to attend universities in Australia, China, Japan, Malaysia, South Africa, the United Kingdom among other countries.\n\nHaving been founded by Christian missionaries, the school holds Christian values with high esteem. For instance, the school's badge is embodied with the cross, students say grace before partaking any meal and there is a daily Chapel Service (except on Saturdays) which is compulsory for all Christian students.\n\nHowever, being a national school that draws students from all over the country, Alliance High School has a small population of non-Christian students, mostly Muslims. These students have the liberty to practise their faith. When the Christian students attend the daily morning chapel service, Muslim students congregate separately to carry out a religious service of their own. Although there is no permanent mosque in the school, there is always a room set aside that serves as a mosque. Due to Islamic Sharia dietary requirements, Muslim students have separate tables in the dining hall.\n\nThe school has an anthem which is sang to mark the end of special occasions such as the Founders day, Speech Day or the closing parade of the term. The anthem can also be sang when there is an occasion to celebrate, such as when the K.C.S.E results are released. The anthem is a rendition of hymn 578 of the Lutheran Hymnal, \"Lord, While for All Mankind We Pray\"\n\n<poem>\nHave in thy keeping O lord, our God, this school; \nThat its work may be thorough and its life joyful;\nThat from it may go out, \nStrong in body, mind and character, men who \nIn Thy name and with Thy power,\nWill serve their fellows faithfully, through Jesus Christ our Lord.\nAmen\n</poem>\n\nFor what we are about to receive,\n\nWe thank you Lord,\n\nAmen\n\n<poem>\nLord while for all mankind we pray,\nOf every Clime and coast, \nOh hear us for our native school, \nThe school we love the most x3\n</poem>\n\nThe school is a participant in the national sports festival. The following games are offered at the school: athletics, badminton, basketball, football (soccer), handball, hockey, lawn tennis, rugby football, swimming and table tennis.\n\nThe school has three basketball courts, two football pitches, two hockey pitches, a swimming pool, a handball field, an athletics track and a gymnasium with table tennis table.\n\nThe school's routine includes a games period every weekday from 16:15hrs to 17:40hrs. On Tuesdays the program is suspended for clubs’ and societies’ meetings. There are inter-house sports competitions spread across the three school terms.\n\nDuring the second school term, a mini Olympics is held in the school. During this event, the thirteen houses compete against each other in track and field events. The winning house receives the Standards Trophy and gets to feast on a bull during the end of term school dinner.\n\nThere is also a compulsory cross-country jog on the first weekend of the school term. This event is particularly popular yet unpopular among the students; many approach it with zeal while many an A.H.S student approach the games master with an excuse in an effort to avoid the jog.\n\nThere are over 20 clubs and societies including the Research Club, The World Scholars Cup, The Dramatic Society, law and debate club, the MIT launch X, social welfare society, the Scouts Movement, the International Information Exchange Program Club, the school choir, the Men-in-Brass(School Band), the Science and Robotics Club, the Integrity Club, the Writers’ Club, the Poetry Society, Kiswahili Club, the Model United Nations, the Seventh Day Adventists(S.D.A) Society,the Young Catholic Society(YCS), the Christian Union, Muslim Association among many others. These clubs usually meet on Tuesdays from 16:16hrs to 17:30hrs.\n\nThe Alliance High School Scouts is one of the first troop of African scouts in the continent.\n\nThe school has several exchange programs but the longest running ones are the Brooks Exchange Program and the Sir John Leeman Exchange Program. There is also the Governor's Exchange Program.\n\nEvery year, two form 3 students of outstanding character both inside and outside the classroom are chosen to participate in the Brooks Exchange Program. The two students usually serve as hosts to two other students from Brooks School. Unlike the Brooks Exchange Program, the Sir John Leeman Exchange Program takes place once every 2 years.\n\nThe school has thirteen houses, four of which are newly built(2016), which house almost 1500 students. The houses are, in order of age, and with the reason for the name:\n\nACE Sanders\nMany activities within the school are based on the house system. This includes the arrangement at the parade ground where assemblies are conducted every morning and role call parades conducted. Inter house competitions include music and elocution, drama, math contest, Swahili contest, essay writing contest, battle of the blocks writing challenge, cleanliness competitions, and sports such as soccer, rugby, racquet games, swimming, etc.\n\nAt the end of every term, during the school dinner, awarding sessions are held where the winning house in every category receives a carton of biscuits. First and second runners up receive half and quarter a carton respectively. The winning house in standards and athletics, K.C.S.E. and cross country is awarded a bull which is slaughtered and offered for a party.\n\nThe houses have a committee of form 3 students who run the house's day-to-day activities. The committee is usually chosen by the house prefects and the house master. It is composed mainly of the chairman, vice chairman, secretary, organizing secretary, activities coordinator and the resource manager and two members of the house's choice. However, houses may have additional positions which vary depending on their need. In most cases, these committee members end up as the house prefects. However, this trend is changing to incorporate students with impeccable leadership qualities who did not make it to the house committees into the prefecture body.\n\nStudents in these houses are housed in hostels. The hostels are structured into cubicles where four students share one cubicle. The hostels have wash room facilities with hot showers, laundry areas, ironing bays, a common room and open lawns. Due to the current high population old houses have been renovated to house the rapidly growing population.\n\nPrefects at the school are usually form 4 students who have shown outstanding leadership abilities at the house level. Most of them are chosen from the house committees. During the second term of the academic year, they are appointed to be prefects by the principal after being nominated and vetted by the house masters and current house prefects. They are then put through a rigorous training session by their fourth form counterparts in preparation for running the school the following year.\n\nThe prefects are key to the running of the school. It is they who see that the school routine and school rules are adhered to. They have the authority to punish culprits via the prefect's punishment department. Punishments include washing corridors and rooms, slashing fields and in some extreme cases, working in the school farm or uprooting tree stumps.\nA total of about 90 prefects are chosen each year and among the 90, 24 of the most outstanding prefects are given top honors in becoming Senior Prefects or Captains. These Captains are allocated various major departments in the school. The school's departments include:\n\n\nEach department has its department members which vary with the demands of the department. Each house similarly produces a House Captain to be assisted by his Dorm Prefects.\n\nThe top five captains are referred to as the Pentagon. They are the School Captain, the Deputy School Captain, the Dining Hall Captain, the Entertainment Captain, and the Games Captain. The prefects' body is given a name each year, e.g. Martinets (2014), Autocrats (2015), Acculturates (2016), Despotians (2017), Relictans (2018), Nomandians(2019), and is governed by the School Captain (The Governor General) and the Deputy School Captain (The President).\n\nThe Alliance High School maintains strong ties with its sister school, Alliance Girls High School, ever since the latter was founded as the African Girls High School in 1948. Each of the thirteen houses at the Alliance High School have sister houses at Alliance Girls High School. The houses usually participate in an event called Socials that takes place at the end of first and second terms. There is also a joint Christmas Carol service held in the school chapel towards the end of the third term. On Sunday mornings, Muslim students from the girls’ school usually congregate with their male counterparts at the Alliance High School's Carey Francis Memorial Lecture Theater. Mail correspondence between the two schools takes place on a daily basis and is free of charge.\n\nThe Alliance High School community is rich in culture. The form ones take the unpopular tie test before they can be issued with the school's blue tie. This test serves to educate the freshmen on the school's history and current affairs at the school. Upon arrival, every form 1 student is assigned a ‘guardian’ who is a form 2 student that helps the new student find his way around the school in the first few weeks.\n\nThe art of 'lifting' is a common practice especially among form two and three students. Lifting is the process of one showing their leadership qualities through various ways so as to be considered for various leadership positions especially as prefects.\n\nOver the years, the school has opened and closed its term calendar on Thursdays. The first Saturday is often marked with a cross-country race. Closing days are characterized by a school dinner on the closing eve, where students are treated to a sumptuous meal and an award ceremony held. The school is then closed early next morning through a final assembly where the students sing the dismissal hymn, \"Lord dismiss us with thy blessing.\"\n\nThursday is a special day at the Alliance High School. On Thursdays, students conduct hymn practice in the chapel, students speak Swahili, fish is served during dinner, among other activities.\n\nThe most popular form of entertainment in the school is the Saturday movies. Every Saturday the entertainment committee which consists of form 2s and 3s and the entertainment department which has about 5 prefects organizes and prepares the Saturday movies plus the Saturday Evening Paper (SEP). School movies held in the school hall were previously charged sh 20 but are now free to all and sundry. However, the most popular movies are the joint movies that are usually held termly with the Alliance Girls’ School. These used to be held at night but have since been changed to afternoons.\n\nThe high school life is fun and exciting. Various platforms like the drama and music competitions provide students with a chance to showcase their talents. The Drama Club organizes the biggest Comic Show of the entire year called \"Span One\" where students simulate the Monday morning School Assembly and try to imitate their teachers. The School Choir also organizes the Music Night which features presentations not only from the choir but also dances from all the communities in the country.\n\nBoys at the school wear white shirts, khaki shorts, grey stockings with two blue stripes on either side of a red stripe; black or brown shoes; jungle green pullovers and a blue tie. Grey trousers are worn on Weekends, Wednesdays and school events such as on Founders Day Celebrations. Junior prefects wear ties with red stripes rather than the conventional blue one while their senior counterparts' ties are black with red stripes.Senior commoners wear navy blue ties.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2265814", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2265814", "title": "Urban Strike", "text": "Urban Strike\n\nUrban Strike is a video game developed and published by Electronic Arts. It was initially released for the Sega Genesis in 1994, with ports to the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and Game Gear in 1995 and to the Game Boy in 1996. It is the third game in the \"Strike\" series, after \"\" and \"Jungle Strike\".\n\n\"Urban Strike\" takes place in 2001 (2006 in SNES/Game Gear/Game Boy release) and centers around the antagonist H. R. Malone, a millionaire media mogul, ex-presidential candidate, and fanatic cult leader who promotes a moralistic agenda that will expunge corruption from America and promises that his personal security force will tackle crime. Despite being considered dangerous, Malone's charisma has won him many American followers.\n\nAs the plot begins, one of Malone's men is revealed to be \"Agent Ego\" (played by co-Designer, Tony Barnes), a spy for the fictional \"Strike C.O.R.E.\" organization and a former co-pilot from the events of \"Jungle Strike\". Ego reports to his superiors that Malone is planning construction of a superweapon with which to destabilize the U.S. government, and that valuable components are being collected in Hawaii. However, he is unaware that Malone has penetrated his cover, and Ego is killed with a car-bomb. The player character takes the news of Ego's death very personally.\n\nThe first mission takes place in Hawaii, where the player character intercepts Malone's attempted theft of giant mirrors and sees to the rescue of a plastic surgeon being targeted by assassins. After the mission's completion, the plastic surgeon reveals that he had operated on a horribly deformed burn victim in Washington DC many years ago, who later turned out to be Malone. The plastic surgeon says he was marked for death because he had recently deduced that the man he actually operated on was Carlos Ortega, who was one of the two main antagonists in (and was presumed killed at the end of) \"Jungle Strike\".\n\nAfter further missions in Mexico and San Francisco, Malone finishes the superweapon and fires it at New York City, causing mass destruction and chaos. As the player flies out to control the damage and rescue civilians, Malone fires the weapon twice more, allowing Strike C.O.R.E. to track its location: a facility located near Las Vegas. After infiltrating the facility and capturing Malone, the madman attempts to kill the player by detonating a time-bomb strapped to his chest, but the player drops Malone onto his own superweapon as it detonates, destroying them both at once.\n\n\"Urban Strike\" is a helicopter based shoot 'em up, mixing action and strategy, retaining its predecessor's core mechanics, and expanding on the model with additional vehicles and settings. This time, the campaign takes the player all over the North American continent, beginning in Hawaii and moving through locations in Mexico, San Francisco, New York, and Las Vegas.\n\nThe main model helicopter used in this game is known as the Mohican, which is designed for speed and combat. A larger, heavier model called the Blackhawke (designed for large-scale rescues) can be flown during the first two levels, and an experimental Ground Assault Vehicle (GAV) can be stolen and piloted in the third level. A new feature introduced in this game is on-foot missions, where the player is required to leave the helicopter at certain points and enter internal environments armed with a rifle and missile launcher.\n\nLevels consist of several missions, which are based around the destruction of enemy weapons and installations, as well as rescuing hostages or prisoners of war, or capturing enemy personnel. The Mohican helicopter is armed with machine guns, more powerful Hydra rockets and yet more deadly Hellfire missiles. The more powerful the weapon, the fewer can be carried: the player must choose an appropriate weapon for each situation.\n\nThe player's craft has a limited amount of armor, which is depleted as the vehicle is hit by enemy fire. Should the armor reach zero, the craft will be destroyed, costing the player a life. The player must outmaneuver enemies to avoid damage, but can replenish armor by means of power-ups or by airlifting rescued friendlies or captives to a landing zone. The Mohican has a finite amount of fuel which is steadily depleted as the level progresses. Should the fuel run out the Mohican will crash, again costing the player a life. The craft can refuel by collecting fuel barrels. The helicopter also carries limited ammunition, which must be replenished by means of ammo crates.\n\nRussian magazine \"Great Drakon\" felt \"Urban Strike\" to be too easy and thus the weakest game in the series. The 88% review in \"Mega\" said \"Very good all round, but EA has taken the genre as far as it can go\". Reviewing the Genesis version, \"GamePro\" deemed it \"a top-notch helicopter-combat cart\", citing the \"ten massive missions\", combination of airborne and ground-based combat, new helicopter moves, and techno soundtrack.\n\nA critic for \"Next Generation\" declared that the Super NES version is more colorful than but overall inferior to the Genesis version, due to the less smooth controls and animation, but that it retains all the essential appeal of the Genesis version. He concluded that while the series formula was becoming stale, it still delivers for those who want more of the same, and gave it three out of five stars.\n\n\"Next Generation\" reviewed the Genesis version of the game, rating it three stars out of five, and stated that \"With all the great scenery, \"Urban Strike\" should be the best \"Strike\" game yet, but there's nothing new in the gameplay department, which is a shame.\"\n\n"}

Tasked to manage the public libraries and to lead them into the Information Age where non-print resources are making their mark, the NLB is aimed towards the creation of \"borderless libraries,\" an initiative aimed at bringing the libraries closer to Singaporeans, and to connect Singaporeans with the outside world.\n\nThe National libraries of Singapore house books in all four official languages of Singapore: English, Chinese, Malay and Tamil. Other than paper books, the libraries also loans CD-ROMs, DVD-ROMs, VCDs, video cassettes, audiobooks on CDs, magazines and periodicals, DVD-videos, Blu-rays and music CDs (the last two at the Esplanade outlet). Its flagship institution, the National Library, Singapore, has moved to its new premises at Victoria Street since 22 July 2005.\n\nAlthough the NLB was formed on 1 September 1995 only, its history began way back in the 1820s when Sir Stamford Raffles, founder of modern Singapore, first proposed the idea of establishing a public library in the thriving colony. This library was to evolve into the National Library of Singapore in 1960, before expanding into the suburbs with the setting up of branch libraries in the various new towns.\n\nIn 1995, when the NLB took over the duties of the National Library of Singapore, it was also entrusted with bringing to reality the findings of the Library 2000 Review Committee, set up in June 1992 to review the public library system. This committee, headed by Dr Tan Chin Nam, considered the role of information technology in contemporary library services for the next decade, with the aims of\n\n\nThe committee also took into consideration the library needs of public library users in general, the linguistic needs of an increasingly bilingual populace, the catering to the needs of professions who require extensive information databases, and the establishment of the library as a nucleus of national culture and heritage. After a year-long review, the Committee published their findings on 5 March 1994, which calls for six \"strategic thrusts\", which are\n\n\nIn addition, the report also speaks of three \"key enablers\" to bring about these changes, which are\n\n\nThe NLB was thus formed as a result of this Report. The NLB implements initiatives arising from the Report's recommendations, to help Singapore stay competitive in the global knowledge economy and become \"a more gracious society\".\n\nBasic membership\n\nFor Singapore citizens, the registration for basic membership is free. It allows borrowers to loan up to 16 library materials for 21 days, at any one time. \nFor permanent residents, there would be a one-time registration fee of S$10.50.\n\nPartner membership\n\nPartner membership is applicable only to PAssion Card holders. Basic library members with PAssion cards can also upgrade their membership accounts. \nMembers can loan up to 24 library materials for 21 days, at any one time.\n\nMembership for Foreigners\n\nForeigners are eligible to sign up for library membership in Singapore. It costs S$53.30, which includes a registration fee of S$10.50. It allows borrowers \nto loan up to 16 library materials for 21 days, at any one time.\n\nIn July 2014, the NLB announced that it was pulping three children's books, \"And Tango Makes Three\", \"The White Swan Express\", and \"Who's In My Family?\", following a user's complaint that the books' homosexual themes did not promote family values. In protest, several poets and writers resigned from the Singapore Writers Festival and the Singapore Literature Prize, while several boycotted a panel discussion hosted by the NLB. A petition was signed by 3,800 signatories to reinstate the books or relocate the books to a different section, while another petition supporting the NLB's decision was signed by 26,000. A group supporting the reinstating of the affected books organised an event called \"Let's Read Together\" at the atrium of the National Library, where members of the public could bring books of any content to read along with a penguin stuffed toy, drawing 250 people on 13 July 2014. Communications and Information Minister Yaacob Ibrahim later instructed the NLB to place \"And Tango Makes Three\" and \"The White Swan Express\" in the adult section instead of pulping them; \"Who's In My Family?\" had already been pulped. The NLB also later announced that book selection and review processes would be refined.\n\n\n"}

Daniel, is an American comic book writer and artist, known for his work on various books for DC Comics, including \"Teen Titans\", \"Flash: The Fastest Man Alive\", and \"Batman\".\n\nDaniel worked on various titles with Image Comics including his own creation, The Tenth. He also worked on titles for Marvel Comics. He gained status at DC Comics with his run on \"Teen Titans\" with writer Geoff Johns. He finished out the short lived \"Flash: The Fastest Man Alive\" series with Marc Guggenheim from issues #11-13, which ended with Bart Allen's death.\n\nFrom there, Daniel began his work for the main \"Batman\" title with writer Grant Morrison, beginning his run with issue #670. This issue began the \"\" crossover. He and Morrison collaborated on the \"Batman R.I.P.\" storyline during that time. After \"R.I.P.\", Daniel wrote and illustrated \"Battle for the Cowl\", the main mini-series dealing with the story's aftermath.\n\nIn 2009, after Judd Winick and Mark Bagley's four-issue run on \"Batman\", Tony Daniel took over for a six-issue arc handling both writing and art duties. Daniel worked with Grant Morrison again on issue #701-702. He returned as writer and artist starting with issue #704 in November 2010 with his arc on \"Batman\" coming to an end at issue #712. Shortly after, Daniel was announced as the writer and artist of the relaunched \"Detective Comics\", which was dubbed DC's flagship series. In addition, he was announced as the writer of DC's \"The Savage Hawkman\" series, which he would stay on until the eighth issue. Daniel stayed on \"Detective Comics\" until the twelfth issue, by which time he drew an annual for the series as well. \n\nIn July 2012, as part of the San Diego Comic-Con, Daniel was one of six artists who, along with DC co-publishers Jim Lee and Dan DiDio, participated in the production of \"Heroic Proportions\", an episode of the Syfy reality television competition series \"Face Off\", in which special effects were tasked to create a new superhero, with Daniel and the other DC artists on hand to help them develop their ideas. The winning entry's character, Infernal Core by Anthony Kosar, was featured in \"Justice League Dark\" #16 (March 2013), which was published January 30, 2013. The episode premiered on January 22, 2013, as the second episode of the fourth season.\n\nDaniel was announced as the artist for a two issue stint on the second volume of \"Justice League\". He was subsequently announced as the primary artist accompanying Andy Diggle on \"Action Comics\", following Grant Morrison's departure. However, after Diggle left the title after only issue #19 (Diggle was co-writer for #20 and co-plot issue #21), Daniel took on the scripting and art duties for the two following issues completing the three-part story \"Hybrid\", after which he too announced he would depart the series to work on a massive project for DC. This project was then announced in June 2013 to be \"Superman/Wonder Woman\", with Daniel on as the artist. After working with Charles Soule on \"Superman/Wonder Woman\", Daniel again returned to writing duties. Penciling and scripting the relaunch of the Deathstroke title, it sold out and headed off to a second printing.\n\n\n"}

It was proclaimed on 12 September 1945, as Korea was being divided into two occupation zones, with the Soviet Union occupying the north, and the United States occupying the south. Based on a network of people's committees, it presented a program of radical social change. In the south, the US military government outlawed the PRK on 12 December 1945, while in the north, the Soviet authorities co-opted the committees into the structure of the emerging Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea).\n\nOn 15 August 1945, the Japanese Empire was defeated by the Allies. The Imperial Japanese authorities requested that a government be established to ensure the safety of their persons and property after the occupation ended. Whilst the Soviet Union continued to fight the Japanese Empire in Chongjin, , who served in the Japanese Government-General sought to secure the return of the Japanese. He proposed to Song Jin-woo that he take over the security and administrative rights of Korea, but when this was rejected, he asked to meet Lyuh Woon-Hyung in Seoul. Under the leadership of Lyuh Woon-Hyung, the newly formed Committee for the Preparation of Korean Independence (CPKI) organized people's committees throughout the country to coordinate the transition to independence. On 28 August 1945 the CPKI announced that it would function as the temporary national government of Korea. On 12 September, CPKI activists met in Seoul and established the PRK.\n\nSecurity and administrative rights were transferred to Woon-Hyung, and the safety of the Japanese evacuating the Korean Peninsula was guaranteed. Accordingly, Woon-Hyung suggested the following conditions:\n\nThe reason why Woon-Hyung negotiated with the Governor-General was that the Japanese army was still slaughtering and leaving Koreans for dead both before the evacuation and immediately after liberation, the CPKI were worried that helpless people would suffer great injustice without it. \n\nAccordingly, the Governor-General's Deputy Prime Minister accepted the terms. That night, Lyuh Woon-hyung launched the National Preparatory Committee, basing its structure on the Founding Alliance, an underground secret independence movement that he had formed a year before in August 1944. Subsequently, Woon-hyung released all the political prisoners in Seodaemun Prison. Two days after the founding of the National Preparatory Committee was established, a systematic organizational network was established, expanded and reorganized. Lyuh Woon-hyung was elected chairman and An Jae-hong as Vice-chairman, who made the following declaration:\n\nThe PRK has great significance in that it is the first Korean political organization to implement local autonomy, in the form of the people's committees. By the end of August, more than 140 committees were established nationwide in response to the support of the people.\n\nThe organizational work of the National Preparatory Committee was also carried out in North Korea. The leader in the North Korean region was Cho Man-sik, a native of Pyongyang, a 'took a non-violent yet uncompromising route' during the Japanese colonial period. Under different regional conditions in the south and north of the Korean Peninsula, Yeo Woon-hyung and Cho Man-sik simultaneously launched the founding project.\n\nThe organization had different names and differences in composition, depending on which region was led by communists or nationalists. However, the goal had a great feature in that it provided a foundation for the construction of a new nation as a 'people's self-governing organization', created by both nationalists and socialists who had been engaged in the independence movement during the Japanese colonial period.\n\nSeo Joong-seok, a professor of history at Sungkyunkwan University, said, 'If there was no organization like the people's committees after liberation, there would have been great confusion. This is because major independence movement groups, including the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea, were far abroad. However, before the liberation, the founding alliance was organized mainly by domestic groups, who were able to voluntarily perform major tasks such as security and administration. '\n\nThe program of the PRK was presented in its 14 September twenty-seven point program. The program included: \"the confiscation without compensation of lands held by the Japanese and collaborators; free distribution of that land to the peasants; rent limits on the nonredistributed land; nationalization of such major industries as mining, transportation, banking, and communication; state supervision of small and mid-sized companies; …guaranteed basic human rights and freedoms, including those of speech, press, assembly, and faith; universal suffrage to adults over the age of eighteen; equality for women; labor law reforms including an eight-hour day, a minimum wage, and prohibition of child labor; and \"establishment of close relations with the United States, USSR, England [sic], and China, and positive opposition to any foreign influences interfering with the domestic affairs of the state.\"\n\nWhen Soviet troops entered Pyongyang on 24 August 1945, they found a local People's Committee established there, led by veteran Christian nationalist Cho Man-sik. Unlike their American counterparts, the Soviet authorities recognized and worked with the People's Committees By some accounts, Cho Man-sik was the Soviet government's first choice to lead North Korea.\n\nIn December 1945, at the Moscow Conference, the Soviet Union agreed to a US proposal for a trusteeship over Korea for up to five years in the lead-up to independence. Most Koreans demanded independence immediately, but Kim and the other Communists supported the trusteeship under pressure from the Soviet government. Cho Man-sik opposed the proposal at a public meeting on 4 January 1946, and disappeared into house arrest. On 8 February 1946, the People's Committees were reorganized as Interim People's Committees dominated by Communists. The new regime instituted popular policies of land redistribution, industry nationalization, labor law reform, and equality for women. Meanwhile, existing Communist groups were reconstituted as the Workers' Party of Korea under Kim Il-sung's leadership.\n\nAfter the failure of negotiations for unification, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) was proclaimed on 9 September 1948, with Kim Il-sung as premier.\n\nAfter the American arrival in September 1945, the United States Army Military Government in Korea controlled the peninsula south of the 38th parallel. The military governor Lieutenant-General John R. Hodge refused to recognize the PRK and its People's Committees, and outlawed it on 12 December. He later stated, \"one of our missions was to break down this Communist government\". On July 19, 1947, Lyuh Woon-hyung was assassinated by a right-wing Korean.\n\nEdgar Snow, an American journalist, returned to Korea after its liberation and stayed for two months to report on the situation:\nSome local units of the People's Republic remained active in the Jeolla region and especially on Jeju Island, where their presence, together with marauding anti-communist youth gangs, contributed to tensions that exploded in the events known as Jeju uprising of 1948–1949.\n\nEarly November saw the creation of the National Council of Korean Labor Unions (NCKLU) and its endorsement of PRK and its program. December saw the creation of the National League of Peasant Unions, the Korean Democratic Youth League, and the Women's League, and their support of the PRK.\n\n\n \n"}

{"id": "2265848", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2265848", "title": "Border campaign (Irish Republican Army)", "text": "Border campaign (Irish Republican Army)\n\nThe border campaign (12 December 1956 – 26 February 1962) was a guerrilla warfare campaign (codenamed Operation Harvest) carried out by the Irish Republican Army (IRA) against targets in Northern Ireland, with the aim of overthrowing British rule there and creating a united Ireland.\n\nPopularly referred to as the border campaign, it was also referred to as the \"Resistance Campaign\" by some Irish republican activists. The campaign was a military failure, but for some of its members, the campaign was justified as it had kept the IRA engaged for another generation.\n\nThis was the fifth republican campaign against British rule in Ireland in the 20th century (the first was the Easter Rising, the second during the Irish War of Independence, the third 1939–40, the fourth took place from 1942–1944, and a sixth was to take place from 1969–1997).\n\nThe border campaign was the first major military undertaking carried out by the IRA since the 1940s, when the harsh security measures of the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland governments had severely weakened it. In 1939 the IRA tried a bombing campaign in England to try to force British withdrawal from Northern Ireland. From 1942–1944 it also mounted an ineffective campaign in Northern Ireland. Internment on both sides of the border, as well as internal feuding and disputes over future policy, all but destroyed the organisation. These campaigns were officially called off on 10 March 1945. By 1947, the IRA had only 200 activists, according to its own general staff.\n\nIn principle, the IRA wished to overthrow both \"partitionist\" states in Ireland, both Northern Ireland and the Irish Free State, both of which it deemed to be illegitimate entities imposed by Britain at the time of the Anglo-Irish Treaty in 1922. However, in 1948 a General Army Convention issued General Order No. 8, prohibiting \"any armed action whatsoever\" against the forces of the recently proclaimed Republic of Ireland, amounting to a \"de facto\" recognition of the state. Under the new policy, IRA volunteers who were caught with arms in the Republic of Ireland were ordered to dump or destroy them and not to take defensive action.\n\nFrom then on, armed action was focused on Northern Ireland, which was still part of the United Kingdom and which was dominated by Protestant unionists. The idea of a campaign launched from the Republic against Northern Ireland, first mooted by Tom Barry in the 1930s, gained currency within IRA circles as the 1950s went on. In 1954, after an arms raid at Gough Barracks in Armagh, a speaker at the Wolfe Tone commemoration at Bodenstown repeated that IRA policy was directed solely against British forces in Northern Ireland.\n\nIRA Chief of Staff Tony Magan set out to create \"a new Army, untarnished by the dissent and scandals of the previous decade,\" according to J. Bowyer Bell. One of its advisers was a retired British Major-General, Eric Dorman-Smith. The IRA was officially \"apolitical,\" existing only to overthrow the \"British-imposed political institutions\" in Ireland. However Magan believed that a degree of political mobilization was necessary and the relationship with Sinn Féin which had soured during the 30s was improved. At the 1949 IRA Convention, the IRA ordered its members to join Sinn Féin, which would partially become the \"civilian wing\" of the IRA.\n\nBy the middle of this decade, moreover, the IRA had substantially re-armed. This was achieved by means of arms raids launched between 1951 and 1954, on British military bases in Northern Ireland and England. Arms were taken from Derry, Omagh, Essex, Berkshire and Armagh. At the latter raid on Gough barracks in Armagh in June 1954, the IRA seized 250 Lee–Enfield rifles, 37 submachine guns, nine Bren guns and 40 training rifles. On 25 July 1953, there was an IRA arms raid on the armoury of the Officer Training Corps at Felsted, a private school in Essex. In that raid, the IRA netted over 108 rifles, ten Bren and eight Sten guns, two mortars and dummy mortar bombs. The police seized the van carrying the stolen weapons some hours later.\n\nBy 1955, splits were occurring in the IRA, as several small groups, impatient for action, launched their own attacks in Northern Ireland. One such activist, Brendan O'Boyle blew himself up with his own bomb in the summer of that year. Another, Liam Kelly founded a breakaway group Saor Uladh (\"Free Ulster\") and in November 1955, attacked a Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) barracks at Roslea in County Fermanagh. One RUC man was badly injured and a Republican fighter was killed in the incident. In August of the following year, Kelly and another IRA dissident, Joe Christle, burned down some customs posts on the border.\n\nIn November 1956, the IRA finally began its own border campaign. They were partly motivated by a desire to prevent any more splits in their organisation. They were also encouraged by the results of the UK general election of 1955, when Sinn Féin (since 1949, largely dominated by IRA members) candidates were elected MPs for the Mid-Ulster and Fermanagh and South Tyrone constituencies in Northern Ireland, with a total of 152,310 votes. This appeared to show that there was a substantial Irish republican support base within Northern Ireland. However, as the mainstream Nationalist Party had decided not to take part in the election, its supporters had voted for Sinn Féin instead.\n\nThe plan for the border campaign – codenamed \"Operation Harvest\" – was devised by Seán Cronin. It envisaged the use of guerrilla units called flying columns, initially four units of about 50 men each. They were to operate from within the Republic of Ireland and to attack military and infrastructural targets within Northern Ireland. In addition, another twenty organisers were sent to various locations within Northern Ireland to train new units, gather intelligence and report back to the leadership in Dublin. An IRA document probably seized in Dublin in a raid on Cronin's flat, on 8 January 1957, stated that the aim of the campaign was to:\n\"break down the enemy’s administration in the occupied area until he is forced to withdraw his forces. Our method of doing this is guerrilla warfare within the occupied area and propaganda directed at its inhabitants. In time as we build up our forces, we hope to be in a position to liberate large areas and tie these in with other liberated areas – that is areas where the enemy’s writ no longer runs\".\n\nNo actions were to take place in Belfast, the capital and biggest city in Northern Ireland. It was excluded because Paddy Doyle, the Belfast operational commander and a member of the Army Council, was arrested and the unit was disorganized, although Hanley and Millar attribute the non-participation of the Belfast IRA to fears that informers had access to the IRA's plans. There was also a desire not to provoke reprisals by loyalists against the Catholic/nationalist population there. This had happened on a large scale in 1920–22, during and after the Irish War of Independence.\n\nOn 12 December the campaign was launched with simultaneous attacks by around 150 IRA members on targets on the Border in the early hours. A BBC relay transmitter was bombed in Derry, a courthouse was burned in Magherafelt by a unit led by an 18-year-old Seamus Costello, as was a B-Specials post near Newry and a half-built Army barracks at Enniskillen was blown up. A raid on Gough barracks in Armagh was beaten off after a brief exchange of fire.\n\nThe IRA issued a statement announcing the start of the campaign, \"Spearheaded by Ireland’s freedom fighters, our people have carried the fight to the enemy…Out of this national liberation struggle a new Ireland will emerge, upright and free. In that new Ireland, we shall build a country fit for all our people to live in. That then is our aim: an independent, united, democratic Irish Republic. For this we shall fight until the invader is driven from our soil and victory is ours\". Despite formal condemnation of the IRA by the Roman Catholic hierarchy, many units were given absolution before going out on operation.\nOn 14 December: An IRA column under Seán Garland detonated four bombs (one of which blew in the front wall) outside Lisnaskea RUC station before raking it with gunfire. Further attacks on Derrylin and Roslea RUC barracks on the same day were beaten off.\nOn 21 December: In response to the statement the government of Northern Ireland under Basil Brooke used the Special Powers Act to intern several hundred republican suspects without trial. Over 100 men were arrested on 12 January 1957. This, in time, severely limited the IRA's capacity to build up units within Northern Ireland.\nOn the evening of December 30, the Teeling Column under Noel Kavanagh attacked the Derrylin RUC barracks again, killing RUC constable John Scally, the first fatality of the campaign. Others involved in that attack included two prominent IRA men, Charlie Murphy and Ruairí Ó Brádaigh.\n\nThe year 1957 was the most active year of the IRA's campaign, with 341 incidents recorded.\n\nThe most dramatic attack of the whole campaign took place on 1 January: 14 IRA volunteers, including Séan Garland, Alan O Brien and Dáithí Ó Conaill planned an attack on a joint RUC/B Specials barracks in Brookeborough, County Fermanagh, though they attacked the wrong building. During the attack a number of volunteers were injured including Séan Garland. Fergal O'Hanlon and Seán South died of their wounds as they were making their escape. The remainder of the group were pursued back over the border by 400 RUC, B Specials and British soldiers.\nThe funerals of South and O’Hanlon in the Republic produced a strong emotional reaction among the general public there. The two men are still considered martyrs in Irish Republican circles. Up to 50,000 people attended their funerals.\n\nShortly afterwards the Republic's government, led by John Costello of Fine Gael, feared that the IRA's action would drag it into a diplomatic confrontation with Britain. It used the Offences Against the State Act to arrest most of the IRA's leadership, including its Chief of Staff, Seán Cronin. Clann na Poblachta (led by former IRA Chief of Staff Seán MacBride) withdrew its support for the government in protest over this policy. In the ensuing Irish general election, 1957, Sinn Féin won four seats and polled 65,640 votes (c. 5% of those cast), while Clann na Poblachta's vote dropped sharply. However, Clann na Poblachta were very weak originally in the constituencies where Sinn Féin fielded candidates.\n\nThe new government, of Fianna Fáil, led by Éamon de Valera proved even more hostile to the IRA than its predecessor. In July 1957, after the killing of an RUC man, de Valera introduced wholesale internment without trial for IRA suspects. The use of internment on both sides of the Irish border made it impossible for the IRA, most of whose leadership was imprisoned, to maintain the momentum of their campaign.\n\nOn 11 November: The IRA suffered its worst loss of life in the period when four of its members died preparing a bomb in a farm house at Edentubber, County Louth, which exploded prematurely. The civilian owner of the house was also killed. It is believed they were going to attack an empty customs post and electricity pylons in Northern Ireland. They would later be referred to by republicans as the \"Edentubber Martyrs\".\n\nBy 1958, the campaign's initial impetus had largely dissipated. Certain IRA activities produced public hostility and by 1958, there were already many within the IRA in favour of calling the campaign off. The Cork IRA, for instance, had effectively withdrawn. By mid-1958, 500 republicans were in gaol or interned, North and South. The decline in activity meant that the Fianna Fáil government in the South felt confident enough to end internment in March 1959. Following their release, some of the interned leaders met Sean Cronin in a farmhouse in County Laois and were persuaded to continue the campaign \"to keep the flame alive\". In 1960, the number of incidents fell to just 26. Moreover, many of these actions consisted of minor acts of sabotage, for example the cratering of roads.\n\nThat summer two IRA men were killed in separate gun battles with the RUC on the border in County Fermanagh, Aloysius Hand in July and James Crossan in August.\n\nThe period after the summer of 1958 saw a steep drop in the intensity of the IRA campaign. That the IRA's campaign had run its course by 1960 is testified by the fact that the Republic of Ireland's government closed the Curragh camp, which housed internees in the South, on 15 March 1959 (judging them to be no further threat). The Northern Irish government followed suit on 25 April 1961.\n\nIn November 1961 An RUC officer, William Hunter, was killed in a gun battle with the IRA in south County Armagh. This was the final fatality of the conflict. Minister for Justice, Charles Haughey reactivated the Special Criminal Court, which handed down long prison sentences to convicted IRA men.\n\nBy late 1961, the campaign was over. It had cost the lives of eight IRA men, four republican supporters and six RUC members. In addition, 32 RUC members were wounded. A total of 256 Republicans were interned in Northern Ireland in this period and another 150 or so in the Republic. Of those in Northern Ireland, 89 had signed a pledge to renounce violence in return for their freedom.\n\nAlthough it had petered out by the late 1950s, the campaign was officially called off on 26 February 1962. In a press release issued that day, drafted by Ruairí Ó Brádaigh who consulted with several other persons including members of the Army Council, the IRA Army Council stated:\n\nThe statement was released by the Irish Republican Publicity Bureau and signed \"J. McGarrity, Secretary.\"\n\nImplicit in the statement was a recognition that the IRA, after a promising start in 1957, had failed to mobilise much popular support behind its campaign.\n\n\nThe border campaign was considered a disaster by some IRA members, not least because it enjoyed practically no support from the nationalist population of Northern Ireland. Even before the campaign ended some within the organisation had begun to consider other avenues in pursuit of the organisation's goals. Many of those involved with the border campaign felt that their lack of support was due to a failure to address the social and economic issues faced by ordinary people. The early seeds of addressing such issues are found in Sinn Féin election materials in the late 1950s and early 1960s.\n\nThe larger unionist population in Northern Ireland was further alienated from Irish republicanism by the campaign, and considered that its internment policy had worked. However, the policy was to fail when it was repeated in the 1970s.\n\nCathal Goulding, who became IRA Chief of Staff in 1962, tried to move the IRA away from pure militarism and towards left wing and ultimately Marxist politics. This process ended with the 1969/70 split in the republican movement between the Official IRA and Provisional IRA wings. The Officials, under Goulding wanted to transform the movement into a revolutionary party involved in both parliamentary and street politics, while the Provisionals under Ruairí Ó Brádaigh, wanted to maintain the movement's traditional refusal to engage in parliamentary politics. More immediately, the Provisional faction wanted to use armed force to defend the Catholic community in Belfast from loyalist attacks in the civil strife that had broken out in Northern Ireland (the start of \"The Troubles\"), but the Official IRA, as led by Goulding, also engaged as Belfast defenders. A key difference is that, ultimately, the Provisionals also wanted to re-build the IRA's military capacity to launch a new armed campaign.\n\nThe Officials and Provisionals went their separate ways in 1969. The Official IRA maintained armed actions up until 1972, but characterised them as \"defensive\". Feuds between the two IRAs in the 1970s claimed about twenty lives. The Provisional IRA launched what turned out to be a much more sustained and destructive campaign than the border campaign – the Provisional IRA campaign 1969–1997, which was to claim up to 1,800 lives.\n\n\"Soldiers of Folly – The IRA Border Campaign 1956–1962\", by Barry Flynn, published by The Collins Press, October 2009\n\n"}

{"id": "2265900", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2265900", "title": "Quoit brooch", "text": "Quoit brooch\n\nThe quoit brooch is a type of Anglo-Saxon brooch found from the 5th century and later during the Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain that has given its name to the Quoit Brooch Style to embrace all types of Anglo-Saxon metalwork in the decorative style typical of the finest brooches. The brooches take their modern name from the rings thrown in the game of quoits, and have the form of a broad ring, or circle with an empty centre, usually in bronze or silver (sometimes inlaid with silver or gold respectively), and often highly decorated. The forms are in a very low relief, so contrasting with other early Anglo-Saxon styles, with detail added by shallow engraving or punching within the main shapes. Dots or dashes are often used to represent fur on the animal forms, as well as lines emphasizing parts of the body. They are fixed with a single, straight hinged pin like those of other Anglo-Saxon ring or Celtic brooches and are further defined by the presence of a slot and pin-stops on the ring.\n\nMost scholars now agree that the style developed mainly from provincial late Roman metalwork styles, apparently drawing elements from both the relatively low-status jewellery found in military graves in northern Gaul and England such as belt buckles and fittings, and also late-Roman luxury work such as the style in one bracelet in the very late Roman Hoxne Hoard. In the Quoit Brooch Style the very varied motifs are largely geometrical but include human face-masks and processions or confronted pairs of schematic animals. In most pieces the motifs are tightly packed together in a way lacking classical harmony, but comparable to later Anglo-Saxon work. The style has also been related to late-Roman ring styles in finds such as the Thetford Hoard.\n\nIn late Roman Gaul and Britain \"cingula\" or belts decorated with metal fittings were worn as signs of rank by both soldiers and civilian officials. One theory is that the style was produced by goldsmiths trained in late Roman provincial traditions working for Germanic clients, certainly after and perhaps also before the departure of the Roman legions and the end of Roman rule in Britain in 410 or thereabouts. The style and forms are very different from contemporary continental Germanic ones, and the contexts of the various finds seem to allow for both the possibilities that Germanic owners were adopting some Romano-British cultural habits, and that Romano-British owners of objects were adopting partially Anglo-Saxon ones in the first years of the Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain.\n\nThe discovery of an increasing number of important products of the Quoit Brooch ″school″ in northern France, however, shows that neither the style, nor the forms of jewellery are purely insular developments and that they cannot be linked with any particular ethnic group. An alternative theory has therefore been advanced that they are associated with broadly Germanic, mercenary or federate forces employed in the defence of both southern Britain and northern Gaul in the 5th century, who identified themselves and their status by the creation of innovative metalwork in late Roman tradition.\n\nThe Sarre Brooch, found in the Sarre Anglo-Saxon cemetery at Sarre, Kent in 1863, and now in the British Museum is the best-known example, in a very good state of preservation. It was described by Gale Owen-Crocker as the \"most magnificent example\" of the Quoit brooch style. Two three-dimensional doves sit on the flat circle of the brooch, and another on the head of the pin. In silver with the two zones of animal ornament gilded, it is 7.71 cm across. It was bought by the British Museum in 1893, having once been in the museum of Henry Durden of Blandford. This and a brooch from Howletts, Grave 13 are so similar that they are thought to be from the same workshop, if not the same artist, although several workshops are thought to have worked in the Quoit Brooch Style.\n\nThe brooches, the belt-fittings and the style, are mainly found in high-status burials in southern-eastern England, south of the Thames, and right across northern France, dating from the middle quarters of the 5th century. The British Museum also has a fragment of a brooch similar to the Sarre one from Howletts, Kent, and several belt-fittings in the style from the Anglo-Saxon cemetery at Mucking in Essex, as well as pieces excavated at Chessell Down on the Isle of Wight and Howletts in Kent. The brooch shape survived beyond that, but in a much plainer style.\n\nGiven its limited range in time and place, the style is rare, and one survey in 2000 identified only 5 round brooches (counting style of decoration rather than shape) and a maximum of 39 objects in the style, though the total must be revised upwards in light of the French evidence and in the same year Peter Inker described and illustrated 7 round brooches. One significant addition to the corpus was found near Winchester in 2013 and registered by the Portable Antiquities Scheme. This was a \"large fragment of a 5th century copper alloy scabbard mount with silver inlay\" with a crouching animal, and part of its confronted partner, projecting above a zone with geometric rosettes to form the upper edge of the scabbard.\n\nThe style was identified in the 20th century and initially provoked much debate as to its origins. It is often connected with the Jutes, who Bede said settled in the core area of the finds, and \"barbarian\" continental influences, Germanic and Frankish are often also seen in the style, which has also been called \"Jutish Style A\" by Sonia Hawkes.\n\n"}

They also have a website, and they run a regularly updated blog entitled \"This is Zimbabwe\". The government has imposed very tight restrictions on the media in Zimbabwe, and very few newspapers or radio stations that are critical of the government are permitted to operate. Sokwanele's communications provide a critical and impartial assessment of the government's actions, regularly reporting on corruption, human rights violations and bad governance.\n\nSokwanele closely monitored, in the 22 weeks leading up to the parliamentary elections on 31 March 2005, the government's compliance with the Southern African Development Community (SADC) protocol 'Principles and Guidelines Governing Democratic Elections'. The protocol was agreed by SADC leaders in Mauritius on 17 August 2004 and Zimbabwe was one of the signatories. Sokwanele circulated their weekly assessments through a special newsletter entitled 'Mauritius Watch'. Their final report based on the mounting evidence of non-compliance concluded that the elections were deeply flawed and did not satisfy the SADC principles and guidelines, and therefore could not possibly be considered 'free and fair'. They reached this conclusion before the elections took place.\n\nOn polling day itself, Sokwanele blogged regular updates from activists on the ground who alerted them to unscrupulous government activities which included refusing access to polling agents from the main opposition party, imprisoning MDC agents, incommunicado, after the vote; and controlling all forms of communication to and from the polling stations. They also reported on the difficulty that some voters had in trying to vote, and reports from voters of the presence of dead relatives on the voter's roll. On the basis of this evidence, after the voting was over, Sokwanele went on to produce a report that detailed the hour by hour events on polling day into how they allege the government comprehensively rigged the elections.\n\nMore recently, Sokwanele has written several articles critical of the government's 'Operation Murambatsvina (Operation Drive Out Trash).'

The village is on the Monaro Highway north of Cooma. The village is in the Snowy Monaro Regional Council and had a population of 352 at the .\n\nLocated at the junction of the Bredbo and Murrumbidgee rivers, the Bredbo area was historically prone to flooding. As a way-point on the road from Sydney to the Snowy Mountains, travellers were frequently stranded by rising water. By 1839 the Bredbo Inn had been established to accommodate travellers. The Inn was a Cobb and Co stagecoach post, with stables located behind the Inn which are still standing today.\n\nThe surrounding settlement was developed to support squatters' runs established in the district between 1848 and 1850. Bredbo was officially proclaimed a village in 1888.\n\nGold was discovered in the area by the Reverend William Branwhite Clarke, who also discovered gold at Kiandra. A field was proclaimed along the Bredbo River, which was worked until 1921. In the 1930s a geological survey was undertaken and a mine opened and operated until 1942. The fields at Cowra Creek were worked from 1888 and are still popular for fossicking.\nBredbo sits on the Bombala railway line which reached the town in 1889 at which time there were eight houses. The railway closed in 1989 however one final \"Farewell to Bredbo\" special train was run from Canberra on 3 March 1990.\n\nIn the early 20th century, the Australian poet Banjo Paterson stayed at the Bredbo Inn. It is here that Paterson may have encountered the notable stockman Charlie McKeahnie, a likely source of inspiration for Paterson's epic poem The Man From Snowy River. McKeahnie was renowned for his risky riding, and was eventually killed in a horse race over the Bredbo bridge. Following the accident the fatally wounded McKeahnie was carried to the Inn, where he died of his injuries.\n\nOne of the earliest settlers in the Bredbo district, John Cosgrove of Billilingera, was believed to be the largest landholder in southern New South Wales. In one year 68,000 sheep were shorn in the Billilingera shearing shed.\n\nBredbo has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:\n\nBredbo's community is supported by an active Progress Committee and through a number of activities on the local events calendar. New residents to the village are presented with a Bredbo Welcome Pack, which contains information about the region's history, a copy of the monthly newsletter and useful contact numbers.\n\nBredbo is well located for access to the service town of Cooma and all the resources of Canberra. It is an easy drive from Bredbo to the ski resorts of Perisher Blue, Thredbo and Mt Selwyn. Locals receive discounts at some of these resorts. There are also extensive mountain bike trails and events in the Thredbo area.\n\nThe village hosts a number of small businesses and eateries, including the historic Bredbo Inn, which offers contemporary bistro fare, accommodation and free camping; the green-and-white-striped Pancake Inn, serving pancakes and crepes; Snowy Mountains Gourmet Food, providing daily pies and regional produce; and the Bredbo Pizzeria, where wood-fired pizzas are served.\n\nArt and craft is a growing feature of the community, with a number of creative artists resident in the area. These include the children's label Milli and Max; artist Lucy Culliton; and Canberra-region design collective, The Lost and Found Office. Locally made goods are available in a number of the village shops. Other retailers in the village include the Bredbo Christmas Barn and the Bredbo Aromatic Healing Centre.\n\nA Community Post Office is located in the Snowy Mountains Gourmet Food store. While there is no postal delivery directly to homes in the village, the store is open from 8am to 4pm, 7 days per week.\n\nInternet and phone infrastructure is managed by Telstra. Whilst a high speed fibre optic cable runs through Bredbo, access to cabled internet is limited due to the restricted availability of ports at the local exchange. Various wifi and satellite connections are available through several ISPs, pending connection of the village to the National Broadband Network.\n\nPrimary school aged children are catered for through the Bredbo Public School. The School is a wonderful small school where students receive personal attention and individualized learning, leadership opportunities, a close, safe family culture and numerous interesting other activities. The school is also used as a polling place in state and federal elections. Daily coaches transport high school students directly into Canberra and Cooma.\n\nBredbo also has a community hall, tennis and basketball courts, village green, cemetery, war memorial and recreation ground. Public toilets are located immediately behind the community hall. The Cooma-Monaro library offers a mobile library service.\n\nReligious services are offered through St Bartholomew's Anglican Church, which is located high on a hill with views overlooking the town.

{"id": "2265909", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2265909", "title": "Kingdom of Valencia", "text": "Kingdom of Valencia\n\nThe Kingdom of Valencia (, ; ; ), located in the eastern shore of the Iberian Peninsula, was one of the component realms of the Crown of Aragon. When the Crown of Aragon merged by dynastic union with the Crown of Castile to form the Kingdom of Spain, the Kingdom of Valencia became a component realm of the Spanish monarchy.\n\nThe Kingdom of Valencia was formally created in 1238 when the Moorish taifa of Valencia was taken in the course of the Reconquista. It was dissolved by Philip V of Spain in 1707, by means of the Nueva Planta decrees, as a result of the Spanish War of Succession.\n\nDuring its existence, the Kingdom of Valencia was ruled by the laws and institutions stated in the \"Furs\" (charters) of Valencia which granted it wide self-government under the Crown of Aragon and, later on, under the Spanish Kingdom.\n\nThe boundaries and identity of the present Spanish Autonomous Community of Valencia are essentially those of the former Kingdom of Valencia.\n\nThe conquest of what would later become the Kingdom of Valencia started in 1232 when the king of the Crown of Aragon, James I, called \"Jaume I el Conqueridor\" (the Conqueror), took Morella, mostly with Aragonese troops. Shortly after, in 1233, Borriana and Peniscola were also taken from the بلنسية \"Balansiyya\" (\"Valencia\" in the Arabic language) taifa.\n\nA second and more relevant wave of expansion took place in 1238, when James I defeated the Moors from the Balansiya taifa. He entered the city of Valencia on 9 October 1238, which is regarded as the dawn of the Kingdom of Valencia.\n\nA third phase started in 1243 and ended in 1245, when it met the limits agreed between James I and the heir to the throne of Castile, Alfonso the Wise, who would succeed to the throne as Alfonso X in 1252. These limits were traced in the Treaty of Almizra between the Crown of Castile and the Crown of Aragon, which coordinated their Reconquista efforts to drive the Moors southward by establishing their respectively desired areas of influence. The Treaty of Almizra established the south line of Aragonese expansion in the line formed by the villes of Biar and Busot, today in the north of the Alicante province. Everything south of that line, including what would be the Kingdom of Murcia, was reserved by means of this treaty for Castile.\n\nThe matter of the large majority of \"Mudéjar\" population, left behind from the progressively more southern combat front, lingered from the very beginning until they finally were expelled \"en masse\" in 1609. Up to that moment, they represented a complicated issue for the newly established Kingdom, as they were essential to keep the economy working due to their numbers, which inspired frequent pacts with local Muslim populations, such as Mohammad Abu Abdallah Ben Hudzail al Sahuir, allowing their culture various degrees of tolerance but, on the other side, they were deemed as a menace to the Kingdom due to their lack of allegiance and their real or perceived conspiracies to bring the Ottoman Empire to their rescue.\n\nThere were indeed frequent rebellions from the Moor population against Christian rule, the most threatening being those headed by the Moor chieftain Mohammad Abu Abdallah Ben Hudzail al Sahuir, also known as Al-Azraq. He led important rebellions in 1244, 1248 and 1276. During the first of these, he briefly regained Muslim independence for the lands South of the Júcar, but he had to surrender soon after. During the second revolt, king James I was almost killed in battle, but Al-Azraq also was finally subjugated, his life spared only because of a longtime relationship with the Christian monarch. During the third rebellion, Al-Azraq himself was killed but his son would continue to promote Muslim unrest and local rebellions remained always at sight.\n\nJames II called \"Jaume II el Just\" or the Just, a grandson of James I, initiated in 1296 a final push of his army further southwards than the Biar-Busot pacts. His campaign aimed at the fertile countryside around Murcia and the Vega Baja del Segura whose local Muslim rulers were bound by pacts with Castile and governing by proxy on behalf of this kingdom; Castilian troops often raided the area to assert a sovereignty which, in any case, was not stable but was characterized by the typical skirmishes and ever changing alliances of a frontier territory.\n\nThe campaign under James II was successful to the point of extending the limits of the Kingdom of Valencia well south of the previously agreed border with Castile. His troops took Orihuela and Murcia. What was to become the definite dividing line between Castile and the Crown of Aragon was finally agreed by virtue of the \"Sentencia Arbitral de Torrellas\" (1304), amended by the Treaty of Elche (1305), which assigned Orihuela (also Alicante and Elche) to the Kingdom of Valencia, while Murcia went to the Crown of Castile, so drawing the final Southern border of the Kingdom of Valencia.\n\nAt the end of the process, four taifas had been wiped out: Balansiya, Alpuente, Denia and Murcia. Taking into account the standards of the day, it can be considered as a rather rapid conquest, since most of the territory was gained in less than fifty years and the maximum expansion was completed in less than one century. The toll in terms of social and politic unrest which was to be paid for this fast process was the existence of a large Muslim population within the Kingdom which neither desired to become a part of it nor, as long as they remained Muslim, was given the chance to.\n\nModern historiography sees the conquest of Valencia in the light of similar Reconquista efforts by the Crown of Castile, i.e., as a fight led by the king in order to gain new territories as free as possible of a serfdom subject to the nobility. The new territories would then be accountable only to the king, thus enlarging and consolidating his power versus that of the nobility. This development was part of a growing trend evident in the Middle Ages (said to end in 1492 with the final acts of the Reconquista in the capitulation of Kingdom of Granada and the expulsion of the Jews as well as Christopher Columbus's discovery of the Americas for Spain) and well into the era of Habsburg Spain. It is by this historiographical approach that the repopulation of the Kingdom is assessed today. The Kingdom was initially overwhelmingly populated by Muslims and often subject to popular revolts and the serious threat of subjugation by any Muslim army assembled for this purpose in the Maghreb.\n\nThe process by which the monarchy strove to free itself from any noble guardianship was not an easy one, as the nobility still held a large share of power and was determined to retain as much of it as possible. This fact marked the Christian colonization of the newly acquired territories, governed under the \"Lleis de Repartiments\". Finally the Aragonese nobles were granted several domains, but they managed to obtain only the interior lands, mostly mountainous and sparsely populated parts of the Kingdom of Valencia.\nThe king reserved the fertile and more densely populated lands in the coastal plains for free citizens and the incipient bourgeoisie, whose cities were given the Furs, or royal charters, regulating civil law and administration locally, but holding them always accountable to the king.\n\nThese actions had linguistic consequences:\n\n\nAnother possible primary driving force, but likely to be understated by modern historiography, was religious faith. In this regard, Pope Gregory IX recognized the fight as a Crusade, and James I was known for being a devout king.\n\nThe Kingdom of Valencia achieved its height during the early 15th century. The economy was prosperous and centered around trading through the Mediterranean, which had become increasingly controlled by the Crown of Aragon, mostly from the ports of Valencia and Barcelona.\n\nIn the city of Valencia the \"Taula de canvis\" was created, functioning partly as a bank and partly as a stock exchange market; altogether it boosted trading. The local industry, especially textile manufactures, achieved great development and the city of Valencia turned into a Mediterranean trading emporium where traders from all Europe worked. Perhaps the feature which best symbolises this flamboyant period is the Silk Exchange, one of the finest European examples of civil Gothic architecture and a major trade market in the Mediterranean by the end of the 15th century and throughout the 16th century.\n\nValencia was one of the first cities in Europe to install a movable type printing press as per the designs of Johannes Gutenberg. Valencian authors such as Joanot Martorell or Ausiàs March conformed the canon of classic Valencian literature to the Valencian.\n\nIn 1479, Ferdinand ascended to the throne as King of Aragon. With his earlier marriage to Queen Isabella I of Castile, the modern Kingdom of Spain was born. Valencia began a slow process of integration with the rest of Spain. When Ferdinand and Isabella's grandson Charles came to the throne, the crowns were permanently joined together in personal union. The kings of Habsburg Spain (January 23, 1516 – November 1, 1700) maintained the privileges and liberties of the territories and cities which formed the kingdom and its legal structure and factuality remained intact. A new position, Viceroy of Valencia, was created to manage the officially independent Kingdom.\n\nDuring the 16th century, Valencia lost its status as a preeminent commercial center of Europe to the rapidly developing cities of Northern and Central Europe. Within Spain, the Atlantic trade favored the cities of Andalusia such as Cádiz. This was largely due to diminishing profits from the Mediterranean trade. The Spanish Empire was in frequent conflict with the Ottoman Empire which controlled most of the eastern Mediterranean. They prevented each other from reaching certain ports while Ottoman privateers such as Barbarossa preyed on trade ships. The Barbary pirates such as Dragut, operating out of Tunis, Tripoli, Algiers, Salé and ports in Morocco, attacked shipping in the western Mediterranean, which included destructive raids in Christian ports along the coast. This decline in trade greatly inhibited the economy in Valencia, which had already been economically affected by the Alhambra decree which had expelled the Jews in 1492.\n\nIn 1519, the young King Charles I granted the \"Germanies\" (literally \"brotherhoods\") permission to arm themselves to fight off the Muslim raiders. The \"Germanies\" were artisan guilds who also, at first with the government's permission, served as civilian militias to fight raiding pirates. However, the \"Germanies\" also had an economic agenda favoring the commoner-dominated guilds that clashed with the aristocracy. After the recently appointed Viceroy of Valencia Diego Hurtado de Mendoza refused to seat elected officials who favored the \"Germanies\" in 1520, a full-fledged revolt broke out, the Revolt of the Brotherhoods (\"Revolta de les Germanies\"). It lasted well into 1522, and shared many traits with the contemporaneous Revolt of the Comuneros in Castile. Aside from economic resentment of the aristocracy, the revolt also featured a strong anti-Muslim aspect, as the superstitious populace blamed Muslims for a plague that struck the city. The \"mudéjars\" (Muslims) were seen as allies of the aristocracy, as they worked in the nobility's large farms and undercut the Valencians on wages making them competitors for scarce jobs. During the revolt, the agermanats killed many Muslims and forcibly baptized the rest. Even after the \"Germanies\" were suppressed it was ruled that these baptisms were valid, sparking a new revolt of the Moriscos (Muslim \"converts\").\nBecause of the exhausted forces left after clashes between the nobles and their allies in the high bourgeoisie versus the general populace and the lesser bourgeoisie, the king was able to use the power vacuum to enlarge his share of power and gradually diminish that of the local authorities. This meant that his requests for money in order to enlarge or consolidate the disputed possessions in Europe were progressively more frequent, more imperative and, conversely, less reciprocated for the Kingdom of Valencia, just as they were elsewhere for the rest of the Spanish Kingdom territories.\n\nThe expulsion of the Moriscos in 1609 was the final blow for the economy of the Kingdom of Valencia, as thousands of people—mostly peasants serving the nobility—were forced to leave; in the process, entire villages were deserted and the countryside lost its main labor force. Some 125,000 people are supposed to have left the land. The expulsion was broadly welcome within the Valencian citizenry, especially for its more popular segments. The expulsion meant the loss of a cheap labor force for the nobility, and consequently a massive socio-economic destabilisation. The nobles together with the upper class bourgeoisie felt threatened by an increasingly self-confident general populace, and sought the king's protection of their privileges. As a concession to the monarchy, they had to gradually relinquish their check and balance role on its power, which had been one of the distinguishing traits of the Kingdom's autonomy before the Crown. In line with similar processes in other parts of feudal Europe, the power vacuum left by rapid socio-economic change was readily filled by an increasingly emboldened monarchy.\n\nThe Kingdom of Valencia as a legal and political entity was finally ended in 1707 as a result of the Spanish War of Succession. The local population mostly took the side of and provided troops and resources for Archduke Charles, the pretender who was arguably to maintain the legal status quo. His utter defeat at the Battle of Almansa, near the borders of the Kingdom of Valencia, meant its legal and political termination, along with other autonomous parliaments in the Crown of Aragon, as the Nueva Planta Decrees were passed and the new King Philip V of Spain of the House of Bourbon created a centralized Spain.\n\n\n"}

He was educated in Paris and at Trinity College, Cambridge where he read mathematics (Junior Optime BA 1889, MA 1893). In 1891 he went to the Royal Statistical Society as assistant secretary and sub-editor of its journal. In 1895 he joined the Statistical Branch of the Board of Agriculture; he remained with the Board, later renamed the Ministry of Agriculture, until his retirement in 1927. He married Olive Marion Rücker (1878–1933) in 1911 and they had three sons and a daughter.\n\nHooker was a pioneer in applying correlation analysis to socio-economic data. He worked very closely with his friend Udny Yule, who had developed some of the basic theory and was interested in the same kind of applications. Yule recalled how Hooker \"joined with me in the early days of our acquaintance to form a very select Statistical Dining Club of two members, which met fairly regularly after meetings of the Society.\" In the preface to the \"Introduction to the Theory of Statistics\" Yule gave fulsome thanks to Hooker for his help. In 1907 Hooker published a paper on weather and crops which Ronald Fisher later described as \"magnificent\". Hooker subsequently wrote a number of papers on meteorology. In 1920 1921 he served as President of the Royal Meteorological Society. He was a very effective president, as Dines recalled.\n\nLike his contemporary and fellow civil servant, W. F. Sheppard, Hooker was an out-of hours statistician. Although his researches were connected with food and agriculture, he did not carry them out as part of his official duties. Indeed, Yule commented, \"The importance and value of Hooker’s scientific work ... was never, in my opinion, appreciated at its proper worth by the Ministry at the time when he was still in its service.\" Yule also noted that, when Hooker retired, he chose to live \"far away from any thoughts of the Ministry.\" In his obituary Dines noted that meteorologists had not followed up Hooker’s work on weather and crops. Hooker is chiefly remembered today for the pioneering work on time series analysis in his papers of 1901-5.\n\nThe bibliography in Yule's obituary lists 22 papers of which the following are a sample.\n\n\n\nFor information about the Hooker family see\nAs a baby RHH was quite poorly and his father and Darwin exchanged anxious letters over his health\n"}

She assisted in founding and led several nationally known societies for social reform during and following the Civil War.\n\nShe grew up in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in a Quaker family. Her father, Isaac Hopper, opposed slavery (as did many among Quakers by then) and aided fugitive slaves. She grew to share her father's beliefs and spent much of her life working for social reform in several fields. In 1841, the New York Monthly Meeting disowned Gibbons' father and husband for their anti-slavery writing. Abigail Gibbons resigned the following year, also removing her minor children.\n\nGibbons was prominent during and after the American Civil War. Her work in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Washington, D.C.; and New York City, New York, was for civil rights and education for blacks, prison reform for women, medical care for Union officers during the war, aid to veterans returning from the war, to help them find work; and welfare. Because Gibbons was a known abolitionist, her house had been among those attacked and destroyed during the New York City draft riots of July 1863.\n\nAbigail Hopper was born in Philadelphia in 1801, the third of ten children. She was informally called Abby. Both her parents were proud abolitionists. Her father, Isaac Tatem Hopper, was of the Hicksite branch of Quakers. Her mother, Sarah Tatum Hopper, became a recommended minister for the Society of Friends and oversaw schools for black children, along with a committee.\n\nPennsylvania had abolished slavery and many free people of color lived in Philadelphia. Her father became an active and leading member of The Pennsylvania Abolition Society. He often directly confronted slave kidnappers, who frequented Philadelphia and sometimes kidnapped free blacks for sale into slavery, as well as capturing fugitive slaves to return to their masters for bounties. Called upon to protect the rights of African Americans, Isaac Hopper and his wife garnered a reputation as friends and advisers of the \"oppressed race\" in all emergencies. The Hoppers also sheltered many poor Quakers in their house, despite their own family's large size and the father's unstable financial status. From their early years, their children were called to aid others.\n\nBoth of Hopper's parents came from historically Quaker families and reared their children in that religion. Hopper and her siblings attended Friends' schools while growing up, and lived with these beliefs. In 1821, she also founded a school that practiced Quaker beliefs. In 1830, Hopper moved to New York and became a teacher at a Quaker school.\n\nAbigail grew up to share her parents' abolitionist sentiments. She worked with well-known abolitionists of her time, including Lydia Maria Child, Sarah Moore Grimké, William Lloyd Garrison, and Theodore Dwight Weld. Hopper joined the Manhattan Anti-Slavery Society in 1841, which was then a predominately African-American organization in membership. It protested all-white memberships of other abolition societies, including the Ladies' New York City Anti-Slavery Society.\n\nOn February 14, 1833, Abigail Hopper married James Sloan Gibbons, a fellow Hicksite Quaker from New York, who was also an ardent abolitionist. In 1836, the couple moved to New York City. They had six children together—William, Sarah, Julia, Lucy, Isaac, and James. Isaac and James died in infancy. A third son died suddenly after an accident while he was attending Harvard University. Their daughters included Sarah Emerson Gibbons, who published an edited collection of her mother's letters and a short biography of her; and Lucy Gibbons (who married a Mr. Morse and had a family).\n\nSome Quaker yearly meetings divided due to influences from Deism, as well as differences between urban and rural members. In 1841, the New York Monthly Meeting, which was dominated by Hicksites, disowned Abigail's father Isaac Hopper and her husband James Sloan Gibbons for their writing and other activities against slavery. The following year Abigail Hopper Gibbons resigned from the Meeting in protest, also removing her and James' four minor children. She and her family maintained Quaker practices and faith but did not rejoin the Meeting.\n\nGibbons became involved in a variety of social reform movements. For twelve years in New York, she was also president of a German industrial school for street children. In 1845, she and her father founded the Women's Prison Association (WPA) of New York City. She lobbied the city government for improvements in the city's prisons, advocated the hiring of police matrons, and urged the construction of separate prisons for women. They were then housed in the same facilities as men, and at risk of abuses. She frequently visited the various prisons in and about New York.\n\nUnder her leadership, in 1853 the Women's Prison Association separated from its parent, the Prison Association, and Gibbons obtained a New York State charter for her group. She led an aggressive program of legislative lobbying at the city and state level to improve prison conditions for women. She protested jail overcrowding and demanded that women prisoners be searched only by female matrons. She also believed that it would be beneficial for her proposed female prisons to be run by women as well.\n\nWith the outbreak of the American Civil War, Gibbons knew that nurses would be needed to care for the wounded. The United States Sanitary Commission was established in 1861, shortly after the Civil War began, to recruit nurses and to provide adequate medical care to the Union wounded. It would undertake numerous fundraising efforts to raise money for these purposes. When the Commission set up a training base at David's Island Hospital in New York, Gibbons was among the trainees.\n\nIn the South, she worked closely with contraband slaves who supported the Union's effort. These formerly enslaved people had often sought refuge near Union troops. Hopper helped them with childbirth and other familial issues. She also collected donations from those in the North and gave them to the contraband slaves. Additionally, she used her wages to help pay for medical expenses encountered by patients who resided in a contraband camp.\n\nGibbons traveled to Washington D.C., to help at the Washington Office Hospital, where she aided wounded officers and distributed supplies. She also helped to establish two field hospitals in Virginia. At Point Lookout, Maryland, the federal government took over a hotel and 100 guest cottages, converting them into a hospital complex with accommodations for 1500 soldiers. It was named Hammond General Hospital. Gibbons vied with Dorothea Dix, the Union Superintendent of Nurses, for control of the hospital. She finally gained an appointment as its head matron. In 1863 she left the facility after the hospital was adapted for use as the Point Lookout Confederate Prison.\n\nIn New York City, social tensions increased with the imposition of the draft. Many Irish immigrant working men did not support the war or abolition of slavery; they resented being drafted when wealthier men could pay for substitutes to take their places. With the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863, they feared more job competition by blacks and the loss of work or being driven to lower wages. During the New York Draft Riots, ethnic Irish led mob attacks against individual blacks, their residences, and businesses, as well as against the Colored Orphan Asylum, in the largest civil insurrection in United States history. (The orphans were saved but the building burned. The rioters also attacked residences of known white abolitionists and prominent Republicans. On Tuesday, July 14, 1863, the Gibbons' Manhattan home at 19 Lamartine Place (now 339 West 29th Street) was burned and destroyed by rioters.\n\nFollowing the war, Gibbons founded the Labor and Aid Society in New York, which aided returning veterans find work. To further her mission with women prisoners, she co-founded The Isaac T. Hopper Home, named for her father. It assisted former women prisoners to integrate into society after their release. As a result of her working on notable social reform movements, Gibbons corresponded with other nationally prominent leaders, including Lydia Maria Child, Joseph H. Choate, and Theodore Roosevelt, .\n\nHer concern for women and children led Gibbons to found the New York Diet Kitchen (to serve infants, the elderly and the poor). She had also served as president of the New York Committee for the Prevention and Regulation of Vice, directed to control prostitution, drinking and gambling.\n\nGibbons died of pneumonia in New York in 1893, aged 91. She was eulogized in her obituary as \"one of the most remarkable women of the century\" for her work in noted reform movements. She is interred at Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York.\n\n\n\n"}

Henry VIII, on becoming the recipient of these monies had had them carefully valued and specified as sums of money. This valuation was never revised, and in 1920 the income from First Fruits and Tenths was between £15,000 and £16,000.\n\nThe bounty money was to be used to increase the income of livings yielding less than £80 a year. It was not paid directly to incumbents, but instead used to purchase land (generally £200-worth), the income from which augmented the living. The livings to be augmented were selected by lot from those with an annual income less than £10, or (in the early years of the bounty) those where augmentation by a third party was offered conditional upon augmentation by bounty funds. Parishes worth less than £20 a year were included in the ballot in 1747, those worth less than £30 a year in 1788, those under £50 in 1810.\n\nAugmented parishes came to find it more convenient to not actually purchase land, but to leave the purchase money deposited with the bounty, who paid a guaranteed but moderate rate of interest. The money held by the bounty was invested at higher rates of interest, the difference between interest paid the bounty on their investments, and that paid by the bounty to parishes going to meet the running costs of the bounty and to increase the funds available for augmentation. In 1829 the purchase money deposited with the bounty amounted to over £1m, which was invested in bank annuities (financial instruments of fluctuating value, then worth over £1.3m); by 1900 the bounty was holding over £7m credited to various augmented livings.\n\nThe original (first fruits and tenths) income and that from interest rate differences on money on deposit with the bounty, had by 1815 allowed the allocation of nearly £1.5m of capital (securing nearly £0.5m of third-party benefactions) to augment the income of 3,300 livings. To accelerate augmentation, between 1809 and 1820 Parliament made annual grants to the bounty of £100,000; £1.1m in total. As a result, by 1824 all livings under £30 a year had been augmented and there were funds in hand to permit the augmentation of all livings worth under £50 a year. By 1841, it was estimated, the operations of the bounty (discounting the effects of the Parliamentary grants of 1809-20) had secured additional church income over ten times that of the first fruits and tenths.\n\nThe Ecclesiastical Commission reported (1836) the following data on low-income livings:\n\nAfter 1836, bounty augmentations were generally to match third party benefactions to livings worth less than £200 a year. In 1890, the total amount distributed was £176,896.\n\nOn 2 April 1947, by the Church Commissioners Measure 1947, the functions and assets of Queen Anne's Bounty were merged with the Ecclesiastical Commissioners to form the Church Commissioners.\nThe archives of Queen Anne's Bounty are now held by the Church of England Record Centre; specific documents may be consulted by appointment.\n\n\n"}

He is known for his detailed line work and muted color palette, and is a much sought-after cover artist, having done extensive cover work for many other books, such as various \"Star Wars\" series from Dark Horse Comics.\n\nCharest was born in 1969. He began drawing at as a child, attributing his artistic interest his mother, who he says, like he and his sister, also has artistic talent. Charest grew up on farm in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.\n\nCharest cites Mike Mignola, Adam Hughes and Brian Bolland among his artistic influences, as well as many artists from the early 20th century.\n\nBecause he grew up on a farm, Charest was isolated from the comics industry, and says the main reason he eventually turned to comics as a profession was because he could draw, having been through a number of dead-end jobs before deciding that comics was his calling. After sending samples to DC Comics, he was offered his first comics job, a Flash story in \"Showcase '93\" #3 (March 1993). He followed that with another Flash story in \"Flash Annual\" #5 (August 1992), which he calls \"my first real thing\", and then a story focusing on an arm wrestling match between the Hulk and the Thing written by Peter David in \"Incredible Hulk Annual\" #18.\n\nHe later became the regular artist on \"Darkstars\" for issues 4 - 7. He also produced cover work for other DC titles such as \"The Outsiders\", \"Batman\", and \"Detective Comics\".\n\nCharest was then contacted by publisher Jim Lee, who offered him work for Wildstorm Productions. Charest's first work for that studio was a pinup that appeared in \"WildC.A.T.s\" #0 (June 1993). Later that same year, he illustrated \"WildC.A.T.s Special #1\" (November 1993). He subsequently illustrated back-up stories featuring Voodoo and Warblade in issues 8 and 9 of the regular series (February and March, 1994). He became the regular artist of the series with issue #15, illustrating the title during the runs of writers James Robinson and Alan Moore. His last regular issue was #31 (September 1996), though he later returned to illustrate the title's 50th issue (June 1998).\n\nIn 1999, Charest joined writer Scott Lobdell on a second series of \"Wildcats\", illustrating five of the first six issues. He subsequently moved to Paris to illustrate a \"Metabarons\" graphic novel for French \"bande dessinee\" publisher Humanoïdes Associés. With plans to paint the entire graphic novel, the progress on the book went much more slowly than Charest had anticipated, and he illustrated only the first 29 pages of the book. Humanoid Publishing selected Serbian artist Zoran Janjetov, who previously worked in the same Alejandro Jodorowsky Incal universe on \"John Defaul\" and \"Technopriests\", to complete the art chores for the project.\n\nBy 2007 Charest had moved back to the United States, settling in California. Among his works are cover art for David Morrell's \"Captain America: The Chosen\" mini-series. He has also been running the free webcomic strip \"Spacegirl\" on his MSN group. In 2008, a limited edition printed volume hardcover of \"Spacegirl\" was self-published by Charest and Big Wow Art, collecting the first 56 strips of the series.\n\nCharest usually prefers not to employ preliminary sketching practices, such as layouts, thumbnails or lightboxing, in part due to impatience, and in part because he enjoys the serendipitous nature in which artwork develops when produced with greater spontaneity. He also prefers to use reference only when rendering objects that require a degree of real-life accuracy, such as guns, vehicles or characters of licensed properties that must resemble actors with whom they are closely identified, as when he illustrated the cover to \"\" in 2000.\n\nCharest previously illustrated on regular illustration board provided by publishers, though he disliked the non-photo blue lines printed on them. By 2000, he switched to Crescent board for all his work, because it does not warp when wet, produces sharper illustrations, and is more suitable for framing because it lacks the non-photo blue lines.\n\nCharest uses mainly 2H lead to avoid smearing, and sometimes HB lead. For ink wash, he uses Rapidograph ink, and waters it down to three hues in order to achieve light gray, medium and charcoal tones, in addition to straight black. He applies the wash with watercolor brushes of various sizes. To ink linework he uses Rapidographs of all sizes. For color work, Charest uses Aquarelle watercolor pencils and acrylic paint for airbrush work. He also uses white Pelikan ink for additional effects such as highlights, fades and blends. Charest stated in 2000 that while he did not use a computer for his artwork, he would be using one soon, and anticipated they would be a necessity for professional artists.\n\nAccording to Charest, the time he needs to finish a given page varies, depending on how fast his editor needs it, and what he is being paid, though because he came to prefer producing artwork that takes longer than the norm to complete by the time he left Wildstorm, he no longer finds it feasible to be the regular artist on a monthly series. He points to \"WildC.A.T.s/X-Men: The Golden Age\" as an example of a book that took him considerable time (under a year), though he stresses that he finished it on time.\n\nCharest's work has influenced artists such as Chrissie Zullo and Shelby Robertson. \n\nAs of 1995, Charest was living in San Diego, California.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Thus it was a payment for distinct rights that were connected with the full enjoyment of the land but not parcelled up in the ownership of the land. Formally it was a sort of buy-back rather than a tax. A tax can be varied by the taxer; and if not paid there are penalties that can be varied by the taxer without formal limit. In contrast the only sanction for not paying a feudal quit rent was that the alternative burdens would return. This imposed a ceiling on how much could be demanded in payment of a quit rent. Where the sanctions for non-compliance are limited in this way, a quit rent is a rent in form and name, and not a tax; where they are not so limited, a quit rent is a rent only in form and name, being rather a tax. The latter is the usual case today, as the former was in earlier times.\n\nIn post-feudal times, quit rents have continued to be imposed by some governments, usually attached to land grants as a form of land tax.\n\nThe quit rent system was used frequently by colonial governments in the British Empire. Many land grants in colonial America in the 17th and 18th centuries carried quit rent. Quit rents went on to be used in British colonies, protectorates, etc. in Asia and elsewhere in the 19th and 20th centuries. For example, in British North Borneo, Proclamation IX of 1902 made it a legal requirement for natives who claimed to own cultivated lands to take out separate land titles for themselves, charged at $2.00 per title with owners made to pay annual quit rent.\n\nSome governments have now abolished the quit rent system and relieved those with a nominal quit rent obligation from the requirement to pay it, replacing quit rents with a uniform system of land tax. However, in other countries, such as Malaysia, quit rent remains an important means of raising revenue from landowners.\n\n"}

Those with primarily secular names (such as royal, geographical or adjectival names) usually had additionally a religious name (\"Avocación\" or \"alias\"), which is listed below in the second column where known. \n\nAn asterisk (*) in the \"Launch date\" column indicates the date of acquisition (purchase or capture) for vessels not built for the Spanish Navy.\nDuring the 17th century, and for much of the first half of the 18th century, the term 'frigate' (or 'fragata' in Spanish) encompassed ships with two complete gundecks rated at about 50 guns as well as smaller single-decked vessels. The smaller frigates evolved from the fast and lightly-armed vessels built chiefly on the coast of (Spanish) Flanders, and employed in the English Channel and southern North Sea, as well as escorting the trade routes from the Spanish Netherlands to the north coast of Spain.\n\nThe post-Napoleonic era began with the acquisition of six frigates from Russia in 1818.

Towards western Swiss Plateau, the Bise is pressed between the Jura mountains and Pre-Alps whereby it strengthens and mostly climaxes on the western shore of Lake Geneva. In summer, the Bise wind causes rather dry and sunny weather whereas in winter, it frequently forms low stratus clouds over the Swiss Plateau by strengthening the inversion layer.\n\nThe Bise can sometimes lead to severe icing during winter months in Geneva and nearby communities. Many foreign travellers to this Swiss city have commented upon the Bise.\n\nThe strength of the Bise wind can be determined by the analysis of the air pressure difference (in hectopascal [hPa]) between Geneva and Güttingen in canton of Thurgau. The Bise arises as soon as the air pressure in Güttingen (TG) is higher than in Geneva. The greater this air pressure difference, the stronger the Bise blows through the Swiss Plateau. In case of an inverted air pressure difference (low air pressure in Güttingen (TG) and high air pressure in Geneva), the opposite of Bise occurs: The wind blows from southwest through the Swiss Plateau.\n\nAn alternative form in English is Biz. The term entered Middle English from French \"bise\". Its origin is unknown.\n\nThe wind Le Bise, along with Lake Geneva, is also mentioned in the song \"Lonely Sky\" which was penned and sung by the Irish singer Chris De Burgh. The song was released in 1975 on the album \"Spanish Train and Other Stories\".\n"}
{"id": "2265991", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2265991", "title": "Captains Flat", "text": "Captains Flat\n\nCaptains Flat is a town in the Southern Tablelands of rural New South Wales, Australia, in Queanbeyan-Palerang Regional Council. It is south of Queanbeyan. Captains Flat township is bounded by the non-urban parts of the locality of Captains Flat in the north, east and west, and Captains Flat Road, the Molonglo River and Foxlow Street in the south.\n\nIt is suggested the town took its name from a white bullock named \"Captain\" that would slip away from Foxlow station, 12 km away, to graze grassy flatlands near the Molonglo River.\n\nThe area was originally inhabited by Ngarigo Aboriginal people prior to European settlement. The town formed as a result of mining for gold, silver, lead, zinc, copper and iron pyrites in the hills surrounding the upper reaches of the Molonglo River. The town boomed from 1881 to 1899 then went into a rapid decline until 1939 when rail access revived mining activity for another 23 years.\nCopper was found in the area in 1874 by J.E. Wright of Foxlow station. The Molonglo goldfield was declared in 1882 and mining for gold and silver commenced at two mines, Koh-i-noor and Commodore, which were operated by two mining companies. Two blast furnaces were built in 1885. The two companies merged in 1894 and formed the Lake George United Mining and Smelting Company. Up to that time the mines had produced mainly copper with some silver and a small amount of gold. Processing was made harder because of the presence of zinc. To convey ore to the bins at the smelter, the company built a 2 ft (610mm) tramway in 1897. Trains of small 4-wheel dump cars were hauled by a Krauss steam locomotive. The tramway appears to have closed about 1902. In the early twentieth century the mine produced gold and copper. Mining activity ceased in 1920.\n\nThe impact on European markets due to World War II meant mining operations were subsidised by the government through power and freight concessions as the foreign revenue was seen as important to the Australian economy. In 1940, 550 people were employed and the local population was 1700. The mining company, Lake George Mines, built 152 fibro cottages for married miners, a hostel for single men and some of the population lived in tents. The company also built a theatre, hospital, tennis courts and a swimming pool, and paid for the medical staff, the provision of street lighting, electricity and water.\n\nIn the 1930s and 1940s many of the old buildings were replaced including the hotel. The new hotel built in 1938 was said to have the longest bar in Australia at the time; it was 32 metres long.\n\nThere were some significant labour strikes by the miners in the 1940s and 1950s. The strike of 1948/49 and the lockout of 1954/55 both lasted for seven months. The mine closed on 11 March 1962 due to the lack of viable ore. To that point men had worked in tunnels extending 840 metres (2,800 feet) below the ground. The first strike started by a local miner named T.B. Hutchinson who fed up with the constant physical stress caused hazardous materials, threw down his miners bucket hat onto the floor in front of the visiting owner H.Wood causing a localised riot within the zinc mine.\n\nFrom 1939 to 1962 just over 4 million tonnes of ore was extracted containing 1.5 million tonnes of concentrates: 39% of which were zinc, 33% pyrites, 24% lead, 5% copper, and small amounts of gold (2850 tonnes) and silver (155 tonnes). Immediately after the closure the Lake George Mines dismantled and sold the infrastructure including removing many of the cottages.\n\nThe impact of sulphur and acid rain produced by the smelting has resulted in the area around the mines having a stark and somewhat alien landscape reminiscent of Queenstown in Tasmania.\n\nIn 1939 and 1942 mine tailings and slime dams collapsed into the Molonglo River. The resulting pollution severely damaged the ecological communities of the Molonglo River downstream from the mine site, and eradicated all native fish populations. Despite Federal and NSW government funded remediation programs of $2.5m in 1976, toxic leachates still enter the river from the Captains Flat mine site. The remediation works covered the waste dumps with impermeable clay and vegetation designed to reduce the risk of catastrophic failure of the dumps. The owners of the mine were not held accountable for the pollution and did not contribute to the remediation of the environmental impact. A large stretch of the Molonglo is still devoid of native fish and awaits their re-establishment.\n\nProspecting has commenced in the area again, begun by Monaro Mining (later known as Australian-American Mining, then AusROC Metals Ltd) and taken over by Ironbark Gold.\n\nThe Captains Flat Weather Radar is the main weather radar for the ACT and the southern coast and tablelands of NSW. It is a WSR-74S type radar operated by the Bureau of Meteorology, mounted on a 22.35m tower on Mt Cowangerong.\n\n\n"}

He is most well known for his involvement with the Mariposa Battalion, the first non-Indians to enter Yosemite Valley, and his book Discovery of the Yosemite and the Indian War of 1851. Bunnell led the battalion members in a vote to name the valley, and for this reason he is often credited as the person who named Yosemite. He was also a soldier and surgeon in the United States war with Mexico and the Civil War.\n\nBunnell was born in Rochester, New York on March 13, 1824. His father was Dr. Bradley Bunnell, and his uncle Dr. Douglass Houghton was a major influence on young Lafayette, especially instilling in him a desire to seek adventure in \"the West.\" In 1832 Bunnell's father Bradley decided to move to Detroit, although the family stayed over in Buffalo prior to the final move; because of a cholera epidemic, Bradley Bunnell was called on to treat the sick. When they did finally settle in Detroit, young Bunnell was friends with the Ojibwe, Potowatami and French-Canadian youth. He attended a catholic school, not because he was catholic but because it was the best school in the town.\n\nIn 1845 Bunnell's father returned to Detroit. After settling various business affairs, Bunnell followed him and recommenced studying medicine under Dr. Scoville. When the War with Mexico broke out, Bunnell enlisted and worked as an orderly. For a while he was in charge of the hospital in Cordova, and had medical command of a regiment when they returned to Michigan at the end of the war. After being mustered out, rumors of the gold strike in California were confirmed by President Polk, and Bunnell decided to seek his fortune in California. He traveled overland by way of Texas and Mexico.\n\nIn 1851, Bunnell was a member of the Mariposa Battalion that became the non-indigenous discoverers of the Yosemite Valley. Discovery was not the main purpose of the trip: the Battalion rode out in search of Native American tribal leaders involved in recent raids on American settlements. Bunnell explored the Valley and named many of its features. \"Discovery of the Yosemite, and the Indian war of 1851\" (1880) contains his account of his exploration and the actions of the Battalion. The majority of what is known about Chief Tenaya and the Ahwahnechee was from Bunnell's written accounts. Bunnell was the first person who encountered Chief Tenaya who subsequently wrote a book.\n\nBunnell later served as a surgeon in the American Civil War. After the war he moved to Homer, Minnesota and married Sarah Smith. Although he practiced medicine a little, for the most part he lived off his army pensions and wrote histories of the upper Mississippi. He died in Homer on July 21, 1903.\n\nBunnell Point at the east end of Little Yosemite Valley is named in his honour.\n\n\n\n"}

Yi Sun-sin and Won Gyun's fleet destroyed an anchored Japanese transport fleet. A day later, after destroying an additional 18 Japanese transports in nearby waters, Yi Sun-sin and Won Gyun parted ways and returned to their home ports after receiving news of the fall of Hanseong.\n\nThe Japanese invasion of Korea began with the arrival of 400 transports bearing 18,700 men under the command of Konishi Yukinaga on 23 May 1592 for the Siege of Busanjin. Over the next several weeks, the Japanese fleet ferried Toyotomi Hideyoshi's invasion force of 158,000 men to the Busan area, and the Japanese armies had advanced rapidly northward, and had seized the Korean capital of Hanseong by 16 June. As the Japanese now prepared to advance further north, logistics became an issue, and Japanese transports began exploring further up the west coast of the Korean peninsula as it was not practical to carry large amounts of supplies overland given the rough terrain and poor state of the roads.\n\nAt the time of the invasion, the Korean naval forces were divided into regional commands. Panicking after the fall of Busan to the Japanese, Gyeongsang Left Navy Commander Bak Hong ordered his weapons and stores destroyed, and scuttled his fleet of 100 warships without giving combat. Likewise, after the fall of Dongnae, Gyeongsang Right Navy Commander Won Gyun attempted to withdraw his ships to Hansando but mistook a bunch of fishing ships for the Japanese fleet. He proceeded to destroy his weapons and stores, and to scuttle his fleet. He was dissuaded from deserting his command by his subordinates, by which time he had only four vessels remaining. Won Gyun called on Yi Sun-sin for assistance; however, as commander of the Cholla Left Navy, he was not allowed to leave his region without permission from his superiors. Yi also have a number of other reasons to delay. He needed to acquire charts of the rocky coastal waters of Gyeongsang Province for his fleet to navigate safely, and he was also uncertain of the discipline of the men under his command and was forced to execute deserters to set an example, including on 12 June, the day Hanseong fell to the Japanese. Yi Sun-sin had hoped to combine his forces with that of Cholla Right Navy Commander Yi Eokgi; however, when orders came from the capital, he was ordered to combine with the now non-existent forces of Wong Gyun instead. With Wong Guys remaining four vessels, Yi Sun-sin had 39 warships under his command (24 large \"panokseon\" and 15 smaller \"hyeupson\") and 46 smaller open boats.\n\nYi Sun-sin and Won Gyun arrived near Geojedo on 16 June a scouting vessel alerted them to the presence of Japanese ships anchored at the port of Okpo\n\nYi Sun-sin's fleet approached Okpo on 17 June. Yi's flagship was in the center of a line with the other heavy warships in the center and light vessels to the left and right, and Won Gyun lingering at the rear of the formation. When they entered the harbor they found more than 50 Japanese transport ships, mostly unmanned, and the crews looting in the village in direct violation of Hideyoshi's orders not to commit acts of looting, massacre or other actions to alienate the Korean civilians . Due to smoke around Okpo, the Japanese did not notice the arrival of the Korean fleet until it was upon them, panicked. Some fled into the hills whiles others tried to flee aboard their ships, but those that did were surrounded and hemmed into the port. The Japanese tried to fight back with their firearms but the arquebus, while effective on land, did little damage to the thick wooden hulls of the Korean warships. Yi Sun-sin proceeded to bombard the trapped Japanese transports with his cannon and fire arrows until they abandoned ship. In total 26 transports were destroyed during the bombardment. The Koreans suffered three injuries, and two of them were from friendly fire. \n\nYi Sun-sin resisted the impulse to land his men and to pursue the surviving Japanese on the island, as the risk was great and such an action would leave his fleet undermanned and vulnerable. When a group of Yi Sun-sin's men seized a Japanese ship, Won Gyun's ships fired on them, mistaking them for enemies.\n\nAfter the battle Yi Sun-sin immediately received news of five other Japanese ships within their vicinity and gave chase. The Japanese fled to Happo harbor and abandoned their ships, which Yi ordered to be burned. \n\nSoon after sunrise on 17 June, Yi Sun-sin received news of another 13 Japanese ships nearby and on setting sail, found the Japanese transports at Jeokjinpo. As at Okpo, the Japanese were engaged in looting and burning the village. However, unlike Okpo, the Japanese did not give battle, but fled inland while their ships were looted and then burned. Enraged by the looting and encouraged by the ease of their success, Yi Sun-sin and Won Gyun briefly considering continuing on to Busan to attack the main Japanese fleet. However, word come of the fall of Hanseong eight days before, and Yi Sun-sin and Won Gyun decided to part ways and return to their home ports. Yi Sun-sin arrived back at Yeosu on 18 June, from which he wrote a long report to the court.\n\n\n"}

Along with Karl Barth, he is commonly associated with neo-orthodoxy or the dialectical theology movement.\n\nBrunner was born on 23 December 1889 in Winterthur, in the Swiss canton of Zürich.\n\nHe studied at the universities of Zurich and Berlin, receiving his doctorate in theology from Zurich in 1913, with a dissertation on \"The Symbolic Element in Religious Knowledge\". Brunner served as pastor from 1916 to 1924 in the mountain village of Obstalden in the Swiss canton of Glarus. In 1919–1920 he spent a year in the United States studying at Union Theological Seminary in New York.\n\nIn 1921, Brunner published his \"Habilitationsschrift\" (a post-doctoral dissertation traditionally required in many countries in order to attain the position of a fully tenured professor) on \"Experience, Knowledge and Faith\" and in 1922 was appointed a \"Privatdozent\" at the University of Zurich. Soon after, another book followed: \"Mysticism and the Word\" (1924), a critique of the liberal theology of Friedrich Schleiermacher. In 1924 Brunner was appointed Professor of Systematic and Practical Theology at the University of Zurich, a post which he held until his retirement in 1953. In 1927 he published \"The Philosophy of Religion from the Standpoint of Protestant Theology\" and second \"The Mediator\".\n\nAfter accepting various invitations to deliver lectures across Europe and the United States, in 1930 Brunner published \"God and Man \" and in 1932 \"The Divine Imperative.\" Brunner continued his theological output with \"Man in Revolt\" and \"Truth as Encounter\" in 1937. In the same year he was a substantial contributor to the World Conference on Church, Community, and State in Oxford, a position which was reflected in his continued involvement in the ecumenical movement. In 1937–1938 he returned to the United States for a year as a visiting professor at Princeton Theological Seminary.\n\nBrunner's ecclesiastical positions varied at differing points in his career. Before the outbreak of the war Brunner returned to Europe with the young Scottish theologian Thomas F. Torrance who had studied under Karl Barth in Basel and who had been teaching at Auburn Theological Seminary, New York (and who would subsequently go on to distinguish himself as a professor at the University of Edinburgh). Following the war, Brunner delivered the prestigious Gifford Lectures at the University of St Andrews, Scotland, in 1946–1947 on \"Christianity and Civilisation.\" In 1953 he retired from his post at the University of Zurich and took up a position of Visiting Professor at the recently founded International Christian University in Tokyo, Japan (1953–1955), but not before the publication of the first two volumes of his three-volume \"magnum opus\" \"Dogmatics\" (volume one: \"The Christian Doctrine of God\" [1946], volume two: \"The Christian Doctrine of Creation and Redemption\" [1950], and volume three: \"The Christian Doctrine of the Church, Faith, and Consummation\" [1960]). While returning to Europe from Japan, Brunner suffered a cerebral haemorrhage and was physically impaired, weakening his ability to work. Though there were times when his condition would improve, he suffered further strokes, finally dying on 6 April 1966 in Zürich.\n\nBrunner holds a place of prominence in Protestant theology in the 20th century and was one of the four or five leading systematicians.\n\nBrunner rejected liberal theology's portrait of Jesus as merely a highly respected human being. Instead, Brunner insisted that Jesus was God incarnate and central to salvation.\n\nSome claim that Brunner also attempted to find a middle position within the ongoing Arminian and Calvinist debate, stating that Christ stood between God's sovereign approach to mankind and free human acceptance of God's gift of salvation. However, Brunner was a Protestant theologian from German-speaking Europe (a heritage which did not lay nearly as much weight on the Calvinist–Arminian controversy as Dutch- or English-speaking theology). Thus, it may be more accurate to describe his viewpoint as a melding of Lutheran and Reformed perspectives of soteriology; the Lutheran accent in particular was dominant in Brunner's affirmation of single predestination over against both the double predestination of Calvin and the liberal insistence on universal salvation, a view he charged Barth with holding.\n\nIn any event, Brunner and his compatriots in the neo-orthodox movement rejected \"in toto\" Pelagian concepts of human cooperation with God in the act of salvation, which were prominent in other humanist conceptions of Christianity in the late 19th century. Instead, they embraced Augustine of Hippo's views, especially as refracted through Martin Luther.\n\nAlthough Brunner re-emphasized the centrality of Christ, evangelical and fundamentalist theologians, mainly those from America and Great Britain, have usually rejected Brunner's other teachings, including his dismissal of certain miraculous elements within the scriptures and his questioning of the usefulness of the doctrine of the inspiration of the Bible. This is in accord with the treatment that conservatives have afforded others in the movement such as Barth and Paul Tillich; most conservatives have viewed neo-orthodox theology as simply a more moderate form of liberalism, rejecting its claims as a legitimate expression of the Protestant tradition.\n\nBrunner was considered to be the chief proponent of the new theology long before Barth's name was known in America, as his books had been translated into English much earlier. He has been considered by many to be the minor partner in the uneasy relationship. Brunner once acknowledged that the only theological genius of the 20th century was Barth.\n\n"}

His novitiate was passed under the guidance of David of Augsburg; and by 1246 he is found in a position of responsibility. By 1250 at the latest, he had begun his career as an itinerant preacher, first in Bavaria, where he endeavored to bring Duke Otto II back to obedience to the church. He then appears farther westward, at Speyer in 1254 and 1255, afterwards passing through Alsace into Switzerland. In the following years the cantons of Aargau, Thurgau, Konstanz, and Grisons, with the upper Rhine country, were the principal scenes of his activity. In 1260 he went farther afield, traversing after that date Austria, Moravia, Hungary, Silesia, Thuringia, and possibly Bohemia, reaching his Slavonic audiences through an interpreter. Some of his journeys in the East were probably in the interest of the crusade, the preaching of which was specially entrusted to him by Pope Urban IV in 1263.\n\nThe German historians, from Berthold's contemporary, Abbot Hermann of Niederaltaich, down to the middle of the sixteenth century, speak in the most glowing terms of the force of his personality and the effect of his preaching, which is said to have attracted almost incredible numbers, so that the churches could not hold them; and he was forced to speak from a platform or a tree in the open air. The gifts of prophecy and miracles were soon attributed to him, and his fame spread from Italy to England. He must have been a preacher of great talents and success. The mixedely mixed character of his audiences led him to make his appeal as wide and general as possible. He avoids subtle theological questions, and advises the laity not to pry into the divine mysteries, but to leave them to the clergy, and content themselves with the credo. The weighty political occurrences of the time are also left untouched. But everything that affects the average man — his joys and his sorrows, his superstitions and his prejudices — is handled with intimate knowledge and with a careful clearness of arrangement easy for the most ignorant to follow. While exhorting all to be content with their station in life, he denounces oppressive taxes, unjust judges, usury, and dishonest trade. Jews and heretics are to be abhorred, and players who draw people's minds away to worldly pleasure; dances and tournaments are also condemned, and he has a word of blame for the women's vanity and proneness to gossip. He is never dry, always vivid and graphic, mingling with his exhortations a variety of anecdotes, jests, and the wild etymologies of the Middle Ages, making extensive use of the allegorical interpretation of the Old Testament and of his strong feeling for nature.\n\nHis German sermons, of which seventy-one have been preserved, are among the most powerful in the language, and form the chief monuments of Middle High German prose. His style is clear, direct and remarkably free from cumbrous Latin constructions; he employed, whenever he could, the pithy and homely sayings of the peasants, and is not reluctant to point his moral with a rough humour. As a thinker, he shows little sympathy with that strain of medieval mysticism which is to be observed in all the poetry of his contemporaries.\n\nHe died in Regensburg on 13 December 1272.\n\n\n"}

The density is determined, through definition, by the normalized formula_3-electron wavefunction which itself depends upon formula_4 variables (formula_5 spatial and formula_3 spin coordinates).

{"id": "2266087", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2266087", "title": "Bramall Hall", "text": "Bramall Hall\n\nBramall Hall is a largely Tudor manor house in Bramhall, within the Metropolitan Borough of Stockport, Greater Manchester, England. It is a timber-framed building, the oldest parts of which date from the 14th century, with later additions from the 16th and 19th centuries. The house, which functions as a museum, and its of landscaped parkland with lakes, woodland, and gardens (Bramhall Park) are open to the public.\n\nDating back to Anglo-Saxon England, the manor of Bramall was first described in the \"Domesday Book\" in 1086, when it was held by the Masseys. From the late 14th century it was owned by the Davenports who built the present house, and remained lords of the manor for about 500 years before selling the estate of nearly 2,000 acres in 1877 to the Manchester Freeholders' Company, a property company formed expressly for the purpose of exploiting the estate's potential for residential building development. The Hall and a residual park of over 50 acres was sold on by the Freeholders (though not the lordship of the manor) to the Nevill family of successful industrialists. In 1925 it was purchased by John Henry Davies, and then, in 1935, acquired by the local government authority for the area, Hazel Grove and Bramhall Urban District Council. Following local government reorganisation in 1974, Bramall Hall is now owned by Stockport Metropolitan Borough Council (SMBC), which describes it as \"the most prestigious and historically significant building in the Conservation Area\".\n\nThe name \"Bramall\" means \"nook of land where broom grows\" and is derived from the Old English noun \"brōm\" meaning broom, a type of shrub common in the area, and the Old English noun \"halh\", which has several meanings—including nook, secret place and valley—that could refer to Bramall. The manor of Bramall dates from the Anglo-Saxon period, when it was held as two separate estates owned by the Anglo-Saxon freemen Brun and Hacun. The manor was devastated during William the Conqueror's Harrying of the North. After William subdued the north-west of England, the land was divided among his followers and Bramall was given to Hamon de Massey in around 1070.\n\nThe earliest reference to Bramall was recorded in the \"Domesday Book\" as \"Bramale\" at which time the manor was part of the Hamestan Hundred in Cheshire. With Cheadle and Norbury, Bramall was one of three places described in the \"Domesday Book\" that today lie within the modern-day Metropolitan Borough of Stockport. While its value was 32 shillings before 1066, it was worth only 5 shillings by 1086.\n\nIn the first part of the 12th century, the manor passed from the second Baron of Dunham Massey to Matthew de Bromale. According to Dean, Matthew's father is said to have founded the de Bromale family, naming himself after the manor, and he may have been related to or a follower of the de Masseys. He may have also held the manor at some point. The de Bromales held the manor until 1370 when Alice de Bromale married John de Davenport, and the family name was changed.\n\nThe Davenports were a family of significant landowners in the north-west of England whose antecedents can be traced back to the time of the Norman conquest. Orm de Davenport lived close to what is now Marton, and his name derives from the Norman French \"Dauen-port\" meaning \"the town on the trickling stream\", referring to his home on the River Dane. In 1160, the family became responsible for Macclesfield Forest, and in the early 13th century Vivian Davenport became its Grand Sergeant. The family's coat of arms includes a man's head with a rope around the neck, which is said to represent the family's power over life and death during this period. The Davenports acquired land throughout the area, notably at Wheltrough, Henbury, Woodford and lastly at Bramhall through marriage.\n\nThe Davenports held the manor for around 500 years, and it is likely that they built the current house after their accession. The first William Davenport was lord of the manor from 1478 to 1528, and one of the first recorded trustees of Macclesfield Grammar School. It is possible that he was heavily involved in the final battle of the Wars of the Roses at Bosworth and thereby instrumental in gaining the crown for Henry VII, who rewarded him with a pension of 20 marks per year payable for his lifetime. According to Dean, it was during this first William's tenure that Bramall may have been vandalised by a man named Randle Hassall, who destroyed all or part of nine houses and stole the timber. This gives credence to the theory that Bramall was rebuilt, replacing or partially replacing an older building.\n\nThe third William Davenport, who succeeded his father of the same name in 1541, took part in what later became known as The Rough Wooing, a series of attacks against Scotland ordered by Henry VIII. He was knighted in Scotland for his efforts at the burning of Edinburgh in May 1544. The fifth William Davenport inherited Bramall in 1585 from his father of the same name, and lived there with his wife Dorothy for over 50 years. The first marriage in Bramall's chapel was recorded in 1599, between William (aged 15), eldest son of the fifth William and Dorothy, and Frances Wilbraham (aged 11). On 22 April 1603 the fifth William Davenport was knighted by James I and VI at Newark (where the king was staying on his journey from Edinburgh to London) and later became the High Sheriff of Cheshire and a commissioner of the Hundred of Macclesfield. During the tenure of the fifth William, many alterations were made to the building, including the addition of a room above the Great Hall (which would later become the Withdrawing Room), and a long gallery. The internal decorations were also updated with additions such as wall paintings and portraits.\n\nThe sixth William succeeded his father in 1639 shortly before the English Civil War broke out. He was a Royalist, though said not to have been a particularly dedicated one. Many of his tenants became Parliamentarian soldiers, and over the next three years he had numerous visits from Parliamentarian soldiers, mostly seeking to acquire goods such as horses and weapons for the war, and using the house for quartering soldiers. Bramall was also host to Royalist soldiers, who confiscated some of the Davenport property for use in the war. William Davenport was at one point charged with delinquency, and ordered to pay a fine of £750 (equivalent to £ in 2020), and soldiers continued to use Bramall Hall because of its convenience.\n\nThe sixth William was briefly succeeded by his son Peter, who was followed by his son William. William the seventh's son was the eighth William Davenport, and an inventory of his property made shortly after his death in 1706 shows the gallery and gatehouse of Bramall were still intact. His two eldest sons each inherited the estate but both died young and heirless, so the estate passed to their younger brother Warren Davenport. Warren became part of the clergy, and during his tenure at Bramall set up a school close to the entrance of the estate. The tenth and final William Davenport succeeded his father, Warren at the age of four. Many changes were made to the house during his tenure, including the dismantling of the gatehouse side of the courtyard and the long gallery, the latter of which may have been done because of their being considered unsafe. William had no sons, so the estate passed to Salusbury Pryce Humphreys, the husband of his illegitimate daughter Maria.\n\nHumphreys, a Naval captain, had married Maria Davenport in 1810, and lived at Bramall Hall long before he succeeded his father-in-law. He became widely respected in the Stockport area, but following his succession to the estate in 1829, there were disputes from other members of the Davenport family who claimed a right to the property. Edmund Davenport, who claimed ancestry from Thomas Davenport, the third son of Peter, unsuccessfully contested the succession in two different courts; Edmund was eventually imprisoned for failing to pay the legal fees. Humphreys was knighted in 1834 for his services, and in 1838 changed his name to Davenport, in an effort to continue the Davenport line. He moved with Maria to Cheltenham in 1841, most likely because living at Bramall had become expensive or because of health concerns. Salusbury died there four years later and was buried in Leckhampton.\n\nOver the next decade the house was likely to have been let, as Maria Davenport preferred to live elsewhere. Her eldest son, William Davenport Davenport married firstly to Camilla Maria Gatt, then secondly to Diana Handley, whom he lived with at Bramall for four years before the estate was passed to him. Maria moved to London where she lived with her youngest son, Charles, and died in 1866. During William's tenure Bramall was regularly visited by members of the public, and the Chapel continued to be used for regular services of worship. However, following his death in 1869, the property was let to Wakefield Christy of Christys & Co Hatting, therefore ending direct involvement from the Davenport family. This occurred because William's son, John, was too young to inherit the estate. John's whereabouts during Christy's seven-year tenure is unknown, though he was shown as a visitor at Bramall in 1871, and in 1874 became the first chairman of the Bramhall School Board. In 1876, shortly before he returned to the house, he was listed as living on Ack Lane in Bramhall.\n\nJohn Davenport returned to Bramall in 1876 at the age of 25, but on 24 January 1877 it was announced that the estate was to be sold. The furniture was auctioned, while the house itself and rest of the Bramall estate (totalling ) was sold to the Freeholders Company Limited, a Manchester property development firm, on 3 August 1877 for £200,000 (about £ in 2020). According to speculation, the sale was motivated by financial issues and a personal distaste of the building. It remained empty until 1882 when it was purchased by Thomas Nevill, a local industrialist whose wealth came from calico printing, for his son, Charles. While living in the house, Charles Nevill carried out substantial restoration and remodelling, making the interior more comfortable while retaining most of the building's external features. The landscape of the grounds was redesigned, and a new stable was built along with a west and east lodge, housing the coachman and head gardener respectively. Another building, known as Hall Cottage, was also built in the vicinity, and housed the Sidebottom family.\n\nThomas Nevill, Charles' nephew and adopted son, inherited the estate in 1916, but decided to sell it following financial difficulties after the First World War. In 1923, many items of furniture were auctioned off, but there was no interest in purchase of the house. During that decade rumours arose that Bramall would be dismantled and transported to the United States; this may have been popularised by the autobiography of Kate Douglas Wiggin which described the author's visit to Bramall in 1890. In 1925, the house was auctioned, with the condition that if no purchaser came forward it would be demolished and the materials sold off. At one point the neighbouring local authority, Stockport County Borough Council, offered to buy the estate, but Nevill rejected their offer as \"unacceptable\". The auction received no acceptable offers. However, one of those present, John Henry Davies, president of Manchester United, later offered £15,000 (about £ in 2020) for the house; this was accepted. He lived in the house until his death in 1927, and his widow Amy remained there until 1935, when she sold it to Hazel Grove and Bramhall Urban District Council for £14,360 (worth about £ in 2020) with the intention that the house and park be open to the public.\n\nUnder council ownership, the house was occupied by a caretaker, though most of the building was open to the public. The house and grounds were used for various functions, such as the proclamation of George VI succeeding his brother King Edward VIII to the throne. At that time, the house was sparsely furnished as the Council was unable to afford much furniture. One of the Council's earliest projects was the restoration of the Chapel, which had fallen out of use towards the end of the 19th century. It was restored to resemble how it would have been when the Davenports were last at Bramall, and a service of consecration was held on 30 October 1938 once the work had been completed. In 1947, an association called the Friends of Bramall Hall was set up, primarily to find furnishings for the house, but also to advertise and assist in the upkeep of the house and grounds. Over the years, many furnishings which had once belonged to the house were returned, including portraits of the occupants. The estate is now the property of Stockport Metropolitan Borough Council (SMBC), which acquired it in 1974, following local government reorganisation.\n\nThe house and grounds are open to the public and are run by SMBC. Visitors may take an official tour of the house or explore it at their own pace on a self-guided basis. The public is able to wander the grounds freely at all times. Events and club meetings are held in the house and grounds throughout the year, and local schools often visit to experience life in a particular era. The house is licensed for wedding and civil partnership ceremonies, and has been used as a background for television series and films, including \"Prank Patrol\", \"Cash in the Attic\", \"Coronation Street\", \"The Making of a Lady\" and \"The Last Vampyre\".\n\nAlthough the house and the park are currently officially known by the name \"Bramall\", both have been spelled as \"Bramhall\", \"Bramal\" and other variations over the years. The \"Domesday Book\" used the spelling \"Bramale\", which led Charles Nevill to prefer \"Bramall\", a convention maintained by Hazel Grove and Bramhall Urban District Council when it acquired the property and continued by Stockport Council. Generally, the hall is now referred to as \"Bramall Hall\", whilst the name of the park, village and manor are spelt \"Bramhall\", though there remain some local inconsistencies. \n\nThere has been a settlement at Bramhall since Saxon times. According to Alfred Burton, who wrote about Bramhall in the late 19th century, the house has not always been in the present location, and was originally at Crow Holt Wood. This theory was rejected by another historian, Frederick Moorhouse, who became convinced in 1909 that Crow Holt Wood was a place where animals would have been taken to be sorted. There is no conclusive evidence to support either theory. Today the house is situated at the top of two valleys to its south and east sides, which two streams run through. It is a grade I listed building, and the oldest parts date from the late 14th century, with later renovations dating from the 16th and 19th centuries. It was originally accessed from the east side – the drive followed the route of the Ladybrook stream, then uphill towards the Chapel on the south side, reaching the courtyard on the other side. The main entrance is now on the side of the courtyard, in the west, because of the restructuring of the drive in 1888. The current layout of the house can clearly be seen from the west side of the building, in the courtyard: the service wing is on the left, the Great Hall is in the centre, and the Banqueting Hall is on the right. Before the 19th century, the courtyard was enclosed by a gatehouse which was taken down between 1774 and 1819, because of its being neither required nor in vogue.\nThe house is built with stone foundations, and the main structure is made of oak timbers, joined together using mortice and tenon joints, and held in place with oak pegs. Wattle and daub or lath and plaster are used to fill the spaces between the timbers. The black and white appearance from the timber framing construction dates from the Tudor period, though some parts have been repaired in later years.\n\nThe Great Hall is the central part of Bramall Hall. As with typical great halls in the Middle Ages, this would have been the room where the business of the house, estate and its villagers was conducted as well as a communal eating room for the household. It was originally an open-roofed, single-storey building, with a fireplace situated in the middle of the floor. It was probably first built around the end of the 14th century when the Davenports became lords of the manor. Towards the end of the 16th century, the Great Hall was substantially rebuilt, and the Withdrawing Room was created above it. A long gallery was also added as a third storey. The history of the gallery is uncertain; it was intact in 1790 but was taken down before 1819, because it was believed to be unsafe. A similar gallery was built at Little Moreton Hall, and it is still intact, causing the lower storeys to buckle under the weight. The Great Hall has a bay window with leaded windows, common throughout the building. William Harrison Ainsworth wrote about a right of way through the Great Hall, in his 1834 novel \"Rookwood\". He described how a traveller could pass through the Great Hall, and be entertained and sometimes refreshed. He described Bramall as \"[the] best specimen of its class ... its class, in our opinion, is the best ... to be met with in Cheshire\". No evidence exists for any such right of way. According to another tale, food from the buttery hatch was given to the poor who congregated outside.\nThe Lesser Hall leads off the southern end of the Great Hall. Its walls are panelled with oak, and the timbers that the ceiling is constructed of are decorated with cross and rose shapes dating from the Victorian era. The Banqueting Hall, which leads off the Lesser Hall to the west, is believed by Dean to be the oldest part of the house. Its northern wall is possibly the oldest part of the house, not having been renovated like the rest of the courtyard walls. The Nevills used this room as a billiards room. The Chapel, opposite the Banqueting Hall, was the only place of public worship in Bramhall until the 19th century. Its existence was first recorded in 1541, when it was referred to in the will of the second William Davenport. It fell into disrepair after its closure between 1869 and 1890, and was restored by Hazel Grove and Bramhall Urban District Council, following its purchase of the property in 1935, and religious services began to be held there again. On the north wall are unglazed windows which face the wall of the Library, showing that the south wing was once separate from the Great Hall. The Ten Commandments are written on the west wall. Underneath the Commandments, an older, pre-Reformation Passion painting, is visible. Such depictions were banned during the Reformation, and whitewashed over. It was not until the 20th century that efforts were made to restore Passion paintings, but very little of this particular painting survives.\n\nThe Ballroom, also known as the Upper Banqueting Hall, has an arched roof and according to Dean likely dates from the 16th century. It contains rare 16th-century wall murals, including one which according to Dean may depict the nursery rhyme \"Ride a cock horse\", and another along the east wall depicting a man playing a mandolin. Above the Chapel is the Chapel Room, also known as the Queen Anne Room, the Priest's Room, and Nevill's Room. It had been two rooms, a state bedroom and ante-room, but was almost totally transformed in the late 19th century into one larger room. A blocked-up door next to the fireplace was thought to have been a priest hole, but is more likely to have been the entrance to the first floor of the house from an external staircase before the wing was restructured, probably in the late 16th century or the early 17th century.\n\nNorth of the Chapel Room is the Paradise Room, whose name derives from the bed hangings which include embroidered images of Adam and Eve and their fall from paradise, as well as the use in Tudor times of the name \"paradise\" for a favourite room, often a bedchamber. This room has panelled walls, and a fireplace with a cupboard on the right hand side. On the other side there is a small recess, which was described in an 1882 newspaper as \"a dark passage which is said to lead to some region unknown\". It is possible that this was a priest's hide, adjacent to the Chapel and Chapel Room. Less romantically, it may, alternatively, have been a garderobe or privy. This room became associated with sightings of ghosts in the 19th century, and legends of a secret passage that led from the room outside or to the Chapel arose, though no such passages exist.\nThe largest room on the first floor is the Withdrawing Room, situated above the Great Hall. It has an elaborate plaster ceiling, and the overmantel above the fireplace bears the arms of Queen Elizabeth I. The frieze of the Withdrawing Room incorporates shields of arms representing marriages of the Davenports.\n\nThe northern wing of Bramall came to be the service wing with the kitchen, scullery, butler's pantry, dairy and store rooms on the ground floor and the servants' bedrooms in the attic.\n\nThe house is set in around of parkland, only a part of the estate originally attached to the house, which was, at one time, about in extent. The park was used for hunting, and the grounds were home to cattle, deer and horses, until the 17th century, when it was used as agricultural land. Two water courses run through the park: the Ladybrook, which, a little beyond the Park, becomes the Micker Brook, before flowing into the River Mersey, and a stream known as the Carr Brook. In the 1880s, Charles Nevill remodelled the grounds in the Romantic Victorian taste, altering the course of the Ladybrook, adding considerably to the trees in the park and creating artificial ponds The ponds were stocked with trout (though they are no longer fished). In 1888, a new drive was made through the park, a few yards further to the south of the house than the previous drive, and below the East Front of the house Nevill set out terraces.\n\nThe park is open to the public and features woodland, open grass areas, gardens, a café, a bowling green, and children's play areas.\n\n\n"}

In particular, Sikh, Muslim, Arab, South Asian, and other American communities have confronted verbal harassment, employment discrimination, physical assault, and even murder. For example, Balbir Singh Sodhi, a turbaned Sikh, was murdered just days after 9/11.\n\nIn response to the post-9/11 climate and the need to understand how discrimination has impacted these targeted communities in the United States, DNSI was created. The purpose of the project is to examine the mistreatment of minority communities in times of war or national crisis. DNSI is specifically interested in the human consequences of such mistreatment. In addition to performing research and releasing substantive reports, DNSI regularly notes relevant incidents and developments on its blog.\n\nDNSI was officially established on December 18, 2004, the 60th anniversary of Korematsu v. United States, the Supreme Court of the United States case that upheld the forced exclusion of citizens of Japanese ancestry (\"see\", Japanese American Internment). The dissenting justices warned of the use of perceived race, ethnicity, or national origin as a proxy for suspect qualities, including subversion and disloyalty to the union, during wartime. \n\nDNSI examines discrimination and its social impact not just in the aftermath of September 11, 2001, but also in other historical and international contexts that implicate the tension between equality and concerns for national security, such as the backlash against Muslims after the 7 July 2005 London bombings and the broader debate regarding assimilation and multiculturalism that is taking place in several Western societies (\"see\", United Kingdom debate over veils). \n\nDNSI is directed by Valarie Kaur (creator, writer, and producer of the documentary, \"Divided We Fall\") and Dawinder “Dave” S.

It blows in the coastal regions of the south from the outback, where the sandy wastes, bare of vegetation in summer, are intensely heated by the sun. This hot wind blows strongly, often for several days at a time, defying all attempts to keep the dust down, and parching all vegetation. It is in one sense a healthy wind, as, being exceedingly dry and hot, it destroys many injurious germs. The northern brickfielder is almost invariably followed by a strong \"southerly buster,\" cloudy and cool from the ocean. The two winds are due to the same cause, viz. a cyclonic system over the Australian Bight. These systems frequently extend inland as a narrow V-shaped depression (the apex northward), bringing the winds from the north on their eastern sides and from the south on their western. Hence as the narrow system passes eastward the wind suddenly changes from north to south, and the thermometer has been known to fall in twenty minutes.\n\nThe brickfielder precedes the passage of a frontal zone of a low pressure system passing by, and causes severe dust storms that often last for days and led to its naming as the winds blow up red brick dust. A more frequently used term for the winds is a \"burster\".\n\n\n"}

His maternal grandfather, Ber Erlich Sloshny, was killed by the Nazis. In 2009, the Israeli newspaper \"Yedioth Ahronoth\" published two photos of Nazi soldiers standing next to a kneeling Sloshny shortly before they shot him. During his term as Director-General of the Mossad, Dagan kept one of the photographs hanging in his office. Meir and his parents survived the Holocaust, and in 1950, the family made aliyah to Israel. During the ship's approach to Israel, it encountered a storm, during which Meir stood on the stern, praying to reach the shore safely. The family initially lived in an immigrant camp in Lod before settling in Bat Yam, where Meir grew up and his parents ran a laundry business.\n\nDagan was a vegetarian and an amateur painter, who studied painting and sculpture at Tel Aviv University. He was married to Bina and had three children.\n\nDagan was conscripted into the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in 1963. He was considered for the elite Sayeret Matkal unit, but ended up joining the Paratroopers Brigade. He completed his compulsory service in 1966, but was called up as a reservist in 1967, and fought in the Six-Day War as an officer, commanding a paratrooper platoon on the Sinai front. In the early 1970s, he commanded an ad hoc undercover commando unit, known as Sayeret Rimon, whose task was to combat the increasing violence in the Palestinian territories. In 1971, he received a Medal of Courage for tackling a wanted terrorist who was holding a live grenade. Dagan later fought in the 1973 Yom Kippur War as an officer on the Sinai front, and participated in the crossing of the Suez Canal. During the 1982 Lebanon War, he commanded the Barak Armored Brigade, and was one of the first brigade commanders to enter Beirut. In the 1990s, he held a series of high-level positions in the IDF command, eventually reaching the rank of Major General before retiring from the army in 1995, after 32 years of service.\n\nDagan later served as a counterterrorism adviser to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and he initially served as a National Security Adviser to Prime Minister Ariel Sharon. Sharon appointed him Director-General of Mossad in August 2002, replacing outgoing Director Efraim Halevy. As Mossad director, Dagan was responsible for intelligence, counter-intelligence, and counter-terrorism activities outside of Israel and the Palestinian Territories (which are under the jurisdiction of Shabak as they are considered domestic areas). He was allegedly aggressive in ordering killings of terrorists on foreign soil. According to Mossad veteran Gad Shimron, \"Israel is in the paradoxical situation of not having a death penalty but allowing itself to target Arab terrorists outside its borders with almost complete impunity. Meir Dagan fully subscribes to this thinking, unlike some of his predecessors\". By November 2004, at least four foreign terrorists had already been killed in suspected Mossad operations, and three major terrorist attacks planned against Israeli civilians abroad had been foiled.\n\nEhud Yatom, a member of the Knesset Subcommittee on Secret Services, stated that \"as someone who is privy to the facts but not at liberty to divulge them, I can say this with complete authority. The Mossad under Meir Dagan has undergone a revolution in terms of organization, intelligence and operations.\" Under Dagan's watch, Mossad tripled its recruitment efforts, launching a website where people can apply to join. Reportedly, much of its annual budget of $350 million was diverted from traditional intelligence gathering and analysis to field operations and \"special tasks\".\n\nDagan was reconfirmed as Mossad director until the end of 2008 by Prime Minister Ehud Olmert in February 2007, and in June 2008, Olmert again extended his tenure until the end of 2009.\n\nIn mid-2007, Dagan had a \"spat\" with the Deputy Director N, who was thought to be a candidate for replacing Dagan in late 2008. Dagan restored his former deputy T to the post and Dagan was thought likely to recommend T as his replacement.\n\nHe was re-appointed in 2009 by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to serve until the end of 2010. In June 2010, a report from Channel 2 stated that Netanyahu had denied a request by Dagan for another year as Mossad director, though this was quickly denied by the Prime Minister's Office. In November 2010, Tamir Pardo was announced as his replacement.\n\nFollowing his departure, Dagan made several controversial public statements concerning the prudence of an Israeli military attack on Iran's nuclear facilities, openly contradicting the positions of Prime Minister Netanyahu. He called it a \"stupid idea\" in a May 2011 conference. After Dagan voiced criticism of the prime minister, he was asked to return his diplomatic passport before its expiry date. Dagan repeated the opinion in a March 2012 interview with Lesley Stahl of CBS News' \"60 Minutes\", calling an Israeli attack on Iran before other options were exhausted \"the stupidest idea\" and saying he considered the Iranians \"a very rational regime.\"\n\nDagan served as the director of the Israel Port Authority, and in 2011 was appointed chairman of Gulliver Energy Ltd. (TASE:GLVR), which announced that it intended to mine uranium at a license in the Dead Sea area and drill in search of gold near Eilat.\n\nIn 2012, Dagan was diagnosed with liver cancer, and began chemotherapy treatment, but the cancer spread and he began to suffer from liver failure. In October of that year, he flew to Belarus and had a successful liver transplant operation performed by French-Jewish surgeon Daniel Azoulay, considered one of the world's leading liver transplant surgeons. After the operation, he was admitted to an isolation unit for fear of infection. At the time, criteria for a liver transplant in Israel dictated the patient must be no older than 65, so the 67-year-old Dagan had to seek treatment abroad. Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman helped facilitate the operation. On 27 October 2012, after his condition had stabilized, Dagan returned to Israel and was immediately hospitalized. He was discharged from Ichilov Hospital and began recuperating. Dagan was accompanied throughout his ordeal by Rabbi Avraham Elimelech Firer, with whom he developed a close relationship, and later reciprocated by helping Firer raise funds for a new rehabilitation center.\n\nDespite the transplant, the cancer remained in his body. Dagan died of cancer on 17 March 2016 at the age of 71. President Reuven Rivlin said of Dagan, \"Meir was one of the greatest of the brave, creative and devout warriors that the Jewish people ever had. His devotion to the State of Israel was absolute.\" Netanyahu said, \"In his eight years as the head of the Mossad, he led the organization in daring, pioneering and groundbreaking operations. A great warrior has died.\"\n\n"}

The genus includes three to six species depending on taxonomic interpretation; six are accepted by the \"Flora of China\". The name means winter flower in Greek.\n\nThey are deciduous or evergreen shrubs growing to 2–13 m tall. The leaves are opposite, entire, 7–20 cm long and 3–7 cm broad. The flowers are 2–3 cm wide, with numerous spirally-arranged yellow or white tepals; they are strongly scented, and produced in late winter or early spring before the new leaves. The fruit is an elliptic dry capsule 3–4 cm long.\n\nSource: Flora of China\n\n\"Chimonanthus praecox\" (\"wintersweet\") is the only species widely grown as an ornamental plant, for its spicily scented winter flowers; these are also used in floristry as cut flowering branches, which can also be forced as with forsythia. The petals are quite waxy. The plant prefers medium exposure to sunlight or high dappled shade, a fresh climate (hardy to USDA Zone 7), and soft, acidic permeable ground not waterlogged in winter. A protected, south-facing wall encourages early flowering, and a position should be chosen where its spicy perfume can be appreciated while coming and going from the house. Space needs to be allowed for its eventual spread to 3 m (10 ft), since untimely summer pruning to keep an ill-sited shrub in check will sacrifice flowering the following winter.\n\nIn China \"Chimonanthus\" was domesticated during the Song Dynasty and inspired courtly poems from the eleventh century; it flowers at the Chinese New Year, when flowering sprigs are used as hair ornaments. In China, prunings are dried and kept to perfume linen cupboards. The shrub was introduced to Japanese gardens from China in the early Edo period (probably between 1611 and 1629, according to \"Garden Plants of Japan\"). Its introduction into European gardens, from Japan, is noted for England, 1766, when it was grown under glass for the sixth Earl of Coventry in the conservatory at Croome Court, Worcestershire. By 1799 that shrub had grown to be 16 feet high and 10 feet wide. By that time it had been tried out of doors without winter protection and proved hardy in the south of England. Slips of it were distributed among nurserymen and so it entered European horticulture. A larger-flowered (though less fragrant) variety, \"grandiflorus\" was grown by the comtesse de Vandes in Bayswater, London, before 1819. A yellow-flowered variety (\"luteus\", 1814) is also noted.\n\nNo notice has yet been found of \"Chimonanthus\" in an American colonial garden; it was first offered in an American catalogue in 1811. It is hardy at least to New York City, where frosts interrupt, but do not stop the flowering.\n\nThe flowers are said to be edible., and can be used to flavor tea.\nAt the end of its flowering, since it flowers most freely on ripened young wood and has little summer and autumn interest, it is thinned and pruned similarly to Forsythia by partly heading back and a few thick old stems removed at the ground.\n\n\"Chimonanthus\" plants are frequently subject to attacks from aphids, and may be attacked by mites and leaf beetles.\nPine, bamboo and \"Chimonanthus\" are highly appreciated in Chinese culture for their endurance in severe winters. They are referred as Three Friends of Winter or Sui Han San You.\n"}

He declared war against Caesar, and initially fought and defeated Gaius Scribonius Curio, who was sent against him in 49 BC.\n\nVarus held the office of praetor no later than 53 BC. No record of his earlier political career survives. He was promagistrate, and likely propraetor, in Africa in 52 and possibly earlier.\n\nOn the outbreak of the civil war, Varus, an adherent of the optimates, was stationed in Picenum at the head of a considerable force. Upon the approach of Caesar, he was forced to evacuate the area. He and his levies joined Pompey in Apulia.\n\nWhen Pompey left Italy for Greece, Varus crossed over into Africa, and took possession of his former province, which had been allotted to Q. Aelius Tubero for the purpose of obtaining grain. Excluded from his province by Varus, Tubero then went to join Pompey. Varus was well known in Africa from his earlier propraetorship, and was thus able to raise two legions.\n\nCaesar sent Curio to Africa to take it away from the Pompeians. Curio was given command as a reward for his political support, but he had only limited military experience, and none at high command. He commanded legions that were initially recruited by the Pompeians but had switched allegiance at the surrender at Corfinium.\n\nCurio successfully landed his forces near Utica, surprising Varus' army. One of Varus' officers, Sextus Quinctilius Varus, who had been at Corfinium, appealed to Curio's legions to desert and return to their original loyalty. The troops refused and, after a success in a cavalry skirmish, Curio led them in a bold, uphill attack which swiftly routed Varus' army. Encouraged by this success, Curio acted on what proved to be faulty intelligence, and attacked what he believed to be a detachment of Juba's army. In fact, the bulk of the king's forces were there and, after an initial success, Curio's forces were ambushed and virtually annihilated. Curio was surrounded with the remnants of his troops on a hilltop and died in the fighting. Only a small fraction of his army, including the historian Asinius Pollio and the later consul Gaius Caninius Rebilus, escaped to Sicily. (also see: battle of Utica)\n\nAfter the Battle of Pharsalus, the remaining Pompeians, including Cato, fled to Africa to continue the struggle. At Cato's insistence, Varus resigned the supreme command to the consular Metellus Scipio. The official rank of Varus from 48 BC was \"legatus pro praetore\", as attested by inscriptional evidence.\n\nIn 46 BC, Varus was one of the commanders of the Pompeian fleet. After the defeat at the Battle of Thapsus, Varus fled to Hispania (Spain). There he was defeated off Carteia in a naval battle by Gaius Didius, who commanded Caesar's fleet, and forced to join the army on shore. He fell at the Battle of Munda. His head, together with that of Titus Labienus, was presented to Caesar.\n\n"}

It is known as the Cape Doctor because of a local belief that it clears Cape Town of pollution and 'pestilence'.\n\nAlthough the wind blows over a wide area of the Western Cape Province, it is notorious especially in and around the Cape Peninsula, where it can be unpleasantly strong and irritating. Capetonians also call it \"the South-Easter\". \n\nThe South Easter is usually accompanied by fair weather. However, if the South-Easter is accompanied by a cut-off low as occasionally happens in the spring and autumn months, this can cause heavy rains to fall over the Western Cape. This phenomenon is popularly known as a Black South-Easter. The Laingsburg flood of January 1981 was caused by heavy rains as part of a Black South Easter.\n\nIt is ironic that the meteorological records for Cape Town show that the north-westerly winds of winter can be far stronger than the South-Easter, while these winds are not given such a positive name. This could be because the north-westerly winds are usually accompanied by rain, which can fall for days and even weeks.\n\n\n"}

This includes breast cancer and non-small cell lung cancer. It is given by injection into a vein or by mouth.\nCommon side effects include bone marrow suppression, pain at the site of injection, vomiting, feeling tired, numbness, and diarrhea. Other serious side effects include shortness of breath. Use during pregnancy may harm the baby. Vinorelbine is in the vinca alkaloid family of medications. It is believed to work by disrupting the normal function of microtubules and thereby stopping cell division.\nVinorelbine was approved for medical use in the United States in 1994. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the safest and most effective medicines needed in a health system. The wholesale price in the developing world as of 2014 is between 18.10 and 42.82 USD per 50 mg vial. This amount in the United Kingdom costs the NHS about 139.00 pounds.\n\nVinorelbine is approved for the treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer. It is used off-label for other cancers such as metastatic breast cancer. It is also active in rhabdomyosarcoma.\n\nVinorelbine has a number of side-effects that can limit its use:\n\nChemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (a progressive, enduring and often irreversible tingling numbness, intense pain, and hypersensitivity to cold, beginning in the hands and feet and sometimes involving the arms and legs), lowered resistance to infection, bruising or bleeding, anaemia, constipation, vomitings, diarrhea, nausea, tiredness and a general feeling of weakness (asthenia), inflammation of the vein into which it was injected (phlebitis). Seldom severe hyponatremia is seen.\n\nLess common effects are hair loss and allergic reaction.\n\nThe antitumor activity is due to inhibition of mitosis through interaction with tubulin.\n\nVinorelbine was invented by the pharmacist Pierre Potier and his team from the CNRS in France in the 1980s and was licensed to the oncology department of the Pierre Fabre Group. The drug was approved in France in 1989 under the brand name Navelbine for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer. It gained approval to treat metastatic breast cancer in 1991. Vinorelbine received approval by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in December 1994 sponsored by Burroughs Wellcome Company. Pierre Fabre Group now markets Navelbine in the U.S., where the drug went generic in February 2003.\n\nIn most European countries, vinorelbine is approved to treat non-small cell lung cancer and breast cancer. In the United States it is approved only for non-small cell lung cancer.\n\nThe Madagascan periwinkle \"Catharanthus roseus\" L. is the source for a number of important natural products, including catharanthine and vindoline and the vinca alkaloids it produces from them: leurosine and the chemotherapy agents vinblastine and vincristine, all of which can be obtained from the plant. The newer semi-synthetic chemotherapeutic agent vinorelbine, which is used in the treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer and is not known to occur naturally. However, it can be prepared either from vindoline and catharanthine or from leurosine, in both cases by synthesis of anhydrovinblastine. The leurosine pathway uses the Nugent–RajanBabu reagent in a highly chemoselective de-oxygenation of leurosine. Anhydrovinblastine is then reacted sequentially with \"N\"-bromosuccinimide and trifluoroacetic acid followed by silver tetrafluoroborate to yield vinorelbine.\nAn oral formulation has been marketed and registered in most European countries. It has similar efficacy as the intravenous formulation, but it avoids venous toxicities of an infusion and is easier to take. The oral form is not approved in the United States, or Australia.\n"}

He lived with his mother and his father is the source of much speculation. Biedermann was an avid scholar at a young age and at the age of nine he entered a school in Dresden that was run by Free Masons. Bierdermann’s stay was so traumatizing for him later wrote that he never fully recovered. Richard Bazillion suggests that his hatred of tyranny and oppression stems from this early abuse. Biedermann attended the University of Leipzig in 1830 and in 1833 attended the university in Heidelberg where he began to aspire towards a career in academics. He received his doctorate in May 1835 back in Leipzig and began to teach philosophy.\n\nDuring the 1830s and 1840s, Biedermann and many other liberals saw the divide between the working and the upper classes rapidly expand because of industrialization and rapid urbanization. His native Saxony was one of the most severely affected by this and was the most overpopulated German kingdom. Standards of living in urban areas and quality of life were overwhelmingly on the decline. The traditional guilds that protected pre-industrial workers were being dismantled as factories needed less skilled labor to produce a cheaper product. Karl Biedermann and other urban intellectuals saw the need to modernize quickly to improve living conditions and ensure that the emerging working class had decent standards of living. As social unrest developed and cities began to riot, Biedermann became more and more convinced “the social peace depended on social justice for the working class.” His treatise on the Social Question stated that much of the burden placed on the working class could be lessened if the government used proper management and policies of social welfare. He published many articles about the Social Question in his quarterly journal and gave several lectures in Leipzig and Dresden between 1846 and 1847 on the subject. He studied many socialist thinkers and while he respected their commitment to social equality, he sided with liberalism and a reduced role of the state in social welfare.\n\nWhen he joined the Frankfurt Parliament in 1848, Biedermann had already developed a reputation as a strong liberal. He was a political and social commentator who was well known as an advocate of free speech, largely in part because of his prosecution of excessive censorship in 1845. Many recognized him as a leader of the liberal party in Saxony because of the acclaim of his trial. After the February Revolution in Paris, he led a Leipzig delegation to an audience with the ruler of Saxony, Frederick Augustus II, with the purpose of convincing him to open the Bundestag to popular representation. Frederick did not listen and Saxony began its March revolution. After the regime collapsed, Biedermann assumed a role on the Committee of Fifty that would serve as an interim government. He pushed for a Prussian monarch and a constitutional system similar to that of England. Throughout the entire process he was a staunch supporter of social reform in favor of the proletariat.\n\nReturning to Leipzig in 1863 he edited the newspaper \"Deutsche Aligemeine Zeitung\" and regained his professorship in 1865. He was again a member of the Saxon Upper House, and from 1871 to 1874 a member of the German Reichstag. He died at Leipzig on 5 March 1901.\n\nBiedermann's chief works are: \"Erinnerungen aus der Paulskirche\" (Leipzig, 1849); \"Deutschland im 18. Jahrhundert\" (Leipzig, 1854–1880); \"Friedrich der grosse und sein Verhaltnis zur Entwickelung des deutschen Geisteslebens\" (Brunswick, 1859); \"Geschichte Deutschlands 1815-1871\" (Berlin, 1891); \"Deutsche Volkessend Kulturgeschichte\" (Wiesbaden, 1901). He also wrote the dramas, \"Kaiser Heinrich V.\" (Weimar, 1861); \"Kaiser Otto III.\" (Leipzig, 1862); and \"Der letzte Burgermeister von Strassburg\" (Leipzig, 1870).\n\n\n"}

Wray Gill, he graduated Loyola University School of Law in New Orleans in June 1927. He became a prominent attorney in that city as part of the firm Gill, Bernstein, Schreiber and Gill whose main address was in Room 1707 of the Pere Marquette Building at 150 Baronne Street, New Orleans.\n\nGill was primarily a criminal lawyer who handled many high-profile cases over the years. His most controversial client was Carlos Marcello (Calogero Minacore) who was reputed to be the organized crime boss of Louisiana and surrounding states. He represented Marcello on many occasions between 1951 and 1972. Gill was himself the target of criminal charges several times.\n\nIn December 1961, he began representing a former pilot named David Ferrie in his attempt to be reinstated with Eastern Air Lines after his suspension, related to morals charges. Gill even employed Ferrie as an investigator and handyman in his own office from March 1962-December 1963.\n\nThroughout 1963, Gill represented Ferrie before the Pilots System Board of Adjustment in Ferrie's grievances against the airline. Ferrie was briefly detained in November 1963 over charges made by Jack S. Martin, another Gill associate, that Ferrie had been involved in some way with Lee Harvey Oswald.\n\nThree years later in 1966-1967, Ferrie became the prime suspect in New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison's investigation of the John F. Kennedy assassination, shortly before he was found dead in his apartment in February 1967.\n\nGill continued a relationship with Marcello, who testified on the lawyer's behalf in a civil case in March 1969. Gill represented Marcello in a case involving illegal re-entry in the U.S. after deportation, and surrendered him for a two-year term in 1970 on charges of assaulting a federal agent.\n\nHis own major residence was at 996 Robert E.

{"id": "2266155", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2266155", "title": "Telescopic handler", "text": "Telescopic handler\n\nA telescopic handler, also called a telehandler, teleporter, reach forklift or boom lift, is a machine widely used in agriculture and industry. It is somewhat like a forklift but has a boom (Telescopic cylinder), making it more a crane than a forklift, with the increased versatility of a single telescopic or articulating boom that can extend forwards and upwards from the vehicle. On the end of the boom the operator can fit one of several attachments, such as a bucket, pallet forks, muck grab, or winch. Telehandlers are sometimes called cherry pickers in North America, as that name can refer to any truck or heavy equipment that has such a boom.\n\nIn industry the most common attachment for a telehandler is pallet forks and the most common application is to move loads to and from places unreachable for a conventional forklift. For example, telehandlers have the ability to remove palletised cargo from within a trailer and to place loads on rooftops and other high places. The latter application would otherwise require a crane, which is not always practical or time-efficient.\n\nIn agriculture the most common attachment for a telehandler is a bucket or bucket grab, again the most common application is to move loads to and from places unreachable for a 'conventional machine' which in this case is a wheeled loader or backhoe loader. For example, telehandlers have the ability to reach directly into a high-sided trailer or hopper. The latter application would otherwise require a loading ramp, conveyor, or similar.\n\nThe telehandler can also work with a crane jib along with lifting loads, the attachments that include on the market are dirt buckets, grain buckets, rotators, power booms. The agricultural range can also be fitted with three point linkage and power take-off. \n\nThe advantage of the telehandler is also its biggest limitation: as the boom extends or raises while bearing a load, it acts as a lever and causes the vehicle to become increasingly unstable, despite counterweights in the rear. This means that the lifting capacity quickly decreases as the working radius (distance between the front of the wheels and the centre of the load) increases. When used as a loader the single boom (rather than twin arms) is very highly loaded and even with careful design is a weakness. A vehicle with a 5,000 lb (2.5ton) capacity with the boom retracted may be able to safely lift as little as 400 lb (225 kg) with it fully extended at a low boom angle. The same machine with a 5,000 lb lift capacity with the boom retracted may be able to support as much as 10,000 lb (5ton) with the boom raised to 70°. The operator is equipped with a load chart which helps him determine whether a given task is possible, taking into account weight, boom angle and height. Failing this, most telehandlers now utilize a computer which uses sensors to monitor the vehicle, and will warn the operator and/or cut off further control input if the limits of the vehicle are exceeded, the latter being a legal requirement in Europe controlled by EN15000. Machines can also be equipped with front stabilizers which extend the lifting capability of the equipment while stationary, as well machines which are fully stabilised with rotary joint between upper and lower frames, which can be called mobile cranes although they can typically still use a bucket, and are also often referred to as 'Roto' machines. They are a hybrid between a telehandler and small crane.\n\nA Gold Card can be obtained for telehandlers with a capacity of three tonnes or less for standard attachments where the machine is operated from below. The Gold Card is issued by the Telescopic Handler Association of Australia (TSHA). The Gold Card is not a legally required qualification however verbal instruction is not considered an appropriate training method as it lacks evidence of competency training. Competency training with evidence of learning and written assessment is legally required in Australia. \n\nA WorkSafe CN licence is a legally required licence for machines with a capacity of over three tonnes with standard attachments where the machine is operated from below.\n\nTelehandlers fitted with elevated work platform attachments and are operated from the basket are classified as elevated work platforms and require elevated work platform licences, such as the EWPA Yellow Card or Worksafe WP Licence.\n\nA WorkSafe C2 licence or higher may apply when using slewing-type telehandlers. \n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2266169", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2266169", "title": "Washington Monument (Baltimore)", "text": "Washington Monument (Baltimore)\n\nThe Washington Monument is the centerpiece of intersecting Mount Vernon Place and Washington Place, an urban square in the Mount Vernon-Belvedere neighborhood north of downtown Baltimore, Maryland. It was the first major monument begun to honor George Washington (1732–1799).\n\nThe Monument, a colossal landmark column, was designed by American architect Robert Mills (1781–1855), who also designed the later Washington Monument on the National Mall in Washington, D.C.. Construction began in 1815 on land donated by Colonel John Eager Howard (1752–1827), from his extensive \"Belvidere\" estate just north of Baltimore Town, and the masonry work was completed by 1829. The 178 foot, 8 inch doric column holds a ground-floor gallery offering digital exhibits about the construction of the Monument, the history of Mount Vernon and Washington Places neighborhood and of the life and accomplishments of General and President George Washington. Climbing the 227 steps to the top provides a view of the city from the historic neighborhood where it is located. Its neighbors and cultural institutions within a few blocks include the Peabody Institute, The Walters Art Museum, the Central Library of the Enoch Pratt Free Library, the Maryland Historical Society with its Enoch Pratt Mansion, the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary (old Baltimore Cathedral), and the Baltimore School for the Arts (public high school).\n\nThe glorification of Washington began long before his death at his beloved Mount Vernon estate, along the Potomac River in Virginia in December 1799. The old Confederation Congress (1781–1789 under Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union) had first announced a desire for a sculpture in his honor in 1783 after the end of the War and of General Washington's resigning of his commission and after his death, revived the idea of a memorial. However, these expressions of honor in the national capital floundered and would not be realized for decades. A monument honoring Washington in Baltimore, then an up-and-coming rising town, the third largest in North America, was first proposed as early as 1807, and in 1809 a Board of Managers of private citizens formed to commission and fund the monument intended to be erected in the old former colonial-era Courthouse Square on North Calvert Street, between East Lexington and East Fayette Streets (today's location of the Battle Monument Square, constructed simultaneously 1815–1822). In 1810, the first lottery authorized by the General Assembly of Maryland, was held. In 1813, an architectural competition was announced with a $500 prize to design and build the Monument at a cost of $100,000. Mills's design was chosen in 1814, the architect having taken pains to demonstrate to the Board of Managers that he was the first native born American with architectural training. The cornerstone was laid with great ceremony on Independence Day, July 4, 1815.\n\nMills's competition-winning designs included rich ornamentation, six iron galleries (balconies) dividing the exterior shaft into seven sections with text and images on each level highlighting important moments in Washington's life. An interior spiral staircase led to the top, where surmounting the column Washington was depicted in a quadriga. Concerns over the expense of this design, as well as its projected height caused later changes in not only its design, but location. Residents of old Courthouse Square feared the tall column would fall on their houses in the event of some natural disaster, so a new location was found in Howard's Woods, north of the city, on the \"Belvidere\" estate and with a 200 square feet of surrounding land for future public squares/parks, which was donated by noted leading citizen, American Revolutionary War hero, Col. John Eager Howard, (1752–1827) of the famed \"Maryland Line\" regiment of the Continental Army.\n\nBy the time the Monument's cornerstone was laid in Howard's Woods in 1815, Mills had significantly simplified the original elaborate design as depicted in an account of the Fourth of July ceremony. The design of the completed column is very similar to the Colonne Vendôme in Paris, which ultimately derived from Trajan's Column in Rome and was adopted in this time of the increasing popularity of Neoclassicism in American architecture.\n\nThe dignified cornerstone ceremony was overseen by the Monument's Board of Managers. Board President and noted citizen, James Buchanan observed that the city of Baltimore had not only \"the glory of being the first to erect a monument of gratitude to the father and benefactor of our country,\" but that it had a \"peculiar propriety\" in erecting \"this first expression of national gratitude,\" because of its successful defense against the British King's Army and Royal Navy during the Battle of Baltimore the previous fall.\n\nAt the ceremony it was declared that the Monument was to stand as \"memorial of the blessings and advantages that our country derived from the character of and conduct of that personage whose name it is to bear, and whose virtues it is to perpetuate.\" Following speeches, the cornerstone was laid by Levin Winder, then Governor of Maryland and head of the Maryland Freemasons, in a dignified masonic ceremony. The entire proceedings were printed in the local newspaper, picked up by newspapers in other major cities, and published in a souvenir booklet with illustrations.\n\nAlmost from the moment the cornerstone was laid, and particularly as the structure began to rise out of the ground (the first marble was laid in 1816), the Monument was a destination and an active memorial. In June 1817, during fifth President James Monroe's visit to the city, his itinerary included a visit to the Monument. Construction sites in the early nineteenth century were not what they are today, and during the building period it is clear the Monument was visited inside and out. As early as 1819 guests were leaving evidence of their visit in the Monument's subterranean vaults. By shortly after 1820 with the column proper largely complete with its integral interior staircase, visitors were already climbing to the top. New York City newspaper editor Nathaniel H. Carter visited in February 1823 and climbed to the top, escorted by a boy with a candle, to take in the views of the city.\n\nThe monument, constructed of marble from three quarries further north in Baltimore County, Maryland, rises 178 feet 8 inches and consists of three main elements: a low, square base containing a gallery; a plain, unfluted column; and, atop the column, a standing figure of Washington. The marble was sourced from three quarries: the base from General Charles Carnan Ridgely's (1760–1829), quarry, (near his Baltimore County estate of Hampton Mansion near Towsontown), the column and other details from Scott's quarry, and the statue from the quarry of Mrs. Frances D. T. Taylor.\nWashington is depicted on the top of the Monument resigning his commission as Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army, an act which took place in the Old Senate chamber in the Maryland State House in the state capital of Annapolis, Maryland on December 23, 1783. The Confederation Congress was meeting in the Maryland capitol which served for a few months as the temporary national capital. While there, the Congress also ratified the Treaty of Paris of 1783, ending the American Revolutionary War and recognizing the independence of the United States by Great Britain.\n\nThe statue was carved by Italian-born sculptor , who previous to his work on the Monument had been employed carving reliefs for the United States Capitol. William Rusk, in his book \"Art in Baltimore: Monuments and Memorials\", tells the following story about the raising of Causici's marble statue of Washington in 1829. \"Tradition recalls a prodigy occurring when the statue was raised to the summit of the monument – a shooting star dashed across the sky and an eagle lit on the head of the settling general.\"\n\nDetails added to the Monument in the 1830s include the bronze inscriptions on all facades documenting eight principal events in George Washington's life, including his military and presidential career. Former President John Quincy Adams assisted the Monument's Board of Managers in determining the wording of these events. The interior of the Monument was stuccoed at this time and exterior wood doors installed, painted to imitate ancient Roman bronze doors. The cast iron fence around the base was also designed by Mills and added in 1838. It contains symbolic references to the Maryland and the strength achieved through the union of the original thirteen colonies.\n\nOther memorials to Washington were erected in Maryland and in the nearby national capital, including the one now in Washington Monument State Park (near\nBoonsboro, Maryland and the Appalachian Trail), which was first constructed in 1827. The Boonsboro monument as it now stands reflects at least two rebuildings after the structure had fallen into ruin. In 1848 Mills's Washington Monument in the national capital was begun, but it would not be completed and dedicated until 1885. Because of this, for decades the Baltimore Washington Monument served as a leading symbol of American pride and gratitude towards George Washington, as a founding father and the first President of the nation. Mid 19th century maps, for instance, pair the Baltimore column with the Capitol building because the Washington, DC monument had only just begun.\n\nThe monument is now open for tourists. \n\nSince 1971, the city has held the annual \"Lighting of the Washington Monument\" during the first Thursday in December. A holiday village is held prior to the lighting ceremony in the West Square of Mount Vernon Place. Typically, the mayor and his or her family flips the switch for the lights, followed by a fireworks show. After the lighting, the holiday lights remain on the monument until after Christmas Day.\n\n\nThe Monument was closed in June 2010 by the City of Baltimore for safety reasons, according to articles in the \"Baltimore Sun\" and \"Washington Post\" newspapers. Missing mortar and rusted support brackets were among specific safety concerns. Several months later, a driver ran a 1997 Chrysler van through the southeast corner on October 30, 2010 and damaged roughly 15 feet of the fence. While reports initially indicated the Monument's closure would last three months, it was later determined that reopening would not take place until a renovation was completed. In 2012 the City of Baltimore entered into a partnership agreement with the Mount Vernon Place Conservancy to restore, maintain, and manage the Monument and parks squares of Mount Vernon Place.\n\nThe monument has undergone a $5.5 million restoration by the Mount Vernon Place Conservancy which began in January 2014. It was reopened and rededicated on July 4, 2015, in celebration of the bicentennial of the cornerstone being laid.\n\nDuring the monument's restoration two time capsules were discovered, the Monument's original 1815 cornerstone and a 1915 Centennial time capsule. Although the Monument's cornerstone had long been known to exist, its exact location was unknown. The 1915 Centennial time capsule, however, had been forgotten to time. The first to be discovered, the 1915 time capsule, was a sealed copper box that had been placed behind a plaque in the monument during the centennial celebrations in 1915. It was discovered in October 2014.\n\nIn February 2015, during digging for a sewage tank, a second time capsule, the Monument's original cornerstone, was discovered containing three well preserved glass jars stuffed with and surrounded by newspapers from July 1 and July 3, 1815, the days right before the laying of the cornerstone. The cornerstone was a nearly perfect granite cube with a marble lid, weighing between 1,000 and 1,500 pounds (roughly 450 to 700 kg). Besides the jars, the cornerstone contained a panel carved by local stonemasons and carvers of the time, and is expected to contain additional items, including coins and a metal plate. Like the 1915 capsule, the cornerstone contents were taken to the Walters Art Museum for analysis.\n\nThe contents of the 1815 cornerstone were fully revealed, and the 1915 time capsule opened, on June 2, 2015, at the Walters Art Museum. Among many interesting artifacts, the 1815 cornerstone contents included a copy of the United States Declaration of Independence printed in the (Baltimore) Federal Gazette on July 3, 1815, the day before the cornerstone was laid. The newspaper was folded open to the page printing the Declaration, and appears to be the last item placed in the stone. This inclusion suggests that to those who built the Monument in 1815, it was not just the first monument to honor America's founding father, George Washington, but also one of the earliest American monuments celebrating American national independence.\n\nThe contents of both time capsules can be seen on public display at the Maryland Historical Society, located just 2 blocks from the monument.\n\nThe Washington Monument is the centerpiece the public squares of Mount Vernon Place, which comprise the Mount Vernon Place National Historic Landmark District, designated in 1971. The Historic District is in turn within the Mount Vernon neighborhood of Baltimore, and the Baltimore National Heritage Area.\n\n\n"}

The village is mainly situated around the main A19 road with the addition of a small housing estate built in the mid-1960s to the west of the main road.\n\nTo the east of the A19 is Burn Airfield, built in 1942 as a bomber airfield in the Second World War. The airfield was owned by Yorkshire Forward (the regional development agency) prior to the dissolution of that body in 2012, and is now owned by the Homes and Communities Agency. It is now used by Burn Gliding Club. For some time in the early 21st century there were plans that the airfield might be developed as the site of the European Spallation Source (ESS), a particle accelerator facility to generate neutrons by spallation. Outline planning permission for the ESS was conditionally granted by Selby District Council on 14 September 2005. However, later statements by Lord Sainsbury the then outgoing UK Science Minister that \"no major science facility should be built outside existing sites at Oxford and Daresbury\" made it appear unlikely that the project would go ahead.\n\nBurn has its own telephone exchange which serves about 400 premises. It was enabled for ADSL in October 2004 and ADSL Max in March 2006. It has been accepting orders for FTTC BT Infinity since February 2014.\n\nIn the 20th century, Burn had a missionary house that was used as a Sunday School. It is now a private dwelling.\n\nGeorge King, a great-grandfather of the Colombian footballer Radamel Falcao, was born in the village.\n\nBurn also has a public house called The Wheatsheaf Inn.\n\n"}

It is the flagship building of the National Library Board, bringing together the core functions of the old library by incorporating a reference library, known as the Lee Kong Chian Reference Library (Chinese: 李光前参考图书馆), as well as a public library, the Central Public Library, under one roof.\nThe building designed by T.R. Hamzah & Ken Yeang consists of two 16-storey blocks, with three basements. The blocks are linked by skybridges on every floor. It houses two libraries, the Central Public Library in Basement 1 and the Lee Kong Chian Reference Library from Levels 7 to 13. It also houses the Drama Centre from Levels 3 to 5, which is managed by the National Arts Council. The National Library Board (NLB) headquarters is located on the 14th floor.\n\nOn the highest 16th level rooftop, there is a large closed area designed like a bubble called The Pod, used for functions and events. Although not a public viewing gallery, it has a panoramic 360-degree view of the city core and Marina bay area. The plaza on the ground floor has a cafe and is often used as an exhibition space. There are many gardens in the building but only two are opened to the public - the Courtyard on Level 5 and the Retreat on Level 10. There are three glass elevators for public use. There are escalators on every floor, from Basement 3 to level 14th. The basement carpark has 246 lots. A number of old bricks from the old National Library building has been incorporated into the present building.\n\nThe National Library traces its history back to the establishment of the first public library suggested by Sir Stamford Raffles, the founder of modern Singapore. It was renamed the Hullett Memorial Library in 1923, co-located with Singapore's first school, Raffles Institution, at a site now occupied by the Raffles City complex. It moved to a separate Library and Museum Building in 1887 under the name of Raffles Library as part of the Raffles Museum, before moving to the Stamford Road premises in 1960 under the name of the National Library of Singapore opened by Yang di-Pertuan Negara of Singapore Inche Yusof Ishak.\n\nPreviously called the National Reference Library, the Lee Kong Chian Reference Library adopted its new name after receiving a S$60 million donation from the Lee Foundation, founded by Dr Lee Kong Chian. It occupies 7 storeys (Levels 7-13) at the National Library Building with a floor area of 14,265 square metres. It has a start-up collection of 530,000 print and non-print materials. The Library provides reference services onsite, or via email, sms, telephone and fax. It has a full range of facilities such as access to electronic databases, document delivery service, microfilm, reprography and audio-visual are available. Other facilities at the library include wireless access to the Internet, as well as the use of reading and meeting rooms.

The root appears to stem from Basque \"semen\" ('son'), attested in the Aquitanian inscriptions as \"Sembeconnis\" and like forms. Variants of the surname include the archaic Ximénez, Ximenes, as well as Giménez, Gimenes, Jimenes, Chiménez, Chimenes, Seménez, Semenes and the Sicilian Scimemi or Scimeni.\n\nIn Spanish orthography, the variations of \"Jiménez\" that end with a \"z\" are written with an acute accent on the second syllable. In English, all variations are commonly written without the diacritic.\n\nIn Portuguese orthography, there is no diacritic used for Ximenes.\n\nAs the modern name \"Ximenes\" has an \"-es\" suffix, it is almost certainly of Portuguese, Galician or Old Spanish origin, as the orthographic change to \"-ez\" (and indeed, the consonant shift from X to J) was revised in Spain only in the late 18th century. This obviously was not the case in Portugal.\n\nOther languages in Castilian-dominated lands like Aragon, Asturias, Galicia, etc. often retained the \"-es\" ending, and their descendants bear witness to this historical anomaly. In Catalonia, Valencia and the Balearics, the ending \"-is\" is used instead of \"-es\" (or \"-ez\"), hence, the spelling Ximenis (or the variant with vowel epenthesis, Eiximinis or Eximenis).\n\nXimenes, as such, exists most commonly in Portugal, and in all of the ex-Portuguese Crown territories, especially in Brazil. Bishop Carlos Filipe Ximenes Belo, Nobel Laureate from East Timor in 1996, and Brazilian actress, Mariana Ximenes, are prime examples of this historical difference.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Jiménez dynasty in 905 became kings of Pamplona, eventually expanding control to most of Christian Spain.\n\n"}

The Vultee design won the competition, beating the Curtiss XP-55 Ascender and the Northrop XP-56 Black Bullet. Vultee designated it Model 84, a descendant of their earlier Model 78. After completing preliminary engineering and wind tunnel tests, a contract for a prototype was awarded on 8 January 1941. A second prototype was ordered on 17 March 1942. Although it appeared to be a radical design, its actual performance was lackluster and the project was subsequently canceled.\n\nThe XP-54 was designed with a pusher engine in the aft part of the fuselage. The tail was mounted rearward between two mid-wing booms, with the 12-ft propeller between them. The design included a \"ducted wing section\" developed by the NACA that enabled installation of cooling radiators and intercoolers in the inverted gull wing. The Pratt & Whitney X-1800 engine was initially proposed as the powerplant but after its development was discontinued, the liquid-cooled Lycoming XH-2470 was substituted.\n\nIn September 1941, the XP-54 mission was changed from low altitude to high altitude interception. Consequently, a turbo-supercharger and heavier armor had to be added, and the estimated empty weight increased from 11,500 to 18,000 lb (5,200 to 8,200 kg).\n\nThe XP-54 was unique in numerous ways. The pressurized cockpit required a complex entry system: the pilot's seat acted as an elevator for cockpit access from the ground. The pilot lowered the seat electrically, sat in it, and raised it into the cockpit. Bail-out procedure was complicated by the pressurization system and necessitated a downward ejection of the pilot and seat in order to clear the propeller arc. Also, the nose section could pivot through the vertical, three degrees up and six degrees down. In the nose, two 37 mm T-9 cannon were in rigid mounts while two .50 cal machine guns were in movable mounts. Movement of the nose and machine guns was controlled by a special compensating gun sight. Thus, the cannon trajectory could be elevated without altering the flight attitude of the airplane. The large nose section gave rise to its whimsical nickname, the Swoose Goose, inspired by a song about Alexander who was half swan and half goose: \"Alexander was a swoose.\" – a name also partly shared with the oldest surviving B-17.\n\nFlight tests of the first prototype, \"41-1210\", began on 15 January 1943. Initial trials showed performance to be substantially below guarantees. At the same time, development of the XH-2470 engine was discontinued and, although it appeared possible to substitute the Allison V-3420 engine without substantial airframe changes, the projected delay and costs resulted in a decision not to consider production buys.\n\nThe prototypes continued to be used in an experimental program until problems with the Lycoming engines and lack of spare parts caused termination. The second prototype, \"42-108994\" (but mistakenly painted as \"42-1211\") equipped with an experimental GE supercharger, made 10 flights before it was relegated to a \"parts plane\" in order to keep the first prototype in the air.\n\n\n"}

Knight began looking for a suitable location to house the mission and settled on the area bordering the Ottawa River near Rockcliffe Park. Unfortunately there were no buildings in the area for sale. In 1930, Knight proposed the purchase of the Blackburn property, located at 62 Sussex Drive. The property was a prized piece of land overlooking the Rideau Falls that was not far from the residence of the Governor General and, at the time, connected to the city centre by a tram. After lengthy negotiations with the owner, the property was purchased from Arthur Blackburn on 31 December 1931. The legation was then based in the Blackburn mansion.\n\nConstruction on the new mission building began on the property in 1936 with the first stone being laid by Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King on Bastille Day. In January 1938, while construction was in process, France purchased the next door Lemay property, sensibly enlarging the property. At the same time, France acquired, for one symbolic dollar, a narrow strip of land along the Ottawa River, belonging to the Ontario provincial government. The Ottawa River thus became the limits of the property. Both the Blackburn and Lemay houses were demolished during construction. On 4 January 1939, the mission was opened in the presence of seven hundred people, including the Governor General of Canada Lord Tweedsmuir and Prime Minister Mackenzie King.\n\nThe French envoy René Ristelhueber, appointed in early 1940, acknowledged the Vichy regime as did the Canadian government. In 1942, Canada switched and expelled the Vichy diplomats and the facilities were turned over to the Free French Forces and Colonel Philippe Pierrené was recognized as the French envoy. The French upgraded the mission to a full embassy following World War II.\n\nInaugurated in 1939, this diplomatic mission was designed by French architect Eugène Beaudouin in the Art Deco style. Housing both the residence of the ambassador and embassy services, the building of grey granite is three stories and is organized around the Great Hall.\n\nThe main room features furniture and decorations also in an Art Deco style, including Marcel Gromaire tapestries representing the four seasons: the Canadian winter, the Parisian spring, summer in Saint-Malo and fall in Quebec. A massive pink marble staircase provides access to the second story and leads to the gallery overlooking the Great Hall and reception rooms. \n\nThe rooms display decorations that highlight the ties of friendship which exists between the France and Canada, like the bas-relief of the gallery that represents the Canadian National Vimy Memorial in honour of Canadian soldiers during the First World War and the office walls ambassadors engraved by Charles-Émile Pinson on the subject of the discovery of Canada by the Vikings. The materials that were used to build the embassy come from both Canada (wooden doors and door frames, and the grey granite from Quebec for exterior walls) and France (Saint-Quentin travertine for walls of the hall, and the pink marble from Burgundy for the staircase).\n\nThe dining room is decorated with a 120 square metre mural named \"La France\", by painter Alfred Courmes. The decoration of the bronze doors of the living room was done by Robert Cami. The embassy is also decorated with sculptures by Leygue Louis and Jean Prouvé.\n\n\n"}

Returning to theology, he attempted to connect it with philosophy in a treatise, \"Dilucidationes philosophicae, de deo, anima humana, mundo\" (Tübingen, 1725, 1746, 1768). This work contains nothing original but giving a clear representation of Wolff's philosophy. It met with great success, and the author was appointed to the office of preacher at the castle of Tübingen and of reader in the school of theology.\n\nIn 1721, after two years study under Wolff, he became professor of philosophy at Halle, and in 1724 professor of mathematics. His friends at Tübingen disapproved of his new views, and in 1725, on Wolff's recommendation, he was invited by Peter I of Russia to lecture in Saint Petersburg, where he was well received. His success in winning the prize of a thousand crowns offered for a dissertation on the cause of gravity by the Académie des Sciences of Paris secured his return to his native land in 1731.\n\nIn 1735, largely on account of his knowledge of military engineering, Karl Alexander, Duke of Württemberg (reigned 1733–1737) made him a privy councillor, but his hands were tied owing to the frivolous atmosphere of the court. On the death of the duke, however, he became a member of the Regency Council, and devoted himself with energy and success to the reorganization of the state. In the departments of education, state-religion, agriculture and commerce, his administration was uniformly successful, and he became in a real sense the head of the state.

The Ronda was also briefly sold in the United Kingdom as the SEAT Málaga hatchback. 177,869 Rondas were built in total.\n\nThe SEAT Ronda was a restyled SEAT Ritmo which in its turn derived from the Fiat Ritmo. However, in 1983 the Arbitration Chamber of Paris (subsequent to the acrimonious split between FIAT and SEAT) judged that the differences between those cars were important enough so as not to consider the Ronda to be a rebadged Ritmo. The most visible external design differences between a Ritmo and a Ronda are rectangular headlights on the Ronda in place of the round ones featured on the Ritmo, different tail lights and panels, and changed door handles. Mechanically, there were also some minor differences, mostly due to the use of Spanish-built engines and other parts.\n\nThe interior was more commodious than that of the original Ritmo, with a different dashboard with a more complete instrumentation. The seats were deeper and more comfortable, while the door panels were improved and the sound dampening was increased. The Spanish-made transmission was only available in a five-speed manual.\n\nThe Ronda featured a boot capacity of 370 litres which could be increased to 1250 litres by folding rear seats. It was introduced with locally built engines from the 124 series or a larger twin cam 1.6, as well as a 1.7-litre diesel unit. Later, a version of Fiat's two-litre engine with a Porsche-developed head (\"System Porsche\") was also installed in the rare Ronda Crono 2000 2.0 model. Only 800 of these were built. After an Autumn-1984 facelift, the Ronda received the \"System Porsche\" petrol engines which were developed for the Ibiza. The car was now called the Ronda P and carried a stylized \"P\" on the rear side.\n\nThe engines were:\n\nRonda (Petrol, 1982-1984)\n\nRonda P (Petrol, 1984-1986)\n\nDiesel (1982-1986)\n\n1982 saw the end of almost 30 years of co-operation between SEAT and the automaker Fiat. In order to conform with the end of partnership agreement signed by the two automakers, SEAT had to quickly restyle its entire model range to be able to offer its models on sale, distinguishing its cars from those of the Italian firm. This was marked by a change in SEAT's brand logo and the first car launched without Fiat involvement, the SEAT Ronda, appeared that same year.\nThe launch of that model though sparked a lawsuit from Fiat against SEAT, as the former claimed the car was still too similar to a car in Fiat's own range, the Fiat Ritmo. In defence of SEAT, the then president of the company, Juan Miguel Antoñanzas, showed a Ronda to the press with all the alterations from the Fiat Ritmo painted bright yellow, to highlight the differences. An El País journalist who covered the trial claimed that the result was spectacular.\n\nThe case was eventually taken to the ICC International Court of Arbitration in Paris which in 1983 declared that differences between the cars were sufficiently substantial for the Ronda not to be judged as a rebadged Ritmo, ending the dispute in favour of SEAT. This also meant that SEAT was free to export the Ronda (and soon afterwards also the Fura), although the car never sold particularly well outside of Spain. Rumour at the time had it that Fiat was angry because the Ronda restyling was in fact too close to their own planned restyling for the Fiat Ritmo, which they had to scrap. Dutch car magazine Autovisie comparison tested the Ronda and the Ritmo in May 1983; the Ritmo was marginally quicker and lighter, and more modern overall, but the Ronda countered with a five to six per cent lower price.\n"}

In 2008, they agreed to acquire DiC Entertainment, expanding its library. On August 20, 2012, DHX Media (now WildBrain) announced its intent to acquire Cookie Jar Group, in a deal that would make DHX the largest independent owner of children's television programming.\n\nAfter their 1976 meeting in New Orleans, Micheline Charest, a native of London, England and resident of Quebec, Canada; and Ronald A. Weinberg, born in New York, organized an event for a women's film festival, and worked at distributing foreign films to US theatres. The couple moved to New York City and formed Cinar, a film and television distribution company.\n\nIn 1984, Cinar changed their focus from media distribution to production and moved operations to Montreal, where they concentrated on children's television programming (including \"Animal Crackers\", \"Emily of New Moon\", \"Mona the Vampire\", and \"The Wombles\"), as well as the English and French dubs of the anime series \"Adventures of the Little Koala\", \"Ronin Warriors\", \"Doraemon\" and \"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\" and the Spain-originating TV series \"The World of David the Gnome\", and the English dub of \"Ultra Seven\". As a production company, Cinar was also involved in the work of \"Are You Afraid of the Dark?\", \"The Busy World of Richard Scarry\", \"Madeline\", \"The Real Story of Happy Birthday to You\", \"The Adventures of Paddington Bear\", \"Space Cases\", \"The Shoe People\" and its most famous work, \"Arthur\", \"Zoboomafoo\" and \"Caillou\".\n\nThe firm became a public company in September 1993. By 1999, Cinar boasted annual revenues of $150 million (CAD) and owned about $1.5 billion (CAD) of the children's television market. In 1996, Cinar acquired the library of the British animation studio FilmFair, and closed it in 1998. In February 1999, Cinar acquired the film library of Leucadia Film Corporation. CINAR also owned the Fandango Studios dubbing studio in Mexico City.\n\nThe success of Charest, Weinberg, and Cinar ended in March 2000, when an internal audit revealed that about $122 million (US) was invested into Bahamian bank accounts without the board members' approval. Cinar had also paid American screenwriters for work while continuing to accept federal grants and tax credits for the production of Canadian content. The names of Canadian citizens (generally non-writers connected to Cinar, including Charest's sister Helene) were credited for the works. While the province of Quebec did not file criminal charges, Cinar denied any wrongdoing, choosing instead to pay a settlement to Canadian and Quebec tax authorities of $17.8 million (CAD) and another $2.6 million (CAD) to Telefilm Canada, a Canadian federal funding agency. The value of Cinar's stock plummeted, and the company was soon delisted.\n\nThere was some speculation that Hasanain Panju, CFO was the mastermind behind the investment scheme along with John Xanthoudakis of Norshield Investment Group and Lino Matteo of Mount Real Corporation. It was alleged that Charest and Weinberg (and later Panju) used Cinar as a 'piggy bank' and schemed to transfer funds out from the company through a series of complicated transactions to their own offshore holding companies.\n\nIn 2001, as part of a settlement agreement with the Commission des Valeurs Mobilières du Québec (Quebec Securities Commission) Charest and Weinberg agreed to pay $1 million each and were banned from serving in the capacity of directors or officers at any publicly traded Canadian company for five years. There was no admission of guilt and none of the allegations has been proven in court. Charest never lived to see a possible outcome, as she died on April 14, 2004.\n\nOn August 26, 2009, in a separate case, the Superior Court of Quebec ruled that Cinar had plagiarized the work of Claude Robinson for its animated series \"Robinson Sucroe\". The series was based on a concept he had pitched to Cinar in 1986, but had been turned down. Robinson was awarded $5.2 million in damages, in a suit that resolved a 14-year dispute between the two parties.\n\nOn January 17, 2014, former CFO Hasanain Panju pleaded guilty to undisclosed crimes. The judge noted these crimes were \"disgraceful\" and placed a publication ban on details surrounding the trial. Panju was sentenced to four years in prison.\n\nOn May 12, 2014, co-founder Ronald Weinberg, John Xanthoudakis of Norshield Financial Group and Lino Matteo of Mount Real Corp. were charged with 26 counts of fraud in Montreal Superior Court. They were convicted on most of the counts on June 2, 2016, and in the trial Panju acted as a key Crown witness. On June 22, 2016, Weinberg was sentenced to 8 years and 11 months in prison, and the other two received sentences of 7 years and 11 months each. On May 3, 2019, Weinberg was fully paroled.\n\nThe Cinar affair was described thus by \"The Globe and Mail\":\n\nIn March 2004, Cinar was purchased for more than CA$190 million by a group led by Nelvana founder Michael Hirsh, and former Nelvana president Toper Taylor. The company was subsequently renamed Cookie Jar.\n\nOn June 20, 2008, Cookie Jar Group announced a deal to acquire DIC Entertainment. On July 23, 2008, the acquisition was completed, and eventually DIC was folded into Cookie Jar's entertainment division. When Cookie Jar acquired DIC Entertainment, Cookie Jar also acquired Copyright Promotions Licensing Group and a one-third interest in international children's television channel, KidsCo. Cookie Jar now has more than 6,000 half-hours of programming as well as rights to several children's brands. Also it was announced that Cookie Jar was in negotiation with American Greetings to buy the \"Care Bears\", \"Strawberry Shortcake\", and \"Sushi Pack\" franchises. The deal was not finalized yet in late 2008 and with the current scenario, the transaction did not progress. On March 30, 2009, Cookie Jar made a $76 million counter bid for Care Bears and Strawberry Shortcake. Cookie Jar had until April 30, 2009 to complete a deal with American Greetings. In May 2009, American Greetings filed a $100 million lawsuit against Cookie Jar and Cookie Jar filed a $25 million lawsuit against American Greetings over the Care Bears and Strawberry Shortcake deal.\n\nIn April 2009, the company hired Tom Mazza, formerly of TriStar and Paramount Television, as its executive vice president of worldwide television. Mazza planned to broaden Cookie Jar's slate by pursuing Canadian co-productions intended for global saley. In February 2011, Cookie Jar announced a new imprint known as \"The Jar\", which it intended to use on series targeting U.S. primetime television, as well as a slate including Lori Kirkland Baker's \"All Over You\" for Lifetime, \"Blah Girls\" for MTV, Andrew Orenstein's \"Lords of the Playground\" for CBS, and Steven E. de Souza's \"Spyburbia\" for Fox and Global.\n\nOn August 20, 2012, DHX Media (now WildBrain) announced that they would acquire Cookie Jar Group for $111 million; the purchase made DHX the world's largest independent owner of children's television programming. The acquisition was completed on October 22, 2012.\n\nAt the time of Cookie Jar's acquisition of the company, DIC had been programming a weekend morning block for CBS known as \"KEWLopolis\". On February 24, 2009, it was announced that CBS had renewed its contract with Cookie Jar for the block through 2012. For the 2009-10 television season, the block was re-branded as Cookie Jar TV. Cookie Jar TV was discontinued after the 2012–13 television season; it was succeeded in 2013–14 by CBS Dream Team, which is programmed by Litton Entertainment.\n\nOn November 1, 2008, This TV launched airing Cookie Jar's daily children's programming block Cookie Jar Toons which provided children's and E/I-oriented programming.\n\nCookie Jar Kids Network (formerly DiC Kids Network) was a children's programming block that aired selected Cookie Jar programs on local FOX, MyNetworkTV, and independent stations to provide them with a source of Educational/Informational (E/I) programming required by American broadcast standards. Syndicated by Ascent Media, it ceased broadcasting on September 17, 2011.\n\n\n\n"}

David Naughton and Stephen Furst are paired with a grab-bag group of fellow students including Michael J. Fox in his first film appearance. The film was directed by Michael Nankin.\n\nGraduate student Leon (Alan Solomon) summons five college students to his apartment and challenges them to participate in his latest game creation: The Great All-Nighter. He tells them about his game and instructs them to form teams. At first, the leaders refuse to play. However, rivalries between them lead all five to change their minds by the game's start time – a scenario Leon has already predicted based on his extensive planning.\n\nLeon, as \"game master,\" keeps track of the teams locations with a giant map, and various radio equipment. The teams are supposed to call and check in at each clue (though many of the teams end up skipping at least one location).\n\nThe adventures of the other three teams are subplots, as well as the situation at Leon's apartment (\"Game Control\"). Here, along with his female assistants Candy and Sunshine (Debi Richter and Kirsten Baker), Leon monitors the progress of the game. Already unpopular with his landlady, Mrs. Grimhaus (Irene Tedrow), for the amount of noise he makes, Leon faces eviction if any of the other tenants complain. Several of them \"do\" show up to complain, but as Leon explains the mechanics of the game to them, they become fascinated with it and help run it, much to the annoyance of Grimhaus.\n\nThe game culminates in a race-to-the-finish at the Westin Bonaventure Hotel where the yellow team ultimately prevails and wins the game. A huge party consisting of all contestants and game control follows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPaul Reubens (better known as Pee-wee Herman) has a small part as the \"Pinball City Proprietor\". Other cameos include John Fiedler as Wally Thorpe, one of the other tenants, and Marvin Kaplan as the Bonaventure desk clerk. Future film director Andy Tennant plays a member of the Blue team.\n\nJohnie's Fat Boy was Johnie's Coffee Shop located at the corner of Wilshire Blvd and Fairfax on the western edge of the Miracle Mile. Though it closed in 2000, the building is still used for filming.\n\nPinball City was Castle Park (later Malibu Castle) Miniature Golf in North Hollywood. Located at 12400 Vanowen St., it closed in 1998.\n\nThe Star Fire game in the video arcade that provides the clue to the final destination was an actual arcade game of the period. The game play was real; however a special open cabinet for a standing player had been created for the movie, since the real game cabinet was an enclosed cockpit in which the player was seated.\n\nThe movie was novelized in a 1980 paperback, \"Midnight Madness\", by Tom Wright (Ace, 1980) \n\nThis was Michael J. Fox's first motion picture and is credited as Michael Fox.\n\n\"Midnight Madness\" was rated PG—only the second film from the Disney company to receive anything other than a \"G\" (the first was \"The Black Hole\"). Although produced by Disney, the company's name did not appear on the credits. Early in the film, the white team thought the first clue referred to the Hollywood Walk of Fame. As they counted the numbers, they ended up on Mickey Mouse's star. When Wesley asked what it meant, one of his team mates said, \"Perhaps it's in code.\"\n\nThe film only experienced a limited release, and garnered bad reviews. Roger Ebert, in his review, expressed disappointment at the film, as he was a fan of the early work of Nankin and Wechter. It ultimately grossed $2.9 million in the North American box office.\n\nThe film lost Disney a reported $4.5 million.\n\nThe film achieved a small cult following after it began airing on the HBO cable network. After a 2001 DVD release from Anchor Bay Entertainment, \"Midnight Madness\" was re-released in 2004 by Disney DVD with the \"Walt Disney Pictures Presents\" logo—the first time that Disney has officially associated itself with the film.\n\n\"Midnight Madness\" has inspired many spin-offs and other Alternate Reality Games (ARG).

{"id": "2266240", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2266240", "title": "Missile gap", "text": "Missile gap\n\nIn the US, during the Cold War, the missile gap was the perceived superiority of the number and power of the USSR's missiles in comparison with its own (a lack of military parity). The gap in the ballistic missile arsenals did not exist except in exaggerated estimates, made by the Gaither Committee in 1957 and in United States Air Force (USAF) figures. Even the contradictory CIA figures for the USSR's weaponry, which showed a clear advantage for the US, were far above the actual count. Like the bomber gap of only a few years earlier, it was soon demonstrated that the gap was entirely fictional.\n\nJohn F. Kennedy is credited with inventing the term in 1958 as part of the ongoing election campaign in which a primary plank of his rhetoric was that the Eisenhower administration was weak on defense. It was later learned that Kennedy was apprised of the actual situation during the campaign, which has led scholars to question what Kennedy knew and when he knew it. There has been some speculation that he was aware of the illusory nature of the missile gap from the start and that he was using it solely as a political tool, an example of policy by press release.\n\nThe Soviet launch of Sputnik 1, on October 4, 1957, highlighted the technological achievements of the Soviets and sparked some worrying questions for the politicians and general public of the US. Although US military and civilian agencies were well aware of Soviet satellite plans, as they were publicly announced as part of the International Geophysical Year, US President Dwight Eisenhower's announcements that the event was unsurprising found little support among a US public that was still struggling with McCarthyism.\n\nPolitical opponents seized on the event, helped by Eisenhower's ineffectual response, as further proof that the US was \"fiddling as Rome burned.\" Senator John F. Kennedy stated \"the nation was losing the satellite-missile race with the Soviet Union because of… complacent miscalculations, penny-pinching, budget cutbacks, incredibly confused mismanagement, and wasteful rivalries and jealousies.\" The Soviets capitalized on their strengthened position with false claims of Soviet missile capabilities, claiming on December 4, 1958, \"Soviet ICBMs are at present in mass production.\" Five days later, Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev boasted the successful testing of an ICBM with an impressive range. Coupled with the US's failed launch of the Titan ICBM that month, a sense of Soviet superiority in missile technology became prevalent.\n\nNational Intelligence Estimate (NIE) 11-10-57, issued in December 1957, predicted that the Soviets would \"probably have a first operational capability with up to 10 prototype ICBMs\" at \"some time during the period from mid-1958 to mid-1959.\" The numbers started to inflate.\n\nA similar report gathered only a few months later, NIE 11-5-58, released in August 1958, concluded that the USSR had \"the technical and industrial capability... to have an operational capability with 100 ICBMs\" some time in 1960 and perhaps 500 ICBMs \"some time in 1961, or at the latest in 1962.\"\n\nBeginning with the collection of photo-intelligence by U-2 overflights of the Soviet Union in 1956, the Eisenhower administration had increasingly-hard evidence that strategic weapons estimates favoring the Soviets were false. The CIA placed the number of ICBMs to be closer to a dozen. Continued sporadic flights failed to turn up any evidence of additional missiles. Curtis LeMay argued that the large stocks of missiles were in the areas not photographed by the U-2s, and arguments broke out over the Soviet factory capability, in an effort to estimate their production rate.\n\nIn a widely syndicated article in 1959, Joseph Alsop even went so far as to describe \"classified intelligence\" as placing the Soviet missile count as high as 1,500 by 1963, while the US would have only 130 at that time.\n\nIt is known today that even the CIA's estimate was too high; the actual number of ICBMs, even including interim-use \"prototypes\", was 4.\n\nIn 1958, Kennedy was gearing up for his Senate re-election campaign and seized the issue. The \"Oxford English Dictionary\" lists the first use of the term \"missile gap\" on 14 August 1958, when he stated, \"Our Nation could have afforded, and can afford now, the steps necessary to close the missile gap.\" According to Robert McNamara, Kennedy was leaked the inflated US Air Force estimates by Senator Stuart Symington, the former Secretary of the Air Force. Unaware that the report was misleading, Kennedy used the numbers in the document and based some of his 1960 election campaign platform on the Republicans being \"weak on defense.\" The missile gap was a common theme.\n\nEisenhower refused to refute the claims publicly for fear that public disclosure would jeopardize the secret U-2 flights. Consequently, Eisenhower was frustrated by what he conclusively knew to be Kennedy's erroneous claims that the United States was behind the USSR in its number of missiles.\n\nIn an attempt to defuse the situation, Eisenhower arranged for Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson to be apprised of the information, first with a meeting by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, then Strategic Air Command, and finally with the Director of the CIA, Allen Dulles, in July 1960. Still, Kennedy continued to use the same rhetoric, which modern historians have debated as likely being so useful to the campaign that he was willing to ignore the truth.\n\nIn January 1961, McNamara, the new secretary of defense, and Roswell Gilpatric, a new deputy secretary, who strongly believed in the existence of a missile gap, personally examined photographs taken by Corona satellites. Although the Soviet R-7 missile launchers were large and would be easy to spot in Corona photographs, they did not appear in any of them. In February, McNamara stated that there was no evidence of a large-scale Soviet effort to build ICBMs. More satellite overflights continued to find no evidence, and by September 1961, a National Intelligence Estimate concluded that the USSR had no more than 25 ICBMs and would not possess more in the near future. \nThe missile gap was greatly in the US's favor. Satellite photographs showed the Soviets had 10 operational ICBMs, the US 57. According to Budiansky, the SS-6 and SS-7 missiles \"took hours to fuel and had to have their unstable liquid propellant drained every thirty days to prevent them from blowing up on the launch pad; the new U.S. Minuteman missile, entering final testing, was powered by solid propellant and could be launched in minutes.\"\n\nDuring a transition briefing, Jerome Wiesner, \"a member of Eisenhower's permanent Science Advisory Committee... explained that the missile gap was a fiction. The new president greeted the news with a single expletive \"delivered more in anger than in relief\"\n\nKennedy was later embarrassed by the whole issue; the 19 April 1962 issue of \"The Listener\" noted, \"The passages on the 'missile gap' are a little dated, since Mr Kennedy has now told us that it scarcely ever existed.\"\n\nDuring McNamara's first press conference, three weeks into his new role as Secretary of Defense, he was asked about the missile gap. According to Budiansky, McNamara replied, \"Oh, I've learned there isn't any, or if there is, it's in our favor.\" The room promptly emptied as the Pentagon press corps rushed to break the news.\n\nNow the president, Johnson told a gathering in 1967:\n\n\"I wouldn't want to be quoted on this... We've spent $35 or $40 billion on the space program. And if nothing else had come out of it except the knowledge that we gained from space photography, it would be worth ten times what the whole program has cost. Because tonight we know how many missiles the enemy has and, it turned out, our guesses were way off. We were doing things we didn't need to do. We were building things we didn't need to build. We were harboring fears we didn't need to harbor.\"\n\nWarnings and calls to address imbalances between the fighting capabilities of two forces were not new, as a \"bomber gap\" had exercised political concerns only a few years earlier. What was different about the missile gap was the fear that a distant country could strike without warning from far away with little damage to themselves. Concerns about missile gaps and similar fears, such as nuclear proliferation, continue.\n\nPromotion of the missile gap had several unintended consequences. The R-7 requires as much as 20 hours to be readied for launch so they could be easily attacked by bombers before they could strike. That demanded them be based in secret locations to prevent a pre-emptive strike on them. As Corona could find the sites no matter where they were located, the Soviets decided not to build large numbers of R-7s and preferred more-advanced missiles that could be launched more quickly.\n\nLater evidence has emerged that one consequence of Kennedy pushing the false idea that America was behind the Soviets in a missile gap was that Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev and senior Soviet military figures began to believe that Kennedy was a dangerous extremist, who worked with the American military to plant the idea of a Soviet first-strike capability to justify a pre-emptive American attack. That belief about Kennedy as a militarist was reinforced in Soviet minds by the Bay of Pigs invasion of 1961, which led to the Cuban Missile Crisis after the Soviets placed nuclear missiles in Cuba in 1962.\n\nA second claim of a missile gap appeared in 1974. Albert Wohlstetter, a professor at the University of Chicago, accused the CIA of systematically underestimating Soviet missile deployment in his 1974 foreign policy article, \"Is There a Strategic Arms Race?\" Wohlstetter concluded that the US was allowing the USSR to achieve military superiority by not closing a perceived missile gap. Many conservatives then began a concerted attack on the CIA's annual assessment of the Soviet threat.\n\nThat led to an exercise in competitive analysis, with a group called Team B being created with the production of a highly controversial report.\n\nAccording to Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, the USA had a six-to-one advantage in the number of nuclear warheads over the USSR by 1976.\n\nA 1979 briefing note on the National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) of the missile gap concluded that the NIE's record on estimating the Soviet missile force in the 1970s was mixed. The NIE estimates for initial operational capability (IOC) date for MIRVed ICBMs and SLBMs were generally accurate, as were the NIE predictions on the development of Soviet strategic air defenses. However, the NIE predictions also overestimated the scope of infrastructure upgrades in the Soviet system and underestimated the speed of Soviet improvement in accuracy and proliferation of re-entry vehicles.\n\nNIE results were regarded as improving but still vague and showed broad fluctuations and had little long-term validity.\n\nThe whole idea of a missile gap was parodied in the 1964 film \"\" in which a doomsday device is built by the Soviets because they had read in \"The New York Times\" that the US was working along similar lines and wanted to avoid a \"Doomsday Gap.\" As the weapon is set up to go off automatically if the USSR is attacked, which occurs as the movie progresses, the president is informed that all life on the surface will be killed off for a period of years. The only hope for survival is to select important people and place them deep underground in mine shafts until the radiation clears. The generals almost immediately begin to worry about a \"mine shaft gap\" between the US and Soviets. In reference to the alleged \"missile gap\" itself, General Turgidson mentions off-hand at one point that the United States actually has a five-to-one rate of missile superiority against the USSR. The Soviet ambassador himself also explains that one of the major reasons that the Soviets began work on the doomsday machine was that they realized that they simply could never match the rate of American military production (let alone, outproduce American missile construction). The doomsday machine cost only a small fraction of what the Soviets normally spent on defense in a single year.\n"}

In 1974, Jenrette was a visiting lecturer at the Taft Political Institute at Trinity University. In 1975, she was Opposition Research Director of the Republican National Committee, under the chairmanship of Mary Louise Smith.\n\nIn 1977, Jenrette worked as a research associate at the Office of Technology Assessment under the co-chairmanship of Senators Hubert H. Humphrey and Edward M. Kennedy. She co-authored a report with Ray Hoehle on the Food for Peace program, which was presented to the Presidential Commission on World Food Hunger.\n\nIn 1978, Jenrette was picked by the \"Washington Post\" Sunday magazine as one of four dynamic young women of Washington, D.C. On September 10, 1976, she married freshman Democratic whip John Jenrette of South Carolina, 18 months after meeting him on Capitol Hill.\n\nShe was also a Clairol model.\n\nHer husband John was convicted for taking a bribe during the Abscam investigation in October 1980. She appeared on the \"Phil Donahue Show\" and he called in live to join the conversation. At his trial, she testified in her husband's defense.\n\nSubsequently, she alerted authorities to $25,000 she found in her husband's closet, saying it was part of the Abscam money.\n\nShe gave an interview to \"Playboy\" that appeared in the April 1981 issue, accompanied by a nude pictorial. The article's revelation that she and her husband had sex on the steps of the U.S. Capitol during a break in an all-night House session caused a hoopla. She claimed that the couple were still \"happily married\" at the time the \"Playboy\" pictorial was photographed, although they had separated by the time it was published.

{"id": "2266267", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2266267", "title": "Black Colossus", "text": "Black Colossus\n\n\"Black Colossus\" is one of the original short stories starring the fictional sword and sorcery hero Conan the Cimmerian, written by American author Robert E. Howard and first published in \"Weird Tales\" magazine, June 1933. Howard earned $130 for the sale of this story.\n\nIt's set in the pseudo-historical Hyborian Age and concerns Conan leading the demoralized army of Khoraja against an evil sorcerer named Natohk, \"the Veiled One.\"\n\nThis story formed part of the basis for the later Conan novel, \"The Hour of the Dragon\".\n\nAn ancient wizard named Thugra Khotan is awoken from his 3,000 year slumber by Shevatas, a Zamoran thief (he doesn't survive the experience). Soon, Thugra remembers his dream of world domination. He assumes the alias of Natohk (The \"Veiled One\"), assembles an army of desert nomads, and begins his strategy on conquering the Hyborian nations. However, the tiny kingdom of Khoraja - with a mixed Hyborian/Shemite population, culture, and religion - stands in his way. Khoraja is presently ruled by the beautiful Yasmela, sister of the king, who is now a prisoner in neighboring Ophir. In fear of Natohk's potential invasion, Yasmela seeks advice from the long-forgotten god of her ancestors, Mitra. Eventually, Yasmela is told to travel into the streets and offer her kingdom's defenses to the first man she meets.\n\nFortunately, the first man she encounters is Conan the Cimmerian. Conan already has a position in Yasmela's army. Now, he's given full command over Khoraja's royal military, much to the confusion of his more cultured comrades. Soon, Conan demonstrates his knowledge in military tactics by defeating an entire caravan of bandits. However, Conan's efforts are ridiculed by the arrogant officers below him who fall victim to Natohk's magic. Meanwhile, Natohk has made it clear conquering the world isn't the only goal on his agenda: He also desires Queen Yasmela for himself.\n\nThe story climaxes with an epic battle. Conan defeats Natohk's army and the wizard devises a final attempt in capturing Yasmela. Conan goes after Natohk and confronts him near the ruins of a Stygian temple.\n\nThe story marks an important stage in the career of Conan. Due to the direct intervention of Mitra, Conan - who had never commanded more than a \"company of cut-throats\" - is given the opportunity to become a general and emerge victorious from an epic battle involving tens of thousands of soldiers while affecting the future of the whole world. Though Conan's career would know many more ups and downs, this was an important step towards him eventually becoming a King - which is hinted in the story itself, and which Howard and his readers already knew since \"The Phoenix on the Sword\" was already published half a year earlier.\n\nAt the climax of Leonard Carpenter's \"Conan the Great\" - taking place many years later, when Conan has already become King of Aquilonia - it's revealed that Conan's relationship with Yasmela resulted in the secret birth of a son, which Conan never knew about at the time, and his child eventually became the king of Koth. This revelation has a crucial importance in the plot of Carpenter's book.\n\nThe expression: \"A short life and a merry one\", used by the character Amalric in Howard's story, is attributed to the Australian bushranger Steve Hart (1859 – 1880).\n\n\"Black Colossus\" was first published in \"Weird Tales\", June 1933.\n\nA version of the story that was edited by L. Sprague de Camp was first published in the collection \"Conan the Barbarian\" (Gnome Press, 1954). It was then republished in several collections entitled \"Conan the Freebooter\" (Lancer Books, 1968; Sphere, 1974; Prestige, 1977; Ace, 1981) and \"The Conan Chronicles\" Volume 1 (Sphere, 1989).\n\nThe original version was first republished in \"Black Colossus\" (Grant, 1979). It has more recently been published in the collections \"The Conan Chronicles Volume 1: The People of the Black Circle\" (Gollancz, 2000), \"\" (Del Rey, 2003), \"The Weird Writings of Robert E. Howard\" Volume 1 (Girasol Collectables, 2006), \"The Complete Chronicles of Conan\" (Gollancz, 2006), \"Valley of the Worm\" (Wildside Press, 2006) and \"Three Tales of Conan the Barbarian\" (Echo Library, 2007).\n\nThe story was adapted in comics form by Roy Thomas, John Buscema, and Alfredo Alcala in 1974, in the B&W Marvel Comics magazine \"Savage Sword of Conan\" #2. \"Black Colossus\" also forms the basis of part of \"Conan the Barbarian\" #248 and all of 249. (Conan serves as a mercenary captain for Khoraja, fighting rebels and Natohk's Stygian allies, in #246 and 247.)\n\nThe Savage Sword comics adaptation was reprinted in full color in the large sized \"Marvel Treasury Edition\" #15 in 1977.\n\nIn 2008, the Marvel adaptation was reprinted in black and white in the Savage Sword of Conan trade paperback published by Dark Horse.\n\nIn 2009, Timothy Truman and Tomas Giorello adapted the story in Dark Horse Comics' \"Conan the Cimmerian #8-13\".\n\n"}
