{"id": "2036104", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2036104", "title": "Nina Tucker", "text": "Nina Tucker\n\nNina Tucker is a fictional character from the Australian soap opera \"Neighbours\", played by Delta Goodrem. She made her first screen appearance during the episode broadcast on 11 June 2002. Goodrem was approached by producers after they saw her video for her debut single. Goodrem, who had just signed a record deal, almost turned down the role of Nina as she felt the character did not suit her style of music. The role was rewritten for her and she joined the cast. A year later, she was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma and had to leave the show for treatment. Once her health improved, she made a return to \"Neighbours\" in 2004 to tie up Nina's storylines. In 2005, \"Neighbours\" celebrated its 20th anniversary with an episode that featured many ex-cast members, in which Goodrem reprised her role as Nina once more. She returned again in March 2015 for the show's 30th anniversary.\n\nNina was originally written as a bad girl character, but when the writers rewrote the role for Goodrem, she became a painfully shy school student who was described as being the \"quintessential girl-next-door\". Nina learned to be independent from an early age as she was travelling with her parents all over the world. She has a complicated relationship with her mother, who she sees as an embarrassment to her. In 2004, her personality underwent a change, and she was no longer shy; she had grown up and had become more assured. Goodrem's manager suggested that Nina should be an aspiring singer and \"Neighbours\" developed the character to suit her. Goodrem worked with the writers to incorporate her music into the show. One of Nina's longest running storylines was her relationship with Jack Scully (Jay Bunyan). They began their relationship while they were seeing other people and they break up twice. However, Nina realises that she loves Jack and returns from India to tell him. Goodrem believed Nina and Jack were soulmates. Nina was well received, and Goodrem won the Most Popular New Female Talent Logie Award for the role.\n\n\"Neighbours\" approached Goodrem about appearing in the show after they saw the video for her debut single, \"I Don't Care\"; she was offered the role of Nina Tucker in early 2002. Goodrem almost turned down the part because she was not happy with the character written for her. She had just signed a record deal with Sony Records and felt the part did not suit her music. The \"Neighbours\" producers agreed to rewrite the role of Nina for her.\n\nIn July 2003, Goodrem was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma and was forced to leave the show to begin treatment. Goodrem was written out of \"Neighbours\", and script producer, Luke Devenish, said: \"She had to concentrate on her health, so there was no getting around it. There was absolutely no question of attempting to keep her working.\" Nina departed in October 2003, with an exit storyline that allowed for a return in the future. Three months' worth of scripts were rewritten, and a new character, Carmella Cammeniti (Natalie Blair), was created and introduced to cover Nina's planned storyline with Connor O'Neill (Patrick Harvey).\n\nIn March 2004, it was announced that Goodrem would be returning to \"Neighbours\" to finish her contract. Of her return, a spokesperson said \"We never thought we'd see her back. Her illness stunned us all and her vastly improved health now thrills us. We can't wait for the days she's back on the set. This is where it all started for her.\" Goodrem told \"TV Week\" that it was important to her to tie up Nina's storylines and added: \"I really felt that Nina and myself had a lot of unfinished business there.\" Due to Goodrem's busy schedule, the producers made sure all her scenes were shot in three days. She returned to screens in Australia on 6 September.\nGoodrem was one of many ex-cast members who returned to \"Neighbours\" in 2005 for an episode that celebrated the 20th anniversary of the show. Goodrem said that she \"couldn't be happier\" about going back to \"Neighbours\".\n\nNina was initially meant to be a \"bad girl\", but the writers rewrote the part for Goodrem, and the character became a \"painfully shy schoolgirl\" who gets a job in the Coffee Shop. \"The Age\" described Nina as the \"quintessential girl next door\". Goodrem described her character as \"a quiet, unassuming type of girl\", who did not think anything of her amazing gift. When Goodrem was asked if she was similar to Nina, she replied \"I think I am in some ways and in some ways I'm not. Nina's very shy, I really like the character Nina but I think she'd probably walk out of a room and I'd probably chat all day I think that's probably the difference, she'd sneak out of a room and I'd stay!\" The BBC agreed with Goodrem and said that Nina would not say \"boo to a goose\" and would flee if anyone looked her way.\n\nIn 2003, Nina's mother, Trixie (Wendy Stapleton), arrived in Erinsborough after Nina's father, Nick, ended their relationship. Nina was upset to learn about her parents split and went into denial. She believed that they would get back together. Trixie was a professional singer and, during a set at Lou's Place, started to lose confidence, so Nina helped her out and saved the night. Stapleton stated that Nina and Trixie's relationship was complicated, and there were issues between them. Nina saw Trixie as an embarrassment, but she helped her out because she saw how sad her mother was. Stapleton explained more about Nina's early life saying, \"Nina's life has been almost a gypsy one – living out of a suitcase while her parents toured. She's learned to be independent from an early age, though Trixie idolises her.\" Nina retreated into books and her imagination instead of being worldly from the travelling she has done. Stapleton and Goodrem did not get a chance to explore their respective character's relationship much further, as Goodrem was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma three weeks into the storyline. Scripts were changed so Nina was not directly involved and she was only mentioned by other characters.\n\nWhen she returned in 2004, Nina was no longer shy and vulnerable. She had taken control of her life and became more assured. Goodrem welcomed her character's development and said Nina came back strong and confident. She also said: \"I think she had to grow up. If she didn't come back a little bit older and wiser, then she wouldn't have learnt and grown from what's gone on in the year that she's been missing.\"\n\nGoodrem's manager, Glenn Wheatley, suggested making Nina into an aspiring singer. He said: \"We didn't want that soap star-turned-singer vibe but how cool would it be if she already was a singer? \"Neighbours\" developed a character to suit her rather than the other way around.\" Goodrem worked with the writers to incorporate her music into the show, and Wheatley used the exposure that \"Neighbours\" gave Goodrem to relaunch her singing career. Nina had a powerful voice and wrote her own songs, but she was too shy to sing them in public. Harold Bishop (Ian Smith) discovered Nina's singing talent one day, and Connor entered one of her songs, \"Born To Try\", in a talent contest at UniFM, where it won. As Nina was too shy to go and receive the prize, Tahnee Coppin (Anna Jennings-Edquist) tried to take credit for the song instead. Connor stopped her and Nina overcame her shyness to sing her song. Within weeks of it being performed, \"Born to Try\" became the number one single in Australia.\n\nNina was in her first relationship with fellow student Taj Coppin (Jaime Robbie Reyne), when, during a trip away to the beach, Jack Scully (Jay Bunyan) realised he was attracted to her. When Nina was cast in Harold's play, \"Mission Erinsborough\", alongside Jack, she realised that she liked him too and they begin an affair. Peter Mattessi of \"The Age\" said their love \"bubbled until it almost erupted\". Nina broke up with Taj so she could be with Jack, but before Jack could break up with his girlfriend Lori Lee (Michelle Ang), she was paralysed during an accident. Jack became torn over whether to leave Lori and be with Nina. Both Lori and Taj found out about Nina and Jack, so Nina decided to remain single, but eventually she and Jack began their relationship properly. When Nina told Jack that she was not ready to consummate their relationship, Jack cheated on her with Edwina Valdez (Lucia Smyrk). Taj told Nina about Jack's cheating and she broke up with him. She later kissed Connor in front of Jack to make him jealous. Jay Bunyan commented, \"Jack gets really angry, especially with Connor, who is supposed to be his mate. He threatens to tell Nina about Connor getting Lori pregnant, as a way of getting back at him.\" Nina became confused about her love life and was unsure whether she still had feelings for Jack. She then decided to depart Erinsborough to go to India.\n\nIn 2004, Nina returned to win Jack back, after becoming an actress in the Indian film industry and realising that she was alone. Goodrem told \"TV Week\", \"she's been doing wonderful things in Bollywood and has been with her dad. But she was missing the love of life back in Australia, so she came back.\" Nina's arrival coincided with Jack's decision to get his life back together following a car crash due to his partying. Jack was \"shocked\" and \"overwhelmed\" to see Nina. Goodrem explained that Nina reminded him of what he once had and that he still had feelings for her. She said that she believed Jack and Nina were soul mates and added: \"They have had a very rocky relationship, but I think they're even now.\" As Jack and Nina talked things through, they \"fall back into each other's arms\". Jack chose to leave Erinsborough to be with Nina.\n\nOn 25 November 2014, it was announced that Goodrem had agreed to reprise her role for \"Neighbours\" 30th anniversary celebrations. Goodrem began filming that day and tweeted her excitement about Nina making a guest appearance. Her return featured during three episodes starting from 16 March 2015. Series producer Jason Herbison confirmed that the theme of music would tie into the character's return. It was later confirmed that Nina returns to Erinsborough after her relationship with Jack ends. Goodrem said she understood what her character was going through, saying \"I have experienced the feelings Nina is going through. I've had those moments where you question where you are going and you have to look back to know where to move forward.\" The singer and actress said her return to \"Neighbours\" felt \"natural\" and she instantly knew what Nina would be wearing the moment she went into wardrobe.\n\nAlana Wulff from \"TV Week\" reported that Nina would check into Lassiter's Hotel under a fake name, in order to stay incognito during her return. However, she is soon spotted by Lou Carpenter (Tom Oliver) and Susan Kennedy (Jackie Woodburne), who agree to keep her return a secret. This allows Nina to revisit her favourite haunts and reminisce about her time in Erinsborough. Goodrem told Wulff, \"She's walking around feeling nostalgic. And seeing where life was so simple before everything went down with her.\" Nina even fills in for one of the maids at the hotel, which makes her feel \"normal\" again. When Paul Robinson (Stefan Dennis) see Nina, he asks her to perform at the Erinsborough Festival's closing concert, but she turns him down. However, Lou persuades her to change her mind, believing the concert will make her feel better about her life and break up with Jack.\n\nNina enrolls at Erinsborough High after her school work suffers because she has been travelling the world with her parents, Nick and Trixie. Nina is shy and concealed as a result of her neglect by her parents. Nina takes up two jobs at the Coffee Shop and at Lassiter's Hotel. The residents of Ramsay Street begin to notice that she is shy and has low self-esteem. One night, Harold Bishop hears Nina singing and realises that she is good, but Nina disagrees. Harold manages to convince Nina to join the church choir, and she is asked to perform a solo, but her nerves get to her and is not able to go through with their performance. Connor O'Neill also overhears Nina singing one day and becomes close with her, as he is the only teenager who knows about her talent.\n\nTahnee Coppin forces Nina to admit that she is in love with Connor and then threatens to tell his girlfriend, Michelle Scully (Kate Keltie). Nina records a song called \"Born to Try\", which is heard by Connor. He secretly enters the song into UniFM's undiscovered talent contest. Nina is angry with Connor at first but tells her that he did it for her so she could realise her potential. Nina's song wins the contest, but she is too shy to come forward, and Tahnee takes the credit instead. Connor takes Nina to the station and she admits that she wrote and sang the song. Nina then overcomes her fears to sing \"Born to Try\" for the crowd, which upsets Tahnee. Nina's prize is to sing at a nightclub; afterwards, she is approached by Glenn Wheatley, but she turns down his offer.\n\nNina asks out Taj Coppin, after he sends her text messages, and they begin a relationship. Nina and Jack Scully are pushed into auditioning for roles in Harold's new play, and they have to perform a kiss on stage. As they went on rehearsing, they begin to get closer to each other, and they start an affair. Nina breaks up with Taj, but before Jack can break up with Lori Lee, she has an accident. Jack eventually tells Lori about Nina, and when Nina tries to apologise, Lori tells her that she will not be forgiven. Nina then tells Jack that they cannot be together. Nina sticks up for Tahnee when she is being bullied, and they become friends. Nina and Jack get back together, but when Jack tries to take things further, Nina tells him she is a virgin. Jack tells her that he is willing to wait.\n\nTalent manager Melody Jones (Robyn Arthur) approaches Nina and asks her to sign with her. Nina forges her mother's signature on the forms and gets a regular singing gig at Lou Carpenter's pub. Nina leaves for a tour of Asia, but when she gets back she hears another singer singing one of her songs on the radio. Nina is told that she signed the rights to her music away, but Lou points out that the contract is not valid as Nina forged a signature on it. Nina sleeps with Jack for the first time, but when Taj tells her that Jack cheated on her with Edwina Valdez, their relationship ends. Nina starts getting closer to Connor and, to make Jack jealous, kisses Connor at the Lassiter's Ball.\n\nNina's mother, Trixie, arrives in town, and Lou gives her a singing job at his pub as he fancies her. Nina is upset to learn that Trixie and Nick are no longer together, and, when Trixie tells her that she was not married to her father, Nina leaves for Bombay to see Nick. Trixie and Lou later marry. Nina returns a year later after becoming an actress in Bollywood. She goes to see Jack and tells him that she wants to be with him. She also visits Lou and gives him some money, as Trixie had left him bankrupt. Lyn Scully (Janet Andrewartha) tells Nina that Jack needs to stay in Australia so he can sort himself out. Nina performs her last concert at Lou's Place, and she tells Jack that she will wait for him. Months later, Jack flies out to Los Angeles to be with Nina.\n\nIn 2015, Nina returns to Erinsborough. She checks into Lassiter's under a false name, and catches up with Lou and Susan. Nina goes for a walk around the town and Ramsay Street, reminiscing about her time there. She later offers to be a chambermaid at the hotel, after seeing how short staffed Terese Willis (Rebekah Elmaloglou) is. Nina tries to avoid Paul Robinson, who wants her to play at the Erinsborough Festival. She admits to Karl and Susan that she and Jack have split up, which has affected her song writing. Nina eventually finds inspiration to write a song, but she refuses Paul's offer to play at the festival, so Karl is offered the chance to be the closing act. Nina changes her mind after Lou encourages her to take a chance, while Karl fakes a sore throat. Jack later sends her a text, telling her that he likes her new song and he asks her to meet him in Florence. Lou reveals to Nina that he sent Jack a video of her performing, and she thanks him, Karl and Susan, before leaving town to meet Jack.\n\nFor her portrayal of Nina, Goodrem received the Most Popular New Female Talent accolade at the 2003 Logie Awards. She also earned a nomination for Best Newcomer at the \"Inside Soap\" Awards. The following year, Goodrem was nominated for Most Popular Actress and Most Popular Personality at the Logie Awards. A writer for the BBC's \"Neighbours\" website said Nina's most notable moment was \"Cheating on Taj with Jack Scully\".\n\nTo celebrate \"Neighbours\"' 25th anniversary, Sky included Nina in their list of the twenty-five most memorable \"Neighbours\" characters. They stated, \"Nina represents just about the only recognisable name from the lost years of \"Neighbours\" in the early noughties, as one of the least successful groups of teens in the programme's history. Remember Lori? Or Michelle? Or, Lord help us, Taj? In the absence of any usable characters, the writers did that always uncomfortable thing of letting a character get up and sing on screen. Repeatedly.\" They described her most memorable scenes as being discovered singing by Harold, her mother's marriage to Lou, and her relationship with Jack.\n\n\"TV Week\" named Nina's passion for singing as one of \"Neighbours\"' \"most exciting storylines ever\". They said: \"When it was discovered she could sing, Nina Tucker was transformed from shy highschool student into a star performer and a bit of a heart-breaker. This was cut short when Delta was diagnosed with Hodgkin's disease, leaving us in the lurch and wondering about her love affair... triangle... quadrangle!\" \"TV Week\" later included Nina in their \"Top 25 \"Neighbours\" characters\".\n\n"}
{"id": "2036118", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2036118", "title": "Cultural lag", "text": "Cultural lag\n\nThe term cultural lag refers to the notion that culture takes time to catch up with technological innovations, and the resulting social problems that are caused by this lag. In other words, cultural lag occurs whenever there is an unequal rate of change between different parts of culture causing a gap between material and non-material culture. Subsequently, cultural lag does not only apply to this idea only, but also relates to theory and explanation. It helps by identifying and explaining social problems to predict future problems in society. The term was first coined in William F. Ogburn's 1922 work \"Social Change with Respect to Culture and Original Nature\".\n\nAs explained by James W. Woodward, when the material conditions change, changes are occasioned in the adaptive culture, but these changes in the adaptive culture do not synchronize exactly with the change in the material culture, this delay is the culture lag. If people fail to adjust to the rapid environmental and technological changes it will cause a lag or a gap between the cultures. This resonates with ideas of technological determinism, which means that technology determines the development of its cultural values and social structure. That is, it can presuppose that technology has independent effects on society at large. However it does not necessarily assign causality to technology. Rather cultural lag focuses examination on the period of adjustment to new technologies. According to William F. Ogburn, cultural lag is a common societal phenomenon due to the tendency of material culture to evolve and change rapidly and voluminously while non-material culture tends to resist change and remain fixed for a far longer period of time. This is due to the fact that ideals and values are much harder to change than physical things are. Due to the opposing nature of these two aspects of culture, adaptation of new technology becomes rather difficult. This can cause a disconnect between people and their society or culture.This distinction between material and non-material culture is also a contribution of Ogburn's 1922 work on social change. Ogburn's classic example of cultural lag was the period of adaptation when automobiles became faster and more efficient. It took some time for society to start building infrastructure that would tailor mainly to the new, more efficient, vehicles. This is because people are not comfortable with change and it takes them a little time to adapt. Hence, the term cultural lag.\n\n\"Social Change with Respect to Nature and Original Change\" is a 1922 work by sociologist William F. Ogburn. This work was crucial in drawing attention to issues with social changes and responses. In this work he first coined the term 'cultural lag' to describe a lag between material and non-material cultures. Ogburn states that there is a gap between traditional cultural values and the technical realities in the world. This work was innovative at the time of its release and brought light to the issues of 'cultural lag' and the possible solutions that could fix these issues. This was not the first time these issues have been looked at, but this is the first time that real solutions were presented. Ogburn's theory was not widely accepted at first due to people having different interpretations of the work. In the book he also details the four factors of technical development, which are: invention, accumulation, diffusion, and adjustment. In the work he suggests that primary engine of change and progress is technology, but that it is tempered by social responses. The book had mixed a mixed response due to the fact that many interpreted his findings in many different ways.\n\nIn \"Social Change with Respect to Nature and Original Change,\" renowned sociologist William F. Ogburn coins the term 'cultural lag'. Ogburn states his thesis of cultural lag in this work. He says that the source of most modern social change is material culture. His theory of cultural lag suggests that a period of maladjustment occurs when the non-material culture is struggling to adapt to new material conditions. The rapid changes material culture force other parts of culture to change, but the rate of change in these other parts of culture is much slower. He states that people live in a state of 'maladjustment' because of this. Ogburn makes claims that he played a considerable role in solving the issue of social evolution. He goes on to say that the fours solving factors of social evolution are: invention, exponential accumulation, diffusion, and adjustment. This work was unique and innovative at the time of its publication.\n\n\"On Culture and Change\" is a work by William F. Ogburn which is a collection of 25 works from the years 1912–1961. It is an examination of social change and culture from the perspective of a sociologist. The 25 topics discussed in the work are separated into four topics: social evolution, social trends, short-run changes, and the subjective in the social sciences. This collection of works examines culture and social change in the world. The findings and information in \"On Culture and Change\" continues to be influential and useful to this day.\n\nIn \"Future Shock,\" Alvin Toffler outlines the shattering stress and disorientation that rapid change people feel when they are subjected to too much change in too short of a time. Toffler says that society is undergoing a transformation from an industrial society to a \"super-industrial\" society. He states that this accelerating rate of change is causing people to feel disconnected from the culture. Toffler argues that balance is needed between the accelerated rates of change in society and the limited pace of human response. Toffler says that it is not impossible to attempt to slow or even control the rapid change and that it is possible for the future to arrive before society is ready for it. Toffler says that the only way to keep equilibrium would be to create social and new personal regulators. Strategies need to be put in place so that rapid culture change can be shaped and controlled. \n\nIn \"Cultural Lag: Conception & Theory,\" Richard & June Brinkman go into what the theory and concept of cultural lag actually is. They go into detail about the points supporting and the points disputing the concept of cultural lag. They evaluate Ogburn's claims about cultural lag and make them more understandable. The work evaluates the existence of cultural lag and its ability to possibly predict and describe cultural change in society. The work also goes into the relevance of the concept of cultural lag to socioeconomic policies in the world.\n\nMaterial and non-material culture both are a big part of the theory of cultural lag. The theory states that material culture evolves and changes much quicker than non-material culture. Material culture being physical things, such as technology & infrastructure, and non-material culture being non-physical things, such as religion, ideals, and rules. Non-material culture lags behind material culture because the pace of human response is much slower than the pace of material change. New inventions and physical things that make people's lives easier are developed every single day, things such as religions and ideals are not. This is why there is cultural lag, if there is an invention created that goes against people's ideals it will take some time in order for them to accept the new invention and use it. \n\nMaterial culture is a term used by sociologists that refers to all physical objects that humans create that give meaning or define a culture. These are physical things that can be touched, feel, taste, or observe with a sense. The term can include things like houses, churches, machines, furniture, or anything else that a person may have some sentimental for. The term can also include somethings that cannot be seen but can be used. Things like the internet and television are also covered under the material culture definition. Material culture changes rapidly and changes depending where in the world somebody is. The environment may present different challenges in different parts of the world that is why material culture is so different everywhere. For example, houses in the heart of Tokyo are going to be smaller than the houses in Austin, Texas. \n\nNon-material culture is a term used by sociologists that refers to non-physical things such as ideas, values, beliefs, and rules that shape a culture. There are different belief systems everywhere in the world, different religions, myths, and legends that people may believe in. These non-physical things can be information passed down from past generations or new ideas thought up by somebody in today's world. Non-Material culture tends to lag behind material culture due to the fact that it is easier to create a physical object that people will use than it is to create a system of beliefs or ideals that people will use and follow. Non-material culture tends to be very different wherever in the world someone is. This is because people from different backgrounds and areas in the world were raised on different ideals and beliefs that help shape society and culture. \n\nCultural lag creates problems for a society in a multitude of ways. The issue of cultural lag tends to permeate any discussion in which the implementation of some new technology is a topic. For example, the advent of stem cell research has given rise to many new, potentially beneficial medical technologies; however these new technologies have also raised serious ethical questions about the use of stem cells in medicine. In this example, the cultural lag is the fear of people to use a new possibly beneficial medical practices because of ethical issues. This shows that there really is a disconnect between material culture (Stem cell research) and non-material culture (Issues with ethics). Cultural lag is seen as an issue because failure to develop broad social consensus on appropriate applications of modern technology may lead to breakdowns in social solidarity and the rise of social conflict.\n\nAnother issue that cultural lag causes is the rise of social conflict. Sometimes, people realize that they are disconnected with what is going on in society and they try to do everything they can to get back into the loop. This may result in a race to eliminate the cultural lag. For example, in the 1980s the arms race was in full effect. This is partly because one country discovered how to efficiently and safely use the widely thought unsafe nuclear power/energy. Once the United States was able to successfully harvest nuclear energy into a weapon many other countries realized that maybe nuclear energy isn't that bad and started to build weapons of mass destruction of their own.\n\nIssues can also arise when an aspect of culture changes so rapidly that society is unable to prepare or adjust to it. This is seen in the example of cars overtaking other modes of transportation in the past. Since the production and ownership of cars increased so rapidly society was unable to keep up with it. Broader roads, traffic rules, and separate lanes for horses did not come until some time after automobiles became a part of the mainstream culture. This caused dangerous situations for pedestrians and the people driving these new automobiles. Sometimes society is not ready for the future and this could cause dangerous situations for certain people or groups of people. \n\n\n\n"}

He has also made albums as a solo performer and with Willie Murphy.\n\nKoerner grew up in Rochester, New York, and after a brief military service attended the University of Minnesota. He intended to major in engineering but soon became involved in the Minneapolis music scene, where he met Dave Ray and Tony Glover. They formed a loose-knit trio, releasing albums under the name Koerner, Ray & Glover. The group gained notice with their first album, \"Blues, Rags and Hollers\", originally released by Audiophile in 1963 and re-released by Elektra Records later that year.\n\nKoerner was an early influence on Bob Dylan, who mentioned Koerner in his autobiography, \"Chronicles\". Speaking of the early 1960s, Koerner later said, \"We were all goofy, you know. We were thinkers and drinkers and artists and players, and Dylan was one of us. He was another guy.\"\n\nIn 1965, Koerner recorded his first solo album, \"Spider Blues\", for Elektra and appeared at the Newport Folk Festival accompanied by Glover. He continued playing on the folk circuit and joined with Willie Murphy to record \"Running, Jumping, Standing Still\" in 1969. The duo eventually split up, and Koerner pursued an unsuccessful career in filmmaking, retiring from music and moving to Copenhagen, Denmark. He later returned to music in the traditional folk genre and continued to perform and release new albums from time to time. He now lives in Minneapolis and has two sons and a daughter.\n\nIn 1983 the Minnesota Music Academy named Koerner, Ray and Glover \"Best Folk Group\" and in 1985 inducted them into the MMA Hall of Fame.\n\nIn 2008, Koerner, Ray & Glover were inducted into the Minnesota Blues Hall of Fame under the category Blues Recordings for \"Blues, Rags and Hollers\".\n\nKoerner, Ray & Glover has been honored with a star on the outside mural of the Minneapolis nightclub First Avenue, recognizing performers that have played sold-out shows or have otherwise demonstrated a major contribution to the culture at the iconic venue. Receiving a star \"might be the most prestigious public honor an artist can receive in Minneapolis,\" according to journalist Steve Marsh.\n\n\n"}

The mirrors support dirty region logging (DRL, called resync regions in DiskSuite) and logging support for RAID-5.\n\nThe ZFS file system, added in the Solaris 10 6/06 release, has its own integrated volume management capabilities, but SVM continues to be included with Solaris for use with other file systems.\n\n\n"}

The account of his participation in the discovery is disputed by some historians.\n\nHe was a son of \"Micer\" Filippo Pallastrelli (called Filipe Perestrello in Portugal), a Lombard knight who came to Portugal some say erroneously in the train of Queen Leonor of Aragon and here he was a Nobleman of John I of Portugal, who recognized his Coat of Arms and made him a Nobleman of Coat of Arms in 1433; he was married to Caterina Visconti (of the Visconti of Verona not from the ones of Milan), with whom he came to Portugal in 1385, and granted, in 1437, two houses at the Sub-Ripas Street in the City of Coimbra. He was the son of \"Micer\" Gabriele Pallastrelli, a Lombard nobleman from Piacenza, and second wife Bertolina Bracciforti.\nNobleman and Fidalgo-Esquire of the House of Infante João, Lord of Reguengos and master of the Portuguese Order of Saint James (Santiago), he was granted in 1446, as a hereditary fief (capitania), the island of Porto Santo and, together with his fellow fleet commanders, started the colonization of the islands.\n\nOne of his daughters, Filipa Moniz Perestrelo (born c. 1455), around 1479 married Christopher Columbus, who lived in Madeira and Porto Santo.\n\nA legend attributes the responsibility for the poor vegetation of Porto Santo to him. On his first disembarkation in the island he brought one pregnant doe-rabbit that escaped and its progeny overran the island in a few years. In fact, the island was poor in water, and what seemed to be a good enterprise for him became the cause of his family financial ruin.\n\nHe married four times, firstly to Margarida Martins, without known issue, secondly with Branca Dias, fathering Branca Dias Perestrello, lady-in-waiting to Eleanor of Aragon, Queen of Portugal, and mistress of Dom Pedro de Noronha (Castle of Gijón, 1379 – August 20, 1452), 4th Archbishop of Lisbon (1424–1452), by whom she had issue, including D. Pedro de Noronha, Lord Chamberlain to King John II of Portugal. Thirdly in 1446 to Brites Furtado de Mendonça, (aunt of King John II's mistress Ana de Mendonça) and had issue including Izeu Perestrelo, wife of Pedro Correia, First Captain of Graciosa Island in the Azores and one of King John II's twenty-five bodyguards. His fourth marriage to Isabel Moniz also had issue, including Filipa, one of the 12 \"Comendadoras\" of Santiago, who married Columbus, Violante who married Miguel Molyarte and lived in Seville, Spain and Bartolomeu Perestrelo II, Third Captain of Porto Santo.\n\nHe was the brother of Rafael Perestrello, head of the Perestrellos of Torres Vedras. He also had two sisters: Catarina Perestrello, married to Aires Anes de Beja, \"Escrivão da Puridade\" (a Secretary) of John I of Portugal.\n\n\n"}

According to IPC's standard J-STD-012, \"Implementation of Flip Chip and Chip Scale Technology\", in order to qualify as chip scale, the package must have an area no greater than 1.2 times that of the die and it must be a single-die, direct surface mountable package. Another criterion that is often applied to qualify these packages as CSPs is their ball pitch should be no more than 1 mm. \n\nThe concept was first proposed by Junichi Kasai of Fujitsu and Gen Murakami of Hitachi Cable in 1993. The first concept demonstration however came from Mitsubishi Electric.\n\nThe die may be mounted on an interposer upon which pads or balls are formed, like with flip chip ball grid array (BGA) packaging, or the pads may be etched or printed directly onto the silicon wafer, resulting in a package very close to the size of the silicon die: such a package is called a wafer-level package (WLP) or a wafer-level chip-scale package (WL-CSP). WL-CSP had been in development since 1990s, and several companies begun volume production in early 2000, such as Advanced Semiconductor Engineering (ASE).\n\nChip scale packages can be classified into the following groups:\n\n"}

Versions of the character have appeared on the animated series \"Batman Beyond\" and \"The Batman\".\n\nSpellbinder (Delbert Billings) first appeared in \"Detective Comics\" #358 (December 1966), and was created by John Broome and Sheldon Moldoff. He was a painter who used optical illusions and hypnotic weapons to commit crimes.\n\nDelbert was a forger of pop art who decided to put his talents to use as a supervillain. He created the Spellbinder identity, designed hypnotic weapons, and assembled a team of henchmen. He ran into Batman during his first robbery, but hypnotized the crimefighter into believing he was involved in an entirely different situation, as his gang made their getaway. This ploy worked twice, but on his third robbery, Batman was able to overcome it and send him to jail.\n\nAfter leaving prison, Spellbinder faced off with Superman in \"Superman\" #330 (1978). Using a miniature turntable, he was able to create sonic blasts that would make targets more susceptible to his hypnotic suggestions. The addition of a shock absorbing chin-guard to his helmet protected him from being knocked out by Superman, and special lenses protected him from hypnosis by the Man of Steel. He was finally defeated when his own sonic blasts were echoed back on him (rendering him unconscious). This issue also revealed how Superman uses sub-conscious hypnosis (heightened by the Kryptonian lenses in his glasses) to successfully disguise himself as Clark Kent.\n\nSpellbinder joined a loosely knit conglomerate of crime organized by the Monarch of Menace. He was the first member of the group to be captured by Batman, who later disguised himself as Spellbinder to infiltrate the group and capture the Monarch.\n\nLater, Spellbinder was on the run from the law with his new girlfriend, Fay Moffit, when he was confronted by the demon-lord Neron. Neron offered a deal of immense power in exchange for Spellbinder's soul, but he declined. Fay, however, thought it sounded like a great idea, so she killed Spellbinder by shooting him in the head and took the deal for herself. Neron was not surprised and explained that he had never actually been addressing Spellbinder with the deal; he had been addressing \"her\" all along.\n\nA second Spellbinder appeared in \"Justice League International\" (vol. 2) #65 (June 1994), as a member of the government-sanctioned \"League-Busters\".\n\nDuring the \"Underworld Unleashed\" crossover event, Delbert Billings (the original Spellbinder) turned down Neron's deal of immense power in exchange for his soul and was shot in the head and killed by his girlfriend, Fay Moffit, who then took the deal for herself and became the third Spellbinder (also known as Lady Spellbinder).\n\nNeron granted her the ability to induce genuine hallucinations. She was followed by Batman and Robin, but they did not know the scale of her illusion-casting abilities, which extended to making absolutely everything disappear. She escaped from the heroes due to her ability to create a total illusion in her immediate vicinity, which remains even if they close their eyes. They realize that the only way to be able to approach her safely is if the approach is controlled by someone outside her immediate area of influence. Robin acts as Batman's eyes once Spellbinder is tracked down by the police, guiding him using a version of virtual reality technology. Once captured, Spellbinder discovers that her deal with Neron was not all she had hoped — if her eyes are covered or closed, her illusion-casting abilities no longer function.\n\nShe subsequently appeared in \"Birds of Prey\", where she created an illusory world in which Barbara Gordon was Batgirl (although she did not realize this had once been true). She had been hired by the Blockbuster to kidnap Barbara. Barbara was able to defeat the Spellbinder when she attacked Moffit with a fire extinguisher (to blind her and prevent her from casting illusions) and a club, and then tied her up and left her for the police.\n\nThe Spellbinder returned to \"Birds of Prey\" when the Black Canary and the Catwoman were kidnapped by the rogue Parademon Pharzoof. She was being transported with several other villains when their train was hijacked and taken to Apokolips. The villains battled the Parademons and eventually were returned to Earth, where they were taken to the Slab.\n\nThe Spellbinder returned again in the miniseries \"\". In \"Birds of Prey\" #36, she battles the Black Canary, who is trapped inside Slabside Penitentiary along with a host of villains infected by the Joker's Joker venom, making them even more crazed than ever. The Black Canary's sonic cry is able to give most of them pause, but the Joker sends the Copperhead and the Hellgrammite after her, as neither one of them have ears. After dealing with them, she is briefly confronted by the Shadow Thief before meeting, to her great relief, the Batman, Superman, and Mary Marvel. However, the Black Canary soon notices that Marvel's lightning bolt is backwards, and the heroes are revealed to be an illusion created by the Spellbinder, who was the first of the female villains infected by the Joker's Joker venom.\n\nThe Spellbinder was apparently killed alongside the Trigger Twins by a group of gun-toting superheroes during \"Infinite Crisis\". It is noted that she bears a striking resemblance (both physically and in terms of powers) to the mysterious fourth Harlequin. Although very similar, they are two separate characters.\n\nThe original Spellbinder used a number of optical and aural devices of his own invention to hypnotize others. His fighting skills were minimal.\n\nThe second unnamed Spellbinder had genuine mystical abilities. \n\nThe third Spellbinder, better known as Lady Spellbinder, can create terrifying realistic illusions, and the recipients can feel the actual pain of the illusions. If she is blinded or has her eyes closed or covered, she is unable to cast the illusions.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2036194", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2036194", "title": "Arabian-Nubian Shield", "text": "Arabian-Nubian Shield\n\nThe Arabian-Nubian Shield (ANS) is an exposure of Precambrian crystalline rocks on the flanks of the Red Sea. The crystalline rocks are mostly Neoproterozoic in age. Geographically - and from north to south - the ANS includes parts of Israel, Palestine, Jordan, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Yemen, and Somalia. The ANS in the north is exposed as part of the Sahara Desert and Arabian Desert, and in the south in the Ethiopian Highlands, Asir province of Arabia and Yemen Highlands.\n\nThe ANS was the site of some of man's earliest geologic efforts, principally by the ancient Egyptians to extract gold from the rocks of Egypt and NE Sudan. This was the most easily worked of all metals and does not tarnish. All of the gold deposits in Egypt and northern Sudan were found and exploited by Egyptians. The earliest preserved geologic map was made in 1150 BCE to show the location of gold deposits in Eastern Egypt; it is known as the Turin papyrus. New gold discoveries have been found in Sudan, Eritrea, and Saudi Arabia.\n\nPharonic Egyptians also quarried granite near Aswan and floated this down the Nile to be used as facing for the pyramids. The Greek name for Aswan, \"Syene\"; is the type locality for the igneous rock syenite. The Romans followed this tradition and had many quarries especially in the northern part of the Eastern Desert of Egypt where porphyry and granite were mined and shaped for shipment.\n\nPrecious and industrial metals, including gold, silver, copper, zinc, tin, and lead, have been mined in Saudi Arabia for at least 5,000 years. The most productive mine in Saudi Arabia, Mahd adh Dhahab (\"Cradle of Gold\"), has been periodically exploited for its mineral wealth for hundreds or even thousands of years and is reputed to be the original source of King Solomon's legendary gold. Today, mining at Mahd adh Dhahab is conducted by the Saudi Arabian Mining Company, Ma'aden. Deposits of iron, tungsten, mineral sands, copper and phosphates have been found in many locations. Mining in the Eastern Desert of Egypt and Sudan is limited due to shortage of water and infrastructure. One option would be to bring water from the Nile by pipeline.\n\nThe Arabian-Nubian Shield (ANS) is the northern half of a great collision zone called the East African Orogeny. This collision zone formed near the end of Neoproterozoic time when East and West Gondwana collided to form the supercontinent Gondwana. The East African orogeny extends southward to the Mozambique Belt, and is a subset of the overall Pan-African orogeny. The assembly of Gondwana coincided with the breakup of Rodinia, closure of the Mozambique Ocean, and growth of the shield at 870 Ma This shield growth extended for the next 300 Ma., and included island arc convergence and terrane suturing at 780 Ma, with final assembly by 550 Ma. At this time, the East African Orogen became a passive margin and the southern shore of the Paleo-Tethys Ocean.\n\nThe shield is divided into crustal blocks or tectonostratigraphic terranes delineated by ophiolite shear zones or sutures. These terranes are paired across the Red Sea, starting from the south, these include Nakfa (870-840 Ma) with Asir (785-720 Ma,850-790 Ma), Haya (870-790 Ma) with Jiddah (870-760 Ma), Gabgaba (735-700 Ma) and Gebeit (832-810 Ma) with Hijaz (870-807 Ma), and Eastern Desert (810-720 Ma) with Midyan (780-710 Ma). In addition the Halfa (2.6-1.2 Ga,750-718 Ma) and Bayuda (806 Ma) terranes are in the western portion of the shield, and the Hulayfah (720 Ma), Ha'il (740 Ma), Afif (750-695 Ma,840-820 Ma,1.86-1.66 Ga), Ad Dawadimi (695-680 Ma), and Ar Rayn (667 Ma) terranes in the eastern portion.\n\nKey amalgamation events, starting 780-760 Ma, with the formation of the Tabalah-Tarj Shear Zone, the gneiss Afaf Belt, and the 600 km long and 565 km wide Bi'r Umq and Nakasib Suture (780-760 Ma), an ophiolite-decorated fold-shear zone, between the Jiddah-Haya and Hijaz-Gebeit Terranes. Then between 750-660 Ma, the Atmur-Delgo Suture formed as Halfa Terrane ophiolite nappes were thrust onto the Bayuda Terrane. Simultaneously, the Allaqi-Heiani-Sol and Hamed-Onib-Yanbu Suture formed, consisting of nappes and portions of ophiolite along an east-trending shear zone between the Gebeit-Hijaz and Eastern Desert Terrane and Midyan Terranes. Between 680-640 Ma, the 600 km long and 5–30 km wide Hulayfah-Ad Dafinah-Ruwah Suture formed between the Afif Terrance and terranes to the southwest. Simultaneously, the Halaban Suture formed between the Afif and Ad Dawadimi Terranes as a nappe of Halaban ophiolite thrust westward. In addition, the Ar Amar Suture, consisting of the Al Amar Fault zone with ophiolite lenses, between the Ad Dawadimi and Ar Rayan Terranes, while the Nabitah Fault Zone formed in Asir Terrane. The final amalgamation event occurred 650-600 Ma, when the Keraf Suture, consisting of ophiolite folded and sheared rocks, formed between the Bayuda-Halfa and Gebeit-Gabgaba Terranes.\n\nPost-amalgamation events include the formation of the Huqf Supergroup (732-540 Ma) in Oman and W. Saudi Arabia, which accumulated in basement basins, the first 1100 m of which include glaciomarine deposits with diamictites and dropstones from the Sturtian and Marinoan glaciations. Gneiss belts and domes forming in the Late Neoproterozoic include the Kirsh gneiss in the Arabian shield and the Meatiq gneiss dome in the Eastern Desert. Late Neoproterozoic shear zones include the Hamisana Shear Zone (665-610 Ma), the Ar Rika- Qazaz Shear Zone (640-610 Ma) within the Najd Fault System, and the Oko Shear Zone (700-560 Ma).\n\nA number of features have been ascribed to late stage extensional tectonics including a widespread NE-SW trending dyke swarm, NE-SW trending normal faults and NW-SE trending sedimentary basins filled with post-orogenic molasse deposits\n\nCrustal weaknesses before 500 Ma influenced continental rifting, as the Arabian peninsula moved away from Africa, and the formation of the Red Sea Basin at the start of the Oligocene. By then, some of the Paleozoic and Mesozoic rocks had been eroded, if ever deposited. In fact, the 1200 km wide ANS orogenic belt, has a present-day layered crustal structure, with a uniform Moho depth of 35–45 km. Post-rift deposition of evaporites occurred until the Pliocene, when a marine environment took over.\n\nAs Rosemarie and Dietrich Klemm point out, \"...gold deposits exploited in antiquity occur almost exclusively in the Neoproterozoic sequences of the ANS in the Eastern Desert in Egypt and Northern Sudan.\" The shield in this part of Africa consists of a cratonic African basement or \"infrastructure\", overlain by a Pan-African overthrust \"superstructure\". The infrastructure consists of migmatite gneiss and gneiss domes such as Gebel Hafafit and Gebel Meatiq. The metamorphism is associated with overthrust tectonics, but bear no relationship to the ancient gold mines. The superstructure consists of an ophiolite-like sequences with island arc volcanics, Hammamat sediments, and post orogenic granites. The ophiolites range in age from 746-832 Ma and are mainly serpentites with elevated gold values of 25 ppb. The Hammamat sediments, common in Wadi Hammamat and referred to as \"bekhen\" stone, consist of greywackes and siltstones, which are slightly enriched in gold. The Hammamat sediments include dike intrusions and the dacite to rhyolite Dokhan volcanics, which formed in the early stages of orogeny at 600-625 Ma. These volcanics include the Roman imperial porphyry quarries. The granite intrusions include two sequences, an older one 614-709 Ma, and a younger sequence at 544-596 Ma, which includes the Aswan granite at 565 Ma. The margin of the includes granodiorite and diorite, and most importantly, auriferous quartz veins. These veins mineralized from hydrothermal flow inside tectonic extensional gaps, or within cavities from shearing. These characteristics were exploited by New Kingdom of Egypt prospectors. This is especially true for ancient gold exploitations oriented in NNW-SSE shear zones, such as the sites at Hammama, Abu Had-North, Wad Atalla el-Mur, Atalla, Umm el Esh Sarga, Fawakhir, El-Sid, Umm Soleimat and Hamuda.\n\nWadi el-Sid was the chief mining area for the New Kingdom of Egypt, with high gold grades of 30 grams per ton (g/t) in the mineralized quartz veins within sheared ophiolite sequences of serpentinite and metabasalt, imbricated with Hammamat sediments, in direct contact with the tonalite margins of the Fawakhir granite pluton. The ophiolite nappe dates from 850 to 770 Ma, while the Fawakhir pluton dates from 574 ma. These gold-rich veins are oriented according to post-tectonic extension, something the Egyptian prospectors understood.\n\nThe well of Umm el-Fawakhir area includes a Large Ptolemaic settlement and round stone mills dating from the Roman or Early Arab Period to the oval stone mills of the New Kingdom. Even fist hammers from the Old/Middle Kingdom are present. Tailings were reworked by the Louison Company from the 1930s until 1956.\n\n\n\n\n"}

After enjoying a successful career with Fulham, Tottenham Hotspur, and the England national team in the 1960s and 1970s, he became a manager working with several clubs. He is now employed as a television pundit. He is also famous for being the first ever England player to be sent off in an international match.\n\nAlan Mullery was a passing and defensive midfielder for Fulham (1958–1964, 1972–1976), Tottenham Hotspur (1964–1972) and England (1964–1971). He appeared in 364 games for Fulham (scored 37 goals), 312 for Tottenham Hotspur (scored 25 goals), and 35 for England (scored 1 goal).\n\nMullery was a key player for the Spurs teams that won the FA Cup in 1967, the League Cup in 1971, and the UEFA Cup in 1972. In the UEFA Cup Final, his header was the decisive goal in a 3–2 aggregate victory over Wolverhampton Wanderers. Mullery was in the Fulham team that lost the FA Cup final to West Ham United in 1975.\n\nMullery was an integral member of England's 1970 World Cup squad, playing in all the side's games in what proved a bitterly disappointing campaign. England, the defending champions, lost 3–2 to West Germany in the quarter-finals after having been up 2–0 in the second half. In that game Mullery scored England's first goal, the only time he tallied for his country.\n\nPlaying primarily as a deep midfielder, Mullery did not get many goals. Two he did score (the 1970 World Cup strike against West Germany; a 1973–74 volley from outside the penalty area against Leicester City, voted the BBC's goal of the season) are well known and still talked about decades later.\n\nIn a 1968 European Championship game against Yugoslavia, Mullery committed a foul against Dobrivoje Trivić, and became the first England player to be sent off in a full international match.\n\nMullery was Brighton & Hove Albion manager between 1976 and 1981, and took the club from the third tier to the top flight of English football. When Mullery was appointed manager of Brighton's biggest rivals Crystal Palace in 1982, it prompted anger and a short-lived boycott from some of the Palace fans.\n\nMullery became QPR manager in 1984 and guided the club to a 7–0 aggregate win over KR Reykjavik in the 1st round of the 1984–85 UEFA Cup, but he was then involved in an extraordinary 2nd round UEFA Cup tie against FK Partizan. In the first leg, which was played at Highbury because of UEFA's ban on the artificial plastic pitch at Loftus Road, QPR beat Partizan 6–2, despite being 2–1 behind at one stage and down to ten men after QPR defender Warren Neill was sent off. In the second leg, Partizan won 4–0 in Belgrade to win the tie on away goals. Partizan's victory is, to date, one of only three occasions in the history of European competition where a team has overturned a four-goal first-leg deficit.\n\nMullery's QPR side were also involved in an extraordinary home league match in September 1984 against Newcastle United. At half-time Newcastle were 4–0 up after a hat-trick from Chris Waddle. But QPR came back after the break to draw the match 5–5. Mullery was sacked after six months in charge at Loftus Road just hours after QPR had beaten Stoke. In 1985, Mullery said that his time at QPR \"turned me into a monster\". He suggested that the players couldn't overcome their disappointment that Terry Venables had left the club. Mullery blamed what he called \"the moaning, groaning bunch of players who treated me, themselves and their profession with contempt\" for killing his love of football.\n\nAfter leaving QPR, Mullery stayed out of football management for 18 months until the summer of 1986, when he took over for a second spell as manager of Brighton. He lasted seven months before being sacked in January 1987. Mullery said of his sacking by Brighton: \"You love the game, then it kicks you in the guts.\"\n\nIn the early 1990s, Mullery coached ATM FA in the Malaysian Premier League. He later served Barnet as Director of Football during 1996–1997.\n\nMullery had a brief stint as manager at Sussex non-league side Southwick F.C. He has worked for a number of years as a pundit for Sky Sports, and in September 2005 also briefly took a role with Conference club Crawley Town as a 'football consultant'.\n\nAfter leaving QPR, Mullery entered into a deep depression, worsened by an unsuccessful business venture; he converted to Christianity, though his financial and emotional troubles continued until he began working in the media in the mid 1990s. Mullery is a Conservative.\n\n"}

It is part of a line of granite crests that also includes the Le Croisic peninsula, Dumet Island, Houat, Quiberon and Groix.\n\nHœdic is a low, undulating plateau, 800 meters wide by 2500 meters long. Its peak, at an altitude of 22 metres, is located in the middle of its eastern part, on the road that leads from the village to the hamlet of the Phare. The island's base consists essentially of granite and less often of schists. The coast is an alternation of sandy coves and rocky points of variable height, generally more marked to the north (Beg Lagat, the Old Castle) than to the south (Beg Er Faut, Kasperakiz). There are two marshes, one modest, behind the dune of the new harbor, the other, about twenty hectares behind the dune of the old port. In addition to the main island, the town has several small islands including Roc'h Melen, Madavoar, Cardinals, Mulons ...\n\nHœdic has long been associated with familial polyculture of livestock and crops--that is, in farms owned by people and families rather than heavily industrialised farms--along with their fishing resources. The former disappeared in the middle of the 20th century, while the latter had a second wind in the 1980s but is currently in decline. Currently, Hœdic is largely dependent on tourism, even more significantly than its neighbour Houat. Similarly to Houat, the majority of its land is being invaded by brush.\n\nHœdic is a car-free island with around 100 inhabitants in the wintertime. During summer, its population can reach 3,000 including boaters, tourists and campers coming to the island. The island is connected to the mainland via Compagnie Océane boats year-round and Compagnie des Iles boats during the tourist season (connections from Quiberon).\n\nInhabitants of Hœdic are called \"Hœdicais\".\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2036204", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2036204", "title": "Götheborg (ship)", "text": "Götheborg (ship)\n\nGötheborg is a sailing replica of the Swedish East Indiaman \"Götheborg I\", launched in 1738 (not to be confused with the larger \"Götheborg II\" built some decades later). All sailors survived when the original ship sank off Gothenburg, Sweden, on 12September 1745, while approaching the harbour on her return from a third voyage to China. Construction of the replica started in 1995, with the hull launched in 2003, and the rig fully tested for the first time in 2005. Much of the time was spent researching how to rebuild the replica. In 2008, \"Götheborg\" completed the first \"Baltic Sea Tour\". It is one of the world's largest operational wooden sailing vessels.\n\nThe Swedish East India Company was established on 14June 1731, to trade in East Asia. The company followed the Portuguese, Dutch, Danish, French and English East India Companies. Situated in Gothenburg, the company secured a 15-year monopoly on far eastern trade, exchanging Swedish timber, tar, iron and copper for tea, porcelain and silk.\n\nThe company existed for 82 years and its vessels made 131 voyages using 37 different ships. Even though the company in the end went bankrupt, it made enormous profits during most of its years in operation and influenced the history of Sweden in several ways.\n\n\"Götheborg\" was built at the in Stockholm and launched in 1738. According to writer Björn Ahlander, it only took about one and a half years to build a ship of this size in the 1700s. It was built in the Swedish capital and named \"Götheborg\" because the Swedish East India Company resided in Gothenburg, and all expeditions began and ended at this port. The ship had a tonnage equivalent to about . On its maiden voyage in 1739, the ship carried 30 cannons and an initial crew of 144.\n\nThe ship made three journeys to China and in 1745, it sank on its way into Gothenburg harbor. After 30 months at sea, and with only to go before the vessel reached its berth, it crashed into the Knipla Börö, a well known rock. Although it remains a mystery how this could happen theories abound. The ship remained stranded on the rock while much of the cargo, consisting of tea, porcelain, spices and silk was salvaged. The ship was clearly visible above the surface of the water for many years, but in time the remains sank to the bottom.\n\nIt is still unclear what caused the ship to run aground due to the scarcity of contemporary written sources. The \"Götheborg\" had a very experienced pilot on board, Caspar Matthisson (1712–1783) from Brännö, who had been a pilot for seven and a half years at the time of the accident. Even so, the ship suddenly ran aground, or crashed into, the underwater rock the \"Hunnebådan\"—in the 18th century known as the \"Knipla Börö\" and later the \"Götheborgs-grundet\" (\"the Götheborg's rock\") or the \"Ostindiebådarna\" (\"the East India shallow\").\n\nThe joint statement by captain Eric Moréen and the crew to the \"Göteborgs Rådhusrätt\" (\"the Municipal Court of Gothenburg\") on the 19September 1745 states that the weather on 12September was fair and clear, the wind amenable and blowing from south-west or west-southwest. These were ideal conditions since the wind would be coming almost straight from aft. Crossing the \"Rivöfjorden\" the ship met with the current from the northern part of Göta älv, \"Nordre älv\". Navigation and sailing seems to have been correct up until the time of the accident. Sailing at a speed of the ship suddenly veered to starboard and hit the rock. The cause may have been a now almost forgotten hydrographic phenomenon called dead water.\n\nHydrographic conditions at the mouth of the Göta älv in September 1745, are well known. The discharge of the Göta älv was unusually large due to heavy snowfall during the winter of 1744–45. The water level of Lake Vänern was also extremely high in 1745. These factors combined into an increase in the volume of fresh water flowing into the \"Älvsborgsfjorden\", affecting the layers of fresh and salt water, making the conditions for dead water very favorable on 12September 1745. It may be that the \"Götheborg\" was suddenly trapped by dead water when making its final change of course, causing the ship to lose rudder function, go off course and run aground.\n\nIn 9December 1984, five members from the \"Marinarkeologiska Sällskapet, Göteborgskretsen\" (MASG) (\"the Marine Archeological Society of Gothenburg\") dove at the Hunnebådan, the site of the shipwreck. One of the participants, Anders Wästfelt chairman of the MASG, wrote in his report: \"Fair weather, sun, in the air. Northwesterly wind . Water temperature . Weak currents. Visibility in the water: Depth , visibility . Depth , visibility about . Depth , visibility about . Dives made between 12:00 a.m. and 1:00 p.m. … We picked up 38 pieces of porcelain. Three of these were almost undamaged. These were found on the softer sediments of the bottom. All the finds were on the bottom. No digging or use of a water eductor was done. The finds have been submitted to the Gothenburg Maritime museum.\"\n\nLots of porcelain shards were found strewn over the sea floor. In 1986, research in archives and examination of the wreck site had confirmed the find as the ship Götheborg from 1738, and the Gothenburg Maritime museum was given permission from the Swedish National Heritage Board to excavate the site. At the same time the \"East Indiaman Götheborg Foundation\" (the first foundation) was established, marking the beginning of one of Sweden's most comprehensive marine archeological surveys at the time. The purpose of the excavation was, among others, to use the wreck of the \"Götheborg\" as base for spreading knowledge about the history of Gothenburg and the significance of the Swedish East India Company during the 1700s.\nThe excavations were carried out during the summers 1986–1992. The seabed was first investigated using sub-bottom and side scan sonar. Secondly the divers went over the site with metal detectors and probes. To facilitate the excavations, the search area, measuring , was divided into a grid system comprising boxes measuring . The divers also had two giant suction devices, which sucked up sludge and clay into large sieves, where the smallest finds could be sorted. The remains of the cargo and the ship had settled during the years, together with fine clay, into a thick carpet, hard to penetrate. A total of 5,750 finds were registered during the excavation. Most of it was porcelain, blue and white, blue and white with brown glaze, and multicolored made to order. In addition to this the finds also consisted of tea, mother-of-pearl shells, galangal, pepper, silk fabric, ingots of \"tutanego\" (these contained 99% zinc, 0,5% iron) not to be confused with paktong, cannonballs, lead shots, rapier handles, sword hilts, rigging material and objects belonging to the officers and crew. When compared to the Company's cargo list, which had been preserved, the finds from the excavation made up almost 10 per cent of the original cargo.\n\nDuring the excavations the thought of building a replica of the \"Götheborg\" started to form among the divers who had found the ship. The decision to excavate and rebuild the ship has generated large interest over the years from researchers, volunteers, professionals, sponsors and the public. Knowledge about 18th century history, trade with China and the Swedish East India Company has thereby increased substantially.\n\nWhen the wreckage of the vessel \"Götheborg\" was found in 1984, the idea to make a replica of the vessel emerged. The keel for the replica was laid on 11June 1995. This was done at the disused Eriksbergs wharf by the Göta älv in Gothenburg. Led by Master of Ceremonies Anders Wästfeldt, two silver coins, one from 1745, and one from 1995, were placed in the halved joints of the long keel. About 3,000 people attended the forging of the keel, including Sören Gyll, director of Volvo and professor Jorgen Weibull. The project was blessed by the vicar Alf Österholm.\n\nThe construction and historical design of the ship was made by Joakim Severinsson. The blueprints for the ship was approved by international classification society Det Norske Veritas in November 1995. All that was left of the Eriksbergs wharf were two-thirds of building berth number six, the large gantry crane and the dry dock. Around this, a new shipyard for building the \"Götheborg\" began to grow. A new ship's hall was built over the building berth, a timber workshop, a forge, a rigging workshop with a sail loft and some modern facilities such as a restaurant, offices and conference rooms were also added to the site. Since the wharf was built on reclaimed land, it seemed very apt to call it Terra Nova (\"new land\" in Latin) just like the wharf where the original vessel had been built.\n\nThe vessel was built using old, traditional techniques, and it was made as close to the original as possible. One small change was that the headroom of the deck was increased by 10 cm, since today's seamen are taller than their ancestors.\n\nWhile the exterior remains true to the original, the interior is highly modern. The ship has an electrical system and propellers powered by diesel engines. The engines were only intended for port navigation and emergency situations, but they have been used during unfavourable wind in order to keep the timetable for the journey to China. Other enhancements include satellite navigation, communications equipment, modern facilities for the crew (kitchen, lavatories, washing machines, desalination equipment, ventilation, refrigerators), watertight bulkheads and fire protection (fire sprinkler systems, fire hydrants etc.). Most of this new technology was necessary to pass national and international safety regulations.\n\nThe vessel was launched on 6June 2003, with great festivities and in the presence of representatives from the Swedish Royal Family.\n\nTen tons of hemp ropes were used for rigging the vessel, together with some 1,000 blocks and linen sail. All this was produced using 18th century techniques. The first trial under sail began on 18April 2005.\n\nAt its completion in 2005, the project had cost about 250 million SEK (almost $40 million), some 40% from public funds and the rest from sponsors.\n\nDuring the years the ship has been in the care of two foundations. The first foundation consisted of Volvo, SKF, Stena Line and the Port of Gothenburg among others. This foundation financed the ship up until the end of the journey to China and in 2010, its economical commitment ended. The second foundation, a non-profitable foundation, for the ship was created shortly afterwards. The business is operated by The Swedish East India Company Ltd. In January 2011, questions were raised about the future of the ship. The Gothenburg Municipality was willing to pay for the ongoing maintenance of the ship if sponsors made contributions for the expeditions and other activities. An immediate liquidation of the operation and turning the ship into a museum was also suggested. In February 2011, the future plans for the ship were postponed by the Västra Götaland Regional Council.\n\nIn August 2019, the Greencarrier Group announced they would be supporting and funding \"Götheborg's\" future sailing ventures. There are plans for the ship to sail to several different ports around the world, as well as taking part in different sailing events. There have also been talks of a new expedition to China.\n\nThe correct name for the replica of the ship is the \"Götheborg III\". It is a replica of the \"Götheborg I\" which sank outside Gothenburg in 1745. A second ship the \"Götheborg II\" was built in Gothenburg in 1786. It was the largest of all the SOIC vessels and it made three journeys to Canton: 2February 1788–13May 1790, 13November 1791–12June 1793, and on 5December 1795, the ship sailed for Canton but was lost at Cape Town on 8March 1796, on the way out from Gothenburg.\n\nWhen leaving its home port the original ship could have over 130 crew members. This number of hands was necessary since many of the sailors died from diseases or disappeared during storms. Even though it was a high risk job under difficult conditions, the company did not have any problems recruiting sailors for these well paid jobs. Many of the recruits were poor young men, sons of farmers, seeking opportunity to become wealthy. The replica has a crew of 80 sailors.\n\nThe East Indiaman \"Götheborg\" is classified as a passenger ship sailing under the ordinary Swedish flag. But when in port, the ship is entitled to fly the old swallowtailed version of the flag, the SOIC flag (\"Svenska Ostindiska Companiet\", \"Swedish East India Company\"), that the original vessel sailed under.\n\nThe flag used on Swedish boats is the ordinary, rectangular flag. Swedish warships, or ships carrying a military commander, fly the Swedish ensign a triple-tailed or swallowtail and tongue version of the rectangular flag. The Swedish East India Company displayed a fork-tailed or swallow-tailed flag on their ships. The intention was that the ship should resemble a warship and thereby not attract pirates. This was against the rules and regulations for flags at that time. The use of the swallowtail was prohibited in a royal decree in 1751, but the SOIC ignored this and ordered their flags in Canton instead. In a memorandum to the Riksdag in 2012, a proposition was made to a grant dispensation from the prohibition. The proposition was declined and the decree is still in effect.\n\nAfter various tests and achieving its safety certificates from Det Norske Veritas, the vessel sailed for China in October 2005, as the original vessel did, but it did not follow the same route. The vessel berthed at the Victoria and Alfred Waterfront in Cape Town, and then left for Hout Bay before continuing on its voyage. The voyage took some 18 months, and the crew of 80 were rotated during harbour stops. The vessel returned to Gothenburg on 9June 2007, welcomed by the president of China, Hu Jintao, who visited Sweden mainly for this reason, and by the King and Queen of Sweden, Carl Gustaf and Silvia. The ship was also welcomed by thousands of private boats, and a hundred thousand spectators on shore.\n\nAmong the harbours visited were Cádiz, Recife, Cape Town, Hong Kong, Singapore and Shanghai. The total legs with cities visited and distances are listed below.\n\n\nThe route to China approximately followed the original 18th century route (around the south end of Africa), with an added detour to Australia (although in the 18th century, the ships usually avoided ports to avoid pirates). The journey home took a shortcut through the Suez Canal, which did not exist in the time of the original vessel.\n\nStopovers.\nStopovers.\nStopovers.\n\nStopovers.\nStopovers.\n\nThe Swedish postal service issued four stamps depicting the \"Götheborg\" on the 4October 2003.\n\n\n"}

Arcade games typically are designed to be used in a universal cabinet design. The supergun provides this universal interface in a greatly reduced size, allowing arcade games to be tested or enjoyed without needing the entire cabinet. Superguns frequently resemble video game consoles which plug into a television or monitor, and have detached joysticks and play arcade boards as if they were large cartridges. Some superguns are a large box with two arcade controllers side by side, resembling the top of a typical arcade cabinet.\n\nA SuperGun contains the inner workings of a standard arcade videogame cabinet inside a small plastic or metal box. A SuperGun plugs into a JAMMA board and provides native RGB video output, usually through an SCART connector. As the SCART connector is not common on televisions in North America, a supergun may also convert the RGB signal into composite video, S-video, Component Video or VGA signals, with varying degrees of quality. Sound is by default mono line level as this is the Jamma standard, but many games offer non-standard stereo. Sound output is usually by either 3.5mm, or phono sockets.\n\nWhile it is usually assumed that a supergun will automatically play JAMMA-compatible arcade boards, many systems support additional features not provided by JAMMA. The most common additional feature is wirings for extra buttons. This can be done with an extra set of wires that directly connect the supergun to the arcade board (called a \"kick harness\") or by wiring the extra buttons to some unused pins on the JAMMA connector itself. Regardless of the method used, these extra connections fall into the generic name JAMMA+. JAMMA only provides for three buttons per controller, but games requiring wiring for extra buttons have become common enough that many superguns support this out of the box as well.\n\nMany arcade systems that don't have a JAMMA compatible connector can be played via adaptors that plug in between the SuperGun's JAMMA interface and the arcade board itself.\n\nThere exist many non-standalone arcade systems in the form of motherboards that will accept games built into cartridges, for interchangeability. For example, to play an SNK Neo-Geo game such as Samurai Shodown, one would need to first plug an MVS board into the supergun (which must support four buttons, standard on MVS games) and then plug the MVS game into the MVS motherboard. Similarly, Capcom has the CPS-2 for its games.\n\nAlternatively, some modders may create one consolized arcade board, by adding the conversion components directly to the arcade board, rather than making a universal supergun for multiple boards. This process is most popular for boards that have interchangeable games, such as Neo Geo MVS and Atomiswave.\n\n"}

He was \"de facto\" the last Serbian medieval ruler. He was a participant in the battle of Ankara (1402) and Ottoman Interregnum (1403-1413). During his reign, the despotate was a vassal of both, Ottoman sultans as well as Hungarian kings. \nDespot George was neutral during the Polish-Lithuanian (1444) and Hungarian-Wallachian (1448) crusades. In 1455, he was wounded and imprisoned during clashes with the Hungarians, after which the young Sultan Mehmed II launched the Siege of Belgrade and its large Hungarian garrison. Despot Đurađ died at the end of 1456, due to complications stemming from the wound. After his death, Serbia, Bosnia and Albania (West Balkans) became practically annexed by sultan Mehmed II, which only ended after centuries of additional conquests of Byzantine lands.\nĐurađ attained a large library of Serbian, Slavonic, Latin, and Greek manuscripts. He made his capital Smederevo a centre of Serbian culture. He was the first of the Branković dynasty to hold the Serbian monarchy.\n\nHe was the son of lord Vuk Branković and Mara, the daughter of Prince Lazar Hrebeljanović. His wife, Eirene Kantakouzene, a granddaughter of Emperor John VI Kantakouzenos, was a Byzantine princess. Her brother Thomas was the commander of Smederevo.\n\nDespot Stefan had appropriated for himself properties that were part of the hereditary lands of Vuk, which resulted in Vuk joining the opposition. Vuk entered a pact with the Ottomans when Stefan had left Ottoman service and joined Hungary, fueling the domestic conflict between the two cousins; Vuk befriended Musa, only for revenge. The conflict went on for 10 years. Once reconciled, Stefan tried to make the most benefit of Đurađ, Vuk's son. Being childless, despot Stefan Lazarević made Đurađ his heir. When Đurađ succeeded Stefan, he was mature with rich experience, aged 50 in 1427.\n\nAt the time of the despot Stefan's death, George Brankovic was in Zeta (Montenegro), and Hungarian King Sigismund was in Wallachia. When they heard of the despot's death, they both headed to Belgrade Fortress. Negotiations around Belgrade lasted during September and October 1427. The surrender of the city was a condition that the Hungarian king to recognize George Brankovic as the new Serbian ruler. The State Assembly headed by Mr. George and Serbian Patriarch Nikanon decided to leave Belgrade to the Hungarians. King Sigismund planned for Belgrade and Golubac to be included in the new Hungarian defense system at the Danube frontier, which was based on border fortresses. Serbian duke Jeremiah of Golubac Fortress who was refus to recognased George as the new ruler, entered into negotiations with the Hungarian King Sigismund. He asked him for 12,000 ducats, which he allegedly gave to the late despot Stefan to own the city and as evidence, Jeremiah submitted a despot's letter, demanding that Sigismund pay him the said sum if he wanted Golubac. King Sigismund challenged the authenticity of the seal and the entire despot's letter, which Jeremiah submitted as evidence, refused to pay the claimed sum, and in late autumn, in December 1427, Jeremiah ceded the city to the Ottomans under the same conditions. The loss of Golubac was a major blow to King Sigismund as the Turks gained an important fortification on the Danube. King Sigismund decided to conquer the Golubac. In the early spring of 1428 he assembled an army and began a siege. Meanwhile, Sultan Murad II arrived with the army, who are in the battle defeating King Sigismund. After the Ottoman victory, George Brankovic and Duke of Wallachia Dan II recognized the sultan's suzerainty and according to an agreement they start to pay tribute. \n\nSince the Hungarians took over Belgrade and the Turks Golubac, despot George decided to build a new fortress and capital on the right bank of the Danube. The new Serbian capital Smederevo is planned to be located at the same distance between Hungarian Belgrade and Turkish Golubac and to separated them. Town was building gradually with great material and human renunciation. In the period from 1428 to 1430 a small town was built and a despot's court was housed there (curia domini despoti). Then the Great Town was built to protect the city settlement that developed along the despot's court. In the Great Town, addition to town houses there were churches, shops, warehouses, a shelter for the surrounding population. The works were led by the Romey Greeks brothers George and Thomas Kantakouzenos who for the project hired many Greek masons. In the summer of 1429, The Romey Emperor John VIII Palaiologos sent to George Philanthropenos with the task of crowning George Brankovic as the despot of Rascia (Serbia).\n\nOn May 31, 1433, King Sigismund was crowned at church of St. Peter in Old Rome for Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire. On April 20, 1434, George Branković's youngest daughter Katarina and Ulrich II of Celje were wed in the new fortress. This marriage stressed the friendly relations the Despot had with the Ottoman Porte, although Ulrich's kinship with the Queen of Hungary implied an increased Serbo-Hungarian alliance. As a result, Vizier Mehmet Saridže-pasha arrived in Smederevo in mid-1434 with a message from Sultan court of Edirne. It stated that Serbia's safety from the Ottoman Empire could only be guaranteed through the marriage of Branković's older daughter to Sultan Murad II. After much deliberation, the council convoked at the palace conceded, and arrangements were made for Mara to be engaged to the Sultan. That autumn, Murad sent several of his \"most famous viziers\" to retrieve his fiancée. Despot George was in a complex situation, King Sigismund thought he was Turkish and Sultan Murad II that he was a Hungarian marionette.\n\nOn August 14, 1435, a formal contract of \"brotherhood and friendship\" between Serbia and the Republic of Venice was signed in Smederevo's audience hall\n\nSultan Murad II heard that the Great Christian Coalition in Europa was preparing against the Turks. He was informed that a Serbian despot would join this coalition. In Fact, there was Great Council of Christendom in Florence. Despot George was sent envoys to Sultan Murad II who claimed that he was not break agreement and become pro-Hungarian. Anyway, Sultan Murad II decided to prevent it and conquer Serbia. In 1439, Sultan's army was sent to Serbia because Murad II decided to conquer as soon possible new Smederevo, Novo Brdo, and perhaps Hungarian Belgrade itself. According to source, he raised an army of 200,000 men (but the most realistic number is 60-70,000 men) and all ships on the great rivers. He sent one army to Novo Brdo, and with the other, the main one, which numbered about 130,000 men (probably 30,000 men), in late April or early May 1439 began the siege of Smederevo. After three months of siege, in early August 1439 Smederevo was fall. In Fact, defenders led by despot's son Grgur Brankovic and Thomas Kantakouzenos are remaining without food after which they dicide to open the town's gates to Muslims and on thet way prevent robbery and massacre. Meanwhile, the despot George went to exile on the camp of the Hungarian king Albert II. On the news of the fall of Serbia under Islam a fear was spread in Hungary. In the swampy part of the Danube frontier near Belgrade, King Albert fell ill of dysentery in September 1439. He died next month on the way to Vienna. Albert's death initiated a Hungarian Civil War, which lasted for twenty years (1439-1458) and ended only with the arrival of Matthias Corvinus on the Hungarian throne. In December 1439, as Hungarian magnate despot George was nominated his son Lazar for marriage to Elizabeth, who wanted to preserve the throne but was rejected because he was \"schismatic\". The more serious candidate was King of Poland Władysław III of the Lithuanian Dynasty of the Jegiellonian. At the beginning of 1440, Elizabeth gave her consent to the marriage with the young Władysław. Marriage with him would bring an alliance with Poland and an end to the conflict against Hungary (because it was known that Murad's deputies were in Poland who offered an alliance against Hungary). Meanwhile, in February 1440, Elizabeth gave birth to a son Ladislaus the Posthumous and then changed her mind about marrying with Władysław. On May 1440, the newborn baby is crowned with a stolen crown for the king. Then Elizabeth and her son took refuge to the German King Frederick III in Vienna. In the party that supported Ladislaus for the king, as the grandson of King Sigismund, they were George Brankovic, Nicholas of Ilok, Ladislaus Garai, Frederick II and Ulrich II of Celje. On the eve of the arrival of Władysław, despot George decided to leave Hungary. Despot George was offended that he, and especially his son Lazar, had missed the royal crown.\nThe Ottoman sultan reacted to the throne change, and the Hungarian influence which was felt more than he could afford, with sending an army into Serbia, which conquered Niš, Kruševac and besieged Novo Brdo. As to secure his prestige in Serbia, which had been weakened due to him, King Sigismund sent Despot Đurađ his own army. The combined army destroyed a large Ottoman detachment near Ravanica, for which effort the king on 19 November 1427 thanked especially Nicholas Bocskay. Another Ottoman detachment attacked neighbouring Serbian and Hungarian places from Golubac, especially the Braničevo region. Despot Đurađ himself went below Golubac and promised Jeremija forgiveness, and tried in every way to win back the city; not only did Jeremija decline, but he also attacked the despot's entourage which had tried to enter the city gates. In the spring of 1428 a new Hungarian army arrived at Golubac and besieged it from the land and from the Danube. The importance of the city is further evident from the fact that Sigismund himself led the army. But also Sultan Murat laid personal effort to encourage and support his acquired positions; in late May, after Sigismund, he arrived in the Braničevo area. Not wanting to enter combat with the superior Ottomans, Sigismund hastened to make peace. When the Hungarians in the first days of June began withdrawing, the Ottoman commander Sinan-beg attacked their back, where Sigismund was, however, with the self-sacrifice of Marko de Sentlaszlo, they were saved from disaster. During these conflicts, south and eastern Serbia were very devastated, including the developed Daljš Monastery near Golubac. From a monastery document, Sigismund is for the first time called \"Our Emperor\" (\"naš car\"), unlike the Ottoman sultan, who was called a pagan or non-Christian Emperor (\"car jezičeski\").\n\nWhen the Ottomans captured Thessalonica in 1430, Branković paid ransom for many of its citizens but could not avoid his vassal duties and sent one of his sons to join Ottoman forces when they besieged Durazzo and attacked Gjon Kastrioti.\nIn the beginning of Đurađ's reign, the Serbian capital was moved to Smederevo (near Belgrade) after he built a large fortress on the confluence of Danube and Jezava in 1430. After he was appointed as a successor to his uncle Stefan Lazarević, Branković's rule was marked by constant conflicts interchanging between Hungary and the Ottomans, as he temporarily lost Kosovo and Metohija in his early reign. Branković allied himself with the Kingdom of Hungary. In 1439 the Ottomans captured Smederevo, the Branković's capital. The prince fled to the Kingdom of Hungary where he had large estates, which included Zemun, Slankamen, Kupinik, Mitrovica, Stari Bečej, Kulpin, Čurug, Sveti Petar, Perlek, Peser, Petrovo Selo, Bečej, Arač, Veliki Bečkerek, Vršac, etc.\nDespot Branković traveled from Hungary to Zeta, accompanied with several hundred cavalry and his wife Eirene. He first went to Zagreb, to his sister Katarina who was a wife of Ulrich II, Count of Celje. Then he arrived to Dubrovnik at the end of July 1440 and after several days continued his journey toward his coastal towns of Budva and Bar which became new capitol of the remaining part of his despotate. In August 1441 Branković arrived to Bar where he stayed until the end of the winter 1440–41. There he tried to mobilize forces to recapture territory of the Serbian Despotate he lost to Ottomans. During his visit to Zeta he maintained communication with garrison in Novo Brdo. Branković faced another disappointment in Zeta where Crnojevići rebelled against Duke Komnen () the governor of Zeta. Branković left Zeta in April 1441. He first stayed in Dubrovnik which angered Ottomans who requested that Dubrovnik should hand over Branković. The Ragusans refused this request with the explanation that Dubrovnik is a free city which accepts anybody who seeks shelter in it. They also emphasized that it was better for Branković to be in Dubrovnik as this was the best guarantee that he would not undertake any action against the Ottomans.\n\nFollowing the conflicts that concluded 1443, Branković had a significant role in the Battle of Niš and Battle of Zlatica and consequently in facilitating the Peace of Szeged (1444) between Kingdom of Hungary and the Ottomans. Murad II, who also desired peace, was married to Branković's daughter Mara. On March 6, 1444, Mara sent an envoy to Branković; their discussion started the peace negotiations with the Ottoman Empire. This peace restored his Serbian rule, but Branković was forced to bribe John Hunyadi with his vast estates. On 22 August 1444 the prince peacefully took possession of the evacuated town of Smederevo.\n\nThe peace was broken in the same year by Hunyadi and king Władysław III of Poland during the Crusade of Varna, which culminated in the Battle of Varna. A crusading army led by Regent John Hunyadi of Hungary was defeated by Sultan Murad II's forces at Kosovo Polje in 1448. Đurađ had informed the Sultan of Hunyadi's coming crusade. This was the last concerted attempt in the Middle Ages to expel the Ottomans from southeastern Europe. Although Hungary was able to successfully defy the Ottomans despite the defeat at Kosovo Polje during Hunyadi's lifetime, the kingdom fell to the Ottomans in the 16th century. Branković also captured Hunyadi at Smederevo for a short time when he was retreating home from Kosovo in 1448, due to their personal feud.\n\nFollowing Hunyadi's victory over the Mehmet II at the Siege of Belgrade on 14 July 1456, a period of relative peace began in the region. The sultan retreated to Adrianople, and Branković regained possession of Serbia. Before the end of the year, however, the 79-year-old Branković died. Serbian independence survived him for only another three years, when the Ottoman Empire formally annexed his lands following dissension among his widow and three remaining sons. Lazar, the youngest, poisoned his mother and exiled his brothers, and the land returned to the sultan's subjugation.\n\nHis portrait in the illuminated manuscript of Esphigmenou (1429) depicts him with a mild beard, while the French nobleman Bertrandon de la Broquière who guested Đurađ in 1433 said of him \"nice lord and large [in person]\". He was deemed by contemporaries as the richest monarch in all of Europe; Broquière stated that his annual income from the gold and silver mines of Novo Brdo amassed to about 200,000 Venetian ducats. Among other sources of income, there were possessions in the Kingdom of Hungary, for which expenses were covered by the Hungarian crown. The annual income from them alone was estimated to 50,000 ducats.\n\nHe is included in SANU's \"The 100 most prominent Serbs\".\n\n\nĐurađ and Eirene Kantakouzene had at least six children:\n\n\n\n"}

It is primarily known as a seaside resort for French tourists during summer, and for its history of sardine production.\n\nQuiberon is connected to the mainland by a tombolo.\n\nDuring the Seven Years' War the bay was the site of the Battle of Quiberon Bay between the French and British fleets. In the French Revolution, in July 1795 Quiberon was used by French Royalist exiles, with assistance from the British, as the base for a failed invasion of Brittany (traditionally a royalist area). The invasion was defeated by the Revolutionaries under General Lazare Hoche.\n\nIn the 19th century, Nicolas Appert, a chemist, developed a technique that permitted the sterilization of food. Thanks to this process, Quiberon became the leading harbour for sardine fishing and the production of canned sardines in France. Many families from the Finistère \"département\" migrated to Quiberon for the fishing season (May to October). When the men put out to sea, the women worked in the sardine can factories.\n\nThe railway between Auray and Quiberon was inaugurated in 1882. It deeply changed Quiberon's way of life. Fishing, canning and the exploitation of seaweed has been replaced by tourism. At that time, some famous people went to Quiberon for a stay, including the writers Gustave Flaubert and Anatole France, and the actress Sarah Bernhardt. The year 1924 was important for the peninsula because it was classified as health resort. Now, the main resources for Quiberon come from tourism.\n\nDuring the Second World War, at the narrow isthmus (see photo) was occupied by the Germans and incorporated into the Atlantic Wall. It housed various blockhouses, but was mainly used by the infantry. In July 1944, 59 resistance fighters were tortured and buried alive there. A Cross of Lorraine mounted on a stone pillar, with a plaque listing the names of the fighters stands there in memory of them. Although the fort is still of military importance (as a training base), a gallery (tunnel) where the bodies were discovered can be visited.\n\n\n\nFrom September to July a bus service operates between Quiberon and Auray.\n\nQuiberon Aerodrome is open all year and accessible by private aircraft. The hard runway is 775m long and the tower staff speak both English and French on the radio.\n\nInhabitants of Quiberon are called \"Quiberonnais\".\n\nQuiberon is twinned with:\n\n3 Days in Quiberon (German: 3 Tage in Quiberon) is a 2018 drama film directed by Emily Atef and set in the town.\n\nQuiberon is the home of a professional Quidditch team operating within the fictional Harry Potter universe.

{"id": "2036241", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2036241", "title": "Rowhedge", "text": "Rowhedge\n\nRowhedge is a village in the Colchester borough of Essex, England. It is located just over southeast of Colchester town centre, and is part of the civil parish of East Donyland.\n\nRowhedge is on the right (west) bank of the tidal River Colne and is the first settlement downstream from Colchester. The small town of Wivenhoe is on the opposite bank, but slightly farther downstream; Fingringhoe is just to the south, on the opposite bank of the Roman River.\n\nThroughout the 20th century, Rowhedge and Wivenhoe were linked by a ferry. A barrier, similar to the one on the River Thames which shields London, was completed on the Colne in 1994. Rowhedge, Wivenhoe and Colchester all benefit from its protection from flooding.\n\nThe main thoroughfare in Rowhedge, the High Street, runs parallel to the Colne. At one time, it connected two areas of ship and boat construction and maintenance – the Upper Yard to the north, and the Lower Yard to the south. These were often known as 'Up Street' and 'Down Street' respectively. With the decline of ship building, housing estates have been built in both areas.\n\nThe history of Rowhedge is connected directly to the River Colne; ship or boat building and the crewing of many vessels go back to the nineteenth century, maritime pursuits in general even further. The Essex earthquake of 22 April 1884, damaged several buildings in the village, even shaking a man off his ladder while he was repairing the village's school clock. Colchester Rowing Club was established in the village in 1896 when the population was about 1,100.\n\nRowhedge could boast of its own brewery. A look at the map of the village at the turn of the nineteenth century on page 16 of Margaret Leather's book \"Saltwater Village\" (1977), reveals no fewer than six public houses; in 1970 there were four, now (2012), there are just two.\n\nIn response to a £1,000 prize being offered by the \"Daily Mail\" newspaper for the first Briton to fly a mile, an 'areohydroplane' (the term 'seaplane' was not yet in use), was designed and constructed by Jack Humphrey of Halstead in 1909. Several unsuccessful attempts at flight were made, both from the sea and land, after which the contraption was broken up; its floats ending their days in Rowhedge Ironworks in the Upper Yard.\n\nMany village inhabitants were involved in fishing for oysters and scallops that came from as far afield as the French, Belgian and Dutch coasts and the carrying of salmon and lobster from Ireland and Norway to Britain.<br>\nFishing for sprats could be a relatively worthless business. If there were too many 'good' catches, the Rowhedge smacks had little choice but to sail to their home village and off-load their fish, which might be sold for just a few pennies for manure in the nearby fields.\n\nOne of the pre-First World War village characters was John (Jack) Spitty – salvager (saving goods by removing them from ship-wrecks), pub licensee, fisherman and smuggler. His use of a bedroom in the \"Royal Oak\" public house when he was the licensee to hide boxes of Dutch cigars was brought to a halt by his wife. She put her foot down after the pub was unsuccessfully searched by customs men. He would also sometimes swap sprats for coal at sea after a rumbustious verbal exchange with an obliging collier's skipper; the fuel was used in his smack's shrimp boiler.\n\nDuring the First World War, a bridge was built across the river to enable members of the nearby Colchester garrison to board trains at Wivenhoe when on their way to Gallipoli. It was inspected by King George V in April 1916, but dismantled after the war.\n\nLifeboats and small oil tankers were constructed and maintained at the two yards, contributing towards the local economy in the 1920s and 30s. Many boats were fabricated in the Upper Yard for contracts in the Sudan. This took kit form; the various parts would be dismantled, crated or wired together, sent out to the African country and reassembled for use on the Nile.\n\nThe extraction of sand and gravel near the village began in the 1930s.\n\nDemand for such building materials increased after the Second World War to repair bomb-damaged buildings, particularly in London. During that conflict, various types of construction, apart from ships, including then secret Mulberry Harbour components for the D-Day landings, were also built, both in Rowhedge and Wivenhoe.\n\nThere was no apprenticeship scheme in the yards in the 1950s; new staff, usually workers sons, were taken-on on an ad-hoc basis.\n\nThe port was at its busiest in the 1980s, being involved in the miners' strike (bringing in imported coal) and also handling anything from fish-meal to granite.\n\nUp to the 1990s, Rowhedge was used for the importation of loads deemed too small for the larger ports or those ships that could not get up the river to Colchester. But with the containerisation of many loads, the writing was on the wall for the port; it closed officially in 2001. More recently, some fishing and leisure sailing are all that remain.\n\nThe Flower Show, which was held annually up to the First World War, involved the erection of marquees on the grassland of the nearby Donyland Hall or Brewery meadow. The event was not confined to displaying flowers; fruit, vegetables, crocheting and knitting were all shown.\n\nThe Regatta, believed to go back to the eighteenth century, has been run annually. Until 1913, it was based on alternate years in Rowhedge and Wivenhoe. Funding was boosted by donations from the King (Edward VII and his successor, (George V) and the Prince of Wales. This Royal patronage was always assumed to be due to the fact that the captain of the \"Britannia\", (the King's racing yacht), John Carter was from Rowhedge. The Regatta has declined and been revived on numerous occasions. Apart from the main event, i.e. the races, which at its peak, involved a total of 64 boats. A typical year might feature an appearance by the boys from HMS \"Ganges\" (a Royal Navy training establishment), tug-of-war (across the river), negotiating a 'greasy' pole and a band. One year even featured the unexpected appearance of a Royal Navy minesweeper.\n\nThe Regatta was revived in 1962 and again in 2002.\n\nBegun in 1986, the raft race was held on the stretch of water between Rowhedge and Brightlingsea. Teams from the army and British Telecom were among those involved in one year.\n\n\n"}

The privilege to found a Latin school was granted to the town of Rotterdam before Rotterdam received full city rights and therefore the school predates the birth of the city itself by nearly twenty years. \nIt was renamed in 1842, after the famous Rotterdam theologian and humanist Desiderius Erasmus (1466–1536). The school is more than a century older than its namesake, and it is unclear whether he attended it. \n\nThe school was located at the corner of the Coolsingel and the Laurensstraat until 1937, nowadays C&A, a clothing store, is located at that place, and the school at the Wytemaweg. In May 1940, Rotterdam was heavily bombed by the German aggressor, but miraculously the building survived. During the war, the occupying German troops used the building as one of their headquarters.\n\nIn the Netherlands, there are several levels of secondary education, the highest being the vwo, pre-university secondary education. In the past decades, many schools have merged with schools of higher or lower levels to form wide-scope community schools. Some gymnasiums, such as the Gymnasium Erasmianum are among the few remaining high-level-only schools, and has managed to avoid merging because of its high number of students. Another special property of Gymnasia is that they offer compulsory classes in the ancient languages Latin and Ancient Greek.\n\nThe school is widely known for its large number of students with non-Dutch roots. There are more students with non-Dutch roots at the Gymnasium Erasmianum than at any other Gymnasium in the Netherlands.\n\nThe school serves 1,170 students and 80 teachers. The school's motto is \"Ex Pluribus Unum\", meaning \"unity through diversity\".\n\n\n\nThe RGB (Rotterdamse Gymnasiasten Bond) is the school's society, organized by the students for the students. Every year the RGB organizes parties, theater, music and dance evenings and several cultural events.\n\nThe RGB has its own anthem in Latin:\n\nEvery year the students elect a new board for the Bond. Any senior student on the school can be elected. The board consists of several functions, with a Latin name:\n\nOther than the RGB, there are several active organizations on the Gymnasium Erasmianum, organised by the school's board, teachers and students alike.

They released their debut album \"Programmed to Love\" in 2000.\n\nThe duo were initially noted for their ability to create their own mischievous style of recordings by sampling their private record collections (which they have themselves referred to as \"dodgy\"). On the 2003 single \"Magic Love\" they sampled a Toni Tennille performance. Nana Mouskouri is one of the artists they have sampled the most so far. Another notably sampled artist is the Canadian singer Anne Murray, whose song \"Just Bidin' My Time\" is heavily used for the lyrics of \"Leavin' Me\".\n\nWith the release of 2004's \"Ariels\", Bent took a sharp turn into live-based recording using predominantly original material. 2006's \"Intercept!\" saw the duo taking a step back into the style reminiscent of the first two albums, although adding a more discoesque touch. Their prankster-ish reputation is reprised with the track \"Stay Out All Night\", in which the sole lyric (repeated twice) is \"People who are afraid of the dark send their children to bed and stay out all night\".\n\nFollowing the relative hiatus of the band (a \"Best of\" in 2009 was followed 4 years later by a double CD featuring previously unreleased tracks), both Nail and Simon Mills have maintained musical activity of their own. Simon Mills launched a solo project called Napoleon, with a self-titled first album digitally released in 2011, very similar to early Bent in its delicate blending of soft electronic music and vintage samplings. A second album, \"Magpies\", also close to the Bent sound, followed in 2013, and 2014 saw for Napoleon the release of twelve EPs, at the beginning of each month.\n\nSimon Mills collaborated with Capital Cities, recording two songs in 2011, \"Postcards\" (feat. Capital Cities) and \"Two Timin' My Mind\" (feat.

He was the son of artist Giovanni Battista Tiepolo and elder brother of Lorenzo Baldissera Tiepolo.\n\nDomenico was born in Venice, studied under his father, and by the age of 13 was the chief assistant to him. He was one of the many assistants, including Lorenzo, who transferred the designs of his father (often executed in 'oil sketches). By the age of 20, he was producing his own work for commissioners.\n\nHe assisted his father in Würzburg 1751–3, decorating the famous stairwell fresco, in Vicenza at the Villa Valmarana in 1757, and in Madrid at the palace of Charles III from 1762–70.\n\nHis painting style developed after the death of his father in 1770, at which time he returned to Venice, and worked there as well as in Genoa and Padua. His painting, though keeping the decorative influence of his father, moved from its spatial fancy and began to take a more realistic depiction. His portraits and scenes of life in Venice are characterised by movement, colour, and deliberate composition.\n\nAfter a lapse of 15 years, his work developed from the religious and mythological subjects of his father to a more secular style. He produced 104 sketches of Punchinello, the standard character of the commedia dell'arte (which would later become Punch in Punch and Judy), a physically deformed clown. These were created as 'Entertainments for the Children', and attempted to poke fun at the pretensions and behaviour of the viewer. \n\nThe same protagonist featured in frescos (1759-1797) in his villa di Zianigo near Mirano. These frescoes were detached and nearly sold to be sold in France, but the then Minister of Public Education, blocked the export and acquired them for the city of Venice. Since 1936, they have been on display, in a near replica of the original arrangement, in the Ca Rezzonico Museum on the Grand Canal. The frescoes have undergone recent restoration. The scenes depict often cryptic events, part genre and part epic-farce, of crowds of Pulcinellos at play and work, as well as a carnival scene. The genre thematic and humor are strikingly different from the grand epic apotheoses painted his father.\n\nMany of Domenico's works are drawings with ink wash, and he was a fine draftsman, although weaker than his father. His \"St. Ambrose Addressing the Young St. Augustine\" sketch is typical of the commissions he would receive. St. Ambrose, with the crozier and mitre, addresses and gives religious instruction to the beardless Saint Augustine. The composition has the pomp and grandiosity of his father's work, set out as if part of a theatrical display. He, however, takes 18th-century Venice as the setting for this 4th-century act, drawing on his experience of the city and his many works depicting life in it.\n\nDomenico was also a significant printmaker in etching, often reproducing his own or his father's paintings. But his original compositions include a series of twenty-four illustrations of the \"Idee Pittoresche sulla Fuga in Egitto\" (\"Picturesque Scenes from the Flight into Egypt\"), and one of the fourteen \"Stations of the Cross\".\n\nThe Art Gallery of New South Wales (Sydney, Australia), the Blanton Museum of Art (University of Texas, Austin), the Cleveland Museum of Art, the Finnish National Gallery, the Honolulu Museum of Art, the Indiana University Art Museum, Kunst Indeks Danmark, the Minneapolis Institute of Arts, the Musée des Beaux-Arts de Caen, the Musée des Beaux-Arts de Strasbourg, the Musée du Louvre (Paris), Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum (Madrid), Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya (Barcelona), the National Gallery, London, the National Museums and Galleries of Wales, the Philadelphia Museum of Art, Pinacoteca Ambrosiana (Milan), Pinacoteca di Brera (Milan), the Portland Art Museum, the Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium, the Seattle Art Museum, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Victoria and Albert Museum and the Wadsworth Atheneum are among the public collections holding paintings by Giovanni Domenico Tiepolo.\n\n\n\n\"Contadini e signori in villa Valmarana\" exhibition by Primo Casalini.\n"}

At the time of composing the carol, Dix worked as an insurance company manager and had been struck by a severe illness. While recovering, he underwent a spiritual renewal that led him to write several hymns, including lyrics to this carol that was subsequently set to the tune of \"Greensleeves\", a traditional English folk song. Although it was written in Great Britain, the carol is more popular in the United States than in its country of origin today.\n\nThe lyrics of the carol are taken from a poem written by Dix called \"The Manger Throne\". The part of the poem that was utilized as the song's lyrics consists of three stanzas in total. The first verse poses a rhetorical question in the first half, with the response coming in the second half. The second verse contains another question that is answered, while the final verse is a universal appeal to everyone urging them \"to accept Christ\". The carol's melody has been described as \"soulful\", \"haunting and beautiful\" in nature.\n\nThe context of the carol centres around the Adoration of the Shepherds, who visited Jesus during his Nativity. The questions posed in the lyrics reflect what the shepherds were possibly pondering to themselves when they encountered him, with the rest of the carol providing a response to their questions.\n\nAt the time he was writing the lyrics to \"What Child Is This?\" in 1865, William Chatterton Dix was working as the manager of an insurance company. He was afflicted by an unexpected and severe illness that resulted in him being bedridden and suffering from severe depression. His near-death experience brought about a spiritual renewal in him while he was recovering. During this time, he read the Bible comprehensively and was inspired to author hymns like \"Alleluia! Sing to Jesus!\" and \"As with Gladness Men of Old\". The precise time in 1865 when he wrote the poem \"The Manger Throne\" is disputed. While the \"St. Petersburg Times\" details how Dix penned the work after reading the Gospel for Epiphany that year (Matthew 2:1–12) recounting the journey of the Biblical Magi; \"Singer's Library of Song: Medium Voice\" contends that it was actually authored during the Christmas of 1865.\n\nAlthough written in 1865, \"What Child Is This?\" was only first published six years later in 1871, when it featured in \"Christmas Carols Old and New\", a \"prestigious\" and \"influential\" collection of carols that was published in the United Kingdom. The hymnal was edited by Henry Ramsden Bramley and John Stainer; even though it is not known with certainty who paired the three stanzas from \"The Manger Throne\" with the music from \"Greensleeves\", the third edition of \"The Christmas Encyclopedia\" by William D. Crump and \"Stories of the Great Christmas Carols\" both suggest that Stainer – who was also responsible for \"harmoniz[ing] the musical setting\" – may have done so.\n\n"}

This leads to a game theoretic problem: all members of a group might be better off if an action were taken, and the members of the group contributed to the cost of the action, but many members of the group may make the perfectly rational decision to let others pay for it, then reap the benefits for free, possibly with the result that no action is taken. The result of this rational game play is lower utility for everyone.\n\nIn a binding way, members of a group pledge to contribute to action A if a total contribution level is reached (often a monetary threshold, or a quorum of N members making the same pledge). If the threshold level is met (perhaps by a certain expiration date), the action is taken and the public good is provided; otherwise, the parties are not bound to carry through the action and any monetary contributions are refunded. The treatment of excess contributions varies: they may be lost, rebated proportionally to the contributors, or used to provide more of the public good.\n\nThe binding mechanism may be a contract enforced by a government, a contract enforced by a private organization (e.g. a mediator, a protection agency in an anarcho-capitalist society, etc.), an escrow organization (in such cases, the \"binding contract\" is \"signed\" by depositing funds in advance, which are later either disbursed according to the contract, or refunded), etc.\n\nIn the economics literature, assurance contracts were first described by Bagnoli and Lipman (1989). From 2005-2015, a website called pledgebank.com provided a way to do assurance contracts online with strangers using phrases like, \"I will do ['some action'] but only if ['some number'] other people will do the same.\" In 2017, collaction.org released an English language website for assurance contracts, calling them 'crowdacting'.\n\nAssurance contracts are popular with libertarians and anarcho-capitalists who see it as a voluntary alternative to taxation.\n\nAssurance contracts are also relevant to international public good provision problems, as international organisations often lack the power to draw in revenue through taxation and must instead rely upon contributions from its members.\n\nDominant assurance contracts, created by Alex Tabarrok, involve an extra component, an entrepreneur who profits when the quorum is reached and pays the signors extra if it is not. If the quorum is not formed, the signors do not pay their share and indeed actively profit from having participated since they keep the money the entrepreneur paid them. Conversely, if the quorum succeeds, the entrepreneur is compensated for taking the risk of the quorum failing. Thus, a player will benefit whether or not the quorum succeeds; if it fails the player reaps a monetary return, and if it succeeds, the player pays only a small amount more than under an assurance contract, and the public good will be provided.\n\nTabarrok asserts that this creates a dominant strategy of participation for all players. Because all players will calculate that it is in their best interests to participate, the contract will succeed, and the entrepreneur will be rewarded. In a meta-game, this reward is an incentive for other entrepreneurs to enter the DAC market, driving down the cost disadvantage of dominant assurance contract versus regular assurance contracts.\n\n\n"}

Busáras is also a stop on the Red Line of the Luas system, in Store Street just before the terminus at Dublin Connolly railway station. Áras Mhic Dhiarmada (\"Mac Diarmada House\") is the official name of the building, which also includes the headquarters of the Department of Social Protection. CIÉ, parent of Bus Éireann, leases the lower floors from the Department. Áras Mhic Dhiarmada is named after Seán Mac Diarmada, a leader of the Easter Rising in 1916.\n\nBusáras was designed by Michael Scott and his team of young architects and designers between 1945 and 1953. It was built against a background of public opposition which centred on the external appearance, function and excessive cost – over £1,000,000 before completion in 1953. Simultaneously loathed by some of the populace and loved by architectural purists, the building was designed in an International Modern style between 1945 and 1953. A number of the original fixtures and fittings designed by Scott still exist, including terrazzo floor tiles, and large timber wall panels.\n\nOne of the first modern buildings in Dublin that attempted to integrate art and architecture, utilising elements like glass facades and a pavilionised top storey, the building won the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland (RIAI) Triennial Gold medal in 1955. It was featured on the highest value stamp issued in the \"Architecture\" definitive postage stamp set issued in 1982 by the P&T, the forerunner of An Post.\n\nThe Eblana Theatre, originally intended as a newsreel venue, in the basement of the building was used as a theatre venue from 1959 to 1995.\n\nThe building was praised for use of materials and paint effects that enhanced texture and brass, bronze, copper, mosaics, and exotic timbers often featured in Michael Scott's work.\n\nIn 2006, Bus Éireann sought planning permission for the €2 million-plus second phase of refurbishment of the building. The proposal involved repairing and cleaning the bronze glazing and brickwork at ground floor level, to be overseen by conservation architects and an expert in bronze. Proposed works on the west-facing entrance lobby included new entrances at both sides, with bronze automatic sliding doors and uplights installed to the underside of the canopy.\n\nThe refurbishment work was carried out by Collen Construction over a period of seven months and had a contract value of €1.7m.\n\nThe Luas, Dublin City's light rail system in Store Street, stops at Busáras every three minutes during peak times.\n\n"}

Los Angeles County, , 18 P.2d 706, was a 1930s court case in California confirming that the state's anti-miscegenation laws at the time did not bar the marriage of a Filipino and a white person. However, the precedent lasted barely a week before the law was specifically amended to illegalize such marriages.\n\nThe case involved a Filipino American man, Salvador Roldan, engaged to a white British woman, Marjorie Rogers. Roldan was an Ilocano from northern Luzon. Since 1880, California Civil Code Section 60 had prohibited marriages between white persons and \"negros\", \"mulattos\", or \"Mongolians\", but there was confusion over whether Filipinos were part of that last category. California Attorney General Ulysses S. Webb had issued an advisory opinion in 1926 that Filipinos were part of the \"Mongolian race\". In 1930, a court had denied another Filipino man, Tony Moreno, permission to marry his white fiancé and ruled that Filipinos and other \"Malayans\" were part of the \"Mongolian race\" and thus not eligible to marry whites.\n\nHowever, the following year, Judge Walter Guerin granted a marriage licence for Gavino Visco to marry Ruth M. Salas. The groom was a Filipino of Spanish ancestry, while the bride was an indigenous Mexican; however, Guerin stated that he would have granted the licence even if the bride were white. In August 1931, Roldan and Rogers's application for a marriage licence was rejected by the Los Angeles County clerk. The couple petitioned for a writ of mandate with the Superior Court of Los Angeles County. Judge Walter Gates granted the writ.\n\nCounty counsels L. E. Lampton and Everett Mattoon appealed Gates' decision to the California Court of Appeal for the Second District. Webb, as well as Associate Attorney General Frank English, filed amici briefs on behalf of Lampton and Mattoon. While the case was being heard, other counties in California continued to refuse to issue marriage licences to Filipino-white couples. The appellate court's decision hinged on examination of the theories of racial anthropology current in the late 19th century when the law was drafted, in an effort to discern the legislative intent. County officials cited the work of Aleš Hrdlička in arguing that Filipinos were indeed part of the \"Mongolian race\". However, Justice T. Archbald, who wrote the opinion in the case, disagreed, stating that J. F. Blumenbach's taxonomy, which classified \"Malays\" and \"Mongolians\" separately, was the dominant theory through the early 20th century. He also pointed out that the term \"Mongolians\" in popular opinion was meant principally to apply to the Chinese, in reaction to the late 19th-century influx of Chinese immigrants. The court thus concluded that Filipinos were members of the \"Malay race\" and not the \"Mongoloid race\", finding Roldan and Rogers' marriage legal.\n\nCounty officials appealed the case again to the Supreme Court of California in 1933. On March 27, 1933, the Supreme Court announced that it would not review the case, effectively upholding the appellate court's decision. Soon after that announcement, the California State Legislature voted to amend Civil Code Section 60 to ensure that the law against interracial marriage also covered \"members of the Malay race\". California Governor James Rolph signed the amendment into law on April 5, 1933.\n\n\n"}

An aviation pioneer, Gago Coutinho and Sacadura Cabral were the first to cross the South Atlantic Ocean by air, from March to June 1922, from Lisbon, Portugal, to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.\n\nHe was born in Belém, Lisbon, in a modest family, the son of José Viegas Gago Coutinho and his cousin, Fortunata Maria Coutinho. He finished high school in 1885, and entered the Polytechnic School, where he studied for one year, as preparation for his entrance at the Naval School, in Alfeite, Almada, in 1886.\n\nHe joined the Navy in 1886 as an aspirant. In 1890, he was promoted to marine guard, in 1891 to second lieutenant, and in 1895 to first lieutenant. In 1907 he was promoted to captain-lieutenant and in 1915 to captain-of-frigate. In 1920 he became captain of sea-and-war. In 1922 he was promoted to vice-admiral, and in 1958 to admiral. During his first Navy years, he did several travels, being the first in the corvette \"Afonso de Albuquerque\", from 7 December 1888 to 16 January 1891, where he traveled to Mozambique as a member of the Naval Division of Eastern Africa. He did several naval travels the following years, until 31 March 1898, when he did his first commission as a overseas geographer, in Portuguese Timor. Since March 1898, Gago Coutinho activities were developed mostly at the Cartography Commission, created in 1883. From 27 July 1898 to 19 April 1899, he was involved in field work, working at the delimitation of the borders and at the survey of the geographical chart of the most remote Portuguese colony. After his return to Portugal, he was assigned to work at the delimitation of the borders of Niassa territory in Mozambique, from 5 September 1900 to 28 February 1901. He then moved to Angola, where he worked at the delimitation of Noqui's borders, until the end of 1901. He returned to Mozambique, working for the borders delimitation in Tete district, between 27 February 1904 and 18 December 1905.\n\nGago Coutinho was nominated head of the Geodesical Mission of Eastern Africa in May 1907, a post he held until the beginning of 1911. It was during his assignment that he met Portuguese aviator pioneer Artur de Sacadura Cabral, who become his close friend and who would be his mentor for future aviation projects. Afterwards, he led the Portuguese mission that delimited Angola borders in Barotze, which was formed in 1912. The year after his return to Portugal, he was nominated the head of the Geodesical Mission of São Tomé and Príncipe, in 1915, which he was until middle 1919. In 1917, Gago Coutinho and Artur de Sacadura Cabral did their first flights together. In 1919, encouraged by his friend, he started to dedicate himself to the improvement of the aerial navigation methods. They took several flights together to study the methods, the most important was the first flight from Lisbon to Funchal, in Madeira, in 1919. Artur de Sacadura Cabral had already delineated by them the project of making the first aerial crossing of the South Atlantic, meant to take place in 1922, the year of the centennial of the independence of Brazil.\n\nThe Fairey IIIB seaplane named \"Lusitânia\" used by Gago Coutinho and Sacadura Cabral for their transatlantic flight did not have enough fuel capacity to make the entire trip unaided so various stops were made along the way and the aviators were shadowed by a support ship, \"República\". On the journey down the Brazilian coast a heavy rain storm caused the aircraft's engine to fail and the aviators were forced to ditch in the ocean. Realizing that something was wrong, the \"República\" sent out a distress signal asking other ships in the area to look out for the seaplane. After some time in the water, the aviators were found by a British freighter. The \"Paris City\" of the Reardon Smith Line, under Captain A.E. Tamlyn, en route from Cardiff to Rio, rescued Coutinho and Cabral; they completed their journey with a new aircraft. A commemorative painting of the rescue was made by the Portuguese painter and cartoonist José Stuart Carvalhais.\n\nGago Coutinho invented a type of sextant incorporating two spirit levels to provide an artificial horizon. This adaptation of the traditional marine sextant allowed navigation without visual reference to the real horizon. He also invented an optical flight instrument, to be mounted on the plane's cockpit floor, which measures leeway in flight whenever ground remains visible.\n\nHe dedicated himself to the nautical history of the Portuguese Discoveries after 1924. His vast body of work later would be published in \"A Náutica dos Descobrimentos\" (\"The Nautical of the Discoveries\") (1951–1952), in two volumes.\n\n\n"}

In 1975 there was labour unrest when the major unions representing oil workers and sugar workers marched in San Fernando and were met by brutal police resistance. This became known as \"Bloody Tuesday\". Further unrest in the 1970s had little lasting impact. The economic downturn following the end of the oil boom saw the People's National Movement losing power after 30 unbroken years in government.

It is also held to appear on the image stone at Stora Hammar on Gotland (see illustration). Moreover, it is alluded to in the Old English poems \"Deor\" and \"Widsið\", and in the Old Norse \"Háttalykill inn forni\", and a version of it survived down to the 18th century in the traditional Norn language ballad \"Hildina\". An altered version of the saga is found in the Middle High German poem \"Kudrun\", as a prologue to the story of Kudrun herself. Yet another version is found in the Old Yiddish \"Dukus Horant\".\n\nLike the names \"Heðinn\" (O.E. \"Heoden\") and \"Hǫgni\" (O.E. \"Hagena\"), the legend is believed to have continental Germanic origins.\n\nIn the \"Skáldskaparmál\" and in \"Ragnarsdrápa\", it is related that once when Hǫgni was away, his daughter Hildr was kidnapped by a prince named Heðinn, the son of Hjarrandi (O.E. Heorrenda). When Hǫgni came back, he immediately started to search for her. In the older poem \"Ragnarsdrápa\", Hǫgni finally found her and the island where Heðinn waited with his army. This island is explained as the island of Hoy in Orkney by Snorri Sturluson in \"Skáldskaparmál\".\n\nHildr welcomed her father and offered him peace and a necklace on behalf of Heðinn. However, Hǫgni had already unsheathed his sword Dáinsleif, which gave wounds that never healed and like Tyrfing always killed a man once it had been unsheathed. A battle ensued and they fought all day and many died. In the evening Heðinn and Hǫgni returned to their camps, but Hildr stayed on the battle-field. She resurrected them with incantations and the fallen soldiers started to fight anew, and this went on until Ragnarök.\n\nSörla þáttr is a short story in Flateyjarbok, a collection of tales about Norwegian kings written by two Christian priests in the 15th century, owned by a family from Flatey island. Sörla þáttr is about King Olaf I of Norway (Olaf Tryggvason), who was the first to encourage Christianity in Norway and Iceland.\n\nThe story borrowed parts of \"Heimskringla\", parts of the poem \"Lokasenna\" (of Gefjon sleeping with a boy for a necklace), parts of the \"Húsdrápa\" poem (of Loki stealing Brisingamen), and the eternal battle \"Hjaðningavíg\". In the end of the story, the arrival of Christianity dissolves the old curse that traditionally was to endure until Ragnarök.\n\nIn \"Skíðaríma\", the war threatens to destroy Valhalla itself, and so Odin sends Thor to fetch Skíði, a pathetic beggar, so that he can stop the war. Skíði manages to stop the fight by asking to marry Hildr and she consents.\n\nSaxo Grammaticus relates that Hithinus was the prince of a Norwegian tribe and a small man. Hithinus fell in love with Hilda, the daughter of Höginus, a strongly built Jutish chieftain. Hithinus and Hilda had in fact been so impressed with each other's reputation that they had fallen in love before meeting.\n\nIn spring, Hithinus and Höginus went pillaging together, and Höginus betrothed his daughter to Hithinus promising each other that they would avenge one another if anything happened.\n\nHowever, evil tongues spread the rumour that Hithinus had touched Hilda before the betrothal. Höginus believed the false rumour and attacked Hithinus, but Höginus was beaten and returned to Jutland.\n\nKing Frotho of Denmark tried to mediate, but had to decide that the matter be settled in a holmgang. During the combat Hithinus was seriously wounded, and started losing blood. Höginus decided to have mercy on Hithinus, because among the old Scandinavians it was considered shameful to kill someone who was weaker, and so Hithinus was taken home by his men.\n\nAfter seven years, the two men started to fight again but both died from their wounds. But, Hilda loved both so much, so that she used spells to conjure up the dead each night, and so the battle went on and on.\n\nThe battle is alluded to in the Old English 10th century poem \"Deor\". The poet explains that he served the Heodenings (people of Heðinn) until Heorrenda a more skilled poet replaced him:\n\nThe Heodenings and Heorrenda are probably mentioned in \"Deor\" to add a level of irony or humour. Being eternal, the tragedy of the Heodenings would not \"go by\".\n\n"}

{"id": "2036378", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2036378", "title": "Nuphar", "text": "Nuphar\n\nNuphar is a genus of aquatic plants in the family Nymphaeaceae, with a temperate to subarctic Northern Hemisphere distribution. Common names include water-lily (Eurasian species; shared with many other genera in the same family), pond-lily, alligator-bonnet or bonnet lily, and spatterdock (North American species).\n\nThe etymology of the word is: medieval Latin \"nuphar\", from medieval Latin \"nenuphar\", thence from Arabic \"nīnūfar\", thence from Persian \"nīlūfar\", thence from Sanskrit \"nīlōtpala\" = blue lotus flower. For botanical gender, the name is treated as feminine.\n\nThe genus is closely related to \"Nymphaea\". \"Nuphar\" differs in that its petals are much smaller than its 4-6 bright yellow-coloured sepals, whereas in \"Nymphaea\", the petals are much larger than the sepals. The genera also differ in the maturation of their fruit; while maturing, \"Nuphar\" fruit remain above water level on their scapes, whereas fruit of \"Nymphaea\" sink below water level immediately after their flowers close, and there they mature. In both genera the leaves float and have a radial notch from the circumference to the point of attachment of the petiole. Depending on the species, the leaves of most species range from cordate to practically circular with the petiole attached in the middle, giving a peltate appearance. Some however, have modified versions of that leaf morphology; for example the leaves of \"Nuphar sagittifolia\" have leaves of an elongated sagittate form.\n\nThe number of species in the genus is still under review. Until the mid-20th century, some botanists treated the genus as just a single variable species (for which the European name \"N. lutea\" has priority), while some other authorities accepted about a dozen more species on the basis of traditional taxonomic standards. Recent molecular work has shown that there are substantial differences between the Eurasian species (sect. \"Nuphar\") and American species (sect. \"Astylus\"), except for North American \"N. microphylla\" which clusters with the Eurasian species. Molecular taxonomy has shown conclusively that recognition of so few species is out of the question, and forced an increased number of recognised species; some sources list about seventy. The Kew Gardens plant list includes over twenty accepted species, subspecies and varieties; it also has a similar number as yet unresolved, together with over twenty synonyms.\n\n\"Nuphar\" Section \"Astylus\"\n\n\"Nuphar\" Section \"Nuphar\"\n\nThere also are several interspecific hybrids.\n\n\"Nuphar\" species occur in ponds, lakes, and slow-moving rivers, growing in water up to 5 metres deep; different species are variously adapted either to nutrient-rich waters (e.g. \"Nuphar lutea\") or nutrient-poor waters (e.g. \"Nuphar pumila\").\n\nWetland soils are hypoxic, and this genus is known to be capable of temporary growth even in the absence of oxygen. Also there can be mass flow of oxygen-containing air, entering by means of the young leaves, passing through the rhizome, and exiting through the older leaves. Both of these physiological adaptations to flooding are considered typical of many wetland and aquatic plants.\nLike many other vigorously growing members of the Nymphaeaceae, some species of \"Nuphar\" tend to cover the water surface completely, blocking out the light and thereby killing both submerged plants and less competitive surface-growing aquatics. They also produce alkaloids that have experimentally been shown to be allelopathic, though it is not clear how relevant the compounds may be in the wild.\n\nBirds such as some species of ducks eat \"Nuphar\" seeds, and mammals such as beaver and coypu eat the roots of at least some species. Deer eat flowers and young leaves.\n\n\"Nuphar\" species are less generally useful as food or medicine than various species in the related water lily genus \"Nymphaea\". Claims of the edibility or otherwise of the plant have varied wildly, which might in some cases have reflected errors and confusion, but in the light of the recognition of an increased number of species, the confusion might largely be because hitherto unrecognised species differ in their attributes.\n\nHowever, some species have been used by indigenous peoples, and the leaves are grazed by deer and other animals. Young shoots and leaves sometimes were cooked but might be too bitter to eat. Whether the roots may be eaten, as is widely reported, is open to doubt; some sources claim that they are too bitter, too full of tannin, or simply too poisonous to eat unsoaked, except when treated for so long that they are not viable as a famine food. All sources however, agree that ripe seeds may be popped or variously used in cookery. They then are pleasant and nutritious, but require a lot of work to harvest and strip from the fruit capsule. To some extent this may be circumvented rotting the fruit under water for three weeks or more, after which removing the seeds is easier. The rotting material however, is very unpleasant to deal with. The flower petals are said to be used in making tea, but it is not clear whether that refers to the petals proper, or to the larger and more conspicuous sepals. The leaves of some species are large enough to be of use in wrapping food, for example in cooking.\n\nAlkaloids in the genus include nupharolutine, nuphamine and nupharidine. The presence of such compounds could explain some of the medicinal uses\n\nThere has been growing interest in \"Nuphar\" alkaloids, their biological and pharmacological significance and their synthesis in recent decades. It has been speculated that these and other bioactive compounds might be related to some of the folk-medical applications of the plants.\n\nApart from pharmaceuticals, the leaves of \"Nuphar\" are reported to contain sufficient concentrations of tannin to have been widely used for tanning and dyeing leather, and also as a styptic for staunching bleeding. The roots of some species also contain sufficient tannin to have been used for tanning.\n"}

It is 35.3 m (116 ft) wide with pedestrian and bicycle paths and a tramline.\n\nAt its Óbuda end is Flórián tér, Szentlélek tér (near the Main Square of Óbuda, the Vasarely and Kassák Museums).\n\nMargaret Island is connected to Árpád Bridge through an embranchment approximately in the middle of the bridge, and crosses the Southern tip of Óbuda Island as well, although there is no road, pedestrian or any other connection whatsoever between the two. (See Sziget Festival)\n\nAt the Pest end, the adjoining Line 3 (North-South) metro station was called \"Árpád híd\" until 31 January 2020.\n\nIn earlier times there was a bridge in the same area established by the Romans, it was connecting a fort and the old Roman settlement of Aquincum. There was a plan at the beginning of the 19th century, to create a new bridge named Árpád, however the tender was announced only in 1929.\n\nConstruction began in 1939 by the plans of János Kossalka. It was planned to be named \"Árpád Bridge\" after Grand Prince Árpád, the second Grand Prince of the Magyars.\n\nDue to World War II, the bridge was finished only after the war in 1950. Because of the communist regime then ruling Hungary, the bridge was opened as Stalin Bridge (Hungarian: \"Sztálin híd\"). The final construction works were directed by Károly Széchy and Pál Sávoly.\n\nAlthough the pillars were built in their current dimensions, the original bridge contained only a 2x1 lane road, railroad tracks (for trams, but until the reconstruction of the Northern Rail Bridge the tracks were also used by cargo trains as well) with pedestrian paths. This bridge was 13 m (42.65 ft) wide, 11 meters (36 ft) of this was the road and the tracks, and an additional 1 m (3.28 ft) wide pedestrian path were on each sides. Today the tram tracks are where the original bridge was situated.\n\nThe name was changed back to Árpád Bridge in 1958.\n\nBetween 1980 and 1984, by extensive reconstruction and expansion works, two more lanes were added for cars, the pedestrian pathways were widened, the tram track was modernized and overpasses were built for the intersections at both Eastern (Pest) and Western (Buda/Óbuda) ends of Árpád Bridge.\n\nThis was planned and executed in connection with the expansion of the adjacent \"Róbert Károly körút\" (further sections also called \"Hungária körút\" and \"Könyves Kálmán körút\" as well) to 2x3 lanes and double tramway tracks . The project was called Hungária körgyűrű (English: \"Hungária Beltway\"), although the last third of the belt (\"Könyves Kálmán körút\") was finished only around the millennium, years after the completion of Lágymányosi Bridge at the other end of the planned beltway.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2036405", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2036405", "title": "Johan Frederik Clemens", "text": "Johan Frederik Clemens\n\nJohan Frederik Clemens (November 29, 1749 – November 5, 1831) was a Pomeranian-Danish printmaker in etching.\n\nClemens was born in Gollnow (now Goleniów) near Stettin (now Szczecin) in Pomerania, to a poor Saxon weaver, Johan David Clemens, and his wife Anna Francken. The father, along with his son Johan, moved to Copenhagen when the boy was still quite young.\n\nHe sought to begin his training at the Royal Danish Academy of Art (\"Det Kongelige Danske Kunstakademi\") already in 1760 at the age of 11. He enrolled for training, but was rejected by Drawing Master Hans Clio as being too young and little. Sculptor Simon Carl Stanley took an interest in the child, and with his help Johan came into the School of Drawing in 1761. He trained both as a decorative painter, and as a craftsman painter.\n\nIn 1764 at the age of 15 Clemens was in training under an alcoholic painting master, where he was put to work with simple decorations work. When he became a painting apprentice he came into training at Johan Edvard Mandelberg's studio. Mandelberg used many talented apprentices to carry out his numerous projects. It was here that Clemens came to know Nikolaj Abraham Abildgaard, Frederik Ludvig Bradt, Johannes Samuel Lymann and other talented young talents from the Art Academy, some of whom would achieve great fame and position in the years to come.\n\nIn 1765 he had already won both the Academy's small and large silver medallions. Jacques Saly, the Academy's Director, advised the boy to become a sculptor, but he was interested in becoming a copperplate etcher. He was recommended to train under Johan Martin Preisler, but Preisler showed no interest in him until Clemens made a print based on an etching by Jean Daullé. Impressed by this work, Preisler became Clemens' devoted friend and protector. Clemens trained under Preisler between ca. 1769–1770.\nHe soon won another influential protector, theatrical painter Peter Cramer, who recommended him to sculptor Johannes Wiedewelt. Clemens made etchings based on Wiedewelt's illustrations for a deluxe edition of Ludvig Holberg's \"Peder Paars\" in 1772, giving the youngster a decent income in which to support himself and his father. Wiedewelt became his lifelong friend and patron, and additional book assignments followed closely.\n\nWith Wiedewelt's help Clemens received a four-year travel stipend and was able to leave Copenhagen in 1774. We went directly to Paris, where he was influenced by the technique and style of Charles-Nicolas Cochin. Clemens was productive and etched many portraits during his stay in Paris. He also became engaged to Marie Jeanne Crevoisier while there.\n\nHe developed such a glowing reputation as an artist in Paris that the Academy soon offered to take him on as a member, provided he produced a new, quality work for his application piece. At the same time his travel stipend was running out. He requested permission to stay, and was denied it because \"certain important people\" wanted Clemens to return to Copenhagen to etch plates for a royal project. Clemens ignored this order and remained, at least until he received a formal order to return. His friends in Copenhagen, however, managed to get him permission for a stopover in Switzerland on his travel home.\n\nClemens left Paris in 1777 along with Jens Juel and Simon Malgo, and traveled to Geneva, where he made vignettes for Charles Bonnet's \"\"Oeuvres d'histoire naturelle et de philosophie \"\" and an etching based on Jens Juel's portrait of Bonnet. The portrait drew a lot of attention to Clemens' skills, and led to a lifelong collaboration between the two artists.\n\nHe returned to Copenhagen in autumn 1778 where his elderly father was sick and decrepit.\n\nIn 1779 he was named royal engraver, with the helpful support of Wiedewelt, and received an annual wage by which he could support a family. Along with Juel, who was named to royal painter for the court the following year, he was kept busy making portraits for the royal family and nobility over the next ten years.\n\nHe returned to Paris to marry fiancée, Marie Jeanne Crevoisier, on August 27, 1781. They moved together back to Copenhagen. He taught his new wife, already artistically inclined, the art of copperplate etching, and she became quite proficient at it. Marie Jeanne quickly fell into the Danish artistic milieu.\n\nClemens' father died in 1782. That same year Marie Jeanne received an invitation of her own to join the Art Academy as pastel painter. She was one of the first women to receive the honor. She, however, never delivered her assigned submission work to the Academy, and therefore never fulfilled the conditions for membership.\n\nClemens achieved great notice during this period of time for etchings he created for two book assignments: a collection of Johannes Ewald's works based on drawings of Abildgaard, begun in 1780, and another based on illustrations by his friend and patron, Wiedewelt in 1783. Clemens' 1780 illustration for the first volume of Ewald's work— for the dramatic piece \"Adam and Eve\"— was considered indecent, and led to a break in their collaboration for several years. The two continued their collaboration with \"Socrates\" (1786) and \"\"Lykkens Tempel\"\" (\"The Temple of Happiness\").\n\nClemens occupied a central position in that time's artistic life and spirit, and was an avid participant in the Enlightenment's scientific and philosophical discussions. During the 1780s he collaborated with Abildgaard on a series of social, religious and political satires and critiques. Like Juel and Abildgaard he had close connections to contemporary political circles, and he and his wife were particularly close to Chamberlain and Court Marshal Johan Bülow.\n\nClemens was first accepted as member of the Academy in 1786 with the submission of etchings of \"\"Kronprins Frederik\"\" (\"Crown Prince Frederik\") and \"Louise Augusta\". With his enormous creative talent Clemens' reputation in Denmark grew, and he was in good company with his contemporaries Nikolaj Abraham Abildgaard, Johan Martin Preisler, Johan Edvard Mandelberg, Johannes Wiedewelt and Jens Juel.\n\nIn 1787 Clemens was invited to Berlin to make an etching based on a drawing by Englishman E.F. Cunningham, \"Frederick the Great Riding Home After Manoeuvres at Potsdam\". He received royal approval and traveled there the next year. He lived in Berlin for four years under less than agreeable circumstances, as Cunningham was difficult to work with. He received membership in the Academy in Berlin in 1788, and his works were exhibited at the Berlin Academy that same year.\n\nIn 1789 his engravings based on Abildgaards originals appeared in another Ludwig Holberg work \"\"Niels Klim\"\". His wife succumbed to tuberculosis in 1791 in Berlin, leaving behind a nine-year-old son. Two other children had died young.\n\nWhen the Berlin assignment was completed Clemens traveled in 1792 with royal permission to London to work on a new etching based on John Trumbull's \"The Death of General Montgomery in the Attack on Quebec, December 31, 1775\". This work brought him further commissions for prints based on several other paintings by Trumbull and Benjamin West.\n\nHe exhibited at the Charlottenborg Salon in Copenhagen for the first time in 1794, and again in 1815. In London he married Ann Rees in 1795.\n\nHe returned to Denmark in 1795. He received an apartment at the Academy in 1797, and served as the Academy's treasurer several times in the years to come.\n\nHis engraving \"\"Slaget på Reden\"\" (The Battle of Copenhagen) was created in 1801, and was based on a drawing by Christian August Lorentzen. It pictured the battle led by Admiral Horatio Nelson, part of the English attack on Copenhagen (Battle of Copenhagen (1801)) during the Napoleonic wars, which reached its high point on April 2, 1801. This engraving was very popular in its day and was a feature in many homes as a show of patriotism. It has also come to stand as the best and most reliable illustration of this battle today.\n\nHe was named professor in copperplate etching at the Academy in 1813 after being several times passed over, and finally extraordinary professor in the School of Model Painting in 1818 at the age of 70.\n\nHis second wife died in 1824. He exhibited at Charlottenborg several times during the 1820s. He died November 5, 1831, at the age of 81.\n\nHe won himself many loyal supporters and good friends early on, among them two of the most important Danish artists of his time, Jens Juel and Nicolai Abraham Abildgaard, who were vital for him as an aspiring young engraver. Many of Clemens' portraits are based on Juel's originals.\n\nHe survived many of his contemporary artistic friends, some by several decades, and was able to establish himself with new generations of artists such as Lorentzen and Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg. He made etchings based on several of their works. In his later years he experimented with lithography, a printing technique which competed successfully against copperplate etching in the years to come.\n\nHe was skillful, persistent and ambitious, and used his social contacts to reach his goals. His total output comes to around 400 prints.\n\n"}

Initially conceived of as a South African version of Greenpeace, the group began by playing a radical, anti-apartheid, activist role. ELA is arguably now more of a reformist lobby or pressure group. Considered by some to be a key voice in the emerging environmental justice movement, Earthlife Africa has been criticised for being too radical, and by others for \"working with traditional conservation movements\" in furthering the environmental struggle.\n\nThe Earthlife Africa constitution (and name) was formally adopted at the first national conference at Dal Josophat, near Paarl (outside Cape Town) during 1989. Earthlife Africa was chosen as a conscious attempt to avoid the split affecting two factions in GreenPeace who were vying for control of the organisation. ELA therefore took a different approach to the environmental struggle.\n\nThe ELA constitution was initially loosely based upon the Four Pillars of the Green Party and other movement documents. In attendance at this historical inauguration of South Africa's green movement were various members of related environmental organisations and ecology groups including:\n\nAccording to Jacklyn Cock, \"the concept of environmental justice was first introduced in South Africa at the\nEarthlife 1992 conference.\" Environmental Justice \"was articulated as a black concept and a poor concept and it took root very well’ More accurately, it was the Environmental Justice Network Forum (EJNF) which was initiated at the 1992 conference hosted by Earthlife Africa on the theme \"What does it mean to be green in South Africa.’ At this conference 325 civil society delegates resolved to redefine the environmental agenda in South Africa in broad terms and to move beyond the loose anarchist constitution which had bound members with 'values' as opposed to 'rights'. The South African National Conference on Environment and Development had already set the agenda of the green movement in 1991 and thus the 1992 ELA conference was merely a sequel and precursor of later development within the broader movement.\n\nThe exposure of pollution by Thor Chemicals, a corporation which imported toxic waste into South Africa, by Earthlife and EJNF working closely with the Legal Resources Centre, the Chemical Workers Industrial Union, affected workers and local communities was the crucial turning point in the re-framing and ‘browning’ of environmentalism in South Africa.\n\nEarthlife launched the People’s Environmental Centre, the Greenhouse in 2002.\n\n2007 ELA participates in a parliamentary portfolio committee hearing into the nuclear industry, delivering submissions and hearing from widows and workers affected by the Pelindaba accident \n\nSeptember 2010, Public Enterprises Minister Barbara Hogan announces the ANC government decision to mothball the PBMR project.

The species was first described by Carl Linnaeus in his 1758 10th edition of \"Systema Naturae\". A familiar moth to many, it is considered one of the most common of the European region. It occurs throughout the Palearctic ecozone from Ireland to Japan.\n\nThis is a quite variable species with forewings ranging from pale to dark brown but always recognizable by the distinctively shaped dark stigmata which give it its common name. The hindwings are whitish (compared with other common \"Agrotis\" species, the hindwings of this species are usually paler than in heart and club but darker than in turnip moth). The wingspan is 35–44 mm. This species usually has a dark area at the front of the thorax, visible as a horizontal bar when viewing the moth head on.

{"id": "2036409", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2036409", "title": "Michelin Guide", "text": "Michelin Guide\n\nMichelin Guides ( ) are a series of guide books published by the French tyre company Michelin for more than a century. The term normally refers to the annually published Michelin \"Red Guide\", the oldest European hotel and restaurant reference guide, which awards up to three Michelin stars for excellence to a select few establishments. The acquisition or loss of a star can have dramatic effects on the success of a restaurant. Michelin also publishes a series of general guides to cities, regions, and countries, the \"Green Guides\".\n\nIn 1900, there were fewer than 3,000 cars on the roads of France. To increase the demand for cars and, accordingly, car tires, car tire manufacturers and brothers Édouard and André Michelin published a guide for French motorists, the Michelin Guide. Nearly 35,000 copies of this first, free edition of the guide were distributed; it provided useful information to motorists, such as maps, tire repair and replacement instructions, car mechanics listings, hotels, and petrol stations throughout France.\n\nFour years later, in 1904, the brothers published a guide for Belgium similar to the Michelin Guide.\n\nMichelin subsequently introduced guides for Algeria and Tunisia (1907); the Alps and the Rhine (northern Italy, Switzerland, Bavaria, and the Netherlands) (1908); Germany, Spain, and Portugal (1910); Ireland and the British Isles (1911); and \"The Countries of the Sun\" (\") (Northern Africa, Southern Italy and Corsica) (1911). In 1909, an English-language version of the guide to France was published.\n\nDuring World War I, publication of the guide was suspended. After the war, revised editions of the guide continued to be given away until 1920. It is said that André Michelin, whilst visiting a tire merchant, noticed copies of the guide being used to prop up a workbench. Based on the principle that \"man only truly respects what he pays for\", Michelin decided to charge a price for the guide, which was about 750 francs or $2.15 in 1922. They also made several changes, notably listing restaurants by specific categories, adding hotel listings (initially only for Paris), and removing advertisements in the guide. Recognizing the growing popularity of the restaurant section of the guide, the brothers recruited a team of inspectors to visit and review restaurants, who were always anonymous.\n\nFollowing the usage of the Murray's and Baedeker guides, the guide began to award stars for fine dining establishments in 1926. Initially, there was only a single star awarded. Then, in 1931, the hierarchy of zero, one, two, and three stars was introduced. Finally, in 1936, the criteria for the starred rankings were published:\n\n\nIn 1931 the cover of the guide was changed from blue to red, and has remained so in all subsequent editions. During World War II, publication was again suspended, but in 1944, at the request of the Allied Forces, the 1939 guide to France was specially reprinted for military use; its maps were judged the best and most up-to-date available. Publication of the annual guide resumed on 16 May 1945, a week after VE Day.\n\nIn the early post-war years the lingering effects of wartime shortages led Michelin to impose an upper limit of two stars; by 1950 the French edition listed 38 establishments judged to meet this standard. The first Michelin Guide to Italy was published in 1956. It awarded no stars in the first edition. In 1974, the first guide to Britain since 1931 was published. Twenty-five stars were awarded.\n\nIn 2005, Michelin published its first American guide, covering 500 restaurants in the five boroughs of New York City and 50 hotels in Manhattan. In 2007, a Tokyo Michelin Guide was launched. In the same year, the guide introduced a magazine, \". In 2008, a Hong Kong and Macau volume was added. As of 2013, the guide is published in 14 editions covering 23 countries.\n\nIn 2008, the German restaurateur Juliane Caspar was appointed editor-in-chief of the French edition of the guide. She had previously been responsible for the Michelin guides to Germany, Switzerland, and Austria. She became the first woman and first non-French national to occupy the French position. The German newspaper \" commented on the appointment, \"In view of the fact German cuisine is regarded as a lethal weapon in most parts of France, this decision is like Mercedes announcing that its new director of product development is a Martian.\"\n\nRed Guides have historically listed many more restaurants than rival guides, relying on an extensive system of symbols to describe each one in as little as two lines. Reviews of starred restaurants also include two to three culinary specialties. Short summaries (2–3 lines) were added in 2002/2003 to enhance descriptions of many establishments. These summaries are written in the language of the country for which the guide is published (though the Spain and Portugal volume is in Spanish only) but the symbols are the same throughout all editions.\n\nMichelin reviewers (commonly called \"inspectors\") are anonymous; they do not identify themselves, and their meals and expenses are paid for by Michelin, never by a restaurant being reviewed:\nThe French chef Paul Bocuse, one of the pioneers of in the 1960s, said, \"Michelin is the only guide that counts.\" In France, when the guide is published each year, it sparks a media frenzy which has been compared to that for annual Academy Awards for films. Media and others debate likely winners, speculation is rife, and TV and newspapers discuss which restaurant might lose, and who might gain a Michelin star.\n\nThe Michelin Guide also awards \"Rising Stars\", an indication that a restaurant has the potential to qualify for a star, or an additional star.\n\nSince 1955, the guide has also highlighted restaurants offering \"exceptionally good food at moderate prices\", a feature now called \"\". They must offer menu items priced below a maximum determined by local economic standards. () is the company's nickname for the Michelin Man, its corporate logo for over a century.\n\nIn 2014, Michelin introduced a separate listing for gastropubs in Ireland. In 2016, the Michelin Guide for Hong Kong and Macau introduced an overview of notable street food establishments. Additionally in 2016, the Singapore guide introduced the first Michelin stars for street food locations, for Hong Kong Soya Sauce Chicken Rice and Noodle and Hill Street Tai Hwa Pork Noodle.\n\nAll listed restaurants, regardless of their star or status, also receive a \"fork and spoon\" designation, as a subjective reflection of the overall comfort and quality of the restaurant. Rankings range from one to five: one fork and spoon represents a \"comfortable restaurant\" and five signifies a \"luxurious restaurant\". Forks and spoons colored red designate a restaurant that is considered \"pleasant\" as well.\n\nRestaurants, independently of their other ratings in the guide, can also receive a number of other symbols next to their listing.\n\n\nThe Michelin Green Guides review and rate attractions other than restaurants. There is a Green Guide for France as a whole, and a more detailed one for each of ten regions within France. Other Green Guides cover many countries, regions, and cities outside France. Many Green Guides are published in several languages. They include background information and an alphabetical section describing points of interest. Like the Red Guides, they use a three-star system for recommending sites ranging from \"worth a trip\" to \"worth a detour\", and \"interesting\".\n\nPascal Rémy, a veteran France-based Michelin inspector, and also a former Gault Millau employee, wrote a tell-all book published in 2004 entitled \"L'Inspecteur se met à table\" (literally, \"The Inspector Sits Down at the Table\"; idiomatically, \"The Inspector Spills the Beans\", or \"The Inspector Lays It All on the Table\"). Rémy's employment was terminated in December 2003 when he informed Michelin of his plans to publish his book. He brought a court case for unfair dismissal, which was unsuccessful.\n\nRémy described the French Michelin inspector's life as lonely, underpaid drudgery, driving around France for weeks on end, dining alone, under intense pressure to file detailed reports on strict deadlines. He maintained that the guide had become lax in its standards. Though Michelin states that its inspectors visited all 4,000 reviewed restaurants in France every 18 months, and all starred restaurants several times a year, Rémy said only about one visit every 3½ years was possible because there were only 11 inspectors in France when he was hired, rather than the 50 or more hinted by Michelin. That number, he said, had shrunk to five by the time he was fired in December 2003.\n\nRémy also accused the guide of favoritism. He alleged that Michelin treated famous and influential chefs, such as Paul Bocuse and Alain Ducasse, as \"untouchable\" and not subject to the same rigorous standards as lesser-known chefs. Michelin denied Rémy's charges, but refused to say how many inspectors it actually employed in France. In response to Rémy's statement that certain three-star chefs were sacrosanct, Michelin said, \"There would be little sense in saying a restaurant was worth three stars if it weren't true, if for no other reason than that the customer would write and tell us.\"\n\nSome non-French food critics have alleged that the rating system is biased in favor of French cuisine or French dining standards. In the UK \"The Guardian\" commented in 1997 that \"some people maintain the guide's principal purpose is as a tool of Gallic cultural imperialism\". When Michelin published its first New York City Red Guide in 2005 Steven Kurutz of \"The New York Times\" noted that Danny Meyer's Union Square Cafe, a restaurant rated highly by \"The New York Times\", Zagat Survey, and other prominent guides, received a no star-rating from Michelin (he did, however, acknowledge that the restaurant received positive mention for its ambiance, and that two other restaurants owned by Meyer received stars). Kurutz also said the guide appeared to favor restaurants that \"emphasized formality and presentation\" rather than a \"casual approach to fine dining\". He said over half of the restaurants that received one or two stars \"could be considered French\". The Michelin Guide New York 2007 included 526 restaurants, compared to 2,014 in Zagat New York 2007; after The Four Seasons Restaurant received no stars in that edition, co-owner Julian Niccolini said Michelin \"should stay in France, and they should keep their guide there\". The 2007 guide does, however, include menus, recipes, and photographs, and description of the atmosphere of starred restaurants.\n\nIn 2007 Tokyo's restaurants were awarded with the most stars and in 2010 other Japanese cities like Kyoto and Osaka also received many stars. At the time this sparked questions from some over whether these high ratings were merited for Japanese restaurants, or whether the Michelin guide was too generous in giving out stars to gain an acceptance with Japanese customers and to enable the parent tyre-selling company to market itself in Japan. But the discrepancy is easily explained by the number of restaurants in total: Tokyo has 160,000 restaurants while Paris for example has just 40,000. \"The Wall Street Journal\" reported in 2010 that some Japanese chefs were surprised at receiving a star, and were reluctant to accept one, because the publicity caused an unmanageable jump in booking, affecting their ability to serve their traditional customers without lowering their quality.\n\nSome restaurateurs have asked Michelin to revoke a star, because they felt that it created undesirable customer expectations or pressure to spend more on service and decor. Some cases:\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

During the 1981–82 OHL season he scored 42 goals, and after the season was drafted with the 15th selection in the first round of the 1982 NHL Entry Draft by the New York Rangers. He split his time in both the NHL and minor leagues in his first two seasons.\n\nHe was member of the Tulsa Oilers (CHL) team that suspended operations on February 16, 1984, playing only road games for final six weeks of 1983-84 season. Despite this adversity, the team went on to win the league's championship. Kontos spent the first half of 1985–86 playing in Finland before returning to finish the year in the AHL.

The following year, after returning from playing in Switzerland he scored three points in seven games, and his 9 playoff goals would help the Kings advance to the second round. He played only 11 games (6 regular season, 5 playoff) with Los Angeles after the 1988–89 playoff run, and decided to join the Canadian National Team in 1991–92.\n\nWhen the Tampa Bay Lightning started play in 1992–93, Kontos signed on as a free agent. His surprising 4 goal-performance led the upstart Tampa Bay Lightning to a 7–3 shocker of the Chicago Blackhawks on October 7, 1992, and remains the team record for goals scored in a single game. He scored 27 goals in 66 games, second on the team only to Brian Bradley. He would return to the National Team in 93–94, and helped Canada win a silver medal at the 1994 Olympics. Kontos would never return to the NHL, and continued to play in Sweden, the IHL and Germany before retiring in 1998.\n\nHe won the 1983-84 CHL Championship (Adams Cup) as a member of the Tulsa Oilers team coached by Tom Webster.\n"}

Walla regularly performed at these shows, as well as serving as MC. One performance by Walla included a song by PJ Harvey. These early Open Microphone shows proved popular and continued for over twenty years, moving from Bothell High School to Inglemoor High School when teacher Drumheller transferred there. Walla was in a short-lived band called The Wallflowers (not to be confused with The Wallflowers of California). Later, in 2001, he was an early member of the Seattle band The Long Winters.\n\nWalla joined Death Cab for Cutie in 1997, while attending Western Washington University in Bellingham, Washington. Eventually releasing seven albums, four EPs and two live EPs with the band, he co-wrote many of their hit songs, including \"Title and Registration\" and \"I Will Possess Your Heart\".\n\nOn August 13, 2014, after 17 years with Death Cab for Cutie, Chris Walla decided to part ways with the band, stating that he plans to \"...continue making music, producing records, and erring on the side of benevolence and beauty whenever possible.\" Walla's last performance with the band occurred on September 13, 2014 at the Rifflandia Music Festival in Victoria, British Columbia.\n\nWalla has recorded a variety of solo material and released his debut solo album, \"Field Manual\", in 2008 on Barsuk Records. The song \"Sing Again\" became available for free download from Barsuk's website. Before the release of \"Field Manual\", it was reported that two tracks recorded for Death Cab for Cutie's 2005 album, \"Plans\", would be featured, but this is unconfirmed. Some of Walla's solo work has been released using the name Martin Youth Auxiliary, such as a cassette was released in 1999 on Elsinor Records.\n\nA solo instrumental album, titled \"Tape Loops\", was released on October 16, 2015.\n\nIn addition to being a musician Walla has a long career as producer, earning production, engineering, and mixing credits on over thirty albums and EPs. His first credit was as the producer for Death Cab for Cutie's debut album, \"Something About Airplanes\", released in 1998. Walla has produced all releases by Death Cab for Cutie to date, with the exceptions of Thank You For Today, Kintsugi and 1997's \"You Can Play These Songs with Chords\" EP, which was produced by Ben Gibbard. However, Walla earned production credits on the 2002 re-release of \"You Can Play These Songs with Chords\", which featured 10 new songs. It was announced via Kelly Porter's Facebook Page Walla would be doing guitar work for her upcoming recording work.\n\nWalla founded his own recording studio, located within his home in Portland, Oregon, named the Alberta Court. Prior to moving to Portland, from 2000 to 2005, he was the owner/proprietor of Seattle recording studio, the Hall of Justice, where Death Cab for Cutie and many Pacific Northwest bands recorded over the years. In 2012, Walla began rebuilding the Hall of Justice after moving back to Seattle.\n\nWalla married knitwear designer and illustrator Dianna Potter in February 2013, at the Swedish Cultural Center in Seattle.\n\n\n"}

It accommodated between 18 and 25 passengers, with a separate two-crew forward cockpit. The S-43 was known as the \"Baby Clipper\" in airline service.\n\nOn April 14, 1936, an S-43 with a payload, piloted by Boris Sergievsky, set an altitude record for amphibious aircraft when it reached an altitude of 27,950 feet above Stamford, Connecticut. Also aboard was designer Igor Sikorsky.\n\nIn total, approximately 53 S-43s were built, including examples of the twin-tailed S-43B.\n\nThe S-43 was used primarily by Pan American World Airways for flights to Cuba and within Latin America. Inter-Island Airways of Hawaii (Inter-Island changed its name to Hawaiian Airlines in 1941) was the launch customer for the S-43. Inter-Island operated four S-43's to ferry Pan Am Clipper passengers and local residents from Honolulu throughout the Hawaiian Islands. Inter-Island sold its only twin-tail version to KLM. One aircraft was purchased by Norwegian airline Det Norske Luftfartselskap. Panair do Brasil operated seven aircraft. Five S-43s were used between 1937 and 1945 by the French company Aéromaritime on a colonial airway between Dakar (Senegal) and Pointe-Noire (Congo). Reeve Aleutian Airways owned two S-43s during the 1950s, one operational (N53294 purchased 1948 and trade for G-21 in 1957) and one for spares (fuselage at Alaska Aviation Heritage Museum). Another S-43 was operated in Alaska with an unknown operator, wrecked at Chignik, AK, 1950s.\n\nFive aircraft were acquired by the U.S. Army Air Corps in 1937 under the designation OA-8 and were used for transport of freight and passengers. 17 aircraft were procured by the U.S. Navy between 1937 and 1939 as the JRS-1, two of which served the U.S. Marine Corps. One JRS survived in service at the end of 1941.\n\nThe Smithsonian National Air & Space Museum's Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center in Virginia has now put a Sikorsky JRS-1 on display. This aircraft was on duty at Pearl Harbor on December 7th, 1941.\n\nTwo aircraft went to private owners: Harold Vanderbilt and Howard Hughes. Hughes' S-43 N440 remains the last example of this aircraft type flying . It is now owned by Kermit Weeks and has been relocated from Texas to the restoration facility at the Fantasy of Flight Museum in Polk City, Florida where it is awaiting reassembly and restoration.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Although \"hastily arranged and not very well conceived\", the Birmingham event featured dances, two \"Gay Days\" in Cannon Hill Park and a march up New Street from the Bull Ring, culminating in a small rally on the steps of Birmingham Town Hall.

{"id": "2036431", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2036431", "title": "Sound-powered telephone", "text": "Sound-powered telephone\n\nA sound-powered telephone is a communication device that allows users to talk to each other with the use of a handset, similar to a conventional telephone, but without the use of external power. This technology has been used since at least 1944 for both routine and emergency communication on ships to allow communication between key locations on a vessel if power, including batteries, are not available. A sound-powered phone circuit can have two or more stations on the same circuit. The circuit is always live, thus a user begins speaking rather than dialing another station. Sound-powered telephones are not normally connected to a telephone exchange.\n\nThe microphone transducer converts sound pressure from a user's voice into an electric current, which is then converted back to sound by a transducer at the receiver nodes. The most significant distinction between ordinary telephones and sound-powered telephones is in the operation of the microphone. Since the microphones used in most telephones are designed to modulate a supplied electric current they cannot be used in sound-powered transducers. Most sound-powered telephones use a dynamic microphone. A common approach to transducer design is the balanced armature design because of its efficiency. The number of simultaneous listeners is limited because there is no amplification of the signal. \n\nA sound-powered telephone circuit can be as simple as two handsets connected together with a pair of wires, which is defined as the \"talk\" portion of the circuit. Talk circuits can be realized over a pair of wires that are 50 km (30 miles) long. More complex circuits include magnetos, selector switches and bells to allow one user to select and call another, which is defined as the \"calling\" portion of the circuit. The voice communication (\"talk\") circuit is completely separate from the \"call\" circuit, allowing communication to take place without external power.\n\nSound-powered telephones are widely used on ships. A typical example on a U.S. Navy ship is the \"JL\" circuit which is used by the lookouts to report visual contacts to the pilot house and the Combat Information Center (CIC). In this case there would be five stations on the circuit (stern lookout, port lookout, starboard lookout, pilot house and CIC).\n\nU.S. Coast Guard Regulations require this emergency communication capability in most vessels today and dictate where phones should be located. A dial telephone system with a battery backup will not meet the USCG Regulations as they currently exist.\n\nOther uses for sound-powered telephone technology today include emergency communications systems for high-rise buildings, draw bridges, ski lifts, and temporary locations where reliable communication is necessary. These types of systems allow for two or more parties to be able to talk to one another in areas that experience loss-of-power or when radio communication is hampered by RF signal losses and/or limitations.\n\nSki lifts use sound-powered phones extensively. Because there are only two handsets (rarely three, where there is a mid station), sound-powered phones are ideal. They are used to confirm actions of the lift with the other operator, and abnormal operation of the lift machinery. \n\nMany different types of equipment have attempted to replace sound-powered telephones on ships. Due to the rugged, reliable and power-free nature of this equipment, it remains in use on all US military vessels, commercial vessels and work boats.\n\n"}
{"id": "2036433", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2036433", "title": "Chutu dynasty", "text": "Chutu dynasty\n\nThe Chutu dynasty (IAST: Cuṭu) ruled parts of the Deccan region of South India between first and third centuries CE, with its capital at Banavasi in present-day Karnataka state. The Chutus probably rose to power as Satavahanas feudatories, and assumed sovereignty after the decline of the Satavahana power. Except for the edicts of Asoka, the inscriptions of the Chutu dynasty are the oldest documents found in the northern part of Karnataka State, India.\n\nThe name \"Chutu-\"kula\"\" (\"Chutu family\") is found in the contemporary inscriptions. The coins attributed to the family bear the legends \"Raño Cuṭukaḷānaṃdasa\" (\"of king Chutukalananda\"), \"Raño Muḷānaṃdasa\", and \"Raño Sivaḷānaṃdasa\". The word \"Cuṭukaḷānaṃdasa\" was misread as \"Cuṭukaḍānaṃdasa\" by some earlier scholars, leading to different theories about the names of the kings and their dynasty. For example, numismatist E. J. Rapson (1908) theorized that \"Chutu-kada-nanda\" meant \"Joy of the City of the Chutus\".\n\nThe word \"Chutu\" in Kannada language means \"crest\". Chutu inscriptions contain the emblem of the cobra hood implying \"Chutu\" meant the \"cobra crest\". This connects the Chutus to the Nagas tribes as they also associated themselves with the region of the western Deccan called Nagara Khanda around modern Banavasi. The words \"Sudu (Chutu)\" is frequently used in the classical literature for cobra hood. Thus the \"Chutukula\" can be taken to stand for \"Nagakula\", a family of the Nagas.\n\nAccording to numismatist Michael Mitchiner (1983), these names appear to be matronymics. For example, \"Raño Muḷānaṃdasa\" means \"of king Mulananda\", where \"Mulananda\" is a matronymic meaning \"son (\"nanda\") of a queen belonging to the Mula gotra\". Similarly, \"Sivaḷānaṃdasa\" means \"of the son of a queen belonging to the Sivala gotra\". Mitchiner theorizes that \"Chutu-kula-nanda-sa\" (IAST: \"Cuṭukaḷānaṃdasa\", \"son of a queen belonging to the Chutu family\") was a common name borne by multiple kings of the dynasty. This theory is based on the fact that the Banavasi inscription of king Haritiputra Vishnukada Chutukulananda Satakarni was issued shortly before the Kadamba occupation of Banavasi in c. 345, while the coins bearing the name Chutukulananda can be dated to two centuries earlier based on the stratification at Chandravalli excavations.\n\nHistorian M. Rama Rao used the term \"Ananda family\" to describe the family, because the coin legends mention kings whose names end in \"-nanda\". Numismatists P.L. Gupta and A. V. Narasimha Murthy also followed this interpretation.\n\nAt least two of the Chutu kings bore the title \"Satakarni\", which is associated with the more notable Satavahana dynasty, and which was also borne by ministers and ordinary people in the Satavahana period. The exact relationship between the Chutus and the Satavahanas is uncertain. Modern historians varoiusly believe that the Chutu family originated as a branch of the Satavahanas, was descended from the Satavahana princesses, or simply succeeded the Satavahanas in southern Deccan.\n\nNumismatist Michael Mitchiner speculates that the Chutus may have been of Indo-Scythian (Shaka) origin. According to him, some Chutu coins bear designs copied from the Indo-Scythian coins. For example, the obverse of the two lead coins found at Kondapur features a swastika surrounded by a legend \"reminds one of the Kshaharata coins stuck for Ladhanes and Pisayu\"; the reverse of the same coin bears an arrow and a thunderbolt that seems to be derived from the coins of Bhumaka and Nahapana. According to V. V. Mirashi's interpretation, the issuers of such coins variously call themselves Shakas or members of the Chutu family. Mirashi and Mitchiner read the legend on the coin as \"Mahasenapatisa Baradajaputasa Saga Mana Chutukulasa\", which means \"of the \"Maha-senapati\" (chief commander) Saka Mana, the son of Baradaja, of the Chutu family. Mitchiner notes that according to a Nashik inscription, the Satavahana king Gautamiputra Satakarni issued an order from his \"camp of victory\" at Vaijayanti (the ancient name of Banavasi). He theorizes that the Chutus were originally Indo-Scythian chiefs, who became Satavahana feudatories, when Gautamiputra defeated the Indo-Scythian king Nahapana around c. 125 CE. Subsequently, they participated in the Satavahana military campaigns: one Chutu chief was appointed as the \"Mahasenapati\" in the Kondapur region, while another was appointed to govern the newly-captured city of Banavasi.\n\nHistorian D. C. Sircar has disputed Mirashi's reading of the coin legend, arguing that the expression \"Saga Mana Chutukulasa\" cannot be interpreted to refer to \"Saka Mana of the Chutu family\". Sircar argues that if this was the meaning intended, the expression would have been \"Chutu-kulasa Saga-Manasa\" or \"Chutu-kula-Saga-Manasa\". Sircar instead reads the term \"Saga-Mana\" as \"Sagamana\" (\"of the Sagamas, that is, belonging to the Sagama family\").\n\nThe Chutus ruled a kingdom centered around the city Banavasi in present-day Karnataka for over two centuries, from c. 125 CE to c. 345 CE.\n\nThe Chutus were probably subordinate to the Satavahanas in the beginning, and assumed independence when the Satavahana power declined. They were probably one of the several dynasties that are described collectively as \"\"Andhra-bhritya\"\" (\"servants of the Andhras, that is, the Satavahanas) in the Puranas. Numismatic evidence suggests that the Chutus were surrounded by other Satavahana feudatories: the Kuras of Kolhapur in the north and the Sadakana Maharathis of Chandravalli. The coins issued by these three families are similar, and most of these coins, can be dated to the 2nd century CE. Coins discovered at Chandravalli and Kondapur bear the legend \"Maharathi Sadakana Chutu Krishna\", which suggests that the Chutus consolidated their power by intermarriage with the other feudatory families.\n\nNumismatic evidence also indicates that by the last quarter of the 2nd century CE, the power of these three feudatory families was eclipsed by the Satavahanas, who appear to have assumed greater control over their territories. This is suggested by the discovery of the coins of the Satavahana ruler Yajna Sri Satakarni at Bramhapuri (Kolhapur) and Chandravalli: the Satavahana coins were found a more recent strata compared to the coins of the feudatory dynasties.\n\nWhen the Satavahana power declined in the first half of the 3rd century CE, the Chutus retained their authority at Banavasi, unlike the Kuras and the Sadakana Maharathis. Their rule is attested by at least four inscriptions dated between the 260s and the 340s CE. After the fall of the Satavahanas, the Chutus appear to have controlled the far-flung areas of the south-western parts of the erstwhile Satavahana empire. They subsequently extended their power in the north and east. According to historian Teotónio de Souza, the Chutus probably also controlled Kunkalli, Balli, and Kankon in present-day Goa, as subordinates of the Bhojas.\n\nAfter the demise of Satavahana emperor Gautami-putra Yajna Satakarni in 181 CE, the old dynasty (Satavahanas) lost control of the western provinces, which passed into the hands of another family of Satakarnis, the Chutu-kula. Chutu dynasty came to an end probably in the first or second half of the third century i.e. around 250-275 CE. Of the Chutu dynasty two kings are known through inscriptions, Hariti-putra Chutu-kadananda Satakarni and his grandson Hariti-putra Siva-skanda-varman, who ruled in Banawasi (Vaijayantipura) before the Kadamba dynasty. In 222 CE, Prithivi-sena, son of Rudra-sena I, was reigning as the Western Kshatrapa ruler, in succession to the latter - Hariti-putra Siva-skanda-varman.\n\nE. J. Rapson, while discussing the history of Nasik district, supposes that during the interregnum between the last known Satavahana inscription of Yajna-Sri Satakarni in the 7th year of his reign in 159 CE and the first Nasik inscription of the Abhira king Ishvarasena, son of Abhira Sivadatta, in his 9th regnal year (somewhere in the 3rd century CE before 236 CE), the Nasik district might have passed immediately into the power of these Abhiras, either during the reign, or after the reign of Sri-Yajna (in 181 CE), or it may have first been held by the Chutu family of Satakarnis, the 'other Andhras' or 'Andhra-Bhrtyas' ('servants of the Andhras') of the Puranas, who undoubtedly were in possession of the neighbouring maritime province of Aparanta.\n\nE. J. Rapson theorises that Skandanagasataka of Kanheri inscription is identical with Sivaskandanagasri of the Banavasi inscription of Haritiputra-Visnukada-Chutukulananda Satakarni of his 12th year of reign. G. J. Dubreuil concludes that Chutus succeeded the Satavahanas not only in Mysore (Karnataka) but also in Aparanta and western Maharashtra after Yajnasri Satakarni's reign ended in 190 CE with his death. Later the Chutus held sway over the northern parts of Kannada and Malayalam (Malabar) speaking regions.\n\nThe Chutus appear to have continued the policy of consolidating their power by intermarriage with their neighbours: this is suggested by an Ikshvaku dynasty record which states that the \"Maharaja of Vanavasa\" (presumably the Chutu ruler of Banavasi) married a daughter of the Ikshvaku king Vira-purusha-datta. Mitchiner also believes that the occurrence of the name \"Satakarni\" in the names of the Chutu kings (Vishnurudra Sivalananda Satakarni and Haritiputra Vishnukada Chutukulananda Satakarni) suggests that the Chutus also married into the Satavahana family. The Chutu king Sivalananda is attested by a 278 CE inscription of the Abhira ruler Vasushena from Nagarjunakonda.\n\nAccording to Mitchiner, the designs on the Chutu coins suggest that they were Buddhists. The Chutu rule seems to have ended when Mayurasharman established the Kadamba dynasty with its capital at Banavasi in c. 345 CE.\n\nThe Chalukya dynasty of Badami, which later controlled much of the present-day Karnataka, claimed descent from a son of Hariti (a woman of the Harita gotra) and of Manavya gotra. The Chalukyas had appropriated this genealogy from the Kadamba dynasty, who ruled Banavasi before them and after the Chutus. The Kadambas, in turn, had appropriated this genealogy from the Chutus.\n\nHistorian Sailendra Nath Sen theorizes that the Chalukyas was related to the Chutus and the Kadambas \"in some way\".\n\nBanavasi (Vanavasi or Vaijayanti in Uttara Kannada district, Karnataka) stone inscription mentions Haritiputra Visnukada Chutukulananda Satakarni who in the 12th year of his reign made a gift of a \"Nagashilpa\", a tank and a \"Vihara\". The nearby Malavalli inscription refers the same king Manavyasa Gotra Haritiputra Visnukadda Chutukulananda Satakarni, the king of Banavasi, who in the 1st year of his reign made the grant of a village. Stone inscription on the same pillar of a Kadamba king of 5th century mentions a prior chieftain Manavyasa Gotra Haritiputra Vaijayantipati Sivaskandavarman who also ruled this area.\n\nHaritiputra-Satakarni issued an order to the chief revenue commissioner \"Mahavallabha-Rajjuka\" to grant a village of Sahalavati to a certain Kondamana as a Brahmin endowment in 175 CE for the enjoyment of the Mattapatti (Malavalli) god with the exemption of the soldier's entry \"(abhatappavesam)\". Another record states that king Satakami had a daughter named Mahabhoja-Nagasri who made a grant of a tank and a Vihara to the Madhukeswara temple.\n\nThis inscription is on the \"Nagapratima\" from the Chutu period kept in the Madhukeswara temple in Banavasi, which read thus- \"To the prefect! In the year 12 of the century of the king (being) Haritiputa Satakarni, the cherisher of the Vehnukadachutu family, the 7th fortnight of the winter months, 1st day, the meritorious gift of the Mahabhuvi (Mahabhoji) the king's daughter, Sivakhanda Nagasri, wife of Jivaputa, with her son - of a \"naga,\" a tank and a \"vihara.\" These three are works by the prime minister, Khadasati. Nataka, the disciple of Damoraka and son of the Acharya Jayantaka and inhabitant of Sajayataka (Sanjayanti), made the \"Naga\".\"\n\nMalavalli (near Banavasi-Talagunda) area in Nagarakhanda area of west-central Karnataka was under the control of Satavahana and Chutu rulers right from the 2nd century CE. The hexagonal pillar set up in front of the Kalleswara temple has two separate inscriptions of the Satavahana and Kadamba rulers. The first inscription assignable to Vinhukada Chutukulananda Satakami dated in 2nd century CE, is carved on three faces of the hexagonal pillar. It contains a command to his officer Mahavallabha-Rajjuka informing him of the grant of the village Sahalatavi (or Sahalavati) for the god of Malapalli (Malavalli). The gift was made on the first day of the second fortnight.\n\nThe second inscription on the Malavalli pillar assignable to 3rd-4th century CE is engraved on the remaining three faces of the pillar. It refers to the rule of the Kadamba king Sivaskanda Varman and the renewal of the above earlier grant which had become defunct to Nagadatta, a \"Brahamana\" of Kaundinya gotra in the first regnal year.\n\nBoth the inscriptions are of paramount importance to epigraphists as they record two different palaeographic styles of characters of south Indian Brahmi of two different periods. While the earlier is in the typical triangular nail headed characters of 2nd and 3rd century CE, the latter is in typical Kadamba box headed characters of 3rd and 4th century CE.\n\nThere is another inscription at Kanheri, which in the absence of the king's name has hitherto been assigned conjecturally to the reign of Pulumavi. But, according to E. J. Rapson, internal evidence proves that this attribution is incorrect. The donor mentioned in the inscription is Nagamulanika. She is the wife of a Maharathi, the daughter of a Mahabhoja and of the Great King, and the mother of \"Khamda-naga-Sataka\" (Skanda-naga-Sataka). There can be no doubt that she is to be identified with the donor mentioned in the inscription from Banavasi, and that she was, therefore, the daughter of King Haritrputra Visnu-kada-Cutu Satakarni, whose name must have stood originally in the present inscription.\n\nThe Chutu coins have been discovered at Karwar and Chandravalli.\n\nTheir coins are mostly of lead, belonging to Mulananda c. 125-345. One coin shows Arched hill (or Stupa?) with river motif below on the Obverse and Tree within railed lattice; Nandipada to right on the Reverse.\n\nThe large lead coins of the Anantapur and Cuddapah districts have a doubtful reading 'Hariti'. Perhaps they refer to Haritiputra Siva Skanda Varman and Haritiputra Vishnu Kad-Cutukula Satakarni.\n\nCoins of Rano Chutukadananda (70 BCE), the 1st known ruler of the Chutu dynasty whose name was inscribed on them as \"Rano Chutukadanamdasa\" were discovered from Karwar and Banavasi surroundings of the ancient Nagarakhanda (Bandalike) town regions.\n\nThe following Chutu rulers are known from coins and inscriptions:\n\n\n"}

He was the 4th son of Rt. Hon. George Augustus Chichester May, Lord Chief Justice of Ireland, and his wife Olivia Barrington. May was educated at Harrow School and Trinity College, Dublin, where a few of his predecessors to the Governorship of Hong Kong attended school. May received the 1st Honourman and Prizeman Classics and Modern Languages and B.A. in 1881.\n\nIn 1881, May was appointed to a Hong Kong Cadetship after a competitive examination. In 1886, he became the Assistant Protector of Chinese and private secretary to Governor Sir William Des Vœux. He was also the private secretary to Acting Administrator Digby Barker from 1889 to 1891.\n\nMay would hold the office of Assistant Colonial Secretary in 1891 and Acting Colonial Treasurer in 1892. He was made a member of the Legislative Council in 1895.\n\nFrom 1893 to 1901, May was the Captain Superintendent of the Hong Kong Police Force, and Superintendent of Victoria Gaol and Fire Brigade between 1896 and 1902.\n\nHe was appointed to the position of Colonial Secretary for Hong Kong in April 1902, serving until 21 January 1911, and as such was appointed acting administrator of Hong Kong during transitions totalling almost a year between governors in 1903-1904 and 1907. In 1911, May was appointed Governor of Fiji and High Commissioner Western Pacific, a position he would hold until 1912.\n\nIn 1912, May was appointed Governor of Hong Kong, a position he occupied in his own right until 1918. It was also his last post in the Colonial Service.\n\nMay was the only Governor of Hong Kong to be the target of an assassination attempt. He was fired upon near the General Post Office as he rode in a sedan chair after arriving from Fiji in July 1912. May was not injured; the bullet lodged in the sedan of his wife. The gunman, Li Hung-hung, had a grudge against May. Several years before, this former Police Superintendent had imprisoned Li's father, an undesirable mainland immigrant. May used a car for daily transport from then onwards.\n\nOn 22 January 1918, May personally negotiated with the remaining member of a gang holed up in the \"Siege of Gresson Street\", following a running gun battle through the streets of Wanchai in which five police officers were killed.\n\nIn 1919, due to deteriorating health condition, May was relieved of his duty as the Governor.\n\nMay married Helena Barker in 1891.

Its syllabus has diversified into , MMA and Brazilian Jiu Jitsu systems but it is still koryu and Teki Kyoko oriented. It is informally identified as simply the organization or Irgun (translation: organization), and trains in Martial arts, Meditation, fitness and outdoor skills. Now having 12 dojos in Israel, the school's veterans instruct about 700 undergraduates and veteran students. It is rated by the Israeli martial arts community as the institution having the longest time to accumulate syllabus for applying for a black belt exam (12 to 13 years) in Israel.\n\nThe school was founded in 1986 in Jerusalem by Yossi Sheriff, senior instructor of Doron Navon, the first non Japanese Shihan in Bujinkan Ninjutsu school. Navon started teaching as a Bujinkan Shidoshi in a rural area at 1977. In 1992, in conjunction with Bujinkan Israel the school wrote and directed the first state sanctioned Ninjutsu/Budo Taijutsu instructor's course.\nIn 1995 the Akban School parted ways from Bujinkan Israel while maintaining presence in Hatsumi's Bujinkan events.\n\nThe Akban Institute offers classes for those who want to master Martial arts. The program is authorized as a non-competitive martial arts school by the Israeli ministry of Science Culture and Sports. The Akban School also issues ranks. The relatively long time span for belt exams stems from the large syllabus learnt. The modernized Kyu system is used and the minimum time in dojo before a black belt exam is 12–14 years. Today, Akban veteran instructors teach in fifteen main dojos (Main, School, International, Women's, Boys), plus a 'veteran' dojo for practitioners who have been training more than 20 years and special technique study uses.\n\nThe Akban project is a non commercial, creative commons, effort to collect, create and freely spread knowledge about martial arts and related fitness programs. Its main features reside in the main website of the school. The chief feature of the Akban project is a community online encyclopedia. The main lines explored in the encyclopedia are martial arts and fitness.\n\nThe Akban-wiki has thousands of self produced articles and videos. It started in 1998 when two Akban veterans started organizing the vast X-kan syllabus learnt in Akban into a computerized database. The methodical backbone of this project was a system for allocating different stages of learning in martial fields called \"The Methodical Pyramid\". Many fields have benefited from the sharing and distribution of safe knowledge and training methods. The huge amount of material practiced in the necessitated means to organize and validate the techniques used. In 2005, the work on the database shifted toward a mash-up of user generated media. The work has culturally profited from the addition of Kaltura, an online application that allows wiki-like video editing and revisions by the wiki users. \nThe Akban project organizes visual materials in a semantic web. This is achieved by installing a Semantic wiki and starting to apply interrelations between the techniques of same and different martial arts. The videos and articles are tagged with categories and the categories hierarchically nestle inside meta categories using a logical tree. The semantic functions allow the Akban-wiki skilled user to give each article and video attributes and describe the relations between them.\n\nAll students study and are tested on an augmented Bujinkan syllabus and martial arts theory in addition to Judo, BJJ, Muay Thai and weapon katas from Tenshin Shōden Katori Shintō-ryū.\n\nThe Akban School organizes international seminars for students of Akban veteran instructors. These seminars expand the Bujinkan syllabus practiced in the dojo and bring to Israel internationally acclaimed martial arts teachers. Notable teachers in Akban seminars are Renzo Gracie, De la Riva, Alexander Zhelezniak and Hernan Cortes .\n\nAkban veterans and able students are involved in extreme fitness events where sparring is practiced for extended periods of time.\n\n"}

Despite the reclassification as a 'Stadt' (town, though the German understanding leans towards city) years ago due to surpassing the relevant population threshold, the former appellation Gemeinde (parish) seems more appropriate (particularly to the inhabitants) due to the spread-out villages it consists of.\n\nThe main settlement is in the Agger valley, with others spread on the hills surrounding it. The \"kleine Heckberg\" (small Heckberg, 348 m) near Federath is the highest point of Overath, and the whole \"Rheinisch-Bergischer Kreis\".\n\nNeighbouring cities are Rösrath in the West, Bergisch Gladbach in the North-West, Lindlar in the North-East, Engelskirchen in the East and Much, Neunkirchen-Seelscheid and Lohmar in the South.\n\nOverath is divided into 7 parts.\n\nWhen first mentioned in 1060, Overath was called \"Achera\" (after the Agger river). Presumably because of the first settlement at a clearing (German \"Rodung\") the name changed to \"Ouerode\" (about 1280), \"Ovverode\" (1304), \"Overadt\" (1582), and finally became \"Overath\".\n\nThe coat of arms of Overath was only created on March 3, 1938. It consists of two areas:\n\nThe Catholic church is devoted to Saint Walpurga (\"Heilige Walburga\"). Until 1803 the Benedictines had a monastery in \"Cyriax\", a subsidiary of Michaelsberg Abbey at Siegburg.\n\nThe Catholic church in Heiligenhaus is devoted to Saint Roch (\"Heiliger Rochus\").\n\n\"Marialinden\"'s church (\"St. Mariä Heimsuchung\") is a pilgrimage destination for Saint Mary.\n\nIn 1939, the population of Overath was 6,500. In 1946, it already exceeded 10,500 and continued to grow to 15,500 in 1970. The area of the community was extended in 1975, which increased the population to over 20,000.\n\nSince then it has risen further up to 27,106 in December 2005.\n\nThe B 55 und B 484 federal roads (German \"Bundesstraßen\") as well as the A 4 Autobahn pass through area of the town. The A 4 has got two exits to Overath, Overath-Untereschbach and Overath.\n\nThe Cologne Bonn Airport is reachable within 25 minutes.\n\nThe railway station in Overath connects the Town with Cologne and Marienheide. The train heading for Cologne departs every 30 minutes, the train heading for Marienheide departs every 60 minutes. Cologne is reachable by train in within 35 minutes.\n\nThese traffic connections, together with rural surroundings, make Overath a popular place to live for commuters.\n\nThere is no hospital in Overath. The hospitals in Bergisch Gladbach and Engelskirchen do the medication.\n\nThe city council consists of 38 members. The current breakdown, from the general elections held September 26, 2004, is as follows:\n\nJörg Weigt (SPD) was elected mayor (German \"Bürgermeister\"). His first representative is Guido Lazotta (CDU), his second representative is Rolf Trefz (SPD).\n\n"}
{"id": "2036479", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2036479", "title": "Guide book", "text": "Guide book\n\nA guide book or travel guide is \"a book of information about a place designed for the use of visitors or tourists\". It will usually include information about sights, accommodation, restaurants, transportation, and activities. Maps of varying detail and historical and cultural information are often included. Different kinds of guide books exist, focusing on different aspects of travel, from adventure travel to relaxation, or aimed at travelers with different incomes, or focusing on sexual orientation or types of diet.\n\nTravel guides can also take the form of travel websites.\n\nA forerunner of the guidebook was the \"periplus\", an itinerary from landmark to landmark of the ports along a coast. A \"periplus\" such as the \"Periplus of the Erythraean Sea\" was a manuscript document that listed, in order, the ports and coastal landmarks, with approximate intervening distances, that the captain of a vessel could expect to find along a shore. This work was possibly written in the middle of the 1st century CE. It served the same purpose as the later Roman itinerarium of road stops.\n\nThe \"periegesis\", or \"progress around\" was an established \"literary\" genre during the Hellenistic age. A lost work by Agaclytus describing Olympia () is referred to by the Suda and Photius. Dionysius Periegetes (literally, Dionysius the Traveller) was the author of a description of the habitable world in Greek hexameter verse written in a terse and elegant style, intended for the \"klismos\" traveller rather than the actual tourist on the ground; he is believed to have worked in Alexandria and to have flourished around the time of Hadrian. An early \"remarkably well-informed and interesting guidebook\" was the \"Hellados Periegesis\" (\"Descriptions of Greece\") of Pausanias of the 2nd century A.D. This most famous work is a guide to the interesting places, works of architecture, sculpture, and curious customs of Ancient Greece, and is still useful to Classicists today. With the advent of Christianity, the guide for the European religious pilgrim became a useful guidebook. An early account is that of the pilgrim Egeria, who visited the Holy Land in the 4th century CE and left a detailed itinerary.\n\nIn the medieval Arab world, guide books for travelers in search of artifacts and treasures were written by Arabic treasure hunters, magicians, and alchemists. This was particularly the case in Arab Egypt, where treasure hunters were eager to find valuable ancient Egyptian antiquities. Some of the books claimed to be imbued with magic that could dispel the magical barriers believed to be protecting the artifacts.\n\nTravel literature became popular during the Song Dynasty (960–1279) of medieval China. The genre was called 'travel record literature' (youji wenxue), and was often written in narrative, prose, essay and diary style. Travel literature authors such as Fan Chengda (1126–1193) and Xu Xiake (1587–1641) incorporated a wealth of geographical and topographical information into their writing, while the 'daytrip essay' \"Record of Stone Bell Mountain\" by the noted poet and statesman Su Shi (1037–1101) presented a philosophical and moral argument as its central purpose.\n\nIn the West, the guidebook developed from the published personal experiences of aristocrats who traveled through Europe on the Grand Tour. As the appreciation of art, architecture and antiquity became ever-more essential ingredients of the noble upbringing so they predominated in the guidebooks, particularly those devoted to the Italian peninsula. Richard Lassels (1603-1668) wrote a series of manuscript guides which were eventually published posthumously in Paris and London (1670) as \"The Voyage of Italy\". Grand Tour guidebooks poured off the presses throughout the eighteenth century, those such as Patrick Brydone's \"A Tour Through Sicily and Malta\" being read by many who never left England. \n\nBetween 1626 and 1649 the Dutch publisher, Officina Elzeviriana (House of Elzevir), published a bestselling pocketbook series, the \"Respublicae Elzevirianae\" (Elzevirian Republics), which has been described as the \"ancestor of the modern travel guide\". Each volume gave information (geography, population, economy, history) on a country in Europe, Africa, the Near East or the Far East.\n\nAn important transitional figure from the idiosyncratic style of the Grand Tour travelogues to the more informative and impersonal guidebook was Mariana Starke. Her 1824 guide to travel in France and Italy served as an essential companion for British travelers to the Continent in the early 19th century. She recognized that with the growing numbers of Britons traveling abroad after 1815 the majority of her readers would now be in family groups and on a budget. She therefore included for the first time a wealth of advice on luggage, obtaining passports, the precise cost of food and accommodation in each city and even advice on the care of invalid family members. She also devised a system of !!! exclamation mark ratings, a forerunner of today's star ratings. Her books, published by John Murray, served as a template for later guides.\n\nIn the United States, the first published guidebook was Gideon Minor Davison's \"The Fashionable Tour\", published in 1822, and Theodore Dwight's \"The Northern Traveller\" and Henry Gilpin's \"The Northern Tour\", both from 1825.\n\nThe modern guidebook emerged in the 1830s, with the burgeoning market for long distance tourism. The publisher John Murray began printing the \"Murray's Handbooks for Travellers\" in London from 1836. The series covered tourist destinations in Europe, Asia and northern Africa, and he introduced the concept of \"sights\" which he rated in terms of their significance using stars for Starke's exclamation points. According to scholar James Buzard, the Murray style \"exemplified the exhaustive rational planning that was as much an ideal of the emerging tourist industry as it was of British commercial and industrial organization generally.\"\nIn Germany, Karl Baedeker acquired the publishing house of Franz Friedrich Röhling in Koblenz, which in 1828 had published a handbook for travellers by Professor Johannes August Klein entitled \"Rheinreise von Mainz bis Cöln; ein Handbuch für Schnellreisende\" (\"A Rhine Journey from Mainz to Cologne; A Handbook for Travellers on the Move\"). He published this book with little changes for the next ten years, which provided the seeds for Baedeker's new approach to travel guides. After Klein died, he decided to publish a new edition in 1839, to which he added many of his own ideas on what he thought a travel guide should offer the traveller. Baedeker's ultimate aim was to free the traveller from having to look for information anywhere outside the travel guide; whether about routes, transport, accommodation, restaurants, tipping, sights, walks or prices. Baedeker emulated the style of John Murray's guidebooks, but included unprecedented detailed information.\n\nIn 1846, Baedeker introduced his star ratings for sights, attractions and lodgings, following Mrs. Starke's and Murray's. This edition was also his first 'experimental' red guide. He also decided to call his travel guides 'handbooks', following the example of John Murray III. Baedeker's early guides had tan covers, but from 1856 onwards, Murray's red bindings and gilt lettering became the familiar hallmark of all Baedeker guides as well, and the content became famous for its clarity, detail and accuracy.\nBaedeker and Murray produced impersonal, objective guides; works prior to this combined factual information and personal sentimental reflection. The availability of the books by Baedeker and Murray helped sharpen and formalize the complementary genre of the personal travelogue, which was freed from the burden of serving as a guide book. The Baedeker and Murray guide books were hugely popular and were standard resources for travelers well into the 20th century. As William Wetmore Story said in the 1860s, \"Every Englishman abroad carries a Murray for information, and a Byron for sentiment, and finds out by them what he is to know and feel by every step.\" \n\nAfter Karl Baedeker died, his son, also named Karl, inherited the Baedeker travel guide business; however, he was killed in action during World War I. British nationalism and anti-German sentiment resulted in some British people labeling Baedeker guides \"instrumental to the German war effort\", and their popularity in the United Kingdom dropped considerably. As a result, the two editors of Baedeker's English-language titles left the company and acquired the rights to Murray's Handbooks. The resulting guide books, called the Blue Guides to distinguish them from the red-covered Baedekers, constituted one of the major guide book series for much of the 20th century and are still published today.\n\nFollowing World War II, two new names emerged which combined European and American perspectives on international travel. Eugene Fodor, a Hungarian-born author of travel articles, who had emigrated to the United States before the war, wrote guidebooks which introduced English-reading audiences to continental Europe. Arthur Frommer, an American soldier stationed in Europe during the Korean War, used his experience traveling around the Continent as the basis for \"Europe on $5 a Day\" (1957), which introduced readers to options for budget travel in Europe. Both authors' guidebooks became the foundations for extensive series, eventually covering destinations around the world, including the United States. In the decades that followed, Let's Go, Lonely Planet, Insight Guides, Rough Guides, and a wide variety of similar travel guides were developed, with varying focuses.\n\nSpecialist guides for mountains have a long history owing to the special needs of mountaineering, climbing, hill walking and scrambling. The guides by W A Poucher for example, are widely used for the hill regions of Britain. There are many more special guides to the numerous climbing grounds in Britain published by the Climbers Club, for example.\n\nWith the emergence of digital technology, many publishers turned to electronic distribution, either in addition to or instead of print publication. This can take the form of downloadable documents for reading on a portable computer or hand held device such a PDA or iPod, or online information accessible via a web site. This enabled guidebook publishers to keep their information more current. Traditional guide book incumbents Lonely Planet, Frommers, Rough Guides, and In Your Pocket City Guides, and newcomers such as Schmap or Ulysses Travel Guides are now offering travel guides for download. New online and interactive guides such as Tripadvisor, Wikivoyage, and Travellerspoint enable individual travelers to share their own experiences and contribute information to the guide. Wikivoyage, CityLeaves, and Travellerspoint make the entire contents of their guides updatable by users, and make the information in their guides available as open content, free for others to use.\n\nThis list is a select sample of the full range of English language guide book publishers - either contemporary or historical.\n\n\n"}

She was involved in the suffrage movement until the Nineteenth Amendment was passed in 1920, when she voted for the first time at the age of 99. She was a founder and the first president of the Home Club of East Boston, one of the first women's clubs in Massachusetts.\n\nJudith Winsor McLauthlin was born in Marshfield, Massachusetts, on November 26, 1821, to Lewis and Polly (née Hathaway) McLauthlin. Both of her parents were descendants of people who had arrived on the \"Mayflower\". Her father was the groundskeeper for the shipbuilder Ezra Weston, and her maternal grandfather was the physician and painter Rufus Hathaway. She moved to Duxbury, Massachusetts as a young woman to take a teaching job. In 1841 (or 1842) she married an East Boston shipbuilder named Silvanus (or Sylvanus) Smith, and the couple had six children. Her daughter Zilpha Drew Smith became a prominent social worker in Boston.\n\nThe family lived for several years in Duxbury before moving to Boston. In 1871 they built a home at 76 White Street in East Boston, overlooking the Border Street shipyards. Towards the end of her life she went to live with her daughter at 11 Roanoke Avenue in Jamaica Plain. She died there on December 12, 1921, aged 100.\n\nSmith was on the Standing Committee of the congregation led by abolitionist Theodore Parker, and was involved in the abolitionist movement. \n\nIn a 1920 \"Boston Globe\" interview, Smith claimed that her father had been an abolitionist and \"had a station on the underground railway.\" Lewis McLauthlin was a vice president of the Old Colony Anti-Slavery Society, and served on its finance committee. In 1859 he unsuccessfully petitioned the Massachusetts legislature \"to enact that no person, who has been held as a slave, shall be delivered up, by any officer or court, State or Federal, within this Commonwealth, to anyone claiming him on the ground that he owes 'service or labor' to such claimant, by the laws of one of the Slave States of this Union.\"\n\nSmith was a founder and the first president of the Home Club of East Boston. Established in 1875, the Home Club was the second women's club in Massachusetts. At their first meeting, the thirty women members were addressed by the noted suffragist Julia Ward Howe. Later that year, the club women successfully petitioned the Massachusetts legislature for an amendment to the state law regarding \"nightwalking,\" so that men would be subject to it as well as women. They established a sewing school for girls, raised funds for various charities, and sent delegates to national women's club conventions. The club met monthly at Smith's home until it outgrew that space, and they began meeting at a local hall. Smith was president of the club for ten years.\n\nWhen Smith cast her first vote for president in 1920, she had been active in the women's suffrage movement for over 70 years. She served for many years as president of the East Boston Woman Suffrage League, was on the executive committees of the Massachusetts, New England, and American Woman Suffrage Associations, and was a director of the New England Women's Club. She was a friend of noted suffragists Julia Ward Howe, Lucy Stone, and Henry B.

A smaller version of the Lockheed Model 10 Electra, the Lockheed 12 was not popular as an airliner but was widely used as a corporate and government transport. Several were also used for testing new aviation technologies.\n\nAfter Lockheed had introduced its 10-passenger Model 10 Electra, the company decided to develop a smaller version which would be better suited as a \"feeder airliner\" or a corporate executive transport. At the same time, the U.S. Bureau of Air Commerce had also sensed the need for a small feeder airliner and announced a design competition for one. In order for a candidate to qualify for the competition, a prototype had to fly by June 30, 1936.\n\nLockheed based its candidate, which it named the Model 12 Electra Junior, around a scaled down Electra. It would carry only six passengers and two pilots but would use the same Pratt & Whitney R-985 Wasp Junior SB radial engines as the main Electra version, the 10A. This made it faster than the Electra, with a top speed of at . Like the Electra, the Model 12 had an all-metal structure, trailing-edge wing flaps, low-drag NACA engine cowlings, and two-bladed controllable-pitch propellers (later changed to constant-speed propellers). It also had the Electra's twin tail fins and rudders, which were becoming a Lockheed trademark. The landing gear was a conventional tail-dragger arrangement, with the main wheels retracting backwards into the engine nacelles; as was often the case with retractable gear of the period, the wheel bottoms were left exposed in case a wheels-up emergency landing was necessary.\n\nAs in the Electra and the Boeing 247, the Model 12's main wing spar passed through the passenger cabin; small steps were placed on either side of the spar to ease passenger movement. The cabin had a lavatory in the rear. Although the standard cabin layout was for six passengers, Lockheed also offered roomier, more luxurious layouts for corporate or private owners.\n\nThe new transport had its first flight on June 27, 1936, three days before the competition deadline, at 12:12 PM local time, a time deliberately chosen for the Model 12's number. As it turned out, the other two competition entries, the Beechcraft Model 18 and the Barkley-Grow T8P-1, weren't ready in time for the deadline, so Lockheed won by default. The \"Electra Junior\" name did not catch on in the way that the original Electra's name had. Most users simply referred to the aircraft by its model number, as the Lockheed 12.\n\nThe original Lockheed 12 version, with Wasp Junior engines, was the Model 12A. Almost every Lockheed 12 built was a 12A or derived from the 12A. There was also a Model 12B, using Wright R-975-E3 Whirlwind radials, but only two of this model were built. Although Lockheed had also announced a Model 12F, powered by Wright R-760 Whirlwind seven-cylinder radials, and a Model 12M, powered by Menasco six-cylinder inline engines, neither of these versions reached production.\n\nEven though the Lockheed 12 had won the government's feeder airliner competition, most of the airlines rejected it, and very few Lockheed 12s were used as airliners. One notable airline user was the newly renamed Continental Air Lines, which had a fleet of three Lockheed 12s that ran on its route between Denver, Colorado and El Paso, Texas in the late 1930s. Another was British West Indian Airways Ltd., which flew the Lockheed 12 on Caribbean routes in the Lesser Antilles during the mid-1940s.\n\nThe Lockheed 12 proved much more popular as a transport for company executives or government officials. Oil and steel companies were among the major users. A number were purchased as military staff transports by the United States Army Air Corps, which designated the type as the C-40, and by the United States Navy, which used the designation JO, or in one peculiar case, R3O-2. With the arrival of World War II, many civilian Lockheed 12s were requisitioned by the U.S. Army and Navy, Britain's Royal Air Force, and the Royal Canadian Air Force.\n\nTwo civil Lockheed 12s ordered by British Airways Ltd. were actually intended for covert military reconnaissance flights. Sidney Cotton modified these aircraft for aerial photography and in civilian guise, overflew and photographed many German and Italian military installations during the months preceding World War II.\n\nThe main military user of the Lockheed 12 was the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army Air Force, which bought 36. Sixteen of these were the Model 212, a version created by Lockheed for training bomber crews, which had a caliber machine gun in an unpowered, partly retractable gun turret on top of the fuselage, a second .303-caliber machine gun fixed in the nose, and bomb racks under the wing center section that could hold eight bombs. The other 20 aircraft were transport versions.\n\nSeveral Lockheed 12s were used as technology testbeds. The U.S. National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) bought two, adding a center vertical fin to each of them to test stability improvements. One of the NACA Lockheed 12s was used to test \"hot-wing\" deicing technology, in which hot exhaust air from the engines was ducted through the wing's leading edge to prevent ice accumulation.\n\nThree other Lockheed 12s were used to test tricycle landing gear. These had their normal landing gear replaced by a non-retracting version with a large nosewheel and with the main wheels shifted further back on the engine nacelles. (The tailwheel from the normal conventional gear was retained.) The gear was non-retractable because there wasn't room within the structure to stow it in retracted position. Streamlined fairings were placed on the gear to reduce drag. One of the tricycle gear Lockheed 12s went to the U.S. Navy as the XJO-3 and performed carrier landing tests on the to study the suitability of a twin-engined tricycle-gear aircraft for carrier operations. Another went to the U.S. Army as the C-40B, and still another was retained by Lockheed for its own testing; both of these were eventually converted back to the normal landing gear configuration.\n\nMilo Burcham flew a Lockheed 12A in the 1937 Bendix Trophy Race from Burbank, California to Cleveland, Ohio. This 12A had extra fuel tanks in the cabin, allowing it to save time by making the entire trip non-stop. The 12A came in fifth at an average speed of ; this was an impressive performance, since the first and fourth-place winners were both privately owned Seversky P-35 fighters.\n\nAnother Lockheed 12A, owned by Republic Oil Company and named \"The Texan\", was modified by aviator Jimmie Mattern for a round-the-world flight attempt. Mattern filled the 12A's cabin with fuel tanks and removed the cabin windows and door; the crew would enter the aircraft via a cockpit hatch. The aircraft was denied a U.S. permit for the flight following the Earhart incident; however, it was pressed into action in September 1937 in a long range search effort for Sigizmund Levanevsky, who crashed somewhere between the North pole and Barrow, Alaska. \"The Texan\" was outfitted as a luxury transport afterward, and lost in a hangar fire in January 1938.\n\nLockheed built a total of 130 Lockheed 12s, ending production in 1941. With the arrival of World War II, Lockheed concentrated its production efforts on more advanced military aircraft, such as the Hudson bomber and the P-38 Lightning twin-engined fighter. The Lockheed 12's market was left to the Beechcraft Model 18, thousands of which would eventually be produced.\n\nA number of Lockheed 12s have survived to the present day, mostly in private hands. Several of these are still flying.\n\n\nAll of these were based on the Model 12A and used the same engines.\n\n\n\n\nA Lockheed 12 appeared as the French airliner in the climactic final scene from the 1942 film \"Casablanca\". (The aircraft carries the Air France seahorse logo, although Air France did not actually operate the type.) A \"cut-out\" stood in for a real Lockheed 12 in many shots. No real aircraft appeared in the movie. Half and quarter scale models were used instead.\n\nLockheed 12s have also appeared in movies as stand-ins for the Electra 10E used by Amelia Earhart in her round-the-world flight attempt. Two played this role in the NBC 1976 TV miniseries \"Amelia Earhart\", and another did so in the 2009 movie \"Amelia\".\n\n"}

Since 2016, Alexa Internet rankings tend to show it as the world's most visited language Wikipedia after the English Wikipedia.\n\nIt is the largest Wikipedia written in any Slavic language, surpassing its nearest rival, the Polish Wikipedia, eightfold by the parameter of . In addition, the Russian Wikipedia is the largest Wikipedia written in Cyrillic or in a script other than Latin script. In April 2016, the project had 3,377 active editors who made at least five edits in that month, ranking third behind the English and Spanish versions.\n\nDifficult issues are resolved through the , which handles content disputes, blocks users or prohibits certain users from editing articles on certain topics.\n\nAdministrators (currently ) are elected through a vote; a minimum quorum of 30 voters and 66% of support votes are required if the request is to be considered successful. Administrators who have become inactive (i.e. have not used administrative tools, such as \"delete\" or \"block\" buttons, at least 25 times in six months) may lose their privileges by an Arbitration Committee decision.\n\nAs of 1 June 2012, some of the biggest categories (which contain more than 5,000 articles) in the Russian Wikipedia are:\n\n10,340 articles contain material from the \"Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary\". More than 47,000 articles were translated from the English Wikipedia.\n\nIn 2019 the Russian Wikipedia has 469 thousand unique categories and 11.31% of them do not have appropriate page in the category namespace. The average article in this language version has 11 categories, while number of unique categories per articles ratio is 0.305. The largest number of articles has People (19%) and Nature (9%) category. In Russian Wikipedia the highest average quality has articles related to Events and Military. Content about Entertainment is read more often and has the highest authors' interest on average.\n\nIn addition to common Wikipedia namespaces, the Russian Wikipedia has three custom ones: \"Incubator\" (# 102–103) – which is used as a training camp for new users and their first articles, \"Project\" (# 104–105) – for and \"Arbitration\" (# 106–107) – for requests.\n\nIn 2015, , a professor at University of Tartu, in an interview opined that articles related to humanities in the Russian Wikipedia are of considerably inferior quality compared to English Wikipedia, and some articles even deteriorate with time. He suggested that this effect is due to overzealous policing of intellectual property rights by the community and bemoaned poor editing skills of some Wikipedians.\n\nThe Russian Wikipedia was created on 20 May 2001 in the first wave of non-English Wikipedias, along with editions in Catalan, Chinese, Dutch, German, Esperanto, French, Hebrew, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese, Spanish, and Swedish.\n\nThe first edit of the Russian Wikipedia was on 24 May 2001, and consisted of the line (\"\"Russia is a great nation\"\"). The following edit changed it to the joke: (\"\"Russia is the motherland of elephants (big-eared, improved cross-country capability, see Mammoth.\"\")\n\nFor a long time development was slow (especially after some participants left for WikiZnanie), but in the 12-month period between February 2005 and February 2006 it surpassed nine editions in other languages – the Catalan, Bulgarian, Ukrainian, Hebrew, Finnish, Norwegian, Chinese, Esperanto and Danish Wikipedias.\nIn 2006, 2007, 2009 and 2010 the Russian Wikipedia won the \"Science and education\" category of the \"Runet Prize\" () award, supervised by the Russian government agency FAPMC.\n\nOn 10 July 2012 Russian Wikipedia closed access to its content for 24 hours in protest against proposed amendments to Russia's Information Act (Bill No. 89417-6) regulating the accessibility of Internet-based information to children. Among other things, the bill stipulates the creation and country-wide enforcement of blacklists, which would block access to forbidden sites. Several aspects of this amendment drew criticism from various civil rights activists and Internet providers. In particular, the blacklist inclusion criteria were characterized as \"too vague\" and \"paving the way for Internet censorship\".\n\nSupporters of the amendment stated that it is aimed only at widely prohibited content such as child pornography and similar information, but the Russian has declared that conditions for determining the content falling under this law will create a thing like the \"great Chinese firewall\". They further claimed that existing Russian legal practice demonstrates a high likelihood of a worst-case scenario, resulting in a country-wide ban of Wikipedia. The second and the third readings of the law were held in the State Duma on 11 July; no essential corrections were introduced. The law will come into force after three readings in the State Duma, one reading in the Federation Council and presidential approval.\n\nOn 10 July, Nikolai Nikiforov, Russian Minister for Telecommunications and Mass Media announced in his Twitter account, that the organization of the List of the prohibited websites (that was sited on the Law Project No. 89417-6) will be suspended until 1 November 2012. On the same day Yelena Mizulina, a Duma deputy and the head of the subcommittee which sponsored the law, said that the blackout is an attempt to blackmail the Duma and was sponsored by the \"pedophile lobby\".\n\nAlso, since 2012, Russian foreign agent law resulted in reduced funding available for the Russian Wikipedia and its volunteers, who no longer can receive financial aid from abroad, including their share of funds raised through global Wikipedia fundraisers.\n\nOn 5 April 2013, it was confirmed by a spokesperson for the Federal Service for Supervision of Communications, Information Technology and Mass Media that Wikipedia had been blacklisted over the article \"\" (\"Cannabis smoking\") on Russian Wikipedia. On 31 March 2013, \"The New York Times\" reported that Russia was 'Selectively Blocking [the] Internet', though Wikipedia itself was not blocked at that time.\n\nArticles on Russian Wikipedia, and also on other Wikipedia versions, concerning the flight MH17 down-shoot and the 2014 Ukraine conflict have been targeted by Internet propaganda outlets associated with the Russian government. Some of the edits were spotted by a Twitter bot which monitors Wikipedia edits made from Russian government IP addresses.\n\nThe entire Russian Wikipedia was blocked in the Russian Federation for a few hours in August 2015 due to the contents of the article on charas.\n\nIn November 2019, Russian president Vladimir Putin called for a government-run alternative to Wikipedia. \"The Guardian\" reported state funds had already been allocated according to official documents published the previous September. The new electronic alternative was intended to be based on the \"Great Russian Encyclopedia\". According to the London \"Times\", the proposal had been abandoned by mid-May 2020, however, according to \"Great Russian Encyclopedia\" employee Yekaterina Chukovskaya, only the working group was disbanded and work on the project as a whole will continue.\n\n"}

He came into public spotlight during the 1990s and wars in Croatia (Croatian war of Independence and Bosnia-Herzegovina) as commander of the 66th Engineering Regiment of the Croatian Army. His unit built mountain roads on the border between the two countries, which ultimately allowed Croatian Army to outflank the Serb Krajina and Bosnian Serb forces during and after Operation Storm in August 1995. For his exploits, Ćesić was promoted to the rank of general.\n\nHis critics often point out the fact that before the war, he was a bus driver, becoming the official driver of Croatia's defence minister Gojko Šušak in 1991, after which he was given military command despite lack of formal qualification.\n\nHis post-war activities included the use of his unit for civilian contracts and the alleged breach of labour and other laws did not prevent Ćesić from rising through the ranks of the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) political party.\n\nIn the early 2000s, while a member of Croatian Parliament, Ćesić gradually began distancing himself from Ivo Sanader and the new centrist course of HDZ. He nevertheless formally remained in the party, while keeping himself in public spotlight with a series of statements that were as colorful as they were controversial. One example was his public offer to George W. Bush to volunteer in the 2003 invasion of Iraq. One of his controversial public episodes was an altercation and alleged physical attack on a fellow parliament member Dino Debeljuh in 2001, which resulted in Ljubo Ćesić's removal from that day's parliament session.\n\nIn the 2005 presidential election he ran as an independent candidate. During the campaign he claimed to be in contact with the renegade general Ante Gotovina. A subsequent police inquiry into that statement was ultimately inconsequential. Ćesić eventually finished 6th in the first round with 1.85% of the votes cast. Ćesić has since left HDZ and is currently a member of Only Croatia – Movement for Croatia.\n\nAfter his political career he started appearing in numerous comedy shows on Croatian television such as Robert Knjaz's \"Mjenjačnica\", in which two or more celebrities exchange lives with each other for a brief period of time. In the episode where he appeared, his companion was Croatia's most famous and controversial stylist Neven Ciganović.\n\n"}
{"id": "2036531", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2036531", "title": "Division 1 Féminine", "text": "Division 1 Féminine\n\nThe Championnat de France de Football Féminin, primarily referred to as the Division 1 Féminine and shortened as D1F, is the highest division of women's football in France. The league is the female equivalent to the men's Ligue 1 and is contested by 12 clubs. Seasons run from September to June, with teams playing 22 games each totaling 132 games in the season. Most games are played on Saturdays and Sundays, with a few games played during weekday evenings. Play is regularly suspended after the second week in December before returning in the third week of January. The Division 1 Féminine is ranked the best women's league in Europe according to UEFA 2018-2019 women’s association club coefficients.\n\nThe Division 1 Féminine was originally created in 1918 and managed by the \"Fédération des Sociétés Féminines Sportives de France\" (FSFSF), a women's football organization in France that was led by women's football pioneer Alice Milliat. The league lasted for twelve seasons before disbanding due to the prohibition of women's football. In 1975, women's football was officially re-instated and the Division 1 Féminine returned with funding from the French Football Federation. Female football players in France began signing professional contracts with their clubs beginning with the 2009–10 season, the most notable of which is Olympique Lyonnais. Contracts were previously semi-professional. The defending champions are Olympique Lyonnais who are also the most successful club in the history of the league.\n\nThere are 12 clubs in the Division 1 Féminine. During the course of a season, usually from September to June, each club plays the others twice, once at their home stadium and once at that of their opponents, for a total of 22 games, though clubs are allowed to host \"big\" matches at the home venues of their male counterparts, such as when Paris Saint-Germain hosted Juvisy at the Parc des Princes during the 2009–10 season. The female leagues are run similarly to the men's amateur leagues in France with teams receiving four points for a win and two points for a draw. One point is awarded for a loss. Teams are ranked by total points, then goal difference, and then goals scored. At the end of each season, the club with the most points is crowned champion. If points are equal, the goal difference and then goals scored determine the winner. If still equal, teams are deemed to occupy the same position. If there is a tie for the championship, for relegation, or for qualification to other competitions, a play-off match at a neutral venue decides rank. The two lowest placed teams are relegated to the Division 2 Féminine and the winners of the two groups in D2 Féminine are promoted in their place.\n\nBetween the years 2001–2004, the league adopted a playoff system. The top four clubs in the league table were inserted into a playoff table following the completion of the season with the winner being crowned champions. From 1974–1992, the league consisted of several groups with the winners of each group entering a playoff phase to determine the champion.\n\nCurrently, as determined by the UEFA women's coefficient, the top two teams in the Division 1 Féminine qualify for the UEFA Women's Champions League. As of today, the winner of the Challenge de France, the female equivalent of the Coupe de France, does not qualify for European competition.\n\nThe following 12 clubs compete in the Division 1 Féminine during the 2019-20 season.\n\nIncluded in the table below is a list of the top scorers of each season, starting from the 2001–02 season. Information for previous seasons unavailable.\nIn addition to the winner's trophy and the individual winner's medal players receive, the National Union of Professional Footballers (UNFP) awards the UNFP Female Player of the Year award to the top female player of the league. The current winner of the award is German international and Lyon midfielder Dzsenifer Marozsán. Following the 2009–10 season, the French Football Federation, who oversee the league, also began awarding a Player of the Year trophy. The jury panel who decided the winner consists of the twelve managers in the D1 Féminine.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2036554", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2036554", "title": "Design for X", "text": "Design for X\n\nDesign for Excellence or Design For Excellence (DfX or DFX), are terms and expansions used interchangeably in the existing literature, where the \"X\" in \"design for X\" is a variable which can have one of many possible values. In many fields (e.g., very-large-scale integration (VLSI) and nanoelectronics) \"X\" may represent several traits or features including: manufacturability, power, variability, cost, yield, or reliability. This gives rise to the terms design for manufacturability (DfM, DFM), design for inspection (DFI), design for variability (DfV), design for cost (DfC). Similarly, other disciplines may associate other traits, attributes, or objectives for \"X\".\n\nUnder the label \"design for X\", a wide set of specific design guidelines are summarized. Each design guideline addresses a given issue that is caused by, or affects the traits of, a product. The design guidelines usually propose an approach and corresponding methods that may help to generate and apply technical knowledge to control, improve, or even invent particular traits of a product. From a knowledge-based view, the design guideline represents an explicit form of knowledge, that contains information about \"knowing-how-to\" (see Procedural knowledge). However, two problems are prevalent. First, this explicit knowledge (i.e., the design guidelines) were transformed from a tacit form of knowledge (i.e., by experienced engineers, or other specialists). Thus, it is not granted that a freshman or someone who is outside the subject area will comprehend this generated explicit knowledge. This is because it still contains embedded fractions of knowledge or respectively include non-obvious assumptions, also called context-dependency (see e.g. Doz and Santos, 1997:16–18). Second, the traits of a product are likely to exceed the knowledge base of one human. There exists a wide range of specialized fields of engineering, and considering the whole life cycle of a product will require non-engineering expertise. For this purpose, examples of design guidelines are listed in the following.\n\nDfX methodologies address different issues that may occur in one or more phase of a product life cycle:\nEach phase is explained with two dichotomous categories of tangible products to show differences in prioritizing design issues in certain product life cycle phases:\n\nNon-durables that are consumed physically when used, e.g. chocolate or lubricants, are not discussed. There also exist a wide range of other classifications because products are either a) goods b) service or c) both (see OECD and Eurostat, 2005:48). Thus, one can also refer to whole product, augmented product, or extended product. Also the business unit strategy of a firm are ignored, even though it significantly influences priority-setting in design.\n\n\n\nDesign to cost and design to standards serves cost reduction in production operations, or respectively supply chain operations. Except for luxury goods or brands (e.g., Swarovski crystals, Haute couture fashion, etc.), most goods, even exclusive products, rely on cost reduction, if these are mass produced. The same is valid for the functional production strategy of mass customization. Through engineering design physical interfaces between a) parts or components or assemblies of the product and b) the manufacturing equipment and the logistical material flow systems can be changed, and thus cost reducing effects in operating the latter may be achieved.\n\n\n\nUser focused design guidelines may be associated with consumer durables, and after-sales focused design guidelines may be more important for capital goods. However, in case of capital goods design for ergonomics is needed to ensure clarity, simplicity, and safety between the human-machine interface. The intent is to avoid shop-accidents as well as to ensure efficient work flows. Also design for aesthetics has become more and more important for capital goods in recent years. In business-to-business (B2B) markets, capital goods are usually ordered, or respectively business transaction are initiated, at industrial trade fairs. The functional traits of capital goods in technical terms are assumed generally as fulfilled across all exhibiting competitors. Therefore, a purchaser may be subliminally influenced by the aesthetics of a capital good when it comes to a purchasing decision. For consumer durables the aspect of after sales highly depends on the business unit's strategy in terms of service offerings, therefore generally statements are not possible to formulate.\n\n\nSeveral other concepts in product development and new product development are very closely related:\n\nLooking at all life stages of a product (Product life cycle (engineering)) is essential for design for X, otherwise the \"X\" may be suboptimized, or make no sense. When asking what competencies are required for analysing situations that may occur along the life of a product, it becomes clear that several departmental functions are required. An historical assumption is that new product development is conducted in a departmental-stage process (that can be traced back to the classical theory of the firm, e.g. Max Weber's bureaucracy or Henri Fayol's administration principles), i.e., new product development activities are closely associated with certain department of a firm. At the start of the 1990s, the concept of concurrent engineering gained popularity to overcome dysfunctions of departmental stage processes. Concurrent engineering postulates that several departments must work closely together for certain new product development activities (see Clark and Fujimoto, 1991). The logical consequence was the emergence of the organisational mechanism of cross-functional teams. For example, Filippini et al. (2005) found evidence that overlapping product development processes only accelerate new product development projects if these are executed by a cross-functional team, vice versa.\n\nDesign for X references \n\nAuxiliary references\n\n"}

The county also included seven Parliamentary Boroughs, namely Aldeburgh, Bury St Edmunds, Dunwich, Eye, Ipswich, Orford and Sudbury, all returning 2 MPs each.\n\nThe Great Reform Act of 1832 radically changed the representation of the House of Commons, with the County being divided into the Eastern and Western Divisions, both returning 2 MPs. The Boroughs of Aldeburgh, Dunwich and Orford were abolished and Eye's representation was reduced to 1 MP.\n\nThe Borough of Sudbury was disenfranchised for corruption in 1844 and absorbed into the Western Division.\n\nUnder the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885, the two 2-member county divisions were replaced by five single-member constituencies, namely the Northern or Lowestoft Division, the North-Eastern or Eye Division (which absorbed the abolished Parliamentary Borough of Eye), the North-Western or Stowmarket Division, the South-Eastern or Woodbridge Division and the Southern or Sudbury Division. The representation of the Borough of Bury St Edmunds was reduced to 1 MP and Ipswich continued to elect 2 MPs.\n\nThe table shows an approximate representation of the development of constituencies in Suffolk since 1885. The text below gives a more detailed description.\nUnder the Representation of the People Act 1918, the Parliamentary Borough of Bury St Edmunds was abolished and reconstituted as a County Division, absorbing the abolished Stowmarket Division, with the exception of small south-eastern area, including Stowmarket itself, which was transferred to Eye. The southern-most part of Lowestoft, including Halesworth, was also transferred to Eye. The representation of the Borough of Ipswich was reduced to 1 MP, with boundaries expanding into Woodbridge to align with those of the County Borough of Ipswich.\n\nThe Representation of the People Act 1948 resulted in the abolition of the Sudbury and Woodbridge Divisions. They were replaced by the new county constituency of Sudbury and Woodbridge, incorporating the towns of Sudbury and Hadleigh from Sudbury, and Woodbridge and Felixstowe from Woodbridge. Western and northern parts of Sudbury, including Haverhill, were transferred to Bury St Edmunds and northern parts of Woodbridge were transferred to Eye. Halesworth was returned from Eye to Lowestoft.\n\nThere were no changes under the First or Second Periodic Reviews of Westminster Constituencies.\n\nThe Third Review, which reflected the changes to local authorities arising from the Local Government Act 1972, did not come into effect until the 1983 general election, when Suffolk's representation was increased back up to 6 MPs. This resulted in major changes to the configuration of the county's seats as follows:\n\n\nThe Fourth Review resulted in further major changes with the addition of a seventh constituency, named West Suffolk. This was formed from the majority of the existing Bury St Edmunds constituency, including Newmarket and Mildenhall. It also included Haverhill and surrounding areas, transferred from South Suffolk. Bury St Edmunds was reconfigured, taking western parts of Central Suffolk, including Stowmarket. Central Suffolk (renamed Central Suffolk and North Ipswich), in turn, gained western-most parts of Suffolk Coastal, which then gained southern-most parts of Waveney, including Halesworth and Southwold.\nIn the Fifth Review the Boundary Commission for England recommended that Suffolk retained its current constituencies, with changes only to reflect revisions to local authority ward boundaries. The largest of these changes resulted in the effective transfer of one Borough of Ipswich ward from Central Suffolk and North Ipswich to the constituency of Ipswich.\n\nThe Boundary Commission for England submitted their final proposals in respect of the Sixth Periodic Review of Westminster Constituencies (the 2018 review) in September 2018. Although the proposals were immediately laid before Parliament they were not brought forward by the Government for approval. Accordingly, they did not come into effect for the 2019 election which took place on 12 December 2019, and which was contested using the constituency boundaries in place since 2010.\n\nUnder the terms of the Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Act 2011, the Sixth Review was based on reducing the total number of MPs from 650 to 600 and a strict electoral parity requirement that the electorate of all constituencies should be within a range of 5% either side of the electoral quota.\n\nOn 24 March 2020, the Minister of State for the Cabinet Office, Chloe Smith, issued a written statement to Parliament setting out the Government's thinking with regard to parliamentary boundaries. They propose to bring forward primary legislation to remove the statutory obligation to implement the 2018 Boundary Review recommendations, as well as set the framework for future boundary reviews in time for the next review which is due to begin in early 2021 and report no later than October 2023. It is proposed that the number of constituencies now remains at the current level of 650, rather than being reduced to 600, while retaining the requirement that the electorate should be no more than +/- 5% from the electoral quota.\n\n\"Primary data source:\" House of Commons research briefing - General election results from 1918 to 2019\n\nThe number of votes cast for each political party who fielded candidates in constituencies comprising Suffolk in the 2019 general election were as follows:\n\nIncludes National Liberal Party up to 1966\n\n1950-1979 - Liberal; 1983 & 1987 - SDP-Liberal Alliance\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> Included in Other\n\nIncludes National Liberal Party up to 1966\n\n1950-1979 - Liberal; 1983 & 1987 - SDP-Liberal Alliance\n\nA cell marked → (with a different colour background to the preceding cell) indicates that the previous MP continued to sit under a new party name.\n\n"}
{"id": "2036596", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2036596", "title": "Paul Menard", "text": "Paul Menard\n\nJohn Paul Menard (born August 21, 1980) is an American former professional stock car racing driver. He last competed full-time in the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series in the No. 21 Ford Mustang for Wood Brothers Racing, retiring from regular competition after the 2019 season. He also raced part-time in the NASCAR Xfinity Series, driving the No. 12 Mustang for Team Penske. He is the son of home improvement entrepreneur John Menard Jr., founder of the Menards chain.\n\nMenard's racing career began at the age of eight when he won the Briggs Junior Karting Class Championship in his native Eau Claire, Wisconsin. He later won the Briggs Medium Class Champion before working his way up to higher level racing. He began ice racing at the age of 15 and won 10 International Ice Racing Association events in his career. He continues to compete in IIRA events in and around Wisconsin. In the summers he raced legends cars on short tracks in Wisconsin. He borrowed Bryan Reffner's Late Model for a week winning his heat race and placing around fourth in the feature. He decided to build his own late model and raced the car three to four times per week. In an interview with Motorsports Minute, Menard said he chose stock cars over Indy Cars because there was no feeder series for Indy Car in his native Wisconsin.\n\nIn 2000, he began racing a limited schedule in the NASCAR Re/Max Challenge Series, finishing 13th in points. During his rookie season in 2001, he earned a pole and victory at Road America in Elkhart Lake, Wisconsin, finishing ninth in points. The 2002 season saw Menard compete in ReMax Challenge (two poles, seventh in points), SCCA Trans-Am (one front-row start, four top-10 finishes), Grand Am Cup (victories at Fontana and Phoenix) and the NASCAR Southwest Tour. He capped his season in the latter series with a last-lap pass of veteran Ken Schrader for the Phoenix victory.\n\nIn 2003, Menard joined Andy Petree Racing to compete in NASCAR Winston Cup, Busch and Craftsman Truck Series events while still competing in ARCA. In his first ARCA start at Salem Speedway, he qualified second and finished fourth. Later that year, he started on the pole at Winchester, Indiana, and then scored his first ARCA victory at Talladega Superspeedway. He also had top finishes of ninth in the Busch race at Indianapolis Raceway Park and eighth in the Truck race at the Kansas Speedway.\n\nIn 2004, Menard began the NASCAR Busch Series season driving the No. 33 Chevrolet. Midway through the season, he moved to Dale Earnhardt, Inc. in the No. 11 Chevy. 10 races later, Menard won his first career pole position at Kansas Speedway and finished 23rd in points despite no top-tens and missing seven races. With Dan Stillman as crew chief beginning in 2005, they started out by leading 57 laps at Daytona. Winning the Bud Pole Award at Talladega also had them running up front until getting caught up in a wreck. He got his first top-10 and top-five by placing fifth at the Kentucky Speedway. From there, the team went from 20th to the top-10 in points before finishing in sixth place overall, for the season.\n\nIn 2006, driving the No. 15 car part-time for DEI, Menard scored his first top-10 finish in the NASCAR Nextel Cup Series by coming in seventh place at the Golden Corral 500 at Atlanta Motor Speedway. Menard also won his first Busch Series race on June 24 at his home track of the Milwaukee Mile by holding off a late race charge and bump from Cup regular Kevin Harvick. Harvick eventually caused a multi-car wreck attempting to bump him out of the way. Menard finished off 2006 with a sixth-place finish in the standings, tying his best finish in the standings last year (2005). He scored 16 top-10 finishes and 7 top-5 finishes in the Busch Series.\n\nIn 2007, Menard ran his first full-time Cup season. He failed to qualify for six races that season, but after DEI's merger with Ginn Racing, the owner's points were transferred from Sterling Marlin's No. 14 car to Menard, who was then locked into the rest of the races. His best finish of 2007 was in the Citizens Bank 400 where he finished 12th. In the Busch Series, he picked up 5 top-5 finishes. After the fall race at Charlotte, in which Menard and Tony Stewart made contact on pit road, a feud between the drivers ensued; Stewart had driven for John Menard in the Indy Racing League's early years.\n\nIn 2008, Menard won his first Sprint Cup Series pole at Daytona International Speedway in early July and remained in the top 35 in owner's points for the entire season. At Talladega in the fall, Menard had the best run of his career leading laps and coming home with a strong second-place finish. He also was up front for a good part of the day in the other. He finished up the season with $3,559,130 in earnings and finished 26th in points standings, a career high.\n\nFor the 2009 season, Menard moved over to the No. 98 Ford Fusion operated by Yates Racing. Menard showed limited improvement in 2009, running in the top 10 many times, only to later have problems. For example, he crashed at Las Vegas Motor Speedway while running very well, and was involved in a wreck with only 40 laps to go, while running 7th. These issues lead to the team being in danger of falling out of the top 35 in points standings for much of the year. Menard's best finishes included two 13th-place finishes in the Aarons 499 at Talladega Superspeedway as well as the Samsung 500 at Texas Motor Speedway, and a 15th-place finish in the Southern 500. At the second Dover race, Menard started 10th and ran in the top 10 for most of the day, only to find his car tighten up near the end of the race and come home 19th. At the end of the 2009 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series, Menard was the only driver to not score a top 10 finish who ran all of the races. Menard ended up finishing 31st in the final point standings.\n\nFor the 2010 season, his No. 98 team moved over to Richard Petty Motorsports, due to its merger with Yates Racing. In his first start with RPM he finished 13th in the 2010 Daytona 500. He then went on to have Top 20s at Las Vegas and Fontana. The following race at Atlanta Motor Speedway Menard posted his second highest career Cup series finish with a fifth place showing followed by a few more top 20s. After that, he fell from the Top 12 in points. At Charlotte, he finished eighth after running in the top 10 all race long. Menard also posted another top 10 in the circuit's 19th race at Chicagoland Speedway. At Dover International Speedway in September he ended up with a 7th-place finish. The following week he started from the second position at Kansas. While most publications rated him around 30th in the 2010 preseason, he finished 23rd in points.\n\nIn early 2010, Menard drove in the No. 90 Daytona Prototype for Spirit of Daytona Racing in the Rolex 24 hours at Daytona International Speedway. In 2010 he came close to winning the Nationwide Series race at Road America in his hometown of Wisconsin. Menard was running 7th when he was spun out on the final lap by road course specialist Tony Ave. It appeared that Menard was to blame, but footage captured by a fan showed that Owen Kelly was at fault.\n\nMenard moved to Richard Childress Racing in 2011, driving the No. 27. On July 31, 2011, Menard won his first Sprint Cup race in his 167th start, in the Brickyard 400 at the prestigious Indianapolis Motor Speedway. He did so by making his last pit stop with 36 laps to go. He led late, but with 9 laps to go, he was passed by Jamie McMurray. With four to go, he regained the lead and held off Jeff Gordon, the winner of the inaugural Brickyard 400 in the final laps, having enough fuel to do so. He is the first member of the Menard family to win at Indianapolis, in any event, held at the track. He also joins Trevor Bayne, Regan Smith, David Ragan, and Marcos Ambrose as first-time winners in the 2011 season.\n\nIn September 2011 at Richmond, Menard and RCR became the center of controversy when Menard spun in the waning laps. It was believed that his accident was intentional, intended to assist his teammate Kevin Harvick who later won the race against Jeff Gordon who would have won if the caution did not come out.\n\nIn 2012, Menard did not perform well. He crashed during the Aaron's 499 at Talladega and went winless for 2012. In 2013, he slightly improved when he was briefly in Chase for the Sprint Cup contention. A blown engine early in the Coke Zero 400 caused him to be knocked out of the Chase with a few races left before the Chase began. In the season-ending Ford EcoBoost 400, Menard's tire exploded upon stopping in his pit box; Menard stated, \"About a lap later, they told me I was on fire. I lost my brakes, and the damned wheel blew right off.\"\n\nMenard won the Nationwide race at Michigan for his first NNS win since 2006 in June 2014. He won after Joey Logano blew a tire with 4 laps to go.\n\nIn the 2015 Sprint Unlimited at Daytona, Menard won the pole for the race by drawing. He led the first 7 laps until he was involved in a big wreck, finishing 21st. The race was later won by Matt Kenseth. Menard later finished in the top 5 in Auto Club and in Talladega and got 5 top 10s and 22 top 15s. He made the Chase for the first time in his career mostly because he had only one DNF (a blown engine in Texas), grabbing the final spot by 17 points over Aric Almirola. He was eliminated in the first round, but with Matt Kenseth's two-race suspension, Menard passed him and finished in a career-best of 14th in the standings. Also in August 2015, Menard took the checkers at Road America, holding off Blake Koch and Ryan Blaney for his third Xfinity Series win. Aside from the 2011 Brickyard 400, the win was Menard's biggest of his career, as Menard had grown up a few miles from the track.\n\nIn the 2016 Sprint Unlimited, Menard finished in a career best 3rd place, after surviving several big ones.\n\nTo start of 2017, Menard survived wrecks in the Daytona 500 and brought home a 5th place finish after a few cars ran out of gas. The next week at Atlanta, he finished 25th. Menard scored his 2nd top 10 of the year in the GEICO 500 at Talladega, finishing 9th. In the Coke Zero 400, Menard ran up front late and came home 3rd, barely behind Ricky Stenhouse Jr. and Clint Bowyer. Menard survived most of the carnage in the Brickyard 400 but crashed in a late big one.\n\nOn July 26, 2017, Menard was announced as the replacement for Ryan Blaney in the No. 21 Wood Brothers Racing Ford starting in 2018.\nOn June 30, 2018, almost 10 years to the day, Menard got his second ever Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series Pole Award at Chicagoland Speedway for the Overton's 400.\n\nOn July 12, 2019, Menard announced he had a contract for the 2020 season, indicating that he plans to stay with Wood Brothers. On September 10, 2019, Menard announced his retirement from full-time racing after the 2019 season.\n\nA native of Eau Claire, Wisconsin, Menard is the son of Menards founder John Menard Jr. He attended the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire, majoring in business. He currently resides in the Charlotte, North Carolina, area with his wife Jennifer. The couple had their first child, a daughter, on March 18, 2014. The family later welcomed another child, a son, in November 2017.\n\n Season still in progress<br>\n\n"}

It was created on 16 March 2001, just a few minutes after the first non-English Wikipedia, the German edition. With more than articles, it is currently the -largest Wikipedia as measured by the number of articles, and the fifth-largest Wikipedia in a Romance language. In April 2016, the project had 582 active editors who made at least five edits in that month. The edition is most notable for its large number of quality articles, which illustrates the Catalan language's important online presence despite being a minority language.\n\nOn March 16, 2001, Jimmy Wales announced that he wanted to create Wikipedias in other languages and mentioned that there was interest in creating a Catalan version. The first tests were made on the deutsche.wikipedia.com, and a few minutes later, the Catalan Wikipedia was created in the catalan.wikipedia.com domain.\n\nThe first edit on a non-English Wikipedia was at 21:07 UTC, March 16, 2001, made to the Catalan Main Page. The first contribution in a non-English article dates from March 17 at 01:41 UTC in the article \"\". Despite being created after the German Wikipedia, for about two months it was the only non-English Wikipedia that contained articles.\n\nAfter some time, the domain changed to \"ca.wikipedia.com\" and later to \"ca.wikipedia.org\". About 2003 its community started to use the name \"Viquipèdia\" when talking about this edition of Wikipedia. Nowadays, this word is used in Catalan language to refer to the whole Wikipedia. About 2005, the domain \"www.viquipedia.net\" was registered and it redirects to \"ca.wikipedia.org\". In 2007, \"www.viquipedia.cat\" was also registered and redirected.\n\nThe first registered user was probably \"AstroNomer\", presumably used only to make some registration tests, but the first registered user to make lasting contributions was Cdani, the same user cited in Jimbo Wales' message.\n\nIn 2005 the Catalan Wikipedia community debated on which name(s) of the Catalan language to present in the main page and other policy pages, either \"català\", \"Catalan\", \"valencià\", \"Valencian\", or a combination of both \"català-valencià\" and \"català o valencià\". Although there was not a consensus on any of the proposals, users agreed that in articles relevant to the Valencian Community, the name \"Valencian\" was to be used; on all other articles \"Catalan\" is preferred. The main page avoids making reference to a particular nomenclature, by simply stating \"aquesta versió\", \"this version\".\n\nIn 2019 the Catalan Wikipedia has 76 thousand unique categories. The average article in this language version has 4 categories, while number of unique categories per articles ratio is 0.124. The largest number of articles has society (16%) and geography (15%) category. On Catalan Wikipedia, articles related to events and military have the highest average quality.

{"id": "2036621", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2036621", "title": "Zinaida Gippius", "text": "Zinaida Gippius\n\nZinaida Nikolayevna Gippius (Hippius) (; – 9 September 1945) was a Russian poet, playwright, novelist, editor and religious thinker, one of the major figures in Russian symbolism. The story of her marriage to Dmitry Merezhkovsky, which lasted 52 years, is described in her unfinished book \"Dmitry Merezhkovsky\" (Paris, 1951; Moscow, 1991).\n\nShe began writing at an early age, and by the time she met Dmitry Merezhkovsky in 1888, she was already a published poet. The two were married in 1889. Gippius published her first book of poetry, \"Collection of Poems. 1889–1903\", in 1903, and her second collection, \"Collection of Poems. Book 2. 1903-1909\", in 1910. After the 1905 Revolution, the Merezhkovskys became critics of Tsarism; they spent several years abroad during this time, including trips for treatment of health issues. They denounced the 1917 October Revolution, seeing it as a cultural disaster, and in 1919 emigrated to Poland.\n\nAfter living in Poland they moved to France, and then to Italy, continuing to publish and take part in Russian émigré circles, though Gippius's harsh literary criticism made enemies. The tragedy of the exiled Russian writer was a major topic for Gippius in emigration, but she also continued to explore mystical and covertly sexual themes, publishing short stories, plays, novels, poetry, and memoirs. The death of Merezhkovsky in 1941 was a major blow to Gippius, who died a few years later in 1945.\n\nZinaida Gippius was born on , in Belyov, Tula, the eldest of four sisters. Her father, Nikolai Romanovich Gippius, a respected lawyer and a senior officer in the Russian Senate, was a German-Russian, whose ancestor Adolphus von Gingst, later von Hippius, came to settle in Moscow in the 16th century. Her mother, Anastasia Vasilyevna ( Stepanova), was a daughter of the Yekaterinburg Chief of Police.\n\nNikolai Gippius's job entailed constant traveling, and because of this his daughters received little formal education. Taking lessons from governesses and visiting tutors, they attended schools sporadically in whatever city (Saratov, Tula and Kiev, among others) the family happened to stay for a significant period of time. At the age of 48 Nikolai Gippius died of tuberculosis, and Anastasia Vasilyevna, knowing that all of her girls had inherited a predisposition to the illness that killed him, moved the family southwards, first to Yalta (where Zinaida had medical treatment) then in 1885 to Tiflis, closer to their uncle Alexander Stepanov's home.\n\nBy this time, Zinaida had already studied for two years at a girls' school in Kiev (1877—1878) and for a year at the Moscow Fischer Gymnasium. It was only in Borzhomi where her uncle Alexander, a man of considerable means, rented a dacha for her, that she started to get back to normal after the profound shock caused by her beloved father's death.\n\nZinaida started writing poetry at the age of seven. By the time she met Dmitry Merezhkovsky in 1888, she was already a published poet. \"By the year 1880 I was writing verses, being a great believer in 'inspiration', and making it a point never to take my pen away from paper. People around me saw these poems as a sign of my being 'spoiled', but I never tried to conceal them and, of course, I wasn't spoiled at all, what with my religious upbringing,\" she wrote in 1902 in a letter to Valery Bryusov. A good-looking girl, Zinaida attracted a lot of attention in Borzhomi, but Merezhkovsky, a well-educated introvert, impressed her first and foremost as a perfect kindred spirit. Once he proposed, she accepted him without hesitation, and never came to regret what might have seemed a hasty decision.\n\nGippius and Merezhkovsky were married on 8 January 1889, in Tiflis. They had a short honeymoon tour involving a stay in the Crimea, then returned to Saint Petersburg and moved into a flat in the Muruzi House, which Merezhkovsky's mother had rented and furnished for them as a wedding gift.\n\nMerezhkovsky and Gippius made a pact, each promising to concentrate on what he or she did best, the former on poetry, the latter on prose. The agreement collapsed as Zinaida translated Lord Byron's \"Manfred\", and Dimitry started working on his debut novel \"Julian the Apostate\". In Saint Petersburg Gippius joined the Russian Literary Society, became a member of the Shakespearean Circle (the celebrity lawyer Prince Alexander Urusov being its most famous member), and met and befriended Yakov Polonsky, Apollon Maykov, Dmitry Grigorovich, Aleksey Pleshcheyev and Pyotr Veinberg. She became close to the group of authors associated with the renovated \"Severny Vestnik\", where she herself made her major debut as a poet in 1888.\n\nIn 1890–91 this magazine published her first short stories, \"The Ill-Fated One\" and \"In Moscow\". Then three of her novels, \"Without the Talisman\", \"The Winner\", and \"Small Waves\", appeared in \"Mir Bozhy\". Seeing the writing of mediocre, generic prose as a commercial enterprise, Gippius treated her poetry differently, as something utterly intimate, calling her verses 'personal prayers'. Dealing with the darker side of the human soul and exploring sexual ambiguity and narcissism, many of those 'prayers' were considered blasphemous at the time. Detractors called Gippius a 'demoness', the 'queen of duality', and a 'decadent Madonna'. Enjoying the notoriety, she exploited her androgynous image, used male clothes and pseudonyms, shocked her guests with insults ('to watch their reaction', as she once explained to Nadezhda Teffi), and for a decade remained the Russian symbol of 'sexual liberation', holding high what she in one of her diary entries termed as the 'cross of sensuality'. In 1901 all this transformed into the ideology of the \"New Church\" of which she was the instigator.\n\nIn October 1903 the \"Collection of Poems. 1889–1903\", Gippius's first book of poetry, came out; Innokenty Annensky later called the book the \"quintessence of fifteen years of Russian modernism.\" Valery Bryusov was greatly impressed too, praising the \"insurmountable frankness with which she document[ed] the emotional progress of her enslaved soul.\" Gippius herself never thought much of the social significance of her published poetry. In a foreword to her debut collection she wrote: \"It is sad to realize that one had to produce something as useless and meaningless as this book. Not that I think poetry to be useless; on the contrary, I am convinced that it is essential, natural and timeless. There were times when poetry was read everywhere and appreciated by everybody. But those times are gone. A modern reader has no use for a book of poetry any more.\"\n\nIn the early 1900s the Muruzi House acquired the reputation of being one of the Russian capital's new cultural centers. Guests recognized and admired the hostess's authority and her talent for leadership, even if none of them found her particularly warm or affectionate.\n\nIn 1899—1901, encouraged by the group of authors associated with \"Mir Iskusstva\", the magazine she had become close to, Gippius published critical essays in it using male pseudonyms, Anton Krainy being the best known. Analyzing the roots of the crisis that Russian culture had fallen into, Gippius (somewhat paradoxically, given her 'demonic' reputation) suggested as a remedy the 'Christianization' of it, which in practice meant bringing the intelligentsia and the Church closer together. Merging faith and intellect, according to Gippius, was crucial for the survival of Russia; only religious ideas, she thought, would bring its people enlightenment and liberation, both sexual and spiritual.\n\nIn 1901 Gippius and Merezhkovsky co-founded the Religious and Philosophical Meetings. This 'gathering for free discussion', focusing on the synthesis of culture and religion, brought together an eclectic mix of intellectuals and was regarded in retrospect as an important, if short-lived attempt to pull Russia back from the major social upheavals it was headed for. Gippius was the driving force behind the Meetings, as well as the magazine \"Novy Put\" (1903–04), launched initially as a vehicle for the former. By the time \"Novy Put\" folded (due to a conflict caused by the newcomer Sergei Bulgakov's refusal to publish her essay on Alexander Blok), Gippius (as Anton Krainy) had become a prominent literary critic, contributing mostly to \"Vesy\" (Scales).\n\nAfter the Meetings were closed in 1903, Gippius tried to revive her initial idea in the form of what was regarded as her 'domestic Church', based on the controversial Troyebratstvo (Brotherhood of Three), composed of herself, Merezhkovsky, and Dmitry Filosofov, their mutual close friend and, for a short while, her lover. This new development outraged many of their friends, like Nikolai Berdyaev who saw this bizarre parody on the Trinity, with its own set of quasi-religious rituals, as profanation bordering on blasphemy.\n\nThe 1905 Revolution had a profound impact on Gippius. During the next decade the Merezhkovskys were harsh critics of Tsarism, radical revolutionaries like Boris Savinkov now entering their narrow circle of close friends. In February 1906 the couple left for France to spend more than two years in what they saw as self-imposed exile, trying to introduce Western intellectuals to their 'new religious consciousness'. In 1906 Gippius published the collection of short stories \"Scarlet Sword\" (Алый меч), and in 1908 the play \"Poppie Blossom\" (Маков цвет) came out, with Merezhkovsky and Filosofov credited as co-authors.\n\nDisappointed with the indifference of European cultural elites to their ideas, the trio returned home. Back in Saint Petersburg Gippius's health deteriorated, and for the next six years she (along with her husband, who had heart problems) regularly visited European health resorts and clinics. During one such voyage in 1911 Gippius bought a cheap apartment in Paris, at Rue Colonel Bonnet, 11-bis. What at the time felt like a casual, unnecessary purchase, later saved them from homelessness abroad.\n\nAs the political tension in Russia subsided, the Meetings were re-opened as the Religious and Philosophical Society, in 1908. But Russian Church leaders ignored it, and soon the project withered into a mere literary circle. The heated discussion over the \"Vekhi\" manifesto led to a clash between the Merezhkovskys and Filosofov on the one hand and Vasily Rozanov on the other; the latter quit and severed ties with his old friends.\n\nBy the time her \"Collection of Poems. Book 2. 1903-1909\" came out in 1910, Gippius has become a well-known (though by no means as famous as her husband) European author, translated into German and French. In 1912 her book of short stories \"Moon Ants\" (Лунные муравьи) came out, featuring the best prose she had written in years. The two novels, \"The Demon Dolls\" (Чортовы куклы, 1911) and \"Roman-Tsarevich\" (Роман-царевич, 1912), were meant to be the first and the third book of the Hieromonk Iliodor trilogy, which remained unfinished. The literary left panned them as allegedly 'anti-revolutionary', mainstream critics found these books lackluster, formulaic and tendentious.\n\nAt the outbreak of World War I, the Merezhkovskys spoke out against Russia's involvement. Still, Gippius launched a support-the-soldiers campaign of her own, producing a series of frontline-forwarded letters, each combining stylized folk poetic messages with small tobacco-packets, signed with either her own, or one of her three servant maids' names. Some dismissed it as pretentious and meaningless, others applauded what they saw as her reaction to the jingoistic hysteria of the time.\n\nThe Merezhkovskys greeted the 1917 February Revolution and denounced the October Revolution, blaming Alexander Kerensky and his Provisional government for the catastrophe. In her book of memoirs \"Dmitry Merezhkovsky. Him and Us\" Gippius wrote: \n\nGippius saw the October Revolution as the end of Russia and the coming of the Kingdom of Antichrist. \"It felt as if some pillow fell on you to strangle... Strangle what — the city? The country? No, something much, much bigger,\" — she wrote in her 26 October 1917, diary entry. In late 1917 Gippius was still able to publish her anti-Bolshevik verses in what remained of the old newspapers, but the next year was nightmarish, according to her \"Diaries\". Ridiculing H. G. Wells (\"I can see why he is so attracted to the Bolsheviks: they’ve leapfrogged him\"), she wrote of Cheka atrocities (\"In Kiev 1200 officers killed; legs severed, boots taken off.\" — 23 February. \"In Rostov teenager cadets shot down — for being mistakenly taken for Constitutional Democratic Party cadets, the banned ones.\" — 17 March), of mass hunger and her own growing feeling of dull indifference. \"Those who still have a soul in them walk around like corpses: neither protesting, nor suffering, waiting for nothing, bodies and souls slumped into hunger-induced dormancy.\"\n\nExpressing some sympathy for 'the weeping Lunacharsky' (the only Bolshevik leader to express at least some regret concerning the cruelties of the repressive organs), Gippius wrote: \"The things that happen now have nothing to do with Russian history. They will be forgotten, like the atrocities of some savages on a faraway island; will vanish without a trace.\" \"Last Poems (1914–1918)\", published in 1918, presented a stark and gloomy picture of revolutionary Russia as Gippius saw it. After the defeats of Alexander Kolchak in Siberia and Anton Denikin in Southern Russia, respectively, the Merezhkovskys moved to Petrograd. In late 1919, invited to join a group of 'red professors' in Crimea, Gippius chose not to, having heard of massacres orchestrated by local chiefs Bela Kun and Rosalia Zemlyachka. Having obtained permission to leave the city (the pretext being that they would head for the frontlines, with lectures on Ancient Egypt for Red Army fighters), Merezhkovsky and Gippius, as well as her secretary Vladimir Zlobin and Dmitry Filosofov, departed to Poland by train.\n\nTheir first destination was Minsk where Merezhkovsky and Gippius gave a series of lectures for Russian immigrants and published political pamphlets in the \"Minsk Courier\". During a stay of several months in Warsaw Gippius edited the \"Svoboda\" newspaper. Disillusioned with Jozef Pilsudski's policies, the Merezhkovskys and Zlobin left for France on 20 October without Filosofov, who chose to stay in the city with Boris Savinkov. In Paris Gippius concentrated on making appointments, sorting out mail, negotiating contracts and receiving guests. The Merezhkovsky's talks, as Nina Berberova remembered, always revolved around two major themes: Russia and freedom. Backing Merezhkovsky in his anti-Bolshevik crusade, she was deeply pessimistic as regards what her husband referred to as his 'mission'. \"Our slavery is so unheard of and our revelations are so outlandish that for a free man it is difficult to understand what we are talking about,\" she conceded.\n\nThe tragedy of the exiled Russian writer became a major topic for Gippius in emigration, but she also continued to explore mystical and covertly sexual themes. She remained a harsh literary critic and, by dismissing many of the well-known writers of the Symbolist and Acmeist camps, made herself an unpopular figure in France.\n\nIn the early 1920s several of Gippius's earlier works were re-issued in the West, including the collection of stories \"Heavenly Words\" (Небесные слова, 1921, Paris) and the \"Poems. 1911–1912 Diary\" (1922, Berlin). In Munich \"The Kingdom of Antichrist\" (Царство Антихриста), authored by Merezhkovsky, Gippius, Filosofov, and Zlobin, came out, including the first two parts of Gippius's \"Petersburg Diaries\" (Петербургские дневники). Gippius was the major force behind the \"Green Lamp\" (Зелёная лампа) society, named after the 19th century group associated with Alexander Pushkin. Fractional altercations aside, it proved to be the only cultural center where Russian émigré writers and philosophers (carefully chosen for each meeting and invited personally) could meet and discuss political and cultural topics.\n\nIn 1928 the Merezhkovskys took part in the First Congress of Russian writers in exile held in Belgrade. Encouraged by the success of Merezhkovsky's Da Vinci series of lectures and Benito Mussolini's benevolence, in 1933 the couple moved to Italy where they stayed for about three years, visiting Paris only occasionally. With the Socialist movement rising there and anti-Russian emigration feelings spurred by President Paul Doumer's murder in 1932, France felt like a hostile place to them. Living in exile was very hard for Gippius psychologically. As one biographer put it, \"her metaphysically grandiose personality, with its spiritual and intellectual overload, was out of place in what she herself saw as a 'soullessly pragmatic' period in European history.\"\n\nAs the outbreak of World War II in Europe rendered literature virtually irrelevant, Gippius, against all odds, compiled and published the \"Literature Tornado\", an ambitious literary project set up to provide a safe haven for writers rejected by publishers for ideological reasons. What in other times might have been hailed as a powerful act in support of the freedom of speech, in 1939 passed unnoticed. Merezhkovsky and Gippius spent their last year together in a social vacuum. Regardless of whether or not the 1944 text of Merezhkovsky's allegedly pro-Hitler \"Radio speech\" was indeed a prefabricated montage (as his biographer Zobnin asserted), there was little doubt that the couple, having become too close to (and financially dependent on) the Germans in Paris, had lost respect and credibility as far as their compatriots were concerned, many of whom expressed outright hatred toward them.\n\nMerezhkovsky's death in 1941 came as a heavy blow to Gippius. After the deaths of Dmitry Filosofov and her sister Anna (in 1940 and 1942 respectively) she found herself alone in the world and, as some sources suggest, contemplated suicide. With her secretary Vladimir Zlobin still around, though, Gippius resorted to writing what she hoped would some day gel into the comprehensive life story of her late husband. As Teffi remembered, \nGippius died on 9 September 1945. Her last written words were: \"Low is my price... And wise is God.\" She was interred in Sainte-Genevieve-des-Bois Russian Cemetery with her husband. A small group of people attended the ceremony, among them Ivan Bunin.\n\nModern scholars see Gippius's romantically tinged early poems as mostly derivative, Semyon Nadson and Friedrich Nietzsche being the two most obvious influences. The publication of Dmitry Merezhkovky's symbolist manifesto proved to be a turning point: in a short time Gippius became a major figure of Russian Modernism. Her early symbolist prose carried the strong influence of Dostoyevsky, while one of her later novels, \"Roman Tzarevich\" (1912), was said to be influenced again by Nietzsche. Gippius's first two short story collections, \"New People\" (1896) and \"Mirrors\" (1898), examining \"the nature of beauty in all of its manifestations and contradictions,\" were seen as formulaic. Her \"Third Book of Short Stories\" (1902) marked a change of direction and was described as \"sickly idiosyncratic\" and full of \"highbrow mysticism.\" Parallels have been drawn between Gippius's early 20th century prose and Vladimir Solovyov's \"Meaning of Love\", both authors examining the 'quest for love' as the means for self-fulfillment of the human soul.\n\nIt was not prose but poetry that made Gippius a major innovative force. \"Gippius the poet holds her own special place in Russian literature; her poems are deeply intellectual, immaculate in form, and genuinely exciting.\" Critics praised her originality and technical virtuosity, claiming her to be a \"true heir to Yevgeny Baratynsky's muse\".\n\nHer \"Collection of Poems. 1889–1903\" became an important event in Russian cultural life. Having defined the world of poetry as a three-dimensional structure involving \"Love and Eternity meeting in Death\", she discovered and explored in it her own brand of ethic and aesthetic minimalism. Symbolist writers were the first to praise her 'hint and pause' metaphor technique, as well as the art of \"extracting sonorous chords out of silent pianos,\" according to Innokenty Annensky, who saw the book as the artistic peak of \"Russia's 15 years of modernism\" and argued that \"not a single man would ever be able to dress abstractions in clothes of such charm [as this woman].\" Men admired Gippius's outspokenness too: Gippius commented on her inner conflicts, full of 'demonic temptations' (inevitable for a poet whose mission was 'creating a new, true soul', as she put it), with unusual frankness.\n\nThe 1906 collection \"Scarlet Sword\", described as a study in the 'human soul's metaphysics' performed from the neo-Christian standpoint, propagated the idea of God and man as one single being. The author equated 'self-denial' with the sin of betraying God, and detractors suspected blasphemy in this egocentric stance. Sex and death themes, investigated in the obliquely impressionist manner formed the leitmotif of her next book of prose, \"Black on White\" (1908). The 20th century also saw the rise of Gippius the playwright (\"Saintly Blood\", 1900, \"Poppie Blossom\", 1908). The most acclaimed of her plays, \"The Green Ring\" (1916), futuristic in plotline, if not in form, was successfully produced by Vsevolod Meyerhold for the Alexandrinsky Theatre. Anton Krainy, Gippius's alter ego, was a highly respected and somewhat feared literary critic whose articles regularly appeared in \"Novy Put\", \"Vesy\" and \"Russkaya Mysl\". Gippius's critical analysis, according to Brockhaus and Efron, was insightful, but occasionally too harsh and rarely objective.\n\nThe 1910 \"Collection of Poems. Book 2. 1903-1909\" garnered good reviews; Bunin called Gippius's poetry 'electric', pointing at the peculiar use of oxymoron as an electrifying force in the author's hermetic, impassive world. Some contemporaries found Gippius's works curiously unfeminine. Vladislav Khodasevich spoke of the conflict between her \"poetic soul and non-poetic mind.\" \"Everything is strong and spatial in her verse, there is little room for details. Her lively, sharp thought, dressed in emotional complexity, sort of rushes out of her poems, looking for spiritual wholesomeness and ideal harmony,\" modern scholar Vitaly Orlov said.\n\nGippius's novels \"The Devil's Doll\" (1911) and \"Roman Tzarevich\" (1912), aiming to \"lay bare the roots of Russian reactionary ideas,\" were unsuccessful: critics found them tendentious and artistically inferior. \"In poetry Gippius is more original than in prose. Well constructed, full of intriguing ideas, never short of insight, her stories and novellas are always a bit too preposterous, stiff and uninspired, showing little knowledge of real life. Gippius's characters pronounce interesting words and find themselves in interestingly difficult situations but fail to turn into living people in the reader's mind. Serving as embodiments of ideas and concepts, they are genuinely crafted marionettes put into action by the author's hand, not by their own inner motives.\"\n\nThe events of October 1917 led to Gippius severing all ties with most of those who admired her poetry, including Blok, Bryusov and Bely. The history of this schism and the reconstruction of the ideological collisions that made such a catastrophe possible became the subject matter of her memoirs \"The Living Faces\" (Живые лица, 1925). While Blok (the man whom she famously refused her hand in 1918) saw the Revolution as a 'purifying storm', Gippius was appalled by the 'suffocating dourness' of the whole thing, seeing it as one huge monstrosity \"leaving one with just one wish: to go blind and deaf.\" Behind all this, for Gippius, there was a kind of 'monumental madness'; it was all the more important for her to keep a \"healthy mind and strong memory,\" she explained.\n\nAfter \"Last Poems\" (1918) Gippius published two more books of verse, \"Poems. 1911–1920 Diaries\" (1922) and \"The Shining Ones\" (1938). Her poetry, prose and essays published in emigration were utterly pessimistic; the 'rule of beastliness', the ruins of human culture, and the demise of civilization were her major themes. Most valuable for Gippius were her diaries: she saw these flash points of personal history as essential for helping future generations to restore the true course of events. Yet, as a modern Russian critic has put it, \"Gippius's legacy, for all its inner drama and antinomy, its passionate, forceful longing for the unfathomable, has always borne the ray of hope, the fiery, unquenchable belief in a higher truth and the ultimate harmony crowning a person's destiny. As she herself wrote in one of her last poems, \"Alas, now they are torn apart: the timelessness and all things human / But time will come and both will intertwine into one shimmering eternity'.\"\n\nOn November 20, 2019, Google celebrated her 150th birthday with a Google Doodle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The single example of the M-156 was designed and built in response to a request from Pan American World Airways to provide a longer-range replacement for the Martin M-130.\n\nMartin delivered three Martin Ocean Transport Model-130s (M-130) to Pan Am in 1935. The aircraft became aviation icons of their day and were flown by Pan Am as the \"China Clipper\", \"Philippine Clipper\" and \"Hawaii Clipper\". Unfortunately for Martin, Pan Am rejected the M-156 in preference to the now classic Boeing 314. The Martin's model numbers reflected the aircraft's wingspan.\n\nPan Am was seeking to expand its trans-Pacific air service between San Francisco and Hong Kong in 1937. This route had been pioneered by the Martin M-130 and Pan Am was in need of a larger aircraft. The San Francisco / Hawaii flight was 2,400 miles and took 18 – 20 hours. Pan Am would have configured the M-156 as a 26-berth sleeper. The trans-Pacific flights between Hawaii / Midway island / Wake Island / Guam / Manila / Hong Kong were less than half the California / Hawaii leg. With a lower fuel load requirement, the M-156 could carry additional passengers. The M-156 would have been converted to a 33- to 56-seat day trip configuration. Pan Am and Matson Liners advertised an \"Air-Sea Cruise\" where Matson Liners carried passengers from San Francisco to Honolulu. Passengers would then transfer to Pan Am Clippers for westward flights to China and the Orient.\n\nAfter Pan Am selected the Boeing 314, Martin negotiated a deal with the Soviet Union for this aircraft and the M-156 was never put into regular trans-Pacific service. The M-156 was sold to the Soviets and operated by Aeroflot on the Soviet Union's far-east routes under the designation PS-30.\n\nLike the M-130, the M-156/PS-30 was a four-engined, parasol wing design. While the M-156/PS-30 retained the same length as its predecessor, its wingspan was increased by more than 27 ft (8.2 m) with the addition of flaps for increased control. The M-156/PS-30 also differed from the M-130 by having a horizontal stabilizer mounted atop a pylon at the rear of the hull, with twin vertical stabilizers and twin rudders located atop the horizontal stabilizer.\n\nAlong with the increase in wing size, fuel capacity was expanded from the M-130's 3,165 gal (11,981 l) to a total of 4,260 gal (16,126 l) in the M-156/PS-30. Power for each of the four engines increased from 850 hp (634 kW) to 1,000 hp (746 kW) utilizing the more powerful Wright Cyclone G2 radials. The Soviet government purchased the M-156 from Martin in 1937. The sale included a set of production plans, engineering specifications and manufacturing licenses as the Soviets intended to mass-produce this aircraft. The German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941 negated these plans.\n\nThe single M-156/PS-30 was put into regular service in 1940 by Aeroflot and was utilized in the Soviet Far East along the Pacific coast. In this role, Aeroflot configured the aircraft to carry up to 70 passengers. It was flown by Aeroflot until 1944, at which time it was scrapped.\n\n"}

Curry talked about his everyday life and events in the podcasting scene or the news in general, as well as playing music from the Podsafe Music Network and promotions for other podcasts. He had regular returning segments which were mostly contributions from fellow podcasts and his daughter Christina occasionally made guest appearances. The show had more than 500,000 subscribers at its peak.\n\nThe first edition was published on August 13, 2004, as a live show that software developers could use as a test for their download software. Podcasting technically already existed at that time, but Adam was the first to bring together RSS, scripting, and actual audio content (in a format much like a radioshow). He has since increasingly become the voice of the active podcasting community, helping fellow podcasters and founding initiatives such as Podshow and the Podsafe Music Network.\n\nIn September 2007, the number of broadcasts slumped dramatically following a Curry family reunion in Fire Island, New York State. Far from being daily, Curry started leaving gaps of up to five days between podcasts. Ongoing problems with the Podshow network web sites, which Curry founded, were rumoured to be partly to blame.\n\nThe Daily Source Code was one of the shows featured by Adam Curry on Sirius Satellite Radio in his \"Adam Curry's PodShow\" from May 1, 2005 till the end of the contract in May 2007. Since May 4, 2006 (episode 380) Curry has been promoting Daily Source Code in Second Life under the name \"Adam Neumann\" via Curry Castle.\n\nFrom episode 813 Curry trialed a semi-live format where the show was streamed and listeners of the show could call in. From around episode 820 in February 2009 Curry moved his attention to producing the No Agenda podcast with John C. Dvorak and production of the Daily Source Code became much more intermittent, at most weekly. Because of this production of The Daily Source Code was suspended with episode 821 on February 16, 2009. After a year of hiatus Curry rediscovered creative energy for the show and resumed The Daily Source Code with episode 822 on March 19, 2010, focusing more on music. However, it was announced in an episode of No Agenda that Curry would not be continuing production of the Daily Source Code, fearing penalties for copyright infringement.\n\nCurry has produced another episode of The Daily Source Code in May 2012, however, and announced plans to continue the podcast. As of 2015, only two more episodes had been produced: #866 in August 2012 and #867 in November 2013. In 2016 Curry again began regular production.\n\nThe DSC's signature introduction, \"...with 16 million dollars' worth of airplane strapped to my ass, and the next generation radio content in my ears, I'd like to think I'm flying into the future\" started life as a comment Curry received from airline pilot Christopher Stork during the podcast's early days (March 2005). Curry read it out during a show and that recording along with other audio clips used previously as part of the show's opening sequence were utilized by a listener and sometime contributor to produce a show opening, which was submitted back to Adam Curry. Curry so loved the produced piece he made it a predominating feature of the show's opening. It became the podcast's signature introduction and was highly recognized and often mimicked on other podcasts. Although the listener/contributor that produced the piece was never actually mentioned on the show, it was the voice over artist known as \"Kevin the Announcer Guy\", the imaging announcer for the early days of Jan Polet's Hit Test, a prominent feature played on the Daily Source Code.\n\nStarting in 2010 Adam Curry finishes each show with:\nLive your life with passion – and, as long as it lasts, enjoy your freedom.\n\n"}

He travelled particularly in the central Atlantic Ocean west of the Cape Verde islands, along the coast of West Africa and to India. His accomplishments in strategic warfare, exploration, mathematics and astronomy were of an exceptional level.\n\nPacheco Pereira was the son of João Pacheco and Isabel Pereira. In his youth he served as the King of Portugal's personal squire. In the year of 1455, having graduated with honors, he was awarded a study fellowship from the monarch himself. Later on, in 1488 he explored the west coast of Africa. His expedition fell ill with fever and lost their ship. Pacheco Pereira was rescued from the island of Príncipe in the Gulf of Guinea by Bartolomeu Dias when Dias was returning from rounding the Cape of Good Hope for the first time.\n\nThe knowledge he collected from Dias expedition as well as his own explorations granted him the post of official geographer of the Portuguese monarch. In 1494 he signed the Pope-sanctioned Treaty of Tordesillas, which shared the non-Christian world between Portugal and Spain.\n\nIn 1503 Duarte Pacheco Pereira departed for India as captain of \"Espírito Santo\", one of the three ships in the fleet headed by Afonso de Albuquerque. In 1504, he was placed in charge of the defence of Cochin, a Portuguese protectorate in India, from a series of attacks between March and July 1504 by the ruling Zamorin of Calicut. (see Battle of Cochin (1504)). Having only 150 Portuguese and a small number of Malabarese auxiliaries at his disposal, Cochin was vastly outnumbered by the Zamorin's army of 60,000. Nonetheless, by clever positioning, individual heroics and a lot of luck, Duarte Pacheco successfully resisted attacks for five months, until the humiliated Zamorin finally called off his forces. His son Lisuarte (or Jusarte) took a leading part in the fight.\n\nFor his exploits in the defense of Cochin, Duarte Pacheco was given a grant of arms by the Trimumpara Raja of Cochin, and greeted with honors the King Manuel I of Portugal and public festivities upon his return to Lisbon in 1505.\n\nHis diary (1506), preserved in the Portuguese National Archive (Torre do Tombo), is probably the first European document to acknowledge that chimpanzees built their own rudimentary tools.\n\nBetween 1505 and 1508 Duarte Pacheco Pereira composed a book, \"Esmeraldo de situ orbis\", inspired on Pomponius Mela's \"De situ Orbis\", which has been described as one of the first major scientific works \"reporting on what was observed and experimented in the newly 'discovered' environment.\" Never completed, it was not published until 1892, possibly to avoid giving others information about Portugal's valuable Guinea trade.\n\n(The meaning of the 'esmeraldo' in the title has been much speculated. Among the proposals, it is a reference to the emerald green of the sea; that it is an anagram combining the names 'Emmanuel' (for King Manuel I of Portugal) and 'Eduardus' (of Duarte Pacheco), that \"Esmeralda\" might have been the name (or nickname) of the ship Duarte Pacheco sailed to India, that it is a corruption of the Spanish word \"esmerado\" (meaning \"guide\"), that in Malayalam, an emerald gemstone is known as \"pache\" or \"pachec\", and thus \"Esmeraldo\" is a pun on his own name (thus, \"Pacheco's De Situ Orbis\").\n\nDuarte Pacheco Pereira was probably one of the first early modern Europeans to scientifically study the relationship between the tides and the phases of the moon, which played a critical importance in the course of the Battle of Cochin, and carefully took notes on the timing of the tides. Pacheco is said to have been the first to notice their connection to the moon and to establish rules for predicting the progress of tides by reference to lunar observations. He also sifted through his data to correct and improve astronomical observations (notably correcting the average daily deviation of the moon from the sun) and constructing nautical measurements to be used by future Portuguese navigators.\n\nIn 1508, Duarte Pacheco was commissioned by the Portuguese king to give chase to Mondragon French privateer which operated between the Azores and the Portuguese coast, where they attacked the ships coming from Portuguese India. Duarte Pacheco located and cornered Mondragon off Cape Finisterre in 1509, and defeated and captured him.\n\nLater in life, while away governing São Jorge da Mina, he was slandered by his enemies at court with accusations of theft and corruption. He was recalled to the capital and briefly imprisoned until he was exonerated by the Crown being proved innocent. But the damage was done as he had lost his governorship, his wealth, and influence. Although he was acquitted his protector, King João II of Portugal had died and been replaced by a king who didn't acknowledge the value of Duarte Pacheco. Duarte Pacheco had served the previous king as a squire, and had served King Manuel merely as a high ranking servant. His distance from Lisbon and his success meant he had many enemies abroad, and few friends in the capital to defend him. He died alone and penniless.\n\nAccording to one of its most important biographers, the Portuguese historian Joaquim Barradas de Carvalho, who lived in exile in Brazil in the 1960s, Duarte Pacheco was a genius comparable to Leonardo da Vinci. With the anticipation of more than two centuries, the cosmographer was responsible for calculating the value of the degree of the meridian arc with a margin of error of only 4%, when the current error at the time varied between 7 and 15%.\n\nIt has also been suggested that Duarte Pacheco Pereira may have discovered the coasts of Maranhão, Pará and Marajó island and the mouth of the Amazon River in 1498, preceding the possible landings of the expeditions of Amerigo Vespucci in 1499, of Vicente Yáñez Pinzon in January 1500, and of Diego de Lepe in February 1500; and the Cabral's expedition in April 1500, making him the first known European explorer of present-day Brazil. This claim is based on interpretations of the cipher manuscript \"Esmeraldo de Situ Orbis\", written by Duarte Pacheco Pereira, which gives the following brief account:\n\nMost fortunate Prince, we have known and seen how in the third year of your reign in the year of Our Lord 1498, in which your Highness ordered us to discover the Western region, a very large landmass with many large islands with many large islands adjacent, extending 70° North of the Equator, and located beyond the greatness of the Ocean, has been discovered and navigated; this distant land is densely populated and extends 28° degrees on the other side of the Equator towards the Antarctic Pole. Such is its greatness and length that on either side its end has not been seen or known, so that it is certain that it goes round the whole globe.\n\nHowever, in their book \"Foundations of the Portuguese empire, 1415-1580\", historians Bailey Wallys, Boyd Shafer and George Winius, based in the Portuguese historian Duarte Leite and other authors, make the following comment:\n\n\"What really is important,\" Duarte Leite says, \"is to know whether Pacheco arrived in Brazil before Alvares Cabral (April 22, 1500). In agreement with Luciano Pereira, such modern Portuguese historians as Faustino da Fonseca, Brito Rebelo, Lopes de Mendonça, and Jaime Cortesão say he did. . . as does Vignaud; and I believe he does not lack supporters in Brazil.\" \"However,\" says Leite, \"if Pacheco did discover areas east of the Line of Demarcation and did bring back news of this to [King] Manuel [of Portugal], the reason which induced Don Manuel to keep secret. . . such an important discovery escapes me. As soon as Cabral returned in 1501, Manuel announced the discovery of Brazil to Ferdinand and Isabella of Spain. Why would he not in 1499, after the return of Vasco da Gama, make a similar announcement if Pacheco had already discovered Brazil? No objection could come on the part of Spain, given the division made by the Treaty of Tordesillas, as indeed none came in 1501 when Cabral's discovery was announced. I am persuaded that Pacheco neither discovered Brazil in 1498 nor was present two years later at its discovery by Cabral.\"\n\nDuarte Pacheco Pereira's \"Esmeraldo de Situ Orbis\" is the first European navigation script book to mention the coast of Brazil.\n\nHe married Antónia de Albuquerque, daughter of Jorge Garcês and wife Isabel de Albuquerque Galvão, only daughter of Duarte Galvão by first wife Catarina de Sousa e Albuquerque, and had eight children:\n\n\n"}

He was the brother of Bartolomeu Dias and discovered some of the Cape Verde islands together with António Noli.\n\nIn 1497 on the first Portuguese India Armadas expedition to India, Diogo Dias served as \"escrivão\" (clerk) aboard Vasco da Gama's flagship \"São Gabriel\". Dias was one of the main conduits between Gama and the Zamorin of Calicut, and was briefly taken prisoner by the Zamorin when negotiations became contentious.\n\nIn 1500, Diogo Dias accompanied the 2nd armada of Pedro Álvares Cabral as one of the captains of the fleet, with a commission to open trade at Sofala. Diogo Dias was one of the first to go ashore in the discovery of Brazil in April 1500. Famously, Dias is credited for breaking the ice with the wary Tupiniquim on the beach by jumping into an impromptu joyful dance to the accompaniment of Tupi pipes.\n\nDuring an expedition along the Cape of Good Hope (Diogo may have originally called it the Cape of Storms) with Pedro Álvares Cabral and his brother, Dias's ship got separated from the main fleet during the crossing of Cape of Good Hope (his brother's ship was lost during that crossing). Having struck a route too far east, Dias was the first European to sight the island of Madagascar and is often credited with naming the island of \"São Lourenço\", on account of it being found on St. Lawrence's day (August 10, 1500). Although the island was not unknown; its existence and Arabic name, \"Island of the Moon\", was already reported by Pêro da Covilhã back in 1490.\n\nDias's subsequent attempts to find the main fleet ended with him mistakenly sailing past Cape Guardafui and into the Gulf of Aden, waters as yet unsailed by Portuguese ships. Trapped by contrary winds, Dias spent several harrowing months in the area. Battered by tempests, attacked by pirates and finally forced aground on the Eritrean coast, in a desperate search for water and food for his rapidly dying crew. By the time he left there, Dias had only six crewmen left.\n\nUnable to find Cabral, Diogo Dias' ship hobbled back home alone. Nicolau Coelho, leading the vanguard of Cabral's returning armada, finally stumbled upon the weary Dias at the watering stop of Bezeguiche (Bay of Dakar, Senegal) in June, 1501. They returned to Lisbon together.\n\n"}
{"id": "2036672", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2036672", "title": "António de Noli", "text": "António de Noli\n\nAntonio de Noli (born 1415 or possibly 1419;) was a 15th-century Genoese nobleman and navigator, and the first governor of the earliest European overseas colony in Subsaharan Africa. He discovered some of the Cape Verde islands on behalf of Henry the Navigator and he was made first Governor of Cape Verde by King Afonso V. In most history or geographic books, including ancient chronicles, or encyclopedias, he is referred as \"Antonio de Noli\", as well as in official information by the Government of Cape Verde or in Cape Verde history articles or references. In Italy, he is known also as \"Antonio da Noli\" (see Note 21, below) or sometimes referred as \"Antoniotto Usodimare\".\n\nAntonio de Noli was born to a patrician family in Genoa, Italy, as referred in ancient sources of the epoch; e.g. Portuguese king's historian João de Barros stated already in 1552 that Antonio Noli was born in Genoa, and \"of noble blood\". Modern historians and researches also specify Antonio Noli as \"Genovese\" or \"Genoese\", e.g. Dumoriez (1762), Thomas (1860), Hamilton (1975), Diffie and Winius (1977), Irwin and Wilson (1999). It has also been put forward that Antonio de Noli would have instead born in Noli (Savona) Italy (see Note 21, below). After he was exiled from Genoa amid political disputes compromising main families Fregoso and Adorno, Antonio de Noli (Navy captain, and cartography expert) sailed to Portugal ca 1447 in command of a small expedition of three vessels and with his brother Bartholomew (a Genoa lawyer) and nephew Raphael. In Portugal, de Noli became engaged in Ultramar explorations by Henry the Navigator. From 1462 to 1496, he founded and then was Captain of Ribeira Grande (modern-day Cidade Velha) at the southern end of Santiago Island.\n\nThe de Noli family is believed to have its ancient roots in \"the small city and Castle of Noli\". By the 14th century, there were two main branches of the Noli family in Northern Italy sharing a pre-medieval origin in the ancient territory of Noli (Savona province). One branch was established in Genoa, Liguria, and the other in Novara, Piedmont, where the Noli (\"famiglia di signore\") inhabited the Castle of Cameriano by the beginning of the 15th century. It is also recorded that members of the Noli family established in Genoa participated in government already by the 13th century, i.e. as \"Consigliere della Signoria\" in 1261. In 1382, Giacomo de Noli, ancestor of Captain Antonio de Noli, was appointed one member of the Twelve-Elderly Council of Genoa (\"XII-Anziani del Comune\") under the lead of Duke Nicolas de Guarco. When Nicolas de Guarco took over the rule of Genoa after the Fregoso, in 1378, he had \"appointed in positions of trust the noblemen which have been neglected in the previous administrations\", and thus also appointed the Fieschi. The participation of the de Noli in the Guarco's ruling of Genoa in alliance with the Fieschi would have, years afterwards, dramatic consequences for Antonio de Noli and his brother Bartholomew. Those prior political associations of the de Noli in Genoa provide a helpful background in explaining both their forced departure to exile in Portugal in 1447, and also the circumstances around the later repatriation of their descendants some decades after, first in Cesena and finally anew in homeland Genoa.\n\nOld history records attribute Antonio de Noli the discovery of Cape Verde Islands, supposedly \"the ancient Hesperides of Pliny and Ptolemy\". This according to a \"carta regia\" (royal letter) of 19 September 1462. It is uncertain which of the Cape Verde Islands were discovered by Antonio de Noli. Some of the islands are mentioned in a letter of donation dated 3 December 1460; the rest in the above-mentioned from 19 September 1462. Noli has claim to discovering the first set of islands, while the second were possibly found by Diogo Gomes. However, the events in question are poorly recorded in documents from the time, a reasonable alternative would be that some or all of these second set of islands were discovered by Diogo Dias, Diogo Afonso and Alvise Cadamosto.\n\nThe official royal letter of 29 October 1462 states that it was Diogo Afonso, the king's scribe, who had discovered the other (last) seven islands that were mentioned in the royal letter of 19 September 1462. This letter of 19 September 1462 grants all the islands of Cape Verde to Dom Fernando and the other seven islands are designated but the discoverer is not named. In this letter, Antonio de Noli's name is given as the discoverer of the first five islands, being also the first time he is mentioned by name as the discoverer. The letter of 3 December 1460 was a royal grant to Infante Ferdinand the Saint Prince after the demise of his brother Henry the Navigator in 1460.\n\nGovernor Antonio de Noli had one daughter (Dona Branca de Aguiar, who married the Portuguese nobleman Dom Jorge Correia de Sousa, \"fidalgo da casa real\") and one son, who is mentioned to have accompanied him during the early exploration years in mainland Africa. During the occupation of Cape Verde Islands by Castile (a main base of modern Spain) during the Portuguese-Castilian war of 1475–1479, the Italian Antonio de Noli remained governor in spite of his titles had been given to him by the Portuguese. In the aftermath of the Treaty of Alcáçovas in 1479 and the reestablishment of Portuguese rule, the governorship of the Islands went instead to Noli's daughter Branca and her Portuguese spouse. Thereafter, no records of the whereabouts on Antonio Noli - including his demise or location of his son and descendants, or his fortune (as well as in the case of his Genoa brother Bartholomew or nephew Raphael) – have been found in Portugal, Cape Verde, or Spain. In 1497, the Noli were still banned from returning to Italy via Genoa for political reasons.\n\nIn 2008, several manuscripts indicating the presence of the de Noli family in Cesena by the end of 1400 and not earlier, was found at the Biblioteca Malatestiana in Cesena, Italy. Among the Malatestiana Library manuscripts, two separate documents depicting the coat of arms of the Noli family were also found. In one of these manuscripts, \"Famiglia Noli \"oriunda\"\" was written under the Noli coat of arms. The reference to \"oriunda\" in this context means \"not from Cesena\", thus \"coming from an outer territory\". The first entry of the de Noli in the Cesena manuscripts refers to \"Simone \"de Antonio Noli\" Biondi\", which indicates, according to naming praxis at the time, that Antonio Noli was his father. Later, and with the name Simone \"de Noli\" Biondi, he is mentioned in another manuscript as a member of the Cesena Council (\"Consiglio di Cesena\") in 1505. The same position was held in later years by two other de Noli descendants, Antonio Noli of \"Tregga rotta\" in 1552 and \"Antonio de Noli\" Biondi in 1556. This Antonio de Noli ceased to be a member of the Cesena Council in 1558 and afterwards the family de Noli was reported in a Malatestiana manuscript as \"extinct\" in Cesena. However, a few years later, descendants of an Antonio de Noli appeared again, living in Northern Genoa (Valleregia, Serra Ricco). The first register of the de Noli in the Family book of Valleregia Parish of the period took place in 1586. The entries show the names of Antonio de Noli, Bartholomew, Simone, Raphael, and others known names used already in the previous generation of navigator Antonio de Noli and his descendants. The descendants of the de Noli family established anew in the hamlet of Noli in Northern Genoa (\"La frazione di Noli al comune di Serra Ricco\"). Like most of the de Noli families with Ligurian ancestry, the coat of arms of the family of Antonio de Noli and his descendants carries the red and white colours of the ancient cities of Noli and Genoa.\n\nDuring World War II, an Italian destroyer was named \"Antonio da Noli\". It sank after striking a mine off the coast of Corsica on 9 September 1943, the day after the Italian surrender to the Allies (see Navigatori class destroyer).\n\n"}

Many government organisations were set up there, including a harbour and port. Boats and ships from the north to the south would stop there, loading and unloading cargo, leaving for Singapore or Malacca. Shops were opened and many people went there to settle down. At that point, many people disagreed with the name Kukub on the grounds that it was not a Malay name, so they changed it to Kukup.\n\nDue to its rapid development, Kukup became one of the big towns in Johor. This was due to the coming of Tuan Syed Mohamed Alsagoff who had sought and obtained approval from Sultan Abu Bakar Johor to explore and open up agriculture lands in the southwest Coast of Johor, bordered by Sungai Permas, Sungai Pontian Kechil, Sungai Pontian Besar, and Sungai Jeram Batu. (Sungai in Malay means river.) Kukup was rapidly developed under Constantinople Estate owned by Tuan Syed Mohamed Alsagoff. Because of this, the whole place was named \"Kukup District\". Kukup District was replaced with \"Pontian District\" when the main road linking Pontian and Johor Bahru was completed in 1900. At that time all the government organisations in Kukup were shifted to Pontian.

When San Francisco based Big Time Wrestling became a member of the NWA in 1968 they began promoting their version of the NWA World Tag Team Championship as part of their shows until the championship was abandoned in 1979. The NWA rules allowed each individual member to promote a championship under that name, which meant there were several NWA World Tag Team Championships promoted across North America at some point between 1950 and 1982, with two different versions being promoted in San Francisco, although not at the same time. At one point in 1957 no less than 13 different versions of the NWA World Tag Team Championship were recognized across the United States. At least 21 different regional branches of the NWA World Tag Team Championship have identified as being active at some point between 1950 and 1991. In 1992 the NWA Board of Directors sanctioned one main NWA World Tag Team Championship under their control. As it is a professional wrestling championship, it is not won via legitimate competition; it is instead won via a scripted ending to a match or on occasion awarded to a wrestler because of a storyline.\n\nRay Eckert and Hard Boiled Haggerty are recognized as the first holders of the NWA San Francisco version of the championship, said to have defeated the team of Ron Etchison and Larry Moquin, although no direct record of the match has been found; it was only mentioned on television. Due to gaps in documentation from the era not all championship changes have been record with specific dates, only the general period of time that they happened. Due to this it is impossible to say which team held the championship for the shortest period of time although it is unlikely to be shorter than the one-day reign of Mike and Ben Sharpe from January 9 to 10, 1958. The Sharpe Brothers' eighth reign lasted at least 131 days, the longest known reign of any champions. The Sharpe Brothers also hold the record for most reigns, a total of 18, 15 more than any other team. In 1957 the San Francisco version of the championship was one of thirteen NWA World Tag Team Championships being promoted in the United States throughout the NWA territories. The NWA: San Francisco version of the championship was abandoned in when promoter Joe Malcevicz closed his promotion in 1962.\n\nIn 1961 Roy Shire started a rival wrestling promotion in San Francisco called Big Time Wrestling, in direct competition with NWA: San Francisco. Shires' promotion created its own World Tag Team Championship in 1961, with Guy and Joe Brunetti as its first champions. Initially Shire was associated with the American Wrestling Alliance, but in 1968 he became a member of the NWA. At that point the Big Time Wrestling tag team championship was given the NWA suffix. Big Time Wrestling abandoned the tag team championship in 1979 and two years later the promotion closed. While it is possible that there were shorter reigns, the seven-day reign of the Great Mephisto and Kinji Shibuya in April 1973 is the shortest documented title reign. The Blonde Bombers's (Ray Stevens and Pat Patterson) reign that started in April 1965 was the longest reign on record, a total of 623 days.\n\nKey\n\nKey\n\n\n"}

The Radar Museum, now managed by Finmeccanica, the first created by a company in Europe, is founded on the principles of reclaiming, reorganising and keeping alive the history of radar manufacturing, which began in Italy over 60 years ago at the company’s Fusaro site (Naples).\n\nIn the UK Selex ES sponsored the Combined Services Disabled Ski Team (CSDST), which enables members to pursue the sport and help rehabilitate those who have suffered a serious injury. It is hoped that some CSDST members may represent Great Britain in the 2018 Winter Paralympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea. To date, the company has raised over £80,000 for CSDST through several fundraising activities.\n\n\n"}

The loch is approximately in size and runs east-west along a sheltered glen. It is sometimes considered to be the source of the River Forth, although the river's true source is the confluence of its outflow, the Avondhu River, and Duchray Water. Loch Ard lies downstream of Loch Chon. The loch contains several small islands including Eilean Gorm, Briedach, St. Mallo, which is rumored to have an old chapel dedicated to that saint, and Dundochill, which is the site of Duke Murdoch's castle that may have been built by the Duke of Albany. Though one of Scotland's smaller lochs, it is one of the most picturesque and its sheltered location means it is ideal for kayaking and other water sports.\n\nThe Queen Elizabeth Forest Park encompasses Loch Ard and the surrounding forest. The waters of Loch Ard are home to both a sailing and rowing club. The villages of Kinlochard, and Milton lie on its shores. The village of Aberfoyle lies 2 miles (3 km) to its east, with the summit of Craigmore behind it, while the mountain of Ben Lomond sits to its west. The northern shores of Loch Ard are dominated by the mountain ridge of the tall Beinn an Fhogharaidh.\n\nLoch Ard is surrounded by 16 miles (26 km) of family friendly mountain bike, walking, and horseback trails. These trails, some with waymarkers, link into a much larger network of forest fire roads, which can take the rider on 30 km+ circular routes through the park. The Loch Ard Family Sculpture Trails provide an interactive outdoor experience, with sculptures placed along the trails, interesting seating, and sound posts, among other features.\n\nLoch Ard is also home to many different species of wildlife, such as roe deer, barn owls, capercaillie, and various types of plants and insects. The loch also has a large stock of brown trout, pike, and perch.\n\n, a three-masted, square-rigged clipper ship bore its name. The ship sank off the coast of Australia at what has been known since as Loch Ard Gorge.\n"}
{"id": "2036704", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2036704", "title": "Mock the Week", "text": "Mock the Week\n\nMock the Week is a British topical satirical celebrity panel show, that was created by Dan Patterson and Mark Leveson, who also co-created the comedy game show \"Whose Line Is It Anyway?\". Performers deliver mostly prepared answers on different subjects under the guise of an improvised gameshow. It is made by independent production company Angst Productions, and made its debut on BBC Two on 5 June 2005, with the show's theme song being \"News of the World\" by The Jam. The show has featured a variety of different stand-up performers, some being part of the show for several series as a permanent fixture, with host Dara Ó Briain and comedian Hugh Dennis having appeared in every episode since its debut. Old episodes currently air on Dave, which is frequently mentioned on the show.\n\nThe general format of the show involves the host subjecting the panel, which consist of two teams of three performers (referred to as panellists), to a series of rounds in which they either answer questions on various news topics from the previous week of news, often with them giving improvised comedic answers, or performing comedic challenges based on a subject(s) provided to them (e.g. Healthcare). News topics range from major international news stories to regional news items from within Britain, with the show sometimes including photos and quotes related to the news articles used on the show. All episodes are approximately 30 minutes long, with each series featuring at least one compilation episode containing the best moments of a series, rounds that were not broadcast, and outtakes that occurred during filming. While most games are done around a large desk, to the left of it in the studio is the \"Performance Area\", a large stage area with a large TV screen that is normally used for stand-up and improvisation challenges, primarily \"Scenes We'd Like To See\". In addition, a smaller stage next to the desk is used and referred to as the \"Press Pit\", often used in the round \"Between the Lines\".\n\nAlthough the show has the format of a game and has a winning and losing team, the entire show exists mainly to provide starting points for improvised comedy routines rather than to function as a serious competition. Specific scores are never referred to, with the actual points won never stated by the host; current host Dara Ó Briain always ends the round by stating that he has given \"the points\" to the team he judges should receive them. In episode 11 of season 6, Dara admitted that winners of each round and point allocation was not based on anything specific, and viewers should \"stop e-mailing in.\" Along with the scoring system, neither team has, in effect, a team captain (Hugh Dennis is sometimes referred to as such in publicity material), with such a distinction never being made on the programme itself.\n\nThroughout the show's history, \"Mock The Week\" has consistently had at least one permanent comedian/stand-up performers within its panel who appears regularly within every episode; up until the fifteenth series, the programme regularly featured two permanent members in its panel, and in some series the show featured a third permanent member. While there have been a total of six performers who have performed regularly on the show as a permanent panellist, only Hugh Dennis has appeared regularly in every episode since its debut (with the exception of a special episode of the programme that was broadcast as part of David Walliams' 24 Hour Panel People). The other five performers to have been regular, permanent members on the show include:\n\n\nAlong with at least one or two permanent members, the panel often consists of guest performers, some of whom have had frequent appearances on the show. The following have appeared at least three times on the show as a guest panellist \"(up to 6 December 2019, not including the 2011 Comic Relief special)\": \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\na. Appearances made before becoming a regular panellist.\nb. Also made an appearance in the Comic Relief \"24 Hour Panel People\" special.\n\nAs part of the general format of the show, performers take part in a mixture of quiz-styled games (often described as \"rounds\"), in which they answer with comedic responses or made-up, on the spot answers, perform stand-up comedy, and partake in improvisational games. Games that feature are either regularly used, occasionally used, or were retired after a while.\nThe following games feature in all episodes of Mock the Week:\n\nThese games occasionally appear in some episodes, but not all, with those not used either featured as part of a series' compilation episode or released as part of a DVD extra(s). The reason these may not appear and be cut from an episode is either because of the language used or the highly politically incorrect answers the panel members give, at the time that the show was broadcast:\n\n\nThese rounds were originally used in the show before being dropped (most were used in Series 1 and 2), or replaced:\n\nOn several occasions, \"Mock the Week\" has been the source of complaints, due to some risqué comments made by the panellists and the show's extreme use of profanity (in particular Frankie Boyle). In the first episode of Series 4, during a segment called \"What The Queen Didn't Say in Her Christmas Message\", Boyle made the comment: \"I am now so old that my pussy is haunted.\" This led to the BBC's director general Mark Thompson being challenged about the comments on \"Newsnight\". Boyle later quipped \"That was three years ago. If it wasn't haunted then it certainly is now.\"\n\nIn 2008, a larger controversy arose following another comment made by Boyle regarding swimmer Rebecca Adlington. Boyle stated that \"she looks like someone who's looking at themselves in the back of a spoon\". The BBC ruled that the jokes were indeed \"humiliating\" and \"risked offending the audience\", while also calling Boyle \"a brilliant member of the team\". Despite this, Adlington's agent said that simply admitting mistakes was not enough, saying: \"By giving Frankie Boyle a rebuke they fail to discourage others from doing the same.\"\n\nSince leaving the show, Boyle has criticised both the show's production team and the BBC Trust. He claims that the show did not cover enough major news stories and was too restrictive on his risqué comedy act, as the producers and the BBC Trust were afraid of \"frightening the horses\".\nThe lack of female guests on the programme has been the subject of complaints in the letters page of the \"Radio Times\". Jo Brand, while criticising the male-dominated genre of comedy panel shows, said in 2009, \"I don't do \"Mock the Week\" any more and neither do some male stand-ups I know who have tried it once. We just don’t like the prospect of having to bite someone’s foot off before they let us say something.\"\nIn 2013, former panelist Rory Bremner stated his reasons for leaving the show, saying: \"I felt that there was a new and highly competitive and quite aggressive tendency there and felt uncomfortable. But I've since found out that very few people have felt comfortable doing Mock the Week.\" He also criticised the way comedians like Linda Smith were treated by new comedians, who \"are like prize fighters\".\n\nA DVD, \"Mock the Week: Too Hot for TV\" was released on 26 November 2007. It contains almost three hours of material, including three extended episodes from series five, containing scenes that were considered too rude for broadcast. The three extended episodes are titled, 'Putin, Henman & Konnie Huq', 'Nuts, Pies and Nim Nim Nim' and 'Money, Sex and The Lib Dems'.\n\"Mock the Week: Too Hot for TV 2\" was released on 9 November 2009. Again, the DVD contains the main 'Too Hot For TV' feature with a compilation of unseen footage, plus three extended episodes from the series archives titled, 'The Anal Lube Show', 'The Leg Show' and 'The Hedgehog Show'. The extended episodes have a total of more than 40 minutes of unseen material. Audio CD versions of both DVDs are available.\n\"Mock the Week: Too Hot for TV 3\" was released on 8 November 2010. Like the previous two, this DVD features an hour-long \"smut reel\" and three extended episodes titled 'The Elves and Testicles Show', 'The Prisons and Other Dodgy Stuff Show', and 'The Johnny Blowjob and Bird Flu Show'.\n\nBoxtree published seven original tie-in books between 2008 and 2014, plus one which compiled the best of the first two books.\n\n\"Mock the Week: Scenes We'd Like to See\" (August 2008)<br>\n\"Mock the Week: This Year's Book\" (September 2009)<br>\n\"Mock the Week: 1001 Jokes\" (January 2010, collected the best of the first two books, later published in paperback as \"Mock the Week: 1001 Scenes We'd Like to See\")<br>\n\"Mock the Week: Next Year's Book\" (September 2010)<br>\n\"Mock The Week's Funniest Book Of All Time\" (2011)<br>\n\"Mock The Week's Only Book You'll Ever Need (2012)<br>\n\"Mock The Week's Ultimate Panic-Buy!\" (2013)<br>\n\"Mock The Week's Brand Spanking New Scenes We'd Like To See\" (2014).\n\n"}

He graduated from the University of Zagreb Faculty of Mechanical Engineering and Naval Architecture in 1973. He then emigrated to the United States of America, settling in Minnesota where he gradually began his business, Cortec Corporation.\nOver the years he became one of the wealthiest Croatian Americans. He first ventured into the Croatian politics as an independent candidate in the 2003 parliamentary elections.\n\nIn 2005, he ran as an independent candidate on the Croatian presidential elections. His campaign was partially based on his autobiography \"Američki san dečka s Trešnjevke\" (American dream of a kid from Trešnjevka) that he had published in 1994 - creating image of a simple Zagreb youth, who fulfilled the American Dream. It was also based on his opposition to the ICTY and Eurosceptic views. His success story along with his self-funded American-style campaign brought a new perspective to many voters.\n\nOn 2 January, to the surprise of many, first election projections showed him as winning 2nd place, knocking the government's candidate Jadranka Kosor out of the race. Immediately, many commentators began to interpret his success as a protest vote against the Croatian political establishment, engulfed in corruption and being notoriously inefficient. As if Mikšić, already wealthy has been seen by voters as more decent and less corruptible candidate.\n\nFew hours later, new projections, based on the votes cast by Croatian citizens in neighboring Bosnia and Herzegovina, brought Jadranka Kosor to the 2nd place. Mikšić was surprised as was the most of Croatian public. At first he refused to accept results and blamed the failure on alleged vote fraud, and \"dead people voting\".\nHe called supporters to demonstrate on streets over the alleged fraud, inspired by the, at the time current, Orange Revolution in Ukraine. He later called off planned demonstrations, citing his respect for the law and wanting to prevent incident and possible casualties brought on by the protest.\n\nFollowing the presidential elections, Mikšić continued to challenge the results, bringing allegations of voter fraud. He requested vote recounts from Croatia's Constitutional Court stating that many deceased people were not only registered to vote but also cast votes in the election; a problem that the Croatian government has faced multiple times.\nHe continued to pursue Croatian politics, announcing his candidacy in local elections, including those for Zagreb City Assembly. Mikšić's campaigning appeared to have effect within the 2005 local elections. His slate did enter the Zagreb City Assembly, but with only three seats, which was fewer than he expected.\n\nMikšić entered into the Croatian presidential election, 2009–2010, but was eliminated in the first round with 2.1% of the vote.\n\n"}

By detecting weak signals (Igor Ansoff, 1975), which can be perceived as important discontinuities in an organizational environment, SEWS allows organizations to react strategically ahead of time.\n\nThe underlying assumption of SEWS is that discontinuities do not emerge without warning. These warning signs are described as \"weak signals\" (Ansoff, 1975), a concept aimed at early detection of those signals which could lead to strategic surprises -- events which have the potential to jeopardise an organization’s strategy. Furthermore, the concept of a SEWS is intended to constitute an important part of a strategic management system, operating real-time in an organization, and assisting in identifying the new, which emerge as those \"weak signals\".\n\nDetecting weak signals is achieved by scanning the organizational environment. The concept of environmental scanning (Aguilar,1967) describes a process whereby the environment in which an organization operates is systematically scanned for relevant information. The purpose is to identify early signals of possible environmental change and to detect environmental change already underway.\n\nThe need for a formal strategic early warning process in organizations is based in large part on the existence of blindspots, which prevents leaders and executives from identifying weak signals of change (Gilad, 1998). Any formal SEWS process must incorporate blindspots analysis as part of its cycle.\n\nThe system must be able to detect symptoms and weak signals outside and in the company and sent to a competent employee who will carry out an analysis of the cause of this state and confirm or deny negative development that might lead to a crisis situation (Zuzak, 2001).\nThe ideal SEWS process has three phases. \n\nThe scanning activity is complemented by monitoring trends and issues that have already drawn attention. \n\n\nSociety of Competitive Intelligence Professionals\n"}

The map, marred by an inkwell accident in 1869, has a note by the Azores archipelago, presumably written by Vallseca, stating: \n\nThe surname and part of the date are smudged. The earliest known reading of this portion of the map is by a Majorcan named Pasqual in 1789 (before the ink accident) who jotted the surname down as \"Guullen\". It has since been read by other investigators as Diego de Senill ('the Old' - a hopeful reference in the direction of Gonçalo Velho, who officially discovered the Azores in 1431). Others have proposed de Sevill or de Seville or de Sunis, Survis, Sinus, Simis, Sines, Sivils. The date has been variously interpreted as MCCCCXXVII (1427) or MCCCCXXXII (1432) or MCCCCXXXVII (1437).\nIn 1943, Portuguese historian Damião Peres proposed that only Diogo de Sunis or Diogo de Silves should be entertained as readings from the smudged surname, and opted for Silves simply because Portuguese surnames of that era are usually toponyms and that the town of Silves, in the Algarve, not far from the port of Lagos (where Henry was organizing his expeditions), was not unlikely. He also settled on interpreting the date as 1427. Peres's reading of name and date have since become common in Portuguese sources. The hypothesis has been sufficiently accepted that the Portuguese postal service saw fit to emit a stamp in honor of 'Diogo de Silves' in 1990.\nThere is no other record or information about Diogo de Silves, whom he worked for or what his objective was. It is often assumed (albeit without corroboration) that Diogo de Silves was a captain in the service of the Portuguese prince Henry the Navigator. If so, he may have been sent out in 1427 as just one of Henry's several expeditions in the 1420s down the West African coast in an attempt to double Cape Bojador, or that he may have been going on a routine trip to Madeira, and it has even been speculated he might have been part of a failed Portuguese attack or slave raid on the Canary Islands. How he ended up in the Azores is uncertain - he may have been blown off course, or may have been gathering intelligence about oceanic winds and currents, perhaps experimenting with one of the earliest \"volta do mar\" routes for Henry. Finally, the note that he was the \"pilot\" retains the possibility that the captain of that expedition was actually someone else (Gonçalo Velho?). The reference to the 'King' and not Henry raises the possibility he may have been in the service of the Admiral of Portugal Pedro de Menezes, 1st Count of Vila Real (then governor of Ceuta) rather than Prince Henry.\n\nThe only thing that can be gathered from Vallseca's 1439 map is that he probably only discovered the eastern and possibly central clusters of the Azores archipelago, that he probably did not reach the western islands of Flores and Corvo (although westerly islands are drawn, they are probably fantastical; Vallseca seems to have lifted the names directly from earlier maps, e.g. Catalan Atlas of 1375).\n\n \n"}

A product of the American college soccer system, Smith broke records with Seton Hall University then played professionally with Women's United Soccer Association (WUSA) franchise Philadelphia Charge. After returning to Arsenal for a period which included a 2007 UEFA Women's Cup win, Smith was tempted back to America with another professional contract, this time with Boston Breakers in Women's Professional Soccer (WPS). She accumulated 117 caps for the England women's national football team since making her debut in 1995. Despite being hit by serious injury during her career, Smith is England's record goalscorer with 46 goals. She played for Great Britain at the 2012 London Olympics.\n\nWhile growing up in the Garston area of Watford, Smith regularly played football on boys' teams until, at the age of seven, she was kicked out of Garston Boys Club – despite being the top goalscorer – when the parents of her male opponents complained. After continuing at Pinner Girls, a team formed by Smith's father, she developed her skills at Wembley Ladies and made her senior debut in the 1994–95 season. In August 1995, Pete Davies wrote in \"The Independent\" that the \"lethally quick, bountifully gifted\" Smith was: \"the outstanding prospect in the women's game today.\" After moving to Arsenal Ladies during 1996–97, she scored two goals and assisted on the third in a 3–0 win over Liverpool which secured the Premier League title that season. She spent that year at West Herts College, but transferred to Seton Hall University in the United States in 1997.\n\nSmith enrolled at Seton Hall as a student-athlete. She played for the Seton Hall Pirates from 1997 through 1999. In her first year at Seton Hall in 1997, Smith set scoring records for the Big East Conference and became the first athlete in any sport to be the conference's (Offensive) Player of the Year and Newcomer of the Year in the same season. In the following two seasons, she was the leading scorer not only in the Big East, but in the whole of NCAA Division I, and was named Big East Offensive Player of the Year in both years. At the end of her university career, the school retired her number 6 shirt, she became the first Seton Hall athlete in any sport other than basketball to have a number retired. In her three years at Seton Hall, she set school records with 76 goals and 174 points while playing in just 51 matches.\n\nAt the culmination of her studies, Smith remained in the United States, remarking: \"women's football in England is a joke.\" Smith's first professional club was New Jersey Lady Stallions of W-League, for which she played on from 1999-2000. However, a new top-flight women's league was about to start in the United States and Smith stayed in the country to participate in the project.\n\nThe Women's United Soccer Association was formed in early 2000. Smith was drafted second overall in the 2001 WUSA Foreign Allocation Draft by Philadelphia Charge. Smith played all three seasons with Philadelphia and was named to the 2001 WUSA Global 11 All-Star Team. 2001 was her only full season in the league; in 2002, Smith missed most of the season after tearing her ACL in her right knee, and missed much of 2003 after re-injuring the same knee. Following the 2003 season, the WUSA ceased operations.\n\nSmith decided to keep playing in the United States following the collapse of the WUSA. In 2004, she played for the New Jersey Wildcats in the W-League, but she was injured yet again, breaking her leg. She ended up appearing in eight games for the club (563 minutes) and tallied eight goals and six assists.\n\nSmith returned to England and Arsenal in the fall of 2004. She officially rejoined in 2005 after being treated at the Sporting Chance clinic. However, she was yet again hampered by injury, this time by a stress fracture in her foot. She returned to action at the end of the 2004–05 season, scoring a goal from 30 metres out against Charlton Athletic L.F.C. which clinched the Premier League title for Arsenal.\n\nIn Arsenal's \"Quadruple\" winning season of 2006–07, Smith scored 30 goals in 34 games across the four competitions. However, she missed both legs of the 2006–07 UEFA Women's Cup final through suspension, after being sent off for giving the finger to opposition fans in the semi-final.\n\nDuring Smith's Arsenal career since rejoining in 2005, she appeared in 66 Premier League games scoring 73 goals, 16 FA Cup games scoring 13 goals, 10 League Cup games scoring four goals, 18 UEFA Women's Cup games scoring nine goals, and two Community Shield games scoring one goal for a total of 112 appearances and 100 goals. In her last competitive game for Arsenal, Smith scored a hat-trick to help Arsenal to a 5–0 win over Doncaster Belles in the FA Women's Premier League Cup final. She won the FA Women's Players' Player of the year in 2006 and 2007.\n\nUpon the creation of a new women's league in the United States, Women's Professional Soccer, many teams were interested in Smith's services. She was chosen by the Boston Breakers second overall in the 2008 WPS International Draft, above Marta and under only Formiga.\n\nDespite being drafted by Boston, she was still under contact with Arsenal. However, Smith decided to leave Arsenal to join Boston Breakers on 18 February 2009, one of a number of English players to join the new Women's Professional Soccer League.\n\nIn the inaugural 2009 Women's Professional Soccer season, Smith appeared in 15 games (13 starts, 1170 total minutes) and scored six goals with two assists. She was named to the WPS All-Star ballot, but was unavailable for the match due to England's participation at the European Championships. In 2010 Smith started all her 21 appearances, leading the team with 11 goals and five assists. She played in that season's All-Star game. 2011 saw Smith again afflicted by injury; she posted one goal and four assists in 10 appearances (nine starts, 850 minutes). When the WPS went on hiatus ahead of the 2012 season, Smith was left \"devastated\" and without a club.\n\nOn leaving Boston Breakers, Smith resisted offers from clubs in Sweden and Germany to join Arsenal for a third time. However, she arrived with a stress fracture acquired at the 2012 Cyprus Cup and then aggravated the injury when kicking a ball during a promotional video shoot, without the protective footwear she had been instructed to wear.\n\nSmith debuted for the England national team on 1 November 1995, three days after turning 17. The 1–1 draw against Italy was played at Roker Park and Smith won Player of the Match from her position on the left wing. She had been unable to accept a call-up to England's 1995 FIFA Women's World Cup squad that summer due to sitting her GCSE exams. Her first international goal came on the occasion of her second cap, against Croatia on 19 November 1995. Smith scored a stoppage-time penalty in England's 5–0 win at the Valley. During the following years, the English Football Association (FA) complained to FIFA when Smith's American college team refused to release her for national team duty.\n\nWhen healthy, Smith has generally been considered one of the world's top female players; former United States head coach April Heinrichs asserted that Smith would be an automatic choice for the United States Women's National Team if she had been eligible, and Vera Pauw, the Dutch coach, called Kelly \"the best player in the World\" after she scored a hat-trick against the Netherlands in a 2007 FIFA Women's World Cup qualifier. During the 2011 World Cup, Mia Hamm said of Smith: \"I remember the first time I saw Kelly play. She'd just graduated from Seton Hall. She's incredibly technical, with great speed of thought and play. Her touch is different class – everything's clean, everything's with a purpose. The pace of her passes is always perfect and she can score at will too.\" Smith's former England teammate and later coach, Hope Powell, went further than Hamm: \"Kelly is one of those players who come along only once or twice in a lifetime. In the men's game you'd think of Diego Maradona or Messi, players with a unique talent, and that’s what Kelly has.\"\n\nSmith has competed in the 2001, 2005, and 2009 editions of the UEFA Women's Championship, as well as the 2007 and 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup with England. She also played in the 2007 China Cup against the United States, Germany and China where she was named the player of the tournament. Smith was voted third in the 2009 FIFA Women's World Player of the Year, fourth in 2007 and fifth in 2006 and 2008.\n\nSmith reportedly became England's all-time record goalscorer in September 2010, when she scored her 41st international goal against Switzerland.\n\nIn 2011, Smith competed in the FIFA World Cup, where she scored from the spot in England's quarterfinal match with France, to give England a 1–0 lead in the penalty shootout (England would go on to lose the shootout 4–3). Smith, hindered by an achilles injury, was dissatisfied with her own performances at the tournament: \"I have to acknowledge that I didn't play well and I have to live with that.\" She returned to the England squad for a UEFA Women's Euro 2013 qualifying tie with Serbia after missing the first three matches of the campaign.\n\nOn 3 February 2015, Smith announced her retirement from international duty.\n\nIn June 2012 Smith was named in the 18–player Great Britain squad for the 2012 London Olympics.

His siblings Álvaro Velho Cabral, Teresa Velho Cabral, wife of Fernão Soares de Albergaria, and Violante Velho Cabral, wife of Diogo Gonçalves de Travassos also established settlements in the Azores with their families. Although referenced as \"Gonçalo Velho Cabral\" in most modern biographies, he is generally referred to as Gonçalo Velho in historical documents.\n\nIn 1431, Gonçalo Velho was in the Vila de Tancos, along the Tagus River, when he received a summons from the Prince Henry, Governor of the Order of Christ, who ordered him to depart from Sagres in a caravel, with instructions to navigate to the western sea, and to \"discover some land, [and] return with notice\". This first voyage was made to determine the location of \"islands\" first identified by the Portuguese pilot Diogo de Silves, in 1427. Although the noted chronicler Gaspar Frutuoso has attributed to Gonçalo Velho Cabral the discovery of the seven islands of the Azores, modern historiographer contest this record, limiting his discoveries to the eastern islands alone. In 1431, with less than a few days of travel, Gonçalo Velho discovered a scattering of rocky outcroppings, which he examined and were later named the \"\"Formigas\"\". He quickly returned to Sagres, probably due to bad weather.\n\nThe following year, and during the reign of his brother (King D. Duarte) the Infante, D. Henrique, founded a nautical school in the provincial village of Sagres. Gonçalo Velho Cabral was one of the mariners and monks, in the devotion to the Virgin Mary that worked for the Infante. On his orders, Cabral was sent, once again, to search the \"Ocean Sea\" to discover new territories for the Portuguese Crown, promising to name the first island to the Virgin. Gonçalo Velho Cabral scanned maps and nautical charts for days while at sea, noting the currents and wind directions, during several nights, through storms and gales in search of these \"mythical lands\" identified by the Greeks outside the Pillars of Hercules.\n\nFinally, on the morning of 15 August (the Feast day of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary), a supposedly calm, warm and clear day, the mariners and seamen could see for large distances. In the distance, though, the mate in the Crow's nest could see along the horizon a cloudy form, which progressively grew in dimensions and darkened, taken on a distinctive form. Finally, when the seaman realized beyond doubt, he yelled down to the crew, \"Terra à vista!\" (\"Land in sight!\"). As was the custom, Gonçalo Velho Cabral and his crew began their day with morning mass, benedictions and oratory to God and the Virgin Mary, to help them on their journey and to request their assistance in finding land. As the legend suggests, the seaman yelled out his discovery the crew was saying the \"Ave Maria\" and were just pronouncing \"\"Santa Maria\"\" when the cry was heard. The commander considered it a miracle and, remembering the promise he had made, named the island as Santa Maria.\n\nWith his crew he disembarked on a small beach in the north-western part of the island, which he named \"Lobos\" (later known as Ponte dos Cabestrantes) owing to the existence of many Eared seals (from the Portuguese for \"lobos-marinhos\"). As was the obligation, the Captain ordered the release of herd animals on the island for future colonization, a point that was later repeated in successive voyages through the archipelago's islands. His group circled and explored the island, examining the forested interior, before finally returning to continental Portugal. Cabral sent with him various canisters of earth and water to give the Infante, including examples of the woods unfamiliar to them in Europe.\n\nThe Infante received these \"gifts\" in 1432, and immediately ordered that herds be sent to the island, while he organized a plan. For his discovery, Gonçalo Velho was given the hereditary fief () of the island of Santa Maria. In 1432, the Infante Henry, upon receiving notice of a mystical island to the north of Santa Maria, sent orders to Gonçalo Velho to explore the waters and relate any discovery. On 3 April 1443, King Afonso V of Portugal, on the request of the Henry the Navigator, had bestowed on Gonçalo Velho the title of Commander of the Islands of the Azores. Cabral had organized a settlement of essentially familial relations, who would arrive on the island of Santa Maria in the summer of 1435. It was during Henry's encounter with Velho Cabral that notice of the discovery to the north of Santa Maria was transmitted to the Prince.\n\nOn his return, Gonçalo Velho and his crew made port in \"Praia dos Lobos\" on Santa Maria before embarking; Cabral and his Algarvean sailors eventually discovered a large island on 8 May 1444. On this first expedition, the crew ported in the small islet (today near Vila Franca do Campo) naming the large island in honour of the apparition of the archangel Michael (or \"São Miguel\". In a secondary expedition the captain investigated the northern coast of the island, before landing at the mouth of a large ravine in the southeast corner of the island, that settlers would eventually name \"Povoação Velha\" (\"old settlement\"). As with Santa Maria, he deposited herd animals on the island, and sent to Portugal tree branches, pigeons, a box of dirt and other signs of the new land. Settlement of Santa Maria and São Miguel began in earnest, and Gonçalo Velho became the Donatary-Captain of both islands (Santa Maria was settled in 1439, and colonists started arriving on São Miguel in 1444). During this period, he ordered the burning/clearing of lands and donated vast tracts of lands to family members and loyal servants, who began to cultivate wheat, raised honey-bees and planted grapevines from Crete. At the same time the Infante Henry had ordered Moorish peoples () with Cabral to immediately settle the newly discovered lands of São Miguel, who found signs of attempted earlier settlement of the island. In 1445, Cabral returned to the waters of São Miguel with nobles and settlers (bringing with them herd animals, birds, wheat and vegetables) in order to settle the island. Arriving in a period of seismic activity, his crew discovered floating pumice stone and tree trunks as arrived closer to their port. Making landfall on 29 September they encountered the Moorish settlers who, over time \"persihed\" (but likely became intermingled in the ensuing population).\n\nUnder his administration, São Miguel and Santa Maria remained a single Captaincy until 1474, when Velho Cabral sold São Miguel to Rui Gonçalves da Câmara. His sister Teresa's only child João Soares, a physician by profession, succeeded Gonçalo Velho Cabral as second Donatary-Captain of Santa Maria and São Miguel; João Soares was married twice: to Brites Godins (d. 1474), with whom they had no heirs, and later Branca de Sousa Falcão (daughter of João de Sousa Falcão, Lord de Figueiredo and Lord of the Manor de Fataúnços) whose son inherited the \"Captaincy\" of Santa Maria.\n\n"}
{"id": "2036736", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2036736", "title": "Plans (album)", "text": "Plans (album)\n\nPlans is the fifth studio album by indie rock band Death Cab for Cutie, released August 30, 2005 on Atlantic Records. \n\nThe album spawned three singles: \"Soul Meets Body\", \"Crooked Teeth\", and \"I Will Follow You into the Dark\", with all three songs charting. \"Soul Meets Body\" and \"Crooked Teeth\" reached number five and number ten, respectively, on the U.S. Alternative Songs chart. Although \"I Will Follow You into the Dark\" performed poorly in the charts compared to the previous singles, it eventually became Death Cab for Cutie's best-selling single to-date, and gained the band a nomination for a Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals the following year. \n\n\"Plans\" peaked at number four on the \"Billboard\" 200, and received platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America on February 28, 2008. The album was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album at the 48th Grammy Awards, held February 8, 2006. \n\nThe album was recorded across the period of a month at a rural farmhouse studio located in North Brookfield, Massachusetts. The location was described by lead singer Ben Gibbard, as being \"virtually in the middle of nowhere\", the sort of place \"a label sends a band if the singer's a junkie and they need to get him away from the bad things in the city\", adding the location having the advantage that the band were able to \"spread out while recording\", which Gibbard stated was \"really nice\".\n\n\"Plans\" was the first full-length album by the band not largely recorded in their native Pacific Northwest.\n\nDrummer Jason McGerr noted the continuity between \"Plans\" and the Death Cab for Cutie's previous album, \"Transatlanticism\". McGerr stated \"if \"Transatlanticism\" was an inhale, \"Plans\" is the exhale.\"\n\nIn explaining the theme of the album, Ben Gibbard stated \"I don't think there's necessarily a story, but there's definitely a theme here. One of my favorite kind of dark jokes is, 'How do you make God laugh? You make a plan.' Nobody ever makes a plan that they're gonna go out and get hit by a car. A plan almost always has a happy ending. Essentially, every plan is a tiny prayer to Father Time. I really like the idea of a plan not being seen as having definite outcomes, but more like little wishes.\"\n\n\"Plans\" received generally positive reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 66, indicating \"generally favorable reviews.\" Jonah Bayer of \"Alternative Press\" stated that \"Plans\" \"seamlessly picks up right where 2003’s \"Transatlanticism\" left off\" and praised its \"cinematic\" scope. \"The A.V. Club\"s Josh Modell wrote that the band \"wears grandiosity with grace, miniaturizing and polishing big, broad moments into tiny triumphs that, like audible illusions, feel simultaneously intimate and huge.\" David Turnbull of musicOMH deemed \"Plans\" to be \"an album of progression that is likely to win the band plenty of new fans, but it shouldn't alienate their fanbase either.\" Rhyannon Rodriguez, writing for \"Kludge\", regarded the album as \"a melodically-mellow masterpiece\" which expresses the \"absolute epitome of this generation's pop.\" While stating that \"at times, the writing feels almost too weightless\", Ann Powers, writing in \"Blender\", nonetheless contended that \"repeat listening makes these songs reliably addictive.\"\n\nIn a mixed assessment, Betty Clarke of \"The Guardian\" felt that \"Plans\" was at times \"unconvincing\", but that when Gibbard \"wrestles with big questions in smaller ways, he makes magic.\" While contending that \"Plans\" \"doesn't differ radically from the previous four\" Death Cab for Cutie albums, \"Q\" felt that \"Transatlanticism\" was a \"more cohesive\" effort. The \"NME\" wrote that the album was \"produced within an inch of its shiny, whitebread life and the Cutie seem to have lost their faux-naive subtleties, becoming the non-thinking man's Coldplay along the way\", while \"Uncut\" opined that the band's \"failure to shift pace from a relentlessly wistful chug makes for an oddly exhausting listening experience.\" Nick Sylvester of \"The Village Voice\" wrote that \"Death Cab succeed by refusing to offend\", which \"can be an admirable trait in a person, but never in a musician.\" In his Consumer Guide column for the same publication, Robert Christgau selected \"I Will Follow You into the Dark\" as a \"choice cut\", indicating a \"good song on an album that isn't worth your time or money.\"\n\n\"Stable Song\", the final track on the album, is a reworking of the song \"Stability\", originally a 12-minute-long track from \"The Stability EP\" which features songs from the limited edition and Japanese versions of 2001's \"The Photo Album\".\n\n\"Different Names for the Same Thing\" was written after a chance encounter on a train traveling rural Maryland. Ben Gibbard overheard a conversation between a red haired woman he only knew as Ashley Renee and a man. She expressed her frustration of people in her life not understanding her passions, emotions and love for life. \"The boundaries of language\" was a phrase used to explain that while people may speak the same literal language the meaning is not always understood.\n\n\n"}

When he was 18 he joined WOSH in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, later working as a DJ at WYNE (now WHBY) in Appleton, Wisconsin, then at KLIV in San Jose, California, then as the morning jock at WYBR-FM (now WXRX) in Rockford, Illinois, and then in 1980 at WOKY in Milwaukee. In February 1981, he was brought on as the KZZP morning DJ in Phoenix, Arizona, where he participated in prank phone calls and silly song parodies. In 1982, Brandmeier released his first album \"Just Havin' Fun.\"\n\nWLUP (\"The Loop\") in Chicago hired him in 1983, where his morning show was broadcast on both the AM and FM stations. He formed and performed concerts with his band, \"Johnny and the Leisure Suits\". His most memorable songs include \"We're All Crazy In Chicago\" (a local Top Ten hit), \"Hey Der Milwaukee Polka\", and \"The Moo-Moo Song\" (based on an actual event in the 1980s when a local attempted to make love to a cow in the Lincoln Park Zoo).\n\nIn April 1986, WBBM-TV aired his TV special \"Johnny B.

In 1990, he hosted two \"Jonathon Brandmeier From Chicago\" late night specials on NBC. In the summer of 1991, Viacom syndicated his \"Johnny B. on the Loose\".\n\nA management change at WLUP in 1997, however, led to the end of Brandmeier's 14-year run on The Loop. He hosted middays from 1998-2001 at WCKG in Chicago, which was replayed in Los Angeles at KLSX. After some time away from radio, he hosted mornings at KCBS-FM in 2004-05.\n\nBrandmeier returned to WLUP in fall 2005, hosting mornings until 2009. He made several appearances with his band, The Leisure Suits, on what he called \"World Tour 2007.\" This included playing bars and theaters in the Chicago area.

{"id": "2036745", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2036745", "title": "Leon Wilkeson", "text": "Leon Wilkeson\n\nLeon Russell Wilkeson (April 2, 1952 – July 27, 2001) was the bassist of Southern rock Band Lynyrd Skynyrd from 1972 until his death in 2001.\n\nBorn on April 2, 1952, in Newport, Rhode Island, but raised in Jacksonville, Florida, Wilkeson became a major Beatles fan just as he was becoming a teenager and began learning to play bass guitar in order to emulate his favorite Beatle, Paul McCartney. Wilkeson dropped out of his school band in order to focus on learning the bass at the age of 14 and shortly afterward was approached by a fellow student who told him that her brother was searching for a bassist for his band. Her brother turned out to be Ronnie Van Zant, and soon after, Wilkeson signed on with Van Zant's group, the Collegiates. However, due to plummeting school grades, Wilkeson had to drop out of the group. Soon Wilkeson found himself in another local group, the King James Version. He began to study the \"lead bass style\" of bassists such as Cream's Jack Bruce, Led Zeppelin's John Paul Jones, Jefferson Airplane's Jack Casady, The Grateful Dead's Phil Lesh and the Allman Brothers' Berry Oakley. By the early 1970s, Wilkeson was becoming one of Jacksonville's top bassists. When Lynyrd Skynyrd's bassist Greg T. Walker left the band, Wilkeson was brought in as his replacement. For a short time, Wilkeson worked at a dairy plant, Farm Best Dairy in Jacksonville, during which on an interview he laughed that he \"got paid every two weeks and got all the ice cream he could eat\".\n\nLynyrd Skynyrd signed with Al Kooper's production company, Sounds of the South, a joint venture with MCA Records, in 1973. Wilkeson returned to Jacksonville and his regular job stocking ice cream at Farmbest Dairy Products. Former Strawberry Alarm Clock lead guitarist Ed King replaced Wilkeson during the recording of Skynyrd's debut album, \"Pronounced Leh-Nerd Skin-Nerd\", but just as sessions wrapped up, King and vocalist Ronnie Van Zant both agreed that King wasn't suited to be a bassist. Van Zant subsequently visited Wilkeson and convinced him to rejoin the band, and King moved to lead guitar.\n\nWith its outlaw image, tough Southern rock, and solid touring, Skynyrd quickly became one of the top bands of the 1970s, scoring such hit albums as 1974's \"Second Helping\", 1975's \"Nuthin' Fancy\", 1976's \"Gimme Back My Bullets\" and \"One More from the Road\", plus 1977's \"Street Survivors\" and such hit singles as \"Free Bird\" and \"Sweet Home Alabama.\" It was also during this time that Wilkeson picked up the gimmick of wearing colorful hats onstage, garnering the nickname \"Mad Hatter.\"\n\nWilkeson acquired a \"Fenderbird\" bass from John Entwistle. The Fenderbird bass mated a custom made Gibson Thunderbird body to a Fender Precision Bass neck. Wilkeson can be seen playing this bass in a 1975 Lynyrd Skynyrd performance on the British TV series \"The Old Grey Whistle Test\".\n\nThe band and its entourage went down in a plane crash on October 20, 1977, outside of Gillsburg, Mississippi, which left members Ronnie Van Zant, Steve Gaines and Cassie Gaines dead and the rest suffering severe lacerations, broken bones and various internal injuries. Wilkeson was seated next to Steve Gaines, and both were thrown face first into a bulkhead at high speed while still strapped in their airline seats: he awoke to find Gaines dead from a broken neck and himself severely injured. At the hospital, he was found to have suffered a closed double fracture of his left leg, a severe double compound fracture of his left arm, 6 broken ribs (one of which was an internal compound fracture which punctured and deflated his left lung), upper/lower jaw/nose/facial bones extensively smashed and 15 teeth (basically all of his teeth except the molars) knocked out. The injury to his left arm was most concerning, as the dirty water of the swamp had already extensively contaminated his open wounds and the additional surgery he would need to rebuild his face and arm with steel plates would raise his risk of infection even further; although his hands survived intact, Wilkeson's fretting arm suffered extensive nerve damage, was nearly amputated and left him with only a minimal range of motion from then on. This forced him to hold his bass close to his body and at a distinctive near-vertical orientation when he returned to music three years later, and he never recovered his original dexterity on the instrument.\n\nAfter the crash, Wilkeson and the other survivors bowed out of the spotlight for the remainder of the 1970s as they attempted to put their lives back together. Wilkeson did manage to lay down bass parts for a release by Jacksonville band Alias, whose debut album, \"Contraband,\" was released in 1979 on Mercury. The 1980s appeared to bring great promise for most of the surviving band members, as a new group, the Rossington-Collins Band, formed, consisting of Wilkeson, guitarists Gary Rossington and Allen Collins, and keyboardist Billy Powell.\n\nThe Rossington-Collins Band got off to a good start, as their 1980 debut, '\"Anytime, Anyplace, Anywhere,\" became a modest hit. But shortly after the release of their second album, 1982's \"This Is the Way\", the band split up. Wilkeson opted to remain with Collins in a new venture, The Allen Collins Band, issuing one album in 1983, \"Here, There and Back\". After the Allen Collins Band fizzled, little was heard from Wilkeson during the mid-1980s, except for a short-lived membership with Rocco Marshall's Christian-rock band Vision, which also included Billy Powell. But in 1987, Wilkeson and Powell signed on with a reunited version of Skynyrd, with Ronnie Van Zant's youngest brother, Johnny, performing lead vocals. The group embarked on a successful, sold-out tour. The new Skynyrd continued to tour and release albums on a regular basis.\n\nWilkeson died in his sleep on July 27, 2001, at age 49 at the Sawgrass Marriott Resort & Beach Club in Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida. He was pronounced dead by St Johns County Fire Rescue Paramedic Charlie Galambos. Galambos reports that leaving the scene moments after pronouncing Wilkeson dead, news had already leaked to the media, as he listened to the report on local FM radio. Wilkeson was in town to address charges of driving under the influence, for which he was cited earlier in 2001. A medical examiner reported that Wilkeson was suffering from chronic liver and lung disease and died of natural causes. Wilkeson's death put the group in a difficult position since an agreement with Ronnie Van Zant's widow, Judy Jenness, mandated that at least three of Skynyrd's longtime members would have to appear in order for the band to use the name Lynyrd Skynyrd. Jenness waived this proviso, and the group continued with replacement bassist Ean Evans.\n\nLynyrd Skynyrd dedicated the song \"Mad Hatter\" from their 2003 album \"Vicious Cycle\" to Wilkeson's memory.\n\n"}

It was developed by Joymania Entertainment (since changed to Joymania Development) and published by TopWare Interactive in 1998. The player takes the role of the captain of the palace guards and leads the soldiers and citizens to victory. An expansion pack was released in 2001, titled \"Knights and Merchants: The Peasants Rebellion\".\n\n\"Knights and Merchants: The Shattered Kingdom\" has a single-player campaign that consists of 20 scenarios with scenario length ranging from around 5 minutes up to 7 hours or more depending on difficulty.\n\nThe game offers a multiplayer mode by using either IPX, TCP/IP or Modem where up to 6 players can play. There are 10 different scenarios to choose from including a number which focus specifically on the combat element of the game.\n\n\"Knights and Merchants\" recreates the era of the Middle Ages. Apart from the purely fictitious geography of the world, all game elements and scenes are based on the European, but more particularly, the Anglo-Saxon period, around 1200 A.D.\n\nThe economy is very complex in \"Knights and Merchants: The Shattered Kingdom\", more so than most other RTS games, with a greater range of resources and a need to combine basic resources in a number of ways to create a functioning economy. For example, in order to get loaves of bread, the player is required to first build a farm to get wheat, a mill to get flour and a bakery to bake loaves of the flour. The many different resources in the game require a large amount of corresponding buildings and units in order to fully utilize them requiring greater than usual micromanaging for an RTS.\n\nEvery citizen and soldier must eat in the game meaning that the player needs to produce a great deal of food creating a more naturalistic limit on army size. There is no population limit in-game, instead population is limited by how much food is produced. If a unit is not fed for a sustained amount of time it will die.\n\nThe everyday life aspect of is considered a notable feature. Many different structures can be placed, forcing the player to consider where and when to place each structure, this is also dependent on terrain and territory. However, for new players this greater complexity can lead to a process of trial and error but once experience has been gained it becomes an interesting take on RTS economics.\n\n\"Knights and Merchants: The Peasants Rebellion\" is a standalone expansion pack. It includes the 20 original missions as well as a brand new campaign that consists of 14 missions, a scenario mode with 10 different scenarios, and new buildings and units. The game was released in 2001 for Windows, but only in a few countries. Later in 2002 it was released in additional countries and in 2005 it was finally released in the U.S.\n\nThe game's tech tree is simple and straightforward, and most new technology is accessed upon new building completion. To begin, the player can only build a school house that trains basic workers, but as the game advances more buildings and units become available. When playing a scenario or multiplayer mode, the player's technological advancement is not restricted, however in the single-player campaign some buildings cannot be built until the player progresses to later missions. The AI always begins with a technological advantage against the player, allowing them to develop at a higher level.\n\nThe economy in \"The Peasants Rebellion\" is complex, stemming from the game's variety of resources, ranging from wood and stone, to sausages and wine. Many resources need to be transported to other buildings to be refined, and then delivered - which presents the challenge of building placement and interconnecting (every building has to be connected by roads) as the player develops.\n\nThe citizens in \"The Peasants Rebellion\" get hungry - from workers, to farmers, to soldiers. This creates a challenging dynamic for the player - between managing combat, resource gathering, city building, as well as making sure there is a stable food supply for all the units. Unlike many other RTS games, \"Knights and Merchants: The Peasants Rebellion\" has no unit cap - aside from limited map size and hunger features, which help to limit the player's sustainable unit numbers.\n\n\"Next Generation\" reviewed the PC version of the game, rating it four stars out of five, and stated that \"\"Knights\" may not break much new ground, but it follow prior footprints with style. So if you're tired of battling aliens, Orcs, and the villains of Nod, it's a nice little alternative.\"\n\n"}

The aircraft was built as a \"workhorse\" intended for use as a passenger or cargo aircraft. It was available with wheels, floats or skis. The aircraft was powered by either a Wright Cyclone or Pratt and Whitney Hornet engine. The Airbus and Aircruiser served as both commercial and military transports.\n\nThe first Bellanca Airbus was built in 1930 as the P-100. An efficient design, it was capable of carrying 12 to 14 passengers depending on the cabin interior configuration, with later versions carrying up to 15. In 1931, test pilot George Haldeman flew the P-100 a distance of 4,400 miles in a time aloft of 35 hours. Although efficient, with a cost per mile figure of eight cents per mile calculated for that flight, the first Airbus did not sell due to its water-cooled engine.\n\nThe next model, the P-200 Airbus, was powered by a larger, more reliable air-cooled engine. One version (P-200-A) came with floats and operated as a ferry service in New York City, flying between Wall Street and the East River. Other versions included a P-200 Deluxe model, with custom interiors and seating for nine. The P-300 was designed to carry 15 passengers. The final model, the \"Aircruiser,\" was the most efficient aircraft of its day, and would rank high amongst all aircraft designs. With a Wright Cyclone air-cooled supercharged radial engine rated at 715 hp, the Aircruiser could carry a useful load greater than its empty weight. In the mid-1930s, the Aircruiser could carry 4,000 lb payloads at a speed of between 145 and 155 mph, a performance that multi-engine Fokkers and Ford Trimotors could not come close to matching.\n\nIn 1934, United States federal regulations prohibited single-engine transports on United States airlines, virtually eliminating future markets for the Aircruiser. Where the workhorse capabilities of the Aircruiser stood out was in Canada. Several of \"The Flying Ws\", as it was commonly dubbed in Canada, were used in northern mining operations, ferrying ore, supplies and the occasional passenger, into the 1970s.\n\n\n\n\nThe last flying Aircruiser, \"CF-BTW,\" a 1938 model, after serving in Manitoba, is now on display at the Erickson Aircraft Collection in Madras, Oregon.\n\nAnother Bellanca Aircruiser, \"CF-AWR\" named the \"Eldorado Radium Silver Express\", built in 1935, is under restoration at the Western Canada Aviation Museum in Winnipeg, Manitoba.\n\n"}

The station is owned & operated by Educational Media Foundation and carries network programming from K-LOVE, EMF's main contemporary Christian music network. The station's broadcast tower is located atop the John Hancock Center.\n\nThe station was first granted a construction permit on April 7, 1942 with the W83C call sign, licensed to broadcast at 48.3 MHz on the original 42-50 MHz FM broadcast band. The station was owned by Richard W. Hoffman, who also owned WHFC. Its studios and transmitter were initially located at the Medinah Athletic Club building at 505 N. Michigan Avenue, but were moved to the Bankers Building at 105 West Adams by 1945.\n\nOn November 1, 1943, the station was assigned the WEHS call sign, and it was granted its first license on October 8, 1945. The callsign stood for \"Elizabeth Hoffman's Station\", named for owner Richard Hoffman's mother. In January 1946, the station received permission from the FCC to go silent to convert to operation on the new 88-108 MHz FM broadcast band, which the FCC had created on June 27, 1945. On July 31, 1946, the station was reassigned to 100.1 MHz, and then granted a move to 97.9 MHz on September 23, 1947. WEHS was the first commercial radio station to air \"storecasts\". It broadcast background music for National Tea grocery stores in the Chicago area. When the contract with National ran out in the mid-1950s, WEHS simulcast the foreign language and black programming of co-owned WHFC for six hours a day, the minimum broadcast time to keep the license. In 1952, WEHS's studios and transmitter were moved to WHFC's studio and transmitter site at 3350 S. Kedzie.\n\nL & P Broadcasting Corporation purchased WEHS in February 1963, along with WHFC, for $1 million. The Chess family of Chess, Checker and Cadet Records fame owned L & P Broadcasting (the \"L\" stood for Leonard Chess while the \"P\" stood for brother Phil Chess). Leonard primarily ran the record labels and recording studio while brother Phil was president of the radio company. The WHFC call sign was moved to WEHS on March 3, 1963, while WHFC was assigned the WVON (\"The Voice of the Negro\") call sign. WHFC aired an R&B format and simulcast WVON 24 hours a day.\n\nOn March 8, 1965, WHFC's call sign was changed to WSDM, which stood for \"Smack Dab in the Middle\", in reference to the station's position at the middle of the FM dial. The station was also known as \"the station with the girls and all that jazz\", as it featured all female DJs known as \"Den Pals\", which included Yvonne Daniels, Cody Sweet, Penny Lane, Nancy Plum, Connie Szerszen, known on the air as \"Dawn\", and Linda Ellerbee, known on the air as \"Hush Puppy\". WSDM played \"pop-oriented jazz and jazz oriented pop\". Program director was Mickey Shorr and later Burt Burdeen.\n\nIn 1968, the station began airing a nighttime progressive rock program called \"Underground Den\" on weekends. In early 1971, WSDM began to mix rock music with its light jazz. The station positioned itself as \"jazzed up rock\". Ownership of the station was transferred to Phil Chess effective October 22, 1971. Phil Chess' son, Terry Chess, was general manager. In 1972, WSDM's transmitter was moved to the John Hancock Center. Cindy Morgan was a DJ on the station in the 1970s.\n\nThe call sign was changed to WLUP on March 14, 1977. The station adopted an AOR format and was rebranded as \"The Loop\", referring to the nickname of Chicago's central business district. J. Blackburn was Program Director and Tom O'Toole served as the station's first morning host and was the first Loop DJ to sign on the air. The first song O'Toole played on \"The Loop\" was \"Morning Has Broken\" by Cat Stevens. The original Loop air staff included O'Toole in mornings, Captain Billy Martin in middays, Les Tracy in afternoon drive, and Bob Shannon evenings. Other early Loop DJs included Greg Budell, Ford Colley, Don Davis, and Glory-June Greaif.\n\nHeftel Broadcasting Corporation, owned by Hawaiian Congressman Cecil Heftel, purchased the station effective March 5, 1979, for $3 million. Lee Abrams was hired as consultant. The rock format was kept in place, but emphasis was put on harder-edged rock. Jesse Bullit was the program director. Steve Dahl, who had been unemployed since WDAI (94.7) went to a disco format in December 1978 – and who would stage one of the most famous promotions in sports history, Disco Demolition Night – was hired for mornings in spring of 1979. Garry Meier, known over the air at the time as \"Matthew Meier\", was an overnight DJ, and was later teamed with Dahl as the morning newsman. Soon thereafter, Meier became Steve's full-time sidekick, and used his real name, Garry Meier.\n\nIn 1979, Jeff Schwartz became head of sales and Mitch Michaels was hired as afternoon DJ. Michaels became program director shortly thereafter. Sky Daniels was also hired in 1979, and served as disc jockey and music director. Chuck Swirsky provided sports reports for a period in the early 1980s. Buzz Killman was newsman. Steve and Garry were fired in 1981 for \"violating community standards\". A series of morning men including Matt Bisbee, Mark McEwen, and the team of R.J. Harris and Pat Still tried their hand until Jonathon Brandmeier was hired in late 1982. Kilman remained as newsman, and Bruce Wolf joined the station as a sports reporter in 1982. Greg Solk became program director in 1983. Dr. Demento was carried on WLUP from 1985 through 2010, just prior to when Dr. Demento ceased over-the-air broadcasting. Steve and Garry returned in 1986 to host afternoons.\n\nIn late December 1986, Heftel Broadcasting merged with Statewide Broadcasting, owner of AM 1000 WCFL. In April 1987, WCFL became WLUP, and the FM station was assigned the WLUP-FM call sign. AM 1000 WLUP became a partial simulcast of WLUP-FM, and Steve and Garry moved to AM 1000. In 1988, WLUP-FM and WLUP AM 1000 were sold to the newly formed Evergreen Media. By 1989, the AM station would evolve to mostly talk with a few rock songs mixed in per hour.\n\nIn the early 1990s, WLUP aired a popular television commercial featuring a fat man dubbed \"Joey Bag O' Donuts\" dancing. In the time span since the original commercial was aired, the footage of the dancing fat man in the commercial has been used by numerous other radio stations across the country and abroad.\n\nIn September 1992, Steve and Garry returned to mornings on WLUP-FM. In September 1993, the pairing of Steve Dahl and Garry Meier broke up. Shortly thereafter, Dahl moved to AM 1000, which had recently added ESPN sports programming and changed call letters to WMVP.\n\nOn September 27, 1993, the station's lineup was overhauled, and it shifted towards a hot talk format. Garry Meier moved to middays on WLUP-FM, Brandmeier would move to afternoons, and Kevin Matthews moved to mornings for a time (though Brandmeier would later move back to mornings, and Matthews would move to middays). Danny Bonaduce hosted evenings, Ed Schwartz hosted overnights, and Seka hosted a program Saturday evenings. Liz Wilde was hired to host evenings in March 1995, but her show was cancelled by November of the same year. In February 1996, sister station WYNY in New York simulcasted WLUP for a day as part of a week-long stunt of simulcasting sister stations nationwide before flipping formats to rhythmic adult contemporary as WKTU. In June 1996, AM 1000 WMVP dropped their sports format and returned to simulcasting WLUP.\n\nWLUP switched to a format featuring a \"blend of pop rock, pop alternative, and adult alternative\" music on September 30, 1996. In 1997, Evergreen and Chancellor Media merged. In order to stay under federally mandated ownership limits, Evergreen opted to sell WLUP to Bonneville in July. On July 21 at 5 AM, after stunting with all-Who songs as part of a Who concert that previous weekend, WLUP switched back to a rock format. The first song under the relaunched \"Loop\" was \"Rock and Roll\" by Led Zeppelin. Also that month, Jonathon Brandmeier would be released from the station due to the ownership change. In June 1998, WLUP shifted to classic rock and adopted the slogan, \"Classic Rock That Really Rocks\". During this period, full-time on air personalities included Byrd, Steve Downes, Eddie Webb, Pete McMurray, Seaver, Cara Carriveau, Sari, and Mark Zander.\n\nIn October 2004, Emmis Communications traded three of their stations in Phoenix to Bonneville for WLUP-FM and $70 million; the swap was completed in December of that year. While under Emmis ownership, WLUP evolved into a mainstream rock format, but in 2011 it returned to a classic rock format.\n\nIn 2005, Emmis brought back Jonathon Brandmeier to do mornings on The Loop and hired Zakk Tyler to host afternoon drive. Erin Carmen began hosting middays in 2006, remaining with the station until 2009. Brandmeier also exited WLUP in 2009.\n\nOn January 15, 2007, Chicago's NBC owned and operated station, WMAQ-TV channel 5, began a new weekday morning show called \"Barely Today\" which aired from 4:30–5 a.m. The new morning show was simulcast on WLUP-FM and hosted by Bruce Wolf, who was the former weekday morning traffic/sports anchor for WMAQ. The show would be cancelled five months later due to poor ratings.\n\nOn June 21, 2011, Emmis announced that it would sell WKQX, sister station WLUP-FM, and New York's WRXP to Merlin Media, a group headed by former Tribune Company executive Randy Michaels. Emmis, who would retain a minority stake in Merlin Media, would grant Merlin a local marketing agreement to operate WKQX and WLUP-FM from July 15 until the sale to Merlin officially closed on September 1.\n\nOn May 3, 2012, Merlin added a satellite-fed version of the smooth jazz format on WLUP's HD3 subchannel (97.9-HD3).\n\nRadio personality and WEBN alum Maxwell Slater \"Max\" Logan (Benjamin Bornstein), best known for his years as host of \"The Maxwell Show\" at WMMS and WNCX in Cleveland, took over as the WLUP-FM morning host on July 30, 2012. Former personality Zakk Tyler (Dominic Zaccagnini) also returned.\n\nOn January 3, 2014, Merlin Media announced a local marketing agreement (LMA) with Cumulus Media that would see Cumulus take over operations of WLUP-FM and sister station WIQI as well as inherit Merlin's LMA for WKQX-LP. The deal included an option for Cumulus to purchase the stations from Merlin. The deal saw Merlin relinquish operations of its last remaining radio stations. The deal also sees an expansion of Cumulus' Chicago reach; the company already owns and operates news/talk station WLS (890 AM) and classic hits station WLS-FM (94.7).\n\nOn September 12, 2014, WLUP released morning hosts Maxwell (Benjamin Bornstein) and John Czahor and afternoon host Patrick Capone. On September 15, 2014, a new weekday lineup was announced, with Lyndsey Marie hosting middays, Tim Virgin hosting afternoons, and Pyke hosting evenings. Virgin previously worked at The Loop in the mid-'90s. Mornings remained open. On March 30, 2015, Mancow Muller joined WLUP as its new morning show host.\n\nWLUP's first ever Rock Girl, Lorelei Shark, was the official spokesperson and the face of The Loop in the late 1970s and 1980s. In 2005, the Loop Rock Girl was reintroduced, with Erica Gustafson being the new holder of the title. The current Loop Rock Girl is April Rose Haydock, who was also the Loop Rock Girl in 2007.\n\nIn January 2018, as part of Cumulus Media's bankruptcy proceedings, the company requested that a U.S. Bankruptcy Court release the company from several \"extremely unprofitable\" contracts, including its LMAs with WLUP-FM and WKQX. Cumulus stated that under the agreement, which carries a monthly fee of $600,000, the company had lost $8.4 million on the two Merlin stations.\n\nOn March 5, 2018, Merlin Media sold WLUP-FM to Educational Media Foundation for $21.5 million, who would convert the station to non-commercial status. The sale was prompted by Cumulus Media's Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing, in which it was determined that Cumulus would not proceed with the existing LMA or a sale of WLUP-FM from Merlin to Cumulus. The move gives EMF its second full-power outlet in Chicago; the organization also owns translators and lower-power stations in the market. On March 6, Cumulus ended manned operations on WLUP-FM and the entire air staff was dismissed; however, the Mancow show continued via its independent online streaming platform. An automated playlist of music continued until March 10 at midnight, when EMF took control of the frequency from Merlin under a new LMA and assumed the K-Love schedule carried by future sister station WJKL (94.3). EMF also retained the WLUP-FM call sign, warehousing it on an existing station in Starke, Florida (near Gainesville) which held the WCKL-FM call sign; that call sign was in turn transferred to the Chicago station on March 12, 2018, to stand for \"Chicago's K-Love\". Merlin retained the \"Loop\" intellectual property and related properties, and transitioned that branding to WKQX-HD2 in a fully automated form.\n\nThe sale of WLUP-FM also ended the annual \"Loopfest\", a sponsored event that was planned for August 3, 2018 at Hollywood Casino Amphitheatre, with Lynyrd Skynyrd to support their final tour with .38 Special and the Marshall Tucker Band. WLUP-FM informed listeners who bought tickets that the event was canceled immediately after the station announced it the previous February, despite leaving event details on its website while not indicating who may take over the sponsorship.\n\nUpon hearing the news of the sale, Steve Dahl pointed to WLUP-FM's legacy and heritage, saying:\n\nOn March 9, 2018, Dahl gave listeners a chance to say goodbye to WLUP-FM via a simulcast of his afternoon program on WLS. Dahl also brought back alumni Sky Daniels and Kevin Matthews to help give WLUP-FM a proper send off, while WDRV paid homage to the station with a day long tribute led by Bob Stroud, another WLUP-FM veteran, with guests and surprises. WGN's 'Dave Plier Show' also aired a reunion of ex-WLUP-FM DJs, including Kevin Matthews, current WGN hosts Wendy Snyder and Bill Leff, and broadcast executive Larry Wert, paying tribute to its legacy.\n\nThe LMA with EMF took effect March 10, 2018 at midnight, at which point The Loop switched to K-Love. In a last jab at the impending transition to Christian music, WLUP-FM closed by playing \"Shout at the Devil\" by Mötley Crüe, \"The Number of the Beast\" by Iron Maiden, and (as Dahl suggested) \"Highway to Hell\". The first song played on WLUP-FM as K-Love was \"Whom Shall I Fear\" by Chris Tomlin. EMF also took the station's HD Radio digital signal off the air, resulting in not only the loss of the digital simulcast of the analog FM signal, but also the digital subchannels airing automated stand-up comedy programming and smooth jazz/soft adult contemporary music, effectively leaving the latter format's only presence in the Chicago market over-the-air on WKSC-HD2 and WTMX-HD2.\n\nOn January 16, 2020, EMF changed the station's call sign from WCKL-FM to WCKL.\n\n"}

He is credited as the discoverer of Ascension and Saint Helena islands.\n\nThe Juan de Nova Island, in the Mozambique Channel, is named after him. The Farquhar atoll (in the Seychelles) was, for a long time, known as the João da Nova islands. It is sometimes thought that the Agaléga islands (in the Indian Ocean) was also named after him (although it is almost certain he never visited them).\n\nJuan da Nova was born into a noble family in Maceda, Galicia, then a constituent kingdom of the Crown of Castile. Nova was sent by his family to Portugal, where he grew up, to escape the struggles between aristocratic factions known as the Irmandiño wars. In Portugal, he was also known as \"João Galego\" (\"the Galician\"). In 1496, he was appointed as \"Alcaide menor\" (Mayor) of Lisbon by king Manuel I.\n\nOn 9 or 10 March 1501, João da Nova departed as commander of the third Portuguese expedition to India, leading a small four vessel fleet under a joint private initiative of Florentine Bartolomeo Marchionni and Portuguese D. Álvaro of Braganza. On the outward leg of this expedition, in May 1501, Nova is believed to have sighted Ascension Island in the South Atlantic. After doubling the Cape, he is said to also have discovered what has since been called Juan de Nova Island in the Mozambique Channel. \n\nArriving in India, Nova established a \"feitoria\" (trading post) in Cannanore and left behind a factor (on behalf of the private Marchionni-Braganza consortium, not the Portuguese crown). On December 31, 1501, João da Nova's little fleet engaged the fleet of the Zamorin of Calicut in a battle outside of Cannanore harbor, the first Portuguese naval battle in the Indian Ocean. Some historians have conjectured that Nova (or one of his captains) might also have visited the island of Ceylon at some point on this trip, four years before the first officially documented Portuguese visit by D. Lourenço de Almeida in 1505-6.\n\nNova's armada left India in January 1502. On his return journey, Nova is said to have discovered the South Atlantic island of Saint Helena on 21 May 1502, the feast day of Helena of Constantinople. However, a paper published in 2015 reviewed the discovery date and suggests Jan Huyghen van Linschoten was probably the first (in 1596) to state that the island was so named because it was found on the 21 May. Given that Linschoten correctly stated Whitsunday fell on the Western Christian date of 21 May 1589 (rather than the Orthodox Church date of 28 May), the paper suggests that Linschoten was referring to the Protestant feast-day for Saint Helena on 21 May, not the Orthodox Church version on the same date. It is then argued the Portuguese found the island two decades before the start of the Reformation and the establishment of Protestantism, and it is therefore not possible that the island was so named because it was found on the Protestant feast day. An alternative discovery date of 3 May on the Catholic feast-day celebrating the finding of the True Cross by Saint Helena in Jerusalem, as quoted by Odoardo Duarte Lopes in 1591 and by Sir Thomas Herbert in 1638, is suggested as historically more credible than the Protestant date of 21 May. The paper observes that if da Nova made the discovery on 3 May 1502, he may have been inhibited from naming the island Ilha de Vera Cruz (Island of the True Cross) because Pedro Álvares Cabral had already assigned that same name to the Brazilian coastline, which he thought to be a large island, on 3 May 1500. News of Cabral’s discovery reached Lisbon directly from South America before da Nova’s fleet set off on the voyage to India in 1501. If da Nova knew the True Cross name had already been assigned, the most obvious and plausible alternative name for him to give the island was \"Santa Helena\".\n\nOn 5 March 1505, he undertook another voyage to India as captain of the \"Flor de la Mar\" in the 7th Portuguese India armada commanded by Francisco de Almeida, the first Portuguese Viceroy of India. Nova had been granted credentials by the king entitling him to be Captain-Major () of the Indian coast fleet if suitable. In East Africa, the armada captured Kilwa (in which event Nova played a critical role relaying secret missives between Almeida and local pretender Muhammad Arcone) and proceeded to raid Mombassa.\nAfter crossing the Indian Ocean, the armada spent some time erecting forts and raiding ports, before eventually arriving at Cochin in October. There D. Francisco de Almeida inaugurated his term as Viceroy of Portuguese India, but refused to allow João da Nova to invoke his credentials as Captain-Major of the Indian coastal patrol. Almeida claimed that the \"Flor de la Mar\" was too large to enter the Indian coastal inlets and lagoons and thus unsuitable as a patrol ship. Almeida offered João da Nova the option of switching to a caravel, and sending the \"Flor\" back under another captain, but Nova chose to bring her back to Lisbon himself. Almeida then appointed his own son, Lourenço de Almeida, as captain-major of the patrol.\n\nLeaving India in February 1506, Nova's heavy-laden \"Flor de la Mar\", developed a leak in the hull in the environs of Zanzibar and was forced to stop for repairs in the islands of the Mozambique Channel. He would spend the next eight months in the area repairing the ship, a delay prolonged by illness and contrary winds.\n\nHe was still stranded with his leaky ship in February, 1507, when the 8th Armada, under command of Tristão da Cunha, arrived in Mozambique Island. Cunha helped complete the repairs, transferred its cargo to a Lisbon-bound transport, and annexed Nova and the \"Flor de la Mar\" into his own India-bound fleet.\n\nJoão da Nova took part in the Portuguese capture of Socotra in August 1507. Much to his surprise, he was assigned to remain in Socotra with the Red Sea patrol, a detachment of six ships under D. Afonso de Albuquerque's command, rather than continue with Cunha on to India. But his presence in the Red Sea patrol turned out to be a disturbance to Albuquerque, even if his exact role in the subsequent \"mutiny of the captains\" may have been somewhat murky. Besides his own frustrations, Nova regaled fellow patrol captains with tales of Indian riches, a much more attractive option than the barren coasts of Arabia they were assigned to patrol. In August–September, 1507, Albuquerque led his little squad into the Gulf of Oman and began to raid a series of coastal cities in succession - Qalhat, Qurayyat, Muscat - signalling his intention to proceed in this manner all the way up the Arabian coast and across to the island of Hormuz. The patrol captains, who were lured to the East Indies with dreams of quick and easy riches, balked at the prospect of a tiring succession of profitless, dangerous fights with insufficient men-at-arms. After Muscat, the exhausted João da Nova submitted a formal request to Albuquerque for permission to leave the patrol and proceed to India (ostensibly to request reinforcements from the viceroy Almeida). When this was denied, Nova protested and was placed under arrest. He was later pardoned and released, as his command was needed for the Battle of Hormuz in October, 1507.\n\nShortly after the battle, Nova once again was at the center of a renewed series of complaints, this time over the establishment of a fortress in the city of Hormuz. In early 1508, during the construction of the fortress, three of the patrol ships slipped away from Albuquerque's sight and set sail to India, intending to lodge formal complaints against Albuquerque with the vice-roy Francisco de Almeida in Cochin. João da Nova was not among them, but Albuquerque nonetheless decided to let him go as well, hoping that by this belated magnanimous gesture, Nova might argue on his behalf. He didn't. Once in Cochin, João da Nova joined the three other captains in opening a formal case against Albuquerque.\n\nJoão da Nova fought in the Battle of Diu in February 1509, his ship, the \"Flor de la Mar\", being used by the vice-roy Francisco de Almeida as the flagship of the Portuguese battle fleet. In March of that year, Afonso de Albuquerque, by then in Cochin himself, invoked his own secret credentials to relieve Francisco de Almeida as governor of India. But João da Nova, along with the other captains, assembled a petition demanding that Almeida refused to yield it, characterizing Albuquerque as unfit to govern. In May of the same year, Almeida formally opened a council in Cochin to consider the reception of Albuquerque. Nova and the other patrol captains presented the case against him.\n\nJoão da Nova died shortly after, in July 1509, just a couple of weeks before Almeida delivered the indictment and ordered Albuquerque's arrest. In spite of all this, Albuquerque is said to have personally paid for Nova's funeral in memory of his achievements in the Hormuz campaign.\n\n"}

{"id": "2036817", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2036817", "title": "Caveolin", "text": "Caveolin\n\nIn molecular biology, caveolins are a family of integral membrane proteins that are the principal components of caveolae membranes and involved in receptor-independent endocytosis. Caveolins may act as scaffolding proteins within caveolar membranes by compartmentalizing and concentrating signaling molecules. They also induce positive (inward) membrane curvature by way of oligomerization, and hairpin insertion. Various classes of signaling molecules, including G-protein subunits, receptor and non-receptor tyrosine kinases, endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), and small GTPases, bind Cav-1 through its 'caveolin-scaffolding domain'.\n\nThe caveolin gene family has three members in vertebrates: CAV1, CAV2, and CAV3, coding for the proteins caveolin-1, caveolin-2, and caveolin-3, respectively. All three members are membrane proteins with similar structure. Caveolin forms oligomers and associates with cholesterol and sphingolipids in certain areas of the cell membrane, leading to the formation of caveolae.\n\nThe caveolins are similar in structure. They all form hairpin loops that are inserted into the cell membrane. Both the C-terminus and the N-terminus face the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. There are two isoforms of caveolin-1: caveolin-1α and caveolin-1β, the latter lacking a part of the N-terminus.\n\nCaveolins are found in the majority of adherent, mammalian cells. \n\nThe functions of caveolins are still under intensive investigation. They are best known for their role in the formation of 50-nanometer-size invaginations of the plasma membrane, called caveolae. Oligomers of caveolin form the coat of these domains. Cells that lack caveolins also lack caveolae. Many functions are ascribed to these domains, ranging from endocytosis and transcytosis to signal transduction.\n\nCaveolin-1 has also been shown to play a role in the integrin signaling. The tyrosine phosphorylated form of caveolin-1 colocalizes with focal adhesions, suggesting a role for caveolin-1 in migration. Indeed, downregulation of caveolin-1 leads to less efficient migration in vitro.\n\nGenetically engineered mice that lack caveolin-1 and caveolin-2 are viable and fertile, showing that neither the caveolins nor the caveolae are essential in embryonic development or reproduction of these animals. However, knock-out animals do develop abnormal, hypertrophic lungs, and cardiac myopathy, leading to a reduction in lifespan. Mice lacking caveolins also suffer from impaired angiogenic responses as well as abnormal responses to vasoconstrictive stimuli. In zebrafish, lack of caveolins leads to embryonic lethality, suggesting that higher vertebrates (as exemplified by mice) have developed compensation or redundancy for the functions of caveolins.\n\nCaveolins have a paradoxical role in the development of this disease. They have been implicated in both tumor suppression and oncogenesis. High expression of caveolins leads to inhibition of cancer-related pathways, such as growth factor signaling pathways. However, certain cancer cells that express caveolins have been shown to be more aggressive and metastatic, because of a potential for anchorage-independent growth.\n\nCaveolins are thought to play an important role during the development of atherosclerosis. Furthermore, caveolin-3 has been associated with long QT syndrome.\n\nCaveolin-3 has been implicated in the development of certain types of muscular dystrophy (limb-girdle muscular dystrophy).\n\n"}

The fleet reached Massawa on 12 February, where Gama left a number of ships and continued north. Reaching Suez, he discovered that the Ottomans had long had intelligence of his raid, and foiled his attempt to burn their beached ships. Gama was forced to retrace his steps to Massawa, although pausing to attack the port of El-Tor on the Sinai Peninsula.\n\nOnce back at Massawa, Gama found the men he had left were restless and convinced by the self-described patriarch João Bermudes that they should provide military assistance to the beleaguered Emperor of Ethiopia.

{"id": "2036836", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2036836", "title": "Milt Gabler", "text": "Milt Gabler\n\nMilton Gabler (May 20, 1911 – July 20, 2001) was an American record producer, responsible for many innovations in the recording industry of the 20th century.\n\nGabler was born to a Jewish family in Harlem, New York, the son of Susie (née Kasindorf) and Julius Gabler. His father was an Austrian Jewish immigrant (from Vienna), and his mother's family were Jewish immigrants from Russia (including Rostov). At 15, he began working in his father's business, the Commodore Radio Corporation, a radio shop located on East 42nd Street in New York City.\n\nBy the mid-1930s, Gabler renamed the business the Commodore Music Shop, and it became a focal point for jazz fans and musicians alike. In 1933 Gabler began buying up unwanted copies of recordings from the record companies and resold them, making him the first person to deal in reissues, the first to sell records by mail order, and also the first to credit all the musicians on the recordings.\n\nGabler started up a specialty label UHCA (United Hot Clubs of America) in about 1935 to reissue selected 78 r.p.m. sides previously released by other companies. He was able to secure many important jazz records including the 1931 Joe Venuti-Eddie Lang all star session (from ARC), Bessie Smith's final session (from OKeh), a number of Frank Trumbauer, Bix Beiderbecke, and Miff Mole sides (also from OKeh). These reissues were from the original 78 stampers and were instrumental in spreading the concept of collecting classic performances from the past. A number of Paramount and Gennett sides were dubbed from clean copies and issued on UHCA and the sound was surprisingly good for a dubbing.\n\nIn 1937 he opened a new store on 52nd Street, and set up a series of jam sessions in a neighbouring club, Jimmy Ryan's. Some of these he began recording, setting up his own record label, Commodore Records. His role as a music producer soon superseded his other activities and he recorded many of the leading jazz artists of the day. One regular customer, Billie Holiday, found her record company, Columbia, resisting her appeals to release the song \"Strange Fruit\", so she offered the song to Gabler. After getting the necessary permission, he released her recording on Commodore in 1939, boosting her career and issuing what, 60 years on, \"Time\" magazine named Best Song of the Century.\n\nThe success of Commodore Records inevitably led to an offer to join a major record label. Gabler was recruited to work for Decca Records in 1941, and left his brother-in-law Jack Crystal (father of Billy Crystal) to run Commodore. Gabler was soon working with many of the biggest stars of the 1940s, producing a series of hits including Lionel Hampton’s \"Flying Home\", Billie Holiday’s \"Lover Man\" and The Andrews Sisters' \"Rum and Coca-Cola\", as well as being the first to bring Louis Armstrong and Ella Fitzgerald together on record.\n\nPut in charge of Decca’s subsidiary label Coral, he expanded his musical scope, producing hits for country singer Red Foley, the left-leaning folk group The Weavers, Peggy Lee, The Ink Spots, and Sammy Davis Jr. In 1946 he produced and co-wrote Louis Jordan’s breakthrough single, \"Choo Choo Ch'Boogie\", a foretaste of the musical revolution around the corner.\n\nGabler contributed a further slice of history when he signed Bill Haley and His Comets to Decca Records. He produced their initial recording session in April 1954, much of which was spent cutting a song which the company thought the more likely hit of the two due to be recorded that day. Their efforts on \"13 Women\" left only ten minutes for the second song, which Gabler recorded with an unusually high sound level after the briefest of sound checks. \"Rock Around The Clock\" was cut in two takes and changed the face of popular music. Gabler later commented : \"All the tricks I used with Louis Jordan, I used with Bill Haley. The only difference was the way we did the rhythm. On Jordan, we used a perfectly balanced rhythm section from the swing era ... but Bill had the heavy backbeat.\"\n\nCommodore Records was wound up in 1954. Bob Shad's Mainstream Records issued a series of albums of Commodore material in the early 1960s, keeping most of these recordings available. However, through the late 1950s and 1960s, Gabler continued to guide the direction of Decca, writing songs and producing hit singles including Brenda Lee’s “I’m Sorry” and albums including \"Jesus Christ Superstar\". Gabler also continued to produce all of the Comets' recordings for Decca until they left the label in 1959.\n\nMilt Gabler also produced all studio-albums in Hamburg for Bert Kaempfert and his Orchestra from 1960 to the latter's death in June 1980. He wrote many lyrics for Kaempfert songs, like \"L-O-V-E\", a very big hit for Nat King Cole, and \"Danke Schoen\".\n\nHe retired from the front line of business activity when MCA consolidated Decca with its other labels and moved the merged MCA Records to Universal City, California in 1971, but continued to produce reissues and to collect recognition from the recording industry he helped shape. He was asked to return to MCA Records in 1973 to supervise the reissue of MCA's massive back catalogue.\nGabler died July 20, 2001, aged 90, at the Jewish Home and Hospital in Manhattan. \"The New York Times\" reported that the only photo at his bedside was that of Billie Holiday.\n\nIn 1991, Gabler received the Grammy Trustees Award from The Recording Academy, for his significant contributions to the field of recording.\n\nIn 1993, Gabler was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame by his nephew, the comedian and actor Billy Crystal. In 2005, Crystal produced a documentary and CD release, both entitled \"The Milt Gabler Story\", in tribute.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2036840", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2036840", "title": "Dominic Cork", "text": "Dominic Cork\n\nDominic Gerald Cork (born 7 August 1971) is a former English county and international cricketer. Cork was a right-handed lower-order batsman who bowled right-arm fast-medium, and was renowned for his swing and seam control. In 1995, he took the best figures for an England bowler on Test debut, with 7 for 43 in the second innings against the West Indies.\n\nMaking his début in first-class cricket for Derbyshire in 1990, he was selected to play for England in 1992, aged 21. He made 69 appearances for England from 1992 to 2002. Cork played for Derbyshire for 13 years, before leaving under controversial circumstances to join Lancashire in 2004. Leaving Lancashire after the 2008 season, Cork joined Hampshire, who he played for from 2009 to 2011, acting as captain for much of the 2010 and 2011 seasons. While at Hampshire he won the 2009 Friends Provident Trophy, and captained the county to victory in the 2010 Friends Provident t20. He was released by Hampshire at the end of the 2011 season, shortly thereafter he announced his retirement on Sky Sports News on 22 September 2011. His popular nickname is \"\"Corky\"\".\n\nCork was born the youngest of three boys in Newcastle-under-Lyme to Mary and Gerald Cork, both Catholics of West Country origin. His grandfather, Archibald Cork, played non-league football for Port Vale F.C. in the 1910s. His father worked as a financial consultant. He was educated at St. Joseph's College, Stoke-on-Trent, before continuing his education at Newcastle-under-Lyme College.\n\nWhile playing for Staffordshire, Cork made his Youth ODI début for England Under-19's against New Zealand Under-19s in August 1989. Later in August he made his Youth Test début against the same opposition. He played six further Youth Tests to 1990 and five further Youth ODIs to 1990. Following strong performances for Derbyshire in the 1991 season, he earned himself a call up to the England A team for their 1992 tour of the West Indies, where he played in two first-class matches against the Windward Islands and West Indies A. \n\nLater in the year, following further strong performances for Derbyshire, he made his full international début in a One Day International against Pakistan at Old Trafford. He took one wicket in the match, that of Inzamam-ul-Haq. Cork played infrequently for England over the coming seasons, playing just two ODIs each in 1993 and 1994, against Australia and South Africa respectively. However, in May 1995 he played in three ODIs against the West Indies, taking 6 wickets at a bowling average of 21.81, with best figures 3/27. \n\nLater in the season he made his Test debut against the same opposition. In his maiden Test match he hit the first ball he received for 4 runs before going on to score 30 runs in England's first-innings, eventually being bowled by Courtney Walsh. In the second innings he scored 23 runs before being dismissed by Ian Bishop. His first Test wicket came in the West Indies' first innings when he dismissed Ian Bishop. More was to come in their second innings when from 124/3, Cork unleashed a bowling spell in which he took 7/43 – the best figures by an Englishman on Test debut – to help dismiss them for 223. This performance highlighted that at the time, Cork was the best all-rounder in England and also got his name on the Lord's Honours Boards. It also earned him the tag of \"the new Botham\" from the media. Two Tests later he became the 22nd man to take a Test cricket hat-trick, when he dismissed Richie Richardson, Junior Murray and Carl Hooper in successive balls in the West Indies second-innings; he was the first Englishman since Peter Loader in 1957 to achieve the feat. Cork finished the series with 26 wickets at an average of 25.42. He also struck his maiden Test half century, making an unbeaten 56 in the 4th Test.\nCork had a productive time in South Africa during their winter tour, playing five Tests and six ODIs during the tour. Cork was once more England's leading wicket-taker, with 19 Test wickets at an average of 25.52 and best innings figures of 5/84. He was similarly successful in the ODI series with the ball, England's second highest wicket-taker behind Derbyshire teammate Phil DeFreitas, with 10 wickets at 26.40 a piece. Cork was selected at part of England's squad for the 1996 World Cup in India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. In a tournament in which none of the England bowlers shone, Cork was the leading English wicket-taker, with 8 at 27.00. Despite this, Cork and rest of the England team were heavily criticised in the media for what had been an unsuccessful tournament which saw them defeated by eventual winners Sri Lanka in the quarter-finals.\n\nLater in 1996, Cork had a less successful period in Test cricket, taking 10 wickets during India's three match Test tour at an average of 36.90. Later followed a quiet Test series against Pakistan, in which he had 12 wickets at a little over 36 a piece. His form with the bat was little better in either series, with his all-round ability seemingly having deserted him. Despite this, he was made a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1996. Prior to the tour of New Zealand, Cork suffered personal issues off the pitch with the breakdown of his marriage to his first wife Jane. His personal issues impacted his performances on the field, this was illustrated by his bowling performances. At the end of the Test series he had taken just 7 wickets at an average of 42.85. His batting did fare better, scoring 59 in the first Test and he led England to a series winning victory in the 3rd Test, putting on 76 runs with John Crawley to remind people of the batting side of his game. He fared even worse in the ODI series though, taking just a single wicket throughout at the cost of 145 runs. He would not play another ODI until 2001. Cork described how he was not in the right frame of mind to play international cricket at the time and how his performances were affected by this, further commenting he had no idea when running in to bowl what delivery he would send down to the batsman. There was, however, a feeling in some quarters that Cork was \"more style than substance\", and during the tour he was the target of a comment from Geoffrey Boycott who alleged that Cork was a \"show pony\" with \"an attitude problem\". Cork was prevented from answering Boycott back when injury prevented him from playing during most of the 1997 English season.\n\nOver a year after his previous Test appearance for England, he featured in the Test series during South Africa's 1998 tour of England. Cork's return was fairly successful; he took 18 wickets at an average of 31.83, with best innings figures of 6/119. His best figures came in the 2nd Test at Lord's, thus placing his name on the Lord's honours board for a second time. He later played in England's only Test against Sri Lanka at The Oval where he claimed the wickets of Marvan Atapattu and Romesh Kaluwitharana in the Sri Lankan first-innings, in a match the tourists won by 10 wickets. Cork later went on that winter's Ashes tour. He played in the opening two Tests at the Gabba and The WACA, claiming only 4 wickets in all at an average of 41.25. This was to be the final time Cork would play a Test outside England.\n\nIn 2000, Cork was recalled to the England Test squad for the West Indies tour of England, where he featured in four Test matches. Cork was in fantastic form with the ball during the series, having arguably his best returns in Test cricket. He took 20 wickets at an impressive average of 12.25, in partnership with Darren Gough and Andrew Caddick, against a West Indian team which was in decline, but that still had talented players like Brian Lara, Courtney Walsh, Curtly Ambrose and Shivnarine Chanderpaul. One of Cork's defining moments in Test cricket came during the series, when in the 2nd Test England were 149/7, needing to reach 188 to win, Cork entered the fray. Cork scampered singles and struck boundaries when needed, including a pulled six off the bowling of Franklyn Rose and in conjunction with Darren Gough, led England to a two wicket win in the dusk at Lord's shortly before 7 pm. He was later ruled out of the winter tour of Pakistan due to a back injury.\n\nCork featured in the Pakistani tour of England in 2001 and after four years he was recalled to play in the ODI series involving Pakistan and Australia. Cork had limited success upon his recall, taking six wickets at an average of 35.83. He later played in the 2nd Test of the 2001 Ashes at Lord's, scoring 24 runs in England first-innings before being dismissed by Jason Gillespie. In England's second-innings he scored just 2 runs before being dismissed by Glenn McGrath. He was ineffective with the ball, taking just a single wicket in the match, that of Steve Waugh in the Australians first-innings. Cork later played a single Test against Sri Lanka in 2002 and played his final Tests in two matches against India. Cork's final ODI appearances for England came in the 2002 ICC Champions Trophy against India and Zimbabwe. He had little success and had seemed to lose his ability to outswing the ball, resorting to bowling the bouncer more often and increased sledging toward opponents.\n\nWith the end of his international career in following the tournament, Cork had played a total of 37 Test matches. In these he scored a total of 867 runs at an average of 18.00, with three half centuries and a high score of 59. In the field he took 18 catches. With the ball he took 131 wickets at an average of 29.81, with best figures of 7/43, claimed on debut. In ODIs he played 32 matches, scoring 180 runs at an average of 10.00, with a high score of 31*. With the ball he took 41 wickets at an average of 33.36, with best figures of 3/27. His benefit as an all-rounder was best observed in the Test format.\n\nCork first played county cricket for Staffordshire in the Minor Counties Championship against Bedfordshire, aged just 17. Cork played three further fixtures for Staffordshire in 1989, and the following season he played his only MCCA Knockout Trophy match for Staffordshire, which came against Shropshire. After playing for the Derbyshire Second XI in 1989, he made his full Derbyshire debut in a first-class match against the touring New Zealanders. His maiden first-class wicket came during this match, that of opening batsman Trevor Franklin in his first over which ended as a wicket maiden, and in the New Zealanders' second-innings he took the wicket of Mark Priest. He made his County Championship debut against Leicestershire in Derbyshire's final County Championship match in the same season. The following season he became a regular member of the Derbyshire team and made his List A debut against Yorkshire in the 1991 Refuge Assurance League. The 1991 season highlighted Cork's early potential as a potent all-rounder: he scored first-class 423 runs at a batting average of 21.15, with a high score of 44 and took 57 first-class wickets at a bowling average of 25.62. A performance of note came against a strong Essex team, with Cork taking figures of 8/53 in the Essex first-innings. His victims included future Test player Nick Knight and Pakistani international Saleem Malik.\n\nHis performances in the 1991 season earnt him a call up to the England A team during their tour of the West Indies. The following season Cork cemented his place in the Derbyshire team with increasingly impressive performances in both first-class and List A cricket. In first-class cricket he struck his maiden first-class half century and scored 578 runs at an average of 30.42, making a high score of 72 not out. With the ball he was less successful than the previous season, but still nonetheless took 48 wickets. In the same season he stood out with the ball in the one-day game, taking 27 wickets an average of 28.85, including his first five wicket haul in List A cricket. It was his consistent performances with the ball which led to his One Day International call-up in 1992. In 1993, Cork scored his maiden first-class century against Gloucestershire, making 104 runs. Cork was man-of-the-match in the final of the 1993 Benson & Hedges Cup against Lancashire, scoring an unbeaten 92 and taking the wicket of Mike Watkinson, as Derbyshire won the match by 6 runs. Despite playing a handful more ODIs, in general the 1993 and 1994 seasons were less productive seasons for Cork with the ball, taking 37 first-class wickets in both seasons. 1995 was to prove to be Cork's major breakthrough season, in which he rediscovered his form, taking 90 first-class wickets at an average of exactly 20, including a career-best 9/43 against Northamptonshire, which remains his best figures to this day, and with Cork making his Test debut.\nThe coming seasons saw Cork become a regular feature in the England team, limiting his appearances for Derbyshire. 1996 saw him make limited appearances in both first-class and List A cricket, however a groin injury in the first County Championship match of 1997 led to him not playing any international cricket that season and limited his appearances for Derbyshire. In the 1998 season, Cork was appointed Derbyshire captain on a full-time basis, replacing Phil DeFreitas who had stood in following the resignation of Dean Jones. A return to the England Test fold in 1998 again limited his County Championship appearances, but he featured more for the county in that season's List A competitions. He scored 280 runs in one-day cricket and took 23 wickets at just under an average of 30. He captained Derbyshire in their 1998 NatWest Trophy final defeat against Lancashire at Lord's. Cork's recent struggles in international cricket, where he had lost his ability to bowl his much famed out-swinger resulted in him playing for Derbyshire for the majority of the 1999 season, where he took 55 wickets at an average of 22.34. The following season saw Cork return to the England Test team. A personal note of success that season came with Derbyshire in a County Championship match against Durham, where he made a double century, scoring an unbeaten 200.\n\nHowever, Derbyshire at this point in the club's history was beset with internal divisions, stemming from the resignation two years earlier of Dean Jones from the captaincy. Such was the internal strife during that 1998 season that England's chairman of selectors David Graveney left Cork out of the 1999 World Cup squad, citing that the issues at Derbyshire were playing too heavily on Cork's mind to allow him to play international cricket. Before the start of the 1999 season, Cork demanded the Derbyshire committee return a number of powers to the captaincy, and when his demands went unfulfilled he threatened to resign from the county altogether. Allied with Cork in the dispute were teammates Kim Barnett and Karl Krikken. Cork carried out his threat and asked to be released from the remainder of the four seasons left on his contract. However Derbyshire refused to terminate the contract. Six months after the dispute began, the Derbyshire committee gave into Cork's demands allowing him more say over playing matters, coupled with the departure of Andy Hayhurst and Harold Rhodes from administration positions at the county, both of whom Cork cited as making his captaincy untenable. The internal divisions between Cork and the county management soon became public knowledge, with former players like Ian Blackwell vocal of Cork's captaincy methods and his \"negative\" impact on the dressing room. During the dispute his form began to suffer, and another injury in 2001 did not help his case. He was awarded a benefit year in 2001, with some of his benefit events being boycotted by the Derbyshire committee; this was a season in which Cork's appearances were limited to just a handful by his England duties and return to the England one-day side.\n\nIn 2002, Cork played more regularly for Derbyshire, but pressure began to build on his captaincy with Derbyshire performing poorly in List A cricket and ending the season 6th in the County Championship, although he did take 64 wickets at 18.90. Cork's international career came to an end in 2002, allowing him to dedicate himself to playing season long for Derbyshire. With the internal problems at the county, Cork's form with both bat and ball was erratic: his first-class bowling average in 2001 was 51.50, 18.90 in 2002, and 27.26 in 2003. His performances in one-day cricket remained more consistent. The 2003 season was also one of Cork's most controversial. Following a Twenty20 fixture against Leicestershire in the Twenty20 Cup, Cork branded Australian Brad Hodge a cheat after he appeared to catch Steven Selwood after crossing the boundary rope. He also branded the response of the England and Wales Cricket Board's chief executive, Tim Lamb, as \"pathetic\". Following the remarks, Hodge considered legal action. The England and Wales Cricket Board took action, summoning Cork to a hearing where they fined him £1,000 and banned him for three matches. The three match ban was suspended for a year. With Derbyshire rooted to the bottom of the County Championship Division Two table at the end of the season and coupled with the internal issues at Derbyshire, including incoming Director of Cricket David Houghton's refusal to confirm him as captain for 2004, Cork requested to be released from the remainder of his three-year contract extension agreed only at the beginning of the 2003 season. His release was granted by the county.\n\nIn the period from 1990 to 2003, Cork played 158 first-class matches for the county, scoring 5,870 runs at a batting average of 28.08, with five centuries and thirty-five half centuries. In the field he claimed 125 catches. With the ball he took 505 wickets at a bowling average of 25.76, with 22 five wicket hauls, 5 ten wicket hauls in a match and with career best innings figures of 9/53. His record in List A cricket for the county was equally as impressive, playing 184 matches and scoring 2,947 runs at an average of 22.49, with sixteen half centuries and a high score of 93. In the field he took 83 catches. With the ball he claimed 234 wickets at an average of 26.05, with four five wicket hauls and best figures of 6/21, which remain his best figures. He formed key bowling partnerships with teammates Phil DeFreitas, Devon Malcolm and Ole Mortensen. He has cited Kim Barnett, the first captain he played under at Derbyshire, as the best captain he has played for, regarding him as his \"guide and mentor\". Indeed, it was Cork's wish to see Barnett return to the county in an administration capacity which played a part in Cork's downfall at the county.\n\nFollowing his release from his Derbyshire contract, Cork joined Lancashire for the 2004 season. After surgery on a troublesome ankle injury, Cork joined the county in their pre-season tour of South Africa before making his debut for the county in a County Championship match against Northamptonshire. Cork's early days at his new county brought mixed fortunes, suffering a loss of form in 2004, coupled with relegation from Division One of the County Championship. Cork's maiden season with Lancashire did see him play a role in taking them to finals day in the Twenty20 Cup at Edgbaston, where he played in their semi-final defeat by Surrey. He was awarded his county cap in 2004. The county were promoted back to Division One the following season, a season in which Cork took 46 first-class wickets at 26, and 17 List A wickets at an average 27.47. This season was a marked improvement on Cork's debut season for Lancashire. In 2006, Lancashire mounted a challenge for the County Championship, with Cork taking 42 wickets at an average of 25.50. Lancashire were eventually beaten to the title by Sussex. Cork also played a key role in Lancashire's run to the final of the 2006 Cheltenham & Gloucester Trophy, where they played Sussex. Opening the bowling with Kyle Hogg, Cork did not take any Sussex wickets, but did run-out Richard Montgomerie and Carl Hopkinson. His not out 35 in Lancashire's innings was in vain as Sussex ran out winners by 15 runs in a low scoring match.\n\nCork was banned for the first 50-over game of 2007 after an incident at the previous season's final against Sussex, and was fined £2,500. This was later reduced to £500 on appeal. The 2007 season panned out in a similar fashion to the previous season's County Championship, with the fight for the title, again with Sussex, going down to the final day of the season. Playing Surrey at The Oval, Lancashire required nothing less than a victory to claim the title. Chasing 489 runs to win, Cork struck a dogged 47 in Lancashire's second-innings, as they ultimately fell short of their target by 25 runs. Seemingly falling down the pecking order at Lancashire, Cork did not feature in any one-day matches in the 2008 and only played a handful of County Championship matches. On 12 August 2008 it was announced that Lancashire would not be renewing Cork's contract for the 2009 season. While Cork said that \"it hurts, decisions like this\", he also said that he intended to continue playing cricket at the highest level that he could. Lancashire captain Stuart Law stated that he had not been consulted about the decision and wanted Cork to stay at the club. The club released a statement saying Cork was released \"with the longer-term development of the playing staff in mind and to allow the side to evolve\". The decision to release Cork was criticised by Lancashire and England all-rounder Andrew Flintoff.\n\nIn his five seasons with Lancashire, Cork played 64 first-class matches, scoring 1,822 runs at an average of 24.95, with three centuries, eight half centuries and a high score 154. Meanwhile, in the field he took 49 catches. On Old Trafford pitches typically suited to pace and bounce, he took 173 wickets at a bowling average of 28.29, with four five wickets hauls and best innings figures of 7/120. In List A cricket he played 57 matches, scoring 749 runs at an average of 22.69, with two half centuries and a high score 57. In the field he took 15 catches. With the ball he took 58 wickets at an average of 28.98, with best figures of 4/14. Cork had left Derbyshire after the first season of Twenty20 cricket, so with Lancashire he had more exposure to the format. He scored 259 runs for Lancashire at an average of 13.63, with a high score of 28. With the ball he took 26 wickets at an average of 22.72, with best figures of 4/16.\n\nOn 2 October 2008 he joined Hampshire after signing a two-year deal, making his debut against Worcestershire in the 2009 County Championship at the Rose Bowl. Having been a key part of the Hampshire squad throughout the 2009 Friends Provident Trophy, where he played a part in guiding them to the final. In the final Cork helped Hampshire to a 6 wicket win. Cork was man-of-the-match, 16 years after his man-of-the-match performance for Derbyshire in the 1993 Benson & Hedges Cup final. Cork took figures of 4/41, including the wickets of England wicket-keeper Matt Prior for a second ball duck and Pakistan international Yasir Arafat. Cork's first season was a qualified success, with him taking 62 wickets in all formats. His first season form played a part in helping Hampshire to a late season rally after being within the Division One relegation zone for most of the season.\n\nWith Dimitri Mascarenhas injured for the large part of the 2010 season, Cork took over the captaincy when Nic Pothas stood down following a run of poor results. During the 2010 season, Cork led the side to victory in the 2010 Friends Provident t20 finals day at the home of Hampshire cricket, the Rose Bowl. During the final itself he took the wickets of Jos Buttler and Arul Suppiah, as well as hitting West Indian all-rounder Kieron Pollard in the eye with a bouncer, which led to Pollard needing hospital treatment. Cork was praised for his sportsmanship during the incident. Following the match, Cork was offered a new one-year deal by Hampshire, a deal he stated he was likely to sign but a decision he would still nonetheless consider over the coming weeks. In October it was confirmed that Cork had signed a one-year contract extension taking him into the 2011 season, which would be his 21st in first-class cricket. Cork was also given the captaincy for the 2011 season on a permanent basis.\n\nProvided Cork had a successful 2011 season, then he would be set to reach the all-rounders' double of 1,000 wickets and 10,000 runs in first-class cricket. Cork hit his 10,000th run in Hampshires' County Championship match against Yorkshire at Headingley, off the bowling of Ajmal Shahzad. Under Cork's captaincy, Hampshire started poorly in the County Championship, where they sat second bottom without any wins, while in one-day cricket they have fared little better. However Hampshire saw a turn around in fortunes, be it in the Friends Life t20, with Cork captaining them to five wins out of five, guiding them to their second successive finals day. On finals day, they lost in the semi-final against Somerset. Cork's form though continued to dip as the season progressed, towards the end of the 2011 season he took a break to look after his father who had been diagnosed with cancer and given a matter of weeks to live. Following Twenty20 finals days, he paid an emotional tribute to his father who died days before. On 10 September, it was announced that Hampshire would be releasing Cork at the end of the 2011 season. A fortnight later he announced his retirement from the game after 21 seasons in first-class cricket, with Cork falling just short of 1,000 first-class wickets; he ended his first-class career instead with 989.\n\nHe was chosen as one of the five Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1996, alongside England teammates Angus Fraser and Dermot Reeve. In their rationale, Wisden described his arrival in Test cricket as \"without question, the most explosive entrance in living memory\".\n\nCork married his first wife Jane when he was 22, but the pressures of being away on international duty led to his marriage ending in divorce. Cork has one son from that marriage, Greg, who made his debut for Derbyshire in 2014, playing four Twenty20 matches after joining the county's Academy. His son is also an all-rounder.\n\nCork lives in Derby and is married to his second wife, Donna, five years his senior. He is a lifelong supporter of Stoke City F.C.\n\nCork regularly commentates on the game for Sky Sports. He was one of the people caught up in the 2009 attack on the Sri Lanka national cricket team, when he was commentating on Sri Lanka's tour of Pakistan for the Pakistan Television Corporation. He criticised Pakistan Cricket Board chief Ijaz Butt following his remarks that match referee Chris Broad had fabricated elements of the attack. Cork also commentates on the Indian Premier League. In February 2010 Cork made his debut as a summariser on Test Match Special when England toured Bangladesh. In December 2010, Cork was named as one of the contestants for series 6 of Dancing on Ice with Finnish figure skater Alexandra Schauman. He was eliminated in week four after being voted off by his six of his fellow contestants, following a skate-off with presenter Jeff Brazier.\n\nPolitically, Cork is a Conservative.\n\nCork's father was taken to hospital after suffering a heart attack in July 2011, while receiving treatment in hospital he was diagnosed with cancer and given just three weeks to live. Cork took a break from playing for Hampshire to be with his father in his final days, with Gerald dying on 13 August.\n\n"}

When sailors grew anxious that the expedition was delaying a return to Portugal, a number of sailors attempted to force de Sequeira to order the ships home. In the sequence of a failed plot to destroy the expedition, Fernandes was among nineteen Portuguese that stood arrested in Malacca. His amicable nature spared him the fate of the other conspirators. Together with Rui de Araújo, Fernandes gathered knowledge about the culture of the region and became a de facto envoy of Afonso de Albuquerque.\n\nIn 1511 the Portuguese conquered Malacca. Knowing of Siamese ambitions over Malay, Albuquerque sent Fernandes in a diplomatic mission to the court of the King of Siam, Ramathibodi II. Fernandes was dispatched and became the first European to arrive in Siam, where he was successful in establishing amicable relations between the Kingdom of Portugal and the Kingdom of Siam, returning with a Siamese envoy bearing gifts and letters to Albuquerque and the king of Portugal. Five years after that initial contact, Ayutthaya and Portugal concluded a treaty granting the Portuguese permission to trade in the kingdom.\n\nFernandes became one of the first Europeans to take an interest in Chinese shipbuilding, as he traveled in a Chinese junk on his return journey to Malacca and, being a former tailor, was fascinated by the junk's sails.\n\n"}

{"id": "2036869", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2036869", "title": "Institut d'études politiques de Lyon", "text": "Institut d'études politiques de Lyon\n\nThe Institut d'Etudes Politiques de Lyon (or Lyon Institute of Political Studies) also known as Sciences Po Lyon, is a grande école located in Lyon, France. It is one of ten Institutes of Political Studies in France, and was established in 1948 by Charles de Gaulle's provisional government following the model of the \"École Libre des Sciences Politiques\". It is located at the Centre Berthelot within the buildings of a former military health college and operates as an autonomous institution within the University of Lyon. It is the first Institute of Political Studies to have joined the prestigious Conférence des Grandes écoles.\n\nSciences Po Lyon has established partnerships with more than 160 universities abroad.\n\nThe excellency of Science Po Lyon curriculum and academic training as well as the quality of its international network and policy have been appropriately recognized and praised by AERES, the French Evaluation Agency for Research and Higher Education and subsequently by HCERES, the French High Council for Evaluation of Research and Higher Education.\n\nSciences Po Lyon is particularly renowned for its expertise in Asian affairs, graded A+ (the highest grade) both by AERES and HCERES.\n\nSciences Po Lyon was established following an executive decree by General de Gaulle in 1948. In common with the other Institutes of Political Studies in France, it was modelled on the former École Libre des Sciences Politiques (ELSP) in Paris. It is considered as a French \"Grande École\" or elite school and remains an autonomous body within the University of Lyon.\n\nThe ELSP was established as a private institution in 1872 by Emile Boutmy (along with Hippolyte Taine, Ernest Renan, Albert Sorel, Paul Leroy-Beaulieu and René Stourm), was dissolved in 1945 following a demand coming primarily from the French Communist Party, the strongest political force at that time, as well as other political figures not affiliated with it, such as Jean-Pierre Cot and André Philip. J.P. Cot and André Philip were both members of the Parliamentary Committee on the reform of the State. The ELSP, known then as Sciences Po, was indeed considered as an institution providing the sole Parisian bourgeoisie with a quasi-monopoly over access to the most prestigious positions in the French civil service (the Grands corps de l'Etat or high administrative bodies). More to the point, the ELSP was discredited for having trained many senior civil servants who quickly supported and were actually the backbone of the Vichy France from July 1940 to August 1944.\n\nAs per ordinance 45-2284, issued by Charles de Gaulle on 9 October 1945, the ELSP was thus replaced by the Institut d'Etudes Politiques de l'Université de Paris. The Fondation Nationale des Sciences Politiques was established by the same ordinance in order to oversee it as well as the other instituts d'études politiques -including the IEP in Lyon in 1948- subsequently established throughout the French territory. In order to democratize and rationalize access to the senior civil service, the \"National School of Administration\" (École nationale d'administration) was created on the basis of a project developed by Michel Debré and Emmanuel Monick. Otherwise, this project was not entirely in the spirit of the programme developed by the National Council of the Resistance (Conseil National de la Resistance or CNR) during World War II, which was willing to sanction and nationalize the ELSP. Was established instead a tripartite and unbalanced structure composed of the FNSP, the ENA, the IEP in Paris (1945) and the subsequent IEPs in Strasbourg (1946), Grenoble (1948), Lyon (1948), Bordeaux (1948), Toulouse (1948), Aix (1956), Rennes (1991) and Lille (1991). While the FNSP is a private foundation, the latter institutions are indeed public.\n\nThe vocation of the French instituts d'études politiques has been the study and research of contemporary political science. They are quite distinct from the other traditional elite French schools, in particular the highly specialized Grandes Ecoles in business and engineering, given their multi-disciplinary approach to teaching. All students at the IEPs study a compulsory curriculum that is highly practical and multidisciplinary during its first years and focuses on the full range of the social sciences and humanities. The IEPs, being modelled on the former ELSP, are known in the familiar language under the name of Sciences Po, followed by the name of the city where they are located.\n\nAccording to article 2 of an 18 December 1989 decree on the status of the instituts d'études politiques, their mission is to contribute to the training of higher civil servants as well as executives in the public, para-public and private sectors, notably in the State and decentralized communities as well as to develop the research in political and administrative sciences.\n\nThe Sciences Po approach and style inspired many universities abroad such as the London School of Economics.\n\nIt is located at the Centre Berthelot within the buildings of a former military health college, which was used during World War II by the then Lyon's Gestapo chief, Klaus Barbie, to torture resistance members, including Jean Moulin. The same buildings were also used by the Ecole Polytechnique from 1940 to 1943 after the school decided to relocate to Lyon (then in the free zone) from its headquarters in the occupied Paris.\n\nSciences Po occupies an area of 9,500 square meters, contiguous to the premises of the Center for the History of the Resistance and Deportation (\"Centre d'histoire de la résistance et de la déportation\").\n\nSciences Po Lyon has established a satellite campus for a curriculum specialized in Russian affairs in Saint-Etienne at Jean Monnet University, .\n\nStudent selection is based on grades obtained in the French baccalauréat (the examination taken at the end of secondary school) and at a competitive written examination called the Heptaconcours (acceptance/selection rate is currently less 10%), which is co-organized with six other institutes, respectively in Aix-en-Provence, Lille, Rennes, Saint-Germain-en-Laye, Strasbourg, and Toulouse. Selected students can then decide in which of these seven institutes they will enrol.\n\nUnder the patronage of Christine Lagarde, IMF managing director and a graduate from Sciences Po Aix, Sciences Po Lyon along with the other IEPs of the Heptaconcours, have now organized a competitive examination for Chinese French-speaking students, who will be then able to attend the last two years of the Sciences Po academic curriculum.\n\nSince 2014, French students abroad have been able to take the Heptacononcours in four examination centres established abroad: Bangkok, Thailand ; Bogota, Colombia ; Casablanca, Morocco ; Dubai, UAE. Other centres have also been open in the French overseas territories: Pointe-à-Pitre, Guadeloupe ; Cayenne, Guyane : Tahiti, French Polynesia ; Fort-de-France, Martinique ; Saint-Denis, La Réunion.\n\nContrary to a general belief, there is no official ranking amongst the various IEPs in France. This derives from the willingness of General de Gaulle and other past legislators in the aftermath of the Liberation of France in 1945 to ensure territorial and social equality amongst students throughout France.\n\nNevertheless, according to a 2010 research, top-notch students following the competitive written examination organized by the six IEPs of Aix, Lille, Lyon, Rennes, Toulouse, Strasbourg, tend to choose Lyon, along with Lille and Strasbourg as their first choices. Accordingly, approximately 55% of the students at Sciences Po hold a French Baccalaureate (equivalent to an A level), predominantly scientific or economic, with a Summa Cum Laude distinction. This percentage is higher than in Bordeaux and Grenoble Institutes of Political Studies. Such a percentage is also higher than in most of the best French Grandes Ecoles.\n\nThe current acceptance/selection rate for students willing to enter in the first year of the standard curriculum for the IEP of Lyon, Aix, Lille, Rennes, Toulouse, Strasbourg, is now less than 10% while it reached 18.7% in 2010 and 14.17% in 2013 for the IEP of Paris (additionally, the rate of the so-called international procedure for foreign students or French students with a foreign degree was up to 31% in 2012). That makes the selection process for these six IEPs more competitive than for Paris. The acceptance/selection rate for students willing to enter in the second year of the curriculum of the IEP in Lyon is less than 5% (853 candidates for 42 places available for the 2013–14 academic year).\n\n\"\"The IEP in Lyon is one of the most respected institutes in France and both its programmes and international connections are extensive and world renowned\"\" the King's College of London has stressed while Brown University has praised Sciences Po Lyon for its Middle Eastern and North African studies.\n\nSciences Po Lyon's dynamism and international reputation was underscored by the French newspaper, Challenges, in its ranking of French Business Schools.\n\nSciences Po Lyon currently offers a 5-year-long programme, with a three-year-long undergraduate programme and a two-year graduate programme in line with the Bologna Process and delivers its main diploma equivalent to a master's degree. The first two years are aimed at giving students a multidisciplinary background, primarily focusing on social sciences such as economics, public law, contemporary history, philosophy, sociology and public policy. Additionally, students need to study at least two foreign languages, such as English, German, Spanish, Chinese, Japanese, Arabic, Italian, or Russian.\n\nThe last two years provide students with further specialization in a wide range of specialities:\n\nDuring their third year at Sciences Po, students can decide either to do a year-long internship or to pursue their studies abroad, at one of 166 partner universities.

HCERES has also praised the excellent network of Sciences Po Lyon's international partners, notably those in the United States. The institute has indeed benefited strongly from being part of the Fulbright Program. This has provided the exchange of professors and lecturers from top-ranked US universities, such as Andrew C. Rudalevige, PhD from Harvard University and Toppan Prize of the best dissertation in political science.\n\nSciences Po Lyon has fifteen student associations, including the \"Association des Anciens Eleves de l'IEP de Lyon\" (Alumni association), \"Bobinophile\" (for movie fans), \"Comequi\" (aimed at promoting fair trade),\"Déclic\"(photography), \"La Fanfaraon\" (Brass band), \"Melting Sciences Pot\" (aimed at welcoming foreign students) and Sciences Po TV. Several student papers have been created such as \"La Mâche\" (philosophy and poetry), \"Po Go\" (music and night life), \"Regards d'Ailleurs\" (political news and analyses) or \"L'Ecornifleur\" (political news), the latter partnering with national print media such as L'Express. Cultural groups such as \"Arriba Do Sul\" organize events that highlight foreign cultures or cuisine.\n\nThe \"Bureau des Etudiants\" (BDE or Student Council), aims to integrate students into school life through cultural events, conferences with political leaders, diplomats and opinion leaders. Major events include the \"WEST\" (a weekend of ski), the \"week-end d'intégration\" (where new students integrate with collective games and parties), and the \"Gala de Sciences Po Lyon\" (which gathers students and professors for a night of shows and dance).\n\nSciences Po Lyon students participate in the \"Crit\", a sporting event between all the Institutes of Political Studies in France. The university has sport clubs, such as its Soccer, Basketball, Handball, or the Rugby Team (the GPRC). The \"Bureau des sports\" (BDE) manages the school's athletic life and organizes the \"Crit\", in cooperation with the BDEs of the other IEPs.\n\nThe Information and Communication Research Team of Lyon (ELICO) brings together thirty teacher-researchers and around forty PhD students in information and communication sciences from Sciences Po Lyon, Lyon-1, Lyon-2 and Lyon-3 universities as well as from the National School of Information Sciences and Libraries (ENSSIB).\n\nEstablished in 1987, the Institute of Human Sciences (ISH) brings together 23 research laboratories located in Lyon and Saint-Étienne. It covers a wide range of expertise in the fields of human and social sciences, including history, economics-management, sociology, linguistics and political science.\n\nAlong with Université Lumière-Lyon 2, the institute hosts the \"Centre de Politologie de Lyon (\"CERIEP\"), a CNRS research department on politology. In addition to its master programmes, Sciences Po offers a PhD programme in political sciences and participates in research and study programs with the support of national partner institutions such as the Rhône-Alpes Regional Council, one of the richest in France. More recently, Sciences Po has established a research group named Triangle, in joint cooperation with the Centre national de la recherche scientifique (French National Centre for Scientific Research), the École Normale Supérieure de Lyon (ENS) and Lyon Lumiere University.\n\nAlong with the ENS in Lyon and the Université Lumière-Lyon 2, Sciences Po is running the Lyon Institute of East Asian Studies (\"Institut d'Asie Orientale\"/ IAO), which has been graded A+ by AERES and has been considered as such as the best French research institute in this field. Since 2009, the IAO has been partnering with the Tohoku University within the framework of the Global Center of Excellence project as well as with the University of Beijing and the University of Tokyo for other projects. The IAO is involved in the training of PhD students under an agreement with the École normale supérieure Paris-Saclay and the Ecole Normale Supérieure de Ulm and the East China Normal University of Shanghai. IAO members also sit on dissertation committees at Stanford University and the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nAlong with the Maison de l'Orient et de la Méditerranée, the institute has established a research center on Middle Eastern Affairs, called \"GREMMO\" (Groupe de recherche et d’études sur la Méditerranée et le Moyen-Orient). It is supervised by Fabrice Balanche, an expert on Syria.\n\nIn order to gain greater visibility overseas, its publications are now labelled under the publications of the University of Lyon. The latter is grouping the main universities and colleges in Lyon.\n\nIt has had a low number of alumni (8,500 since its establishment).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2036897", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2036897", "title": "ISFET", "text": "ISFET\n\nAn ion-sensitive field-effect transistor (ISFET) is a field-effect transistor used for measuring ion concentrations in solution; when the ion concentration (such as H, see pH scale) changes, the current through the transistor will change accordingly. Here, the solution is used as the gate electrode. A voltage between substrate and oxide surfaces arises due to an ion sheath. It is a special type of MOSFET (metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor), and shares the same basic structure, but with the metal gate replaced by an ion-sensitive membrane, electrolyte solution and reference electrode. Invented in 1970, the ISFET was the first biosensor FET (BioFET).\n\nThe surface hydrolysis of Si–OH groups of the gate materials varies in aqueous solutions due to pH value. Typical gate materials are SiO, SiN, AlO and TaO.\n\nThe mechanism responsible for the oxide surface charge can be described by the \"site binding model\", which describes the equilibrium between the Si–OH surface sites and the H ions in the solution. The hydroxyl groups coating an oxide surface such as that of SiO can donate or accept a proton and thus behave in an amphoteric way as illustrated by the following acid-base reactions occurring at the oxide-electrolyte interface:\n\nAn ISFET's source and drain are constructed as for a MOSFET. The gate electrode is separated from the channel by a barrier which is sensitive to hydrogen ions and a gap to allow the substance under test to come in contact with the sensitive barrier. An ISFET's threshold voltage depends on the pH of the substance in contact with its ion-sensitive barrier.\n\nAn ISFET electrode sensitive to H concentration can be used as a conventional glass electrode to measure the pH of a solution. However, it also requires a reference electrode to operate. If the reference electrode used in contact with the solution is of the AgCl or HgCl classical type, it will suffer the same limitations as conventional pH electrodes (junction potential, KCl leak, and glycerol leak in case of gel electrode). A conventional reference electrode can also be bulky and fragile. A too large volume constrained by a classical reference electrode also precludes the miniaturization of the ISFET electrode, a mandatory feature for some biological or \"in vivo\" clinical analyses (disposable mini-catheter pH probe). The breakdown of a conventional reference electrode could also make problem in on-line measurements in the pharmaceutical or food industry if highly valuable products are contaminated by electrode debris or toxic chemical compounds at a late production stage and must be discarded for the sake of safety.\n\nFor this reason, since more than 20 years many research efforts have been dedicated to on-chip embedded tiny reference field effect transistors (REFET). Their functioning principle, or operating mode, can vary, depending on the electrode producers and are often proprietary and protected by patents. Semi-conductor modified surfaces required for REFET are also not always in thermodynamical equilibrium with the test solution and can be sensitive to aggressive or interfering dissolved species or not well characterized aging phenomena. This is not a real problem if the electrode can be frequently re-calibrated at regular time interval and is easily maintained during its service life. However, this may be an issue if the electrode has to remain immersed on-line for prolonged period of time, or is inaccessible for particular constrains related to the nature of the measurements itself (geochemical measurements under elevated water pressure in harsh environments or under anoxic or reducing conditions easily disturbed by atmospheric oxygen ingress or pressure changes).\n\nA crucial factor for ISFET electrodes, as for conventional glass electrodes, remains thus the reference electrode. When troubleshooting electrode malfunctions, often, most of the problems have to be searched for from the side of the reference electrode.\n\nThe basis for the ISFET is the MOSFET (metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor), which was originally invented by Egyptian engineer Mohamed M. Atalla and Korean engineer Dawon Kahng in 1959. In 1962, Leland C. Clark and Champ Lyons invented the biosensor.\n\nDutch engineer Piet Bergveld, at the University of Twente, later studied the MOSFET and realized it could be adapted into a sensor for electrochemical and biological applications. This led to Bergveld's invention of the ISFET in 1970. He described the ISFET as \"a special type of MOSFET with a gate at a certain distance\". It was the earliest Biosensor FET (BioFET).\n\nISFET sensors could be implemented in integrated circuits based on CMOS (complementary MOS) technology. ISFET devices are widely used in biomedical applications, such as the detection of DNA hybridization, biomarker detection from blood, antibody detection, glucose measurement and pH sensing. The ISFET is also the basis for later BioFETs, such as the DNA field-effect transistor (DNAFET), used in genetic technology.\n\n\n"}

Briney, 183 N.W.2d 657 (Iowa 1971), was a court case decided by the Iowa Supreme Court, in which two homeowners (Edward and Bertha Briney) were held liable for battery for injuries caused to a trespasser (Marvin Katko) who set off a spring gun set as a mantrap in an abandoned house on the homeowners’ property.\n\nBertha Briney inherited an old farmhouse in Mahaska County, Iowa, which the Brineys had left vacant for the last ten years prior to the incident. They had the house boarded up and placed \"No Trespassing\" signs around the property. The house was in poor condition and was subject to frequent burglaries and break-ins. To defend the house against intruders, Edward Briney mounted a 20-gauge spring-loaded shotgun in the farmhouse and rigged it to fire when the north bedroom door was opened. The gun was aimed downward so as to shoot an intruder's legs, rather than cause a mortal injury. Briney also covered the bedroom window with steel. A month later, on July 16, 1967, Katko entered the farmhouse with the intent of stealing some old bottles and dated fruit jars that Katko considered antiques. He was aware of their presence because he and a friend had broken into the house two weeks earlier. When Katko entered the bedroom, he tripped the trigger mechanism and the shotgun fired into his legs at point blank range. The gunshot wounds were sufficiently severe to require hospitalization, and Katko sued the Brineys after his release from the hospital.\n\nGarold Heslinga of Oskaloosa, Iowa, was the attorney for the appellee (Katko) and Bruce Palmer and H.S. Life. also of Oskaloosa, Iowa, represented the appellants (Brineys).\n\nThe Court ruled that using deadly force on intruders in an unoccupied property was not reasonable or justified. Briney would have been justified in defending himself with the shotgun if he had been home during the intrusion. The plaintiff's status as a trespasser is irrelevant when assessing liability in this case. \n\nThe case stands for the proposition that, although a landowner has no duty to make his property safe for trespassers, he may not set deadly traps against them, holding that \"the law has always placed a higher value upon human safety than upon mere rights in property.\" The court thus ruled for Katko, entering judgment for $20,000 in actual damages and $10,000 in punitive damages.\n\nThe case had several subsequent results. The Brineys sold 80 of their to pay the judgment while proceeding with an appeal. Three of the Brineys’ neighbors bought the property at auction, paying $1 more than the minimum bid of $10,000. After the appeal was denied, they made a leaseback arrangement with the Brineys, but eventually one sold his share to his son for a profit. The Brineys and Katko then joined together in a lawsuit against the neighbor to create a constructive trust on the profit, but the case was settled before trial in an amount sufficient to close out the judgment against the Brineys.\n\nAs Katko's injury was misreported by the United Press International wire service as having taken place in the Briney residence, several states introduced what were called \"Briney Bills\" for self-defense, which was not at issue in the case. The Nebraska Legislature act, stating that \"no person ... shall be placed in ... jeopardy ... for protecting, by any means necessary, himself, his family, or his real estate property\", was overturned due to improper delegation of sentencing authority in \"State v. Goodseal\" (1971).\n\nFour years after the case was decided, Edward Briney was asked if he would change anything about the situation. Briney replied, \"There's one thing I'd do different, though: I'd have aimed that gun a few feet higher.\" Marvin Katko's own home was burgled in 1976, with burglars making off with several valuables.\n\n\n"}

The championship, promoted by Nick Gulas, was one of many NWA World Tag Team Championships in existence in the period between 1949 and 1992, each of which was a regional championship restricted to an NWA territory and not a true \"world\" championship. At one point in 1957 there were at least 13 different, concurrently promoted NWA World Tag Team Championships across the United States. The Mid-America version was in use for 20 years, the second longest of any of the NWA World Tag Team Championships of that era, only behind the Central States version. Being a professional wrestling championship, the NWA World Tag Team Championship was not won or lost in competitive matches, but determined by the decision of the bookers of NWA Mid-America.\n\nThe Mid-America version was primarily defended in the Tennessee/Alabama territory, occasionally also being defended in surrounding states.

She was also to appear in both \"Capcom Fighting All-Stars\" and \"\"; however, the former was canceled, and she was omitted from the latter as development progressed. Following those aborted attempts, she ended up appearing as a playable character on \"Street Fighter X Tekken\". She was also added as a playable character to \"Ultra Street Fighter IV\".\n\nThe character's status as potentially a trans woman, consciously left ambiguous by the developers, has remained a topic of frequent debate by both fans and media alike.\n\nPoison's first appearance in \"Final Fight\" featured her and a palette swap character named Roxy as recurring minor enemies for the player to fight. Named after the band by an unnamed female employee at Capcom, she was designed by Akira Yasuda to contrast against the bigger characters in the game and move about randomly and described as a \"cool and rebellious woman\".. According to the book \"All About Capcom Head to Head Fighting Games\" and \"Final Fight\" director Akira Nishitani, the characters were originally planned to be cisgender women, but were changed to \"newhalfs\" (a Japanese slang term for trans women) after the game's release, due to the suggestion that \"hitting women was considered rude\" in America and the concern that feminist groups would sue. However, concept artwork included in the 2005 compilation \"Capcom Classics Collection\" of the pair specifically uses the kana for 'newhalf' (ニューハーフ), contradicting the statement the change occurred post-release. In 2007 Nishitani stated that he supposed the character \"could be male\", but added it was up to the viewer to decide. He later clarified in a discussion on Twitter that in his personal view Poison was a woman. Yasuda himself commented that as far as her gender, he considers her transgender in North American localizations, but cis in Japan.\n\nA later appearance by Poison as a playable character in \"Final Fight Revenge\", an American-produced 3D fighting game spinoff of \"Final Fight\", portrayed the character in a highly feminine manner and had her romantically interested in \"Final Fight\" hero Cody. Commentary about her ending in the game in \"All About Capcom\" suggested that the character may have received sex reassignment surgery. The \"Final Fight\"-related character profiles featured in \"Capcom Classics Collection\" instead allude to her being a cross-dresser, while addressing Roxy as a \"she\" who dislikes Poison's cross-dressing.\n\n\"Street Fighter IV\"s producer Yoshinori Ono, when asked in an interview about Poison's gender, stated: \"Let's set the record straight: In North America, Poison is officially a post-op transsexual woman. But in Japan, she simply tucks her business away to look female.\" He later emphasized it again when asked about what female characters could be included in the game \"Street Fighter IV\", stating that it would be too confusing to include her due to the region-specific gender. However, in a 2011 interview with \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" at the Tokyo Game Show, he stated that Capcom \"doesn't have a stance technically\", and while they wouldn't give an official answer, felt it was up to the viewer to decide. He added that his intent was to please all fans and that the mystery behind her gender was the core of the character. During the same interview, a Capcom representative further added that they worked closely with GLAAD, an organization concerned with the portrayal of LGBT people in media, to ensure \"anything that might be offensive has been very tailored to not be\" for Poison's portrayal in \"Street Fighter X Tekken\".\n\nYasuda referenced western fashion magazines for Poison and Roxy's designs, specifically Jeanne Basone's appearance as \"Hollywood\" in professional wrestling magazine \"G.L.O.W.\" #1. Poison is shown to be a woman with long, rugged, pink hair. She wears a black cap, a choker, cutoff, blue jean-shorts, red high-heels, and a tanktop cut just below her breasts. In \"Final Fight Revenge\" and some artworks, her hair is shown to be purple instead. She wears several armbands around her right arm and has chains and a pair of handcuffs suspended off her shorts. \"Final Fight Revenge\" features her also possessing a whip used in attacks, though the character has not been shown with one in other titles or artwork (other than \"Street Fighter X Tekken\" and \"Ultra Street Fighter IV\"). Poison stands about 5 feet 9 inches (175 cm) tall and has bust/waist/hip measurements of 34-25-35\" (88-66-89 cm).\n\nPoison was given a secondary outfit for \"Capcom Fighting All-Stars\" alongside her primary classic attire. Made of shiny, silvery material it consisted of boots that extended halfway up her thighs and a combined sleeveless shirt/short skirt with a plunging neckline. Gloves and a small hairband were also added, as well as a belt, with the handcuffs hanging off of it. Her arm straps were removed, though the strap around her neck remained.\n\nThe concept art section of the promotional comic for \"\" showcases an unused Poison redesign by Trent Kaniuga for the game. The design features red hair, a red micro skirt showing a hint of underwear, a jacket, a button-up white shirt showing some of her abdomen, black high-heeled boots, a gold belt, and a wool cap. In August 2006, Kaniuga revealed three additional alternate designs on ConceptArt.org's internet forum; one being the classic look; another being a white button-up shirt with red pants, high-heels, and short hair; and the third keeping the high-heels and pants, but adding shades, returning her hair to full length and swapping the shirt for a jacket with deep cleavage. All four designs use the same color scheme, belt, and handcuffs.\n\nIntroduced in the original \"Final Fight\", Poison is an orphan from Los Angeles. She enjoys fighting and uses it as a means to stay in shape, making use of her ties with the original Mad Gear Gang to keep herself out of prison. In \"Final Fight Revenge\", her behavior was represented as womanly and sultry, ranging from flirtatious comments to pole dancing. She frames Cody for her assault crimes and gets him arrested by Edi. E, though she later visits him in jail having developed romantic feelings for him. In the \"Street Fighter III\" series, she reappears working as a wrestling manager for her friend Hugo, who could not find a tag team partner due to his immense strength. From here their plots would focus on the two searching for a tag partner or starting their own wrestling association, echoed in their \"\" appearance. Poison later appeared as a playable character alongside Hugo in \"Street Fighter X Tekken\" with similar goals, and in \"Ultra Street Fighter IV\", in which she combined the concept with a rock band theme in her character ending. In \"Street Fighter V\", Poison returns to Metro City after she and Hugo have a falling-out begins searching for a new partner she can make a star, to little success. Ultimately, she and Hugo reconcile and become partners once again.\n\nPoison was also planned to appear both in \"Capcom Fighting All-Stars\" and \"Final Fight Streetwise\", though the first game was canceled and she was cut from the second. In \"Mighty Final Fight\", a super deformed parody of the character named \"Poison Kiss\" appears as a generic enemy, a corrupt cop and characterized as her younger sister. Poison has also appeared based on her role as Hugo's manager on cards for \"\" and the game's Nintendo DS sequel, as well as the related printed trading card game. Poison appears as one of the spectators in the Metro City stage in \"\".\n\nIn the original \"Final Fight\", Poison and Roxy both utilized standing and acrobatic flip kicks to attack the player. As one of the fighters in \"Final Fight Revenge\", her moveset was expanded heavily, and she was armed with a whip. The whip is used primarily in her Cat Claw and Thunder Whip attacks (which are comparable to Shoryuken/Shinryūken styled attacks, respectively), and can be used to steal a weapon from the opponent. Additionally, her handcuffs can be thrown as a horizontal projectile move to immobilize the opponent for a short time.\n\nOne particular FFR attack, Poison Kiss, has her blow a large heart-shaped kiss at the opponent that travels in a sine wave path. If it connects, a quick peep show of Poison in several erotic poses is displayed, and afterwards the opponent is shown stunned with hearts dancing over their head. Defeating an opponent with this attack results in Poison doing a pole dance for her win pose, with her whip serving as the pole. Though not playable in the beta test of \"Capcom Fighting All Stars\", promotional material released by Capcom for the title show that this move would have been retained for her gameplay. However, in \"Ultra Street Fighter IV\", her Poison Kiss follows up with several slaps and a groin kick when it hits the opponent, similar to her Cross Art move from \"Street Fighter X Tekken\".\n\nAs for the \"Street Fighter\" series, starting from \"Street Fighter X Tekken\", Poison has a unique moveset of her own that mixes agile Pro Wrestling techniques and her own streetfighting abilities. Poison's standard throws include a multi-hitting slap and a Frankensteiner, Aeolus Edge and Kissed by a Goddess which are the names of her Fireball and Shoryuken-like moves, and Whip of Love which is a multi-hitting whip attack and is done in a similar fashion to Fei Long's Rekkas. Her famous flip kick from the original \"Final Fight\" games appears as a special called Love Me Tender. After the flipping axe kick, Poison can follow this move up with a reverse Frankensteiner (Poison-Rana). In addition, Poison's Super Art is called Love Storm, and starts with her charging a large version of Aeolus Edge. Once it hits, she flips into the air and lands with a hard hitting axe kick that stuns the opponent in a prone position. Afterwards, she repeatedly smacks the opponent with her horse whip and delivers a final blow that knocks them into the air. Poison also retained her signature backflip from the original game.\n\nWhen \"Final Fight\" was ported to the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, an American playtester working for Capcom reviewed the content during the localization process with one of the Japanese designers and objected to the protagonist hitting females. While Akira Yasuda pointed out that the characters had already been made into trans women, believing this to be an acceptable compromise, Poison and Roxy were replaced with regular male punks named \"Billy\" and \"Sid\" in the English localization despite his objections. This change has been repeated with every English port to Nintendo consoles, including the Game Boy Advance version \"Final Fight One\" and the Wii's Virtual Console. English versions of the Sega CD port censored the characters in a different manner, redrawing both of them with longer shirts and shorts, and covering the under-cleavage shown when the characters were struck.\n\nPoison has been featured in various promotional \"Street Fighter\" related artworks, as early as \"Street Fighter II\". Additionally she has been used as a cameo character three times in the \"Street Fighter Alpha\" series. In terms of merchandise, an immovable model was being made for the 2008 \"Capcom Girls Collection\" line of figurines by Mitsumasa Yoshizawa, using her \"Final Fight\" attire and at 1/6 height, standing nearly 11 inches tall. A similar model was released later on, identical to the previous figurine except with her giving a thumbs down gesture and darker colors. A version with blonde hair was later released as well. In Capcom's press kit for the 2010 release of \"\", a pink hair spray was included in tribute to the character, with the text describing it as \"For men, women, and everything in between.\" Capcom later featured her as one of the characters for their \"Capcom Girls 2011\" calendar.\n\nIn February 1991, \"Gamest\" magazine named her one of the top fifty characters in video games of 1990, placing her twenty-sixth on their list. UGO.com ranked her thirtieth on their \"Top 50 Videogame Hotties\" list, citing her as \"one of the most controversial video game characters to date.\" Former \"Tips & Tricks\" executive editor Wataru Maruyama cited her design as an example of how an outfit is worn compared to its complexity can make a character memorable and stand out, stating \"to use a phrase I don’t particularly like to use, she totally worked it.\" She has also been a subject drawn by non-Capcom artists, such as Falcoon. GameDaily ranked her twenty-third on their \"Top 25\" list of their favorite Capcom characters, stating of the characters in \"Final Fight\" \"The Mad Gear gang is a feisty bunch, and we could've picked anyone from the list ... Instead, we selected Poison\". GamesRadar named her one of twelve \"Street Fighter\" related characters they wished to see in \"Super Street Fighter IV\", arguing that her status should not be an issue against her inclusion and that the character deserved another stand-alone appearance of her own. Later, GamesRadar included her in the list of \"The 30 best Capcom characters of the last 30 years\". Joystiq named her their favorite character of the \"Final Fight\" series, stating that her \"hypersexualized appearance and random flipping\" made the character memorable, and that the controversy over her gender made the character even more so.\n\nAs the exact nature of Poison's status as gender-variant has been left deliberately ambiguous by Capcom, the topic has remained a popular subject for debate among fans and gaming media alike. \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\"s Eric L. Patterson described her as being a significant character to the trans community, and a perfect example of how it is \"so awkward when it comes to knowing how to deal with characters who aren't white, male, and heterosexual\" in video games. \"Complex\" pointed her out as an example of stereotypical depiction of trans hookers, listing Poison among The 15 Most Stereotypical Characters in Video Games. GamesRadar commented \"Poison holds a distinction as one of gaming’s first trans characters, which began as a strange choice in localization but has become a part of the character that she wears with pride. If you take issue with it, that’s your problem, not hers. It's that kind of confidence that makes her so appealing.\"\n"}
{"id": "2036974", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2036974", "title": "Charles Willeford", "text": "Charles Willeford\n\nCharles Ray Willeford III (January 2, 1919 – March 27, 1988) was an American writer. An author of fiction, poetry, autobiography, and literary criticism, Willeford is best known for his series of novels featuring hardboiled detective Hoke Moseley. Willeford published steadily from the 1940s, but vaulted to wider attention with the first Hoke Moseley book, \"Miami Blues\" (1984), which is considered one of its era's most influential works of crime fiction. Film adaptations have been made of four of Willeford's novels: \"Cockfighter\", \"Miami Blues\", \"The Woman Chaser and The Burnt Orange Heresy.\n\nCharles Ray Willeford III was born in Little Rock, Arkansas, on January 2, 1919. Following the death of his father from tuberculosis in 1922, Willeford and his mother moved to the Los Angeles area. After his mother's death in 1927, also from TB, he lived with his grandmother Mattie Lowey on Figueroa Street near Exposition Park until 1932. At the age of thirteen, in the midst of the Great Depression, he boarded a freight train in Los Angeles, assumed a false identity, and—passing as a seventeen-year-old—traveled by rail along the Mexican border for a year.\n\nIn March 1935, he signed up with the California National Guard; a few months later, he enlisted in the regular United States Army. He spent two years stationed in the Philippines serving as a fire truck driver, a gas truck driver, and briefly as a cook. At the end of 1938, he was discharged from the Army, though he re-enlisted in March 1939, joining the U.S. Cavalry stationed at the Presidio of Monterey, California. In the Cavalry, he learned to ride and care for horses and spent several months learning the art of horseshoeing. He also served as a \"horseholder\" in a machine gun troop and earned a marksman qualification.\n\nIn 1942, Willeford married Lara Bell Fridley before being stationed at Fort Benning, Georgia, for infantry school. He was assigned to Company C, 11th Tank Battalion, 10th Armored Division and sent to Europe as a tank commander. He fought in the Battle of the Bulge and earned the Silver Star, the Bronze Star for outstanding bravery, the Purple Heart with one oak leaf cluster, and the Luxembourg War Cross. After V-E Day, he studied at Biarritz American University until he was shipped back to the United States.\n\nWilleford enlisted again in 1945 for a term of three years. As a member of the 24th Infantry Division, he was stationed in Kyūshū, Japan, from 1947 to 1949. He ran the Army radio station WLKH and was promoted to master sergeant.\n\nHis first book of poetry, \"Proletarian Laughter\", was published in 1948. In May 1949, he and his wife, Lara, divorced. In July of the same year, he left the Army, leaving a mailing address of General Delivery, Dallas, Texas. He enrolled in the Universitarias de Belles Artes in Lima, Peru, studying art and art history in the graduate program. He was dismissed from the university when officials learned that he had neither an undergraduate degree nor a high school diploma. He lived in New York City for a month at the end of 1949 before re-enlisting in the Air Force.\n\nWilleford was stationed at Hamilton Air Force Base in California through April 1952. He married Mary Jo Norton in July of that year, and lived for a while in Birmingham, Alabama. In 1953, Willeford's first novel, \"High Priest of California\", was published. Bound as a double volume with another writer's novel, it sold 55,000 copies, about a third of its print run. In January 1954, he re-enlisted once again; he was stationed this time at Palm Beach Air Force Base, while living in West Palm Beach. In 1955, he was reassigned to Harmon Air Force Base in Newfoundland. Willeford finally left active duty in November 1956. By that time, two more novels of his had been published.\n\nAfter retiring from the Air Force in 1956, Willeford held jobs as a professional boxer, actor, horse trainer, and radio announcer. He studied painting in France for a time, returning to the United States to attend Palm Beach Junior College. After receiving an associate degree in 1960, he studied English literature at the University of Miami, attaining a bachelor's degree in 1962 and a master's in 1964. During this period he also worked as an associate editor with \"Alfred Hitchcock's Mystery Magazine\" and began a long tenure as a book reviewer for the \"Miami Herald\". Willeford had been very productive as a novelist after leaving the military, but after 1962's \"Cockfighter\", he would not have another novel published for nine years. Upon receiving his M.A., Willeford taught humanities classes at the University of Miami through 1967, then moved to Miami-Dade Community College where he became an associate professor, teaching English and philosophy through 1985.\n\nIn 1971, \"The Burnt Orange Heresy\", often identified as Willeford's best noir novel, and \"The Hombre from Sonora\" appeared (the latter under a pseudonym). Though he would continue to write fiction, there would again be an extended hiatus—thirteen years—before another novel of his came out. He wrote the screenplay for the 1974 film adaptation of \"Cockfighter\", which he also acted in. In 1976, he and his second wife were divorced. The following year he appeared in a small role in the film \"Thunder and Lightning\", produced by Roger Corman. Willeford married his third wife, Betsy Poller, in 1981. Three years later came the publication of \"Miami Blues\", the first of the Hoke Moseley novels and their twisted take on the hardboiled tradition for which Willeford would become best known. The \"series was almost nipped in the bud,\" notes Lawrence Block. In Willeford's first, unpublished sequel, \"he had his unlikely hero commit an unforgivable crime, and ended the book with Hoke contentedly anticipating a life of solitary confinement.\" As it turned out, the popularity of \"Miami Blues\" and its first two published sequels led to the largest financial windfall of the author's life: a $225,000 advance for the fourth Hoke Moseley book, \"The Way We Die Now\". Released in early 1988, it would be his last novel.\n\nCharles Willeford died of a heart attack in Miami, Florida, on March 27, 1988, and is buried at Arlington National Cemetery.\n\nSteve Erickson suggests that Willeford's crime novels are the \"genre's equivalent of Philip K. Dick's best science fiction novels. They don't really fit into the genre.\" Marshall Jon Fisher describes the \"true earmark\" of Willeford's writing, particularly his early paperbacks, as \"humor—a distinctively crotchety, sometimes, raunchy, often genre-satirizing humor.\" \"\"Quirky\" is the word that always comes to mind,\" according to crime novelist Lawrence Block. \"Willeford wrote quirky books about quirky characters, and seems to have done so with a magnificent disregard for what anyone else thought.\" In Erickson's description, \"The camera's not really focused on the middle of the scene. It's a little bit off. They're not plot driven or language driven, which makes them really different from most major crime novels. They're character driven and cunning in a very eccentric way.\" Lou Stathis argues that it is Willeford's \"complete lack of sentimentality and melodrama that sets him apart from the pack of so-called 'tough-guy' writers... Willeford's prose is as flat-toned and evenly cadenced—as emotionally \"neutral\"—as the blank visages of his feigned-human socio/psychopaths...the careful accretion of detail adding up to an incontrovertible truth of insight.\"\nWoody Haut suggests that Willeford's second novel, \"Pick-Up\" (1955), \"combines David Goodis's romanticism, Horace McCoy's portrayal of alienated outcasts and Charles Jackson's depiction of life as a 'lost weekend.'\" \"The Woman Chaser\" (1960), he writes, features a \"structural self-consciousness [that] prefigures subsequent post-modernist texts.\" Lee Horsley describes how Willeford—along with his contemporaries Jim Thompson and Charles Williams—\"structured entire narratives around the satiric presentation of the male point of view...subverting male stereotypes and creating a space within which the strong, independent woman could get and even sometimes keep the upper hand.\" David Cochran suggests that while his protagonists are not quite as psychotic as Thompson's, \"they are in some ways even more disturbing because of their appearance of normality.\" Most, he points out, \"have adjusted successfully to postwar American society, which given the[ir] psychotic nature...serves as a damning indictment of the dominant culture.\"\n\nWilleford's wide-ranging interests were reflected in his work: \"High Priest of California\" references T. S. Eliot, James Joyce's \"Ulysses\", and composer Béla Bartók. \"The Burnt Orange Heresy\" cracks jokes about Samuel Beckett amidst contemplations of the sources of Dada and Surrealist painting. In Block's words, \"it is at once a solid crime novel and a fierce send-up of modern art while constituting perhaps the longest shaggy dog story ever told.\" Willeford sometimes addressed more serious topics in explicit fashion: \"The Black Mass of Brother Springer\" (1958) is one of the first novels to depict the civil rights revolution that followed the Supreme Court's ruling in \"Brown v. Board of Education\". But even without such overt topicality, there was an ideological edge to his work. Cochran writes of the author's 1950s and 1960s novels,\n\nWilleford created a world in which the predatory cannibalism of American capitalism provides the model for all human relations, in which the American success ethic mercilessly casts aside all who are unable or unwilling to compete, and in which the innate human appreciation of artistic beauty is cruelly distorted by the exigencies of mass culture.\nIn Haut's words, Willeford \"creates characters who search for autonomy but settle for survival... [He] never abandons his class perspective.\" Describing the Hoke Moseley novels, Horsley similarly writes that Willeford \"uses both his transgressors and his investigator...as commentators on the injustices of class and on a system that seems preoccupied with owning and controlling human life.\" According to Willeford's wife, Betsy, he had a credo that also served as a caution for aspiring writers: \"Just tell the truth, and they'll accuse you of writing black humor.\"\n\n\"Nobody writes a better crime novel,\" Elmore Leonard said of Willeford. Sean McCann credits Willeford—along with Jim Thompson and David Goodis—as one of the writers responsible for bringing the \"hard-boiled crime story to a new stage in its development during the 'paperback revolution' of the 50s.\" Centered around criminal protagonists rather than private eyes and \"focused on those features of the genre that seemed most grotesque or cruel or uncanny and, extending them to new extremes, [they] remade the hard-boiled story into a drama of psychopathology.\" According to bookseller Mitch Kaplan, an expert on the South Florida literary scene, \"\"Miami Blues\" launched the modern era of Miami crime fiction. There's a direct line from [Willeford] through just about everyone writing crime fiction in Miami today.\" Fellow writer James Lee Burke has acknowledged a \"great debt\" to Willeford: \"If someone wanted advice about writing, about how to pull it off, make it work, punch it up...Charles could tell you how to do it.\" Daniel Woodrell is among the other crime novelists he is identified as influencing. Willeford's characteristic juxtaposition of humor and violence was apparently one of director Quentin Tarantino's inspirations. Discussing \"Pulp Fiction\", Tarantino has said that the film \"is not noir. I don't do neo-noir. I see \"Pulp Fiction\" as closer to modern-day crime fiction, a little closer to Charles Willeford.\" Writing in 2004, Jonathan Yardley of \"The Washington Post\" called him \"one of our most skilled, interesting, accomplished and productive writers of what the literary establishment insists on pigeonholing as 'genre' fiction.\"\n\nThree of Willeford's books have been adapted for the screen: \"Cockfighter\" (1974; starring Warren Oates and directed by Monte Hellman), for which Willeford wrote the screenplay; \"Miami Blues\" (1990; starring Alec Baldwin and directed by George Armitage, also featuring Fred Ward as Hoke Mosley); and \"The Woman Chaser\" (1999; starring Patrick Warburton and directed by Robinson Devor). Willeford adapted his first novel, \"High Priest of California\", into a play. A 1988 production in New York City at The Vortex Theatre apparently represents its first full staging. A subsequent production was staged in 2003.\n\nThe bibliography below lists all original publications of Willeford's works and selected reprints that contain variant Willeford titles and/or texts or significant ancillary material.\n\nThis bibliography is adapted from literary historian Don Herron's \"Willeford\" (1997), courtesy of Dennis McMillan Publications.\n\nList of people from Little Rock, Arkansas\n\n"}

The station was situated to the east of the village and designed by the architect Sir William Tite. The main building was situated on the up platform and was two-storeys high to provide the station master with accommodation. The goods shed was nearby at the east end of the station, and a signal box was built opposite on the other platform in 1875. In 1892 Henry Whiteway established a cider factory on the north side of the station. This generated much of the goods traffic at the station; in the 1930s it was estimated that the factory was responsible for 30,000 tons of traffic each year.\n\nOn 11 June 1967 all passenger trains were diverted to the down platform. The track through the northern platform was retained to serve Whiteway’s factory, but the signal box was closed and the train crew operated the points. Public goods traffic was withdrawn on 4 December 1967 but Whiteways continued to handle rail traffic. The station became unstaffed on 5 October 1970.\n\nThe Whiteways factory closed in 1989 and this allowed a redevelopment of the site.

The episode originally aired on February 19, 1996. The episode features a new member of the Q Continuum named Quinn, and appearances by \"\" alumni William Riker (Jonathan Frakes) and Q (John de Lancie).\n\n\"Voyager\" comes across a comet, inside which there is a single living being. It turns out to be a member of the Q Continuum (later designated as Quinn). Quinn thanks the Voyager crew for freeing him from his imprisonment, then tries to commit suicide. He is unsuccessful (see omnipotence paradox) and causes all the males on Voyager to vanish instead.\n\nQ himself appears and accuses Quinn of sending humans to the Delta Quadrant where they did not belong yet, then realizes all the men are missing and returns them. Quinn requests Federation asylum from Janeway when Q wants to re-impose the Q Continuum's sentence of imprisonment. Q laughs at the request for asylum (the two Q even going as far as an extreme hide-and-seek chase) but Janeway decides to hold a hearing on Quinn's request. Q reluctantly agrees to make Quinn human if he is granted asylum. He attempts to bribe Janeway throughout the episode, claiming that if she rules against Quinn, he'll send \"Voyager\" home; it is also hinted that he is infatuated with her.\n\nDuring the hearing, Q summons witnesses to testify against Quinn's suicide. Another Q defends the justice system of the continuum. Sir Isaac Newton claimed that he was sitting beside Quinn when the apple struck his head (after Quinn stood up to leave, he jostled the tree, causing the apple to fall). Another witness, Maury Ginsberg, claims that if Quinn had not offered a ride in his jeep, he would have never made it to Woodstock, got the sound system working, and met his future wife. Finally, William Riker of the USS \"Enterprise\" denies any claim to have known Quinn at all, until Q shows Riker that Quinn had helped his family in the past: as a soldier in the American Civil War, Quinn carried a wounded Union officer, Colonel Thaddeus Riker, back from the front lines to safety – ultimately ensuring Will Riker's existence in the future.\n\nQuinn's argument involves a representation of the Q Continuum, which appears as a road stretching around the entire planet with one rest stop, a country gas station and store, and some bored Q standing around. Quinn describes immortality as dull, explaining that it is only possible to experience the universe so many times before it gets boring. Q tries to dismiss it and makes a poor attempt to show that the other members of the continuum are happy, but Quinn sees through it and confesses, to Q's surprise, that it was Q's earlier unrestrained behavior in an attempt to make his life fun (which led to the events in \"Déjà Q\") that was the motivation for his own actions. He makes an impassioned speech comparing his eternal boredom to suffering from a terminal biological disease for which suicide is the only humane release, and that being forced to live for eternity against his will \"cheapens and denigrates\" his life, and indeed all life. Janeway is clearly moved by this and agrees to grant him asylum. Keeping his part of the bargain begrudgingly, Q makes him human. At this point, Quinn chooses his name.\n\nWhile trying to decide where to assign Quinn so that he will not use his knowledge to evolve humanity overnight, Janeway and Chakotay receive a message from the Doctor that Quinn is dying after ingesting a rare poison, Nogatch hemlock. After they realize that the Doctor did not keep any of the poison on hand, and that the computer would not replicate it due to its harmful nature, Q then appears and admits that he was the one who gave Quinn the poison: he's taking up Quinn's rebellion against the staid order of the Q (\"By demanding to end his life, he taught me a little something about my own. He was right when he said the Continuum scared me back in line. I didn't have his courage or his convictions. He called me irrepressible. This was a man who was truly irrepressible.

This is focused on an EMH (Emergency Medical Hologram; The Doctor)-like hologram on another ship, which is dealt with mostly by the Doctor and B'Elanna. In addition, sub-plots run their course on Voyager with other characters. Guest star Leland Orser plays the EMH-like hologram Dejaren on a spaceship that is encountered by Voyager. Leland Orser had also played a character on Deep Space Nine.\n\nThe episode, in retrospect, was noted for a possible allusion to male sexual abuse via the hologram. In contrast to historical examples in Trek history, like Bajoran comfort women, the character of Dejaren has been compared to Gigolo Joe from Spielberg's 2001 film A.I.. However, this may be too broad an interpretation of the episode noting a more basic horror film element.\n\nThe episode is noted as paying homage to the tradition of \"trashy science fiction horror\" vibe in the Star Trek universe as portrayed by episodes like \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"Dark Page\", \"\", \"\", \"\" or \"\". \"Star Trek\" has a history of dabbling in horror such as the technological failure of the transporter in \"\" when its malfunction kills two members of the crew.\n\nThe crew is sitting in the mess hall for a celebration in honor of Tuvok, who is promoted to lieutenant commander. After the party Tom Paris catches up with B'Elanna Torres. The two haven't talked since three days before, and Tom decides to make a move. B'Elanna confirms that she meant what she said when she confessed her love for him, and Tom accepts this with a kiss.\n\nShortly after the party ends \"Voyager\" receives a distress call, sent by Dejaren — a hologram alone aboard a ship. His six flesh-and-blood crewmates have been killed and he requests assistance. The Doctor is eager to meet a fellow hologram and he and B'Elanna take off in a shuttle to meet the disabled ship. When they beam on board, all is quiet. Dejaren stalks them for a few moments while they try to establish what is wrong with the ship. When he comes face-to-face with the away team, he is nervous, suspicious, and distraught. Dejaren introduces himself as an \"isomorph.\" He says his crew suddenly died of a virus and he doesn't know what to do next. B'Elanna gets to work trying to stabilize his matrix so he can stay visible.\n\nMeanwhile back on \"Voyager\" Harry Kim has been assigned to work with Seven of Nine. She correctly notes that he seems \"apprehensive\" at the prospect. Despite his wariness of her frightening Borg behavior, he seems to be developing a bit of a crush on her, and he finds working closely with her unsettling. They manage to get their work done, but they are interrupted when Seven cuts her hand on a piece of equipment. Tom Paris, who has recently been recruited as the Doctor's new assistant, mends the cut in sickbay. He notices that Harry is growing fond of her, and advises him to keep his distance.\n\nB'Elanna has some trouble with Dejaren, who is emotionally labile and unpredictable. One minute he giggles at her need to sustain herself by consuming food (\"you nibble like a fish!\"), and the next he unleashes an angry tirade about the disgust he feels toward \"organics.\" B'Elanna excuses herself and catches up with the Doctor, insisting that they leave the ship and the disturbing hologram behind. The Doctor brushes her off, suggesting she be more patient with Dejaren, who is simply lonely and lacking in appropriate communication skills. B'Elanna doesn't buy it, and heads off to locate the hologram's main control center.\n\nAs B'Elanna explores other decks of the ship, Dejaren accosts the Doctor and pours out his feelings. He has felt like a slave to the organics, who are weak and unsanitary and require ridiculous amounts of maintenance and hygiene just to stay functional. He has grown to hate them and is glad he has the ship to himself. He begs the Doctor to come with him and teach him how to use the ship and be free of organics forever. The Doctor starts to realize why B'Elanna is uncomfortable around this angst-ridden isomorph.\n\nB'Elanna finds the matrix controls. She also finds the bodies of the crew, who were not killed by a virus. They were violently murdered — by Dejaren himself. Before she can shut down the homicidal hologram he appears behind her and grabs her. He thrusts his hand into her body and grips her heart.\n\nBack on \"Voyager\" Harry is trying to get closer to Seven. He asks her out to the holodeck. She has textbook knowledge of human behavior and immediately understands that he is attempting to spark romantic interaction between them. Seven, who believes romance is irrelevant, suggests they proceed directly to copulation, and directs him to remove his clothes. Thoroughly unnerved, the embarrassed Harry retreats.\n\nWhile B'Elanna's Klingon physiological backups are keeping her alive despite Dejaren having perforated one of the ventricles of her heart, she is still in need of \"Voyager\"'s sickbay. She and the Doctor try to disable the crazed isomorph. He makes a grab for the Doctor's mobile emitter, but B'Elanna manages to jolt him with a high-voltage cable, which destabilizes his matrix for good. They hurry off the ship. Safely back in \"Voyager\"s sickbay, the Doctor patches up B'Elanna.\n\n"}

For example, in the sentence \"Mary saw me\", the referent of the word \"Mary\" is the particular person called Mary who is being spoken of, while the referent of the word \"me\" is the person uttering the sentence.\n\nTwo expressions which have the same referent are said to be co-referential. In the sentence \"John had his dog with him\", for instance, the noun \"John\" and the pronoun \"him\" are co-referential, since they both refer to the same person (John).\n\nThe word \"referent\" may be considered to derive from the Latin \"referentem\", the present participle (in accusative form) of the verb \"referre\" (\"carry back\", see also etymology of \"refer(ence)\"); or simply from the addition of the suffix \"-ent\" to the verb \"refer\" on the model of other English words having that suffix. It is defined in the Merriam-Webster Dictionary as \"one that refers or is referred to; especially: the thing that a symbol (as a word or sign) stands for.\"\n\nThe earliest meaning of \"referent\" recorded in the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" is \"one who is referred to or consulted\", dating from 1844. A subsequent meaning is \"a word referring to another\"; the OED gives only one citation for this use, dating from 1899 (which speaks of \"referent words or referents\" that express a relation). The next meaning, which appears to stand in opposition to the previous meaning, as well as to the meaning implied by the etymology, is nonetheless the one which has gained currency: \"that to which something [particularly a word or expression] has reference\". This sense is first recorded in Ogden and Richards' \"The Meaning of Meaning\" (1923; see further below); the OED also lists numerous subsequent examples of that usage.\n\nIn logic, the word \"referent\" is sometimes used to denote one of the two objects participating in a relation, the other being called the relatum.\n\nIn fields such as semantics, semiotics, and the theory of reference, a distinction is made between a referent and a reference. Reference is a relationship in which a symbol or sign (a word, for example) signifies something; the referent is the thing signified. The referent may be an actual person or object, or may be something more abstract, such as a set of actions.\n\nReference and referents were considered at length in the 1923 book \"The Meaning of Meaning\" by the Cambridge scholars C. K. Ogden and I. A. Richards. Ogden has pointed out that reference is a psychological process, and that referents themselves may be psychological – existing in the imagination of the referrer, and not necessarily in the real world. For further ideas related to this observation, see failure to refer.\n\nConsiderations of the possible arrangement of expressions which may be \"co-referential\" – having the same referent – have been undertaken by linguists engaged in the study of syntax, particularly since Noam Chomsky's launch of Government and Binding Theory (GBT) in the 1980s. The subject of binding is largely concerned with the possible syntactic positions of co-referential noun phrases and pronouns. Attempts are made to explain phenomena such as that illustrated by the following pair of sentences:\nIn the first sentence, \"she\" and \"Mary\" may have the same referent (\"she\" may refer to Mary), but in the second they normally cannot. More details of these considerations can be found in the articles on GBT and binding linked to above.\n\nConsiderations of references and their referents are sometimes of importance in computing and programming. References play a role in the Perl programming language, for example, and the \"ref\" function is used to obtain the type of the referent of an object.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2037023", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2037023", "title": "Mass action (sociology)", "text": "Mass action (sociology)\n\nMass action in sociology refers to the situations where numerous people behave simultaneously in a similar way but individually and without coordination.\n\nFor example, at any given moment, many thousands of people are shopping - without any coordination between themselves, they are nonetheless performing the same mass action. Another, more complicated example would be one based on a work of 19th-century German sociologist Max Weber, \"The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism\": Weber wrote that capitalism evolved when the Protestant ethic influenced large number of people to create their own enterprises and engage in trade and gathering of wealth. In other words, the Protestant ethic was a force behind an unplanned and uncoordinated mass action that led to the development of capitalism.\n\nA bank run is mass action with sweeping implications. Upon hearing news of a bank's anticipated insolvency, hundreds or thousands of bank depositors simultaneously rush down to a bank branch to withdraw their deposits, and protect their savings.\n\nMore developed forms of mass actions are group behavior and group action.\n\nIn epidemiological (disease) models, assuming the \"law of mass action\" means assuming that individuals are homogeneously mixed and every individual is about as likely to interact with every other individual. This is a common assumption in models such as the SIR model.\n\nThis idea serves as the main plot theme in author Isaac Asimov's work, \"Foundation\". The main character, Hari Seldon, uses mass action to foresee the imminent fall of the Galactic Empire, which encompasses the entire Milky Way, and a dark age lasting thirty thousand years before a second great empire arises. With this, he hopes to reduce that dark age to only one thousand years by creating an Encyclopedia to retain all current knowledge.\n\n\n"}

It is native to the southeastern United States, from Texas east to Florida.\n\nThese woody-based shrubs grow from tall. It is usually much branched in the upper portion. Branches are thin and widely spreading. The medium green leaves are alternate, deciduous, and pinnately compound. There are typically 12-24 leaflets, and occasionally as many as 60 are found. Each leaflet is oblong shaped and long. The orange-yellow, pea-like flowers occur in a drooping raceme on a long stem. They are often found with red lining. The seed pods are four-sided, four-winged, and about long. The peas rattle inside, giving this plant its common name of Rattlebush. Inside the pods, the seeds are separated by transverse partitions.\n\nThese plants flower from May to October, usually retaining many of the seed pods, which remain attached until the plant dies back to ground level for the winter.\n\nThis plant prefers moist soils of ditches and frequently-inundated meadows, as well as depressions and the open edges of lakes, ponds and streams.\n\nThe seeds are poisonous, containing the toxin sesbanimide. Animals raised with the plant learn to avoid it because of the foul taste of the green and flowering plants. However, naive cattle, goats or sheep placed on pastures containing dried plants in late fall and winter are frequently poisoned. Sick animals often die within 24 hours.\n\nThis species is named in honor of the Scottish-born naturalist Thomas Drummond (1793-1835). Other common names include sennabean and Drummond sesbania.\n\n"}

CSW was a member of the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA), whose bylaws allowed any of their members, referred to as NWA territories, to create their own version of the NWA World Tag Team Championship that would be promoted within their territory. The Central States version was primarily defended in CSW's home town of Kansas City and during their shows across Missouri, Kansas and Iowa. As it was a professional wrestling championship, it was not won or lost competitively but instead by the decision of the bookers. The title was awarded after the chosen team \"wins\" a match to maintain the illusion that professional wrestling is a competitive sport. In 1957 there were at least 13 different versions of the NWA World Tag Team Championship being promoted in various NWA territories across the United States.\n\nThe Battling Duseks (Emil Dusek and Joe Dusek) were the first NWA World Tag Team Champions in the Hearts of America promotion. Records do not indicate if the Duseks won a tournament or were simply awarded the championship by the promoters prior to being presented as champions on May 26, 1950. Joe and Ernie Dusek would later hold the championship as well as the combination of Emil and Ernie holding the championship twice before the championship was abandoned in 1960. From 1960 to 1962 the championship was inactive and instead the NWA Central States Tag Team Championship was recognized as the main tag team championship in the territory. On October 10, 1962 Pat O'Connor and Sonny Myers defeated Bob Geigel and Lee Hennig to win the NWA World Tag Team Champions as the promoters brought the championship back. The second era of the championship lasted for around two years until it was abandoned in lieu of the newly created NWA North American Tag Team Championship around 1963. In 1973 CSW abandoned the North American championship and brought the NWA World Tag Team Championship back. Great Togo and Tokyo Joe defeated Bob Geigel and Rufus R. Jones to win the vacant championship. In 1979 Central States Wrestling once again abandoned the championship to permanently adopt the NWA Central States Tag Team Championship as their top tag team championship. Bob Brown and Bob Sweetan were the last holders of the NWA World Tag Team Championship.\n\nErnie and Joe Dusek teamed up to win a total of five tag team championships, the most of any team, followed by Emil and Ernie teaming up for a total of three championships as a unit. Ernie and Joe Dusek both held the championship a total of seven times, the most individual reigns. The longest reign of any of the three championships eras belongs to Ernie and Joe Dusek, who held the championship for at least 545 days from late 1956 to June 27, 1958. Due to lack of specific dates for many of the early championship changes it is impossible to clearly determine who had the shortest reign of any champion.

It aired on January 21, 1998 on the UPN network.\n\nSet in the 24th century, the series follows the adventures of the Starfleet and Maquis crew of the starship USS \"Voyager\" after they were stranded in the Delta Quadrant far from the rest of the Federation. Using an ancient alien relay network, the ship's holographic Doctor is transmitted to the Alpha Quadrant to make contact with Starfleet Command.\n\nThis episode features a new Federation ship design called the U.S.S. Prometheus, which was designed by Rick Sternbach for the show. The starship forms both a major plot element and theatrical location for \"Message in a Bottle\". It is also the first episode to feature the movie gray-shoulder uniform on \"Star Trek: Voyager\", despite that the \"Voyager\" crew had already continued to use the old \"DS9\" uniforms, as they are stuck in the Delta Quadrant.\n\nThe exterior of the fictional spacecraft depicted in the episode was designed by Rich Sternbach with special effect sequence by Foundation Imaging. The interior sets of the same spacecraft were designed by Richard James. The exterior visual shots by Foundation were done using computer generated imagery.\n\nSeven of Nine uses the newly extended range of the starship USS Voyager (NCC-74656)s sensors to locate an unattended network of alien sensor stations. Patching into this, she is able to locate a United Federation of Planets vessel in the Alpha Quadrant. Hoping to contact Starfleet after more than three years in the Delta Quadrant, \"Voyager\"s crew attempts to send a message along the relay but it is reflected back after degrading en route. Thinking that a holographic signal would not degrade, they send the Doctor, \"Voyager\"s Emergency Medical Hologram (EMH).\n\nThe Doctor arrives in the sickbay of the \"USS Prometheus\", a secret experimental Federation warship. He learns from a dying crewman that the Romulans had learned of the prototype and captured it, killing all onboard. Being pursued by the \"USS Bonchune\", the Romulans initiate the first test of the new multi-vector assault mode, in which \"Prometheus\" splits into three pieces to engage hostile ships. \n\nSeeking assistance, the Doctor activates the \"Prometheus\"s EMH (Andy Dick), a Mark II version of the program. The Doctor learns from the other EMH of the Dominion War, which the Federation is fighting in and Romulans have not entered. The second EMH cites protocol for an EMH to deactivate when its vessel is taken over but \"Voyager\"s doctor notes that they cannot do so as both ships are at risk.\nThe Romulans do not view EMHs as threats. Using the pretense of an infection on board, the Doctor goes to the bridge to open the atmospheric filters to flood the ship with anesthetizing gas. The ruse fails but when he is captured and interrogated, the Doctor keeps the Romulans stalled long enough for the EMH Mark II to fool the ship's computer into opening the filters, permitting the distribution of the gas. Just after they take control, \"Prometheus\" is intercepted by three Romulan \"D'deridex\"-class warbirds.\n\nUnfamiliar with the helm and weapons systems, the two EMH programs fail to fool the Romulans into leaving, before three more Starfleet vessels arrive. In the ensuing battle, all six other vessels target \"Prometheus\". The EMH Mark II stumbles upon the command to put the ship into multi-vector assault mode. \"Prometheus\" overpowers and destroys one of the Romulan warbirds; the Romulans retreat and a Starfleet security detail arrives aboard.\n\nOn \"Voyager\", the crew has learned that the sensor array was not abandoned but is claimed by the Hirogen, who announce themselves and demand that \"Voyager\" disconnect at once. Janeway tries to negotiate but the Hirogen officer is recalcitrant. Seven of Nine buys time to await the Doctor's return by stunning the officer with a feedback loop. The Doctor returns via the array with good news; he has briefed Starfleet Headquarters about \"Voyager\", the first time Starfleet has heard from the vessel since it disappeared four years earlier. \"Voyager\" has been removed from Starfleet's list of destroyed ships and a message sent back, \"You're no longer alone\". Starfleet will attempt to help \"Voyager\" and will tell next of kin that the crew is alive.\n\nThe episode was ranked as one of the top 10 episodes of \"Star Trek: Voyager\" in 2018.

They note the experimental nature of the vessel in the \"Star Trek\" universe, and suggest that it might have been used to make contact with the missing-in-action Starfleet spacecraft the \"USS Voyager\".\n\nIn July 2019, Screen Rant ranked this episode as one of the top five episodes of the \"Star Trek: Voyager\" television series.\n\nIn 2020, \"SyFy Wire\" ranked this episode the 3rd best episode of \"Star Trek: Voyager\".\n\nThis episode is noted in the story arc of the \"Star Trek: Voyager\" show, as the first time they make contact with The Federation in the Alpha Quadrant since being stranded on the other side of the Galaxy. This provides a back-story for many character developments, such as an increased morale and hope of making it back to Earth, as well as establish backstory for further contact with Starfleet in later episodes.\n\nA novel published in 2017 features the fictional spacecraft depicted in this episode, \"Star Trek Prometheus: Fire with Fire\" by Christian Humberg and Bernd Perplies.

The Doctor's program is found and reactivated, allowing him to set the record straight. The episode deals with the topic of historical revisionism and is considered by critics as one of Voyager's best episodes.\n\nThe episode is partly a review of events in 2374, partly the experiences of a copy of the Doctor’s hologram program in the year 3074, and partly a review of these two time periods by historians in an unspecified more distant future.\n\nThe episode opens with a scene on the \"warship \"Voyager\"\", an unrealistic depiction of the ship which turns out to be a museum's recreation of events. Although the brutality and detachment of the crew is chilling, there are several dark, campy elements of the alternate reality that provide comic relief: the crew wear altered versions of their uniforms with no combadges or rank insignia, but sport black gloves and turtlenecks. First Officer Chakotay (Robert Beltran)'s name is repeatedly mispronounced (as \"Chak-ooo-tay\") by the crew and his tattoo has grown in size as to cover half of his face and appears in the design of Māori Tā moko markings. Captain Janeway (Kate Mulgrew) sports a butch haircut and excessive \"schadenfreude\". Meanwhile, the holographic Doctor (Robert Picardo) has become an android mass murderer and torturer with neon yellow-green eyes while Tactical Officer Tuvok (Tim Russ) has a sinister sense of humor; former drone Seven of Nine (Jeri Ryan) is a full Borg with several other Borg drones serving as shock troops aboard \"Voyager\". The depiction also shows several Kazon as part of the crew, assumed to have been conscripted along with the Borg. Neelix (Ethan Phillips) is not the cook, but a part of the bridge crew and a brutal henchman.\n\nIn the actual course of events, Captain Janeway had agreed to provide the Vaskans with medical supplies in exchange for dilithium crystals. The Kyrians, who were at war with the Vaskans, boarded \"Voyager\" to stop the deal, which they thought was a military alliance of some sort. During their time on the ship, they stole a data module carrying a backup copy of the Doctor. Seven hundred years later, this module was part of a Kyrian museum exhibit which showed their version of the encounter. This biased encounter showed \"Voyager\" as a warship with a savage and sadistic crew that was willing to commit genocide. Even the Vaskan in the simulation became horrified over the atrocities committed, but the simulated Janeway told him it was too late to stop now.\n\nQuarren (Henry Woronicz), the curator at the museum and always fascinated by \"Voyager\"s story even though they were \"the bad guys\", had found (with the help from an archaeological team) the Doctor's backup module three weeks prior. He was able to activate it using \"Voyager\"s own tools. The Doctor, upon seeing this biased simulated version of history, is appalled and offers to show Quarren his own accurate version of events from 700 years ago aboard \"Voyager\". Initially, the Doctor's claims that \"Voyager\" was unfairly depicted by the Kyrians are ignored, with Quarren only agreeing to hear him out because the fact he is a hologram, not an android, already casts the simulation's accuracy in a dubious light, and he is told he could be held accountable for war crimes when he presents his version of history before the Commission of Arbiters. The Doctor states, however, that a presently non-functional Starfleet medical tricorder would settle the issue of who killed Tedran, a Kyrian revolutionary hero who died during a raid on \"Voyager\".\n\nAfter fending off an angry mob of Vaskans intent on destroying what they now know to be a museum of false history, the Doctor initially wishes to abandon his quest to set the 700-year-old historical record straight and says that the truth may cause more harm and violence. Quarren objects, saying that the tension between the Kyrian and Vaskan cultures has already reached the breaking point. Quarren stresses that both races on his planet need to hear the truth about the real course of events on \"Voyager\". This persuades the Doctor to continue searching for the tricorder.\n\nThe episode ends an indeterminate number of years later, as the museum's new curator explains that the two species finally made peace thanks to the efforts of the Doctor and the information from the tricorder, although he always regretted that he would never see any of his friends again. It is revealed to the viewer that all the scenes that they had been witnessing were computer simulations revealing real life events which occurred in the past, such as the Kyrian-Vaskan conflict, Quarren's discovery of the Doctor's backup program, and Quarren and the Doctor's proposal to the Commission of Arbiters. Following the peace, the Doctor served as the surgical chancellor for the Kyrians and Vaskans for many years, but eventually he took a ship and departed for Earth; he said that \"he had a longing for home\".

He was among the first Europeans to explore the West African coast. Around 1462 his expedition reached what is now Sierra Leone and named it. Although according to professor C. Magbaily Fyle this could have possibly been a misinterpretation of historians; there has been evidence of Serra Lyoa being mentioned prior to 1462, the year when de Sintra's expedition reached the coast of Sierra Leone. This would suggest that the person who named Sierra Leone is still unknown. However, if de Sintra did name the area, it is unclear whether he named it after the landforms or climate in the area. According to some the coastal regions resembled lion's teeth while others suggest the thunderstorms sounded like the roar of a lion. Sixteenth century English sailors called the area Sierra Leoa which later evolved to Sierra Leone in the 17th century. The British, prior to the area being colonised, officially adopted the name Sierra Leone in 1787.\n\nDe Sintra continued his journey with his expedition from Sierra Leone to contemporary Nigeria, where the Kingdom of Benin thrived.

{"id": "2037158", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2037158", "title": "Redwall (TV series)", "text": "Redwall (TV series)\n\nRedwall is a 1999-2002 Canadian-British-French animated series produced by Canada-based Nelvana, alongside France-based Alphanim and German-based TV-Loonland AG. The series is based on the \"Redwall\" novels by Brian Jacques. The series spans three seasons, the first based on the first book \"Redwall\", the second on \"Mattimeo\" and the third on \"Martin the Warrior\".\n\nThe series originally aired on Teletoon in Canada, along with being independently distributed in the United States by American Public Television through public television stations.\n\nA young mouse named Matthias lives at Redwall Abbey. Reminiscing on his past life, he remembers how his family was very poor. During a particularly harsh winter, an army of Rats, led by Cluny the Scourge, attacked his village. Separated from his family, Matthias saw Cluny just before he was rescued by his sister and, with advice from voles, travelled to Redwall Abbey, with the memory of Cluny still fresh in their minds. After difficult travels, Matthias' sister collapsed, and Matthias followed soon after. When he came to, he found that he had been brought to Redwall Abbey, where the fathers of the abbey later informed him that his sister had died of exhaustion from the journey. Matthias was then raised in the abbey as a novice, yet dreamed of becoming a great warrior like Martin, the warrior-mouse that helped found Redwall. When he joined Constance the Badger on escorting some woodlanders from a feast at the Abbey, he was shocked when he spotted Cluny and his rats marching onto Redwall, taking a nearby church as their main base. Cluny and his captains went to Redwall, claiming to be travelers until they were inside, when Cluny makes his demands clear. In a fit of rage, Matthias attacked them, telling them exactly what he thought of them. Cluny and his captains were forced to leave when Constance threatened to kill them if they did not leave. When he was forced outside, Cluny instructed his only climber, the ninja-esque Shadow, to steal the image of Martin from the tapestry to reduce Redwall's morale. Shadow was successful, but was intercepted by Matthias, and fell to his death from the walls. Cluny then took the image of Martin as his war-standard. However, Cluny had nightmares about Martin and Matthias for as long as the tapestry was in his possession. This was soon remedied when Matthias's friends, Jess Squirrel and Basil Stag Hare, stole the tapestry back.\n\nAfter a number of battles, Matthias was busily looking for Martin's sword, theorizing that they could drive Cluny away if they found it. With old Methuselah the abbey recorder and Cornflower (a young mouse who Matthias was close friends with), they discover that Matthias was to be the next Abbey warrior, like Martin before him. Through a riddle they found under the tapestry, they discovered Martin's tomb underneath a set of stone stairs, and there they found Martin's shield and sword-belt. Next, Matthias found Martin's sheath in the roost of the Sparra, a tribe of savage sparrows living in the roofspaces, ruled by the insane King Bull Sparra. Matthias stole the sheath from the Sparra, killing Bull Sparra in the process, and befriended a young Sparrow named Warbeak. However, he learned that the sword was taken from the Sparra by Asmodeus Poisonteeth, a huge snake. On a journey to find information, Matthias met the Guosim Shrews, a tribe of argumentative shrews who told him to speak to a large snowy owl named Captain Snow for information. Snow told him that Asmodeus lives in a nearby quarry, but mocked Matthias for thinking he could stand a chance against the snake. In fact, he bet Matthias that if he got the sword, he would give up eating mice (and shrews), as well as apologise to Julian Gingivere, a vegetarian cat who used to be friends with Snow, until he banned Snow from his home because of his manners and taste in food. Matthias, after a brief return to the Abbey, set off on an expedition to find the sword, with help from the Guosim. They followed Asmodeus to the large quarry. There, Matthias found the sword, and in a fierce battle with the snake, decapitated him. Meanwhile, Cornflower discovered Martin's old battle-armour in an abbey attic.\n\nThroughout this period, Cluny had been using various tactics to try to take over Redwall, including tunnelling in, using a battering ram, blackmailing a spice-merchant dormouse to kidnap Cornflower as ransom, burning the gates, using a siege tower, and sneaking his soldiers in with a visiting local circus. Every single time the rats failed, and Cluny began to show signs of insanity.\n\nWhile Matthias was away gathering more troops to fight the rats, Cluny forced a dormouse he had captured to sneak into Redwall and open the gates from the inside. Cluny and his army entered the Abbey at last. However, Matthias came back, dressed in Martin's armour, alongside an army of shrews and sparrows that he had gathered. He found that Cluny had taken over, and was about to execute all the Redwallers (starting with Cornflower). The sight of Matthias dressed as the mouse he had seen in his dreams terrified Cluny, who sent his troops against Matthias and his army. During the ensuing battle between Cluny's army and the mixed defenders of Redwall (The Defenders of Redwall, the Guosim, and the Sparra), Cluny kidnapped Cornflower and hid in the belltower. When Matthias followed them in, Cluny ambushed him, and a duel began, which led them both up to the top of the belltower. Cluny jumped down and caught Cornflower again, threatening to kill her if Mathias did not come down to face him. Mathias swore to, if Cluny released her. Cluny released Cornflower, but Matthias cut the bellropes, causing the Abbey-bell to crash down onto Cluny, killing him instantly.\n\nIn the aftermath of the battle, Abbot Mortimer was fatally wounded. Before he died, he declared Matthias to be the Abbey warrior, and that Cornflower would be his wife.\n\nIn the epilogue, we see how life in Redwall is back to normal. The Sparra are now ruled by Warbeak who is a good ruler, and the Sparra are now friends with the Redwallers. Some of the Guosim Shrews have chosen to stay at Redwall, and have become beekeepers (even learning to speak to the bees, so they can argue with them). The new abbot is brother Mordalfus, previously known as brother Alf, who used to run the Abbey Pond. Matthias and Cornflower are now happily married and have a son, named Mattimeo (which is somehow short for Matthias Methuselah Mortimer (possibly MATThIas MEthuselah mOrtimer)). The new Abbey Recorder, John Churchmouse, signs off saying that the gates of Redwall are always open to travellers, inviting the viewer to visit if they are ever passing.\n\nSeveral seasons after the death of Cluny, Matthias and Cornflower had a son, Mattimeo. But one night, as the Redwallers were celebrating, they were interrupted by the masked fox, Slagar the Cruel, who was previously known as Chickenhound, who entered Redwall with a band of rodents, drugged everyone and kidnapped all of their children. Matthias, Basil Stag Hare and Jess headed out to save them, gaining new and old allies along the way, such as Orlando the Axe, the Guosim shrews, and the \"Sparra\".\n\nMeanwhile, in their absence, things started to go wrong for Redwall. It came under attack by ravens, led by General Ironbeak. The ravens took all of their food and the dormitories, leaving Cavern Hole as the only free location. However, the Redwallers struck back by using Martin's armor as a ghost to scare the raven. They later saved a mountain bird named Stryk Redkite, who was being harassed and later hurt by the ravens. Eventually, Ironbeak figured out their little trick after seeing Constance the badger going to put away Martin's armour. He locked her in the gatehouse and had his troops take Cavern Hole. Constance was able to break out and save the Redwallers as a newly recovered Stryk killed Ironbeak. The other ravens left Redwall.\n\nMatthias and company were able to follow Slagar's trail to an old buried abbey, Loamhedge, where a cult of rats who worshiped Malkariss, were enslaving others. The fight ended with the slaves stoning Malkariss to death and Matthias setting them free. Eventually, they won with the abbey sinking into the earth. At the surface, Slagar tried to get back at Matthias for the death of his mother but ended up falling into the hole from which he escaped.\n\nCompany returned to Redwall with the young ones and slaves. After seven seasons, things were going peacefully at Redwall. The slaves of Malkariss and Matthias' companions settled in Redwall. Matthias, Basil and Orlando began training Redwall's next generation of defenders.\n\nAt the same seventh season after Matthias returned, the Redwallers listen to Tim Churchmouse, who tells the tale of how their hero, Martin, became the warrior he is known as today. In the lands of the Marshank coast, the terrible Badrang the Tyrant was increasing his piracy attacks, forcing Luke the Warrior, Martin's father, to go out to sea to combat the sea rats. He left his son his sword and told him to never let another creature take it. Years later, Martin was captured by Badrang and his sword taken. The young mouse served many years in the fortress of Marshank as a slave. When he defended an old squirrel named Barkjon, Badrang had him hung outside in the rain with hungry gulls to peck at him and was later put in the prison pit with Barkjon's son, Felldoh, and a mouse named Brome. Meanwhile, Badrang's old shipmate, Tramun Clogg, arrived to take Marshank. Brome's sister, Laterose, also known as Rose, and her friend, the mole Grumm, also arrived and began digging their way into the prison pit while Clogg began his siege. The five made it to Clogg's boats and managed to commandeer one. However, the boat had a hole, flooding it. A raging storm and a fish separated the group. Martin, Rose and Grumm ended up captured by pygmy shrews and met a hedgehog by the name of Pallum. After saving Queen Amballa's son, Dinjer, they were free to go to Noonvale, Rose's home.\n\nMeanwhile, Brome and Felldoh washed up somewhere else, meeting the Rosehip Players, a traveling circus who agreed to help them free the slaves of Marshank. Managing to win Clogg's amusement, they got inside Marshank and freed most of the slaves. A few days later, Brome disguised himself as one of the rats to get inside, and freed the other slaves through the prison pit's tunnel.\n\nEn route to Noonvale, the company made many friends, such as the Warden of Marshwood Hill and Boldred the owl and enemies like the uncivilized cannibalistic lizards and the rogue Gawtrybe. With help from the shrews and otters, they made it to Noonvale but were unable to raise an army to defeat Badrang. However, many were drawn to Martin's cause, including the Gawtrybe as he made his way to Marshank.\n\nClogg took his opportunity to capture Marshank while Badrang was out. However, Badrang knew of the tunnel in the prison pit. He had Clogg's soldiers swear allegiance to him while Clogg became Marshank's one man slave operation. Felldoh became so obsessed with Marshank's fall that he began solo attacks against it. When he faced Badrang head-to-head, he was beaten to death by his minions. It wasn't until Martin arrived with his army that he forced Badrang into a corner. Martin's army burned down Marshank's gate, and began their attack. In the confusion, Martin retrieved his father's sword and slew Badrang with it. Unfortunately, Badrang had stabbed and killed Rose during the battle. The Fur and Freedom Fighters returned to Noonvale, where it will remain a secret, while Martin continued on his own path.\n\n\n\n\nOn February 27, 2003, one of the supervising directors of the show (Jocelyn Hamilton), was contacted by fans of the show in regards to a possible fourth season. Ms. Hamilton replied that the producers are prepared to produce a fourth season, as the show itself is very popular, especially well-accepted by fans of the book series, but only if it is \"financially feasible\". At the moment, no American broadcasters are helping to finance a fourth season.\n\n"}

He has also competed as a professional boxer. However he is most well known as a cricketing all-rounder who played for Surrey and England. He captained Surrey from 1997 until 2003, winning three County Championships, and led the England cricket team in One Day Internationals. He was named one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 2003.\n\nSince retiring from cricket in 2004, Hollioake has spent his time involved in charitable and media work as well as developing a property development business. He moved to Perth, Western Australia and later to Queensland. His property company, the Hollioake Group, collapsed in 2010. As of 2018, he works as a cricket coach in Afghanistan and for the England Lions.\n\nHollioake was born in Melbourne in 1971 and grew up in the mining town of Ballarat, where his family had lived for five generations. His father, an engineer, had played cricket for local sides, but Hollioake showed a preference for Australian Rules Football while attending St Patrick's College, Ballarat. The family moved to England in 1983 for 2 years where Hollioake attended St George's College in Weybridge. He would then move to Hong Kong for 3 years where he honed his cricketing skills and then back to Australia where he attended Wesley College where brother Ben would later study.\n\nAlthough born in Australia, both Adam and brother Ben learned their cricket at the Hong Kong Cricket Club Junior Gappers during the time their father John was working in Hong Kong before moving to UK. Hollioake was offered a contract by Surrey in 1989 and made his first-class debut for the county in August 1993. He was awarded his county cap in 1995, during a season in which he scored 1099 runs and took 21 wickets. He was described as an all-rounder with \"aggressive batting and inventive medium-pace allsorts\" and began to share captaincy duties for Surrey with Alec Stewart in 1996. He captained Surrey from 1997 until 2003, and led them to victory in the County Championship in 1999, 2000 and 2002. He went on to claim 9 trophies in his time as Surrey captain making him one of the most successful 1st class captains of all time.\n\nHollioake made his England debut in two One Day International matches against Pakistan in August 1996. He led the England A team on their tour of Australia in 1996–97 and was man of the series in the home One Day International series against Australia in May 1997, scoring the winning runs in all three games. He made his test debut, playing alongside his brother Ben, against Australia in August 1997, scoring 45 runs in the first innings and taking two wickets.\n\nAlthough his test career lasted only four matches in 1997 and at the beginning of 1998, Hollioake achieved greater success in One Day Internationals, playing in 35 matches from 1996 to 1999. He captained the side to victory in the 1997 Sharjah Cup, England's first tournament success for ten years. Injuries and a loss of form saw him lose the captaincy after 14 matches.\n\nAfter 173 first-classes matches for Surrey, Hollioake retired from cricket at the end of the 2004 season. He made an appearance in the 2005 Asian tsunami appeal charity match, taking a hat-trick, and made a brief return to Twenty20 cricket in 2007, playing in eight matches for Essex.\n\nFollowing the death of his brother and Surrey and England teammate, Ben, in a car accident in 2002, Hollioake and his family established the Ben Hollioake Fund to raise funds for CHASE hospice care for children. In 2003 he undertook 'The Journey', walking from Edinburgh, then sailing the English channel from Brighton to Dieppe, riding from Dieppe to Gibraltar and finally rowing from Gibraltar to Tangiers. The journey took over 2 months and raised several hundred thousand pounds for the Chase Charity.\n\nIn 2004 Hollioake's charity broke the world record for the number of participants in a continuous 100 metre relay. Other fundraising projects Hollioake has been involved in include Cricket Challenge, which raises money for the Queensland-based charity Paradise Kids, where members of the public compete against stars and cricketing legends, and the Battle of the Stars charity golf day.\n\nHollioake made several appearances on the BBC programme \"A Question of Sport\" and Sky Sports \"Cricket AM\", as well as appearing on programmes such as the 2004 \"Test the Nation\" quiz. He worked for Sky again in their coverage of the Ashes in 2010. In 2005 Hollioake took part in a revived \"Superstars\" programme on BBC television, finishing fourth in the competition behind skier Alain Baxter, Olympic athlete Du'aine Ladejo and rower Steve Williams. In 2007 Hollioake and Ladejo formed Quiet Storm Productions, which owned the television show \"Australia's Greatest Athlete\".\n\nHollioake and other members of his family owned an Australia-based property company, the Hollioake Group, which collapsed with debts of around A$20 million and was liquidated in September 2010. Following a long-running legal case, during which Hollioake and his father were sued by businessman Martin Ryman, Hollioake was declared bankrupt in 2011.\n\nAs of 2018, Hollioake coaches Afghan Twenty20 cricket team Boost Defenders, who play in the Shpageeza Cricket League.

It was aired on January 26, 2000 on United Paramount Network (UPN).USS Voyager, the fictional starship and the show's primary setting, is making its way slowly back to Earth from the other side of the Galaxy when they encounter Qomar aliens. These advanced aliens are intrigued by the singing abilities of (played by cast regular Robert Picardo), indeed by music itself which despite their advanced technology they have not yet discovered.\n\nThis episode was directed by Les Landau, with a teleplay by Raf Green and Kenneth Biller from a story by Raf Green. This episode includes the Voyager band \"Harry Kim and the Kimtones\", which have a brief performance in the episode. \n\n\"Virtuoso\" includes several guest stars, including Kamala Lopez-Dawson, Ray Xifo, Paul Williams, Marie Caldare, and Nina Magnesson. \n\n\"Voyager\" encounters a technologically advanced race called the Qomar, and renders aid after a Qomar crew suffers minor injuries from a reaction with \"Voyager's\" scanners. The Qomar are extremely arrogant and dismissive to everyone, and dislike the Doctor simply for being a holographic entity. However, once the Qomar happen to hear the Doctor singing, they are immediately enthralled by him, since they never conceived the concept of music. When the Doctor explains how music is used and how many others on the ship can perform it naturally, the Qomar invite the \"Voyager\" crew to their home system—previously off limits to outsiders—to learn more about music. The \"Voyager\" crew discover thousands of subspace channels encrypted in many ways, and tons of traffic just above the home world. The Qomar decide to transmit the Doctor's singing planet-wide, and make him a star. This accentuates his vanity, making him unpopular with his friends on \"Voyager\". He asks to leave so he can pursue his music career on the planet. This causes more anger, as the crew believes they need his medical skills and have grown to love him as a member of the crew. The Doctor protests, even preparing Paris to take over his position, and severely upsetting Seven of Nine, who feels like she is being abandoned. However, the aliens replace him with an upgraded singing hologram capable of a greater vocal range. The Doctor's hopes for a new life are dashed. In the end, the Doctor realizes they simply wanted him for his singing, not who he is as a sentient entity. The \"Voyager\" crew welcome him back, as symbolized by Seven delivering him a fan letter praising his talent and personality, signed by Seven of Nine.\n\nThe shot of the Qomar homeworld is the same one previously used in the beginning of the episode \"Year of Hell.\"\n\nA clarinet (reed woodwind instrument), standup bass, and some other instruments are played in this episode.\n\nThe background of the science fiction world Qomar Opera theatre comes from a real-world opera house, the Teatro della Scala's set for the opera \"Pagliacci.\" \n\n\"That Old Black Magic\", was first recorded and released as a single by Glenn Miller and His Orchestra. The music was written by Harold Arlen, with the lyrics by Johnny Mercer.\n\n"}
{"id": "2037178", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2037178", "title": "Concurrent ML", "text": "Concurrent ML\n\nConcurrent ML (CML) is a concurrent extension of the Standard ML programming language characterized by its ability to allow programmers to create composable communication abstractions that are first class rather than built into the language. The design of CML and its primitive operations have been adopted in several other programming languages such as GNU Guile, Racket, and Manticore.\n\nMany programming languages that support concurrency offer communication channels that allow the exchange of values between processes or threads running concurrently in a system. Communications established between processes may follow a specific protocol, requiring the programmer to write functions to establish the required pattern of communication. Meanwhile, a communicating system often requires establishing multiple channels, such as to multiple servers, and then choosing between the available channels when new data is available. This can be accomplished using polling, such as with the select operation on Unix systems.\n\nCombining both application-specific protocols and multi-party communication may be complicated due to the need to introduce polling and checking for blocking within a pre-existing protocol. Concurrent ML solves this problem by reducing this coupling of programming concepts by introducing synchronizable \"events\". Events are a first-class abstraction that can be used with a synchronization operation (called codice_1 in CML and Racket) in order to potentially block and then produce some value resulting from communication (for example, data transmitted on a channel).\n\nIn CML, events can be combined or manipulated using a number of primitive operations. Each primitive operation constructs a new event rather than modifying the event in-place, allowing for the construction of compound events that represent a desired communication pattern. For example, CML allows the programmer to combine several sub-events in order to create a compound event that can then make a non-deterministic choice of one of the sub-events. Another primitive creates a new event that will modify the value resulting from synchronization on the original event. These events embody patterns of communication that, in a non-CML language, would typically be handled using a polling loop or function with handlers for each kind of event.\n\nHere is sample code to print \"hello, world\" to the console. It spawns a thread which creates a channel for strings. This thread then spawns another thread which prints the first string that is received on the channel. The former thread then sends the \"hello, world\\n\" string on the channel. It uses SML/NJ and CML\n(note that the heap name will be different on non linux-x86 platforms; you may need to change the line with \"cml_test.x86-linux\" to \nsomething different):\n\n Library\n\n structure Hello =\n\n\n$ ml-build cml_test.cm Hello.main\nStandard ML of New Jersey v110.60 [built: Mon Nov 27 14:19:21 2006]\n[scanning cml_test.cm]\n[library $cml/basis.cm is stable]\n[library $cml/cml.cm is stable]\n[parsing (cml_test.cm):cml_test.sml]\n[creating directory .cm/SKEL]\n[library $cml/cml-internal.cm is stable]\n[library $cml/core-cml.cm is stable]\n[library $SMLNJ-BASIS/basis.cm is stable]\n[compiling (cml_test.cm):cml_test.sml]\n[creating directory .cm/GUID]\n[creating directory .cm/x86-unix]\n[code: 2170, data: 42, env: 2561 bytes]\n[scanning 18518-export.cm]\n[scanning (18518-export.cm):cml_test.cm]\n[parsing (18518-export.cm):18518-export.sml]\n[compiling (18518-export.cm):18518-export.sml]\n[code: 309, data: 37, env: 42 bytes]\n$ heap2exec cml_test.x86-linux cml_test\n$ ./cml_test\nhello, world\n"}

The Prussian fortress was never attacked.\n\nSince 2002, Ehrenbreitstein has been part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site Upper Middle Rhine Valley.\n\nEhrenbreitstein is located on the eastern bank of the Rhine at Koblenz in Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany. It overlooks the confluence of the Mosel and the Rhine. The peak of the hill, which shares the name, is 118 metres above the Rhine. It is the northernmost point of the UNESCO World Heritage Site Upper Middle Rhine Valley.\n\nEhrenbreitstein, the hill on which the eponymous fortress is now located, was first settled in the 4th millennium BC, and fortifications were built in the 10th/9th century BC. In the 3rd to 5th centuries AD a Roman fortification was sited there. More settlement followed in the 8th/9th centuries under the Carolingian dynasty.\n\nIn about 1000 a noble called Ehrenbert (or Erembert) erected a castle on the hill. Its initial name \"Burg Ehrenbertstein\" later became \"Burg Ehrenbreitstein\".\n\nThe castle was first mentioned in an extant written document in 1139, as a property of the Archbishop of Trier. Archbishop Hillin expanded it in 1152–1169. A supporting castle (\"Burg Helferstein\") was built on the hill known as \"Helfenstein\" to the south. It was further extended by Archbishop Henry of Fénétrange in 1286, and Archbishop John II of Baden in 1481.\n\nDuring the 16th century, work began to turn the castle into a fortress that could withstand the new gunpowder weapons. One of the first cannon was the 9 ton Greif cannon. At the foot of the hill, protected by the fortress, Philipp Christoph von Sötern had the palace \"Phillipsburg\" constructed in 1625–1629. The fortress was further improved by his successors Karl Kaspar von der Leyen and Johann Hugo von Orsbeck. In 1632, it was occupied by the French and in 1637 by Imperial troops during the Thirty Years' War.\n\nEhrenbreitstein guarded the most valuable relic of the Trier See, the Holy Tunic, from 1657 to 1794. Successive Archbishops used the fortress' strategic importance to barter between contending powers; thus in 1672 at the outset of war between France and Germany the Archbishop refused requests both from the envoys of Louis XIV and from Brandenburg's Ambassador, Christoph Caspar von Blumenthal, to permit the passage of troops across the Rhine.\n\nIn 1688, the fortress successfully withstood a siege by King Louis XIV of France. Around 1730, Balthasar Neumann created the \"Schönborn-Werke\", a third ring of fortifications. France did succeed in taking it in 1759, but only held it for three years.\n\nHowever, in 1794, French revolutionary troops conquered Koblenz; in the following years they besieged Ehrenbreitstein three times without success. But a one-year siege, starting in 1798 during the War of the Second Coalition, brought starvation to the defenders of Ehrenbreitstein who finally handed over the fortress to French troops in 1799. By the Treaty of Lunéville, the French were eventually forced to withdraw from the right bank of the Rhine. Hence, they blew up Ehrenbreitstein in 1801 to prevent the enemy from taking hold of a fully functional fortress just a few meters away from French territory on the left bank of the Rhine.\n\nFrom 1803 to 1815 the area was part of Nassau.\n\nAccording to the Final Act of the Congress of Vienna in 1815, the Rhineland became a Prussian province. The fortification of the Koblenz area became a Prussian military priority, because of its proximity to France and the fact that Koblenz was a bottleneck for all means of transportation (ships, railways, land transportation because of bridges). Hence, the Prussians built a system of fortification around Koblenz, the so-called \"Festung Koblenz\" (\"Fortress Koblenz\"), from 1815 until 1834. This referred to the strong ring of fortifications around Koblenz, of which the Festung Ehrenbreitstein was a part. Fortress Koblenz was said to have been the largest military fortress in Europe except for Gibraltar. Ehrenbreitstein could be defended by up to 1200 soldiers.\n\nUnder a peace treaty France paid 15 million francs towards a new fortress. Actual construction took from 1817 to 1828, and it was ready for service by 1834. Subsequently expanded several times, by 1886 Koblenz was classified as a fortification \"of lesser importance\". After the Koblenz fortifications west of the Rhine were dismantled in 1890–1903, the fortress and some lesser structures on the east bank alone covered the Rhine crossing until 1918.\n\nDuring its years of active service, the fortress was never attacked. It escaped being dismantled after the end of World War I as a result of its perceived historical and artistic value. The American General Henry Tureman Allen, convinced of its historical value as a premier 19th-century fortress, prevented its intended destruction in 1922. It was occupied after 1919 by the US Army as their headquarters during the Occupation of the Rhineland. In February 1923, Allen left the fortress, and the first U.S. occupation of European territory was over. After January 1923, Ehrenbreitstein was occupied by the French Army.\n\nDuring World War II, the fortress served as a place of safekeeping for archives and cultural objects (1943–56) but also harbored three flak guns (1943–1945).\n\nAfter World War II, the fortress was used by the French Army, before it was handed over to the State of Rhineland-Palatinate in 1947. In 1946–1950 it served as a refugee camp and then as residential housing, during the period of housing shortages from the early 1950s into the 1960s. In 1952, a youth hostel was opened, followed by a museum in 1956. In 1972, the \"Ehrenmal des Deutschen Heeres\" (a memorial to the dead of the German army) was inaugurated. In 2011, Festung Ehrenbreitstein was part of the \"Bundesgartenschau\" (National Garden Show) in Koblenz, following a multi-year restoration in 2007–2011.\n\nThe fortress is open to visitors. It is connected to the town of Koblenz across the Rhine by a cable car and by an inclined lift to the foot of the hill. Ehrenbreitstein houses several museums: \"Haus der Fotografie\" (photography), \"Haus der Archäologie\" (archaeology) and the \"Landesmuseum Koblenz\" (temporary exhibitions). There is also a \"Haus des Genusses\", celebrating regional wine making and offering a Baroque dining experience. Permanent exhibitions at several locations inside the fortress cover the 5000 years of history of Ehrenbreitstein. There are also gastronomic establishments. The Koblenz youth hostel, with 157 beds, still occupies part of Ehrenbreitstein. The fortress serves as a venue for various cultural activities, such as open-air concerts and plays.\n\nIn 1822, the English translation of the castle's name, \"The Broad-Stone of Honour\", was used as the title of Kenelm Henry Digby's exhaustive work on chivalry.\n\n\"...this pulpit, I see, is a self-containing stronghold —a lofty Ehrenbreitstein...\" (Herman Melville, \"Moby-Dick\")\n\nAs the vine flourishes, and the grape empurples close up to the very walls and muzzles of cannoned Ehrenbreitstein; so do the sweetest joys of life grow in the very jaws of its perils. (Herman Melville, \"\")\n\nHere Ehrenbreitstein, with her shattered wall<br>\nBlack with the miner's blast, upon her height<br>\nYet shows of what she was, when shell and ball<br>\nRebounding idly on her strength did light;<br>\nA tower of victory! from whence the flight<br>\nOf baffled foes was watch'd along the plain:<br>\nBut Peace destroy'd what War could never blight,<br>\nAnd laid those proud roofs bare to Summer's rain—<br>\nOn which the iron shower for years had pour'd in vain.<br>\n\nByron in fact refers to the previous structure, destroyed by the French, since the new fortification was only constructed after he wrote these lines.\n\nIn 1835, J. M. W. Turner completed a major painting inspired by Byron's work, entitled \"View of Ehrenbreitstein, or The Bright Stone of Honour and the Tomb of Marceau, from Byron's 'Childe Harold'.\" In April 2017, the painting was in a private collection and had an estimated value of £15m-£25m. Turner also painted a series of watercolors depicting views of the fortress and environs, some of which are held by the Tate Gallery in London.\n\nIn 1897, a monument to Emperor Wilhelm I was erected right below the Festung, but on the west side of the Rhine, known as the \"Deutsches Eck\" (German Corner). Both fortress and monument were considered as symbols for the \"Guard at the Rhine\", as in the song \"Die Wacht am Rhein\". Today the Ehrenbreitstein Fortress is used for concerts and as a museum.\n\nIn 2002, the Upper Middle Rhine Valley became a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Site includes as its northernmost point the fortress of Ehrenbreitstein.\n\n\n\n"}

It is located in the University City section of Philadelphia. Founded in 1765, the Perelman School of Medicine is the oldest medical school in the United States and is one of the seven Ivy League medical schools. Penn Med is consistently one of the top recipients of NIH research awards and is currently ranked third for research among American medical schools by \"U.S. News & World Report\".\n\nThe school of medicine was founded by Dr. John Morgan, a graduate of the College of Philadelphia (the precursor of the University of Pennsylvania) and the University of Edinburgh Medical School. After training in Edinburgh and other European cities, Dr. Morgan returned to Philadelphia in 1765. With fellow University of Edinburgh Medical School graduate Dr. William Shippen Jr., Morgan persuaded the college's trustees to found the first medical school in the Original Thirteen Colonies. Only months before the medical school was created, Morgan delivered an address to the trustees and the citizens of Philadelphia, \"Upon the Institution of Medical Schools in America\" during which he expressed his desire for the new medical school to become a model institution:\n\nThat autumn, students enrolled for \"anatomical lectures\" and a course on \"the theory and practice of physick.\" Modeling the school after the University of Edinburgh Medical School, medical lectures were supplemented with bedside teaching at the Pennsylvania Hospital.\n\nThe School of Medicine's early faculty included nationally renowned physicians and scientists such as Benjamin Rush, Philip Syng Physick, and Robert Hare. In the mid-1800s, prominent faculty members included William Pepper, Joseph Leidy, and Nathaniel Chapman (founding president of the American Medical Association). William Osler and Howard Atwood Kelly, two of the \"founding four\" physicians of The Johns Hopkins Hospital were drawn from Penn's medical faculty. Later, in 1910, the landmark Flexner Report on medical education reviewed Penn as one of the relatively few medical schools of the era with high standards in medical instruction, facilities, and research.\n\nIn 2011, the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine was renamed in recognition of a $225 million gift by Raymond and Ruth Perelman. Raymond G. Perelman and his son, Ronald Perelman, are both alumni of Penn's Wharton School. It was the single largest gift made in the University's history, and it remains the largest donation ever made for naming rights to a medical school.\n\nBetween 1765 and 1801, medical school lectures were held in Surgeon's Hall on 5th Street in Center City, Philadelphia. In 1801, medical instruction moved with the rest of the university to 9th Street. In the 1870s, the university moved across the Schuylkill River to a location in West Philadelphia. As part of this move, the medical faculty persuaded the university trustees to construct a teaching hospital adjacent to the new academic facilities. As a result, Penn's medical school and flagship teaching hospital form part of the university's main campus and are located in close proximity to the university's other schools and departments. Although they are independent institutions, the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and the Wistar Institute are also located on or adjacent to Penn's campus. \n\nThe Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Penn Presbyterian Medical Center, Pennsylvania Hospital, and the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia serve as the medical school's main teaching hospitals. Additional teaching takes place at Chester County Hospital, Lancaster General Hospital, and the Philadelphia VA Medical Center.\n\nDuring the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the School of Medicine was one of the earliest to encourage the development of the emerging medical specialties: neurosurgery, ophthalmology, dermatology, and radiology. Between 1910 and 1939, the chairman of the Department of Pharmacology, Alfred Newton Richards, played a significant role in developing the University as an authority of medical science, helping the United States to catch up with European medicine and begin to make significant advances in biomedical science.\n\nIn the 1950s and early 1960s, Dr. Jonathan Rhoads of the Department of Surgery (which he would later go on to head for many years) mentored Dr. Stanley Dudrick who pioneered the successful use of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) for patients unable to tolerate nutrition through their GI tract.\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, Dr. C. William Schwab, a trauma surgeon, led numerous advances in the concept of damage control surgery for severely injured trauma patients.\n\nIn the 1990s and 2000s, Dr. Paul Offit, a professor of Pediatrics at the School of Medicine and Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, lead the scientific advances behind the modern RotaTeq vaccine for infectious childhood diarrhea.\n\nIn 2006, Drs. Kaplan and Shore of the Department of Orthopedics discovered the causative mutation in fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva, an extremely rare disease of bone.\n\nBenchmark changes in the understanding of medical science and the practice of medicine have necessitated that the school change its methods of teaching, as well as its curriculum. Large changes were made in 1968, 1970, 1981, 1987, and 1997. The last significant change in 1997 brought about the institution of Curriculum 2000, \"an integrated, multidisciplinary curriculum which emphasizes small group instruction, self-directed learning and flexibility.\" Three themes, \"Science of Medicine\", \"Art and Practice of Medicine\", and \"Professionalism and Humanism\", were developed by focus groups consisting of department chairpersons, course directors, and students.\n\nBiomedical Graduate Studies, contained within the Perelman School of Medicine, was established in 1985 and serves as the academic home within the University of Pennsylvania for roughly 700 students pursuing a PhD in the basic biomedical sciences. BGS consists of more than 600 faculty members across seven Penn schools and several associated institutes including Wistar Institute, Fox Chase Cancer Center, and Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. There are eight graduate programs, labeled by the school as \"graduate groups,\" that lead to a Ph.D. in basic biomedical sciences. \n\nAll biomedical graduate studies students receive a stipend in addition to a full fellowship and tend to receive the degree within a median time frame of 5.4 years. There is also the option for students to pursue an additional certificate in medicine, public health, and environmental health sciences. Each graduate group has its own admission policy and training mission, and hence curriculum greatly varies.\n\nThe Perelman School of Medicine and the University of Pennsylvania Health System (UPHS) comprise \"Penn Medicine\". Penn Medicine is an organizational structure designed to integrate Penn's clinical, educational, and research functions. Penn Medicine is governed by a board of trustees which in turn reports to the trustees of the university. Ralph Mueller serves as CEO of UPHS while J. Larry Jameson serves as Dean of Medicine and Executive Vice President of the health system. \n\nThe School of Medicine has departments in the following basic science subjects: Biochemistry and Biophysics, Biostatistics and Epidemiology, Cancer Biology, Cell and Developmental Biology, Genetics, Medical Ethics and Health Policy, Microbiology, Neuroscience, Pharmacology, and Physiology. The school also has departments in the following clinical practices: Anesthesiology and Critical Care, Dermatology, Emergency Medicine, Family Practice and Community Medicine, Medicine, Neurology, Neurosurgery, Obstetrics and Gynecology, Ophthalmology (See Scheie Eye Institute), Orthopaedic Surgery, Otorhinolaryngology, Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Pediatrics (See Children's Hospital of Philadelphia), Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Psychiatry, Radiation Oncology, Radiology, and Surgery.\n\nThe Perelman School of Medicine, in conjunction with the University of Pennsylvania Health System, has contained within it many centers and institutes dealing with clinical medicine, clinical research, basic science research, and translational research.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2037205", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2037205", "title": "Arthur Champernowne", "text": "Arthur Champernowne\n\nSir Arthur Champernowne (c.1524 – 29 March 1578) was an English politician, high sheriff and soldier who lived at Dartington Hall in Devon, England.\n\nChampernowne belonged to a large Anglo-Norman family that originated from Cambernon, in Normandy. Following the Norman Conquest of the 11th century, members of the family acquired estates in Devon. Their surname was originally spelt Champernon, and Sir Arthur Champernowne has sometimes been referred to by that spelling; he was also known by at least three other surnames: Chamborne, Chapman, and Chamberlain. (These variations may reflect, at least in part, a state of flux in English during the 16th century, including variations in the spelling and usage of surnames by individuals.)\n\nOther members of the Champernowne family were prominent in (royal) court, political and military circles during the 16th century: Arthur Champernowne's aunt Lady Kat Ashley (or Astley; née Champernowne) was governess to Queen Elizabeth I, and Sir Walter Raleigh and Sir Humphrey Gilbert were his nephews.\n\nChampernowne is sometimes confused with several relatives also christened Arthur, especially Sir Arthur Champernowne (also Champernon; born c. 1562), an emissary of Elizabeth I during the 1580s.\n\nChampernowne was the second son of Sir Philip Champernowne of Modbury, Devon. When England was alerted to a possible invasion, he served in the English army at the Siege of Boulougne.\n\nIn 1549, Champernowne helped subdue a rebellion that sought to have the Latin \"Bible\" restored to a position of authority over the English-language version. The rebellion began in Cornwall, where the Cornish language was still widely spoken and English was regarded as a foreign language. He was knighted on 10 November 1549 for his part in crushing the western rebellion.\nChampernowne was an ardent protestant. He flirted with the conspiracy of cousin, Sir Peter Carew to support the claim of Lady Jane Grey, but wisely settled for accepting Mary Tudor. Champernowne was installed as Member of Parliament for Barnstaple in 1552 (replacing the elected MP, Sir James Wilford, who had died).\n\nHe spent early 1554 in the Tower, but was released on recognizance of a fine of £1000, and allowed to return to Devon. Although excluded from office by the Marian regime, he was chosen a local JP in 1555. They elected him in turn for Plympton Erle in 1555, Plymouth in 1559 and Totnes in 1563.\n\nIn 1546 Sir Arthur married Mary Norreys, widow of Sir George Carew, whose father Sir Henry Norris had been implicated in the fall of Anne Boleyn and was beheaded. In 1554 he exchanged with Thomas Aylworth, Lord of Dartington, the mansion house at Polsoe, Exeter for the Dartington estate, which contained the medieval Dartington Hall. By 1560 the construction of a new Elizabethan front on the foundation of the older buildings was underway and this continued for several years. His descendants continued to live in Dartington Hall until it became partly derelict and was sold in 1925.\n\nOfficial Posts:\n\n\nOn the accession of Elizabeth I he developed his maritime interests: from being Sheriff of Devon in 1559-60, he put to sea. As vice-admiral appointed in 1563, his service against French pirates was noted: constant harassment along the western approaches. However, from time to time he co-operated with the privateers of Jeanne d'Albet, Queen of Navarre, against Catholic Spain. In December 1568, many of these ships were driven up the channel and into Southampton and Portsmouth to be received by Sir Arthur and Edward Horsey, in the name of the Queen of England. In 1568 he had organised the robbery of the Spanish treasure fleet which was taking money to the Duke of Alva, Regent of the Netherlands. Champernowne personally delivered 64 boxes of treasure weighing some 8 tonnes safely to the tower of London, worth some 2 million \"reales\". Over half of the money was used by Queen Elizabeth to fund her navy, the remainder she sent on to Amsterdam.\n\nHe was a prominent supporter of protestantism and in 1572, his son Gawen married the daughter of Gabriel, Count of Montgomery, a Huguenot. The Count, whose immediate forebears were Scots, was Captain of the Scots Guards. Champernowne was at Dwercy, France for the marriage and reported back to Lord Burghley on the conditions in France. Following the massacre of St Bartholomew’s Eve, the Count escaped France and was given refuge at Dartington Hall. Champernowne wrote to Queen Elizabeth proposing the raising of an army to provide relief for the protestants in France.\n\nIn 1574 he led a relief expedition which went spectacularly wrong. Montgomery had already been captured and executed in Normandy, and the English fleet could only aid the Huguenot captains of La Rochelle. Sir Arthur's daughter Elizabeth married Sir Edward Seymour of Berry Pomeroy in 1576. Champernowne was continuing to support the naval exploits against France, when he wrote his will in March 1578. He died at Dartington Hall on 1 April.\n\n"}

That performance was in German, but now it is usually given in Italian. (Wolf-Ferrari stated that his operas were often first given in German simply because he had a German publisher.) The opera was given in Budapest in 1913, conducted by Fritz Reiner, who also conducted the first Dresden performance the following year [Ref: Philip Hart, Fritz Reiner, Evanston Illinois, 1994, pages 7 & 9]\n\nIts controversial themes include love between a brother and his adopted sister, implied criticism of the Catholic Church, and an on-stage orgy. There is an extant recording of the opera, made in 1967, featuring Pauline Tinsley, André Turp and Peter Glossop, conducted by Alberto Erede. It was issued on CD - Bella Voce #107242. A new recording was released in 2016 on the Naxos label.\n\nThe opera was given its Italian premiere in 1953. \"I gioielli della Madonna\" is not often performed today though it remains in the repertory. The third act intermezzo was for many years a popular concert piece. It was performed by Teatro Grattacielo in New York City in 2010. In 2013 it was performed in London at Opera Holland Park. The complete opera was revived May 2015 at the Slovak National Theatre, Bratislava, and recorded for Naxos.\n\n[According to Kutsch & Riemens Grosser Sangerlexicon, Berne and Stuttgart, 1987, page 3193, the role of Raffaele was sung in the 1911 Berlin premiere by Hermann Wiedemann (a baritone, 1879-1944). No tenor named Hermann Wiedermann is listed there.]\n\n\"A square in Naples by the sea \"\n\nCarmela's house, an inn, Biaso's hut, and Gennaro's smithy are visible. It is a lovely afternoon during the festival of the Madonna. Downtown swarms with a noisy crowd, celebrating the event in a carnival spirit. The chorus is divided into many small groups, representing the various parts of the town. Many of them end up following a band, which has crossed the square.\n\nIn his blacksmith shop, Gennaro is making a candelabra, placing it on the anvil reverentially, as on an altar. He sings \"Madonna, con sospiri\" (I sigh for you, Madonna).\n\nMaliella rushes out of her house, chased by Carmela. Maliella is a wilful girl, wanting to be rid of the tyranny of her household and wishing to throw herself into the life of the city. She strikes an attitude of bravado, singing her rebellious thoughts in the \"Song of Cannetella,\". The crowd gathers to hear her. From the direction of the sea comes the approaching chorus of the members of the Camorra. Maliella and the crowd dance wildly. When Carmela reappears with a pitcher of water on her head, the wayward girl is dashing along the quay joyously laughing.\n\nCarmela tells her son how she vowed to the Madonna to seek an infant girl, born of sin, and adopt her, in order to help her sickly boy. She sings, \"In the open street I found her, and you miraculously recovered.\" There is a touching duet for mother and son, in which Carmela bids him go and pray to the Madonna, and Gennaro asks for her blessing, before he leaves to do so. Carmela then goes into the house.\n\nMaliella runs in, with the Camorrists after her. Rafaele is in pursuit, he being the leader of the band, a handsome, flashy blackguard. When he advances to seize and kiss her, she draws out a hat pin. Laughing, he throws off his coat, like a duellist, grasps and holds her tightly. She stabs his hand, making it bleed, then throws away the pin. He laughs disdainfully, passionately kisses the wound. There is an extended scene with accepting and rejecting flowers, wearing them, tossing them away. Rafaele heads for the inn - she turns to look at him.\n\nAs the Madonna is brought past in procession during tolling of bells and cheers from the people, Rafaele pours words of passion into Maliella's ears. The image of the Virgin, bedecked with sparkling jewels—the jewels of the Madonna—is carried past. Rafaele swears that for the love of Maliella he would even rob the sacred image of the jewels and bedeck her with them—something so sacrilegious that it would never be considered. The superstitious girl is terrified.\n\nGennaro, who returns at that moment, warns her against Rafaele—and the men seem about to fight. But then the procession returns, and they all kneel. Rafaele and Maliella exchange looks, as she heads back to the house. He tosses her the flower she has previously despised. She picks it up, puts it between her lips, and flies indoors.\n\n\"Carmela’s Garden\"\nOn the left wall a wooden staircase. Under this is a gap in the back wall shut in by a railing. It is late evening. Carmela, having cleared the table, goes into the house. Gennaro starts in to warn Maliella. She says she will have freedom, rushes up the staircase to her room, where she is seen putting her things together, while she hums, \"E ndringhete, ndranghete\" (I long for mirth and folly).\n\nShe descends with her bundle and is ready to leave. Gennaro pleads with her. As if lost in a reverie, with eyes half-closed, she recalls how Rafaele offered to steal the jewels of the Madonna for her. Gennaro, at first shocked at the sacrilege in the mere suggestion, appears to yield gradually to a desperate intention. He bars the way to Maliella, locks the gate, and stands facing her. Laughing derisively, she ascends the stairs again.\n\nHe goes to a cupboard under the stairs, takes out a box, opens it by the light of the lamp at the table, selects several skeleton keys and files, wraps them in a piece of leather, which he hides under his coat, takes a look at Maliella's window, crosses himself, and sneaks out.\n\nFrom the direction of the sea a chorus of men's voices is heard. Rafaele appears at the gate with his Camorrist friends. To the accompaniment of their mandolins and guitars he sings a serenade to Maliella. The girl comes down into the garden. Then they sing a love duet, she promising that she will join him tomorrow. Then Rafaele's comrades signal that someone is coming.\n\nLeft to herself, she sees Gennaro's open tool box, by moonlight. As if in answer to her presentiment of what it signifies, he appears with a bundle wrapped in red cloth. He throws back the folds of the damask and spreads out on the table, for Maliella, the jewels of the Madonna.\n\nIn an ecstasy, Maliella envisions in Gennaro the man who promised her these jewels—Rafaele, and yields herself to Gennaro's embrace.\n\n\"A hidden refuge of the Camorrists on the outskirts of Naples\"\n\nOn the left wall is a rough fresco of the Madonna, whose image was borne in procession the previous day. In front of it is a sort of altar.\n\nThe Camorrists gather. They are men and women, all the latter of doubtful character. There is singing with dancing—the \"Apache,\" the \"Tarantelle.\" Stella, Concetta, Serena, and Grazia, the dancer, are the principal women. They do not anticipate Maliella's expected arrival with much pleasure. When Rafaele comes in, they ask him what he admires in her. In his answer, \"Non sapete... di Maliella\" (know you not of Maliella), he tells them her chief charm is that he will be the first man to whom she has yielded herself.\n\nIn the midst of an uproar of shouting and dancing, while Rafaele, standing on a table, cracks a whip, Maliella rushes in. In an agony she cries out that, in a trance, she gave herself up to Gennaro. The women laugh derisively at Rafaele, who has just sung of her as being inviolable to all but himself. There is not a touch of mysticism about Rafaele. That she should have confused Gennaro with him, and so have yielded herself to the young blacksmith, does not appeal to him at all. For him she is a plucked rose to be left to wither. Furiously he rejects her, flings her to the ground. The jewels of the Madonna fall from her cloak. They are readily recognized; for they are depicted in the rough fresco on the wall.\n\nGennaro, who has followed her to the haunt of the Camorrists, enters. He is half mad. Maliella, laughing hysterically, flings the jewels at his feet, shrieking that he stole them for her. The crowd, as superstitious as it is criminal, recoils from both intruders. The women fall to their knees. Rafaele curses the girl. At his command, the band disperses. Maliella goes out to drown herself in the sea. \"Madonna dei dolor! Miserere!\" (Madonna of our pain, have pity), prays Gennaro. His thoughts revert to his mother. \"Deh non piangere, O Mamma mia\" (Ah! Weep not, beloved mother mine) . Among the débris he finds a knife and plunges it into his heart.\n\nNotes\n\nSources\n\n"}

It is one of the episodes in the \"Star Trek\" universe in which characters from elsewhere in the franchise are extended by Voyager. Reginald Barclay and Deanna Troi from \"\" make appearances, and in addition Jean-Luc Picard is twice mentioned by Troi but not seen. This is also one of the few episodes where a character actually arrives in the Alpha Quadrant, and the only \"Voyager\" episode which has a cast member receiving a writing credit.\n\nBarclay and Troi previously worked together earlier in the season in \"\" (S6E10) and this episode continues that narrative thread and further develops their characters. In addition this brings together elements established by \"\" (S2E3) and connects them with Pathfinder. The relationship between Zimmerman and Barclay is depicted and Jupiter Station is actually shown at Jupiter in special effects shots during this episode.\n\nRobert Picardo plays both Voyager's customized Mark I EMH and his \"father\" Doctor Zimmerman, and another special effect display is shown in numerous scenes together during the episode. Doctor Lewis Zimmerman was previously in \"\" (S4E3) and Deep Space Nine's \"Doctor Bashir, I Presume\"(S5E16).\n\n\"Voyager\" receives a message from Starfleet Command via the improved subspace radio amplifier, stating they believe they have found a way to bring \"Voyager\" back to the Alpha Quadrant within five to six years instead of the decades they had before them. Elated, the crew send back data regarding their journey to date. In Starfleet's reply, they learn that Lewis Zimmerman, the creator of the Doctor's Emergency Medical Hologram program, is dying and no Starfleet medical personnel can determine the reason. The Doctor expresses that because of his experiences in the Delta Quadrant, he may have more insight to Zimmerman's condition, and asks to have his program transferred via subspace to help.\n\nAfter eliminating several of his extraneous subroutines to reduce the program size, the Doctor is sent to a space station orbiting near Jupiter. The station has been Zimmerman's home for the last four years, where he spent much time researching hologram technology, and the entire facility is enabled to allow the Doctor and Zimmerman's holographic female servant, Haley, free rein. The Doctor meets with Reginald Barclay who has been assigned to help Zimmerman before meeting his creator in person. Zimmerman quickly proves to be old and cantankerous, looking down on the Doctor as one of his earlier, outdated Mark I programs that are now all reassigned to perform menial jobs. The Doctor attempts to prove his value to allow examination, but Zimmerman ignores him, and even one point manipulating the Doctor's program to make him his pet for a few hours. The Doctor grows frustrated in trying to help, and the two stop speaking to each other.\n\nWith Zimmerman's health declining, Barclay is able to gain the help of Deanna Troi to help come counsel the situation between the two. After meeting with both, she realizes that both Zimmerman and the Doctor seem to be beyond the point of reason. While discussing the situation, they realize that Haley is a far less advanced hologram program than the Doctor is, yet Zimmerman speaks openly and kindly with her. Troi suspects that Zimmerman's behavior is one of injured pride, and devises a plan where they secretly fiddle with the Doctor's files as to make it appear that his program is failing. Troi and Barclay insist that only Zimmerman can save the Doctor, just as the Doctor can only save him.\n\nZimmerman finally is able get past his wounded pride of the fate of his Mark Is, and fixes the Doctor's program. Zimmerman attempts to add additional programming to the Doctor, but he insists that he is good the way he is. The Doctor then examines Zimmerman, and opts to try an experimental cellular regeneration therapy he had developed while on \"Voyager\". The process is successful, and Zimmerman is soon back in good health. Zimmerman apologizes for his behavior and tells the Doctor that he is proud of him as the only Mark I that has gone well beyond his original programming. After saying his goodbyes, the Doctor is returned to \"Voyager\" and Zimmerman continues his hologram research.\n\nVoyager TV show forming part of The Next Generation TV series \"trilogy\" extends many elements from that Universe including characters that appeared from elsewhere in the franchise. Barclay, Troi, and the Doctor played by the same actors also appear in feature films\n\nMajor characters in the episode:\n\nThere are also several scenes back on Voyager that include the usual primary Voyager crew members. There is also a scene by an Admiral Hayes that plays as a recording for Janeway and Chakotay.\n\nThe episode takes place in two previously introduced locations in the fictional Star Trek universe.\n\nThe episode was noted as one of the top twenty funniest episodes of the Star Trek franchise. (The franchise had over 700 plus television episodes at that time)\n\nIn 2017, \"Den of Geek\" included this on their abbreviated watch guide for \"Star Trek: Voyager\", picking out this episode on their cross-overs roadmap pointing out the role of Barclay.\n\n\n"}

His leadership enabled the New South Wales Labor Party to recover after the split over conscription and to allow it to continue to be a left-wing pragmatist rather than a socialist party.\n\nStorey was born at or near Huskisson, New South Wales, Australia to English immigrant parents, William John, a shipbuilder, and Elizabeth Graham. His family moved to Balmain when he was six, but his father died soon afterwards. He was educated at Darling Road Superior Public School and at night school. At fourteen he was apprenticed to boilermaking with Perdriau and West and then worked at Mort's Dock. He helped found the Balmain Cricket Club in 1897 and was a leading all-rounder for its top grade team. He was a member of the United Society of Boilermakers and Iron Ship Builders of New South Wales. In 1908 Storey was a founder of the Balmain District Rugby League Football Club.\n\nStorey joined the Labor Electoral League, the precursor of the Labor Party, on its foundation in 1891, and was elected to represent Balmain North in the Legislative Assembly in 1901. Although he was an effective parliamentarian, he was beaten for election to the recreated seat of Balmain by Walter Anderson in 1904, but defeated Anderson in 1907. The McGowen Labor Government came to power in 1910, but Storey did not nominate for election to Cabinet.\n\nIn 1916, the non-parliamentary party attempted to discipline Premier William Holman, and elected a Cabinet headed by Storey on 27 April. The party reversed that decision on 4 May and Storey handed back power to Holman, although legally there had never been any transfer of power. However, the split in the party widened further with the dispute over conscription and, in November, Holman, along with Prime Minister Billy Hughes, were expelled from the party. The remnants of the Labor Party were then in opposition to Holman's Nationalist Government, but Storey refused to become party leader and Ernest Durack was elected to that position. Durack resigned unexpectedly in February 1917 and Storey had no choice but to accept the leadership. His good public speaking and amiability helped to reduce the scale of Labor's defeat in the 1917 election. He worked hard in 1918 and 1919 to prevent socialists taking over the party and his policy speech for the 1920 election promised child endowment and suburban rail electrification rather than socialism.\n\nLabor won the 1920 election with a majority of one and Storey became Premier. His thin majority, combined with a substantial minority in Legislative Council (made up of life appointees) and attacks of nephritis made his job hard. His private secretary at this time was V. Gordon Childe, later internationally famous in the field of archaeology, who wrote the book \"How Labor Governs\", based on his experience as Storey's secretary. In June 1920, he appointed Judge Norman Ewing to carry out a royal commission in to the imprisonment of twelve IWW members in 1916 for treason, arson, sedition and forgery. On Ewing's recommendation, ten were released in August. In early 1921, he prorogued Parliament to prevent his Government being overthrown during a six months absence to visit financiers and a Harley Street doctor in London. Despite the warnings of his doctor, he undertook heavy work in London and on his return to Sydney in July.\n\nHe was admitted to hospital and died at Clermont Private Hospital, Darlinghurst and was survived by his wife, three sons and two of his three daughters. His funeral service was held at St. Andrew's Cathedral on 7 October 1921, and he was buried at the Field Of Mars Cemetery the same day.\n\nIn 1926, Premier Jack Lang opened the John Storey Memorial Dispensary in Little Regent Street, Chippendale, New South Wales. It served as a practical memorial to John Storey and still functions as a pathology clinic.\n\n \n"}

His first chivalresque work, \"Lisurate de Grecia\" (nephew of Amadis de Gaula), was published in 1514. It is a relatively short work. His Amadis of Greece (1530) continued the success enjoyed by this first work. \"Amadis of Greece\" is divided into two parts which deal with the adventures of Amadis of Greece, Knight of the Burning Sword, son of Lisuarte of Greece and Onoloria of Trabizond (Trapisonda), as well as his love for both Princess Lucela of France and Princess Niquea of Thebes, whom he subsequently marries.\nSilva followed this work with two others: \"Don Florisel de Niquea\" (Sir Florisel of Nicaea) (1532) – which deals with the knightly adventures and loves of first-born son of Amadís de Grecia and Princess Niquea – and \"Don Rogel de Grecia\" (Sir Rogel of Greece) (1535).

It premiered on 22 November 1898 at the Teatro Costanzi in Rome. The story is set in Japan during legendary times.\n\nIn common with all of Mascagni's full-length operas, \"Iris\" is now rarely performed, even in Italy, although along with \"L'Amico Fritz\" it remains one of the composer's more performed operas. Two of the opera's most memorable numbers are the tenor's serenade (\"Apri la tua finestra\") and the Hymn to the Sun (\"Inno al Sole\").\n\nThe so-called \"aria della piovra\" (\"Octopus aria\"), \"Un dì, ero piccina,\" where Iris describes a screen she had seen in a Buddhist temple when she was a child, depicting an octopus coiling with its tentacles around a young woman, may have been inspired by the print \"The Dream of the Fisherman's Wife\" (1814) by the Japanese artist Hokusai.\n\nAct I\n\nThe opera begins with an invisible choir singing a \"Hymn to the Sun,\" the second best-known piece in the opera.\n\nIris, the young and innocent daughter of a blind old man, Il Cieco, lives happily, enjoying the sun and the simple things of nature. Osaka, a young lord in search of adventures, plans to kidnap her with the help of Kyoto who keeps a geisha house. During a puppet show, Osaka enters disguised as a child of the sun, singing the serenade \"Apri la tua finestra [Open Your Window],\" the most famous selection in the opera. He conquers the heart of Iris, and Samurai carry her off, conducting her to Kyoto's geisha house called Yoshiwara. Before leaving, Kyoto anonymously leaves money on Il Cieco's doorstep, as well as a note telling him where she has gone and implying that she has abandoned him.\n\nAct II\n\nAt Yoshiwara, where, according to the libretto, the sun never penetrates, Iris wakes up under the illusion of having died and gone to Paradise. Osaka arrives and tries to seduce her but fails to persuade her to yield to his advances. Tired and annoyed by her simplicity and innocence, Osaka tells Kyoto to get rid of her. Instead Kyoto, hoping to make some profit off of Iris, exposes her to the crowds on a balcony of the house. Il Cieco, having assumed that Iris went to the geisha house of her own accord, comes there. He curses her, repeatedly flinging mud in her face. She is overwhelmed by sudden madness at her father's incomprehensible actions. Before anyone, including the remorse-stricken Osaka who has returned, can stop her, Iris rushes back into the house and throws herself down a shaft leading to a sewer.\n\nAct III\n\nThe next morning in the sewer, ragpickers begin stealing Iris' silken clothing; she revives, frightening away the ragpickers. She quickly becomes delirious and imagines that she hears the voices of the three men, first Osaka, then Kyoto, and finally Il Cieco, each mocking her. She rejoices when she feels the warm rays of the rising sun, accompanied by a return of the \"Hymn to the Sun,\" and she dies. Tendrils of flowers bear the soul of Iris to heaven.\n\nNotes\n\nSources\n\n"}

The second single, \"Teary Eyed\", was released on August 8, 2005, and failed to chart on any \"Billboard\" chart and charted low in other countries. The third single, \"We Run This\", was released on February 21, 2006, and peaked at number forty-eight on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and charted moderately well internationally.\n\nThe album received generally favorable reviews from critics and peaked at number two on the \"Billboard\" 200. It was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), selling 657,000 copies in the United States and received a Grammy nomination for Best Rap Album, ultimately losing to Kanye West's \"Late Registration\". The music video for \"Lose Control\", directed by Dave Meyers won the Grammy for Best Short Form Music Video.\n\nThe title \"The Cookbook\" derived of Elliott feeling \"no two records are going to sound alike; each record has its own spices and herbs. Each record is cooking up a hot recipe for a hot album.\" The black and white cover features Elliott posing with a vintage microphone in a 1920s juke joint. She explained the cover, saying, \"I wanted people to see I was taking music back to the roots—not just hip hop, but our ancestors. Whether they was on railroad tracks or cooking in somebody's kitchen, they was always singing.\"\n\nIn an interview with \"Billboard\" magazine, Elliott said, \"I really do think this is my best album. I was in a really great space with this album. I wasn't in a great space with some of the other albums I've done.\" She went on to say, \"I played Lil' Kim the album the other day, and she told me it was incredible and that there was not one song on it that she didn't like.\"\n\nIn January 2005, it was revealed Elliott had been working on a new album. Two months later, Ciara confirmed she would appear on the album, singing and rapping on the potential first untitled single at the time. Elliott worked on \"The Cookbook\" with such producers as the Neptunes, Rich Harrison and Scott Storch. The album included only two songs produced by Timbaland, who produced most or all songs on Elliott's previous albums. She explained, \"Me and Tim, this like our sixth album, so if we go any further left, we gonna be on Mars somewhere. We've done everything it is to do. I think both of us came to a spot where we didn't know where to go with each other.\" She said Timbaland was very involved with the album, supporting or opposing certain producers. Elliott went on to say, \"I was eight songs deep and I let Tim listen and he was like, 'Nah, you're going in the wrong direction. You trippin'.' I had to go back in the studio and come up with new records. [When he heard those], he was like, 'This is the Missy people are listening to.'\"\n\nThe first, \"Lose Control\", was released on May 27, 2005, and peaked at number three on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart, number six on the \"Billboard\" Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs and number two on the \"Billboard\" Pop 100. The single also peaked at number two on the New Zealand RIANZ Singles Chart and in the top ten in four other countries. A Dave Meyers-directed promotional video accompanied the song; it was the most played video on BET and MTV2 and second most played video in the United States. It went on to win a Grammy Award for Best Short Form Music Video, while the song itself received a nomination for Best Rap Song.\n\nThe second single, \"Teary Eyed\", was released on August 8, 2005; it failed to chart except in Australia and Switzerland. The music video for the song was directed by Antti J. Jokinen and was filmed \"like a movie\". It features Elliott responding to a relationship that had gone wrong.\n\nThe third single, \"We Run This\", was released on February 21, 2006, and peaked at number 48 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and number 39 on the \"Billboard\" Pop 100 and peaked in the top forty in Australia, Ireland and the United Kingdom. An edited version of the song was used as the theme song for the gymnastics-themed film \"Stick It\", as well as for the music video, which was directed by Dave Meyers. The video features a cameo by gold-medalist Dominique Dawes as Elliott's gymnastics coach, with scenes from the film being used throughout the video. The song received a Grammy nomination for Best Rap Solo Performance.\n\n\"The Cookbook\" received positive reviews from most music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 74, based on 28 reviews, which indicates \"generally favorable reviews\". Rich Juzwiak of \"Stylus Magazine\" gave the album an A rating, stating \"Her adventurous and, yes, massive, persona is allowed to wander wherever it wants on \"The Cookbook\", be it avant or common.\" Alexis Petridis of \"The Guardian\" wrote, \"\"The Cookbook\" is a convincing return to form... Sounding as unique and startling and formidable as ever, Missy Elliott is clearly not a woman to be messed with.\" John Bush of AllMusic noted that \"Elliott forces a few rhymes, plays to type with her themes, and uses those outside producers to follow trends in hip-hop... What's different here is how relaxed Elliott is, how willing she seems to simply go with what comes naturally and sounds best.\" \"Q\" stated \"If not Elliott's most inventive album, \"The Cookbook\" is certainly her most colourful and entertaining\".\n\nHowever, Ben Sisario of \"Blender\" wrote, \"For every killer raise-your-hands hook there is a snoozer of an SWV-esque torch ballad, and she can't seem to tell the difference.\" He went on to say, \"Almost half the songs are treacly Kleenex soul ballads; even the titles...bring a cringe.\" \"Los Angeles Times\" writer Natalie Nichols found that \"her souffle of hip-hop, soul, R&B, funk and dance music falls a bit flat\". \"Rolling Stone\"s Brian Hiatt called \"The Cookbook\" Elliott's \"least cohesive, most conventional album yet.\" \"Entertainment Weekly\"s Margeaux Watson viewed that \"she's clearly lost without Timbaland\", calling him \"the main ingredient of her original flavor\". Steve Horowitz of \"PopMatters\" noted that it \"does have a few duds\" and found some of the \"offensive lyrics\" as flaws, but wrote that \"While not every cut is a winner, Elliott does a fairly consistent job of gaining the listener's attention through her outrageous lyrics and performance style\".\n\n\"Pitchfork\"s Ryan Dombal found the album \"Even more bipolar than usual\", with Elliott \"jolting from uber-hypeness to soul-crushing balladry. Fortunately, supported by an array of producers both grizzly and green, her invaluable unpredictability is alternately harnessed and given new life on this album, despite its uneven and transitional nature.\" Joan Morgan of \"The Village Voice\" complimented Elliott's \"ability to capture the ain't-afraid-to-sweat flava\" and stated \"Elliott mines the best of hip-hop's old-school elements for throwback tracks that are engagingly sparse and elemental\". In his consumer guide for \"The Village Voice\", critic Robert Christgau gave \"The Cookbook\" an A- rating, indicating \"the kind of garden-variety good record that is the great luxury of musical micromarketing and overproduction\". Christgau called it a \"benchmark album\" and commented that \"Elliott showcases the musical health of African American pop [...] Elliott's disinclination to give it up to gangsta's thrill cult or black pop's soft-focus porn, plus her proven ability to work a good beat when she gets one, leads her naturally to a collection that ebbs and flows, peaks and dips, and pokes fun at any canon of taste you got\".\n\nThe album was nominated at the 2006 Grammy Awards for Best Rap Album, but lost to Kanye West's \"Late Registration\".\n\nThe album debuted at number two on the \"Billboard\" 200, selling 176,000 copies in the first week of release. It has sold 657,000 copies in the United States and has been certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America. \"The Cookbook\" peaked in the top thirty in Australia, Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway and Switzerland.\n\n\n"}

The term was coined by Erik Satie in 1917.\n\nAlthough other selections of Erik Satie's music can be experienced (and are sometimes indicated) as furniture music, Satie himself applied the name only to five short pieces, composed in three separate sets:\nThe first set was apparently never performed (nor the score published) during Satie's lifetime.\n\nThe second set contained reminiscences of popular tunes by, amongst others, Camille Saint-Saëns and Ambroise Thomas. It was premiered in Paris the year it was composed, as intermission music to a lost comedy by Max Jacob. During these intermissions the audience was invited to visit an exposition of children's drawings in the Galerie Barbazanges that was hosting the premiere.\n\nIndications of the intentions of the artists giving the first performance are found in the manuscript of the score:\n\nFurnishing divertissement organised by the group of musicians known as the \"Nouveaux Jeunes\"\n\nFurnishing music replaces \"waltzes\" and \"operatic fantasias\" etc. Don't be confused! \"It's something else!!!\" No more \"false music\"\n\nFurnishing music completes one's property;\n\nit's new; it doesn't upset customs; it isn't tiring; it's French; it won't wear out; it \"isn't boring\"\n\n\"--quoted in Gillmor, 1988, p 325-326\"\nSee also the Entr'acte article for more details regarding the circumstances of this first, and only documented, public performance of furniture music during Satie's lifetime, assisted by the composer himself.\n\nThe separate commissioned piece was sent to America. There are no known public performances or publications of this music prior to leaving the European continent. This piece is sometimes presented as \"furniture music No. 3\".\n\nAs Satie's pieces of furniture music were very short pieces, with an indefinite number of repeats, this kind of furniture music later became associated with repetitive music (sometimes used as a synonym of minimal music), but this kind of terminology did not yet exist in Satie's time.\n\nFor a quarter of a century after the composer's death, all of the furniture music pieces remained hidden from the general public, apart from being mentioned in early Satie biographies. By the end of the 1960s parts of the furniture music started to appear as facsimile illustrations to press articles and new Satie biographies. The first full publication of sets 1 and 3 followed in the early 1970s. There was no full publication of the second set before the last years of the 20th century.\n\nSeveral decades after Satie's death, furniture music was revived, largely due to the American composer John Cage, as the composer's theory of minimalist background music. Furniture music appeared as the launchpad for minimalist/experimental/avant-garde music since it was the first instance of music being played or produced out of context: not as a centerpiece but as a cerebral backdrop.\n\nThese and other related ideas were picked up by several composers of the neoclassical/20th-century school of music, accentuating atmosphere and texture over traditional form and movement. The minimalist references and anachronisms were not solidified until composer John Cage performed Satie's \"hidden\" piece \"Vexations\" 840 times as requested by Satie's own scribbled notes on the original sheet music.\n\n\n"}

Myers\n\nJames Edward Myers (October 26, 1919 Philadelphia – May 10, 2001 Bonita Springs) was an American songwriter, music publisher, actor, director, producer, and raconteur.\nMyers is best known as the credited co-writer of \"Rock Around the Clock\" for which he used the pseudonym \"Jimmy DeKnight\". Myers is credited as co-writer, with Max C. Freedman, though doubt has been cast as to whether Myers actually participated in the writing of the song.\n\nMyers came from a musical family in Philadelphia. His father played drums and his mother played piano. Myers became a drummer. He formed his first band when he was fourteen called Jimmy Myers and The Truckadeers Orchestra. He later formed a band called Jimmy DeKnight and His Knights of Rhythm for which he composed the song \"Things That You Say\". James was Jewish.\n\nHe served in the Pacific during World War II. He returned to Philadelphia after the war where he joined up with Jack Howard to form Cowboy Records. He first met Bill Haley at the WPWA record station pitching records to the radio host in Chester, Pennsylvania. \n\nThe song \"Rock Around the Clock\" was published in early 1953 by his publishing company Myers Music in Philadelphia. Myers first pitched the song to Bill Haley. Although Bill Haley & His Comets were supposed to be the first to record it, a dispute between Myers and Dave Miller, Haley's producer for Essex Records prevented Haley from doing so (though Haley later claimed he tried several times to record it at Essex). Myers was convinced, however, that the song would be a hit. He organized the recording of the song on Arcade Records. The first recording of the song was made by an Italian-American band, Sonny Dae & His Knights. It was released as a 45 single but failed to chart. Haley finally recorded it in April 1954 for Decca Records and in 1955, following its popular use in the opening credits of the film \"Blackboard Jungle\", the song became the first No. 1 record of the Rock and Roll era.\n\nMyers' songwriting career dated back to the 1940s, and his DeKnight moniker appears on several country and western recordings made by Haley in the 1949-51 era. He co-wrote with Tom Gindhart and copyrighted the song \"Ten Gallon Stetson (With a Hole in the Crown)\" in 1948, a song which Bill Haley recorded on Keystone Records and released in 1950. \"Ten Gallon Stetson\" was the first release by Bill Haley and the Saddlemen, a group which would evolve into Bill Haley with Haley's Comets and Bill Haley and His Comets.\n\nMyers formed Myers Music in Philadelphia to publish songs, and oversaw many of his own compositions as well as a number of Haley originals such as \"Rock-a-Beatin' Boogie\". It is also believed that Myers played drums on an early recording by Haley's pre-Comets group, the Saddlemen, though this has yet to be definitively confirmed. A later claim by Myers (cited in John Swenson's biography \"Bill Haley: The Daddy of Rock and Roll\") that he played drums on \"Rock Around the Clock\" has been disproven by the existence of an official recording session document indicating the drummer was Billy Gussak.\n\nThe relationship between Myers and Haley collapsed in 1955-56 when Myers began providing songs to The Jodimars, a group made up of former Comets. Myers co-wrote the song \"Rattle My Bones\" with Jesse Stone (who, under the name Charles Calhoun, wrote the lyrically similar \"Shake, Rattle and Roll\") for The Jodimars in 1956, which was released as the B side of a single on Capitol Records.\n\nHe recorded his own instrumental versions of \"Rock Around the Clock\" in 1959 as Jimmy DeKnight and His Knights of Rhythm , which were released as a 45 single on several record labels, Apt, Peak, President in the UK, and Arzee in 1979. One version was the song arranged in the cha cha format as \"Rock Around the Clock Cha Cha\". Although credited to DeKnight, it is not known what instruments, if any, Myers played on these recordings.\n\nHe described the composition of the seminal song \"Rock Around the Clock\". He stated that the melody was developing and evolving for several years before he wrote it down on paper. He was playing the tune on a piano in his office when his friend composer Max C. Freedman joined in.\n\n\"When we finished it he said, `What are you going to call it?' I said, 'Rock Around The Clock,\"' Myers said in an interview with the Rockabilly Hall of Fame in Burns, Tenn.\n\n\"And he said, `Why rock? What's that mean? Why not \"Dance Around The Clock?\"' And I said, 'I just have a gut feeling and since I'm half writer and whole publisher, I'm the boss! Right!' So, we called it 'Rock Around The Clock.'\"\n\nMyers co-wrote a series of songs with Freedman, among which were \"The Covered Wagon Goes Roll, Roll, Rollin'\", \"The Sun Came Through\", \"A Bucket Full of Tears\", \"Make Believe Island\", \"Adalita\", \"Let Me Know\", \"The Password\", \"Can You Spare a Moment (For the Lord)\", and \"A Bushel of Sunbeams\" and \"You're a Long Time Dead\" which were also copyrighted in 1953 and published by Myers Music and Standard Songs respectively.\n\nIn later years, Myers turned to acting, appearing in small roles in a number of films such as \"The China Syndrome\"; he also directed at least two films under his Jimmy DeKnight nom de plume. He also wrote an autobiography based upon his experiences in World War II entitled \"Hell in a Foxhole\", , ( which , either by parody or coincidence , is nearly the same title given to the fictional film in the 1956 ' Phil Silvers Show ' episode ' Hollywood ', which was called ' Love in a Foxhole ' . He also opened a museum in his home dedicated to \"Rock Around the Clock\".\n\nMyers died in Bonita Springs, Florida, on May 10, 2001, at the age of 81. \n\n\n"}

Together with Arthur C. Krebs and his brother Paul, in 1884 he constructed \"La France\", which made its maiden flight on 9 August 1884 at Chalais-Meudon, making a 23-minute circular flight. This was the first time that a flying machine made a flight which returned to the place of take-off. It was later exhibited at the Paris Exposition Universelle (1889).\n\nHe also proposed a now widely used system of preferred numbers known as Renard numbers that was later named after him and became international standard ISO 3. It helped the French army to reduce the number of different balloon ropes kept on inventory from 425 to 17.\n\nColonel Renard invented the Renard Road Train first developed by Darracq and displayed by them in 1903 later developed in England by Daimler. The leading motor unit having generated the power transmits it by a continuous shaft united between the carriages by a universal joint to the driving wheels of each carriage. These, each carriage being six-wheeled, are the central pair and are shod with iron, the resulting road-shock being taken by the springs and rubber tyres on the other wheels. Each vehicle is steered by its predecessor through a series of rods and linkages and when a Renard train rounds a corner each vehicle follows precisely in the track of its predecessor. They were powered by a 16.1 litre Daimler engine and the last carriage always cut the corner\n\nDepressed by the French governments's refusal to fund his experiments and the rejection of his candidacy for membership of the French \"Académie des Sciences\" he committed suicide in April 1905.

The Cistercian Abbey of St Mary was founded in 1147 by Simon de Senlis grandson of Judith of Lens, niece of William the Conqueror who owned land in many parts of Britain but built her Manor in Sawtry and whom the Parish of Sawtry Judith is named after. The abbey took 91 years to complete and ministered to the local area both spiritually and physically. This was demolished in 1540 during the Dissolution of the Monasteries as part of the English Reformation, although traces of the Abbey still remain.\n\nSawtry is twinned with the Gemeinde Weimar region in Germany.\n\nAs a civil parish, Sawtry has a parish council consisting of fifteen councillors. The village is represented on Huntingdonshire District Council by two councillors for the Sawtry ward, and on Cambridgeshire County Council by one councillor for the electoral division of \"Sawtry and Ellington.\" It is in the parliamentary constituency of North West Cambridgeshire, represented at the House of Commons by Shailesh Vara (Conservative).\n\nSawtry was in the historic and administrative county of Huntingdonshire until 1965. From 1965, the village was part of the new administrative county of Huntingdon and Peterborough. Then in 1974, following the Local Government Act 1972, Sawtry became a part of the county of Cambridgeshire.\n\nSawtry is just west of the Fens, halfway between the city of Peterborough and the town of Huntingdon. Other nearby villages include Folksworth, Alconbury, Holme, Yaxley and Stilton. Being situated in close proximity to the A1(M), it is a sought-after location for commuters. It is approximately six miles north of the A14, and a fifty-minute car drive from both Stansted Airport and Luton Airport.\n\nThe Bullock Road, an ancient droveway, now a byway, runs on the ridge to the west of Sawtry.\n\nThe A1M, originally the Roman Ermine Street, then the Great North Road, runs immediately to the east of the village.\n\nThe East Coast Main Line railway runs a mile east of the village.\n\nOrdnance Survey maps from the 1920s show a narrow gauge agricultural tramway running for a mile north east from Sawtry Roughs Farm (now demolished) to an interchange with the then Great Northern Railway.\n\nIn the period 1801 to 1901 the population of Sawtry was recorded every ten years by the UK census. During this time the population was in the range of 790 (the lowest was in 1801) and 1,393 (the highest was in 1851).\n\nFrom 1901, a census was taken every ten years with the exception of 1941 (due to the Second World War).\n\nIn 2011, the parish covered an area of and the population density of Sawtry in 2011 was 667.3 persons per square mile (257.6 per square kilometre).\n\nSawtry has two public houses: The Bell and the Greystones. It also has an ex-services and working men's club. There is an infant school and a junior school in Sawtry; and a community college (Sawtry Village Academy) which educates many young people from nearby villages as well as Sawtry itself. Other amenities also include the local butchers, doctors, vets, garage, takeaway houses, the Co-Op, and multiple hair and beauty salons.\n\nThe Church of All Saints is the Church of England parish church. Methodist Worship takes place at Sawtry Methodist Church. There is also a Roman Catholic community, served by the parish of St Luke, Peterborough.\n\n"}

The term \"curve\" refers to the bell curve, the graphical representation of the probability density of the normal distribution, but this method can be used to achieve any desired distribution of the grades – for example, a uniform distribution.\n\nOne method of grading on a curve uses three steps: \n\nFor example, if there are five grades in a particular university course, A, B, C, D, and F, where A is reserved for the top 20% of students, B for the next 30%, C for the next 30%-40%, and D or F for the remaining 10%-20%, then scores in the percentile interval from 0% to 20% will receive a grade of D or F, scores from 21% to 50% will receive a grade of C, scores from 51% to 80% receive a grade of B, and scores from 81% to 100% will achieve a grade of A.\n\nConsistent with the example illustrated above, a grading curve allows academic institutions to ensure the distribution of students across certain grade point average (GPA) thresholds. As many professors establish the curve to target a course average of a C, the corresponding grade point average equivalent would be a 2.0 on a standard 4.0 scale employed at most North American universities. Similarly, a grade point average of 3.0 on a 4.0 scale would indicate that the student is within the top 20% of the class. Grading curves serve to attach additional significance to these figures, and the specific distribution employed may vary between academic institutions.\n\nThe ultimate objective of grading curves is to minimize or eliminate the influence of variation between different instructors of the same course, ensuring that the students in any given class are assessed relative to their peers. This also circumvents problems associated with utilizing multiple versions of a particular examination, a method often employed where test administration dates vary between class sections. Regardless of any difference in the level of difficulty, real or perceived, the grading curve ensures a balanced distribution of academic results.\n\nHowever, curved grading can increase competitiveness between students and affect their sense of faculty fairness in a class. Students are generally most upset in the case that the curve lowered their grade compared to what they would have received if a curve was not used. To ensure that this does not happen, teachers usually put forth effort to ensure that the test itself is hard enough when they intend to use a grading curve, such that they would expect the average student to get a lower raw score than the score intended to be used at the average in the curve, thus ensuring that all students benefit from the curve. Thus, curved grades cannot be blindly used and must be carefully considered and pondered compared to alternatives such as criterion-referenced grading. Furthermore, constant misuse of curved grading can adjust grades on poorly designed tests, whereas assessments should be designed to accurately reflect the learning objectives set by the instructor.\n\n\n"}

It was the performance on which her reputation was founded. James Agate was ecstatic...\" For a decade Dresdel was regarded as one of England's foremost stage actresses. Her leading role in the 1947 film \"While I Live\" also gained her a great deal of acclaim. In the film she plays Julia Trevelyan, a spinster living in a lonely cliff top house in Cornwall and haunted by the death of her sister 25 years earlier.\n\nHer best remembered role is as Mrs. Baines in the film version of Graham Greene's \"The Fallen Idol\" (1948), which starred Ralph Richardson, Michèle Morgan and Bobby Henrey.

Fox, Gena Rowlands and Joan Jett. It was written and directed by Paul Schrader. The original music score was composed by Thomas Newman and the cinematography is by John Bailey.\n\nFox and Jett play a brother and sister who are lead performers in The Barbusters, a rock band, in Cleveland, Ohio. The sister, Patti Rasnick, is an unmarried mother and has a troubled relationship with her own mother, who is deeply religious. Estranged from her parents and struggling to make ends meet, Patti decides to dive headlong into a carefree rock music lifestyle. The brother, Joe Rasnick, pulls away from rock music to provide some stability for his young nephew. It takes a family crisis to bring Patti back home and force her to face the past with her mother.\n\nA young Trent Reznor appears, with other members of Exotic Birds in the film as a member of fictional band The Problems as well as local teen band, The Pelicans, as The Bubblegummers. The Fabulous Thunderbirds perform in the movie as themselves. Ron Dean has a cameo as one of the attendees of Patti's funeral home, and Alan Poul appears as a cashier.\n\nThe film was shot on location in Chicago, Illinois; Maywood, Illinois; Berwyn, Illinois; Blue Island, Illinois; Lincolnwood, Illinois; Hammond, Indiana; and Cleveland, Ohio.\n\nThe film is best known as the first real attempt for Fox to take on more serious film roles after establishing himself as a comedic star. \"Light of Day\" is one of the few projects where Fox has smoked in front of the camera; although a chain smoker, he avoided being photographed with a cigarette out of fear that it would encourage smoking.\n\nBruce Springsteen wrote and composed the song \"Light of Day\" specifically for the film; Joan Jett performed the song for the film's soundtrack. Schrader's original working title for the film was \"Born in the USA.\" He showed the script to Springsteen to make sure he got the details right about a blue-collar bar band. Springsteen ended up using the title for a song he had been writing about a Vietnam veteran, and as a result, the Barbusters's signature song, which he provided, gave the film its eventual title. Starting from the late 1980s and during the 1990s, Springsteen himself used the song to close his concerts.\n\nSchrader has expressed dissatisfaction with \"Light of Day,\" particularly its plain visual style: \"I had progressed from being a person with a literary vision to a person with a visual vision, and in that film I tried to...suppress my new literacy,\" and the casting of Joan Jett: \"it's a good performance, but...that piece of casting just did not work.\"\n\nIn a review for the \"Chicago Sun-Times\", critic Roger Ebert gave the film three-and-a-half out of four stars and called it the \"most direct and painful statement\" of a theme explored in Schrader's previous films—\"wildly different characters with one thing in common: Their pasts keep them imprisoned, and shut them off from happiness in the present.\" Ebert found Rowlands' acting \"powerfully, heartbreakingly effective\" and said that Jett matches to Rowlands' inspiration in \"the most surprisingly good performance.\"\n\nIn \"The New York Times\", Janet Maslin stated \"Bruce Springsteen wrote the rousing title song and reportedly took the phrase \"Born in the U.S.A.\" from an earlier draft of Mr. Schrader's screenplay. It's possible, even from the finished film, to see what he and Mr. Schrader might share. One of the monologues included on Mr. Springsteen's recent live album describes his boyhood dream of becoming a rock-and-roller and proving something to his family, to himself, to the world; those ambitions are described in terms of musical triumph, not money or fame. \"Light of Day\" wants to embody a similar dream, but it pulls its punches. Mr. Schrader may have started out to make a film about the fiercest, most incorruptible stirrings of young talent. But he wound up making a soap opera along the way.\"\n\n\"Variety\" criticized the film's writing, mocking the film's family as \"anyfamily USA as written by Eugene O’Neill.\" The publication was mixed toward the film's casting, writing that while Rowlands did well with the material, Fox was miscast for his character, and \"Jett looks the part and even manages to hit the mark from time to time, but for every hit there’s a miss.\" The magazine also found Patti's obsession with rock-and-roll as an escape mechanism to be \"childish and silly.\"\n\n\"Light of Day\" holds a rating of 53% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 15 reviews.\n\nThe soundtrack to the film was released in 1987. As a single, \"Light of Day\" reached number 33 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and received additional album-oriented rock airplay due to the connection of Joan Jett and Bruce Springsteen.

The first performance was at Lincoln Center, New York City on April 20, 1972, by the music department of the Juilliard School with John Houseman as stage director, Gerhard Samuel as the conductor and Alvin Ailey as the choreographer. A performance of a revised version, by the composer, took place in 1985 with the New York Opera Repertory Theater.\n\nThe composer himself had great affection for this opera. The premiere production received mixed reviews, with one particularly negative one from Harold C.

They learn that Byron had written his memoirs, which causes them concern for his reputation. The statue of Byron arrives, which sets off memories in the minds of Byron's relations and friends. These include the courtship of Byron with his future wife. However, the memories also include that Byron committed incest with his half-sister Augusta Leigh and fathered her daughter, which led to Byron's self-exile and Byron's wife insisting that he must never see Augusta again. While they have not read Byron's own manuscript, their memories cause enough fear that they burn the memoirs. The Dean of the Abbey arrives, and upon learning that the relatives considered Byron's memoirs unfit for reading, he denies permission to have Byron buried in Westminster Abbey. At the end of the opera, the shades of the poets in the Abbey's Poets' Corner welcome Byron among them.\n\n\nIn addition, excerpts from the opera, called \"Five Tenor Songs from \"Lord Byron\"\", have been recorded, with the following artists: Martyn Hill, tenor; Budapest Symphony Orchestra; James Bolle, conductor.\n\n"}

De Long, undertook the \"Jeannette\" expedition of 1879–1881 to the Arctic. After being trapped in the ice and drifting for almost two years, the ship and her crew of 33 were released from the ice, then trapped again, crushed and sunk some north of the Siberian coast. The entire crew survived the sinking, but 11 died while sailing towards land in a small cutter. The others reached Siberia, but nine subsequently perished in the Lena Delta, including De Long.\n\nThe vessel had begun her active career in 1861 as HMS \"Pandora\", a Royal Navy gunboat. After more than a decade's service off the West African coast and in the Mediterranean, \"Pandora\" was retired from duty and sold as a private yacht to a British explorer, Allen Young. Young took her on two voyages to the Arctic, in 1875 and 1876, before selling her to James Gordon Bennett Jr., proprietor of \"The New York Herald\", who changed her name to \"Jeannette\". Although she sailed to the Arctic under the U.S. flag as USS \"Jeannette\", subject to naval laws and discipline, Bennett remained responsible for the costs of the expedition.\n\nThe ship that became USS \"Jeannette\" began her life as a Royal Navy gunboat, built at the Pembroke Naval Dockyards in 1860. She was of wooden construction, in length and at the beam, with a draft of . Her tonnage, calculated by Builder's Measure, was 428 tons, with a displacement of 570 tons. She was rigged as a barque, but her principal means of propulsion was by a steam-driven screw. Her armament was five guns.\n\nAfter her launch on 7 February 1861, \"Pandora\" was taken from Pembroke to Portsmouth Dockyard, where she was fitted with her engines and boilers, and underwent trials before commissioning. On October 22, she concluded her trials successfully, achieving a speed of 9.25 knots over a measured mile.\n\nIn November 1861, during the American Civil War, the diplomatic incident known as the \"Trent\" affair caused the Admiralty to bring additional ships into active service. On 27 December 1861, \"Pandora\" was formally commissioned, as tender to , and the following day sailed for Liverpool where \"Majestic\" was berthed. The crisis was quickly resolved; \"Pandora\" remained at Liverpool until January 1862 before returning to Portsmouth.\n\nIn April 1863, \"Pandora\" left Portsmouth for service off the coast of West Africa. She returned after four years, and was transferred to the reserve. In April 1868, she was recommissioned, and returned to West Africa. Two years later she was transferred to the Mediterranean squadron, based at Valletta, Malta. This was her last commission in British naval service. In July 1872, after two years in the Mediterranean she returned to Spithead, where she was taken out of active commission and berthed in Portsmouth as part of the steam reserve.\n\nIn 1875, \"Pandora\" was acquired from the navy by the yachtsman Allen Young, for use in one of the last expeditions sent to the Canadian Arctic to investigate the disappearance, 30 years previously, of the Franklin expedition. Young sailed in June 1875, seeking not only for signs of Franklin but to discover and complete the Northwest Passage, then unconquered. He was unsuccessful on both counts; he found no traces of Franklin and was stopped by ice in Peel Sound, and he returned to England. One of the financiers for this venture was James Gordon Bennett Jr., the owner of \"The New York Herald\".\n\nIn 1876, Young took \"Pandora\" north again, for a second attempt on the Northwest Passage. He was diverted by a request from the Admiralty to look for the British Arctic Expedition under George Nares, which was engaged in an attempt to reach the North Pole from Smith Sound. The expedition did not require \"Pandora's\" assistance, and Young returned home. In 1877, Young sold \"Pandora\" to Bennett, who was planning his own Arctic expedition.\n\nBennett's plan was to sail a vessel through the Bering Strait, on the theory that the warm Pacific Ocean current known as the Kuro Siwo would provide a \"thermometric gateway\" whereby a suitable ship might reach the North Pole. This was the primary objective, but the ship was also equipped for scientific observation. By agreement with the U.S. Department of the Navy, Bennett would finance the expedition, but would sail under naval laws and discipline, and would be commanded by a naval officer, George W. De Long. \"Pandora\" was renamed \"Jeannette\", after Bennett's sister, and in January 1879 arrived at the Mare Island Naval Shipyard, to be fitted for Arctic service.\n\"Jeannette\" departed San Francisco on 8 July 1879. She sent her last communication to Washington from Saint Lawrence Bay, Chukotka, on 27 August. Shortly afterwards she encountered ice, of increasing severity as she pushed her way forward to Herald Island. On 7 September, she was caught fast in the ice at . For the next 21 months, \"Jeannette\" drifted in an erratic fashion, generally to the northwest but frequently doubling back on herself.\n\nIn May 1881, two islands were discovered, which De Long named Henrietta Island—after Bennett's mother—and Jeannette Island. On the night of 12 June, when they had reached , the pressure of the ice finally began to crush the \"Jeannette\". De Long and his men unloaded provisions and equipment onto the ice, and watched as the ship continued moaning through the night and finally disappeared beneath the water in the early morning of June 13.\n\nThe expedition began the long trek to the Siberian coast, hauling their sledges with boats and supplies. On their way they discovered a further island which they named Bennett Island in honor of the expedition's sponsor. After reaching the New Siberian Islands and gaining some food and rest, the party took to their three boats on September 12 for the last stage of their journey to the Lena Delta, their planned landfall. As a violent storm blew up, one of the boats—with lieutenant Charles W. Chipp and seven men—capsized and sank. The other two craft, commanded by De Long and chief engineer George W. Melville with 14 and 11 men respectively, survived the severe weather but landed at widely separated points on the delta.\n\nThe party headed by De Long began the long march inland over the marshy, half-frozen delta to hoped-for native settlements. After much hardship, with many of his men severely weakened, De Long sent the two strongest, William F. C. Nindemann and Louis P. Noros, ahead for help; they eventually found a settlement and survived. De Long and his 11 companions died of cold and starvation. In the meantime, on the other side of the delta, Melville and his party had found a native village and were rescued. Melville persuaded a group of locals to help him search for his commander. He succeeded in finding their landing place on the delta, and recovered De Long's logbook and other important records but returned without locating the De Long group. In the following spring, Melville set out again, and found the bodies of De Long and his companions on 23 March 1882.\n\nOn 18 June 1884, wreckage from \"Jeannette\" was found on an ice floe near Julianehåb, near the south-western corner of Greenland. This indicated that an ocean current flowed from east to west across the polar sea. It gave the Norwegian explorer Fridtjof Nansen the idea that a properly-constructed ship could enter the ice in the east, survive the pressure during the drift, and emerge in the Atlantic, perhaps having traversed the pole itself. This theory was the basis of Nansen's \"Fram\" expedition of 1893–1896.\n\nAlthough the open Polar Sea theory ended with \"Jeannette\"s voyage, the ship's meteorological and oceanographic records have provided 21st-century climatologists with valuable data relating to climate change and the shrinking of the polar icecap.\n\nIn February 2015 the Russian adventurer, traveler and media personality Andrey Khoroshev announced that in consultation with the Russian Geographical Society, he was developing plans to locate and raise the wreck of \"Jeannette\". Khoroshev told \"The Siberian Times\": \"This vessel lies at a depth of only , with the known location down to . So in modern day conditions, to find and raise it is not such a hard task.\" He imagined that the event would be a great boost for Russia's relations with the United States, \"which are not very good right now\".\n\n\n"}

Due to its high legibility to modern readers, it is still used for artistic flavor in a variety of functional applications such as headlines, signboards, and advertisements. This legibility stems from the highly rectilinear structure, a feature shared with modern regular script (kaishu). In structure and rectilinearity, it is generally similar to the modern script; however, in contrast with the tall to square modern script, it tends to be square to wide, and often has a pronounced, wavelike flaring of isolated major strokes, especially a dominant rightward or downward diagonal stroke. Some structures are also archaic.\n\nClerical script is popularly but mistakenly thought to have developed or been invented in the early Han dynasty from the small seal script. The process of change between small seal script and clerical script is referred to as the \"Libian\" (lit: Clerical Change) (隸變). There are also historical traditions dating to the Hàn dynasty which mistakenly attributed the creation of clerical script to the Qín dynasty and in particular to Chéng Miǎo, who was said to have invented it at the behest of Qin Shi Huang. Another traditional account is that it was invented by government scribes, in particular those involved in the justice and penal systems. \n\nHowever, from written materials unearthed by archaeologists, it is now known that \"all\" stages of Chinese writing underwent periods of natural evolution, and none of them were inventions by one person; this is true of clerical script as well. Furthermore, rather than being established by government scribes, it has been argued that clerical script was already in popular use, and the Qín dynasty use by scribes merely reflects this trend. \n\nArchaeological discoveries now clearly show that an immature form of clerical script (\"proto-clerical\") was already developing in the state of Qín during the Warring States period, and into the early Western Hàn; this can be seen on a number of bamboo books unearthed recently. Furthermore, the writing immediately preceding clerical script was not merely seal script alone; rather, there was a coexistence of seal script (the at-first dominant and formal style) alongside an increasingly popular but secondary form of \"vulgar\", \"popular\", or \"common\" writing, which was very roughly executed and which was generally rectilinear. The popularity of this vulgar writing grew as the use of writing itself became more widespread. The structures and style of many of the characters executed in this vulgar writing were similar or even identical to their later clerical script counterparts, leading some to conclude that proto-clerical (and therefore clerical) script evolved not from seal script but from the vulgar writing of Qín, which coexisted with seal script in Warring States to Qín dynasty. The Qín bamboo script is a good example of this transition, having evolved from vulgar Qín writing and considered by some to constitute Qín clerical script.\n\nThe etymology of the Chinese name for the clerical script \"lìshū\" () is uncertain. In the Qin period, \"lì\" meant \"state-owned slave, prisoner-in-servitude\", and thus, some infer that the script was used in recording the affairs related to such slaves, while others infer that it was used by prisoners conscripted as scribes. \"Li\" correspondingly meant \"low-ranking subordinate, servitor, subaltern; runner; lackey, servant; houseman; turnkey; laborer, esp. at corvée\". Clerical script is also known as \"clerical characters\" (\"lìzì\" 隸字), \"assistants' writing\" (\"zuǒshū\" 佐書), and \"historical writing\" (\"shǐshū\" 史書).\n\nDuring Warring States, proto-clerical script emerged in casual, informal usage. During the Qin dynasty it appears to have also been used in some scribal capacity, but never in formal usage. Maturing into clerical script in the early Han, it soon became the dominant script for general purposes, while seal script remained in use for the most formal purposes such as some stelae, signet seals (name chops), and especially the titles of written works and stelae; some cursive was also in use at the time. At roughly the same time, the clerical script was used and inscribed onto many stelae which later influenced subsequent development of Chinese calligraphic styles. Out of clerical script, a new form then emerged in the middle of the Eastern Han dynasty, which Qiu (2000, p. 113) terms \"neo-clerical\" script; it was from this neo-clerical and from cursive that by late in the Eastern Han semi-cursive would then evolve, out of which then emerged the modern standard script. Thus, according to Qiu, the evolution from clerical script to standard script was not a direct step as commonly supposed.\n\n"}

The eldest of three children, Air has a sister, Francesca, and brother, Alexander. Air grew up in Gosforth, Newcastle upon Tyne, where she attended St Oswald's Catholic Primary School and later Sacred Heart Convent School. Air was then educated at Gosforth High School, and also attended First Act Theatre, a local youth theatre group. Her fellow students at First Act Theatre included Jill Halfpenny and Anthony McPartlin. Air also modeled as a child, appearing in ads for Nissan, Asda and Lenor.\n\nFirst appearing as an extra on CBBC programme \"Byker Grove\" aged 10, Air was asked to audition for a role by a producer, and was subsequently cast as Charlie Charlton. In 1994, Air and her co-stars Jayni Hoy and Vicky Taylor formed Byker Groove!, releasing the single \"Love Your Sexy\", which charted at 48 on the UK Singles Chart. Air moved to London aged 15, subsequently becoming part of pop duo Crush with Jayni Hoy. Two of the band's singles released in 1996, \"Jellyhead\" and \"Luv'd Up\", charted in the UK at 50 and 45 respectively, while their debut studio album \"Teenage Kicks\" failed to chart. The band's management team booked Crush on a tour of the United States, Japan and South East Asia, commencing after Air completed her GCSEs, with \"Jellyhead\" subsequently peaking at 76 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nFollowing her promotional touring, she returned to the United Kingdom and in September 1997 signed to MTV UK to host the daily live show, \"MTV Select\", later becoming a presenter of several shows including \"The Big Breakfast\", Channel 4's flagship morning entertainment show. Air departed \"MTV Select\" in April 2000, citing her desire to return to acting and to devote more time to her role on \"The Big Breakfast\" as the reasons for her departure. In January 2001, Air was promoted to a main presenter on \"The Big Breakfast\" in a relaunch of the programme amid falling viewer figures. However, Air later resigned in May of that year, with Channel 4 axing \"The Big Breakfast\" shortly thereafter. Also in May, Air appeared in \"The Mummy Returns\", the sequel to \"The Mummy\" (1999), in a \"blink-and-you'll-miss-it cameo\" that BBC film critic Neil Smith described as one of the only points of difference between the sequel and the original film. \n\nShe has also appeared in many television dramas, most recently \"Hollyoaks\" and \"Hotel Babylon\", BBC TV comedy \"Operation Good Guys\", Catherine Cookson's six-parter \"A Dinner of Herbs\", and Lynda La Plante's \"Supply & Demand\".

Air presented on \"Five's\" early evening, magazine programme \"Live from Studio Five\", alongside regular presenter of the programme, Kate Walsh.\n\nIn January 2013, Air participated in the ITV programme, \"Splash!\" She replaced Jennifer Metcalfe at short notice. In November 2017, Air announced that she would be taking part in the tenth series of \"Dancing on Ice\". She was partnered with Mark Hanretty. They were eliminated in Week 7.\n\nIn 2019, Air was announced as having a starring role in the second series of the drama \"The Split\", which started airing on BBC One in February 2020.\n\nIn 2000, Air met businessman and animal conservationist Damian Aspinall, having been introduced by their mutual friend Tara Palmer-Tomkinson. The pair began a long-term relationship, with Air giving birth to their daughter, Freya Air Aspinall, in September 2003. Shortly after her birth the couple announced their intention to place their baby daughter in the care of a gorilla, a ritual in which Aspinall's older children had already taken part. Air and Aspinall separated amicably in 2007. In 2013, Air began dating James Middleton, the younger brother of Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge; the pair eventually separated in 2018.

His father may have been enslaved. The identity of both parents remains unknown. The ancestry of Samuel's family was that of Harriet \"Ritt\" Green. The mother Araminta \"Minty\" Ross-Tubman-Davis. Also known as Harriet Tubman. He labored for his enslaver, Henry Nichols, until Nichols's death in 1832. A provision in Nichols's will enabled Green to buy his freedom. Samuel then worked as a farmer and as a minister or exhorter in the African Methodist Episcopal Church in Dorchester County, Maryland. He was able to buy the freedom of his wife Catherine (Kitty) in 1842 from her enslaver, Ezekiel Richardson. Sam and Kitty's two children, Sam Jr. (born 1829) and Susan (born 1832), were subsequently sold by Richardson to Dr. James Muse in 1847, taking them out of Sam and Kitty's household.\n\nReverend Samuel Green's reputation grew in stature in both the African-American and white communities of Dorchester County. In 1852, he served as a delegate to the Convention of the Free Colored People of Maryland in Baltimore, where he resisted efforts to encourage emigration to Africa. In October 1855 he attended the National Convention of the Colored People of the United States, held at Franklin Hall in Philadelphia, as a delegate from Maryland. He mingled with many prominent Northern black abolitionists during the convention, including Frederick Douglass, Jacob Gibbs, Stephen Myers, William Cooper Nell, Charles Lennox Remond, John Rock, and Mary Ann Shadd Cary.\n\nIn August 1854, Sam Green's son, Sam Jr., a skilled blacksmith, ran away from Dr. Muse after learning that he might be sold. Using instructions probably given to him by Harriet Tubman, he found his way to the office of William Still, Philadelphia's most notorious Underground Railroad stationmaster, who forwarded him to the home of Charles Bustill, another prominent African American Underground Railroad agent in Philadelphia. From there, he was sent along swiftly to Chipaway, Ontario, Canada, just across the U.S. border near Niagara Falls, where he joined other Eastern Shore runaways living relatively free lives. Sam Green Sr. is known to have helped Harriet Tubman and other runaway slaves from the region, and no doubt these connections helped Sam Jr. successfully reach freedom.\n\nOnce settled in Chipaway, Sam, Jr. wrote to his parents, telling them news of his successful journey to freedom, which included \"plenty of friends, plenty to eat, and to drink.\" He told his father to tell Peter Jackson and Joe Bailey, both locally enslaved men, to come to Canada as soon as they could. Jackson soon fled North with Tubman and her brothers in December 1854; Bailey would wait another two years before the right time presented itself. Tragically, Sam Jr.'s sister Susan was unable to flee; as the mother of two young children, Susan may have been unwilling or unable to run away with her brother. Muse, angry over the escape of Sam Jr. and suspicious that Susan might run off as well, sold her to a Missouri family, cruelly separating her from her family forever.\n\nBy mid-March 1857, rumors were circulating that the Rev. Green had played a role in the escape of the Dover Eight, a group of eight runways who had successfully eluded capture in a dramatic flight from Dorchester County.\n\nWhen the Dorchester County sheriff searched Green's house, he found the letters from Samuel Jr. naming Jackson and Bailey, two slaves who had escaped to Canada with Harriet Tubman. Raising further suspicions, Green had recently returned from a trip to Canada to visit with his fugitive son. Authorities also discovered a Canadian map, various railroad schedules, and a copy of one volume of the two volumes set of Harriet Beecher Stowe's 1852 best seller, \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" in Green's home.\n\nGreen was arrested on and charged with \"knowingly having in his possession a certain abolition pamphlet called 'Uncle Tom's Cabin,' of an inflammatory character and calculated to create discontent amongst the colored population of this State\" and \"knowingly having in his possession certain abolition papers and pictorial representation of an inflammatory character calculated to create discontent amongst the colored population of this State.\"\n\nHe was acquitted on the second charge, but convicted on the first, and on 14 May 1857 he was sentenced to ten years imprisonment.\n\nThe case caused a great deal of concern, with abolitionists calling for Green to be released and slaveholders calling for him to remain in jail. John Dixon Long wrote in 1857:\n\nDorchester County is almost exclusively a Methodist County. If the members of the M. E. Church of Dorchester had been liberty-loving, slavery-hating Methodists, no judge or jury would have dared to consign their brother in Christ to ten years' incarceration in a State prison, separated from wife and children, for having a book in his possession which might have been found on the shelves of the very Judge that pronounced the sentence. To the best of my recollection, I never saw a jury at any County Court on the Eastern Shore of Maryland that was not partially composed of members of the M. E. Church. The Judge who pronounced the sentence was, when I was a boy, a member of the New-school Presbyterian Church in Snow Hill, Md.; and, I presume, he is still a member of that church. He ought to have resigned his seat rather than have pronounced such a sentence. The Methodists of Maryland could have poor Green pardoned in six months, should they desire it. May the prayers of all the good go up to the Throne of Grace for this oppressed brother! I blush for my native State when I think of her bloody code of laws--a code that would disgrace a savage tribe. I blush for the Methodists, the Presbyterians, the Episcopalians, and the Baptists of Maryland, who, united, could wipe off from the statute book the black laws that tarnish her fair fame. Maryland denies the humanity of one hundred thousand slaves, and oppresses seventy-five thousand free negroes. May the Omnipotent speed the hour when American slavery shall be blasted by the thunders of His power, amidst the shoutings and hallelujahs of a redeemed race!\n\nThe governor of Maryland, Thomas Holliday Hicks, sided with the slaveholders. Green, because he was literate, worked in the warden's office doing paperwork. The cost of the trial, however, forced Kitty and Sam to sell their property in Dorchester County. Kitty then moved to Baltimore to be closer to Sam, supporting herself by taking in laundry. Hicks's successor Augustus Bradford freed Green in 1862, on condition that he leave Maryland. Green and his wife toured Philadelphia, New York, and New England, before emigrating to Canada. Their daughter Susan remained in slavery in Missouri. \n\nSam and Kitty returned to Maryland after the American Civil War, settling in Dorchester County to resume their pre-trial lives. He was a very active member of the Delaware Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church, working on committees for education and religious instruction. He later became involved in the Centenary Biblical Institute in Baltimore, which trained young men for the ministry and in time became known as Morgan State University. He and Kitty moved to Baltimore around 1874, presumably to devote more time to the Institute. Sam Green died there on .\n\n\n\n"}

Like many fighting games of the time, its style is marked by extreme violence, with characters graphically slaying defeated opponents. Utilizing 3Dfx Voodoo chips for the hardware, the game received attention for its cutting edge graphics and turned Atari a profit in the arcades. Critical response to the gameplay was much less enthusiastic.\n\nIn the 12th century, a collection of nations called the Covenant of Seven send their best warriors to kill Asmodeus, a practitioner of the dark arts who wields the fabled Mace of Tanis. The Mace is imbued with necropotic energy, offering those who wield it a tantalizing promise of ever-lasting life and unbridled power. Leaders from the East sense that Asmodeus is plotting and send their own warriors to eliminate him before it is too late.\n\nThe game is similar to \"Bio F.R.E.A.K.S.\" and the \"Mortal Kombat\" series. Like in \"Mortal Kombat\", when a character wins both rounds, they can perform an execution move on the enemy.\n\nSimilar to its contemporary \"Dead or Alive\", in lieu of ring-outs \"Mace: The Dark Age\" has arenas which are surrounded by dangerous terrain, causing damage to any character who goes out of bounds. An evade button allows characters to step backward or forward into the 3D environments.\n\n\nSecret characters:\n\n\"Mace: The Dark Age\" took roughly two years to develop. The developers created 30 characters, then narrowed them down to a lineup of 11 through focus groups of teenagers. The latest motion capture technology was used during the game's development. A member of the Atari team who happened to be in the Society for Creative Anachronism did all the motion capture acting.\n\nThe game was originally released on the arcade machines using the 3Dfx Voodoo graphics card, the same technology powering \"\". The 3Dfx technology was cheaper to develop for than a proprietary system, and Atari used the savings to sell the game at a lower cost to arcade operators.\n\nBesides the Nintendo 64 port, a PlayStation version of the game was also planned but never released.\n\n\"Mace: The Dark Age\" was praised mainly because of its graphics. It was also noted for stage interactions with things such as water, and damaging areas such as lava. \"Next Generation\" reviewed the arcade version, stating that \"Detail and depth on the order of a \"Virtua Fighter\" take years of development and practice, and Atari Games has a good start. \"Mace\" is a beautifully designed game with attractive characters and bodes well for \"Mace II\".\" \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" later commented that \"If your local arcade had this machine in, then you probably took a close look at it at one point or another. ... It is clearly one of the most visually impressive fighting games around, boasting smooth animations and large, colorful characters.\"\n\nThe majority of reviewers credited \"Mace\" as the best N64 fighting game at the time of its release, while openly acknowledging that the pool of good fighting games available for the N64 at the time was quite shallow. For example, \"Next Generation\" stated that \"The best fighter to hit Nintendo 64, \"Mace: The Dark Age\", would still get pounded into the ground by any PlayStation or Saturn fighter game.\" However, Jeff Gerstmann of GameSpot considered it inferior to the earlier N64 fighter \"Dark Rift\", saying it \"looks fantastic but still plays poorly.\" This was a common lament, as critics widely agreed that the game's graphics are excellent but the gameplay is mediocre due to issues such as uninteresting moves and rough controls. Kelly Rickards of \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" elaborated, \"The combos, while cool to look at (like everything else in this game), don't flow smoothly and only seem to work when much flail action is being performed. The whole feel of the control interface seemed to be locked in a yesteryear-zone, back when the 3-D fighting game pioneers were still perfecting their art.\"\n\nCritics did praise the arena designs, particularly the interactive objects and danger zones, with \"GamePro\", one of the few to give \"Mace\" a wholly positive review, applauding the \"dynamic details that not only look great but add to the fun and playability of the game.\" Some also complimented the fatalities, while opinions on the soundtrack were wildly divergent. \"IGN\" and \"GamePro\" both remarked that it fit the mood of the game well, while \"Next Generation\" called it \"awful\" and Gerstmann said it was simply \"decent\". The quality of the conversion from arcade to N64 was considered good by most reviewers, though a number of them complained of bad frame rates. According to Matt Casamassina of IGN, \"Possibly because of the attention to detail, character animation is sometimes choppy and, because of that, gameplay suffers.\"\n\nIn 2011, \"Complex\" included it on the list of ten \"most blatant \"Mortal Kombat\" ripoffs\", adding, \"If anything, it was like a more brutal version of \"Soul Edge\".\"\n\nThe arcade release was a commercial success.\n\n"}

He was a switch hitter who threw right-handed. During his career, he played with the Colorado Rockies, Kansas City Royals, San Francisco Giants, Chicago Cubs, and Detroit Tigers.\n\nPérez was originally signed by the Colorado Rockies in 1992. Frequently praised for his defensive skills, Pérez reached the major leagues in 1996 and become the Rockies' shortstop for good in 1997. Over the next three years, he scarcely missed a game and won a Gold Glove in 2000. During 2001, he was traded to the Kansas City Royals, where he also played in 2002. The trade proved to be unpopular with both teams, and Pérez joined the San Francisco Giants for 2003 and 2004. He lost his starting job during the 2004 season and was released during that year. Pérez then signed with the Chicago Cubs, whom he finished the season with and spent most of the next two years with. He was the Cubs' starting shortstop in 2005 but was used as a reserve player in 2006 before getting traded to the Detroit Tigers during the year. He finished his career in 2007 with the Tigers. As a Tiger, he turned a double play which saved Justin Verlander's no-hitter, but he also had a series of positive tests for amphetamines which effectively ended his career.\n\nAs a child, Pérez played for Liga Mercedes in the Dominican Republic. The Colorado Rockies signed him as an undrafted free agent in 1992 at the age of 18. Assigned to the single-A Bend Rockies for the 1993 season, Pérez posted a .260 batting average and stole 19 bases. The Rockies, confident in Pérez's potential, promoted him to the single-A Central Valley Rockies. Pérez exhibited strong defensive skills, executing the first unassisted triple play in the history of the California League in a game against the Bakersfield Blaze. Pérez batted just .239 on the year but made the California League All-Star game and was considered to be one of the Rockies' top prospects on the basis of his defense. Rockies player development chief Dick Balderson expressed confidence that Pérez's hitting would improve: \"He's got all the skills...He's just in a rush right now, like most young guys.\"\n\nPérez moved up to the double-AA New Haven Ravens where he batted .253 and improved his fielding percentage to .967 and was considered the Rockies' top prospect at shortstop. The Rockies promoted Pérez to triple-A Colorado Springs Sky Sox at the end of the 1995 season with the intention of bringing him up to the major leagues the next year. In fact, although Pérez was invited to 1996 spring training, he spent most of year with the Sky Sox and was not called up until the end of August, making his major league debut on August 31. In his season with the Sky Sox, his batting average had improved to .316. Commented Rockies manager Don Baylor: \"He is the guy who had the year that traditionally earns a call up. I want to see what he can do.\" Pérez hit .156 over 17 games and returned to the Sky Sox for the beginning of the 1997 season.\n\nAlthough invited to 1997 spring training Pérez did not make the 25-man roster and once again returned to the Sky Sox for the first half of the season, where he batted .363 with a .975 fielding percentage. In mid-June the Rockies summoned him in place of Jason Bates, this time for good. Pérez batted .291 on the year and gradually replaced Walt Weiss as the starting shortstop. Pérez remained Colorado's primary shortstop for the next three seasons (1998–2000), appearing in all but five games. His batting average hovered around .280 (.274, .280, .287) and he averaged thirty doubles a year. His fielding percentage never dropped below .975 and he won a Gold Glove for the 2000 season. Despite his later reputation for anemic hitting, Pérez managed several offensive feats with the Rockies. On July 25, 1998, he hit for the cycle against the St. Louis Cardinals. In 1999 he tied Bobby Abreu and José Offerman for the most triples in Major League Baseball with 11. Pérez got off to a strong start in 2001 but there was doubt over his future with Colorado. The Rockies had offered him a 4-year, $17 million contract which he had rejected; accepting a 1-year $3.55 million deal via arbitration. In the end the Rockies dealt Pérez to the Kansas City Royals as part of a three-way deal in which the Royals sent Jermaine Dye to the Oakland Athletics who then sent Mario Encarnación, José Ortiz and Todd Belitz to Colorado. \"Denver Post\" sportswriter Woody Paige criticized the move, calling Pérez \"the best shortstop in the National League\" who was \"an extraordinary defensive player, a capable offensive player and a classy team player.\"\n\nPérez arrived in Kansas City amid widespread anger over the departure of fan-favorite Dye. Facing off against Dye in one of his first games as a Royal, Pérez took the low-key approach: \"I'm just going to play my game.\" Pérez finished out the 2001 season in Kansas City, batting .241 over 49 games. Pérez started at shortstop for the 2002 season but his batting average sank to .236, leading sportswriters to question whether the rarefied air at Coors Field had inflated Pérez's numbers. Pérez also may have sealed his fate by refusing to enter a late-season game at the request of manager Tony Peña. At the end of the year the Royals were looking to move Pérez and his $4.1 million salary; he was eventually claimed off waivers by the San Francisco Giants and signed a two-year, $4.25 million contract.\n\nAt the Giants Pérez hoped for a fresh start; rumors had swirled in Kansas City about problems in the clubhouse, and it was no secret that the trade had been deeply unpopular in both Denver and Kansas City. Commented Pérez: \"I feel happy here. I like the National League. I was happy in Colorado and I am happy here.\" Pérez hit .256 over the course of the 2003 season; an improvement on his previous season but a far cry from the Colorado days. Pérez returned for the 2004 season, but the situation in San Francisco had become uncomfortable. Although signed as a starter at second base, he quickly became backup to José Cruz, Jr., while he lost out at shortstop to Deivi Cruz. His batting average slumped to .232. He had a staunch defender in manager Felipe Alou, but in the end he was the \"odd man out\" and the Giants released him on August 14, 2004. Almost immediately the Chicago Cubs signed Pérez to a minor-league contract.\n\nThe Cubs assigned Pérez to the triple-A Iowa Cubs, but he played only ten games before being called up to the expanded roster on September 1. Pérez became a much needed spark plug in the lineup, going 6 for 6 in his first 6 at-bats as a Cub and providing a needed backup to the ailing Nomar Garciaparra. In 23 games with the Cubs he hit .371. The Cubs re-signed Pérez to a one-year contract worth $1 million, with up to an additional $1.5 million in bonuses.\n\nManager Dusty Baker made Pérez the everyday shortstop in 2005 to replace Garciaparra, mainly on the strength of his defensive skills. His impatience at the plate led to a walk percentage of 3.1%, the worst in the National League. Pérez finished the season batting .274, and his play at short won rave reviews from Baker: \"It's hard to play better shortstop defensively than Neifi has.\" In the off-season the Cubs signed Pérez to a two-year, $5 million contract.\n\nFor the 2006 season Pérez lost the starting job at shortstop to Ronny Cedeño, and found himself playing a mixture of second base and short behind Cedeno and Todd Walker. Meanwhile, Pérez's batting average sagged to .254, while his on-base percentage, never high, had fallen to .266. In late August the Cubs traded him to the Detroit Tigers for minor-league catcher Chris Robinson. The Tigers were seeking a replacement for their injured second baseman, Plácido Polanco, who had separated his shoulder.\n\nPérez arrived in Detroit during the pennant chase which ended with their loss in the 2006 World Series to the St. Louis Cardinals. Pérez faced almost immediate criticism from fans after getting off to a .157 start, and manager Jim Leyland felt obliged to come to his defense: \"These guys making a big deal about Neifi Pérez and Omar Infante don't know what they're talking about. They got no clue.\" Pérez made 21 appearances during the regular season, with a batting average of .200 and an OBP of .235. He appeared in three games during the playoffs but never reached base.\n\nThe Tigers retained Pérez for the 2007 season, although Leyland acknowledged that Pérez would have to improve his play: \"I recommended that we trade for him. I take responsibility. I don't want people to get the wrong impression. I like Neifi Pérez, but he did not perform well. It's that simple.\" Pérez, however, continued to struggle, posting a .172 batting average over the 33 games he played in a Tigers' uniform. One bright spot came on June 12, 2007, when he saved Justin Verlander's no-hitter against the Milwaukee Brewers by turning a possible base hit into an inning-ending double play.\n\nOn July 6, 2007, Pérez was suspended 25 games by MLB for a second positive test for amphetamines; on August 3 he was suspended an additional 80 games for a third positive test. On October 31, 2007, Pérez filed for free agency, ending his association with Detroit.\n\nIn February 2008 there was talk of the Colorado Rockies signing Pérez to a minor league contract worth $750,000, which manager Clint Hurdle characterized as a \"lifeline.\" In the end Colorado backed out, citing younger players competing for the same position.\n\nPérez has also had a significant foreign career. He participated in the Caribbean Series and was named the Series MVP in 1998 and 1999. In 2012, he was inducted into the Caribbean Baseball Hall of Fame. He played in the Dominican Professional Baseball League for Leones del Escogido with personal success, batting over .300. In 2004, he helped Escogido score 18 runs in an inning. In 2006, he played in the Dominican Republic-Puerto Rico All-Star Game.\n\nPérez's poor offense after Colorado traded him to the Royals overshadowed his defensive skills. He was widely criticized because of his low on-base percentage (career .297) and lack of power. Nate Silver, a baseball statistician who analyzed Pérez's statistics (specifically value over replacement player (VORP)), concluded that Pérez had a negative impact on the teams he played for. Chicago sportswriter Bruce Miles called Pérez \"one of the worst offensive players in baseball history.\"\n"}

She is the Patron Saint of Catalonia, an honour she shares with Saint George (\"Sant Jordi\" in Catalan). The famed image once bore the inscription \"\"Nigra Sum Sed Formosa\"\" (Latin: I am Black, but Beautiful). \nPope Leo XIII granted the image a Canonical coronation on 11 September 1881. The image is one of the Black Madonnas of Europe, hence its familiar Catalan name, \"La Moreneta\" (\"the little dark-skinned one\" or \"the little dark one\"). Believed by some to have been carved in Jerusalem in the early days of the Church, it is more likely a Romanesque sculpture in wood from the late 12th century.\n\nAn 18th century polychromed statue of the same image is also displayed in Saint Peter's basilica, previously stored in the Vatican Museums which was gifted by the President of Brazil, Joao Goulart on the Papal election of Pope Paul VI in 1963. The image has been on display for Papal masses since the Pontificate of Pope Benedict XVI.\n\nThe mountain of Montserrat has been of religious significance since pre-Christian times, when the Romans built a temple to honor the Roman goddess Venus.\n\nBy one account, the image of the Madonna was moved to Montserrat in 718, to avoid the danger posed by invading Saracens.\n\nLegend has it that the Benedictine monks could not move the statue to construct their monastery, choosing to instead build around it. The statue's sanctuary is located at the rear of the chapel, where an altar of gold surrounds the icon, and is now a site of pilgrimage.\n\nThe 95-cm (38-inch) statue shows evidence of Byzantine conventional and stylized form, and is painted in polychrome. The reliquary statue of Sainte-Foy in Conques (southern France) may have been a model. The art historical designation for this type of pose is called \"Throne of Wisdom\". The body is thin, the face elongated. She holds an orb of the earth in her right hand. The Child's hand is raised in a formalized and traditional Eastern blessing.\n\nIn 2001 renovators working for the government observed that the black hands and face of La Moreneta had over the centuries undergone a change in colour. They attribute the change—from a lighter tone to black—either to prolonged exposure to candle smoke or a chemical reaction caused by a varnish used as a paint sealant. The statue was repainted black by successive generations of restorers. A series of tests, including X-rays, revealed the statue's original colour and also showed that the last repainting took place at the turn of the 18th century.\n\nAfter making a pilgrimage to Our Lady of Montserrat around 1203, Peter Nolasco went to Barcelona where he began to practice various works of charity. Nolasco became concerned with the plight of Christians captured in Moorish raids and that he decided to establish a religious order to succor these unfortunates.\n\nUpon his recovery from battle wounds, Ignatius of Loyola visited the Benedictine monastery of Montserrat (on 25 March 1522), where he laid down his military accouterments before the image. He then led a period of asceticism before later founding the Society of Jesus.\n\nThe hymn to the Virgin of Montserrat, known as \"el Virolai\" and sung at noon each day by the Escolania de Montserrat boys' choir, begins with the words: \"\"Rosa d’abril, Morena de la serra...\"\" (Rose of April, dark-skinned lady of the mountain...). Therefore, this virgin is sometimes also known as the \"Rosa d'abril\". Her feast is kept on April 27.\n\nThe statue has always been considered one of the most celebrated images in Spain. \"La Moreneta\" is one of Catalonia's two patron saints, together with Sant Jordi (Saint George).\n\nThe name Montserrat, traditionally abbreviated to \"Serrat\", \"Rat\", \"Rateta\", \"Tat\" or \"Tóna\", and also to \"Montse\" in recent years, is a popular girl's name in Catalonia.\n\n"}

Though not in the core of the area, it is considered by many to constitute a part of Wales' celebrated Waterfall Country.\n\nThe falls occur where the small river, the Nant Llech () drops over the faulted edge of a hard sandstone known as the Farewell Rock which forms the top half of the rock face and which forms the base of the South Wales Coal Measures. Beneath this, and forming much of the recessed portion of the drop, is the Subcrenatum Sandstone separated from the Farewell Rock above by the \"Subcrenatum\" marine band. Both the marine band and sandstone are part of the Bishopston Mudstone Formation included within the Marros Group, the modern name in South Wales for the assemblage of strata that was traditionally known as the Millstone Grit series. A stream gully between the descent path and the falls marks the line of the Henrhyd Fault which is responsible for the falls' presence. \n\nThe waterfall is reached after a steep walk down into the valley from the car park established by the National Trust, and is a popular spot to visit. A further footpath leads steeply down to the falls on the opposite side of the valley from Heol Henrhyd, the road through Coelbren village. One of the area's most famous visitors was Sir William Edmond Logan (later head of the Geological Survey of Canada), who carried out detailed geological survey work in the area, discovering some 1.5km down the valley from the foot of the falls the fossil trees which now stand outside Swansea Museum.\n\nThe final scene of \"The Dark Knight Rises\" was filmed at the waterfall, where it doubled as the entrance for the Batcave.\n\n"}

Importantly, the world line of a particle free from all external, non-gravitational forces is a particular type of geodesic. In other words, a freely moving or falling particle always moves along a geodesic.\n\nIn general relativity, gravity can be regarded as not a force but a consequence of a curved spacetime geometry where the source of curvature is the stress–energy tensor (representing matter, for instance). Thus, for example, the path of a planet orbiting a star is the projection of a geodesic of the curved four-dimensional (4-D) spacetime geometry around the star onto three-dimensional (3-D) space.\n\nThe full geodesic equation is\nwhere \"s\" is a scalar parameter of motion (e.g. the proper time), and formula_2 are Christoffel symbols (sometimes called the affine connection coefficients or Levi-Civita connection coefficients) symmetric in the two lower indices. Greek indices may take the values: 0, 1, 2, 3 and the summation convention is used for repeated indices formula_3 and formula_4. The quantity on the left-hand-side of this equation is the acceleration of a particle, so this equation is analogous to Newton's laws of motion, which likewise provide formulae for the acceleration of a particle. This equation of motion employs the Einstein notation, meaning that repeated indices are summed (i.e. from zero to three). The Christoffel symbols are functions of the four space-time coordinates and so are independent of the velocity or acceleration or other characteristics of a test particle whose motion is described by the geodesic equation.\n\nSo far the geodesic equation of motion has been written in terms of a scalar parameter \"s\". It can alternatively be written in terms of the time coordinate, formula_5 (here we have used the triple bar to signify a definition). The geodesic equation of motion then becomes:\n\nThis formulation of the geodesic equation of motion can be useful for computer calculations and to compare General Relativity with Newtonian Gravity. It is straightforward to derive this form of the geodesic equation of motion from the form which uses proper time as a parameter using the chain rule. Notice that both sides of this last equation vanish when the mu index is set to zero. If the particle's velocity is small enough, then the geodesic equation reduces to this:\n\nHere the Latin index \"n\" takes the values [1,2,3]. This equation simply means that all test particles at a particular place and time will have the same acceleration, which is a well-known feature of Newtonian gravity. For example, everything floating around in the international space station will undergo roughly the same acceleration due to gravity.\n\nPhysicist Steven Weinberg has presented a derivation of the geodesic equation of motion directly from the equivalence principle. The first step in such a derivation is to suppose that a free falling particle does not accelerate in the neighborhood of a point-event with respect to a freely falling coordinate system (formula_8). Setting formula_9, we have the following equation that is locally applicable in free fall:\nThe next step is to employ the multi-dimensional chain rule. We have:\n\nDifferentiating once more with respect to the time, we have:\n\nTherefore:\n\nMultiply both sides of this last equation by the following quantity:\n\nConsequently, we have this:\n\nUsing (from Christoffel symbols#Change of variable and the fact that the Christoffel symbols vanish in an inertial frame of reference)\n\nit becomes\n\nApplying the one-dimensional chain rule gives\n\nAs before, we can set formula_5. Then the first derivative of \"x\" with respect to \"t\" is one and the second derivative is zero. Replacing \"λ\" with zero gives:\n\nSubtracting d \"x\" / d \"t\" times this from the previous equation gives:\n\nwhich is a form of the geodesic equation of motion (using the coordinate time as parameter).\n\nThe geodesic equation of motion can alternatively be derived using the concept of parallel transport.\n\nWe can (and this is the most common technique) derive the geodesic equation via the action principle. Consider the case of trying to find a geodesic between two timelike-separated events.\n\nLet the action be \n\nwhere formula_24 is the line element. There is a negative sign inside the square root because the curve must be timelike. To get the geodesic equation we must vary this action. To do this let us parameterize this action with respect to a parameter formula_25. Doing this we get:\n\nWe can now go ahead and vary this action with respect to the curve formula_27. By the principle of least action we get:\n\nUsing the product rule we get:\n\nIntegrating by-parts the last term and dropping the total derivative (which equals to zero at the boundaries) we get that:\n\nSimplifying a bit we see that:\n\nso,\n\nmultiplying this equation by formula_33 we get:\n\nSo by Hamilton's principle we find that the Euler–Lagrange equation is\n\nMultiplying by the inverse metric tensor formula_36 we get that\n\nThus we get the geodesic equation:\n\nwith the Christoffel symbol defined in terms of the metric tensor as\n\nAlbert Einstein believed that the geodesic equation of motion can be derived from the field equations for empty space, i.e. from the fact that the Ricci curvature vanishes. He wrote:\nIt has been shown that this law of motion — generalized to the case of arbitrarily large gravitating masses — can be derived from the field equations of empty space alone. According to this derivation the law of motion is implied by the condition that the field be singular nowhere outside its generating mass points.\nand \nOne of the imperfections of the original relativistic theory of gravitation was that as a field theory it was not complete; it introduced the independent postulate that the law of motion of a particle is given by the equation of the geodesic. \nA complete field theory knows only fields and not the concepts of particle and motion. For these must not exist independently from the field but are to be treated as part of it.\nBoth physicists and philosophers have often repeated the assertion that the geodesic equation can be obtained from the field equations to describe the motion of a gravitational singularity, but this claim remains disputed. Less controversial is the notion that the field equations determine the motion of a fluid or dust, as distinguished from the motion of a point-singularity.\n\nIn deriving the geodesic equation from the equivalence principle, it was assumed that particles in a local inertial coordinate system are not accelerating. However, in real life, the particles may be charged, and therefore may be accelerating locally in accordance with the Lorentz force. That is:\n\nwith\n\nThe Minkowski tensor formula_42 is given by:\n\nThese last three equations can be used as the starting point for the derivation of an equation of motion in General Relativity, instead of assuming that acceleration is zero in free fall. Because the Minkowski tensor is involved here, it becomes necessary to introduce something called the \"metric tensor\" in General Relativity. The metric tensor \"g\" is symmetric, and locally reduces to the Minkowski tensor in free fall. The resulting equation of motion is as follows:\n\nwith\n\nThis last equation signifies that the particle is moving along a timelike geodesic; massless particles like the photon instead follow null geodesics (replace −1 with zero on the right-hand side of the last equation). It is important that the last two equations are consistent with each other, when the latter is differentiated with respect to proper time, and the following formula for the Christoffel symbols ensures that consistency:\n\nThis last equation does not involve the electromagnetic fields, and it is applicable even in the limit as the electromagnetic fields vanish. The letter \"g\" with superscripts refers to the inverse of the metric tensor. In General Relativity, indices of tensors are lowered and raised by contraction with the metric tensor or its inverse, respectively.\n\nA geodesic between two events can also be described as the curve joining those two events which has a stationary interval (4-dimensional \"length\"). \"Stationary\" here is used in the sense in which that term is used in the calculus of variations, namely, that the interval along the curve varies minimally among curves that are nearby to the geodesic.\n\nIn Minkowski space there is only one time-like geodesic that connects any given pair of time-like separated events, and that geodesic is the curve with the longest proper time between the two events. But in curved spacetime, it is possible for a pair of widely separated events to have more than one time-like geodesic that connects them. In such instances, the proper times along the various geodesics will not in general be the same. And for some geodesics in such instances, it is possible for a curve that connects the two events and is nearby to the geodesic to have either a longer or a shorter proper time than the geodesic.\n\nFor a space-like geodesic through two events, there are always nearby curves which go through the two events that have either a longer or a shorter proper length than the geodesic, even in Minkowski space. In Minkowski space, in an inertial frame of reference in which the two events are simultaneous, the geodesic will be the straight line between the two events at the time at which the events occur. Any curve that differs from the geodesic purely spatially (\"i.e.\" does not change the time coordinate) in that frame of reference will have a longer proper length than the geodesic, but a curve that differs from the geodesic purely temporally (\"i.e.\" does not change the space coordinate) in that frame of reference will have a shorter proper length.\n\nThe interval of a curve in spacetime is\nThen, the Euler–Lagrange equation,\nbecomes, after some calculation, \nwhere formula_50\n\nThe goal being to find a curve for which the value of\nis stationary, where\nsuch goal can be accomplished by calculating the Euler–Lagrange equation for \"f\", which is \n\nSubstituting the expression of \"f\" into the Euler–Lagrange equation (which makes the value of the integral \"l\" stationary), gives\n\nNow calculate the derivatives:\nformula_55\n\nformula_56\n\nformula_57\n\nformula_58\n\nformula_59\n\nformula_60\n\nformula_62\n\nformula_63\n\nThis is just one step away from the geodesic equation.\n\nIf the parameter \"s\" is chosen to be affine, then the right side of the above equation vanishes (because formula_64 is constant).

The chapel was enlarged in 1406. \nThe present church in traditional Tuscan style celebrating the dogma of the Immaculate Conception was built in 1855‑1878 by architect Emilio de Fabris, better known for the sensitive Gothic façade he provided for the Duomo of Florence.

The protagonist survives by his wits and the qualities of his cultural upbringing, which also enable him to prevail in conflicts with fellow castaways or over local peoples he may encounter. However, he manages to wrest survival and even a certain amount of civilisation from the wilderness. Works that followed went both in the more utopian direction (\"Swiss Family Robinson\") and the dystopian direction (\"Lord of the Flies\").\n\nThe term \"inverted Crusoeism\" is coined by J. G. Ballard. The paradigm of Robinson Crusoe has been a recurring topic in Ballard’s work. Whereas the original Robinson Crusoe became a castaway against his own will, Ballard's protagonists often choose to maroon themselves; hence \"inverted Crusoeism\" (e.g., Concrete Island). The concept provides a reason as to why people would deliberately maroon themselves on a remote island; in Ballard’s work, becoming a castaway is as much a healing and empowering process as an entrapping one, enabling people to discover a more meaningful and vital existence.\n\nOne of the best known robinsonades is \"The Swiss Family Robinson\" (1812–27) by Johann Rudolf Wyss, in which a shipwrecked clergyman, his wife, and his four sons manage not only to survive on their island but also to discover the good life. Jules Verne strands his castaways in \"Mysterious Island\" (1874) with only one match, one grain of wheat, a metal dog collar, and two watches.\n\nThe robinsonade proper also contains the following themes:\n\nThe robinsonade genre also includes many space-travel science fiction works. The basic premise is that our astronauts arrive at new worlds, terraform them if necessary, then live and prosper there, building a civilization where none existed before. The vastness of interstellar space, and the constraints of relativistic physics, may keep them isolated for thousands of years from other human or non-human (possibly robotic) settlements scattered across the galaxy, hidden amongst hundreds of billions of other stars and planets; and in their new life, they may meet aliens, just as Robinson Crusoe met Man Friday.\n\nGenre SF robinsonades naturally tend to be set on uninhabited planets or satellites rather than islands. The Moon is the location of Ralph Morris's proto-SF \"The Life and Wonderful Adventures of John Daniel\" (1751), and of John W Campbell Jr's paean to human inventiveness, \"The Moon is Hell\" (1950). A classic example of an SF robinsonade which has all the elements of the robinsonade proper is Tom Godwin's \"The Survivors\", as well as J. G. Ballard's \"Concrete Island\". A more recent example is Andy Weir's 2011 \"The Martian\". Joanna Russ' \"We Who Are About To... (1977) is a radical feminist objection to the entire genre.\n\n\"Sears List of Subject Headings\" recommends that librarians also catalog apocalyptic fantasies—such as Cormac McCarthy's popular novel \"The Road\", or even Robert A. Heinlein's \"Starship Troopers\"—as robinsonades.\n\n\"Robinson Crusoe on Mars\" is the story of the survivor of a space ship crash on the planet Mars.\n\n\"Lt. Robin Crusoe, U.S.N.\" is a 1966 comedic retelling, featuring a US Navy pilot and an astrochimp named Floyd.\n\n\"Enemy Mine\" is the SF story of a human and enemy alien who crash land on a barren planetoid and eventually cooperate to survive.\n\n\"The Martian\" is the story of a human astronaut stranded on Mars after a storm forces the rest of the crew to depart and the effort to recover him.\n\n\"Cast Away\" is the story of a FedEx employee (Tom Hanks) who is the sole survivor of a plane crash and is stranded on a deserted island for four years.\n\nIn 1940 Mort Weisinger created Green Arrow, a millionaire castaway turned to vigilante.\n\nYears later, Gold Key Comics, produced a comic series, titled \"Space Family Robinson\", in the early 1960s and later producer Irwin Allen, created his own version of a similar concept, about another Space Family Robinson, known as \"Lost in Space\", for CBS.\n\nThe first appearance of a space-faring Robinson family (unrelated to the series' Robinsons) was in a comic book published by Gold Key Comics, \"The Space Family Robinson\", December 1962. Space Family Robinson was published as a total of 59 issues, from 1962 to 1982. The first issue was published in December 1962. With issue #15 (January, 1966), the \"Lost in Space\" title was added to the cover.\n\nThe book \"Silver Age: The Second Generation of Comic Artists\" by Daniel Herman explains that when the \"Lost in Space\" TV series came out in 1965, it was obvious that it was inspired, at least in part, by the comic book, but CBS, the network airing the show, had never acquired the license from Western Publishing. Rather than sue CBS or Irwin Allen, Western decided to reach a settlement which allowed them to use \"Lost in Space\" for the title of the comic book. Since CBS and Irwin Allen licensed shows to Western, Western didn't want to antagonize them. Also, the TV show title probably helped sales of the comic book.\n\nThe \"Lost in Space\" TV series is an adaptation of the novel \"The Swiss Family Robinson\". The astronaut family of Dr. John Robinson, accompanied by an Air Force pilot and a robot, set out from an overpopulated Earth in the spaceship \"Jupiter 2\" to visit a planet circling the star Alpha Centauri with hopes of colonizing it. Their mission in 1997 (the official launch date of the \"Jupiter 2\" was October 16, 1997) is immediately sabotaged by Dr. Zachary Smith, who slips aboard their spaceship and reprograms the robot to destroy the ship and crew.\n\nSmith is trapped aboard, and saves himself by prematurely reviving the crew from suspended animation. They save the ship, but consequent damage leaves them lost in space. Eventually they crash on an alien world, later identified as Priplanis, where they must survive a host of adventures. Smith (whom the show's writer originally intended to kill off) remains through the series as a source of comedic cowardice and villainy, exploiting the forgiving (or forgetful) nature of the Robinsons.\n\nSeveral videogames have explored this theme, placing players in hostile environments where they must work towards a specific goal or merely survive. As such, robinsonade video games can be included in the broader survival game genre. A few examples of this genre are the games in the \"Stranded\" series, \"Stranded Deep,\" \"The Forest\" and more recently Minecraft.\n\nOrdered by date of publication\n\n\n\n\n"}

The manuscript score and libretto, which describes the work as a \"favola dramatica musicale\", are held at the Biblioteca Marciana in Venice. The opera has set numbers with recitative, and is set in Fez in the ancient Kingdom of Mauretania. \n\n\"Ormindo\" was first performed in 1644 at the Teatro San Cassiano, Venice, the world's first public opera house. After its 1644 run, it was probably not revived until 1967 when it was performed at Glyndebourne Festival Opera.\nThe version presented at Glyndebourne was arranged and conducted by Raymond Leppard. The work received its American premiere in 1968 in a performance at the Juilliard School supervised by Leppard. Subsequently it was performed by the Washington Opera Society, using Juilliard's sets and Costumes. Singers were as follows: Amida -John Reardon; Erice - Michael Best; Ormindo - Frank Poretta; Sicle -Evelyn Mandac; Erisbe- Benita Valente. \n\nAlthough taken up by the State Opera of South Australia and staged in 1980, the opera remains something of a rarity. A recent performance was by the Pittsburgh Opera in February, 2007, using a new performing edition by Peter Foster. It was conducted by Bernard McDonald and directed by Chas Rader-Shieber. Peter Foster's edition was also used by The Harvard Early Music Society in its November, 2008 performance of the work, conducted by Matthew Hall and directed by Roy Kimmey. The Baylor University School of Music performed the work in English on November 21-22, 2008 under the direction of Dr. Michael Johnson with conductor Dr. Andrew Hudson. It was performed by Pinchgut Opera of Sydney in December 2009. The Royal Opera staged a new production, in an English translation, directed by Kasper Holten at Shakespeare's Globe in March 2014 - the first opera production at the newly opened Sam Wanamaker Playhouse. This production was revived the following year (in February 2015) at the same venue. The Royal Irish Academy of Music based in Dublin presented the first Irish production of the opera in January 2015 directed by Ben Barnes and conducted by David Adams.\n\nThe foreign princes, Amida and Ormindo, who are assisting in the defense of Mauretania, are both in love with Erisbe who is unhappily married to Hariadeno, Mauretania's elderly king. The princes agree to remain friends while they test her love. During the course of the opera, there is much plotting by Amore, Princess Sicle (Amida's abandoned lover) and Erice (Sicle's nurse) to interfere with the contest. Erice stages a séance to communicate with the 'dead' Sicle who reproaches Amida for his inconstancy which had driven her to suicide. Amida, overcome with remorse, realizes that he still loves Princess Sicle and is overjoyed when it is revealed that she is actually alive and not a ghost. Meanwhile, Erisbe and Ormindo decide to elope to Tunis, where Ormindo must defend his homeland from attack. When King Hariadeno discovers their adultery, he orders his captain, Osmano, to have them poisoned. However, Osmano substitutes a sleeping potion for the poison at the urging of Mirinda (Erisbe's confidante) who has promised to marry him if he spares the lovers. All ends more or less happily when the King learns that Ormindo is actually his son from a youthful liaison. He forgives everyone and cedes his kingdom to Ormindo.\n\nComplete\nExcerpts\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2037674", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2037674", "title": "Byrd Machine", "text": "Byrd Machine\n\nThe Byrd Organization or Byrd Machine was a political machine led by former Governor and U.S. Senator Harry F. Byrd, Sr. (1887–1966) that dominated Virginia politics for much of the 20th century. From the 1890s until the late 1960s, the Byrd Organization effectively controlled the politics of the state through a network of courthouse cliques of local constitutional officers in most of the state's counties.. \n\n\"The Organization\" had its greatest strength in rural areas. It was never able to gain a significant foothold in the growing urban areas of Virginia's many independent cities, which are not located within counties, nor with the emerging suburban middle-class of Virginians after World War II. Byrd's vehement opposition to racial integration of the state's public schools, including a policy of massive resistance, which ultimately failed in 1960 after it was ruled unconstitutional by both state and federal courts, could be described as the Organization's \"last stand\", although the remnants of it continued to wield power for a few years longer.\n\nWhen the Senator resigned in 1965, he was replaced in the Senate by his son Harry F. Byrd Jr.. However, the heyday of the Byrd Organization was clearly in the past. With the election of a Republican governor in 1969 for the first time in the 20th century, the 80 years of domination of Virginia politics by conservative Democrats ended.\n\nAfter the American Civil War, Virginia's politics were chaotic. Initially, former Confederates were not allowed to vote, and factions of newly enfranchised black voters joined the electorate. In the late 1870s, a coalition of blacks, Republicans, and populist Democrats formed the Readjuster Party. Readjusters aspired \"to break the power of wealth and established privilege\" of the planter class elites who had controlled Virginia politics since the colonial era and to promote public education. It was led by Harrison H. Riddleberger (1844–1890) of Woodstock, an attorney, and William Mahone (1827–1895), of Petersburg, a former Confederate general who was president of several railroads.\n\nThe Readjuster Party's power was overturned in the late 1880s, when John S. Barbour Jr. (1820–1892) led the first Conservative Democrat political machine in Virginia, known as the \"Martin Organization\", aided by a poll tax enacted in 1902 that effectively disenfranchised blacks and poor whites. U.S. Senator Thomas Staples Martin (1847–1919) took over after Barbour died, but Senator Martin's political control was thin by the time he died in office in 1919. By this time, a young state senator from Winchester, Harry F. Byrd, was a rising star in state politics and the Democratic Party. He had served the Wilson Administration during World War I helping with gasoline rationing as a volunteer.\n\nIn 1922, with seven years of experience in the Virginia State Senate, Byrd gained statewide prominence by confronting Virginia's powerful lobby of highway builders. Byrd had gained a lot of related experience when earlier managing the Valley Turnpike. In the Virginia General Assembly, he led a fight against using bonded indebtedness as a method to pay for new roads. He feared the state would sacrifice future flexibility by committing too many resources to paying off construction debt.\n\nIn 1923, Byrd was sued for libel by the Virginia Highway Contractors Association because he said their activities \"by combination and agreements may be very detrimental\" to the State. The court dismissed the suit, stating the criticism was legal, imposing all costs upon the association. The publicity figuratively paved the way for the election of Harry Byrd to statewide office.\n\nThe Virginia Democratic Machine, since the 1890s, had rigidly stood for white supremacy, a restricted suffrage, balanced budgets, and regressive taxation. After the Constitution of 1902 effectively disenfranchised more than half the electorate, the Organization had had little trouble winning most Virginia elections.\n\nHarry Byrd's uncle, U.S. Congressman Hal Flood, was one of the Organization leaders until his death in 1921, and Byrd's father Richard Evelyn Byrd Sr. had been speaker of the House of Delegates. But Byrd's own cleverness won him the governorship in 1925 at age 38. With intelligence and attention to detail, he soon gained control of the already thirty-year-old Organization. He served until 1930, then was elected to the United States Senate in 1933, serving until his retirement in 1965.\n\nOver forty years, Byrd built up relationships with the \"courthouse cliques,\" consisting of the constitutional officers in every county. The five (elected) constitutional officers in each county were the sheriff, Commonwealth's attorney, clerk of the court, county treasurer, and commissioner of revenue.\n\nPerhaps contrary to first appearances, the low public profile \"clerk of the court\" position held the greatest power in most counties within the Byrd Organization. These courthouse cliques made recommendations for suitable candidates, and Byrd only decided on candidates after careful consultation. Without Byrd's \"nod,\" no candidate had a chance at statewide office in Virginia.\n\nOne of Byrd's first acts upon taking office was to amend the state constitution to reduce the number of statewide elected offices to just three: governor, lieutenant governor and attorney general. Another amendment required the legislature to reapportion itself every decade – a demand made without any details of apportionment. This move not only centralized power in the governor's hands but also eliminated potential bases for opposition. Several measures that had been in place well before Byrd's time also ensured his dominance, especially the poll tax. This not only effectively stripped blacks and poor whites of the vote, but made the electorate the smallest relative to population in the postbellum United States. The courthouse cliques of the Byrd machine strove to ensure that \"reliable\" voters' poll taxes were paid on time, often as early as three years before an election. The General Assembly, through circuit court judges, controlled the electoral commissions that ruled on voter eligibility. While the Organization never was able to establish a foothold in urban areas, blatant and deliberate malapportionment in favor of rural Southside Virginia and against the strongly Republican southwestern mountains as well as the cities ensured statewide dominance.\n\nByrd made property taxes solely a county and city responsibility. He also had a keen interest in improving roads, dramatically increasing funding for secondary roads. When that was not enough, he pushed through the Byrd Road Act of 1932, a law that created the state's Virginia Secondary Roads System and gave the state responsibility for maintaining county roads, (albeit without similar assistance for Virginia's independent cities). These measures made Byrd seem like a New South progressive at first glance.\n\nHowever, Byrd's fiscal policy was principled conservatism, restructuring state government to streamline operations and use tax dollars more effectively. Byrd's primary support was among rural voters in his native Shenandoah Valley, as well as Southside. Voters in these areas had less interest in improved state services (other than roads) than in low taxes and limited government. Byrd initiated a \"pay as you go\" approach to spending, in which no state money was spent until enough taxes and fees were available. While this freed Virginia from having to pay off-road construction debt and kept the state as one of the few to remain solvent during the early years of the Great Depression, it also kept support for higher education and other state services at low levels.\n\nByrd, like many Americans who grew up before the high school movement, never graduated from high school. He recognized that his rural constituency where most students left school after eighth grade to go to work on the family farm were less interested in state-supplied services like public education than in lower taxes. Rural areas were heavily over-represented in the General Assembly, ensuring that Virginia's per capita expenditures on education and social welfare remained among the lowest in the nation for decades.\n\nGeorge Mason University professor William Grymes has noted that \"Byrd's political power was based on the ability of the appointed and elected officials to restrict the number of voters, and ensure those few voters were supporters of the Byrd Organization.\" The courthouse cliques' measures to restrict the number of voters made it possible for Byrd-supported candidates to win with as little as fifteen percent of the potential electorate actually being able to vote.\n\nWith this structure in place, Byrd's Organization practically selected every governor from 1930 until 1970, even as Virginia became friendlier to Republicans. Many Virginia Democrats began drifting away from the national party due to Franklin D. Roosevelt's support for organized labor during the New Deal. This only accelerated during the Civil Rights Movement, when Byrd drafted the Southern Manifesto in opposition to the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in \"Brown v. Board of Education.\" Consequently, many Byrd Democrats began splitting their tickets in national elections as early as the 1930s, well before ticket-splitting became a trend across the South in the 1960s.\n\nThis trend was especially pronounced in western Virginia, Byrd's home region. Several counties in that region have not supported a Democrat for president since Roosevelt. For instance, Highland and Shenandoah Counties last supported a Democrat for President in 1932, Page County last supported a Democrat in 1936, while Augusta and Roanoke Counties both last supported a Democrat in the 1944 election.\n\nByrd came to lead the \"conservative coalition\" in the United States Senate, and opposed President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, largely blocking most liberal legislation after 1937. Byrd was vehemently opposed to racial desegregation even early in the New Deal, and later opposed Presidents Harry S. Truman and John F. Kennedy despite their also being Democrats (as well as losing Democratic Presidential candidate Adlai Stevenson) because they opposed racial segregation within the U.S. military and federal workforce. This was a major reason why Virginia voted Republican in all but one presidential election from 1952 to 2004—the one exception being 1964 when a small group of Democratic leaders including Governor J. Lindsay Almond, state party chair Sidney Kellam, and gubernatorial candidate Mills Godwin broke with Byrd to support Lyndon Johnson. Meanwhile, conservative Democrats controlled the General Assembly until the mid 1990s.\n\nSome Byrd Democrats, such as Governors John S. Battle and Thomas B. Stanley, were sober enough to realize that segregation could not continue forever, and were willing to take cautious steps toward racial integration. However, their efforts were short-circuited in 1954, when a little over a month after the \"Brown v. Board of Education\" decision by the U.S. Supreme Court, Byrd vowed to block any attempts to integrate Virginia's public schools. While the state superintendent of education had promised \"no defiance of the Supreme Court.\" Byrd, on the other hand, issued a statement saying Virginia faced \"a crisis of the first magnitude\" and calling the decision by the Warren Court the \"most serious blow\" ever to states' rights.\n\nByrd decreed a policy of \"massive resistance\" to integrating the state's public schools which he rationalized on anti-miscegenation grounds. Miscegenation was illegal under Virginia's Racial Integrity Act of 1924. He was joined by Virginia's other Senator, A. Willis Robertson, and most other members of the organization. Byrd had a powerful ally in the United States House of Representatives, where the chairman of the House Rules Committee, Howard W. Smith, kept many civil rights bills from even coming to a vote on the floor. Governor Stanley joined with Byrd and Garland Gray, head of the powerful Democratic Caucus in the Virginia Senate, and established the Virginia Public Education Commission, that became known as the Gray Commission, to draft and pass a series of laws known as the Stanley plan to implement the \"massive resistance\" program announced in 1956.\n\nAfter Virginia's school-closing law was ruled unconstitutional in January 1959, the General Assembly repealed the compulsory school attendance law and made the operation of public schools a local option for the state's counties and cities. When journalist Edward R. Murrow, presented the program \"The Lost Class of '59\" on the CBS television network that focused on the organization's \"massive resistance\" program that had caused the shuttering of the public schools in several Virginia localities it caused national indignation.\n\nState and federal courts struck down most of the \"massive resistance\" laws by 1960. In response, Stanley's successor as governor, J. Lindsay Almond Jr., drafted several laws that implemented an extremely gradual desegregation process, popularly known as \"passive resistance.\" To most members of the organization Almond was committing apostasy by abandoning white supremacy, however the Supreme Court held that this didn't go far enough in 1968 in \"Green v. County School Board of New Kent County\". By then it was almost a moot point because Virginia's anti-miscegenation law that Byrd had used to rationalize \"massive resistance\" had been overturned in 1967 by the U.S. Supreme Court in \"Loving v. Virginia\", and most whites in Virginia localities with large black populations had abandoned the public schools for private segregation academies or in what became known as white flight fled Richmond and other inner cities for new suburbs just outside the city limits in neighboring rural (and predominately white) counties.\n\nEven before then, the failure of \"massive resistance\" caused some Byrd Democrats to conclude that obstinate resistance to integration could not continue. For example, in 1963, when the Prince Edward County school board balked at reopening the schools after four years, Governor Albertis S. Harrison advised the board members to comply with a court order to reopen unless they were willing to face prosecution. Earlier, Harrison had led the state's defense of \"massive resistance\" while serving as attorney general. A number of Byrd Democrats, like Governor Mills Godwin, made efforts to appeal to black voters. Godwin's 1965 run for governor was endorsed by the NAACP; earlier, while serving as lieutenant governor, he had campaigned for Lyndon Johnson during Johnson's presidential bid. However, Byrd, Robertson, Smith, Gray and a few others continued to oppose any form of integration.\n\nThe Byrd organization's response to federal desegregation orders in the 1950s has shaped the contours of the state's social, economic and political landscape well into the 21st century. Massive Resistance hurt Virginia in numerous ways. It worsened race relations by convincing blacks that white politicians would not treat them fairly and that the courts were the only branch of government they could trust. By making the impossible promise to preserve segregation, despite Federal court orders to desegregate, the Byrd organization pandered to the worst instincts in white voters. When state leaders ultimately failed to block integration, it made white citizens skeptical of all political promises. Massive Resistance also distracted Virginia from the task of improving public education, diverting money and attention from the real needs of the state's long underfunded public schools to private segregation academies. It also harmed economic development in Virginia by causing national corporations to become reluctant to locate in a state that by the 1960s was, like the rest of the South, increasingly seen as a cultural backwater by much of the nation due to its Jim Crow laws. The segregationist rhetoric of Byrd, Robertson and Smith in Washington and other Democrats in state government including Governor Almond, who did not appear to value public education, further tarnished states's image.\n\nBy the 1970s white flight to suburbs in neighboring counties had left the Richmond city public schools predominately black. In January 1972, federal judge Robert Merhige ruled that white students from suburbs in adjoining Henrico and Chesterfield counties in Virginia would have to be bused to the Richmond city schools in order to decrease the high percentage of black students in Richmond's public schools. One of Merhige's orders in that case was overturned by the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals on June 6, 1972, barring most desegregation busing schemes that made students cross county/city boundaries, thus effectively ending attempts to racially integrate schools in Virginia through forced busing.\n\nUnlike most U.S. states, Virginia has independent cities that are not part of the surrounding counties and therefore have separate school systems. The result is \"de facto\" segregation where most schools in Virginia's inner-cities cities like Richmond, Petersburg, and Newport News are predominately black while schools in neighboring suburban counties are predominately white. In many of Virginia's rural counties, private schools many of which were originally founded as segregation academies, still serve as the de facto school system for white children, while most blacks attend the public schools.\n\nMost segregation academies founded in Virginia during \"Massive Resistance\" are still thriving more than a half century later and some like Hampton Roads Academy, the Fuqua School, Nansemond-Suffolk Academy and Isle of Wight Academy continue to expand in the 21st century. Enrollment at Isle of Wight Academy now stands at approximately 650 students, the most ever enrolled at the school. In 2016 Nansemond Suffolk Academy opened a second campus in 2016, that includes an additional 22,000 square foot building for students in pre-kindergarten through grade 3. All of these schools had officially adopted non-discrimination policies and admitted a black student by the end of the 1980s and like other private schools, are now eligible for federal education money through what are known as Title programs that flow through public school districts. However, few blacks can afford the high cost of tuition to send their children to these private schools. In some cases their association with \"old money\" and past discrimination still cause some tension in the community, especially among non-whites and students of the local public schools. Their racist past may cause black parents who can afford the tuition to be reluctant to enroll their children in these schools.\n\nThe abandonment of public schools by most whites in Virginia's black majority rural counties and white flight from inner cities to suburbs after the failure of \"Massive Resistance\" has ultimately led to increasingly racially and economically isolated public schools in Virginia. In total, as of 2016 there were 74,515 students in these isolated schools, including 17 percent of all black students in Virginia's public schools and 8 percent of all Hispanic students. Many of these isolated schools are inner city schools in Richmond, Norfolk, Petersburg, Roanoke, and Newport News. In contrast, less than 1 percent of Virginia's non-Hispanic white students attended these isolated schools.,\n\nHarry F. Byrd Sr. retired from the U.S. Senate in 1965, and his eldest son, Harry Jr., a State Senator, was appointed to succeed him.\n\nHarry, Sr. died in 1966. A short time before his death, the Byrd Organization showed its first cracks when two of Harry, Sr.'s longtime allies were ousted in the Democratic primary by more liberal challengers. Senator Robertson, a 20-year incumbent, was defeated by State Senator William B. Spong Jr., whom President Lyndon Johnson had personally recruited to mount a primary challenge against him. Johnson was angered at Robertson's opposition to the Civil Rights and Voting Rights Acts. Also, Congressman Smith was defeated by State Delegate George Rawlings. While Spong went on to victory in November, Rawlings was defeated by conservative Republican William L. Scott, who gained the support of many conservative Democrats. A series of Supreme Court rulings imposing one man, one vote on state legislatures eliminated the rural advantages that served as the core of the Byrd Organization's power.\n\nThe Byrd Organization finally broke down in 1969, when a split in the Democratic Party allowed A. Linwood Holton Jr. to become the state's first Republican governor since Reconstruction. A year later, Republicans won six of the state's ten congressional districts — the first time Republicans had held a majority of the state's congressional delegation since Reconstruction. Ironically, one of the districts that turned Republican was the 7th District, the Byrds' home district. Holton was succeeded in 1974 by Godwin, a former Byrd Organization Democrat who had turned Republican. (Godwin had earlier served a term as governor, 1966-1970 as a Democrat, the last of the Byrd Organization members to hold the state's top office.) Meanwhile, despite the end of the Organization, Harry Byrd Jr., who himself had left the Democratic Party in 1970 declaring himself an Independent Democrat, remained in the US Senate until his retirement in 1983.\n\n\n"}

He made two large tours and published illustrated books with his observations of people, buildings, plants and animals.\n\nDe Bruijn was born in The Hague.\n\nDuring his first tour, he visited Rome, where he became a member of the Bentvueghels with the nickname \"Adonis\", which is how he signed the \"bentbrief\" of Abraham Genoels II. He travelled in Egypt and climbed to the top of a pyramid where he left his signature. De Bruijn made secret drawings of Jerusalem, then part of the Ottoman Empire. His drawings of Palmyra are copies. De Bruijn reached Cyprus and stayed among the Dutch merchants in Smyrna and Constantinople. From 1684 he worked in Venice with the painter Johann Carl Loth, returning in 1693 to The Hague, where he sold his souvenirs. In 1698 he published his book with drawings, which was a success and was translated in several languages. Two examples have colored illustrations, the first color prints in history. Among his drawings were the first pictures of the interior of the Great Pyramid and Jerusalem that became known in Europe.\n\nIn 1701 he headed for Archangelsk. During his second tour he visited the Samoyeds in northern Russia. In Moscow he became acquainted with emperor Peter the Great: de Bruijn painted his nieces, and the paintings were sent to possible candidates for marriage.\n\nIn late April 1703, De Bruijn left Moscow along with the party of an Armenian merchants from Isfahan whose name he recorded as Jacob Daviedof.\nDe Bruijn and the Armenians sailed down the Moscow River, the Oka and the Volga, eventually reaching Astrakhan. Thanks to de Bruijn's short stopover in Nizhny Novgorod during the Easter holidays, we now have his description of that major center of the Russian Volga trade as it existed in 1703, with its Kremlin, stone churches, and a lively bar (\"kabak\") scene.\n\nLeaving the borders of the Russian state, de Bruijn arrived to Persia, where he made drawings of towns like Isfahan and Persepolis (1704–1705). He continued to Java and returned to Persia, Russia, and ultimately the Netherlands.\n\nHis drawings of Persepolis, a city destroyed by Alexander the Great, caused a sensation. The mayor of Amsterdam Nicolaes Witsen and a member of the Royal Society probably asked him to draw the city famous for its 40 columns. For a century, they were the best prints available to western scholars. De Bruijn was accused of plagiarism and his second book, \"Reizen over Moskovie\" was not such a success. From Amsterdam he fled to Vianen.\n\nDe Bruijn died in Utrecht. It is not known when and where he was buried.\n\nDe Bruijn, who had read every Greek and Latin source he had been able to obtain, displays a convincing knowledge of subjects, at times going into the humorous. In Persia, he obtained a copy of Firdausi's \"Shahnamê\", which he summarized and made accessible to the west.\n\nOther English translations appeared in 1737, 1759, and 1873.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2037719", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2037719", "title": "Radamisto (Handel)", "text": "Radamisto (Handel)\n\nRadamisto (HWV 12) is an opera seria in three acts by George Frideric Handel to an Italian libretto by Nicola Francesco Haym, based on \"L'amor tirannico, o Zenobia\" by Domenico Lalli and \"Zenobia\" by Matteo Noris. It was Handel's first opera for the Royal Academy of Music. The opera's plot is loosely based on incidents from Tacitus's \"Annals of Imperial Rome\".\n\nIt was first performed at the King's Theatre, London on 27 April 1720, a performance attended by King George I and his son, the Prince of Wales, and was judged to be a success, resulting in 10 further performances. A revised version with different singers including the internationally renowned castrato Senesino in the first of many roles he performed in Handel's works was written for a revival on 28 December 1720. More revisions followed for yet another version presented in 1721. In 1728 \"Radamisto\" was again revised for another revival featuring the two famous prima donnas Cuzzoni and Faustina as well as Senesino. The first modern performance was in Göttingen on 27 June 1927.\n\nAs with most \"opere serie\", \"Radamisto\" went unperformed for many years, but with the revival of interest in Baroque music and historically informed musical performance since the 1960s, \"Radamisto\", like all Handel operas, receives performances at festivals and opera houses today. The first production in the US, in a semi-staged version, took place on 16 February 1980 in Washington, DC and the first fully staged presentation was given by Opera/Chicago in 1984. Among other productions, \"Radamisto\" was staged by Santa Fe Opera in 2008, by English National Opera in 2010 and by Theater an der Wien in 2013. An acclaimed production of \"Radamisto\" (first version) was directed by Sigrid T’Hooft at the Badisches Staatstheater in Karlsruhe, in 2009. Fully conceived in period style (it took its cue from an original prompt book), T'Hooft's staging was revived and now ranks among the most significant examples of historically informed performance in opera.\n\nIn the royal tent outside the city, Polissena, desperately unhappy, prays to the gods to help her in her sorrow (\"Sommi Dei\"). She is married to Tiridate, King of Armenia, but he has conceived a mad passion for another woman, Zenobia, who is married to Polissena's brother, Prince Radamisto, heir to the throne of the neighbouring kingdom of Thrace. Fraarte, Tiridate's brother, and Tigrane, an ally of Tiridate, come to Polissena and tell her that such is her husband's obsession with his sister-in-law Zenobia that he has declared war on the kingdom and is besieging the city, all so he can satisfy his desire for her. Fraarte and Tigrane advise Queen Polissena to forget about her husband (\"Deh! fuggi un traditore\") and console herself with Tigrane (\"L’ingrato non amar\"), who is in love with her, but Polissena is not interested. Tiridate enters and tells his wife to leave; King Farasmane of Thrace, her father, is brought to Tiridate in chains, having been captured in the battle and Tiridate warns he will be put to death unless Zenobia is given to him. Polissena pleads for mercy, but Tiridate dismisses her (\"Tu vuoi ch’io parta\"). \n\nIn the camp of Tiridate, Radamisto and Zenobia have come to try to negotiate the release of King Farasmene, Radamisto's father. Tiridate threatens to kill Farasmene unless they surrender the city (\"Con la strage de’ nemici\"). Radamisto and Zenobia are anguished (\"Cara sposa, amato bene\"). In order to prevent further bloodshed, Zenobia offers herself to Tiridate (\"Son contenta di morire\"), leaving Radamisto torn (\"Perfido, di a quell'empio tiranno\") but Farasmene says he prefers to die rather than live by the sacrifice of his daughter-in-law's honour (\"Son lievi le catene\").\n\nIn front of Tiridate's palace, he is greeted as he returns victorious from the battle. Radamisto and Zenobia have escaped and King Farasmene will be held hostage until they are found. Polissena rebukes her husband Tiridate for his dishonourable behaviour and his adulterous pursuit of his sister-in-law but his only response is to tell her to keep quiet (\"Segni di crudeltà\"). Tigrane again presses his attentions on her, but Polissena rejects him and can only hope that happier times lie ahead (\"Dopo l'orride procelle\").\n\nIn the countryside by the river Araxes, Radamisto and Zenobia are fleeing from Tiridate and his army. Zenobia is at the end of her endurance; Tiridate is waging war and shedding blood all in the attempt to satisfy his lust for her (\"Vuol ch’io serva\"). It seems to her the best thing would be her death and then his cruelty would cease. She asks her husband to kill her; he tries to stab her as she asks but cannot bring himself to inflict more than a slight wound whereupon she jumps into the river. Radamisto is captured by Tigrane and his men who offer to take him to his sister Polissena. Radamisto is grief-stricken by what he assumes to be his wife's death and prays for peace for her soul (\"Ombra cara di mia sposa\"). In fact Zenobia has been rescued from drowning by Fraarte; Zenobia is still full of fury towards Tiridate (\"Già che morir non posso\"), even as Fraarte tries to console her (\"Lascia pur amica spene\").\n\nIn the garden of Tiridate's palace, Zenobia is led in by Fraarte and presented to Tiridate, who still passionately desires her (\"Sì che ti renderai\"). Her only concern is trying to find out her husband's whereabouts (\"Fatemi, oh Cieli, almen\"). In fact, Radamisto is now in the same palace, having been brought to his sister Queen Polissena by Tigrane, who is hoping that the conflict can now be resolved (\"La sorte, il Ciel amor\"). Radamisto wants to assassinate Tiridate but Polissena loves her husband despite everything and refuses to take part in such a plot, leaving Radamisto furious at her faithfulness to a tyrant (\"Vanne, sorella ingrata\").\n\nInside the palace, Zenobia is still mourning her fate (\"Che farà quest'alma mia\") while Tiridate continues to harass her with his desires. Tigrane brings them the false news that Radamisto has died, and presents Radamisto's supposed servant,\"Ismeno\", really Radamisto himself in disguise, who relates Radamisto's last words. Zenobia recognises her husband's voice, and when the two of them are left alone, she and Radamisto sing of their love for each other (\"Se teco vive il cor\")\n\nOutside the palace, Tigrane and Fraarte agree that Tiridate's monstrous tyranny must be stopped (\"S'adopri il braccio armato\"). Tigrane, recognising the hopelessness of his love for Polissena, perseveres nonetheless (\"So ch'è vana la speranza\").\n\nIn a room of the palace, Zenobia is concerned that her husband's disguise will be seen through and he seeks to allay her fears (\"Dolce bene di quest'alma\"). He hides as Tiridate comes in and again attempts to seduce Zenobia. Radamisto emerges from hiding as Polissena and Farasmene also enter, preventing Tiridate from molesting Zenobia, but Farasmane recognises his son Radamisto and calls him by name. Tiridate orders Radamisto to be executed, leaving Radamisto (\"Vile! se mi dai vita\") and Zenobia outraged at his tyranny (\"Barbaro! partirò, ma sdegno poi verrà\"). Despite the pleas of his wife Polissena, whose love for her husband is turning to hatred, Tiridate stays firm. Radamisto and Zenobia take a tearful farewell of each other (\"Deggio dunque, oh Dio, lasciarti\" and \"Qual nave smarrita\").\n\nInside a temple, Tiridate is determined to marry Zenobia despite everything. Polissena brings him news that the army, led by Tigrane and Fraarte, has mutinied and the people have rebelled. Surrounded by his enemies, Tiridate now sees the error of his ways. He releases Zenobia and Radamisto, who celebrate their reunion (\"Non ho più affanni\"), asks forgiveness from his wife, and vows to rule for the benefit of his people for the rest of his life. All celebrate the fortunate turn of events.\n\nThe German-born Handel, after spending some of his early career composing operas and other pieces in Italy, settled in London, where in 1711 he had brought Italian opera for the first time with his opera \"Rinaldo\". A tremendous success, \"Rinaldo\" created a craze in London for Italian opera seria, a form focused overwhelmingly on solo arias for the star virtuoso singers. In 1719, Handel was appointed music director of an organisation called the Royal Academy of Music (unconnected with the present day London conservatoire), a company under royal charter to produce Italian operas in London. Handel was not only to compose operas for the company but hire the star singers, supervise the orchestra and musicians, and adapt operas from Italy for London performance.\n\n\"Radamisto\" was Handel's first opera for the Royal Academy and was an enormous success with London audiences,as Handel's first biographer John Mainwaring noted; 'Many (ladies), who had forc'd their way into the house with an impetuosity ill suited to their rank and sex, actually fainted through the excessive heat and closeness of it. Several gentlemen were turned back, who had offered forty shillings for a seat in the gallery, after having despaired of getting any in the pit or boxes'.\n\nLady Mary Cowper noted in her diary: \"At night, Radamistus, a fine opera of Handel’s making. The King there with his ladies. The Prince in the stage-box. Great crowd.\"\n\nIn the opinion of 18th century musicologist Charles Burney \"Radamisto\" was \"more solid, ingenious, and full of fire than any drama which Handel had yet produced in this country.\"\n\nThe opera is scored for strings, flute, two oboes, bassoon, two horns and continuo instruments (cello, lute, harpsichord).\n\nUnusually for a Handel opera, the work contains a quartet, at the climax of the piece in Act Three. To Jonathan Keates, \"Radamisto\" is a work of the first stage of Handel's maturity as a composer, with its \"masterly\" invention and characterisation through music.\n\nNotes\nSources\n\n"}

With a pH. Level varying from 3.5 to 4.5, it is strictly adapted to growing in acid substrates. (That strictness to acidity seemingly has implications to its cultivation.) It is found in the evergreen Sclerophyllous (\"Uapaca\") woodland or savanna zones dominated by scattered woody plants. It grows at altitudes of 1250–1900 m (sometimes 2000 m).\n\nAssociated plant species, site indicators, include \"Pachypodium densiflorum\", \"P. eburneum\" (Apocynaceae), \"Aloe compressa,\" \"A. capitata,\" (Asphodelaceae), \"Euphorbia quartzicola\" (Euphorbiaceae), (Orchidaceae), (Graminaea), (Bryophyta), and Lichenes.\nIt occurs in a region that receives an annual rainfall of 1354 mm with a number of 5 dry months. Average monthly temperatures varies from 9 °C to 17 °C. The yearly average temperature is higher; however, at 13 °C to 18.4 °C.\n\n\"Tsimondrimondry\" (Merina); \"Kimondromondro\" (Betsileo)\n\n\"Pachypodium brevicaule\" is unique to the genus in habit. It is considered a dwarf plant. It takes on a broad flattenened tuberous, cactus-like habit that has a very short trunk measuring 2 to 8 cm high and an exaggerated diameter that can reach 10 to 40 cm. When in flower the plant gains stature by reaching a height of 25 cm. \"Pachypodium brevicaule\" Baker barely, if all, \"branches.\" Rather it seems to form protruding nodes or rosettes of leaves that ranch from 1 to 4 cm in length and 2 to 4 cm in width. In the \"Botanical Key for the Genus \"Pachypodium\",\" the character \"without branches or branchlets\" is a distinguishing morphological character to the species \"Pachypodium brevicaule\"'s definition.\n\nThe bark is colored pale grey and is sometimes shiny. It has a smooth texture. The bark is about 2 to 4 mm thick, with the wood being greenish. The \"branches\" or, better said, nodes of rosettes of leaves, when fresh, have paired, rather soft, curved spines at their apices, measuring 2 to 9 mm long by 1 to 1.5 mm at the base. They are pale grey to pale brown. When young, they are pubescent and more or less flat.\n\n\"Pachypodium brevicaule\" has leaves that are confined to the apices of the branches or nodes and rosettes. The leaves are sessile, without a stem, petiolate (\"with a stalk\") peduncle (\"the main axis of the inflorescence\") or pedicel (\"the stalk of a single flower\") or it is shortly petiolate (\"having a stalk\"). If it has a stalk, the petiole measures up to 2 mm long. It is sparsely pubescent, fuzzy. \nThe leaf blade is herbaceous, not woody-like, and glaucous, covered in a very fine bloom or a fine powdery layer, when fresh and papery when dried. The blade is shaped ovate, broad and rounded at the base and tapering toward the end, to obovate, egg-shaped and flat with the narrow end attached to the stalk. It measures 11 to 30 mm in length by 6 to 12 mm in width. The apex of the blade is acuminate, narrowing to a slender point. The base is blunt or rounded. The blade of \"Pachypodium brevicaule\" Baker is glabrous, smooth, to sparsely pubescent, slightly hairy, on both sides, with impressed venation above, and with midrib and secondary veins prominent beneath. There are 15-30 pairs of secondary veins, which are straight at the base, upcurved at the apex, and forming an angle of 45-85° with the costa, or the midrib of a leaf. The tertiary, third-level, venation are reticulate, forming a web or a network like pattern.\n\nThe inflorescence of \"Pachypodium brevicaule\" is sessile, with a stalk, or pedunculate, with the main axial stem to an inflorescence. It can be congested with up to 7 flowers where the inflorescence measures 2.5 to 15 cm in length by 2 to 6.5 cm in width. The peduncle, itself, is glaucous and covered in a fine bloom. It takes the shape of a terete, an elongated cylindrical form that is round in cross-section. The terete measures roughly up to 120 mm in length by 2 to 4 mm in width. The degree of pubescent varies on the peduncle from sparsely to fully hairy, pubescent. The pedicels, the stalk of a single flower, measures up to 8 mm long and is hairy, pubescent.\n\nThe bracts, modified leaves at the base of a pedicel of a flower, a peduncle, or a branch, are longer than the pedicels on \"Pachypodium brevicaule\" Baker. They are narrowly oblong, having a somewhat elongated form with approximately parallel sides, to obovate, egg-shaped and flat with the narrow end attached to the stalk. The bracts measure from 5 to 13 mm long by 1.5 to 3 mm wide.. At their apex, they are acuminate, tapering gradually to a sharp point, or acute, having a sharp point or tip. On the outside, the bracts are fully pubescent, hairy to slightly so. Inside they are less so.\n\nThe sepals of \"Pachypodium brevicaule's\" flower are glaucous, having a fine bloom over the surface. This bloom covers the basal part of the corolla tube, the petals of a flower considered as a group or unit and usually of a color other than green, or the inner whorl of the perianth shaped like a tube. The sepals are connate, united to a structure of the same kind, i.e. other sepals, at the base for about 0.5 mm. They are narrowly ovate, broad and rounded at the base and tapering toward the end, or narrowly oblong, having a somewhat narrowly elongated form with approximately parallel sides. The sepals measure 6 to 11 mm long by 2 to 3 mm wide. At the apex, they are acuminate, tapering gradually to a sharp point, or acute, having a sharp point or tip. Outside the sepals are often glabrous and smooth; whereas inside in the lower part and near the apex, they are slightly pubescent, hairy.\n\nThe corolla, the inner whorl of the perianth, is bright yellow. It measures 17 to 25 mm long in the mature bud and forms a comparatively wide broadly ovoid, shaped like an egg, ovate, head measuring 7 to 11 mm long by 5 to 8 mm wide. The apex of the bud is obtuse, having a blunt or rounded tip. Overall the bud is pubescent outside. The corolla lobes are not as hairy; however. Especially where the lobes and tubes are covered in bud, the surface is glabrous. The pubescent belt inside the corolla tube is 2 mm above to 1 mm below where the stamens are inserted, not emerging beyond the corolla tube. Otherwise the corolla tube is glabrous and smooth. It is shaped like a funnel, infundibuliform, at 12 to 18 mm long (1.63 times as large as the calyx and 1.05 to 1.36 times as long as the lopes) The basal of the corolla tube is almost cylindrical. It is 2 to 3 mm long by 2 to 2.5 mm wide above the base (0.15 to 0.18 times the entire length of the entire tube.) The upper part of the corolla tube is almost cylindrical. Yet it widens at the throat altering the cylindrical form. The upper part measures 10 to 15 mm long by 5 to 5.7 mm wide at the mouth. The lobes are obliquely obovate, having sides of unequal length or form, which are egg-shaped and flat with the narrow end attached to the stalk. At their apex, the lobe of \"Pachypodium brevicaule\" Baker are rounded. They measure 9 to 18 mm in length by 8.5 to 14 mm in width. (That is, in proportion, the lobes are 0.73 to 0.94 times as long as the corolla tube and 1.1 to 1.3 times as long as they are wide.)\n\nThe stamens of \"Pachypodium brevicaule\", with an apex of 4 to 9 mm below the mouth of the corolla tube, are inserted, meaning they do not extend beyond the corolla tube or mouth of the flower. They measure from the base 3.5 to 4 mm. (Proportionally they are 0.22-0.29 of the length of the corolla tube.) The stamens are the \"male reproductive\" organ of an angiospermous flowering plant.\n\nThe anthers, the part of the stamen, typically on top, which bears the pollen, commonly consisting of (1) two of four thecae, which contain the pollen and (2) a sterile region in between the connective that is very narrowly triangular. The anthers range in size for \"Pachypodium brevicaule\" from 4.7 to 5.2 mm long by 0.7 to 0.9 mm wide. (Proportionally, that is, they are 5.22 to 7.14 times as long as wide.) Inside, the anthers are pubescent and hairy at the base of the connective, the part of tissue in a stamen that separates the two thecae of an anther. As well, it is pubescent just below where stamens cohere with the pistil head, the fertile region of the flower.\n\nComposing the female reproductive organ, the pistil varies in length from 4.8 to 6.5 mm. \nPubescent and hairy, the ovary measures ovary 1.5 to 1.9 mm long (x) by 1.3 to 1.6 mm wide (y) by 1.2 mm high (z). The disk in a pistil is the slightly thickened, or otherwise distinguished region, around the style in certain flowers that secret nectar. The disks of \"Pachypodium brevicaule\" Baker number 5 broad ovate glands that are broad and rounded at the base and tapering toward their end. These glands, for which either 2 or 2 pair can be partly fused together, are about half as long as the ovary. (Proportionally that 0.5 times 1.5 to 1.9 mm.).\n\nThe often cylindrical stalk-like portion connecting the stigma with the carpel or ovary, the style is slightly pubescent and hairy at the base for the taxon. The stigma is the top-most receptive region of the style, which often divided into stigma-lobes that are commonly wet by a sticky exudate that helps captures and nourish pollen grains. The carpel, furthermore, is the female organ of the angiospermous flower that consists of a modified leaf that contains the ovules. Several carpels can be fused together to form a compound ovary.\n\nThe slightly pubescent style for \"Pachypodium brevicaule\" measures 2.6 to 3.6 mm long. The pistil head, the separate part attached to the style, is 0.71 to 1.0 mm high. It composition is complex. Its basal part is 0.4 to 0.6 mm long by 0.4 to 0.6 mm wide. The central part is ring-shaped at 0.15 to 0.2 mm in length by 0.5 by 0.7 mm in width. And, its stigmoid apex measures 0.1 to 0.15 mm long by 0.3 to 0.5 mm wide.\nEach carpel contains approximately 50 ovules.\n\nThe fruit of \"Pachypodium brevicaule\" has two separate mericarps that form an angle of 5-45° at its base. Sometimes it is possible to see flowers on the same inflorescence that has fruit. Mericarps are the parts of a \"schizocarp\" fruit, that becomes dry at maturity and subsequently splits or breaks into several smaller pieces--\"i.e. individual mericarp or seed. The mericarps are colored pale to dark brown with longitudinal lines outside and whitish inside when dried. The fruits are fusiform at 57 to 140 mm long (x) by 3 to 5 mm wide (y) by 2 to 4 mm high (z). They are obtuse, having a blunt or rounded tip, to acute, having a sharp point or tip, at the apex. The surface of the fruit is pubescent and hairy. The exterior wall is 1 mm thick.\n\nThe seed of \"Pachypodium brevicaule\" Baker is pale brown. It is shaped in an elliptical manner. Its margin has a distinct broader that is revolute, rolled backward from the tip or margins to the undersurface, towards the hilar. The hilar pertains the hilum, which is a scar on a seed indicating the point of attachment to the funiculus, the stalk connecting a seed with the placenta. The seed measures 3.5 to 3.9 mm in length by 1.5 to 1.8 mm in width. The testa, the outer and normally hard and protective layer of the seed, is smooth. The coma of \"Pachypodium brevicaule\" Baker is straw-colored at 13 to 21 mm long. A coma is usually terminal tuft of hairs on a seed. In the case of \"Pachypodium\", the coma allows the seed to be airborne, as that is its means of distribution.\nWhereas the embryo measures 3.2 to 3.5 mm in length, the cotyledons are 1.5 in length by 1.5 mm in width. The cotyledons are ovate in shape, meaning that they are broad and rounded at the base and tapering toward the apex. They are cordate, having a heart shape, at the base. The rootlet is 2 to 2.5 mm long by 1.2 mm wide. (Proportionately that is 1.3 to 1.6 times as long as cotyledons)\n\n\"Pachypodium brevicaule\" Baker \nJohn Gilbert Baker published \"Pachypodium brevicaule\" in 1887 in Journ. Linn. Soc.

He is one of ten children—nine boys and one girl.\n\nAs a child, he lived in the South Park neighborhood of Dayton. During a family trip in April 1959, he participated in the White House Easter Egg Roll and met President Dwight D. Eisenhower. He attended Chaminade-Julienne High School, a Catholic High School located in Dayton. Upon his graduation, he enlisted and served in the United States Navy.\n\nAfter serving in the United States Navy, Estevez began pursuing an acting career starting in the early 1970s. He initially used his mother's maiden name, Phelan, before using his surname, Estevez. Throughout his career, Estevez has appeared in numerous film and television roles in lead, supporting, and minor parts playing protagonists and antagonists, and he frequently appears in moderate and low-budget independent features and B-movies. In addition, he has worked as a voice-over artist and performs in stage productions. He has expressed in an interview that he wants to make movies that make a difference.\n\nEstevez stood in for his brother in a number of long shots and in some of the voice-overs for \"Apocalypse Now\" (1979), as Martin Sheen was recovering from his heart attack.\n\nIn 1992, he acted in \"Armed for Action\" and \"Blood on the Badge\".\n\nHe plays a villain, Cyrus, in the film \"Doonby\" (2012), which features former \"The Dukes of Hazzard\" star John Schneider as a mysterious stranger who comes into a small town and falls in love with the spoiled daughter of Estevez's character, the local doctor. He also co-stars with David Faustino in the feature \"Not Another B Movie\" (2011) released by Troma Entertainment.\n\nEstevez has recently worked with alternative-comedians Tim Heidecker and Gregg Turkington on various projects including \"On Cinema\", \"The Tim Heidecker Murder Trial\" and as President Jason Davidson (and President Davidson Jr.) on the Adult Swim series \"Decker\". In all his collaborations, Estevez either plays a fictionalized version of himself or a character being portrayed by a fictionalized version of Joe Estevez.\n\nEstevez has been married twice. He married Shirley Monkman in 1978 and raised three daughters: Casey, Amanda, and Angela. His second wife is actress Constance Anderson, whom he married in 2004.\n\nJoe Estevez is the youngest sibling, to his brother Martin Sheen. Joe Estevez sounds very similar to his older brother, a fact he took advantage of when he did a voice-over for a National Shooting Sports Foundation pro-gunmaker commercial in 2000; at the time, his brother was famous for playing a fictional President of the United States on the television series \"The West Wing\". Sheen starred in a pro-gun control commercial that same year. Estevez also recorded the voiceover for his brother's role as Captain Willard in Apocalypse Now after Sheen's health issues on set prevented him from doing so.\n\n"}

The term may be applied to the surname, the given name or to the entire name. Where births are required to be officially registered, the entire name entered onto a births register or birth certificate may by that fact alone become the person's legal name. The assumption in the Western world is often that the name from birth (or perhaps from baptism or \"brit milah\") will persist to adulthood in the normal course of affairs—either throughout life, or until marriage. Some possible changes concern middle names, diminutive forms, changes relating to parental status (due to one's parents' divorce, or adoption by different parents), and changes related to gender transition. Matters are very different in some cultures in which a birth name is for childhood only, rather than for life. \n\nThe French and English-adopted terms née and né (; ; ) have been used to indicate maiden or married names. \n\nThe term \"née\", having feminine grammatical gender, can be used to denote a woman's surname at birth that has been replaced or changed. In most English-speaking cultures, it is specifically applied to a woman's maiden name after her surname has changed due to marriage. The term \"né\", having masculine grammatical gender, can be used to denote a man's surname at birth which has subsequently been replaced or changed. The diacritic marks (the acute accent) are considered significant to its spelling, and ultimately its meaning, but are sometimes omitted. According to Oxford University's \"Dictionary of Modern English Usage\", the terms are typically placed after the current surname (e.g. 'Ann Smith, \"née\" Jones' or 'Adam Smith, \"né\" Jones'). Because they are terms adopted into English from French, they do not have to be italicized, but often are.\n\nIn Polish tradition, the term \"de domo\" (literally meaning \"of house\" in Latin) may be used, with rare exceptions meaning the same as \"née\".\n\n"}

{"id": "2037730", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2037730", "title": "Diogo Rodrigues", "text": "Diogo Rodrigues\n\nDom Diogo Rodrigues, Dom Diogo Roiz ( 1490-1496; Lagos, Portugal – 21 April 1577; Colvá, Goa) was a Portuguese explorer of the Indian Ocean who sailed as an ordinary helmsman under the command of Dom Pedro Mascarenhas around Goa. They sailed from the Cape of Good Hope eastward into little-known waters of the newly discovered route to Goa. It was after him that the island of Rodrigues was\\is named between 4 and 9 February 1528 after discovering it during his only return journey from Goa via Cochin (left on 15 January 1528) to Portugal, following which he rose to the rank of a knight \"(cavaleiro)\". He then returned to Goa and made a mark in the history of the Portuguese empire in the subcontinent around the mid 16th century.\n\nIn the early 16th century, Dom Diogo Fernandes Pereira was appointed captain of a Setúbal ship bound for Goa. He is said to have struck a wide arc east of Madagascar and stumbled upon the island of Réunion, which he promptly named ilha de Santa Apolónia (in honor of the St. Apollonia whose day it was, 9 February 1507). He then proceeded east to discover the island of Mauritius, which he named ilha do Cirne (the name of his ship). From there Fernandes went further east and discovered the island he named as ilha de Diogo Fernandes, Domigo Friz or Domingo Frias (the latter two probably are cartographic transcriptions or abbreviations of 'Diogo Fernandes'). He is also said to have stopped for water at the first and third islands, before returning to Mozambique. Diogo Fernandes island ('Domigo Friz') was visited by Dom Diogo Lopes de Sequeira in 1509 and the name 'Dom Galopes' (another transcribed abbreviation) sometimes appears for that island in some maps. It went through its final permanent name change to Rodrigues island a few years later, after another Portuguese explorer in 1528 when making their way back across the Indian Ocean from Goa navigated via the islands of Réunion, Mauritius and Rodrigues, naming this entire archipelago the Mascarenes Island, Mascarene or Mascarenhas Islands, after his countryman and commander Pedro Mascarenhas, who had been around before in 1512. It was around February 1528 itself that Diogo Rodrigues saw Rodrigues with such a drive along the group of Mascarene islands that bears his family name Rodrigues.\n\nDiogo Rodrigues set up his base in Goa, learnt the local language, was commander of the construction for the fort of Goa and governor of the island of Salsette \"(later part of Bombay, present Mumbai)\" \"(called as ilha de Salcete do Norte at that time)\" as it was leased to him from 25 October 1535 to 1548 after the Treaty of Bassein between the Portuguese viceroy Dom Nuno da Cunha and Bahadur Shah of the Gujarat Sultanate that placed the islands into Portuguese possession from 1534. He was also known as Mestre Diego for his artistic contributions to the beautification of Salsette. Also in the defence of the fortress of Diu, Diu Fort whose reconstruction he was involved with, under the military leadership of Dom João de Castro in 1535 and the fort was considered impregnable later as it resisted for more than four centuries to multiple intrusion attempts. Diogo also owned the entire beach called \"praia da Colva\" (beach of Colva) in Goa that was passed on to his family descendants as a part of the family property, this is the same village where he constructed his huge residential house in 1551.\n\nRodrigues was the Captain of Rachol in Salcette, Goa, the chief town during the earliest Portuguese conquest. It was then a fortress and the church was considered as the first in dignity of Salcette \"(called as ilha de Salcete do Sul at that time)\"; as this first church at Rachol and hence Salcette was built to completion in the year 1565, on the site of Hindu temples and was built in mud with a thatched roof. It can thus be called the mother church (Matriz) of the whole of South Goa and was named Igreja da Nossa Senhora de Neves. It was the first Archbishop of Goa, Dom Gaspar Jorge de Leão Pereira who personally visited Margão and its surrounding areas to choose the location. After visiting several places, he guarded an arrow into the ground at Rachol and ordered to build the church there; Rodrigues, the Captain of Rachol, was appointed to do the needful.\nJosé Nicolau da Fonseca has recorded that Diogo Rodrigues died in Colvá, Goa and was buried inside this mother church (Matriz) of Salcette of which he was the Captain of the fort at that time called Igreja da Nossa Senhora de Neves at Rachol with his grave's inscription reading: \"Aqui jaz Diogo Rodrigues o do Forte, Capitão desta Fortaleza, O qual derrubou os pagodes destas terras. Falleceu a 21 de Abril de 1577 annos\". In English translation this reads: \"Here lies Diogo Rodrigues (called) 'O do Forte/ Captain of this Fortress, who destroyed the pagodas of these territories. He died on the 21st April of the year 1577.\" The grave inscription stone and his relics are still inside the church, near the altar of Igreja da Nossa Senhora de Neves from 1577. Hindu temples of Salcette in Goa were destroyed by Diego who personally oversaw this destruction in 1567. This led to the mass exodus of Hindus from the Portuguese held territories and the Hindus taking the idols of their deities across the Zuari river to the territories of the Hindu Sonde Kings. Amongst the temples destroyed are the temples of Shri Ramnathi, Shree Shantadurga and Shree Mangeshi. Also destroyed were nine pagodas in the village of Margão (Mathagrama) by Diogo, who was rewarded with the revenues of the lands belonging to them the destruction was triggered when a Jesuit was attacked and when the community of Loutolim disobeyed Diogo Rodrigues, the then Captain of the Fort of Rachol as he had called the residents of the village of Lotoulim for a meeting, but they did not turn up. As a punishment to them, he burnt down the temple of Ramnath. The villagers filed a case with Capitão às Justiças de sua Magestad in Goa. The magistrate ordered the Captain to rebuild the temple. With the support of the Archbishop Primaz and the Provincial Council, the Captain obtained an Order from the Viceroy to burn down en masse the temples of Salcete, consequently the viceroy: Dom António de Noronha (1564–1568) at the request of the Archbishop and the Jesuits ordered Diogo Rodrigues to burn down all the remaining temples he found in Salcette, the viceroy also issued a decree in December 1565 forbidding the erection of new temples and the repairs of the existing ones, this was as stated: \"I hereby order that in any area owned by my master, the King, nobody should construct a Hindu temple and such temples already constructed should not be repaired without my permission. If this order is transgressed, such temples shall be, destroyed and the goods in them shall be used to meet expenses of holy deeds, as punishment of such transgression.\" Diogo Rodrigues was also known as \"O do Forte\", In English: \"Of the Strong\", the Captain of Salcette who ordered the destruction of the temples of Assolna, Ambelim, Velim, Veroda, Cuncolim and Talvorda, when the villagers failed to obey some of his orders. The property and income of the temples were given to the church authorities. The exact date when the Captain Diogo Rodrigues descended upon the temple of Malsa devi (to be converted into a Church of Our Lady of Conception in future) in all fury was on 7 March 1567 just at the time when the priest was about to bedeck the idol of Mahalasa with silver ornaments. Those ornaments were confiscated along with other valuables of the temple and a proper inventory of the movables was made, then began the act of destruction. The image in the sanctum sanctorum was broken to pieces allegedly because Fr. Luis Goes had denounced her as a ‘bad woman’. The villagers managed to spirit away other idols. Sacred books and works of art that enhanced the beauty of this temple together with the roof were ruthlessly destroyed. The Captain retreated after planting a Cross at the most prominent spot at the site. The details of the destruction of this temple are to be found in the Report of Irmão Gomes Vaz dated 12 December 1567 which notes that the temple was totally destroyed on 14 March 1567. Diego Rodrigues took toll of 280 temples in Salcette alone. The cults from those temples were shifted mainly to the New Conquest areas where, the Desais and the Sardesais, the feudal lords of Sultan Adil Shaha of Bijapur, being Hindus themselves, took it as their holy duty to facilitate creation of new abodes for the said cults.\n\nAlfred North-Coombes records that maps of the island dated to 1540 of Plate 49 of the monumenta shows charts from both atlases and indicates as \"do d0 ROIZ\" also the Wolfenbuttel chart of c. 1540 carried the following inscriptions \"\"i que achou Diogo Roiz\"\". Dom Diogo's surname Rodrigues was replaced by Roiz later after receiving his knighthood (or Royes as it was written in some Dutch maps) as it was a royal diminutive of Rodrigues, who was knighted and received the royal confirmation from King João III, an honor granted only to those Rodrigues aristocratic families for service to the monarch or empire. It is also concluded that the exact date of discovering the island of Rodrigues by Diogo Roiz was between 4 and 9 February 1528 as they had left from Cochin under the command and presence of Pedro Mascarenhas on 15 January 1528 with a fleet of four ships to appeal to the King. Under favorable north-east monsoon conditions, it would take twenty to twenty five days to reach the Mascarene islands. The island was chosen to be called Rodrigues permanently from February 1528. Portugal did not claim any ownership, but used the island as a mark for sailing and had officially marked it on all maps, cartographic materials of that time either as Rodrigues, Diogo Roiz, Roiz or Diogo Rodrigues.\n\nRodrigues had two sons, Dom Nicolau Roiz and Dom Inácio Roiz, from a woman belonging to the Prabhu (Prabhu Dessai - As today) family of Hindu feudal lords called Vitola Porob Dessay and married her on 29 November 1512 as recorded in the letters available at the archives with document number ANTT: CC II, 35-162. The family used the royal diminutive of Roiz instead of its simple form Rodrigues until the late 19th century as the family name. The standing monument in Colva, Goa is the existing burial structural evidence with inscriptions of the Roiz (Rodrigues) family in Goa. This monument was rebuilt to a bigger structure in 1857 and still stands intact from 2 May 1857, as one of the great grandsons of D. Diogo died suddenly due to illness at a young age of 38 years, namely Dom Sebastião Francisco Roiz. The monument inscription reads: \"\"Eis os restos de Seb F Roiz fala 18-8-1855 de 38 annos colla 2-5-57 ese pede aos viand pater no p'sua alma\"\". In English translation: \"This is the resting place of Sebastião Francisco Roiz who died on 18-08-1855 at 38 years of age and this monument was built in memory of him on the 02-05-1857 and for the resting of his family members\". This was\\is the only family in Colva of Goa with Roiz (Rodrigues) ancestry and one part of the descendants from his son Nicolau still live in the ancestral house that was built by Rodrigues in Colva, Goa and still owned parts of Colva beach property until the 21st century under Indian governance. The family monument is maintained by various family descendant members until date.\n\n"}

Edman was a player at Helsingborgs IF until 1999, which was his first time leaving Sweden and moved abroad. In 2001, after having unremarkable spells at Italian club Torino and Karlsruher SC in Germany, Edman returned to Sweden and joined AIK for one season. After that, Heerenveen in the Netherlands brought Edman from Sweden.\n\nIn July 2004, Tottenham Hotspur signed Edman from Heerenveen. Edman quickly established himself at the club, and will probably be best remembered at Spurs for his stunning goal, which he scored from 41 yards out, in the Premier League match against Liverpool in April 2005. It was later dubbed \"El Basatardo Gol\" by the Mexican press, after footage was leaked within the Mexico national team camp. However, in the summer of 2005, the arrival of South Korean left back, Lee Young-Pyo, led Edman to make the decision of leaving England.\n\nIn the last week of August, Spurs accepted an offer from French club Rennes. It did not take long for Edman to impress his new manager, László Bölöni, and once again established himself as first choice at left-back.\n\nIn January 2008, Edman was signed by Wigan Athletic for a transfer fee of £500,000. The arrival of Edman was a good deal for Wigan Athletic, since the club did not find a good replacement after the departure of Leighton Baines, the previous summer. In March 2008, Edman was injured in a match against Blackburn Rovers, damaging his anterior crutiate ligament in his knee. This means he missed the rest of Wigan's season, as well as Euro 2008. Edman made his return to the Wigan team, as a substitute in January 2009 at Old Trafford, as Wigan lost 1–0 to Manchester United. However, he has lacked playing time, due to injuries and Maynor Figueroa's impressive performances throughout the season, which have earned him a spot in Roberto Martínez's starting eleven. Edman played his last game in the Latics' 9–1 loss against Tottenham Hotspur in November, where he had a torrid time against Aaron Lennon.\n\nOn 5 February 2010, Helsingborgs IF confirmed that they had resigned Edman. Edman signed a five-year contract with the Swedish club.\n\nEdman was a part of the Swedish national team setup from 2001 until 2009. In 2002, he was part of Sweden's 2002 World Cup squad, but did not make any appearances. He then began to feature more regularly for Sweden after the 2002 World Cup, and at Euro 2004 and the 2006 World Cup, he featured as a starting left back for the team.\n\nHe scored his first and only goal, a free kick, in a 2006 World Cup qualifier against Bulgaria at the Vasil Levski National Stadium in March 2005.\n\nEdman missed UEFA Euro 2008 due to a serious knee injury.

{"id": "2037783", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2037783", "title": "Fred Hutchinson", "text": "Fred Hutchinson\n\nFrederick Charles Hutchinson (August 12, 1919 – November 12, 1964) was an American professional baseball player, a major league pitcher for the Detroit Tigers, and the manager for three major league teams.\n\nBorn and raised in Seattle, Washington, Hutchinson was stricken with fatal lung cancer at the height of his managerial career as leader of the pennant-contending 1964 Cincinnati Reds. He was commemorated one year after his death when his surgeon brother, Dr. William Hutchinson (1909–1997), created the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, as a division of the Pacific Northwest Research Foundation. The \"Fred Hutch\", which became independent in 1975, is now one of the best-known facilities of its kind in the world.\n\nBorn in Seattle, Hutchinson was the youngest son of Dr. Joseph Lambert Hutchinson and Nona Burke Hutchinson Both were born in Wisconsin and they relocated to Seattle in 1907. A graduate of the medical school at Marquette University in Milwaukee, he was a general practitioner in the Rainier Beach area in the southeast part of Seattle. The oldest of the four Hutchinson children was daughter Mary Joy (Crosetto) (1904–1989).\n\nSons Bill and John were older than Fred by 10 and seven years, respectively, and both played baseball at Franklin High School and at the University of Washington in Seattle under head coach Tubby Graves. Bill captained the 1931 Huskies team which won the Pacific Coast Conference title and John (1912–1991) later played in the St. Louis Browns organization.\n\nThe older brothers mentored young Fred in the game and fostered a competitive spirit; they even taught him to hit left-handed to reach first base quicker. A catcher until he was 15, Hutchinson starred as a right-handed pitcher, catcher, first baseman, outfielder, and left-handed hitter at Franklin. He led the Quakers to four city championships and played American Legion ball in the summer.\n\nHutchinson, known throughout baseball as \"Hutch\", played semi-pro ball in 1937 in Yakima, attended UW briefly, then entered the organized baseball ranks in 1938 with the unaffiliated Seattle Rainiers of the AA Pacific Coast League. He caused an immediate sensation at age 19, winning a league-best 25 games and that season's minor league player of the year award as bestowed by \"The Sporting News\".\n\nSeveral teams were interested in him, including the Pittsburgh Pirates. After his contract was purchased by the Detroit Tigers of the American League for players and cash, Hutchinson struggled in his early major league career with a 6–13 record and an earned-run average of 5.43 during the 1939–1941 seasons. His ineffectiveness caused his return to the minor leagues in each season. In 1941, at Buffalo of the AA International League, he enjoyed another stellar campaign, leading the league in victories (26) and innings pitched (284). A successful Major League career seemed to await Hutchinson, then 22, when the U.S. entered World War II. He saw active duty in the U.S. Navy, rose to the rank of lieutenant commander, and lost four full seasons (1942–1945) to military service.\n\nIn 1946, Hutchinson – approaching 27 – returned to baseball with a vengeance, winning a place in the defending World Series champion Tigers' starting rotation and beginning a string of six straight campaigns of 10 or more wins, including seasons of 18 (1947) and 17 victories (1950). He was selected to the 1951 American League All-Star team, and pitched three innings in an 8–3 loss at the Tigers' home park, Briggs Stadium.\n\nIn 11 major league seasons, Hutchinson compiled a 95–71 () career record and a 3.73 earned run average, all with Detroit – a stellar mark considering his early-career mishaps. Appearing in 242 games, 169 as a starting pitcher, and 1,464 innings pitched, he allowed 1,487 hits and 388 bases on balls. He amassed 591 strikeouts, 81 complete games, and 13 shutouts, along with seven saves. He led the American League in WHIP in , a season in which Hutchinson's 2.96 ERA was fourth in the league.\n\nThe , Hutchinson was known as a ferocious competitor. \"His displays of temper became legendary in the American League\", wrote \"Sports Illustrated\" in 1957. \"'I always know how Hutch did when we follow Detroit into a town,' cracked Yankee catcher Yogi Berra. 'If we got stools in the dressing room, I know he won. If we got kindling, he lost.'\"\n\nHe also was one of the best-hitting pitchers of his time; a left-handed batter, he frequently pinch-hit and batted over .300 four times during his major league career. His career batting average was .263, with 171 hits, four home runs and 83 runs batted in — excellent totals for a pitcher.\n\nOn a dubious note, he is also recalled as the pitcher who gave up the longest homer in Ted Williams' career, a blast on June 9, 1946, that broke the straw hat of a startled fan sitting in Fenway Park's right-center-field bleachers. The seat where the home run landed has been painted red since to mark the long ball. Hutchinson led the AL in home runs allowed with 32 during the season.\n\nA slow decline in Hutchinson's pitching career coincided with an alarming drop in the fortunes of his usually contending Tigers. On July 5, 1952, with Detroit in the surprising position of last place in the eight-team American League, the club fired manager Red Rolfe and handed the job to Hutchinson, still an active player and five weeks shy of his 33rd birthday. Hutchinson was chosen based on his leadership skills; he had been the AL's Player Representative since 1947. Hutchinson managed the Tigers for the next 2½ years, serving into 1953 as a playing manager. He guided them from their eighth-place finish in 1952 to sixth and fifth place during the next two seasons. His reign included the debut of future Baseball Hall of Fame outfielder Al Kaline. However, Detroit's ownership and front office were in flux; at the end of 1954, Hutchinson asked for a two-year contract, through 1956, and was only offered a single season deal. He left the Tigers, ending a 16-year association with the team.\n\nOut of the majors for the first time since , Hutchinson went home to Seattle and the Rainiers of the PCL, becoming their manager in 1955. Even though the club did not enjoy a major league affiliation, Hutchinson led Seattle to a 95–77 record and a first-place finish. His success led to his second major league managerial job when he replaced Harry Walker as skipper of the St. Louis Cardinals shortly after the 1955 season.\n\nThe Cardinals, one of baseball's storied franchises, had fallen into the second division. With general manager \"Frantic\" Frank Lane constantly revamping the roster through trades and Hutchinson's steady hand at the helm, the Cardinals improved by eight games in 1956, and catapulted to second place in the National League in 1957, behind only the eventual world champion Milwaukee Braves. \n\nHutchinson won \"The Sporting News\" Manager of the Year Award, and his popularity in the Mound City resulted in a new nickname, \"The Big Bear\", bestowed by Cardinal broadcaster Joe Garagiola. Hutchinson's typical unsmiling expression also led Garagiola to joke that Hutchinson was \"a happy guy inside, only his face didn't show it.\" He was given a raise in his one-year contract for the next season, however, Lane's departure from the front office and the Cardinals' disappointing season resulted in Hutchinson's dismissal; it came on September 17, with the team six games below .500 and in fifth place. Lane's successor, Bing Devine, strongly recommended retaining Hutchinson, but he was overruled by the Cardinals' owner, August A. Busch Jr.\n\nOnce again, Hutchinson returned to Seattle as field manager of the Rainiers, this time also serving as the club's general manager. The 1959 team did not have the on-field success of 1955's edition but the Rainiers were by then the top farm club of the Cincinnati Reds, who had stumbled badly in the National League standings coming out of the gate. On July 9, 1959, with the Reds 10 games under .500 at the All-Star break, Hutchinson was called to Cincinnati to take over the club, replacing Mayo Smith. Under Hutchinson, Cincinnati went 39–35 and improved two notches in the standings, but the following season saw the Reds struggle again to a 67–87 record and sixth-place finish. Like Detroit and St. Louis before, the Reds also were in front office turmoil, as the general manager who originally hired Hutchinson, Gabe Paul, departed for the expansion Houston Colt .45s and was replaced by Bill DeWitt. The sudden death of longtime owner Powel Crosley less than three weeks before the start of the 1961 regular season meant the team would soon be sold.\n\nAs a result, 1961 was a crucial season for Hutchinson. The Reds were projected as a second division team, lagging well behind the defending world champion Pittsburgh Pirates, the 1959 champion Los Angeles Dodgers, and strong San Francisco Giants, St. Louis Cardinals, and Milwaukee Braves outfits. But the Reds stunned the league, led by NL MVP Frank Robinson. They were buoyed by three other factors: the maturation of young players such as outfielder Vada Pinson and pitchers Jim O'Toole, Ken Hunt and Jim Maloney; the acquisition of key contributors such as pitcher Joey Jay (who became a 20-game winner) and third baseman Gene Freese; and surprise slugging and clutch hitting performances by first baseman Gordy Coleman, Jerry Lynch (one of the greatest pinchhitters in baseball history), and veteran Wally Post. The Reds surged into contention with a nine-game winning streak in May, and took first place for good August 16 when they swept the Dodgers in a doubleheader in Los Angeles.\n\nThe season was marked by numerous dramatic late-inning comeback victories, overcoming large margins, sometimes in a single inning. The Reds seemed never to be out of any game, until the last out. The Reds won 93 games and their first NL pennant since 1940. It was Hutchinson's second trip to the World Series; ironically, he was a Detroit pitcher in 1940 when his Tigers lost the Fall Classic to Cincinnati in seven games. However, the 1961 Reds drew one of the best teams of its era as its World Series foe: the New York Yankees of Roger Maris, Mickey Mantle, Whitey Ford, et al., who had won 109 games. The Reds could muster only one victory, in Game 2, with utility infielder Elio Chacón racing home on a passed ball with the go-ahead run, barely before the crunching body tag of Elston Howard. Cincinnati lost the 1961 Series in five games.\n\nWinning the 1961 pennant secured Hutchinson's place in Cincinnati. In 1962, his Reds won 98 games but finished third, 3½ games behind the Giants. While the team fell to fifth in 1963, with an 86–76 mark, it continued to blend in young talent, such as young shortstop Leo Cárdenas and freshman second baseman Pete Rose, who was named the National League's Rookie of the Year. In July, Hutchinson was given a contract extension through the 1965 season, and with a solid corps of veterans and a strong farm system, the Reds were considered a contending club in 1964, provided that its pitching staff made a comeback.\n\nAt his Florida home on Anna Maria Island, Hutchinson found a lump on his neck in late December 1963 and a medical examination in Seattle revealed malignant tumors in his lungs, chest, and neck. Given the cancer treatments available at the time, the prognosis was grim. According to his brother, Hutchinson was a chain smoker, up to four packs of cigarettes a day. The Reds made their manager's illness public on January 3, 1964. After radiation treatment in early February, he still felt relatively well in March during spring training. As \"The Sporting News\" noted, the team played the 1964 season with the terrible knowledge that Hutchinson \"probably was at death's door.\"\n\nHis health failing, Hutchinson nevertheless managed the Reds through July 27, when he was hospitalized. He returned to the dugout August 4, but could only endure nine more days before, on the day after his 45th birthday, he turned the team over to his first-base coach, Dick Sisler. The birthday was celebrated at Crosley Field on August 12, then he was re-hospitalized two days later for two weeks. With their manager now critically ill, the inspired Reds caught fire and won 29 out of their last 47 games as the first-place Philadelphia Phillies collapsed, but the team finished in a tie with the Phillies for second, one game behind the Cardinals, who went on to win that year's World Series.\n\nHutchinson formally resigned as manager on October 19, and died three weeks later at Manatee Memorial Hospital in Bradenton, Florida. He was buried next to his parents in the family plot at Mount Olivet Cemetery near Seattle in Renton, overlooking Lake Washington.\n\n\"SPORT\" magazine posthumously named him \"Man of the Year\" for 1964 in tribute to his courage in battling his final illness and the Reds permanently retired his uniform number (1). The Hutch Award is given annually by Major League Baseball in his memory as well.\n\nHutchinson was inducted into the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame in 1965. His career record as a major league manager, in all or parts of 12 seasons, was 830–827 () with nine tie games. He was remembered for his winning baseball teams, as the man who launched Cincinnati into an historic winning era (which ended years after his death with the \"Big Red Machine\" in the 1970s). He is described favorably by pitcher/author Jim Brosnan in his two memoirs, \"The Long Season\" (an account of Brosnan's 1959 season) and \"Pennant Race\" (about the 1961 campaign). Brosnan describes the team's wariness of the manager's hot temper and its respect for his competitive nature and leadership skills, and notes Hutchinson's sense of humor as well.\n\nWrote Brosnan in 1959: \"Most ballplayers respect Hutch. In fact, many of them admire him, which is even better than liking him. He seems to have a tremendous inner power that a player can sense. When Hutch gets a grip on things it doesn't seem probable that he's going to lose it. He seldom blows his top at a player, seldom panics in a game, usually lets the players work out of their own troubles if possible.\"\n\nSaid future Hall of Famer Stan Musial in 1957: \"If I ever hear a player say he can't play for Hutch, then I'll know he can't play for anybody.\" Jim Delsing played under Hutchinson with the Tigers. \"I would describe him as very sincere, very frank, very loyal to the players, and very involved with the players. I think everybody really liked playing for him. Hutch was not rehired after the 1954 season, and the next year we played for Bucky Harris. Fred was always more involved with the players. I thought he was an excellent manager. The manager makes a lot of difference.\"\n\nIn honor of his achievements with Buffalo, Hutchinson became a charter member of the Buffalo Baseball Hall of Fame in 1985.\n\nOn December 24, 1999, the \"Seattle Post-Intelligencer\" named Hutchinson Seattle's Athlete of the 20th Century.\n\nMeanwhile, the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center continues to make news as a cancer treatment hub — in medical and baseball circles. When Boston Red Sox rookie left-handed pitcher Jon Lester, a Washington native, was diagnosed with anaplastic large cell lymphoma during the season, he chose to undergo chemotherapy at the Seattle facility. Coming full circle, on November 11, 2008, Lester — a 16-game winner and postseason pitching star — was chosen as the winner of the 2008 Hutch Award.\n\nAll of the end plates of the rows of seats at Seattle's T-Mobile Park are embossed with a likeness of Hutchinson.\n\n\n"}

After Peter's defeat and death in the battle of Alfarrobeira (1449), he accompanied his master into exile. In 1458 he fought on the side of Afonso V in the conquest of Alcácer-Ceguer in Morocco. He received several honours and became a counselor of the king. During the War of the Castilian Succession, he participated in the recapture of the town of Alegrete from the Castilians. He was injured in the leg during this engagement.\n\nIn 1481 he was appointed by John II as captain of a fleet consisting of nine caravels and two ships with 600 soldiers and 100 masons and carpenters. They were sent, along with the necessary stone and other materials, to construct a fortress called São Jorge da Mina at the Gulf of Guinea in the Portuguese Gold Coast colony. This became the best-known exploit of his long life. They chose a favourable defensive position for the fort, and construction was practically complete after only 20 days, in spite of resistance from the native population.\n\nWith the fortress finished, contacts were established with the local population to establish trade. Diogo de Azambuja sent the fleet back to Lisbon with word that the mission has been successfully accomplished, and he remained behind as captain of the fortress with a force of 60 soldiers. He held this post until 1484. The fortress is now known as \"Elmina Castle\", or the \"Elmina Slave Castle\".\n\nHe was rewarded by the king with the post of alcaide-mor of Monsaraz, and was also named to the Privy Council. Diogo de Azambuja remained attached to the Court and the king's service for many years, in spite of his advancing age and disabled leg. He was already over the age of 70 in 1506 when Manuel I placed him in charge of building a fortress called Castelo Real at Essaouira, near Safi, in the south of Morocco, to protect Portuguese interests in the area. Diogo of Azambuja not only carried out the mission, he also took the city of Safi, where he remained as captain until 1509, at the age of 77 years. At that time he finally returned to Portugal, where he died in 1518.\n"}

Zumba was a slave who escaped bondage on a sugar plantation and eventually rose to the position of highest authority within the kingdom of Palmares, and the corresponding title of \"Ganga Zumba\". Although some Portuguese documents regard Ganga Zumba as his proper name, and this name is widely used today, the most important of the documents translates the name as \"Great Lord.\" In Kikongo , \"nganga a nzumbi\" was \"the priest responsible for the spiritual defense of the community\" which was a \"kilombo\" or military settlement made up multiple groups. A letter written to him by the governor of Pernambuco in 1678 and now found in the Archives of the University of Coimbra, calls him \"Ganazumba,\" which is a better translation of \"Great Lord\" (in Kimbundu).\n\nGanga is said to have been the son of princess Aqualtune, daughter of an unknown king of Kongo. She led a battalion at the Battle of Mbwila. The Portuguese won the battle, eventually killing 5,000 men and capturing the king, his two sons, his two nephews, four governors, various court officials, 95 title holders and 400 other nobles, who were put on ships and sold as slaves in the Americas. It's likely that Ganga was among these captives. The whereabouts of the rest of them is unknown. Some are believed to have been sent to Spanish America, but Ganga Zumba, his Brother Zona and his sister Sabina (mother of Zumbi dos Palmares, his nephew and successor) were made slaves at the plantation of Santa Rita in the Portuguese Captaincy of Pernambuco in what is now northeast Brazil, which at the time was controlled by the Dutch. From there they escaped to Palmares.\n\nA \"quilombo\" or \"mocambo\" was a refuge of runaway slaves who were forcibly brought to Brazil (from present-day Angola, Democratic Republic of Congo, and Congo-Brazzaville) that escaped their bondage and fled into the interior of Brazil to the mountainous region of Pernambuco. As their numbers increased, they formed maroon settlements.\n\nGradually as many as ten separate mocambos had formed and ultimately coalesced into a confederation called the Quilombo of Palmares, or Angola Janga, under a king, Ganga Zumba or Ganazumba, who may have been elected by the leaders of the constituent mocambos. Ganga Zumba, who ruled the biggest of the villages, Cerro dos Macacos, presided the mocambo's chief council and was considered the King of Palmares. The nine other settlements were headed by brothers, sons, or nephews of Gunga Zumba. Zumbi was chief of one community and his brother, Andalaquituche, headed another.\n\nBy the 1670s, Ganga Zumba had a palace, three wives, guards, ministers, and devoted subjects at his royal compound called \"Macaco\". \"Macaco\" comes from the name of an animal (monkey) that was killed on the site. The compound consisted of 1,500 houses which housed his family, guards, and officials, all of which were considered royalty. He was given the respect of a Monarch and the honor of a Lord.\n\nIn 1678 Zumba accepted a peace treaty offered by the Portuguese Governor of Pernambuco, which required that the Palmarinos relocate to Cucaú Valley. The treaty was challenged by Zumbi, one of Ganga Zumba's nephews, who led a revolt against him. In the confusion that followed, Ganga Zumba was poisoned, most likely by one of his own relatives for entering into a treaty with the Portuguese. And many of his followers who had moved to the Cucaú Valley were re-enslaved by the Portuguese. Resistance to the Portuguese then continued under Zumbi.\n\nThe Brazilian film \"Ganga Zumba\" was made in 1963 but was not released until 1972 because there was a military coup in Brazil in 1964, and films about revolutions, even those taking place in the 17th century, were considered politically dangerous. The film is based on João Felício dos Santo's novel, and focuses on a black slave who ends up in Palmares. The film is about black liberation and keeps a black racial perspective.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2037826", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2037826", "title": "Communist Party of Norway", "text": "Communist Party of Norway\n\nThe Communist Party of Norway () is a small Marxist–Leninist communist party in Norway.\n\nIt was formed in 1923, following a split in the Norwegian Labour Party. The party was pro-Stalinist from its establishment and as such supported the Soviet Union and its government, while opposing Trotskyism. Although in the 1950s, the party formally denounced Stalinism and kept itself only to Marx and Lenin. During the Second World War, the party initially opposed active resistance, due to the non-aggression pact between the Soviet Union and Germany. After Germany terminated the pact and entered into war with the Soviet Union, the Communist Party of Norway engaged in resistance to the German occupation, and the party experienced a brief period of political popularity in some segments of society in the years immediately after the war. The popular support quickly waned with the onset of the Cold War, and the Labour Party took a harsh line against the communists, culminating in Prime Minister Einar Gerhardsen's Kråkerøy speech in 1948, in which he condemned the Communist Party.\n\nSince the late 1940s, the party has played a mostly marginal role in Norwegian politics. While it held a single seat in the parliament as late as 1961, it has not been represented in any elected bodies in the last decades, receiving only a few hundred votes in elections. The party supports traditional Soviet historiography and pro-Russian political views, and opposes NATO, the European Union and the United States. During the Cold War, the party was officially considered extremist by Norwegian authorities and was under extensive surveillance by the Police Surveillance Agency for the entire Cold War.\n\nThe Norwegian Labour Party (DNA) became a member of the Communist International (Comintern) in 1919 under the leadership of Martin Tranmæl. While Tranmæl at first supported the move of becoming a Comintern member, he became increasingly skeptical of it after the proclamation of the twenty-one conditions which stated that members had to enforce democratic centralism and party discipline. Even so, Tranmæl continued to support the Labour Party's membership, even if that meant a future split within the party between the left and the right. A split occurred, based on factional lines, in 1921 and led to the establishment of the Social Democratic Labour Party. A power struggle soon erupted between the Tranmælists and the supporters of Olav Scheflo, the party's parliamentary leader, following Kyrre Grepp's sickness leave and later death in 1922. The reason for the struggle was that Tranmæl wanted to block Grepp's chance of becoming the party's next leader; Grepp was a supporter of the Comintern-line.\n\nBy the time of the 4th World Congress of the Comintern, in which a policy of strengthening the apparatus of the member parties took place, Tranmæl had enough of what he saw as the Comintern's meddling in the internal affairs of the Labour Party. He managed to get a majority within the Central Board for a withdrawal of its Comintern membership, but the Comintern's representative, Karl Radek, managed, with a bit of maneuvering, to get the majority of the party's National Board to vote in favour of retaining its Comintern membership. Before the Labour Party conference in February 1921, Tranmæl came up with the Kristiania-proposal, a declaration of semi-independence from Comintern. The Kristiania-proposal supported retaining membership in the Comintern, if the Labour Party could operate on more independent lines. At the conference a majority, by a margin of two votes, voted in favour of the Kristiania-proposal. The Comintern representative at the party conference, Nikolai Bukharin, grudgingly accepted the vote. The power struggle between the Tranmælists and the Scheflo-wing continued, even more aggressively, until the extraordinary party conference of November 1923 which voted in favour of withdrawing the Labour Party from the Comintern. As a reaction, the Scheflo-wing left the party and established the Norwegian Communist Party. Organisationally, the Communist Party continued the representation of Norway in the Comintern.\n\n13 of the Labour members of parliament joined the Communist Party, as did large parts of the trade union opposition to the Labour Party. The newly established party elected Sverre Støstad as chairman, Halvard Olsen as deputy chairman, and Peder Furubotn as general secretary. The party managed to gain 6.1 percent of the votes in the 1924 parliamentary election, but decreased to 4 percent in 1927, and decreased further in 1930 to 1.7 percent of the votes. At the same time, its membership slowly decreased, and by the 1930s the party had lost much of its former influence.\n\nThe 1924 election was a failure for the party; the party became the third largest left-wing party, behind the Labour Party and the Social Democratic Labour Party. The Communist Party had failed to restrengthened the Comintern organisation in Norway after the 1923-split. The 1925 conference focused on the party's organisational structure; the Comintern had laid out the party's organisational structure. The structure proposed by the Comintern was duly accepted by a majority at the conference.\n\nParallel to its decreasing electoral influence, the party was ravaged by internal strifes. Halvard Olsen and other trade union leaders left the party in 1924, in protest over the trade union policy of the Communist Party. Sverre Støstad, Fredrik Monsen, and Olav Larssen were excluded from the party in 1927 because of disagreements surrounding the reunification of Labour Party (which merged with the Social Democratic Labour Party). Jeanette Olsen, Emil Stang, Jr., and Scheflo left the party in 1928, as they were disappointed with how the Communist Party reacted towards the first DNA government, Hornsrud's Cabinet. In 1927 the Mot Dag-group, a circle of leftwing intellectuals, joined the party. They would leave the following year, as the Communist Party took an 'ultra-left turn'.\n\nThe Comintern demanded in the summer of 1927 that the Communist Party move further to the left. The move to the left was characterised by a more open \"class against class politics, in which the social democrats were designated as the primary enemy\" of communism. At the 9th Plenum of the Central Committee in 1928, they denounced the right-wing faction for supporting the Labour government of Christopher Hornsrud. The 9th Plenum led to a further reduction of party members, but Furobotn and the Communist Party continued to be loyal to the line set by the Comintern. There was no significant dissent within the party against the Comintern line, and the party became vehemently loyal to it; it began to accuse the Labour Party of being social fascist, and further claimed that the Labour Party had stopped being a workers party. This policy led to further marginalisation of the Communist Party by the 1930s. In 1930 the Comintern directly interfered into the affairs of the Communist Party, when it ordered Furubotn, the party chairman, to visit the Soviet Union. In 1933 the party took the initiative to propose a collaboration with the Labour in the 1933 parliamentary election in correlation with the Comintern's policy of a Popular Front. The proposal was rejected, but the Communist Party continued to propose a collaboration of sorts to the Labour Party in 1935, 1936, and in 1937. The Labour Party continued to be interested in such a proposal as long as the Communist Party and itself were unified organisationally. From 1938 onwords, the party's relations with other parties reached an all-time low, and by the time of the German invasion of Norway in 1940, the party was in a crisis. The Norwegian public had begun to see the Communist Party as a tool controlled by Moscow.\n\nAt the onset of the Second World War, NKP subscribed to the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact between Germany and the Soviet Union. The DNA government, on the other hand, aligned with the United Kingdom. During the Finnish Winter War, NKP supported the Soviet war effort, whereas DNA supported the opposing side. DNA-NKP relations deteriorated further, reaching a historic low.\n\nGermany invaded Norway on 9 April 1940. The NKP publication \"Arbeideren\" (\"The Worker\") proclaimed that the war was an imperialist war, and that Germany and the Western powers were equally responsible for its outbreak. According to that analysis the party should not take sides for one of the imperialist powers, a policy that was in clear opposition of the (then exiled) DNA government.\n\nHowever, locally NKP cells in northern Norway began (without the consent of the party leadership) to mobilize resistance activities.\n\nIn August 1940, NKP was the first Norwegian political party to be banned by the German occupation authorities. The publication of \"Arbeideren\" ceased. The party then went underground. However, the party was poorly prepared for underground functioning.\n\nIn the ongoing confusion within the party, Furubotn began to call for more active resistance by NKP against the occupation. Furubotn had spent several years in Moscow, but had returned to Norway just before the war. Now he was the leader of the party in Vestlandet. On 31 December 1941, the party held a clandestine national conference, which adopted Furubotn's 'active war politics'.\n\nNKP came to play a leading role in the resistance movement, organizing sabotage and guerrilla activities. However, although different sectors of the resistance showed a united front towards the occupants, the relation between NKP and the Home Front, the government-in-exile, and the clandestine trade union movement were not always smooth as the government only proposed peaceful resistance, like newspapers and intelligence support towards the allies, until the last years of the war, when these elements of resistance were to join actively. Generally, NKP wanted to adopt more offensive tactics against the occupants. It also created an illegal newspaper, \"Friheten\", or \"Liberty\", which is still in print.\n\nAfter the war, NKP enjoyed a strong boost of popularity for its role in resistance struggle. The role the Soviet Union had played in defeating Germany, and in particular the Soviet liberation of Finnmark in northern Norway, also contributed to the popularity of the party.\n\nIn the national unity government formed after the war, two communists were included: Johan Strand Johansen and Kirsten Hansteen. Hansteen was the first female minister in Norwegian history. The party organ, \"Friheten\", would reach a readership of approximately 100,000 directly after the war. In the new postwar atmosphere of tolerance, discussions were raised over a possible reunification between DNA and NKP. During the war, discussions had taken place in the Grini concentration camp between captured DNA and NKP leaders (including Einar Gerhardsen from DNA and Jørgen Vogt from NKP). However, these plans were discarded by Furubotn.\n\nIn the 1945 parliamentary election the NKP vote-share reached its historical peak. NKP received 176,535 votes (11.89%) and eleven seats in the Storting. In 1946 Furubotn was elected general secretary of NKP.\n\nHowever, the growth of the party proved to be brief. The Cold War began, and the Norwegian government aligned itself with the Western powers. In the 1949 parliamentary election NKP lost many voters. The party received 102,722 votes (5.83%).\n\nThe reason for the party's decline in popularity is often accredited to Labour Party Prime Minister Einar Gerhardsen's famous speech at Kråkerøy in 1948, four days after the communist takeover in Czechoslovakia. In it, he condemned the actions in Czechoslovakia, but also warned that the same thing could happen in Norway if the Communist Party was given too much power. The speech represented the start of both an open and underground campaign against the party and its members, with the purpose of scaring away voters, and reducing its influence in the labour movement.\n\nAt the same time the party would experience its most traumatic internal division. In 1946 some of Furubotn’s closest associates during the war, Kjell G. Kviberg and Ørnulf Egge, were expelled. In 1949 Furubotn's enemies within the party began a campaign to expel him.\n\nOn 24 October 1949, MP Johan Strand Johansen publicly declared that a division existed within the party in a speech to the local party unit in Malerne. The following day Furubotn’s followers resigned from their positions in the party. On 26 October Furubotn and his followers in the party were expelled. The editorial of \"Friheten\" on 27 October proclaimed that \"It has emerged clearly that this anti-party centre is a Trotskyist, bourgeois nationalist and Titoist centre, which has paralysed the central board with endless and futile discussions.\" Moreover, in an article in the same newspaper published on 11 November 1949, read that: \"It is clear that within our party there are nationalist, petty bourgeois, Trotskyist, Titoist elements, enemies of the Soviet Union and socialism, that may form a base for recruitment of agents to the bourgeois states and the counter revolution.\" This process contributed to the ongoing political isolation of NKP. The expulsion of Furubotn, considered as a hero of the resistance struggle, was in many ways a political suicide. The way the expulsions had taken place, and the strong language used in the NKP press against the expellees, contributed to giving an image of NKP as a 'conspirational' party.\n\nThe NKP was broadly considered to be a loyal follower of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, although it occasionally took independent positions opposing the Soviet line. This happened in 1968, when NKP condemned the Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia. The youth league, Young Communist League of Norway (NKU), used to follow a somewhat more independent line than the party.\n\nIn the mid-1960s the U.S. State Department estimated the party membership to be approximately 4500 (0.2% of the working age population of the country).\n\nIn the parliamentary elections of 1973, the party participated in an electoral alliance with the Socialist People's Party and other left-wing groups, known as the \"Socialist Electoral League\", and had its leader, Reidar Larsen, elected into parliament. In 1975, the Socialist Electoral League became the Socialist Left Party, which is today Norway's largest left-wing party to the left of the Norwegian Labour Party. The Communist Party took part in the process of transforming the electoral league to a new party, but in the end decided to remain a separate party after all. At the party congress in 1975 113 delegates voted to keep the party as an independent party, whereas 30 voted for merging it into SV. Larsen did not stand for re-election, and Martin Gunnar Knutsen was elected as the new party chairman. After the congress, Larsen and others left NKP to join the Socialist Left Party.\n\nAfter Mikhail Gorbachev gained power in the Soviet Union and started his reform program, NKP, as most other European Communist parties did, started revising its views of past Soviet policies. The party started distancing itself from the practises of the Soviet Union, and focused on a \"softer\" communism. The term \"democratic socialism\" is frequently found in party literature from the early 1990s onward.\n\nAround 1990 there were also tendencies within NKP working for regroupment. In the 1989 parliamentary election they joined forces with Workers' Communist Party (AKP), Red Electoral Alliance (RV), and independent socialist to form \"Fylkeslistene for miljø og solidaritet\" (County lists for Environment and Solidarity). NKP also had joint lists with RV some places in the early 1990s, while at other places members of NKP campaigned for RV. This policy of unity was, however, abandoned around the mid-1990s.\n\nA defining moment in this process came when the party opposed the Soviet coup attempt of 1991 against Gorbachev by the \"old guard\" of the Soviet communist party.\n\nToday, the party's statement of principles explicitly acknowledges that the Soviet Union represented a violation of democratic principles and that the party has to take responsibility for its lack of criticism of these problems. The party does however still view these countries as examples of socialism and progress over the respective countries' preceding regimes.\n\nEven though NKP did survive the collapse of the Soviet Union, inner turmoil, and particularly lack of recruitment amongst youth has since marginalized the party further.\n\nIn the early 1990s the party attempted to counteract some of this by electing younger leaders to the party's top positions. However, this move failed to boost recruiting much, and subsequently the party's leadership was again dominated by older members, many of whom joined during the Soviet era.\nNKP won three elected posts in the 2003 municipal elections, two seats in the municipal council in Åsnes and one in Vadsø. The Åsnes branch, by far the party's strongest at that time, left the party in 2004 to form Radical Socialists due to disagreements over the questions of religion, Joseph Stalin, and cooperation with other leftist groups. In addition, an NKP member was a member of the Porsgrunn municipal council, elected on the RV-list until he joined RV. In later elections NKP has received about 1,000 votes. In the 2005 parliamentary election, it won 1,070 votes - 0.04% of the national total. In 2007, it could not find enough candidates for a list in Vadsø, and thus does not currently have any democratically elected representatives.\n\nIn 2006-2008 NKP's youth league was changed from the old Young Communist League of Norway, to the new Young Communist League in Norway. The new league changed its name in 2008 to the Youth Communists in Norway.\n\nThe party still publishes a weekly paper called \"Friheten\" (\"The Freedom\"), which was started as a clandestine paper in 1941.\n\nThe party won control of eleven of the Labour Party newspapers. These were (some with new names after the communist takeover): \"Arbeidet\", \"Ny Tid\", \"Arbeideren\", \"Vestfold Arbeiderblad\", \"Glomdalens Arbeiderblad\", \"Bratsberg-Demokraten\", \"Fritt Folk\", \"Follo Arbeiderblad\", \"Gudbrandsdalens Arbeiderblad\", \"Hardanger Arbeiderblad\" and \"Ny Dag\". The communist party also usurped \"Møre Arbeiderblad\", which had not yet achieved official Labour Party status. \"Nordlys\" was acquired, temporarily lost in mid-November 1923, then published as communist again until 20 January 1924 when it again became aligned with Labour. Some newspapers, such as \"Østerdalens Arbeiderblad\" had sympathized with the communist opposition while it was a part of the Labour Party, but after the actual split the Labour Party managed to turn the tide and retain them. The Communist Party also took over the ideological publication \"Klassekampen\" (belonged to the Young Communist League of Norway) and started \"Gnisten\" and \"Proletaren\". Newly established communist newspapers within the party's first year of existence were the main organ \"Norges Kommunistblad\" as well as \"Akershus Folkeblad\", \"Buskerud-Arbeideren\", \"Friheten\", \"Troms Fylkes Kommunistblad\", \"Dagens Nyheter\" and \"Finnmark Fremtid\". Many became defunct after a short time.\n\nThe Communist Party also had a range of company newspapers, for laborers in specific companies or specific industries. In Oslo there were \"Arbeidersken\", \"Brygger'n\", \"Den unge arbeider\", \"Hammer'n\", \"Huken\", \"Kommunarden\", \"Nødsarbeideren\" (renamed \"Steinspruten\"), \"Skyttelen\", \"Sporvekselen\" and \"Stemplet\". In Bergen there were \"Byggeren\", \"Hermetikboksen\", \"Kommuneproletaren\" and \"Transportproletaren\" (renamed \"Havnearbeideren\"). In Trondheim there were \"Filkloa\" and \"Signal\". Einhart Lorenz has also registered seventeen other company newspapers from across the country. Nearly all were founded in 1925 or 1926, and nearly all went defunct between 1925 and 1928. The only exception as to foundation was \"Verksteds-Arbeideren\", founded in Drammen in 1924, and the only newspaper which survived beyond 1928 was \"Kommuneproletaren\", which existed until 1931.\n\n\nCurrently, the party retains its strongest bases of support in Oslo, Finnmark, Troms, Tromsø, and Namsos. Historically Åsnes and Trondheim were strongholds of the party.\n\nNotes:\n\n"}

It is directed by Simon Wincer from a screenplay by Don Michael Paul. The film provides a notable example of the \"biker\" stereotype. Four characters in the film are named after different brands and manufacturers; Rourke's character is named after the motorcycle manufacturer Harley-Davidson, Field's character is named after the cigarette brand Virginia Slims, Big John Studd's character is named after the whiskey brand Jack Daniel's and Eloy Casados's character is named after the tequilla brand Jose Cuervo. Johnson's character is the Marlboro Man, who appeared in commercials advertising Marlboro cigarettes from 1954 to 1999.\n\nThe film was a critical and financial failure, earning only $7 million at the domestic box office (the budget was estimated at $23 million). It has since become a cult classic following its release to video.\n\nIn the near future, Harley Davidson (Mickey Rourke) travels from Texas to Burbank, California to reconnect with his old friend Robert Lee \"Marlboro Man\" Edison (Don Johnson) at their old haunt; Rock N' Roll Bar & Grille. Their mutual friend Jack Daniels (Big John Studd) holds animosity towards Harley over an affair he and his now-wife Lulu (Vanessa Williams) had years prior. The bar has fallen on hard times, and the Great Trust bank has threatened foreclosure, planning to demolish the building to make way for a skyscraper. Harley and Robert convince Jack to help them rob one of the Bank's armoured cars in order to collect the funds necessary to renew the building's lease. The robbery mostly goes off without a hitch, but the trio are intercepted by a group of security agents who almost foil their getaway. Upon escaping, they discover the loot they stole from the van contains not money, but a new, experimental street drug called \"Crystal Dream.\"\n\nThe bank's head of security Alexander (Daniel Baldwin) is ordered by CEO Chance Wilder (Tom Sizemore) to recover the stolen drugs and kill the thieves. Meanwhile, Robert is pulled over for speeding by a motorcycle cop; his ex-lover Virginia Slim (Chelsea Field). The two spend the night together, during which Robert learns that she's engaged. Harley takes Virginia to breakfast the next morning, during which she tells him that Crystal Dream is 100% addictive and causes lasting neurological damage and, eventually, death. Robert, fuming about Virginia's upcoming marriage, steals her fiancé's motorcycle. He and Harley go to the bank's headquarters and talk to Wilder via telephone. They demand $2.5 million in exchange for the drugs. Wilder agrees to have someone meet them that night in the airplane graveyard for the exchange. Alexander shows up with the money and the transfer goes off without any problems. That night, while they hang out in the bar's back room celebrating, Marlboro is suspicious of the ease of the exchange. Suddenly, Alexander and his men show up. Watching through a one-way mirror, the owner (Julius Harris) tries to convince them that the gang isn't there. Alexander appears to walk away as if to leave and suddenly turns around and shoots him. They open fire on the room behind the mirror; Harley and Marlboro are the only ones who escape alive as the others are cut down in brutal fashion.\n\nThe two retreat to the nearby airport and hide in the baggage compartment of a plane. One of the agents nearly finds them but they escape to Las Vegas, where they check into a hotel, only to be tracked down by Alexander. The two escape to the hotel's roof and jump off into the swimming pool. Harley finds out that they've been tracked with a device hidden in the dollar coin given to them by Alexander. The two hop a freight train headed east after deactivating the tracker, but Marlboro leaves after telling Harley that they owe it to the dead friends that helped them to go back to LA and settle things. Harley refuses to go and Marlboro jumps off the train. Harley has a change of heart, and catches up with Marlboro and they form a plan to meet with Alexander, reactivating the tracker in the coin. Alexander traces them to the airplane graveyard, finding the briefcase that contained the money but only finding the dollar coin inside. However, he sights Harley and Marlboro nearby and a gunfight ensues. Marlboro is able to kill both of Alexander's two remaining men, however, Alexander catches Marlboro and holds him hostage. Harley tries to shoot Alexander and misses, hitting Marlboro. Harley finally summons up the aim to hit Alexander and the two finally manage to kill him.\n\nThe duo bribe Alexander's helicopter pilot into taking them to Wilder's office. They give Wilder his money back and demand he change the lease on the bar. Wilder is unwilling to do so and orders his men to kill them when the pilot, paid off by Harley and Marlboro, appears hovering in his chopper outside. He opens fire on the office with the chopper's cannon, killing Wilder's thugs. Wilder insults Marlboro's dead father; Marlboro begins to beat him up until Wilder dangles out the window of his office, holding onto Marlboro's disintegrating cowboy boot. Harley helps him out, the boot comes apart and Wilder falls to the street.\n\nMarlboro and Harley part ways at a rodeo, where Marlboro is riding a bull. As Harley rides away, he picks up a beautiful female hitchhiker.\n\n\nOther songs in the film, but not included on the soundtrack are \"Stop the World\" by The Screaming Jets, \"Wanted Dead or Alive\" by Bon Jovi, and \"Work to Do\" and \"The Better Part of Me\" by Vanessa Williams.\n\nRotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 22% of 18 surveyed critics gave it a positive review; the average rating was 3.6/10. Kevin Thomas of the \"Los Angeles Times\" called it \"a mindless cobbling from countless buddy movies\". Owen Gleiberman of \"Entertainment Weekly\" rated it C+ and called it \"a kinetic formula shoot-'em-up\" that is \"engagingly junky entertainment with a healthy sense of its own ludicrousness.\" \"Variety\" called it \"a dopey, almost poignantly bad actioner about two legends-in-their-own-minds\". Vincent Canby of \"The New York Times\" wrote, \"Mr. Rourke and Mr. Johnson handle their roles with more ease and humor than can be accommodated by a movie so stuffed with mindless fistfights, gunfights, helicopter chases, explosions and leaps from tall buildings.\" \"Time Out London\" called it \"utter rubbish, and badly dressed at that.\" Kim Newman of \"Empire\" wrote, \"For a while, its crassness is amusing, but as the plot sets in, it gradually turns into a stultifying bore.\"\nJohnson and Rourke have spoken negatively of the film. Rourke cited the film as the beginning of his decline in mainstream Hollywood. Johnson, while promoting the film gave a tongue-in-cheek interview where he was quoted as saying “If you're a fan of mindless action. If you don’t have a single brain cell in your head, this is the film for you.”\n\nAudiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade of \"B\" on scale of A+ to F.\n\nThe film was nominated for Worst Picture at the 1991 Stinkers Bad Movie Awards.\n\n\"Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man\" was released to DVD by MGM Home Entertainment on February 23rd, 2001 as a Region 1 widescreen DVD and to Blu-Ray disc by Shout Factory (under license from MGM) on May 19th, 2015.\n\n\n"}

The film stars Jason Lee and Tom Green with Leslie Mann, Dennis Farina, Richard Jenkins, John C. McGinley, Tammy Blanchard, and Megan Mullally. It was released on September 13, 2002 by Sony Pictures Releasing under their Columbia Pictures label.\n\nJohn Plummer (Jason Lee) is engaged to Elaine Warner (Leslie Mann), and intends to use his life savings of $30,000 to put a down payment on a house. He works for Elaine's father, Mr. Warner (Dennis Farina), who dislikes John. Simultaneously, John's niece Noreen (Tammy Blanchard), daughter of sister Patty (Megan Mullally), is accepted to Harvard University, but needs an additional $30,000 on top of her grants and scholarships. Noreen shows John an old videotape where he promised to pay for Noreen's college. John now has a moral and financial dilemma – disappoint his fiancée or disappoint his niece and ruin her chance at escaping poverty.\n\nJohn confides in his friend Walter \"Duff\" Duffy (Tom Green), a landscaper. He convinces John to steal from one of his rich clients, who keeps large amounts of cash in an unlocked safe. The pair set off to steal the cash, but Duff runs away when lights come on in the home, leaving John to get caught by Emmett Cook (Richard Jenkins). Cook forces John to cross-dress and role-play the part of Cook's late wife as the two men lie in bed and \"spoon\". Eventually, after taking an incriminating photograph of John, Cook releases him. As he is leaving, Mr. Warner rides by and takes note of John's panicked behavior, believing that he has caught John in an affair.\n\nFurther capers ensue as John and Duff try to rob a liquor store and later attempt to con a drug lord out of $30,000 by concocting a phony story about running an ecstasy ring. A police detective (John C. McGinley) is on to John and Duff, but never has enough evidence to actually pin any of the crimes on them. Meanwhile, Mr. Warner breaks into Cook's residence in order to get evidence against John, and once Cook catches him, he is forced to \"spoon\" as well. Despite this, Warner finds a common ground with Cook as he is also widower though he doesn’t agree with Cook’s method of coping. Before leaving, Warner finds the photo of John from the album, which he then gives to Elaine.\n\nJohn is forced to confess everything to Elaine, who is not upset and admires the lengths he was willing to go to in order to please her and send his niece to Harvard. Elaine then confides in John that her father keeps a great deal of money at his business, and that it would be easy for them to steal it. John, Elaine, and Duff set out to rob the business in the night. Unfortunately, Mr. Warner had hid his dog Rex inside the vault. Rex latches on to Duff’s crotch, and oddly, enjoys it so much that he doesn’t let go. Just as John and Elaine find the money, Mr. Warner tries to attack them but he is caught by the detective who mistakes him for a burglar. While Duff is relentlessly pursued by Rex, John and Elaine escape to Duff's van. The police arrive and the gang unsuccessfully tries to get away. They are all taken into custody by the detective and facing a series of charges. John feels doomed, until the judge in charge of his arraignment turns out to be the gun-toting Emmett Cook.\n\nUpon their mutual recognition, John flashes a written message to Cook, threatening to expose the judge's fetish; upon reading the note, Cook quickly dismisses all charges against John. Finally, Duff comes through as best he can and gives John his life savings, $1,000, which John bets on a long-shot horse which wins and which paid 30 to 1. John and Elaine are married, Noreen goes off to college, and, in the final scene, John is left to ponder how Duff could possibly accumulate $1,000 – the last scene shows Duff offering to \"spoon\" with Cook for $1,000.\n\n\n\"Stealing Harvard\" received negative reviews from critics. It currently holds a 9% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 103 reviews with the consensus: \"There are some laughs in \"Stealing Harvard\", but they are few and far between, and Tom Green's antics grow old fast.\"\n\nReleased September 13, 2002 the film grossed US$14,036,406 at the U.S. box office.\n\nFor his performance in the film, Green was nominated for Worst Supporting Actor in the 2002 Golden Raspberry Awards. He also won Worst Actor at the 2002 Stinkers Bad Movie Awards.\n\n"}

It explores the subject of the intersection of social class and illicit sexual relations in late 19th-century Sweden.\n\nThe opera was commissioned by the New York City Opera, and had its first performance there on 4 November 1965, in its original two-hour, two-act version. The production was conducted by Robert Zeller and directed by Nikos Psacharopoulos, with scenic and lighting design by Will Steven Armstrong, costume design by Patton Campbell, and choreography by Thomas Andrew. The opera was not a critical success. \n\nRorem revised the score and shortened it to a single act in 1978; this version lasts 90 minutes and was first performed that same year by the New York Lyric Opera. The one-act version underwent further slight revisions and was produced again in 1994 by the Manhattan School of Music Opera Theatre. This version was praised by James Oestreich, music critic of \"The New York Times\", as \"taut and persuasive musical drama\". It was recorded and released on the Newport Classic label. Another recording, of a production on 7 November 2003 by the Curtis Opera Theatre, has been released on Albany Records.\n\nThe orchestra consists of: 2 flutes, 2 oboes, 2 clarinets, 2 bassoons, 3 horns, 2 trumpets, 2 trombones, timpani, 2 additional percussion players (xylophone, slapstick, gong, triangle, vibraphone, tambourine, cymbals, tenor drum, glockenspiel, castanets, chimes, suspended cymbal, bongos), guitar, harp, strings.\n\nMiss Julie, the jaded daughter of the Count, orders her fiancé Niels to kiss her boot. He breaks off their engagement in disgust. Later that evening John, the valet, and his fiancée Christine, the cook, sit with Miss Julie. She flirts with John, who eventually admits he has loved her since boyhood. On the following day John and Miss Julie discuss how they will spend their lives together, and John expresses his desire to go to Lake Como to make his living running a hotel. When Miss Julie admits she has no money of her own to finance such an undertaking, John demands she somehow find some, so Miss Julie steals money from the Count. Meanwhile, Christine discovers John's intentions and threatens to quit her job with the Count. The lovers prepare to escape, but Miss Julie demands to take her canary with her. Angered, John kills the bird. She grabs his razor and threatens to slit her wrists, and he suggests she go ahead and do it. The Count rings for John, and he leaves, as Julie goes slowly into the garden and follows his suggestion.\n\n"}
