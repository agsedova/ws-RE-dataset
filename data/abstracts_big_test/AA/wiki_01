He was the last cardinal protector of England.\n\nCampeggio was born in Milan, the eldest of five sons. In 1500, he took his doctorate in canon and civil law at Bologna and married Francesca Guastavillani with whom he had five children. When she died in 1509, Campeggio began an ecclesiastical career under Pope Julius II's patronage.\n\nHe was soon appointed to two diplomatic missions, both against the Council of Pisa, first to the emperor Maximilian I, who gave him the Bishopric of Feltre in 1512 (held until 1520), and then in 1512–13 to the Duke of Milan. In 1513 he returned to Germany seeking a league against the Turks. Pope Leo X made him a Cardinal on 1 July 1517, and Maximilian made him Cardinal–protector of the Holy Roman Empire. On 3 March 1518 he was sent to England as part of Leo's peace policy. This gave Thomas Wolsey the chance to become legate himself by using permission for Campeggio to enter England as leverage, and then to outmanoeuvre the new legate when he arrived, taking over the process of peace-making which led to the Treaty of London in 1519. He was also a member of Johann Goritz's humanist sodality.\n\nCampeggio was appointed cardinal–protector of England on 22 January 1523. He was not involved in much English business, except for the referring of episcopal provisions in consistory. The election of Pope Adrian VI in 1522 cemented his position in the Roman Curia.\n\nCampeggio wrote his \"De depravato statu ecclesiae\" for Adrian, which proposed radical reforms for the papal bureaucracy. On 2 December 1524 he received the bishopric of Salisbury, which he had been promised in 1518. The election of Pope Clement VII in 1523 further exalted Campeggio's power. Clement made him bishop of Bologna on 2 December 1523 (held until 1525) and then on 9 January 1524 legate to the Diet of Nuremberg.\n\nDuring the sack of Rome in 1527, Campeggio lost everything. Clement, who fled to Orvieto, left him behind as papal legate in the city, just when the English political situation required his attention. Wolsey and Henry VIII expected his support for their proposal that a papal co-legate should decide Henry's divorce from Catherine of Aragon in co-operation with Wolsey. Campeggio had, however, already given a legal opinion to the Pontiff supporting the validity of the marriage.\n\nNevertheless, he was named legate on 8 June 1528, after a joint commission with Wolsey had been agreed on 13 April. Campeggio arrived in London on 8 October 1528 and held the first of many sessions with Wolsey and Henry, the first English King to sue before a papal judge in person.\n\nCampeggio found himself in a difficult position, since Emperor Charles V, Catherine of Aragon's nephew, was determined to prevent the divorce, and was putting pressure on Clement. The deciding point in law for Campeggio was Julius's dispensation for Henry and Catherine's marriage. In Catherine's possession from early in 1528, she showed it to Campeggio in October, and he took it to invalidate his commission, since the latter failed to cover the document. He tried to make the case disappear on 23 July 1529 by proroguing it until October, but this was forestalled by the Pope sending the matter to Rome a week earlier. On his way back to Rome, Campeggio met Charles and Clement in Bologna, where the pope gave Campeggio the castle of Dozza and the Emperor took Campeggio's family under his patronage. Charles later (2 September 1530) gave Campeggio the Spanish bishopric of Huesca and Jaca, which he held until 17 June 1534 when he became bishop of Candia (Crete) (until 1536); in 1532, moreover, when making Campeggio's son Gianbattista bishop of Majorca, the emperor reserved the administration of the see to the young man's father. Campeggio was legate to the Diet of Augsburg in 1530, where he pursued negotiations with Philip Melanchthon.\n\nBy 20 May 1531, Henry had dismissed Campeggio as legate. In August 1533, he lost the revenues of Salisbury, and on 21 March 1534 was deprived of the bishopric by act of Parliament. Campeggio was a member of the commission which excommunicated Henry in 1535. He remained protector of Germany until his death, at the same time devoting much energy to insuring the future of his family; his two sons, two brothers, and one nephew all became bishops. He was named legate to the general council called first at Mantua and then at Vicenza, but he attended only the first session in May 1538. He died on 25 July 1539, aged sixty-four, and was buried in Santa Maria in Trastevere; in 1571 at least some of his bones were transferred to the church of Santi Marta e Bernardino that he had built in Bologna.\n\n\n\n \n"}

{"id": "1792254", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1792254", "title": "Quebec Autoroute 20", "text": "Quebec Autoroute 20\n\nAutoroute 20 is a Quebec Autoroute, following the Saint Lawrence River through one of the more densely populated parts of Canada, with its central section forming the main route of the Trans-Canada Highway from the A-25 interchange to the A-85 interchange. At , it is the longest Autoroute in Quebec. It is one of two main links between Montreal and Quebec City; the other is the A-40.\n\nThere are two sections of the A-20, separated by a gap. The mainline extends for from the Ontario border to its current terminus at Trois-Pistoles. The second, more northerly section is far shorter (). Constructed as a super two autoroute (one lane in each direction), this section of the A-20 bypasses Rimouski to the south and ends at a roundabout junction with Highway 132 in Mont-Joli. While the Quebec government has completed environmental and economic reviews of the impact of linking the two sections of Autoroute 20, it has not committed the funds necessary for construction. Citing the high number of accidents on the Rimouski-Mont-Joli link of the A-20, many politicians in the Bas-Saint-Laurent region have criticized the government's lack of progress in linking the two sections of autoroute and twinning the two-lane portion.\n\nThe A-20 begins at the Ontario-Quebec border near Rivière-Beaudette as the continuation of Ontario Highway 401. The westernmost section of the A-20 was named the Autoroute du Souvenir (\"Remembrance Highway\") in 2007 to honour Canadian veterans. Road marker signs on this stretch of the autoroute feature a poppy (a traditional symbol of Remembrance in Canada).\n\nAt km 29, the A-20 crosses A-30 (former A-540) before becoming an urban boulevard for approximately eight kilometers (km 30 to 38) in Vaudreuil-Dorion and L'Île-Perrot. This stretch of highway takes the A-20 across the Ottawa River. The speed limit is 50 km/h (30 mph) in Vaudreuil-Dorion and 70 km/h (45 mph) in L'Île-Perrot. The A-20 once again becomes a limited-access highway at km 38, just before crossing the Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue Canal onto the Island of Montreal.\n\nThe A-20 then traverses the West Island (in French, \"l'Ouest de l'Île\") along the north shore of Lac Saint-Louis to an interchange with the A-520. Commonly called the Dorval Interchange, this exit is the main access to Montreal's Trudeau International Airport. Further east, the A-20 crosses the A-13 at its southern terminus, and then, at the St. Pierre Interchange, Route 138 west towards the Mercier Bridge.\n\nJust west of downtown Montreal, the A-20, A-15, and A-720 meet at the Turcot Interchange. From this interchange, A-15 continues north to Laval while A-20 east is multiplexed with A-15 south on the approach to the Samuel-de-Champlain Bridge. Traffic bound for the city centre continues as the A-720 (Autoroute Ville-Marie).\n\nMultiplexed with the A-10 and A-15, all three autoroutes cross the Saint Lawrence River via the Samuel-de-Champlain Bridge to the South Shore (in French, \"Rive Sud\"). The multiplex splits south of the bridge. The A-20 parallels the south shore of the river through suburban Longueuil. The junction with the A-25 affords a direct connection to the Louis Hippolyte Lafontaine Bridge-Tunnel and Montreal's East End. The Trans-Canada Highway joins the A-20 at this junction.\n\nThe largest section of the A-20 (from its junction with A-25 to its easternmost terminus) is named after Jean Lesage, who served as Premier of Quebec from 1960 to 1966, during the Quiet Revolution. Autoroute Jean-Lesage currently exists as two discontinuous sections separated by about 55 kilometers:\n\nFrom the junction with A-25, the A-20 travels east, away from the St. Lawrence River. At kilometer 98, the A-20 intersects the A-30 near Mont Saint-Bruno, crossing the Richelieu River (km 112) just north of Mont-Saint-Hilaire. Bypassing Saint-Hyacinthe, the A-20 forms a multiplex with Route 116 for six kilometers between exits 141 and 147. This section of the A-20 in Centre-du-Québec is located the furthest from the St. Lawrence River (approximately 45 kilometers). Between Drummondville and Sainte-Eulalie, the A-20 forms a multiplex with A-55 for 37 kilometers.\n\nThe A-20 continues across the St. Lawrence Lowlands and Quebec's agricultural heartland. The autoroute once again parallels the river as it approaches metropolitan Quebec City. From this point eastward, the A-20 is never more than five kilometers from the river. At km 312, the A-20 crosses the A-73, a north-south link between Saint-Georges and Quebec City via the Pierre Laporte Bridge. While the control city on the A-20 is listed as \"Québec\", the autoroute never enters the city proper. Before departing the region the A-20 bypasses suburban Lévis.\n\nThis section of the A-20 offers the motorist splendid views over the St. Lawrence River and the mountains of the Côte-Nord, especially Mont-Sainte-Anne and Le Massif. As it continues eastward, the A-20 passes the regional centres of Montmagny and La Pocatière before approaching Rivière-du-Loup and the junction with A-85 at km 499. The Trans-Canada Highway departs the A-20 at this interchange and travels southeast on A-85 toward Edmundston, New Brunswick and the Maritime Provinces. The eastern end of the main section of the A-20 is located in Trois-Pistoles, approximately 40 kilometres east of Rivière-du-Loup.\n\nThe second section of Autoroute Jean-Lesage (km 597 to km 641) connects Rimouski to Mont-Joli. It begins at a junction with Route 132 in the village of Le Bic, approximately 55 km from the current terminus of the A-20 main section. Like its larger counterpart, the Rimouski section of the A-20 parallels the St. Lawrence, providing a southern bypass of Rimouski before ending (at another junction with Route 132) at the western approach to Mont-Joli.\n\nThis section of the A-20 is currently a single carriageway with occasional passing lanes. It was built to accommodate an eventual expansion to four lanes and most overpasses include the clearance needed to accommodate the additional lanes. The high accident rate along this section of the A-20 have prompted many politicians to call for the highway to be expanded to two lanes in each direction.\n\nAn electric fence has been installed on both sides of the highway between km 621 and 628 to prevent moose from crossing the road, while at km 624 an underpass has been constructed to allow wildlife to pass under the highway safely.\n\nTransports Québec (MTQ) is currently engaged in several projects designed to connect the two segments of the A-20 as well as replace outdated sections.\n\nThe MTQ plans to rebuild A-20 (currently an urban boulevard) through Vaudreuil-Dorion and Île-Perrot as a limited-access highway. There is no timeline for this project presently.\n\nIn Montréal, the MTQ has a major work project underway that has shifted the autoroute north between Route 138 and the Turcot Interchange. This new roadway will be complete by the middle of 2020.\n\nLong-range plans by the MTQ call for the two sections of the A-20 to meet. A 9.8 km section of single carriageway was opened to traffic on December 3, 2011 between Cacouna and L'Isle-Verte. As part of this project, a few kilometers of the highway near Cacouna was moved 1.5 km to the south and the old roadbed was destroyed. The MTQ timeline for completing the highway to Trois-Pistoles was met; it opened to traffic in November 2015. Overpasses were constructed for the St-Paul, St-Éloi and Drapeau roads.\n\nRegarding the section from Trois-Pistoles to Le Bic, the Quebec government has completed environmental and economic reviews of the impact of linking the two sections of Autoroute 20, but it has not committed the funds necessary for construction. Frustrated by the long delay in linking the two sections of the A-20, in 2013, the Mayor of Rimouski proposed paying for the construction by tolling the autoroute.\n\nCiting predictions for an increase in ferry traffic to and from the Côte-Nord as a result of the Government of Quebec's Plan Nord, in 2011 the Mayor of Matane called for the further extension of the A-20 to his city.\n\nAutoroute 20 serves as the backdrop to the popular 2002 Quebec film \"Québec-Montréal\" by Ricardo Trogi about seven twenty-something travellers driving between the two cities.\n\nThe Quebec French expression \"à l'autre bout de la 20\" (in English, \"at the other end of the 20\") refers to Montreal when the speaker is in Quebec City, and to Quebec City when one is in Montreal.\n\nOlder Anglophone Montrealers sometimes still refer to the section of the A-20 west of the city as Highway 2-20 (or \"The Two and Twenty\"), but the Route 2 designation was dropped in the mid 1970s.\n\nThe rest stops are located at the following points on Highway 20 and contain the following services:\nA-20 Eastbound\nA-20 Westbound\n\n"}

{"id": "1792264", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1792264", "title": "Paolo Avitabile", "text": "Paolo Avitabile\n\nGeneral Paolo Crescenzo Martino Avitabile ; (\"ابوتبیلا Abu Tabela\") (25 October 1791 – 28 March 1850) was an Italian soldier, mercenary and adventurer. A peasant's son born in Agerola, near Amalfi in Italy, he served in the Neapolitan militia during the Napoleonic wars. After Waterloo he drifted east like many other adventurous soldiers. In 1820 he joined the army of the Shah of Persia, attaining the rank of colonel and receiving several decorations before returning to Italy in 1824.\n\nHe joined the army of Maharaja Ranjit Singh of the Punjab in 1827, and later also received various civilian appointments. In 1829 he was made administrator of Wazirabad and in 1837 he succeeded Hari Singh Nalwa as governor of Peshawar. He remained in the Punjab until the assassination of Maharaja Sher Singh in 1843, after which he retired to Italy, where his rank as a general was confirmed and he was knighted.\n\nThe young Avitabile served in the local levies of the Kingdom of Naples between 1807 and 1809, when he joined the artillery of the regular army. As a part of the Imperial Army, Avitabile served under Murat on several campaigns. In these campaigns he earned the rank of Lieutenant, as well as the command of the 15th Battery. After the fall of Napoleon and the defeat of Murat at Tolentino, Naples was restored to Ferdinand I of Sicily. Avitabile retained his rank and command and joined the army of the new Kingdom of Two Sicilies, where he joined the siege of Gaeta under the command of the Austrian general Delaver.\n\nDuring this siege, he displayed great bravery and was wounded twice. The general recommended him for a promotion and a decoration, but was not heard. Avitabile was transferred instead to a position of lieutenant in a regiment of light infantry. It is said he quit in disgust over this treatment. His European career had come to an end.\n\nHaving quit the army in Naples, Avitabile set his eyes on a career abroad. His initial idea was to, as many of his countrymen, seek fortune in America but this ended in a shipwreck off Marseille. Instead, he was advised to seek employment to the east. In Constantinople he was approached by an agent of the Persian Shah Fath Ali Shah recruiting European officers; in 1820, Avitabile took service with the Persian Shah. He remained in this employment for six years, during which period he rose to the rank of \"khan\" and a grade of colonel in the Persian army. Here he also met Claude August Court who would later accompany him on the travel to Punjab. Avitabile was rewarded for his services by two of Persia's highest decorations as Grand Commander of \"The Lion and Sun\" and of \"The Two Lions and Crown\", but found the pay lacking. When he heard favourable notice from Jean-Baptiste Ventura of his employment in Punjab Ventura again broke up to travel further to the east.\n\nTogether with Court, Avitabile arrived in Lahore in 1827 and was hired by Maharaja Ranjit Singh. He was given a position with the artillery and put in charge of the arsenal and gun foundries. He was also given a civilian position as governor of Wazirabad. It would seem he was an able administrator, as he held the position for the next seven years and as a result, Wazirabad prospered.\n\nIn 1834 he was appointed governor of Peshawar, an area the Maharaja had conquered from the Afghans the previous year.\n\nWhere as his rule of Wazirabad is described as just and rigorous, his governorship of Peshawar is depicted as a rule of \"gallows and gibbets\". Avitabile boasted: \"When I marched into Peshawar, I sent on in advance a number of wooden posts which my men erected around the walls of the city. The men scoffed at them and laughed at the madness of the \"feringhee\" [a disparaging local language term for Westerners], and harder still when my men came in and laid coils of rope at the foot of the posts...However, when my preparations were completed and they found one fine morning danging from these posts, fifty of the worse characters in Peshawar, they thought different. And I repeated the exhibition every day till I had made a scarcity of brigands and murderers. Then I had to deal with the liars and tale bearers. My method with them was to cut out their tongues. When a surgeon appeared and professed to be able to restore their speech, I sent for him and cut out his tongue also. After that there was peace\".\n\nWith a ruthless, at times brutal, style of government, Avitabile established order in the province where he became known as Abu Tabela. Summary executions became usual, and it is said that he would have people executed by throwing them from the top of Mahabat Khan Mosque. The American adventurer Alexander Gardner wrote about Avitabile's rule in Peshawar: \"Under his rule small pains are taken to distinguish between innocence and guilt, and many a man, ignorant of the alleged crime, pays for it with his life\". While this brutality was shocking to visiting Europeans (in the words of Sir Henry Lawrence: \"he acts like a savage among savage men, instead of showing them that a Christian can wield the iron sceptre without staining it by needless cruelty\"), it proved both successful in maintaining order and even popular among the peaceful inhabitants.\n\nHis iron fist rule over Peshawar has made a place for him in local folklore. Even today unruly children in the city are brought to control by invoking Abu Tabela's name. In times of unrest, law-abiding citizens send a small wish for the return of an Abu Tabela to finally re-impose law and order.\n\nThe control of this strategic position brought him in contact with the British army during the First Anglo-Afghan War (1839–42), where he was able to render vital assistance. As governor of Peshawar, Avitabile controlled the southern entrance to the Khyber Pass, although the Maharaja did not allow for the British to move through the Sikh Empire to reach the Khyber pass, he ordered Avitable to assist the British through the pass itself, into Afghanistan. During Elphinstone's advance in 1839, the British were well received in Peshawar and their officers received a princely treatment. Captain Havelock spent a month in Peshawar, and describes the splendour of Avitabile's court in his memoirs. He also gives a favourable characterisation of the governor: \"\"He is, moreover, a frank, gay, and good-humoured person, as well as an excellent and skilful officer.\"\"\n\nAvitabile was also a scholar and an engineer, who worked very closely with the most brilliant Sikh engineer Lehna Singh Majithia.\n\nWhen the British returned in 1842, to avenge the defeat of Elphinstone, they were given every possible assistance by Avitabile's government, while he was still in the employ of the Sikh Empire as the Afghans had been a longtime enemy of the Sikhs. \n\nAvitabile remained in the position of Governor during the First Anglo-Afghan War until he left in 1843. Having secured his retirement in Europe, he resigned his position to return home.\n\nAs one of the few European adventurers in the area, he succeeded in building a fortune and getting away with it. He returned to Naples, where he built a grand home in San Lazzaro (Agerola). He died soon after marrying a local girl: Enrichetta Coccia. The following legal battle over his inheritance, and the many distant relatives asserting their claims, made \"Avitabile's cousin\" something of a byword in Italy.\n\nAvitabile is a minor character in \"Flashman\", a 1969 novel by George MacDonald Fraser. The narrator describes him as a \"great, grey-bearded ox of a man... the Sikhs and Afghans were more scared of him than of the Devil himself.\" Despite Avitabile never facing Sikhs in battle himself or even having a reputation among common Sikhs or his fellow soldiers.\n\nAvitabile won honours in every country he served.

In this episode, Buffy follows Angel back to Los Angeles, where she confronts him about his surreptitious assistance back in Sunnydale. They are attacked by a Mohra demon; when Angel kills the demon he is restored to life by its powerful blood. After The Oracles — a link to The Powers That Be — confirm he is human again, Angel and Buffy spend a blissful night together. When Doyle receives a vision that the Mohra has regenerated itself, Angel leaves to kill the demon for good. In the ensuing battle, Angel discovers the consequences of having only human strength; Buffy must come to his rescue and slay the demon herself. Angel returns to The Oracles, who agree to turn back time so that Angel, accepting the entire cost of the bargain, can kill the Mohra before its blood makes him human. This episode is #78 on the \"TV Guide\" list of TV's Top 100 Episodes of all time.\n\nBuffy surprises Angel with a visit to Los Angeles. Their emotion-driven discussion is interrupted by the arrival of a Mohra demon. Angel stabs the demon, but it retreats to the sewers. Buffy and Angel hesitantly follow, discussing their future as a couple and the feelings about each other. They split up; Angel meets the demon on his route. As they fight, the Mohra demon cuts Angel. Angel kills the demon. Its blood, eventually found to be the Blood of Eternity, merges with his own, and he becomes human.\n\nRealizing what this means for their relationship, Angel spends the night with Buffy. However, Doyle shares the news that the Mohra demon is alive: the demon's rejuvenating blood also worked on itself. So, Angel sets out with Doyle to kill the demon, without Buffy's much-needed supernatural assistance. Angel fails miserably until Buffy shows up and slays the demon. Angel realizes how useless he is in his human form, and asks the Oracles to turn back time to make him a \"demon with a soul\" once more. They consent, and time is set back twenty four hours despite a heartbroken Buffy begging Angel to remain human before the Mohra demon is killed, with only Angel as a witness to the night he and Buffy shared in the erased timeline.\n\nIn his essay on the music used in \"Angel,\" Matthew Mills points out how, when Angel asks the Oracles to turn back time, the slow tempo and use of the clarinet in the background music adds \"emotive weight to the Oracles' sympathy\" for his situation. As the Oracles explain that only Angel will remember the moments he shared with Buffy, Angel's theme ends on a minor key, underscoring the sacrifice being made.\n\n\"Angel is one of those heroes who flourish on frustration,\" Peter S. Beagle says, \"who thrive on never achieving their hearts' desire.\" This episode, in which Angel relinquishes the chance to have a normal, happy life with Buffy in order to \"fulfill his penance,\" perfectly typifies Angel's character and fate, says Beagle.\n\n\n\n\nNoel Murray of \"The A.V. Club\" liked the premise but not the whole execution, writing, \"It's an undeniably sweet episode, but I have to say I found the set-up clunky and the complications a little forced, no matter how beautifully it all plays out.\"\n\nIn \"Entertainment Weekly\" list of the 25 best Whedonverse episodes—including episodes from \"Angel\", as well as \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\", \"Firefly\" and \"Dollhouse\"—\"I Will Remember You\" placed at #14. This episode was rated the series' best episode in a poll done by \"Angel Magazine\" in 2005.\n\n"}
{"id": "1792281", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1792281", "title": "Blue Mink", "text": "Blue Mink\n\nBlue Mink were a British six-piece pop group that existed from 1969 to 1974. Over that period they had six Top 20 hit singles in the UK Singles Chart, and released five studio based albums. According to AllMusic: \"they have been immortalised on a string of compilation albums, each recounting the string of effervescent hits that established them among Britain's best-loved pop groups of the early 1970s.\"\n\nRoger Coulam (keyboards) formed the band in the autumn of 1969, with American-born Madeline Bell (vocalist), Roger Cook (vocalist), Alan Parker (guitarist), Herbie Flowers (bassist), and Barry Morgan (drummer). Most of the songs were written by Cook and Roger Greenaway. Flowers, Morgan and Parker all worked with Coulam at London's Morgan Studios. The four of them recorded several backing tracks, with which Coulam approached Bell and Greenaway, (who had been half of David and Jonathan), as vocalists. Greenaway declined, but put forward Cook (the other half of David and Jonathan).\n\nThe band's debut single \"Melting Pot\", written by Cook and Greenaway, was recorded with this line-up and released on 31 October 1969 on the Philips label (catalogue BF1818), with the B-side \"Blue Mink\" (penned by Alan Parker); it peaked at No. 3 in the UK Singles Chart. An American cover version entitled \"People Are Together\" by soul singer Mickey Murray proved too radical for American radio and failed to get any meaningful airplay. An album of the same name was released early in 1970, at the same time as the second single, \"Good Morning Freedom\", which reached No. 10 in the chart. The track did not feature on the first release of the LP, but was added to subsequent pressings.\n\nThe members continued with their session work despite the success of the band. In March 1970, Cook, Bell, Parker and Morgan appeared on Elton John's eponymous first solo album; Elton John covered \"Good Morning Freedom\" (written by Albert Hammond) anonymously on the Deacon Records budget compilation album \"Pick of the Pops\". In April, Cook and Greenaway played briefly in Currant Kraze, and together they continued to write songs such as \"You've Got Your Troubles\", \"I've Got You on My Mind\" and \"I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing\". Other side projects included: involvement with Parker's band The Congregation; Herbie Flowers' contributions to Lou Reed's \"Transformer\" album; and the involvement of Flowers, Morgan and Parker in sessions with Pete Atkin in March 1971, that later appeared on his \"Driving Through Mythical America\" album.\n\nThe band's second album and their third single released on Philips in September 1970 were entitled \"Our World\" (the album was released as \"Real Mink\" in the US). The band's next single release was \"The Banner Man\" on Regal Zonophone in the spring of 1971. It reached No. 3 in the UK chart, equalling the success of the debut single and notable for its use of a brass band. Reviewing \"Real Mink\" years later in \"\" (1981), Robert Christgau said Bell and Cook's collaboration is \"solid white soul, marred by a couple of automatic instrumentals but graced by a charming self-consciousness as well as a few top commercial songs—oh yes, and a black singer.\"\n\nThe members' other projects now took priority until January 1972 when Blue Mink played two weeks at The Talk of the Town nightclub in London. Recordings from this engagement were released that March as the album \"Live at the Talk of the Town\" simultaneously with the studio album \"A Time of Change\" (renamed from \"Harvest\" to avoid confusion with Neil Young's new LP).\n\nRay Cooper (drums) and Ann Odell (keyboards) joined the band that summer and played on the single \"Stay With Me\" co-written by Herbie Flowers, which charted at No. 11 in November 1972. By the time of Blue Mink's fourth album, \"Only When I Laugh\", glam rock was supplanting the lighter pop sound of the previous few years. The associated single, \"By The Devil (I Was Tempted)\", written by Guy Fletcher and Doug Flett, only reached No. 26 and the Top 10 single \"Randy\" in June 1973 was their last success. Their final album, \"Fruity\", (January 1974) and the singles \"Quackers\" (January 1974) and \"Get Up\" (July 1974) failed, and the band split up that autumn after a farewell tour of the United States. Elton John was among the celebrities present to say goodbye, introducing the band onstage at The Troubadour in Los Angeles.\n\nThe band reformed in 1976 featuring Mike Moran. They recorded a few singles on the Target Records label that was owned by Cook and Greenaway. The best known of their three releases was \"Where Were You Today\", written by Greenaway and Dundas, previously \"Come and C&A\", a television and radio commercial jingle theme for the department store C&A. When Capital Radio, one of the UK's first two independent local radio stations took to the air in London in 1973, the station's identity jingles were written by Cook and Greenaway, performed by Blue Mink and orchestrated by George Martin. Madeline Bell had also sung the original jingles for Radio Caroline, the offshore pirate station that first went on-air in 1964, in the end successfully challenging the BBC's monopoly of British radio broadcasting.\n\nSince the band's demise, each of the members maintained a presence in the world of session musicianship and songwriting. The Rimshots covered Blue Mink's \"Get Up\", retitled as the disco single \"7-6-5-4-3-2-1 (Blow Your Whistle)\" in 1976, and had a hit. In 1994, Cook, Bell and Flowers were re-united for a television rendition of their hit \"Melting Pot\" on the Michael Barrymore show.\n\nThe 1971 song \"The Banner Man\" (originally by the 004's) is used for the opening sequence of the 1999 British film \"East is East,\" which is set in 1971 Salford.\n\nTheir 1970 hit \"Good Morning Freedom\" was featured prominently in the season 2 \"Breaking Bad\" episode \"4 Days Out.\"\n\n\"By the Devil (I Was Tempted)\" was a minor hit for Claude François in 1973, with French lyrics by Eddie Marnay, under the title \"À part ça, la vie est belle\".\n\n\n\n\n"}

As with the overwhelming majority of UK by-elections, turnout was lower than at the general election — here falling from 83% to 71% (rounded).\n\nThe by-election in Newbury was the first by-election of the 1992–1997 parliament, and the first in a string of by-election losses for the Conservative Party who were in their fourth consecutive term of office. Until 1993 the seat had been held by a Conservative MP since 1924.\n\nMany independent candidates, or candidates from newly formed or minor parties stood in the by-election, with three candidates standing on an anti-Maastricht Treaty platform. Andrew Bannon, a Labour member from Slough stood as a \"Conservative Candidate\" in protest at a Conservative member standing as a \"Labour Candidate\" in the 1992 general election in Slough.\n\nAll candidates needed since 1985 to win at least 5% of the total votes to retain their deposit, which they must pay to stand for election.

It was formed as part of an agreement between the Polish Government in Exile and the United Kingdom in 1940. 300 Squadron is now represented by 300 (Isle of Axholme) Squadron of the Royal Air Force Air Cadets, which made the alliance with the Polish Air Force is 1994.\n\nBefore the outbreak of World War II, the Polish government signed an agreement with the Royal Air Force. According to the appendix to the Polish-British Alliance, in the event of war with Germany, two Polish bomber squadrons were to be created on British soil. However, following the German invasion of Poland and subsequent Soviet invasion of Poland, most of the Polish airmen who got to the west were incorporated into the Polish Air Forces being created in France. It was not until the fall of France that Polish airmen started to arrive in the United Kingdom in large numbers.\n\nPolish evacuees and refugees with experience in aerial warfare were initially housed in a military camp in Eastchurch.\n\nOn 1 July 1940, the No. 300 Polish Bomber Squadron was created as the first such Polish units at RAF Bramcote, as a part of the Polish Air Forces in Great Britain. As there were a large number of Polish airmen, often with experience in combat against the Germans from Poland and France, additional bomber squadrons were created by 24 July.\n\nBetween 19 July 1940 and 8 May 1945, the crews of the squadron flew 3,891 sorties and spent 20,264 hours in the air.\n\nInitially equipped with Fairey Battle light bombers, the squadron was equipped with Vickers Wellington medium bombers on 16 November 1940. The squadron used several variants, including Mark IC, IV, III and X. In 1941 while the unit was equipped with Wellingtons and flying from Hemswell on 'Gardening' (mining) operations, the squadron's Intelligence Officer was Michael Bentine, later to become well known as an entertainer. On 5 March 1944 the unit was re-equipped with Avro Lancaster bombers and continued to use that bomber until the end of World War II (Mk I and Mk III variants).\nDuring the war, the squadron took part in most of the notable air offensives in Europe, including attacks on Nazi Germany's \"Kriegsmarine\" preparing for Operation Seelöwe, also ships such as the docked in Brest, France, other naval facilities in Wilhelmshaven and its U-boat facilities in St. Nazaire, Millennium Offensive on large bombing raids on Cologne, bombing raids on V-weapon sites, D-Day, in support of crossing the Rhine, the Battle of the Ruhr, the bombing of Hamburg and the Battle of Berlin.\n\nA number of the crew members were in late 1942 attached to the RAF Tempsford based No. 138 (Special) Squadron RAF as the newly formed \"Flight C\" operating the Handley Page Halifax.\n\nThe last mission was flown on 25 April 1945 against Adolf Hitler's residence in Berchtesgaden. The unit was disbanded on 2 January 1947, after the Allies withdrew their support for the Polish government in exile.\n\n\n"}

At the age of 10, DeLuca moved to Amsterdam, New York, where he and his family became friends with Peter Buck. Once in his teens, he moved with his family to Bridgeport, Connecticut. After succeeding in his business, DeLuca realized his dream to go to college and graduated from the University of Bridgeport.\n\nDeLuca was a 1965 graduate of Central High School in Bridgeport, Connecticut.\n\nIn 1965, 17-year-old DeLuca borrowed $1,000 from family friend Dr. Peter Buck. This was after Buck suggested the idea to help DeLuca make money for college to study medicine. DeLuca's plan was to begin a \"fast-food venture that provided a healthful, less fattening bill of fare\". On the radio advertisement they had promoted the name as \"Pete's Submarines,\" which sounded like \"Pizza Marines\" (see mondegreen), so they changed the name to \"Pete's Subway.\" Eventually in 1968, it was shortened to simply \"Subway\" as it is known today.\n\nThe first shop opened on August 28, 1965 at a mediocre location in the city of Bridgeport, Connecticut. The first year of business was a learning experience and a challenge. A year later they opened their second location, having realized that visibility and marketing were key factors to success. DeLuca believed that the biggest mistake he made was where he set up his very first shop as it was a \"crummy location.\" The third outlet was in a highly visible location and that location is still there today.\n\nIn 1978, Subway's 100th store opened, and reached the 1,000 store mark in 1987. Explosive growth continued with Subway opening 1,100 units in 1993 alone. By comparison, McDonald's opened 800 that same year.\n\nAs of April 2018, the company counts 43,700 franchised locations worldwide and this year plans to open more than 1,000 locations outside of North America, it produces US$9.05 billion in sales every year. In 2007, \"Forbes\" magazine named DeLuca number 242 of the 400 richest Americans with a net worth of $1.5 billion. Today, Subway is one of the most popular chain food vendors.\n\nDeLuca and Peter Buck also partnered to create Franchise Brands in an effort to assist other entrepreneurs in replicating their success in the franchise industry.\n\nDeLuca had homes in Milford, Connecticut, and Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and lived with his wife Elisabeth. His son, Jonathan, lives in Boca Raton, Florida.\n\nOn July 15, 2013, DeLuca announced that he was being treated for leukemia. DeLuca died on September 14, 2015, at Lauderdale Lakes, Florida.\n\nAt the graduation commencement in 2002, DeLuca received an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters (L.H.D.) from his alma mater, the University of Bridgeport.\n\n"}
{"id": "1792302", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1792302", "title": "Pachyrhinosaurus", "text": "Pachyrhinosaurus\n\nPachyrhinosaurus (meaning in Greek \"thick-nosed lizard\", from \"Παχυ\" (pachy), thick; \"ρινό\" (rinó), nose; and \"σαυρος\" (sauros), lizard) is an extinct genus of centrosaurine ceratopsid dinosaur from the Late Cretaceous period of North America. The first examples were discovered by Charles M. Sternberg in Alberta, Canada, in 1946, and named in 1950. Over a dozen partial skulls and a large assortment of other fossils from various species have been found in Alberta and Alaska. A great number were not available for study until the 1980s, resulting in a relatively recent increase of interest in \"Pachyrhinosaurus\".\n\nThree species have been identified. \"P. lakustai\", from the Wapiti Formation, the bonebed horizon of which is roughly equivalent age to the upper Bearpaw and lower Horseshoe Canyon Formations, is known to have existed from about 73.5–72.5 million years ago. \"P. canadensis\" is younger, known from the lower Horseshoe Canyon Formation, about 71.5–71 Ma ago and the St. Mary River Formation. Fossils of the youngest species, \"P. perotorum\", have been recovered from the Prince Creek Formation of Alaska, and date to 70–69 Ma ago. The presence of three known species makes this genus the most speciose among the centrosaurines.\n\nThe largest \"Pachyrhinosaurus\" species were long. It weighed about four tonnes. They were herbivorous and possessed strong cheek teeth to help them chew tough, fibrous plants.\n\nInstead of horns, their skulls bore massive, flattened bosses; a large boss over the nose and a smaller one over the eyes. A prominent pair of horns grew from the frill and extended upwards. The skull also bore several smaller horns or ornaments that varied between individuals and between species. In \"P. canadensis\" and \"P. perotorum\", the bosses over the nose and eyes nearly grew together, and were separated only by a narrow groove. In \"P. lakustai\", the two bosses were separated by a wide gap. In \"P. canadensis\" and \"P. lakustai\", the frill bore two additional small, curved, backward-pointed horns. These were not present in \"P. perotorum\", and in fact some specimens of \"P. lakustai\" also lack them, which may indicate that the presence of these horns varied by age or sex.\n\nVarious ornaments of the nasal boss have also been used to distinguish between different species of \"Pachyrhinosaurus\". Both \"P. lakustai\" and \"P. perotorum\" bore a jagged, comb-like extension at the tip of the boss which was missing in \"P. canadensis\". \"P. perotorum\" was unique in having a narrow dome in the middle of the back portion of the nasal boss, and \"P. lakustai\" had a pommel-like structure projecting from the front of the boss (the boss of \"P. canadensis\" was mainly flat on top and rounded). \"P. perotorum\" bore two unique, flattened horns which projected forward and down from the top edge of the frill, and \"P. lakustai\" bore another comb-like horn arising from the middle of the frill behind the eyes.\n\n\"Pachyrhinosaurus canadensis\", was described in 1950 by Charles Mortram Sternberg based on the holotype incomplete skull NMC 8867, and the paratype incomplete skull NMC 8866, which included the anterior part of the skull but was lacking the right lower mandible, and the \"beak\". These skulls were collected in 1945 and 1946 from the sandy clay of the Horseshoe Canyon Formation in Alberta, Canada. In the years to come, additional material would be recovered at the Scabby Butte locality of the St. Mary River Formation near Lethbridge, Alberta, from terrestrial sediments considered to be between 74 and 66 million years old. These were among the first dinosaur sites found in the province, in the 1880s. The significance of these discoveries was not understood until shortly after World War II when preliminary excavations were conducted.\n\nAnother \"Pachyrhinosaurus\" skull was taken out of the Scabby Butte locality in 1955, and then in 1957 Wann Langston Jr. and a small crew excavated additional pachyrhinosaur remains. The University of Calgary has plans to reopen this important site some day as a field school for university-level paleontology students.\nSeveral specimens, NMC 21863, NMC 21864, NMC 10669 assigned in 1975 by W. Langston, Jr. to \"Pachyrhinosaurus\" were also recovered at the Scabby Butte locality.\n\nAnother \"Pachyrhinosaurus\" bonebed, on the Wapiti River south of Beaverlodge in northwestern Alberta, was worked briefly by staff of the Royal Tyrrell Museum in the late 1980s but is now worked annually for a couple weeks each summer (since 2006) by the University of Alberta. Material from this site appears referable to \"Pachyrhinosaurus canadensis\". In 1974, Grande Prairie, Alberta science teacher Al Lakusta found a large bonebed along Pipestone Creek in Alberta. When the area was finally excavated between 1986 and 1989 by staff and volunteers of the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology, paleontologists discovered an amazingly large and dense selection of bones—up to 100 per square meter, with a total of 3,500 bones and 14 skulls. This was apparently the site of a mass mortality, perhaps a failed attempt to cross a river during a flood. Found amongst the fossils were the skeletons of four distinct age groups ranging from juveniles to full-grown dinosaurs, indicating that the \"Pachyrhinosaurus\" cared for their young. The adult skulls had both convex and concave bosses as well as unicorn-style horns on the parietal bone just behind their eyes. The concave boss types might be related to erosion only and not reflect male/female differences.\n\nIn 2008, a detailed monograph describing the skull of the Pipestone Creek pachyrhinosaur, and penned by Philip J. Currie, Wann Langston Jr., and Darren Tanke, classified the specimen as a second species of \"Pachyrhinosaurus\", named \"P. lakustai\" after its discoverer.\n\nIn 2013, Fiorillo \"et al.\" described a new specimen, an incomplete nasal bone attributable to \"Pachyrhinosaurus perotorum\" which was collected from the Kikak-Tegoseak Quarry on the Colville River in Alaska. Fiorillo \"et al.\" named this unique northern Alaskan species after the Texas oil billionaire and benefactor, Ross Perot. This bone, designated DMNH 21460 belongs to an immature individual. This discovery expands the known age profile of this dinosaur genus from this particular site. The specimen has nasal ornamentation that is dorsally enlarged, representing an intermediate stage of growth. Of note, the authors pointed out that the posterior part of the nasal shows evidence for \"a degree of integument complexity not previously recognized in other species\" of \"Pachyrhinosaurus\". It was determined that the dorsal surface of the nasal boss bore a thick, cornified pad and sheath.\n\nThe cladogram below shows the phylogenetic position of all currently known \"Pachyrhinosaurus\" species following Chiba \"et al.\" (2017):\n\nDuring the first few years of development, \"P. perotorum\" show extremely rapid growth. When the animals were one year old, they had already reached 28% of their adult body size. By age two, they were almost half the size of a mature adult. However, the rate of growth slows considerably after that, and maximum size is not fully attained until about age twenty. The development of characteristics useful in sexual selection, including competition between males, such as pronounced nasal bosses, occurred at approximately nine years of age. This presumably corresponds to the age of sexual maturity.\n\nUnlike other \"Pachyrhinosaurus\" species, \"P. perotorum\" shows highly conspicuous growth banding in the bones, indicating retarded growth during the winter. This is perhaps not surprising, considering that \"P. perotorum\" experienced much harsher winters than southerly species within the genus.\n\n\"P. lakustai\" does not show growth banding early in ontogeny in the specimens that have been examined. However, growth bands are weakly expressed later in ontogeny. This probably indicates rapid growth in youth, followed by gradually decreasing growth rates as the animal neared adulthood. The growth curve of the animal would therefore be somewhat asymptotic, unlike the linear growth found in many ectothermic animals.\n\nThe development of characteristics useful in sexual selection, including competition between males, such as pronounced nasal bosses, occurred when the dinosaur was roughly 73% the size of a full-grown adult. The age of sexual maturity is unknown. Due to the lack of conspicuous growth banding, more detailed analyses of \"P. lakustai\" growth rates cannot be performed.\n\nThe St. Mary River Formation has not undergone a definitive radiometric dating, however, the available stratigraphic correlation has shown that this formation was deposited between 74 and 66 million years ago, during the Campanian and the late Maastrichtian, during the final regression of the mid-continental Bearpaw Seaway. It ranges from as far south as Glacier County, Montana to as far north as the Little Bow River in Alberta. The St. Mary River Formation is part of the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin in southwestern Alberta, which extends from the Rocky Mountains in the west to the Canadian Shield in the east. It is laterally equivalent to the Horseshoe Canyon Formation. The region where dinosaurs lived was bounded by mountains to the west, and included ancient channels, small freshwater ponds, streams, and floodplains.\n\n\"Pachyrhinosaurus\" shared its paleoenvironment with other dinosaurs, such as the ceratopsians \"Anchiceratops\" and \"Montanoceratops cerorhynchus\", the armored nodosaur \"Edmontonia longiceps\", the duckbilled hadrosaur \"Edmontosaurus regalis\", the theropods \"Saurornitholestes\" and \"Troodon\", possibly the ornithopod \"Thescelosaurus\", and the tyrannosaurid \"Albertosaurus\", which was likely the apex predator in its ecosystem. Vertebrates present in the St. Mary River Formation at the time of \"Pachyrhinosaurus\" included the actinopterygian fishes \"Amia fragosa\", \"Lepisosteus\", \"Belonostomus\", \"Paralbula casei\", and \"Platacodon nanus\", the mosasaur \"Plioplatecarpus\", the turtle \"Boremys\" and the diapsid reptile \"Champsosaurus\". A fair number of mammals lived in this region, which included \"Turgidodon russelli\", \"Cimolestes\", \"Didelphodon\", \"Leptalestes\", \"Cimolodon nitidus\", and \"Paracimexomys propriscus\". Non-vertebrates in this ecosystem included mollusks, the oyster \"Crassostrea wyomingensis\", the small clam \"Anomia\", and the snail \"Melania\". Flora of the region include the aquatic angiosperm \"Trapago angulata\", the amphibious heterosporous fern \"Hydropteris pinnata\", rhizomes, and taxodiaceous conifers.\n\nThe Horseshoe Canyon Formation has been radiometrically dated as being between 74 and 67 million years old. It was deposited during the gradual withdrawal of the Western Interior Seaway, during the Campanian and Maastrichtian stage of the Late Cretaceous period. The Horseshoe Canyon Formation is a terrestrial unit which is part of the Edmonton Group that includes the Battle Formation and the Whitemud Member, both in Edmonton. The valley where dinosaurs lived included ancient meandering estuary channels, straight channels, peat swamps, river deltas, floodplains, shorelines and wetlands. Due to the changing sea levels, many different environments are represented in the Horseshoe Canyon Formation, including offshore and near-shore marine habitats and coastal habitats like lagoons, and tidal flats. The area was wet and warm with a temperate to subtropical climate. Just prior to the Campanian–Maastrichtian boundary, the mean annual temperature and precipitation in this region dropped rapidly. The dinosaurs from this formation form part of the Edmontonian land vertebrate age, and are distinct from those in the formations above and below. \n\nModern life at high elevations in lower latitudes resembles life at low elevation in higher latitudes. There may be parallels to this phenomenon in Cretaceous ecosystems, for instance, \"Pachyrhinosaurus\" species are found in both Alaska and upland environments in southern Alberta.\nDuring the Edmontonian, in North America's northern biome, there is a general trend of reduced centrosaurine diversity, with only \"Pachyrhinosaurus\" surviving. \"Pachyrhinosaurus\" appears to have been part of a coastal fauna characterized by an association with \"Edmontosaurus\".\n\n\"P. canadensis\" coexisted with ankylosaurids \"Anodontosaurus lambei\" and \"Edmontonia longiceps\", the maniraptorans \"Atrociraptor marshalli\", \"Epichirostenotes curriei\", the troodontid \"Albertavenator\" curriei, the alvarezsaurid theropod \"Albertonykus borealis\", the ornithomimids \"Dromiceiomimus brevitertius\", \"Ornithomimus edmontonicus\", and an unnamed species of \"Struthiomimus\", the bone-head pachycephalosaurids \"Stegoceras\", and \"Sphaerotholus edmontonensis\", the ornithopod \"Parksosaurus warreni\", the hadrosaurids \"Edmontosaurus regalis\", \"Hypacrosaurus altispinus\", and \"Saurolophus osborni\", the ceratopsians \"Anchiceratops ornatus\", \"Arrhinoceratops brachyops\", \"Eotriceratops xerinsularis\", \"Montanoceratops cerorhynchus\", and the tyrannosaurids \"Albertosaurus\" sarcophagus and a possible species of \"Daspletosaurus\", which were the apex predators of this paleoenvironment. Of these, the hadrosaurs dominated in terms of sheer number and made up half of all dinosaurs who lived in this region. Vertebrates present in the Horseshoe Canyon Formation at the time of \"Pachyrhinosaurus\" included reptiles, and amphibians. Sharks, rays, sturgeons, bowfins, gars and the gar-like \"Belonostomus\" made up the fish fauna. Reptiles such as turtles and crocodilians are rare in the Horseshoe Canyon Formation, and this was thought to reflect the relatively cool climate which prevailed at the time. A study by Quinney et al. (2013) however, showed that the decline in turtle diversity, which was previously attributed to climate, coincided instead with changes in soil drainage conditions, and was limited by aridity, landscape instability, and migratory barriers. The saltwater plesiosaur \"Leurospondylus\" was present and freshwater environments were populated by turtles, \"Champsosaurus\", and crocodilians like \"Leidyosuchus\" and \"Stangerochampsa\". Evidence has shown that multituberculates and the early marsupial \"Didelphodon coyi\" were present. Vertebrate trace fossils from this region included the tracks of theropods, ceratopsians and ornithopods, which provide evidence that these animals were also present. Non-vertebrates in this ecosystem included both marine and terrestrial invertebrates.\n\n"}

Other weapons in this family include the meteor hammer, flying claws, Fei Tou flying weight, and chain whip. Although the flexible weapons share similar movements, each weapon has its own specific techniques.\n\nThe rope dart is a long rope (usually ) with a metal dart attached to one end. This was a weapon from ancient times, which allows the user to throw the dart out at a long-range target and use the rope to pull it back. The rope dart can be used for twining, binding, circling, hitting, piercing, tightening, slashing and other techniques.\n\nRope dart play consists of twining, shooting, and retrieval. Twining and shooting can be done from any joint such as foot, knee, elbow, and neck. The rope is anchored on one hand and played primarily with the other hand.\n\nSkillful use of the rope dart can easily trick an opponent because the dart can shoot out very suddenly, from a person beyond immediate reach.\n\nJust like the chain whip, excellent hand-eye coordination is a must for the practitioner to use this weapon well. In some Wushu training regimens, the chain whip and Changquan are prerequisites for learning the rope dart.\n\nA variation of this weapon is the meteor hammer, which has a blunt weight on the end of the rope. It was used in a similar fashion to the rope dart, and many of the techniques are the same.\n\nThe first written description of the rope dart is dated from the Tang Dynasty (618–907 AD).\n\nThe rope dart is constructed from 4 to 5 parts:\n\nThe dart is made of a hard material, usually iron or steel. It can be of variable weight depending on the users preference, and can be variable in shape (conical, triangular prism, pentagonal prism).\n\nThe rings (usually 4 or 5) are attached to the dart head.\n\nThe rope is attached to the final ring. Traditionally, the rope was constructed from Chinese rope and covered with wax to minimize friction. In modern times, the rope is often made of a softer synthetic material and covered with talc powder or some other substance to reduce friction.\n\nThere is at least one flag attached near, or onto the dart head itself to conceal the dart during play and to add control. Additional flags can be attached to the side rings to slow down the dart and increase control.\n\nThe handle is made from the last piece of rope as a slipknot to attach to the anchor hand's wrist.\n\nWhile relatively new, rope dart is becoming increasingly popular in being used in the object manipulation scene due to its impressive performances. Because of this, there have been modifications to the original design. Some rope darts have been created to be set alight. A section of fireproof chain between the dart or meteor head and the rope attaches it securely and Kevlar wicks form the flammable head. Other rope darts have heads filled with LED lights. Both of these can be performed in the dark, adding excitement and mystery.\n\n\n\n"}

At the age of seventeen, Ventura enrolled as a volunteer in the militia of the Kingdom of Italy and later served with Napoleon's imperial army in the Queens's Dragons. After the Battle of Waterloo and Napoleon's, he returned home. In 1817, his revolutionary and Napoleonic sympathies became known to the local authorities following a dispute between him and a member of the reactionary Ducal police. As such, he was obliged to leave the country.\n\nHe went first to Trieste, and then to Constantinople, where he was for a time a ship-broker.\n\nLearning that Persia was seeking the services of European soldiers, he obtained an officer's commission and helped to instruct the forces of the shah in European methods of warfare, soon becoming a colonel. Upon the death of the shah in 1822, Ventura offered his services to his successor, Abbas Mirza. In the latter's service, however, were a number of English officers who were decidedly hostile to the French; they considered Ventura to be French because he had fought under Napoleon. As a result of their political intrigues, Ventura was dismissed. \n\nHe travelled east, ending in Lahore with Jean-François Allard in 1822. They took service with the Maharaja Ranjit Singh of Punjab. In March the following year, they both held command in the Battle of Nowshera, where they defeated a combined Afghan force, resulting in Punjab's capture of Peshawar.\n\nA rebellion having arisen in Afghanistan, Ventura conducted successfully several campaigns of a difficult nature, and greatly enlarged the boundaries of the kingdom of Lahore.\n\nTogether with Allard, Paolo Di Avitabile, and Claude August Court, Ventura formed the group of European mercenary officers responsible for the modernisation of the Sikh army. He also took responsibility for the training and command of the Fauj-i-Khas, the European model brigade. Ventura \"reorganised the infantry into a formidable army including Gurkhas, Pathans, Biharis and Ooriyas.\" He is also described as \"the baron of the Fauj-i-Khas\".\n\nThe Maharaja not only promoted Ventura to the rank of General, but also appointed him \"kazi\" and Governor of Lahore. He rose rapidly in the Darbar and virtually became the Commander in Chief of the Darbar forces.\n\nVentura married an Indian (or a local Armenian according other sources) lady, with whom he had a daughter, but he always longed to return to his native country. In 1837 he went on a diplomatic mission to Paris and London, but was recalled to Lahore before he had time to visit his family.\nHe spent his spare time in Peshawar exhuming Bactrian Greek and Kushan coins from Hindu temples and Buddhist stupas in the Khyber Pass, making numerous excavations then sending the findings on to the Asiatic Society of Bengal in Calcutta. \n\nHe served faithfully under Ranjit Singh and his successors Kharak Singh, Nau Nihal Singh, and Sher Singh. Upon Maharaja Sher Siṅgh's assassination in September 1843, he left the Punjab. \n\nIn France, he presented King Louis Philippe with a set of ancient Greek coins which he had unearthed. These coins were taken as evidence of Alexander the Great's march through Afghanistan and the Sindh-Punjab region of ancient India.\n\nIn his later years he lost a part of his large fortune in unsuccessful commercial enterprises. According to Flaminio Servi, Ventura received baptism toward the end of his life.\n\nHe died on 3 April 1858 in Lardenne, near Toulouse, France.\n\n"}

It is very rare on the Earth's surface, however, it may be a predominant form of silicon dioxide in the Earth, especially in the lower mantle.\n\nStishovite was named after Sergey M. Stishov, a Russian high-pressure physicist who first synthesized the mineral in 1961. It was discovered in Meteor Crater in 1962 by Edward C. T. Chao.\n\nUnlike other silica polymorphs, the crystal structure of stishovite resembles that of rutile (TiO). The silicon in stishovite adopts an octahedral coordination geometry, being bound to six oxides. Similarly, the oxides are three-connected, unlike low-pressure forms of SiO. In most silicates, silicon is tetrahedral, being bound to four oxides. It was long considered the hardest known oxide (~30 GPa Vickers); however, boron suboxide has been discovered in 2002 to be much harder. At normal temperature and pressure, stishovite is metastable.\n\nStishovite can be separated from quartz by applying hydrogen fluoride (HF); unlike quartz, stishovite will not react.\n\nLarge natural crystals of stishovite are extremely rare and are usually found as clasts of 1 to 2 mm in length. When found, they can be difficult to distinguish from regular quartz without laboratory analysis. It has a vitreous luster, is transparent (or translucent), and is extremely hard. Stishovite usually sits as small rounded gravels in a matrix of other minerals.\n\nUntil recently, the only known occurrences of stishovite in nature formed at the very high shock pressures (>100 kbar, or 10 GPa) and temperatures (> 1200 °C) present during hypervelocity meteorite impact into quartz-bearing rock. Minute amounts of stishovite have been found within diamonds, and post-stishovite phases were identified within ultra-high-pressure mantle rocks. Stishovite may also be synthesized by duplicating these conditions in the laboratory, either isostatically or through shock (see shocked quartz).\nAt 4.287 g/cm it is second densest polymorph of silica, after seifertite. It has tetragonal crystal symmetry, P4/mnm, No. 136, Pearson symbol tP6.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1792354", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1792354", "title": "Bundesautobahn 7", "text": "Bundesautobahn 7\n\nThe Bundesautobahn 7 starts at Flensburg and travels through the two states at Schleswig and Rendsburg, through the world's busiest artificial waterway crossing the Rader high bridge. At Rendsburg you can change to the A 210, a feeder to the Schleswig-Holstein capital, Kiel. A few kilometers further south there is another feeder route to Kiel, the A 215, into the A 7 at the interchange Bordesholm. However, this can only be reached from the south, likewise from the A 215 you can only reach the A 7 in the south. South of Bordesholm, the highway has been continuously expanded to six lanes since 2014 due to the high traffic volume to Hamburg. Since 2016 and 2017, several sections have six lanes. Here, the motorway leads past the cities of Neumünster, Bad Bramstedt and Norderstedt, before the hamlet of Schnelsen reaches Hamburg's urban area, and also Hamburg Airport. From the intersection Hamburg-Nordwest, where the A23 branches off towards Heide, the A7 is six lanes, but is currently being expanded to eight lanes.\n\nThe section through the Hamburg city is characterized by an immense volume of traffic, congestion is the order of the day here. There are several reasons for this: the motorway runs through inner-city areas, there is a lot of holiday traffic on the route during school holidays, there are practically no opportunities for bypassing, the speed is permanently limited to 80 km / h as an urban area and the section is extended, South of the equipped with four tubes to two lanes Elbe tunnel leads the A 7 on the highway Elbmarsch, the longest road bridge in Germany, right through the harbor area and the Harburg mountains to Lower Saxony. Via the corner junction A 261 you get to the A 1 to Bremen, at the following Maschener Kreuz on the A 39 to Lüneburg.\n\nGoing through the Hannover from Hamburg, the highway has six lanes, and it was downgraded to the four-lane section between Soltau and Walsrode the hard shoulder can be temporarily released as a third lane. It leads across the Lüneburg Heath, partly with separate directional lanes. At the triangle Walsrode you reach the A 27 to Bremen and a few kilometers to the south, before reaching the capital of Lower Saxony, at the junction Hannover-Nord on the A 352, which connects the airport Hannover and ends at the A 2, which leads to Dortmund. The following motorway junctions of the A 7 provide a connection to the A37 Hanover city center and to Celle or A 2 Ruhrgebiet-Berlin dar. By the Altwarmbüchener Moor the highway leads east to Hanover; at the triangle Hannover-Süd, where the southern branch of the A 37 to the fair Hanover is connected only with the further south part of the A 7.\n\nSouth of Hildesheim, the A 7 enters the low mountain range, the landscape becomes hilly. The Salzgitter triangle also connects only the southern part of the A7 with the A 39 to Braunschweig and Salzgitter. Between the triangle Salzgitter and Göttingen the highway is expanded six-lane. Passing the university town, the A 38 branches off at Dreieck Drammetal to Leipzig. Then the A 7 leads over steep gradients and slopes into the Werratal near Hann. Münden and you are in Hesse.\n\nAt Kassel, it is the largest district, from there you can get on the A44 in the direction of the west to the Ruhr area and in some years, when the extension Kassel-Herleshausen will be completed, also in the direction of Eisenach. Between the interchange Kassel-Ost and the interchange Kassel-Süd, the A7 is being developed eight-lane for a future convergence with the then branching off to the east A44. In Kassel, the unfinished A 49 branches off, which will lead from completed completion to the Ohmtal triangle, which is to be built near Homberg (Ohm) between the junctions Alsfeld-West and Homberg (Ohm) on the A5. Between Kassel and Kirchheim the Knüllgebirge is crossed. The Kirchheim triangle and the Hattenbacher triangle, which are close to each other and quite close to the geographic center of Germany, together form one of the most important motorway junctions of the state. The A 4 leads to the New Länder and Eastern Europe, the A 5 to the Rhine-Main area and on to the border of Switzerland. South of the Hattenbacher triangle is the A 7 sections four-lane expanded, leads past Fulda, where the A 66 branches off to Hanau and reaches Bavarian territory.\n\nCrossing the Rhön, pass Schweinfurt (cross with the A 70 to Bayreuth) and Würzburg to the Biebelried intersection, where the A 3 Ruhrgebiet-Frankfurt am Main-Nürnberg-Passau is crossed. Here was the southern end of the A 7 for a long time. The completion of the south in the 1980s leads past Rothenburg ob der Tauber on the western edge of the Frankenhöhe to the freeway junction Feuchtwangen / Crailsheim (intersection with the A 6 Saarbrücken-Heilbronn-Nuremberg- Waidhaus) and partly Baden-Württemberg area over the Ostalb, for the crossing even two tunnels had to be built, via Aalen to Ulm. At the motorway junction Ulm / Elchingen, the A8 (Luxembourg-Karlsruhe-Stuttgart-Munich-Salzburg) is crossed. South of Ulm it goes through the Illertal parallel to the river back to Bavaria, via Memmingen (cross with the A 96 Lindau Munich) and Kempten (branch to the A 980 to Oberstdorf), over the 2009 completed section through the Reinertshoftunnel to the edge of the foot of the Alps. There, the lane becomes one lane and flows into the border tunnel Füssen to Austria.\n\nThe highway replaced as a trunk connection the imperial or federal roads 76, 77, 205 and 4 (Flensburg-Hamburg), 3 (Hamburg-Kassel) and 27 (Göttingen-Würzburg), which in turn went back to medieval precursors. On the route between Flensburg and Hamburg, for example, it follows the historic Ochsenweg and can be described as its successor in terms of its importance as a trade route from Scandinavia to the south. Plans for a highway from Hamburg to the south were made in the framework of the HaFraBa from 1926. This project is considered to be the predecessor of the A7 between Hamburg and the Hattenbacher Dreieck.\n\nThe first section opened from Göttingen to Bad Hersfeld in 1937. Construction of the section between Bad Hersfeld and Würzburg (Strecke 46) began in 1937 with various bridge structures built however the road wasn't completed before war broke out in 1939 and construction was stopped before being fully abandon in 1940. After World War 2 the route of A 7 was altered leaving some of the abandoned bridge structures of Strecke 46 to be preserved as historic monuments. \n\nFrom the 1950s, the highway was built between the A 1 south of Hamburg and the existing part of the A7 near Göttingen and opened in sections. At the A1 the \"Horster triangle\" was created as the new beginning of the A7. From the south (Hanover) coming vehicles had there at the threading to the A1 in the direction of west (Bremen) drive through a steep curve for many years.\n\nThe section Echte-Seesen was opened on 14 November 1959. The section Seesen Hildesheim was opened on 15 December 1960 by Secretary of Transportation Seebohm.\n\nFrom 1956, the seven sections between Hamburg and Hanover were handed over to traffic. In 1960, the 21km section between junction Berkhof and the cross Hannover / Kirchhorst was opened last.\n\nThe four remaining sections in between were opened in 1958. The gap closure was achieved with the 35 km section between motorway junction Hannover / Kirchhorst and junction Hildesheim in 1962.\n\nIn the 1960s, the A 7 was then built on a slightly different route. The first to be opened in 1965 was the 10.9 km section north of the Biebelried interchange to the junction Würzburg / Estenfeld. 1966 followed the adjacent section to the present cross Schweinfurt / Werneck and the 14.8 km long section between Fulda North and Fulda South. The northernmost section from the Hattenbacher Triangle to Fulda (32 km) and the middle section between Fulda and Schweinfurt (68 km) were finally handed over to traffic in 1968.\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, the highway was built in the Hamburg area and the so-called north axis to Denmark and handed over to traffic. The construction took place in nine sections. An important milestone was the opening of the New Elbe Tunnel in 1975. On 13 July 1976, Ernst Haar, Parliamentary State Secretary of the Federal Ministry of Transport, and Schleswig-Holstein's Minister of the Interior Rudolf Titzck solemnly opened the motorway section from Tarp to Handewitt. Only in 1978, the last vacant space between Tarp and Schuby was closed, so that the highway could be driven from Hamburg to the federal border.\n\nOn 13 June 1978, Queen Margrethe II and President Walter Scheel opened the border crossing Ellund, accompanied by Prime Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg and the Flensburg Mayor Ingrid Gross. At 10.55 clock they officially released the freeway and passport control, at 12.32 clock rolled the first car through the new border crossing. Ellund developed into the most important transit point of German-Danish border traffic. In 1979, 3.2 million travelers passed the counters; until 1997, the number had more than quintupled at 16.7 million.\n\nIn the preliminary draft for a motor vehicle road network of Germany of the study company for automotive road construction (STUFA) of 1926 a highway Würzburg-Ulm-Lindau was provided, detail planning took place from 1935 to 1941. In 1969, the states of Bavaria and Baden-Württemberg were able to agree on a line parallel to the federal highway 19.\n\nFrom 1972 first sections could be released. It started with the Berkheim section to junction Memmingen-Süd (9.4 km) and the first 27.1 km long directional lane between Bad Grönenbach and Kempten-Leubas.\n\nMajor sections were between Kreuz Biebelried and junction Uffenheim-Langensteinach (34.7 km) in 1980, the southern extension to the junction Feuchtwangen (42.1 km) in 1985 and further to the junction Heidenheim (59.6 km) opened in 1987. Since the last 6.8 kilometers to the junction Oy-Mittelberg were already released a year ago, the highway was already passable from Denmark to the Allgäu.\n\nIn 1992, the A 7 was extended by another 4.9 km to Nesselwang. A few meters west of the junction of the same name is the highest motorway point in Germany: \"914.081 m above sea level. NN \".\n\nIn July 1999, the opening of the border tunnel Füssen to Tyrol followed with a tube and two lanes. The tunnel is supposed to relieve the surrounding communities of the high traffic volume during vacation time. In 2005, the northern adjoining first directional lane was opened up to the county road at Gunzenberg. Until September 2009, traffic from the end of the motorway at Nesselwang was routed via various routes for cars and trucks to the border tunnel, which often led to traffic jams.\n\nOn 1 September 2009 was the official inauguration of the last 15-kilometer section, which was released more than a year late. The viaduct Enzenstetten was initially only one-way passable, as the construction-performing consortium could not complete it on time. The second half of the bridge went into operation in December 2010, to the Austrian border.\n\nThe highway is from the Danish border to the Bordesholmer triangle with the A 215 four-lane expanded. To triangle Hamburg northwest with the A 23 are several sections since 2016/2017 six-lane, the remaining four-lobed sections are expected to end of 2019 six lanes expanded. It follows a six-lane section to the junction Hamburg-Bahrenfeld. Thereafter, eight lanes will be available in the Elbtunnels area. In the further course there are again six lanes, between the triangle Hamburg-southwest (A 261) and the Horster triangle (A 1) only four.\n\nBetween Hamburg and Hildesheim, the motorway has six lanes, with the exception of the 40-lane four-lane section between the Soltau-Ost junction and the Walsrode junction (A 27). In this four-lane section can be released with a traffic control system as needed both hard shoulder as each third lane.\n\nIn this area, the highway was in early 2009 despite the heavy traffic largely from only four lanes. Only in a few gradient areas was an additional third lane available. By the end of 2016, several sections were expanded. About half of the road is widened to six lanes.\n\nBetween Nörten-Hardenberg and the Hattenbacher Dreieck, the highway is consistently expanded six-lane. South of Kassel, as well as between the Kirchheim triangle and the Hattenbacher triangle, there is an additional fourth lane on inclines in the direction of travel south. Because of the steep climbs and gradients, the section is known as the Kassel mountains and is considered by motorists to be particularly demanding for trucks and caravans.\n\nThroughout the southern section, the A 7 is four lanes. Only a few sections have more than two strips per directional lane. The highway ends since 1 September 2009 at the border tunnel Füssen. This contains only one tube with one lane per direction. In the area of the valley bridge Enzenstetten the A 7 was only two-lane drivable until the completion of the second bridge in December 2010.\n\nThe A 7 is being upgraded from the Bordesholm motorway intersection to the Hamburg Northwest motorway junction on 65 kilometers from four to six strips. This measure will be realized through a public-private partnership and should cost a total of 600 million euros. The official starting signal for the major project in Schleswig-Holstein was on 1 September 2014. Already in May, preparations were started, especially in Hamburg. The expansion should take place until 2018. On 16 December 2016, Prime Minister Albig released the first section of the 6-lane A7 between the Bordesholm motorway junction and the AS Neumünster-Nord interchange. It has been agreed that the operating company will carry out the remaining work on the six-kilometer stretch between Neumünster and Bordesholm and then transfer it to the state of Schleswig-Holstein. The other 59 kilometers operates and receives the company until 2044. Since March, a 9.9-kilometer section at Großenaspe six-lane expanded. On 7 April 2017, another expanded section was released by Prime Minister Albig. It is about 10 kilometers between the junctions Kaltenkirchen and Quickborn. At the end of the decade the realization of the project can be expected.\n\nAs part of the widening works, the A7 north of the Elbtunnel three covers of the highway are provided in Schnelsen, Stellingen, Othmarschen and Bahrenfeld. The allotments that have existed in the area for 90 years are to be \"relocated\" to these and thus ensure that the districts separated by the motorway grow together again. In addition to 25 hectares of green space and 3000 apartments to be created. The plan approval decision for the six-lane expansion between the triangle Hamburg-Nordwest and Schnelsen was made on 15 December 2012. After the end of the current construction measures, the lids should have a total length of 3.8 kilometers. In addition to 240 million euros from the federal government, 160 to 240 million euros will go to the city of Hamburg for noise control measures.\n\nIn the further demand with planning right the six-lane development of the A 7 over the connection point Soltau-Ost was planned up to the triangle Walsrode. On 30 March 2012, the federal government began planning for the six-lane expansion. The expansion is divided into three sections: triangle Walsrode to Bad Fallingbostel, Bad Fallingbostel to Dorfmark and Dorfmark to Soltau-Ost. For the section triangle Walsrode to Bad Fallingbostel, the plan approval decision was issued on 4 August 2015. Since the end of October there is building law for this section. For 58 million euros were released in December 2015. Construction work began in early 2016 and construction began in August 2016. Construction of this section is expected to be in 2019. For the other two sections the design planning is running.\n\nThe six-lane widening of the sections from Soltau-Ost to Fallingbostel has been classified as an urgent need since 2016. The further eight-lane expansion to the triangle Hannover-Nord is only in the further need. On 29 January 2016, the planning approval procedure was initiated to expand the tank and rest area Allertal and to build the Allertal junction. The short four-lane section to the north of the Salzgitter triangle with the A 39 was upgraded to a priority requirement in 2016 with the amendment of the Fernstraßenausbaugesetz - bottleneck elimination. The continuation to Göttingen is unannounced plan-established, with the exception of the sections between Seesen and Nörten-Hardenberg already finished six-lane expanded and is in the status ongoing and firmly scheduled the highway development law.\n\nFrom June 2012 to June 2013, a public-private partnership (PPP) was examined for the extension of the line between Seesen and Nörten-Hardenberg. According to this audit report of the Federal Court of Auditors, the expansion would not be cheaper in a PPP, but by 12.8 million euros more expensive. The project was awarded with the contract beginning 1 May 2017 to the consortium Via Niedersachsen with the shareholders VINCI Concessions Deutschland GmbH and Meridiam Investments. On 26 August 2015, the planning approval procedure was initiated for the conversion and expansion of the tank and service facility Göttingen with the construction of the Rosdorf exit.\n\nThe section between the future triangle Kassel-Ost and the triangle Kassel-Süd is under construction on eight lanes, since the total traffic of the A 7 and the A 44 shares this route. Construction began in fall 2011 and is expected to be completed in 2022. First, the noise protection is expanded. The additional lanes are created by making lanes and median strips narrower. In the course of the expansion, the refueling and rest area Kassel (-West and -Ost) was dismantled and rebuilt at the location of the Rastanlage Kassel-Ost between 2016 and 2018.\n\nThe A 20 is to be connected at the level Bad Bramstedt via a motorway junction to the A 7. At the south of the Hamburg Elbe Tunnel, the highway to the planned motorway junction Hamburg-Süderelbe with the federal highway 26 is eight stripe to be expanded. This should be implemented by 2022.\n\nCurrent plans of the Federal Ministry of Transport provide an intersection of the A 26 at the future motorway intersection Hamburg-Süderelbe south of the Elbe, where it will continue east through Wilhelmsburg as a so-called port passage to A 1 with a motorway junction Hamburg-Stillhorn. In May 2011, funding was approved by the Federal Ministry of Transport.\n\nTo the east of Würzburg, between Kreuz Schweinfurt / Werneck and Kreuz Biebelried an expansion to six strips in the further need with planning right classified. On 15 June 2016, during the construction of the Schraudenbach valley bridge near Schraudenbach, the shoring collapsed during the concreting of a superstructure section. The accident cost the life of a construction worker. In addition, there were 14 sometimes life-threatening injuries.\n\nThe six-lane widening of the A 7 in the section between the AD Hittistetten and the AS Illertissen was included in the Federal Transport Infrastructure Plan 2030 and the Highway Act as urgent needs, the further expansion to the junction Memmingen-South is added as a further need with planning law.\n\nThrough the Rhön Mountains and Spessart, where the autobahn was known as \"Strecke 46\" (Route 46), some bridges were built as early as 1937, but construction was halted in October 1939 by World War II. In 1954, the \"Strecke 46\" route was abandoned and the final stretch of the A 7 in this area was later built on a slightly different route and finally completed in 1968. The remains of Strecke 46 have been classified as a listed building in 2003 by the government of Bavaria.\n\n"}

The natives were under heavy economical and political pressure from unfair taxes under British rule and were rebelling against as best way they could. Saradiel was accompanied by fellow natives namely Mammale Marikkar, Baya, Hawadiya, Samat etc.\n\nIn order to evade his arrest, Saradiel, decided not to remain in one single place permanently, for the sake of his own safety. While he was thus taking refuge in the homes of his friends, on March 17, 1864, a police team under the command of Head Constable Amath surrounded the house where Saradiel had been hiding, with the help of some of the residents of that area who had given them the tip-off, which resulted in the death on the spot of George Van Haught, a member of the police search party, due to a gunshot wound.\n\nAlso, while Muttusamy and Christian Appu, two of his other accomplices received grievous injuries and two other were slightly injured, while they were thus engaged in the fracas, Saradiel and Mammale Marikkar succeeded in escaping. \nSubsequently, the Police team including Police Sergeant Mahath and Police Constable Sabab, set out on March 21, 1864 to arrest Saradiel on the information given by the informant, one Sirimala. Based on this information, when the Police team surrounded the house belonging to Abdul Cader of Mawenelle searching for Saradiel, he attempted to shoot Sergeant Mahath.\n\nBut Sergeant Mahath outsmarted Saradiel by shooting him first, which resulted in Saradiel falling to the ground from the upstairs where he had been hiding. Due to a gunshot fired from the upstairs by Mammale Marikkar, a member of Saradiel’s gang, the Police Constable Saban was killed. This was the first time ever a police officer died on duty in Sri Lankan Police history and since, March 21 is commemorated as the Police Day.

The population in 2011 was 15,623, in an area of . The Guadiana River flows close to the town of Serpa.\n\nSerpa has its origins in early settlement that preceded the Roman occupation of the Iberian peninsula. The neighbouring town of Beja (known as \"Pax Julia\" by the Romans) became the capital of southern Lusitanian (\"Pacensis\"). Serpa grew through the settlement of Roman colonists, with proof coming from various archaeological remains within the Roman villa.\n\nMoorish settlement followed this period, and remained until the Reconquista (the Christian re-conquest of Iberia).\n\nAs a result of Serpa's proximity to the Spanish border, the town has always been a defensive stronghold. In the 13th century, owing to its location on the left bank of the Guadiana, it was occupied by forces loyal to Castile.\n\nOn 1281, King D. Alfonso X of Castile delimited the municipality, attributing a Foral (\"charter\") to the town, from Seville, in order to encourage settlement and expansion.\n\nFollowing the Reconquista, in 1295, Serpa received a new foral from Portuguese King D. Dinis. The local keep that dominated Serpa was partly damaged as a result of the last Spanish invasion. At that time, the king ordered the re-construction of the castle, as well as the erection of a wall fortification.\n\nA new foral was issued in 1513, by King D. Manuel I, who was the former master of Serpa.\nDuring the 17th century, the walls and system of bastions were adapted to serve as a defensive line by Nicolau de Langres (1665).\nOn 30 January 1954, the walls of Serpa were classified as a \"Monumento Nacional\" (\"National Monument\").\n\nFollowing the Carnation Revolution (in 1974), the Portuguese Communist Party gained strong support in the area, where it continues to be popular.\n\nOn 26 August 2003, the town of Serpa was elevated to city status. Meanwhile, on 28 January 2013, the historic centre of Serpa (that included the principal civil parishes) of São Salvador and Santa Maria, was re-incorporated into a single civil parish (Decree 11-A/2013, Diário da República, Série 1, 19).\n\nAdministratively, the municipality is divided into five civil parishes:\n\nThe area surrounding Serpa consists mostly of farms and cultivated lands of wheat, that have traditionally been the staple of the local economy, employing many people. Due to the area's strong agricultural reliance, the local population has traditionally been agrarian farmers and sheepherders. This has also resulted in the production of its spicy and strong-smelling cheeses, produced in the area and commercialized throughout Portugal. Slightly to the northeast, in the region of Pias, the area cultivates vineyards in order to produce local wines.\n\nOn 27 April 2006, GE Energy Financial Services, PowerLight Corporation and Catavento Lda. announced that they would build one of the world's largest solar photovoltaic power projects at a single site in Serpa. The 11-megawatt solar power station, comprising 52,000 photovoltaic modules, would be built in one of Europe's sunniest areas. The power station was inaugurated on 28 March 2007.\n\nUrban residents of Lisbon, Beja and other cities maintain country homes in Serpa, or take weekend breaks to the area as a result of Serpa's rural location and laid back lifestyle.\n\nOther local and regional specialties include Shepherd's Lamb Stew, a Clam and Pork dish and Sweet Potato Pastries.\n\n"}

The old man advised the Henriques to leave the encampment alone when he heard the bell of the local chapel. Riding off, Henriques was surprised by a ray of light that showed him (in one interpretation) the sign of the cross and Jesus Christ on a crucifix. He knelt in its presence and heard the voice of Jesus Christ telling him he would defeat the Moors. The following day, he succeeded in routing the Moors (through his own courage and faith, as the stories go) and was almost immediately declared the king of Portugal.

In 2011, the population was 7,274, in an area of approximately : it is the sixth-largest municipality in Portugal. Meanwhile, it is the second-lowest population centre by density with approximately 5.62 persons/ (second to the adjacent Alcoutim).\n\nThe seat of the municipality is the town of Mértola, which has around 2800 inhabitants (2011), located on a hill over the Guadiana River. Its strategic location made it an important fluvial commercial port in Classical Antiquity, through the period of Umayyad conquest of Hispania: Mértola's main church (the Church of Nossa Senhora da Anunciação) was the only medieval mosque to have survived the period in Portugal.\n\nIn 2017 Mértola started the process to become a UNESCO World Heritage site.\n\nDuring Classical Antiquity, Mértola was inhabited by Phoenicians, Carthaginians and finally the Romans, who called it \"Myrtilis Iulia\". The strategic location of Mértola, on a hill by the northernmost navigable part of the Guadiana river, was crucial in its early development. Agricultural products grown in the villae nearby and valuable minerals (silver, gold and tin) obtained from the lower Alentejo region were sent from the fluvial port of Mértola via the Guadiana to Southern Hispania and the Mediterranean. Between 1st and 2nd century, Myrtilis, was part of the larger Pacensis region (under the capital Beja/Pax Julia), acquired a great importance, as a dynamic commercial centre, permitting it to mint its own coin. The town was raised to the status of a Municipium in times of Emperor Augustus and was connected to important Roman cities (Beja, Évora) through a road system.\n\nDuring the Migration Period, Mértola was invaded by Germanic tribes of the Sueves and the Visigoths. In this period (5th-8th centuries) commerce was reduced but still active, as evidenced by Greek tombstones from the 6th-7th centuries found in Mértola which suggest the presence of Byzantine merchants in the town.\n\nAround the year 711, Hispania was invaded by the Moors from the Maghreb, inaugurating a period of great influence of Islamic culture in the Alentejo region that would last over 400 years. Mértola - then called \"Martulah\" - and its port played an important economic role in the commerce of agricultural and mineral goods between the Alentejo and other parts of Al-Andalus (Arab Hispania) and Northern Africa.\n\nMértola had a wall dating from Roman times, but the Muslims built new fortifications and, eventually, a castle to protect it from rival Muslim and Christian states. After the fall of the Caliphate of Córdoba, in 1031, Mértola became an independent \"taifa\" state, until it was conquered by the taifa of Seville in 1044-1045. Between 1144 and 1150 the town was again seat of an independent state led by Ibn Qasi, a mystic and skilled military leader who unified Southern Portugal and fought the power of the Almoravides. The independence of the region, however, was soon ended by an invading Almohad army. The most important remnant from the Islamic period in Portugal is Mértola's ancient mosque, built in the second half of the 12th century and later turned into a church, but where many of its original architectural characteristics were preserved.\n\nIn 1238, in the context of the Reconquista, the town was conquered by Portuguese King Sancho II, putting an end on several centuries of Islamic rule in the Mértola region. The town was donated to the Knights of the Order of Santiago, a Military Order that played a vital role in the Christian conquest of Southern Portugal. The seat of the Order was established in Mértola until 1316. From the Reconquista time date most of the castle, including its mighty keep, and a letter of feudal rights (\"foral\"), granted in 1254.The economic importance of Mértola and the Guadiana faded after the Reconquista.\n\nIn the 15th-16th centuries, when the Portuguese conquered several cities in the Maghreb, Mértola experienced a brief revival in its economic relevance, supplying Portuguese troops in Northern Africa with cereals. King Manuel I granted a new foral to the town in 1512.\n\nAfter a long period of economic stagnation, the discovery of copper in the S. Domingos mines led to a new wave of development that would end abruptly in 1965, when the mine was exhausted. In the next decades, the municipality lost much of its population, who emigrated to richer parts of Portugal and other European countries. Starting in the 1980s, a series of archaeological surveys brought to light various remnants of past periods of Mértola, and the town became an important cultural touristic site.\n\nAdministratively, the municipality is divided into 7 civil parishes (\"freguesias\"):\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1792387", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1792387", "title": "Castro Verde", "text": "Castro Verde\n\nCastro Verde () is a town and a municipality of the Alentejo region of Portugal (in the historic district of Beja). The population in 2011 was 7,276, in an area of 569.44 km. Castro Verde is situated in the Baixo Alentejo subregion, within a territory known locally as the \"Campo Branco\" ().\nThe municipality can be recognized by the local municipal markers along its borders, that appear within its borders to denote its reference as \"A Window on the Plains\"; municipal markers appear as stylized house profiles, with an exaggerated window that allows the visitor to see through into the panorama.\n\nThe pre-History of the Baixo Alentejo Subregion dates back to 200,000 B.C. when the territory was crossed by migratory Neanderthal peoples from the north of Europe in the Lower Paleolithic period. Until their extinction, around 28,000 B.C., Neanderthal man hunted and foraged in present-day Portugal. Later, the area was home to several cultures due to the abundance of minerals and its commercial and strategic place along the Mediterranean. The earliest settlements began with Celtiberians, from the central Iberian Peninsula around the 6th Century B.C., and were followed by the Celts. From the 3rd Century, tribal clans were replaced by organized oppidum, a fortified organized city with a defined territory that included many castro villages constructed from large boulders or earthworks.\n\nThe first evidence of early cultures in the area of Castro Verde was the discovery of the 'Syllabary of Espança', which was found near the village of Neves-Corvo in the civil parish of Santa Bárbara de Padrões. This archaeological stone contains a Southwest Paleohispanic script, using Tartessian script and language, identified as being the most ancient paleohispanic script; related to the Phoenician alphabet, it is the closest European connection to the Phoenician culture. The Tartessian culture was the precursors of the Turdetani peoples of the Roman period. Growth of settlements during the classic period were likely associated with the strategic importance of the Iberian Pyrite zone. Castro Verde lies along a transport route linking the mines of Aljustrel (20 km to the north) with the port city of Mértola (40 km to the east) situated on tributaries of the Guadiana river. During the Roman occupation, the extensive mining and warehousing of minerals required protective fortifications and mineral warehouses: in the Castro Verde territory there are remains of more than 20 such small structures. Along with mining activities, the area became a vast area of grain production and cattle/sheep-grazing. The richness and abundance of these combined 'base economies' grew to such extent that Castro Verde became a regional centre of commerce and thus a crossroad of cultures within the Mediterranean area.\n\nThe name origin of \"Castro Verde\" dates back to this early period, with two interpretations cited for its name. One postulates that the name was derived from the Roman \"Castra Castrorum\" and combined the \"verde\" (meaning \"\"green\"\") to indicate \"new\". A more consistent interpretation is that the name was derived from \"Castrum Veteris\", meaning the \"oldest castro\", to differentiate it from another \"castro\" that existed on a small plateau (where the Chapel of São Martinho exists) and was abandoned during the Middle Ages. The term \"castro\" derived from the Latin \"castrum\" refers to a small military encampment or fortification, built of large rocks.\n\nRoman occupation spanned four centuries and was followed by the migration of the Visigoths (300-700 A.C.) their expulsion by the Moors (in 711), and in turn, their expulsion from the area during the Christian Reconquista. The Battle of Ourique, where Afonso I triumphed over five Moorish Kings occurred in São Pedro das Cabeças, approximately five kilometres from the village of Castro Verde, and paved the way for the creation of the Kingdom of Portugal (in the Treaty of Zamora in 1143). As the legend of the Battle describes, the battle lasted two days (between 24–25 July 1139) and was so excessively bloody that the waters of Ribeira de Cobres flowed the color of red. Afonso Henriques who was declared Prince of Portugal, after the Battle of São Mamede, defeated the Moorish kings (at the Battle of Ourique), and was then proclaimed King upon the victory. But, although King Afonso was able to triumph, the region was never definitely secured by the Portuguese until the regin of King Sancho II, around 1234, when the Castle of Aljustrel was captured. Later, the Royal Basilica of Castro Verde was commissioned by King Sebastian of Portugal in 1573 to mark the Christian victory over the Moors, with the walls of the central nave covered in azulejos immortalizing the famous battle.\n\nThe region of Castro Verde passed into the possession of the priory of the Comenda de Santiago, and its donatários, the Dukes of Aveiro. Castro Verde continued to operate as the central administrative centre and municipal seat, while Casével and Entradas won administrative autonomy. While mineral extraction continued to drive the economy, herding assumed a fundamental part of the regions economy as well. During the 16th and 17th Century, the \"Campos de Ourique\" became the destination for many herds from Castela and Serra da Estrela, creating a new economic, social and cultural dimension to the municipality.\n\nAlthough the human ecology of this territory has been marked by the settlement of many civilizations all based on mining, cereal cultivation and cattle/sheep grazing, it was only in the beginning of the 14th century that territories became organized as distinct economic entities within the new kingdom. During this \"post-reconquista\" era, the vast pasture-lands of the Castro Verde area were granted to nobility by King Denis (\"the Farmer King\") which resulted in the management of thousands of hectares under rotational cultivation to become the \"bread basket\" of Portugal and the most important pastureland of the country. Over the centuries, the territory has been continually influenced by a transhumance which has left a unique cultural identity in the form of architecture, arts, music, song, and poetry expressing the daily activities of a people living on the land.\n\nIn the middle of the 19th century, the surrounding municipal districts were reorganized and Castro Verde was formalized within its current boundaries: it had received its town charter (\"Foral\") in 1510 by King Manuel I of Portugal. The municipality of Castro Verde developed its own particular cultural identity based on millenniums of interchange between cultural groups. From roots in mining and agricultural, the community has transformed into a city, with future plans focused on the integration of Roman and Islamic architecture in modern eco-architecture. Cultural tourism has resurged to keep alive traditional art, music and poetry indigenous to the territory. The year 2010 marked year-long festivities to celebrate the 500th anniversary of the town charters of Castro Verde and Casével.\n\nThe Castro Verde area is made up of extensive areas of rolling hills, geomorphological structures referred to as a peneplains, which vary in altitude from 300 to 900 ft (100–300 m.) above sea level. The area has planar relief, with a medium altitude of approximately 200 metres; the lowest point is about 110 metres, in the civil parish of São Marcos da Atabueira, near the Ribeira de Cobres (in northeast frontier with the municipality of Beja). The highest point, at 299 metres, is located at a geodesic marker (Urza) on the Cerro da Bandeira, within the civil parish of Castro Verde. Slopes in this area are between 0-2% grade, although pronounced (15%) along the ravines of Cobres and Maria Delgada, and the vicinity of Ribeira de Oeiras (near the border with Almodôvar). In addition to these rivers, the municipality is crossed by other \"ribeiras\" (English: \"ravines\" or \"rivers\"): Ribeira de Alvacar, Ribeira da Fontinha, Ribeira de Terges, Ribeira da Chada, Ribeira da Sete and Ribeira da Gata.\n\nThe soils within the municipality are considered poor, having a reduced capacity to support agriculture, and thus limiting its productive use historically. The subsoils are made-up of essentially granular schists, greywacke, sandstone, and in some areas quartzite, as well as rare volcanic metamorphic particulates with reduced permeability. Further, the municipality of Castro Verde is crossed by the Iberian Pyrite Belt, composed of a massive volcanogenic sulfide deposit (VMS) associated with the polymetallic flanks of volcanic cones in the form of pyrite, chalcopyrite, sphalerite, galena and cassiterite, that begins in Aljustrel, spreads through the lower Alentejo and extends into southern Spain. At a time when Portugal was separated by the sea from the rest of the Iberian Peninsula, a series of events connected to active and hydrothermal volcanism, lead to the formation of the volcano-sedimentary Pyrite complex (when the landmass of Portugal collided into the Iberian peninsula). Castro Verde lies on one of the most important extractive deposits in Europe, that is responsible for sustaining the economy of the region, albeit an area with elevated risk of erosion. Mining activity, as a consequence, dates back thousands of years, with the remains of Roman mining structures identifying the importance of this area to the expansion of Roman metallurgy. In addition to sulfide ore, this southern area of Lusitania, was an abundant source of other minerals, such as gold, silver, copper, tin, lead and iron.\n\nA large part of the municipality is covered by the European Union's Natura 2000 project; it is denoted as a Special Protection Area (SPA) for endangered species of steppe birds such as the great bustard and lesser kestrel.\n\nThe Atlantic Ocean has little influence in this area where rain falls mainly in autumn and winter, typical of a Mediterranean climate, Csa under the Köppen-Geiger climate classification system, sub-humid, with hot dry summers and mild humid winters. The medium annual temperature falls normally between 15.5 and 16 °C. During the warmer months (June and September) that maximum temperature can reach or exceed 43 °C; during the winter, temperature can fall to 10 °C (between December and March). Medium precipitation levels range around 500 mm, primarily between November and March (the rainy season), while July and August are driest.\n\nCastro Verde Municipality is situated within an area commonly known as “Campo Branco”, within the plains of the Alentejo that front the Serra do Caldeirão. It is located in the district of Beja, and limited to the north by the municipalities of Beja and Aljustrel, south by the municipality of Almodôvar, east by the municipality of Mértola and west by the municipality of Ourique. Over the past few decades, the population has generally concentrated in the larger urban communities. In 1970, the population of the municipality was 9004 inhabitants, decreasing to 7472 by 1981. Ten years later, it had grown slowly to 7786 residents, although the recent census (2001) indicated a small decrease (fixed at 7603 inhabitants). The literacy rates are relatively high, although 15.7% are considered illiterate. This is accentuated by 70% of the resident population having attained only a primary school level of education.\n\nMore than 50% of these residents live in the town of Castro Verde (4820 residents); the remaining towns account for the rest: Casével, 365 inhabitants; Entradas, 774 inhabitants; Santa Bárbara dos Padrões, 1271 inhabitants; and São Marcos da Atabueira, 373 inhabitants. With an area 567.2 km2, these communities are scattered in various medium to small localities divided into four civil parishes (Portuguese: \"freguesias\"):\n\n\nPopulation growth has primarily been the result developments with the mining industry, and in particular the Neves-Corvo mining complex. Its activities, and related services, civil construction and public works have seen reciprocal growth in municipal services and population. There has also been a parallel growth in mining jobs related to this development, since 1979.\n\nThere is a hierarchical distribution of the active workforce: 11.12% are employed in the primary sector, 32.7% in secondary industries, while a majority (56.18%) are employed in tertiary services. This distribution is generally maintained in all communities in the municipality, except Santa Bárbara dos Padrões, where the Neves-Corvo mine is the main employer, and Entradas, where some agriculture and ranching occur.\n\nCastro Verde is located in a privileged location along a corridor that connects the northern districts to the Algarve, and fundamental access to communication lines:\n\nThe airports in Faro (100 km), Lisbon (190 km) and Sevilha (270 km) and the maritime port of Sines (95 km) are conveniently located to access other major centres.\n\nConnections to other locations within the country are made through the road network: to the Litoral Alentejo through Ourique (E.N. 123); to the coastal Algarve (along the A2 and I.C.1); to Lisbon via the A2; to Mértola (on the E.N. 123); to Almodôvar (along the E.N.2); and to Beja and Évora (on the I.P.2).\n\nWithin the municipality, public transport connects all localities by at least one service (except on the weekends), and a national Express service connects Castro Verde communities to stations in Beja, Évora, Lisbon and Algarve, in addition to Tomar, Coimbra, Porto, Braga and Elvas.\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes\n\nSources\n"}

The first document relating to him is dated 3 December 1353, when he purchased the freedom of London. In February 1356 he was sufficiently well known as a mason that he was chosen as one of a commission of six cutting masons who were to inform the mayor and aldermen about the acts and articles of the craft.\n\nHis first connection with royal building works was probably when he was contracted from March 1357 to September 1359 to remodel the Black Prince's manor at Kennington, at the cost of £221 4s. 7d. On 23 June 1360, he was appointed \"disposer\" of the royal works at the Palace of Westminster and the Tower of London. For this he was paid 1s. per day, although he continued undertaking other, non-royal, commissions.\n\nAt the Palace of Westminster, Yevele was responsible for refacing Westminster Hall, and for two essentially utilitarian buildings, the Jewel Tower in the Privy Palace (1365–6) and the clock tower (now destroyed), which stood opposite the north door of Westminster Hall and regulated the sittings of the royal courts of justice there (1366–7).\n\nAt the Tower of London, Yevele was responsible for the Bloody Tower, while several minor works, including the vaulting of the thirteenth-century watergate, were performed by Henry's brother, Robert. The real focus of activity in the king's works at this time, however, was Windsor Castle. The master mason there, John Sponlee (d. 1382?), walked in the funeral procession of Queen Philippa in 1369 as an esquire of greater estate, whereas Yevele ranked only as a lesser esquire. During Edward III's reign Yevele's strictly architectural work for the crown was, with one minor exception, confined to London, but he supplied materials to numerous royal building sites in Kent and Surrey as well as in London.\n\nThe most significant of Yevele's remaining works are the naves of Westminster Abbey (1362) and Canterbury Cathedral (1377–1400), the latter completed in an early Perpendicular Gothic style.\n\nYevele advised on repairs and new works at the castles of Southampton (1378–9), Carisbrooke (1380–85), Winchester (1390–1400), and Portchester (1384–5), and on the town walls of Canterbury (1385–6), but it is uncertain to what extent this involved him in major design work. In 1381, 1389, and 1393 Yevele's advice was sought by William of Wykeham, bishop of Winchester, who had been clerk of works at Windsor Castle from 1356 to 1361. On 29 August 1390 Yevele was made exempt from jury and other forms of service on account of his official duties and \"great age\".\n\nYevele's work for other lay patrons belonged to the 1370s and 1380s. For John of Gaunt he carried out in 1375 unspecified works at the Savoy Palace in London and, together with another mason, Thomas Wrek, he contracted for the duke's large and very sumptuous canopied tomb in Old St Paul's Cathedral. For John de Cobham, 3rd Baron Cobham, he furnished the design (\"devyse\") for a new south aisle at the London parish church of St Dunstan-in-the-East, although he did not take charge of its building. From 1368 he served as one of the two wardens of London Bridge. Although the wardenships were purely administrative, it is highly likely that he was the designer of the two-storeyed apsidal chapel of St Thomas, which projected eastwards from the middle of the bridge and which was under construction between 1384 and 1397. The chapel possessed a \"table\" or handboard containing a summary history of the bridge, which was the source of the statement by the 16th-century antiquary John Leland that \"a mason beinge master of the bridge howse\", built the chapel at his own expense. This notice can refer only to Yevele, whose name presumably meant nothing to Leland.\n\nYevele died in 1400 and was buried at the church of St Magnus the Martyr by London Bridge. His monument was extant in John Stow's time (the late 16th century), but was probably destroyed by the Great Fire of London.\n\nWorks that can be attributed to Yevele with a reasonable level of certainty include:\n\n\n"}

Written by Doug Petrie and directed by James A. Contner, it originally aired on November 16, 1999 on the WB network. In \"The Initiative\", Spike is imprisoned in an underground demon-research facility, and Riley realizes he has a crush on Buffy.\n\nRiley and a couple of friends, Forest and Graham, watch Buffy as she manages to make a mess of the soda machine and yogurt machine. They comment on what a catch she is, and how interested they all are, but Riley is reluctant to make fun.\n\nGiles and Xander discover the commando guys are human and that their help will not be needed, again. Buffy arrives and while Giles tells her to patrol, she says she's going to party with Willow and hopefully cheer her up. Giles and Xander decided to patrol for her. \n\nSpike, having been knocked out by a Taser at the beginning of the previous episode, wakes up in a facility where various types of demons are held captive behind electrically charged barriers. A packet of blood drops from the ceiling into Spike's cell but before he drinks it, a vampire in the next cell - Tom, captured in \"The Freshman\" - warns him that doctors starve the vampires and then feed them drugged blood before doing experiments on them. Spike is quick to blame the Slayer for his misfortune.\n\nIn class, Willow asks about Oz but Riley says he dropped out. After Willow tries to tell him that Oz will return, Professor Walsh informs her that he won't be back to her class, whereupon Willow abruptly leaves, saddened. Buffy approaches the professor, and tells her off, prompting Walsh to comment to Riley that she likes her.\n\nForrest asks Parker about Buffy, and when Parker vulgarly brags about having sex with her, Riley punches him. Riley then realizes he likes Buffy. He visits Willow and asks her advice in wooing Buffy; Willow, still emotionally distressed, questions his motives, but eventually relents, listing some of Buffy's likes and interests.\n\nSpike lies on the floor of his cell, pretending to have drunk the drugged blood, and when the doctors come to get him he attacks. He escapes the Initiative and returns to Harmony's lair, telling her he's \"back for good\" - then immediately leaves to kill the Slayer. Xander later discovers Harmony crying, burning some of Spike's things. The two get into an inept slap-fight, and then mutually agree to stop. Harmony lets Xander know that Spike is back.\n\nAt the party, Willow tries to help Riley flirt with Buffy, but his attempts are thwarted when Xander arrives to inform Buffy that Spike has returned. Riley is also called away; he and Forest break away from the party and, after passing through several electronic checkpoints, go down a hidden elevator to the underground facility where Spike had been held. The operation's head, Professor Walsh, informs them that \"Hostile 17\" (Spike) has escaped, and the guys suit up. Riley gives orders to three teams that he sends out all over Sunnydale to find Spike.\n\nRiley's team spots Buffy sitting on a bench. Riley refuses to allow the team to use her as bait and goes out to get rid of her. Each unaware of the other's secret identity, Riley and Buffy try to send each other out of harm's way.\n\nMeanwhile, Spike has found Buffy's dorm through the school computer system. Willow, moping in her room, hears a knock on the door and invites the person in without thinking. Spike swaggers through the door and attempts to bite Willow, but is stopped by an intense pain in his head. After a short, calm dialogue with multiple metaphorical references to impotence (ex: \"I know I'm not the kind of girl vamps like to sink their teeth into. It's always like 'Ooh, you're like a sister to me,' or 'Oh, you're such a good friend.'\" \"Don't be ridiculous. I'd bite you in a heartbeat.\"), Willow hits him with a lamp and runs out just as Riley and friends cut the power and then work their way up to the dorm room. They capture Spike but, while they consider whether to take Willow or not, Spike breaks free. Buffy arrives and fights Riley and his friends while Spike manages to escape through a window. Unable to make out the identity of their attacker, Riley orders them to retreat.\n\nProfessor Walsh is not happy with what happened or with Riley's report on the event. It is revealed that Spike cannot harm a human without feeling pain in his head thanks to an implant they placed there. Riley catches up with Buffy and they talk. Buffy tells him he's a little peculiar, a term used by Riley before he realized he liked Buffy, and he responds that he can \"live with that\".\n\nThe vast set for the Initiative, revealed for the first time in this episode, was filmed at a Skunk Works facility, in a location where stealth aircraft have previously been manufactured. When describing the set, writer Doug Petrie said he was told by Whedon to \"go big. Use your imagination. Do it, go there. This is a big budget movie.\"\n\nIn the commentary for this episode, Douglas Petrie reveals that after Spike attacks Willow in her dorm room and the scene immediately cuts to commercial after a fleeting glimpse of the corridor outside with people who fail to hear Willow's screams, he wanted viewers to believe that Willow had actually been killed.\n\nActress Mercedes McNab says the hair-pulling, shin-kicking fight with Xander was \"actually one of my favorite on-screen fights.\" When asked if she had a stunt double, she responded \"No, it was all me\", but \"we wore knee pads and shin guards... which was kind of ridiculous seeing it was just such a cheesy fight.\"\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1792393", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1792393", "title": "Einiosaurus", "text": "Einiosaurus\n\nEiniosaurus was a medium-sized herbivorous centrosaurine ceratopsian dinosaur from the Upper Cretaceous (Campanian stage) of northwestern Montana. The name means 'buffalo lizard', in a combination of Blackfeet Indian \"eini\" and Latinized Ancient Greek \"sauros\"; the specific name (\"procurvicornis\") means 'with a forward-curving horn' in Latin.\n\n\"Einiosaurus\" is an exclusively Montanan dinosaur, and all of its known remains are currently held at the Museum of the Rockies in Bozeman, Montana. At least fifteen individuals of varying ages are represented by three adult skulls and hundreds of other bones from two low-diversity, monospecific (one species) bonebeds, which were discovered by Jack Horner in 1985 and excavated from 1985 to 1989 by Museum of the Rockies field crews. \n\nHorner had not been searching for horned dinosaurs. In the spring of 1985 he had been informed by landowner Jim Peebles that he would no longer be allowed access to the Willow Creek \"Egg Mountain\" site where during six years a nesting colony of \"Maiasaura\" had been excavated. This forced Horner to find an alternative site because supplies had already been bought for a new summer season and fourteen volunteers and students expected to be employed by him. He investigated two sites, Devil's Pocket and Red Rocks, that however proved to contain too few fossils. For some years, since 1982, Horner had requested from the Blackfeet Indian Tribal Council access to the Landslide Butte site. The field notes of Charles Whitney Gilmore from the 1920s indicated that dinosaur eggs could be found there. The council had consistently turned down his requests because they feared widespread disturbance of the reservation. However, one of its members, Marvin Weatherwax, had earlier in 1985 observed that an excavation by Horner of a mosasaurid in the Four Horns Lake had caused only limited damage to the landscape. In early July, the council granted Horner access to the entire reservation.\n\nEarly in August, Horner's associate Bob Makela discovered the Dino Ridge Quarry, containing extensive ceratopid remains, on the land of farmer Ricky Reagan. Continual rainfall hampered operations that year. On 20 June 1986, a crew of sixteen returned to reopen the quarry. A large and dense concentration of bones, a bonebed, was excavated, with up to forty bones per square metre being present. This was interpreted as representing an entire herd that had perished. In late August 1986, Horner and preparator Carrie Ancell on the land of Gloria Sundquist discovered a second horned dinosaur site, at one mile distance from the first, called the Canyon Bone Bed, in which two relatively complete skulls were dug up. The skulls had to be removed from a rather steep cliff and weighed about half a tonne when plastered. They were airlifted by a Bell UH-1 Iroquois of the United States Army National Guard into trucks to be transported. The aberrant build of these skulls first suggested to Horner that they might represent an unknown taxon. Unexpectedly benefiting from a grant of $204,000 by the MacArthur Fellows Program, Horner was able to reopen the two bonebed quarries in 1987. That year almost all fossils were removed that could be accessed without using mechanised earth-moving equipment. Also, an additional horned dinosaur skull was excavated from a somewhat younger layer. In 1988, more ceratopid material was found in a more southern site, the Blacktail Creek North. In the second week of June 1989, student Scott Donald Sampson in the context of his doctoral research with a small crew reopened the Canyon Bone Bed, while Patrick Leiggi that summer with a limited number of workers restarted excavating the Dino Ridge Quarry. The same year, Horner himself found more horned dinosaur fossils at the Blacktail Creek North. In 1990, the expeditions were ended because the reservation allowed access to commercial fossil hunters who quickly strip-mined sites with bulldozers, through a lack of proper documentation greatly diminishing the scientific value of the discoveries.\n\nAt the time of the expeditions, it was assumed that all horned dinosaur fossils found in the reservation belonged to a single species, especially as they came from a limited geological time period, its duration estimated at about half a million years. In the 1920s, George Freyer Sternberg had already found ceratopid bones there, that were named as a second species of \"Styracosaurus\": \"Styracosaurus ovatus\". The material had been rather limited and the validity of this species had been doubted, some considering it a \"nomen dubium\". The abundant new remains seemed to prove that the species was real, also because it clearly differed from the type species of \"Styracosaurus\", \"Styracosaurus albertensis\". The comprehensive taphonomic study by Raymond Robert Rogers from 1990 however, did not commit itself fully to this identification, merely mentioning a \"Styracosaurus\" sp. Rogers had joined the expedition in 1987. This reflected the fact that the expedition members had started to take the possibility into account that the species was completely new to science, informally referring to it as \"Styracosaurus makeli\" in honour of Bob Makela, who had died in a traffic accident in June 1987. In 1990, this name, as an invalid \"nomen nudum\" because it lacked a description, appeared in a photo caption in a book by Stephen Czerkas.\n\nHorner was an expert on the Hadrosauridae, several sites of which had also been discovered in Landslide Butte, including the juveniles and eggs that were the focus of his research. He had less affinity for other kinds of dinosaurs. In 1987 and 1989, to resolve the \"Styracosaurus\" question, horned dinosaur specialist Peter Dodson was invited to investigate the new ceratopsian finds. In 1990, the fossil material was seen by Dodson as strengthening the case for the validity of a separate \"Styracosaurus ovatus\", to be distinguished from \"Styracosaurus albertensis\".\n\nHorner had gradually changed his mind on the subject. While still thinking that a single population of horned dinosaurs had been present, he began to see it as a chronospecies, an evolutionary series of taxa. In 1992, he described them in an article as three \"transitional taxa\" that had spanned the gap between the older \"Styracosaurus\" and the later \"Pachyrhinosaurus\". He deliberately declined to name these three taxa. The oldest form was indicated as \"Transitional Taxon A\", mainly represented by skull MOR 492. Then came \"Taxon B\" – the many skeletons of the Dinosaur Ridge Quarry and the Canyon Bone Bed. The youngest was \"Taxon C\", represented by skull MOR 485 found in 1987 and the horned dinosaur fossils of the Blacktail Creek North.\n\nIn 1994, Sampson, in a talk during the annual meeting of the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology, named Horner's \"Taxon B\" as a new genus and species, \"Einiosaurus procurvicornis\". Although an abstract was published containing a sufficient description, making the name valid, it did not yet identify by inventory number a holotype, a name-bearing specimen. The same abstract named Type C as \"Achelousaurus horneri\". In 1995, Sampson published a larger article, indicating the holotype. The generic name \"Einiosaurus\" is derived from the Blackfeet \"eini\", \"American bison\", and Latinised Greek \"saurus\", \"lizard\". The name was chosen to honour the Blackfeet tribe but also to reflect the fact that ceratopids were, in Sampson's words, \"the buffalo of the Cretaceous\", living in herds and having a complex life. According to Sampson, the name should be pronounced as \"eye-knee-o-saurus\". The specific name is derived from Latin \"procurvus\", \"bent forwards\", and \"cornu\", \"horn\", referring to the forwards curving nasal horn.\n\nThe holotype, MOR 456-8-9-6-1, was found in a layer of the Two Medicine Formation dating from the late Campanian. It consists of a partial skull, including the nasal horn, the supraorbital area and part of the parietal bone of the skull frill. The skull represents an adult individual. Sampson referred many other specimens to the species. He indicated that additional fossil material from the Canyon Bone Bed had been subsumed under the inventory number MOR 456. This included two further adult skulls and single cranial and postcranial bones from individuals of varying age classes. Furthermore, the fossils from the Dino Ridge Quarry were referred. They had been catalogued within number MOR 373. They consisted of about two hundred non-articulated bones, again from animals of different ages.\n\nIn 2010, Paul renamed \"E. procurvicornis\" into \"Centrosaurus procurvicornis\", but this has found no acceptance, subsequent research invariably referring to the taxon as \"Einiosaurus\".\n\n\"Einiosaurus\" was a herbivorous dinosaur. It is generally as large as \"Achelousaurus\", though far less robust. In 2010, Gregory S. Paul estimated the body length of \"Einiosaurus\" at 4.5 meters, its weight at 1.3 tonnes. Both taxa fall within the typical size range of the Centrosaurinae.\nIn 1995, Sampson indicated several distinguishing traits. The nasal horn has a base that is long from front to rear, is transversely flattened, and is strongly curved forwards in some adult specimens. The supraorbital \"brow\" horns as far as they are present are low and rounded with a convex surface on the inner side. The parietal parts of the rear edge of the skull frill together bear a single pair of large curved spikes sticking out to behind.\n\n\"Einiosaurus\" differs from all other known Centrosaurinae by a longer-based and more procurved nasal horn and by a supraorbital horn that is longer-based and more rounded in side view. It differs from \"Achelousaurus\" in particular in having large parietal spikes that are not directed sideways to some extent.\n\nAs a centrosaurine, \"Einiosaurus\" walked on all fours, had a large head with a beak, a moderately large skull frill, a short powerful neck, heavily muscled forelimbs, a high torso, powerful hindlimbs and a relatively short tail.\n\nIn 1995, Sampson only described the skull, not the postcrania, the parts behind the skull. This was motivated by the fact that in centrosaurines the postcranial skeleton is \"conservative\", i.e. differs only slightly among species. Sampson could not find traits in which \"Einiosaurus\" differed from a generalised centrosaurine.\nThe holotype skull is the largest known and has a total length of 156 centimetres. The snout is relatively narrow and pointed. The top of the snout is formed by the paired nasal bones. Their top surfaces together bear the core of the nasal horn. In 1995, apart from the skulls eight nasal horns from both bonebeds were referred to \"Einiosaurus\". Two of these were from subadults. These show how the horn developed during the growth of the animal. The initially separated core halves fused from the tip downwards and joined into a single structure on the midline. In the subadult stage, the core still showed a suture, however. The subadult cores were transversely flattened and relatively small, not higher than twelve centimetres. Six cores were of adults. They showed two distinctive types. Two cores were small and erect, i.e. vertically directed. The four others were large and procurved, strongly curving to the front. The adult hornes resembled the subadult ones in being transversely compressed and having a long base from front to rear. To behind they nearly reached the frontal bones.\n\nSampson compared the nasal horn of \"Einiosaurus\" with the horns of two related species, \"Centrosaurus\" and \"Styracosaurus\". From large bonebeds, numerous nasal horns of \"Centrosaurus\" are known, presenting a considerable range of morphologies. Despite all this variation, \"Einiosaurus\" horns can be clearly distinguished from them. They are more laterally compressed, unlike the more oval cross-section of \"Centrosaurus\" horns. The adult horns are also much more procurved than any nasal horn found in \"Centrosaurus\" beds. \"Styracosaurus\" horncores are much longer than those of \"Einiosaurus\", up to half a metre in length, and erect or slightly recurved to the rear.\n\nApart from a horn on the snout, centrosaurines also had horns above the eye sockets, supraorbital horncores. These cores were formed by a fusion of the postorbital bone with the much smaller palpebral bone in front of it. Nine subadult or adult \"brow horns\" were found. They all shared the same build in being low, long and rounded. This differs from the usual pointed horns with an oval base seen in typical centrosaurines. It is also unlike the supraorbital bosses seen in \"Achelousaurus\" and \"Pachyrhinosaurus\". Nevertheless, some \"Einiosaurus\" horns seemed to approach bosses. Three older individuals featured a total of five instances in which the horn as such was replaced by a low rounded mass, sometimes with a large pit in the usual location of the horn point. The large holotype has a rounded mass above the left eye socket but a pit, eighty-five millimetres long and sixty-four millimetres wide, on the right side. According to Sampson, this reflects a general trend with centrosaurines to re-absorb the brow horns in later life. All known specimens of \"Styracosaurus\" e.g. have a pitted region instead of true horns. The \"Einiosaurus\" holotype additionally has a rough bone mass at the rear postorbital region on the left side. In all centrosaurines, the frontal bones re folded in such a way that a \"double\" roof is formed with a \"supracranial cavity\" in between. A fontanelle pierces the upper layer. In \"Einiosaurus\", this cavity runs sideways, continuing to below into the brow horn. With \"Centrosaurus\" and \"Styracosaurus\" these passages are more narrow and do not reach the horns but \"Pachyrhinosaurus\" shows a comparable extension. Sampson in 1995 also expounded his general views on such skull roofs, which are not easy to interpret due to fusion. According to him, the frontal bones always extended to the parietals, so that the paired postorbitals never contacted. The parietal bone made only a small contribution to the fontanelle. The floor of the cavity is, at the frontal-parietal suture, pierced by a large foramen into the braincase, the function of this \"pineal opening\" being unknown.\n\nIts snout is narrow and very pointed. It is typically portrayed with a low, strongly forward and downward curving nasal horn that resembles a bottle opener, though this may only occur in some adults. The supraorbital (over-the-eye) horns are low, short and triangular in top view if present at all, as opposed to the chasmosaurines, such as \"Triceratops\", which have prominent supraorbital horns. A pair of large spikes, the third epiparietals, projects backwards from the relatively small frill. Smaller osteoderms adorn the frill edge. The first epiparietals are largely absent.\n\nThe placement of \"Einiosaurus\" within Centrosaurinae is problematic due to the transitional nature of several of its skull characters, and its closest relatives are either \"Centrosaurus\" and \"Styracosaurus\" or \"Achelousaurus\" and \"Pachyrhinosaurus\". The latter hypothesis is supported by Horner and colleagues, where \"Einiosaurus\" is the earliest of an evolutionary series in which the nasal horns gradually change to rough bosses, as in \"Achelousaurus\" and \"Pachyrhinosaurus\" which are the second and third in this series. The frills also grow in complexity.\n\nRegardless of which hypothesis is correct, \"Einiosaurus\" appears to occupy an intermediate position with respect to the evolution of the centrosaurines.\nThe cladogram presented below follows a phylogenetic analysis by Chiba \"et al.\" (2017):\n\nLow-diversity and single-species bonebeds are thought to represent herds that may have died in catastrophic events, such as during a drought or flood. This is evidence that \"Einiosaurus\", as well as other centrosaurine ceratopsians such as \"Pachyrhinosaurus\" and \"Centrosaurus\", were herding animals similar in behavior to modern-day bison or wildebeest. In contrast, ceratopsine ceratopsids, such as \"Triceratops\" and \"Torosaurus\", are typically found singly, implying that they may have been somewhat solitary in life, though fossilized footprints may provide evidence to the contrary. In 2010, a study by Julie Reizner of the individuals excavated at the Dino Ridge site concluded that \"Einiosaurus\" grew quickly until its third to fifth year of life after which growth slowed, probably at the onset of sexual maturity.\n\nLike all ceratopsids, \"Einiosaurus\" had a complex dental battery capable of processing even the toughest plants. \"Einiosaurus\" lived in an inland habitat.\n\n\"Einiosaurus\" fossils are found in the upper part of the Two Medicine Formation of Montana, dating to the mid-late Campanian stage of the late Cretaceous Period, about 74.5 million years ago. Dinosaurs that lived alongside \"Einiosaurus\" include the basal ornithopod \"Orodromeus\", hadrosaurids (such as \"Hypacrosaurus\", \"Maiasaura\", and \"Prosaurolophus\"), the ankylosaurs \"Edmontonia\" and \"Euoplocephalus\", the tyrannosaurid \"Daspletosaurus\" (which appears to have been a specialist of preying on ceratopsians), as well as the smaller theropods \"Bambiraptor\", \"Chirostenotes\", \"Troodon\", and \"Avisaurus\". \"Einiosaurus\" lived in a climate that was seasonal, warm, and semi-arid. Other fossils found with the \"Einiosaurus\" material include freshwater bivalves and gastropods, which imply that these bones were deposited in a shallow lake environment.\n\n\n\n"}

They are currently members of the and play at the Wallace Binder Ground.\n\nMaldon Town Football Club was established in August 1946 as part of the Maldon Social and Athletic Club. The club initially joined Division Two of the Chelmsford & Mid-Essex League. Although they transferred to the North Essex League the following season, the club returned to the Chelmsford & Mid-Essex League in 1949. They were Premier Division champions in 1949–50, retaining the title the following season, as well as winning the League Cup. The club then joined the Essex & Suffolk Border League for the 1951–52 season, finishing as runners-up in the Premier Division and losing the League Cup final. They were Premier Division runners-up again in 1955–56 and 1959–60.\n\nIn 1964–65 Maldon won the League Cup and the following season they were Premier Division champions. The club then moved up to the Eastern Counties League. They finished in the bottom half of the Eastern Counties League every season until leaving to join the Essex Senior League in 1972. The club won the Essex Senior League in the 1984–85 on goal difference. In 1996 they rejoined the Eastern Counties League, becoming members of Division One. In the 1997–98 season the club were runners-up and were promoted to the Premier Division. \n\nMaldon reached the semi-finals of the FA Vase in 2002–03, losing 3–0 on aggregate to AFC Sudbury, with the home leg attracting a record Wallace Binder Ground crowd of 1,163. The 2003–04 season saw the club finish as runners-up in the Premier Division, earning promotion to the Eastern Division of the Southern League. A third-place finish the following season led to them qualifying for the promotion play-offs; after beating Barking & East Ham United 3–2 on penalties in the semi-finals, they defeated Uxbridge in the final by the same scoreline and were promoted to the Premier Division of the Isthmian League. However, the club's first season in the division saw them finish in the bottom three, resulting in relegation to Division One North. Although they finished fourth in Division One North in 2006–07, they were ineligible for promotion and not allowed to take part in the play-offs.\n\nIn September 2009, Maldon Town were taken over by Tiptree United chairman Ed Garty, with both clubs playing at Maldon's ground. It was announced in April 2010 that Maldon Town would be rebranded as Maldon & Tiptree Football Club, with Tiptree United withdrawing from the Essex Senior League; a new blue and red striped kit was revealed ahead of the 2010–11 season. In 2012–13 they were runners-up in Division One North; in the subsequent play-offs the club defeated Aveley 3–1 in the semi-finals before losing 4–1 on penalties to Thamesmead Town in the final after the match had ended 2–2. They were Division One North runners-up again in 2016–17, beating Haringey Borough 5–4 in the play-off semi-finals and then losing 1–0 to Thurrock in the final. A third-place finish in the renamed North Division in 2018–19 resulted in another play-off campaign. After beating Coggeshall Town 1–0 in the semi-finals, they lost the final 3–0 on penalties to local rivals Heybridge Swifts following a 2–2 draw.\n\nIn 2019–20 Maldon & Tiptree reached the first round proper of the FA Cup for the first time in their history. After defeating League Two club Leyton Orient 2–1 in the first round, they lost 1–0 at home to another League Two club, Newport County, in the second.\n\nThe club initially played home games at Sadd's Ground on The Causeway. Between 1947 and 1950 they played at the Promenade before acquiring a new ground in Farmbridge Road, where they remained until 1994. The club then moved to their current Wallace Binder Ground in Park Drive. The ground has a seated stand on one side of the pitch and a covered standing area behind one goal.\n\nA record attendance at the Wallace Binder Ground was set in 2003 when 1,163 watched the FA Vase semi-final against AFC Sudbury. This was broken for the FA Cup match against Newport County, which attracted a crowd of 1,876.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1792433", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1792433", "title": "Maximum a posteriori estimation", "text": "Maximum a posteriori estimation\n\nIn Bayesian statistics, a maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) estimate is an estimate of an unknown quantity, that equals the mode of the posterior distribution. The MAP can be used to obtain a point estimate of an unobserved quantity on the basis of empirical data. It is closely related to the method of maximum likelihood (ML) estimation, but employs an augmented optimization objective which incorporates a prior distribution (that quantifies the additional information available through prior knowledge of a related event) over the quantity one wants to estimate. MAP estimation can therefore be seen as a regularization of ML estimation.\n\nAssume that we want to estimate an unobserved population parameter formula_1 on the basis of observations formula_2. Let formula_3 be the sampling distribution of formula_2, so that formula_5 is the probability of formula_2 when the underlying population parameter is formula_1. Then the function:\n\nis known as the likelihood function and the estimate:\n\nis the maximum likelihood estimate of formula_1.\n\nNow assume that a prior distribution formula_11 over formula_1 exists. This allows us to treat formula_1 as a random variable as in Bayesian statistics. We can calculate the posterior distribution of formula_1 using Bayes' theorem:\n\nwhere formula_11 is density function of formula_1, formula_18 is the domain of formula_11.\n\nThe method of maximum a posteriori estimation then estimates formula_1 as the mode of the posterior distribution of this random variable:\n\nThe denominator of the posterior distribution (so-called marginal likelihood) is always positive and does not depend on formula_1 and therefore plays no role in the optimization. Observe that the MAP estimate of formula_1 coincides with the ML estimate when the prior formula_11 is uniform (that is, a constant function).\n\nWhen the loss function is of the form\n\nas formula_26 goes to 0, the Bayes estimator approaches the MAP estimator, provided that the distribution of formula_1 is quasi-concave. But generally a MAP estimator is not a Bayes estimator unless formula_1 is discrete.\n\nMAP estimates can be computed in several ways:\n\nWhile only mild conditions are required for MAP estimation to be a limiting case of Bayes estimation (under the 0–1 loss function), it is not very representative of Bayesian methods in general. This is because MAP estimates are point estimates, whereas Bayesian methods are characterized by the use of distributions to summarize data and draw inferences: thus, Bayesian methods tend to report the posterior mean or median instead, together with credible intervals. This is both because these estimators are optimal under squared-error and linear-error loss respectively - which are more representative of typical loss functions - and because the posterior distribution may not have a simple analytic form: in this case, the distribution can be simulated using Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques, while optimization to find its mode(s) may be difficult or impossible.\n\nIn many types of models, such as mixture models, the posterior may be multi-modal. In such a case, the usual recommendation is that one should choose the highest mode: this is not always feasible (global optimization is a difficult problem), nor in some cases even possible (such as when identifiability issues arise). Furthermore, the highest mode may be uncharacteristic of the majority of the posterior.\n\nFinally, unlike ML estimators, the MAP estimate is not invariant under reparameterization. Switching from one parameterization to another involves introducing a Jacobian that impacts on the location of the maximum.\n\nAs an example of the difference between Bayes estimators mentioned above (mean and median estimators) and using a MAP estimate, consider the case where there is a need to classify inputs formula_2 as either positive or negative (for example, loans as risky or safe). Suppose there are just three possible hypotheses about the correct method of classification formula_30, formula_31 and formula_32 with posteriors 0.4, 0.3 and 0.3 respectively. Suppose given a new instance, formula_2, formula_30 classifies it as positive, whereas the other two classify it as negative. Using the MAP estimate for the correct classifier formula_30, formula_2 is classified as positive, whereas the Bayes estimators would average over all hypotheses and classify formula_2 as negative.\n\nSuppose that we are given a sequence formula_38 of IID formula_39 random variables and a priori distribution of formula_40 is given by formula_41. We wish to find the MAP estimate of formula_40. Note that the normal distribution is its own conjugate prior, so we will be able to find a closed-form solution analytically.\n\nThe function to be maximized is then given by\n\nwhich is equivalent to minimizing the following function of formula_40:\n\nThus, we see that the MAP estimator for μ is given by\n\nwhich turns out to be a linear interpolation between the prior mean and the sample mean weighted by their respective covariances.\n\nThe case of formula_47 is called a non-informative prior and leads to an ill-defined a priori probability distribution; in this case formula_48\n\n"}

In the by discipline sections below, medalists' names are bolded. \n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> - Indicates that the athlete competed in preliminaries but not the final.\n\nThe United States continued to be a strong contender in archery, though it found that South Korea had taken the top spot in the sport. Jay Barrs was the only non-Korean to win a gold medal for archery in Seoul. Two-time gold medallist Darrell Pace and 1984 silver medallist Richard McKinney joined Barrs in winning the team silver, while the women's team added a bronze medal despite not having any of the individual archers advance to the final. With her women's team bronze, 15-year-old Denise Parker become the youngest medalist in the history of Olympic archery.\n\nThe men's 100 meter sprint was marred by the usage of performance-enhancing drugs when the initial winner, Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson, tested positive for banned substances after the race and was stripped of the gold medal and his world record time of 9.79 seconds, thus allowing Carl Lewis to repeat as gold medal winner. In 1989, Johnson admitted to further PED usage between 1981 and 1988 and his world record of 9.83 seconds from the 1987 World Championships was rescinded as well, allowing Lewis's 9.92 seconds in the Olympic final became the new world record. This put the United States in position to sweep the gold medals in the men's sprint distances, including a sweep of all medals at the 400 meter distance. The United States men also won medals while setting Olympic records at both hurdle distances. In the men's relays, a fumbled baton exchange in the heat of the 4 × 100 caused a heartbreaking disqualification for the favored American team. In the 4 × 400, however, the United States cruised to victory while equaling the 20-year-old world record which had been set in Mexico City. In men's field events, the highlight came from Carl Lewis defending his gold medal from Los Angeles and leading the United States to a medal sweep in the long jump. In the women's events, Florence Griffth-Joyner had dominating performances in the 100 and 200 meter sprints, lowering the Olympic record by over 0.2 seconds in the 100 and lowering the world record by almost 0.4 seconds in the 200. She also helped the United States to strong performances in the relays, winning gold in the 4 × 100 and coming in second, while beating the previous world record, to a record-shattering performance by the Soviet team in the 4 × 400. Meanwhile, in the heptathlon, Jackie Joyner-Kersee dominated the competition while setting a world record that has not been approached in the succeeding 30 years. Joyner-Kersee's long jump performance in the heptathlon was enough to set the Olympic record for the discipline, only for her to eclipse it in the final of the long jump event. The high jump event also saw Louise Ritter eclipse the Olympic record on the way to a gold medal. Finally, the only United States medal in the middle distance events came from Kim Gallagher, who captured bronze in the 800 meters.\n\n\n\nThis was the last time that the United States was represented by college players in Olympic competition. Other countries, meanwhile, used their best professionals.\n\n\nThere were several controversies involving the American boxers at the games. Young and talented Roy Jones Jr. dominated his opponents, never losing a round en route to the final, where he controversially lost a 3–2 decision to South Korean fighter Park Si-Hun despite pummeling Park for three rounds and landing 86 punches to Park's 32.\nThe decision sparked outrage and an International Olympic Committee investigation found that the three judges who voted for Park Si-Hun had been bribed by South Korean officials.\nWith some elements of corruption in Olympic boxing coming to light, refereeing standards were changed after the games to avoid future controversies. Corruption was also suspected in Michael Carbajal's decision loss in his gold medal match. \nIn another controversial gold medal match, Riddick Bowe lost to future world heavyweight champion Lennox Lewis. After Lewis landed several hard punches the referee gave Bowe two standing eight counts and waved the fight off after the second one, even though Bowe seemed able to continue. Members of the U.S. Army Boxing Team (Anthony Hembrick, Andrew Maynard, Kennedy McKinney, Ray Mercer) trained for the Olympics at Fort Huachuca, Arizona.\n\nFurthermore, middleweight Anthony Hembrick never had the opportunity to fight. Hembrick and his coach, Ken Adams, misinterpreted the fight schedule. Afterwards, they blamed the schedule for being too confusing. By the time Hembrick arrived at Chamshil Students' Gymnasium twelve minutes late, he had been disqualified and the match was being awarded to South Korean Ha Jong-ho.\n\n\nNineteen cyclists represented the United States in 1988.

It states that auction houses have an incentive to pre-commit to revealing all available information about each lot, positive or negative. The linkage principle is seen in the art market with the age-old tradition of auctioneers hiring art experts to examine each lot and pre-commit to provide a truthful estimate of its value.\n\nThe discovery of the linkage principle was most useful in determining optimal strategy for countries in the process of auctioning off drilling rights (as well as other natural resources, such as logging rights in Canada). An independent assessment of the land in question is now a standard feature of most auctions, even if the seller country may believe that the assessment is likely to lower the value of the land rather than confirm or raise a pre-existing valuation.\n\nFailure to reveal information leads to the winning bidder incurring the discovery costs himself and lowering his maximum bid due to the expenses incurred in acquiring information. If he is not able to get an independent assessment, then his bids will take into account the possibility of downside risk. Both scenarios can be shown to lower the expected revenue of the seller. The expected sale price is raised by lowering these discovery costs of the winning bidder, and instead providing information to all bidders for free.\n\nIn the words of Evan Kwerel, \"In the end, the FCC chose an ascending bid mechanism, largely because we believed that providing bidders with more information would likely increase efficiency and, as shown by Paul Milgrom and Robert J. Weber, mitigate the winner's curse. (Kwerel, 2004, p.xvii) The result alluded to by Kwerel is known as the linkage principle and was developed by Milgrom and Weber (1982). Milgrom (2004) recasts the linkage principle as the 'publicity effect.' It provided a theoretical foundation for the intuition driving the major design choice by the FCC between an ascending bid and sealed bid auction.\n\nAccording to Perry and Reny:\n\nThe linkage principle has come to be considered one of the fundamental lessons provided by auction theory. The significance and general acceptance of the linkage principle as a guide to auction design, even in contexts beyond single-unit auctions, is highlighted by the recent design of the spectrum auction held by the FCC, which contains an open-auction component. Although the experts agreed that collusion among the bidders (which ultimately did occur; The Economist, May 17, 1997, p. 86) is more easily sustained within an open auction, in the end the faith placed in the linkage principle outweighed this concern and an open auction format was employed. Indeed, according to McMillan (1994), the experts \"judged [the negative collusion effect] to be outweighed by the bidders' ability to learn from others' bids in the open auction.\"\n\nThe linkage principle implies that open auctions generally lead to higher expected prices than sealed-bid auctions. As stated by Milgrom and Weber (1982, p.1095), \"One explanation of this inequality is that when bidders are uncertain about their valuations, they can acquire useful information by scrutinizing the bidding behavior of their competitors during the course of an [ascending-bid] auction. That extra information weakens the winner's curse and leads to more aggressive bidding in the [ascending-bid] auction, which accounts for the higher expected price.\" The linkage principle also implies that the auctioneer maximizes the expected price by always fully revealing all information it has regarding the object being sold completely. In the words of Milgrom and Weber (1982,p. 1096), \"Honesty is the best policy.\"\n\nIn order to provide a statement of the linkage principle, we follow the presentation of Krishna, which notes that the linkage principle \"was first set forth and used by Milgrom and Weber (1982).\" (Krishna, 2002, p. 11) We begin by defining the necessary concepts and notation required to state the linkage principle. Define a standard auction format to be one in which the high bidder wins. Suppose that each bidder, receives a signal regarding the value of the object. We assume the valuation to each bidder depends on its own observed signal and symmetrically upon the unobserved signals of the other bidders (so that the signals of the other bidders can be interchanged without affecting a given bidder's value). More specifically, assume all signals are drawn from the interval and that for all we can write the value of bidder as formula_1 where the function is symmetric in the last components.\n\nWe now define other random variables and mappings with respect to bidder 1, but because of the assumed symmetry, they are the same for all bidders. Define random variables formula_2 to be the largest, second largest, etc., from among formula_3. Let formula_4 denote the distribution of formula_5 conditional on formula_6, i.e., formula_7, and let formula_8 be the associated density. We let\n\nbe the expectation of the value to a bidder when the signal he receives is and the highest signal among the other bidders, is . We assume that is nondecreasing in and strictly increasing in and that .\n\nFor each standard auction format , suppose that the auction has a symmetric and increasing equilibrium , which is a mapping from a bidder's observed signal to its bid. Let formula_10 denote the expected payment by a bidder if he is the winning bidder when he receives a signal but bids as if their signal were , i.e., he bids . Let formula_11 denote the derivative of with respect to its first argument and formula_12 the derivative with respect to its second argument, evaluated at .\n\nFor specific examples, in a first-price sealed-bid auction, labeled , where the high bidder wins and pays the amount of their bid, we have formula_13 and in a second-price auction, labeled , where the high bidder wins and pays the amount of the second-highest bid, we have\n\nNow we may state:\n\nProof: The expected payoff of a bidder with signal who bids is\n\nIn equilibrium, it is optimal to choose and the resulting first-order conditions imply that\n\nwhich we can rewrite as\n\nLetting\n\nwe conclude that\n\nBy hypothesis (i), the second term is positive, and by hypothesis (ii), which implies , it follows that and cannot be of different signs, implying that for all , . Q.E.D.\n\nTo use this proposition to rank, for example, the second-price and first-price auctions, we need to assume that the bidders signals are \"affiliated\" (see Milgrom and Weber, 1982, Appendix on Affiliation, pp. 1118–1121), which implies that formula_21 is decreasing and that formula_22. Note that formula_23. Thus, under the assumption of affiliation, formula_24. In addition, so the Linkage Principle implies that expected revenue from a second-price auction is at least as great as that from a first-price auction.\n\nTo use this proposition to show that expected revenue is greater when public information is made available, consider the first-price auction. Let be a random variable denoting the information available to the seller and suppose a symmetric equilibrium strategy formula_25 that is increasing in both variables. Then let\n\nbe the expected payment of a winning bidder when he receives signal but bids as if it were \"z\". Assuming and are affiliated, so that\n\nthen\n\nand the linkage principle implies that expected revenue is at least as great when information is revealed as when it is not.\n\nTo see that an ascending-bid auction has greater expected revenue than a second-price auction, note that in an ascending-bid auction, the observed points at which other bidders cease to be active provide additional signals that are also affiliated with and so the logic for information revelation increases expected revenue applies.\n\nAlthough it has been shown that the linkage principle need not hold in more complex auction environments (see Perry and Reny (1999) on the failure of the linkage principle in multi-unit auctions), as argued by Loertscher, Marx, and Wilkening (2013), the intuition provided by the linkage principle for the potential benefits of open over closed auction formats, and the benefits of information revelation generally, will likely continue to influence practical auction design far into the future.\n"}

The municipality comprises three local communities and has a population of 12,031, of whom 6,486 (53.91%) are ethnic Hungarians, 2,388 are Serbs (19.85%) and 1,956 are Montenegrins (16.26%). Mali Iđoš village has a population of 4,830.\n\nThe first part of the name of the village, \"mali\" (\"little\" in English), was given in contrast to the village with similar name (Iđoš), which is situated in northern Banat. The etymology goes back to the Hungarian name, 'Kishegyes', consisting of 'kis' (little) and 'hegyes' (mountainy [place]).\n\nMali Iđoš municipality includes the following villages:\n\nAccording to the 2011 census results, the municipality of Mali Iđoš has a population of 12,031 inhabitants.\n\nLocal communities with a Hungarian majority are Mali Iđoš and Feketić. There is one local community with a Montenegrin majority: Lovćenac.\n\nThe ethnic composition of the municipality:\nThe name of Kishegyes was first mentioned in historical documents in 1476, without naming the shire, when the estates of the Maróthi family in the region of the Tisza river were counted. On 16 February 1462 Matthias Corvinus gave the settlements listed in the document as a present to his mother, Erzsébet Szilágyi. The destruction of the village started in 1514. The riot of György Dózsa required not only material damages, demolitions, driving away of cattle, but also a huge number of human victims. All this was followed by the defeat of Mohács. After the battle, the victor, the general of sultan Suleiman the Magnificent withdrew between the Danube and the Tisza rivers. The institutional Turkish subjection started after the fall of Buda, in 1541. The village became totally destroyed under Turkish occupation in the 16th century. The later Turkish tax assessment registers mention Kishegyes in the nahije of Szabadka with 18 houses to pay taxes in 1580–82 and 1590–91, and 17 in Nagyhegyes in 1580 and 23 houses in 1590. In 1652 the inhabitants of Hegyes paid taxes to Ferenc Wesselényi. It was repopulated in 1769 by 81 Roman Catholic Hungarian families from Békésszentandrás. During the Hungarian Revolution of 1848 in Battle of Hegyes, the Hungarian soldiers gained a victory in Kishegyes on 14 July 1849. The region is extremely well suited for agriculture and the village increased in wealth and population until the 1980s. In the 1990s the local economy was ruined and young people began to emigrate to Hungary. Today the rate of unemployment is appr. 30 percent, and the Agricultural Cooperative and the Commercial Company went bankrupt. After the end of the civil war in Croatia and Bosnia (1995–96) Serbian refugees arrived to Mali Iđoš (Kishegyes). There are no ethnic tensions between native Hungarians and the Serbian refugees.\n\nThe oldest building in Mali Iđoš is the baroque Roman Catholic Church of St. Anne (1788) on the Main Street. There is an old Calvary, the obelisk of the Battle of Kishegyes and the ruins of the Pecze Mansion. The natural attractions are the River Krivaja and the imposing loessal walls of the Hills of Telečka.\n\n\nMali Iđoš is twinned with:\n\n\n\n"}

The band feature prominently on the Australian live music scene and toured the US, Japan and parts of Europe several times. They issued three studio albums, \"When Goodbye Means Forever...\" (2003) \"Music for the Recently Deceased\" (2006) – the latter reached the top 30 on the ARIA Albums Chart and most recently \"Beloved\" (2014). The group split up in April 2007 due to the inability to find a permanent vocalist. I Killed the Prom Queen reformed to play a farewell tour in mid-2008 and released a live album and DVD, \"Sleepless Nights and City Lights\", which peaked in the top 50. In May 2011, the band reformed for the Destroy Music Tour with new vocalist Jamie Hope and spent the next two years working on a third studio album, which was released in early 2014.\n\nI Killed the Prom Queen was formed in Adelaide, South Australia in late 2000, with the original line-up of Ben Engel on bass guitar, Simon O'Gorman on guitar, JJ Peters (Josef John W Peters) on drums, Lee Stacy on vocals, and Jona Weinhofen on guitar. Peters, Weinhofen and bass guitarist Leaton Rose had previously been members of local band Cur. Early in 2000, Weinhofen left Cur to form The Fall of Troy with vocalist Michael Crafter and then he formed I Killed the Prom Queen. Originally named The Rubiks Equation, then briefly titled Child Left Burning, the band's first performance was at the Reynella Youth Enterprise Centre in late 2001. The following year, Crafter joined to share lead vocals and soon after Rose replaced Engel on bass guitar.\n\nThe band are influenced by late 1990s hardcore bands Poison the Well, Converge, Hatebreed and Earth Crisis and Swedish melodic death metal groups like At the Gates, Soilwork and In Flames. In late 2001 and early 2002, the group recorded a four-track extended play titled \"Choose to Love, Live or Die\", which was produced by Paul Degasperi and the band; with additional guitar supplied by Cain Kapetanakis. Originally slated to contain five songs, a computer glitch caused the fifth to be erased. In 2002, it was issued as an EP by 618 Recordings and re-released by Final Prayer Records label distributed by Missing Link Records. Following this, O'Gorman left to join Day of Contempt and Kevin Cameron joined on guitar late in the year. \"Choose to Love, Live or Die\", was their only release to include both Lee Stacey's vocals and the higher-pitched Crafter vocals, as Stacy would depart from the band later on the same year. The tracks were later re-recorded for their third EP, \"Your Past Comes Back to Haunt You\" (2005).\n\nIn March 2003, Rose departed (he later joined The Hot Lies) and Sean Kennedy took his place. \nThis lineup of Weinhofen, Peters, Cameron and Kennedy would become the stable \"instrumental\" lineup for the band from then on, appearing on each release despite the revolving door of vocalists in future years.\n\nThey provided the first new track since the demo, \"Homicide\" for the punk rock compilation, \"Harder Core than You\" released by \"Blunt Magazine\". Crafter was in Byron Bay and saw the first performance by local metalcore band, Parkway Drive – he was so impressed that he invited the group to record a split CD with his band. In May, Final Prayer Records issued \"\" with two tracks by I Killed the Prom Queen (\"Homicide Documentaries\" and \"Death Certificate for a Beauty Queen\") and two by Parkway Drive.\n\nIn September, the line-up of Cameron, Crafter, Kennedy, Peters and Weinhofen, recorded their debut studio album \"When Goodbye Means Forever...\" for Sydney hardcore label Resist Records, which was released in December. It was produced by Dan Jones, Anj and the group. Early in 2004, they toured Australia with Evergreen Terrace, Give Up the Ghost, and Boysetsfire. The album was released in the US by Eulogy Recordings in March, leading to extensive touring there. According to Crafter, when entering Hawaii, \"Three of us got questioned. They were asking us what jails we had been in, what our parents did and what our parents thought of our tattoos\".\n\nThe band spent the coming months supporting Caliban, Evergreen Terrace, It Dies Today, Lamb of God, Silverstein, Bleeding Through, The Red Chord, Fear Before the March of Flames, Until the End, The Warriors, Between the Buried and Me, and On Broken Wings over four months. The group's next release was their third EP, \"Your Past Comes Back to Haunt You\", on 7 March 2005. The recording included reworked older songs and a track, \"To Be Sleeping While Still Standing\", performed by The Fall of Troy (not to be confused with the US band of the same name), an earlier band including Crafter and Weinhofen, which only played two shows then broke up.\n\nIn August 2005, I Killed the Prom Queen flew to Sweden to record their follow-up album, \"Music for the Recently Deceased\". By late 2005, they had completed recording the album but in January 2006 Crafter was fired. Instead of releasing the album as it was, they decided to hire a new vocalist and replace Crafter's tracks. Ed Butcher, from United Kingdom band The Hunt for Ida Wave was recruited. New lyrics were written by Cameron and Butcher, while some lyrics that the whole band had contributed during the Crafter sessions were retained. \"Music for the Recently Deceased\" was produced by Fredrik Nordström, whose other credits included Dimmu Borgir, Darkest Hour, At the Gates and In Flames, and by Patrik J Sten.\n\nThe album was released on 31 July 2006 by Stomp Entertainment and peaked in the top 30 on the ARIA Albums Chart. The Australian tour in support of the album had over 50 concert dates in three months, from north Western Australia to the southern states and then along the east coast to Cairns. They followed with a support tour for US groups Killswitch Engage and Lamb of God, The Sydney show had 3,500 patrons at Luna Park, where I Killed the Prom Queen also played at the annual Come Together Music Festival. Shortly afterward Metal Blade released the album in the US, co-inciding with the group's appearance at the New England Metal and Hardcore Festival. Returning to Australia after their third tour of the US in three years, the group toured with The Haunted and Exodus and in December featured as the headlining act at the Metal for the Brain festival.\n\nIn January 2007, I Killed the Prom Queen's vocalist, Butcher, flew back to the UK. The band announced that he had departed due to homesickness, Butcher later joined UK metalcore band Eternal Lord. Tyrone Ross from Mourning Tide, temporarily filled the vocalist position during Japanese tour dates. Colin Jeffs of Bendigo-based band Heavens Lost, provided vocals on the European tour with Bleeding Through, All Shall Perish, Caliban.\n\nIn April, I Killed the Prom Queen announced their breakup, citing both an inability to find a permanent vocalist and Weinhofen's joining tour mates Bleeding Through. Shortly after a final Australian tour with Crafter returning on vocals was arranged for the following year. In May 2008, Stomp re-issued \"Music For The Recently Deceased\" in a limited tour edition – of 5,000 hand-numbered copies – for the Say Goodbye Tour. The release included a cardboard slipcase, two live tracks and four tracks with Crafter's vocals taken from the original album recording. The group toured in May and June, with most of the 18 shows selling out. The support groups were Bring Me the Horizon, The Red Shore, The Ghost Inside and local acts from each city. A live album and DVD, \"Sleepless Nights and City Lights\", was recorded at their Adelaide performance; it was released on 22 November 2008 and peaked in the top 50. I Killed the Prom Queen played their final show in Brisbane on 8 June 2008.\n\nAfter the Say Goodbye tour, Michael Crafter fronted Melbourne hardcore band Confession. Crafter also had short stints with Bury Your Dead and Carpathian as lead vocalist for both, at about the time of the Say Goodbye Tour. He appeared as a contestant on reality TV show \"Big Brother\" in 2008. Jona Weinhofen joined Bring Me the Horizon in 2009 and was their rhythm guitarist, keyboardist, programmer and backing vocalist until January 2013. He was a guitarist of US metalcore band Bleeding Through and the former manager for Australian death metal band The Red Shore. \nKevin Cameron formed the progressive metalcore band In Trenches with frontman Ben Coyte. He was a touring musician for a number of other groups. \nJJ Peters is vocalist for his own hardcore project Deez Nuts and one half of the hip-hop duo Grips & Tonic – the other half is New Zealander Louie Knuxx. \nSean Kennedy occasionally played bass for Deez Nuts on Australian and International tours.\nJamie Hope, the original bassist of The Red Shore before moving to vocals for two of three of the band's major releases, became I Killed the Prom Queen's fourth vocalist in 2011 and is said to be the most stable member to fill the vocal position yet.\n\nIn March 2011, I Killed the Prom Queen announced an Australian reunion tour with The Amity Affliction, Deez Nuts, and Of Mice & Men as part of the Destroy Music Tour in May. Replacing Butcher and Crafter on lead vocals was Jamie Hope (ex-The Red Shore). On the band's official Facebook page this re-formation was said to be ongoing – not just for one tour. At the time, Weinhofen was not planning to leave his other band Bring Me the Horizon and was to remain in both groups. Likewise Peters will continue his work with Deez Nuts.\n\nIn early January 2012 Jona Weinhofen confirmed that the band was writing a follow up to their last studio album \"Music for the Recently Deceased\" and that they were entering the studio at the end of the year with a tentative release date for the album in early 2013. However, on the band's Facebook page during March 2013 that early 2013 date that the band had planned changed to early 2014.\n\nThe band played three dates in the United Kingdom in July, these three British tour dates are around a similar time the band was planning to perform at the 2012 Sonisphere festival however, the festival was cancelled. The three dates became a part of a 17 date tour of Europe which span through eleven countries. Jona Weinhofen thought touring in Europe was special for I Killed the Prom Queen as they feel they have a very strong fanbase in the continent.\n\nOn 21 August 2012, I Killed the Prom Queen released their brand new song \"Memento Vivere\" on YouTube. The live footage was taken from their recent European tour. It is the first new song from them in 6 years, and their first song with Jamie on vocals.\n\nThe band supported Parkway Drive on the Australian and New Zealand legs of the \"Atlas Tour\" in December 2012. In January 2013, Weinhofen departed Bring Me The Horizon, shortly after his departure it was confirmed that Prom Queen would become a full-time band.\nOn 24 March 2013 it was announced on the band's Facebook page that JJ Peters has left the band amicably to focus on his other project, Deez Nuts. He has been replaced by Shane O'Brien, formerly of Confession, and Buried In Verona. This makes Jona Weinhofen the last remaining original member of the band since the very first inception, though Weinhofen and Cameron have been the songwriters for every release since that initial demo/EP.\n\nProm Queen opened for Asking Alexandria on the \"They Don't Pray for Us Tour\" and Whitechapel on their short headline tour in America during spring 2013. This was the band's first time in the country in 7 years. An Australian tour has also been announced spanning through many cities with support from Buried In Verona. Dates in Australia and Asia have also been announced as reunion shows with Michael Crafter playing half the tour and Ed Butcher contributing vocals to the other half but this turned out to be an April Fools. Prom Queen were also due to be playing 4 shows in New Zealand in the summer to coincide with existing Australian tour dates.However the New Zealand dates were cancelled 8 days out from the opening show in Auckland City. They then performed the Never Say Die tour throughout Europe and UK headlined by Emmure.\n\nIn late July 2013 Sean Kennedy announced on his Instagram account that he was no longer a member of the band and would not be contributing to the recording of their third album. Benjamin Coyte (ex-Day Of Contempt, Carpathian and current In Trenches vocalist) has since replaced Kennedy and played his first show with the band at Resurrection Fest 2013.\nI Killed The Prom Queen was announced that the band signed with Epitaph Records and announced that the new album \"\"Beloved\"\" will be released in Australia on 14 February 2014 and in US on 18 February 2014.\n\nOn 3 December 2013 they released the new single \"To the Wolves\" .\n\nAs of 2014 Ben Coyte, Kevin Cameron, and Jona Weinhofen are endorsed by Lace Pick-ups.\n\nA music video for \"Thirty One & Sevens\" was released on 14 January, followed by a music video for \"Bright Enough\" on 22 July.\n\nThe band has been confirmed to be playing on the 2015 Vans Warped Tour all summer for the entire tour.\n\nIn August 2017, in an Instagram comment to Jona about the status whether I Killed The Prom Queen will tour or put out another album soon, Jona replied saying that playing guitar in a band isn't at the top of his priority list right now.\n\nOn 8 August 2018, the band announced they would be reuniting with their \"classic lineup\" for a special one-off performance at the 2019 Unify Gathering festival to celebrate the 15th anniversary of their debut album, \"When Goodbye Means Forever...\". However, two days later, it was announced the band's appearance at the festival was cancelled due to discovery of offensive social media comments previously made by the band's former singer, Michael Crafter, long before the announcement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Succession is not necessarily from father to son, although there is a hereditary element. Currently, there are three eligible contenders, namely Ratu George Cakobau, Jr., his brother Ratu Epenisa Cakobau and their cousin Ratu George Kadavulevu Naulivou.

Both reactants usually have an aromatic group, which appear at specific positions on the resulting heterocycle.\n\nA more specific example of Fischer oxazole synthesis involves reacting mandelic acid nitrile with benzaldehyde to give 2,5-diphenyl-oxazole.\nFischer developed the Fischer oxazole synthesis during his time at Berlin University. The Fischer oxazole synthesis was one of the first syntheses developed to produce 2,5-disubstituted oxazoles.\n\nThe Fischer oxazole synthesis is a type of dehydration reaction which can occur under mild conditions in a rearrangement of the groups that would not seem possible. The reaction occurs by dissolving the reactants in dry ether and passing through the solution dry, gaseous hydrogen chloride. The product, which is the 2,5-disubstituted oxazole, precipitates as the hydrochloride and can be converted to the free base by the addition of water or by boiling with alcohol.\n\nThe cyanohydrins and aldehydes used for the synthesis are usually aromatic, however there have been instances where aliphatic compounds have been used.\nThe first step of the mechanism is the addition of gaseous HCl to the cyanohydrin 1. The cyanohydrin abstracts the hydrogen from HCl while the chloride ion attacks the carbon in the cyano group. This first step results in the formation of an iminochloride intermediate 2, probably as the hydrochloride salt. This intermediate then reacts with the aldehyde; the hydroxyl group of 2 abstracts a hydrogen from the nitrogen, while the lone pair of the nitrogen attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon on the aldehyde.\nThe following step results in an S2 attack followed by the loss water to give a chloro-oxazoline intermediate 4. Next is the tautomerization of the a ring proton. The last step involves an elimination and the loss of an HCl molecule to form the product 6, which is the 2,5-diaryloxazole.\n\nDiarylazoles are common structural motifs in both natural products and drug candidates, however they are difficult to synthesize. Diaryloxazoles are generally prepared through the Fischer oxazole synthesis or Robinson-Gabriel synthesis, where the oxazole ring is constructed via either synthesis.\n\nThe Fischer oxazole synthesis has also been useful in the synthesis of 2-(4-Bromophenyl)5-phenyloxazole starting with benzaldehyde cyanohydrin and 4-bromobenzaldehyde. However, oxazole ring chlorination occurs to give 2,5-bis(4-bromophenyl)-4-chlorooxazole 7 along with 2,5-bis(4-bromophenyl)-4-oxazolidinone 8. The latter compound is in general a by-product.\nAnother useful example is the one pot two-step synthesis of halfordinol, a parent compound for Rutaceae alkaloids. \nThe initial steps follow the Fischer oxazole synthesis, although the acid-catalyzed cyclization occurs in two steps rather than one, which ensures the formation of the di-chloro intermediate, preventing formation of the regioisomer.\nIn recent research, a reconsideration of the Fischer oxazole synthesis has led to the synthesis of 2,5-disubstituted oxazoles from aldehydes and α-hydroxy-amides. However, unlike the Fischer oxazole synthesis, the new method is not limited to diaryloxazoles.\n"}
{"id": "1792493", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1792493", "title": "Achelousaurus", "text": "Achelousaurus\n\nAchelousaurus ( ) is a genus of centrosaurine ceratopsid dinosaur that lived during the Late Cretaceous Period of what is now North America, about 74.2 million years ago. The first fossils of \"Achelousaurus\" were collected in Montana in 1987, by a team led by Jack Horner, with more finds made in 1989. In 1994, Achelousaurus horneri was described and named by Scott D. Sampson; the generic name means \"Achelous lizard\", in reference to a Greek mythological figure, and the specific name refers to Horner. The genus is known from a few specimens consisting mainly of skull material from individuals, ranging from juveniles to adults.\n\nA large centrosaurine, \"Achelousaurus\" was about long, with a weight of about . As a ceratopsian, it walked on all fours, had a short tail and a large head with a hooked beak. It had a bony neck-frill at the rear of the skull, which sported a pair of long spikes, which curved towards the outside. Adult \"Achelousaurus\" had rough bosses (roundish protuberances) above the eyes and on the snout where other centrosaurines often had horns in the same positions. These bosses were covered by a thick layer of keratin, but their exact shape in life is uncertain. According to some scientists the bosses were used in fights, with the animals butting each other's heads, and for display.\n\nWithin the Ceratopsia, \"Achelousaurus\" lies within the clade Pachyrostra (or \"thick-snouts\"). It has been suggested that it was the direct descendant of the similar genus \"Einiosaurus\" (which had spikes but no bosses) and the direct ancestor of \"Pachyrhinosaurus\" (which had larger bosses). The first two genera would be transitional forms, evolving through anagenesis from \"Styracosaurus\". There has been debate about this theory, with later discoveries showing that \"Achelousaurus\" is closely related to \"Pachyrhinosaurus\" in the group Pachyrhinosaurini. \"Achelousaurus\" is known from the Two Medicine Formation and lived in the island continent of Laramidia. As a ceratopsian, \"Achelousaurus\" would have been a herbivore and it appears to have had a high metabolic rate, though lower than that of modern mammals and birds.\n\nAll known \"Achelousaurus\" specimens were recovered from the Two Medicine Formation in Glacier County, Montana during excavations conducted by the Museum of the Rockies, which still houses the specimens. The discoveries came about by an accidental chain of events. In the spring of 1985, paleontologist John \"Jack\" R. Horner was informed that he would no longer be allowed to exploit the Willow Creek site, where he had studied the \"Maiasaura\" Egg Mountain nesting colony for six years. Having already made extensive arrangements for a new field season, he was suddenly forced to seek an alternative site. Horner had always been intrigued by the field diaries of Charles Whitney Gilmore who had reported the discovery of dinosaur eggs at Landslide Butte in 1928, but never published on them. In this locality, Gilmore had employed George Fryer Sternberg to excavate skeletons of the horned dinosaurs \"Brachyceratops\" and \"Styracosaurus ovatus\". That summer, Horner obtained the permission of the Blackfeet Indian Tribal Council to prospect for fossils on Landslide Butte, which is part of the Blackfeet Indian Reservation; it was the first paleontological investigation there since the 1920s. In August 1985, Horner's associate Bob Makela discovered a rich fossil site on the land of the farmer Ricky Reagan, which was called the Dinosaur Ridge Quarry and contained fossils of horned dinosaurs. On 20 June 1986, Horner and Makela returned to the Blackfeet Indian Reservation and resumed work on the Dinosaur Ridge Quarry, which proved to contain, apart from eggs, more than a dozen skeletons of a horned dinosaur later named \"Einiosaurus\". In August 1986, at a nearby site – the Canyon Bone Bed on the land of Gloria Sundquist, east of the Milk River – Horner's team discovered another \"Einiosaurus\" bone bed. Part of the discoveries made on this occasion was an additional horned dinosaur skull, specimen MOR 492, that later would be referred to (i.e., formally assigned to) \"Rubeosaurus\", the genus name in 2010 given to \"Styracosaurus ovatus\".\n\nDuring the field season of 1987 (early July), volunteer Sidney M. Hostetter located another horned dinosaur skull near the Canyon Bone Bed, specimen MOR 485. By the end of August, it had been secured and was driven on a grain truck to the Museum of the Rockies in Bozeman. On 23 June 1988, another site was discovered in the vicinity – the Blacktail Creek North. In the summer of 1989, graduate student Scott D. Sampson joined the team, wanting to study the function of the frill display structures in horned dinosaurs. At the end of June 1989, Horner, his son Jason and his head preparator Carrie Ancell discovered horned dinosaur specimen MOR 591 near the Blacktail Creek.\n\nIt was initially assumed that all the horned dinosaur material recovered by the expeditions could be assigned to a single \"styracosaur\" species distinct from \"Styracosaurus albertensis\", as the fossils represented a limited geological time period, then estimated at about half a million years. Raymond Robert Rogers, who was studying the stratigraphy of the bone beds, referred to it as a \"Styracosaurus\" sp. (of undetermined species) in 1989. \"Styracosaurus ovatus\" – though sometimes considered an invalid \"nomen dubium\" – had already been found in the area by G. F. Sternberg and was an obvious candidate. But also the possibility was taken into account that the finds were of a species new to science. This species was informally named \"Styracosaurus makeli\" in honor of Bob Makela, who had died in a traffic accident just days before the discovery of specimen MOR 485. In 1990, this name, as an invalid \"nomen nudum\", appeared in a photo caption in a book by Stephen Czerkas.\n\nHorner, an expert on the Hadrosauridae family, had less affinity for other kinds of dinosaurs. In 1987 and 1989, horned dinosaur specialist Peter Dodson was invited to investigate the new ceratopsian finds. In 1990, the fossil material was seen by Dodson as strengthening the case for the validity of a separate \"Styracosaurus ovatus\", to be distinguished from \"Styracosaurus albertensis\".\n\nMeanwhile, Horner had come to a more complex view of the situation. He still thought that the fossil material had been part of a single population but concluded that this had developed over time as a chronospecies evolving into a series of subsequent taxa. In 1992, Horner, David Varricchio and Mark Goodwin published an article in \"Nature\" based on the six-year field study of sediments and dinosaurs from Montana. They proposed that the expeditions had uncovered three \"transitional taxa\" spanning the gap between the already known \"Styracosaurus\" and \"Pachyrhinosaurus\". For the moment, they declined to name these taxa. The oldest form was indicated as \"Transitional Taxon A,\" mainly represented by skull MOR 492. Then came \"Taxon B\" – the many skeletons of the Dinosaur Ridge Quarry and the Canyon Bone Bed. The youngest was \"Taxon C,\" represented by skull MOR 485 and the horned dinosaur fossils of the Blacktail Creek.\n\nSampson had continued his studies of the material since 1989. In 1994, in a talk during the annual meeting of the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology, he named \"Taxon C\" as a new genus and species, \"Achelousaurus horneri\". Although an abstract was published containing a sufficient description, it did not identify a holotype, a name-bearing specimen. In 1995, in a subsequent article, Sampson indicated specimen MOR 485 as the holotype specimen of \"Achelousaurus horneri\". The generic name consists of the words \"Achelous\", the name of a Greek mythological figure, and \"saurus\", which is Latinized Greek for lizard. Achelous (Ἀχελῷος) is a Greek river deity and a shapeshifter who was able to transform himself into anything. During a fight with Hercules, the mythical hero, Achelous took the form of a bull, but lost the battle when one of his horns was removed. This allusion is a reference to the supposedly transitional traits of the dinosaur and the characteristic loss of horns through ontogenetic and phylogenetic development, and thus through individual change and evolution. Dodson, in 1996, praised the generic name for being original and intelligent. The specific name honors Jack Horner, for his research on the dinosaurs of the Two Medicine Formation in Montana. Sampson also named \"Taxon B\" as the genus \"Einiosaurus\" in the same article wherein \"Achelousaurus\" was described. He said paleontologists needed to be cautious when naming new ceratopsian genera because their intraspecific variation (i.e., variation within a species) might be mistaken for interspecific differences (between species). Until 1995, only one new genus of centrosaurine dinosaur had been named since \"Pachyrhinosaurus\" in 1950, namely \"Avaceratops\" in 1986. \"Achelousaurus\" thus holds particular importance for being one of the few ceratopsid genera named in the late twentieth century.\n\nThe holotype specimen MOR 485 was collected by Hostetter and Ray Rogers from the Landslide Butte Field Area about northwest of Cut Bank. In 1995 Sampson described it as the partial skull of an adult animal including the nasal and supraorbital (region above the eye socket) bosses (roundish protuberances instead of horns), and the parietal bones. Additionally, MOR 485 preserves some bones of the skull rear and sides, which in 2009 were listed by Tracy L. Ford as a right squamosal bone, the left squamosal, both maxillae, both lacrimal bones, both quadrate bones, both palatine bones, the braincase and the basioccipital bone. In 2015, Leonardo Maiorino reported that as part of the same specimen a fragmentary lower jaw has been catalogued as MOR 485-7-12-87-4. A right squamosal bone from another adult individual was recovered from the same Canyon Bone Bed site as MOR 485 (and catalogued under the same number), but only reported in 2010. Two other specimens were collected on the Blacktail Creek, to the south of Cut Bank and referred to \"Achelousaurus\" by Sampson in 1995. Specimen MOR 591 is a partial skull and an about 60% complete skeleton of a sub-adult specimen that includes the vertebral column, pelvis, sacrum and a femur. It also includes lower jaws, catalogued as MOR 591-7-15-89-1. Both skull and lower jaws are nearly complete, lacking only the braincase and occipital region. MOR 591 is smaller than the holotype with a skull base length of about . Specimen MOR 571 includes a partial skull and lower jaws with associated ribs and vertebrae of an adult. The skull consists of only the parietals, and the lower jaws are limited to their upper rear bones, the surangulars and articulars. A fifth specimen is MOR 456.1, a subadult. None of the specimens were of an advanced individual age. According to Andrew McDonald and colleagues, the \"Achelousaurus\" finds represented single individuals, not bone beds.\n\nIn addition to fossils that have been unequivocally assigned to \"Achelousaurus\", some other material has been found of which the identity is uncertain. A centrosaurine ceratopsid specimen with bosses from the Dinosaur Park Formation (specimen TMP 2002.76.1) found in 1996 was suggested to belong to a new taxon in 2006, but may instead belong to \"Achelousaurus\" or \"Pachyrhinosaurus\". Since it is missing the parietal bones, which are used to diagnose centrosaurines, it is not possible to assign it to any genus with confidence. In 2006, it was also proposed that \"Monoclonius lowei\", a dubious species based on a skull (specimen CMN 8790) from the Dinosaur Park Formation, could be a sub-adult specimen of \"Styracosaurus\", \"Achelousaurus\" or \"Einiosaurus\", with which it is roughly contemporaneous. In addition, some indeterminate specimens from the Two Medicine Formation – such as fragmentary skull MOR 464 or snout MOR 449 – may belong to \"Achelousaurus\" or the two other roughly contemporary ceratopsids \"Einiosaurus\" and \"Rubeosaurus\".\n\n\"Achelousaurus\" is estimated to have been long with a weight of . The skull of an adult individual (holotype specimen MOR 485) was estimated to have been long. This puts it in the same size-range as other members of the Centrosaurinae subgroup of ceratopsians that lived during the Campanian age. It was about as large as its close relative \"Einiosaurus\", but with a much heavier build. \"Achelousaurus\" approached the robustness of one of the largest and most heavily built horned dinosaurs known – \"Triceratops\".\n\nAs a ceratopsid, \"Achelousaurus\" would have been a quadrupedal animal with hoofed digits and a shortened, downwards swept tail. Its very large head, which would have rested on a straight neck, had a hooked upper beak, very large nasal openings and long tooth rows developed into dental batteries that contained hundreds of appressed and stacked individual teeth. In the tooth sockets, new teeth grew under the old ones, each position housing a column of teeth posed on top of each other. \"Achelousaurus\" had 25 to 28 such tooth positions in each maxilla (upper jaw bone).\n\nIn 1995, when describing the species, Sampson gave a formal list of four traits that distinguish \"Achelousaurus\" from its centrosaurine relatives. Firstly, adult individuals have nasal bones with a boss on top that is relatively small and thin, and heavily covered with pits; secondly, adult individuals do not have true horns above the eye sockets but relatively large bosses with high ridges; thirdly, not yet fully grown individuals, or subadults, have true horncores (the bony part of the horns) above the eye sockets with the inward facing surface being concave; and fourthly, the parietal bones of the neck shield have a single pair of curved spikes sticking out from the rear margin to behind and to the outside.\n\nBesides these unique characteristics, Sampson pointed out additional differences with two very closely related forms. The frill spikes of \"Achelousaurus\" are more outwards oriented than the spikes of \"Einiosaurus\", which are medially curved; the spikes of \"Achelousaurus\" are nevertheless less directed to the outside than the comparable spikes of \"Pachyrhinosaurus\". \"Achelousaurus\" also differs from \"Pachyrhinosaurus\" in its smaller nasal boss that does not reach the frontal bones at its rear. Apart from the skull, no features of the skeleton are known that distinguish \"Achelousaurus\" from other members of the Centrosaurinae.\n\nHorned dinosaurs mainly differ from each other in their horns, which are located on the snout and above the eyes, and in the large skull frill, which covers the neck like a shield. \"Achelousaurus\" exhibited the build of derived (\"advanced\") centrosaurines, which are typified by short brow horns or bosses, combined with elaborate frill spikes. The general frill proportions are typically centrosaurine, with a wide rounded squamosal bone at the side, which expanded towards the rear. It also shares the typical frill curvature with a top surface that is convex from side to side and concave from front to rear.\n\nAdult \"Achelousaurus\" skulls had a rugose, heavily pitted boss on the snout or nasal region, where many other ceratopsids had a horn. Such a boss is often called \"pachyostotic\", i.e. consisting of thickened bone. But describing it as a thick \"boss\" can be misleading: in fact it forms a wide depression with a thin bone floor and irregular excavations, though it is less depressed than with \"Pachyrhinosaurus\". The nasal boss covered about two-thirds of the top surface of the nasal bones. The boss was similar to that seen in the related genus \"Pachyrhinosaurus\", though narrower, shorter, and less high. It covered 27% of the total skull length, was 30% longer than the nostril-eye socket distance and was about twice as long as the eye socket. Its rear edge did not reach the level of the eye socket. The nasal boss extended forward, where it fused onto the nasal and premaxilla bones (of the upper jaw) at the front of the snout, though the nasal bone itself did not fuse with the premaxilla. The boss of specimen MOR 485 furthermore had an excavation (or cavity) at its front end. The horn core that formed the boss may have developed by either becoming procurved (i.e. bent forward) during growth, like the horn of the related \"Einiosaurus\", until it fused onto the nasal bone; or from a simple, erect horn, which later extended its base forward over the snout region, as in \"Pachyrhinosaurus\". The nasal bone formed the top of a large bony nostril. From the rear edge of that nostril a sharp process stuck out to the front. The snout was – compared to that of \"Einiosaurus\" – relatively wide at the level of the rear nostrils. The lacrimal bone, in front of the eye socket, was thickened, mainly on the inner surface while the outer surface was featureless apart from a crater-like excavation.\n\nAdult skulls also possess large, rugose, and oval bosses on the supraorbital region above the eyes, instead of the horns of other ceratopsids. The supraorbital bosses extended from the postorbital bone forward to incorporate the triangular palpebral and prefrontal bones, and had high transverse ridges around the middle, which were thick at their base and thin towards their top. The palpebral bones strongly stood out, forming an \"antorbital buttress\". The fused prefrontals did not reach the nasal boss, forming a distinctive transverse saddle-shaped groove separating the nasal boss from the supraorbital bosses. This groove extended backwards, separating the supraorbital bosses from each other and forming a T-shape in top view. These bosses were similar to those of \"Pachyrhinosaurus\", but with taller ridges and more pronounced rugosities. The long and low supraorbital horncores of the sub-adult specimen MOR 591 were similar to those of sub-adult \"Einiosaurus\" and \"Pachyrhinosaurus\". They had a concave surface on the inner side as with \"Pachyrhinosaurus\"; ridges on the postorbital bones were present that may indicate a beginning transition to bosses.\n\nThe skull roof of \"Achelousaurus\" had a midline cavity, with an opening at the top called the frontal fontanelle, a feature found in all ceratopsids, which have a \"double\" skull roof formed by the frontal bones folding towards each other between the brow horn bases. This cavity formed sinuses that extended below the supraorbital bosses, which were therefore relatively thin internally, being thick from the outside to the cavity roof. This cavity appears to have partially closed over as an animal aged, with only the rear part of the fontanelle being open in the adult specimen MOR 485.\n\nLike that of all other ceratopsids, the skull of \"Achelousaurus\" had a parietosquamosal frill or \"neck shield\", which was formed by the parietal bones at the rear and the squamosal bones at the sides. The parietal is one of the main bones used to distinguish centrosaurine taxa from each other and resolve relationships between them, whereas the squamosal is very similar across taxa. In \"Achelousaurus\", the squamosal bone was much shorter than the parietal. Of its inner margin the rear portion formed a step in relation to the front part, with the suture between the squamosal and the parietal showing a kink to behind at the level of the rear supratemporal fenestra, a typical centrosaurine trait. The squamosal and the jugal bone, by touching each other, excluded the quadratojugal from the edge of the lateral temporal fenestra, i.e. the opening at the rear of the skull side.\n\nThe frill of \"Achelousaurus\" had two conspicuous large spikes that were directed backwards and curved to the sides away from each other. During the 1990s, it was increasingly understood that such spikes on the parietals were not random growths but specific traits that could be used to determine the evolution of horned dinosaurs, if only it could be analyzed how they corresponded among species. Sampson, in the paper describing \"Achelousaurus\" in 1995, therefore introduced a generalized numbering system for such parietal processes, counting them from the midline to the side of the frill. This was applied to the Centrosaurinae as a whole in 1997. The large spikes of \"Achelousaurus\" correspond to \"Process 3\" spikes of other centrosaurines and were similar to those of \"Einiosaurus\", though curved more to the sides, similar to \"Pachyrhinosaurus\". They were shorter and thinner than the corresponding spikes of \"Styracosaurus\". Between these spikes, on both sides of the central frill notch, were two small tab-like processes (\"Process 2\") that were directed towards the midline. Innermost \"Process 1\" spikes, as present in \"Centrosaurus\", are lacking with \"Achelousaurus\". The frill had two large paired openings, the parietal fenestrae, with a midline parietal bar between them. A linear row of rounded swellings ran along the top of the parietal bar, which may be homologous to the spikes and horns in the same area of some \"Pachyrhinosaurus\" specimens. A row of relatively small processes ran along the parietal shield margin from the \"Process 3\" spikes outwards, for a total per side of seven. They were largely equal in size, causing the P4 process to be reduced in comparison to the P3. These lower processes appear to have been capped by epoccipitals, bones that lined the frills of ceratopsids. In \"Achelousaurus\" these epoccipitals, which start as separate skin ossifications or osteoderms, fuse with the underlying frill bone to form spikes, at least in the third position. In 2020, it was denied that these processes were separate ossifications. In the most mature individuals, the front-most P6 and P7 processes would be less imbricated relative to each other, rotated around their longitudinal axes.\n\nThe bosses on the skull of \"Achelousaurus\" may have been covered in a keratinous sheath in life, but their shape in a living animal is uncertain. In 2009, the paleontologist Tobin L. Hieronymus and colleagues examined correlations between skull morphology, horn, and skin features of modern horned animals, and examined the skull of centrosaurine dinosaurs for the same correlates. They proposed that the rugose bosses of \"Achelousaurus\" and \"Pachyrhinosaurus\" were covered by thick pads of cornified (or keratinized) skin, similar to the boss of modern muskoxen (\"Ovibos moschatus\"). The nasal horncore of adult \"Achelousaurus\" had an upward slant and its upper surface had correlates for a thick epidermal (outer layer of skin) pad that graded into correlates for a cornified sheath on the sides. A thick pad of epidermis may have grown from the V-shaped pitted notch at the tip of the nasal horncore. The growth direction of the nasal pad would have been towards the front. The supraorbital bosses may have had a thick pad of epidermis, which grew at a sideways angle similar to the curved horncores of \"Coronosaurus\", as indicated by the orientation of the \"fins\" or ridges on the bosses. That the supraorbital bosses lacked a sulcus (or furrow) at their bases indicates that their horn pads stopped at the wrinkled edges of the bosses. The pitting might indicate a softer growing layer connecting the hard inner bone with the hard horn sheath. In addition, correlates for a rostral scale in front of the nasal boss and scale rows along the parietal midline and supraorbital-squamosal region were identified.\n\nIn 1992, the study by Horner tried to account for the fact that within a limited geological period of time (about half a million years) there had been a quick succession of animal communities in the upper Two Medicine Formation. Normally, this would be interpreted as a series of invasions, with the new animal types replacing the old ones. But Horner noted that the newer forms often had a strong similarity to the previous types. This suggested to him that he had discovered a rare proof of evolution in action: the later fauna was basically the old one but at a more evolved stage. The various types found were not distinct species but transitional forms developed within a process of anagenesis. This conformed to the assumption, prevalent at the time, that a species should last about two to three million years. A further indication, according to Horner, was the failure to identify true autapomorphies – unique traits that prove a taxon is a separate species. The fossils instead showed a gradual change from basal (or ancestral) into more derived characters.\n\nThe horned dinosaurs discovered by Horner exemplified this phenomenon. In the lowest layers of the Two Medicine Formation, below the overlaying Bearpaw Formation, \"Transitional Taxon A\" was present. It seemed to be identical to \"Styracosaurus albertensis\", differing from it only in the possession of just a single pair of parietal spikes. The middle layers, below the Bearpaw, contained \"Transitional Taxon B\" that also had a single spike pair but differed in the form of its nasal horn that curved to the front over the anterior branches of the nasal bones. In the upper strata, below the Bearpaw, \"Transitional Taxon C\" had been excavated. It too had a spike pair but now the nasal horn was fused with the front branches. The upper surface of the horn was elevated and very rough. The orbital horns showed coarse ridges. Subsequently, \"Taxon A\" was named \"Stellasaurus\", \"Taxon B\" became \"Einiosaurus\", while \"Taxon C\" became \"Achelousaurus\". \"Styracosaurus ovatus\", which had been moved to the genus \"Rubeosaurus\", was later moved back to \"Rubeosaurus\" again, following the conclusion that it was not the same taxon as what became \"Stellasaurus\", and was the sister species of \"Styracosaurus albertensis\". In 1992, Horner \"et al.\" did not name these as species for the explicit reason that the entire evolutionary sequence was seen as representing a grade of transitional ceratopsians between \"Styracosaurus albertensis\", known from the Judith River Formation, and the derived, hornless \"Pachyrhinosaurus\" from the Horseshoe Canyon Formation, which had the spike pair and bosses on the nose and above the eyes, as well as additional frill ornamentation. In 1997, Horner referred to the three taxa as \"centrosaurine 1.,\" \"centrosaurine 2.,\" and \"centrosaurine 3..\"\n\nHorner thought he had found the mechanism driving this evolution, elaborating on ideas he had developed even before he had investigated Landslide Butte. The animals were living on a narrow strip on the east-coast of Laramidia, bordering the Western Interior Seaway and constrained in the west by the high proto-Rocky Mountains. During the Bearpaw Transgression sea levels were rising, steadily reducing the width of their coastal habitat from about to . This led to stronger selection pressures, the severest for \"Achelousaurus\" which lived during the phase that the coastal strip was at its narrowest. The lower number of individuals that the smaller habitat could have sustained constituted a population bottleneck, making rapid evolution possible. Increased sexual selection would have induced changes in the sexual ornamentation such as spikes, horns and bosses. A reduced environmental stress by lower sea levels on the other hand, would be typified by adaptive radiation. That sexual selection had indeed been the main mechanism would be proven by the fact that young individuals of all three populations were very similar: they all had two frill spikes, a small nasal horn pointing to the front, and orbital horns in the form of slightly elevated knobs. Only in the adult phase did they begin to differ. According to Horner, this also showed that the populations were very closely related.\n\nHorner did not perform an exact cladistic analysis determining the relationship between the three populations. Such an analysis calculates which evolutionary tree implies the lowest number of evolutionary changes and therefore is the most likely. He assumed that this would result in a tree in which the types were successive branches. Such a tree would, as a consequence of the method used, never show a direct ancestor-descendant relationship. Many scientists believed such a relation could never be proven anyway. Horner disagreed: he saw the gradual morphological changes as clear proof that, in this case, the evolution of one taxon into another, without a splitting of the populations, could be directly observed. Evolutionists in general would be too hesitant to recognize this. Such a transition is called anagenesis; he posited that, if the opposite, cladogenesis, could not be proven, a scientist was free to assume an anagenetic process.\n\nBasing himself on revised data, Sampson in 1995 estimated that the layers investigated represented a longer period of time than the initially assumed 500,000 years: after the deposition of Gilmore's \"Brachyceratops\" quarry, 860,000 years would have passed, and after the \"Einiosaurus\" beds 640,000 years, until the maximal extent of the Bearpaw transgression. He did not adopt Horner's hypothesis of anagenesis but assumed speciation took place, with the populations splitting. These time intervals were still short enough to indicate that the rate of speciation must have been high, which might have been true of all centrosaurines of the late Campanian.\nIn 1996, Dodson raised two objections to Horner's hypothesis. Firstly, the possession of just one pair of main spikes seemed more basal than the presence of three pairs, as with \"Styracosaurus albertensis\". This suggested to him that the \"Einiosaurus\"–\"Achelousaurus\" lineage was a separate branch within the Centrosaurinae. Secondly, he was concerned that \"Einiosaurus\" and \"Achelousaurus\" were a case of sexual dimorphism, one type being the males, the other the females. This would be suggested by the short geological time interval between the layers their fossils had been found in, which was estimated by him at about 250,000 years. But if the hypothesis were true, it would be perhaps the best example of fast evolution in the Dinosauria.\n\nIn 2010, Horner admitted that specimen TMP 2002.76.1 seemed to indicate that \"Achelousaurus\" was not descended from \"Einiosaurus\", as it preceded both in age, and yet had a nasal boss. But he stressed that even if the lineages split off, its ancestor might have resembled \"Einiosaurus\". Furthermore, it might still be possible that \"Einiosaurus\" was a direct descendant of \"Rubeosaurus\". Also, the process of rapid displacements and extinctions of species could in his opinion still be elegantly explained by a westward expansion of the Bearpaw Sea.\n\nThe process of anagenesis was affirmed by John Wilson and Jack Scannella in 2016, who studied the ontogenetic changes in horned dinosaurs. They compared a small \"Einiosaurus\" specimen, MOR 456 8-8-87-1, with \"Achelousaurus\" specimen MOR 591. Both proved to be quite similar, with the main differences being a longer face in MOR 456 8-8-87-1, and a sharper supraorbital horncore in MOR 591. They concluded that \"Achelousaurus\" was likely the direct descendant of \"Einiosaurus\". The more adult \"Einiosaurus\" individuals approached the \"Achelousaurus\" morphology. The differences between the two taxa would have been caused by heterochrony – differential changes in the speed the various traits developed during the lifetime of an individual.\n\nIn 1995, Sampson formally placed \"Achelousaurus\" in the Ceratopsidae, more precisely the Centrosaurinae. In all analyses, \"Einiosaurus\" and \"Achelousaurus\" are part of the clade Pachyrhinosaurini. By definition, \"Achelousaurus\" is a member of the clade Pachyrostra (or \"thick-snouts\"), in which it is united with \"Pachyrhinosaurus\". In 2010, Gregory S. Paul assigned \"A. horneri\" to the genus \"Centrosaurus\", as \"C. horneri\". This has found no acceptance among other researchers, with subsequent taxonomic assessments invariably keeping the generic name \"Achelousaurus\".\n\nSampson felt, in 1995, that there was not enough evidence to conclude that \"Achelousaurus\" was a direct descendant of \"Einiosaurus\". Unlike Horner, he decided to perform a cladistic analysis to establish a phylogeny. This showed an evolutionary tree wherein \"Achelousaurus\" split off between \"Einiosaurus\" and \"Pachyrhinosaurus\", as Horner had predicted. Contrary to Horner's claim, \"Styracosaurus albertensis\" could not have been a direct ancestor, as it was a sister species of \"Centrosaurus\" in Sampson's analysis.\n\nSubsequent studies have sought to determine the precise relationships within this part of the evolutionary tree, with conflicting results regarding the question whether \"Styracosaurus albertensis\", \"Rubeosaurus\" or \"Einiosaurus\" might have been in the direct line of ascent to \"Achelousaurus\". In 2005, an analysis by Michael Ryan and Anthony Russell found \"Styracosaurus\" more closely related to \"Achelousaurus\" than to \"Centrosaurus\". This was confirmed by analyses by Ryan in 2007, Nicholas Longrich in 2010, and Xu et al. in 2010. But the same year Horner and Andrew T. McDonald moved \"Styracosaurus ovatus\" to its own genus, \"Rubeosaurus\", finding it a sister species of \"Einiosaurus\", while \"Styracosaurus albertensis\" was again located on the \"Centrosaurus\" branch. In 2011, a subsequent study by Andrew T. McDonald in this respect replicated the outcome of his previous one, as did a publication by Andre Farke et al. In 2017, J.P. Wilson and Ryan further complicated the issue, concluding that MOR 492 (\"Taxon A\") was not referable to \"Rubeosaurus\" and announcing that yet another genus would be named for it.\n\nBefore \"Achelousaurus\" was described, \"Pachyrhinosaurus canadensis\" had been considered a solitary form among centrosaurines, set apart from them by its unusual bosses. \"Achelousaurus\" gave evolutionary context to the Canadian species, while expanding the temporal and geographical range for what came to be seen as \"pachyrhinosaurs.\" In all analyses, \"Achelousaurus\" and \"Pachyrhinosaurus\" were sister groups. In 2008, another closely related species was named, \"Pachyrhinosaurus lakustai\". In that study, the term \"Pachyrhinosaurs\" was used for the clade consisting of \"Achelousaurus\" and \"Pachyrhinosaurus\". When \"Pachyrhinosaurus perotorum\" was described in 2012, the clade name Pachyrostra was coined, uniting the two genera; \"Achelousaurus\" is the basalmost pachyrostran. Shared derived traits (or synapomorphies) of the group are an enlarged nasal ornamentation and a change of the nasal and brow horns into bosses. At the end of the Campanian, there seems to have been a trend of pachyrostrans replacing other centrosaurines. Also in 2012, the clade Pachyrhinosaurini was named, consisting of species more closely related to \"Pachyrhinosaurus\" or \"Achelousaurus\" than to \"Centrosaurus\". Apart from \"Einiosaurus\" and \"Rubeosaurus\", this included \"Sinoceratops\" and \"Xenoceratops\", according to a 2013 study.\n\nCladistic analyses develop gradually, reflecting new discoveries and insights. Their results can be shown in a cladogram, with the relationships found ordered in an evolutionary tree. The cladogram below, in which \"Xenoceratops\" and \"Sinoceratops\" are not pachyrhinosaurins, shows the phylogenetic position of \"Achelousaurus\" in a cladogram from a study by Chiba \"et al.\" (2017).\n\n\"Achelousaurus\" is known from the Two Medicine Formation, which preserves coastal sediments dating from the Campanian stage of the Late Cretaceous Period, between 83 and 74 million years ago. \"Achelousaurus\" specimens are found in the highest levels of the formation, probably closer to the end of that timeframe, 74 million years ago.\n\nThe Two Medicine Formation is typified by a warm semiarid climate. Its layers were deposed on the east coast of the Laramidia island continent (which consisted of western North America). The high cordillera in the west, combined with predominantly western winds, would have caused a rain shadow, limiting annual rainfall. Rain would mainly have fallen during the summer, when convection storms flooded the landscape. The climate would thus also have been very seasonal, with a long dry season and a short wet season. Vegetation would have been sparse and little varied. In such conditions, horned dinosaurs would have been dependent on oxbow lakes for a continuous supply of water and food – the main river channels tending to run dry earlier – and perished in them during severe droughts when the animals concentrated around the last watering holes, causing bone beds to form. The brown paleosol in which the horned dinosaurs were found – a mixture of clay and coalified wood fragments – resembles that of modern seasonally dry swamps. The surrounding vegetation might have consisted of about high conifer trees. \"Achelousaurus\" ate much smaller plants, though: a 2013 study determined that ceratopsid herbivores on Laramidia were restricted to feeding on vegetation with a height of or lower.\n\nMore or less contemporary dinosaur genera of the area included \"Prosaurolophus\", \"Scolosaurus\", \"Hypacrosaurus\", \"Einiosaurus\" and tyrannosaurids of uncertain classification. As proven by tooth marks, horned dinosaur fossils in the Landslide Butte Field Area had been scavenged by a large theropod predator, which Rogers suggested were \"Albertosaurus\".\n\nThe exact composition of the fauna \"Achelousaurus\" was part of is uncertain, as its fossils have not been discovered in direct association with other taxa. Its intermediate anagenetic position suggests that \"Achelousaurus\" shared its habitat with forms roughly found in the middle or at the end of the time range of its formation. As with horned dinosaurs, Horner assumed he had found transitional taxa in other dinosaur groups of the Two Medicine Formation. One of these was a form in between \"Lambeosaurus\" and \"Hypacrosaurus\"; in 1994 he would name it \"Hypacrosaurus stebingeri\". Today, \"Hypacrosaurus stebingeri\" is no longer seen as having evolved through anagenesis because autapomorphies of the species have been identified. Horner saw some pachycephalosaur skulls as indicative for a taxon in between \"Stegoceras\" and \"Pachycephalosaurus\"; these have not been consistently referred to a new genus. Finally, Horner thought there was a taxon present that was transitional between \"Daspletosaurus\" and \"Tyrannosaurus\". In 2017, tyrannosaurid remains from the Two Medicine Formation were named as a new species of \"Daspletosaurus\": \"Daspletosaurus horneri\". The 2017 study considered it plausible that \"D. horneri\" was a direct descendant of \"D. torosus\" in a process of anagenesis, but rejected the possibility that \"D. horneri\" was the ancestor of \"Tyrannosaurus\".\n\nOther ceratopsians from the Two Medicine Formation include \"Einiosaurus\" and \"Rubeosaurus\". In addition, remains of other indeterminate and dubious centrosaurines, including \"Brachyceratops\", are known from the formation and though they may represent younger stages of the three valid genera, this is not possible to demonstrate. Whereas Horner assumed that \"Einiosaurus\" and \"Achelousaurus\" were separate in time, in 2010 Donald M. Henderson considered it possible that at least their descendants or ancestors were overlapping or sympatric and thus would have competed for food sources unless there had been niche partitioning. The skull of \"Achelousaurus\" was more than twice as strong than that of \"Einiosaurus\" in its bending strength and torsion resistance. This might have indicated a difference in diet to avoid competition. The bite strength of \"Achelousaurus\", measured as an ultimate tensile strength, was 30.5 newtons per square millimeter (N/mm²) at the maxillary tooth row and 18 N/mm² at the beak.\n\nThe indeterminate specimen TMP 2002.76.1 is from the Dinosaur Park Formation and, if it belongs to \"Achelousaurus\", the genus would be the stratigraphically oldest known pachyrhinosaurine taxon. \"Achelousaurus\" would then also be the only Campanian ceratopsid known from more than one formation. Both animals occur right below the marine shales of the Bearpaw Formation, but due to longitudinal differences, TMP 2002.76.1 is about 500,000 years older than the \"Achelousaurus\" fossils from the Two Medicine Formation.\n\nIn 1995, Sampson noted that earlier studies had found that the horns and frills of ceratopsians most likely had a function in intraspecific display and combat, and that these features would therefore have resulted from sexual selection for successful mating. Likewise, in 1997 Horner concluded that such ornamentation was used by males to establish dominance and that females would have preferred well-equipped males as their offspring would then inherit these traits, conferring a reproduction benefit. Dodson thought that in the Centrosaurinae in general the display value of the frill had been reduced compared to the nasal and supraorbital ornamentation. Sampson in 1995 rejected the possibility that the difference in skull ornamentation between \"Einiosaurus\" and \"Achelousaurus\" represented sexual dimorphism, for three reasons. Firstly, the extensive \"Einiosaurus\" bone beds did not contain any specimens with bosses, as would have been expected if one of the sexes had them. Secondly, \"Einiosaurus\" and \"Achelousaurus\" are found in strata of a different age. Thirdly, in a situation of sexual dimorphism usually only one of the sexes shows exaggerated secondary sexual characters. \"Einiosaurus\" and \"Achelousaurus\" however, each have developed a distinct set of such traits.\n\nHieronymus, in 2009, concluded that the nasal and supraorbital bosses were used for butting or ramming the head or the flank of a rival. The bone structure indicates that the bosses were covered by cornified pads as in modern muskoxen, suggesting dominance fights similar to those of members of the Caprinae subfamily. In the latter group, an evolutionary transition can be observed, where the originally straight horns become more robust, padded, and increasingly curved downwards. The evolution from horncores into bosses in Centrosaurinae would likewise have reflected a change in fighting technique, from clashing to high-energy head-butting. Head-butting would have been an expensive and risky behavior. Opponents would have engaged this way only after assessing each other's strengths visually. For this reason, Hieronymus considered it unlikely that the bosses served for species recognition as this was already guaranteed by the innate species-specific display rituals preceding a real – instead of a ritual – fight. The bosses would have evolved for actual combat, part of a social selection in which individuals competed for scarce resources such as mates, food and breeding grounds.\n\nPreviously it had been suggested that the fusion of the first three neck vertebrae, such as seen in the mature specimen MOR 571, might have been a paleopathology, an instance of the disease spondyloarthropathy, but in 1997 it was concluded that it was more likely a normal ontogenetic trait, the vertebrae growing together to form a so-called \"syncervical\" to support the heavy head. All three main known specimens have syncervicals consisting of three fused neck vertebrae; the trait could have been inherited from a smaller ancestor using a stiffer neck for burrowing or food acquisition.\n\nIt has been claimed that ceratopsian dinosaurs were herding animals, due to the large number of known bone beds containing multiple members of the same ceratopsian species. In 2010, Hunt and Farke pointed out that this was mainly true for centrosaurine ceratopsians. Horner assumed that the horned dinosaurs at Landslide Butte lived in herds which had been killed by drought or disease. Dodson concluded that the fact that the \"Achelousaurus\" bone beds were monospecific (containing only one species) confirmed the existence of herds.\n\nThere has long been debate about the thermoregulation of dinosaurs, centered around whether they were ectotherms (\"cold-blooded\") or endotherms (\"warm-blooded\"). Mammals and birds are homeothermic endotherms, which generate their own body heat and have a high metabolism, whereas reptiles are heterothermic ectotherms, which receive their body heat from their surroundings. A 1996 study examined the oxygen isotopes from bone phosphates of animals from the Two Medicine Formation, including the juvenile \"Achelousaurus\" specimen MOR 591. δO values of phosphate in vertebrate bones depend on the δO values in their body water and the temperature when the bones were deposited, making it possible to measure fluctuations in temperature for each bone of an individual when they were deposited. The study analyzed seasonal variations in the body temperature and differences in temperature between skeletal regions, to determine whether the dinosaurs maintained their temperature seasonally. A varanid lizard fossil sampled for the study showed isotopic variation consistent with it being an heterothermic ectotherm. The variation of the dinosaurs, including \"Achelousaurus\", was consistent with them being homeothermic endotherms. The metabolic rate of these dinosaurs was likely not as high as that of modern mammals and birds, and they may have been intermediate endotherms.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1792500", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1792500", "title": "Deerfoot Trail", "text": "Deerfoot Trail\n\nDeerfoot Trail is a freeway segment of Highway 2 in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. It stretches the entire length of the city from south to north and links suburbs to downtown via Memorial Drive and 17 Avenue SE. It also forms part of the CANAMEX Corridor which connects Calgary to Edmonton and Interstate 15 in the United States via Highways 3 and 4. The freeway begins south of Calgary where it splits from Macleod Trail, crosses the Bow River into city limits, and reaches the Stoney Trail ring road. Crisscrossing twice more with the river, it intersects Glenmore Trail and Memorial Drive; the former is a major east–west expressway while the latter is a freeway spur into downtown. In north Calgary, it crosses Highway 1 and passes Calgary International Airport before ending at a second interchange with Stoney Trail. Highway 2 becomes the Queen Elizabeth II Highway as it continues north into Rocky View County towards Edmonton.\n\nOriginally called Blackfoot Trail Freeway upon the opening of the first section in 1971, it was renamed in 1974 to honour Deerfoot, a late 19th century Siksika Nation (Blackfoot) long distance runner known for his exceptional speed. Subsequent sections opened in 1975, 1980, 1982 and 2003. Deerfoot was not entirely a freeway until 2005 when the final of four at-grade intersections in southeast Calgary was converted to an interchange. Well known for its frequent rush hour congestion and collisions, traffic levels have steadily increased as Calgary's population has tripled to over 1.2 million since 1971. The mostly six-lane freeway is Alberta's busiest road with volume exceeding 173,000 vehicles per day between Highway 1 and Memorial Drive in 2019, more than twice that for which it was designed. The province of Alberta has been fiscally responsible for the road since 2000 but now seeks to offload maintenance and future improvement costs to the city of Calgary. The two parties remain at odds over who should operate the road in the long-term but began a joint study in 2016 that has continued into 2020. It offered five short-term recommendations in 2017; a $478 million commitment by Alberta for improvements was later reduced to $210 million. No construction has yet been scheduled.\n\nAs a segment of Highway 2, Deerfoot Trail is a core route of the National Highway System and a key international corridor. It is also part of Calgary's Primary Goods Movement Network and is identified as a skeletal road in the city's Transportation Plan, a limited-access route important for long distance travellers, and is the only route that stretches the entire length of the city from north to south. From its split with Highway 2A (Macleod Trail) near the hamlet of De Winton in the south, it runs north to Stoney Trail at Calgary's northern city limit where it becomes the Queen Elizabeth II Highway. The freeway roughly bisects the city, though it lies entirely east of Centre Street which officially marks the boundary between the east and west side of the city. From its southern terminus until Memorial Drive, Deerfoot approximates the course of the Bow River. Initially the freeway is on the east side, then crosses to the west bank, and finally back to the east before the river and Memorial Drive veer west at Inglewood towards downtown. Most of the road's northern half parallels Nose Creek, a tributary of the Bow.\n\nDeerfoot is a divided freeway for its entire 46.4-kilometre length, ranging from four to eight lanes wide. The northbound and southbound lanes are separated by an approximately wide depressed grass median near De Winton, which narrows and becomes a combination of Jersey and constant-slope barriers through most of south Calgary before returning to grass of varying widths from 17 Avenue SE to the north terminus. In north Calgary the grass median is supplemented by of high-tension cable barriers (HTCB) that were added in 2007, virtually eliminating the risk of serious median collisions. It was the first major HTCB installation in Canada. The freeway has a posted speed limit of from its origin at Highway 2A until just after the first Bow River crossing, after which the limit is reduced to for the next through most of Calgary until Beddington Trail in the northeast where the limit returns to 110 km/h. The entire route is paved with asphalt, except for a concrete section in south Calgary.\n\nAlberta Transportation, the branch of the Alberta government who operate and maintain all highways in the province, signed a contract with Carmacks Enterprises for maintenance of Deerfoot Trail from Stoney Trail in south Calgary to the northern city limit. The province intends to return control of the freeway to the city, but it is desirable for the city to avoid the significant maintenance and rehabilitation costs associated with the freeway and have the road remain under provincial control for as long as possible. Former Calgary mayor Rod Sykes said, \"I wouldn’t take on the problems of the Deerfoot if I were at City Hall now.\"\n\nDeerfoot Trail begins as a rural freeway near De Winton where two lanes fork to the northeast from Macleod Trail and descend across Dunbow Road toward the Bow River. It crosses the river on twin bridges constructed over an environmentally sensitive area of the valley. Rising from the river, the freeway enters Calgary limits and its southern suburban neighbourhoods of Cranston and Seton to which access is provided by a partial cloverleaf interchange. A major junction at the Stoney Trail ring road immediately follows, with signage recommending that traffic destined for the International Airport, Edmonton, and Medicine Hat use eastbound Stoney Trail as a bypass. Continuing north as an eight lane freeway, Deerfoot passes between the communities of McKenzie Lake and McKenzie Towne, crossing 130 Avenue SE to the south terminus of Barlow Trail. It then reduces to six lanes, curving to the west through the neighbourhoods of Douglasdale and Douglasglen across the Bow River on the Ivor Strong Bridge, named after John Ivor Strong who served as Chief Commissioner for Calgary until 1971.\n\nImmediately after the river, Deerfoot merges with the major routes of Anderson Road and Bow Bottom Trail, often a point of congestion at rush hour. In both directions, traffic through the outdated interchange is reduced from three lanes to two. The freeway curves north along the river's west bank to cross Southland Drive, paralleling Blackfoot Trail near the community of Acadia. North of Acadia, the freeway bisects a large area of commercial development for several kilometres before reaching a major interchange at Glenmore Trail. The interchange is generally identified as the second of two major congestion points on Deerfoot in south Calgary, the so called \"Glenmore squeeze\", where traffic is reduced to two lanes each way over Glenmore. Deerfoot turns sharply to the east and again crosses the Bow River on the Calf Robe Bridge, named after a Siksika Nation elder. Veering back to the north, it follows the river's east bank across Peigan Trail to a partial cloverleaf interchange at 17 Avenue SE, passing the neighbourhoods of Dover and Southview. Deerfoot meets Memorial Drive, a major freeway spur into downtown, near Pearce Estate Wetland, Calgary Zoo and the Max Bell Centre, and continues into north Calgary while the Bow River turns west towards downtown.\n\nIn north Calgary, the freeway climbs along the east side of Nose Creek, a tributary of the Bow River. From Memorial Drive, it passes the Vista Heights neighbourhood to 16 Avenue NE (Highway 1/Trans-Canada Highway); this section has been largely unchanged since its completion in 1975. The six lane freeway enters light commercial development north of 32 Avenue NE. Access to Huntington Hills and Deerfoot Mall are then provided by an interchange at 64 Avenue NE. Beddington Trail splits to the northwest from Deerfoot, following Nose Creek into a large residential area of north Calgary that includes the neighbourhoods of Country Hills, Panorama Hills, and Hidden Valley. The speed limit on Deerfoot increases to 110 km/h as development tapers in an increasingly rural area of north Calgary. After West Nose Creek Park, an interchange with Airport Trail serves as the primary access for Calgary International Airport, and to the west, the neighbourhood of Harvest Hills via 96 Avenue NE. North of Airport Trail, the freeway curves northeast through light commercial areas across Country Hills Boulevard and ends at an interchange with Stoney Trail. It continues north to Airdrie as the Queen Elizabeth II Highway.\n\nDeerfoot Trail is Alberta's busiest highway by a significant margin over Glenmore Trail, with peak daily congestion lasting as many as four hours. Its most travelled stretch is between Memorial Drive and 16 Avenue NE (Trans-Canada Highway) as traffic from Calgary's northern and eastern suburbs converge to travel via Memorial Drive into downtown, in addition to traffic transiting the city and other intra-city trips. The freeway was designed to carry approximately 65,000 vehicles per day but carried 173,500 vehicles between Memorial Drive and Highway 1 in 2019.\n\nIn late 2013, the southeastern segment of Stoney Trail was opened to traffic. In conjunction with the northeast portion which opened in 2009, it formed a full eastern bypass of Calgary providing an alternate route for traffic transiting the city. Traffic levels on Deerfoot Trail decreased in the year following the opening, but have since risen to pre-Stoney levels. In a 2016 study, Calgary ranked tenth in traffic congestion among major Canadian cities, with drivers spending nearly 16 hours of the year in standstill traffic.\n\nThe excessive volume of traffic on Deerfoot Trail is a contributing factor to the 10,000 collisions recorded between 2002 and 2007, including 24 fatalities. Constable Jeff Klatt of the Calgary Police Service stated that there is a \"consensus among police officers that it’s dangerous to do traffic stops\" on Deerfoot Trail. A 1993 incident in which a stolen vehicle struck and killed a police officer on Deerfoot was the catalyst for the Calgary Police Service's acquisition of a helicopter. 2013 statistics confirmed that Deerfoot Trail had more crashes and traffic jams than any other road in Calgary. Deerfoot has many entrances and exits in close proximity which exacerbates problems, but some have attributed a portion of the congestion to driver error. Constable Jim Lebedeff of the Calgary Police Service stated, \"a lot of people don’t understand, or don’t want to understand, how to merge properly.\" 30% of respondents to a 2016 poll stated that the main reason they avoid Deerfoot Trail is because they do not feel safe on the freeway.\n\nIn 2015, plans for improvements to Deerfoot Trail near Southland Drive were cancelled and a study was initiated to determine the best course of action to begin improving the freeway. The Calf Robe Bridge is also prone to collisions as its concrete deck becomes slick in cold weather, and large curves precede and follow the bridge. A 1996 crash on the bridge claimed the life of a teenager when her northbound car struck the rear of a fire truck parked in the left shoulder attending to an accident in the southbound lanes. Poor visibility due to the curve prior to the bridge was a contributing factor in a successful lawsuit by the girl's family against Calgary.\n\nThe freeway features 21 interchanges of varying design. The most recent interchanges to be constructed at the north and south ends of the freeway are more consistently of the partial cloverleaf type, a design highly utilized in Alberta as it is a desirable compromise between cost and capacity. The two interchanges with Stoney Trail are cloverstack interchanges, where high capacity directional flyovers carry traffic turning left through the interchange and lesser utilized left turn movements are serviced by loop ramps. Older and less efficient designs are used at Deerfoot's intersections with both Glenmore Trail and Highway 1. The junction with Glenmore is an incomplete cloverleaf interchange; traffic northbound on Deerfoot does not have direct access to westbound Glenmore and one must first exit to the east, proceed through a traffic light behind Calgary Auto Mall, and enter Glenmore Trail from the north side. At Highway 1, a split diamond interchange significantly slows east-west traffic even outside of peak hours, because all left turn movements must pass through three sets of traffic lights. This outdated interchange was Calgary's most dangerous road junction in 2011, with 234 crashes recorded.\n\nPrior to the completion of Deerfoot Trail, the historic alignment of Highway 2 in south Calgary was along Macleod Trail as an extension of 4 Street, parallel to a branch of the Canadian Pacific Railway from Calgary to Macleod. Macleod Trail has since been designated Highway 2A, on a routing largely the same as the original. It is now a busy expressway connecting Midnapore and other southwestern suburbs to downtown. The southernmost portion of the route from Highway 22X to De Winton would continue to serve as Highway 2 until completion of a Deerfoot Trail extension from its then southernmost point at the neighbourhood of Cranston to De Winton in 2003.\n\nIn north Calgary, Highway 2 was originally composed of four present-day routes: Edmonton Trail, 41 Avenue, 48 Avenue, and Barlow Trail. Edmonton Trail is now a busy urban street on the west bank of Nose Creek through the neighbourhood of Highland Park, but its alignment in the 1920s had it curving to the northeast across the creek along present-day 41 Avenue to 48 Avenue where it continued east past the airport to Barlow Trail and north to Edmonton as Highway 1, later renamed to Highway 2.\n\nBy the 1960s, Highway 2 had been realigned to follow Macleod Trail until turning east at Glenmore Trail before continuing north on Blackfoot Trail, veering to the northeast, and crossing the Bow River to join Barlow Trail to the north city limit. The former Edmonton Trail was re-signed as Highway 2A. As the airport continued to expand, 48 Avenue was reduced to an airport service road after the construction of McKnight Boulevard. Long after the completion and opening of Deerfoot Trail and its signing as Highway 2, the segment of Barlow Trail north of McKnight Blvd was closed in 2011 to allow construction of a new runway at Calgary International Airport.\nDue to its quickly rising population in the 1960s, Calgary initiated planning for the construction of an extensive freeway and expressway network that included numerous north–south and east–west routes. Many of these routes were ultimately not developed into freeways, but a 1967 transportation study planned for a major north–south freeway running along the west side of the Calgary Airport across the Bow River into Inglewood, remaining west of the Bow River through present-day Fish Creek Provincial Park. Initially called the Blackfoot Trail Freeway, the first segment stretched from the northern city boundary (then near Deerfoot's present-day split with Beddington Trail) to 16 Avenue NE, opening in 1971. It was named after a historic route that approximated the location of present-day Memorial Drive across Nose Creek, between Barlow Trail and the community of St. George's Heights, now the location of the Calgary Zoo. This trail appears on Calgary maps as early as 1891.\n\nIn 1974, signs were unveiled renaming the road after a Siksika Nation long-distance runner nicknamed Deerfoot. Several namesakes had been considered, including James Gladstone, Old Sun, and Walking Buffalo. In 1884, Deerfoot became known in the Calgary area as a great talent and won races against runners from as far away as Europe. Controversy arose when Deerfoot won a race but his opponent was credited with the victory. Unhappy with the result, his attitude began to change; he committed theft from a cabin, and was later the subject of a massive manhunt. He spent time in and out of police custody for various crimes, before dying of tuberculosis while in prison for assault. He had reportedly been receiving medical treatment for the disease since his arrival to the prison.\n\nIn December 1974, Premier Peter Lougheed reiterated his opposition to the planned routing for the southern portion of Deerfoot Trail, which would take the freeway along the west side of the Bow River through Fish Creek Park. Lougheed acknowledged that diverting the freeway to the east would be significantly more expensive, but was firm on protecting and preserving Fish Creek as an urban park. The revised alignment took the freeway approximately east of the river through present-day Douglasdale, McKenzie Towne, and McKenzie Lake. Bow Bottom Trail, a major arterial road, was built in the wide right of way that had been reserved for Deerfoot Trail.\n\nA second section extending the road further south to 17 Avenue SE opened on January 20, 1975, at a cost of $35 million. The new pavement continued south alongside Nose Creek and was originally to carry on straight across the river into Inglewood, but residents of the neighbourhood fought adamantly against construction of the freeway in their community. City Hall conceded, resulting in the present-day alignment that keeps the freeway east of the Bow River as it passes downtown.\n\nOn December 2, 1980, an extension of Deerfoot Trail south to Glenmore Trail was opened, able to handle up to 80,000 vehicles per day. It was advertised as an alternative north–south route to the nearby Blackfoot Trail. Construction of the $70 million extension took more than two years, and was described as \"badly needed\" by mayor Ralph Klein. The new concrete road included the Calf Robe Bridge over the Bow River and an interchange at 43 Avenue SE, now called Peigan Trail. The next section, then intended to be the final segment, extended Deerfoot to Highway 22X (now Stoney Trail) on the altered alignment east of the river. It opened on November 22, 1982 at a cost of $165 million. It featured interchanges at Southland Drive and Anderson Road/Bow Bottom Trail. A second crossing of the Bow River on the Ivor Strong Bridge took Deerfoot to an at-grade intersection with 24 Street, and a signalized intersection at Barlow Trail which had been extended south from Glenmore Trail as part of the Deerfoot project.\n\nHighway 2 was realigned in Calgary to follow Macleod Trail north to Anderson Road, then east on Anderson Road to the new interchange at Deerfoot Trail where it turned north to follow Deerfoot to the city limit near the airport. Plans to add a third level flyover at Memorial Drive by 1987 did not come to fruition. The original configuration of the interchange was modified in 1983 to add a loop ramp for traffic turning northbound onto Deerfoot Trail from eastbound Memorial. A new ramp was also constructed for traffic turning west onto Memorial from northbound Deerfoot, passing underneath eastbound Memorial before joining westbound Memorial from the left.\n\nThe province took over responsibility from the City of Calgary in 2000 to upgrade the route to a freeway and render the CANAMEX Corridor a contiguous route through the city, after which they intended to return the road to the city. In 2003, a $100 million extension was completed extending Deerfoot Trail from its junction with Highway 22X to its present terminus near De Winton. During planning, the segment had been temporarily designated as Highway 2X. Prior to the project, Deerfoot was effectively disconnected from the rest of Highway 2. Traffic continuing south to Fort Macleod proceeded west on a two lane bridge carrying Highway 22X over the Bow River, before turning south onto Macleod Trail, which was then designated as Highway 2. The section of Highway 22X over the river became Stoney Trail (Highway 201) in 2013, and a second bridge was completed in 2007 to carry the westbound lanes, while the original bridge built in 1974 carries the eastbound lanes.\n\nInterchanges were constructed at Barlow Trail, 130 Avenue SE, McKenzie Towne Boulevard, Cranston Avenue, and Dunbow Road between 2000 and 2004. The last set of traffic lights was removed in 2005 upon completion of the interchange at Douglasdale Boulevard, making the entire length of Deerfoot Trail a freeway.\n\nIn an effort to reduce head-on collisions caused by vehicles crossing over the grass median in north Calgary, the installation of high tension cable barriers was completed in the first half of 2007. In 2009, modifications were made to the interchange of Peigan, Barlow, and Deerfoot Trails, built in 1979. The existing westbound to southbound ramp left little distance for traffic to merge, causing bottlenecks. The ramp was modified to first curve north and then loop back underneath itself, extending the merge distance before the three southbound lanes crossed Ogden Road and then the Bow River. In November 2009, construction of a major interchange at the northern terminus of Deerfoot Trail was completed, connecting it to the northeast and northwest sections of Stoney Trail.\n\nIn August 2013, 96 Avenue NE was extended to the east across West Nose Creek and the Canadian Pacific Railway tracks to meet the existing interchange at Deerfoot Trail and Airport Trail. It provided an alternative to Beddington Trail and Country Hills Boulveard for access to the neighbourhood of Harvest Hills. The project included a controversial $470,000 piece of public art, a tall blue ring called \"Travelling Light\" that lies on the north side of 96 Avenue between the railway and Nose Creek. Highly visible from Deerfoot, the ring received national attention and was called \"awful\" and \"terrible\" by Calgary mayor Naheed Nenshi, and \"an example of bureaucracy run amok\" by Councillor Jyoti Gondek. The mostly negative feedback prompted Calgary to review its allocation of funds to public art on infrastructure projects. As part of Stoney Trail construction in 2013, Deerfoot Trail was upgraded between the most southerly Bow River crossing north and McKenzie Lake Boulevard. It was widened to six through lanes from Stoney Trail to the Bow River at Calgary's southern limit, and elevated directional ramps were added to the major interchange at Deerfoot and Stoney Trail to support significantly higher traffic levels. A braided ramp was constructed northbound between Cranston Avenue and Stoney Trail, preventing northbound traffic exiting to eastbound Stoney Trail from conflicting with Auburn Bay and Cranston traffic merging onto northbound Deerfoot Trail.\n\nIn March 2017, construction of a partial cloverleaf interchange was approved in south Calgary at 212 Avenue SE, between the Bow River and 192 Avenue. Calgary paid for the project initially, and will later be repaid by Alberta and Brookfield Residential, who are developing the neighbourhood in the vicinity of the interchange. Prior to a firm commitment for a portion of the funding by Brookfield, Alberta had been reluctant to front the estimated $50 million in funding required for the project, though the city of Calgary had offered to pay for it in the interim as long as the money was paid back by the province. The city had also considered contributing $20 million in tandem with Brookfield, with the province paying for the remaining $30 million. City councillor Shane Keating stated in August 2016 that development of the Seton neighbourhood will be hampered until the 212 Avenue interchange is completed.\n\nA study was completed by Alberta in 2007 to determine the best course of action for upgrades to the incomplete interchange of Glenmore Trail and Deerfoot Trail. The interchange carries 130,000 vehicles per day on Deerfoot Trail and 100,000 vehicles on Glenmore making it one of the busiest interchanges in Alberta, but there is no direct access for traffic turning from northbound Deerfoot to westbound Glenmore. Stage 1 of the proposed improvements would not remedy this problem, but rather correct a pinch point on Deerfoot Trail by constructing a new three lane bridge to carry the northbound lanes over Glenmore. Deerfoot Trail would then be three lanes each way through the interchange. Ultimately, a large cloverstack interchange is planned with left-turn movements handled by third-level directional flyovers providing free-flowing access to and from Deerfoot Trail. The proposed ultimate configuration would require acquisition of land from adjacent properties for the construction of the flyovers and other modifications to Glenmore Trail.\nThe planning study also calls for the construction of a new bridge alongside the existing Calf Robe Bridge, as part of a local-express system between Peigan and Glenmore Trails. Glenmore Trail would be widened to as many as 10 lanes between Blackfoot and Deerfoot Trails, along with modifications of the interchange at Blackfoot Trail, and the addition of braided ramps to facilitate the new flyovers.\n\nAlberta Transportation and the city of Calgary began a study in 2016 to develop short-term and long-term plans for Deerfoot Trail. Almost the entire length of the freeway is being assessed, though changes are not anticipated for the two major interchanges at Stoney Trail, completed in 2009 and 2013. The study hopes to address Deerfoot Trail problems overall, as opposed to localized solutions that could simply shift traffic bottlenecks to another section of the freeway. Due to the complexity of the freeway, long-term recommendations will not be available until the end of 2018, but five short-term options were presented in May 2017. They include a braided ramp in south Calgary between Southland Drive and Anderson Road, a jughandle intersection at 32 Avenue NE and 12 Street NE, left turn restrictions on McKnight Boulveard east of Deerfoot, and a pair of new northbound on-ramps between McKnight Boulevard and Airport Trail. All possibilities for improvement are being considered, including high-occupancy vehicle lanes. Despite the initial fixes presented by the study, Alberta Transportation did not include any of the proposed projects on the list of unfunded capital projects. In 2017, the City of Calgary began work to construct a 2-lane bridge for bus rapid transit over Deerfoot Trail south of 17 Avenue SE. As part of Calgary Transit's developing network of bus-only routes, the new bridge does not interchange with Deerfoot Trail and was completed in late 2018.\n\nIn March 2019, Transportation Minister Brian Mason announced plans for $478 million worth of improvements to a stretch of Deerfoot between Beddington Trail in the north and Anderson Road in the south. The United Conservative Party later reduced this commitment to a total of $210 million, with no construction yet scheduled.\n\n\n"}

However at the fourth summit, held in Bonn in 1978, he observed a qualitative shift in how the negotiations worked.\n\nThe model views international negotiations between states as consisting of simultaneous negotiations at both the intranational level (i.e. domestic) and the international level (i.e. between governments). Over domestic negotiations, the chief negotiator absorbs the concern of societal actors and builds coalitions with them; at the international level, the chief negotiator seeks an agreement that is amongst the possible \"wins\" in his state's \"win-set\". Win-sets are the possible outcomes that are likely to be accepted by the domestic interest groups who either must ratify the agreement or provide some other form of government backing. International agreements occur when there is an overlap between the win-sets of the states involved in the international negotiations.\n"}

In general, these are original sections of Highway 2, such as the southern portion of Macleod Trail in Calgary. They passed through communities before limited-access freeways were built to shorten driving distance, accommodate heavier volumes and to bypass city traffic. Portions of the alignment of Highway 2A follow the route of the former Calgary and Edmonton Trail.\n\nHighway 2A currently begins in the Town of High River and follows 12 Avenue SE and Centre Street before passing by Aldersyde and intersecting Highway 7. The highway then travels westward to the Town of Okotoks, where it branches north and follows Southridge Drive and Northridge Drive through Okotoks before rejoining Highway 2 near De Winton. In 2003, it was extended north by sharing a common alignment with Highway 2 for until it splits to Deerfoot Trail (Highway 2) Macleod Trail (Highway 2A) and ends in the City of Calgary at Highway 22X (Spruce Meadows Trail) / Highway 201 (Stoney Trail). Macleod Trail continues north into downtown Calgary but does not carry a highway designation.\n\nHighway 2A runs adjacent to the Queen Elizabeth II Highway between Calgary and Edmonton, although it does not enter either city. Highway 2A generally runs parallel to the Canadian Pacific Railway Calgary-Edmonton line, which runs to the west of Highway 2 between Crossfield and Red Deer, and to the east of Highway 2 between Red Deer and Leduc. Highway 2A is divided into two subsections with a gap between Bowden and Innisfail.\n\nThe first subsection of Highway 2A starts at the Highway 2 / Highway 72 interchange (Exit 295) and passes through the town of Crossfield, town of Carstairs, and by the town of Didsbury before entering the town of Olds along 46 Avenue and intersects Highway 27 (46 Street). The highway continues north to the town of Bowden before terminating at Highway 587, just west of Highway 2 (Exit 357).\n\nThe second subsection begins in the town of Innisfail at Highway 590 (50 Street), just west of Highway 2 (Exit 368), along 42 Avenue. The highway continues north and passes through the town of Penhold before entering the city of Red Deer along Tayler Drive. The highway turns east along 19 Street and then north along Gaetz Avenue. Highway 2A splits into one-way couplets through downtown Red Deer, with northbound traffic following 49 Avenue and southbound traffic following portions of Gaetz Avenue and 51 Avenue. After crossing the Red Deer River, the one-way streets rejoin and intersect Highway 11 (67 Street) and Highway 11A, which forms Red Deer's northern city limit. The highway continues north through the town of Blackfalds and city of Lacombe. North of Lacombe, the highway rejoins Highway 2 and share the same alignment for before the highway branches northeast and passes through hamlet of Morningside, town of Ponoka, and hamlet of Maskwacis. The highway enters the city of Wetaskiwin along 56 Street and continues north through the town of Millet, by the hamlet of Kavanagh, and before it rejoins Highway 2 (Exit 516) in the city of Leduc.\n\nHighway 2A, known as Highway 2A:44 by Alberta Transportation, begins Highway 2 near the hamlet of Hondo and connects with hamlet of Smith.\n\nHighway 2A, known as Highway 2A:54 by Alberta Transportation, begins at Highway 2 at the locality of Triangle, west of the Town of High Prairie, and connects with Highway 49 near the hamlet of Guy. Prior to 1990, this section was signed as Highway 2 but was renumbered at the same time that Highway 34 was renumbered to Highway 43 (present day Highway 49) north of the Town of Valleyview.\n\nThis segment of Highway 2A is considered an alternate route of the Northern Woods and Water Route.\n\nHighway 2A, known as Highway 2A:36 by Alberta Transportation, begins at Highway 2 at the locality of Roma Junction, west of the Peace River Airport and west of the town of Peace River, and terminates in the town of Grimshaw, where it passes by \"Mile Zero\" monument of the Mackenzie Highway.\n\nIn the 1960s, Highway 2 entered north Calgary along Barlow Trail; however in 1971 Highway 2 was realigned to the newly constructed Blackfoot Trail freeway (later renamed Deerfoot Trail). Highway 2A was established along most the original alignment, starting at 16 Avenue NE (Trans-Canada Highway, Highway 1) in the south and continuing north along Barlow Trail for , past the Calgary International Airport, to 112 Avenue NE (later renamed Country Hills Boulevard), where it travelled west for to its interchange with Deerfoot Trail. Direct access from Barlow Trail to Blackfoot Trail was closed to make room for the 17 Avenue SE / Blackfoot Trail / Deerfoot Trail interchange.\n\nThe Highway 2A designation was phased out in the mid-1980s and the Barlow Trail between 48 Avenue NE (just north of McKnight Boulevard) and the main terminal access was closed to allow for additional runway construction.\nThe existing section of Highway 2A used extend from High River along 10 Street SE, through the hamlet of Cayley, and intersect Highway 2 at the locality of Connemara, located north of the town of Nanton along the Foothills M.D. / Willow Creek M.D. boundary. The segment was located only west of Highway 2 and was lightly traveled, as such it was dropped by the province in 1997.\n"}

A number of tributaries of the river, including its largest, the West Branch Lac qui Parle River, also flow in eastern South Dakota. Via the Minnesota River, the Lac qui Parle River is part of the watershed of the Mississippi River, draining an area of in an agricultural region. Slightly more than two-thirds of the Lac qui Parle watershed is in Minnesota. \"Lac qui parle\" means \"the lake which speaks\" in the French language, and was a translation of the Sioux name for Lac qui Parle, a lake on the Minnesota River upstream of the mouth of the Lac qui Parle River.\n\nThe source of the river is Lake Hendricks on the boundary of Lincoln County, Minnesota, and Brookings County, South Dakota. It issues from the lake in Hendricks, Minnesota, and flows northeastwardly through northwestern Lincoln County as an intermittent stream on the Coteau des Prairies, a morainic plateau dividing the Mississippi and Missouri River watersheds, into western Yellow Medicine County, where it flows off the Coteau, dropping 250 feet (76 m) in eight miles (13 km). Continuing northeastwardly through flat till plains with occasional willows and cottonwoods along its banks, the river flows into eastern Lac qui Parle County, passing to the east of Dawson. It flows into the Minnesota River just below Lac qui Parle Lake in Lac qui Parle State Park, approximately ten miles (15 km) northwest of Montevideo, after flowing through a wooded valley in which it drops 210 feet (64 m) in 18 miles (29 km).

It is dedicated to the Saint Mary of the Assumption and Saint Adalbert.\n\nIt is the largest church and the tallest building in Hungary. Its inner area is 5,600 m². It is 118 m long and 49 m wide. It has a reverberation time of more than 9 seconds. Its dome, forming a semi-sphere, is situated in the middle, and it has 12 windows. It is 71.5 m high inside, with a diameter of 33.5 metres, and is 100 m high from outside, the stairs count 400 steps counted from the crypt.\n\nThe altarpiece (13.5 × 6.6 metres, depicting the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary, by Girolamo Michelangelo Grigoletti) is the largest painting in the world painted on a single piece of canvas.\n\nThe basilica is also known for \"Bakócz Chapel\" (named after Tamás Bakócz), built by Italian masters between 1506–1507 out of red marble of Süttő, its walls adorned with Tuscan Renaissance motifs. It is the most precious remaining example of Renaissance art in Hungary.\n\nThe huge crypt, built in Old Egyptian style in 1831, is today the resting place of late archbishops, among others, József Mindszenty, famous for his opposition to both Nazi and Communist rule.\n\nThe building of the present church took place on the foundation of several earlier churches. The first was built by Stephen I of Hungary between 1001–1010 (as the original Saint Adalbert church), the first cathedral in Hungary, which was burned down at the end of the 12th century. It was rebuilt, and even survived the Mongol invasion of Hungary. However, in 1304, Wenceslaus III, a probable candidate for the Hungarian throne, sacked the castle and the church. It was repaired in the following years. The archbishops of the 14th and 15th century made the church more ornate and added a huge library, the second most significant one in the country. It was ruined again under Turkish rule, in 1543. In 1820, the Archdiocese was restored and archbishop Sándor Rudnay decided to restore Esztergom's status as mother church of the country. The church maintains the relics of Catholic martyr and saint Marko Krizin.\n\nThe architect was Pál Kühnel and the lead contractor was János Packh. The foundation-stone was laid and work began in 1822. The Bakócz chapel was carefully disassembled (into about 1,600 pieces) and was moved 20 metres away from its original location and attached to the new basilica. In 1838 Packh was murdered, so József Hild was placed in charge of construction. He completed it in Classicistic style. Under the next archbishop, János Scitovszky, the upper church was completed and dedicated on August 31, 1856. The 1856 consecration ceremonies featured the premiere of the \"Missa solennis zur Einweihung der Basilika in Gran (Gran Mass)\", composed and conducted by Franz Liszt, and featuring the organist Alexander Winterberger. The final completion of the cathedral took place twelve years later in 1869.\n\nThe renovation and enlargement of the organ started in the 1980s, after extensive preparations, and it is currently in progress. It is supervised by István Baróti, the basilica's organist and choirmaster since 1975. As of 2008, the project is still not fully funded. The organ has five manuals and by 2006 had 85 stops working out of the planned 146. The organ contains the largest organ pipes in Hungary, 10 m, about long. The smallest pipe is 7 mm, ¼ inch (without pipe foot). When complete, it will be the third largest organ in Europe, surpassing all organs in Hungary in both volume and variety of stops. \n\nAt the time of the construction in 1856, the organ was the largest in Hungary with 49 stops, 3,530 pipes and 3 manuals. The present organ preserves several stops from the instrument Liszt played.\n\nFor the organ's detailed specifications, see . \n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1792566", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1792566", "title": "Virtual band", "text": "Virtual band\n\nIn entertainment, a virtual band (also called a virtual idol, virtual group, cartoon group, or cartoon band) is any group whose members are not depicted as corporeal musicians, but animated characters. Although the characters are fictional, the band itself exists outside a television and film universe, in reality. The music is recorded (and, in the case of concerts, performed) by human musicians and producers, while any media related to the virtual band, including albums, video clips and the visual component of stage performances, feature the animated line-up; in many cases the virtual band members have been credited as the writers and performers of the songs. Live performances can become rather complex, requiring perfect synchronization between the visual and audio components of the show.\n\nThe term \"virtual band\" was popularised with Gorillaz in 2000, though the concept of the virtual band was first demonstrated by Alvin and the Chipmunks in 1958, when their creator, Ross Bagdasarian, accelerated recordings of his own voice to achieve the 'chipmunk voice'. There have since been numerous virtual bands that have recorded material. Computer animation, traditional animation, and vocal mixing and manipulation are common features.\n\nThe term \"virtual idol\" originates from Japan, where it dates back to the 1980s and has roots in anime and Japanese idol culture. Popular virtual idols include the Vocaloid singer Hatsune Miku and the virtual YouTuber Kizuna AI.\n\nThe term has also come to be used for music groups who collaborate using the Internet, no longer requiring the members to be present in the same place.\n\nThe members of virtual groups are depicted as animated characters, with their own personality, voice, history, and playing style. For example, Alvin, the leader of the Chipmunks, is considered mischievous, and Skeleton Staff's Guitarist Stanton is a party-going underachiever. Furthermore, Freen in Green's bassist Sparky is sluggish and has been described as egotistical and pretentious, while Murdoc of Gorillaz is a middle-aged satanic bass player. Another example is Hatsune Miku who does not have a definite personality; because her way of being depends on the fans, her personality changes in each song made by the users of Vocaloid.\n\nThe style of animation used for depicting the characters varies. Some groups, like The Archies, Gorillaz, Dethklok, The Banana Splits, and Alvin and the Chipmunks, are hand-drawn characters, and much of their media uses traditional animation and cartooning techniques. Others, such as Hatsune Miku, JuJu Eyeballs, Crazy Frog, Genki Rockets Gummib%C3%A4r, and The Bots, are computer-generated. \n\nSome people consider puppetry as a form of animation; this consideration means groups like Dr. Teeth and the Electric Mayhem, can be considered virtual bands.\n\nThe recording of the music is done by the human musicians and artists, whom the virtual artists are depicted to emulate. In some cases, the singing is done by machines or synthesizer applications, like the Hatsune Miku vocaloid. This is done using the normal in-studio recording process; see Sound recording for a detailed explanation.\n\nIn some instances, most notably The Chipmunks, manipulation of voices may be employed, either to achieve a desired vocal effect, or to make it dissimilar to the voice of the actual singer. The manipulation is done by either modifying the playback speed of the vocal track or by putting it through a synthesizer (Vocoding).\n\nWriting and production credits may be assigned to either the virtual band characters, or the human writers and artists involved.\n\nOne of two methods can be employed for live performances. The first involves animating the entire set, with little or no allowance for audience interaction, then 'performing' it as is. The major pitfall with this method is the lack of audience interaction, which can be vital during concerts. This is best suited to short performances, where audience response can be predicted.\n\nThe second, and more complex, method differs from the first in that allowance is made for a variety of responses and interaction. This means having a wide range of animated sequences ready to play, with matching spoken lines, in response to different reactions.\n\nIn both cases, extensive rehearsal is required to synchronize spoken lines and instrumentation with animated action. This can be eliminated by using pre-recorded music and speech, however doing so also weakens the actual 'live' experience.\n\nWhile the term had not been coined at the time, Alvin and the Chipmunks were the first virtual band to appear. Centered on Alvin, his two brothers Simon and Theodore, and their manager/father Dave Seville, their voices were created by Ross Bagdasarian, Sr., who accelerated the recording of his voice to create the distinctive sound; the process earned him two Grammys in 1959 for engineering.\n\nThe success of the Chipmunks spurred on another group, the Nutty Squirrels, to join the ranks. A scat-singing version of Bagdasarian's creation, they made the American Top 40 with their song \"Uh-Oh\". Their success, however, was short-lived.\n\nThe Archies were the first virtual band to appear in worldwide pop charts.\n\nDuring this time, other television programs, such as \"Josie and the Pussycats\" and \"The Muppet Show\", began to include bands as part of the format (in the case of \"Josie and the Pussycats\", the eponymous band was the show's focus). Some of the groups that appeared on these shows released mainstream recordings. Some bands, however, would 'break up' after the end of the show's run.\n\nAfter \"The Archies\", produced by Filmation, became a huge pop hit, Hanna-Barbera started releasing several cartoon TV shows with the adventures of rock bands, such as \"Josie and the Pussycats\", \"The Cattanooga Cats\", \"The Impossibles\", \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kids\", \"Jabberjaw\", and others.\n\nVirtual bands still appear in television: the Chipmunks appeared in their own television show for much of the 1990s, and the Adult Swim show \"Metalocalypse\" features the virtual melodic death metal band Dethklok.\n\nVirtual idols originate from Japan, with roots in anime and Japanese idol culture, and dating back to the 1980s, starting with the \"Macross\" mecha anime franchise (adapted into the \"Robotech\" franchise in North America). The first virtual idol was Lynn Minmay, a fictional singer who is one of the main characters in the anime television series \"Super Dimension Fortress Macross\" (1982) and the animated film adaptation \"\" (1984). Voiced by Mari Iijima, Lynn Minmay became the first fictional idol singer to garner major real-world success. The theme song \"Do You Remember Love?\" (from the film \"Macross: Do You Remember Love?\") reached number seven on the Oricon music charts in Japan, and the song has since been covered numerous times over the next several decades.\n\nThe Japanese cyberpunk anime \"Megazone 23\" (1985) took the virtual idol concept further with EVE, who is depicted as a computer-based artificial intelligence (AI) who takes the form of a virtual idol within a proto-\"Matrix\"-like virtual reality. \"Megazone 23\" was a success in Japan partly due to the appeal of EVE, and it was later adapted into \"\" (1986) in North America. A similar concept later appeared in \"Macross Plus\" (1994) with the virtual idol Sharon Apple, a computer program who takes the form of an intergalactic pop star. The same year, the fictional Japanese rock band Fire Bomber from \"Macross 7\" (1994) became a commercial success, spawning multiple CDs released in Japan.\n\nThe Japanese talent agency Horipro created the first real-life AI virtual idol, Kyoko Date, in 1995. Her creation was inspired by the success of the \"Macross\" franchise and dating sim games such as \"Tokimeki Memorial\" (1994), along with advances in computer graphics. Her initial announcement drew headlines, both in Japan and internationally, before she debuted as a CGI idol in 1996. However, she failed to gain commercial success, largely due to technical limitations leading to issues such as unnatural movement (an issue known as the uncanny valley). Despite her failure, she provided the template for later virtual idols who gained commercial success in the early 21st century, such as the Vocaloid singer Hatsune Miku and the virtual YouTuber Kizuna AI.\n\nIn 2007, Crypton Future Media and Yamaha launched Vocaloid 2, with the voice bank of Hatsune Miku. In 2009, Hatsune Miku had her first concert. Other Vocaloids include Kagamine Rin and Len, Megurine Luka, and Kaito.\n\nVirtual bands can also originate from video games, as proven by the 2015 Wii U game \"Splatoon\", which features songs credited to various virtual bands, the most notable being a pop duo called the Squid Sisters, who have performed several real world concerts as holograms. The game's 2017 Nintendo Switch sequel, \"Splatoon 2\", introduces more virtual bands, most notably Off the Hook, a duo similar to the Squid Sisters. The two duos have performed together as holograms.\n\nDuring the 1980s, Hasbro released \"Jem\", an animated TV series featuring two enemy bands with a music video in each episode.\n\nBritain's Gorillaz was formed by Blur's Damon Albarn and \"Tank Girl\"s Jamie Hewlett in 1998 and produced by Deltron 3030's Dan the Automator. The group brought virtual bands to the musical fore again, with their scoring numerous Top 20 positions around the world. The band has since released six studio albums: their self-titled debut album \"Gorillaz\", \"Demon Days\", \"Plastic Beach\", \"The Fall\", \"Humanz\", and \"The Now Now\", in addition to two B-sides albums and two EPs.\n"}
{"id": "1792568", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1792568", "title": "Boy (I Need You)", "text": "Boy (I Need You)\n\n\"Boy (I Need You)\" is a song by American singer and songwriter Mariah Carey, taken from her ninth studio album, \"Charmbracelet\" (2002). It was written by Carey, Justin Smith, Norman Whitfield and Cameron Giles, and produced by the former and Just Blaze. The song was released as the album's second single on March 24, 2003. Initially, \"The One\" had been chosen as the second single from the album, however, halfway through the filming of a music video for it, the singer decided to release \"Boy (I Need You)\" instead. Considered by Carey as one of her favorites, the track is a reworked version of rapper Cam'ron's song \"Oh Boy\" released earlier that year.\n\nThe song was met with generally mixed reviews from contemporary critics. Many praised Carey's versatility and considered it as one of the stand-out tracks of \"Charmbracelet\" for having a different production when compared to the others. However, the sample hook of the song was described as \"annoying\". The single failed to make much impact on the charts around the world; it reached number 68 on the US \"Billboard\" Hip-Hop/R&B Songs chart and number 57 on the US Hot Singles Sales chart. Elsewhere, the song reached the top 20 in the United Kingdom, while peaking within the top 40 in Australia, the Netherlands, Ireland and New Zealand.\n\nThe music video, directed by Joseph Kahn, incorporates elements of Japanese culture and features Carey's alter-ego Bianca. It was also the first time that Carey worked with Kahn in a music video, which premiered on an episode of MTV's \"Making the Video\" in 2003. Following the release of \"Through the Rain\", Carey embarked on several stateside, European and Asian promotional tours in support of \"Charmbracelet\", as well as its accompanying singles. Carey performed \"Boy (I Need You)\" live on several television shows appearances around the world.\n\nAfter she received \"Billboard\"'s Artist of the Decade Award and the World Music Award for Best-Selling Female Artist of the Millennium in 2000, Carey parted from Columbia Records and signed a record-breaking $100 million five-album recording contract with Virgin Records (EMI). She often stated that Columbia had regarded her as a commodity, with her separation from Tommy Mottola exacerbating her relations with label executives. Just a few months later, in July 2001, it was widely reported that Carey had suffered a physical and emotional breakdown, and her relationship with the Latin icon Luis Miguel ended. In an interview the following year, she said, \"I was with people who didn't really know me and I had no personal assistant. I'd do interviews all day long and get two hours of sleep a night, if that.\" Carey began posting a series of disturbing messages on her official website, and displayed erratic behavior on several live promotional outings. On July 19, 2001, Carey made a surprise appearance on the MTV program \"Total Request Live\" (TRL). As the show's host Carson Daly began taping following a commercial break, Carey came out pushing an ice cream cart while wearing a large men's shirt, and began a striptease, in which she shed her shirt to reveal a tight yellow and green ensemble. While she later revealed that Daly was aware of her presence in the building prior to her appearance, Carey's appearance on TRL garnered strong media attention.\n\nOnly days later, Carey began posting irregular voice notes and messages on her official website: \"I'm trying to understand things in life right now and so I really don't feel that I should be doing music right now. What I'd like to do is just a take a little break or at least get one night of sleep without someone popping up about a video. All I really want is [to] just be me and that's what I should have done in the first place ... I don't say this much but guess what, I don't take care of myself.\" Following the quick removal of the messages, Berger commented that Carey had been \"obviously exhausted and not thinking clearly\" when she posted the letters. On July 26, she was hospitalized, citing \"extreme exhaustion\" and a \"physical and emotional breakdown\". News websites and programs began reporting how Carey threatened to commit suicide by slitting her wrists the night before, and how Patricia, Carey's mother, hastily called for help. When questioned regarding Carey's suicidal rumor, Berger claimed she had broken dishes out of desperation, and as a result, accidentally cut her hands and feet. Carey was inducted at an un-disclosed hospital in Connecticut, and remained hospitalized and under doctor's care for two weeks, followed by an extended absence from the public. Following the heavy media coverage surrounding Carey's publicized breakdown and hospitalization, Virgin Records America and 20th Century Fox delayed the release of both \"Glitter\", as well as its soundtrack of the same name.\n\nCritics panned \"Glitter\", as well as its accompanying soundtrack; both were unsuccessful commercially. The accompanying soundtrack album, \"Glitter\", became Carey's lowest-selling album to that point. The \"St. Louis Post-Dispatch\" dismissed it as \"an absolute mess that'll go down as an annoying blemish on a career that, while not always critically heralded, was at least nearly consistently successful.\" Following the negative cloud that was ensuing Carey's personal life at the time, as well as the project's poor reception, her unprecedented $100 million five-album record deal with Virgin Records America (EMI Records) was bought out for $50 million. Soon after, Carey flew to Capri, Italy for a period of five months, in which she began writing material for her new album, stemming from all the personal experiences she had endured throughout the past year. Carey later said that her time at Virgin was \"a complete and total stress-fest [...] I made a total snap decision which was based on money and I never make decisions based on money. I learned a big lesson from that.\" Later that year, she signed a contract with Island Records, valued at more than $24 million, and launched the record label MonarC. To add further to Carey's emotional burdens, her father, with whom she had little contact since childhood, died of cancer that year.\n\nCarey started writing songs for then untitled \"Charmbracelet\" in 2002, before she signed the record deal. She decided to concentrate on \"getting some much-needed rest\" and traveled to Capri and moved into the studio, which she had reserved to record the album. While at Capri, Carey could focus on her writing and recording, without being subjected to any stress or pressure. According to her, she would write the songs in her apartment upstairs, and would record them at the studio downstairs, at night. Thus, most of the album was recorded in Capri although she traveled to Atlanta, New York and Philadelphia to record a few tracks. The result was that \"Charmbracelet\" was her \"most personal album\" she had ever made.\n\nWhile Carey paved a lot of the album with slower and autobiographical ballads, she also attempted at making an album with a mixture of several different genres. According to Jon Pareles of \"The New York Times\", the album showed off Carey's musical and vocal versatility, especially when viewing the differences in the record's first and second singles, \"Ms. Carey is known for her voice, of course: she can hit high notes that barely sound human, and few singers leap around the octaves as gracefully as she does. But as she tries to regain her audience, her greatest weapon may be her versatility: Ms. Carey also knows how to make a hip-hop hit by holding back and letting the beat shine.\" Carey decided to work with Just Blaze after she heard the song \"Oh Boy\" he had produced for Cam'ron. Together they produced \"Boy (I Need You)\", a remake of \"Oh Boy\", and \"You Got Me\". Carey described the former as one of her favorites on the album. \"It's definitely one of my favorites, 'cause I love the original. It was cool to have him out there doing his thing in such a random environment,\" she said. \"Boy (I Need You)\" was released as the second single from the album on November 26, 2002. Initially, \"The One\" was scheduled to be released as the second single and the music video was shot for the song. However, halfway through the filming, the track was changed to \"Boy (I Need You)\".\n\n\"Boy (I Need You)\" received mostly mixed reviews from contemporary critics. Jon Pareles of \"The New York Times\" complimented the track on its differences with most of the content on \"Charmbracelet\". \"Entertainment Weekly\" writer Tom Sincalir said that \"the herky-jerky [track], on which Cam'ron guests, [adds] some welcome energy\" to the album. Michael Paoletta of \"Billboard\" considered it as one of \"Charmbracelet\"s stand-out tracks, while Slant Magazines Sal Cinquemani said \"Boy (I Need You)\", along with \"You Got Me\", \"provide further evidence that Carey should keep her rappers on the remix.\" Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic noted that Carey did not \"completely abandon hip-hop, but whenever it rears its head on Charmbracelet, it's utterly jarring\" citing the song as an example, while describing the sampled vocal hook as \"annoying\". Erlewine, however, selected it as a Track Pick from the album review. The single failed to make much impact on the charts around the world; it reached number 68 on the US \"Billboard\" Hip-Hop/R&B Songs chart and number 57 on the US Hot Singles Sales chart. Elsewhere, the song reached number 17 in the United Kingdom, while peaking within the top 40 in Australia, the Netherlands, Ireland and New Zealand.\n\nDescribed as \"Speed Racer meets Hello Kitty meets me and Cam'ron\" by Carey, the video was directed by Joseph Kahn, stars actor Will Yun Lee and incorporates elements of Japanese culture and features Carey's alter-ego Bianca Storm. When asked about the music video, Kahn replied, \"To me, videos aren't movies, they're their own art form-like poetry. If you're a poet, you want to make poetry.\" Carey also revealed that the music video marked the first time she worked with Kahn. The music video production and recording was shown in a MTV's \"Making the Video\" episode in 2003. The video was likened to a \"clear extension of Janet's \"Doesn't Really Matter\" for its similar settings and theme of Japanese pop culture. Following the release of \"Through the Rain\", Carey embarked on several stateside, European and Asian promotional tours in support of \"Charmbracelet\", as well as its accompanying singles. Three days prior to the album's stateside release, a one-hour special titled \"Mariah Carey: Shining Through the Rain\" aired on MTV, in which Carey was interviewed and sang several songs from \"Charmbracelet\" and of her catalog. During the interview, Carey addressed rumors of her breakdown and its cause, as well as of the album and its inspiration, followed by a question and answer with fans. During the album's month of release, Carey appeared on several television talk shows, launching her promotional tour on \"Today\", where she performed a four-song set-list at Mall of America for a crowd of over 10,000. Carey also performed the song on \"Top of the Pops\" and on \"The Graham Norton Show\".\n\n"}

{"id": "1792580", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1792580", "title": "Passaconaway", "text": "Passaconaway\n\nPassaconaway, which translates to \"Child of the Bear\", was sachem of the Pennacook people in what is now northern New England in the United States.\n\nOne of the key native figures in the colonial history of New Hampshire, Passaconaway was believed to have been born between 1550 and 1570, and is said to have died in 1679. He was a powerful shaman and sachem (chief) of the Pennacook, eventually becoming \"bashaba\" (chief of chiefs) of a multi-tribal confederation that drew together for mutual protection against the Mohawk Nation. In his old age Passaconaway relinquished his positions of authority to travel among the tribes and settlers in the New Hampshire-Massachusetts-Maine area. He was revered by both Native Americans and European settlers.\n\nHis native name was \"Papisse Conewa\", meaning, Child of the Bear, or Son of the Bear, but white settlers anglicized the name as Passaconaway. In his later years he was sometimes referred to as St. Aspenquid.\n\nLegend holds that Passaconaway was a giant, genius, and possessed magical powers, such as making water burn, and trees and rocks dance. According to folklore, he could make dried up leaves turn green and make living snakes out of dead snake skin. It was said that he could become invisible and create thunderstorms at will.\n\nEven before the Pilgrims' 1620 landing on the Massachusetts coast, a European ship's captain reported seeing a huge native standing atop a coastal cliff, surmising he was probably the native often referred to as Conway. European history records that Passaconaway lived at the top of the Pawtucket Falls at what is now Lowell, Massachusetts; a marker was placed there in 1935. Local New Hampshire history says that he lived and moved seasonally among various fishing and planting spots, including the Merrimack River falls in present-day Manchester, fertile islands in the river, coastal spots along the seashore, and other places along the Merrimack such as present-day Horseshoe Pond.\n\nAnother legend indicates that Passaconaway was summoned to the Plymouth area of Massachusetts by the Wampanoag sachem Massasoit, asking Passaconaway to use his supernatural powers to rid the land of the Pilgrims who were building a village on the shore. At Massasoit's village, says the folklore, Passaconaway was for the first time in his life unable to bring up a storm. After conversing with the Great Spirit, Passaconaway declared that the Great Spirit had commanded him to live the rest of his life in peace with the white-faced tribes. From this time on, Passaconaway would not allow his sons or his tribe to fight with any European settlers, and counseled peace to all his native associates.\n\nPassaconaway was one of the first native chieftains to lease land to English settlers in New England. His second son Wonalancet eventually became sachem of the Pennacook, and his oldest son Nanamocomuck became sachem of the neighboring Wachusett. His daughter Wanunchus married Montowampate, the sagamore (chief) of the Saugus tribe north of what is now Boston (their marriage was the topic of John Greenleaf Whittier's poem \"The Bridal of Penacook\"), and daughter Nobhow married the sachem of the Pawtucket people. Historical records show that when each of Passaconaway's two oldest sons was arrested and jailed by a local white council, the Bashaba worked out with the white governor a peaceful settlement of the false charges and a release for each of his sons. On one occasion white settlers tried to arrest Passaconaway himself, but a sudden thunderstorm arose, slowing the posse, and the native emperor disappeared into the forest.\n\nLocal New Hampshire history says that in 1647 a white preacher, John Elliot, attempted to speak with Passaconaway but was refused audience again and again before he was finally allowed to talk with the Bashaba. Eventually the minister was invited to live with the Pennacook people and teach the elderly sachem about Christianity. Legend says that after the preacher died suddenly from an illness, Passaconaway eventually decided to step down from his position of authority, announcing before an enormous crowd at the yearly native gathering that his son Wonalancet was now sachem of the Pennacook. After this, Passaconaway spent much of his time traveling from village to village for the Great Spirit, counseling prayer and peace to all who would open their homes to him.\n\nIn October 1665, Passaconaway's daughter, Bess, wife of Nobb How, sold the land called Augumtoocooke (present-day Dracut, Massachusetts) to Captain John Evered, for the sum of four yards of \"Duffill\" and one pound of tobacco. Capt. Evered in turn sold tracts of the land to European families.\n\nLegends of Passaconaway's death say that his body was buried in a cave in the sacred native mountain Agamenticus in southern Maine, and that at least one member of his people saw his spirit carried up to the Great Spirit's earthly abode of Agiocochook (Mount Washington) atop a sled pulled by wolves and covered with hundreds of animal skins given to him by his people and his fellow sachems. There he burst into flame and was carried up to the heavens to live with the Great Spirit. (Chief Passaconaway has often been confused with St. Aspinquid.)\n\nThe present-day Kancamagus Highway, a scenic two-lane highway through the White Mountains of New Hampshire, bears the name of Passaconaway's grandson, Kancamagus.\n\nThe Kancamagus Highway passes the former village of Passaconaway, much of which is now part of the White Mountain National Forest. The village of Passaconaway once contained a sawmill, hotel and post office, as well as several farms and homes. For a few years a logging railroad ran through the area. The short-lived Passaconaway Mountain Club was based there. The former settlement is located in the incorporated town of Albany, New Hampshire. Today the area is noted for its hiking and cross-country skiing trails. The U.S. Forest Service maintains the Passaconaway Campground and the Jigger Johnson Campground in this area, as well as the historic Russell-Colbath House and adjacent cemetery.\n\nMount Passaconaway, a summit in the Sandwich Range of the White Mountains lying between the village of Wonalancet and the Kancamagus Highway, bears the sachem's name.\n\nThe Daniel Webster Council of the Boy Scouts of America, which serves most of New Hampshire, honors Passaconaway by naming their Order of the Arrow lodge for the sachem.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1792585", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1792585", "title": "Apollonia (Illyria)", "text": "Apollonia (Illyria)\n\nApollonia (; or Ἀπολλωνία πρὸς Ἐπίδαμνον, \"Apollonia kat' Epidamnon\" or \"Apollonia pros Epidamnon\") was an ancient Greek city located on the right bank of the Aous river (modern-day Vjosë). Its ruins are situated in the Fier County, next to the village of Pojani (Polina), in modern-day Albania. Apollonia was founded in 588 BC by Greek colonists from Corfu and Corinth on a site where native Illyrian tribes lived, and was perhaps the most important of the several classical towns known as \"Apollonia\". Apollonia flourished in the Roman period and was home to a renowned school of philosophy, but began to decline in the 3rd century AD when its harbor started silting up as a result of an earthquake. It was abandoned by the end of Late Antiquity.\n\nThe name of the city is mentioned among the modern bishoprics of the Orthodox Autocephalous Church of Albania (\"Apollonia and Fier\"). Apollonia is also a titular see of the Latin Church.\n\nThe site of Apollonia lay on the territory of the Taulantii, a cluster of Illyrian tribes that remained closely involved with the settlement for centuries and lived alongside the Greek colonists. The city was said to have originally been named \"Gylakeia\" after its founder, Gylax, but the name was later changed to honor the god Apollo. This wasn't the only city named for the god Apollo. There were 24 other cities named Apollonia, but Illyria's Apollonia was the most important and played a major role as a trading intermediary between the Hellenists and the Illyrians. It is estimated that the city had about 60,000 inhabitants.\n\nIt is mentioned by Strabo in his \"Geographica\" as \"an exceedingly well-governed city\", with a fountain, gymnasium, etc. Aristotle considered Apollonia an important example of an oligarchic system, as the descendants of the Greek colonists controlled the city and helped Illyrians to learn how to govern. The city grew rich on the slave trade and local agriculture, as well as its large harbour, said to have been able to hold a hundred ships at a time. The city also benefited from the local supply of asphalt which was a valuable commodity in ancient times, for example for caulking ships. The remains of a late sixth-century temple, located just outside the city, were reported in 2006; it is only the fifth known stone temple found in present-day Albania.\n\nApollonia, like Dyrrachium further north, was an important port on the Illyrian coast as the most convenient link between Brundusium and northern Greece, and as one of the western starting points of the Via Egnatia leading east to Thessaloniki and Byzantium in Thrace. It had its own mint, stamping coins showing a cow suckling her calf on the obverse and a double stellate pattern on the reverse, which have been found as far away as the basin of the Danube.\n\nThe city was for a time included among the dominions of Pyrrhus of Epirus. In 229 BC, it came under the control of the Roman Republic, to which it was firmly loyal; it was rewarded in 168 BC with booty seized from Gentius, the defeated king of Illyria. In 148 BC, Apollonia became part of the Roman province of Macedonia, specifically of Epirus Nova. In the Roman Civil War between Pompey and Julius Caesar, it supported the latter, but fell to Marcus Junius Brutus in 48 BC. The later Roman emperor Augustus studied in Apollonia in 44 BC under the tutelage of Athenodorus of Tarsus; it was there that he received news of Caesar's murder.\n\nApollonia flourished under Roman rule and was noted by Cicero in his \"Philippicae\" as \"magna urbs et gravis\", a great and important city. Christianity was established in the city at an early stage, and bishops from Apollonia were present during the First Council of Ephesus (431) and the Council of Chalcedon (451). Its decline, however, began in the 3rd century AD, when an earthquake changed the path of the Aoös, causing the harbour to silt up and the inland area to become a malaria-ridden swamp. The city became increasingly uninhabitable as the inland swamp expanded, and the nearby settlement of Avlona (modern-day Vlorë) became dominant. By the end of antiquity, the city was largely depopulated, hosting only a small Christian community. This community (which probably is part of the site of the old city) built on a nearby hill the church of the Dormition of the Theotokos, (), part of the Ardenica Monastery.\n\nThe city seems to have sunk with the rise of Vlora. It was \"rediscovered\" by European classicists in the 18th century, though it was not until the Austrian occupation of 1916–1918 that the site was investigated by archaeologists. Their work was continued by a French team between 1924–1938. Parts of the site were damaged during the Second World War. After the war, an Albanian team undertook further work from 1948 onwards, although much of the site remains unexcavated to this day. Some of the team's archeological discoveries are on display within the monastery, known as the Museum of Apollonia (opened in 1958) and other artifacts from Apollonia are in the capital Tirana. Unfortunately, during the anarchy that followed the collapse of the communist party in 1990 and reversion to capitalism, the archeological collection was plundered and the museum was temporarily closed. The ruins were also frequently dug up by plunderers for relics to be sold to collectors abroad.\nIn December 2011, a new museum opened, under the directorship of Marin Haxhimihali. It replaced an older museum dating from 1985, and was funded by UNESCO's MDG-F Joint Programme ”Culture and Heritage for Social and Economic Development”.\n\nIn 2006, archaeologists discovered a Greek temple which dates back to the 6th century BC just outside of the Apollonia.\n\nIn August 2010, a French-Albanian team of archaeologists unearthed a bust of a Roman soldier, 50 years after the discoveries of other full body statues in the 1958–1960 period expeditions, led by Albanian scholar Selim Islami and Russian Professor Blavatski.\n\nA German-Albanian team has been working on the Hellenistic theatre at Albania, throwing light on the development of Greek theatres and also local variants\n\nA bishopric was founded there circa 400 AD but suppressed around 599.\nOne of the participants in the Council of Ephesus in 431 was a Felix who signed once as Bishop of Apollonia and Byllis, at another time as Bishop of Apollonia. Some assume that the two towns formed a single episcopal see, others suppose he was, strictly speaking, Bishop only of Apollonia, but was temporarily in charge also of Byllis during a vacancy of that see (apostolic administrator). One of the participants at a council held in Constantinople in 448 signed as \"Paulus Episcopus Apolloniada al. Apolloniatarum, civitatis sanctae ecclesiae\", but it is uncertain whether he was associated with this Apollonia. At the Council of Chalcedon in 451, Eusebius subscribed simply as Bishop of Apollonia. In the letter of the bishops of Epirus Nova to the Byzantine Emperor Leo I in 458, Philocharis subscribes as Bishop of what the manuscripts call \"Vallidus\", and which editors think should be corrected to \"Byllis\". Whether Philocharis is to be considered Bishop also of Apollonia depends on the interpretation of the position of Felix in 431.\n\nThe \"Annuario Pontificio\" lists Apollonia as a titular see, thus recognizing that it was once a residential diocese, a suffragan of the archbishopric of Dyrrachium, It grants no such recognition to Byllis. Metropolitan of the Roman province of Epirus Novus.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1792594", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1792594", "title": "Baldassare Peruzzi", "text": "Baldassare Peruzzi\n\nBaldassare Tommaso Peruzzi (7 March 1481 – 6 January 1536) was an Italian architect and painter, born in a small town near Siena (in Ancaiano, \"frazione\" of Sovicille) and died in Rome. He worked for many years with Bramante, Raphael, and later Sangallo during the erection of the new St. Peter's. He returned to his native Siena after the Sack of Rome (1527) where he was employed as architect to the Republic. For the Sienese he built new fortifications for the city and designed (though did not build) a remarkable dam on the Bruna River near Giuncarico. He seems to have moved back to Rome permanently by 1535. He died there the following year and was buried in the Rotunda of the Pantheon, near Raphael.\n\nHe was a painter of frescoes in the \"Cappella San Giovanni\" (Chapel of St John the Baptist) in the Duomo of Siena.\n\nHis son Giovanni Sallustio was also an architect. Another son, Onorio, learned painting from his father, then became a Dominican priest in the convent of Santa Maria Sopra Minerva in Rome. He then stopped painting until requested by his superiors at San Romano di Lucca to paint the organ doors of the church.\n\nAlmost all art critics ascribe the design of the Villa Chigi in Rome, now known more commonly as the Villa Farnesina, to Peruzzi. In this villa, two wings branch off from a central hall with a simple arrangement of pilasters, and a decorative frieze on the exterior of the building . Some of the frescoed paintings which adorn the interior rooms are by Peruzzi. One example is the Sala delle Prospettive, in which Peruzzi revived the perspective schemes of Melozzo da Forli and Mantegna, possibly under the influence of both. The walls of the room are painted so that when one stands toward the left, one has the illusion that one is standing in an open-air terrace, lined by pillars, looking out over a continuous landscape. The decoration of the façade, the work of Peruzzi, has almost entirely vanished, but it is documented by an anonymous French artist in a drawing, now held by the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art . To decorate this villa on the Tiber many artists were employed, and just as the style of the villa in no wise recalls the old castellated type of country-house, so the paintings in harmony with the pleasure-loving spirits of the time were thoroughly antique and uninspired by Christian ideas. Raphael designed the composition of the story of Amor and Psyche as a continuation of the Galatea. On a plate-glass vault Peruzzi painted the firmament, with the zodiacal signs, the planets, and other heavenly bodies. The interior room has a striking use of illusionistic perspective \n\nPeruzzi had produced a mosaic ceiling for the church of Santa Croce in Gerusalemme, Rome; the mosaic depicts the Saviour. Other paintings ascribed to him are to be found in Sant'Onofrio and San Pietro in Montorio. That Peruzzi improved as time went on is evident in his later works, e.g., the \"Madonna with Saints\" in Santa Maria della Pace at Rome, and the fresco of \"Augustus and the Tiburtine Sibyl\" in Santa Maria in Portico a Fontegiusta at Siena. As our master interested himself in the decorative art also, he exercised a strong influence in this direction, not only by his own decorative paintings but also by furnishing designs for craftsmen of various kinds. While primarily known as an architect, one of his great loves was drawing. His extraordinary pen and ink drawings for the basilica of St. Peter's are preserved in the Prints and Drawings Collection of the Uffizi Gallery in Florence. He was especially well known for his extraordinary studies of antique buildings, as seen in The Mystic Marriage of Saint Catherine (1502–1503) in the Allen Memorial Art Museum.\n\nHis final architectural masterpiece, the Palazzo Massimo alle Colonne (1535) located now on the 19th-century Corso Vittorio Emanuele, is well known for its curving facade, ingenious planning, and architecturally rich interior. The exterior details display a Mannerist-style.\n\nHe left drawings to a pupil, Sebastiano Serlio, who used them in several of his \"Books of Architecture\", published in Venice beginning in the early 1530s.\n\n"}
{"id": "1792598", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1792598", "title": "Francis Caracciolo", "text": "Francis Caracciolo\n\nFrancis Caracciolo (October 13, 1563 – June 4, 1608), born Ascanio Pisquizio, was an Italian Catholic priest who co-founded the Congregation of the Clerics Regular Minor with John Augustine Adorno. He decided to adopt a religious life at the age of 22.\n\nSt Francis Caracciolo was born in Villa Santa Maria in the Abruzzo region, in the Kingdom of Naples. He belonged to the Pisquizio branch of the Caracciolo family and received in baptism the name of Ascanio. From a young age, he had a reputation for gentleness and uprightness.\nWhen he was 22, he was attacked by one of the several skin complaints collectively described as \"leprosy\" in those days. So serious was this attack that he was considered hopeless. With death so near, he made a vow that if he regained his health, he would spend the rest of his life in the service of God and his fellow men. He recovered so quickly after this vow, that his cure was considered miraculous. Eager to fulfil his promise to God, he went to Naples to study for the priesthood. In 1587 he was ordained priest and joined the confraternity of the \"Bianchi della Giustizia\" (The White Robes of Justice), whose object was to assist condemned criminals to die holy deaths.\n\nFive years after he went to Naples, a letter from Venerable Fr. Giovanni Agostino Adorno of Genoa to another Caracciolo, Fabrizio, begging him to take part in founding a new religious institute, was delivered by mistake to the newly ordained priest, and he saw in this circumstance an assurance of the Divine Will towards him (1588). He assisted in drawing up rules for the new congregation, which was approved by Pope Sixtus V, July 1, 1588, and confirmed by Pope Gregory XIV on February 18, 1591, and reconfirmed by Pope Clement VIII on June 1, 1592.\n\nThe institute founded thereby, named the Congregation of the Clerics Regular Minor (the \"\"Adorno Fathers\"\"), is both contemplative and active. Perpetual adoration of the Blessed Sacrament is one of the pillars of their life. To the three usual vows a fourth is added, namely, that its members must not aspire to ecclesiastical dignities outside the order nor seek them within it. Perpetual adoration of the Blessed Sacrament is kept up by rotation, and self-mortification is practised. The motto of the order \"\"Ad majorem Resurgentis gloriam\"\" (\"\"to the greater glory of the Risen One\"\") was chosen because Francis and Augustine Adorno made their profession at Naples on Low Sunday, April 9, 1589. Upon making his profession, Caracciolo took the name Francis in honor of the saint of Assisi.\n\nThe new Congregation of the Clerics Regular Minor thus established was one of considerable severity. The Clerics bound themselves to various practices of daily penance. It was decided that each day one brother should fast on bread and water, another would take the discipline, and a third would wear the hair shirt. Later (under the direction of St. Francis) it was further decreed that everyone should spend an hour a day in prayer before the Blessed Sacrament.\n\nThe Order's principal founder, Giovanni Adorno, died in early 1593, and despite his refusal, Francis Caracciolo was chosen general on March 9, 1593, in the first house of the congregation in Naples, called St. Mary Major or Pietrasanta, given to the congregation by Sixtus V. Even in his capacity as superior of the Order, he insisted on sharing simple tasks: sweeping rooms, making beds, washing dishes. As a priest Francis spent many hours in the confessional. Here he was enriched with the gifts of prophecy and the reading of hearts. He also begged in the streets for the poor and gave away most of his possessions to the needy. But it was his devotion to the Blessed Sacrament for which St. Francis Caracciolo is most noted and remembered. Such was his love for the Real Presence of Christ in the Holy Eucharist, that he would spend almost the entire night in adoration. The little sleep he allowed himself was often spent on one of the altar steps.\n\nHe made three journeys to Spain to establish foundations under the protection of kings Philip II and Philip III. He opened the house of the Holy Ghost at Madrid on January 20, 1599, that of Our Lady of the Annunciation at Valladolid on September 9, 1601, and that of St. Joseph at Alcalá sometime in 1601, for teaching science. In Rome he obtained possession of St. Leonard's Church, which he afterwards exchanged for that of Sant'Agnese in Agone, September 18, 1598, and later he secured for the institute the church of San Lorenzo in Lucina (June 11, 1606) which was made over to him by a papal bull of Pope Paul V, (which was, however, annulled by the bull \"\"Susceptum\"\" of Pope Pius X, November 9, 1906).\n\nSt Francis Caracciolo was the author of \"\"Le sette stazioni sopra la Passione di N.S. Gesù Christo\"\" (\"The Seven Stations of the Passion of Our Lord\", Rome, 1710). He loved the poor. Like Saint Thomas Aquinas, a relative on his mother's side, his purity was angelic, according to the Catholic Encyclopedia. Pope Paul V desired to confer an important bishopric on him, but he steadfastly refused it.\n\nRemaining general superior for seven years, Francis at last obtained permission from Pope Clement VIII to resign. The position had been a severe strain upon him, not only because of his delicate health, but also because in establishing and extending the order, he found himself and his brethren faced with opposition, misrepresentation, and sometimes by malicious calumnies.\n\nFrancis was then named prior of Santa Maria Maggiore and novice-master. He carried on his apostolic work in the confessional and in the pulpit, discoursing so constantly and movingly on the divine goodness to man that he was called \"The Preacher of the Love of God\". We are also told that with the sign of the cross he restored health to many sick persons.\n\nIn presence of his divine Lord, the face of St. Francis usually emitted brilliant rays of light; and he often bathed the ground with his tears when he prayed, according to his custom, prostrate on his face before the tabernacle, and constantly repeating from psalm 68, as one devoured by internal fire,\"\"Zelus domus tuae comedit me\"\", \"The zeal of Thy house hath eaten me up.\" \n\nInvited by the Oratorians at Agnone, in the Molise region, to convert their house into a college for his congregation, St. Francis set out to help with the new foundation. On his way he visited Loreto, where he was granted the favor of spending the night in prayer in the chapel of the Holy House, the Basilica della Santa Casa. As he was invoking Our Lady's help on behalf of his brethren, Giovanni Adorno appeared to him in a dream or a vision, and announced his approaching death. He arrived at Agnone apparently in good health, but he himself was under no illusion. On the first day of June, 1608, he was seized with a fever which rapidly increased, and he dictated a fervent letter urging the members of the society to remain faithful to the rule. On the Vigil of Corpus Christi, Wednesday, June 4, 1608, he seemed absorbed in meditation until an hour before sunset when he suddenly cried out, \"Let us go, Let us go to heaven!\" Scarcely had these words been uttered when his wish was realized and he passed to his reward. He was forty-four years of age.\n\nWhen his body was opened after death, St. Francis' heart was found as it were burnt up, and these words imprinted around it: \"\"Zelus domus Tuæ comedit me\"\"—\"The zeal of Thy house hath eaten me up.\"\nSt. Francis Caracciolo was beatified by Pope Clement XIV on June 4, 1769, and canonized by Pope Pius VII on May 24, 1807. His liturgical feast day is June 4. In 1838 he was chosen as a patron saint of Naples, where his body lies. At first he was buried in Basilica of St. Mary Major, but his remains were afterwards translated to the church of Santa Maria di Monteverginella, which was given in exchange to the Clerics Regular Minor (1823) after their suppression at the time of the French Revolution.\n\nSt Francis is also the patron of Italian cooks.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1792610", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1792610", "title": "Alandroal", "text": "Alandroal\n\nAlandroal () is a municipality in the Portuguese district of Évora located on the eastern frontier with Spain along the right margin of the Guadiana River in the Central Alentejo region. It is located above sea level, northeast of Évora and southeast of Estremoz. The population in 2011 was 5,843, in an area of 542.68 km².\n\nWith the completion of the castle in 1298, by Lourenço Afonso (9th Master of the Order of Aviz), the noble fulfilled his obligation to King Denis of Portugal to expand the territory that would form Alandroal. By 1359, the church of Alandroal was incorporated under the commander of the Order of Avis, but it was only a century later (1486) that John II would issue a foral (\"charter\") for the town. Alandroal was elevated to town at this time, while only including the parish of Nossa Senhora da Conceição. A second foral was conceded in 1514 by his successor, Manuel I of Portugal.\n\nAlandroal's historic importance include the medieval structures during the early period of Christian conquest, including the Castle of Alandroal (whose main gate was flanked by two towers); the Castle of Terena, consisting of wall-enclosed courtyard, keep and towers; the fortress of Juromenha, whose balusters were constructed later during the Portuguese Restoration War, but whose proximity to the Guadiana frontier provided a natural buttress to Castilian influence in the region.\n\nThe lands at the time, flowered with Nerium oleander shrubs and trees, whose wood was used by local artisans. Its Portuguese toponomy \"oleandro\" gave rise to the name \"aloendros\" or \"alandros\", eventually \"alandroal\".\n\nThe sanctuary of Nossa Senhora da Assunção da Boa Nova, apart from its religious importance, is of national importance. In 1340, the Moors had invaded from Andaluzia, resulting in an alliance between Alfonso XI of Castile and his father-in-law, Afonso IV of Portugal, that culminated in the Battle of Río Salado. In honor of their assistance during the Marinid invasion, Maria of Portugal, Queen of Castile ordered the construction of the Gothic church to commemorate their victory.\n\nIn the 16th century the old Gothic church was substituted but the current parochial church in Alandroal. At the same time, the hermitage of Nossa Senhora das Neves, in the older lands of Mata, then known as Nossa Senhora das Hervas, received annual festivals on 5 August. Similarly, the brotherhood of the Misercórdia was probably established this century, constructing the primitive temple for those religious services.\n\nOn 14 January 1659, a gunpowder warehouse exploded, causing the deaths of various residents, but primarily university students from Évora (under the authority of Father Francisco Soares), who were dispatched to Alandroal while the main Portuguese army fought in the Battle of the Lines of Elvas.\n\nThe effects of the 1755 Lisbon earthquake resulted in destruction of various buildings.\n\nBy the second half of the 18th century, a decision of the Council of State to King Joseph I permitted the construction of a new municipal building for Alandroal, for which were acquired furniture from local and awnings for the market.\n\nDuring the 19th Century territories of the older municipalities of Terena and Juromenha where annexed to Alandroal. The community of Villarreal, situated in the municipality of Olivença was once a part of the antique administration of Juromenha.\n\nThe municipality is delimited in the north by Vila Viçosa, east by the Guadiana River and Spanish border, south by Mourão and Reguengos de Monsaraz, and west by the municipality of Redondo. Alandroal is one of three towns defined within the municipality of the same name, and includes the \"vilas\" of Terena and Juromenha.\n\nThe morphology of Alandroal is marked by a gently rolling relief with a minimum of altitude, with exceptions to this including Patinhas, and Castelo mountain . The Alqueva Dam, along the Guadiana River, is located in this territory, with major confluences including the Ribeira de Alcalate and Ribeira do Alandroal just the principal water resources.\n\nThe climate of Alandroal is a markedly Mediterranean temperament, characterized by a dry climate that is accentuated in the summer. Precipitation in the region hovers between between October and March, and , during the dry season, which is irregular.\n\nThe municipality covers approximately and has 6585 inhabitants (based on the 2001 census).\n\nThe municipality is subdivided into four civil parishes:\n\nThe city of Alandroal is one of three towns in the municipality, along with Terena and Juromenha.\n\nThe municipality's economic activities are connected to the primary and secondary sectors primarily. Agriculture continues to be important, with the cultivation of cereals, foraging and industrial plants, such as olive orchards dominating the rural landscape. The raising of livestock, namely poultry, swine and cattle, also draws on local resources, while 36.3% (or 1711 hectares) of the territory is covered in forests, allowing a nascent saw-milling and carpentry industry.\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular and religious festivals in the municipality include the annual pilgrimage to the sanctuary of Nossa Senhora da Boa Nova in Terena, during the Easter Sunday; the fair of São Bento, on 15 April; and the fair in Juromenha, on 10 August.\n\nLocal artisans are also proficient in working with cork, nerium woods and schist stone.\n\n\n\n"}

In 2015, he received the IIFA Award for outstanding contribution to Indian Cinema.\n\nBorn in Nagpur, India, Subhash Ghai's father was a dentist in Delhi. Ghai graduated in commerce from Rohtak, Haryana, and then went on to graduate in Cinema from the Film and Television Institute of India, Pune.\n\nIn an interview with Rajya Sabha TV, Ghai recounted that after passing out from FTII, he came to Bombay, but was not allowed to enter any studio as he was unknown. He then read self help books like Dale Carnegie's How to Win friends and influence people, and used techniques given in it to help him try and enter the film industry. At the same time, he learnt of and entered a United Producers Filmfare talent contest. Of the 5,000 participants, three people were selected in it, he, Rajesh Khanna and Dheeraj Kumar. While Khanna received a role soon after, Ghai received a role an year later.\n\nGhai started his career in Hindi cinema as an actor with small roles in films including \"Taqdeer\" (1967) and \"Aradhana\" (1971).

It was also dubbed in Tamil as \"Thaalam\". It was very successful in India and overseas, becoming the first Indian film to reach the top 20 on \"Variety\"'s box office list. Anil Kapoor, A. R. Rahman, Alka Yagnik and Anand Bakshi each won a Filmfare Award for their work in the film. Aishwarya Rai was nominated for Filmfare Best Actress Award and Star Screen Award Best Actress for her performance.\n\nWhen the wealthy and affluent family of Mr. Jagmohan Mehta (Amrish Puri) and his son Manav (Akshaye Khanna) arrive in Chamba, India for a long vacation, they meet the beautiful daughter, Mansi (Aishwarya Rai) of a poor spiritual singer named Tara Babu (Alok Nath).\n\nJagmohan Mehta, as the owner of the Mehta & Mehta Group of Companies, is looking into investing in Chamba with his adroit son Manav, and as days fly by, Jagmohan and Tara Babu become acquainted and friendly towards each other.\n\nEventually, Manav and Mansi also get to know each other and bond and then fall in love.\n\nWhen Manav informs his father of his relationship and intention to marry Mansi, Jagmohan is reluctant because Mansi comes from a very poor social-economic status and might not fit in but, the Mehta and Babu families continue to remain friendly and cordial.\n\nWhen she hears about this, Mansi is distressed with Manav's father's reaction to the marriage proposal idea, but her lover assures he will convince his father to change his mind, and Mansi gives him a shawl with the embroidery of their names juxtaposed as \"Manavsi\".\n\nWhen Mansi's father learns of Manav and Mansi's affair he is at first angry, but soon agrees to travel to Mumbai to visit his cousin Prabha, who is a news reporter, and to meet Manav's family.\n\nUnfortunately, Tara Babu is insulted by Jagmohan's sister-in-law, brother, and the employees and endure hostile treatment. She and her father then leave the Mehta household deeply hurt, and Mansi makes it clear to Manav to leave her alone from now on — no more relationship.\n\nMansi soon meets Vikrant Kapoor (Anil Kapoor), a successful and famous music producer/director, who happens to be a fan of Tara Babu's work. With the encouragement of her uncle Prabha, she signs a three-year contract with Vikrant, and Mansi performs dance numbers and remixes of Tara Babu's songs as well as some of Vikrant's productions. She wins awards and becomes a sensation in India. In the meantime, Vikrant starts to fall in love with Mansi.\n\nMatters are further complicated when Manav finds out that his family was in the wrong when they treated Mansi and her father ill and promises them that they will end up having a family photo with Mansi in it as well. Manav arrives to apologise to Mansi for what he and his family did, and she rejects him out of grief for how he treated her father. He tells her how she will come back to him. Manav's father also doesn't allow him to marry Mansi and promises his father that he will be the one who brings Mansi back to him.\n\nVikrant learns of what happened between Manav and Mansi, but he chooses to ignore it.

She accepts the proposal even though she is not in love with Vikrant. After winning an International MTV Award in Canada, she returns to India to prepare for her marriage to Vikrant.\n\nIn the meantime, Jagmohan and Tara Babu patch things up after Jagmohan realises his mistake and apologises sincerely for his misbehaviour.\n\nOn the wedding day itself, Manav confronts Mansi one last time – hoping that she will honour her love for him and not marry Vikrant.\n\nVikrant soon realises, after seeing Mansi's reaction on seeing Manav, that she loves Manav. He assures her that the three of them can still be friends, and urges her to honour her love to Manav. Jagmohan and Tara Babu also encourage her with the same and give their blessings, to which Manav and Mansi finally embrace.\n\nManav's family takes a family picture at the Mehta household after the wedding of Mansi and Manav, as he had promised it would happen.\n\nThe soundtrack of the film was composed by A. R. Rahman with lyrics penned by Anand Bakshi. \nThe soundtrack was released on 12 June 1999 and it become a big critical and commercial success. At a press conference, Ghai remarked, \"I credit the name of the movie to composer A.R.Rahman. This movie is a romance and I could have called it any thing – \"Dil\", \"Pyaar\", \"Hum Bhaag Gaye\", but it was Rahman's presence in the movie that gave me the confidence to call it \"Taal\". \"Taal\" means music and music means \"Taal\". The whole credit goes to A.R.Rahman and Anand Bakshi. Rahman kept me awake many nights, but after listening to the songs, I felt it was worth all the trouble.\"\n\nThe soundtrack became a tremendous success, and was sold more than 1.85million units within a month of its release. It went on to sell 4million units, becoming the best-selling soundtrack for a 1999 Hindi film. The soundtrack made the list of \"Greatest Bollywood Soundtracks of All Time\", as compiled by Planet Bollywood.\n\n'Hindi Track'\n\n'Tamil Track'\n\nLyrics by Vairamuthu\n\n\"Taal\" was a hit at the box office in India and was the third highest-grossing film of the year. It was also the highest-grossing film in the overseas markets that year. In the United States, it became the first Indian film to reach the top 20 on \"Variety\"'s box office list. \"Taal\" also made the list of the weekly top ten grossing films in the United Kingdom. The film was screened at the Chicago International Film Festival and selected by Roger Ebert for his 2005 Overlooked Film Festival.\n\nSubhash Ghai wanted Shahrukh Khan and Mahima Chaudhary, but that didn't happen. Then the film offer then went to Manisha Koirala who had a strong background of films then, but could not do it. Aishwarya Rai was then cast. This film was a game changer for Aishwarya. Akshaye Khanna was then cast to replace SRK.\n\nAnil Kapoor won many awards for his role as Vikrant Kapoor (the role went to him after Govinda declined it) including Filmfare Best Supporting Actor Award, IIFA Best Supporting Actor Award, Zee Cine Best Supporting Actor Award, and Star Screen Award for Best Supporting Actor Award. Singer Alka Yagnik won the Filmfare award for Best Female Playback for the song \"Taal Se Taal Mila\". Composer A. R.

{"id": "1792627", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1792627", "title": "Sandmeyer reaction", "text": "Sandmeyer reaction\n\nThe Sandmeyer reaction is a chemical reaction used to synthesize aryl halides from aryl diazonium salts using copper salts as reagents or catalysts.\nIt is an example of a radical-nucleophilic aromatic substitution. The Sandmeyer reaction provides a method through which one can perform unique transformations on benzene, such as halogenation, cyanation, trifluoromethylation, and hydroxylation. \n\nThe reaction was discovered in 1884 by Swiss chemist Traugott Sandmeyer, when he attempted to synthesize phenylacetylene from benzenediazonium chloride and cuprous acetylide. Instead, the main product he isolated was phenyl chloride. In modern times, the Sandmeyer reaction refers to any method for substitution of an aromatic amino group via preparation of its diazonium salt followed by its displacement with a nucleophile in the presence of catalytic copper(I) salts. (Due to the low cost of copper salts, a stoichiometric amount is often employed for better reactivity even when catalysis is possible.) The most commonly employed Sandmeyer reactions are the chlorination, bromination, cyanation, and hydroxylation reactions using CuCl, CuBr, CuCN, and CuO, respectively. More recently, trifluoromethylation of diazonium salts has been developed and is referred to as a 'Sandmeyer-type' reaction. Diazonium salts also react with boronates, iodide, thiols, water, hypophosphorous acid and others, and fluorination can be carried out using tetrafluoroborate anions (Balz–Schiemann reaction). However, since these processes do not require a metal catalyst, they are not usually referred to as Sandmeyer reactions. In numerous variants that have been developed, other transition metal salts, including copper(II), iron(III) and cobalt(III) have also been employed. Due to its wide synthetic applicability, the Sandmeyer reaction, along with other transformations of diazonium compounds, is complementary to electrophilic aromatic substitution.\n\nThe nitrous acid is typically prepared \"in situ\" from sodium nitrite and acid. Following two protonation steps, one equivalent of water is lost to form the nitrosonium ion. The nitrosonium ion then acts as an electrophile in a reaction with an aromatic (or heterocyclic) amine, such as aniline, to form a diazonium salt, proceeding through a nitrosamine intermediate. Typical reaction conditions are as follows:\n\n\"Chlorination:\" ArNCl, CuCl, HCl (36% aq.), 50 – 100 °C; \"bromination:\" ArNHSO, CuBr, HBr (48% aq.), 50 – 100 °C; \"cyanation:\" ArNCl, CuCN, KCN, HO, benzene, 0 °C; \"hydroxylation:\" CuO, Cu(NO), HO, 25 °C.\n\nThe Sandmeyer reaction is an example of a radical-nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SAr). The radical mechanism of the Sandmeyer reaction is supported by the detection of biaryl byproducts. The substitution of the aromatic diazo group with a halogen or pseudohalogen is initiated by a one-electron transfer mechanism catalyzed by copper(I) to form an aryl radical with loss of nitrogen gas. The substituted arene is possibly formed by direct transfer of Cl, Br, CN, or OH from a copper(II) species to the aryl radical to produce the substituted arene and regenerate the copper(I) catalyst. In an alternative proposal, a transient copper(III) intermediate, formed from coupling of the aryl radical with the copper(II) species, undergoes rapid reductive elimination to afford the product and regenerate copper(I). However, evidence for such an organocopper intermediate is weak and mostly circumstantial, and the exact pathway may depend on the substrate and reaction conditions. These possibilities are shown below.\n\nVariations on the Sandmeyer reaction have been developed to fit multiple synthetic applications. These reactions typically proceed through the formation of an aryl diazonium salt followed by a reaction with a copper(I) salt to yield a substituted arene according to the scheme below.\nSome examples of the synthetic applications of the Sandmeyer reaction are provided below.\n\nOne of the most important uses of the Sandmeyer reaction is the formation of aryl halides. The solvent of choice for the synthesis of aryl iodides is diiodomethane, while for the synthesis of aryl bromides, bromoform is used. For the synthesis of aryl chlorides, chloroform is the solvent of choice. The synthesis of (+)-curcuphenol, a bioactive compound that displays antifungal and anticancer activity, employs the Sandmeyer reaction to substitute an amine group by a bromo group.\nOne bromination protocol employs a Cu(I)/Cu(II) mixture with additional amounts of the bidentate ligand phenanthroline and phase-transfer catalyst dibenzo-18-crown-6 to convert an aryl diazonium tetrafluoroborate salt to an aryl bromide.\n\nThe Balz–Schiemann reaction uses tetrafluoroborate and delivers the halide-substituted product, fluorobenzene, which is not obtained by the use of copper fluorides. This reaction displays motifs characteristic of the Sandmeyer reaction.\n\nAnother use of the Sandmeyer reaction is for cyanation which allows for the formation of benzonitriles, an important class of organic compounds. A key intermediate in the synthesis of the anti-psychotic drug, Fluanxol, is synthesized by a cyanation through the Sandmeyer reaction.\nThe Sandmeyer reaction has also been employed in the synthesis of neoamphimedine, a compound that is suggested to target topoisomerase II as an anti-cancer drug.\n\nIt has been demonstrated that Sandmeyer-type reactions can be used to generate aryl compounds functionalized by trifluoromethyl substituent groups. This process of trifluoromethylation provides unique chemical properties with a wide variety of practical applications. Particularly, pharmaceuticals with CF groups have enhanced metabolic stability, lipophilicity, and bioavailability. Sandmeyer-type trifluoromethylation reactions feature mild reaction conditions and greater functional group tolerance relative to earlier methods of trifluoromethylation. An example of a Sandmeyer-type trifluoromethylation reaction is presented below.\n\nThe Sandmeyer reaction can also be used to convert aryl amines to phenols proceeding through the formation of an aryl diazonium salt as shown below. In the presence of copper catalyst, this reaction takes place readily at room temperature. The procedure reported by Cohen and coworkers calls for cuprous oxide together with an excess of cupric nitrate in neutral water. This is in contrast to the classical procedure (known by the German name \"Verkochung\", ), which calls for boiling the diazonium salt in aqueous acid, a process that is believed to involve the aryl cation instead of radical and is known to generate other nucleophilic addition side products in addition to the desired hydroxylation product. \n\nTreatment with a second equivalent of aniline would give a triazene. Compare for example, Diminazene (Berenil), and Isometamidium chloride.\n\n"}

The 40th overall episode and the final part of The Meteor Shower Trilogy, the episode describes what happens to Kyle and Kenny as they attend a Jewish Scouting camp on the night of the meteor shower. The episode satirizes Jewish stereotypes and originally aired on July 28, 1999.\n\nSheila and Gerald Broflovski are getting ready to go to Mr. Mackey's meteor shower party. Kyle and his brother Ike are preparing to go to Jewbilee camp: a Boy Scout-esque camp for Jewish boys with separate programs called \"Jew Scouts\" and \"Squirts\". When Kenny arrives at Kyle's house to hang out, Kyle invites him to go with him to Jewbilee, so it would not \"suck so hard.\" Kyle's parents explain to Kenny that because he is not Jewish, he might not be accepted at Jewbilee. Kyle tells his parents that \"Kenny will believe whatever you tell him to\" and asks his parents if they can take Kenny with them. They then grant Kenny permission and explain to him the basic tenets of Judaism on the car ride to Jewbilee. Once they arrive, Sheila tells the boys to have fun and advises Kenny to \"act Jewish\". She and Gerald then leave for Mr. Mackey's party.\n\nKenny then becomes initiated, despite not being Jewish. Meanwhile, Ike is assigned to go with the other tots to the Squirts camp, which is a Cub Scout-esque camp. After the initiation ceremonies, the boys make soap sculptures to honor their god Moses who demands arts-and-crafts-like things, including macaroni pictures that the Squirts were supposed to make, and popcorn necklaces. Kenny is then identified as not being Jewish and is banished from the camp. As he tries to reach home, the ATF and a couple of police cars are seen driving by, away from Mr. Mackey's house, where they thought a cult was residing. He then returns to the camp where Garth, the elder of the \"Anti-Semitic Jews\" sect, has captured Moses in a conch shell and has locked everyone else in a cabin at gunpoint while he tries to summon Haman to be the new leader.\n\nMeanwhile, the Squirts master, Shlomo, wants to capture the bear the Broflovskis saw earlier in the episode, but only so he can get his chutzpah badge and therefore become a master Scouts rather than Squirts. The bear kidnaps the Squirts one by one, and Shlomo continues to devise plans that ultimately fail. Soon, the bear captures all the Squirts and Shlomo has to go to the Warden, but is shot in the shoulder by Garth, when he tries to release Moses from the conch shell in which he is trapped. Kenny gets captured by the bear only to find that the bear was not killing the Squirts but was finding friends for her cub, who was celebrating its birthday. Kenny gets the Squirts and they make their way back to Shlomo and they head back to camp to find everyone else in trouble. The Squirts stand on top of one another to reach the keys and unlock everyone from the cabin, as Kenny saves the day by smashing his head against the conch shell to free Moses, and Haman is defeated. Moses then kills Garth, and as everyone discovers Kenny died smashing open the conch shell, Moses declares the Jews shall meet every year on that day to celebrate Kenny by making macaroni pictures and paper plate bean shakers decorated with glue and glitter.\n\nThe writing process of \"Jewbilee\" helped \"South Park\" co-creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone realize the approach to writing most suited for the show. The episode had to be aired about a month after the film \"\" was released, at which time Parker and Stone could take a break from their intensive work. They were pleased with their work on both the show and the film and decided not to care about how good the episode was, and \"just make it dumb and weird.\" Eventually, they came to believe that \"Jewbilee\" was then one of the best episodes of the show, which helped them realize that they should not try to think of the plots for too long, but \"just be stupid and have fun.\"\n\nThe Moses character is Parker's favorite aspect of the episode. His appearance is patterned after the Master Control Program from the film \"Tron\".\n\nJohn Sinnott of \"DVD Talk\" stated that the episode is one of the third season's \"strange shows that worked very well.\" In an article about Isaac Hayes' departure controversy, \"The Seattle Times\" referred to \"Jewbilee\" as one of the show's most outrageous episodes.\n\n"}

Savol has a son named Brandon. He has been married to Risa since August 2012. The couple resides in Cleveland, where Savol continues to sing professionally.\n\nDuring the American Idol competition, \"The Smoking Gun\" reported that Savol had previously been charged with misdemeanor assault for hitting his girlfriend and mother of his son, Michele Martin, with a telephone on February 14, 2001 so hard that the phone broke. Savol pleaded the charge down to disorderly conduct, for which he received probation and was ordered to complete a domestic abuse or anger management class; his girlfriend received a temporary restraining order against him. \"Idol\" producers responded that Savol had already disclosed this incident to them and that \"considering Scott's honesty and his remorse, the situation did not warrant his disqualification.\"\n\nSavol made it into the final five on \"Idol\" and then became the eighth contestant to be voted off the show, on May 4, after singing George Benson's version of \"On Broadway\" and Brian McKnight's \"Everytime You Go Away\" during a dual-themed week of songs written by Leiber and Stoller and songs presently on the Billboard charts. During his run on the show, Savol was affectionately dubbed \"Scotty the Body\" by \"Idol\" host Ryan Seacrest.\n\nThe fact that Savol outlasted many singers who were often considered superior to him (such as Nikko Smith, Nadia Turner, Constantine Maroulis, Jessica Sierra and Anwar Robinson) led many commentators to speculate that a portion of Savol's \"fan base\" actually consisted of people who were attempting to destroy the credibility of \"American Idol\" by voting for someone they considered the worst finalist. Other people suggested Savol was supported by Christian voters because Savol frequently thanked God after his performances, or by voters who saw him as an underdog or \"regular Joe\" due to his lack of stereotypical pop star looks. Often, he would draw comparisons to actors Mark Addy and Kevin James.\n\n\nSavol performed for a brief stint at the Lubbock Memorial Civic Center in Lubbock, Texas, as the Cowardly Lion, in Todrick Hall's retelling of \"The Wizard of Oz\". Oz, the Musical sold out both nights. He starred alongside Season Two alumni Rickey Smith as the Tinman, Season 4 alumna Mikalah Gordon as Dorothy, and Vonzell Solomon as Glinda/Aunt Em. He has an upcoming song titled \"Don't Rush,\" produced by Washington, DC based production team The BeatMoguls, that is hitting the airwaves.\n\nIn June 2008, Savol starred as one of the headliners for a live music show in Branson, Missouri named \"America's Favorite Finalists.\" The show featured 6 top 12 \"American Idol\" Finalists performing their own music, cover songs and group numbers. The show ran at the Grand Palace and was produced by Steve Drummond.\n\nFrom the summer of 2009 until the spring of 2010, Savol starred as Billy, in Garrett Davis's play \"The Lord Will Make a Way.\"\n\nSavol signed with Mahoning Valley Records and began recording his debut album in January 2010, and the album \"In Spite of All\" was released late 2011. Producers for the album include Kevin Deane, Sim Stevenson, William B. Smith, Kene Bell and Savol himself.

It is one of the oldest collegiate band programs in the country. Its instrumentation in 1883 was entirely made up of cornets. The band continued to grow to between thirteen and seventeen members, and in 1892, it was reorganized under Ernest H. Garratt. \nThe band wore West Point-style uniforms like the rest of the cadets in the Military Department and had a more varied repertoire of instruments, including a clarinet.\n\nAt the turn of the twentieth century, William A. Knabe was appointed as band director. He was the first “full-time” band director; Garratt had also served as an organist, choirmaster, musical director, and director of the Glee Club. UT won the first (documented) game at which the band performed in 1902.\n\nBy 1917, the band had changed to World War I style uniforms and doubled in size. The band grew along with the military units on campus. By 1935, the band boasted eighty-five members, but remained all male due to the band’s continued association with the Military Department. In 1937, an all-female contingent called the \"Volettes\" began performing with the band. Its membership ranged from fifty to ninety.\n\nThe 1940s brought women into the band. Two of the first women to play with the band were Martha Carroll, who played the lyre, and Marjorie Abbott, a marimba player. By 1946, women outnumbered the male members of the band, due to World War II and the death of male students. By 1949, the band was once again all male, but retained female majorettes. Major Walter Ryba was properties master for the Army and Air Force ROTC at Knoxville and also for the Army ROTC at the UT-Martin campus.\n\nThe name \"Pride of the Southland\" was a group decision of the band members themselves, on the morning of October 15, 1949, as they stood around on the sidelines at Legion Field in Birmingham, Alabama awaiting a chance to practice for the afternoon game. They were waiting for Alabama's Million Dollar Band, under the direction of \"Colonel\" Butler, to finish its practice. That afternoon as the band came out on the field and paused for introduction, for the first time \"Presenting The University of Tennessee's Pride of the Southland Band under the direction of 'Major' Walter M. Ryba\" was heard over the loudspeakers by the 44,000 fans present and listeners on the radio. It was generally felt that Ryba did not know ahead of time that he was receiving a \"commission\".\n\nIn 1961, Tennessee native W J Julian (1922-2015) was hired as an associate professor and director of the UT bands. Under Julian's leadership the band grew in size, prestige, and reputation. The band was then removed from the ROTC department and placed under the Music Education Department. Julian designed the band’s black, orange, white, and creme-colored uniforms, which paid homage to the band’s military past and are still in use to this day. Some of the many traditions established under Julian's direction are: the band's signature \"Big Orange Sound\"; its pregame formations; forming the T for the team to run through; Rocky Top; and Circle Drills, a geometric and kaleidoscopic drill concept from which many drills were derived through his and his immediate successors' tenures.\n\nAlthough Julian retired in 1993, the band still upholds the tradition of excellence he set. Besides representing the State of Tennessee in 13 presidential inaugurations, the band has appeared at the many bowl games the Vol football team has traveled to throughout the nation. Additionally, due to Julian's influence, the Pride is one of only two SEC bands with a strutting Big Ten-style drum major.\n\nIn March 2007, The Pride traveled to Dublin, Ireland, to play at various concerts and in the St. Patrick's Day Parade.\n\nDirector of Bands Gary Sousa was removed from his post October 14, 2013, and placed on administrative leave by the university after a public confrontation with the UT Athletic Department. Donald Ryder was then appointed interim Director of Bands, and Michael Stewart was appointed interim Associate Director. On January 29, 2015 it was announced that Ryder would permanently serve as Director of Bands and W J Julian Professor of Music, and Stewart would permanently serve as Associate Director of Bands.\n\nThe UT Marching Band is an entirely mobile unit; its halftime complement usually includes around 200 wind instruments (necessitated by the optimal number of people to create the geometry of circle drills); a line of non-pitched and indefinite pitched percussion (pitched percussion instruments like bells and xylophones are never utilized, nor is sideline or \"pit\" percussion); 24 or 32 color guard; 10 majorettes; and one drum major. The UT band customarily enters the field live, playing music from the initial step-off from the sideline; it also exits the field live, most often to the music of the \"Tennessee Waltz March\".\"\"\n\nThe Pride's pregame show was designed by Julian with musical arrangements by Warren Clark and Barry McDonald. This six minute and forty-five second show has remained largely unchanged since the 1960s. It begins with the drumline starting off a cadence as the band marches onto the field. Then, part of the \"Tennessee Waltz March,\" a march version of the \"Tennessee Waltz\" in common time, is played as the band forms a block formation. The band then plays the National Anthem in this formation. Then the full version of the \"Tennessee Waltz March\" followed by, starting in the 2007 season, a march version of Alabama's \"Tennessee River\", then the \"Alma Mater March\". As they march back playing the \"Alma Mater March,\" they spell out VOLS. Then the visiting team's fight song is played in the direction of the opposing team's band and student section. After this, the band forms the traditional interlocking \"U\" and \"T\" and marches this across the majority of the field accompanied by \"Rocky Top\". Then the \"Power T\" is formed while \"Spirit of the Hill\" is played. Once the \"Power T\" is formed, all the Vols fans are asked to join in the Volunteer Wave and the crowd spells out \"V-O-L-S\" and chant \"Go Vols Go!\" Then the Pride of the Southland's Drum Major runs through the middle of this formation. The band then marches across the field until it reaches the opposite end zone. At this point, \"Stars and Stripes Forever\" is played and the band forms a large \"USA\" to the visiting sideline, then inverts the form to face the front sideline. The band then plays \"Fight Vols Fight\" as they form the giant T formation which then opens up as the football team runs through while \"Down the Field\" is played. The band then turns and marches off the field to \"Fight Vols Fight\" while keeping the T formation.\n\nAlthough the T formation is used almost exclusively at UT home games in Neyland Stadium, it has been done at other venues, most notably at the 1986 and 1991 Sugar Bowl.\n\nJulian introduced \"Rocky Top\" in a halftime show in 1972, after which it made its way to the stands. The song has become so closely identified with the Vols that many believe it to be the school's official fight song. Indeed, an early version of the SEC's Web site included a recording of \"Rocky Top\" as Tennessee's fight song. However, Tennessee's official fight song is \"Down the Field.\"\n\nRocky Top was written by Felice and Boudleaux Bryant in 1967 and recorded by The Osborne Brothers that same year. The song celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2017.\n\nThe oldest tradition of the Pride of the Southland comes at the end of every home halftime show where the Pride plays Spirit of the Hill and forms an interlocking UT with the year 1794 or, more recently, on one side of the field a U and on the other side a T, on the field from 2010 to 2015. The year 1794 returned in 2016. This is the longest lasting tradition of the band dating back more than one hundred years.\n\nAfter forming the interlocking UT at the end of every home halftime show, the Pride plays the Alma Mater. UT's Alma Mater was officially adopted in 1928 after a yearlong contest sponsored by the school's musical organizations. A Chattanoogan, Mary Fleming Meek, won the $50 prize with her song entitled \"On a Hallowed Hill.\" Although Mrs. Meek was not an alumna of UT, both her husband, John Lamar Meek, and her son were graduates, and her father was a former trustee of the university. Another tradition of the Pride is to interlock arms and sing the Alma Mater prior to marching to the stadium for every home football game.\n\nAt every home game, the Pride performs the \"March to the Stadium\", which includes a parade sequence and climaxes when the Band stops at the bottom of \"The Hill\" (the oldest section of campus which resides upon the tallest hill right next to Neyland Stadium) and performs the \"Salute to The Hill\", a homage to the history and legacy of the University. The parade begins an hour and forty minutes before kickoff. You can watch the Salute to \"The Hill\" on YouTube.\n\nWith the exception of 2013, Pride of the Southland has represented the state of Tennessee for all Presidential Inaugurations since 1953, the most of any non-military band.\n"}

These converged devices have the advantages (compared to a separate TV and VCR) of saving space and increasing portability. Such units entered the market during the mid-to-late 1980s when VCRs had become ubiquitous household devices. By this time, the VHS format had become standard; thus the vast majority of TV/VCR combos are VHS-based.\n\nMost combo units have RCA connecters on the front and/or back to connect a home video game console or a camcorder. Some units also have a headphone jack to watch media without disturbing others. \n\nThough nearly all TV/VCR combination sets have monaural (mono) sound though with stereo soundtrack compatibility, there are a large number of TV/VCR combos with a stereo TV tuner, but a mono VCR (some may even include a mono sound input alongside a composite video input. Some models from Panasonic also included an FM tuner. A major exception to this convention is TV/DVD combos, which can have a stereo VCR included in the unit (i.e. a TV/VCR/DVD combo). One of the major drawbacks of a TV/DVD/VCR combo is that the integrated activate the CSS programming on the DVD player portion, making it impossible to watch DVDs on the unit.\n\nModern televisions tend to be mostly solid state machines, while VCRs require mechanical manipulation of VHS tape and require occasional servicing. For this reason, it is not uncommon for the VCR component to cease functioning or to become unreliable years before a similar fate befalls the television component. This leaves users with only \"half\" of the set in operation and a more expensive repair or replacement.\n\nAs late as 2006, flat-panel TVs with integrated DVD players appeared on the market, and integrated TV/DVD sets started overtaking the TV/VCR market. This is due to both the low price and overwhelming availability of DVDs and more compact form factor, as opposed to the increasingly rare video cassettes and near-extinction of cathode ray tube displays in the consumer market.\n\nSome of the earliest combo TVs with a built-in video playback device were ones that supported Cartrivision. Cartrivision-equipped TVs date back before even the introduction of VHS or stand-alone video playback devices in the consumer market (but with the exception of some open reel video playback devices that could be connected to TVs back in the 1960s), which the majority of combo TVs had in the late 1980s and 1990s.\n\nDuring the era of their popularity, many of these units displayed product videos in stores or for other commercial displays. Unlike most standalone VCRs, many could play back a tape over and over again. After each play, the tape would automatically rewind, usually showing just a blue screen during the process, and restart as soon as rewinding was finished.\n\nSome fully functional computer systems or game consoles have been built into some models of TVs over time. Hewlett-Packard currently has a version of their TouchSmart line of computers with a built-in TV tuner, and even has a built-in DVR; also making it a TV/DVR combo which is a relatively rare concept. As of late 2006, Samsung introduced an LED TV with a proprietary operating system with Internet access to websites like Facebook, YouTube, Hulu, Netflix, and other sites. Other TV/Computer combo equipment can simply just be flatscreen TVs with USB ports which allows USB flash drives and external hard drives to be connected to allow for audio and video playback, in which it can give a streamlined, fully solid-state profile.\n\nAlmost every modern day TV sets have simplified CPUs and memory chips for basic functions such as channels and video settings, and video timing for LCD flat panels; however these examples are not sophisticated enough to qualify as significant examples. Other computer parts are used for real-time playback of DVDs on combo TVs with DVD player (and Blu-ray Disc for more high-end models) functionality; however these dedicated functions alone don't qualify as significant examples either.\n\nIn the modern day, the distinction between a combo TV and an all-in-one PC have blurred with the modern smart TV concept.\n\nIn the past, other attempts have been made to integrate computer functionality in CRT or display enclosures. However, prior to the concept of TVs with built-in computer motherboards, early portable computers had monitors of their own, but no TV tuner since it was a cost-prohibitive feature in the late 1970s/early 1980s. The Compucolor (followed by the Compucolor II of the 1970s was one of the first computer systems to be contained entirely within the casing of a video screen. Instead of being a functional computer system for hobbyist programming with a TV tuner, the tuner was removed from the casing of an RCA brand TV (GE for the Compucolor II) since such a feature during the 1970s would have been too costly for such an application. But such a device would be pulled off the market due to FCC concerns over a lack of radiation shielding from the CRT. As a notable example, but without a built-in TV tuner, The first model of the well-known Macintosh line of computers had a built-in monitor.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, Sharp introduced the C1 NES TV which was capable of playing NES and Famicom games and the first one to also have a TV tuner. Years later, in the mid-1990s, Apple Computer introduced the Macintosh TV (not to be confused with the current-day Apple TV set-top box) which was capable of capturing still images of TV broadcasts to the hard drive since hard drives at the time were not big enough for practical DVR use even though experimental use of hard drives for video capture only captured less than a minute of video back in the 1960s. Handheld game consoles such as the Game Gear had a full-color display housed with a CPU, but wasn't a true TV-computer combo unit since a modular TV tuner peripheral was required.\n\nRecent models like Sony's TV/computer combo system in its VAIO line of computers was discontinued due to being overpriced and underpowered for today's respective PC and TV markets.\n\n"}

{"id": "1792709", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1792709", "title": "Abu Zayd al-Balkhi", "text": "Abu Zayd al-Balkhi\n\nAbu Zayd Ahmed ibn Sahl Balkhi () was a Persian Muslim polymath: a geographer, mathematician, physician, psychologist and scientist. Born in 850 CE in Shamistiyan, in the province of Balkh, Khorasan (in modern-day Afghanistan), he was a disciple of al-Kindi. He was also the founder the \"Balkhī school\" of terrestrial mapping in Baghdad.\n\nOf the many books ascribed to him in the \"al-Fihrist\" by Ibn al-Nadim, one can note \"the excellency of mathematics\"; \"on certitude in astrology\". His \"Figures of the Climates\" (\"Suwar al-aqalim\") consisted chiefly of geographical maps. He also wrote the medical and psychological work, \"Masalih al-Abdan wa al-Anfus\" (\"Sustenance for Body and Soul\").\n\nA modern scholar describes the bulk of his works as \"more than sixty books and manuscripts, meticulously researching disciplines as varied in scope as geography, medicine, theology, politics, philosophy, poetry, literature, Arabic grammar, astrology, astronomy, mathematics, biography, ethics, sociology as well as others.\"\n\nHis \"Figures of the Regions\" (\"Suwar al-aqalim\") consisted chiefly of geographical maps. It led to him founding the \"Balkhī school\" of terrestrial mapping in Baghdad. The geographers of this school also wrote extensively of the peoples, products, and customs of areas in the Muslim world, with little interest in the non-Muslim realms.\n\nIn Islamic psychology, the concepts of mental health and \"mental hygiene\" were introduced by Abu Zayd al-Balkhi, who often related it to spiritual health. In his \"Masalih al-Abdan wa al-Anfus\" (\"Sustenance for Body and Soul\"), he was the first to successfully discuss diseases related to both the body and the soul. He used the term \"al-Tibb al-Ruhani\" to describe spiritual and psychological health, and the term \"Tibb al-Qalb\" to describe mental medicine. He criticized many medical doctors in his time for placing too much emphasis on physical illnesses and neglecting the psychological or mental illnesses of patients, and argued that \"since man’s construction\nis from both his soul and his body, therefore, human existence cannot be healthy without the \"ishtibak\" [interweaving or entangling] of soul and body.\" He further argued that \"if the body gets sick, the\n\"nafs\" [psyche] loses much of its cognitive and comprehensive ability and fails to enjoy the desirous aspects of life\" and that \"if the \"nafs\" gets sick, the body may also find no joy in life and may eventually\ndevelop a physical illness.\" Al-Balkhi traced back his ideas on mental health to verses of the Qur'an and hadiths attributed to Muhammad, such as:\n\nAbu Zayd al-Balkhi was the first to differentiate between neurosis and psychosis, and the first to classify neurotic disorders and pioneer cognitive therapy in order to treat each of these classified disorders. He classified neurosis into four emotional disorders: fear and anxiety, anger and aggression, sadness and depression, and obsession. He further classified three types of depression: normal depression or sadness (\"huzn\"), endogenous depression originating from within the body, and reactive clinical depression originating from outside the body. He also wrote that a healthy individual should always keep healthy thoughts and feelings in his mind in the case of unexpected emotional outbursts in the same way drugs and First Aid medicine are kept nearby for unexpected physical emergencies. He stated that a balance between the mind and body is required for good health and that an imbalance between the two can cause sickness. Al-Balkhi also introduced the concept of reciprocal inhibition (\"al-ilaj bi al-did\"), which was re-introduced over a thousand years later by Joseph Wolpe in 1969.\n\nThe Muslim physician Abu Zayd al-Balkhi was a pioneer of psychotherapy, psychophysiology and psychosomatic medicine. He recognized that the body and the soul can be healthy or sick, or \"balanced or imbalanced\", and that mental illness can have both psychological and/or physiological causes. He wrote that imbalance of the body can result in fever, headaches and other physical illnesses, while imbalance of the soul can result in anger, anxiety, sadness and other mental symptoms. He recognized two types of depression: one caused by known reasons such as loss or failure, which can be treated psychologically through both external methods (such as persuasive talking, preaching and advising) and internal methods (such as the \"development of inner thoughts and cognitions which help the person get rid of his depressive condition\"); and the other caused by unknown reasons such as a \"sudden affliction of sorrow and distress, which persists all the time, preventing the afflicted person from any physical activity or from showing any happiness or enjoying any of the pleasures\" which may be caused by physiological reasons (such as impurity of the blood) and can be treated through physical medicine. He also wrote comparisons between physical disorders with mental disorders, and showed how psychosomatic disorders can be caused by certain interactions between them.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1792713", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1792713", "title": "Centrosaurus", "text": "Centrosaurus\n\nCentrosaurus ( ) is a genus of herbivorous ceratopsian dinosaurs from the Late Cretaceous of Canada. Their remains have been found in the Dinosaur Park Formation, dating from 76.5 to 75.5 million years ago.\n\nThe massive bodies of \"Centrosaurus\" were borne by stocky limbs, although at up to they were not particularly large dinosaurs. Like other centrosaurines, \"Centrosaurus\" bore single large horns over their noses. These horns curved forwards or backwards depending on the specimen. Skull ornamentation was reduced as animals aged. The frill was relatively short compared to the total skull length, and could grow to over half a meter (68.8 cm) long in the oldest and largest adults.\n\n\"Centrosaurus\" is distinguished by having two large hornlets which hook forwards over the frill. A pair of small upwards directed horns is also found over the eyes. The frills of \"Centrosaurus\" were moderately long, with fairly large fenestrae and small hornlets along the outer edges.\n\nThe first \"Centrosaurus\" remains were discovered and named by paleontologist Lawrence Lambe in strata along the Red Deer River in Alberta, Canada. The name \"Centrosaurus\" means \"pointed lizard\" (from Greek \"kentron\", κέντρον, \"point or prickle\" and \"sauros\", σαῦρος, \"lizard\"), and refers to the series of small hornlets placed along the margin of their frills, not to the nasal horns (which were unknown when the dinosaur was named). The genus is not to be confused with the stegosaur \"Kentrosaurus\", the name of which is derived from the same Greek word.\n\nLater, vast bonebeds of \"Centrosaurus\" were found in Dinosaur Provincial Park, also in Alberta. Some of these beds extend for hundreds of meters and contain thousands of individuals of all ages and all levels of completion.\nScientists have speculated that the high density and number of individuals would be explained if they had perished while trying to cross a flooded river. A discovery of thousands of \"Centrosaurus\" fossils near the town of Hilda, Alberta, is believed to be the largest bed of dinosaur bones ever discovered. The area is now known as the Hilda mega-bonebed.\nBecause of the variation between species and even individual specimens of centrosaurines, there has been much debate over which genera and species are valid, particularly whether \"Centrosaurus\" and/or \"Monoclonius\" are valid genera, undiagnosable, or possibly members of the opposite sex. In 1996, Peter Dodson found enough variation between \"Centrosaurus\", \"Styracosaurus\", and \"Monoclonius\" to warrant separate genera, and that \"Styracosaurus\" resembled \"Centrosaurus\" more closely than either resembled \"Monoclonius\".\nDodson believed one species of \"Monoclonius\", \"M. nasicornus\", may actually have been a female \"Styracosaurus\". His assessments have been partially followed, with other researchers not accepting \"Monoclonius nasicornus\" as a female \"Styracosaurus\", or \"Monoclonius\" as a valid genus. While sexual dimorphism has been proposed for a more basal ceratopsian, \"Protoceratops\", there is no firm evidence for sexual dimorphism in any ceratopsid. Others have synonymized \"C. nasicornus\" with \"C. apertus\", or considered it a separate \"Centrosaurus\" species: \"Centrosaurus nasicornus\". It has also been suggested as the direct ancestor of \"Styracosaurus albertensis\". A 2014 study of changes during growth in \"Centrosaurus\" concluded that \"C. nasicornus\" is a junior synonym of \"C. apertus\", representing a middle growth stage.\n\nThe species \"C. brinkmani\", which was described in 2005, was moved to the new genus \"Coronosaurus\" in 2012.\n\nThe genus \"Centrosaurus\" gives its name to the Centrosaurinae subfamily. Its closest relatives appear to be \"Styracosaurus\" and \"Monoclonius\". It so closely resembles the latter of these that some paleontologists have considered them to represent the same animal. Other members of the Centrosaurinae clade include \"Pachyrhinosaurus\", \"Avaceratops\", \"Einiosaurus\", \"Albertaceratops\", and \"Achelousaurus\".\n\nThe cladogram presented below represents a phylogenetic analysis by Chiba \"et al.\" (2017):\n\nLike other ceratopsids, the jaws of \"Centrosaurus\" were adapted to shear through tough plant material. The discovery of gigantic bone beds of \"Centrosaurus\" in Canada suggest that they were gregarious animals and could have traveled in large herds. A bone bed composed of \"Centrosaurus\" and \"Styracosaurus\" remains is known from the Dinosaur Park Formation in what is now Alberta. The mass deaths may have been caused by otherwise non-herding animals gathering around a waterhole during a drought. \"Centrosaurus\" is found lower in the formation than \"Styracosaurus\", indicating that \"Centrosaurus\" was displaced by \"Styracosaurus\" as the environment changed over time.\n\nThe large frills and nasal horns of the ceratopsians are among the most distinctive facial adornments of all dinosaurs. Their function has been the subject of debate since the first horned dinosaurs were discovered. Common theories concerning the function of ceratopsian frills and horns include defense from predators, combat within the species, and visual display. A 2009 study of \"Triceratops\" and \"Centrosaurus\" skull lesions found that bone injuries on the skulls were more likely caused by intraspecific combat (horn-to-horn combat) rather than predatory attacks. The frills of \"Centrosaurus\" were too thin to be used for defense against predators, although the thicker, solid frills of \"Triceratops\" might have evolved to protect their necks. The frills of \"Centrosaurus\" were most likely used \"for species recognition and/or other forms of visual display\".\n\nThomas M. Lehman has observed that \"Centrosaurus\" fossils haven't been found outside of southern Alberta even though they are among the most abundant Judithian dinosaurs in the region. Large herbivores like the ceratopsians living in North America during the Late Cretaceous had \"remarkably small geographic ranges\" despite their large body size and high mobility. This restricted distribution strongly contrasts with modern mammalian faunas whose large herbivores' ranges \"typical[ly] ... span much of a continent.\"\n\n\n"}

BaghaPurana's police station has the largest jurisdiction in Punjab as a chain of over 65 \"pinds\" or villages are within its control. The town is divided into 3 'pattis' or sections: Muglu Patti (biggest one), Bagha Patti, and Purana Patti. The town has its fair share of rich people and thus the standard of living is above average as compared to the surrounding towns and villages.\n\n India census, \nBagha Purana Municipal Council has population of 25,206 of which 13,288 are males while 11,918 are females.\n\nPopulation of Children with age of 0-6 is 2764 which is 10.97% of total population of Bagha Purana.

This small village located on the intersection of Moga-Kotkapura road and Mudki-Nihal Singh Wala road got prominence after a Government Polytechnic was established, a few kilometers away. Thereafter it became a trade center of the villages around it and developed into a small town. The village got a status of town when a Nagar Panchayat (smallest form of urban local self-government unit) was formed in 1974 which was upgraded to a Municipal Council, a few years ago. In 2000, it got the status of a sub-division headquarters which facilitated the establishment of all tehsil-level offices of the Government.\n\nEarlier, the majority of the population thrived on agriculture, as such most of the other economic activity is driven by agriculture like agro based industry (rice-mills, cold stores etc.), commission agents etc. The tertiary activities include the transport and related businesses like finance etc. Many banks have opened their branches due to enhanced economic activity over the years, as well as the needs of the non-resident Indian community from this region, especially in Canada & Australia.\n\nThe town also boasts of being the home-town of some of the great personalities. To name a few, Major Malkit SIngh Brar, who was awarded the Mahavir Chakra (posthumously) in 1948 was born in Alam Wala (a small and first village near Bagha Purana) and He got educated here. He laid down his life fighting for the country in Poonch sector during the Indo-Pak war in 1948 and was the first in erstwhile Punjab (comprising present Punjab, Haryana, H.P and Delhi) and second in the country to be honored with Mahavir Chakra (the highest decoration award of the country).

The descendants of Bajirao I and Mastani expressed their disapproval of this film, claiming excessive creative liberty by Bhansali causing wrongful portrayal of their ancestors. A petition was filed in Bombay High Court seeking a stay on the film, but the High Court refused to interfere with its release. It received tremendous critical acclaim across the world and was listed among the best films of 2015 by several sources. Despite the controversy, the film emerged as one of the highest-grossing Indian films of all time. The film received many accolades at various award ceremonies in India.

On 6 March 2017, members of Shri Rajput Karni Sena vandalised the Chittor Fort again and broke the mirrors installed in the palace of Rani Padmini. On 15 March 2017, a group of unidentified vandals again attacked and set fire to the sets of this movie in Kolhapur which led to the production set, costumes and jewelleries being burnt. The film earned 30 million dollars in the first four days after its release.\n\n\n"}

It is a 44,000-acre (178 km²) reservoir with over 750 miles (1,200 km) of wooded shoreline. Lake Martin is a reservoir, formed by the construction of Martin Dam on the Tallapoosa River. The Martin Dam powerhouse is used to generate hydroelectric power for the Alabama Power Company. Construction on Martin Dam began in 1923 and was completed in 1926, creating what was at that time the largest man-made body of water in the world. Originally known as Cherokee Bluffs for the geological formation upon which it was built, the dam was renamed in 1936 in honor of Thomas Martin, the then-president of Alabama Power Company. Alabama Power and Russell Lands own the majority of the shoreline.\n\nOne of the largest man made lakes in the United States, Lake Martin is a popular recreation area for swimming, boating, water skiing, camping, and golfing. The Dixie Sailing Club operates on Lake Martin. Many waterfront neighborhoods and luxury homes are located on Lake Martin. The cities of Alexander City, Dadeville, Jacksons Gap, and Eclectic are nearby.\n\nLake Martin hosts many events throughout the year, including fishing tournaments, an Independence Day fireworks show, and the Alexander City Jazz Festival, an annual event every June in downtown Alexander City and at the Lake Martin Amphitheater. In 2009-11, the lake hosted AquaPalooza.\n\nLake Martin includes many popular attractions, including eagles nests, sand beaches, restaurants, camping areas and popular islands. The lake has several landmarks, such as the Smith Mountain Fire Tower, Kowaliga Bridge, and several marinas, but perhaps the most recognized landmark on the lake is Chimney Rock, a large rock formation that resembles a chimney. Though Chimney Rock is located several hundred yards away, the formation which most people call Chimney Rock is Acapulco Rock. The area was the Tallapoosa River gorge before Martin Dam was built, and the water is more than deep. The spot is visited by thousands of boaters yearly, who park in front of \"The Rock\" to watch people climb up and jump off into the water. In July 2006, a teenager died after his jump from the rock.\n\nLake Martin has become a weekend getaway for many families from around the South. Many exclusive multimillion-dollar residences are located on the lake; among the best-known is that of Richard M. Scrushy, the founder and former chairman and CEO of HealthSouth Corporation located in the Willow Point area of Parker Creek. Built in 1998, together with a guest/boathouse, the residence contains over . HealthSouth bought the home in late 2009 for $7.4 million as part of a $2.8 billion civil judgement against Scrushy for his fraudulent practices at HealthSouth from 1997 until 2003. Many other CEO's from Montgomery, Birmingham and Atlanta have homes on the lake.\n\nAlabama has a lake of a similar name, the Logan Martin Lake on the Coosa River, but Lake Martin and Logan Martin Lake are not part of the same river system.\n\nSmall islands are popular spots on Lake Martin:\n\nOn April 27, 2011, an EF4 tornado ripped across Lake Martin. Several valuable houses and businesses were completely destroyed along its path. Some vehicles were carried over 100 yards. The tornado resulted in seven deaths across the region. Its path through Elmore, Tallapoosa, and Chambers counties was long.\n\n\n\n"}

They were political strategists who received national media exposure from the infamous Chappaquiddick incident. It was in this incident that political strategist Mary Jo Kopechne died in a car crash where Edward (Ted) Kennedy was the driver.\n\nEach \"girl\" was assigned a regional desk, divided by regions of the country, and was responsible for daily communication in and out of the Washington campaign headquarters to each state director in their region. At the end of the day, a decision book was compiled and sent to Kennedy and his campaign manager, Stephen Smith. Each decision book was composed by the boiler room team. The team of women also kept track of Kennedy's delegate count against Democratic primary contenders Eugene McCarthy and Hubert Humphrey.\n\nJust before the 1968 Democratic National Convention, the boiler room team was moved to a temporary office adjoining the convention floor where the same delegate officers met with the same state leaders. Following the assassination of United States Senator Robert F. Kennedy on June 5, 1968, the team was responsible for finishing the campaign coordination work assigned at the beginning. They eventually dispersed to work in other offices on Capitol Hill or elsewhere in Washington. The Boiler Room Girls were variously described as \"frighteningly intelligent, politically astute, capable as all get-out\" as well as \"uniformly bright, efficient, fascinated by politics\".\n\nAfter graduating in the 1962 class of Caldwell College for Women, Mary Jo moved to Alabama where she taught at Montgomery Catholic School. She joined the staff of Senator George A. Smathers of Florida in 1963 as a secretary. One year later she became a speech writer for Joseph Dolan, one of Robert Kennedy's political advisors. After Robert Kennedy's assassination, she joined Matt Reese Associates. She became a member of Senator Edward Kennedy's office. After Chappaquiddick, reports of the incident captioned Mary as “Copachni” by the New Bedford Standard-Times, and “Palporki” by the FBI, and even “TED SAFE; BLONDE DIES” by another wire service.\n\nMary Ellen Lyons was a graduate of Regis College in Weston, Massachusetts. Her sister, Nance Lyons, worked on Robert Kennedy's campaign staff as well. She worked for State Senator Beryl Cohen of Massachusetts.\n\nIn January 1967, Nance began \"working in case\", assisting with constituents, federal agencies, etc. for Robert Kennedy's office. One of her most notable projects was the legislation for Massachusetts, and getting the appropriations for the National Seashore or for the Lexington Concord National Park. After Nixon was elected as the 37th president, she left the government. She received a call from the Senator's office about working for Senator Edward Kennedy. She responded by agreeing to come back under the condition that she receive a legislative assistant job, as she was already doing the work. Legislative assistants wrote the legislation on national issues, as well as the committee work and hearings. In the office, all male legislative assistants had secretaries, who aided them in their work. Nance had to write everything, type it, and mimeograph it by herself. During her time in the government she worked on the economic conversion bill and national transportation trust fund.\n\nIn 1968, Esther joined Robert Kennedy's Presidential campaign where she served as an aide. After, she was known to work at the Urban Institute in Washington. She is now working as a literary agent at International Creative Management.\n\nSusan Tannenbaum was from the office of Representative Allard K. Lowenstein, Nassau County Democrat.\nRosemary Keough was an alumna from Manhattanville College and graduated from Boston University Law School. She was a former administrative assistant to Senator Robert F. Kennedy who also worked for the Children's Foundation in Washington. During the Chappaquiddick incident, Keough's purse was in the backseat of the sunken car. She married Paul Redmond, one of the attorney’s that Kennedy hired to look after the Boiler Room Girls after the incident and up through the inquest.\n\nOn July 18, 1969 the Boiler Room Girls attended a gathering at Chappaquiddick Island with Edward M. Kennedy. He was accompanied by three lawyers, Joseph F. Gargan, Paul Markham, and Charles Tretter, as well as John B. Crimsons, Mr. Kennedy's driver, and family friend, Raymond S. La Rosa. That night, Edward Kennedy and Mary Jo Kopechne went for a drive where they crashed over a bridge into Poucha Pond on Chappaquiddick Island.\n\nIn 2017, John Curran directed a movie portrayal of Chappaquiddick, written by Taylor Allen and Andrew Logan.

The BNMC was founded in 2001 by a consortium (including the University at Buffalo School of Medicine and Roswell Park Cancer Institute). This project comprises one of the five \"Strategic Investment Areas\" that make up Buffalo, NY's Queen City Hub Plan, the city's strategic plan for urban redevelopment.\n\nThe Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus, Inc. (BNMC, Inc.) is the umbrella organization created in 2001 by the institutions within the Medical Campus in Buffalo, New York. Since then, the campus has grown to over seven institutions, including the Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo General Hospital and the University at Buffalo School of Medicine. The not-for-profit organization was created to foster conversation and collaboration among member institutions, their employees, and the community. It also coordinates activities related to sustainable planning, development and enhancement of the 120-acre space which includes working to create a distinct, innovative environment that provides opportunities for entrepreneurship and active and healthy living.\n\nThe Medical Campus encompasses 6.5 million square feet of existing clinical, research, and support space today. There is more than two million square feet under construction totaling an investment of more than $750 million in private and public funding. Some 12,000 people work on the Medical Campus today, and that number is expected to rise to nearly 17,000 by 2017. On an annual basis, more than 1.5 million patients and visitors go through BNMC's doors.\n\nIn January 2016, The Buffalo News reported the Buffalo-Niagara region's unemployment in December 2015 was only 4.9 percent, the lowest level in nine years according to the New York State Department of Labor. The low unemployment was attributed to large building projects such as SolarCity and the Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus which fueled a hiring boom for construction workers with job growth running at an average pace of 1.6 percent which is more than double the rate of hiring during 2014 and nearly three times stronger than the employment gains during both 2012 and 2013.\n\nAs of the beginning of February 2016, minority and women-owned businesses have been awarded more than $55 million in contracts for work on the UB Medical School building under construction on the Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus.\n\nIt is estimated that by 2017, combined with the initiatives of Roswell Park Cancer Institute and UB 2020, employment on the Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus could exceed 17,000, close to that of the Bethlehem Steel plant in Lackawanna, NY before its closure.\n\nWith the completion of John R. Oishei Children's Hospital and the Jacobs School of Medicine, the next building planned for the campus is 33 High Street, an 11-story, 300,000 square foot building by Ciminelli Real Estate.\n\nA pedestrian bridge linking the Conventus office building with the Jacobs School of Medicine is scheduled to open in 2018. This bridge will provide the Medical Campus with coatless access to the Allen/Medical Campus station of the Buffalo Metro Rail.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1792743", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1792743", "title": "Kaante", "text": "Kaante\n\nKaante () is a 2002 Indian Hindi-language action-thriller film directed by Sanjay Gupta, written by Milap Zaveri, and starring an ensemble cast including Amitabh Bachchan, Sanjay Dutt, Sunil Shetty, Lucky Ali, Mahesh Manjrekar, Kumar Gaurav, Namrata Singh Gujral, Rati Agnihotri and Malaika Arora. Set in Los Angeles, the film follows six Indian men who are detained without evidence by the police. Feeling wronged and vengeful, they team up to plot a bank heist that would leave the Los Angeles Police Department penniless. However, once things go out of hand, they start suspecting each other's identities, resulting in violence and chaos.\n\n\"Kaante\" was heavily inspired by Quentin Tarantino's \"Reservoir Dogs\" (1992) as well as the film that inspired it, Ringo Lam's \"City on Fire\" (1987). According to Tarantino, \"Kaante\" is his favorite among the many films that were heavily inspired by his work.\n\n\"Kaante\" was released theatrically on 20 December 2002. The film was a success at the box office, with first-week earnings of £1.8million in India, nearly $1million in the United States, and £268,507 in Britain. The film's final worldwide gross was 430million ($9million), including 331.2million in India and $2.05 million overseas.\n\nIn Los Angeles, six criminals, all of Indian origin, are detained by the Police, and interrogated about stealing a truck full of laptops and it's whereabouts. Their deep antipathy towards the police for arresting them without any evidence, just because the witnesses had seen an Indian at the crime scene, grows into a daring plot. Sparked off by \"Ajju\" (Sanjay Dutt) and seconded by \"Major\" (Amitabh Bachchan), they all hatch a plan to rob the bank in which lies the funding for the Los Angeles Police Department. In return, Ajju reveals that he stole the truck and splits the steal with everyone else.\n\nMarc (Suniel Shetty) is a bouncer who hates that his girlfriend has to work as a club-dancer and wants to rescue her from the club owner Cyrus (Gulshan Grover), by paying him the required money. He also has an ongoing spat with Ajju about his girlfriend. Major has a sick wife who he has to look after by supplying her with medicines and injections. Andy (Kumar Gaurav) is a software engineer having divorce and custody troubles, as his wife won't let him meet their child. Bali (Mahesh Manjrekar) and Mak (Lucky Ali) are two drug-peddlers who live off the street selling and buying illicit drugs under a drug lord. They meet when Bali is being chased by some drug dealers and meets Mak in an alley where he is adjusting something in his car. He agrees to save him only if he splits his loot. They agree to work on this method from that time on.\n\nAll six meet on a hotel roof-top where they construct their plan and arrange for arms, ammunition, vehicles, and gadgets. They do some reconnaissance around the bank and two days before the robbery, Major surprises everyone by declaring that the robbery will take place the next day.\n\nWhile the robbery happens as planned, they find a SWAT team waiting for them outside the bank. They are engaged in gunfight and Mak is hit by a bullet while saving Major. They all escape and meet at their hideout. They realise that someone might have informed the police, which could reach their hideout as well. Mak, who was hit, is not allowed to be taken to the hospital, and Major treats his wound with some Whiskey. They all have verbal scuffles after which, Ajju, reveals that he has kidnapped the Police Chief. They interrogate him and learn that one of them is an undercover cop. This strikes terror among them and they decide to bring the stolen amount to their hideout. Major finds out that his wife has died. Ajju befriends Marc and tells him to elope with his girlfriend. When they return, they find Bali dead, killed by Mak for being inhuman in his interrogation of the Police Chief. Ajju reasons that Mak is the undercover cop, but Major disagrees because he believes Mak saved him during the gunfight at the bank. They all arrive at a Mexican stand-off, with Andy as the viewer. He retreats and runs away with the money. They all shoot at each other, after which Major apologizes to Mak for not saving him. In reply, Mak apologizes saying he was just doing his duty as he is the Police-member. Major realises his mistake and shoots the already dying Mak in the head. Marc's girlfriend is shown waiting for him at the airport and Andy is shown at the end driving off the highway pursued by a Police helicopter, leaving the end to the discretion of audience followed by ending credits.\n\n\nThe film was to star Sanjay Dutt, Sunil Shetty, Mahesh Manjrekar, Kumar Gaurav, Akshaye Khanna, Shilpa Shetty and Lisa Ray initially. Akshaye Khanna opted out of the project subsequently and was replaced by Lucky Ali, while Malaika Arora stepped in Lisa Ray's shoes and Namrata Singh Gujral was cast opposite Kumar Gaurav in lieu of Shilpa Shetty. The character of Renu Mathur (played by Namrata Singh Gujral) was the only role cast in Hollywood from the entire principal cast. All other principals including Amitabh Bachchan were flown in from Mumbai for the Hollywood shoot. Sunny Deol was also offered Kumar Gaurav's role at one point.\n\nThe film was the first Bollywood film to be completely shot in Los Angeles. The film's production team used Hollywood technicians. The filming was completed in 31 days. Rohit Roy (from \"Shootout at Lokhandwala\" and a popular television actor) makes an appearance in the song \"Ishq Samandar\".\n\n\"Kaante\" holds an 83% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, a website that rates films based on published reviews by critics, averaging a score of 6.4 out of 10 from 6 reviews. Taran Adarsh of \"Bollywood Hungama\" gave the film three and a half stars out of five and stated, \"\"Kaante\" takes a step forward in terms of content and technique. An apt example of progressive cinema that breaks the shackles of stereotype, the film has everything to woo the cinegoer: an impressive cast, grandiose look, an excellent second half, well executed stunts, popular music and eroticism in plenty\". Prem Panicker of \"Rediff\" criticized the film saying \"A more taut script, a little less of indulgence in directing, a tad more ruthlessness in editing, and this film could have pulled off a badly needed box office heist.\" A reviewer at \"Sify\" awarded the film three and a half stars out of five and wrote, \"A film far ahead of its time in terms of execution, \"Kaante\" is a visual delight. And combined with good performances and superb action, it's a must-see this season.\"\n\nDerek Elley of \"Variety\" praised the direction and performances of the lead cast saying, \"From the protags’ initial meeting, heavy on closeups, Gupta directs the film primarily as a character piece, with Bachchan, Dutt and semi-comic relief Manjrekar driving the drama with richly characterized roles. Shetty, a tightly wound actor at the best of times, strikes few sparks as the nightclub bouncer, and his scenes with Arora as the chanteuse are flat.\" Dave Kehr of \"The New York Times\" reviewed the film writing, \"A delirious Bollywood reimagining of \"Reservoir Dogs,\" complete with musical numbers, Sanjay Gupta's \"Kaante\" shifts as fluidly between cinematic idioms as it does between Hindi and English.\" Kevin Thomas of the \"Los Angeles Times\" said, \"there is a steadfast earnestness in director Sanjay Gupta's deluded attempt to equal or even better Hollywood on its own ground that is rather touching -- but not to the degree that it sustains the film's many tedious stretches.\"\n\nQuentin Tarantino cited \"Kaante\" as his favourite among the many films that were heavily inspired by his work. He praised the film's character-building for going beyond what he was able to do with \"Reservoir Dogs\". Tarantino stated: \"Here I am, watching a film that I've directed and then it goes into each character's background. And I'm like, 'Whoa'. For, I always write backgrounds and stuff and it always gets chopped off during the edit. And so I was amazed on seeing this. I felt, this isn't \"Reservoir Dogs\". But then it goes into the warehouse scene and I am like, 'Wow, it's back to Reservoir Dogs'. Isn't it amazing!\" He also praised Amitabh Bachchan's performance. Tarantino later screened \"Kaante\" at his New Beverly Cinema alongside \"Reservoir Dogs\" and \"City on Fire\".\n\nA. R. Rahman was initially roped in to compose music for the film. But Rahman opted out of the film, due to reasons unknown after which, the \"Kaante\" became a multi-composer soundtrack featuring music composed by Anand Raj Anand, Vishal-Shekhar and Lucky Ali. Lyrics are penned by Dev Kohli and Vishal Dadlani. According to the Indian trade website Box Office India, with around 18,00,000 units sold, this film's soundtrack addalbum was the year's fourth highest-selling. Tracks like 'Maahi ve' and 'Rama re' are still popular.\n\nThe song \"Ishq Samundar\", was re-made for the Film Teraa Surroor which was sung by Himesh Reshammiya and Kanika Kapoor.\n\n"}

The film is about the loss of American jobs to low-wage foreign competition, covering the phenomenon of outsourcing in manufacturing and high-paying white-collar jobs. The filmmaker visited 19 cities and towns throughout the United States interviewing recently laid-off workers, focusing on three industries: textiles, commercial aircraft and information technology. It also contains interviews with a number of members of Congress, including: Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), Rosa DeLauro (D-Connecticut), Robin Hayes (R-North Carolina), Donald Manzullo (R-Illinois), and Hilda Solis (D-California), and includes an extended section of clips from the 1993 congressional debate on NAFTA.

She was the first ship named for Commander Frank Ragan King.\n\n\"King\" was laid down 28 April 1919 and launched 14 October 1920 by the New York Shipbuilding Corporation; sponsored by Mrs. Allene A. King, widow of Commander King; and commissioned 16 December 1920, Lieutenant Commander R. C. Smith in command.\n\nAfter shakedown and training operations along the Atlantic Coast, \"King\" cleared Hampton Roads 2 October 1921 for her first Mediterranean cruise. Arriving Smyrna, Turkey, 8 November, the destroyer received 300 Greek refugees for transport to Mitylene, Greece. The destroyer served as station ship during the Greco-Turkish War, remaining in Turkish waters until June 1923.\n\nUpon return to the United States during the summer, \"King\" joined the Atlantic Scouting Fleet and from 1923 to 1930 engaged in fleet exercises and reserve training cruises along the coast and in the Caribbean. She sailed for the Pacific 15 April 1925 for maneuvers in Hawaiian waters. During the spring of 1927, she patrolled waters off Nicaragua to protect American citizens and interests during the civil war in that country. \"King\" decommissioned at Philadelphia 10 March 1931.\n\nShe recommissioned 13 June 1932 and departed Hampton Roads 18 August to join the Pacific Scouting Force. \"King\" operated out of California for the next 6 years, engaging in central Pacific exercises, reserve cruises and training maneuvers to strengthen America's powerful sea force. The destroyer decommissioned at San Diego, California 21 September 1938.\n\nSoon after Nazi aggression began the Second World War in Europe, \"King\" recommissioned 26 September 1939, Lieutenant Commander E. E. Berthold in command. The destroyer cleared San Diego 13 November to join the Caribbean Neutrality Patrol. Following arrival at Norfolk, Virginia 22 February 1940, the destroyer operated along the East Coast on Neutrality Patrol out of Boston, Massachusetts and Key West, before returning to the West Coast during the fall. She continued patrol and maneuvers out of San Francisco, California, operating in that area at the outbreak of hostilities with Japan.\n\nDuring the first 5 months of the war, \"King\" operated on patrol and escort duty along the West Coast. Departing Mare Island 22 May 1942, she joined Task Force 8 escorting troop transport \"President Fillmore\" to the Aleutian Islands.

{"id": "1792760", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1792760", "title": "Bringin' On the Heartbreak", "text": "Bringin' On the Heartbreak\n\n\"Bringin' On the Heartbreak\" is a ballad originally recorded by British hard rock band Def Leppard. It was the second single from their 1981 album \"High 'n' Dry\". The song was written by three of the band's members: Steve Clark, Pete Willis, and Joe Elliott.\n\nDef Leppard recorded the song for their second album, \"High 'n' Dry\". Its working title had been \"A Certain Heartache\", and the track (along with the others on the album) was produced by Robert John \"Mutt\" Lange. Lange said he thought the band was intending to make the song's verse \"jangley\" and \"a kind of 'Stairway to Heaven' thing; Steve [Clark] likes that long wrangled guitar jangle.\" Cliff Burnstein, the manager of Def Leppard and an A&R representative for Mercury Records, later said that Peter Willis was embarrassed to play the song for him because it was a ballad. Burnstein originally thought it only had potential to be a hit single if it was recorded by an artist such as Bonnie Tyler.\n\nAt the beginning of the song, after the guitar harmony part, a faint voice is audible. It says \"Out of tune ones eh? Pete's ones...\". This is studio chatter talking about the fact that to achieve the guitar tone in the verses, guitarists Pete Willis and Steve Clark de-tuned their guitars from each other. According to the audio clip, Willis was the one to de-tune his guitar.\n\n\"High 'n' Dry\" was released in the U.S. in summer 1981. \"Bringin' On the Heartbreak\" was commercially released in the U.S. on 13 November, with \"Me and My Wine\" (a non-album track) and \"You Got Me Runnin'\" included as B-sides. It did not appear on the U.S. charts, but its music video was picked up by the recently launched television channel MTV and received heavy rotation. The popularity of the video and the exposure the band received caused a resurgence in sales of \"High 'n' Dry\", which subsequently sold over two million copies. It was released in Mexico as \"Llevarlo en la Desilusión\" with \"Yo y mi Vino\" (\"Me and My Wine\"), featuring the cover art from the single \"Too Late for Love\".\n\n\"High 'n' Dry\" was re-issued in May 1984 with two new tracks, one of which was a synthesizer-heavy remix of \"Bringin' On the Heartbreak\". Featuring Phil Collen on guitar, the remix was released as a single with a newly filmed video and peaked at 61 on the U.S. \"Billboard\" Hot 100. The original version of the song was later included on three of their compilation albums: \"\" (1995) \"Best of Def Leppard\" (2004) and \"\" (2005). The latter compilation ends with the instrumental \"Switch 625\", as it does in \"High 'n' Dry\". Steve Huey of Allmusic has characterised the song as an \"unabashedly dramatic rock ballad.\"\n\nThe first music video was directed by Doug Smith, and is a live recording of Def Leppard performing the song at the Royal Court Theatre in Liverpool, England on 22 July 1981. It was originally filmed (along with clips for \"Let It Go\" and \"High 'n' Dry\") as part of Don Kirshner's \"Rock Concert\" television series on the U.S. network ABC. The second music video, directed by David Mallet, was shot in February 1984 in Jacob's Biscuit Factory in Lake, Dublin, Ireland. The original version of the second video featuring the remix is only available on the VHS and LaserDisc versions of the band's video compilation release \"Historia\". DVD reissues of \"Historia\", and the band's subsequent video compilations \"Best of the Videos\" and \"Rock of Ages - The DVD Collection\" replace the remix soundtrack with the original \"High 'n' Dry\" LP recording.\n\n\nIn 2002, the song was covered by American singer and songwriter Mariah Carey for her album \"Charmbracelet\" (2002). The reaction from Def Leppard's Joe Elliott was positive.\n\nMariah Carey co-produced her cover of the song with Randy Jackson. Carey cited the original song as one of her favorites when she was growing up, and she said that she first came up with the idea of covering it when listening to Def Leppard's album \"Vault\" during the album photo shoot for \"Charmbracelet\"—\"I just put on the music and started listening to it, and I said, 'You know what? I could do this my own way',\" she said. The song was produced in a rock ballad style and features guitar-playing by Rob Bacon. The single version also featured a newly recorded solo and extra guitar overdubs performed by Dave Navarro. One of Carey's few songs with a heavy rock influence, it was released as the album's third single in 2003.\n\nThe cover was met with positive reviews from a variety of critics. \"Rolling Stone\" described the song as \"the catchiest cut [on \"Charmbracelet\"]...a fascinatingly overblown orchestral remake.\" Phil Collen praised Carey's cover as a \"genuine version of our song\" and defended it from Def Leppard's more critical fans: \"The fans really get it wrong sometimes. She's on our side and it's an honour she's done it. Really, that's the only way we're getting played.\" Carey's version was number 24 on VH1's \"Least Metal Moments\"—in a segment subtitled \"Bringin' On the Headache\"—because many metal fans and musicians did not like the remake. At the same time, Mark Edward Nero of About.com ranked it at number 2 on his list of \"Top 5 R&B/Pop Crossover Cover Songs\" and said Carey's version is \"superior to the original.\"\nAsked about Carey's cover version, Joe Elliott told the Las Vegas Sun, \"I think she's done a very good job. It's faithful to the arrangement, but not done like a rock song.\" Referring to Carey's whistle register vocals at the end, Elliott commented that her \"astonishing vocal gymnastics toward the end...make Minnie Riperton sound like Tom Waits.\" \"Billboard\" was favorable by naming it \"set's crowning glory.\" \"The New York Times\" also reviewed this song favorably: \"Another high point is her version of the Def Leppard song \"Bringin' On the Heartbreak.\" It starts out as a piano-driven slow jam; then the chorus is interrupted by a dramatic chord progression, and soon Ms. Carey's precise, fluttery voice is turning a power ballad into something more delicate.\" Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine called this cover \"daring\" and praised its \"surprising amount of live instrumentation, which contributes to an overall sense of warmth that's been otherwise missing from Carey's recent work.\" Rich Juzwiak of Stylus called Mariah's version of the song \"epic.\" In the exception of AllMusic, who gave mixed reviews, stated that its best song on album but also noting that it \"isn't even covered all that well.\"\n\nSimilar to the commercial performance of \"Boy (I Need You)\", the album's second single, \"Bringin' On the Heartbreak\" failed to enter the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100, or the Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart because it was only an airplay single. It reached the top 40 in Switzerland but peaked outside the top 40 in Austria. Junior Vasquez, Mike Rizzo and Ruanne produced club remixes of the song, which received a wider release on promotional singles than commercial singles and received spins in nightclubs worldwide—the song reached the top five on the US \"Billboard\" Hot Dance Club Play.\n\nThe song's video, set to the RJ Jammen remix, was shot in Los Angeles on 8 March 2003 by director Sanaa Hamri, and features cameo appearances by Randy Jackson, Dave Navarro, Evan Marriott (as a helicopter pilot/bodyguard) and model Damon Willis. The single's video is based on the 1979 film \"The Rose\", which featured a rock star (played by Bette Midler) who struggles to find happiness as she goes from her rough \"rock and roll\" lifestyle to her final high-profile concert.\n\nOn 7 December 2002, Carey performed the song along with \"Through the Rain\" and \"My All\" in front of a crowd of 50,000 people, at the closing concert of the Mexican \"Teletón\", which took place in the country's Azteca Stadium. Announced as the concert's \"star\", she performed in a black dress. While with \"Through the Rain\" and \"My All\" she did not attract the audience, the performance of \"Bringin' On the Heartbreak\" was seen as the highlight of her act.\n\n"}

A Democrat, Landrieu served as Lieutenant Governor of Louisiana from 2004 to 2010.\n\nHe is the son of former New Orleans mayor and Secretary of the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development Moon Landrieu and the brother of former U.S. Senator Mary Landrieu. In 2007, he won a second term as lieutenant governor in the October 20, 2007 nonpartisan blanket primary by defeating two Republicans: State Representative Gary J. Beard and singer Sammy Kershaw.\n\nHe was elected Mayor of New Orleans on February 6, 2010, garnering 66 percent of the citywide vote and claiming victory in 365 of the city's 366 voting precincts. He was reelected mayor on February 1, 2014, with nearly 64 percent of the vote in a three-candidate field and became the first Mayor to win both elections without a runoff and to be elected by majorities of both white and African-American voters.\n\nLandrieu was born and raised in the Broadmoor neighborhood of New Orleans, the fifth of nine children of Maurice \"Moon\" and Verna Satterlee Landrieu. He stated in a March 2018 journalism podcast that he is of Italian, French, German, British, and African-American heritage. After graduating from Jesuit High School in 1978, he enrolled at The Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C. where he earned a B.A. in political science and theatre in 1982. In 1985, he earned a Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree from Loyola University Law School in New Orleans.\n\nLandrieu is married to Cheryl P. Landrieu, also an attorney. The couple has five children.\n\nPrior to public service, Landrieu practiced law for 16 years and became a mediator, focusing on alternative dispute resolution. He owned International Mediation and Arbitration, where he mediated over 700 cases involving complex cases. He was also appointed special master for a major train derailment involving up to 9,000 plaintiffs. He clerked for Federal Court Judge Adrian Duplantier and Chief Justice of the Louisiana Supreme Court Pascal Calogero. He is a member of the Supreme Court Task Force on Alternative Dispute Resolution which was responsible for developing the pilot mediation program in Orleans Parish. Landrieu is trained in mediation and negotiation by the Harvard Law School Negotiation Project, the American Arbitration Association, and the Attorney Mediator's Institute. Landrieu has also taught alternative dispute resolution as an adjunct professor at Loyola University Law School.\n\nLandrieu was elected to the Louisiana House of Representatives in 1987, where he served for sixteen years in the seat previously held by his sister and before her, his father.\n\nAs a leader of the “Young Turks,” Landrieu advocated a non-partisan approach to governing and pushed for fiscal reform in the early 1990s, when the state was in a precarious financial situation. Working with a diverse bipartisan group of lawmakers, he helped focus attention away from partisan fights and toward efficiency and accountability. Landrieu led this coalition, often against Democratic Governor Edwin Edwards, to restructure government instead of cutting healthcare programs and raising fees. He shepherded through the House a constitutional amendment designed to limit Louisiana's debt. Later, in partnership with Republican Governor Mike Foster in 1999, Landrieu led an effort to have the state's $4.4 billion tobacco settlement placed into a trust, allowing the Legislature to only allocate the interest earned every year. He also focused on stimulating economic growth by supporting the construction of major economic development projects in New Orleans – including the Morial Convention Center, the New Orleans Arena, the National World War II Museum and the biomedical district.\n\nLandrieu led the legislative effort to reform Louisiana's juvenile justice system with a focus on rehabilitation and reform as opposed to punishment and incarceration. As lieutenant governor, he continued to chair the Juvenile Justice Commission, the entity created by the legislation to implement the reforms. In January 2004, Governor Kathleen Blanco endorsed the Commission's recommendations.\n\nLandrieu also led the effort by a coalition of artists, venue owners, and other interested parties who were successful in repealing the Orleans Parish \"amusement tax\", a 2% tax on gross sales at any establishment that features live music. As an attorney, Landrieu brought a case to court that resulted in the tax being ruled unconstitutional. He continued the fight by bringing the issue to the New Orleans City Council, who voted to repeal the tax. As a legislator, Landrieu sponsored a bill to repeal the law that allowed the tax to exist.\n\nHe also chaired a commission that worked to consolidate New Orleans elected offices, which became a reality after Hurricane Katrina. Landrieu also vocally opposed former Ku Klux Klan wizard and then Representative David Duke, fighting Duke's divisive and often-racist legislation.\n\nLandrieu crafted legislation to fund the Louisiana Cancer Research Consortium of New Orleans, a partnership between the Louisiana State University and Tulane University Health Sciences Centers. Louisiana has the nation's highest cancer mortality rate, according to the American Cancer Society.\n\nOne of Landrieu's most ambitious projects as Lieutenant Governor of Louisiana has been the creation of the World Cultural Economic Forum (WCEF). The Forum, held annually in New Orleans, is directed towards promoting cultural economic development opportunities through the strategic convening of cultural ambassadors and leaders from around the world. The first WCEF took place in October 2008. He has carried on this project as mayor and has even established a formal cultural economy office at City Hall.\n\nIn 1994 Landrieu made an unsuccessful bid for the office of Mayor of New Orleans; the office went to Marc Morial, the son of another former mayor.\n\nMitch Landrieu's 2003 campaign for Lieutenant Governor was his first bid for statewide office in Louisiana. After 16 years in the State House, Landrieu was elected Lieutenant Governor in 2003. In a field of six candidates, Landrieu garnered 53 percent of the vote and won outright in the Louisiana open primary, thus avoiding a general election. His principal opponents were three Republicans, former U.S. Representative Clyde C. Holloway of Rapides Parish, former Lieutenant Governor Melinda Schwegmann of New Orleans, and businessman Kirt Bennett of Baton Rouge.\n\nWhen Hurricanes Katrina and Rita hit New Orleans and the Gulf Coast in 2005, the Lieutenant Governor was involved in the emergency response. After commanding portions of the hurricane response and recovery, Landrieu was tasked to lead the effort to rebuild the state's tourism industry.\n\nAround this time, he decided to challenge incumbent Mayor C. Ray Nagin. With voting sites scattered across the country and most residents having not yet returned home, he narrowly lost to Nagin.\n\nImmediately after the storm, Landrieu brought together industry leaders and national experts to develop a strategic plan, \"Louisiana Rebirth\", to rebuild the state's tourism industry. It was in this period of recovery that Landrieu began to clearly articulate a governing philosophy that would guide him over the next part of his career. He believed you needed to bring people together to get things done. In order to do so, there needed to be clear command, control and communication. Also, the federal, state and local governments needed to be aligned better—both vertically and horizontally. This means coordinating behind the scenes, breaking down silos and building partnerships to meet the state's biggest priorities.  He believed that government in many instances should steer, not row—that it is a facilitator, with the ability to link public, private, not-for-profit, and faith organizations, and help each of them leverage their collective assets.\n\nIn this vein, he launched the “Cultural Economy” initiative out of whole cloth to quantify and grow jobs in Louisiana's culture, music, food, film and art industries. He also created the first in the nation Office of Social Entrepreneurship to advance social innovation by supporting the creation and growth of the most innovative, measurable and sustainable solutions to the social problems affecting Louisiana's citizens. These were new and innovative ways to address old problems.\n\nAs Lieutenant Governor, Landrieu also chaired the Juvenile Justice Commission to reform to the state's juvenile justice system. Under his leadership, the Commission overhauled the probation and parole systems for youth offenders, established violence prevention programs, and studied the connection between domestic abuse and juvenile delinquency.\n\nIn February 2006, Landrieu officially announced he would run for mayor of New Orleans in the April 22 election. Before Hurricane Katrina the incumbent Ray Nagin was widely expected to be reelected with little difficulty, but post-disaster problems and controversies had left many New Orleanians interested in new leadership.\n\nIn the election of April 22, preliminary results showed Landrieu with the second most votes, with 29% of the vote to Nagin's 38%. Nagin and Landrieu faced each other in a run off election on May 20. With unofficial results showing 53% of the vote for Nagin, Landrieu conceded defeat.\n\nAlthough Landrieu had at first indicated he did not plan on it, he ultimately decided to pass on an open race for Governor or an easy re-election as Lieutenant Governor to instead run for the job he always wanted—New Orleans mayor. He announced in December 2009 that he would be running in the 2010 New Orleans mayoral election, in a bid to succeed Ray Nagin, who was term-limited. Landrieu won with some 67% of the vote, with wide support across racial and demographic lines. His outright victory over 10 challengers in the first round of voting eliminated the need for a runoff election. Landrieu is the first white person to hold the post since his father left office in 1978.\n\nLandrieu was sworn in on May 3, 2010, after winning 66 percent of the vote in the primary, winning a majority across African American and white votes.\n\nWhen Landrieu was sworn in, the recovery from Hurricane Katrina had stalled, the city teetered on bankruptcy and the New Orleans Police Department was under federal investigation. He created a diverse and citizen-led transition committee, made up of six different task forces that engaged thousands in public meetings. He hired the consulting firm Public Strategies Group (PSG) to assess the city government operations and, according to PSG's final report, issued in March 2011, \"to identify opportunities for transformational change that would increase the organization's effectiveness, efficiency, adaptability, and capacity to innovate.\" PSG senior partner David Osborne observed that Landrieu had \"inherited the least competent city government [he'd] ever seen in this country and the most corrupt\".\n\nLandrieu promoted recovery by fast-tracking over 100 projects and securing billions in federal funding from FEMA and HUD for schools, hospitals, parks, playgrounds and critical infrastructure particularly roads and drainage. Landrieu brought sound fiscal management, balanced budgets, and ethical contracting to City Hall, leading to the City's highest-ever credit rating and over $8 billion in private development. His top priority was public safety—reforming the police department and reducing the city's murder rate.\n\nLandrieu immediately established clearer command and control, instituting a Deputy Mayor system and a new organizational chart for the nearly 4,000 employees and $1 billion total budget. In 2010, facing a nearly $100 million deficit, he closed the City's budget gap—more than one-fifth of the total general fund—by cutting out waste, reorganizing departments and the delivery of core services, reducing boards and commissions, thereby eliminating the city's longtime structural deficit. For eight straight years, he delivered a balanced budget. As a result, New Orleans’ credit ratings were upgraded four times during Mayor Landrieu's tenure to its highest all-time rating. Landrieu reformed the city procurement system. He created the Office of Performance and Accountability to publicly track how well City government is keeping its promises and launched an expansive open data system making more information available to the public and press. His administration developed NOLA 311 for constituents to report quality-of-life concerns and requests. It also launched a \"One Stop Shop\" permit processing system to reduce permit times and make the city more business friendly.\n\nTo ensure the city is building for the future, he launched the world's first resilience strategy, \"Resilient New Orleans.\"\n\nAs a result of the public investment and new confidence in the city, the city's economy has thrived, adding more than 20,000 new jobs since 2010. Landrieu recruited GE Capital's Technology Center to the city, adding 400 high-paying jobs. And spending from tourism has now surpassed pre-Katrina highs. Since Landrieu took office, the \"Wall Street Journal’s MarketWatch\" named New Orleans one of the “most improved cities for business.” In 2012, Landrieu unveiled a 5-year-plan called Prosperity NOLA which aims to diversify the economy and add major jobs in digital technology, biosciences, and water management. New retail was booming, in many areas surpassing pre-Katrina levels. The city is now a hub of entrepreneurship activity, outpacing the national per capita average by 56 percent, with $8 billion in private development in the city since May 2010. As a result of growth and confidence in the market, property values are up 50 percent. Under Landrieu, the City began construction on a new, nearly $1 billion terminal at the Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport. The terminal added major international flights to improve global business opportunities for the region.\n\nMaking public safety a high priority, Landrieu introduced a comprehensive murder-reduction strategy, \"NOLA for Life,\" which launched in 2012. The multifaceted plan comprised 29 different programs, from a Multi-Agency Gang Unit, made up of local and federal law enforcement that focused on the city's most dangerous gangs and groups, to mentoring programs for youth and support services for offenders on probation. Landrieu shepherded major new investments in recreation and public health. Following the inception of Nola for Life, the city saw a reduction of its murder rate through 2014; in 2015 it rose again by 9% over the previous year but still remained one of the lowest rates the city had experienced in 25 years.\n\nLandrieu has also championed reforming the New Orleans Police Department in partnership with the Department of Justice—overhauling use of force policies, leading the nation in body camera use, and improving law enforcement relationships with the community. In recent years and under the Mayor's leadership, the city's criminal court system has implemented pretrial services, electronic monitoring and alternatives to detention that focus on risk. NOPD also began issuing summonses in lieu of arrests for minor offenses to reduce pressure on the jail population and to ensure a smarter focus on arresting violent criminals. These efforts have significantly reduced the local jail population, which now is just one third of what it was pre-Katrina.\n\nLandrieu's re-election bid received the endorsement of \"The Times-Picayune.\"\n\nShortly after taking office during his second mayoral term, Landrieu announced the appointment of Ronal W. Serpas as the new Superintendent of the New Orleans Police Department until the latter's resignation in August 2014.\n\nLandrieu prioritized equal economic opportunity. From his work on NOLA FOR LIFE and black male achievement, he launched the Network for Economic Opportunity, a comprehensive strategy to connect disadvantaged job seekers and businesses to new training and job opportunities. He launched a multi-year initiative on racial reconciliation called The Welcome Table, and the City unveiled a racial equity plan tying the various initiatives together and institutionalizing the strategies in City Hall's day-to-day operations. \nIn 2015, Landrieu called for the removal from prominent public display of 4 monuments, 3 honoring Confederate leaders and one honoring a short-lived, violent coup of the state government by the Crescent City White League. The New Orleans City Council approved their removal the same year. After various legal challenges to removal were struck down, on April 24, 2017, the long-contentious Battle of Liberty Place Monument was the first to be removed. He was criticized by opponents of its removal for his lack of transparency. The statues of Confederate Generals Robert E. Lee and P. G. T. Beauregard as well as Confederate President Jefferson Davis were removed in May 2017. As the Confederate monuments came down on his orders, Landrieu made an address explaining the decision, which quickly went viral, and received praise in national media outlets.\n\nLandrieu was one of the participants in filmmaker Spike Lee's documentaries \"\" and \"If God Is Willing and Da Creek Don't Rise\".\n\nIn 2009 Mitch Landrieu became a supporter of The Jazz Foundation of America. He flew to NYC to present Agnes Varis with the coveted \"Saint of the Century\" Award at the Jazz Foundation of America's annual benefit concert \"A Great Night in Harlem\" at the Apollo Theater in support of Varis' and the Jazz Foundation's work to help save jazz musicians, especially those affected by Hurricane Katrina.\n\nIn 2015, Landrieu was named Public Official of the Year by \"Governing\". In 2017-2018, Landrieu served as president of the U.S. Conference of Mayors, the official nonpartisan organization of cities with a population of 30,000 or larger. At his inauguration, Landrieu joined with colleagues in unveiling a bipartisan policy agenda that, at a time of partisan gridlock in Washington, D.C., emphasized local leadership on issues such as repair of infrastructure, ensuring affordable healthcare, and fostering economic growth and opportunity.\n\nIn coordination with and support from bipartisan mayors across the country, Mayor Landrieu sought to reinvigorate the organization, develop and execute a much more aggressive and strategic media operation, and better deploy its existing assets and those of its coalition partners around a new “Agenda for the Future,” which focusing on security and opportunity. Landrieu has also been highly engaged in major international coalitions of cities such as 100 Resilient Cities, the Global Covenant of Mayors on Climate Change & Energy and C40.\n\nIn 2018, the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation awarded Landrieu its prestigious Profile in Courage Award for his leadership in removing four Confederate monuments in New Orleans, highlighting in the award announcement his candid reflections on the moment and its place in history. He is the author of the \"New York Times\" bestseller \"In the Shadow of Statues: A White Southerner Confronts History\".\n\nIn a 2016 \"Politico\" survey of Mayors across America, his peers praised him as the leader “who engineered the biggest turnaround.” \"Politico\" wrote, “Mitch Landrieu is enjoying what is widely hailed as one of the most successful mayorships in America, leading efforts on public health, infrastructure and a personal crusade against gun violence.” He was listed as #18 on the 2017 \"Politico\" 50 list.\n\n\nThreshold > 50%\n\nFirst ballot, October 24, 1987\n\n\nThreshold > 50%\n\nFirst ballot, October 19, 1991\n\n\nThreshold > 50%\n\nFirst ballot, February 5, 1994\n\n\nThreshold > 50%\n\nFirst ballot, October 21, 1995\n\n\nThreshold > 50%\n\nFirst ballot, October 23, 1999\n\n\nThreshold > 50%\n\nFirst ballot, October 4, 2003\n\n\nThreshold > 50%\n\nFirst ballot, April 22, 2006\n\nSecond Ballot, May 20, 2006\n\n\nThreshold > 50%\n\nFirst ballot, October 20, 2007\n\n\nThreshold > 50%\n\nFirst ballot, February 6, 2010\n\n\nThreshold >50%\n\nFirst ballot, February 1, 2014\n\n\n\n"}

He is known for his unorthodox interpretation of the Bible and his theatrical, accusatory style of preaching. He will often argue vehemently with other, more moderate Christians, who often accuse him of misrepresenting the Christian faith and driving people away from it with his extremism.\n\nBirdsong, known to his audience as the New Quad Preacher (at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte), Pit Preacher (at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill), the Brickyard Preacher (at North Carolina State University), the Sanford Mall Preacher (at Appalachian State University), and the Joyner Steps Preacher (at East Carolina University) has a large repertoire of subjects on which he preaches, ranging from the standards of heaven and hell, to drug use, premarital sex, homosexuality, Islam, atheism, feminism, communism, masturbation, rock and rap music, abortion, evolution, tolerance, politics, war, fashion, witchcraft, racism, and demonic possession.\n\nBirdsong uses a theatrical, accusatory style of preaching because he believes \"getting people angry is his most effective method of preaching.\" He often offends students with his fundamentalist views, such as his belief that \"white folks are different, black folks are different and when you start mixing them up there's a lot of confusion,\" and his opinion on feminism is that \"it ain't in the Bible.\" His views frequently result in heated debates with students, though he says it is not until \"folks get attitudes that I get attitude.\"\n\nWhen asked by a student interviewer his opinion on UNC being a liberal university, he responded, \"This University is the most stupidest place I have ever been.\" He called the administration \"wicked people,\" and said, \"they've perverted the First Amendment — the state was told not to interfere with the First Amendment, the freedom to practice religion. Well, just look at what religion they're talking about! It's Christianity — look at the founding fathers!\" His nickname for the university is \"Homo Hill,\" his view on homosexuality being that it is \"an abomination to God.\"\n\nOn March 8, 2007, Birdsong was removed from The Pit by Campus Police following an incident. According to reports, members of the UNC outdoor recreation program Carolina Adventures had reserved half of The Pit to promote their programs. Shortly after they set up their materials, Birdsong entered The Pit near their table and began to preach. They asked him to move away from their table, and Birdsong moved to the other side of The Pit. The representatives for Carolina Adventures did not feel this was sufficient and subsequently summoned UNC Police to remove Birdsong from the area. After refusing to move further away, he was removed to loud jeers directed at the police from the crowd that had gathered to watch him preach. A similar incident occurred in the 1980s resulting in his arrest.\n\nBirdsong was issued a trespass warning that prohibited him from entering The Pit for two years. Following the incident, he returned to preach, initially in front of Davis Library, about 100 feet from The Pit, and later about 200 feet away, in front of Wilson Library on Polk Place, which he referred to as \"the Homo Zone.\" During this dislocation, he was sometimes referred to as the \"adjacent to the Pit preacher\". In March 2009, Gary's two year banishment from The Pit expired and he once again returned to preach in The Pit. Some students were glad to see him return to this popular spot after his extended absence, but the overall reaction was mixed. Some disagree with his beliefs but feel he has a right to be there. Others just find him entertaining.\n\nBirdsong professes to be an ex-Hells Angel, citing that fact multiple times when he is preaching of forgiveness. He claims that his \"calling\" came to him in the middle of 40 Hells Angels in Durham County in North Carolina.\n\n\n"}

Located in the south of the province, it has about 157,000 inhabitants () and is an important commercial and agricultural hub.\n\nThe Río Cuarto River flows through the province of Córdoba; its central location in the Humid Pampas favored the city's development as a transport hub for much of the surrounding agriculture, and a number of slaughterhouses and food processing plants opened in Río Cuarto during the twentieth century.\n\nRío Cuarto was founded on November 11, 1786, as \"Villa de la Concepción del Río Cuarto\", by the colonial Governor Rafael de Sobremonte. Its first rail connection was by way of the former Andean Railway in 1870, after which the village grew rapidly with the influx of Italian and Spanish immigrants (mainly as tenant farmers). The municipal government charter establishing the modern system of elected mayors and city council was enacted in 1883; the city's first elected mayor was Moysés Irusta. \n\nFather Antonio Cardarelli commissioned the construction of the city's principal Roman Catholic church, the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception, built between 1883 and 1886.\nThe National University of Río Cuarto, established in 1971, is located here. The city's football teams include Estudiantes and Atenas. Río Cuarto hosted the International Biology Olympiad in 2006.\n\nThe city is served by National Routes 8, 36, and 158; as well as Las Higueras Airport, inaugurated in 1954. The cable-stayed Bicentennial Bridge, was inaugurated in 2010. Some of the city's principal tourist draws include the Río Cuarto Racetrack, which hosts Turismo Carretera touring car racing events; and Estancia El Durazno, an estate built in 1917 belonging to former Governor Ambrosio Olmos. The Río Cuarto craters, a group of geologically unusual impact craters, are located nearby. The city's UN/LOCODE is ARRCU.\n\nThe National University of Río Cuarto was created on 1 May 1971 by a decree signed by President Alejandro Lanusse in accordance with the Taquini Plan enacted the previous year to provide greater access to university education in Argentina.\n\nThe University of Río Cuarto had an enrollment of 14,000 students in 2013, and employs 2,000 teaching staff. By its nature a multidisciplinary center in its scope a wide variety of activities, the university hosts frequent conferences, congresses, seminars, and graduate courses.\n\nThrough the operation of 42 graduate and fourth-level racing term (PhD, Masters and Professional), the university provides a diversified curriculum and contributes to the scientific and technical training, vocational training, scientific research, and development of cultural life.\n\nThe climate is temperate, typical of the humid Pampas, with four marked seasons. Summers are warm with frequent thunderstorms; however, the heat is often \"cut\" by periods of southerly winds, so that the average high is a comfortable 29 °C, despite the fact that it can reach 38 °C. \n\nFall arrives slowly in March, and winter arrives in May with the first frosts. During the very dry winters, temperatures vary according to wind patterns: northwesterly, downsloping winds can bring temperatures of 25 °C (but with cool nights) even in midwinter, whereas southerly winds can leave daytime highs around 6 °C. Temperatures descend to -5 °C sometimes, and snow is uncommon, but not extremely so: in 2007, over 15 cm of snow covered the city, and temperatures plummeted to -11 °C, reaching highs of only 0 °C on one occasion. \n\nSpring brings violent thunderstorms and wide temperature swings, with heat waves followed by frost or cool periods. On some years, the normal winter drought extends into the spring, posing a threat to agriculture; however, at 846 mm, Rio Cuarto´s climate is generally favourable for crops.\n\nRio Cuarto is served by Las Higueras Airport with one commercial airline flying to it.\n\n"}

It was an opening day attraction at EPCOT Center in 1982 and it closed in 1996 to make way for Test Track, a new thrill ride through a GM testing facility.\nVisitors would board moving four to six person Omnimover vehicles, and would be taken through scenes that were populated with Audio-Animatronic figures and also projection effects. It was a whimsical look at the history and achievements in transportation, showing scenes from the invention of the wheel right up to the present day and beyond.\n\nThe grand finale of the attraction attempted to predict a real future for transportation, with CenterCore, a sparkling metropolis that seemed to be in perpetual motion, and Pepper's Ghost illusions putting guests into futuristic vehicles. At the ride's conclusion, visitors disembarked into the TransCenter, an interactive area about new products in development by GM.\n\nWorld of Motion closed in 1996. GM has continued its sponsorship in World of Motion's replacement attraction, Test Track, since its opening in 1999. Since that attraction's 2012 overhaul, GM has sponsored the attraction through its Chevrolet division.\n\nThe premise of the ride was to be a humorous look into the history of transportation, from the ancient days of foot power, through time into the future. General Motors signed a 10-year sponsorship deal for the ride, in a move to compete with Ford (which had sponsored a Disney-created attraction at the 1964 New York World's Fair). The pavilion's construction was a part of the initial construction of EPCOT Center itself. The attraction was ready for grand opening with the park on October 1, 1982, and was in EPCOT Center's \"opening cast\". The pavilion was given a specific opening ceremony with GM executives a few days later.\n\nThe ride was designed by the legendary Ward Kimball. This was the only attraction the animator ever worked on. His humor was evident in such gags as a used-chariot sale, and the world's first traffic jam.\n\nThe ride began with a modern u-turn up a portico that was situated directly in the entrance into the building. The Omnimovers would then bring riders to a simple caveman cave. However, it would head into the first means of transportation: footpower, where a caveman and cavewoman are seen blowing on their hot feet.\n\nThe second scene presented into the earliest means of over water transportation, people traveling on projected boats and a man fast asleep on a raft floating while a crocodile lunges at him. The next scene showed the first time animal power was introduced. It showed an Assyrian tableau with a person trying to control animals from camels to zebras. This scene also shown a man holding a crystal ball on a flying carpet.\n\nThe next scene showed the invention of the wheel at Babylon. A gag showed men holding a square object, a triangle object, a pentagonal object, and the award-winning circle object that won the king’s Laughter. Before exiting, riders passed a wheel factory, into a part called trade and commerce where it shows many useful ideas using wheels from different lands. There were examples such as a rickshaw and a chariot. The next scene was a used chariot dealership where everything including the Trojan Horse, was trying to be sold. Ships were introduced next as explores run into a sea serpent.\n\nThe next scenes were the \"Age of Flight\". It began with Leonardo da Vinci and his many attempts to fly and next to him was a clearly upset Mona Lisa. The following scene was a man looking over London in a hot air balloon.\n\nThe next scenes were the evolution of steam. It started out with a Mississippi Riverboat with the never ending stream of stagecoaches and such for the Western Expansion. The steam locomotive was the next evolution of steam travel, which in turn showed an authentic steam locomotive—and an authentic railroad robbery while a sheriff with a gleaming badge protects us on our way to the next scene. \n\nThe scene shifted over to one of the most photographed and most remembered scenes: the world's first traffic jam. The chaos included items such as an upset horse, a spilling ice truck, and kids screaming during the 1900s.\nGuests then traveled past the open road scenes which include a man who crashed a bicycle, a family picnic, and early 40s and 50s cars and a Suspicious policeman. And addition a picture is taken with a flying ace and a woman, the wind and the airplanes makes it hard to take a picture. And then scenes are shown with all the modern forms of cars.\n\nThe following areas were \"speed tunnels\" which paid homage to the tunnels in the Magic Kingdom\"s \"If You Had Wings\". The Omnimover traveled through these bullet-shaped tunnels while images were played on the screens. Some included crop-dusting, rafting, and traveling down a snowmobile trail.\n\nThe tunnels led to the final exhibit: CenterCore, the amazing city of the future. Just before unloading, riders were asked to \"help shape tomorrow's mobility\" with a similar effect as The Hitchhiking Ghosts from the Haunted Mansion, the riders in their Omnimovers appeared to be a simulated car of the future.\n\nRiders left their Omnimover vehicles and went to the TransCenter, which was full of exhibits and showed about transportation and the things surrounding it. It took an Innoventions-style feel to all of it. The TransCenter portion of World of Motion, designed by award-winning experience designer Bob Rogers (designer) and the design team BRC Imagination Arts, offered educational attractions which included prototype cars such as the Lean Machine in the Dreamer's Workshop and a show called The Water Engine, which pitted nine animated characters associated with various and alternate fuel-systems in a debate over which motor design should be used to power cars. There was a replica of America's only wind-tunnel on display. The ever-popular show \"The Bird and the Robot\", starring a toucan, Bird, and an assembly-line robot, Tiger, entertained people with acts (and Bird's signature bad jokes) about the importance of the GM assembly line. A computer-generated display showed GM's car 'torture' test without actually performing it. Concept 2000 showed the process of creating prototype cars for GM. The prototype concept cars at the TransCenter were once the most photographed spot in Walt Disney World. An exhibit called Aerotest educated people about air-flow on auto concepts and fuel economy. Another exhibit featured stylings of clothes with GM's advanced polyester production styles.\n\nBusiness slumped with General Motors after the second sponsorship deal ended for World of Motion in 1992, and as a result, GM started signing 1-year contracts for the ride. However, a suggested idea to gut the building and turn it into a new attraction stuck with Disney representatives and GM businessmen. It would take World of Motion, close it down, and refurbish it into a new ride that focused only on cars. Thus, World of Motion was shut down to the public while a new attraction, called Test Track, was taking its place. Scheduled to open 19 months after World of Motion's closing, this new ride would put guests in a test car against vehicle tests that were needed to deem the car safe for road travel.\nHowever, nothing went as planned, and the new ride opened significantly later than the scheduled opening date.\n\nThe closing of World of Motion forced the reopening of Horizons, another Disney attraction which focused on the future of the family. It was closed in 1999.\n\nPavilion sponsor General Motors signed a 10-year sponsorship contract in December 1977. When the second contract finished in 1992, and with a slumping economy GM agreed only to one-year contracts and wanted Disney Imagineering to work on a new attraction. GM insisted that the new ride would focus only on cars, as opposed to the general concept of transportation. The marketing department wanted to strongly promote their cars. GM was the sponsor for the whole run of the attraction.\n\nThe theme song for the ride was \"It's Fun to Be Free\", written by X Atencio (\"Yo Ho (A Pirate's Life for Me)\" from Pirates of the Caribbean and \"Grim Grinning Ghosts\" from The Haunted Mansion), and Buddy Baker, another legendary Disney composer. The song was played throughout the ride (and queue area) with music changing to reflect the different time periods as the ride progressed through the various scenes.\n\nThe song can be found on \"The Official Album of Disneyland and Walt Disney World (1991)\" and \"Official Album: The Happiest Celebration on Earth – Walt Disney World Resort Album\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1792785", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1792785", "title": "Fire Birds", "text": "Fire Birds\n\nFire Birds (originally titled Wings of the Apache and released internationally under that name) is a 1990 action film directed by David Green and produced by William Badalato, Keith Barish and Arnold Kopelson. The storyline was conceived by retired Lt. Colonels Step Tyner and John K. Swensson and retired Marine Capt. Dale Dye and developed into a screenplay written by Paul F. Edwards, Nick Thiel and uncredited David Taylor. The film stars Nicolas Cage, Tommy Lee Jones and Sean Young. Cage is cast as a helicopter pilot attempting to help dismantle a drug cartel in South America. Jones plays his pilot instructor and senior ranked military officer during his flight training, while Young portrays his love interest.\n\nProduction of the film was a co-production between the Walt Disney Studios and Nova International Films. It was commercially released under Disney's Touchstone Pictures label. The movie featured elaborate aerial stunt sequences, involving combat helicopters.\n\n\"Fire Birds\" premiered in theaters nationwide in the United States on May 25, 1990 grossing a modest $14,760,451 in domestic ticket receipts. The film was met with negative critical reviews before its initial screening in cinemas; generally due to its melancholy dialogue and striking plot similarities to the more popular 1986 action film \"Top Gun\", starring Tom Cruise and Kelly McGillis.\nA joint task force operation between the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and the U.S. Army has been formed to local governments dismantle one of the largest drug cartels operating in South America. Multiple attempts to assault the cartel's mountainous compound have been thwarted by a (fictional) Scorpion-attack helicopter piloted by a merciless mercenary pilot, Eric Stoller (Bert Rhine). After having several aircraft shot down, most notably a pair of UH–60 Black Hawks and their AH–1 Cobra escorts, the army turns to the new AH–64 Apache attack helicopter, which can match its enemies' maneuverability and firepower.\n\nPilot Jake Preston (Nicolas Cage) is subsequently enlisted in the Apache air-to-air combat training program. Earlier, Preston was the sole survivor of a previous air-attack by Stoller. Upon his arrival at the training course, he encounters his ex-girlfriend Billie Lee Guthrie (Sean Young), who broke off their relationship to pursue a separate career flying OH–58 Kiowa scout helicopters which often work alongside the Apache as target identifiers and designators. Jake's arrogance and loose improvised style quickly earn him the mixed respect and chagrin of veteran pilot and flight instructor Brad Little (Tommy Lee Jones). During the training schedule, Preston is revealed to be suffering from an eye dominance disability, which makes it difficult for him to utilize the Apache's visual input. Using an unconventional but effective training method, Little helps Preston deal with his handicap.\n\nA formation of military aircraft consisting of four Apaches and Guthrie's Kiowa, flies down to South America to provide air support for a mission in which U.S. Army, the DEA, and local anti-cartel forces plan to hunt down and arrest drug cartel leaders. However, they are soon attacked at their base camp, and one Apache is destroyed. With another Apache left to protect the DEA personnel, Preston, Little and Guthrie attempt to seek out Stoller. They soon locate his position, as well as a pair of Draken jet fighter aircraft who are also protecting the cartel. Little destroys one aircraft, but is shot down in aerial combat by Stoller. He survives, but his Apache is disabled. Stoller later targets Guthrie, but Preston reaches their coordinates and engages him in a fierce dogfight. Using the Apache's manoeuvrability near a mountainous peak, Preston manages to trick Stoller into flying past him; then attacks and destroys his helicopter. Meanwhile, Guthrie uses one of the Stinger missiles onboard Little's downed Apache to destroy the remaining enemy aircraft. With no air support, the cartel's defenses cease, and their leaders are later apprehended. As an injured Little is loaded onto a Medevac helicopter, he expresses pride in both Preston and Guthrie.\n\n\nFilming for \"Fire Birds\" was shot primarily on location in Tucson Arizona at Pima Community College as well as at Fort Hood, Texas army base, home of the Army's Apache Training Brigade (21st Cavalry Brigade (AIR COMBAT)) . Extensive aerial stunt sequences were coordinated with the National Guard of the United States, the United States Army and the United States Air Force. Between technical advisers, stuntmen, and pilots, over 100 personnel were directly involved in the production aspects of the film. AH-64 Apache, UH-60 Blackhawk, AH-1 Cobra, MD Helicopters MD 500 and OH-58 Kiowa rotorcraft, as well as Saab 35 Draken aircraft were employed during filming. Technical assistance from McDonnell Douglas service representatives was also utilized during production. The helicopter training aerial stunt sequences were designed by Richard T. Stevens who also coordinated visuals for the film, \"Top Gun\". Scenes from the movie, also features as static shots from MicroProse Gunship 2000 computer game.\n\nThe original motion picture soundtrack for \"Fire Birds\", composed and conducted by David Newman, was not officially released to the public when the movie was released, however Intrada has released a special collection of the soundtrack.\n\nAmong critics in the U.S., the film received mostly negative reviews. Rotten Tomatoes reported that 10% of 21 sampled critics gave the film a positive review, with an average score of 3 out of 10.\n\nHal Hinson, writing in \"The Washington Post\" said, \"\"Fire Birds\" is a primitive dogfight movie, with Nicolas Cage and Sean Young as its stars, that serves as a kind of extended commercial for the U.S. Army and its AH-64 Gunship helicopter\". He bluntly noted that \"it would be hard to reduce filmmaking to its basics more than \"Fire Birds\" does. It's more video game than motion picture – the first coin-operated movie.\" Roger Ebert in the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" offered a negative review; commenting: \"It was tempting to say that I might have liked this movie more if I'd never seen \"Top Gun\"; but the fact is, if \"Top Gun\" had never been made, \"Fire Birds\" would still have seemed like a completely ordinary movie.\" He continued, \"the aerial sequences in \"Top Gun\" are so superior to the confusing helicopter battles in this film, there's no contest there\". He concluded: \"I was really left unmoved by it.\" In the \"Deseret News\", critic Chris Hicks wrote that the film's \"predictability isn't the worst of \"Fire Birds' \" problems. The dialogue is so hokey you'll have a hard time not laughing out loud. Did I say dialogue? Make that pontificating soundbites.\" He further expanded on his viewpoint saying, \"the most obnoxious aspect of \"Fire Birds\", however, is how everybody tells Cage's character how wonderful he is at every opportunity — including Cage himself, who has a big scene in a chopper simulator where he screams \" \"I am the greatest!\" \" after every target he hits.\"\nVincent Canby writing in \"The New York Times\" saw the film as having \"many laughs, all of them unintentional\" while pointing out that actor Cage \"plays the sort of B-picture role that might once have suited William Gargan. Unlike Mr. Gargan, though, Mr. Cage insists on acting. Mr. Cage simply won't quit. He never listens to or sees anybody else in a scene, being too busy monitoring his own utterly mysterious, attention-getting responses.\" He did though compliment Jones and Young on their performances saying, \"Mr. Jones and Miss Young are somewhat better. He has a secure, cool manner that registers well on the screen, and she can seem to be intelligent\". The \"Variety Staff\", felt \"Fire Birds\" had a \"tongue-in-cheek aspect\" and that \"Camaraderie and rat-a-tat-tat dialog may have started out as fun a la Howard Hawks' classic \"Only Angels Have Wings\" but emerges at times as a satire of the genre.\" On Jones's performance, they noticed how he was \"dead-on as the taskmaster instructor who cornily singles out Cage for rough treatment\". Film critic Gene Siskel of the \"Chicago Tribune\" gave the film a \"thumbs down\" review gruffly saying, \"this movie had nothing to do with the drug wars at all\" and that \"they could have been having a competition for the olympics\". In reference to the drug wars, he openly wondered–why couldn't the movie have been \"written at that hard level?\" Similarly, Owen Gleiberman writing for \"Entertainment Weekly\" viewed \"Fire Birds\" as \"a third-rate knockoff of \"Top Gun\" and \"Blue Thunder\"\". Not impressed with the overall acting, he noted how Cage gave \"a dull, one-note performance.\" He did however, reserve praise for the stunts and visuals in the film saying, \"the climactic air battle is well staged, though without the edge-of-the-envelope dread that made the \"Top Gun\" dogfights genuinely thrilling.\" But in summing up his overall negativity for the movie, he expressed his dissatisfaction by lamenting, \"the film practically pats itself on the back for featuring villains that have been in the news recently. Yet, with the exception of one anonymous enemy pilot, we never even get to see the bad guys. And so it's hard to work up much enthusiasm for their destruction.\" Film critic Leonard Maltin's review was similar: \"...Standard military issue with a ruptured-duck script and a complete lack of romantic chemistry between professional rivals Cage and Young. Jones doesn't exactly evoke memories of Gregory Peck in \"Twelve O'Clock High\" when he pep-talks Cage into a 'full-tilt boogie for freedom and justice'.\"\n\n\"Fire Birds\" premiered in cinemas on May 25, 1990 in wide release throughout the U.S.. During its opening weekend, the film opened in a distant 5th place and grossed $6,358,761 in business showing at 2,006 theaters. The film \"Back to the Future Part III\" opened in first place with $23,703,060. The film's revenue dropped by 58.9% in its second week of release, earning $2,611,812. For that particular weekend, the film fell one spot to 6th place still showing in 2,006 theaters. The film \"Total Recall\", unseated \"Back to the Future Part III\" to open in first place. For its final weekend in release, the film opened in 8th place showing at 1,539 theaters grossing $1,246,590 in box office business. The film went on to top out domestically at $14,760,451 in total ticket sales through a 3-week theatrical run. For 1990 as a whole, the film would cumulatively rank at a box office performance position of 83.\n\nFollowing its cinematic release in theaters, the film was released in VHS video format on September 26, 1990. The Region 1 Code widescreen edition of the film was released on DVD in the United States on February 3, 2004. Special features for the DVD include, a closed captioned French language track, Dolby Digital Surround Sound, and a Widescreen (1.85:1) enhanced feature for 16x9 televisions. The film was released on Blu-ray by Mill Creek Entertainment on July 7, 2015.\n\n"}

{"id": "1792799", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1792799", "title": "Stakeholder theory", "text": "Stakeholder theory\n\nThe stakeholder theory is a theory of organizational management and business ethics that accounts for multiple constituencies impacted by business entities like employees, suppliers, local communities, creditors, and others. It addresses morals and values in managing an organization, such as those related to corporate social responsibility, market economy, and social contract theory. \n\nThe stakeholder view of strategy integrates a resource-based view and a market-based view, and adds a socio-political level. One common version of stakeholder theory seeks to define the specific stakeholders of a company (the normative theory of stakeholder \"identification\") and then examine the conditions under which managers treat these parties as stakeholders (the descriptive theory of stakeholder \"salience\").\n\nIn fields such as law, management, and human resources, stakeholder theory succeeded in challenging the usual analysis frameworks, by suggesting that stakeholders' needs should be put at the beginning of any action. Some authors, such as Geoffroy Murat, tried to apply stakeholder's theory to irregular warfare.\n\nConcepts similar to modern stakeholder theory can be traced back to longstanding philosophical views about the nature of civil society itself and the relations between individuals. The word \"stakeholder\" in its current use first appeared in an internal memorandum at the Stanford Research Institute in 1963. Subsequently, a \"plethora\" of stakeholder definitions and theories were developed. In 1971, Hein Kroos and Klaus Schwab published the German book \"Moderne Unternehmensführung im Maschinenbau\" (\"Modern Enterprise Management in Mechanical Engineering\") argueing that the management of a modern enterprise must serve not only shareholders but all stakeholders (die Interessenten) to achieve long-term growth and prosperity. US authors followed, for example, In 1983, Ian Mitroff published \"Stakeholders of the Organizational Mind\" in San Francisco. R. Edward Freeman had an article on Stakeholder theory in the California Management Review in early 1983, but makes no reference to Mitroff's work, attributing the development of the concept to internal discussion in the Stanford Research Institute. He followed this article with a book \"Strategic Management: A Stakeholder Approach\". This book identifies and models the groups which are stakeholders of a corporation, and both describes and recommends methods by which management can give due regard to the interests of those groups. In short, it attempts to address the \"principle of who or what really counts.\nIn the traditional view of a company, the shareholder view, only the owners or shareholders of the company are important, and the company has a binding fiduciary duty to put their needs first, to increase value for them. Stakeholder theory instead argues that there are other parties involved, including employees, customers, suppliers, financiers, communities, governmental bodies, political groups, trade associations, and trade unions. Even competitors are sometimes counted as stakeholders – their status being derived from their capacity to affect the firm and its stakeholders. The nature of what constitutes a stakeholder is highly contested (Miles, 2012), with hundreds of definitions existing in the academic literature (Miles, 2011).\n\nNumerous articles and books written on stakeholder theory generally credit Freeman as the \"father of stakeholder theory.\" Freeman's \"Strategic Management: A Stakeholder Approach\" is widely cited in the field as being the foundation of stakeholder theory, although Freeman himself credits several bodies of literature in the development of his approach, including strategic management, corporate planning, systems theory, organization theory, and corporate social responsibility. A related field of research examines the concept of stakeholders and stakeholder salience, or the importance of various stakeholder groups to a specific firm.\n\nAn anticipation of such concepts, as part of Corporate Social Responsibility, appear in a publication that appeared in 1968 by the Italian economist Giancarlo Pallavicini, creator of \"the decomposition method of the parameters\" to calculate the results are not directly economic activity of enterprise, regarding ethical issues , moral, social, cultural and environmental.\n\nMore recent scholarly works on the topic of stakeholder theory that exemplify research and theorizing in this area include Donaldson and Preston (1995), Mitchell, Agle, and Wood (1997), Friedman and Miles (2002), and Phillips (2003).\n\nDonaldson and Preston argue that the theory has multiple distinct aspects that are mutually supportive: descriptive, instrumental, and normative. The descriptive approach is used in research to describe and explain the characteristics and behaviors of firms, including how companies are managed, how the board of directors considers corporate constituencies, the way that managers think about managing, and the nature of the firm itself. The instrumental approach uses empirical data to identify the connections that exist between the management of stakeholder groups and the achievement of corporate goals (most commonly profitability and efficiency goals). The normative approach, identified as the core of the theory by Donaldson and Preston, examines the function of the corporation and identifies the \"moral or philosophical guidelines for the operation and management of the corporation.\" Since the publication of this article in 1995, it has served as a foundational reference for researchers in the field, having been cited over 1,100 times.\n\nMitchell, et al. derive a typology of stakeholders based on the attributes of power (the extent a party has means to impose its will in a relationship), legitimacy (socially accepted and expected structures or behaviors), and urgency (time sensitivity or criticality of the stakeholder's claims). By examining the combination of these attributes in a binary manner, 8 types of stakeholders are derived along with their implications for the organization. Friedman and Miles explore the implications of contentious relationships between stakeholders and organizations by introducing compatible/incompatible interests and necessary/contingent connections as additional attributes with which to examine the configuration of these relationships. Robert Allen Phillips distinguishes between normatively legitimate stakeholders (those to whom an organization holds a moral obligation) and derivatively legitimate stakeholders (those whose stakeholder status is derived from their ability to affect the organization or its normatively legitimate stakeholders).\n\nStakeholder theory succeeds in becoming famous not only in the business ethics fields. It is used as one of the frameworks in corporate social responsibility methods. For example, ISO 26000 and GRI (Global Reporting Initiative) involve stakeholder analysis.\n\nIn the field of business ethics, Weiss, J.W. (2014) illustrates how stakeholder analysis can be complemented with issues management approaches to examine societal, organizational, and individual dilemmas. Several case studies are offered to illustrated uses of these methods.\n\nStakeholder theory has seen growing uptake in higher education in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. One influential definition defines a stakeholder in the context of higher education as anyone with a legitimate interest in education who thereby acquires a right to intervene. Studies of higher education first began to recognize students as stakeholders in 1975. External stakeholders may include employers. In Europe, the rise of stakeholder regimes has arisen from the shift of higher education from a government-run bureaucracy to modern system in which the government's role involves more monitoring than direct control.\n\nThe political philosopher Charles Blattberg has criticized stakeholder theory for assuming that the interests of the various stakeholders can be, at best, compromised or balanced against each other. Blattberg argues that this is a product of its emphasis on negotiation as the chief mode of dialogue for dealing with conflicts between stakeholder interests. He recommends conversation instead and this leads him to defend what he calls a 'patriotic' conception of the corporation as an alternative to that associated with stakeholder theory.\n\nAccording to Mansell (2013), by applying the political concept of a 'social contract' to the corporation, stakeholder theory undermines the principles on which a market economy is based.\n\n\n\n"}

The Aspen Skiing Company operates the Aspen/Snowmass resort complex, comprising four ski areas: Aspen Mountain, Aspen Highlands, Buttermilk, and Snowmass.\n\nThe Company was founded in 1946 by Friedl Pfeifer, an Austrian ski instructor and racing champion, Walter Paepcke, a successful Chicago industrialist, Judge William E. Doyle, James J. Johnston, and H. F. Klock. Paepcke also founded cultural institutions in the city, such as the Aspen Institute and the Aspen Music Festival. The Aspen Skiing Company established the Aspen Mountain ski resort on Aspen Mountain above the town of Aspen, Colorado. The first chair lift, Lift-1, opened on December 14, 1946, and was the world's longest chairlift at the time. In 1950, the company hosted the FIS World Alpine Championships, the first international skiing competition in the United States. In the following decades, the company opened Buttermilk in 1958 and the Snowmass (originally the Snowmass-at-Aspen Ski Area) in 1967. In 1993 the company assumed ownership and operation of Aspen Highlands, which was founded in 1958 by Colorado Ski Hall of Famer: Whip Jones. Previously, Jones successfully sued Aspen Skiing before the Supreme Court for antitrust violations in \"Aspen Skiing Co. v. Aspen Highlands Skiing Corp.\"\n\nThe company didn't pay dividends until it was bought by Twentieth Century Fox in 1977, which is when the ticket prices began to increase. In the 1970s, ticket prices were just over 10 dollars a day; now, they are more reflective of industry averages.\n\nIn 2012, the Aspen Skiing Company built a 3-megawatt methane-to-electricity plant in Somerset, Colorado, at Oxbow Carbon's Elk Creek Mine.\n\nIn addition to managing and operating four ski areas, the company operates and owns hotels including The Little Nell and The Limelight, both in Aspen. The company also operates on-mountain and off-mountain restaurants and operates a skiing and snowboard school, The Ski and Snowboard Schools of Aspen/Snowmass. The school provides group and private lessons at all four mountains and teaches all level of student from beginner to expert. The managing director of the ski school is Jonathan Ballou who was appointed in spring 2017, succeeding Katie Ertl. The ski season typically runs from Thanksgiving Day to mid-April, depending on weather and snow conditions.\n\nThe Aspen Skiing Company is currently owned by the Crown family of Chicago. The Crowns also own significant holdings in General Dynamics and Wall Street's JP Morgan Chase. The President and CEO of the company is Mike Kaplan, who succeeded Pat O'Donnell.\n\nThe Aspen Skiing Company supported in the Water Rights Protection Act. The bill would prevent federal agencies from requiring certain entities to relinquish their water rights to the United States in order to use public lands. In 2012, a court ruled \"in favor of the ski companies... that seizing the privately held water rights usurped state water law.\" However, the United States Forest Service decided to pursue a \"new regulation to demand that water rights be transferred to the federal government as a condition for obtaining permits needed to operate 121 ski resorts that cross over federal lands.\" The Colorado ski industry supported the Water Rights Protection Act because it believed the legislation was \"needed to block a water extortion scheme by the Forest Service to withhold government permits unless the companies relinquish their valuable water rights.\" Vice President of the Aspen Skiing Company David Corbin testified to the House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Water and Power that the company would go out of business without the water.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1792801", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1792801", "title": "Jayant Patel", "text": "Jayant Patel\n\nJayant Mukundray Patel (born 10 April 1950 ) is an Indian-born American surgeon who was accused of gross negligence whilst working at Bundaberg Base Hospital in Queensland, Australia. Deaths of some of Patel's patients led to widespread publicity in 2005. In June 2010, he was convicted of three counts of manslaughter and one case of grievous bodily harm, and sentenced to seven years' imprisonment. In August 2012, all convictions were quashed by the full bench of the High Court of Australia and a retrial was ordered due to \"highly emotive and prejudicial evidence that was irrelevant to the case\" laid before the jury. A retrial for one of the manslaughter counts resulted in acquittal and led to a plea deal where Patel pleaded guilty to fraud and the remaining charges were dropped. On 15 May 2015, he was barred from practising medicine in Australia.\n\nJayant Patel was born in Jamnagar in the Indian state of Gujarat. Initially, he studied surgery at the M. P. Shah Medical College at the Saurashtra University, obtaining a master's degree. He then moved to the United States where he received further surgical training at the University of Rochester School of Medicine as a surgical intern and a resident in surgery.\n\nIn 1984 in Buffalo, New York, health officials cited Patel for failing to examine patients before surgery. He was fined US$5,000 and was placed on three years' clinical probation. In April 2001, New York State health officials withdrew Patel's license.\n\nIn 1989, Patel moved to the Kaiser Permanente Hospital in Portland, Oregon. In 1995, the hospital named him a \"Distinguished Physician of the Year.\" By this time, Patel had been involved in a string of problem cases, eight of which had prompted or would later lead to malpractice or wrongful death lawsuits. Medical staff allege he performed surgery when not rostered to work, operated on other surgeons' patients, operated unnecessarily and caused serious injury and death. In 1998, Kaiser Permanente restricted Patel's practice; he was instructed not to operate on the liver or pancreas and to seek second opinions before performing other surgeries. In September 2000, after reviewing four cases involving the deaths of three patients, the Oregon Board of Medical Examiners made Patel's restriction statewide. Even though his medical license had been restricted, Patel still received glowing letters of recommendation from his colleagues at Kaiser Permanente.\n\nIn 2003, Patel moved to the position of Director of Surgery at the Bundaberg Base Hospital, where he was employed by Queensland Health under an \"area of need\" program where overseas trained doctors are employed in predominantly regional understaffed areas. He was appointed despite having no specialist surgical qualifications.\n\nInadequacies in Patel's practice were identified. His surgery was described as \"antiquated\" and \"sloppy\". Nurses claimed they hid their patients from him when they knew he was in the hospital. He showed poor regard for hygiene. He attracted the nickname \"Dr. Death\". It is alleged he altered medical records, including death certificates to hide his inadequacies. Patel is linked to at least 87 deaths among the 1,202 patients he treated between 2003 and early 2005. Thirty patients died while under his care in Bundaberg.\n\nOn 22 March 2005, Stuart Copeland, the Queensland Shadow Minister for Health, raised the issue of Patel's clinical practice during question time in Queensland Parliament. Copeland had been alerted to Patel's inadequacies by Toni Hoffman, a nurse at the Bundaberg Base Hospital. Two days later, Rob Messenger, the National Party MP for Burnett, also raised the matter in a speech to the Legislative Assembly and called for Patel's suspension. After Hedley Thomas, a journalist at the Brisbane \"Courier-Mail\", published reports about Patel, the newspaper and other media outlets were flooded with claims of patients' injury or death caused by Patel's operations.\n\nOn 2 April 2005, Patel departed Australia for Portland using a business-class airfare paid for by Queensland Health. His passport had not been withheld.\n\nOn 22 November 2006, a magistrate issued a warrant for Patel's arrest and extradition to Australia. He was charged with three charges of manslaughter, five charges of causing grievous bodily harm, four of negligent acts causing harm and eight charges of fraud. He was extradited to Australia on 21 July 2008.\n\nIn response to public discontent over Patel's performance at Bundaberg Base Hospital, the Beattie Government convened the \"Bundaberg Hospital Commission of Inquiry\". The Inquiry held similar judicial powers to a Royal Commission, and commenced hearings in Brisbane on 23 May 2005. It was led by Anthony Morris, a Queen's Counsel.\n\nOn 10 June, Morris released an interim report that was tabled on the same day in State Parliament by Premier Beattie. The report recommended, among other things, that Patel be charged with murder or manslaughter in respect to one patient, with causing \"a negligent act causing harm\" to another patient, that he also be charged with fraud in relation to his registration at the Medical Board of Queensland to practice medicine and that extradition proceedings should begin. It also recommended changes to the \"Medical Practitioners Registration Act 2001\".\n\nThe Morris Inquiry began hearings in Bundaberg on 20 June. Nurses, local Queensland Health administrators and former patients of Patel were all expected to give evidence. Public hearings in Bundaberg concluded on 14 July. The Inquiry resumed public hearings in Brisbane on 25 July and also sat in Townsville from 2 to 4 August.\n\nDuring the course of the Morris Inquiry, two senior Queensland Health bureaucrats in the Bundaberg region, Darren Keating and Peter Leck, filed an application in the Supreme Court of Queensland calling for the inquiry to be shut down, alleging that Morris had shown apprehended bias against them. On 1 September, Justice Martin Moynihan of the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the applicants, finding that the Commission of Inquiry was contaminated with ostensible bias against Keating and Leck, and that evidence gathered from other witnesses was entangled with the evidence given by Keating and Leck.\n\nThe new inquiry began on 8 September 2005 and was headed by former Supreme Court of Queensland judge Justice Geoffrey Davies QC. This inquiry, formally titled the \"Queensland Public Hospitals Commission of Inquiry\", was widely known as the Davies Inquiry.\n\nThe report of the Davies Inquiry was handed down on 30 November 2005. It recommended that charges of manslaughter and other criminal offenses be prosecuted against Patel. The report also apportioned much of the blame to two former Health Ministers, Gordon Nuttall and Wendy Edmond, as well as senior Queensland Health bureaucrats for allowing the existence of an organizational culture of secrecy and ostracizing of whistleblowers that allowed Patel's misdeeds to go unpunished for two years.\n\nAn independent surgeon, Peter Woodruff, who was asked by Justice Davies to examine Patel's work believes that Patel negligently caused 13 deaths, and serious complications suffered by at least 31 others.\n\nThe Forster Inquiry, also known as the Queensland Health Systems Review, was commissioned by the Queensland Government on 16 April 2005 as a non-judicial inquiry specifically due to the political and public sentiments following the practices of Dr Jayant Patel at Bundaberg Hospital with a broader focus on the practices, systems and processes of Queensland Health. Its report was issued in September 2005.\n\nPatel was arrested 11 March 2008 by FBI agents. He appeared in court that day with a court-appointed attorney, telling Federal Magistrate Dennis Hubel that he was unable to afford a lawyer, after incurring significant pre-trial legal fees. In response, the Magistrate ordered Patel, who lives in a $900,000 house, to fill out a financial affidavit before an upcoming detention hearing. Following his arrest, Toni Hoffman, the nurse who took her complaints about Patel to a member of the Parliament of Australia, said that \"I am relieved he's been arrested, but there's still a lot to go.\" Patel denied the allegations. The extradition proceeding against Patel began April 2008. Patel was denied bail by Judge Hebel on 28 June 2008, with the judge warning Australian and US authorities that they must extradite Patel by 21 July 2008, or he would release Patel on bail.\n\nPatel was extradited: U.S. Marshals handed Patel over to two officers from the Queensland Police Service at Los Angeles International Airport on 19 July, who then escorted him on board Qantas flight QF 176. The flight arrived at Brisbane Airport on the morning of 21 July. Patel was taken immediately to the Brisbane watch-house and was granted bail by the Roma Street Magistrates Court the same day.\n\nPatel was tried in the Queensland Supreme Court for the unlawful killing of three patients, and grievous bodily harm to a fourth. He pleaded not guilty to all charges.\n\nOn 29 June 2010, Jayant Patel was found guilty of all four charges. On 1 July, he was sentenced to seven years' jail for his offences. Patel appealed his conviction and sentence to the Court of Appeal, and the prosecution also appealed sentence. Both appeals were dismissed.\n\nPatel then appealed the Court of Appeal's decision to the High Court of Australia, and was granted special leave to appeal. On 24 August 2012, the High Court unanimously allowed the appeal and quashed Patel's convictions on the ground that prejudicial evidence had likely influenced the jury. Patel argued that by the time prosecutors admitted 43 days into the trial that they could not prove Patel was guilty of incompetence, the jury had already heard testimony and evidence about his unusual behavior. The High Court granted Patel a new trial.\n\nThe following year, a retrial was held for one of the manslaughter charges, and Patel was acquitted by the jury. This resulted in calls to have the remaining charges against Patel dropped. The remaining manslaughter and grievous bodily harm charges were later dropped in exchange for Patel pleading guilty to two counts related to him dishonestly gaining registration and two counts related to dishonestly gaining employment in Queensland. Patel was sentenced to a two-year suspended sentence for those fraud charges.\n\nIn a television documentary on the case aired by CNN in November 2010 as part of its \"World's Untold Stories\" series and entitled \"They Called Him 'Dr. Death'\", several of Patel's medical co-workers in Australia testified to having repeatedly blown a whistle on him only to be ignored by medical superiors and other authorities. Questions were also raised about the lack of due diligence by those involved in his appointment.\n\nIn response to the case, Peter Beattie fired the Director General, Robert Stable and changes were made to funding, the operations of the medical board, and to how concerns raised by whistle blowers are handled.\n\nOn 15 May 2015, the Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal banned Patel from ever practising medicine in Australia again. The tribunal upheld the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency's contentions that Patel deceived authorities into granting him a medical licence, concealed matters related to his fitness to be a doctor, and performed surgeries that he knew he could not competently perform.\n\n\n"}

She was the founding editor of \"Cleo\", a high-circulation magazine aimed at women aged 20 to 40 that was frank about sexuality (and, in its infancy, featured nude male centrefolds) and, later, as the editor of the more conventional \"Australian Women's Weekly\". She was the youngest person to be appointed editor of the \"Weekly\", which was then, per capita, the largest-selling magazine in the world.\n\nButtrose was a panelist on the Network Ten morning program \"Studio 10\" from 2013 until 2018.\n\nIn 2019 Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced Buttrose as the new chairman of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC).\n\nButtrose was born at Potts Point, Sydney, and named after her maternal grandmother, Ita Clare Rodgers (née Rosenthal), pronounced (rhyming with 'fighter'). She was raised as a Catholic by her parents. Buttrose's father, Charles Oswald Buttrose, was a journalist and at one time the editor of \"The Daily Mirror\" in Sydney. By her own account she had decided on a career in journalism at the age of 11. Buttrose spent her first five years in New York City when her father was the New York correspondent for \"The Daily Mirror\". She has Jewish ancestry on her maternal side.\n\nThe family returned to Australia in 1949 and settled in the harbourside suburb of Vaucluse. Her parents divorced during her teens, after 25 years of marriage, and details of her father's private life were printed in the tabloid press, causing considerable anguish to her mother. Buttrose briefly attended a private school but because her father could not afford the fees she was then moved to a public school. She completed her secondary education at Dover Heights Home Science High School, leaving at 15 to begin her career. She started her career at Australian Consolidated Press, owned by the Packer family, working as a copy girl at \"The Australian Women's Weekly\", then became a cadet journalist on \"The Daily Telegraph\" and \"The Sunday Telegraph\" in Sydney. Her first byline came in 1959 when the 17-year-old covered the Australian tour by Princess Alexandra.\n\nAt 21 years of age, Buttrose married architect Alasdair \"Mac\" Macdonald and had two children. She was appointed women's editor of the \"Telegraph\" at just 23 years old. In 1966 she won a racetrack fashion contest run by a rival newspaper, for which the first prize was an overseas trip, including a visit to Expo 67 in Montreal. Buttrose and her husband then stopped in England in 1967 where she worked for a time on the British national magazine \"Woman's Own\" before giving birth to her first child, a daughter, Kate. It was after her daughter's birth that she received a telegram from Sir Frank Packer, head of Australian Consolidated Press, offering her back her former job as women's editor at the \"Telegraph\". The family then returned to Australia.\n\nIn 1971 Buttrose was chosen as founding editor of a new Australian women's magazine. This was originally to have been an Australian edition of the renowned American magazine \"Cosmopolitan\", but the deal fell through after Hearst Magazines sold the \"Cosmopolitan\" rights to longtime Packer rivals Fairfax, so Packer and Buttrose set about creating a new publication, dubbed \"Cleo\", which they launched in 1972, several months ahead of its rival. \"Cleo\" was an instant hit, selling its entire original print run in just two days; the magazine broke new ground in Australian mainstream publishing, featuring the first nude male centrefold (actor Jack Thompson) and frank articles on female sexuality and other topics, leading to the inclusion of the first sealed section in an Australian magazine. During the early months of the magazine, Buttrose became pregnant with her second child, Ben, but with the grudging support of the Packers she worked through her pregnancy; an unusual feat for that time as it was still common for women to have to give up work permanently after they became pregnant.\n\nButtrose edited \"Cleo\" until 1975, when she was appointed editor of the Packers' flagship magazine, \"The Australian Women's Weekly\" (1975–76), then she became editor-in-chief of both publications from 1976–78, before being appointed Publisher of Australian Consolidated Press Women's Division from 1978–81. In 1981 she left the Packers after their rival Rupert Murdoch offered her the job of Editor-in-Chief of the \"Daily Telegraph\" and \"Sunday Telegraph\" in 1981, making her the first female editor of a major metropolitan newspaper in Australia, a position she held until 1984; she was also appointed to the board of News Limited. She made frequent appearances on radio and TV and in 1980, her media prominence led to her becoming the subject of the song \"Ita\", recorded by rock band Cold Chisel, which was included on their successful \"East\" album.\n\nButtrose was the chairperson of the National Advisory Committee on AIDS (NACAIDS) from 1984 until 1988. On one occasion, she appeared personally in a nationwide TV campaign to explain that \"donating\" blood at a blood bank did not pose a risk of catching AIDS (the fear of which had caused a significant drop in donations).\n\nAfter her stint with News Limited, Buttrose founded her own publishing company, Capricorn Publishing, and launched her own magazine, \"Ita\", but this eventually folded and she launched a new company, the Good Life Publishing Company, which in 2005 published \"bark!\", a lifestyle magazine aimed at dog owners.\nButtrose is also a prolific author and has published nine books, including her autobiography, \"A Passionate Life\". In 2011 Penguin published \"A Guide to Australian Etiquette\".\n\nButtrose was a regular on \"Beauty and the Beast\" in the 1990s and early 2000s. Buttrose was also a regular commentator on the Nine Network breakfast show \"Today\" and was at one point considered to replace Kerri-Anne Kennerley in the network's morning slot.\n\nIn June 2013, Buttrose joined Network Ten where she hosted morning program \"Studio 10\" two mornings a week for the station alongside Joe Hildebrand, Sarah Harris, Denise Drysdale and Jessica Rowe. The show premiered in late 2013. However, 2016 saw Buttrose reduce her appearances on the program to just twice a week to spend more time with her grandchildren.\n\nIn April 2018, Buttrose resigned as panelist on \"Studio 10\" to focus on other parts of her life, including spending more time with her grandchildren and writing.\n\nSince leaving Network Ten, Buttrose has appeared on \"The Morning Show\" on the Seven Network and filled in for Sonia Kruger on \"Today Extra\" on the Nine Network. In 2019 she was appointed chairman of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC).\n\nButtrose was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1979, and appointed an Officer of the Order of Australia (AO) in 1988. In 2003, she was awarded the Centenary Medal. Buttrose was inducted to the Victorian Honour Roll of Women in 2001, and advanced to Companion of the Order of Australia in 2019.\n\nIn August 2017 Buttrose was recognised for Outstanding Lifetime Achievement at the annual Kennedy Awards for Excellence in Journalism.\n\nIn 1984 she was named the Variety Club 'Personality of the Year' as well as winning the Australasian Academy of Broadcast, Arts and Sciences for the 'Most Promising Newcomer to Radio'. In 1993 Buttrose was named Juvenile Diabetes Foundation's 'Australian of the Year'. In 2011 she was elected President of Alzheimer's Australia until end of June 2014. She is currently an ambassador for Alzheimer's Australia.\n\nIn January 2013, Buttrose was named the 2013 Australian of the Year. She was awarded an honorary Doctor of Letters degree by Macquarie University in 2014 in recognition of her contribution to the arts. In 2015, she was awarded a second honorary Doctor of Letters degree by the University of Wollongong for her distinguished service to Australian society and for her commitment to advocating for vulnerable people in the community. She was awarded an honorary Doctor of the University degree by the University of New South Wales in 2018 in recognition of her eminent service to health, and for being an inspirational role model for aspiring women in business and for those wanting to make a difference in society.\n\nAmong her many other public service and charitable activities, Buttrose is a patron of Women of Vision, World Vision Australia, the University of Third Age, the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation of Australia, Amarant, the National Menopause Foundation, the Sydney Women's Festival, Safety House and the National Institute of Secretaries and Administrators. \n\nButtrose is also an ambassador of the Australian Women Chamber of Commerce (AWCCI) and sits on the AWCCI Advisory Board. She works on the professional speakers' circuit, and is associated with Saxton Speakers.\n\nIn April 2011, Buttrose and \"Cleo\" were the subject of the ABC-TV two-part telemovie \"\", starring Asher Keddie as Buttrose, Rob Carlton as Kerry Packer and Tony Barry as Frank Packer.\n\nIn 1975, while editing the \"Women's Weekly\" Buttrose's first marriage to Alasdair \"Mac\" Macdonald broke down and the couple divorced in 1976. Later she met Peter Sawyer and they married in 1979. By her own account it was \"not a very happy marriage\"; Sawyer left in 1980 and they subsequently divorced.\n\nButtrose cared for her father after he was diagnosed with vascular dementia. He died in 1999.\n\nIn his 2007 book \"Who Killed Channel Nine?\", former Nine Network producer Gerald Stone claimed that Buttrose and Kerry Packer conducted a private but intense affair during Buttrose's tenure on \"Cleo\" and that Packer reportedly even offered to marry her, but she rejected the idea and they split after a \"blazing row\". Buttrose herself has repeatedly declined to comment on the matter.\n\nButtrose resides in Sydney.\n\nButtrose has authored or co-authored 10 books:\n\n\n\n\n"}

However, this confederacy was formed by the Tongan chief, Ma'afu.\n\nThe Tovata Confederacy, (unlike the Kubuna and Burebasaga confederacies) is a recent invention. It was conceived in 14th February 1867 by Ma’afu as cited in the Na Mata as follows:\nA tauyavutaka na turaga ni Toga o Ma'afu ena nona via vakacokovatataka na vanua era vakarorogo vua, ena veirogorogoci kei ira na turaga ni vanua o Bua, Macuata, Cakaudrove kei Lau.\nThe key word here is “veirogorogoci” which denotes “listening to each other”. In other words, this confederacy's membership are equal in rank which is why during traditional oratures and discourses, it is referred to as “Matanitu Veiwekani. Seen another way, this is Fiji's equivalent of a United Nations of sorts, where each chief is of equal ranking with other chiefs in the Tovata jurisdiction.\nKubuna and Burebasaga confederacies, on the other hand have layers upon layers of chief, vassal warlord, chieftain and ranks within ranks, underscoring its long alliances and relationships in-built into it. Tovata is not like that. It is more even and democratic in structure. It was conceived by Ma’afu and headed by the British consul in Levuka as its prime minister.\n\nThere is no paramount chief in the Tovata Confederacy.\n\nAlthough the smallest of the three confederacies, Tovata has been the most politically influential. \"Ratu Sir\" Lala Sukuna, considered the father of modern Fiji, was from Tovata, as were \"Ratu Sir\" Kamisese Mara, Fiji's longtime first prime minister and second president; Ratu Sir Penaia Ganilau, the first president of Fiji. In addition, Sitiveni Rabuka, former prime minister, and Laisenia Qarase, the recently removed prime minister, are also from Tovata. Political and youth activist Roko Jonetani (a.k.a. Pita) Waqavonovono is also from Tovata. Other notable leaders are Tui Cakau Ratu Naiqama Lalabalavu and Ratu Epeli Ganilau, both of whom have been politically active.\n\nBusiness persons also from Tovata include Roko Matai of the Yatu Lau and Mere Samisoni, founder of the bakery chain Hot Bread Kitchen and a former Member of Parliament.\n\n\n\n"}

She was also regent of Eswatini from 1983 to 1986. She is the mother of King Mswati III.\n\nNtfombi was born in 1950. She married King Sobhuza II of Swaziland, with whom she had a son, Prince Makhosetive Dlamini.\n\nIn 1982 King Sobhuza designated another of his wives, Queen Dzeliwe, as the \"Indlovukati\" to reign as joint sovereign with his future successor. Instead of recognizing one of her sons as his heir apparent, he indicated to his \"Loqoqo\" that he wanted Prince Makhosetive Dlamini to succeed him on the throne. In June 1982 he also extended the authority of the \"Loqoqo\", empowering it to act as a \"Supreme Council of State\", free to appoint an \"Authorised Person\" to exercise the royal prerogative if a regent was deemed unable to do so properly. \n\nIn the power vacuum that resulted from the death of Sobhuza II, \"Indlovukati\" Dzeliwe became Queen Regent during the minority of the designated heir to the throne, but the \"Loqoqo\", consisting mostly of King Sobhuza's senior relatives, chiefs and advisors, usurped her authority and sacked Sobhuza's prime minister, Prince Mabandla Dlamini, whom \"Loqoqo\" members apparently feared would strip them of their new role. Once Prince Makhosetive Dlamini attained his majority and officially became king, his mother would then be expected to be designated as the new \"Indlovukati\".

As Queen Mother, Ntfombi is seen as the spiritual and national head of state, while her son is considered the administrative head of state.\n\nThe Indlovukazi's image has been widely disseminated in the West since her inclusion in Andy Warhol's portrait series during her exercise of the regency for her son, as one of four \"Reigning Queens\", along with Queens Beatrix of the Netherlands, Margrethe II of Denmark and Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom.\n"}

The original dam was washed away and the citizens of Le Roy rebuilt it and named the body of water \"Lake Louise\" for Hambrecht's sister. In 1961 local advocates arranged a visit by state park officials, who agreed that Wildwood Park could be expanded into a state park.

The town has a population of 4,415, while Irig municipality has 10,866 inhabitants.\n\nIn Serbian, the town is known as \"Irig\" (Ириг), in Croatian as \"Irig\", in Hungarian as \"Ireg\" or \"Ürög\", in German as \"Irick\", in Slovak as \"Irig\", and in Rusyn as Ириґ.\n\nIrig was first mentioned in the historical documents in 1225. In the 15th century, the masters of the town were Serbian despots Vuk Grgurević, Đorđe Branković, and Jovan Branković. During the 15th and 16th century, ten Orthodox monasteries were built in the surrounding of Irig (Two of those were located just near the town). \n\nBetween 1526 and 1699, the town was under Ottoman administration. During this time, it belonged to the Sanjak of Syrmia, and was the administrative seat of one of the seven nahijas in that sanjak. In 1665, the town had 2,000 houses, one mosque and two monasteries. In this time, Irig was mostly inhabited by Muslim population.\n\nSince 1699, Irig was part of the Habsburg Monarchy. In the 18th century, Irig was one of the most important market centers in Srem and most of its inhabitants were Serbs. \n\nIn 1795-1796, the population of the town was decimated by plague. Popular local story claims that the patient zero was Anđelija Kuzmanović. She attended her sister's funeral in the village of Krnješevci near Stara Pazova, and brought back with her the plague infested rug to Irig, thus inadvertently spreading the disease. Kuzmanović died from plague on 14 June 1795. Historically, the plague was brought to Zemun by the Ottoman merchants and soldiers in the spring of 1795. Frightened citizens escaped to their relatives on Fruška Gora, spreading the disease.\n\nAustrian authorities didn't try to heal the diseased, except for providing some painkiller medications, as their main goal was to isolate Irig and the surrounding villages as denizens of Irig also fled into the mountain. Punishment for the breaking out of the military imposed quarantine was death. After four months the residents returned only to find the scorched town: out of 912 houses, Austrian authorities burned or demolished 402. From the total population of 4,813, 2,548 died of this disease. It took over 120 years for Irig to reach the 1795 population. In appreciation for establishing the strict border between two towns and preventing the spreading of the plague into the nearby Ruma, citizens of Ruma built the memorial on the location of this \"border crossing\", made from 800 bricks taken from the demolished houses in Irig, which still stands. Built in 1797 and named \"Kipovi\" (\"Statues\"), the monument is protected as the cultural monument.\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th century, Irig was a district capital in the Syrmia County of the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia. \n\nAccording to the 1900 census, the population of the Irig municipality numbered 22,313 inhabitants, of whom 16,893 were Orthodox Serbs, while the town of Irig itself had 5,196 inhabitants, of whom 3,936 were Orthodox Serbs. According to the 1910 census, the population of the Irig municipality numbered 25,320 inhabitants, of whom 18,331 spoke Serbian, 3,552 Hungarian, 1,816 Croatian, and 1,031 German.\n\nSince 1918, Irig was part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later renamed to Kingdom of Yugoslavia) and subsequent South Slavic and Serb states. During World War II, 417 inhabitants of the town were executed by German fascists.\n\nLocated on the southern slopes of Fruška Gora, Irig has a specific microclimate which provides excellent conditions for viticulture.\n\nIn the area surrounding Irig, there are 8 monasteries surviving today, built in the 15th and 16th century: Velika Remeta, Krušedol, Staro Hopovo, Mala Remeta, Novo Hopovo, Jazak, Grgeteg and Vrdnik.\n\nSerbian reading-room (\"Srpska čitaonica\") is the oldest Serbian library in Vojvodina. It was founded in 1842 by Dimitrije Krestić, archimandrite of the Krušedol monastery. Originally it was located in three rooms of the local school (two were reading-rooms, one was library). Today it is situated in the Culture House, with 45,000 books, numerous painting, documents and photographs. The library contained first edition of works of Dositej Obradović, oldest editions of the \"Letopis Matice srpske\", etc. \n\nFrom the earliest days, both local and foreign newspapers (from Belgrade, Serbia, Pest, Croatia, Germany, etc.) could be read in it. During World War II, German soldiers and officers used the library as their quarters. Before their withdrawal, they blew up the building which then burned to the ground. The inhabitants rebuilt it themselves. Over 500 old books were donated by the citizens. The first theatrical shows in Irig were played in 1905.\n\nIrig municipality includes the town of Irig and the following villages:\n\nAccording to the 2011 census results, the municipality of Irig has 10,866 inhabitants.\n\nThe total population of the Irig municipality is 10,866, which includes:\n\nMost of the local communities are ethnically Serb, while two have a Hungarian majority: Šatrinci (Hungarian: Satrinca) and Dobrodol (Hungarian: Dobradópuszta).\n\nThe following table gives a preview of total number of registered people employed in legal entities per their core activity (as of 2018):\n\n\n\n"}

Borda count is an example of this.\n\nThe failure of the consistency criterion can be seen as an example of Simpson's paradox.\n\nAs shown below under Kemeny-Young, passing or failing the consistency criterion can depend on whether the election selects a single winner or a full ranking of the candidates (sometimes referred to as ranking consistency); in fact, the specific examples below rely on finding single winner inconsistency by choosing two different rankings with the same overall winner, which means they do not apply to ranking consistency.\n\nThis example shows that Copeland's method violates the consistency criterion. Assume five candidates A, B, C, D and E with 27 voters with the following preferences:\nNow, the set of all voters is divided into two groups at the bold line. The voters over the line are the first group of voters; the others are the second group of voters.\n\nIn the following the Copeland winner for the first group of voters is determined.\nThe results would be tabulated as follows:\n\nResult: With the votes of the first group of voters, A can defeat three of the four opponents, whereas no other candidate wins against more than two opponents. Thus, A is elected Copeland winner by the first group of voters.\n\nNow, the Copeland winner for the second group of voters is determined.\nThe results would be tabulated as follows:\nResult: Taking only the votes of the second group in account, again, A can defeat three of the four opponents, whereas no other candidate wins against more than two opponents. Thus, A is elected Copeland winner by the second group of voters.\n\nFinally, the Copeland winner of the complete set of voters is determined.\nThe results would be tabulated as follows:\nResult: C is the Condorcet winner, thus Copeland chooses C as winner.\n\nA is the Copeland winner within the first group of voters and also within the second group of voters. However, both groups combined elect C as the Copeland winner. Thus, Copeland fails the consistency criterion.\n\nThis example shows that Instant-runoff voting violates the consistency criterion. Assume three candidates A, B and C and 23 voters with the following preferences:\nNow, the set of all voters is divided into two groups at the bold line. The voters over the line are the first group of voters; the others are the second group of voters.\n\nIn the following the instant-runoff winner for the first group of voters is determined.\nB has only 2 votes and is eliminated first. Its votes are transferred to A. Now, A has 6 votes and wins against C with 4 votes.\nResult: A wins against C, after B has been eliminated.\n\nNow, the instant-runoff winner for the second group of voters is determined.\nC has the fewest votes, a count of 3, and is eliminated. A benefits from that, gathering all the votes from C. Now, with 7 votes A wins against B with 6 votes.\nResult: A wins against B, after C has been eliminated.\n\nFinally, the instant runoff winner of the complete set of voters is determined.\n\nC has the fewest first preferences and so is eliminated first, its votes are split: 4 are transferred to B and 3 to A. Thus, B wins with 12 votes against 11 votes of A.\nResult: B wins against A, after C is eliminated.\n\nA is the instant-runoff winner within the first group of voters and also within the second group of voters. However, both groups combined elect B as the instant-runoff winner. Thus, instant-runoff voting fails the consistency criterion.\n\nThis example shows that the Kemeny–Young method violates the consistency criterion. Assume three candidates A, B and C and 38 voters with the following preferences:\nNow, the set of all voters is divided into two groups at the bold line. The voters over the line are the first group of voters; the others are the second group of voters.\n\nIn the following the Kemeny-Young winner for the first group of voters is determined.\nThe Kemeny–Young method arranges the pairwise comparison counts in the following tally table:\n\nThe ranking scores of all possible rankings are:\nResult: The ranking A > B > C has the highest ranking score. Thus, A wins ahead of B and C.\n\nNow, the Kemeny-Young winner for the second group of voters is determined.\nThe Kemeny–Young method arranges the pairwise comparison counts in the following tally table:\n\nThe ranking scores of all possible rankings are:\nResult: The ranking A > C > B has the highest ranking score. Hence, A wins ahead of C and B.\n\nFinally, the Kemeny-Young winner of the complete set of voters is determined.\n\nThe Kemeny–Young method arranges the pairwise comparison counts in the following tally table:\n\nThe ranking scores of all possible rankings are:\nResult: The ranking B > A > C has the highest ranking score. So, B wins ahead of A and C.\n\nA is the Kemeny-Young winner within the first group of voters and also within the second group of voters. However, both groups combined elect B as the Kemeny-Young winner. Thus, the Kemeny–Young method fails the consistency criterion.\n\nThe Kemeny-Young method satisfies ranking consistency; that is, if the electorate is divided arbitrarily into two parts and separate elections in each part result in the same ranking being selected, an election of the entire electorate also selects that ranking.\n\nThe Kemeny-Young score of a ranking formula_1 is computed by summing up the number of pairwise comparisons on each ballot that match the ranking formula_1. Thus, the Kemeny-Young score formula_3 for an electorate formula_4 can be computed by separating the electorate into disjoint subsets formula_5 (with formula_6), computing the Kemeny-Young scores for these subsets and adding it up:\n\nNow, consider an election with electorate formula_4. The premise of the consistency criterion is to divide the electorate arbitrarily into two parts formula_5, and in each part the same ranking formula_1 is selected. This means, that the Kemeny-Young score for the ranking formula_1 in each electorate is bigger than for every other ranking formula_12:\n\nNow, it has to be shown, that the Kemeny-Young score of the ranking formula_1 in the entire electorate is bigger than the Kemeny-Young score of every other ranking formula_12:\n\nThus, the Kemeny-Young method is consistent with respect to complete rankings.\n\nThis example shows that majority judgment violates the consistency criterion. Assume two candidates A and B and 10 voters with the following ratings:\nNow, the set of all voters is divided into two groups at the bold line. The voters over the line are the first group of voters; the others are the second group of voters.\n\nIn the following the majority judgment winner for the first group of voters is determined.\nThe sorted ratings would be as follows:\nResult: With the votes of the first group of voters, A has the median rating of \"Excellent\" and B has the median rating of \"Fair\". Thus, A is elected majority judgment winner by the first group of voters.\n\nNow, the majority judgment winner for the second group of voters is determined.\nThe sorted ratings would be as follows:\nResult: Taking only the votes of the second group in account, A has the median rating of \"Fair\" and B the median rating of \"Poor\". Thus, A is elected majority judgment winner by the second group of voters.\n\nFinally, the majority judgment winner of the complete set of voters is determined.\nThe sorted ratings would be as follows:\nThe median ratings for A and B are both \"Fair\". Since there is a tie, \"Fair\" ratings are removed from both, until their medians become different. After removing 20% \"Fair\" ratings from the votes of each, the sorted ratings are now:\nResult: Now, the median rating of A is \"Poor\" and the median rating of B is \"Fair\". Thus, B is elected majority judgment winner.\n\nA is the majority judgment winner within the first group of voters and also within the second group of voters. However, both groups combined elect B as the Majority Judgment winner. Thus, Majority Judgment fails the consistency criterion.\n\nThis example shows that the minimax method violates the consistency criterion. Assume four candidates A, B, C and D with 43 voters with the following preferences:\nSince all preferences are strict rankings (no equals are present), all three minimax methods (winning votes, margins and pairwise opposite) elect the same winners.\n\nNow, the set of all voters is divided into two groups at the bold line. The voters over the line are the first group of voters; the others are the second group of voters.\n\nIn the following the minimax winner for the first group of voters is determined.\nThe results would be tabulated as follows:\n\nResult: The candidates B, C and D form a cycle with clear defeats. A benefits from that since it loses relatively closely against all three and therefore A's biggest defeat is the closest of all candidates. Thus, A is elected minimax winner by the first group of voters.\n\nNow, the minimax winner for the second group of voters is determined.\nThe results would be tabulated as follows:\nResult: Taking only the votes of the second group in account, again, B, C and D form a cycle with clear defeats and A benefits from that because of its relatively close losses against all three and therefore A's biggest defeat is the closest of all candidates. Thus, A is elected minimax winner by the second group of voters.\n\nFinally, the minimax winner of the complete set of voters is determined.\nThe results would be tabulated as follows:\nResult: Again, B, C and D form a cycle. But now, their mutual defeats are very close. Therefore, the defeats A suffers from all three are relatively clear. With a small advantage over B and D, C is elected minimax winner.\n\nA is the minimax winner within the first group of voters and also within the second group of voters. However, both groups combined elect C as the Minimax winner. Thus, Minimax fails the consistency criterion.\n\nThis example shows that the Ranked pairs method violates the consistency criterion. Assume three candidates A, B and C with 39 voters with the following preferences:\nNow, the set of all voters is divided into two groups at the bold line. The voters over the line are the first group of voters; the others are the second group of voters.\n\nIn the following the Ranked pairs winner for the first group of voters is determined.\nThe results would be tabulated as follows:\n\nThe sorted list of victories would be:\nResult: B > C and A > B are locked in first (and C > A can't be locked in after that), so the full ranking is A > B > C. Thus, A is elected Ranked pairs winner by the first group of voters.\n\nNow, the Ranked pairs winner for the second group of voters is determined.\nThe results would be tabulated as follows:\nThe sorted list of victories would be:\nResult: Taking only the votes of the second group in account, A > C and C > B are locked in first (and B > A can't be locked in after that), so the full ranking is A > C > B. Thus, A is elected Ranked pairs winner by the second group of voters.\n\nFinally, the Ranked pairs winner of the complete set of voters is determined.\nThe results would be tabulated as follows:\nThe sorted list of victories would be:\nResult: Now, all three pairs (A > C, B > C and B > A) can be locked in without a cycle. The full ranking is B > A > C. Thus, Ranked pairs chooses B as winner, which is the Condorcet winner, due to the lack of a cycle.\n\nA is the Ranked pairs winner within the first group of voters and also within the second group of voters. However, both groups combined elect B as the Ranked pairs winner. Thus, the Ranked pairs method fails the consistency criterion.\n\nThis example shows that the Schulze method violates the consistency criterion. Again, assume three candidates A, B and C with 39 voters with the following preferences:\nNow, the set of all voters is divided into two groups at the bold line. The voters over the line are the first group of voters; the others are the second group of voters.\n\nIn the following the Schulze winner for the first group of voters is determined.\nThe pairwise preferences would be tabulated as follows:\nNow, the strongest paths have to be identified, e.g. the path A > B > C is stronger than the direct path A > C (which is nullified, since it is a loss for A).\nResult: A > B, A > C and B > C prevail, so the full ranking is A > B > C. Thus, A is elected Schulze winner by the first group of voters.\n\nNow, the Schulze winner for the second group of voters is determined.\nThe pairwise preferences would be tabulated as follows:\nNow, the strongest paths have to be identified, e.g. the path A > C > B is stronger than the direct path A > B.\nResult: A > B, A > C and C > B prevail, so the full ranking is A > C > B. Thus, A is elected Schulze winner by the second group of voters.\n\nFinally, the Schulze winner of the complete set of voters is determined.\nThe pairwise preferences would be tabulated as follows:\nNow, the strongest paths have to be identified:\nResult: A > C, B > A and B > C prevail, so the full ranking is B > A > C. Thus, Schulze chooses B as winner. In fact, B is also Condorcet winner.\n\nA is the Schulze winner within the first group of voters and also within the second group of voters. However, both groups combined elect B as the Schulze winner. Thus, the Schulze method fails the consistency criterion.\n\n"}
{"id": "1792865", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1792865", "title": "USS Sands (DD-243)", "text": "USS Sands (DD-243)\n\nThe first USS \"Sands\" (DD-243/APD-13) was a \"Clemson\"-class destroyer in the United States Navy during World War II. She was the first ship named for Benjamin F. Sands and his son, James H. Sands.\n\n\"Sands\" was ordered from the New York Shipbuilding Corporation on 29 December 1917, and was laid down on 22 March 1919 at the New York Shipbuilding Corporation's, Camden, New Jersey shipyard. The ship was launched on 28 October 1919, sponsored by Miss Jane McCue Sands. \"Sands\" was commissioned on 10 November 1920, Ensign William D. Leahy, Jr. in temporary command.\n\nFollowing commissioning, \"Sands\" remained at Philadelphia to fit out for European duty. On 22 November, Lieutenant M. L. Sperry, Jr., relieved Ens. Leahy as temporary commanding officer; and, on 13 December, Commander Robert L. Ghormley assumed command. The next day, the destroyer departed from Philadelphia; steamed to Melville, Rhode Island, for torpedo outfit; then proceeded to New York. On 3 January 1921, she sailed for Europe. She arrived at Brest on the 16th and, for the next seven months, conducted runs between French and British ports. In mid-August, she steamed for the Baltic; called at various ports on that sea, despite the still present danger of mines, and returned to Cherbourg on 27 September. Three weeks later, she cleared the French coast and headed for the eastern Mediterranean-Black Sea area. There, fighting between Greeks and Turks in coastal Asia Minor; between Turks and Armenians on the Anatolian plateau; and between Red and White forces in Russia had created problems including disease, poverty, and famine.\n\nAssigned to provide dispatch service to support American Relief Committee efforts, and to protect American nationals and interests, \"Sands\" arrived at Allied-occupied Constantinople on 11 November. Nine days later, she fueled at the Standard Oil docks at Selvi Bournu, then commenced her first cruise. Into late December, she steamed off Samsun and Trebizond, observing as Greeks were deported from those areas. After returning briefly to Constantinople, she steamed to Alexandretta, whence she continued on to Cilicia. There she called at Mersin, site of an American mission and relief distribution center, and remained through most of January 1922. On 3 February, she was back at Constantinople; and, on the 8th, she got underway for Novorossiysk. From the 8th to the 19th, she supported relief work in that city, then proceeded to Samsun where, with one interruption to retrieve a drifting barge near Inebole, she remained until 8 March. Two days later, she returned to Constantinople; and, on the 18th, she shifted to Selvi Bournu to assist in firefighting efforts in the oil storage area. With the fires under control, she put back into Constantinople and, on the 22d, got underway to again call at Mersin. By 7 April, she had retransited the Dardanelles and the Sea of Marmora. On 8 May, she passed through the Bosporus. From the 9th to the 22d, she was at Odessa, whence she shifted to Theodosia and then continued to Novorossisk. In early June, she was at Trebizond; and, on the 4th, she arrived at Samsun where, for several days, she steamed off the harbor entrance as Greek and Turkish forces exchanged fire.\n\n\"Sands\" returned to Constantinople on 9 July and soon afterward sailed for Gibraltar and the United States. From August into November, she underwent overhaul at Philadelphia. By late December, she had joined the Scouting Fleet at New York; and, on 3 January 1923, she departed from that city for winter maneuvers in the Caribbean. In February, she participated in Fleet Problem I, an exercise designed to test the defenses of the Panama Canal. During March and April, she conducted operations in the Greater Antilles; and, in May, she moved back to the east coast. In July, after overhaul, she headed north to the New England coast. In the autumn, she commenced operations off the mid-Atlantic seaboard; and, in January 1924, she again sailed south for winter maneuvers.\n\nThrough the decade and into the 1930s, \"Sands\" maintained a similar schedule. On 10 November 1930, however, after completing exercises off southern New England, she proceeded to Philadelphia, where she began inactivation. She was decommissioned on 13 February 1931 and was berthed at League Island until ordered activated in the summer of 1932.\n\nRecommissioned on 21 July, the destroyer moved to Norfolk, Virginia; and, in August, she sailed for the west coast. On 8 September, she arrived at her new base, San Diego, California, and commenced operations off the southern California coast. With the new year, 1933, she steamed to Hawaii for fleet exercises, and, in mid-February, returned to California. During the spring, she operated off the coast of Washington; and, in July, she resumed exercises out of San Diego. Three months later, she joined Rotating Destroyer Squadron 20 and remained in reserve through the winter. Activated in April 1934, she joined Destroyer Division 9 and got underway for the Caribbean and fleet exercises. By mid-November, she was back in southern California, where she remained, with one interruption – Fleet Problem XVI in the North Pacific (May 1935) – until April 1936. She then returned to the east coast; participated in exercises in the Caribbean and off New England; and steamed back to San Diego in October. For the next two years, she operated primarily in the southern California area, with exercises in the Hawaiian Islands during the spring and autumn of 1937 and the spring of 1938. On her return in April 1938, she operated locally into the summer, then prepared for inactivation.\n\n\"Sands\" was decommissioned at San Diego on 15 September 1938. Within a year, however, war broke out in Europe and the destroyer was ordered activated for Neutrality Patrol duty.\n\nRecommissioned on 26 September 1939, \"Sands\" departed the west coast on 13 November and, a little over a month later, took up patrol duty in the Caribbean. She remained there into the spring of 1940, then moved north for patrol and escort duty off the eastern seaboard from the Virginia Capes to the Maritime Provinces. Before the end of the year, she returned to the Pacific and resumed operations off California.\n\nWith the entry of the United States into World War II, \"Sands\" commenced coastal escort work, which continued into the spring of 1942. Then, as the Japanese moved into the western Aleutian Islands, she shifted to Alaska and, through the summer, escorted convoys and conducted patrols from the mainland to ports in the eastern Aleutians. By fall, the Allies were taking the offensive, and \"Sands\" was needed for a different mission. On 28 October, she sailed south. Two days later, she was redesignated APD-13; and, on 5 November, she arrived at San Francisco for conversion to a high speed transport.\n\n\"Sands\" departed from San Francisco on 21 December. Steaming west, she reached Pearl Harbor at the end of the year; conducted exercises into January 1943; and, on the 8th, resumed her Pacific crossing. On the 22d, she arrived at Espiritu Santo and, as a transport and as an escort, began moving reinforcements and supplies into the Guadalcanal-Tulagi area. On the 29th, she was detached from duties at Tulagi and ordered to accompany , toward Rennell Island to assist . Rendezvousing the next morning, the tug took the damaged cruiser in tow, and \"Sands\" joined \"Chicago\"s escort of five destroyers in a circular screen. The eight ships then began making their way to Tulagi. At 1620, the formation was attacked by Japanese torpedo planes. \"Navajo\" began evasive maneuvers. Antiaircraft guns on \"Sands\" and the destroyers were fired at the intruders, but \"Chicago\" was hit by another torpedo and, 20 minutes later, sank.\n\n\"Sands\", with nine wounded by the explosion of a 20 millimeter shell, picked up over 300 survivors and steamed for Espiritu Santo. Arriving on 1 February, she conducted amphibious exercises from the 4th to the 10th; completed another escort run to Guadalcanal and back by the 14th; and, on the 15th, with more marines embarked, steamed back to the Solomon Islands. Five days later, she departed Tulagi; crossed over to Koli Point; and, on the 21st, moved on to the Russell Islands; that night, she landed her assault troops unopposed; then returned to Tulagi, from where she made two more transport runs to the assault area before the 26th.\n\nAfter the occupation of the Russells, \"Sands\" continued to carry troops and supplies and to escort convoys in the New Caledonia-New Hebrides-Solomons area. With spring, she was transferred to the 7th Amphibious Force. On 14 May, she departed the New Hebrides; and, on the 20th, she arrived at Townsville, Australia, with an LST convoy.\n\nThrough the summer, she performed escort and patrol missions along the Queensland coast and completed numerous transport missions to move Allied forces up to, and along, the northern coast of the Papuan peninsula. By September, the forces were ready to move against Japanese positions on the Huon Peninsula and contest control of Vitiaz and Dampier Straits.\n\nOn 2 September, \"Sands\" embarked units of the 9th Australian Division, veterans of the North African desert and, two days later, landed them east of Lae. On the 5th, she retired, returning a few days later to shell the Japanese garrison at Lae as Allied forces closed on that village from the jungle and from mangrove swamps. At mid-month, she resumed transport and escort duties along the coast; and, on the 22d, she landed troops just north of Finschhafen.\n\nReinforcement-escort runs and amphibious exercises along the coast, from Port Moresby to the Huon Peninsula and between Papua and offshore islands, occupied October and November. In early December, at Goodenough Island, she loaded units of the 112th Cavalry Regiment for the assault on New Britain. On the 15th, she offloaded the troops into rubber landing boats which were to take them onto the Amalut Peninsula. The Japanese, however, opened fire before the boats reached the beach. Covering units, not knowing if the troops had landed, held their fire for fear of hitting the cavalrymen. Twelve of the 15 boats, riddled by Japanese fire, sank. Most surviving troops swam seaward. \"Sands\" and the escorting destroyer opened fire, silencing the coastal guns. The search for survivors began, and all but 16 were rescued.\n\nEleven days later, \"Sands\" returned to New Britain for another assault landing. On the 26th, she landed marines on Cape Gloucester, provided gunfire support as they moved off the beaches, then retired to stage for her next target, Saidor.\n\nOn 1 January 1944, the APD again departed Good-enough Island with assault troops embarked. A unit of Task Group 76.1, she transited Vitiaz Strait that night and, at 0735 on the 2nd, landed the troops on the beach at Saidor, 115 miles west of Finschhafen. By 0800, she was out of the transport area. In the afternoon, she returned to Buna roads and, until mid-month, made runs between there and Capes Cretin and Sudest.\n\nOn the 18th, \"Sands\" arrived at Sydney for a brief respite. On the 28th, she got underway to return to New Guinea with cargo and personnel for Milne Bay, Buna, and Cape Sudest. From 6 to 24 February, she completed another run to Sydney; then, on the 27th, loaded troops at Cape Sudest for transport to the assault beaches at Los Negros Island, Admiralties. Sailing on the 29th, she crossed the Bismarck Sea; arrived off the assault area shortly after 0730 the next day; dispatched her loaded LCP(R)s to the departure line by 0742; then, as the first waves reached the shore, commenced gunfire support operations. At 0835, \"Sands\"s boats hit the beach with the 3rd assault wave. The intense crossfire which had caught earlier waves continued as they approached. Poor organization on the beach slowed offloading and assisted the accuracy of the Japanese defenders. \"Sands\" suffered two casualties, one killed, one seriously injured, from her boat crews and lost her no. 1 boat.\n\nIn mid-afternoon, the APD departed the Los Negros-Manus area. Returning to Cape Sudest, she loaded much-needed reinforcements on 3 March and, the next day, disembarked them on the contested island and took on casualties. On the 5th, she was back at Cape Sudest, from where she resumed escort duty along the coast.\n\nIn early April, \"Sands\" trained army units in amphibious exercises. On the 18th, she embarked units of the 162nd Infantry and got underway for Humboldt Bay. Steaming with TG 77.2, the Central Attack Group for the Hollandia operation, she arrived in the transport area early on the morning of the 22nd. At 0600, her boats were lowered and loaded. Five minutes later, they were en route to the departure line. At 0735, they returned and were hoisted on board. The APD then took up gunfire support duties.\n\nOn the 24th, \"Sands\" returned to Cape Cretin, and from there proceeded to Cape Sudest for availability. In May, she resumed escort and transport runs but, at mid-month, interrupted them to return to California.\n\nAfter an overhaul at Alameda, \"Sands\" carried passengers to Pearl Harbor; embarked 126 men of the 81st Division Reconnaissance Company there, and arrived in the Solomons on 24 August to rehearse the Palau operation. Two weeks later, she steamed northwest, arriving in the transport area off Anguar Island on the 15th. Acting as reserve for the Peleliu Island assault, she remained off Anguar during the initial landings on the former island. At mid-morning, she shifted to Peleliu to support the forces ashore. On the 17th, she returned to Anguar and, on the 18th, landed the reconnaissance company on Red Beach. On the 19th, she went alongside ; embarked the 323nd Reconnaissance Company and then, with , proceeded to Ulithi. There until the 25th, she landed her troops without opposition, then got underway to return to Hollandia. Arriving on the 28th, she shifted to Manus on the 29th; equipped her boats with mine-sweeping gear, embarked minesweeping personnel, and, on 10 October, steamed for Leyte with units of Mine Squadron 2.\n\nDespite poor weather and two appendectomies which were performed aboard ship, \"Sands\" arrived in the approaches to Leyte Gulf on the 17th. On the 18th, she closed Suluan Island, took off reconnaissance troops landed previously by and transferred them to that ship. On the 19th, she moved up to the assault area and lowered her LCP(R)s to conduct shallow water minesweeping operations. From 1155 to 1410, she covered her boats as they swept the approaches to Red and White beaches near Tacloban. Straddled, but not hit, by Japanese batteries, the boats completed their mission and returned to the APD. \"Sands\" then shifted to the Dulag beaches, where her boats conducted further shallow water sweeps.\n\nDuring the night, \"Sands\" patrolled in Leyte Gulf. In the morning, she returned to the Tacloban area to provide gunfire support there. In the afternoon, she shifted to the Dulag area for the same purpose; and, on the 21st, she got underway to return to New Guinea.\n\nDuring November, the APD conducted a resupply and reinforcement run to Leyte and back, then prepared for the invasion of Luzon. On 27 December, she departed Hollandia for the Palaus and Leyte. On 2 January 1945, she cleared San Pedro Bay. On the 4th, Japanese aerial resistance began. The next day, her task group, 77.2, steamed up the Luzon coast. Land-based Japanese aircraft again attacked. On the 6th, the force arrived off Lingayen Gulf and, despite \"kamikaze\" accuracy; the ships entered the gulf and took up their stations. \"Sands\", with other APDs, bombarded Santiago Island. On the 7th, she covered the YMSs as they conducted sweeps, and then closed Orange and Green beaches to cover underwater demolition teams as they removed obstacles from the landing area. On the 8th, she moved to the transport area where she remained, on patrol, until the 13th. She then got underway for Leyte and Ulithi.\n\nThe APD arrived in the Western Carolines on the 24th and remained through February. On 1 March, she joined a convoy for Iwo Jima, arrived on the 3rd, patrolled through the 5th, and sailed for Saipan on the 6th, escorting retiring transports. From the Marianas, she sailed to the Solomons, New Caledonia, and the Admiralties, from where she returned to Ulithi to escort reinforcements to the Ryukyus. By mid-June, she had completed three runs to the Okinawa area and had begun her last Pacific crossing. On the 30th, she arrived at Pearl Harbor, and, on 11 July, she returned to San Diego.\n\n\"Sands\" remained on the west coast through the end of hostilities. On 29 August, she got underway for Philadelphia, where she was decommissioned on 10 October 1945. Struck from the Navy list on 1 November, she was sold for scrapping to the Boston Metals Company the following spring.\n\n\"Sands\" earned nine battle stars for her World War II service.\n\n\n"}

The theory is based upon and has further developed the intergovernmentalist theory and offers a more authentic perspective than its predecessor with its inclusion of both neo-liberal and realist aspects in its theory.\n\nLiberal intergovernmentalism was created to be a grand theory. The theory seeks to explain the broader transformation of regional integration. Liberal intergovernmentalists theorists argue that it is impossible to explain the concept of the European Union with a single factor and believe that different approaches or theories are needed to genuinely understand the complexity of the EU.\nLiberal intergovernmentalism views states as the main actors, and sees the EU as an international institution that can be studied by viewing states as the main actors in a situation of anarchy, where each state achieves their goal through negotiations and bargaining. Liberal intergovernmentalism especially studies the process of these negotiations and bargaining between EU's member states.\n\nAndrew Moravcsik in his book The Choice for Europe (1998) defines EU integration:\n\"EU integration can best be understood as a series of rational choices made by national leaders. These choices responded to constraints and opportunities stemming from the economic interests relative power of powerful domestic constituents, the of states stemming from asymmetrical interdependence, and the role of institutions in bolstering the credibility of interstate commitments.\"\n\nLiberal intergovernmentalism has demonstrated its usefulness with its methods of organizing and constructing empirical studies. However, liberal intergovernmentalism has also been heavily criticized. A general criticism of liberal intergovernmentalism is that it focuses on the theory of grand bargaining and major decisions, and that it has no way of explaining everyday decision-making procedures. Many critics point out that liberal intergovernmentalism exclusively focuses on the treaty-amending moments and member-states economic interests, while it overlooks the everyday policy agendas that represent the majority of EU policies.. Furthermore, Moravcsik's scholarship never put forward a detailed liberal intergovernmentalist account of the powers of the European Court of Justice, although a (modified) liberal intergovernmentalist account of European legal integration is certainly possible . \nMoravcsik, Andrew / Schimmelfennig, Frank (2009): \"Liberal Intergovernmentalism.\" In: Wiener, Antje / Diez, Thomas (ed.): European Integrations Theory.

It is generally considered a myth.\n\nLike most folklore, it is impossible to trace the origins of keraunography. However, it seems to have attracted scientific and media attention in England in the early 19th century, and by Victorian times the term \"keraunography\" had been coined to describe numerous unconnected events. With increasing scientific understanding of electricity and the popularity of photography, the time was right in the 19th century for keraunography, which seems to combine both concepts, to enter the public consciousness. However, it is likely that anecdotal accounts of keraunography had existed long before there was a word for it.\n\nLightning, being a dramatic and often-seen (yet mysterious and poorly understood) aspect of nature, has since ancient times been the subject of mythology and folklore regarding its origins, effects, and various ways to ward it off. As mentioned previously, the 19th century were a breeding ground for myths about electricity and photography. Sympsychography, by which brain waves are used to produce a photographic image, was a deliberate joke, but no less taken as truth by members of the public. Also possibly related to keraunography is the mistaken belief that the last image a dying person sees is burned into their retina, like a photograph taken at the time of death.\n\nAlthough to some degree science has still not fully explained all the behaviours of lightning, very few people currently accept keraunography as truth. It is evident that lightning strikes do indeed produce burn marks, and like any basically random shape (clouds, birthmarks, inkblots, etc.) it is human nature to see shapes in them. The lightning often leaves skin marks in characteristic Lichtenberg figures, sometimes called \"lightning flowers\"; they may persist for hours or days, and are a useful indicator for medical examiners when trying to determine the cause of death. Although humans being struck by lightning is of course rare, it is nonetheless possible that over a wide period of time, certain cases of burn marks would exist which could be said to resemble objects nearby the point of the lightning strike. However, these cases are almost certainly the product of coincidence rather than evidence of any photographic property of lightning. No supposed case of keraunography has been investigated by modern science, and unless further evidence is presented, it remains a strange object of 19th-century British folklore.\n\n"}

Letzer; 11 July 1958) is an English former child actor who starred in a number of British and European films in the 1960s and 1970s. In 1968 he played the title role in the film \"Oliver!\", a musical version of the Charles Dickens' novel \"Oliver Twist\". Lester also made several appearances in a number of British television series. In 1977, after appearing in the all-star international action adventure film \"The Prince and the Pauper\", he retired from acting. In the 1980s, he trained as an osteopath specialising in sport injuries.\n\nMark Lester was born in the city of Oxford, Oxfordshire, in southern England, to actress Rita Keene Lester and actor and producer Michael Lester (originally Michael Boris Letzer). His father is Jewish and his mother Anglican. Lester was educated at three independent schools: at Corona Theatre School in Ravenscourt Park in West London, followed by Tower House School, a boys' preparatory school near Richmond Park (also in West London), and at Halliford School in Shepperton in Surrey.\n\nLester initially had supporting roles in several British television series, including \"The Human Jungle\" and \"Danger Man\". In 1964, at the age of six, Lester was cast in Robert Dhéry's film \"Allez France!\" (1964) (English title \"The Counterfeit Constable\") with Diana Dors (who appeared in the 1968 film version of \"Oliver Twist\"). \n\nHe also appeared in \"\" (1965), played a small part as the second schoolboy in \"Fahrenheit 451\" (1966) and had a larger role in \"Our Mother's House\" (1967).\n\nIn 1967, at the age of eight, Lester was cast in the title role in the film version of Lionel Bart's musical \"Oliver!\". The multiple Academy Award-winning adaptation of Charles Dickens' novel co-starred Jack Wild, Ron Moody, Harry Secombe, Shani Wallis and Oliver Reed and was directed by Carol Reed. Since Lester could not sing, his singing was dubbed by Kathe Green, daughter of the film's music arranger Johnny Green. \n\nLester received critical acclaim for his portrayal of a dysfunctional and withdrawn only child in \"Run Wild, Run Free\" (1969), starring opposite John Mills, released by Columbia who financed \"Oliver!\". He played a disturbed child in the first regular episode of \"Then Came Bronson\" (\"The Runner\") and also guest starred on \"The Ghost & Mrs. Muir\". Columbia wanted to sign him to a long term contract but Lester's parents refused.\n\nLester had leading roles in \"Eyewitness\" (1970), a British thriller with Susan George shot on Malta; \"The Boy Who Stole the Elephant\" (1970), a TV movie for Disney; and the horror film \"Whoever Slew Auntie Roo?\" (1971), with Shelley Winters.\n\nHe was reunited with Wild in \"Melody\" (1971), which depicted schoolchildren in love, based on a script by Alan Parker. Tracy Hyde played the role of Melody in the film, which used music from the Bee Gees and Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young.\n\nLester starred in a film version of \"Black Beauty\" (1971). He was announced for a version of \"Treasure Island\" but it was never made.\nAfter this period, his acting roles in the UK would begin to wane. This coincided with a decline in the British film industry.\n\nLester remained in demand for films outside England: \"What the Peeper Saw\" (1972) with Britt Ekland; \"Senza ragione\" (1973), in Italy with Franco Nero; \"Little Adventurer\" (1973), a Japanese film; \"Scalawag\" (1973), a pirate film with Kirk Douglas shot in Yugoslavia; the costume drama \"La Prima volta sull'erba\" (English title \"The First Time on the Grass\", 1974), which was nominated for the Golden Bear prize at the 25th Berlin International Film Festival.\n\nLester wrapped up his film career playing the dual role as Edward VI of England and Tom Canty in the all-star film \"The Prince and the Pauper\" (US title: \"Crossed Swords\") starring Raquel Welch, Charlton Heston, Rex Harrison, George C. Scott, and Oliver Reed, who had played Bill Sikes in \"Oliver!\". \n\nAfter this he said \"I bought myself a Ferrari and set off through Europe for 18 months.\"\n\nAt the age of 18 Lester had access to some of his earnings from his films. He bought a Ferrari and a house in Belgravia and went to parties, nightclubs and restaurants, often paying for friends, and taking drugs. After the poor reception of \"The Prince and the Pauper\", Lester gave up acting at the age of 19. In his twenties he became a karate black belt; through this he grew interested in sports injuries, and from there osteopathy. At the age of 28 he took his A-Levels, passing Chemistry and Biology. He became an osteopath, studying at the British School of Osteopathy, and in 1993, Lester opened the Carlton Clinic, an acupuncture clinic in Cheltenham.\n\nHe is a patron of the theatre charity The Music Hall Guild of Great Britain and America.\n\nLester has four children with his first wife, Jane, whom he married in January 1993 and divorced in 2005. In 2006, he married his second wife, a psychiatric nurse.\n\nLester was a close friend of Michael Jackson and is godfather to Jackson's three children. In August 2009, after Jackson's death, Lester gave an interview to the British tabloid newspaper \"News of the World\" in which he claimed that he could be the biological father of Paris, the late singer's daughter. Lester claimed to have been a sperm donor for Jackson in 1996, and announced that he was willing to take a paternity test to determine whether he was the father. Brian Oxman, former lawyer for the Jackson family, rejected the claim in a television interview, stating, “The thing I always heard from Michael was that Michael was the father of these children, and I believe Michael.\" In 2019, Lester stated that he was one of twenty sperm donors for Jackson.\n\n"}
{"id": "1792890", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1792890", "title": "Failure to thrive", "text": "Failure to thrive\n\nFailure to thrive (FTT) indicates insufficient weight gain or inappropriate weight loss in pediatric patients unless the term is more precisely defined. In children, it is usually defined in terms of weight, and can be evaluated either by a low weight for the child's age, or by a low rate of increase in the weight.\n\nThe term \"failure to thrive\" has been used vaguely and in different contexts to refer to different issues in pediatric growth. It is most commonly used to describe a failure to gain weight, but some providers have also used it to describe a failure to grow, or a failure to grow and to gain weight. As used by pediatricians, it covers poor physical growth of any cause. The term has been used in different ways, and different objective standards have been defined. FTT is suggested by a fall in one or more weight centile spaces on a World Health Organization (WHO) growth chart depending on birth weight or when weight is below the 2nd percentile of weight for age irrespective of birth weight. In children whose birth weight was between the 9th and 91st percentile FTT is indicated by a drop across 2 or more centile spaces. Weight loss after birth is normal and most babies return to their birth weight by three weeks of age. Clinical assessment for FTT is recommended for babies who lose more than 10% of their birth weight or do not return to their birth weight after three weeks. Failure to thrive is not a disease, but a sign of inadequate nutrition. \n\nIn veterinary medicine it is also referred to as ill-thrift.\n\nFailure to thrive occurs in children whose nutritional intake is insufficient for supporting normal growth and weight gain. Failure to thrive typically presents before two years of age, when growth rates are highest. Parents may express concern about picky eating habits, poor weight gain, or smaller size compared relative to peers of similar age. Physicians often identify failure to thrive during routine office visits, when a child's growth parameters are not tracking appropriately on growth curves. Physicians look for many signs on physical exam that can indicate a potential cause of FTT. For example, findings such as scaling skin, spoon-shaped nails, cheilosis and neuropathy may indicate potential vitamin and mineral deficiencies. Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) has also been associated with FTT, and can present with characteristic findings including microcephaly, short palpebral fissures, a smooth philtrum and a thin vermillion border. Malabsorption, due to disorders like Crohn's disease and cystic fibrosis, can present with abdominal distention and hyperactive bowel sounds. It is also important to differentiate stunting from wasting, as they can indicate different causes of FTT. \"Wasting\" refers to a deceleration in stature more than 2 standard deviations from median weight-for-height, whereas \"stunting\" is a drop of more than 2 standard deviations from the median height-for-age. The characteristic pattern seen with children with inadequate nutritional intake is an initial deceleration in weight gain, followed several weeks to months later by a deceleration in stature, and finally a deceleration in head circumference. A decrease in length with a proportional drop in weight can be related to long-standing nutritional factors as well as genetic or endocrine causes. Head circumference, as well, can be an indicator for the etiology of FTT. If head circumference is affected initially in addition to weight or length, other factors are more likely causes than inadequate intake. Some of these include intrauterine infection, teratogens, and some congenital syndromes.\n\nTraditionally, causes of FTT have been divided into endogenous and exogenous causes. These causes can be largely grouped into three categories: inadequate caloric intake, malabsorption/caloric retention defect, and increased metabolic demands. Initial investigation should consider prenatal history, postnatal history, past medical history, feeding history to assess overall caloric intake, developmental history, family history, and psychosocial history.\n\n\n\n\n\nFTT may be evaluated through a multifaceted process, beginning with a patient history that notably includes diet history, which is a key element for identifying potential causes of FTT. Next, a complete physical examination may be done, with special attention being paid to identifying possible organic sources of FTT. This could include looking for dysmorphic features, abnormal breathing sounds, and signs of specific vitamin and mineral deficiencies. The physical exam may also reveal signs of possible child neglect or abuse. Based on the information gained from the history and physical examination, a workup can then be conducted, in which possible sources of FTT can be further probed, through blood work, X-rays, or other tests. Laboratory workup should be directed by concerning history and physical examination findings, as it is estimated that the usefulness of laboratory investigations for children with failure to thrive is 1.4%. Initial bloodwork should be based on the clinical picture of the child. Common bloodwork should include a CBC with differential, a complete metabolic panel to look for electrolyte derangements, a thyroid function test, and a urinalysis. If indicated, anti-TTG IgA antibodies can be used to assess for Celiac's disease, and a sweat chloride test is used to screen for cystic fibrosis. If no cause is discovered, a stool examination could be indicated to look for fat or reducing substances. C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) can also be used look for signs of inflammation.\n\nInfants and children who have had unpleasant eating experiences (e.g. acid reflux or food intolerance) may be reluctant to eat their meals. Additionally, force feeding an infant or child can discourage proper self-feeding practices and in-turn cause undue stress on both the child and their parents. Psychosocial interventions can be targeted at encouraging the child to feed themselves during meals. Also, making mealtimes a positive, enjoyable experience through the use of positive reinforcement may improve eating habits in children who present with FTT. If behavioral issues persist and are affecting nutritional habits in children with FTT it is recommended that the child see a psychologist. If an underlying condition, such as inflammatory bowel disease, is identified as the cause of the child's failure to thrive then treatment is directed towards the underlying condition. Special care should be taken to avoid refeeding syndrome when initiating feeds in a malnourished patient. Refeeding syndrome is caused by a shift in fluid and electrolytes in a malnourished person as they receive artificial refeeding. It is potentially fatal, and can occur whether receiving enteral or parenteral nutrition. The most serious and common electrolyte abnormality is hypophosphatemia, although sodium abnormalities are common as well. It can also cause changes in glucose, protein, and fat metabolism. Incidence of refeeding syndrome is high, with one prospective cohort study showing 34% of ICU experienced hypophosphatemia soon after feeding was restarted.\n\nChildren with failure to thrive are at an increased risk for long-term growth, cognitive, and behavioral complications. Studies have shown that children with failure to thrive during infancy were shorter and lower weight at school-age than their peers. Failure to thrive may also result in children not achieving their growth potential, as estimated by mid-parental height. Longitudinal studies have also demonstrated lower IQs (3–5 points) and poorer arithmetic performance in children with a history failure to thrive, compared to peers receiving adequate nutrition as infants and toddlers. Early intervention and restoration of adequate nutrition has been shown to reduce the likelihood of long-term sequelae, however, studies have shown that failure to thrive may cause persistent behavioral problems, despite appropriate treatment.\n\nFailure to thrive is a common presenting problem in the pediatric population. Failure to thrive is very prevalent in the United States, representing 5–10% of children seen as outpatients by primary care physicians. Failure to thrive is more prevalent in children of lower socioeconomic status and is associated with lower parental education levels. Failure to thrive accounts for 3–5% of all hospital admissions for children under two years of age. Retrospective studies suggest that males are slightly more likely than females to be admitted to the hospital for failure to thrive (53.2% vs. 46.7%).\n\nFTT was first introduced in the early 20th century to describe poor growth in orphan children but became associated with negative implications (such as maternal deprivation) that often incorrectly explained the underlying issues. Throughout the 20th century, FTT was expanded to include many different issues related to poor growth, which made it broadly applicable but non-specific. The current conceptualization of FTT acknowledges the complexity of faltering growth in children and has shed many of the negative stereotypes that plagued previous definitions.\n\n"}

Wallace, Mason Wiley, and Birnbach. It discusses an aspect of North American culture described as \"prepdom\". In addition to insights on prep school and university life at socially acceptable schools, it illuminates many aspects of the conservative upper middle class, old money WASP society. Topics range from appropriate clothing for social events to choosing the correct college and major.\n\nThe book addresses \"preppy\" life from birth to old age, lending understanding to the cultural aspects of \"preppy\" life. In general, elementary and secondary school, college, and the young adult years receive the most attention. Coverage lessens during the book's latter chapters. The book was first published in 1980 by Workman Publishing.\n\n\"The Official Preppy Handbook\" explains and satirizes what it takes to be a preppy person in the 1980s, parodying the lifestyle of the WASP elite. Birnbach reveals through an ironic tone where preps go to school, where they summer, what brands they wear, and how they decorate their homes. Birnbach divides \"The Official Preppy Handbook\" into 7 sections, each devoted to a different period of the preppy lifestyle. \nThe \"Handbook\" begins by caricaturizing the childhood of a preppy person in 1980. Lisa Birnbach satirizes a prep’s ideal family lifestyle, and humorously advises readers how to pick, interview, and gain acceptance into a prep school. The book then wittily discusses “the best years of your life”- a prep’s college years. With tongue in cheek, Birnbach elucidates which college courses to take, how to design one’s dorm room, and how to party at college. \nIn Chapters 5 and 6, the book explains the prep adult life as first a “young executive”, and later as a retired adult in “the Country Club Years”. Birnbach jokingly educates readers on navigating a cocktail party, networking, and vacationing.\nThe Official Preppy Handbook also teaches readers how to dress preppy. In chapter 4, Birnbach emphasizes the importance of appearing effortless, preppy and casual, writing, “socks are frequently not worn on sporting occasions or on social occasions for that matter. This provides a year round beachside look that is so desirable that comfort may be thrown aside”. By teaching readers on where to shop, what to wear, and “the merits of pink and green”, Birnbach makes preppy culture attainable to anyone – contrary to the popular belief that one needs to be born into a preppy lifestyle, she makes prepdom something anyone can cultivate.\nThe book's reflections on young urban professional culture inspired Arthur Cinader, the founder of the J. Crew clothing line. Cinader hoped to capitalize on the book's success.\n\nThe book also represented a resurgence of interest in preppy culture that aided the growth of retailer L.L. Bean, which the book describes as \"nothing less than Prep mecca.\" The book's exposé of university life and the drug and sex culture at various schools had a significant impact on public thought about those schools. The book spawned many other \"official\" handbooks for other American subcultures.\n\nThe \"Handbook\" exposed preppy culture to the masses, and helped to democratize the preppy subculture. Prior to the book, primarily only wealthy WASP elites adopted the preppy subculture. From the 1920s, WASPs dominated American universities, and preppy fashion was traditionally worn on university campuses. However, as universities became less exclusive as a result of economic and cultural shifts, preppiness as a subculture became less exclusive. Preppy fashion adopted new nuances, and preppy culture has become more inclusive. By writing \"The Official Preppy Handbook\", Lisa Birnbach helps to further democratize preppy fashion and culture. Birnbach explains in her introduction that the handbook is not intended as an exclusive text describing preppiness as subculture reserved for “an elite minority lucky enough to attend prestigious private schools”. Rather, the \"Handbook\" was written as a guidepost for the revival of the preppy style. It shared the secrets of the preppy code, making preppy seem “neat, attractive, and suddenly attainable”.\n\n\n"}

He remained there until successfully completing the course in the middle of 1950, at which point (following further gunnery training) he joined the 11th Hussars, then stationed with the British Army of the Rhine in Osnabrück, Germany. He served there and at Wesendorf for three years, commanding an armoured cavalry troop and being promoted Lieutenant in 1952 before the 11th was transferred to British Malaya (now Singapore and peninsular Malaysia) in 1953 to combat the increasingly powerful Communist insurgency there (see Malayan Emergency). During his service there, he served in a variety of roles, including intelligence, domestic pacification, and aide-de-camp to General Sir Charles Loewen, Commander-in-Chief Far East Land Forces. In 1956 he was promoted Captain and returned to Britain as adjutant to the Royal Gloucestershire Hussars, and served in a variety of roles thereafter until his 1961 retirement following contraction of jaundice in Omagh, Northern Ireland.\n\nAt this point, Newall entered the business world. He joined Arthur Guinness & Son and subsequently helped found Harp Lager. During this time he acceded to the peerage following his father's death in 1963, assuming his seat in the House of Lords as the Lord Newall. He remained with Guinness until 1966, taking a position as public relations spokesmen for Schweppes USA, Ltd, during which time he took a home in Connecticut. He returned to the UK in 1972 as managing director for Neilson McCarthy Public Relations, a position he held until 1975. He has continued to be involved in business since, and presently serves as Chairman of Code Circus Ltd, a web application development company.\n\nAt this time Lord Newall began to engage seriously in politics. He took his seat as a Conservative member of the Lords shortly following the return to power of Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson, and served as an opposition spokesman and whip from 1976, his tenure ending upon the victory and accession to power of Margaret Thatcher. He continued dual involvement in both business and politics through 1983, at which time he entered continental politics as a delegate to the Council of Europe and Western European Union. He continued sitting in the Lords, holding his seat for a total of thirty-seven years and introducing six private members’ bills — four of which were passed – as well as making hundreds of speeches. Since losing his seat on the expulsion of the hereditary peers in the House of Lords Act 1999 he has become Co-Chairman of the Hereditary Peerage Association. He has also acted as a representative of the British parliament and the WEU on several occasions: notably, during annual visits from 1986 through 1993 to Romania, which included private meetings with President Nicolae Ceauşescu and members of his government; and, more recently, in Azerbaijan.\n\nLord Newall also takes active interests in both sports and charity work. He served for twelve years as chairman of the British Greyhound Racing Board and president of the World Greyhound Racing Association. He has been president of SPANA (Society for the Protection of Animals Abroad), chairman of the Lord Barnby Charitable Association and of the British Moroccan Society, and a committee member for the Not Forgotten Association, which works to provide services for disabled British servicepeople. He is also honorary president of the Committee for Release of Tindouf Prisoners, which campaigns for the release of a great many of the longest-held prisoners in the world who are held in dreadful conditions in a concentration camp in Algeria.\n\nLord Newall has three children – daughter Miranda and sons Richard and David – nine grandchildren and two great-grandchildren with his wife Panna; they have been married since c. 1957. The garden of his home in Buckinghamshire, where he has resided since c. 1975, is open to the public.\n\n"}

Issued on 23 August 1775, it declared elements of the American colonies in a state of \"open and avowed rebellion\". It ordered officials of the empire \"to use their utmost endeavours to withstand and suppress such rebellion\". The 1775 proclamation of rebellion also encouraged subjects throughout the empire, including those in Britain, to report anyone carrying on \"traitorous correspondence\" with the rebels to be punished.\n\nThe Proclamation of Rebellion was drafted before Colonial Secretary Lord Dartmouth had been given a copy of the Second Continental Congress's Olive Branch Petition. Because King George III refused to receive the colonial petition, the Proclamation of Rebellion of 23 August 1775 effectively served as an answer to it.\n\nOn 27 October, North’s Cabinet expanded on the proclamation in the Speech from the Throne read by King George III at the opening of Parliament. The King's speech insisted that rebellion was being fomented by a \"desperate conspiracy\" of leaders whose claims of allegiance to the King were insincere; what the rebels really wanted, he said, was to create an \"independent empire\". The speech indicated that King George intended to deal with the crisis with armed force and was even considering \"friendly offers of foreign assistance\" to suppress the rebellion without pitting Briton against Briton. A pro-American minority of members within Parliament at the time warned the government was driving the colonists towards independence, something many colonial leaders insisted they did not desire.\n\nOn 6 December 1775, the Continental Congress issued a response to the Proclamation of Rebellion saying that, while they had always been loyal to the King, Parliament never had legitimate claim to authority over them, because the colonies were not democratically represented. Congress argued it was their duty to continue resisting Parliament's violations of the British Constitution, and that they would retaliate if any supporters in Great Britain were punished for \"favouring, aiding, or abetting the cause of American liberty\". America still hoped to avoid the \"calamities\" of a \"civil war\". The King's proclamation and the speech from the throne undermined moderates in Congress like John Dickinson, who had been arguing the King would find a way to resolve the dispute between colonies and Parliament. When it became clear George III was not inclined to act as a conciliator, attachment to empire was weakened, and a movement towards independence became a reality, culminating in America's Declaration of Independence on the 4th of July 1776.\n"}

It is her 17th studio album. The album won two Grammy Awards in 2001 for Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album and Best Instrumental Arrangement Accompanying Vocalist(s) for the song \"Both Sides, Now\" and a Juno Award for Vocal Jazz Album of the Year.\n\nThe album traces the progress of the modern relationship through Mitchell's orchestral renditions of classic jazz songs. Two of her own songs are included: \"A Case of You\" (1971) and \"Both Sides, Now\" (1969). The orchestra was arranged and conducted by Vince Mendoza.\n\nIn the liner notes, co-producer Larry Klein describes the album as \"a programmatic suite documenting a relationship from initial flirtation through optimistic consummation, metamorphosing into disillusionment, ironic despair, and finally resolving in the philosophical overview of acceptance and the probability of the cycle repeating itself\".\n\nA limited run of copies was released on February 8, 2000, in chocolate box packaging for Valentine's Day with several lithographs of Mitchell paintings. A jewel-case edition was released on March 20, 2000.\n\nOn tour, Mitchell performed the songs in the same sequence as the album, but she opened with the overture \"Nuages\", the first movement from \"Nocturnes\", an orchestral suite composed by Claude Debussy. \"Nuages\" is the French word for \"clouds\". Although the music sets a romantic mood, the use of this piece can be seen as a pun since \"Clouds\" is the name of the album on which the song \"Both Sides, Now\" made its appearance.\n"}

She was named for Commander William Price Williamson.\n\n\"Williamson\" was laid down on 27 March 1919 and launched on 16 October 1919 by the New York Shipbuilding Corporation, sponsored by Commander Williamson's widow, reclassified from Destroyer No. 244 to DD-244 in the Navy's fleet-wide assignment of alphanumeric hull numbers on 17 July 1920, and commissioned at the Philadelphia Navy Yard on 29 October 1920, Lieutenant Commander J. C. Cunningham in command.\n\nThe new destroyer was partially fitted out at Philadelphia into mid-December. After calibrating compasses in Delaware Bay, she received the remainder of her torpedo equipment at the Naval Torpedo Station, Newport, Rhode Island, before her fitting-out was completed at the New York Navy Yard.\n\n\"Williamson\" departed New York on 3 January 1921, bound for Europe and, after proceeding via Bermuda, arrived at Brest, France, in company with , on 16 February. She remained in French and British waters - calling at Cherbourg, France; and Gravesend and Portsmouth, England - into the spring before sailing for the eastern Mediterranean on 23 May.\n\nAssigned to U.S. Naval Forces in Turkish waters, \"Williamson\" arrived at Ineboli (now Inebolu), Turkey, on 22 June. There, she landed passengers and investigated local political conditions. At intervals in the ensuing months, \"Williamson\" made cruises from Constantinople to Odessa, Russia; Ghelenjik Bay; Novorossiysk; and Theodosia, before returning to Constantinople. She made another cruise to Odessa on 22 June 1922, delivering passengers and serving for a time as station ship there. On 2 July, the destroyer departed that port, bound for Constantinople, and transferred stores en route to her relief, . Six days later, \"Williamson\" headed for Gibraltar on her way to the United States and arrived back at Philadelphia on 27 July.\n\nAfter joining the Atlantic Fleet at Hampton Roads, on 6 September, \"Williamson\" shifted to New York for exercises and gunnery drills before she returned to Hampton Roads on 28 September for further exercises off the Virginia Capes in the Southern Drill Grounds. The destroyer operated off the eastern seaboard and at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, participating in war games and routine battle practices into early 1923. She returned to the New York area in November of that year, engaging, at intervals, in more rehearsals and gunnery drills. She departed New York on 6 May 1924 for maneuvers with the Scouting Fleet.\n\nAfter returning to New York for voyage repairs, the destroyer sailed for the Southern Drill Grounds on 19 May and arrived at Hampton Roads on the 28th to conduct depth charge practices before she returned to Newport, Rhode Island to take part in high speed target and torpedo practice at the Naval Torpedo Station. Later, \"Williamson\" participated in the search for a life boat missing from the steamer and made a cruise to Guantanamo Bay in company with , , and before returning to New York on 8 December.\n\nOver the next few years, \"Williamson\"s routine remained fairly standard for vessels of her type in active service. She cruised off the east coast of the United States and into the Caribbean, operating at intervals out of Guantanamo Bay during the annual Fleet concentrations there. However, there were breaks in this routine. Although \"Williamson\" operated primarily with Destroyer Squadrons, Scouting Force, she spent a brief period in January and February 1927 in the Special Service Squadron operating off the east coast of Nicaragua during an outbreak of revolutionary violence.\n\nAfter returning to the New York Navy Yard on 30 June 1927, \"Williamson\" trained Naval Reserve units off the eastern seaboard.\n\nIn 1928 it arrived in Havana harbour, as escort for USS \"Texas\" which had President Coolidge aboard as he was going to attend the Pan-American conference.\n\nOverhauled in the spring of 1928, the destroyer conducted additional reserve training cruises into 1930. Highlights in the ship's activities during that time were plane-guarding for in Guantanamo Bay in May 1930 and an extended reserve cruise that took her to Mayport, Florida, the Dry Tortugas, Key West, and Rebecca Shoals and Havana, Cuba.\n\n\"Williamson\" continued operating off the East Coast into mid-1931 as part of Destroyer Division 9, Flotilla 1, Scouting Force, before she shifted to San Diego, California, in March 1932, to operate briefly off the West Coast in the spring before returning to the East Coast. Upon reaching Norfolk, Virginia on 17 December 1932, \"Williamson\" was placed in rotating reserve. She subsequently sailed on 1 July 1933 bound, via the Panama Canal Zone, for the West Coast; arriving at San Diego on 21 July, the ship plane-guarded for during the summer.\n\n\"Williamson\" returned to the East Coast in the spring of the following year and, in July 1934, was one of the escorts for while President Franklin D. Roosevelt was embarked in that heavy cruiser. The destroyer subsequently proceeded to the Washington Navy Yard on 19 July 1934. There, she received an early sonar installation before sailing for the West Coast, returning to San Diego in November. She later underwent a rotating reserve overhaul in the summer of 1935 before joining Destroyer Squadron 3.\n\nThat summer, \"Williamson\" cruised to Alaska and, operating from Auke Bay, visited Portage Cove, Skagway, and Juneau, while patrolling coastal waters between 20 July and 31 July. Returning to San Diego on 9 August, \"Williamson\" conducted battle problems and local operations from that port with the other ships in her division into 1936.\n\nSailing for Balboa on 9 May 1936 to participate in Fleet Problem XVII in June, \"Williamson\" later underwent an overhaul at the Norfolk Navy Yard. She subsequently operated in the Gulf of Mexico and proceeded thence via Mobile, Alabama, and the Panama Canal to San Diego, where she arrived on 30 October 1936.\n\n\"Williamson\" conducted local operations out of that port into the winter and plane-guarded for in February 1937, before shifting to Hawaiian waters in the spring. Arriving at Pearl Harbor on 25 April, \"Williamson\" operated in the Hawaiian Islands with other units of the Destroyer Force of the United States Fleet until she returned to the West Coast in June. She operated off the West Coast for the remainder of 1937 and returned to Pearl Harbor in January 1938 for an overhaul in the navy yard there. She then took part in Fleet Problem XIX and, upon the conclusion of those exercises, returned to San Diego on 28 April 1938. She then shifted to the East Coast, arriving at Philadelphia on 2 June for conversion to a new and special type of auxiliary vessel.\n\nWith the increase in patrol plane forces in the Navy at that time, there arose in the Fleet's air wings an urgent need for tenders to support such aircraft. Accordingly, two flush-deck \"Clemson\"-class destroyers were chosen for conversion to light seaplane tenders: \"Williamson\" and .\n\nAs the conversion work proceeded into the autumn, all torpedo gear was removed from both ships, as were two of each ship's 4-inch guns, the 3-inch antiaircraft gun, their depth charge tracks, and the forward two boilers. Additional deckhouse space was added forward. Internal arrangements were changed to accommodate the personnel of a 12-plane patrol plane (VP) squadron and a supply of aviation gasoline. A boat derrick was added to the existing searchlight tower structure to handle a pair of 30-foot motor launches to be used for tending the planes in the water. The ship retained her forward and aftermost 4-inch guns, and four .50-caliber machine guns were added for antiaircraft defense.\n\nAs experimental vessels, \"Williamson\" and \"Childs\" — simultaneously reclassified on 1 July 1938 to AVP-15 and AVP-14, respectively — would soon prove successful. And, although more ships of their type were added to the Fleet prior to World War II, \"Williamson\" and \"Childs\" were the trailblazers.\n\nOn the last day of 1938, the conversion was complete. Painted pale gray and wearing the hull number \"15\" and displaying the red-centered blue and white star which indicated her aviation affiliation, \"Williamson\" departed Philadelphia on 3 January 1939, bound for Norfolk. There she took on board men and material from Patrol Wing (PatWing) 5 and soon headed for the Florida Keys where she provided tender services to VP-15 before returning to Philadelphia on 11 March 1939 for a post-shakedown availability.\n\nAfter shifting briefly to Newport, \"Williamson\" sailed for the West Coast on 21 April. Proceeding via San Diego, the light seaplane tender made port at Seattle, Washington, and reported to Commander, PatWing 4 for temporary duty. She operated off the California coast from 26 May to 23 August before shifting to Kodiak, Alaska, to service two patrol squadrons, VP-41 and VP-42.\n\nWhile \"Williamson\" was tending PBY Catalinas in the Pacific Northwest, war broke out in Europe on 1 September 1939, when Germany invaded Poland.\n\nThat autumn, \"Williamson\" operated out of Seattle and shifted to the Puget Sound Navy Yard on 5 February 1940 for an overhaul. She got underway for the Hawaiian Islands on 5 April and participated in Fleet Problem XXI before returning to Seattle on 21 May for a period of local operations and upkeep at Naval Air Station (NAS) Seattle. That summer, on 2 August 1940, she was again re-classified—this time as AVD-2.\n\nOn 4 March 1941, \"Williamson\" recovered three crew of a Douglas TBD-1 Devastator which ditched after engine failure, ~5 miles W of Mission Beach, California. The aviators successfully deployed a dinghy and were rescued after ~30 minutes by \"Williamson\". This rare TBD was rediscovered in 1996, and in February 2011, the National Museum of Naval Aviation at NAS Pensacola, Florida, announced plans to recover and restore the \"rara avis\".\n\nBefore the entry of the United States into the war in December 1941, \"Williamson\" spent the last of her peacetime months engaged in valuable survey work between Acapulco, Mexico, and the Aleutian Islands. In the summer of 1941, the seaplane tenders and planes of PatWing 4, under the direction of Rear Admiral John S. McCain — later to become the famed task force commander — conducted an intensive survey of possible advance seaplane base sites in the Aleutians and along the Alaskan peninsula work that paid dividends within a year.\n\n7 December 1941, found \"Williamson\" under overhaul at the Puget Sound Navy Yard. After temporary duty with Destroyer Squadron (DesRon) 82, she helped to escort into the Puget Sound Navy Yard on 30 December. The tender completed her repairs and took on stores in January 1942 and then shifted to the Aleutians to resume her duties as a tender for the PBY's of PatWing 4.\n\nDuring the early wartime period, the ship performed local escort missions and delivered war materials to Army and Navy bases at Cold Bay, Seattle, Dutch Harbor, and Kodiak. \"Williamson\" and her sister tenders also stocked emergency seaplane bases with vital necessities: buoys, gasoline, lubricating oil, ammunition, and bombs. Those temporary sites provided shelter for PBY's forced down by weather and proved valuable as alternate bases dispersed well enough to prevent a complete disaster if the Japanese attacked the established base sites. In addition, \"Williamson\" rescued and salvaged PBY's closed out of their havens by the \"notorious Alaskan fog.\"\n\nOn 20 May, prior to the Japanese invasion of the Aleutians, \"Williamson\" rescued Brigadier General Simon Bolivar Buckner from Kiska, when the general and his party were stranded there by 60-knot winds that prevented seaplanes from taking off after completing an inspection tour of the Near and Rat Island groups.\n\nEarly in June 1942, when the Japanese occupied Kiska and Attu in the Aleutians, as a diversion from the major Japanese thrust directed at the key atoll of Midway in the Central Pacific, \"Williamson\" lay at Umnak Pass, near the newly established Army airstrip there - the westernmost field in the Aleutian chain. Two Japanese planes from one of the carriers supporting the operation (either or ) strafed the ship and wounded six men. Fortunately, there were no fatalities.\n\n\"Williamson\", in company with , later set up an advanced seaplane base at Chernofski and supported the PBY squadron assigned the mission of bombing the Japanese troops on Kiska Island until Army planes could take over the task. On 23 June, after having established the advanced site, the destroyer-seaplane tender left the Aleutians and steamed to Seattle for badly needed repairs.\n\nAfter returning to Dutch Harbor in August, she proceeded to sea on the 25th to attempt the rescue and salvage of a PBY down at sea in extremely rough weather. During the operation, \"Williamson\" was attempting to take the damaged Catalina in tow when a wave threw the PBY against one of the tender's propeller guards. The shock of the collision dislodged a pair of depth charges from the plane's wing shackles, and the resultant explosion wounded 16 men and blew one man over the side into the water. Efficient damage control, however, managed to localize the flooding aft, where the most severe damage was located. All hands bailed out the flooded spaces by an old-fashioned, but effective, method - the \"bucket brigade.\"\n\nWhile returning to Dutch Harbor, \"Williamson\" was shadowed by a Japanese patrol plane but made port without further incident. There, Seabees reinforced the damaged hull with \"I\" beams taken from a dismantled hangar. This enabled \"Williamson\" to creep back to Seattle on one engine at nine knots via Kodiak, Yakutat, and the scenic Alaskan Inside Passage.\n\nBy the time \"Williamson\"s repairs had been completed, newer, more modern AVP's were entering the Fleet, and the need for \"Williamson's\" tending planes was lessening considerably. She was accordingly reclassified AVD-27 and, on 3 January 1943, was ordered to support the shakedown training of escort carriers. \"Williamson\" served as plane guard and escort for carriers operating in the Puget Sound and San Diego operating areas. Those carriers included , , , , , , , , , , , , and . During that time, \"Williamson\" picked 14 men from the water after accidental crashes.\n\nRelieved from that shakedown duty in the spring of 1943, \"Williamson\" supported the invasion and occupation of Kiska and Attu in April and May 1943. On 15 May 1943, four torpedo wakes passed close to the ship, her closest call of the campaign and, indeed, her last brush with the Japanese in the Aleutian theater.\n\nReturning to San Diego late in the spring of 1943, \"Williamson\" briefly trained with submarines and then resumed escorting and plane-guarding for carriers on their shakedown cruises. On 1 December 1943, \"Williamson\" was reclassified back to her original classification: DD-244.\n\nAfter repairs at the Mare Island Navy Yard in January 1944, \"Williamson\" sailed for the Hawaiian Islands on 24 January, arriving six days later. The destroyer departed Pearl Harbor on 7 February, bound for the South Pacific. She proceeded via American Samoa to Espiritu Santo and performed escort duties between Guadalcanal and Funafuti, in the Ellice Islands, until early April, when she joined Task Unit (TU) 34.6.4 for screening operations in the New Guinea area. Refueling areas included those between Truk, New Ireland, and the Admiralty Islands.\n\nUpon completion of that assignment, \"Williamson\" proceeded to Purvis Bay, Solomon Islands, where she reported to Commander, Group 3, 5th Amphibious Force (Rear Admiral Richard L. Conolly), on 7 May 1944. At that time, the erstwhile seaplane tender was again chosen for special duty.\n\nGear was installed for underway fueling of scout observation planes from battleships and cruisers to enable the planes to spot gunfire for their parent ships without having to be recovered by them. Rehearsals in the Guadalcanal area proved that \"Williamson\"s new rig was suitable for fueling OS2U Kingfisher and SOC Seagull scout planes. With her new equipment thus tested, \"Williamson\" departed for Kwajalein, the final staging point for the Marianas operation, on 1 June. Nine days later, on the 10th, the destroyer got underway for the first operational test of the underway refueling concept which had been developed by Rear Admiral Walden L. Ainsworth.\n\nUpon her arrival at Saipan on 14 June, \"Williamson\" reported for duty to Admiral Ainsworth (Commander,Bombardment and Gunfire Support Force) and commenced refueling scout planes. \"Williamson\"s service enabled the ships on the bombardment lines to conduct almost uninterrupted gunfire support for the landings then in progress. On the 16th, she took up her duties fueling the spotter planes of the ships bombarding Japanese positions on Guam.\n\n\"Williamson\" soon returned to Saipan, however, as the approach of a Japanese Fleet made a consolidation of American forces desirable. The ensuing Battle of the Philippine Sea resulted in the withdrawal of the enemy force and freed the Americans to resume operations in the Marianas. On 17 June, while conducting screening duties, \"Williamson\" rescued a Japanese merchant seaman from the water two days after his ship had been sunk. After giving him a bath, medical attention, and food, \"Williamson\" transferred the man to .\n\nThe destroyer departed Saipan on 25 June and arrived at Eniwetok on 3 July. Six days later, \"Williamson\" sailed once more for Guam and in ensuing days again operated as refueling unit for spotter planes during the invasion and occupation of Guam. Once the landings had been made, \"Williamson\" acted as a terminal vessel for mail and passenger seaplanes arriving from Eniwetok, until 16 August. During the Guam operation, \"Williamson\" had a brush with the Japanese when a shore battery near the town of Agat, on the west coast of the island, opened fire. However, as the ship's commanding officer reported, \"getting underway and opening the range solved this problem.\"\n\n\"Williamson\" departed Guam on 16 August and proceeded to Pearl Harbor, escorting a convoy. She was overhauled at the Pearl Harbor Navy Yard before she operated as plane guard and carrier escort for Carrier Division 11. From the autumn of 1944 until 8 January 1945, the destroyer provided escort and plane guard services for , \"Saratoga\", , \"Corregidor\", and . During that time, \"Williamson\" rescued seven men while on plane guard station.\n\nOn 10 January, \"Williamson\" joined the 5th Fleet and sortied from Pearl Harbor, bound for the Carolines. After upkeep at Ulithi, \"Williamson\" took part in rehearsal operations at Saipan and Tinian for the impending invasion of Iwo Jima the target in the island-hopping campaign.\n\nUpon completion of those practice exercises in the Marianas, the Iwo Jima-bound task forces headed for their objective. Again, as at Saipan and Guam, \"Williamson\" performed her unique services for the bombardment phase of the Iwo Jima operation. In addition, she rescued the survivors of two carrier planes which had ditched nearby; provided medical and damage control assistance to a badly damaged LCI; rescued an LCM that had drifted 20 miles from Iwo Jima; kept watch on a damaged PBM Mariner (carrying members of the press) until the arrival of a seaplane tender group; and transferred one of her own crew to for an emergency appendectomy.\n\nWith the completion of the bombardment phase on 26 February, \"Williamson\" headed for Saipan with a number of damaged landing craft. On some days making a \"speed of advance\" of only three knots to allow the landing craft to keep up, the destroyer ultimately reached her destination, where she parted company with the landing craft and proceeded independently to Ulithi where she prepared for the invasion of Okinawa.\n\nReaching Okinawa on 25 March, \"Williamson\" operated as an antisubmarine screening vessel and spotting plane refueling unit with Fire Support Group 1. On the 28th, the destroyer rescued a fighter pilot whose aircraft had been damaged by antiaircraft fire and forced to ditch nearby. Once the invasion forces went ashore on 1 April, \"Williamson\" joined the Seaplane Base Unit in Kerama Retto and refueled ship-based, patrol, and transport float and seaplanes, as well as furnished aviation gasoline to battleship and cruiser aviation units.\n\nAfter three weeks in the forward area, during which time frequent air raid alerts became the routine, \"Williamson\" departed the Ryūkyūs and returned to Guam. She acted as a plane guard and an escort for carriers training in the Marianas. During that period, she made one escort trip to Ulithi and one to Leyte and Samar and provided her services to , , , , \"Velio\", , , \"Makassar Strait\", and \"Casablanca\". While on plane guard station, she rescued three downed aviators.\n\nAfter operating in that capacity through the cessation of hostilities with Japan in mid-August 1945, \"Williamson\" headed via Pearl Harbor for the West Coast and arrived at San Diego on 25 September 1945. She transited the Panama Canal on 10 and 11 October and reached Philadelphia on the 16th. Decommissioned on 8 November 1945, the veteran destroyer was struck from the Navy List on 19 December 1945.\n\nSold through the Navy Disposal Agency on 17 October 1946, her hulk was acquired by the North American Smelting Company, and removed from Navy custody on 30 October 1946. She was scrapped shortly thereafter.\n\n\"Williamson\" earned four battle stars for her World War II service.\n\nAs of 2012, no other ship has been named \"Williamson\".\n"}

The sketch was originally broadcast as part of the television series and has subsequently been performed live by the group. It relies heavily on wordplay and dialogue, and has been used as an example of how language works.\n\nAfter the episode's end credits have scrolled, a BBC voiceover announces that there will be \"Five more minutes of \"Monty Python's Flying Circus.\"\" In the ensuing sketch, an unnamed man portrayed by Michael Palin approaches a receptionist (Rita Davies) and says he would like to have an argument. She directs him to a Mr Barnard (identified as Mr Vibrating in episode transcripts), who occupies an office down the hall. Palin initially enters the wrong office, in which a man played by Graham Chapman hurls angry insults at him before clarifying that his office is dedicated to \"abuse.\" Even after sending Palin on his way, Chapman calls him a \"stupid git.\"\n\nPalin enters the next office, which contains Mr Barnard/Vibrating, played by John Cleese. Palin asks if he is in the right office for an argument, to which Cleese responds that he has already told him he is. Palin disputes this, and the men begin an argumentative back-and-forth. Their exchange is a very shallow one, consisting mostly of petty and contradictory \"is/isn't\" responses, to the point that Palin feels he isn't getting what he paid for. They then argue over the very definition of an argument until Cleese rings a bell and announces that Palin's paid time has concluded.\n\nPalin is dissatisfied, and tries to argue with Cleese over whether he really got as much time as he paid for, but Cleese insists he is not allowed to argue unless Palin pays for another session. When Palin finally relents and pays more money for additional arguing time, Cleese continues to insist he hasn't paid, and another argument breaks out over that issue. Palin believes he has caught Cleese in a contradiction—arguing without being paid—but Cleese counters that he could be arguing in his spare time. Frustrated, Palin storms out of the room.\n\nThe original broadcast version features Palin exploring other rooms in the clinic; he enters a room marked \"Complaints\" hoping to lodge a complaint, only to find that it is a complaint \"clinic\" in which Eric Idle is complaining about his shoes. The next office contains Terry Jones offering \"being hit on the head lessons,\" which a series of policemen interrupt as being too silly.\n\nThe sketch parodies modern consumer culture, implying that anything can be purchased, even absurd things such as arguing, abuse, or being hit over the head.\nThe sketch was typical for Cleese's and Chapman's writing at the time, as it relied on verbal comedy. Python author Darl Larsen believes the sketch was influenced by music hall and radio comedy, particularly that of the Goons, and notes that there is little camera movement during the original television recording.\n\nOne line in the middle of the sketch, \"An argument is a connected series of statements intended to establish a definite proposition\" was taken almost verbatim from the \"Oxford English Dictionary\".\n\nThe sketch originally appeared in the 29th episode of the original television series, entitled \"The Money Programme\", and was released (in audio only) on the LP \"Monty Python's Previous Record\", on Charisma Records in 1972.\n\nThe sketch was subsequently performed live at the Hollywood Bowl in September 1980, which was filmed and released as \"Monty Python Live at the Hollywood Bowl\". The sketch features the discussion with the receptionist (played here by Carol Cleveland), the abuse from Chapman, and most of the argument between Cleese and Palin. It is then ended abruptly by the entrance of Terry Gilliam, on wires, singing \"I've Got Two Legs\". A further live performance occurred in 1989 at the Secret Policeman's Ball, where Cleveland's and Chapman's roles were replaced by Dawn French and Chris Langham. This performance was subsequently released on DVD. The sketch was performed again in July 2014 during \"Monty Python Live (Mostly)\", with Terry Jones filling in for Chapman's role and Gilliam reprising \"I've Got Two Legs\".\n\nThe sketch has been frequently used as an example of how not to argue, because, as Palin's character notes, it contains little more than ad hominem attacks and contradiction, and does not contribute to critical thinking. It has also been described as a \"classical case in point\" of dialogue where two parties are unwilling to co-operate, and as an example of flawed logic, since Palin is attempting to argue that Cleese is not arguing with him.\n\nThe text of the argument has been presented as a good example of the workings of English grammar, where sentences can be reduced to simple subject/verb pairs. It has been included as an example of analysing English in school textbooks. The sketch has become popular with philosophy students, who note that arguing is \"all we are good at\", and wonder about the intellectual exercise one could get from paying for a professional quality debate.\n\nThe Python programming language has an internal-only module called \"Argument Clinic\" to pre-process Python files.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1792950", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1792950", "title": "Second Bill of Rights", "text": "Second Bill of Rights\n\nThe Second Bill of Rights was proposed by United States President Franklin D. Roosevelt during his . In his address, Roosevelt suggested that the nation had come to recognise and should now implement, a second \"bill of rights\". Roosevelt argued that the \"political rights\" guaranteed by the Constitution and the Bill of Rights had \"proved inadequate to assure us equality in the pursuit of happiness\". His remedy was to declare an \"economic bill of rights\" to guarantee these specific rights:\n\nThese rights have come to be known as economic rights. Roosevelt stated that having such rights would guarantee American security and that the United States' place in the world depended upon how far the rights had been carried into practice. This safety has been described as a state of physical welfare, as well as \"economic security, social security, and moral security\" by American legal scholar Cass Sunstein. The implementation of these ideals into a global context has been viewed as a continuation of the war effort, in which the success of these proposed values within the U.S were vital to securing global peace.\n\nIn the runup to the Second World War, the United States had suffered through the Great Depression following the Wall Street Crash of 1929. Roosevelt's election at the end of 1932 was based on a commitment to reform the economy and society through a \"New Deal\" program. The first indication of a commitment to government guarantees of social and economic rights came in an address to the Commonwealth Club on September 23, 1932 during his campaign. The speech was written with Adolf A. Berle, a professor of corporate law at Columbia University. A key passage read: \n\nThroughout Roosevelt's presidency, he returned to the same theme continually over the course of the New Deal. Also in the Atlantic Charter, an international commitment was made as the Allies thought about how to \"win the peace\" following victory in the Second World War. The U.S' commitment to non-interventionism in World War II ending with the 1941 Lend-Lease act, and later Pearl Harbour attacks resulted in the mobilisation of the war state. The generous terms of the act, in conjunction with the economic growth of the U.S were key in allowing the U.S to establish new global order with the help of Allied powers in the aftermath of war. This motivation to establish a new global order provided the infrastructure for the implementation of an international standard of human rights, seen with the Second Bill of Rights and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Akira Iriye's proposition that the U.S desired to transform the post war Pacific after their own image is representative of the wider desire to raise global standards to that of the US, feeding into ideals of American Exceptionalism. The effect of wider democratisation and social reform is divulged upon in Francis Fukuyama's \"The End of History and the Last Man.\"\n\nDuring Roosevelt's January 11, 1944 message to the Congress on the State of the Union, he said the following: \n\nThe propositions made by Roosevelt have gone largely unfulfilled. An article featured in the Democratic Left academic journal titled \"Corporations Are Destroying Our Economy, Our Environment, and Our Children's Future\" provides insight onto how the significance of the bill is largely selective, and has been reduced through \"unbridled capitalism\". The commodification of education, health care and other areas fundamental to the realisation of Roosevelt's goals is described as being responsible for maintaining vast inequality pervasive within the U.S. This commodification could be representative of the prevalence of libertarian-ism as an ideology within the U.S. Prominent figures such as Friederich Hayek and Milton Friedman have become re-known for their aversion to increased government spending on social reform.\n\nRoosevelt presented the to the public on radio as a fireside chat from the White House: Today I sent my Annual Message to the Congress, as required by the Constitution. It has been my custom to deliver these Annual Messages in person, and they have been broadcast to the Nation. I intended to follow this same custom this year. But like a great many other people, I have had the \"flu\", and although I am practically recovered, my doctor simply would not let me leave the White House to go up to the Capitol. Only a few of the newspapers of the United States can print the Message in full, and I am anxious that the American people be given an opportunity to hear what I have recommended to the Congress for this very fateful year in our history — and the reasons for those recommendations. Here is what I said ...\n\nHe asked that newsreel cameras film the last portion of the address, concerning the Second Bill of Rights. This footage was believed lost until it was uncovered in 2008 in South Carolina by Michael Moore while researching the film \"\". The footage shows Roosevelt's Second Bill of Rights address in its entirety as well as a shot of the eight rights printed on a sheet of paper.\n\n\n\n"}

After World War I he served as the president of the St. John's Clinical Society and the Newfoundland Medical Association.\n\nCluny Macpherson was born in St. John's, Newfoundland to Campbell Macpherson and Emma Duder. He had a brother, Harold.\n\nMacpherson received his early education at Methodist College and at the McGill University Faculty of Medicine from 1897–1901 where he earned his degree in Medicine. He also volunteered with the Royal National Mission to Deep Sea Fishermen, which later became known as the Grenfell Mission. Macpherson began his medical career at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh. In 1902 he returned to Newfoundland joining the Labrador Mission begun by Dr. Wilfred Grenfell and ran the hospital in Battle Harbour. Remaining there until 1904. He also served as a special constable and justice of the peace. Macpheron later became a director of the Newfoundland and the International Grenfell Associations. He later helped develop the Seamen's Institute (later called the King George V Institute), another Grenfell project. Returning to St. John's, Macpherson opened a private practice, and eventually became the leading practitioner in Newfoundland.\n\nMacpherson started the first St. John Ambulance Brigade in Newfoundland after working with the St. John Ambulance Association. The Brigade had three divisions in St. John's. When World War I broke out, members enlisted in the Newfoundland Regiment. Macpherson organized the volunteers into an Ambulance Unit, which continued throughout the war.\n\nAt the outset of World War I in August 1914 Macpherson was commissioned as a captain and Principal Medical Officer of the newly formed 1st Newfoundland Regiment. He served as the principal medical officer for the St. John Ambulance Brigade of the first Newfoundland Regiment during World War I. He saw on active service in Belgium and France, at Salonika and later at Gallipoli, and in Egypt. His work was mentioned in despatches twice.\n\nThe German army used poison gas for the first time against Allied troops at the Second Battle of Ypres, Belgium on April 22, 1915. As an immediate response, cotton wool wrapped in muslin was issued to the troops by 1 May and followed by the Black Veil Respirator, a cotton pad soaked in an absorbent solution which was secured over the mouth using black cotton veiling. Seeking to improve on the Black Veil respirator, Macpherson created a mask made of chemical absorbing fabric and which fitted over the entire head. A canvas hood treated with chlorine-absorbing chemicals, and fitted with a transparent mica eyepiece. Macpherson presented his idea to the War Office Anti-Gas Department on May 10, 1915, with prototypes being developed soon after. The design was adopted by the British Army and introduced as the British Smoke Hood in June 1915; Macpherson was appointed to the War Office Committee for Protection against Poisonous Gases. More elaborate sorbent compounds were added later to further iterations of his helmet (PH helmet), to defeat other respiratory poison gases used such as phosgene, diphosgene and chloropicrin.\n\nAfter suffering a war injury in Egypt, Macpherson returned to Newfoundland in October 1916. He served as the Director of Medical Services for the Militia. For his wartime services, he was made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George in 1918. He retired with the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel.\n\nFollowing the war Macpherson had various medical roles including president of the St. John's Clinical Society and the Newfoundland Medical Association. In 1937 he was vice-president of the Newfoundland St. John Ambulance Association in 1937, and later became assistant commissioner of the St. John Ambulance Brigade overseas. Macpherson was also the Registrar of the Newfoundland Medical Board.\n\nDuring World War II he served in ship convoys in the North Atlantic. He was appointed Honorary Colonel of the 1st Company, Royal Canadian Army Medical Corps in 1957, and was awarded the Canadian Forces Decoration in 1964.\n\nAt various times he was chairman of the Lunacy Commissioners, president of the St John Ambulance Council, and vice-president of the Newfoundland Division of the Canadian Red Cross Society. He was a member of the Medical Council of Canada from 1950 and its president in 1954–55. He was appointed a Knight of the British Order of St John of Jerusalem in 1913 and a Knight of Justice in 1955. He was chairman of the Clan Macpherson Association and president of its Canadian branch.\n\nMacpherson married Eleanora Barbara Macleod Thompson, daughter of William Macleod Thompson, of Northumberland County, Ontario on September 16, 1902. They had two children, Emma Allison (1903–1971) and Campbell Leonard (1907–1973). Eleanora was later created OBE and became a Dame of the Order of St John. She died in 1964. Their son, Campbell Leonard Macpherson (1907 – 1973), became the third Lieutenant Governor of Newfoundland in 1957, and in 1965 served as president of the Macpherson family business, Royal Stores, Ltd., after the death of his uncle, Harold Macpherson (1884-1963), a breeder and world authority on Newfoundland dogs. Cluny Macpherson lived in St. John's until his death on November 16, 1966.\n\nThe family home at 65 Rennie's Mill Road, where he served as secretary, treasurer and registrar for the Newfoundland Medical Society now has historic designation.\n\n\n"}

In 1980, the Reagan coalition was possible because of Democrat Jimmy Carter's losses in most social-economic groups. In 1984, Reagan confirmed his support by winning nearly 60% of the popular vote and carried 49 of the 50 states.\n\nThe Reagan Democrats were Democrats before the Reagan years and afterwards, but who voted for Reagan in 1980 and 1984 and for George H. W. Bush in 1988, producing their landslide victories. They were mostly white socially conservative blue-collar workers who lived in the Northeast and were attracted to Reagan's social conservatism on issues such as abortion and to his hawkish foreign policy. They did not continue to vote Republican in 1992 or 1996, so the term fell into disuse except as a reference to the 1980s. The term is not generally used to describe the Southern whites who permanently changed party affiliation from Democrat to Republican during the Reagan administration and they have largely remained Republican to this day.\n\nStan Greenberg, a Democratic pollster, analyzed white, largely unionized auto workers in suburban Macomb County, Michigan, just north of Detroit. The county voted 63% for John F. Kennedy in 1960 and 66% for Reagan in 1984. He concluded that Reagan Democrats no longer saw Democrats as champions of their middle class aspirations, but instead saw it as being a party working primarily for the benefit of others, especially African Americans and the very poor. Democrat Bill Clinton targeted the Reagan Democrats with considerable success in 1992 and 1996.\n\n\n"}

Copulas are used to describe the dependence between random variables. Their name comes from the Latin for \"link\" or \"tie\", similar but unrelated to grammatical copulas in linguistics. Copulas have been used widely in quantitative finance to model and minimize tail risk and portfolio-optimization applications.\n\nSklar's theorem states that any multivariate joint distribution can be written in terms of univariate marginal distribution functions and a copula which describes the dependence structure between the variables.\n\nCopulas are popular in high-dimensional statistical applications as they allow one to easily model and estimate the distribution of random vectors by estimating marginals and copulae separately. There are many parametric copula families available, which usually have parameters that control the strength of dependence. Some popular parametric copula models are outlined below.\n\nTwo-dimensional copulas are known in some other areas of mathematics under the name \"permutons\" and \"doubly-stochastic measures\".\n\nConsider a random vector formula_1. Suppose its marginals are continuous, i.e. the marginal CDFs formula_2 are continuous functions. By applying the probability integral transform to each component, the random vector\nhas marginals that are uniformly distributed on the interval [0, 1].\n\nThe copula of formula_1 is defined as the joint cumulative distribution function of formula_5:\n\nThe copula \"C\" contains all information on the dependence structure between the components of formula_1 whereas the marginal cumulative distribution functions formula_8 contain all information on the marginal distributions.\n\nThe importance of the above is that the reverse of these steps can be used to generate pseudo-random samples from general classes of multivariate probability distributions. That is, given a procedure to generate a sample formula_5 from the copula distribution, the required sample can be constructed as\nThe inverses formula_11 are unproblematic as the formula_8 were assumed to be continuous. The above formula for the copula function can be rewritten to correspond to this as:\n\nIn probabilistic terms, formula_14 is a \"d\"-dimensional copula if \"C\" is a joint cumulative distribution function of a \"d\"-dimensional random vector on the unit cube formula_15 with uniform marginals.\n\nIn analytic terms, formula_14 is a \"d\"-dimensional copula if\n\nFor instance, in the bivariate case, formula_22 is a bivariate copula if formula_23, formula_24 and formula_25 for all formula_26 and formula_27.\n\nSklar's theorem, named after Abe Sklar, provides the theoretical foundation for the application of copulas. Sklar's theorem states that every multivariate cumulative distribution function\nof a random vector formula_1 can be expressed in terms of its marginals formula_30 and\na copula formula_31. Indeed:\n\nIn case that the multivariate distribution has a density formula_33, and this is available, it holds further that\nwhere formula_35 is the density of the copula.\n\nThe theorem also states that, given formula_36, the copula is unique on formula_37, which is the cartesian product of the ranges of the marginal cdf's. This implies that the copula is unique if the marginals formula_8 are continuous.\n\nThe converse is also true: given a copula formula_39 and marginals formula_40 then formula_41 defines a \"d\"-dimensional cumulative distribution function with marginal distributions formula_40.\n\nCopulas mainly work when time series are stationary and continuous. Thus, a very important pre-processing step is to check for the auto-correlation, trend and seasonality within time series.\n\nWhen time series are auto-correlated, they may generate a non existence dependence between sets of variables and result in incorrect Copula dependence structure.\n\nThe Fréchet–Hoeffding Theorem (after Maurice René Fréchet and Wassily Hoeffding) states that for any Copula formula_14 and any formula_44 the following bounds hold:\nThe function is called lower Fréchet–Hoeffding bound and is defined as\nThe function is called upper Fréchet–Hoeffding bound and is defined as\n\nThe upper bound is sharp: is always a copula, it corresponds to comonotone random variables.\n\nThe lower bound is point-wise sharp, in the sense that for fixed u, there is a copula formula_48 such that formula_49. However, is a copula only in two dimensions, in which case it corresponds to countermonotonic random variables.\n\nIn two dimensions, i.e. the bivariate case, the Fréchet–Hoeffding Theorem states\n\nSeveral families of copulas have been described.\n\nThe Gaussian copula is a distribution over the unit cube formula_15. It is constructed from a multivariate normal distribution over formula_52 by using the probability integral transform.\n\nFor a given correlation matrix formula_53, the Gaussian copula with parameter matrix formula_54 can be written as\nwhere formula_56 is the inverse cumulative distribution function of a standard normal and formula_57 is the joint cumulative distribution function of a multivariate normal distribution with mean vector zero and covariance matrix equal to the correlation matrix formula_54. While there is no simple analytical formula for the copula function, formula_59, it can be upper or lower bounded, and approximated using numerical integration. The density can be written as\nwhere formula_61 is the identity matrix.\n\nArchimedean copulas are an associative class of copulas. Most common Archimedean copulas admit an explicit formula, something not possible for instance for the Gaussian copula.\nIn practice, Archimedean copulas are popular because they allow modeling dependence in arbitrarily high dimensions with only one parameter, governing the strength of dependence.\n\nA copula C is called Archimedean if it admits the representation\n\nwhere formula_63 is a continuous, strictly decreasing and convex function such that formula_64. formula_65 is a parameter within some parameter space formula_66. formula_67 is the so-called generator function and formula_68 is its pseudo-inverse defined by\n\nMoreover, the above formula for C yields a copula for formula_70 if and only if formula_70 is d-monotone on formula_72.\nThat is, if it is formula_73 times differentiable and the derivatives satisfy\n\nfor all formula_75 and formula_76 and formula_77 is nonincreasing and convex.\n\nThe following tables highlight the most prominent bivariate Archimedean copulas, with their corresponding generator. [There is one problem with each of these two tables. In specific terms, formula_78 and formula_79 remain undefined in the first and second table, respectively. They are neither defined in the main text of this page. Please define the variables.] Not all of them are completely monotone, i.e. \"d\"-monotone for all formula_80 or \"d\"-monotone for certain formula_81 only.\n\nIn statistical applications, many problems can be formulated in the following way. One is interested in the expectation of a response function formula_82 applied to some random vector formula_83. If we denote the cdf of this random vector with formula_36, the quantity of interest can thus be written as\n\nIf formula_36 is given by a copula model, i.e.,\n\nthis expectation can be rewritten as\n\nIn case the copula C is absolutely continuous, i.e. C has a density c, this equation can be written as\n\nand if each marginal distribution has the density formula_90 it holds further that\n\nIf copula and margins are known (or if they have been estimated), this expectation can be approximated through the following Monte Carlo algorithm:\n\nWhen studying multivariate data, one might want to investigate the underlying copula. Suppose we have observations\nfrom a random vector formula_1 with continuous margins. The corresponding \"true\" copula observations would be\nHowever, the marginal distribution functions formula_8 are usually not known. Therefore, one can construct pseudo copula observations by using the empirical distribution functions\ninstead. Then, the pseudo copula observations are defined as\nThe corresponding empirical copula is then defined as\nThe components of the pseudo copula samples can also be written as formula_104, where formula_105 is the rank of the observation formula_106:\nTherefore, the empirical copula can be seen as the empirical distribution of the rank transformed data.\n\nIn quantitative finance copulas are applied to risk management, to portfolio management and optimization, and to derivatives pricing.\n\nFor the former, copulas are used to perform stress-tests and robustness checks that are especially important during \"downside/crisis/panic regimes\" where extreme downside events may occur (e.g., the global financial crisis of 2007–2008). The formula was also adapted for financial markets and was used to estimate the probability distribution of losses on pools of loans or bonds.\n\nDuring a downside regime, a large number of investors who have held positions in riskier assets such as equities or real estate may seek refuge in 'safer' investments such as cash or bonds. This is also known as a flight-to-quality effect and investors tend to exit their positions in riskier assets in large numbers in a short period of time. As a result, during downside regimes, correlations across equities are greater on the downside as opposed to the upside and this may have disastrous effects on the economy. For example, anecdotally, we often read financial news headlines reporting the loss of hundreds of millions of dollars on the stock exchange in a single day; however, we rarely read reports of positive stock market gains of the same magnitude and in the same short time frame.\n\nCopulas aid in analyzing the effects of downside regimes by allowing the modelling of the marginals and dependence structure of a multivariate probability model separately. For example, consider the stock exchange as a market consisting of a large number of traders each operating with his/her own strategies to maximize profits. The individualistic behaviour of each trader can be described by modelling the marginals. However, as all traders operate on the same exchange, each trader's actions have an interaction effect with other traders'. This interaction effect can be described by modelling the dependence structure. Therefore, copulas allow us to analyse the interaction effects which are of particular interest during downside regimes as investors tend to herd their trading behaviour and decisions. (See also agent-based computational economics, where price is treated as an emergent phenomenon, resulting from the interaction of the various market participants, or agents.)\n\nThe users of the formula have been criticized for creating \"evaluation cultures\" that continued to use simple copulæ despite the simple versions being acknowledged as inadequate for that purpose. Thus, previously, scalable copula models for large dimensions only allowed the modelling of elliptical dependence structures (i.e., Gaussian and Student-t copulas) that do not allow for correlation asymmetries where correlations differ on the upside or downside regimes. However, the recent development of vine copulas (also known as pair copulas) enables the flexible modelling of the dependence structure for portfolios of large dimensions.\nThe Clayton canonical vine copula allows for the occurrence of extreme downside events and has been successfully applied in portfolio optimization and risk management applications. The model is able to reduce the effects of extreme downside correlations and produces improved statistical and economic performance compared to scalable elliptical dependence copulas such as the Gaussian and Student-t copula.\n\nOther models developed for risk management applications are panic copulas that are glued with market estimates of the marginal distributions to analyze the effects of panic regimes on the portfolio profit and loss distribution. Panic copulas are created by Monte Carlo simulation, mixed with a re-weighting of the probability of each scenario.\n\nAs regards derivatives pricing, dependence modelling with copula functions is widely used in applications of financial risk assessment and actuarial analysis – for example in the pricing of collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). Some believe the methodology of applying the Gaussian copula to credit derivatives to be one of the reasons behind the global financial crisis of 2008–2009; see .\n\nDespite this perception, there are documented attempts within the financial industry, occurring before the crisis, to address the limitations of the Gaussian copula and of copula functions more generally, specifically the lack of dependence dynamics. The Gaussian copula is lacking as it only allows for an elliptical dependence structure, as dependence is only modeled using the variance-covariance matrix. This methodology is limited such that it does not allow for dependence to evolve as the financial markets exhibit asymmetric dependence, whereby correlations across assets significantly increase during downturns compared to upturns. Therefore, modeling approaches using the Gaussian copula exhibit a poor representation of extreme events. There have been attempts to propose models rectifying some of the copula limitations.\n\nAdditional to CDOs, Copulas have been applied to other asset classes as a flexible tool in analyzing multi-asset derivative products. The first such application outside credit was to use a copula to construct a basket implied volatility surface, taking into account the volatility smile of basket components. Copulas have since gained popularity in pricing and risk management of options on multi-assets in the presence of a volatility smile, in equity-, foreign exchange- and fixed income derivatives.\n\nRecently, copula functions have been successfully applied to the database formulation for the reliability analysis of highway bridges, and to various multivariate simulation studies in civil engineering, reliability of wind and earthquake engineering, and mechanical & offshore engineering. Researchers are also trying these functions in the field of transportation to understand the interaction between behaviors of individual drivers which, in totality, shapes traffic flow.\n\nCopulas are being used for reliability analysis of complex systems of machine components with competing failure modes.\nCopulas are being used for warranty data analysis in which the tail dependence is analysed \n\nCopulas are used in modelling turbulent partially premixed combustion, which is common in practical combustors.\n\nCopula has many applications in the area of medicine, for example,\n\n\nThe combination of SSA and Copula-based methods have been applied for the first time as a novel stochastic tool for EOP prediction.\n\nCopulas have been extensively used in climate- and weather-related research.\n\nCopulas have been used to estimate the solar irradiance variability in spatial networks and temporally for single locations.\n\nLarge synthetic traces of vectors and stationary time series can be generated using empirical copula while preserving the entire dependence structure of small datasets. Such empirical traces are useful in various simulation-based performance studies.\n\nCopulas have been used for quality ranking in the manufacturing of electronically commutated motors.\n\nCopulas are important because they represent a dependence structure without using marginal distributions. Copulas have been widely used in the field of finance, but their use in signal processing is relatively new. Copulas have been employed in the field of wireless communication for classifying radar signals, change detection in remote sensing applications, and EEG signal processing in medicine. In this section, a short mathematical derivation to obtain copula density function followed by a table providing a list of copula density functions with the relevant signal processing applications are presented. \n\nFor any two random variables \"X\" and \"Y\", the continuous joint probability distribution function can be written as\n\nwhere formula_109 and\nformula_110 are the marginal cumulative distribution functions of the random variables \"X\" and \"Y\", respectively. \n\nthen the copula distribution function formula_111 can be defined using Sklar's theorem as:\n\nformula_112,\n\nwhere formula_113 and formula_114 are marginal distribution functions, formula_115 joint and formula_116.\n\nWe start by using the relationship between joint probability density function (PDF) and joint cumulative distribution function (CDF) and its partial derivatives.\n\nwhere formula_118is the copula density function, formula_119 and formula_120 are the marginal probability density functions of \"X\" and \"Y\", respectively. It is important to understand that there are four elements in this equation, and if any three elements are know, the fourth element can be calculated. For example, it may be used, \n\n\nVarious bivariate copula density functions are important in the area of signal processing. formula_121 and formula_122 are marginal distributions functions and formula_123 and formula_124 are marginal density functions. Extension and generalization of copulas for statistical signal processing have been shown to construct new bivariate copulas for exponential, Weibull, and Rician distributions. Zeng et al. presented algorithms, simulation, optimal selection, and practical applications of these copulas in signal processing.\n\n\n"}

De Soto joined with the ship's mate and led a mutiny off the coast of Angola in 1827. When 18 of the crew declined to participate they were cast adrift off in an open boat.\n\nHaving changed the name of the vessel from the \"Defensor de Pedro\" to the \"Burla Negra\", de Soto crossed the Atlantic, where he sold stolen cargo of slaves in the Caribbean, and then sailed south, attacking English, American, Spanish and Portuguese ships along the South American coast. From 1830 the \"Burla Negra\" also ventured eastwards into the Atlantic to intercept vessels returning from India and the Far East.\n\nHe proved to be one of the most bloodthirsty pirates of any age, murdering crews who fell into his hands and sinking their ships. \n\nThe most infamous episode in de Soto's career came on 19 February 1828, when the \"Burla Negra\" happened upon the \"Morning Star\" en route from Ceylon to England. After killing some of the passengers and crew with cannon fire, de Soto murdered the captain and took possession of the ship.\n\nMany of the captured crew were killed, while women passengers were raped before de Soto's men locked them in the hold with the rest of the survivors. When de Soto heard that the survivors had been locked away and not murdered, he was furious, turned them around to try to find the sinking \"Morning Star\" to finish the job. He did not want any evidence of his guilt in the attack to reach the ears of the court. However, de Soto could not find the drifting \"Morning Star\". Meanwhile, the imprisoned survivors had managed to escape and prevent the \"Morning Star\" from sinking. A passing merchant vessel rescued them the following day.\n\nAccording to \"Burla Negra\" crew member Nicholas Fernandez, \"A few days after the capture and destruction of the English ship [\"Morning Star\"], we fell in with a richly laden American ship (the \"Topaz\") bound from Calcutta to Boston, to the crew of which no more mercy was shewn than to that of the Morning Star - having laden our brig with a portion of the most valuable part of her cargo, the crew (with the exception of the captain and three hands, who were taken on board the brig) were all put to death, and the ship set on fire! and in a few days after, the captain and two of the three hands shared the fate of their companions! - we had now indeed from repeated instances, become so familiarized with the shedding of human blood, that the shrieks and groans of the devoted victims were about music to our ears! and the work of human butchery was performed as deliberately and with as much unconcern as the butcher would dispatch one of the brute animals of his flock!\"\n\nBy August of 1828 news spread in American papers about the murder of the \"Topaz\" crew. \"The following is a list of the officers and crew of the ship \"Topaz\" of Boston, which vessel was taken by pirates, and destroyed, and the whole crew murdered. Martin Brewster, born in Kingston, Mass., aged 32, master, Arnold S. Manchester, Little Compton, R.I., aged 30, first mate; Edward Smith, Ipswich, Mass., 21, second mate; John Barber (black), New York, 28, steward; Samuel Gulliver (black) New York, 36, cook; T. J.

On the way he encountered a small brig; he attacked and sank it, killing all the crew but one. De Soto forced the remaining sailor to steer the \"Burla Negra\" to Corunna; when they arrived at the port, de Soto blew the man's brains out.\n\nDe Soto's crimes caught up with him after the \"Burla Negra\" struck a reef and was wrecked off Cadiz. He and his men headed for Gibraltar, but they were recognized and taken for trial in Cadiz. De Soto was hanged with his remaining crew. When the hangman discovered that he had set the rope at the wrong height, De Soto calmly stood on his own coffin and obligingly placed his head inside the noose.\n\n'Adeus todos' (\"So long, everyone\") were his last words. His head was then stuck on a pike as a warning to others.\n\n\n"}

At that time, former club kid and nightlife fixture Richie Rich was working with event producer Susanne Bartsch. Traver Rains had just moved to New York City from Dallas and was teaching horseback riding at Chelsea Piers, where he and Rich first met. Rains later recalled: \"Richie was assisting Susanne Bartsch at the time, and her son Bailey was taking riding lessons.

{"id": "1793017", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1793017", "title": "Reception theory", "text": "Reception theory\n\nReception theory is a version of reader response literary theory that emphasizes each particular reader's reception or interpretation in making meaning from a literary text. Reception theory is generally referred to as audience reception in the analysis of communications models. In literary studies, reception theory originated from the work of Hans-Robert Jauss in the late 1960s, and the most influential work was produced during the 1970s and early 1980s in Germany and the US (Fortier 132), with some notable work done in other Western European countries. A form of reception theory has also been applied to the study of historiography.\n\nThe cultural theorist Stuart Hall was one of the main proponents of reception theory, first developed in his 1973 essay 'Encoding and Decoding in the Television Discourse'. His approach, called the encoding/decoding model of communication, is a form of textual analysis that focuses on the scope of \"negotiation\" and \"opposition\" by the audience. This means that a \"text\"—be it a book, movie, or other creative work—is not simply passively accepted by the audience, but that the reader/viewer interprets the meanings of the text based on her or his individual cultural background and life experiences. In essence, the meaning of a text is not inherent within the text itself, but is created within the relationship between the text and the reader. \n\nHall also developed a theory of encoding and decoding, Hall's theory, which focuses on the communication processes at play in texts that are in televisual form. \n\nReception theory has since been extended to the spectators of performative events, focusing predominantly on the theatre. Susan Bennett is often credited with beginning this discourse. Reception theory has also been applied to the history and analysis of landscapes, through the work of the landscape historian John Dixon Hunt, as Hunt recognized that the survival of gardens and landscapes is largely related to their public reception.\n\nA basic acceptance of the meaning of a specific text tends to occur when a group of readers have a shared cultural background and interpret the text in similar ways. It is likely that the less shared heritage a reader has with the artist, the less he or she will be able to recognise the artist's intended meaning, and it follows that if two readers have vastly different cultural and personal experiences, their reading of a text will vary greatly. Umberto Eco coined the term aberrant decoding to describe the case when the reader's interpretation differs from what the artist intended.\n\nIn literature, the interaction between text and reader occurs within a framework that controls and limits the interaction, through genre, tone, structure, and the social conditions of the reader and author, whereas in landscapes the interaction occurs through movement and viewing, framed by typology instead of genre and tone. Instead of an \"implied reader\", reception theory of landscapes assumes an \"implied visitor\", who is an abstracted concatenation of responses of many visitors at different times. \n\nThe theory recognizes that there is no single reading of a landscape that fulfills its entire potential, and that it is important to examine the motives of visitors and the factors influencing their visits (whether they read guidebooks about the place before visiting, or had strong feelings about the place or the designer, for instance). \n\nOne key difference between reception theory in literature and reception theory in landscape architecture is that while literary works are accessible only to the imagination, physical landscapes are accessible to the senses as well as to the imagination.\n\nReception theoretical analysis of architecture differs from typical writing on the history and analysis of landscapes, which tends to focus on the intentions of the designers, the conditions leading to the creation of the design, and the building process. Reception theory also tends to de-emphasize commonly used terms of description like 'formal' and 'picturesque', unless those terms were known to have meaning to landscape visitors themselves.\n\nAccording to Harold Marcuse, reception history is \"the history of the meanings that have been imputed to historical events. It traces the different ways in which participants, observers, historians and other retrospective interpreters have attempted to make sense of events both as they unfolded and over time since then, to make those events meaningful for the present in which they lived and live.\"\n\nOne area of scholarship where reception history is being explored more deeply is the reception history of the Bible. In the context of the Bible, reception history comprises the manifold interpretations of the biblical text from the time that it was written until now. It aims to show how biblical interpretations have developed throughout the centuries. The field that predated the reception history of the Bible has been known as the “history of interpretation” or “history of exegesis.” The greatest difference between reception history and its predecessor approach is that reception history does not restrict its interpretations. It includes interpretations that are marginal and even unorthodox.  Reception history does not restrict interpretations by medium either; it includes the use of art, music, poetry, and liturgy. In contrast, the history of interpretation is concerned with how biblical scholars have interpreted a text in only their commentaries and monographs. \n\nThe reception of the Bible is founded on the interpretative framework of Hans-Georg Gadamer. Gadamer was concerned with displaying how all interpretive acts are contextualized. At the same time, however, Gadamer maintained the integrity of empirical knowledge. Gadamer saw the contextualized interpretation of scripture and the empirical knowledge about its development are best understood to be in a dialogical relationship with one another. In this sense, it is a diachronic approach to interpretation of the Bible. The individual contexts of interpreters in communication with the original text is the basis for reception history of the bible. \n\nOne of the key issues surrounding biblical reception history is locating when it began. This issue is sometimes addressed by demarcating a shift from the original text and its reception. However, the distinction of an original text becomes difficult because of the various forms of the earlier biblical texts that were being used. Because of the various sources, traditions, and editions of the earliest biblical texts it is difficult to know what was considered original and was interpreted. Related to this issue of numerous source materials in biblical reception is the context of these source materials. If one wishes to try and read the original text, one is required to do so in its historical context lest it become detached and lose their meaning. The various contexts that are associated with each of the contributing texts does not allow for there to be a single context in which to read the text correctly.

{"id": "1793022", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1793022", "title": "MAX Yellow Line", "text": "MAX Yellow Line\n\nThe MAX Yellow Line is a light rail service in Portland, Oregon, United States, operated by TriMet as part of the MAX Light Rail system. It connects North Portland to Portland City Center and Portland State University (PSU). The line originates at Portland Expo Center in the north and runs south to the Rose Quarter along a segment referred to as the Interstate MAX. From there, it crosses the Willamette River into downtown Portland and operates as a northbound only service of the Portland Transit Mall on 6th Avenue. The line serves 17 stops between the and PSU South/Southwest 6th and College stations; of these, seven stops occupy the median of North Interstate Avenue, giving that segment its name. The Yellow Line runs for approximately 21 hours daily with a minimum headway of 15 minutes during most of the day.\n\nFollowing years of failed attempts to construct the South–North Line between Clackamas County and Clark County, Washington, Portland business leaders and local residents persuaded TriMet to build a light rail extension to North Portland in 1999. As a source of funding, the city created an urban renewal area, which has since been blamed for gentrifying historically black inner-city neighborhoods. The line began construction in 2001 and opened on May 1, 2004, four months ahead of schedule. From 2004 to 2009, the Yellow Line ran between Expo Center station in North Portland and the Library and Galleria stations in downtown Portland, sharing tracks within downtown with the Blue Line and the Red Line. In 2009, TriMet rerouted it to the newly rebuilt Portland Transit Mall.\n\nSince 2015, the Yellow Line has operated as a northbound through service of the Orange Line from PSU South/Southwest 6th and College station, sharing its transit mall alignment with the Green Line. Conversely, most southbound Yellow Line trains, which had served the other half of the mall on 5th Avenue from 2009 to 2015, through operate into the Orange Line from Union Station/Northwest 5th & Glisan Street station and terminate at Southeast Park Avenue station in Milwaukie. , the Yellow Line is the fourth-busiest service in the MAX system, carrying an average of 12,960 riders each weekday.\n\nPortland city planners originally conceived the idea of a northside passenger rail service in 1988 as part of Portland's Central City and Albina Community plans. These plans sought to extend the region's then two-year-old light rail system called MAX (for Metropolitan Area Express) through North Portland across the Columbia River and into Vancouver and Clark County in Washington via potential routes on either North Interstate Avenue, Interstate 5 (I-5), or Northeast Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard (formerly Northeast Union Avenue). As members of the U.S. Senate Committee on Appropriations, Oregon Senator Mark Hatfield and Washington Senator Brock Adams combined these proposals with a greater Portland–Oregon City light rail plan endorsed by Metro regional government, for which the committee appropriated $2 million in 1989.\n\nPreliminary alignment studies to Clark County, including an additional proposal for a line between Vancouver Mall and Clackamas Town Center along I-205, commenced shortly after. Planners identified a route from Hazel Dell through downtown Portland to Clackamas Town Center in 1994. Officially named the South–North Line, 63 percent of Portland area voters approved a $475 million bond measure in November to cover Oregon's portion of the project's estimated $2.8 billion cost. Across the river, Clark County requested a 0.3 percent increase in sales and vehicle excise taxes to provide Washington's $237.5 million share, which voters turned down by 69 percent on February 7, 1995.\n\nAmid fears that ridership would not justify a North Portland segment if Clark County were excluded, TriMet scaled back the project and released a second plan to build the line up to the Rose Quarter. Though backed by the state government, light rail opponents forced a statewide vote that defeated the proposal in November 1996. In an effort to regain the support of North Portland residents, who had historically voted in favor of light rail, TriMet announced a third plan in February 1997 that proposed a line from Lombard Street in North Portland to Clackamas Town Center. The Portland City Council pushed for a longer alignment through North Portland with a proposal that would have crossed the Willamette River on the Steel Bridge and on a new span farther upstream (south) near Caruthers Street; it would have run through the Portland Transit Mall and the median of North Interstate Avenue, terminating an additional mile north of Lombard Street in Kenton.\n\nIn August, due to the wording on the original ballot passed in 1994, which described the line extending into Clark County, the TriMet board elected to reaffirm voter support by drafting a new $475 million bond measure. Portland area residents cast their vote on November 3, 1998; those against the measure narrowly defeated it, 52 percent to 48 percent. With the South–North Line effectively canceled, light rail on the Portland Transit Mall and to Clackamas Town Center would not be built until 2009 for the Green Line. Much of the proposal's southern half, from Caruthers Street to Milwaukie, would also remain shelved until the opening of the Orange Line in 2015.\n\nIn 1999, North Portland residents and city business leaders urged TriMet to revive the South–North Line's northern portion but without the Clark County segment, arguing that 81 percent of Multnomah County voters had wanted light rail. TriMet agreed and developed a proposal to build the line along the median of North Interstate Avenue, between the Portland Expo Center and the Rose Quarter. Meetings and polls conducted in June of that year determined that locals overwhelmingly supported the project, which organizers began calling the Interstate MAX, as long as it was less expensive than the South–North Line, did not displace residents from their homes, and did not require any new taxes. The city council subsequently endorsed this proposal. TriMet projected the cost of the extension at $350 million (equivalent to $ in dollars).\n\nTo build the Interstate MAX without the need for a significant new source of local funding, the city created an urban renewal district surrounding the alignment, adopting the Interstate Corridor urban renewal area (ICURA) plan in August 2000. This covered an expansive area within 10 neighborhoods and directed $30 million in tax increment funds towards the project. Around this time, TriMet and the city had also completed funding the Airport MAX and Central City Streetcar projects without requesting any federal assistance; this allowed TriMet to declare them part of the Interstate MAX project, which provided $257.5 million in matching federal funds that the Federal Transit Administration approved in September. TriMet and Metro contributed $38.5 million and $24 million respectively to the remaining balance, sourced from their own general transportation funds.\n\nConstruction of the Interstate MAX began in February 2001 with a ceremony held near the Rose Quarter. Initial work on the line's junction with the Eastside MAX, located near the east end of the Steel Bridge, required a 16-day closure of the Eastside MAX segment between Rose Quarter Transit Center and Old Town/Chinatown station, during which buses shuttled riders between the two stations. In April, TriMet contracted Stacy and Witbeck to lay tracks between the Rose Quarter and Kenton, and to build a new vehicular overpass in Lower Albina. Meanwhile, the agency awarded the section between Kenton and the Expo Center, which included the construction of a dual-track bridge north of North Argyle Street, to F.E. Ward Constructors. The rapid pace of construction, which workers credited to improvements in track-laying and street reconstruction technology learned from previous MAX projects, hit a halfway point in April 2002. TriMet marked this milestone with a concrete pouring ceremony at the line's intersection with Portland Boulevard. Workers completed road and sidewalk improvements the following November, six months ahead of schedule. In August 2003, with construction approximately 80 percent complete, TriMet officials announced the line's targeted opening for the following spring, months earlier than the previously anticipated September commencement. Line testing began in February 2004 and continued up to the extension's inauguration.\n\nThe Interstate MAX extension opened on May1, 2004, four months ahead of schedule and $25 million under budget. TriMet created a new MAX service for the extension called the \"Yellow Line\", which ran from Expo Center station in North Portland to the Library and Galleria stations in downtown Portland, turning around at the 11th Avenue tracks; it followed First Avenue and Morrison and Yamhill streets upon entry into downtown, serving this segment alongside the Blue and Red lines, and replaced TriMet bus route 5–Interstate. Over 20,000 people attended opening day celebrations and TriMet offered free rides for two days. The presence of the line spurred redevelopment along the corridor, including new investments from Fred Meyer and New Seasons Market.\n\nOn August30, 2009, TriMet rerouted the Yellow Line to begin serving the light rail tracks added to the rebuilt Portland Transit Mall with the PSU Urban Center stations as its interim southern termini. The agency had placed the construction of the intended PSU South termini on hold as it awaited transit-oriented development projects in the area to finish. The PSU South stations opened in September 2012. Following the completion of the Portland–Milwaukie light rail project, which extended MAX service to Milwaukie, the Yellow Line became partially interlined with the new Orange Line. TriMet claimed separating the lines would allow it to better control service frequencies from North Portland and Milwaukie to downtown Portland, as it expected higher ridership along the Orange Line. It also anticipated few riders from these communities traveling beyond the city center. Most Orange Line trains subsequently took over operation of the southbound 5th Avenue segment of the transit mall on September12, 2015.\n\nPassenger rail services used to operate between Portland and Vancouver in Clark County, Washington, crossing the Columbia River. The first service commenced in April 1888, operating as a steam dummy line owned by the Portland and Vancouver Railway Company called the Vancouver Line. Its tracks initially ran from the corner of First and Washington streets in downtown Portland up to Hayden Island, and Vancouver-bound passengers needed to transfer to a ferry to continue across the river. The line became electrified in 1892 after it was purchased by the Portland Consolidated Street Railway. The first Interstate Bridge, which was built in 1917, finally extended the tracks across the river, replacing the ferry service. The streetcar remained operational as part of the Portland Railway, Light and Power Company until its closure in September 1940.\n\nAttempts have since been made to restore rail service to Clark County. Planners first considered the idea in 1974, when TriMet proposed a light rail line at the same time a governor's task force studied options for allocating federal assistance funds diverted from the canceled Mount Hood Freeway project. Then in 1984, a bi-state advisory committee revisited the concept, envisioning 8,000 commuters from Clark County by the year 2000. Both proposals were shelved due to feasibility issues and a lack of funding. Following the South–North Line's initial defeat, planning for a separate North Portland to Clark County segment continued. New studies were conducted to evaluate the feasibility of a light rail-only bridge or a tunnel. Other studies suggested light rail on a third vehicular bridge, an idea that had been considered since the late 1980s. An environmental study released in February 1998 for the South–North Line's third iteration included an option for a low bridge with a lift span. Prior to the South–North Line's cancellation, a decision was made to reserve the option for a later phase.\n\nIn 2004, Oregon and Washington embarked on efforts to replace the aging Interstate Bridge, citing the bridge's declining structural integrity and worsening congestion. This culminated in the Columbia River Crossing project in 2008. The project would have replaced the bridge and extended MAX further north from the Expo Center through Hayden Island and across the Columbia River to downtown Vancouver and Clark College. It would have added seven new stations along of new track. Planners projected the extension to cost upwards of $3.5 billion (equivalent to $ in dollars). In June 2013, three months after the Oregon Legislature authorized $450 million in state funding, the Washington State Senate declined to fund Washington's share, with opponents citing the inclusion of light rail as a common reason for rejecting the proposal. The states terminated the project in March 2014.\n\nWith vehicular traffic worsening between Vancouver and Portland each year, a light rail extension into Clark County remains part of Metro's 2018 Regional Transportation Plan for 2040. The plan assumes a cost of $4.1 billion for the entire project, of which $3.1 billion would be used to replace the Interstate Bridge, $80 million to build a second bridge connecting Hayden Island to Portland Expo Center, and $850 million for the remainder of the extension. The Southwest Washington Regional Transportation Council also includes the light rail corridor in their own 2040 plan.\n\nThe Interstate MAX extension, which the Yellow Line serves exclusively, is long. Its northern terminus is Expo Center station, situated on the east end of the Portland Expo Center parking lot. From there, the line heads south adjacent to North Expo Road. Before Delta Park/Vanport station, it gradually elevates as it enters a viaduct, which crosses over North Victory Boulevard, North Interstate Avenue, the Columbia Slough, and North Columbia Boulevard before approaching an at-grade crossing on North Argyle Street. Just south of Kenton/North Denver Avenue station, the tracks enter the median of North Interstate Avenue and proceed south towards Interstate/Rose Quarter station at the Rose Quarter. The line joins the Eastside MAX alignment at the east end of the Steel Bridge, where Yellow Line trains continue across the Willamette River and enter downtown Portland via the Northwest Glisan Street ramp. A wye just south of Union Station splits the double-tracks to establish the northern end of the Portland Transit Mall on 5th and 6th avenues.\n\nOn the Portland Transit Mall, southbound Yellow Line trains through operate into the Orange Line bound for Milwaukie at Union Station/Northwest 5th & Glisan station on 5th Avenue. Conversely, Yellow Line trains serve the northbound 6th Avenue segment as through-routed continuations of the Orange Line from PSU South/Southwest 6th and College station alongside Green Line trains. Near PSU Urban Center/Southwest 6th & Montgomery station, MAX tracks cross with the Portland Streetcar, which serves a stop on Southwest Mill Street. Between the Pioneer Courthouse and Pioneer Courthouse Square at Pioneer Courthouse/Southwest 6th station, the 6th Avenue MAX line intersects with east–west MAX lines on Yamhill and Morrison streets, facilitating a transfer to the Pioneer Square South and Pioneer Square North stations. The line continues northward, entering Northwest Portland after passing West Burnside Street, eventually reaching the north end of the transit mall at Union Station/Northwest 6th and Hoyt station.\n\nFrom its opening in 2004 until 2009, the Yellow Line followed the Eastside MAX alignment from the east end of the Steel Bridge to the 11th Avenue tracks in downtown Portland, serving the stations from to Library and Galleria alongside Blue and Red line trains. It was rerouted to the Portland Transit Mall in August 2009 after the addition of light rail to 5th and 6th avenues.\n\nThe Interstate MAX extension consists of ten stations between Expo Center and Interstate/Rose Quarter. Of these ten stations, seven occupy the median of North Interstate Avenue, giving the line its name. Yellow Line trains serve 17 stations total; the remaining seven are located in downtown Portland along the northbound segment of the Portland Transit Mall on 6th Avenue and are shared with the Green Line. Transfers to the Orange Line, which runs southbound from Union Station in downtown Portland to Milwaukie, can be made at any of the seven stations along the transit corridor's 5th Avenue alignment, although most southbound Yellow Line trains through operate into the Orange Line.\n\nTransfers to the Blue and Red lines are available at Pioneer Courthouse/Southwest 6th station, and to the Blue, Green, and Red lines at Interstate/Rose Quarter station. Additionally, the Yellow Line provides connections to local and intercity bus services at several stops across the line, Amtrak near Union Station/Northwest 6th & Hoyt station, and the Portland Streetcar at PSU Urban Center/Southwest 6th & Montgomery station.\n\nThe Yellow Line operates for approximately 21 hours per day with the first northbound train arriving at Interstate/Rose Quarter station at 4:15 am as a through service of the Blue Line. The first southbound train departs Expo Center station for Union Station/Northwest 5th and Glisan at 5:03 am, where most trains continue as Orange Line services bound for Southeast Park Avenue station in Milwaukie. The first northbound train from PSU South/Southwest 6th and College departs for the Expo Center station at 5:05 am; end-to-end travel takes approximately 35 minutes. In the evenings, select southbound trains turn into eastbound Blue Line trains at Interstate/Rose Quarter station and continue on to Ruby Junction/East 197th Avenue station in Gresham, while other trains proceed along the Portland Transit Mall as part of the Green Line, terminating at PSU South/Southwest 5th and Jackson. The last northbound train departs PSU South station at 12:21 am and the last southbound train departs Expo Center station at 1:04 am. TriMet designates the Yellow Line as a \"Frequent Service\" route, with service running on a headway of 15 minutes during most of the day, which extends up to 30 minutes in the early morning and late evening hours.\n\nThe Yellow Line is the fourth-busiest MAX service, averaging 12,960 riders on weekdays in September 2019, down from 13,170 for the same month in 2018. Ridership projections in 2003, several months before the line's opening, expected 13,900 passengers per day during the line's first few years, growing to 20,000 daily passengers by 2020. For the 2015 fiscal year, the Yellow Line recorded 4.9 million total boardings, down from 5.4 million recorded in 2012. The drop in ridership, experienced systemwide, is attributed to crime and to lower-income riders being forced out of the inner city by rising housing prices.\n\nThe presence of the Interstate MAX and its accompanying ICURA plan has been blamed for gentrification in historically black Portland neighborhoods. In an analysis conducted by \"The Oregonian\" on the 2010 United States Census, approximately 10,000 people of color have left Portland's Central City between 2000 and 2010. Of this number, 8,400 had lived in inner North and Northeast Portland neighborhoods. According to another report by the Portland Housing Bureau, neighborhoods around Interstate Avenue and Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard were the only areas in Portland that experienced double-digit percentage declines in minority population from 2000 to 2013. During the same period, the Interstate Corridor gained more than 13,000 new white and non-Hispanic residents.\n\nThe 2000-adopted ICURA plan had outlined policies to prevent the displacement of existing residents—such as ensuring that affordable housing would be top priority—that the Portland Development Commission (PDC) later eliminated. Amid mounting pressure from the community, the PDC began setting aside 30 percent of the urban renewal funds for affordable housing in 2006. In July 2011, the PDC amended the ICURA plan, expanding its boundaries to and 17 neighborhoods. In 2016, the city allocated a budget of $52 million to help pay for housing projects within the urban renewal area and devised a housing plan referred to as the \"preference policy\", which offered a way for affected residents to stay or return to their neighborhoods.\n\n"}
{"id": "1793029", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1793029", "title": "Republika (band)", "text": "Republika (band)\n\nRepublika was a Polish rock band which began in 1978 in Toruń, Poland. Originally, the band was founded and fronted by Jann Castor under the name Res Publica. (See the links and notes below). The name took its origin from \"Rzecz Pospolita\" (Res Publica), but under the communist regime at the time the name was censored and not allowed. It has to be noted, that the band name was invented by Kris Caputa (Polish) currently residing in Victoria BC, Canada, who for the last thirty years worked in various fields of applied science, including astronomical instrumentation and numerical electrodynamics. One of the most notable member was the brother of Jann Castor, Zbigniew Ruciński, who was a guitar virtuoso - and it was him, who brought Grzegorz Ciechowski into the whole picture. The original art (black & white) was created by Ina Koneczna, an artist from Torun, which was later transformed (but based on her art) into black and white stripes that became the band's logo Republika became one of the most original European bands thanks to their specific anti-mainstream rock & roll songs and black-and-white performance motif. Their new wave-inspired music and lyrics, both catchy and poetic, forged a path into the Polish rock pantheon. Republika debuted at a new wave band concert in Torun in November 1981.\n\nIn June 1982 the band, consisting of Paweł Kuczyński (bass), Zbigniew Krzywański (guitar), Sławomir Ciesielski (drums), and Grzegorz Ciechowski (vocal, piano, flute) began a three-month recording session, which resulted in the classic 1983 album \"Nowe sytuacje\" (eng. \"New Situations\"). Within a year, Republika recorded \"Nieustanne tango\" (eng. \"Permanent Tango\"), which was a logical expansion of the anti-regime musical ideas they'd established in their debut. The band also released an English-language album, the Orwellian bell-ringer entitled 1984. Due to artistic quarrels, Republika disbanded in summer 1986. Grzegorz Ciechowski kicked off a solo career under as Obywatel G.C. (Citizen G.C); Kuczyński, Krzywański and Ciesielski, along with vocalist Robert Gawliński founded the band, Opera. Using unreleased Republika song sketches, Ciechowski released a solo album, Obywatel G.C., in 1986. His debut was an artistic success rather than commercial one; however his 1988 sophomore effort, Tak! Tak! was a blockbuster. In 1990, a concert in Opole acted as a catalyst for Republika's reunion. Only Kuczyński refused the proposition, so as a trio, the band issued their comeback album, 1991, which was a compilation of their well-known but rearranged songs. Kuczyński was replaced by Leszek Biolik, with whom Ciechowski, Krzywański, and Ciesielski finished recording the final Obywatel G.C. album titled \"Obywatel Świata;; (Citizen of the World) .\n\nIn 1993, the first live unplugged album \"Bez Prądu\" (Unplugged, lit. Without current) was released. The same year Republika recorded the classic album \"Siódma Pieczęć\" (eng. \"The Seventh Seal\"), which presented a more acoustic countenance, with keyboards and samplers replaced by Hammond or Rhodes piano. In 1995, they released the rather pop-sounding album, \"Republika marzeń\" (eng. \"Republic of Dreams\"). The last studio album recorded by the band was \"Masakra\" (eng. \"Slaughter\"), inspired by modern heavy rock and trip-hop. Grzegorz Ciechowski's sudden cardiac death on December 22, 2001 interrupted production of the next Republika album. Four finished tracks along with 15 live songs comprised a double-CD simply titled \"Republika\".\n\n"}
{"id": "1793033", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1793033", "title": "List of Ottawa Senators head coaches", "text": "List of Ottawa Senators head coaches\n\nThe Ottawa Senators are a professional ice hockey team based in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. The team is a member of the Atlantic Division of the Eastern Conference of the National Hockey League (NHL). The Senators, named after the original Ottawa Senators, began play in the NHL as an expansion team in 1992. Having first played at the Ottawa Civic Centre, the Senators have played their home games at the Canadian Tire Centre, which was first named The Palladium, since 1996. The team has been to the Stanley Cup Finals in the 2006–07 season, but lost to the Anaheim Ducks in five games. The current head coach is D. J. Smith named as head coach on May 23, 2019.\n\nThe modern Senators' first head coach was Rick Bowness. Bowness was a former NHL head coach for the Boston Bruins. Bowness coached for four seasons until November 1996, when he was fired by then-GM Randy Sexton, let go in a dispute over the playing time of Alexandre Daigle, who was not playing well. Bowness' successor, Dave Allison, the then-coach of the Senators' farm team the Prince Edward Island Senators of the American Hockey League (AHL) had no success with Ottawa. The club won only two of 25 games during his tenure. The club, in turmoil at the time, replaced GM Sexton with Pierre Gauthier, who fired Allison. Allison is the only person to have each spent his entire NHL head coaching career with the Senators.\n\nOne of Gauthier's first moves as GM was the hiring of Jacques Martin. Martin, who coached the Senators for nine seasons, is the franchise's all-time leader for the most regular-season games coached (692), the most regular-season game wins (341), the most playoff games coached (69), and the most playoff-game wins (31). Martin was the first Senators coach to win the Jack Adams Award, having won it in the 1998–99 season. Although the club had regular-season success with Martin, he never led the team to much playoff success, and he was fired after the team lost in the first round of the 2004 playoffs.\n\nDuring Martin's tenure, the club hired Roger Neilson, a long-time NHL head coach, as an assistant coach. For the last two games of the 2001–02 season Neilson was officially made the head coach so that he could become the ninth head coach in NHL history to coach 1,000 games. Martin returned to head coach the team for the playoffs. Neilson would be the assistant coach for Ottawa for one more season, before succumbing to cancer in 2003. The club won the Presidents' Trophy in 2003 for the best regular-season record in the league and made it to the Eastern Conference Finals before losing to the eventual Stanley Cup champion New Jersey Devils. Neilson is the only Senators head coach to have been elected into the Hockey Hall of Fame, elected as a builder.\n\nMartin's successor was Bryan Murray. Murray, at the time of his hiring in 2004, was the general manager of the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim. He joined the Senators to return home, having been born in nearby Shawville, Quebec. The first season of Murray's term was lost to the lockout, but when the team returned to play it continued its winning ways. Murray coached the team for two seasons, and the club made it to the 2007 Stanley Cup Finals, the modern Senators' first appearance in the Finals. After the Finals, Murray's contract to coach was due to expire. GM Muckler's contract had one more season to run and Muckler was expected to retire after that one further season. Rather than let Murray go, team owner Eugene Melnyk and team president Roy Mlakar decided to promote Murray to GM, replacing Muckler.\n\nMurray promoted assistant John Paddock to head coach for the 2007–08 season. The club started well, but the team declined to the point where Murray fired Paddock after 64 games. Paddock's overall record of 36–22-6 was good, but the club was playing below .500 since a 15–2 start to the season, and there were controversies surrounding goaltender Ray Emery and Wade Redden. Murray returned to the bench to guide the Senators for the rest of the season and the playoffs, where the team lost in the first round.\n\nFor the 2008–09 season, the Senators made several personnel moves and chose Craig Hartsburg, a former NHL head coach, as head coach to promote 'accountability' on the part of the players. However, the team continued its sub .500 record and Hartsburg was let go after only 48 games with a record of 17–24–7.\n\nCory Clouston was named the head coach on February 2, 2009. Clouston was already a part of the Senators organization as head coach of the Binghamton Senators. Clouston served as head coach for two further seasons, before being fired on April 9, 2011. The team made the playoffs in his first full season of coaching, but slid to the bottom of the standings in his second season.\n\nPaul MacLean was hired on June 14, 2011. MacLean, a former NHL player, had previously been an assistant coach with Anaheim and Detroit. MacLean had previously worked with Murray in Anaheim. During his term, MacLean was twice nominated for the Jack Adams Trophy for coach of the year, winning it for the 2012–13 season. MacLean was fired on December 8, 2014, and replaced by his assistant Dave Cameron.\n\nAfter the 2015–16 season, in which the Senators failed to make the playoffs, Dave Cameron was fired and replaced by Guy Boucher. Boucher guided the club in its first season to a berth in the Eastern Conference Final, losing in overtime in the seventh game to the eventual Stanley Cup champion Pittsburgh Penguins. In his second season, the team nosedived to 30th-place overall. In his third season, Boucher was fired prior on March 1, 2019, with the club in 31st-place overall. His associate coach, Marc Crawford was named as interim head coach. D. J. Smith was then hired as the permanent head coach on May 23, 2019, for the 2019–20 season.\n\n\"Note: Statistics are correct through the 2017–18 season.\"\n\n"}

It is centred on the town of Port Augusta. The city was the site of South Australia's main power supplier, the Port Augusta powerhouse, located on the coast of the Spencer Gulf.\n\nThe Port Augusta region is a natural crossroads and aborigines have been trading in the area for 40 000 years. European settlement began in the 1840s and the town grew from a pastoral service centre to a railway town with the construction of the overland telegraph line, then the commencement of the railways towards Alice Springs and Kalgoorlie.\n\nThe municipality was created as the Corporate Town of Port Augusta on 3 November 1875. A number of smaller separate municipalities were subsequently proclaimed in the Port Augusta area, including the Corporate Town of Davenport (25 August 1887), the Corporate Town of Port Augusta West (6 October 1887), and the District Council of Davenport (5 January 1888, later called Woolundunga). The municipalities in the area were amalgamated on 16 February 1933, with Port Augusta West, Davenport and part of Woolundunga being merged into a larger Port Augusta municipality. It became the City of Port Augusta with the granting of city status in late 1964.\n\nThe Port Augusta Town Hall was built to house the municipality in 1886-87. It was severely damaged by fire in 1944, rebuilt in 1946, but was vacated by the City in 1983 after the completion of the new Port Augusta Civic Centre. The former town hall subsequently fell into disuse, and was advertised for sale by the state government in June 2015 awaiting redevelopment.\n\nAnother major industry was the production of electric power, with three coal-fired power stations burning coal mined at Leigh Creek, the first of which was completed in 1954. The last of these (Northern Power Station) was shut down on 9 May 2016. Demolition and rehabilitation of the site was completed in May 2019.\n\nThe district also includes two closely neighbouring areas, one of which is a significant town.

() is a 1998 Indian Hindi-language romantic thriller film set in the backdrop of the insurgency in Northeast India, written and directed by Mani Ratnam, and produced by Ratnam, Ram Gopal Varma, and Shekhar Kapur. The film stars Shahrukh Khan and Manisha Koirala in the lead roles, while Preity Zinta makes her film debut in a supporting role. Written by Ratnam and Tigmanshu Dhulia, the film is an example of parallel cinema and is noted as the final installment of Ratnam's thematic trilogy that consists of \"Roja\" (1992) and \"Bombay\" (1995). Though the film was shot mainly in Hindi-language, director Mani Ratnam also dubbed and released the film in Tamil in the title \"Uyire..\" () which became very popular among Tamil-audience with its songs. Shah Rukh Khan's Tamil dialogues were dubbed by Arvind Swamy in the film. \n\nThe film was screened at the Era New Horizons Film Festival and the Helsinki International Film Festival. Noted for its aspects nonlinear storytelling, the film won awards for cinematography, audiography, choreography, and music, among others. The film was a success overseas earning $975,000 in the United States and £537,930 in the United Kingdom, becoming the first Indian film to enter the top 10 in the United Kingdom box office charts, and it was also a hit in Japan. The film won two National Film Awards and six Filmfare Awards, while also receiving a special mention at the Netpac Awards. The film's soundtrack album, composed by A. R. Rahman, sold six million units in India.\n\nAmarkant Varma (Shahrukh Khan) is a program executive for All India Radio, dispatched from New Delhi to cover festivities in Assam. On his way there, during a rainy night, Amar stops at Haflong train station to catch the Barak Valley Express. As he waits, he tries to have a smoke and asks a mysterious person for either a match or a lighter. Suddenly a strong gust of wind blows the shawl off the person, revealing it to be a woman (Manisha Koirala). Amar finds her very attractive and tries to strike up a conversation, but she ignores him for a bit and then asks him for a cup of tea. When he returns with the tea, he watches as she boards the next train with three male passengers and rides off into the distance.\n\nLater, Amar spots the same woman in Silchar. He attempts to talk to her, but she says she cannot recall meeting him before. As part of his news reporting assignment, for the occasion of fifty years of Indian Independence, Amar interviews many citizens of Assam, and an extremist chief (Gautam Bora), who claims that the reason behind human rights violations and poverty in the region is due to the Indian Government, and that the Liberationists do not wish to enter into any dialogue with the government, and further justify their resistance in Utthar Purv.\n\nA few weeks later, Amar describes his encounter with the woman, over the radio, which she hears. He again spots her at a post office. At this juncture, she tells him to leave her alone; but he follows her to the house and tells her that he is in love with her. She resists and tells Amar that she is married. Amar wishes to apologize to her, but she arrives with two men who beat him unconscious.\n\nDuring the beating, Amar learns that the men are presumably her brothers and that she had lied about her being married. He reaches her home, and learns from the locals that she has left the place. Amar then goes to the post office where he initially spotted her and bribes the PCO owner into giving him her contact details, and learns that she is telephoning to Ladakh. Subsequently, Amar travels to Leh, and while recording the Sindhu Darshan Festival, a suicide bomber is chased to death by the military, and Amar spots the woman again. As the woman and Amar board a bus, military officers question each passenger before the bus is allowed to leave. While Amar tell the officers that he is there reporting on the festival, the woman uses Amar to her advantage and tells the officers that Amar is her husband.\n\nAfter some travel, the bus breaks down and the passengers are required to walk to a nearby village. En route Amar forces the woman to reveal her name: Meghna. The two end up traveling together and recuperate. In the morning, Amar wakes to find Meghna gone. It is later revealed that Meghna is part of a Liberationists group which has planned multiple suicide attacks in New Delhi at the upcoming Republic Day celebrations.\n\nAmar returns to his home in Delhi, where his family has found Preeti Nair (Preity Zinta) from Kerala as a potential bride for him. Amar agrees to marry Preeti because he has no hope that he will ever meet Meghna again. On his date with Preeti, Amar spots one of Meghna's associates, Kim, who banished him earlier. Amar chases him down to Connaught Place, where the man kills himself with a cyanide pill after being stopped by local police. Because of the extremist nature of the situation, the police relinquish the incident to the CBI.\n\nMuch to Amar's surprise, Meghna shows up in Delhi and asks Amar to help her get a job as an office assistant at Amar's All India Radio office. It is later revealed that Meghna actually arrives in Delhi with her terrorist group and stays in Amar's residence to escape from the CBI inquiry operation. Based on eyewitness claims of the Connaught Place incident, Amar is now a prime suspect of the CBI (Piyush Mishra). At this juncture Amar follows Meghna and questions her motives, and she reveals to Amar that her name is actually Moina, and as a child, she had been a rape victim of the army and seeks liberation through her suicide attack on the Indian army and the President of India during Republic Day. Now the CBI convinces the Army general of India to grant permission to conduct security checks of all the Army convoys and tankers participating in the parade.\n\nAmar is again assaulted by Moina's associate (Aditya Srivastava) and the terrorists and as Amar fights back the terrorists receive a call from Moina on their mobile. Amar grabs the mobile and pleads with Moina to stop all this and marry him. Moina reveals that it is too late, and presumes Amar is being killed. But Amar returns home, only to find out from Preeti that Amar's mother is also being questioned and that Moina's location is at Sunder Nagar. The CBI also misconstrue that Amar is part of the terrorist group and arrest him.\n\nAmar claims to the CBI that he is not in cahoots with the terrorists, but in love with Moina and that he has interviewed one of the extremist leaders and wants to prevent them from perpetrating the attack. The CBI rejects Amar's claims and sedates him for further interrogation. The next day Moina is ready for the suicide attack. Amar escapes from the CBI and tries to hold Moina back. Amar expresses his love and desire to be with her. When she is still indecisive, he tells her he will even die with her if she does not wish to stop her suicide attempt. He embraces her and continues to plead with her to live with him. As they embrace, the explosive vest worn by Moina explodes, killing them both.\n\nSameer Chanda, and Wasiq Khan were the production and art designers for \"Dil Se\". The principal photography took place in Himachal Pradesh, Leh, Assam, New Delhi, Kerala, and Bhutan over a period of 55 days. Tigmanshu Dhulia was the casting director. Pia Benegal and Manish Malhotra were the costume designers, Simran Bagga was Mani Rathnam's first choice for the role that Preity Zinta eventually accepted. The song \"Chaiyya Chaiyya\" was shot between Malaika Arora and Shah Rukh Khan on top of the Nilgiri Express, en route Ooty, Coonoor and Kotagiri, the train is particularly painted in brown for the song sequence. The travelling scenes, other crucial scenes were shot between Manisha Koirala and Shah Rukh Khan near Alchi Monastery, during the Sindhu Darshan Festival in Leh. The longest song of the film \"Satrangi Re\" with the lead pair was shot near Thikse Monastery, the mystical Basgo Monastery ruins, and Pangong lake near Pangong Tso in Ladakh. The song \"Jiya Jale\" was shot between Priety Zinta and Shah Rukh Khan near Athirappilly Falls, Alappuzha backwaters, Periyar National Park, and Periyar Lake in Kerala. Several action sequences in the film choreographed by Allan Amin were shot near Connaught Place, New Delhi, Rajpath and Old Delhi.\n\n\"Dil Se\" is said to be a journey through the seven shades of love that are defined in ancient Arabic literature. Those shades are defined as an attraction, infatuation, love, reverence, worship, obsession, and death. The character played by Shahrukh Khan passes through each shade during the course of the film. Authors Sangita Gopal and Sujata Moorti of \"Global Bollywood: Travels of Hindi Song and Dance\" also compared Khan's romance in the film to the trajectory of love in ancient Arabic literature, believing the lyrics in two of the songs to have delivered an \"apocalyptic fatalism\".\n\nThe film is a dramatization of the attraction between a character from the heart of India and another from a peripheral state and a representation of opposites in the eyes of the law and society. \"Dil Se\" is described as a film \"structured through deferment and unfulfilled teasing promises.\"\n\nElleke Boehmer and Stephen Morton in their book \"Terror and the postcolonial\" (2009) believe that the songs and their exotic locations in the film were very important in masking the impossible reconciliation between a terrorist and an uptight government agent by evoking pure fantasy. They argue that this is a phenomenon called the \"liminal space of dreaming\" in that the terrorist woman cannot fulfill her sexual desire so the songs fill the void of this desire by \"their sumptuousness and exotic locales\" in the Ladakh region.\n\nThough \"Dil Se\" received a poor box office response in India, it found success overseas. It was screened at the Era New Horizons Film Festival and the Helsinki International Film Festival The film went on to win the Netpac Award at the Berlin International Film Festival, two National Film Awards, and six Filmfare Awards. The intense political agenda of the film with the trials of the Assamese on the India-China border, the love story and the fact that it coincided with the 50th Independence Anniversary celebrations became a major factor for its success overseas, particularly amongst the South Asian diaspora in the west.\n\nThe film became the first Indian film to enter the top 10 in the United Kingdom box office charts. Even two months after its release in September 1998 the film was still screened on five screens, five times per day with an average of 3000 spectators across all screens in the Cineworld complex in Feltham, West London.\nDeepa Deosthalee wrote a positive review to the film, calling it \"A picture perfect ode to love\" and praising the direction, writing and performances. Khalid Mohamed found the film disappointing, noting it \"fine performances, technique and music\" but panning its lack \"of that crucial element called a story\". Anupama Chopra of \"India Today\" wrote, \"Amid the reels of tripe churned out by Bollywood every week, Dil Se... is a noble attempt. But coming from Mani, that's simply not good enough.\" The film was included in Time Magazine's \"Best of Bollywood\" list in 2010. \"Dil Se\" was also a hit in Japan.\n\nThe film has won the following awards:\n\nThe soundtrack features six songs composed by A. R. Rahman. Raja Sen of Rediff called it, \"Rahman's finest soundtrack, by far.\" The soundtrack album sold six million units in India. The song \"Chaiyya Chaiyya\", based on Sufi music and Urdu poetry, became especially popular and the song has been featured in the film \"Inside Man\", in the musical \"Bombay Dreams\", and in the television shows \"Smith\" and \"\". The soundtrack was recorded in several other languages. The Tamil version of the track \"Chaiyya Chaiyya\", entitled \"Thaiyya Thaiyya\", was sung by Palghat Sriram, although Sukhwinder Singh, who sang the Hindi version was credited as the singer. Malayalam lyrics for the song \"Jiya Jale\" were penned by Gireesh Puthenchery while the Punjabi part of \"Thayya Thayya\" was penned by Tejpaul Kour.\n\nPink Floyd bass guitarist Guy Pratt for post Roger Waters albums Delicate Sound of Thunder, The Division Bell and Pulse played bass on title song Dil Se Re.\n\nThe background score was also appreciated and said to have contributed largely to the film. \n\nHindi (\"Dil Se\")\n"}

The festival, Kentucky's largest single annual event, first ran from 1935 to 1937, and restarted in 1956 and includes:\n\nThe Kentucky Derby Festival Association started the first week-long festival in 1935, including a parade, a riverfront regatta and an orchestral concert. The first director was Olympic gold medalist Arnold Jackson. In 1937, a Derby Festival king and queen were crowned, marking the start of this tradition. After the floods of 1937, the festival was discontinued and it was not until 1956 when the modern-day Kentucky Derby Festival was reborn.\n\nEvents vary from year to year but always include numerous athletic events, including the miniMarathon and Marathon; concerts; fashion shows; wine tastings; luncheons and private parties ranging from backyard barbecues to lavish Derby Eve balls attended by entertainment stars, famed athletes and other persons of note.\n\nThe Royal Court is among the oldest traditions of the Kentucky Derby Festival tradition, dating back to the 1950s by The Fillies, Inc. The Royal Court consists of a group of five young women chosen to preside over events related to the Kentucky Derby. These women officially represent both the Derby Festival and the city of Louisville. In January, a court of Derby Princesses is selected from a pool of more than 1000 applicants. Thirty finalists are selected and the pool is then reduced to five young women who make up the court. Criteria for the selection of the court members includes knowledge of the Derby Festival, poise, intelligence, personality, academic excellence and campus/community involvement.\n\nThe court attends nearly 70 events during the two-week period leading up to the Kentucky Derby. The queen is selected by a spin of the wheel at the Annual Fillies Derby Ball. The festival saw this method of queen selections as the most fair way to select from their court and the tradition continues today. Each member of the court is awarded a $2000 scholarship, an entire wardrobe for the festival, VIP access to all events and a chauffeur for the entire two weeks of the official Kentucky Derby Festival.\n\nThe festival's first major event is Thunder Over Louisville. Thunder kicks off with a day-long air show ranked as fifth-largest in the United States and the largest fireworks display in North America. The approximately 30 minute firework display begins at nightfall. Thunder Over Louisville's fireworks have been designed and performed by Zambelli Fireworks International since 1991.\n\nDuring the festival, much of Waterfront Park is billed as \"Fest-aVille\". It hosts a number of events, including the Chow Wagon, rides, and concerts.\n\nEach year, an official Derby Festival poster is unveiled and prints are sold to help finance festival events. Artists and photographers who have produced the prized posters include Peter Max and Michael Schwab.\n\nThe first event held by KDF was the 1956 Pegasus Parade. The parade is held annually on the Thursday before Derby.\n\nVarious sport competitions are held as part of the Festival. From 1973 to 2017, the Festival hosted the Kentucky Derby Festival Basketball Classic. Since 1974, a pro-am golf tournament has been held.\n\nA number of races take place in the festival. The Kentucky Derby Festival miniMarathon and Marathon occur the Saturday before the Kentucky Derby; USA Track and Field named the miniMarathon among the nation's top 50 races. The mini has been held since 1974. That same Saturday is typically also when the Great Balloon Race is held, the culmination of the hot air balloon-themed BalloonFest.\n\nRecognition is given to Louisville's restaurant employees with the Run for the Rosé, where waiters and waitresses run an obstacle course while carrying trays of glasses filled with White Zinfandel Wine. Servers finishing with the best time and most wine remaining in the glasses win prizes.\n\nFor the annual bed races, businesses create themed mobile beds that are paraded before being race on an indoor track with costumed employees. The Great Steamboat Race usually takes place in the week before Derby, where the Belle of Louisville typically takes on at least one challenger.\n\nSince 1997, a spelling bee has been held for the festival.\n\nSince 1973, KDF has sold a plastic pin for the Kentucky Derby featuring a pegasus. The pin is used as proof of purchase for admission to a number of the KDF events.\n\nA controversial aspect of the Derby Festival is \"Derby Cruising.\" Though it is not an official or licensed event during Derby Festival, it takes place in the historically black areas of West Broadway on Derby day and the Friday before it. Cruising consists of motorcycles and cars (many elaborately modified) driving slowly down Broadway, pedestrians crowding the sidewalks, and several blocks closed for a festival with rides and street vendors. The gridlock associated with cruising made it difficult for police to respond to instances of violence during 2005 Derby cruising. In 2006, police made an effort to stop cruising, shutting down Broadway except to emergency vehicles, which resulted in suggestions of racial profiling and much public debate about the legitimacy of Broadway cruising as a free alternative to other festivities.\n\nIn 2007, police announced similar plans, although slightly more of Broadway was to remain open, including access to Shawnee Park. The 2007 plan sparked a lawsuit by business owners and a civil rights foundation, claiming the shutdown of Broadway during Derby week violated their constitutional rights and cost them hundreds of thousands of dollars in business. A federal judge allowed the plans to proceed, citing concerns about \"public safety and the free flow of traffic\".\n\nIn 2008, police again banned cruising, but with a new plan allowing traffic to flow but to have a high number of officers on hand to enforce the city's noise and cruising ordinances, the latter of which prevents vehicles from blocking a roadway. Police reported that arrests were down from 2007, although they did shut down a 10-block portion of Broadway for a short time on Derby evening after gridlock developed.\n\n\n"}

The hometown Montreal Alouettes defeated the Edmonton Eskimos by a score of 41–6.\n\nThe 1977 Grey Cup was Canada's version of the Ice Bowl, as the playing surface was more ideal for ice hockey than football. A blizzard hit Montreal two days prior to the game, and stadium crews salted the field to melt the snow. But when the temperature plunged the next day, the melted snow turned into a sheet of ice. To combat the conditions, many Alouette players affixed staples to the bottom of their shoes in order to get good traction. This move was spearheaded by star defender Tony Proudfoot. The game was the third Grey Cup meeting in four years between the Alouettes and the Edmonton Eskimos. With a record Grey Cup crowd of 68,318 at Montreal's Olympic Stadium, the home team did not disappoint in a 41-6 rout over their Western rivals.\n\nSonny Wade completed 22 of 40 passes for 340 yards and three touchdowns. He was intercepted once. Montreal had a total offence of 424 yards, making 21 first downs. The Eskimos were held to just 102 yards and turned the ball over 10 times, six times in the first half alone. The kicking game carried over from the 1975 Grey Cup as both Montreal's Don Sweet and Edmonton's Dave Cutler scored all the points in the first half. Sweet was good on three field goal attempts and missed on one for a single point. With Edmonton trailing 10-0, Cutler finally put the Eskimos on the scoreboard on the final play of the second quarter, connecting on a nine-yard field goal. Sweet booted two field goals, and Cutler kicked another before a Grey Cup touchdown drought spanning eight quarters between these teams was finally put to rest. Edmonton running back Angelo Santucci's fumble set up an Alouette scoring drive. Wade threw a seven-yard touchdown pass to Peter Dalla Riva to put the Alouettes ahead 23-6. Just prior to the start of the fourth quarter, Wade threw a 10-yard major to a wide-open John O'Leary, and the rout was on.\n\nCornerback Vernon Perry returned an interception 74 yards to help set up Wade's seven-yard touchdown pass to Bob Gaddis. Sweet added a single and field goal to complete the scoring. Sweet set a number of records in the game, including six field goals and 23 total points, records which still stand. This game marked the Alouettes' third and final championship of the 1970s. For the Eskimos, it marked their fourth loss in five trips to the final since 1960.\n\nAlthough Olympic Stadium was designed to have a retractable roof, and a roof was added in 1987, the stadium was an open-air facility in November 1977. As is common in late November, Montreal received a fair amount of snow before game time.\n\nStadium crews put salt on the field to melt the snow. But when the temperature dropped on game day, the snow turned into a sheet of ice. The game was marred by several fumbles on otherwise routine snaps of the ball. However, the Alouettes had a competitive advantage: they affixed staples to the bottom of their sneakers to get traction on the slippery surface. The Eskimos, using standard football cleats, never quite found their footing on the icy AstroTurf field (which had a carpet-like texture then, unlike modern artificial turf systems).\n\nTony Proudfoot, Alouette defensive back and the man largely responsible for perhaps the cleverest ploy in Grey Cup history:\n\n\nFirst Quarter\n\nMontreal – FG – Don Sweet\nMontreal – FG – Don Sweet\nMontreal – FG – Don Sweet\nMontreal – Single – Don Sweet missed field goal\n\nSecond Quarter\n\nEdmonton – FG – Dave Cutler\n\nThird Quarter\n\nMontreal – FG – Don Sweet \nEdmonton – FG – Dave Cutler \nMontreal – FG – Don Sweet \nMontreal – TD – Peter Dalla Riva 7 yard pass from Sonny Wade (Don Sweet convert)\nMontreal – TD – John O'Leary 10 yard pass from Sonny Wade (Don Sweet convert)\n\nFourth Quarter\n\nMontreal – TD – Bob Gaddis 7 yard pass from Sonny Wade (Don Sweet convert)\nMontreal – Single – Don Sweet missed field goal\nMontreal – FG – Don Sweet\n"}

Created in 2002, AMR uses a technology ATI calls \"Super Tiling\" to connect multiple (two or more) video cards together. AMR has been primarily used by Evans and Sutherland, for commercial flight simulators, because of its ability to use more than two VPUs. ATI has introduced a \"consumer level\" version of AMR, which they refer to as CrossFire.\n\nSuper Tiling is a technology that splits the screen up into equal divisions whose size is based on the number of VPUs. These divisions are called tiles. The partial images are then put together and displayed on the screen. Although not much is known about the interconnect method, it may be a device that bridges the cards together in a method similar to nVidia's SLI bridge card, or it may pass data over unused PCIe ports (as each card will be on a 16X slot, but will only be working at 8X interconnect rates)\n\nThe official name of AMR's commercial variant is ATI CrossFire. The chipset was launched with ATI's R520 core for Intel and AMD platforms in the summer of 2005.\n\n"}

In contrast to laundry detergents, fabric softeners may be regarded as a kind of after-treatment laundry aid.\n\nMachine washing puts great mechanical stress on textiles, particularly natural fibers such as cotton and wool. The fibers at the fabric surface are squashed and frayed, and this condition hardens while drying the laundry in air, giving the laundry a harsh feel. Adding a liquid fabric softener to the final rinse (rinse-cycle softener) results in laundry that feels softer.\n\nIn the US and UK laundry is mostly dried in mechanical dryers, and the tumbling of the laundry in the dryer has its own softening effect. Therefore, fabric softeners in the US and UK are used rather to impart antistatic properties and a pleasant smell to the laundry. Fabric softeners are usually either in the form of a liquid, which is added to the washing machine during the rinse cycle (either by the machine itself or through use of a dispensing ball); or as a dryer sheet which is added to the moist laundry at the beginning of the dryer cycle. Liquid fabric softeners can be added manually during the rinse cycle or automatically if the machine has a dispenser designed for this purpose.\n\nFabric softeners coat the surface of a fabric with chemical compounds that are electrically charged, causing threads to \"stand up\" from the surface and thereby imparting a softer and fluffier texture. Cationic softeners bind by electrostatic attraction to the negatively charged groups on the surface of the fibers and neutralize their charge. The long aliphatic chains then line up towards the outside of the fiber, imparting lubricity.\n\nFabric softeners impart antistatic properties to fabrics, and thus prevent the build-up of electrostatic charges on synthetic fibers, which in turn eliminates fabric cling during handling and wearing, crackling noises, and dust attraction. Also, fabric softeners make fabrics easier to iron and help reduce wrinkles in garments. In addition, they reduce drying times so that energy is saved when softened laundry is tumble-dried. Last but not least, they can also impart a pleasant fragrance to the laundry.\n\nEarly cotton softeners were typically based on a water emulsion of soap and olive oil, corn oil, or tallow oil. Softening compounds differ in affinity to various fabrics. Some work better on cellulose-based fibers (i.e., cotton), others have higher affinity to hydrophobic materials like nylon, polyethylene terephthalate, polyacrylonitrile, etc. New silicone-based compounds, such as polydimethylsiloxane, work by lubricating the fibers. Manufacturers use derivatives with amine- or amide-containing functional groups as well. These groups improve the softener's binding to fabrics.\n\nAs softeners are often hydrophobic, they commonly occur in the form of an emulsion. In the early formulations, manufactures used soaps as emulsifiers. The emulsions are usually opaque, milky fluids. However, there are also microemulsions, where the droplets of the hydrophobic phase are substantially smaller. Microemulsions provide the advantage of increased ability of smaller particles to penetrate into the fibers. Manufacturers often use a mixture of cationic and non-ionic surfactants as an emulsifier. Another approach is a polymeric network, an emulsion polymer.\n\nIn addition to fabric softening chemicals, fabric softeners may include acids or bases to maintain optimal pH for absorption, silicone-based anti-foaming agents, emulsion stabilizers, fragrances, and colors.\n\nRinse-cycle softeners usually contain cationic surfactants of the quaternary ammonium type as the main active ingredient. Cationic surfactants adhere well to natural fibers (wool, cotton), but less so to synthetic fibers. Cationic softeners are incompatible with anionic surfactants in detergents because they combine with them to form a solid precipitate. This requires that the softener be added in the rinse cycle. Fabric softener reduces the absorbency of textiles, which adversely affects the function of towels and microfiber cloth.\n\nFormerly, the active material of most softeners in Europe, the United States, and Japan, were ditallowdimethylammonium chloride (DTDMAC) and distearyldimethylammonium chloride (DSDMAC). Due to their poor biodegradability, they were replaced by the readily biodegradable ester-quats in the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nConventional softeners, which contain 4–6% active material, have been partially replaced in many countries by softener concentrates having some 12–30 % active material.\n\nAnionic softeners and antistatic agents can be, for example, salts of monoesters and diesters of phosphoric acid and the fatty alcohols. These are often used together with the conventional cationic softeners. Cationic softeners are incompatible with anionic surfactants in detergents because they combine with them to form a solid precipitate. This requires that they be added in the rinse cycle. Anionic softeners can combine with anionic surfactants directly. Other anionic softeners can be based on smectite clays. Some compounds, such as ethoxylated phosphate esters, have softening, anti-static, and surfactant properties.\n\nAs with soaps and detergents, fabric softeners may cause irritant dermatitis. Manufacturers produce some fabric softeners without dyes and perfumes to reduce the risk of skin irritation. Fabric softener overuse may make clothes more flammable, due to the fat-based nature of most softeners. Some deaths have been attributed to this phenomenon, and fabric softener makers recommend not using them on clothes labeled as flame-resistant.\n"}

He is a founding member of the Upright Citizens Brigade sketch comedy troupe, with which he co-starred in the original television series and the 2015 reboot. He also previously starred in short-lived comedy programs such as \"Dog Bites Man\" and \"Players\", and was a correspondent on \"The Daily Show with Jon Stewart\". He has also co-starred in films such as \"Ghostbusters\", \"Life of the Party\", \"Ted\", \"Into the Storm\", \"Brigsby Bear\", and \"Old School\". \n\nWalsh was born in Chicago, the fourth of seven children of Dick and Audrey Walsh. He graduated from Hinsdale South High School in 1982. While in high school he played on the football team as a backup tight end. He attended Northern Illinois University, where he graduated with a degree in Psychology, also spending a year studying abroad in Austria at Salzburg College.\n\nAfter college, Walsh took improvisational comedy classes in Chicago, where he would become a regular performer at the Annoyance Theater and ImprovOlympic, where he studied under Del Close. In 1991, he met comedian Matt Besser, with whom he began performing stand-up comedy. Along with Matt Besser, Amy Poehler, and Ian Roberts, he is a founding member of the Upright Citizens Brigade improv comedy troupe and played \"Trotter\" in the troupe's sketch comedy series, which ran for three seasons on Comedy Central. Before the show, the UCB comedy foursome had already been doing improv shows at their theatre in New York, which used to be a burlesque house before they remodeled it to become a theatre. To date, they have founded four successful Upright Citizens Brigade comedy theaters located in New York at UCB Chelsea and The East Village UCB, and Los Angeles with UCB Franklin and UCB Sunset.\n\nBesides his sketch work with the Upright Citizens Brigade, Walsh is also known for his memorable supporting roles in popular comedy films in recent years including \"Cyrus\", \"Old School\", \"The Hangover\", \"Role Models\", and \"Semi-Pro\". Walsh also wrote and starred in the cult indie-comedy \"Martin & Orloff\", which had a limited theatrical run in 2002 and 2003. In addition, he was also a correspondent on \"The Daily Show\" from 2001 to 2002, and made regular appearances in comedy sketches on \"Late Night with Conan O'Brien\" and MTV's \"Human Giant\" as well as starring in the Comedy Central mockumentary series \"Dog Bites Man\" in the summer of 2006. Walsh has the distinction of having appeared in several Todd Phillips comedy films, most often playing characters aptly named \"Walsh\".\n\nIn 2010, Walsh created the improvised comedy series \"Players\" for Spike TV. Walsh (creator, writer, director and executive producer of the show) stars in the series alongside his Upright Citizens Brigade partner Ian Roberts, as two brothers who run a sports bar together. The show aired for one season, concluding on August 14, 2010.\n\nWalsh currently hosts the podcast \"Bear Down\" with comedian Scot Armstrong (screenwriter of \"Old School\") where they discuss their favorite football team The Chicago Bears and do sports-themed comedy bits such as fake call-ins and in-character interviews. The podcast has also featured appearances by comedians such as Horatio Sanz, Ian Roberts, Joseph Nunez, and Matt Price.\n\nIn 2010, Walsh had recurring roles on the NBC comedy series \"Outsourced\" and on the HBO comedy series \"Hung\". In 2012, he began co-starring as Mike McLintock in the HBO series \"Veep\", for which he was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series in 2016 and 2017. During that year, Walsh portrayed J. R. R. Tolkien in \"The Dead Authors Podcast\".\n\nWalsh directed his first feature film \"High Road\", an indie-comedy he co-wrote with Josh Weiner. The film was released on March 6, 2012. Walsh co-wrote his second film, \"A Better You\", with Brian Huskey, who also stars in the film.\n\nIn the movie \"Into the Storm\", Walsh stars as Pete Moore, who is the driver of the Tornado Intercept Vehicle nicknamed \"Titus.\"\n\nHe appeared in the MyCareer mode in the basketball simulation game \"NBA 2K17\".\n\n"}

It is common in clothing, but occurs with other items, such as the tendency of dust to be attracted to, and stick to, plastic items.\n\nIn clothing, static cling occurs from static electricity. An electrostatic charge builds up on clothes due to the triboelectric effect when pieces of fabric rub against each other, as happens particularly in a clothes dryer. The separate positive and negatively charged surfaces attract each other. It is especially noticeable when humidity is low, allowing static electricity to build up. Certain substances can reduce static cling and are often included in fabric softener and dryer sheets. Antistatic agents, which make the surfaces slightly conductive, can be used on fabrics.\n\nDust accumulation caused by static cling is a significant issue for computers and other electronic devices with heat generating components that need to be cooled by airflow. Dust is carried into the computer by the airflow created by case- and component fans. The accumulated dust covers metal surfaces and clogs the empty space between the fins of heatsinks, diminishing the dissipation of heat and interrupting the outward flow of warm air. Especially for critical components such as microprocessors and memory banks, this raises the risk of them overheating which can ultimately damage or destroy them. To compensate, automatically controlled fans will raise their speed, generating more noise and shortening their lifespan. An additional risk is the (small) electrical conductivity of dust which, given enough accumulation of dust, can cause critical damage to the device's internal components. Dust accumulation grows exponentially, since the accumulated dust creates new static surfaces and physical blockades for new dust to cling to.\n\nAdvertisers in urban areas, eager to use guerilla marketing techniques, have turned to static cling as a distribution medium. In an advertising campaign for Microsoft's MSN 8 Internet service, on October 24, 2002, hundreds of decals of the MSN butterfly logo were affixed to surfaces in New York City and the New York Times reported that it was static cling that held them there, however it's more likely that the decals used are of the type held by surface tension against smooth surfaces like glass windows.\n\n"}

The Grimm Brothers included it in their 1812 edition of \"Kinder- und Hausmärchen\", but there is an older moralistic version in the Grimms’ handwritten Ölenberg Manuscript from 1810. Jack Zipes noted in 2016 that the Grimms greatly treasured this tale, considering it to be one of the \"oldest and most beautiful in German-speaking regions.\"\nIt has been postulated that parts may extend back until at least Roman times; an aspect of the story is referred to in Petronius's \"Satyricon\", in which the character Trimalchio remarks that, \"qui fuit rana nunc est rex\" (\"The man who was once a frog is now a king.\"). Other scholars, however, argue that this may actually be a jab at the emperor Nero, who was often mockingly compared to a frog.\nFolkorist Stith Thompson suggests that the story of the Frog King in the German tradition began with a 13th century literary tale written in Latin.\n\nIn the tale, a spoiled princess reluctantly befriends the Frog Prince, whom she met after dropping a gold ball into a pond, and he retrieves it for her in exchange for her friendship. The Frog Prince magically transforms into a handsome prince. In the original Grimm version of the story, the frog's spell was broken when the princess threw it against the wall, while in modern versions the transformation is triggered by the princess kissing the frog.\n\nIn other early versions, it was sufficient for the frog to spend the night on the princess' pillow.\n\nThe frog prince also has a loyal servant named Henry (or Harry) who had three iron bands affixed around his heart to prevent it from breaking in his sadness over his master's curse. When the frog prince transforms into his human form Henry's overwhelming happiness causes all three bands to break, freeing his heart from its bonds.\n\nIt is Aarne–Thompson type 440. Other folktales similar to the Frog Prince are:\n\n\nA possible parallel in Antiquity may be found in the story of Danaid Amymone, who went to fetch water in a jug, because of a drought season created by the gods. A satyr tried to force himself on her, but maritime deity Poseidon rescued her. It has been suggested that the amphibian suitor and the handsome prince may have been separate characters at first.\n\n\n\n\n"}

In his early career with the Department of Aboriginal Affairs he was mainly in the bush and engaged in jobs such as stockwork and crocodile hunting while employed as a patrol officer and reserve superintendent. Later he was a teacher at bush schools. He was a member of the first National Reconciliation Council.\n\nEgan was the sole teacher at the Newcastle Waters Station in 1965 and was stranded at the property for six weeks when the creek flooded.

Complex sales involve long sales cycles with multiple decision makers. Multiple stakeholders and stakeholder groups contribute to every complex sale.\n\nAny product or service may become a complex sale. In some instances, a complex sale occurs when the market is mature and the stakes are high enough to warrant attention from a variety of stakeholders in the buying organization. In other instances a complex sales process is needed when the buyer has never had experience with the vendor, technology being sold, or if the solution is business critical or impacts the buying organization on a strategic level. The series of filters, purchasing steps, and stakeholders involved are designed to reduce the risks associated with making the wrong buying decision.\n\nOften the need to have multiple stakeholders or buyers involved relates to the level of risk that is involved in the purchase or sale of goods and/or services. As the buyer or buying organization if the purchase only impacts a small group of people or component of the buying organization then often the decision is made by one buyer and the process tends to be quite transactional.\n\nIf the purchase impacts the entire organization, affects the company strategically, or can change the buyer business process then often the sales person is required to have a set of skills that are more in line with a subject matter expert or consultant than a traditional sales person. This type of sales person can often be referred to as a Key Account Executive or Complex Sales Executive.\n\nLarge or complex sales opportunities that are international in nature require an additional set of personal and sales skills. The need for cross-cultural awareness may add an additional layer of complexity in the sales process.\n\nThe larger the purchase and the buyer risk the more trust and credibility required from the Vendor. As a \"Key Account Executive\" or \"Complex Sales Executive\" in addition to product knowledge and consultative selling skills top producing sales executives also have the ability to build strong client relationships and navigate and avoid the political pitfalls within client organizations.\n\n\nDue to the high costs of proposals in complex sales the hit rate i.e. the percentage of successful offers is a valuable indicator of the performance of the sales force.\n\nBy analysing the characteristics of 'stellar performers', Dixon and Adamson argued that building strong personal and professional relationships and advocates among customers was no longer the most important success factor for selling. On the contrary, nearly 40% of 'stellar performer's were sellers who pushed their thinking and were not afraid to share even controversial views with both their customers and bosses.\n\n"}

It is a classical type of organic acidemia.\n\nA characteristic feature of isovaleric acidemia is a distinctive odor of sweaty feet. This odor is caused by the buildup of a compound called isovaleric acid in affected individuals.\n\nIn about half of cases, the signs and symptoms of this disorder become apparent within a few days after birth and include poor feeding, vomiting, seizures, and lack of energy that can progress to coma. These medical problems are typically severe and can be life-threatening. In the other half of cases, the signs and symptoms of the disorder appear during childhood and may come and go over time. They are often triggered by an infection or by eating an increased amount of protein-rich foods.\n\nThe disorder has an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern, which means the defective gene is located on an autosome, and two copies of the gene - one from each parent - must be inherited to be affected by the disorder. The parents of a child with an autosomal recessive disorder are carriers of one copy of the defective gene, but are usually not affected by the disorder.\n\nMutations in both copies of the \"IVD\" gene result in isovaleric acidemia.\n\nThe enzyme encoded by \"IVD\", isovaleric acid-CoA dehydrogenase (), plays an essential role in breaking down proteins from the diet. Specifically, the enzyme is responsible for the third step in processing leucine, an essential amino acid. If a mutation in the IVD gene reduces or eliminates the activity of this enzyme, the body is unable to break down leucine properly. As a result, isovaleric acid and related compounds build up to toxic levels, damaging the brain and nervous system.\n\nThe urine of newborns can be screened for isovaleric acidemia using mass spectrometry, allowing for early diagnosis. Elevations of isovalerylglycine in urine and of isovalerylcarnitine in plasma are found.\n\nOn 9 May 2014, the UK National Screening Committee (UK NSC) announced its recommendation to screen every newborn baby in the UK for four further genetic disorders as part of its NHS Newborn Blood Spot Screening programme, including isovaleric acidemia.\n\nTreatment consists of dietary protein restriction, particularly leucine. During acute episodes, glycine is sometimes given, which conjugates with isovalerate forming isovalerylglycine, or carnitine which has a similar effect.\n\nElevated 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid is a clinical biomarker of biotin deficiency. Without biotin, leucine and isoleucine cannot be metabolized normally and results in elevated synthesis of isovaleric acid and consequently 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid, isovalerylglycine, and other isovaleric acid metabolites as well. Elevated serum 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid concentrations can be caused by supplementation with 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid, genetic conditions, or dietary deficiency of biotin. Some patients with isovaleric acidemia may benefit from supplemental biotin. Biotin deficiency on its own can have severe physiological and cognitive consequences that closely resemble symptoms of organic acidemias.\n\nA 2011 review of 176 cases found that diagnoses made early in life (within a few days of birth) were associated with more severe disease and a mortality of 33%. Children diagnosed later, and who had milder symptoms, showed a lower mortality rate of ~3%.\n\nIsovaleric acidemia is estimated to affect at least 1 in 250,000 births in the United States.\n\n\n"}

Federal appellate courts, including the Supreme Court, have the power to \"remand [a] cause and ... require such further proceedings to be had as may be just under the circumstances.\" This includes the power to make summary \"grant, vacate and remand\" (GVR) orders.\n\nAppellate courts remand cases whose outcome they are unable to finally determine. For example, cases may be remanded when the appellate court decides that the trial judge committed a procedural error, excluded admissible evidence, or ruled improperly on a motion.\n\nIn common law jurisdictions, remand refers to the adjournment (continuance) of criminal proceedings, when the accused is either remanded in custody or on bail. Appellate courts are said to remit matters to lower courts for further consideration.\n\nWhen the United States Supreme Court grants \"certiorari\" and reverses a decision of a state supreme court or a Federal appeals court, it may remand the case. Likewise, an appeals court may remand a case to a trial court. A remand may be a full remand, essentially ordering an entirely new trial; when an appellate court grants a full remand, the lower court's decision is \"reversed and remanded.\"\n\nAlternatively, it may be \"with instructions\" specifying, for example, that the lower court must use a different legal standard when considering facts already entered at trial. A partial remand occurs when an appellate court affirms a conviction while directing the lower court to revisit the sentencing phase of the trial. Finally, it may remand a case upon concluding that the lower court made a mistake and also did not adjudicate issues that must be considered.\n\nA federal court may also remand when a civil case is filed in a state court and the defendant removes the case to the local federal district court. If the federal court decides that the case was not one in which removal was permissible, it may remand the case to state court. Here, the federal court is not an appellate court as in the case above, and the case was remanded because the removal to the federal court was improper.\n\nIn federal tribunals in the United States, it is possible for an Article III court to remand a case to an Article I court, if the case was originally decided by the Article I court and then appealed to the Article III court, or for a higher-level administrative tribunal within an executive agency to remand a case to a lower-level tribunal within the same agency.\n\nWhile Article III courts are allowed to remand a case back to Article I courts, there is a recent trend towards divesting U.S. magistrate judges from the power to remand cases back to state court. The same statutory basis for divesting magistrate judges of their power to remand may logically be applied to Article I judges.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1793131", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1793131", "title": "Total Recall 2070", "text": "Total Recall 2070\n\nTotal Recall 2070 is a science fiction television series influenced by the work of Philip K. Dick. It was first broadcast in 1999 on the Canadian television channel CHCH-TV and later the same year on the American Showtime channel. It was later syndicated in the United States with some editing to remove scenes of nudity, violence and (in most cases) strong language.\n\nThe series was filmed in Toronto, Ontario. It was a Canadian/German co-production. Only one season, consisting of 22 episodes, was produced.\n\n\"Total Recall 2070\" was created by Art Monterastelli. The series is named after the 1990 film \"Total Recall\", loosely based on Philip K. Dick's short story \"We Can Remember It for You Wholesale\", but it has been noted as sharing no major plot points or characters with it, other than the Rekall company and the concept of virtual vacations. Instead, a much larger influence in its plot elements and especially visual style has been recognized to be the 1982 film \"Blade Runner\", itself a loose adaptation of Dick's novel \"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\". Series creator Art Monterastelli has admitted the stronger influence of \"Blade Runner\" over \"Total Recall\", and explained, he thought doing a paranoid psychological thriller with a strong visual background reminiscent of \"Blade Runner\", would be a better use of their limited budget, provide more creative opportunities to the writers, and even be more in line with the spirit of Dick's antihero storylines as found in his body of work, compared to the \"Total Recall\" action film. Despite the influence of his works to the series production, Dick is not credited on the series main or end titles.\n\nMost of this series was filmed at the Downsview Park studio, at the location of a former Canadian Forces Base in north Toronto. The series futuristic cityscape was created by John Gajdecki and his company Gajdecki Visual Effects, blending computer-generated images with a live-action soundstage set. Two or three levels of entire futuristic environment were constructed for the production and later mixed with the CGI.\n\n\"Total Recall 2070\" takes place in a dark, crowded, industrial and cosmopolitan setting, with a noir sci-fi aesthetic. The government bureaucracy is heavily influenced by a small number of extremely powerful companies called \"the Consortium\" (including computer memory and virtual-reality vacation provider Rekall and android manufacturer Uber Braun). David Hume is a senior detective for the Citizens Protection Bureau (CPB), a police agency focused on general public safety. After his partner is killed by self-aware androids, he is partnered against his wishes with Ian Farve, a naive officer new to the department, who is himself secretly an \"Alpha Class\" android—a model with a more complex psychological nature. Hume and the CPB often have conflicts with the Assessor's Office (the investigative agency that has sole jurisdiction over crimes related to the Consortium) and with the private security forces of Consortium companies. The main story arcs of the series concern the agendas of the Consortium, the mystery of Farve's origins, Hume's wife Olivia, whose memories have been tampered with, and the mysterious manufacturer of Alpha Class androids. Significant plot elements remain unresolved by the end of the series run, due to cancellation; a crucial story arc from the series was the suggestion that the memory expansion used on self-aware androids was part non-human DNA and that a material found by a remote base on Mars could create a hybrid of human and android DNA.\n\n\nBy the year 2070, Earth and Mars (as well as space stations) are ruled by a unified government known as the \"Interplanetary Council\" (IPC). However, much of the real power is held by \"the Consortium\", composed of at least six multi-global companies that financed the colonization of Mars.\n\nThe known six companies are:\n\nIn 1999, the complete series was released on DVD in Japan (in English and dubbed in Japanese). The 2-hour series pilot (\"Machine Dreams\") has been available on region 1 DVD and VHS (Canada and the United States) since 2000. The series was broadcasting in Italy as of 2010 on \"Fantasy\" channel (Sky pay-TV), dubbed in Italian language.\n\nOn February 22, 2011, Alliance Home Entertainment released the complete series for the first time on DVD (uncut) in Canada only.\n\nSince September 2009, the entire 22-episode series (in the censored US versions, and with advertising) has been available in low-resolution Flash Video format via Comcast's official Hulu-based \"FanCast\" streaming video online service. The whole series was also formerly available online through the beta version of the Joost online TV content distribution system.\n\n"}

But some matters of major importance require a particular secrecy, called \"pontifical secrecy\", and must be observed as a grave obligation.\n\nPontifical secrecy is the subject of the instruction \"Secreta continere\" of 4 February 1974 issued by the Secretariat of State. The text is published in \"Acta Apostolicae Sedis\", 1974, pages 89–92.\n\nIts applicability in cases of accusations and trials involving abuse of minors or vulnerable persons and in cases of possession of child pornography by clerics was removed on 17 December 2019. Its use in such cases had been condemned by German Cardinal Reinhard Marx at the Meeting on the Protection of Minors in the Church held in the Vatican from 21 to 24 February 2019.\n\nThe instruction \"Secreta continere\" lists ten classes of matters covered by the pontifical secret:\nThe canon law instruction \"On the confidentiality of legal proceedings\", of 17 December 2019, excluded from the pontifical secret the accusations, trials and decisions in canonical investigations and trial involving:\nAccording to Archibishop Juan Ignacio Arrieta, Secretary of the Pontifical Council for Legislative Texts, the purpose of the Rescript of 17 December 2019 was to:\n\nOn its part, Prof. Giuseppe Dalla Torre, former president of the Vatican City State Tribunal, observed that the lifting of the Pontifical secret was due to the fact that:\n\nAccording to Archbishop Charles Scicluna, adjunct secretary of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, the abolition of pontifical secrecy means that:\nWhile violation of pontifical secrecy, if deliberate, is a grave sin, and while an automatic excommunication may sometimes be imposed for violation of secrecy on particular matters, the general rule is only that, if the violation becomes known outside of Confession, a penalty proportionate to the wrongdoing and the damage caused is to be inflicted.\n\nAn example of the imposition of automatic excommunication for violation of secrecy was found in the 1962 instruction \"Crimen sollicitationis\" (in force until replaced by new norms in 2001), which imposed this penalty on members of a Church tribunal trying a priest accused of making sexual advances to a penitent in connection with the sacrament of Penance, if they violated secrecy about developments in the course of the ecclesiastical trial. A person to whom such advances were made was, on the contrary, subjected to excommunication if that person failed to denounce the priest within at most one month.\n\nThus the procedures of the Church tribunal were covered by papal secrecy (called at that time secrecy of the Holy Office), but the crime of the priest was not: \"These matters are confidential only to the procedures within the Church, but do not preclude in any way for these matters to be brought to civil authorities for proper legal adjudication. The Charter for the Protection of Children and Young People of June, 2002, approved by the Vatican, requires that credible allegations of sexual abuse of children be reported to legal authorities.\".\n\n"}

Even where the seal of confession does not strictly apply – where there is no specific serious sin confessed for the purpose of receiving absolution – priests have a serious obligation not to cause scandal by the way they speak.\n\nCanon 21 of the Fourth Council of the Lateran (1215), binding on the whole church, laid down the obligation of secrecy in the following words:\n\nGratian, who compiled the edicts of previous Catholic Ecumenical Councils and the principles of church law, published the \"Decretum\" about 1151. It includes the following declaration of the law as to the seal of confession: \"Let the priest who dares to make known the sins of his penitent be deposed.\" Gratian goes on to say that the violator of this law should be made a lifelong, ignominious wanderer. Notably, neither the Lateran canon nor the law of the \"Decretum\" purports to enact for the first time the secrecy of confession. The 15th-century English canonist William Lyndwood speaks of two reasons why a priest is bound to keep secret a confession, the first being on account of the sacrament because it is almost (quasi) of the essence of the sacrament to keep secret the confession.\n\nThe \"Summa Theologiae\" devotes one article to the seal of confession, explaining that the seal may not be violated, including regarding matters that might indirectly lead to the seal's violation, not even violated by those who hear the confession. Thomas gives two reasons for the seal's inviolability: the seal is divinely instituted and the seal prevents scandal.\n\nAccording to the Roman Catechism, \"the faithful are to be admonished that there is no reason whatever to apprehend that what is made known in confession will ever be revealed by the priest to anyone, or that by it the penitent can at any time be brought into danger of any sort ... Let the priest, says the great Council of Lateran, take special care, neither by word or sign, nor by any other means whatever, to betray in the least degree the sinner.\"\n\nPope Pius X in his catechism taught that \"the confessor is bound by the seal of confession under the gravest sin and under threat of the severest punishments both temporal and eternal.\"\n\nThe Catechism of the Catholic Church teaches in paragraph 1467:\n\nThe Compendium of the Catechism of the Catholic Church elaborates that a confessor is bound to secrecy.\n\nIn \"Note on the importance of the internal forum and the inviolability of the Sacramental Seal\", the Apostolic Penitentiary explained that the sacramental seal is universally and permanently inviolable as a matter of de fide dogma, and as part of freedom of religion and freedom of conscience, despite civil law.\n\nAccording to Roman Catholic canon law, \"The sacramental seal is inviolable; therefore it is absolutely forbidden for a confessor to betray in any way a penitent in words or in any manner and for any reason.\" The confessor is always an ordained priest, because in the Catholic Church only ordained priests can absolve sins; lay confession is not recognized. Any person who overhears a confession is likewise bound by the seal.\n\nPriests may not reveal what they have learned during confession to anyone, even under the threat of their own death or that of others. Punishment for breaking the seal of the confessional is conferred by the severity of the violation: \"a person who violate directly violates the seal of the confessional (that is: explicitly connects a sin to a penitent) incurs a \"latae sententiae\" excommunication.\" One who breaks the seal \"indirectly\" (that is: through their words and actions make known a particular penitent's sins and somehow connects those sins to the penitent) would be punished according to the \"gravity of the delict\". Both St. John Paul II and Pope Benedict XVI made it a practice to attach a \"latae sentintiae\" excommunication to indirect violations of the seal. Those who are privy to another person's confession either as an interpreter or by accidental circumstance are likewise punished according to the gravity of their delict \"not excluding excommunication\".\n\nIn the Early Modern period, some casuists (Thomas Sanchez, etc.) justified mental reservation, a form of deception which does not involve outright lying, in specific circumstances including when such an action is necessary to protect secrecy under the seal of the confessional. Other casuists considered \"grey areas\" in which it was unclear whether or not the seal was being violated. A priest who says \"I do not know\" is thus to be understood \"I do not know with knowledge outside the Seal of the Confessional\"; St. Thomas Aquinas goes even farther and says that the priest knows the confession \"not as man, but as God knows it\". \n\nThere are limited cases where portions of a confession may be revealed to others, but \"always\" with the penitent's permission and \"always\" without actually revealing the penitent's identity. This is the case, for example, with more serious offenses, as some excommunicable offenses are reserved to the Holy See and their permission to grant absolution must be obtained. In these cases, the priest hearing the confession asks the permission of the penitent to write a petition, using pseudonyms and containing the absolute minimum information necessary, to the bishop or to the Apostolic Penitentiary, the cardinal delegated by the Pope to handle such requests. This request may be forwarded, sealed, through the apostolic delegate or nuncio in a country (the Pope's ambassador), to be guarded by the privilege of a diplomatic pouch.\n\nThe law of different jurisdictions in general requires people under certain circumstances to testify about facts known to them. In many cases, the rule of evidence of confessional privilege forbids judicial inquiry into communications made under the seal of confession.\n\nThere may be conflict between the obligation of confidentiality of confession, and civil law. The Louisiana Supreme Court ruled in 2014 that a priest may be compelled to testify about what he was told in the confessional regarding a particular sexual abuse case, leaving the priest at risk of excommunication if he even confirms that a confession took place, or jail for contempt of court should he refuse to testify. However, the Court later ruled that a priest has no duty to report confidential information heard during a sacramental confession.\n\nJohn of Nepomuk, Mateo Correa Magallanes, Fernando Olmedo Reguera and Pedro Marieluz Garces are martyrs of the seal of the confessional in the Catholic Church, choosing to die rather than violate the seal.\n\n"}

He was a prominent member of the School of Chartres. John of Salisbury, a bishop of Chartres and former student of William's, refers to William as the most talented grammarian after Bernard of Chartres.\n\nHe was born in Conches, Normandy. His teaching activity extended from c. 1120 to 1154, and about the year 1145 he became the tutor of Henry Plantagenet. It is possible, but uncertain, that he was teaching at Chartres before that. Warned by a friend of the danger implied in his Platonic realism as he applied it to theology, he took up the study of Islamic philosophy and physical science. When and where he died is a matter of uncertainty.\n\nWilliam devoted much attention to cosmology and psychology. Having been a student of Bernard of Chartres, he shows the characteristic Humanism, tendency towards Platonism, and taste for natural science which distinguish the \"Chartrains\". He is one of the first of the medieval Christian philosophers to take advantage of Islamic physical and physiological lore, to which he had access in the translations by Constantine the African.\n\nWilliam of St. Thierry, who had encouraged Bernard of Clairvaux to prosecute Abelard, in another letter to Bernard attacked William's \"De philosophia mundi\" for having a modalist view of the Holy Trinity. William in consequence revised some controversial parts in the \"Dragmaticon\".\n\nThere is a good deal of discussion regarding the authorship of the works ascribed to William. It seems probable, however, that he wrote the encyclopedic \"De philosophia mundi\" (or \"Philosophia\") and the related dialogue \"Dragmaticon\", as well as glosses on Plato's \"Timaeus\", on Boethius's \"Consolation of Philosophy\", on Priscian's \"Institutiones grammaticae\", and on Macrobius's \"Commentary on the Dream of Scipio\". He was probably also the author of a lost treatise \"Magna de naturis philosophia\". A work on ethics, the \"Moralium dogma philosophorum\", was attributed to him in the 1920s, but his authorship is now rejected by most scholars.\n\nThe \"De philosophia mundi\" is divided into four books, covering physics, astronomy, geography, meteorology and medicine.\n\nWilliam explains the world as composed of elements (\"elementa\"), which he defines as \"the simplest and minimum part[s] of any body—simple in quality, minimum in quantity\". He identifies the elements with the traditional four elements (fire, air, water, earth) but (following Constantine the African) not as they are perceived, since as such they are neither simple in quality nor minimum in quantity: earth, for example, contains something hot, something cold, something dry and something wet at the same time. Pure elements are not to be perceived, says William, but to be grasped by reason, through an abstract division of the sensible bodies. Each of these pure elements has two of the four basic qualities: earth is cold and dry, water is cold and humid, air is hot and humid and fire is hot and dry. The perceivable elements, called \"elementata\", are made of pure elements: the sensible earth especially of pure earth, the sensible water especially of pure water, and so on.\n\nThe discussion of meteorology includes a description of air becoming less dense and colder as the altitude increases, and William attempts to explain the circulation of the air in connection with the circulation of the oceans. The discussion of medicine deals chiefly with procreation and childbirth. This work influenced Jean de Meung, the author of the second part of the \"Roman de la Rose\".\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1793178", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1793178", "title": "Maple syrup urine disease", "text": "Maple syrup urine disease\n\nMaple syrup urine disease (MSUD) is an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder affecting branched-chain amino acids. It is one type of organic acidemia. The condition gets its name from the distinctive sweet odor of affected infants' urine, particularly prior to diagnosis, and during times of acute illness.\n\nMaple syrup urine disease can be classified by its pattern of signs and symptoms, or by its genetic cause. The most common and severe form of this disease is the classic type, which appears soon after birth, and as long as it remains untreated, gives rise to progressive and unremitting symptoms. Variant forms of the disorder may become apparent only later in infancy or childhood, with typically less severe symptoms that may only appear during times of fasting, stress or illness, but still involve mental and physical problems if left untreated.\n\nSub-divisions of MSUD:\n\n\nGenerally, majority of patients will be classified into one of these four categories but some patients affected by MSUD do not fit the criteria for the listed sub-divisions and will be deemed unclassified MSUD.\n\nThe disease is named for the presence of sweet-smelling urine, similar to maple syrup, when the person goes into metabolic crisis. Along with the smell being present in ear wax of an affected individual during metabolic crisis. In populations to whom maple syrup is unfamiliar, the aroma can be likened to fenugreek, and fenugreek ingestion may impart the aroma to urine.\nSymptoms of MSUD varies between patients and is greatly related to the amount of residual enzyme activity. \n\nInfants with classic MSUD will display subtle symptoms within 2-3 days. Subtle symptoms include poor feeding, either bottle or breast, lethargy, and irritability. The infant will then experience increased focal neurologic signs. These neurologic signs include athetoid, hypertonia, spasticity, and opisthotonus that lead to convulsions and coma. If MSUD is left untreated, central neurologic function and respiratory failure will occur and lead to death.\nAlthough MSUD can be stabilized, there are still threats of metabolic decompensation and loss bone mass that can lead to osteoporosis, pancreatitis, and intracranial hypertension. Other signs and symptoms associated with classic MSUD include intellectual limitation and behavioral issues.\n\nIntermediate MSUD has greater levels of residual enzyme activity than classic MSUD. The majority of children with intermediate MSUD are diagnosed between the ages of 5 months and 7 years. Symptoms associated with classic MSUD also appear in intermediate MSUD.\n\nContrary to classic and intermediate MSUD, intermittent MSUD individuals will have normal growth and intellectual development. Symptoms of lethargy and characterized odor of maple syrup will occur when the individual experiences stress, does not eat, or develops an infection. Metabolic crisis leading to seizures, coma, and brain damage is still a possibility.\n\nSymptoms associated with thiamine-response MSUD are similar to intermediate MSUD. Newborns rarely present with symptoms.\n\nThe symptoms of MSUD may also present later depending on the severity of the disease. Untreated in older individuals, and during times of metabolic crisis, symptoms of the condition include uncharacteristically inappropriate, extreme or erratic behaviour and moods, hallucinations, lack of appetite, weight loss, anemia, diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration, lethargy, oscillating hypertonia and hypotonia, ataxia, seizures, hypoglycaemia, ketoacidosis, opisthotonus, pancreatitis, rapid neurological decline, and coma. Death from cerebral edema will likely occur if there is no treatment. Additionally, MSUD patients experience an abnormal course of diseases in simple infections that can lead to permanent damage.\n\nMutations in the following genes cause maple syrup urine disease:\n\n\nThese four genes produce proteins that work together as the branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase complex. The complex is essential for breaking down the amino acids leucine, isoleucine, and valine. These are present in some quantity in almost all kinds of food, but in particular, protein-rich foods such as dairy products, meat, fish, soy, gluten, eggs, nuts, whole grains, seeds, avocados, algae, edible seaweed, beans, and pulses. Mutation in any of these genes reduces or eliminates the function of the enzyme complex, preventing the normal breakdown of isoleucine, leucine, and valine. As a result, these amino acids and their by-products build up in the body. Because high levels of these substances are toxic to the brain and other organs, this accumulation leads to the serious medical problems associated with maple syrup urine disease.\nThis condition has an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern, which means the defective gene is located on an autosome, and two copies of the gene – one from each parent – must be inherited to be affected by the disorder. The parents of a child with an autosomal recessive disorder are carriers of one copy of the defective gene, but are usually not affected by the disorder.\n\nMSUD is a metabolic disorder caused by a deficiency of the branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase complex (BCKAD), leading to a buildup of the branched-chain amino acids (leucine, isoleucine, and valine) and their toxic by-products (ketoacids) in the blood and urine.The buildup of these BCAAS will lead to the maple syrup odor that is associated with MSUD. The BCKAD complex begins by breaking down leucine, isoleucine, and valine through the use of branch-chain aminotransferase into their relevant α-ketoacids. The second step involves the conversion of α-ketoacids into acetoacetate, acetyl-CoA, and succunyl-CoA through oxidative decarboxylation of α-ketoacids. The BCKAD complex consists of four subunits designated Eα, Eβ, E, and E. The E subunit is also a component of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex and oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex. MSUD can result from mutations in any of the genes that code for these enzyme subunits, Eα, Eβ, E, and E. Mutations of these enzyme subunits will lead to the BCKAD complex unable to break down leucine, isoleucine, and valine. The levels of these branched chain amino acids will become elevated and lead to the symptoms associated with MSUD. Glutamate levels are maintained in the brain by BCAA metabolism functions and if not properly maintained can lead to neurological problems that are seen in MSUD individuals. High levels of leucine has also been shown to affect water homeostasis within subcortical gray matter leading to cerebral edema, which occurs is MSUD patients if left untreated.\n\nPrior to the easy availability of plasma amino acid measurement, diagnosis was commonly made based on suggestive symptoms and odor. Affected individuals are now often identified with characteristic elevations on plasma amino acids which do not have the characteristic odor. The compound responsible for the odor is sotolon (sometimes spelled sotolone).\nOn 9 May 2014, the UK National Screening Committee (UK NSC) announced its recommendation to screen every newborn baby in the UK for four further genetic disorders as part of its NHS Newborn Blood Spot Screening programme, including maple syrup urine disease. The disease is estimated to affect 1 out of 185,000 infants worldwide and its frequency increases with certain heritages.\n\nNewborn screening for maple syrup urine disease involves analyzing the blood of 1–2 day-old newborns through tandem mass spectrometry. The blood concentration of leucine and isoleucine is measured relative to other amino acids to determine if the newborn has a high level of branched-chain amino acids. Once the newborn is 2–3 days old the blood concentration of branched-chain amino acids like leucine is greater than 1000 µmol/L and alternative screening methods are used. Instead, the newborn's urine is analyzed for levels of branched-chain alpha-hydroxyacids and alpha-ketoacids.\nThe amount and type of enzyme activity in an affected individual with MSUD will determine which classification the affected individual will identify with. \n<br>\nClassic MSUD: Less than 2% of normal enzyme activity\n<br>\nIntermediate MSUD: 3-8% normal enzyme activity\n<br>\nIntermittent MSUD: 8-15% of normal enzyme activity\n<br>\nThiamine-Responsive MSUD: Large doses of thiamine will increase enzyme activity.\n\nThere are no methods for preventing the manifestation of the pathology of MSUD in infants with two defective copies of the BCKD gene. However, genetic counselors may consult with couples to screen for the disease via DNA testing. DNA testing is also available to identify the disease in an unborn child in the womb.\n\nKeeping MSUD under control requires careful monitoring of blood chemistry, both at home and in a hospital setting. DNPH or specialised dipsticks may be used to test the patient's urine for ketones (a sign of metabolic decompensation), when metabolic stress is likely or suspected. Fingerstick tests are performed regularly and sent to a laboratory to determine blood levels of leucine, isoleucine, and valine. Regular metabolic consultations, including blood-draws for full nutritional analysis, are recommended; especially during puberty and periods of rapid growth. MSUD management also involves a specially tailored metabolic formula, a modified diet, and lifestyle precautions such as avoiding fatigue and infections, as well as consuming regular, sufficient calories in proportion to physical stress and exertion. Without sufficient calories, catabolism of muscle protein will result in metabolic crisis. Those with MSUD must be hospitalised for intravenous infusion of sugars and nasogastric drip-feeding of formula, in the event of metabolic decompensation, or lack of appetite, diarrhea or vomiting. Food avoidance, rejection of formula and picky eating are all common problems with MSUD. Some patients may need to receive all or part of their daily nutrition through a feeding tube.\n\nA diet with carefully controlled levels of the amino acids leucine, isoleucine, and valine must be maintained at all times in order to prevent neurological damage. Since these three amino acids occur in all natural protein, and most natural foods contain some protein, any food intake must be closely monitored, and day-to-day protein intake calculated on a cumulative basis, to ensure individual tolerance levels are not exceeded at any time. As the MSUD diet is so protein-restricted, and adequate protein is a requirement for all humans, tailored metabolic formula containing all the other essential amino acids, as well as any vitamins, minerals, omega-3 fatty acids and trace elements (which may be lacking due to the limited range of permissible foods), are an essential aspect of MSUD management. These complement the MSUD patient's natural food intake to meet normal nutritional requirements without causing harm. If adequate calories cannot be obtained from natural food without exceeding protein tolerance, specialised low protein products such as starch-based baking mixtures, imitation rice and pasta may be prescribed, often alongside a protein-free carbohydrate powder added to food and/or drink, and increased at times of metabolic stress. MSUD patients with thiamine- responsive MSUD can have a higher protein intake diet with administration of high doses of thiamine, a cofactor of the enzyme that causes the condition. The typical dosage amount of thiamine-responsive MSUD depends on the enzyme activity present and can range from 10mg - 100mg daily.\n\nUsually MSUD patients are monitored by a dietitian. Liver transplantation is another treatment option that can completely and permanently normalise metabolic function, enabling discontinuation of nutritional supplements and strict monitoring of biochemistry and caloric intake, relaxation of MSUD-related lifestyle precautions, and an unrestricted diet. This procedure is most successful when performed at a young age, and weaning from immunosuppressants may even be possible in the long run. However, the surgery is a major undertaking requiring extensive hospitalisation and rigorous adherence to a tapering regimen of medications. Following transplant, the risk of periodic rejection will always exist, as will the need for some degree of lifelong monitoring in this respect. Despite normalising clinical presentation, liver transplantation is not considered a cure for MSUD. The patient will still carry two copies of the mutated BKAD gene in each of their own cells, which will consequently still be unable to produce the missing enzyme. They will also still pass one mutated copy of the gene on to each of their biological children. As a major surgery the transplant procedure itself also carries standard risks, although the odds of its success are greatly elevated when the only indication for it is an inborn error of metabolism. In absence of a liver transplant, the MSUD diet must be adhered to strictly and permanently. However, in both treatment scenarios, with proper management, those afflicted are able to live healthy, normal lives without suffering the severe neurological damage associated with the disease.\n\nControl of metabolism is vital during pregnancy of women with MSUD. To prevent detrimental abnormalities in development of the embryo or fetus, dietary adjustments should be made and plasma amino acid concentrations of the mother should be observed carefully and frequently. Amino acid deficiency can be detected through fetal growth, making it essential to monitor development closely.\n\nIf left untreated, MSUD will lead to death due to central neurological function failure and respiratory failure. Early detection, diet low in branched-chain amino acids, and close monitoring of blood chemistry can lead to a good prognosis with little or no abnormal developments. Even with proper treatment, metabolic crisis is still likely to occur and can lead to death without immediate medical treatment.\n\nMaple syrup urine disease (MSUD) is a rare, inherited metabolic disorder. Its prevalence in the United States population is approximately 1 newborn out of 180,000 live births. However, in populations where there is a higher frequency of consanguinity, such as the Mennonites in Pennsylvania or the Amish, the frequency of MSUD is significantly higher at 1 newborn out of 176 live births. In Austria, 1 newborn out of 250,000 live births inherits MSUD. It also is believed to have a higher prevalence in certain populations due in part to the founder effect since MSUD has a much higher prevalence in children of Amish, Mennonite, and Jewish descent.\n\nGene therapy to overcome genetic mutations cause MSUD has already been proven safe in animals studies with MSUD. The gene therapy involves a healthy copy of the gene causing MSUD is produced and inserted into a viral vector. The adeno-associated virus vector is delivered one-time to the patient intravenously. Hepatocytes will take up vector and functional copies of the affected gene is MSUD patients will be expressed. This will allow BCAA to be broken down properly and prevent toxic build up.\n\nSodium phenylacetate/benzoate or sodium phenylbutyrate has been shown to reduce BCAA in a clinical trial done February 2011. Phenylbutyrate treatment reduced the blood concentration of BCAA and their corresponding BCKA in certain groups of MSUD patients and may be a possible adjunctive treatment.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1793201", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1793201", "title": "Colestyramine", "text": "Colestyramine\n\nColestyramine (INN) or cholestyramine (USAN) (trade names Questran, Questran Light, Cholybar, Olestyr) is a bile acid sequestrant, which binds bile in the gastrointestinal tract to prevent its reabsorption. It is a strong ion exchange resin, which means it can exchange its chloride anions with anionic bile acids in the gastrointestinal tract and bind them strongly in the resin matrix. The functional group of the anion exchange resin is a quaternary ammonium group attached to an inert styrene-divinylbenzene copolymer.\n\nColestyramine removes bile acids from the body by forming insoluble complexes with bile acids in the intestine, which are then excreted in the feces. As a result of this loss of bile acids, more plasma cholesterol is converted to bile acids in the liver to normalise levels. This conversion of cholesterol into bile acids lowers plasma cholesterol levels.\n\nBile acid sequestrants such as colestyramine were first used to treat hypercholesterolemia, but since the introduction of statins, now have only a minor role for this indication. They can also be used to treat the pruritus, or itching, that often occurs during liver failure and other types of cholestasis where the ability to eliminate bile acids is reduced.\n\nColestyramine is commonly used to treat diarrhea resulting from bile acid malabsorption. It was first used for this in Crohn's disease patients who had undergone ileal resection. The terminal portion of the small bowel (ileum) is where bile acids are reabsorbed. When this section is removed, the bile acids pass into the large bowel and cause diarrhea due to stimulation of chloride/fluid secretion by the colonocytes resulting in a secretory diarrhea. Colestyramine prevents this increase in water by making the bile acids insoluble and osmotically inactive.\n\nColestyramine is also used in the control of other types of bile acid diarrhea. The primary, idiopathic form of bile acid diarrhea is a common cause of chronic functional diarrhea, often misdiagnosed as diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D), and most of these patients respond to colestyramine. It is beneficial in the treatment of postcholecystectomy syndrome chronic diarrhea. Colestyramine is also useful in treating post-vagotomy diarrhea.\n\nColestyramine can be helpful in the treatment of \"Clostridium difficile\" infections, to absorb toxins A and B, and reduce the diarrhea and the other symptoms these toxins cause. However, because it is not an anti-infective, it is used in concert with vancomycin.\n\nIt is also used in the \"wash out\" procedure in patients taking leflunomide or teriflunomide to aid drug elimination in the case of drug discontinuation due to severe side effects caused by leflunomide or teriflunomide.\n\nA case report suggests that colestyramine may be useful for cyanobacterial (microcystin) poisoning in dogs.\n\nOintments containing colestyramine compounded with aquaphor have been used in topical treatment of diaper rash in infants and toddlers.\n\nCholestyramine also binds with oxalate in the GI tract, ultimately reducing urine oxalate and calcium oxalate stone formation.\n\nColestyramine is available as powder form, in 4-g packets, or in larger canisters. In the United States, it can be purchased either as a generic medicine, or as Questran or Questran Light (Bristol-Myers Squibb).\n\nA typical dose is 4 to 8 g once or twice daily, with a maximum dose of 24 g/d.\n\nThese side effects have been noted: \n\nIntestinal obstruction has been reported in patients with previous bowel surgery who should use colestyramine cautiously.\n\nPatients with hypothyroidism, diabetes, nephrotic syndrome, dysproteinemia, obstructive liver disease, kidney disease, or alcoholism should consult their doctor before taking this medication. Other drugs should be taken at least one hour before or four to six hours after colestyramine to reduce possible interference with absorption. Patients with phenylketonuria should consult with a physician before taking Questran Light because that product contains phenylalanine.\n\nInteractions with these drugs have been noted:\n\nMost interactions are due to the risk of decreased absorption of these drugs. The duration of treatment is not limited, but the prescribing physician should reassess at regular intervals if continued treatment is still necessary. The principal overdose risk is blockage of intestine or stomach.\n\nColestyramine may interfere in the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins such as vitamins A, D, E, and K. No special considerations regarding alcohol consumption are made.\n\n"}

There is some evidence, but no certainty, that he also taught at the University of Paris, perhaps lecturing there too on the \"Sentences\". He was known as the \"Doctor Fundatus\" (established doctor) and less commonly the \"Doctor Praeclarus\" (very clear doctor).\n\nOnly one work can reliably be attributed to him, a commentary on the \"Sentences\" which survives in many manuscripts: only small parts have been edited, by the Franciscans of Quaracchi (1904), and by A. Daniels (1909, 1913), P. Muscat (1927), J.-M. Bissen (1927), and L. Hödl (1990). William does not try to discuss every distinction, but concentrates on the topics he finds most important, devoting over 100 questions to book 1 and just 129 to the remaining three books. Among the theologians whose views William discusses are Henry of Ghent, Godfrey of Fontaines, Giles of Rome, and Richard of Middleton.\n\nTraditionally William has been assumed to be the master of Duns Scotus.

Born on the university campus, he graduated from Bob Jones Academy. In 1992 he received a bachelor's degree in public speaking from BJU and in 1996, a Master of Divinity. On the day he became University president in 2005, Jones also received a Ph.D. in Liberal Arts Studies from BJU. Jones's wife, Erin Rodman Jones, who is the Director of the BJU Museum & Gallery, is also a BJU graduate. They have three children.\n\nBefore becoming president, Jones served BJU as a teaching assistant, a residence hall supervisor, and the vice president for administration. Stephen Jones is the son of Bob Jones III, the grandson of Bob Jones Jr., and the great-grandson of Bob Jones Sr, the university's founder. Originally Stephen Jones hoped his older brother, Bob IV, would \"take the administrative side of the presidency\" allowing Stephen to concentrate on the \"preaching, traveling, [and] people side\" of the position; but his brother left the university to become a freelance writer. Like his father and grandfather before him, Jones took numerous roles in university plays and productions.\n\nJones underwent a brief period of rebellion against his heritage and his parents' religious standards during his freshman year of high school, such as having a few hidden rock recordings—prohibited on the BJU campus—which he confessed to his father. \"I thought he'd fly off the handle, but he didn't,\" Jones said. \"Dad was very straightforward, but very forgiving and very supportive.\" The worst part was having others on campus learn about the demerits he received for the incident. \"I was always the good boy, and it hurt when it came out.\"\n\nStephen Jones serves on the boards of Gospel Fellowship Association (GFA), Jesus Saves Mission - USA, Fundamental Baptist Fellowship International, Evangelism Foundation, Inc., The Wilds Christian Camp and the Greenville Symphony Orchestra. Early in his administration BJU was granted full accreditation by the Transnational Association of Christian Colleges and Schools.\n\nWhen, in 2005, he was asked by \"Newsweek\" if he wished to play a political role as had his predecessors at BJU, Jones replied, \"It would not be my choice.\" Further, when asked if he felt ideologically closer to his father's engagement with politics or to other evangelicals who have tried to avoid civic involvement, he answered, \"The gospel is for individuals. The main message we have is to individuals. We're not here to save the culture.\" In a 2005 \"Washington Post\" interview, Jones dodged political questions and even admitted that he was embarrassed by \"some of the more vitriolic comments\" made by his predecessors. \"I don't want to get specific,\" he said, \"But there were things said back then that I wouldn't say today.\" In October 2007 when Bob Jones III, as \"a private citizen,\" endorsed Mitt Romney for the Republican nomination for president, Stephen Jones made it clear that he wished \"to stay out of politics\" and that neither he nor the University had endorsed anyone. In April 2008 he told a reporter, \"I don't think I have a political bone in my body.\"\n\nIn the fall of 2010, Jones was \"nearly incapacitated\" after suffering a severely damaged nerve due to an ear infection; he took extended medical leave after experiencing persistent nausea, dizziness, and migraines. During this period, he was \"never fully disconnected,\" though sometimes he could only work a few hours a week. After spending three weeks at the Cleveland Clinic Pain Management Center in the summer of 2012, Jones returned to work, telling a reporter that his time of illness \"grew the university family. Everyone came together in a humbling way.\" Nevertheless, citing \"persistence of my health issues,\" Jones resigned from the presidency of BJU on December 13, 2013 and was succeeded by Steve Pettit on May 10, 2014.\n\n"}

It was released in the US in December 1967 (Epic Records L2N 6071 (monaural) / B2N 171 (stereo)) and in the UK on 16 April 1968 (Pye Records NPL 20000 (monaural) / NSPL 20000 (stereo)). In December 1967, Epic Records also released each of the two records from \"A Gift From a Flower to a Garden\" as separate albums in the US. The first record was released as \"Wear Your Love Like Heaven\", and the second record was released as \"For Little Ones\". This was done to allow budgeting for the double album package, which included a folder of the printed lyrics to the second disc with artwork, and a cover featuring an infrared photo of Donovan by Karl Ferris who was his and Jimi Hendrix's personal photographer (requiring six colour separations for printing, instead of the usual four separations).\n\nAfter recording the \"Mellow Yellow\" album, Donovan focused on releasing hit singles. \"Epistle to Dippy\" (essentially an inside-joke/open letter for a childhood friend) hit the top 20 in February 1967 and \"There is a Mountain\" (#11 US; #8 UK) followed in August.\n\nRiding high on the success of these singles, Donovan entered the studio in October to record his next album. The double album that resulted from these sessions consisted of one disc of electric pop music (\"Wear Your Love Like Heaven\") and another of acoustic children's music (\"For Little Ones\"). The acoustic album allowed Donovan to present a facet of his songwriting that had not been featured on his singles. It also allowed him to show his strength as a guitar player and performer in a way that he could not when augmented by session musicians. In fact, Donovan's live performances of the time featured instrumentation and performances more in line with \"For Little Ones\" than his hit singles and the first record of \"A Gift From a Flower to a Garden\".\n\nWhile Mickie Most produced the single from the album (\"Wear Your Love Like Heaven\" b/w \"Oh Gosh\"), and is credited with the album's production, Donovan actually produced the bulk of the material himself, allowing Most the credit to help sales.\n\nIn the album's liner notes, Donovan explained his purpose in creating two rather different discs (one for the present generation, and the other for the \"dawning generation\"), and also denounced the use of drugs. Several of his earlier records had contained both veiled and open references to drug use (particularly marijuana and LSD), but since the release of \"Mellow Yellow\", he had both been arrested and prosecuted for marijuana possession, and had seen people he knew turning to harder drugs (speed, heroin, cocaine), and the damage this caused in their lives. Instead, Donovan promoted the use of meditation and other techniques, in his new songs.\n\n\"Mad John's Escape\" is a song written for a friend of Donovan's who escaped from a mental health centre. The song details Mad John's escape and subsequent adventures.\n\n\"Under the Greenwood Tree\" was originally written by William Shakespeare in \"As You Like It\", and set to music by Donovan for the Royal National Theatre, who planned to use it in a stage production. At the end of the song, Donovan sings \"Will you, won't you... join the dance?\" in reference to the chorus of \"The Lobster Quadrille\" in Chapter X of Lewis Carroll's \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\".\n\n\"Epistle to Derroll\" is dedicated to the banjo player and singer Derroll Adams, an early influence on Donovan.\n\nThe front cover photo design of \"Wear Your Love Like Heaven\" features a Pre-Raphaelite style infrared photograph of Donovan on the moat in front of Bodiam Castle by Karl Ferris who was his and Jimi Hendrix's personal photographer. The back cover photo was also a shot taken by Ferris in LA during Donovan's and Karl's initiation into Transcendental Meditation, and depicted Donovan visiting with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi.\n\nThe album earned a Gold Record award, for half a million sales, during 1970.\n\nAll tracks by Donovan Leitch, except where noted.\n\nSide 1\n\nSide 2\n\nSide 1\n\nSide 2\n\n\n\n"}

She was the sole surviving nurse of the Bangka Island Massacre, when the Japanese killed 21 of her fellow nurses on Radji Beach, Bangka Island, in the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia) on 16 February 1942.\n\nVivian Bullwinkel was born on 18 December 1915 in Kapunda, South Australia, to George Albert and Eva Bullwinkel (née Shegog). She had a brother, John. She trained as a nurse and midwife at Broken Hill, New South Wales, and began her nursing career in Hamilton, Victoria, before moving to the Jessie McPherson Hospital in Melbourne.\n\nIn 1941, wanting to enlist for service in the Second World War, Bullwinkel volunteered as a nurse with the Royal Australian Air Force but was rejected for having flat feet. She was, however, able to join the Australian Army Nursing Service; assigned to the 2/13th Australian General Hospital (2/13th AGH), in September 1941 she sailed for Singapore. After a few weeks with the 2/10th AGH, Bullwinkel rejoined the 13th AGH in Johor Baharu.\n\nJapanese troops invaded Malaya in December 1941 and began to advance southwards, winning a series of victories. By late January 1942 they were advancing through Johore and the 13th AGH was to evacuate to Singapore. A short-lived defence of the island ended in defeat, and, on 12 February, Bullwinkel and 65 other nurses boarded the SS \"Vyner Brooke\" to escape.\n\nTwo days later, the ship was sunk by Japanese aircraft. Bullwinkel, 21 other nurses and a large group of men, women, and children made it ashore at Radji Beach on Banka Island. Others on board either went down with the ship or were swept away and never seen again. The group were joined the next day by others making a total of about 100 including about twenty English soldiers from another ship sunk earlier. They elected to surrender to the Japanese. An officer from the \"Vyner Brooke\" walked to Muntok, a town on the north-west of the island, to contact the Japanese. While he was away Matron Irene Drummond, the most senior of the Australian nurses, suggested that civilian women and children should start off walking towards Muntok.\n\nIn an action that later became known as the Banka Island Massacre, Japanese soldiers came and killed the men, then motioned the nurses to wade into the sea. They then machine-gunned the nurses from behind. Bullwinkel was struck by a bullet which passed completely through her body, missing her internal organs, and feigned death until the Japanese soldiers left. She hid with British Army Private Cecil George Kingsley of the Royal Army Ordnance Corps for 12 days, tending to his severe wounds, only then realizing the extent of her own wound, before being captured. They were taken into captivity, but Kingsley died soon after from his injuries, which included a gunshot wound in his abdomen.\n\nRecent evidence collected by historian Lynette Silver, broadcaster Tess Lawrence and biographer Barbara Angell, indicates that Bullwinkel and \"most of\" the nurses were sexually assaulted before they were murdered. However, Bullwinkel was \"gagged\" by the Australian government from speaking about the rapes at the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal in 1946.\n\nBullwinkel was reunited with survivors of the \"Vyner Brooke\". She told them of the massacre, but none spoke of it again until after the war lest it put Bullwinkel, as witness to the massacre, in danger. Bullwinkel spent three and half years in captivity, together with Betty Jeffrey, Wilma Oram and Margaret Dryburgh; Dryburgh, the eldest, died in captivity around the age of 55. Another surviving nurse was Pat Darling, who died in 2007.\n\nVivian retired from the army in 1947 and became Director of Nursing at the Fairfield Infectious Diseases Hospital. Also in 1947 she gave evidence of the massacre at a war crimes trial in Tokyo. She devoted herself to the nursing profession and to honouring those killed on Bangka Island, raising funds for a nurses' memorial and serving on numerous committees, including a period as a member of the Council of the Australian War Memorial, and later president of the Australian College of Nursing.\n\nBullwinkel married Colonel Francis West Statham in September 1977, changing her name to Vivian Statham. She returned to Bangka Island in 1992 to unveil a shrine to the nurses who had not survived the war. She died of a heart attack on 3 July 2000, aged 84, in Perth, Western Australia.\n\nIn 2001 Bullwinkel was inducted posthumously to the Victorian Honour Roll of Women.\n\nThe Vivian Bullwinkel Wing at Hollywood Private Hospital, Perth (the former Repatriation General Hospital, Hollywood) was renamed in her honour.\n\nThe Royal Australian Air Force Association runs the Vivian Bullwinkel Lodge aged care facility in the northern suburbs of Perth.\n\nMonash University (Melbourne) and Eastern Health (Melbourne) have named the chair in palliative care nursing after her.\n\nNorthern Melbourne Institute of TAFE redeveloped the old nurses quarters on its Fairfield campus in 2010 for residential student accommodation. A common room is named after Vivian Bullwinkel, who was the Director of Nursing for many years at the Fairfield Hospital.\n\n"}

His 1919 book, \"Geometrische Kristallographie des Diskontinuums\", played a seminal role in the refinement of space group theory. In this book, Niggli demonstrated that although X-ray reflection conditions do not always uniquely determine the space group to which a crystal belongs, they do reveal a small number of possible space groups to which it could belong. Niggli used morphological methods to account for internal structure and, in his 1928 \"Kristallographische und Strukturtheoretische Grundbegriffe,\" he took up what is essentially the reverse process, the task of establishing the connection between space lattices and external crystal morphology. The great aim of his life was to integrate the whole field of Earth sciences.\n\nIn 1920, Niggli became the lead scientist at the ETH's \"Institut für Mineralogie und Petrographie\", where he brought his systematic approach to the study of crystal morphologies using X-ray diffraction. In 1935, Niggli and his doctoral student Werner Nowacki (1909–1988) determined the 73 three-dimensional arithmetic crystal classes (symmorphic space groups). Niggli retired from the Institute in 1949. He was also professor of mineralogy at the Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule and at the University of Zurich.\n\nNiggli succeeded Paul Heinrich von Groth (1843–1927) as editor of \"Zeitschrift für Kristallographie\".\n\nIn 1948, Niggli was awarded the Roebling Medal of the Mineralogical Society of America.\n\nSince 1988 the Paul Niggli Foundation awards medals to outstanding Swiss mineral scientists below the age of 35 with a strong perspective for an academic career.\n\nDorsum Niggli on the Moon was named after him.\n"}

{"id": "1793236", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1793236", "title": "Convoy (song)", "text": "Convoy (song)\n\n\"Convoy\" is a 1975 novelty song performed by C. W. McCall (a character co-created and voiced by Bill Fries, along with Chip Davis) that became a number-one song on both the country and pop charts in the US and is listed 98th among Rolling Stone magazine's 100 Greatest Country Songs of All Time. Written by McCall and Chip Davis, the song spent six weeks at number one on the country charts and one week at number one on the pop charts. The song went to number one in Canada as well, hitting the top of the \"RPM\" Top Singles Chart on January 24, 1976. \"Convoy\" also peaked at number two in the UK. The song capitalized on the fad for citizens band (CB) radio. The song was the inspiration for the 1978 Sam Peckinpah film \"Convoy\".\n\nThe song consists of three types of interspersed dialogue: a simulated CB conversation with CB slang, the narration of the story, and the chorus. It is about a fictional trucker rebellion that drives from the West Coast to the East Coast of the United States without stopping. What they are protesting (other than the 55 mph speed limit, then recently introduced in response to the 1973 oil crisis) is shown by lines such as \"we tore up all of our swindle sheets\" (CB slang for log sheets used to record driving hours; the term referred to the practice of falsifying entries to show that drivers were getting proper sleep when, in reality, the drivers were driving more than the prescribed number of hours before mandatory rest) and \"left 'em settin' on the scales\" (CB slang for US Department of Transportation weigh stations on Interstates and highways to verify the weight of the truck and the drivers' hours of working through log books). The song also refers to toll roads: \"We just ain't a-gonna pay no toll.\" Also putting the \"hammer\" or accelerator pedal down means speeding up and breaking the speed limit. (An album compilation of \"trucking songs\" was entitled \"Put the Hammer Down\".)\n\nThe conversation is between \"Rubber Duck\", \"Pig Pen\", and \"Sodbuster\", primarily through Rubber Duck's side of the conversation. The narration and CB chatter are by McCall.\n\nAt the beginning of the song, a \"Kenworth pulling logs\", driven by Rubber Duck, is the \"front door\" (the leader) of three semi-trailer trucks (tractor and semi-trailer) when he realizes they have a convoy. Following the Rubber Duck is an unnamed trucker in a \"cab-over Pete with a reefer on\" (a refrigerated trailer hauled by a Peterbilt truck configured with the cab over the engine), while Pig Pen brings up the rear (the \"back door\") in a \"'Jimmy' haulin' hogs\" (GMC truck with a livestock semi-trailer loaded with live pigs).\n\nThe convoy begins toward \"Flagtown\" (Flagstaff, Arizona) at night on June 6 on \"I-one-oh\" (I-10) just outside \"Shakeytown\" (Los Angeles, California). By the time they get to \"Tulsatown\" (Tulsa, Oklahoma), there are 85 trucks and the \"bears / Smokeys\" (state police, specifically the highway patrol, who commonly wear the same campaign hats as the United States Forest Service mascot Smokey Bear) have set up a road block and have a \"bear in the air\" (police helicopter). By the time they get to \"Chi-town\" (Chicago, Illinois), the convoy includes a driver with the handle \"Sodbuster\", a \"suicide jockey\" (truck hauling explosives), and \"11 long-haired friends of Jesus\" (a reference to the then-current Jesus movement subset of Christianity) in a chartreuse VW Type 2 (\"microbus\"). Meanwhile, the police have called out \"reinforcements from the 'Illi-noise' (Illinois) National Guard\" and have filled the \"chicken coops\" (weigh stations). The convoy crashes another road block when crossing a toll bridge into New Jersey, and by this time they have \"a thousand screamin' trucks\" in all.\n\nThe song's running gag has Rubber Duck complaining about the smell of the hogs that Pig Pen is hauling. He repeatedly asks the offending driver to \"back off\" (slow down). By the end, Pig Pen has fallen so far back, when Rubber Duck is in New Jersey, Pig Pen has only reached Omaha, Nebraska (a reference to the headquarters of American Gramaphone, which released the song, and also a reference to the slaughterhouses for which Omaha is famous). Also, Omaha was C.W. McCall's \"home 20\" (a reference to the ten-code for location).\n\nMcCall's \"'Round the World with the Rubber Duck\" is the sequel to \"Convoy\". In this continuation, the convoy leaves the U.S. and travels around the world, through Britain, France, West and East Germany, the USSR, Japan, and Australia.\n\n\nThe song was covered in 2004 by Paul Brandt. The video features Brandt and fellow country singers Jason McCoy and Aaron Lines as well as then Calgary Flames defencemen Mike Commodore and Rhett Warrener as truckers and George Canyon, of \"Nashville Star\" fame, as the highway patrol officer. The video was seen on CMT in both Canada and the United States. It was filmed at CFB/ASU Wainwright on Airfield 21. The song appears on the 2004 album \"This Time Around\".\n\nBrandt also recorded a Christmas version called \"Christmas Convoy\", which appears on the 2006 holiday album \"A Gift\". In this version, the convoy helps Santa deliver his toys after a bad storm.\n\n"}

{"id": "1793241", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1793241", "title": "Adelaide, Abbess of Vilich", "text": "Adelaide, Abbess of Vilich\n\nAdelaide, Abbess of Vilich (c.970 – 5 February 1015(?), her date of birth and death are controversial), also known as Adelheid, was the abbess of and also of St. Maria im Kapitol in Cologne; she was declared a saint post mortem. After her death she was remembered for the miracles that were ascribed to her. Her parents were Megingoz, count of Guelders, and Gerberga, who was a descendant of Henry I. They were also the founders of the convent at Vilich. The main source for her life is the hagriographical work \"Vita Adelheidis\".\n\nAdelaide was born around 970, youngest daughter of Megengoz, Count of Geldern, and his wife Gerberga. As a child, she was given to the convent of St. Ursula in Cologne, probably before 977, where she was educated according to the Rule of St Jerome, and engaged in philosophical studies, according to her Vita. When her older brother Godfrey died in battle in 977, her parents began funding the construction of a church in his honour at Vilich (today part of Bonn-Beuel) and worked to establish a female monastic community following the rule of the observances of the canonesses. As part of this process they redeemed their daughter from St Ursula with a gift of land and established her as abbess of the newly founded community at Vilich. \n\nTo determine Vilich‘s legal position in the empire, her parents appealed to emperor Otto III in 987 to obtain a charter granting Vilich the same legal status as the imperial convents of Gandersheim, Quedlinburg, and Essen. This charter was confirmed by a papal bull from Pope Gregory VI, dated 24 May 996. \n\nDue the death of her mother Geberga in c.995, Adelaide was forced to lead the convent by herself. She used this position of power to change the rule of Vilich to the Rule of Saint Benedict despite some canonesses of the convent resisting this change and leaving Vilich. Three years after Gerberga’s death, Adelaide’s father Megengoz died as well. He was buried alongside his wife at Vilich. Adelaide inherited a large part of the family wealth. Some of it was used to buy land for the convent while the remaining funds were given to the poor in a charitable act.\n\nIn c.1000, Adelaide’s sister Bertrada, abbess of St Mary in the Capitol died. Archbishop Heribert of Cologne expressed wishes for Adelaide to assume responsibility for the abbey. Initially, Adelaide declined the offer allegedly due to the distance between Vilich and St Mary in the Capitol. Despite this, Archbishop Heribert of Cologne managed to enforce his wish by contacting the emperor in Aachen. It is not clear from the \"Vita Adelheidis\" if this had been emperor Otto III or Henry II. Adelaide was subsequently called to the court and confirmed as abbess of St Mary in the Capitol. Adelaide’s new position lead to her charitable work in Vilich becoming well-known in the city of Cologne. Her favourable reputation increased after bad harvests in the following years, during which Adelaide cared for the people in Cologne. While her relationship towards Archbishop Heribert is described by the vita as one of caritas, the sisters at Vilich are depicted as feeling neglected due to Adelaide spending time in Cologne.\n\nOn 5 February of an unknown year, Adelaide died of a sore throat in the company of her friend Archbishop Heribert. Her sisters from Vilich did not believe a message describing Adelaide’s illness and arrived after she had died. Archbishop Heribert wished for Adelaide to be buried in Cologne, but the sisters convinced him to have her buried in Vilich.\n\nOne of the main sources of Adelaide’s life is the \"Vita Adelheidis virginis\". The vita is a hagiographical source which also includes information on Adelaide’s family and the convent of Vilich itself. It was written around 1057 by Bertha with the aid of contemporary witnesses. Bertha appears to have written the Vita before entering the convent of Vilich. The Vita is directed to Anno II, archbishop of Cologne (1056-1075). In the Vita of Bertha’s brother, Wolfhelm, it is documented that Bertha wrote the \"Vita Adelheidis\" alongside other \"vitae\". \n\nMuch information from the vita is supported by different charters; mainly by a charter from 944, in which Otto I. restores  Megingoz’s property and by a charter from 987 by which Otto III. grants the Abbey of Vilich the status of \"Reichsstift\" (imperial convent). \n\nDuring her term of office, the region around Cologne was affected by famines. Therefore, she prayed for the poorest and as a result a source of water arose in the district of Pützchen in modern day Bonn. The source was transformed to a well and it became an important pilgrimage destination for the worship of Adelheid. This fountain has been preserved until today; every year in September, there is a pilgrimage in veneration of Adelheid. In 1641, her grave in the Vilicher Stiftskirche was opened and it was empty. After this discovery, the number of pilgrims fell sharply, but every year a few relics were and still are shown to the public.\n\nBeside this well, some other miracles have been recorded, which are supposed to have taken place at her grave. Adelaide was canonized by Pope Paul VI on 27 January 1966. As her day of death, the 5th of February was confirmed as the official day of her remembrance.\n\nEven today, several churches and monasteries in Bonn and Cologne, as well as several schools, are named after her. On 8 September 2008 Adelaide was proclaimed the third city patron saint of Bonn.\n\n\n"}

He died from injuries sustained when a massive bomb exploded on the Beirut seafront as he passed by in former Lebanese prime minister Rafik Hariri's motorcade on 14 February 2005.\n\nFleihan was born in Ain Zhalta on 10 September 1963. He attended International College. He received a bachelor of arts degree in economics from the American University of Beirut (AUB) in 1984. Then he obtained a master of arts degree in international and development economics from Yale University in 1985. He also held a PhD in economics from Columbia University in 1990. His PhD dissertation was entitled “Customs Unions, Growth and Economic Diversification”.\n\nFrom 1988 to 1993, Fleihan worked at the International Monetary Fund in Washington DC. He worked there as an advisor and then senior advisor to the Saudi executive director. He also worked at the United Nations Development Programme. In 1993, he left his job and returned to Lebanon, where he had been asked to assist in the post-war rehabilitation of the ministry of finance. While working as an adviser at the ministry, from 1993 to 1999, Fleihan also taught economics at his old alma mater, the American University of Beirut (AUB).\n\nFleihan was first elected to the Parliament of Lebanon in 2000, winning the Protestant seat in Beirut's first electoral district, and became the only Protestant member of the Parliament. He ran as a member of Hariri's \"Dignity of Beirut\" electoral list. In October 2000, he was appointed minister of economy and trade to the cabinet led by then prime minister Rafik Hariri. He held this position until 2003, and was replaced by Marwan Hamadeh.\n\nFleihan played a role in the development of Lebanon's economic reform program, which was presented by Hariri to international donors at a Paris conference in November 2002. Donors pledged $4.3 billion in soft loans; the plan was never fully implemented, but Lebanon did ultimately receive $2.39 billion from the donors.\n\nFleihan was a Protestant and a member of the National Evangelical Church of Beirut. Fleihan is survived by his wife, Yasma Fleihan, their children, Rayna (born 1999) and Rayan (born 2001), and his brother Ramsay and his family.\n\nThe day before the Hariri assassination, Fleihan was in Geneva, Switzerland. Although his wife had tried to convince him to extend his stay in Europe, Fleihan insisted on returning to Lebanon for an extraordinary Parliamentary session scheduled for 14 February 2005. After the session, Fleihan joined Hariri in his motorcade to head back to the latter's mansion in West Beirut. About half-way through their journey, a one-ton truck bomb exploded as they passed through the city's upscale seafront hotel district. At least a dozen people—including Hariri and several of his bodyguards—were killed instantly; the final death toll rose to 21. A United Nations investigation of the incident by Detlev Mehlis, released in October 2005, pointed the finger at Syrian and Lebanese officials.\n\nDespite being seated beside Hariri when the explosion occurred, Fleihan lived through the attack; however, severe burns covered over 95% of his body. Fleihan was firstly taken to the intensive care unit of the American University Hospital. Then he was airlifted to Percy Military Hospital in Clamart (suburb of Paris), where he survived for 64 days before finally succumbing to his injuries. He died on 18 April 2005.\n\nFleihan's body was taken to Lebanon and funeral service was held at a Protestant church in Beirut. His body was buried in Tohwita, suburb of Beirut, on 22 April.\n\nHis family established Basil Fuleihan Foundation in Lebanon after his death. The aim of the foundation is stated to be the provision of the basis for tomorrow’s Lebanon by promoting improvements in public policy and public service. In February 2006, the finance institute at Lebanese finance ministry was named the \"Bassel Fleihan finance and economy institute\", which Fleihan actively contributed its foundation in 1996.\n\n"}

He is known for his advocacy of statewide ballot measures and as a candidate for the statewide offices of Attorney General and Governor.\n\nMannix earned a bachelor's degree in liberal arts in 1971 from the University of Virginia. In 1974, he earned his law degree from the University of Virginia School of Law.\n\nPrior to serving in the legislature, Mannix worked in several different capacities, including Assistant Attorney General of Oregon, Assistant Attorney General of Guam, and a law clerk to the Oregon Court of Appeals.\n\nMannix was elected to the Oregon House of Representatives five times beginning in 1988. From 1989 through 1996, Mannix served in the Oregon House of Representatives as a Democrat. In 1997, he became a Republican and was appointed to the Oregon State Senate. He was elected back into the Oregon House in November 1998 and served through 2000.\n\nMannix is a driving force behind the effort to get tougher sentences for criminals. In 1994, he authored Ballot Measure 11, which established mandatory minimum sentences for violent crimes, including murder, manslaughter, serious assault, kidnapping, rape, sodomy, unlawful sexual penetration, sexual abuse, and robbery. This measure has also now been used to set automatic sentencing on accidental deaths due to addiction issues. A companion measure, Measure 10, also passed, amending the Oregon Constitution to provide that any criminal sentence established by a vote of the people cannot be reduced by the Legislature except with a two-thirds vote of both houses. A third successful Mannix measure, Measure 17, amended the Oregon Constitution to establish a new section which requires that state prison inmates work full-time in useful work. This also allowed work time to include education courses, counseling, and job training.\n\nIn 1996, Mannix brought Ballot Measure 40 to the ballot. This contained several victims' rights and anti-crime provisions. The effects of these Measures is to set the primary locus of control in sentencing decisions with victims and prosecutors. Measure 40 passed by a margin of 59% to 41%, but was overturned by the Oregon Supreme Court in \"Armatta v. Kitzhaber\", 327 Or. 250, 959 P.2d 49 (1998) on the grounds that it contained more than one amendment to the Oregon Constitution and should have been subject to separate votes on each provision.\n\nMeasure 40 returned to voters by legislative referral (engineered by Representative Mannix) as Measures 69–75 in November 1999. Of the seven referral measures four were passed by voters, which granted crime victims the right to be present during trial, to be consulted regarding plea bargains and to be heard at sentencing; limited the pre-trial release of violent criminals by authorizing courts to consider the safety of victims and the public; required that any term of imprisonment imposed by a court to be fully served, with the exception of the governor’s clemency power; and prohibited felons from serving on grand juries and criminal trial juries.\n\nIn 2008, Mannix helped lead a citizen initiative effort for Measure 61 which would have created mandatory minimum prison sentences for certain theft, identity theft, forgery, drug and burglary crimes. This measure was trumped by Measure 57, a legislative referral which avoided mandatory minimum sentences in favor of increased sentences for drug trafficking, theft against the elderly, and certain repeat property and identity theft crimes.\n\nAnother citizen initiative effort led by Mannix in 2010, Measure 73, was approved. This measure provided a mandatory minimum prison sentence of 25 years for repeat convictions of the worst sex crimes and required a minimum sentence of 90 days in jail, with costs reimbursed to the county by the state, for persons with a third DUII conviction within 10 years.\n\nIn 2012, Measure 84, an effort to repeal Oregon’s estate tax, was also supported by Mannix but was defeated.\n\nFor the Oregon 2014 General Election, Mannix, and Common Sense For Oregon, are supporting several initiatives including No Taxes on Family Giving and the Oregon Castle Doctrine.\n\nIn 1996, Mannix ran for Oregon Attorney General as a Democrat. At the last minute, Hardy Myers was recruited by Democrats to run against Mannix in the Democratic primary, as some felt Mannix was too conservative for their party. Myers defeated Mannix in the primary 62.8% to 36.8%. Myers went on to easily defeat his Republican opponent in the November general election. Mannix changed his party affiliation to Republican the following year, 1997. He was appointed to the state Senate in 1998.\n\nIn 2000, Mannix again ran for State Attorney General against Myers in a bitter campaign. Myers again defeated Mannix 49.8% to 46.2%. Libertarian candidate Tom Cox received 4.0%. There is the possibility that Cox siphoned off votes from Mannix, although it's far from certain that enough of them would have supported him to deny Myers victory.\n\nIn 2002, Mannix ran for Governor. In the Republican primary, he defeated former Labor Commissioner Jack Roberts and Portland attorney and school board chair Ron Saxton. He went on to run against Democrat Ted Kulongoski. Kulongoski won 49% of the vote versus 46% for Mannix. Libertarian candidate Tom Cox received 5% – a margin which many observe could have swung the election, had those votes gone to Mannix. The defeat also marked the fifth time in a row the Republicans failed to gain control of the Governor's mansion.\n\nMannix became Oregon Republican Party Chair in January 2003, and stepped down in 2005.\n\nIn 2006, Mannix ran again for the Republican nomination for Governor. He finished second in the primary with 30% of the vote, behind Saxton, who won the nomination with 43%, and ahead of state senator Jason Atkinson, who received 22%. Mannix was opposed in the primary by the Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde, who spent $800,000 opposing the Columbia Gorge casino in the 2006 Democratic and Republican primaries. Saxton, widely considered more moderate than Mannix, went on to lose the General Election in May to incumbent Kulongoski by an 8.1% margin.\n\nIn 2008, Mannix ran for the United States House of Representatives in the U.S. House primary election for Oregon's 5th congressional district to succeed retiring Democrat Darlene Hooley. Mannix ran a vigorous campaign, but was narrowly defeated by Mike Erickson, who went on to lose to Kurt Schrader in the general election due in part to personal issues that Mannix brought up in the primary.\n\nMannix serves as President for several organizations including the Oregon Anti-Crime Alliance, which he founded in 2008, and Common Sense For Oregon, which he founded in 2009. He is a member of the Board of Directors for the Salem Catholic Schools Foundation, a role he has served since 1985, and has been president of the Foundation since 2000.\n\nMannix was a founder and has served as Chairman of the Board of Directors for Blanchet Catholic School in Salem since it opened in 1995, is a member of the Knights of Columbus and has been a member of Rotary International since 1982.\n\nMannix has served on the national Board of Directors for Life Directions and the Salem Chamber of Commerce Board of Directors from 2007–2013.\n\nMannix is also a Board Member, and Vice President, of the Johann Strauss Society of America Foundation. This organization was founded in 2013 and is dedicated to supporting the music heritage of Johann Strauss.\n\nMannix's main financial donor in his political career is Loren Parks, a businessman who is currently a resident of Nevada.

Guillelmus Alaunovicanus, c. 1275 – March 1333) was a Franciscan friar and theologian, and bishop of Giovinazzo, who took his name from Alnwick in Northumberland.\n\nLittle is known of his early life. By 1303 he was a licensed doctor of theology at Paris, being then listed among the few foreign masters who sided with Philip IV, king of France, in his dispute with Pope Boniface VIII. Alnwick also lectured at other European centres of learning, including Montpellier, Bologna and Naples. He must have returned to England sometime in the second decade of the 14th century, as he is recorded as the forty-second Franciscan regent master at Oxford University, when Henry Harclay was chancellor of the university.\n\nAlnwick's manuscript marginalia show that he was part of the contemporary debate which spread all over Europe, and which included the ideas of men such as Thomas Aquinas, Bonaventure, Henry of Ghent, Peter Auriol, James of Ascoli, Godfrey of Fontaines, Henry Harclay and Thomas Wilton. His main collaborator, however, was Duns Scotus, and it is this that has saved him from obscurity.\n\nHe worked with Scotus in the production of his Commentary on the \"Sentences\" (\"Ordinatio\"), took down one of his \"Collationes\", and compiled the long additions (\"Additiones magnae\") which were meant to fill the gaps in the \"Ordinatio\". But although Alnwick based his philosophy and theology on the fundamental starting points of Scotus's teaching, he diverged from his colleague when he disagreed.\n\nAlnwick participated in the general chapter of the Franciscan order held at Perugia in 1322, where he joined the theologians who drew up and signed the decree \"De paupertate Christi\" attacking the position on the poverty of the church as promulgated by Pope John XXII. In the last section of his \"Determinationes\" he argued that Christ and his apostles possessed nothing either personally or in common. This opposition to the papal position caused John to initiate proceedings against Alnwick, who fled to Naples, where King Robert protected him. In 1330, Robert had him appointed bishop of Giovinazzo.\n\nHe died in Avignon in March 1333.\n"}

His widespread business interests gave him entree into domestic and international political affairs where he enjoyed privileged access to many influential power brokers at the top levels of government. His special arena of interest was Eastern Europe and the Middle East.\n\nCrane was the eldest son of plumbing parts mogul, Chicago manufacturer, Richard T. Crane. As a young man, Crane traveled extensively with his friend Charles B. Cory, a leading ornithologist whom Crane had met while visiting Boston. Crane and Cory shared an interest in baseball, and from 1888 to 1892, the pair funded and played on the Hyannis town team in what is now the Cape Cod Baseball League. At Cory and Crane's expense, various well-known professional and amateur players were brought in to play alongside the Hyannis locals. When Cory lost his family's fortune in 1906, Crane purchased Cory's vast collection of bird specimens and donated it to Chicago's Field Museum of Natural History with the stipulation that the museum would employ Cory as permanent curator of the collection.\n\nIn the 1900s, he brought Thomas Masaryk, Maksim Kovalevsky and Pavel Milyukov to lecture at the University of Chicago. After meeting Masaryk, he became interested in Slavic nationalism and sponsored \"The Slav Epic\" paintings by Alphonse Mucha When Mucha designed the Czechoslovak bills, he used a previous portrait of Josephine Crane Bradley as Slavia for the 100 koruna bill.\n\nPresident William Howard Taft appointed Crane minister to China on July 16, 1909, but on the eve of his departure to his post on October 4, 1909, he was recalled to Washington and forced to resign under pressure by US Secretary of State Philander C. Knox, who held him responsible for the publication in a Chicago newspaper of the US government's objections to two recent treaties between Japan and China.\nCrane contributed heavily to Woodrow Wilson's 1912 election campaign. Wilson rewarded Crane with appointments to the 1917 Special Diplomatic Commission to Russia, known as the Root Commission, as a member of the American Section of the Paris Peace Conference, and to the 1919 Inter-Allied Commission on Mandates in Turkey that became known as the King-Crane Commission. While the commission was originally proposed by the US to develop an international consensus on the future make up and status of postwar Middle East nations, the commission quickly became a US-only sponsored effort. With the appointment of Crane as co-head of the commission, it set about to issue a report to inform US policy makers. In respect to the creation of a Jewish state in the Middle East, the report cautioned \"Not only you as president but the American people as a whole should realize that if the American government decided to support the establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine, they are committing the American people to the use of force in that area, since only by force can a Jewish state in Palestine be established or maintained.\" Crane opposed the establishment of a Jewish state in the Middle East. He was a passionate spokesman for the independence of the Arab states.\n\nFrom May and June 1918 he helped Thomas Garrigue Masaryk to meet with president Wilson for the negotiation may be support Czechoslovak legions special in Russia and founding of a new independent Czechoslovak state \n\nCrane was appointed United States Ambassador to China by President Wilson and served from March 22, 1920, to July 2, 1921.\n\nIn 1925 Crane founded the New York-based Institute of Current World Affairs. The institute employed field representatives in Mexico, Jerusalem, and occasionally Moscow. These representatives compiled regular reports on developments in their regions, and shared their expertise during ICWA-sponsored lecture tours of major US universities. The reports were also made available to the US State Department.\n\nIn 1931, Crane helped finance the first explorations for oil in Saudi Arabia and Yemen. He was instrumental in gaining the American oil concession there.\n\nHe was also a member of the famous Jekyll Island Club (aka The Millionaires Club) on Jekyll Island, Georgia.\n\nWhen Franklin Roosevelt appointed William E. Dodd American ambassador to Germany in 1933, Crane wrote Dodd a letter of congratulation that told him:\n\nAccording to Larson, at a dinner, Ambassador Dodd heard Crane express admiration for Hitler and learned that Crane also had no objection to how the Nazis were treating Germany's Jews, telling Dodd: \"Let Hitler have his way.\"\n\nIn his biography of Crane, Norman E. Saul notes that he maintained relationships with prominent Jews such as Louis Brandeis and Lillian Wald and suggests that his “vague but open” anti-Semitism was not uncommon among Anglo-Saxons of his time. Saul notes that his admiration of Hitler left, in retrospect, the most damaging legacy to his reputation.\n\nHe was predeceased in 1938 by his son, Richard Teller Crane II, a diplomat. On April 24, 2006, Crane's art collection was sold at Christie's auction house.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1793301", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1793301", "title": "East Oakland, Oakland, California", "text": "East Oakland, Oakland, California\n\nEast Oakland is a geographical region of Oakland, California, United States that stretches between Lake Merritt in the northwest and San Leandro in the southeast. As the southeastern portion of the city, East Oakland takes up the largest portion of the city's land area.\n\nThe area is a major hub of Northern California's black community, with over 50% of East Oakland's inhabitants being black. According to figures from a 2000 U.S. Census, over 87,000 people reside in the East Oakland area.\n\nEast Oakland stretches between Lake Merritt in the northwest and San Leandro in the southeast. It generally has a diagonal layout. East Oakland has numbered avenues (1st to 109th) that run northeast to southwest, and numbered streets (East 7th to East 38th) that run northwest to southeast. Interstates 580 and 880 also run northwest to southeast. Main northwest–southeast thoroughfares include East 14th Street (renamed International Blvd. in 1996 within the city of Oakland only), MacArthur Blvd., Foothill Blvd., Bancroft Avenue, and San Leandro Street (being the main one for commercial vehicles). Main northeast-southwest thoroughfares include Fruitvale Ave., 35th Ave., High St., Seminary Ave., 73rd Ave. (which becomes Hegenberger Road south of International Blvd. to Oakland International Airport), and 98th Ave. East Oakland is home to Holy Names University, Mills College, the Oakland Zoo, the Oakland Coliseum and Oakland Arena.\n\nEast Oakland is a section of Oakland that has experienced many changes to their population as the West attracted immigrants in search of employment. Oakland was declared a city in 1852 where it was prominently populated by people who made it to the west during the Gold Rush. The dominant races that had relocated to the East Bay during the late 1840s were Caucasian, Chinese, Mexican, and African American.\n\nBy 1910, Oakland had the largest African American population in the East Bay because it tripled in the previous decade as a result of fires and earthquakes in the surrounding areas. Despite the new influx of African Americans, the East Oakland hills were known as “the Bible Belt” because of the white, Protestant community that occupied those houses. This area supported the Ku Klux Klan which shows that even in the East Bay there was racial tension and segregation. In the 1920s, East Oakland was restricted from ethnic minorities unless they worked as servants for the white. Those who did not work as servants were hit by the Great Depression in the late 1920s and early 1930s which causes employment to drop by 41 percent in three years.\n\nIn the 19th century, the Oakland-San Leandro Road was a county road connecting Oakland with San Leandro. Along this road, small settlements developed such as Melrose, Elmhurst and Fitchburg. All these were annexed by the city of Oakland after the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. After annexation, the Oakland-San Leandro Road was renamed East 14th Street which lasted for most of the 20th century, until it was renamed International Blvd. Both Foothill Boulevard and MacArthur Boulevard, which run through the heart of East Oakland, were a part of the Lincoln Highway, the first transcontinental highway, from 1913 until 1927.\n\nIn the spring of 1943, there was an increase of immigrants to the Bay Area as a result of World War II; this time is called “the Second Gold Rush”. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, the US government invested large sums of money on defense which created new jobs and opportunities on the coast and in the bay specifically. Because this was shortly after the great depression, many people were unemployed and looking for work, which was in abundance in the Oakland shipyard. Rather than an influx of whites, the new rush caused a surge of racial minorities which caused a restructuring of the demographics in the area. With the increase of workers, a housing crisis soon followed. In the city, there was push back from the Apartment House Owners Association and the Real Estate Board to build more housing so there were only five hundred public housing units built which also resulted in the destruction of other temporary housing units which displaced a large number of immigrants who had been living in them. Immigrants were forced to live in overcrowded quarters and even started sleeping on the streets because the housing that was being built was reserved for whites so minorities were pushed out of the city and forced to relocate to the outskirts of East Oakland. With the redistribution of living, this area, known as Brooklyn (until it was also annexed by the city in 1909) became the backbone of Oakland's African American community and caused an exodus of more prosperous whites to suburbs south and east of the city, such as San Leandro, Hayward and Walnut Creek.\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, many areas of East Oakland still remained predominantly white. After the war, MacArthur Blvd., which was the main route from San Francisco, replaced by the MacArthur Freeway (580) which displaced many more African Americans living in the city and forced them to relocate to surrounding areas such as East Oakland where the African American population was now the predominant community in East Oakland.\n\nIn 1969 the Economic Development Administration (EDA) declared that they would no longer fund large businesses or facilities but rather focus on creating jobs for the unemployed and poor, which in Oakland meant the ethnic minorities. A few years later, in 1978, California passes Proposition 13 which prevented African Americans from expanding their public zone with the property taxes, which caused the value of the area to significantly decline as the whites moved out. The mayor at the time, Lionel Wilson, who was the first African American mayor, elected the year prior in 1977, combatted the regulation on property taxes by using many public resources to create investment in downtown Oakland which increased the cost of living in the city and pushed more poor and marginalized populations to surrounding areas such as East Oakland. This is one example of gentrification that has occurred in the city and makes the cost of living higher in the city so the original residents are forced to relocate to the poor, underserved surrounding areas.\n\nWith the new availability of jobs created by the EDA, between 1990 and 2000 more Latino and Asian (primarily Cambodian, Lao, and Chinese) immigrants moved to Oakland and specifically Central East Oakland because of how cheap the cost of living was compared to the city. A census on overcrowding showed an increase from 17 to 27 percent because of the new people who moved there. The majority of the new immigrants were Chicano/Latino who had a growth between 150 and 400 percent in that decade. That same time saw a decline in the African American population between 17 and 31 percent.\n\nFruitvale has become the backbone of Oakland's Latino community, in which East Oakland had a rapid increase of 132% of Latinos between 1990 and 2000. Latinos make up 38% of the population of East Oakland. There is also a diverse Asian population, including Chinese, Vietnamese, Lao, and other southeast Asian ethnic groups generally inhabit the area of East Oakland closest to downtown, from Chinatown east to San Antonio. Asians make up a smatter percentage of only 4% of the population, but between 1990 and 2000 saw and increase of 13%. Between 1990 and 2000 both the white and black population of East Oakland saw a decrease in their populations by 24% and 16% respectively. Nonetheless, African Americans predominate in East Oakland, where they represent over 54% of East Oakland's residents. The deep east side has a population of roughly 15,000 residents and is 63% African American thus maintaining the highest concentration of African Americans in Northern California and the highest concentration of African Americans in California outside of Los Angeles. The Foothill Square neighborhood in East Oakland, located off of MacArthur Blvd., has the highest concentration of African American residents of any Oakland neighborhood, at 75.4%. Though the population of whites had decreased, they still made up 4% of the population.\n\nWith the increase of the population between 1990 and 2000 the number of households in the area increased by 3.4%. The residents work in all kinds of job areas including service, sales, transportation, construction, and even management and professional positions while 9.1% of the population is unemployed. For the whites who stayed, it was often because they were too poor to relocate and saw an unemployment rate of 30%. In dominantly African American neighborhoods, such as Central East Oakland, between 40-70% of the population were without high school diplomas. The Latino population had 50-70% without high school diplomas and 5% with college degrees. Asians saw a smaller amount of the population without education with 39.3% without high school diplomas and 22.8% with bachelor's degrees.\n\nEast Oakland, together with West Oakland and portions of North Oakland, is a hub for Northern California's African American community. Hip hop culture is associated with East Oakland. It is known within the hip hop community as \"Oaktown\", \"O-Town,\" (old school names) or currently, \"The Town\". A number of East Bay rappers and singers such as Raphael Saadiq, Keak da Sneak, Dru Down, Too Short, Digital Underground, MC Hammer, Luniz, Hieroglyphics, Keyshia Cole, Philthy Rich, Db tha General, Shady Nate, Bobby Brackins, and Lil B originated there. The prostitution, violence and drug culture of the region spawned a new subgenre of hip hop by the late 1980s. Rappers like Too Short incorporated drugs, violence, prostitution and gang life into their music, in sharp contrast to much of the East Coast hip hop of the day. Too Short was also one of the first rap artists to promote and sell records independently and is one of the pioneers responsible for the birth of Northern California's independent hip hop scene; leading other artists to pursue success in the music industry without the assistance of a major record company. The sound of the music was different from East Coast hip hop, which is known for its technique of sampling and looping to create a song. Instead, funk and blues were infused with synthesizers and drum machines, giving birth to the Bay Area hip hop sound known as Mobb music. Today, mainstream hip-hop continues to lyrically and musically incorporate much of what was pioneered in East Oakland.\n\nElmhurst was originally a separate town, it was annexed by Oakland in 1909, and today is considered part of East Oakland. Although it was historically a white working-class neighborhood, it became predominantly African American after World War II, and today, Latinos now form about half of Elmhurst's population. Elmhurst was the site of one of the large carbarns for the Key System's streetcars, the Elmhurst Carhouse. Chevrolet opened an auto assembly plant in Elmhurst in 1915, which shut down in the 1960s.\n\nLocated near the Oakland International Airport. The main streets are 98th Avenue and Edes Avenue. The Brookfield District is located from 85th Avenue to 98th Avenue. Brookfield Village stops at the Union Pacific (formerly Southern Pacific) train tracks after Railroad Avenue. Brookfield Village was built during the early 1900s. It later had a home-building boom during World War II in response to the influx of workers needed for the war industries, on land which had been zoned for industrial uses. In the 1990s, the neighborhood held an annual summer get-together called the Never Worry Picnic as a contrast to a crime rate that is 191% higher than the national average.\n\n\n\n\nEast Oakland experiences a lower life expectancy, relative to nearby neighborhoods like Alameda County, approximating 72 years. Amongst the heavily populated races present within Oakland, Hispanics lead in life expectancy, averaging 82 years. African Americans and Whites typically average 67–68 years within Oakland, while Asians live nearly 78 years. Conversely, there is a high all-cause mortality rate amongst the East Oakland community, leading in cancer, stroke, heart disease, and homicide death rates. It is found that communities and families of lower socioeconomic status typically experience higher mortality rates and lower survival rates compared to those from higher socioeconomic status.\n\nEast Oakland displays a significantly higher rate of common health conditions, with residents cumulatively experiencing 32% obesity, compared to 21% amongst all of California. Nearly 32% of adults in the community is at fair or poor health, relative to Alameda County's 15% and California's 16%. Similar patterns are also prevalent in children ages 0–17, with approximately 48% of children diagnosed with obesity, compared to 29% within the state of California. 13% of children in East Oakland also experience fair or poor health, a rate much higher than that of California (7%) or Alameda County (5%). Amongst older adults, due to increases in disabilities (accounting for 42% of disabilities), there is a greater onset of chronic diseases, accounting for 64% of deaths primarily in cancer, heart diseases, Alzheimer's, stroke, and respiratory diseases. As an effort to improve these existing conditions, East Oakland has become one of 14 different site across the state of California to participate in a 10-year comprehensive community initiative dedicated to improving and supporting a healthy community through active collaborations among youths, residents, and community partners within three Action Teams: Health Happens in Schools, Health Happens in Neighborhoods and Health Happens through Culture, Arts, Storytelling & Healing.\n\nAdults in East Oakland are more likely to visit emergency rooms than go to doctor's visits within the past year than many other counties in the Bay Area and in the entire state of California. In 2012, 35% of the community did not meet with their doctor, resulting in approximately 30% of residents taking advantage of the emergency room, relative to 13% in Alameda County and 18% in all of California. Amongst all ER visits, Blacks and Hispanics had the most frequent visits in 2011, with four times more visits compared to whites and Asian/Pacific Islanders. Furthermore, even when having healthcare coverage, Blacks continue to be the highest users of the emergency department, with 15% enrolled in governmental programs whilst consisting of 43% of frequent ER users. Amongst elderly adults, rising numbers in disabilities have resulted in increased hospital emergency visits. Heart disease, leading in chronic diseases amongst elders, accounts for over 19,500 hospitalizations each year. However, racial, linguistic, cultural, and cost barriers continue to influence level of access amongst the population.\n\nEast Oakland ranks amongst the lowest communities to provide healthcare coverage to adults and children. 52% of adults and 40% of children remain insured by private insurance companies, compared to 61% and 57% coverage throughout the state of California. East Oakland residents are one of the higher users of governmental health programs like Medi-Cal and Medicare, covering 27% of adults and 58% of children in the population, almost 30% higher than that of California. In the elderly population, 98% of older adults within the entire Alameda County have health insurance. However, due to rising costs in medical care in recent decades, the California Health Interview Survey observed that 48.5% of adults age 60+ let go of their insurance coverage.\n\nAmongst Hispanics, nearly 74% were enrolled in government health insurance, such as Medi-Cal and Healthy Families. Median income amongst enrolled Hispanic families is $16,800, whereas non-enrolled Hispanics receive a median annual income of $19,200. The average family household enrolled in health insurance amongst Hispanics is approximately 4-6 people.\n\nAlong with the socioeconomic disparities that people in East Oakland face, is the issue of food scarcity. East Oakland is considered a food desert because of the lack of access to affordable, healthy, fresh food. Some studies have found that food was considered one of the highest priorities and came second to shelter. The participants claim that they knew how to eat healthy and about the importance of a nutritious diet, but the availability and cost of the food outweighed potential health outcomes. The people were more concerned about getting enough food that they would not starve rather than focusing on the nutrition of what they were eating.\n\nWith the changes in state funding to housing and the movement of impoverished groups in the 1930s, East Oakland became an area where poorer people lived which also resulted in a major loss of industry as businesses and markets started to close down and relocate to more financially sustainable areas. As time went on, supermarkets and other businesses saw East Oakland as an “undesirable place for residential and commercial investment” so few new stores opened up in place of the ones that left. The smaller commercial stores that did stick around were forced to raise the prices of their food and focus more on selling alcohol and tobacco products to stay afloat. In the flatlands of East Oakland there are only four supermarkets and over 40 liquor stores. Alcohol was easy to sell and made the stores more money, but the number of liquor stores is proportional to the levels of crime in violence in the area. Additionally, the majority of the population of East Oakland are Latinos and African Americans, both groups who have higher predisposition to alcohol-related diseases.\n\nAs far as the stores that do sell food, a study by YPAR (Youth Participatory Action Research) 2.0 showed that the most available foods were chips, soda, and candy. Because it is cheap and available, these are the foods that people buy although they have little to no nutritional value and make people at a higher risk for diabetes, obesity, and other health problems. YPAR 2.0 is a method of conducting research done by the youth in the community to try and address the problems they and their families face. By going across East Oakland and classifying it as a food desert and critiquing the limited access to healthy food, they pushed for liquor and corner stores to have fresh produce and nutritious staple foods visible and affordable to the members of the community. As a result, stores responded and started to sell fresh produce from local farmers and receive deliveries twice a week for fresh produce.\n\nA list of notable people who have lived or currently live in East Oakland:\n"}

The decision to market the product was based on popular feedback from consumers in 2004, with the release of Diet Coke with Lime.\n\nAn advertisement of Coca-Cola with Lime first appeared on television during the March 7, 2005 broadcast of \"American Idol\". The advert uses Harry Nilsson's hit song \"Coconut\" in an edited and slightly altered form with the mondegreen \"You put the lime in the Coke, you nut.\"\n\nCoca-Cola with Lime was available in the United Kingdom in green bottles, as was other citrus flavour Coca-Cola with Lemon but in clear bottles the year before, as a limited summer edition in 2006. In 2020 it was brought back being branded as \"Diet Coke Sublime Lime.\" Coca-Cola with Lime was also available in Denmark and Sweden, but is now discontinued. It was also tested in the Netherlands as limited summer edition 2005, and is now widely available in that country.\n\nCoca-Cola with Lime is also available in Singapore. The Coca-Cola with Lime beverage was also given a limited edition run in Ireland along with the Diet version; however, now only the Diet Coca-Cola with Lime variety remains on sale in that country. Coca-Cola Citra is available in Japan.\n\nCoca-Cola with Lime was briefly available in Australia, but proved quite unpopular with some larger retailers such as Woolworths and Coles, who bought in bulk, having to reduce the price considerably (50c for a 1.25 L bottle compared to around A$2 for all other varieties) in order to clear the product out. Diet Coke with Lime was discontinued in the United Kingdom, as was Diet Coke with Lemon in the beginning of 2007, having been renamed Diet Coke with Citrus Zest in 2007, which is mixture of lime and lemon taste.\n\nCoca-Cola \"Lime\" is currently available to buy in Japan as of November 2015, in Romania as of October 2016(in April 2019 is discontinued and replaced with Coca-Cola Lime Zero), in Poland as of March 2017, in Estonia as of June 2017, in Lithuania as of July 2017, in Latvia and Canada as of January 2018, and in Austria as of July 2017.\n\nBesides being sold in bottles, Coca-Cola with Lime can also be created in Coca-Cola Freestyle machines.\n\n"}

It features several songs from Beck's 2005 album, \"Guero\". The prominent feature of the EP is the persistent use of sound effects and tones generated from 8-bit or 16-bit video game systems, giving the songs a somewhat 1980s retro or chiptune feel. The two artists who are responsible for the songs in the 4-song extended play are 8-Bit and Paza Rahm, both of whom are little-known artists.\n\n\n"}
