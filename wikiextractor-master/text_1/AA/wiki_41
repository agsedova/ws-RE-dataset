It is associated with Aix-Marseille University and is part of a network of ten Institut d'études politiques, known as IEP.\n\nSciences Po Aix is renowned on a national level for its law studies and defense & international security studies.\n\nSciences Po Aix is housed in a hôtel particulier, considered a Monument historique, designed by architect Georges Vallon in 1734. The building is located on the Place de l'université (\"town square of the university\"), opposite Cathédrale Saint-Sauveur on the rue Gaston de Saporta in Aix-en-Provence. This building previously housed the Faculty of Law of Aix-Marseille University.\n\nAs a \"grande école\", its admissions process is highly selective. Entry to Sciences Po Aix is conditioned by selection tests. The main test is designed for students who would like to join the institute as freshmen. Each year, there are more than 10 000 candidates. The selection rates are inferior to 10%. Sciences Po Aix specializes in political sciences. Therefore, the institute offers courses in economics, history, law, international relations, social sciences and business.\n\nThe IEP provides students with a general training in law, economics, general knowledge and history. Its students are selected through a competitive entrance examination. Some of its students have become company directors or government officials. Many students move on to careers in journalism, finance, state administration, diplomacy or communications.\n\nThe academic course lasts five years. It is composed of a three-year undergraduate programme and a two-year graduate programme. The primary diploma is equivalent to a master's degree. The third year of the Sciences Po Aix curriculum is a year of mobility abroad. Students have the choice, they can spend two semesters in a foreign university, one semester in a university and one semester internship or they also have the opportunity to spend two semesters as a trainee.\n\nThereby, Sciences Po Aix have concluded more than 130 exchange partnerships with different universities around the globe so that Sciences Po students can study in many countries during their third year. All continents of the world are represented, there are some partnerships in the United States (Wellesley College, Loyola University Chicago, Arizona State University, Florida International University...), in Canada (University of Montreal, University of Ottawa) in South America (University of Buenos Aires, Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, in Africa (Rhodes University), in Asia (Shanghai International Studies University, Hankuk University of Foreign Studies in Seoul, Waseda University in Tokyo), in Oceania (University of New South Wales in Sydney, University of Canterbury) and also in Europe (Free University of Berlin, LUISS University in Roma, Middlesex University in London...).\n\nSciences Po Aix was established in 1956. It is the heir of the \"École Libre des Sciences Politiques\", created by Émile Boutmy in 1872, in response to a need for reform for the society and the republican state that has just been born, after the Franco-Prussian War of 1870.\n\nIn September 2007, Philippe Séguin (1943–2010), then President of the Court of Audit (in French Cour des comptes), was elected President of the Administration Council, succeeding Jean-Paul Proust (1940–2010), Minister of the Principality of Monaco. In July 2010, the former French minister of economy and current managing director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Christine Lagarde, member of the Administration Council since 2008 and 1977 graduate, was elected President.\n\n\nThe directors of Sciences Po Aix are elected for a five-year term by the executive board of the school. Some members of this board have been elected such students, teachers and staff representatives. The executive board votes the pedagogical and administrative orientations and reforms proposed by the director, the budget of the school as well as the conventions with the foreign universities.\n\nMany top-tier politicians were students at Sciences Po Aix:\n\n\nIn addition to the politicians, there also some alumni of Sciences Po Aix that have occupied major positions in the culture, the state administration and also the business world.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1840891", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1840891", "title": "Email-address harvesting", "text": "Email-address harvesting\n\nEmail harvesting is the process of obtaining lists of email addresses using various methods. Typically these are then used for bulk email or spam.\n\nThe simplest method involves spammers purchasing or trading lists of email addresses from other spammers.\n\nAnother common method is the use of special software known as \"harvesting bots\" or \"harvesters\", which spider Web pages, postings on Usenet, mailing list archives, internet forums and other online sources to obtain email addresses from public data.\n\nSpammers may also use a form of dictionary attack in order to harvest email addresses, known as a directory harvest attack, where valid email addresses at a specific domain are found by guessing email address using common usernames in email addresses at that domain. For example, trying alan@example.com, alana@example.com, @example.com, etc. and any that are accepted for delivery by the recipient email server, instead of rejected, are added to the list of theoretically valid email addresses for that domain.\n\nAnother method of email address harvesting is to offer a product or service free of charge as long as the user provides a valid email address, and then use the addresses collected from users as spam targets. Common products and services offered are jokes of the day, daily bible quotes, news or stock alerts, free merchandise, or even registered sex offender alerts for one's area. Another technique was used in late 2007 by the company iDate, which used email harvesting directed at subscribers to the Quechup website to spam the victim's friends and contacts.\n\nSpammers may harvest email addresses from a number of sources. A popular method uses email addresses which their owners have published for other purposes. Usenet posts, especially those in archives such as Google Groups, frequently yield addresses. Simply searching the Web for pages with addresses — such as corporate staff directories or membership lists of professional societies — using spambots can yield thousands of addresses, most of them deliverable. Spammers have also subscribed to discussion mailing lists for the purpose of gathering the addresses of posters. The DNS and WHOIS systems require the publication of technical contact information for all Internet domains; spammers have illegally trawled these resources for email addresses. Spammers have also concluded that generally, for the domain names of businesses, all of the email addresses will follow the same basic pattern and thus are able to accurately guess the email addresses of employees whose addresses they have not harvested. Many spammers use programs called web spiders to find email address on web pages. Usenet article message-IDs often look enough like email addresses that they are harvested as well. Spammers have also harvested email addresses directly from Google search results, without actually spidering the websites found in the search.\n\nSpammer viruses may include a function which scans the victimized computer's disk drives (and possibly its network interfaces) for email addresses. These scanners discover email addresses which have never been exposed on the Web or in Whois. A compromised computer located on a shared network segment may capture email addresses from traffic addressed to its network neighbors. The harvested addresses are then returned to the spammer through the bot-net created by the virus. In addition, sometime the addresses may be appended with other information and cross referenced to extract financial and personal data.\n\nA recent, controversial tactic, called \"\"e-pending\"\", involves the \"appending\" of \"email\" addresses to direct-marketing databases. Direct marketers normally obtain lists of prospects from sources such as magazine subscriptions and customer lists. By searching the Web and other resources for email addresses corresponding to the names and street addresses in their records, direct marketers can send targeted spam email. However, as with most spammer \"targeting\", this is imprecise; users have reported, for instance, receiving solicitations to mortgage their house at a specific street address — with the address being clearly a business address including mail stop and office number.\n\nSpammers sometimes use various means to confirm addresses as deliverable. For instance, including a hidden Web bug in a spam message written in HTML may cause the recipient's mail client to transmit the recipient's address, or any other unique key, to the spammer's Web site. Users can defend against such abuses by turning off their mail program's option to display images, or by reading email as plain-text rather than formatted.\n\nLikewise, spammers sometimes operate Web pages which purport to remove submitted addresses from spam lists. In several cases, these have been found to subscribe the entered addresses to receive more spam.\n\nWhen persons fill out a form, it is often sold to a spammer using a web service or http post to transfer the data. This is immediate and will drop the email in various spammer databases. The revenue made from the spammer is shared with the source. For instance, if someone applies online for a mortgage, the owner of this site may have made a deal with a spammer to sell the address. These are considered the best emails by spammers, because they are fresh and the user has just signed up for a product or service that often is marketed by spam.\n\nIn many jurisdictions there are anti-spam laws in place that restrict the harvesting or use of email addresses. \n\nIn Australia, the creation or use of email-address harvesting programs (address harvesting software) is illegal, according to the 2003 anti-spam legislation, only if it is intended to use the email-address harvesting programs to send unsolicited commercial email. The legislation is intended to prohibit emails with 'an Australian connection' - spam originating in Australia being sent elsewhere, and spam being sent to an Australian address. \n\nNew Zealand has similar restrictions contained in its Unsolicited Electronic Messages Act 2007.\n\nIn The United States of America, the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 made it illegal to initiate commercial email to a recipient where the email address of the recipient was obtained by:\n\n\nFurthermore, website operators may not distribute their legitimately collected lists. The CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 requires that operators of web sites and online services should include a notice that the site or service will not give, sell, or otherwise transfer addresses, maintained by such website or online service, to any other party for the purposes of initiating, or enabling others to initiate, electronic mail messages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is one of two East Coast flagship stations of the Spanish-language network (alongside WLTV-DT in Miami–Fort Lauderdale, Florida). WXTV-DT is owned by the Univision Local Media subsidiary of Univision Communications, as part of a \"de facto\" triopoly with Newark, New Jersey-licensed UniMás co-flagship WFUT-DT (channel 68) and Smithtown, New York-licensed Justice Network affiliate WFTY-DT (channel 67). The three stations share studios on Frank W. Burr Boulevard in Teaneck, New Jersey; WXTV and WFUT share transmitter facilities at the Empire State Building in Midtown Manhattan.\n\nWXTV's programming is simulcast to Long Island on WFTY's third digital subchannel (UHF channel 23.3 or virtual channel 67.3 via PSIP) from its transmitter in Middle Island, New York.\n\nWXTV first signed on the air on August 4, 1968, originally operating as an independent station, carrying programs in both English and Spanish. The station originally operated from studios at 641 Main Street in Paterson, New Jersey; the station later moved to 24 Meadowlands Parkway in Secaucus, New Jersey and then to its current facilities in Teaneck.\n\nIn 1970, WXTV became an entirely Spanish-language station, and affiliated with the Spanish International Network, which became Univision in 1987. Since the mid-1980s, WXTV has used the slogan \"A su lado\", an adaptation for the Hispanic market of the \"On Your Side\" campaign created by Frank Gari, and even used the similarly named news music package for a time.\n\nThe September 11, 2001 terror attacks on the World Trade Center did not affect WXTV's over-the-air signal, as WXTV's transmitter is located at the Empire State Building. WXTV and WCBS-TV (channel 2), who had a full-powered backup transmitter at the Empire State Building, were the only major New York City stations whose over-the-air signals were not disrupted. For a time until the other English stations could re-establish emergency transmission bases at Empire or the Armstrong Tower, WXTV's anchors reported in both languages for viewers without pay access to local English stations.\n\nFrom the 1980s to 2002, WXTV operated a low-powered repeater in Philadelphia, first on channel 35 as W35AB and then on channel 28 as WXTV-LP. In 2002, Univision acquired a full-power outlet in Philadelphia, WUVP-DT, and the former WXTV-LP joined Telefutura as WFPA-CD.\n\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\nWXTV discontinued regular programming on its analog signal, over UHF channel 41, on June 12, 2009, as part of the federally mandated transition from analog to digital television. The station's digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 40, using PSIP to display WXTV's virtual channel as 41 on digital television receivers.\n\nOn March 1, 2015, WXTV started carrying Bounce TV after WWOR-TV (channel 9) dropped it from its digital lineup to create a space for the upcoming Buzzr.\n\nWXTV-DT presently broadcasts 17 hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with three hours each weekday and one hour each on Saturdays and Sundays); in addition, the station produces an hour-long extension of its morning newscast \"Noticias 41 Al Despertar en UniMás\" for sister station WFUT which airs weekdays at 7:00 a.m., a newscast for Altice USA's News 12 Networks on weekdays, and the 15-minute sports highlight program \"Accion Deportiva 41\", which airs Sunday nights at 11:15 p.m. as part of the 11 p.m. newscast. WXTV also maintains news partnerships with CNN en Español, the Dominican Republic's \"Noticias SIN\", Peru's América Televisión, and Mexico's \"Enlace Publica\" and utilizes the reporting staff of sister radio station WADO (1280 AM) for on-air reports.\n\nThe 6 and 11 p.m. weekend newscasts tend to be preempted by Univision programming that runs longer than it is scheduled to air (which is rare for the primetime schedule, unless a football (soccer) match airs). In the event that there is a technical fault occurring during either of WXTV's weekday newscasts, WXTV will cut to Univision's satellite feed until it is able to rejoin the East Coast feed for the national Univision news bulletins. Univision's satellite feed features entertainment programming and \"Primer Impacto Extra\" from 6–6:30 and 11–11:30 p.m. for stations that do not have local newscasts.\n\nWXTV is known for having newscasts whose ratings frequently rival its English-language counterparts. From 1972 until 2013, the station's lead news anchor was Cuban-born Rafael Pineda; his 41 years at channel 41 gave him the distinction of being the longest-serving news anchor on a New York City television station, English or Spanish, until Chuck Scarborough of WNBC surpassed him in 2016.\n\nWXTV won the July 2008 sweeps period and also became the first Spanish-language television station to win all three evening slots (local newscasts and 6 and 11 and the national news at 6:30 p.m.). WXTV's 6 p.m. newscast was also #1 among the 25-54 demographic, followed by WABC-TV (channel 7), WCBS-TV, WNJU (channel 47), WNYW (channel 5) and WNBC (channel 4). On June 22, 2010, WXTV-DT became the first Spanish-language television station in the New York City market to begin broadcasting its local newscasts in high definition.\n\nOn January 5, 2012, it was announced that WXTV's 6 p.m. newscast ended the 2011 calendar year as #1 newscast in that timeslot in the entire United States among adult demographics. WXTV outperformed all early evening local newscasts in the country, regardless of language among Adults 18-49. On May 7, 2012 beginning with WXTV's 6 p.m. newscast, the station's moved its newscasts to a temporary set and announced on the next day (May 8) on their morning newscast that WXTV was constructing a new set to debut on July 23. On May 2, 2012, WXTV's weeknight 11 p.m. newscast was extended by five minutes to 11:35 p.m. (expanding to 35 minutes in length), while the weekend late newscasts continued to run for a half-hour from 11 to 11:30 p.m.\n\n\n\n"}

The hypothesis was formulated by the economist Michael Porter in an article in 1995.\n\nThe hypothesis suggests that strict environmental regulation triggers the discovery and introduction of cleaner technologies and environmental improvements, the innovation effect, making production processes and products more efficient. The cost savings that can be achieved are sufficient to overcompensate for both the compliance costs directly attributed to new regulations and the innovation costs.\n\nIn the first mover advantage, a company is able to exploit innovation by learning curve effects or patenting and attains a dominating competitive position compared to companies in countries where environmental regulations were enforced much later.\n\nThe Porter hypothesis has been applied to REACH. In one conclusion, companies that adopt a cost leadership business strategy and have a relatively small product portfolio will fare better than companies that compete by product differentiation and have a larger number of chemicals that require regulation.\n\nVarious studies found that stricter environmental regulation stimulates innovation (\"weak\" version of Porter hypothesis). There is mixed evidence whether stricter regulation enhances business performance (\"strong\" version). Whether the type of regulation - market-based approaches or requirements and prohibitions - has an impact, is an open question. Economic theory suggests that market based instruments could be more efficient but there is mixed empirical evidence. A study of OECD countries, however, showed no evidence of permanent effects of environmental policy tightening on productivity following the introduction of environmental measures, regardless of the type of regulation.\n\nMichael E.

It was created as one of the French Institutes of Political Studies. The school's focus is on educating France's political and diplomatic personnel, but its academic focus spans not only the political and economic sciences, but also law, communications, finance, business, urban policy, management, and journalism.\n\nSciences Po Lille was created by decree in 1991. As all IEP, it aims to give its students training in the civil service, but it specialises in European and International studies. The institute also has an agreement with the renowned school of Journalism Ecole Supérieure de Journalisme de Lille. It also proposes highly selective dual degrees with universities in Spain, England and Germany.\n\nThe curriculum at the IEP is at the crossroads of law, history, economics, political science and sociology. Students are taught at least two foreign languages and spend one year abroad. Entrance to the IEP can be achieved through highly selective exams.\n\nAt the time of its establishment in 1991, Sciences Po Lille was located in the premises of the École Supérieure de Journalisme de Lille, 50 rue Gauthier de Châtillon. Built in the 19th century, the building was located in the quartier latin of Lille, which used to be where all Lille's universities were located. The building quickly turned out to be too small for both schools. Thus, in 1996, in order to keep growing, Sciences Po Lille moved into a bigger building, this time located in a working-class district called . The choice of this district was political. The municipality of Lille wished to enhance social diversity in the neighbourhood. Sciences Po Lille's students being mostly from high income and educational backgrounds, its presence in the Moulins district was seen as a way to reinvigorate this southern part of Lille. Sciences Po Lille's new address became 84 rue de Trévise, near the metro station Porte de Valenciennes. The building is a former factory made of red bricks.\n\nTo cope with the quick development of the school, a new relocation took place in January, 2017. Sciences Po Lille came back to its original area and established its campus rue Auguste-Angelier in the old quartier Latin of Lille. This building of downtown Lille is 8200 square meters. It provides 3 amphitheatres, 40 rooms and a 1500 square meter library.\n\nSciences Po Lille is one of the most selective French \"écoles\". Students wishing to attend Sciences Po Lille must pass highly selective and competitive entrance exams composed of a general knowledge test, a history test, and a language test. The rate of admission is, as with all \"Grandes écoles\", very low: between 5 and 15% of candidates are admitted.\n\nThere are two admission procedures for the Undergraduate Program. The two of them are collectively organized by Sciences Po Lille and six other Sciences Po (Aix-en-Provence, Lyon, Rennes, Saint-Germain-en-Laye, Strasbourg and Toulouse):\n\nAdmission procedures for Graduate Programs: \n\nTuitions are based on the income of the student's family. They range from 0 euro to 3.200 euros a year. To tuition must be added health insurance, which costs about 200 euros for the full year.\n\nSciences Po Lille's Master's programs are divided into four sections:\n\nSciences Po Lille also offers co-sponsored Master's:\n\nSciences Po Lille has a very large Study Abroad Program.

In 2013, at the NMUN-NY, the school won the \"Outstanding Delegation\" award, which is considered the most prestigious prize. That same year, a student was also awarded the \"Outstanding Delegate\" award at Harvard's MUN.\n\nSciences Po Lille opened a Summer School in 2015. It consists in a two-week intensive program during which students attend courses of economics, law, politics and history. All the courses are related to a common theme, which changes every year. In 2015, the theme was the \"European Union's challenges in a context of crisis.\" Classes are all taught in English. Participants receive a certificate with 6 ECTS credits. They can also take optional courses in French language & culture and get one more ECTS. Courses consist of classroom sessions held on each weekday except on the field trip to Brussels.

Beckman in 1905.\n\nWithin 10 years of its inception, Red Wing Shoes was producing more than 200,000 pairs of boots per year and was the primary company manufacturing footwear for American soldiers fighting in World War I. Red Wing Shoes continued its tradition of producing footwear for wartime use by manufacturing boots for American soldiers during World War II.\n\nThough Red Wing Shoes is known primarily for their leather boots intended for heavy work, in recent years the company has expanded its line-up to include athletic-styled work shoes and footwear designed for specific job applications (such as slip-resistant shoes designed for the service industry and boots ideal for the mining industry that utilize a metatarsal guard). The company produces Oxfords, chukkas, hiking boots, and logger styles, as well as 6-inch and 8-inch work boots. While the core of Red Wing's focus is on work boots, in 2008 Red Wing Shoes added a Heritage catalog and also has experimented with more fashion-oriented shoes.\n\nThe Red Wing Shoe brand is primarily handmade in the USA with American materials at the company's plants in Red Wing, Minnesota; Potosi, Missouri, and Danville, Kentucky. As of 2014, there are six sources of manufacture: completely made in the USA, made in the USA with imported materials, assembled in the USA with imported components, made in China, made in Korea and made in Vietnam.\n\nIn addition to manufacturing footwear under their own name, Red Wing Shoes also manufactures shoes under the Irish Setter Boots, Vasque, Carhartt (discontinued in 2011), and Worx brands. These non-Red Wing brands include a majority of models manufactured in the People's Republic of China.\n\nIn order to comply with ASTM F 2413-11 and M I/75 C/75 standards for impact and compression, Red Wing Shoes manufactures many of their styles with steel, non-metallic, and aluminum safety toes and offers puncture-resistant options that meet the ASTM F 2413-11 standard. Red Wing Shoes also produces footwear that is static-dissipative in order to control the amount of electrical discharge from the body and electrical hazard in order to provide extra protection from accidental contact with electrically energized objects.\n\nIn 2013 Red Wing Shoes recalled over 114,000 pairs of steel toe boots due to defective toe caps that could fail to protect wearers' feet.\n\nThe company's name is clearly IDENTIFIABLE because of its founding in Red Wing, Minnesota. However, store locations in and around the state of Michigan write the store's name in the same font used by the Detroit Red Wings hockey team and feature a wing very similar to the hockey team's \"winged wheel\" logo, minus the wheel.\n\n\n\n"}

He is part of the Lumbee tribe. He is best known for his work with the World Wrestling Federation (later known as World Wrestling Entertainment) under the ring name Tatanka from 1991 to 1996 and 2005 to 2007. His ring name is a Lakota word that means \"buffalo\".\n\nChavis started competing in powerlifting. He competed in his first bodybuilding contest, Mr. Virginia Beach, placing second. He won many competitions during his time in bodybuilding, but decided against competing on the national level and possibly turning pro. From 1985 to 1990 he worked for Bally's Health and Tennis Corporation, becoming a divisional manager.\n\nDuring the 1987 NFL Players Association strike, he received many tryouts for the National Football League, from teams such as the Miami Dolphins, Detroit Lions, Washington Redskins, and the Los Angeles Raiders. He decided to pursue a career with the Dolphins. Chavis was one of 20 hopefuls offered a deal out of approximately 2,000 tryouts. The Dolphins offered him a free agent contract with the availability to increase after the first year. He declined, since his income at Bally's exceeded the value of the contract.\n\nIn 1989, Chavis left Bally's to pursue an accounting career. He met \"Nature Boy\" Buddy Rogers in Florida at a video store while looking for wrestling tapes. Rogers had Chavis call Larry Sharpe, who ran a wrestling school in southern New Jersey called \"The Monster Factory\". He had his first match, as Tatanka, against Joe Thunder in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on January 13, 1990.\n\nRogers introduced Chavis to George Scott, the booker for the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) during the 1980s. Scott was starting his own promotion called the North American Wrestling Association, later known as South Atlantic Pro Wrestling. Chavis wrestled under the name \"The War Eagle\" Chris Chavis and was voted third runner up for Rookie of the Year in \"Pro Wrestling Illustrated\" for 1990. Also in 1990, he became the South Atlantic Heavyweight Champion by beating Ken Shamrock. Not long after, he was signed to a WWF contract.\n\nChavis received his first tryout match with the WWF on January 8, 1991 against Dale Wolfe at a \"WWF Wrestling Challenge\" taping in Chattanooga, TN. He received a second tryout on February 18, 1991, against the Brooklyn Brawler at a \"WWF Superstars\" taping in Orlando, Florida. Wrestling as the War Eagle, Chavis was victorious. He followed it up with another win against Dale Wolfe the next day at a \"Wrestling Challenge\" taping. On October 21 he received what was likely another tryout match at a \"Superstars\" taping, this time defeating Skinner. In November Chavis began wrestling on house shows under his given name. Soon after, he took on the ring name \"Tatanka\". After wrestling in tryout matches at house shows, Tatanka made his television debut as a fan favorite on the February 1, 1992, episode of \"Superstars\", defeating Pat Tanaka in his debut match. As Tatanka, Chavis performed a war dance to the Lumbee tribal war cry that preceded his entrance to the ring, and had a red stripe dyed in the middle of his hair.\n\nTatanka was pushed as undefeated on WWF television; he did not suffer any defeat by pinfall or submission, but he lost several matches at house shows, the first being a countout loss to Rick Martel on June 4, 1992, in Fort Wayne, Indiana. Tatanka's earliest rivalry on television was against Martel; it culminated in Tatanka's pay-per-view debut, at WrestleMania VIII, with Tatanka winning the match. On May 18, 1992, Tatanka reached the peak of his success by winning the 40-man \"Bashed in the USA\" battle royal. He renewed his \"feud\" with Martel, who had stolen sacred eagle feathers from him to add to his wardrobe, going on to defeat Martel again at Survivor Series to reclaim the feathers.\n\nAt WrestleMania IX, Tatanka received his first televised title shot in the WWF, against Shawn Michaels for the WWF Intercontinental Championship. Tatanka won the match by countout. Since a title could not change hands on a countout, Michaels retained the title. On the October 30, 1993, edition of \"Superstars\", Tatanka suffered his first televised defeat in the WWF, losing to Ludvig Borga (Borga had hit Tatanka in the back with a steel chair while Mr. Fuji distracted the referee). After the match, he was attacked by WWF champion Yokozuna and was subsequently out of action for three months. Tatanka returned to the WWF in the beginning of 1994. He was scheduled to face Borga in a rematch at the Royal Rumble, but Borga injured his ankle just days before the event. Borga was replaced by Bam Bam Bigelow, who Tatanka defeated. Bigelow, however, would go on to eliminate Tatanka from the 30-man Royal Rumble match.\n\nTatanka was honored by retired professional wrestlers Chief Jay Strongbow and Chief Wahoo McDaniel and by Lumbee tribesman Ray Littleturtle on an edition of \"Raw.\" Littleturtle presented him with a full-length Lumbee tribe chief headdress. Tatanka engaged in a storyline feud with Irwin R. Schyster, who insisted he pay a gift tax on the item. Strongbow briefly served as Tatanka's mentor and manager during the duration of the feud.\n\nDuring the summer of 1994, Tatanka accused Lex Luger of selling out to Ted DiBiase, which resulted in a match between the two. Afterward, DiBiase entered the ring with a red, white and blue bag full of money. Luger kicked the bag out of DiBiase's hands resulting in Tatanka attacking him and turning him into a villain at SummerSlam, joining DiBiase's Million Dollar Corporation. He spent the remainder of the year feuding with Luger which topped off in a cage match on \"Raw\" that saw Luger come out the victor.\n\nIn spring 1995, Tatanka had another feud with Bam Bam Bigelow, who just turned face. As a result, he teamed with Sycho Sid at the King of the Ring pay-per-view to lose to Bigelow and Diesel.\n\nTatanka was suspended on Aug 30, reportedly as a preemptive measure for being named in a lawsuit to be filed by a woman stemming from an incident in Anaheim, CA, following a WWF event in late 1994. According to sources, the woman was said to have been drugged, sodomized and her head shaved on only one side. Kevin Nash reiterated this story in an interview with Kayfabe Commentaries. The woman was having drinks with him and Undertaker the night prior. When the wrestlers were leaving the hotel the following morning, Nash noticed that she was seated in between two police officers. The hallway was smeared in blood. She had half her head shaven as she was crying, reporting the incident to the officers. In the interview, however, Nash presumed the person who did this was Jimmy Del Ray because of similar stories of Del Ray. During representation by Tatanka's attorney the facts showed that Tatanka was not involved in the incident at all and Del Ray was fired from the company and Tatanka's suspension was lifted and he returned with full-pay to the active WWF roster. As Nash noted in his interview, he knew that Tatanka was not involved at all but had only been around Del Ray that night, which caused Tatanka to also be named and unfairly suspended.\n\nFollowing this hiatus at the end of August 1995, Tatanka returned to the WWF to compete in the Royal Rumble event, where he was eliminated by Diesel.\n\nOn March 19, 1996, Tatanka wrestled his final televised match in the WWF, losing to the WWF champion Bret Hart in a non-title match. Tatanka left the WWF in the spring of 1996, citing family and spiritual issues. He continued to appear for independent promotions, which allowed him to continue to wrestle while maintaining a lighter schedule.\n\nIn 1997, Chavis wrestled for the independent New York-based promotion Ultimate Championship Wrestling (UCW), where he wrestled Bruce Hart of the Hart wrestling family, King Kong Bundy, Jim \"The Anvil\" Neidhart and Marty Jannetty. He went from playing the role of a face to a heel when he turned on Falcon Coperis and Tommy Cairo to align himself with the likes of the UWF faction of the organization which included Neidhart, Hart, and eventually Jannetty. Chavis captured the UCW Heavyweight Championship title and handed then-champion Falcon Coperis his first championship defeat. Chavis remained champion until the organization folded its professional wrestling division in 1998.\n\nOn August 1, 2005, Chavis returned to \"Raw\" as a face once again which was intended to be a special one-time appearance to face Eugene in the \"Eugene Invitational\", a three-minute match with Kurt Angle's Olympic gold medal on the line. Tatanka lost the match when Angle attacked Eugene with 27 seconds remaining, causing a disqualification.\n\nChavis returned to a full-time schedule for WWE at the tail end of 2005, debuting at a December 27 house show, teaming with Shelton Benjamin in a win over Carlito and Jonathan Coachman. He returned to television in the Royal Rumble match at the January 2006 event, where he was eliminated by Joey Mercury and Johnny Nitro. The next month he began appearing on \"Velocity\" before being moved full-time to the SmackDown! brand.\n\nAs a face, Chavis teamed with Matt Hardy to defeat MNM, the then-Tag Team Champions, in a non-title match at No Way Out. They were granted a title shot on the next edition of \"SmackDown!\", but lost. On the April 28 \"SmackDown!\" a vignette played announcing that \"a new warrior would soon be forged in Tatanka.\" Over the next three weeks footage aired of Tatanka being (legitimately) adopted into the Oglala Sioux Tribe (Lakota). When he returned to wrestling Tatanka defeated Simon Dean with his new finisher, \"Wakinyan\" (from the Lakota word for \"Thunder\").\n\nOn the September 1, 2006 episode of \"SmackDown!\", he lost to The Miz in Miz's debut match, and would later lose a rematch to Miz as well. Tatanka engaged in a mini-feud with Sylvain Grenier, trading victories with him, before he was moved into an angle where he entered into a losing streak due to what he perceived to be bad decision-making by referees during his matches, especially Charles Robinson. This escalated until the October 27 \"SmackDown!\" when Tatanka, alongside partner Bobby Lashley, lost a match to William Regal and Dave Taylor when Regal pinned Tatanka by illegally using the ropes after (During the pin Dave Taylor got his hands in the last second). After the match Tatanka argued the decision again, then he turned heel by attacking the referee and then Lashley when he tried to calm him down. The next week he appeared on \"SmackDown!\" with a new style of warpaint, covering the top of his face in black and the bottom in white, and cut a promo on Lashley saying he owed neither him nor the crowd an explanation for his actions. He compared his recent losing streak to the years of persecution that his people had suffered over the years and said that he \"called upon his forefathers to unleash a new warrior in [him]\" and also said if Lashley went to war with [me] or war with a whole nation of warriors. He asked for and was released from his WWE contract on January 19, 2007, but not before ending his losing streak by defeating Jimmy Wang Yang, his first victory in months. WWE.com noted this event with these parting words: \"Tatanka is an accomplished veteran of the squared circle. The Native American made a splash upon his entrance to the WWE in the early 90s, remaining undefeated for two years.\" Tatanka stated on his official website that he requested to be released and mentioned he was not done with WWE as he would like to return someday.\n\nIn 2008 Tatanka toured Ireland and France with the American Wrestling Rampage tour. He also wrestled for All Star Promotions in the United Kingdom. He competed in All Star and American Wrestling between August 29 to October 31, 2008, in the Tower Circus area of Blackpool Tower.\n\nTatanka made an appearance in Danish Pro Wrestling (DPW) and lost to Chaos after he was hit by a DDT. He was given a standing ovation after the match.\n\nTatanka appeared in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling on the December 17, 2009 episode of Impact where he defeated Jay Lethal in a Black Machismo Invitational Match with an End of the Trail.\n\nTatanka also made headlines in Scotland while appearing for Scottish Wrestling Entertainment, renewing his partnership with the Million Dollar Man Ted DiBiase in Dundee. Tatanka was due to return to Scotland to wrestle for the SWE at the Dewars Centre in Perth on August 25, 2012.\n\nOn August 8, 2012, Chikara announced that Tatanka would be making his debut for the promotion in the following month's 2012 King of Trios tournament, where he will team with the 1-2-3 Kid and Aldo Montoya as \"Team WWF\". In their first round match on September 14, Team WWF was defeated by The Extreme Trio (Jerry Lynn, Tommy Dreamer and Too Cold Scorpio). The following day, Tatanka defeated Sugar Dunkerton in a singles match.\n\nTatanka made another appearance in Danish Pro Wrestling (DPW) and defeated Chaos after hitting Wykea after a long and enduring match. He was given a standing ovation once again.\n\nHe also wrestled in Germany, in June 2013 for ACW (Athletik Club Wrestling) and GHW (German Hurricane Wrestling).\n\nOn May 2, 2014, Tatanka won the DPW Tag Team Championship along with Rick \"The Prick\" Dominick. They lost the titles on October 18, 2014 to Ravn and Demolition Davies.\n\nTatanka made an appearance on the \"Old School Raw\" on November 15, 2010 backstage along with Ron Simmons, Dusty Rhodes, IRS, and The \"Million Dollar Man\" Ted DiBiase.\n\nOn November 3, 2015, WWE announced that they signed Tatanka to a Legends contract. On April 3, 2016, at WrestleMania 32, Tatanka competed in the Andre the Giant Memorial Battle Royal as a face, and was among the last to be eliminated.\n\nTatanka is in the \"WWE 2K17\" video game as DLC. He appears in \"WWE 2K18\" and \"WWE 2K19\" as a playable character.\n\nChavis and his wife, Michelle, have four children; daughters Christiana Mariah (born May 30, 1996) and Rhea Aiyana (born July 1, 2002) and sons Joseph Tatanka (born March 6, 2004) and Jeremiah Chris (born 2009). They live in Spring Hill, Florida. Chavis was previously married to Dawn Doyle on Valentines Day in 1989 in Hampton, Virginia. He has a younger brother, Sean Chavis, who is currently serving in the U.S. Navy as a chief air traffic controller.\n\n\n\n"}

He is married to Dorothy Ranaghan, and has six children and twelve grandchildren.\n\nKevin Ranaghan was born in New York City in 1940 to parents of Irish Catholic descent.\n\nWhile completing his doctoral degree in liturgical studies in the theology department at the University of Notre Dame, Kevin met his future wife, Dorothy. They were married in 1966.\n\nRanaghan heard about a new work of the Holy Spirit in the lives of some friends at Duquesne University. After an initial period of skepticism, their prayer and study led him and his new wife to be baptized in the Holy Spirit on March 5, 1967.\n\nIn 1969, the Ranaghans published \"Catholic Pentecostals\", the first book detailing the history of this renewal movement and articulating its theological implications. They linked baptism in the Spirit to a renewal of the sacraments of initiation. The book was translated into several languages, and Kevin Ranaghan traveled extensively, both in and out of the United States, to spread the news about this Pentecostal outpouring in the church. His travels brought him into contact not only with Catholic groups throughout the world, but also with groups of Protestants from Pentecostal, mainline, and evangelical streams of Christianity. Ranaghan served as a bridge between Catholics and those from other denominations who, for the first time in history, were experiencing a simultaneous and similar renewal in the Spirit.\n\nRanaghan was ordained a permanent Catholic deacon in 1973. He joined the United States National Service Committee for the Catholic Charismatic Renewal for 15 years, and for 11 years was its executive director. He has been a principal organizer of national and international conferences, especially the 1975 Catholic Leaders Conference in Rome, and the 1977 Ecumenical Conference in Kansas City. Currently serving as an ICCRS Council member representing community expression of the renewal, Kevin also serves as council vice-president. He was a member of the council from the time of its establishment in the late 1970s until 1984. In 1990, he returned to the Council in his present role.\n\nRanaghan was a founding member of the People of Praise, an ecumenical Christian covenant community.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1840974", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1840974", "title": "Hero (Mariah Carey song)", "text": "Hero (Mariah Carey song)\n\n\"Hero\" is a song by American singer and songwriter Mariah Carey. It was released on October 19, 1993, via Columbia Records as the second single from Carey's third studio album, \"Music Box\" (1993). Originally intended for Gloria Estefan, the song was written and produced by Mariah and Walter Afanasieff. While writing the song, Carey did not connect to its style or sound, therefore forfeiting it over to the soundtrack of the film of the same name. However, after being convinced to keep it, she changed some of the lyrics to more precisely fit her personality. Lyrically, the song is regarded as one of Carey's most inspirational and personal ballads, with its protagonist declaring that even though people may feel discouraged or down at times, in reality, they are \"heroes\" if they look inside themselves and see their own inner strength; in time, it will help them \"find the way\".\n\nThe song received mixed reviews from contemporary music critics for its lyrical content, while Carey's vocal performance was praised. Aside from its lyrics, \"Hero\" derived its hook and sound from several musical instruments such as the guitar, piano, and organ. The song experienced strong success in several international markets, and also became Carey's eighth chart topper on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. Additionally, it was ranked number 53 on the Decade-End Chart. Outside the United States, \"Hero\" enjoyed strong charting, reaching the top five in Canada, France, Ireland, New Zealand and Norway and the top ten in Australia and the United Kingdom.\n\nDue to fan requests and letters, as well as their connection to its personal meaning and content, the song remains one of Carey's most performed songs. Deemed by many as her signature song, the song was originally performed on \"The Arsenio Hall Show\", \"The Tonight Show with Jay Leno\", and \"Hey Hey It's Saturday\" during its original chart run. Additionally, Carey performed it on several live telethons and specials, such as \"Pavarotti and Friends\" and \"Michael Jackson & Friends\" in 1999, \"\" in 2001, Live 8 in 2005, and the inaugural ball for Barack Obama in 2009. Additionally, the song was featured on the set-lists of all of Carey's tours, usually serving as the encore or closing number, and making its debut during the album's accompanying set of concerts, the Music Box Tour. The song was included on several of Carey's compilation albums, \"#1's\" (1998), \"Greatest Hits\" (2001), \"The Ballads\" (2008), and \"#1 to Infinity\" (2015).\n\nThroughout the course of her career, Carey has re-recorded the song twice and filmed other music videos aside from the original. The first music video for the song was filmed by Larry Jordan in July 1993 during a private concert at Proctor's Theatre, later released on the home video \"Here Is Mariah Carey\". In 2001, following the September 11 attacks, Carey re-recorded the song as a mash-up single titled \"Never Too Far/Hero Medley\", a medley with her single at the time, \"Never Too Far\". Additionally, prior to the release of her compilation album \"The Ballads\", Carey re-recorded \"Hero\" and filmed a new video featuring behind the scenes footage of the studio. \"Hero\" won two ASCAP Rhythm & Soul Music Awards, one ASCAP Pop Music Award and one BMI Pop Award for the Songwriter Award. The song has been covered many times during both studio and live recordings, such as on global singing competitions.\n\nMariah Carey's second studio album, \"Emotions\" (1991), contained influences from mostly 1950s, 1960s and 1970s balladry and gospel, as well as her continued work of R&B and soul. The album, while praised by some as more mature and raw, failed to reach the critical or commercial heights of her debut effort, and could not introduce Carey to a different market. Following these events, Columbia decided to market the singer in a similar fashion to her debut, only have her produce a more commercial and radio-friendly album. Their plans were to tone down Carey's vocals, and soften the album's production, leaving a more contemporary pop record. Agreeing to the change, Carey and producer Walter Afanasieff began writing and recording material for her third studio effort, \"Music Box\" (1993).\n\nThe B-side for the single, Everything Faces Away, was never included on the \"Music Box\" album, and was not performed by Carey for years until the early 2020 leg of her The Butterfly Returns residency, when she performed parts of the song with her background singers and singer JoJo as part of a series of snippet videos recorded for her fans.\n\nAside from her work as a vocalist and record artist, Carey was becoming known as a songwriter, having penned and produced all of her own material throughout her career. During the production of \"Music Box\", she was approached by Epic Records to write and record a song alongside Afanasieff, and release it on the soundtrack to the 1992 film \"Hero\", featuring Dustin Hoffman and Geena Davis. While Carey was interested in the project, Mottola was very adamant over allowing Carey to take part in anything involving film, fearing it would hurt her career. Additionally, Columbia felt uneasy about allowing their highest-selling recording artist to contribute to another label, even a branch of the same parent company, Sony. So they wanted to try the next best thing, which was to have us write something.\" Still interested in working for the film, Carey agreed to pen the feature song for the film, intended for fellow female singer, Gloria Estefan. Carey and Afanasieff sat together in a studio in New York, and over the course of two hours, composed the song's melody, lyric and concept. In an interview with Fred Bronson, Afanasieff discussed the process in which they had completed the rough version of the song:\n\nI went to New York and we were in the studio and came to a break. I was sitting at the piano and told Mariah about this movie. Within two hours, we had this incredible seed for this song, 'Hero'. It was never meant for Mariah to sing. In her mind, we were writing a song for Gloria Estefan for this movie. And we went into an area that Mariah didn't really go into-in her words, it was a little bit too schmaltzy or too ballady or too old-fashioned as far as melody and lyrics.\nAs they completed the song's demo, Tommy Mottola, CEO of Sony Music Entertainment and Carey's fiancé, walked into the studio. After hearing the rough version of the song, on which they were still working, he became interested in it, asking what project the song belonged to. Carey explained to him the concept and how the song would be used for the film \"Hero\". Mottola immediately took an intense liking to the song, responding, \"Are you kidding me? You can't give this song to this movie. This is too good. Mariah, you have to take this song. You have to do it.\" Initially, Carey was guided by the subject of the film, but Afanasieff acknowledged that she made it a very personal song after deciding to keep it, altering some of the lyrics, key and instrumentation. After their decision to keep \"Hero\", Afanasieff went back to the staff at Epic and told them that they had failed to come up with a song for the soundtrack. Estefan never heard the tune was originally meant for her, and the song that ended up in the soundtrack was \"Heart of a Hero\", written, produced and recorded by Luther Vandross. In the following weeks, after completing the song, Afanasieff spoke with Bronson about its recording, and how Carey created several versions of the track:\n\nThere was a simpler performance on tape and a more difficult one, with Mariah singing out more, with more licks. But we chose a happy medium. The song really calls for not anything really fancy. But she's always fighting the forces inside of her because she's her own devil's advocate. She wants to do something that's so over the top and use her talents and the voice she has. But she also knows she has to restrain herself and do what the music really calls for.\n\"Hero\" is a mid-tempo ballad. It was written and produced by Carey and Afanasieff, and was released as the second single from her third studio album, \"Music Box\". It incorporates music from several musical instruments, including the piano, guitar and organ. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Alfred Music Publishing, the song is set in common time with a moderate tempo of 62 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of E major with Carey's vocal range spanning from the low-note of G to the high-note of E. The song's chorus has a basic chord progression of G–G–G/F–Em–G/D–C-G/B–Am. Originally, Carey felt the song was \"too schmaltzy\" and over the top for her, and not in line with her other work. However, after being convinced by Mottola to keep the song, Carey changed the song and personalized it, during which time she grew to feel a connection to the song and its lyrics. According to author Chris Nickson, \"Hero\" is one of Carey's most personal and inspirational ballads. Carey has described how the song was never her favorite, however, after all the fan letters and messages she received about the song, she felt the need to perform it as often as possible. In an interview with Fred Bronson, Carey described the song's meaning to her and to fans:\n\nOne person could say that 'Hero' is a schmaltzy piece of garbage, but another person can write to me a letter and say, 'I've considered committing suicide every day of my life for the last ten years until I heard that song, and I realized, after all, I can be my own hero,' and that, that's an unexplainable feeling, like I've done something with my life, you know? It meant something to someone.\nThe song's lyrics describe of the individual power that lies inside every person, their ability to be their own hero. According to author Carol K. Ingall, the song inspires anyone to be a hero. Ingall continued how due to a hero's power to transform and inspire those around them, so too every person has inside of them the light and force needed to help change the world. Similarly, author Darlene Wade connects the song's lyrical content to the power within the soul, however also with the inclusion of God.\n\nAccording to Maryellen Moffitt, author of \"See It, Be It, Write It\", \"Hero\" is about looking into oneself and discovering the inner courage inside each individual, and being strong and believing in oneself through times of trouble and adversity. Morffitt claims the song personally helped him get through difficult moments when \"the answers seemed so far away\". Following her taped performance of \"One Sweet Day\" at the Honda Center in Anaheim, California during The Adventures of Mimi Tour, Carey described the song's importance to her and her fans:\n\nI wrote a song a while back even before \"One Sweet Day\" and it was not my favorite song in the world, but I wrote it. Someone asked me to write a song and they told me the story, and you know it was kind of a moving concept or whatever. And I did it, and I was like you know it’s not necessarily what I like per se, but after doing the song over and over again and having people coming up to and saying, thank you for writing ‘Hero’ because it saved my life or it saved my father’s life or my brothers or sisters life, or something of that nature, I said I always have to sing that song when I’m performing because if I don’t, you never know who I’m leaving out and you know what, in times of my life I’ve had to turn to that song lyrically and flip it onto my own life and sing it to myself. So its from the ‘Music Box’ album, and it’s called ‘Hero', this is for you.\n\"Hero\" was the subject of two copyright plagiarism cases; one by Christopher Selletti and the other by Rhonda Dimmie, filed in 1993 and 1996. Selletti claimed he had written the song's lyrics in the form of a poem. One day, as he drove Sly Stone in a limousine to Long Island, he claimed to show him the poem. Selletti claimed Stone complimented the poem, taking it and promising to patent it and earn him royalties. After many months, the pair fell out of contact, leading Selletti to mail himself the envelope and poem, performing a \"poor man's copyright\". Three years later in 1996, he claimed to listen to Carey's album \"Music Box\" and was shocked when he noted the song's similar lyrics. He filed a lawsuit against Carey, Stone, Sony and Stone's manager Jerry Goldstein. Selletti claimed that Stone must have sold or contributed the lyrics to Carey during the recording of the album in late 1992. However, since Stone did not receive songwriting credits on \"Hero\", Selletti then dropped the suit against Stone, leaving him against Carey and Sony. Prior to their courtroom meeting, Carey told \"New York Daily News\" \"I feel totally victimized. 'Hero' is my creation and it holds a very special meaning to me. I have every intention of fighting this all the way.\" In court, Carey provided evidence to her innocence, in the form of a dated lyrical and music notebook, with conceptual info on the song dated back to November 20, 1992, prior to Selletti's meeting with Stone. Additionally, Carey stated the fact that she had originally written it for the film \"Hero\" alongside Afanasieff, making their connection or the involvement of his material impossible. Judge Denny Chin found Carey innocent, and ordered Selletti to pay her a fine.\n\nYears later, after consulting with another lawyer, Selletti made another attempt at suing Carey and Sony. His lawyer, Jeffrey Levitt, had uncovered the fact that the film was released in October 1992, a full six weeks prior to the November 22 dating in Carey's notebook. Additionally, \"Heart of a Hero\", which was written by Luther Vandross for the film, was submitted in January 1992, making it impossible for \"Hero\" to have been the original choice of song for the soundtrack. After uncovering further tapes from the studio dating to the summer of 1992, recordings provided evidence that Carey and Afansieff had indeed discussed and had parts of the song completed well before the film's October release. Following the evidence from both parties, the judge dismissed the case, ruling in Carey's favor for the second time. Following the dismissal of the case, Rhonda Dimmie, another songwriter and an independent singer, filed a lawsuit against Carey, this time claiming the song to have borrowed heavily from her song \"Be Your Own Hero\". During the short deposition made by Carey, Afanasieff revealed that they had written the song in two days during the summer of 1992, \"within a matter of hours\". Soon after, the case was dismissed, with the judge claiming there to not be sufficient evidence on Dimmie's behalf. Following the lawsuits, in 2001 Selletti made further hints to plan another lawsuit, as well as a forensic team of specialists to conduct research on the incident. Following the suits, Cindy Berger, Carey's publicist released the following statement: \"This case has been thrown out of court three times. The federal judge after hearing Selletti's story and considering all the evidence ruled the case was a 'complete fabrication' and that it was filed 'to extort a settlement from deep-pocket defendants.\"\n\n\"The Baltimore Sun\" critic J.D. Considine praised \"Hero\", writing, \"[Hero] is a lavish, soul-stirring ballad, the sort of thing other singers would pay Diane Warren to write.\" Additionally, he called its chorus \"uplifting\" and \"soaring\", following praise towards Carey's vocal performance. Rik Ambelle from \"Crawley News\" noted in his review of \"Music Box\", that Carey \"really is at her best\" on ballads like \"Hero\". \"Entertainment Weekly\" wrote, \"There’s a timelessness to “Hero” that’s almost jarring — it’s such a classic chest-pounder that it’s as if we’ve always had “Hero,” and the imaginary movie scene to go with it.\" Pop Rescue noted that Carey's vocals \"are flawless, and the song flows perfectly along with her.\" Nathan Brackett from \"Rolling Stone\" called Carey's vocal tone \"golden\" and regarded the song as a standard for weddings, funerals and singing auditions. \n\nThe song received a mixed review from \"The Washington Post\" editor Mike Joyce, who while impressed, claimed it was not as good as competing ballads of the time. Paul Gettelmen of the \"Orlando Sentinel\" criticized the song, calling it a \"rip-off\" of Whitney Houston's \"Greatest Love of All\". Stephen Holden, another editor from \"Rolling Stone\" also noted an inspiration and similarity to \"Greatest Love of All\" and calling its lyrics \"made up entirely of pop and soul clichés\".\n\n\"Hero\" became Carey's eighth chart topper on the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100. It reached the number one position in its tenth week and spent four weeks at the top, from December 25, 1993 to January 15, 1994. It replaced \"Again\" by Janet Jackson, and was replaced by Bryan Adams, Rod Stewart and Sting's \"All for Love\". In total, the song remained in the top 40 for 25 weeks, with 16 of those spent in the top ten. On the \"Billboard\" year-end Charts for 1994, \"Hero\" finished at number five, number 53 on the decade-end chart and number three on the year-end Airplay Chart. \"Hero\" has been certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), denoting shipments of over one million units throughout the country.

Two weeks later, \"Hero\" managed to reach number 67 on the chart, before plummeting outside the top 100 the following week. As of 2010, MTV estimates sales of \"Hero\" in the United Kingdom to be at 270,000 units.\n\n\"Hero\" was awarded and nominated for awards throughout the music industry. At the 12th ASCAP Awards, Carey took home the award for \"Rhythm & Soul Songwriter\". The following year, at the 13th annual ceremony, \"Hero\" won Carey awards for \"Rhythm & Soul Songwriter\" and \"Pop Songwriter\". The song was awarded a BMI Pop Award at the ceremony in 1995. Additionally, it was nominated for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance at the 37th annual Grammy Awards, losing to Sheryl Crow's \"All I Wanna Do\".\n\nPrior to the song's release towards the end of 1993, Carey performed an intimate concert at Proctor's Theatre, New York on July 15, 1993. Following its taping, the concert was released as the home video titled, \"Here Is Mariah Carey\" (1993). Carey's performance of the song that night was edited and commissioned as the official music video, directed by Larry Jordan. The video was included on Carey's DVD \"#1's\" (1998). The video features her in a long dark dress, sporting long curly hair. On few international versions of the album, a Spanish version of the song was included, such as on the Mexican and Argentinian versions. It was titled \"Héroe\", and featured translation by Jorge Luis Piloto, a Spanish musician who had come to briefly work with Carey.\n\nIn 2001, following the September 11 attacks, Carey re-recorded the song as a medley with \"Never Too Far\", her single at the time. Titled \"Never Too Far/Hero Medley\", it was released as a charity single throughout October of that year. In an interview with MTV, Carey described the idea behind the medley:\n\n\"I started [performing] at different charity events where I did a combination of 'Never Too Far' and 'Hero'. We made it into a medley and kinda put them both in the same key and just made it work, and people responded really well to it. It's been interesting for me, since the events of September 11, the way people have been playing 'Hero' and talking to me about 'Never Too Far', 'cause that song is also about loss. I figured that it would be a nice thing to do, to put them both out for Christmas. ... I feel like it's our responsibility to do what we can right now in terms of music, just being artists and being human beings.\"\n\nIn 2008, prior to the release of Carey's compilation album \"The Ballads\", Carey recorded a version of \"Hero\" with new vocals, releasing it on the stateside version of the album. Additionally, a music video was filmed and released for the 2008 version, featuring behind the scenes footage of the song's recording, as well as Carey's writing music in the studio.\n\nThe music video on YouTube has 238 million views as of January 2020.\n\nDue to fan requests and its personal lyrical content, Carey has performed \"Hero\" on several occasions throughout her career. She first performed the song in July 1993 at the Proctor's Theater, later to be released as \"Here Is Mariah Carey\". Later, she performed the song live on \"The Arsenio Hall Show\" in November 1993, appearing on stage after a short interview wearing a mid-length black gown and sporting long brown locks. She was joined by three back-up vocalists, Trey Lorenz, Cindi Mizelle and Melodie Daniels. Carey continued stateside promotion of the song with a performance on \"The Jay Leno Show\" the following week. Throughout Europe and Australasia, Carey made appearances on \"Sacrée Soirée\" in France, \"Platendaagse\" in the Netherlands, \"Sale El Dia\" in Spain, \"Sontagsoppet\" in Sweden, and \"Hey Hey It's Saturday\" in Australia. On May 15, 1996, at the Annual National Peace Officers Memorial Service, held in the grounds of the US Capitol Building, Carey performed Hero in tribute to police officers killed in the line of duty. In attendance was the US president at the time, Bill Clinton. Following the release of her sixth studio album \"Butterfly\", Carey performed it alongside \"Butterfly\" on \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\" on September 22, 1997. In between both performances, Winfrey interviewed Carey over her failed marriage to Mottola, as well as the several negative rumors that followed their divorce. Two years later, she performed \"Hero\" together with Luciano Pavarotti in Modena, Italy during the summer of 1999. Carey appeared on stage alongside him, wearing a long pink evening gown and sporting a long straightened hairstyle. The performance was filmed and released on VHS as \"Pavarotti and Friends\".\n\nCarey sang \"Hero\" in Seoul, South Korea in June 1999 during the \"Michael Jackson & Friends\" benefit concert, which raised money for several charitable organizations. On September 21, 2001, following the September 11 attacks, Carey sang \"Hero\" as part of the \"\" telethon. Her appearance on the telethon was her first public appearance since her publicized breakdown and hospitalization, prior to the release of \"Glitter\". In 2003, Carey performed a medley of songs from her album, \"Charmbracelet\" (2002), during Michael Jordan's final NBA All-Star Game in 2003 Following the medley, she included \"Hero\" onto the short set-list, followed by Jordan's final game. On July 2, 2005, a benefit concert was held in Hyde Park, London titled Live 8. The televised event was watched by over 9.6 million British citizens, and held a live audience of over 200,000. Carey performed a three-song set-list, opening with \"Make It Happen\" and \"Hero\", which featured a live choir of African children, and followed by \"We Belong Together\", accompanied by actors Chris Barrie, Judy Flynn, Mike Burns and Julia St. John. During a promotional tour for her eleventh studio effort \"E=MC2\" in 2008, the song was re-recorded by the 2008 UK X Factor finalists and released as a single.

On June 5, 2010, Carey performed the song alongside \"We Belong Together\" at the Walmart shareholders meeting. Following the performance, Carey gained heavy media coverage for her apparent weight gain, leading many to suspect her pregnancy with husband Nick Cannon.\n\nAside from the several live televised performances, Carey included \"Hero\" on the set-lists on all of her tours, usually serving as one of the closing numbers. In an interview, Carey said that although it is not one of her favorite songs, she tries to perform it on each of her shows due to its powerful message, fearing that if she doesn't, she might miss out on the opportunity to help someone. She first performed the song in concert during her stateside Music Box Tour. During the song's recital, Carey donned a black gown and matching sandals, while sporting her signature golden locks of the time. During her performances at the Tokyo Dome on her Daydream World Tour (1996), Carey performed the song as one of the closing numbers. Prior to the song, Carey introduced Afanasieff, who played the organ throughout the tour. Carey appeared on stage with a straightened hairstyle, and a long black evening gown. On her Butterfly World Tour in 1998, Carey performed \"Hero\" as the eighth song on the set-list. Unlike her previous tour, Afanasieff was not present, due to the pair's continued personal dispute. During the song, Carey was backed up by three vocalists, and wore a long sequined black gown. In 2000, during her Rainbow World Tour, Carey used \"Hero\" as the tour's closing number, leaving the stage to meet and greet fans during the song's performance. Similarly, \"Hero\" served as the closing number on her Charmbracelet World Tour (2002–03), where she wore a long beige gown and feathered frock tail. In 2006, during The Adventures of Mimi Tour, Carey performed \"Hero\" as the penultimate song on the set-list.

In addition, she included the song in her 2015 Las Vegas residency, \"Mariah Carey Number 1's\", a chronicle of her 18 US number 1 hits. The song was performed 8th in her setlist. She sang on a circular platform on the stage, donning a short white dress.\n\n\"Hero\" has been covered several times through live performances, as well as recorded studio versions. Additionally, since its debut, it has achieved strong media attention. In 2009, prior to the election results, Barack Obama's wife Michelle played him the song to give him strength and inner support. A source close to Carey claimed that hearing the song's use meant a lot to her, saying, \"She was blown away when she heard. She is so honoured to have played her part in such an occasion.\" At the 1994 Essence Awards, Aretha Franklin performed a live rendition of the song as a tribute to The Reverend Jesse Jackson. In 2001, Neal Schon performed an instrumental version on the album Voice. Filipino singers Regine Velasquez and Sarah Geronimo both performed the song live on television, with the former playing a medley of the song alongside Carey's \"Anytime You Need a Friend\".

Barbadian R&B singer Rihanna sang \"Hero\" during a live talent show at her high school in Barbados when she was 15. Soon after, she was signed by Jay-Z to Def Jam. \"The X Factor\" winner Melanie Amaro performed the song during the first season of the show, as a song chosen for her by the public. In 2013, Dami Im recorded a version for her album Dami Im. The album was #1 in Australia.\n\n\nCredits adapted from the \"Music Box\" liner notes.\n\n\"Hero\" was recorded at The Plant Studios, Sausalito, California and The Record Plant, Los Angeles. Vocals were mixed at Right Track Studios, New York.\n\nThe twelve finalists from the fifth series of the British TV talent show \"The X Factor\" released a cover of the song on October 27, 2008 for the Help for Heroes and The Royal British Legion charities. The finalists performed the single for the first time on October 25, 2008 during Week 3 of the live broadcasts. The single was released on download on October 26, 2008, followed by the physical release the day after.\n\nOn October 30, it was announced that the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, Alistair Darling, would waive all tax on copies sold on the single. He said, \"I support the efforts being made by the \"X Factor\" contestants and in recognition of that I'm proposing effectively to waive the VAT on the sale of these singles. We will do that by making a donation equivalent to the value of the VAT.\" Following the single's release, the music video was sent to music channels on November 8 before the fifth live show, when the finalists (excluding Diana Vickers, absent because of illness) sang it again. All the finalists appeared in the video, which also showed still images of soldiers in Iraq. The finalists performed the song again with Mariah Carey on November 8, 2008 during Week 5 of the live broadcasts, a week in which Carey's music and career served as the theme.\n\nUpon its release, the single was expected to top the charts in the United Kingdom, due to strong promotional push from Cowell and his management. On November 2, 2008, it debuted atop of the UK Singles Chart, staying there for three consecutive weeks and becoming the fastest-selling single of 2008. The song sold 100,000 copies in the first day of its release and 313,244 copies by the end of the week. It raised over £1 million for Help for Heroes.\n\nIt was suggested that the song would become one of the biggest-selling releases of the decade, with HMV spokesman Gennaro Castaldo saying: \"This is proving to be one of the biggest single releases for years if not the decade. Only Leona Lewis's debut hit \"A Moment Like This\", which sold over 500,000 copies in its first week, can compare. It's selling more than most Christmas No 1s would, and HMV has placed an urgent order for more copies.\" On December 28, 2008, the UK Singles Chart listed it as the second biggest selling single for the year end countdown and the nineteenth best-selling single of the decade. The British Phonographic Industry (BPI) certified the song double-platinum, denoting shipments of over 1.2 million copies within the country.\n\n\n"}

His family later moved to East 13 Street, in Manhattan's East Village.\n\nFrom an early age, Abrams began playing the guitar and piano. He was in several early bands; among them Heavy Impact - in which he played both guitar and keyboards alongside Joe Wells (guitar), Lemar Washington (guitar), Marston \"Buffy\" Freeman (bass guitar), Ronald Simmons (drums), Harry Jones (trumpet), and Barbara Mills (saxophone). In 1976, he formed Conservative Manor, 94 East (the band featuring Prince on lead guitar).\n\nHe became popular on the New York underground scene via radio and club play, and had his first major hit in 1984 with \"Music Is the Answer\", on the independent label Streetwise. Other hits in the mid 1980s included \"Leave the Message Behind the Door\", \"Trapped\" (a top ten hit in Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, and the UK), \"The Truth\", \"Speculation\", \"I'm Not Gonna Let You\", and \"Over and Over\", establishing Abrams as a solo artist, initially in Europe and later in the US.\n\nIn 1985, he signed to Steven Machat's label and production company, AMI. Machat, who was collaborating and working with a British producer, Richard James Burgess, hired Burgess to produce Abrams' self-titled debut album. Machat then arranged for MCA Records to sign Abrams for worldwide releases. Burgess produced the songs \"Trapped\", \"I'm Not Gonna Let You\", and \"Table for Two\".\n\n\"Trapped\" reached the top five in the UK Singles Chart and topped the US Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart in 1985, followed by his self-titled album, which spent two weeks at number one the following year. An electronic remix of \"Trapped\" was later released in 1995 by Boards of Canada, under the pseudonym Hell Interface. A new version of \"Trapped\" (\"Trapped 2006\") was released in the UK.\n\n\"I'm Not Gonna Let\" also spent a week at number one in the dance chart, in 1986. The album peaked at number 75 on the US Billboard Top 200 and Number 13 on the US Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. Although Abrams had no American pop hits during his career, he had a number of entries on the US Hot Dance Club Play chart in the 1980s and 1990s, including four entries that hit number one. In 1987, he had his fourth number-one US dance hit with \"How Soon We Forget\", the same year that he released his second album, \"You and Me Equals Us\".\n\nOn January 9, 2007, Abrams released the single \"Just When You Thought\", the third single on his own record label, Colonel Records, after \"Heartbreaker\" and \"Let Us All Be Friends\". Also in 2007, Abrams released \"Never Be\", \"Just Like Mathematics\", and \"True Stories\". In June 2008, his single, \"Only a Few\", was issued.\n\nIn August 2011, he performed at the '80s Reunion'.\n\nA crowdfunding campaign was launched in 2015, via GoFundMe, in order to help Abrams, as he was homeless, suffering from diabetes, and in poor health. Marshall Jefferson, who had begun his own effort to crowdfund an album, encouraged others to donate to Abrams instead, stating:\n\nAs most of you may or may not know, a lot of recording artists don’t have medical coverage or benefits ... Those of us who have listened to his awesome music and know of his plight, have banded together to try to help him through this rough patch.\n\nAbrams died on Thanksgiving Day, November 24, 2016. Numerous music industry luminaries paid tribute online, such as Tony Tune Herbert, Joey Negro, Dave Pearce, and Swizz Beatz. Jellybean Benitez, a producer who worked on Madonna's \"Holiday\" and Whitney Houston's \"Love Will Save the Day\", wrote: \"It's a sad day for the House Music community\". Jefferson wrote, \"Just learned Colonel Abrams passed away,\" and added, \"Never to be forgotten, R.I.P.\"\n\nOn June 25, 2019, \"The New York Times Magazine\" listed Colonel Abrams among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1841001", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1841001", "title": "George Copway", "text": "George Copway\n\nGeorge Copway (1818 – June 27, 1869) was a Mississaugas Ojibwa writer, ethnographer, Methodist missionary, lecturer, and advocate of indigenous peoples. His Ojibwa name was \"Kah-Ge-Ga-Gah-Bowh\" (\"Gaagigegaabaw\" in the Fiero orthography), meaning \"He Who Stands Forever\". In 1847 he published a memoir about his life and time as a missionary. This work made him Canada's first literary celebrity in the United States. In 1851 he published \"The Traditional History and Characteristic Sketches of The Ojibway Nation,\" the first published history of the Ojibwa in English.\n\nCopway was born near Trenton, Ontario, into a Mississauga Anishinaabe family; his father John Copway was a Mississauga chief and medicine man. His parents converted to Methodism in 1827. Beginning in the 1830s, the young Copway attended the local mission school.\n\nIn July 1834, together with an uncle and cousin, he was invited to work with a Methodist minister as a missionary to Ojibwe who lived near the western part of Lake Superior. His activities in two different areas over the next few years included working with Reverend Sherman Hall in La Pointe, Wisconsin to translate the Christian Acts of the Apostles and the Gospel of St Luke into Ojibwa. In 1838 the Methodists provided for Copway's education in Illinois, and later ordained him as a minister.\n\nIn 1840, Copway met Elizabeth Howell, an English woman whose family were farmers in the Toronto area. They married and moved to Minnesota to serve as missionaries. They had a son, George Albert Copway (1843 – 1873) and a daughter Frances Minne-Ha-Ha (Copway) Passmore (1863–1921) during their marriage.\n\nThe couple later returned to Canada in 1842, where Copway served as a missionary for the Saugeen and Rice Lake Bands of the Ojibwa. He was elected vice-president of the Ojibwe General Council. In 1846, he was accused and convicted of embezzlement by the Indian Department. Because of this, he was defrocked by the Methodists.\n\nThe Copways moved to New York City, where he wrote and published a memoir, \"The Life, History and Travels of Kah-ge-ga-gah-Bowh\" (1847), republished in London in 1850 as \"Recollections of a forest life; or, the life and travels of Kah-ge-ga-gah-bowh.\" It was the first book published by a Canadian First Nations person. It had six printings in the first year and rapidly became a bestseller.\n\nDuring the 1840s, he toured and lectured in the United States and also traveled to Europe. That travel provided him with the material for his book of sketches of Europe, \"Running sketches of men and places, in England, France, Germany, Belgium, and Scotland,\" published in 1851 after his book on the history of the Ojibwe. During this period, Copway acted as an advocate for a Native American territory, suggesting a 150-square mile territory be established in what was the American Midwest east of the Missouri River. The tribes in the area were under increasing pressure of encroachment by European-American settlers. This proposal was never approved by the United States Congress, but Copway attracted considerable attention from leading intellectuals of the time, including the historian Francis Parkman.\n\nIn 1851, Copway started his own weekly newspaper in New York City, titled \"Copway's American Indian,\" which ran for approximately three months. He had attracted \"letters of support from the eminent ethnologists Lewis Henry Morgan and Henry Rowe Schoolcraft, from Parkman, and from the novelists James Fenimore Cooper and Washington Irving.\"\n\nCopway's career subsequently spiralled downward as he began drinking heavily and sank into debt, and in 1858 his wife Elizabeth Howell Copway took his daughter, Frances Minne-Ha-Ha, and left him. Copway traveled throughout New York and Michigan as a herbalist 'street healer' and a Union army recruiter. Copway died in 1869 in Ypsilanti, Michigan.\n\nCopway's 1847 memoir and his 1851 history of the Ojibwe \"The Traditional History and Characteristic Sketches of The Ojibway Nation\" included many details about their traditional culture. He dedicated a few chapters to the use of birch bark scrolls, the symbolic writing that was used, and the meaning of various symbols. These elaborate scrolls were used to remember songs, history, and ceremonies. The care and reproduction of these scrolls by a select few is described in detail. \n\nA recurring theme in Copway's publications is the use of alcohol by Euromericans to weaken Native American social fabric:\nThe introduction of spirituous liquors...has been greater than all other evils combined. Intemperance and disease. The fire-water has done its work of disaster. By it the glad shouts of the youth of our land have died away in wails of grief! Fathers have followed their children to their graves. Children have sent their wail of woe, echoing from vale to vale. And around the cheering fires of the Indian, the white man has received the gain of avarice. Peace and Happiness entwined around the fire-side of the Indian once. Union, harmony, and a common brotherhood cemented them all. But as soon as these vile drinks were introduced, dissipation commenced, and the ruin and downfall of a noble race has gone on — every year lessening their numbers.\n\nIn 2018, Copway was designated a National Historic Person by the Canadian federal government (through the Minister of Environment & Climate Change).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1841006", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1841006", "title": "Larry Charles", "text": "Larry Charles\n\nLarry Charles (born December 1, 1956) is an American comedian, screenwriter, director, actor, and producer. He was a staff writer for the sitcom \"Seinfeld\" for its first five seasons, contributing some of the show's darkest and most absurd storylines. He has also directed the documentary film \"Religulous\" and the mockumentary comedy films \"Borat\", \"Brüno\", and \"The Dictator\". His Netflix documentary series \"Larry Charles' Dangerous World of Comedy\" premiered in 2019.\nCharles was born in Brooklyn, New York City, New York to a Jewish family. He was raised in Trump Village, located between Brighton Beach and Coney Island in Brooklyn.\n\nAfter graduating from John Dewey High School, he attended college at Rutgers University in New Jersey, but he left school to perform comedy routines.\n\nCharles performed stand-up comedy during the 1970s until he was hired to write for the short-lived sketch comedy show \"Fridays\", where he worked with Larry David. This began Charles's career in television writing that included \"The Arsenio Hall Show\" and eventually \"Seinfeld\". David gave him the job as a writer on \"Seinfeld\" and his directorial debut on \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\".\n\nAlthough series co-creators Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld wrote the bulk of the show's episodes during the first five seasons (This is inaccurate, they wrote most episodes in seasons 1 & 2 but by season 4 they were writing a minority of episodes), Charles was their second in command during this period. Charles had met \"Seinfeld\" co-creator David when he was part of the writing staff of the ABC sketch show \"Fridays\", on which David and Michael Richards were also part of the show's ensemble cast. Charles had been unable to write for the show's first season, as he had been writing for \"The Arsenio Hall Show\".\n\nCharles is noted for contributing some of the show's darker storylines and scenes. In the season two episode \"The Baby Shower\" Charles wrote a dream sequence in which the title character, Jerry Seinfeld, was killed. Charles's episodes also covered such controversial topics as Nazis (in \"The Limo\"), a psychotic stalker (in \"The Opera\") and a hospital patient committing suicide (in \"The Bris\"). A season two episode he wrote, \"The Bet\", concerning Elaine buying a handgun to protect herself, was never filmed because NBC, some of the cast, and the show's director felt the gun content was too provocative. Charles claimed that his writing on \"Seinfeld\" was heavily influenced by \"Dragnet\", \"Superman\" and Abbott and Costello.\n\nCharles said he was instrumental in the development of Cosmo Kramer; he felt that \"Jerry and George were so well-defined through Larry David and Jerry, that there was less room for me to, sort of, expand on those personas.

So I spent a lot of time with Kramer because he was a character that I could have an impact on in the future of the show\". It was Charles who imbued in Kramer a distrust of authority (especially in his episodes \"The Baby Shower\" and \"The Heart Attack\"), and who created the character of Kramer's notorious unseen friend Bob Sacamano, after his real-life friend of the same name.\n\nCharles's feature debut was \"Masked and Anonymous\" (2003) which he directed, and co-wrote with Bob Dylan (under the pseudonyms Rene Fontaine and Sergei Petrov, respectively). The film received a mixed reaction from audiences and critics alike; it did poorly at the box office. Charles maintains it takes many viewings to get true enjoyment from the film: \"I want the movie to be like a great Bob Dylan song that is listened to over and over and for people to [go] back and see it again and get a lot more things, or totally different things.\"\n\nHis second feature film as director, the Sacha Baron Cohen comedy mockumentary \"Borat!\", was much more successful; it \"set new records in terms of profitability; on a budget of 18 million dollars, it grossed in excess of 261 million dollars.\" In an interview, Charles discussed how, because of the nature of the mockumentary process, he had to act as well, even if none of his performance made it to the screen: \"We all, especially me, had to play a character as well. I wasn't Larry Charles when we were on the road. We all had to be in character, and we had to balance that with our aesthetic and logistical needs to produce the movie properly [...] The director also had to act.\" The film was nominated for Best Motion Picture — Musical or Comedy at the Golden Globes.\n\nCharles's third film was \"Religulous\" — a documentary about Bill Maher's take on the state of contemporary religion — which was released in October 2008.\n\nCharles rarely performs live, but has appeared at Un-Cabaret and can be heard on several of its podcasts.\n\nCharles also has a cameo in the episode titled \"The Parking Garage,\" which was written by David.\n\nIn 1995, Charles left the writing staff of \"Seinfeld\" to join that of another hugely successful mid-1990s sitcom: Paul Reiser's \"Mad About You\".\n\nCharles served as executive producer on two short-lived programs, \"The Tick\" (for which he wrote two episodes), and the \"Dilbert\" animated series, which he co-developed with Scott Adams and co-wrote the following episodes:\nIn 2000, Charles began his first job as a director on \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\", Larry David's follow-up series to \"Seinfeld\" (which Larry David co-created). Charles directed 18 episodes of the hit HBO show.\n\nCharles served as an executive producer and writer on the HBO show \"Entourage\" for the first two seasons. The episodes that he wrote were:\n\n"}

It featured online photo storage, sharing, viewing on a mobile phone, getting Kodak prints of digital pictures, and creating personalized photo gifts. The service was originally launched in 1999 as Ofoto, and was acquired by Kodak in 2001, renamed Kodak EasyShare Gallery in 2005, and shortly thereafter shortened to Kodak Gallery. At its peak in 2008, it served over 60 million users and billions of images. Subsequent to the bankruptcy of the parent Kodak, Shutterfly placed a stalking horse bid on Kodak Gallery on March 1, 2012, for $23.8 million. Kodak Gallery was shut down on July 2, 2012. Photos were transferred to Shutterfly.\n\nOfoto's online photography service was started in June 1999, in Berkeley, California. The company was founded by Lisa Gansky and Kamran Mohsenin. Gansky had previously been CEO of 1990s internet pioneer GNN, while Mohsenin had previously run Tunes Network, Inc., parent of the Tunes.com music discovery Website. The Ofoto website launched to the public on December 13, 1999, the same day as competing service Shutterfly. While Shutterfly was funded in part by Silicon Valley businessman James Clark, Ofoto was funded in part by Jim Barksdale, Clark's former partner and co-worker from Netscape. This led to the brief \"Clark vs. Bark\" photo wars. Ofoto started by simply allowing users to upload JPEG images to the online service, to share online photo albums with friends, and to purchase physical silver-halide prints of photos. In 2000, Ofoto added a 35mm online film processing service and an online frame store. In following years, Ofoto added 4-color offset printed invitations and cards, and services for mobile phones.\n\nIn May 2001, Ofoto was purchased by Eastman Kodak. Ofoto, Inc. became a wholly owned subsidiary of Kodak and later became the Kodak Imaging Network, Inc. In 2005, the Ofoto web service was rebranded as the Kodak EasyShare Gallery. In October 2006, Kodak Gallery launched a new line of products designed by American crafts and home decorating expert Martha Stewart. In July 2008, Kodak decided to mail the Kodak Gallery users obliging them to purchase something through their website. If not, consumers would lose their pictures as Kodak blocked their photo albums after their proposed deadline. Kodak Gallery received a number of awards. In the July 2006 issue, PC World named Kodak EasyShare Gallery one of The 100 Best Products of the Year. In August 2007, the Wall Street Journal selected Gallery as the winner in an online photo services shootout. In October 2008, the Boston Globe selected Kodak Gallery as the winner in a review of online photo service web sites.\n\nUploading photos to Kodak Gallery was free, but unless purchases (e.g., of prints) were made on the site, the pictures were only stored for 90 days and then deleted. The site's terms of service specified that \"To maintain free storage, you need to meet the following minimum purchase requirement within 90 days of first uploading images, and then every 12 months thereafter ... If you do not purchase the required amount as set forth above from us for a period of 12 months, we may delete the images stored in your account.\" The minimum purchases required was between $5 and $20, depending on the amount of pictures stored. Kodak received some negative press for deleting photos if users did not order prints after a certain amount of time. Digital photo frame customers complained that web connected photo frame (often costing $300 or more) galleries were not exempted from the policy. Further criticism came from a former executive who alleged that she was wrongfully fired for complaining about a plan to reduce image quality in order to save on storage costs without giving adequate notice to customers.\n\nIn addition to standard custom photo merchandise (such as prints, photo books, stickers, calendars, mugs, cards, apparel, etc.), Kodak Gallery also provided the following services:\n\n\n"}

Unlike survey meters, gamma counters are designed to measure small samples of radioactive material, typically with automated measurement and movement of multiple samples.\n\nGamma counters are usually scintillation counters. In a typical system, a number of samples are placed in sealed vials or test tubes, and moved along a track. One at a time, they move down inside a shielded detector, set to measure specific energy windows characteristic of the particular isotope. Within this shielded detector there is a scintillation crystal that surrounds the radioactive sample. Gamma rays emitted from the radioactive sample interact with the crystal, are absorbed, and light is emitted. A detector, such as a photomultiplier tube converts the visible light to an electrical signal. Depending on the half-life and concentration of the sample, measurement times may vary from 0.02 minutes to several hours.\n\nIf the photon has too low of an energy level it will be absorbed into the scintillation crystal and never be detected. If the photon has too high of an energy level the photons may just pass right through the crystal without any interaction. Thus the thickness of the crystal is very important when sampling radioactive materials using the Gamma Counter.\n\nGamma counters are standard tools used in the research and development of new radioactive compounds used for diagnosing and treating disease, (as in PET scanning). Gamma counters are used in radiobinding assays, radioimmunoassays (RIA) and Nuclear Medicine measurements such as GFR and hematocrit.\n\nSome gamma counters can be used for gamma spectroscopy to identify radioactive materials based on their output energy spectrum, e.g. as a wipe test counter.\n"}

The Surface Emission Rate (SER), not the source activity, is used as a measure of the rate of particles emitted from the source of radiation. The SER is the true emission rate from the surface, which is usually different to the activity. This difference is due to self-shielding within the active layer of the source which will reduce the SER, or backscatter which will reflect particles off the backing plate of the active layer and will increase the SER. Beta particle plate sources usually have a significant backscatter, whereas alpha plate sources usually have no backscatter, but are easily self-attenuated if the active layer is made too thick.\n\nCounting efficiency varies for different isotopes, sample compositions and scintillation counters. Poor counting efficiency can be caused by an extremely low energy to light conversion rate, (scintillation efficiency) which, even optimally, will be a small value. It has been calculated that only some 4% of the energy from a β emission event is converted to light by even the most efficient scintillation cocktails.\n\nProportional counters and end-window Geiger-Muller tubes have a very high efficiency for all ionising particles that reach the fill gas. Nearly every initial ionising event in the gas will result in Townsend avalanches, and thereby an output signal. However the overall detector efficiency is largely affected by attenuation due to the window or tube body through which particles have to pass.\n\nIn the case of gamma photons the detection efficiency is more dependent upon the fill gas and gamma energy. Low energy photons will interact more with the fill gas than high energy photons.\n\n"}
{"id": "1841031", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1841031", "title": "Autoland", "text": "Autoland\n\nIn aviation, autoland describes a system that fully automates the landing procedure of an aircraft's flight, with the flight crew supervising the process. Such systems enable airliners to land in weather conditions that would otherwise be dangerous or impossible to operate in.\n\nAutoland systems were designed to make landing possible in visibility too poor to permit any form of visual landing, although they can be used at any level of visibility. They are usually used when visibility is less than 600 meters runway visual range and/or in adverse weather conditions, although limitations do apply for most aircraft—for example, for a Boeing 747-400 the limitations are a maximum headwind of 25 kts, a maximum tailwind of 10 kts, a maximum crosswind component of 25 kts, and a maximum crosswind with one engine inoperative of five knots. They may also include automatic braking to a full stop once the aircraft is on the ground, in conjunction with the autobrake system, and sometimes auto deployment of spoilers and thrust reversers.\n\nAutoland may be used for any suitably approved instrument landing system (ILS) or microwave landing system (MLS) approach, and is sometimes used to maintain currency of the aircraft and crew, as well as for its main purpose of assisting an aircraft landing in low visibility and/or bad weather.\n\nAutoland requires the use of a radar altimeter to determine the aircraft's height above the ground very precisely so as to initiate the landing flare at the correct height (usually about ). The localizer signal of the ILS may be used for lateral control even after touchdown until the pilot disengages the autopilot. For safety reasons, once autoland is engaged and the ILS signals have been acquired by the autoland system, it will proceed to landing without further intervention, and can be disengaged only by completely disconnecting the autopilot (this prevents accidental disengagement of the autoland system at a critical moment) or by initiating an automatic go-around. At least two and often three independent autopilot systems work in concert to carry out autoland, thus providing redundant protection against failures. Most autoland systems can operate with a single autopilot in an emergency, but they are only certified when multiple autopilots are available.\n\nThe autoland system's response rate to external stimuli work very well in conditions of reduced visibility and relatively calm or steady winds, but the purposefully limited response rate means they are not generally smooth in their responses to varying wind shear or gusting wind conditions – i.e., not able to compensate in all dimensions rapidly enough – to safely permit their use.\n\nThe first aircraft to be certified to CAT III standards, on 28 December 1968, was the Sud Aviation Caravelle, followed by the Hawker-Siddeley HS.121 Trident in May 1972 (CAT IIIA) and to CAT IIIB during 1975. The Trident had been certified to CAT II on 7 February 1968.\n\nAutoland capability has seen the most rapid adoption in areas and on aircraft that must frequently operate in very poor visibility. Airports troubled by fog on a regular basis are prime candidates for Category III approaches, and including autoland capability on jet airliners helps reduce the likelihood that they will be forced to divert by bad weather.\n\nAutoland is highly accurate. In his 1959 paper, John Charnley, then Superintendent of the UK Royal Aircraft Establishment's (RAE) Blind Landing Experimental Unit (BLEU), concluded a discussion of statistical results by saying that \"It is fair to claim, therefore, that not only will the automatic system land the aircraft when the weather prevents the human pilot, it also performs the operation much more precisely\".\n\nPreviously, autoland systems have been so expensive that they were rarely used on small aircraft. However, as display technology has developed the addition of a head up display (HUD) allows for a trained pilot to manually fly the aircraft using guidance cues from the flight guidance system. This significantly reduces the cost of operating in very low visibility, and allows aircraft that are not equipped for automatic landings to make a manual landing safely at lower levels of look ahead visibility or runway visual range (RVR). In 1989, Alaska Airlines was the first airline in the world to manually land a passenger-carrying jet (Boeing B727) in FAA Category III weather (dense fog) made possible with the head-up guidance system.\n\nCommercial aviation autoland was initially developed in Great Britain, as a result of the frequent occurrence of very low visibility conditions in winter in North-west Europe. These occur particularly when anticyclones are in place over central Europe in November/December/January when temperatures are low, and radiation fog easily forms in relatively stable air. The severity of this type of fog was exacerbated in the late 1940s and 1950s by the prevalence of carbon and other smoke particles in the air from coal burning heating and power generation. Cities particularly affected included the main [UK] centres, and their airports such as London Heathrow, Gatwick, Manchester, Birmingham and Glasgow, as well as European cities such as Amsterdam, Brussels, Paris, Zurich and Milan. Visibility at these times could become as low as a few feet (hence the \"London fogs\" of movie fame) and when combined with the soot created lethal long-persistence smog: these conditions led to the passing of the UK's \"Clean Air Act\" which banned the burning of smoke-producing fuel.\n\nPost 1945, the British government had established two state-owned airline corporations – British European Airways (BEA) and British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC), which were subsequently to be merged into today's British Airways. BEA's route network focused on airports in the UK and Europe, and hence its services were particularly prone to disruption by these particular conditions.\n\nDuring the immediate post-war period, BEA suffered a number of accidents during approach and landing in poor visibility, which caused it to focus on the problems of how pilots could land safely in such conditions. A major breakthrough came with the recognition that in such low visibility the very limited visual information available (lights and so on) was extraordinarily easy to misinterpret, especially when the requirement to assess it was combined with a requirement to simultaneously fly the aircraft on instruments. This led to the development of what is now widely understood as the \"monitored approach\" procedure whereby one pilot is assigned the task of accurate instrument flying while the other assesses the visual cues available at decision height, taking control to execute the landing once satisfied that the aircraft is in fact in the correct place and on a safe trajectory for a landing. The result was a major improvement in the safety of operations in low visibility, and as the concept clearly incorporates vast elements of what is now known as crew resource management (although predating this phrase by some three decades) it was expanded to encompass a far broader spectrum of operations than just low visibility.\n\nHowever, associated with this \"human factors\" approach was a recognition that improved autopilots could play a major part in low-visibility landings. The components of all landings are the same, involving navigation from a point at altitude en route to a point where the wheels are on the desired runway. This navigation is accomplished using information from either external, physical, visual cues, or from synthetic cues such as flight instruments. At all times, there must be sufficient total information to ensure that the aircraft's position and trajectory (vertical and horizontal) are correct. The problem with low visibility operations is that the visual cues may be reduced to effectively zero, and hence there is an increased reliance on \"synthetic\" information. The dilemma faced by BEA was to find a way to operate without cues, because this situation occurred on its network with far greater frequency than on that of any other airline. It was particularly prevalent at its home base – London Heathrow Airport – which could effectively be closed for days at a time.\n\nThe UK government's aviation research facilities including the Blind Landing Experimental Unit (BLEU) set up during 1945/46 at RAF Martlesham Heath and RAF Woodbridge to research all the relevant factors. BEA's flight technical personnel were heavily involved in BLEU's activities in the development of Autoland for its Trident fleet from the late 1950s. The work included analysis of fog structures, human perception, instrument design, and lighting cues amongst many others. After further accidents, this work also led to the development of aircraft operating minima in the form we know them today. In particular, it led to the requirement that a minimum visibility must be reported as available before the aircraft may commence an approach – a concept that had not existed previously. The basic concept of a \"target level of safety\" (10-7) and of the analysis of \"fault trees\" to determine probability of failure events stemmed from about this period.\n\nThe basic concept of autoland flows from the fact that an autopilot could be set up to track an artificial signal such as an Instrument Landing System (ILS) beam more accurately than a human pilot could – not least because of the inadequacies of the electro-mechanical flight instruments of the time. If the ILS beam could be tracked to a lower height then clearly the aircraft would be nearer to the runway when it reached the limit of ILS usability, and nearer to the runway less visibility would be required to see sufficient cues to confirm the aircraft position and trajectory. With an angular signal system such as ILS, as altitude decreases all tolerances must be decreased – in both the aircraft system and the input signal – to maintain the required degree of safety. This is because certain other factors – physical and physiological laws which govern for example the pilot's ability to make the aircraft respond – remain constant. For example, at 300 feet above the runway on a standard 3 degree approach the aircraft will be 6000 feet from the touchdown point, and at 100 feet it will be 2000 feet out. If a small course correction needs 10 seconds to be effected at 180 kts it will take 3000 ft. It will be possible if initiated at 300 feet of height, but not at 100 feet. Consequently, only a smaller course correction can be tolerated at the lower height, and the system needs to be more accurate.\n\nThis imposes a requirement for the ground-based, guidance element to conform to specific standards, as well as the airborne elements. Thus, while an aircraft may be equipped with an autoland system, it will be totally unusable without the appropriate ground environment. Similarly, it requires a crew trained in all aspects of the operation to recognise potential failures in both airborne and ground equipment, and to react appropriately, to be able to use the system in the circumstances from which it is intended. Consequently, the low visibility operations categories (Cat I, Cat II and Cat III) apply to all 3 elements in the landing – the aircraft equipment, the ground environment, and the crew. The result of all this is to create a spectrum of low visibility equipment, in which an aircraft's autoland autopilot is just one component.\n\nThe development of these systems proceeded by recognising that although the ILS would be the source of the guidance, the ILS itself contains lateral and vertical elements that have rather different characteristics. In particular, the vertical element (glideslope) originates from the projected touchdown point of the approach, i.e. typically 1000 ft from the beginning of the runway, while the lateral element (localiser) originates from beyond the far end. The transmitted glideslope therefore becomes irrelevant soon after the aircraft has reached the runway threshold, and in fact the aircraft has of course to enter its landing mode and reduce its vertical velocity quite a long time before it passes the glideslope transmitter. The inaccuracies in the basic ILS could be seen in that it was suitable for use down to 200 ft. only (Cat I), and similarly no autopilot was suitable for or approved for use below this height.\n\nThe lateral guidance from the ILS localiser would however be usable right to the end of the landing roll, and hence is used to feed the rudder channel of the autopilot after touchdown. As aircraft approached the transmitter its speed is obviously reducing and rudder effectiveness diminishes, compensating to some extent for the increased sensitivity of the transmitted signal. More significantly however it means the safety of the aircraft is still dependent on the ILS during rollout. Furthermore, as it taxis off the runway and down any parallel taxiway, it itself acts a reflector and can interfere with the localiser signal. This means that it can affect the safety of any following aircraft still using the localiser. As a result, such aircraft cannot be allowed to rely on that signal until the first aircraft is well clear of the runway and the \"Cat. 3 protected area\".\n\nThe result is that when these low visibility operations are taking place, operations on the ground affect operations in the air much more than in good visibility, when pilots can see what is happening. At very busy airports, this results in restrictions in movement which can in turn severely impact the airport's capacity. In short, very low visibility operations such as autoland can only be conducted when aircraft, crews, ground equipment and air and ground traffic control all comply with more stringent requirements than normal.\n\nThe first \"commercial development\" automatic landings (as opposed to pure experimentation) were achieved through realising that the vertical and lateral paths had different rules. Although the localiser signal would be present throughout the landing, the glide slope had to be disregarded before touchdown in any event. It was recognised that if the aircraft had arrived at decision height (200 ft) on a correct, stable approach path – a prerequisite for a safe landing – it would have momentum along that path. Consequently, the autoland system could discard the glideslope information when it became unreliable (i.e. at 200 ft), and use of pitch information derived from the last several seconds of flight would ensure to the required degree of reliability that the descent rate (and hence adherence to the correct profile) would remain constant. This \"ballistic\" phase would end at the height when it became necessary to increase pitch and reduce power to enter the landing flare. The pitch change occurs over the runway in the 1000 horizontal feet between the threshold and the glide slope antenna, and so can be accurately triggered by radio altimeter.\n\nAutoland was first developed in BLEU and RAF aircraft such as the English Electric Canberra, Vickers Varsity and Avro Vulcan, and later for BEA's Trident fleet, which entered service in the early 1960s. The Trident was a 3-engined jet built by de Havilland with a similar configuration to the Boeing 727, and was extremely sophisticated for its time. BEA had specified a \"zero-visibility\" capability for it to deal with the problems of its fog-prone network. It had an autopilot designed to provide the necessary redundancy to tolerate failures during autoland, and it was this design which had triple redundancy.\n\nThis autopilot used three simultaneous processing channels each giving a physical output. The fail-safe element was provided by a \"voting\" procedure using torque switches, whereby it was accepted that in the event that one channel differed from the other two, the probability of two similar simultaneous failures could be discounted and the two channels in agreement would \"out-vote\" and disconnect the third channel. However, this triple-voting system is by no means the only way to achieve adequate redundancy and reliability, and in fact soon after BEA and de Havilland had decided to go down that route, a parallel trial was set up using a \"dual-dual\" concept, chosen by BOAC and Vickers for the VC10 4-engined long range aircraft. This concept was later used on the Concorde. Some BAC 1-11 aircraft used by BEA also had a similar system.\n\nThe earliest experimental autopilot-controlled landings in commercial service were not in fact full auto landings but were termed \"auto-flare\". In this mode, the pilot controlled the roll and yaw axes manually while the autopilot controlled the \"flare\" or pitch. These were often done in passenger service as part of the development program. The Trident's autopilot had separate engagement switches for the pitch and roll components, and although the normal autopilot disengagement was by means of a conventional control yoke thumb-button, it was also possible to disengage the roll channel while leaving the pitch channel engaged. In these operations the pilot had acquired full visual reference, normally well above decision height, but instead of fully disengaging the autopilot with the thumb-button, called for the second officer to latch off the roll channel only. He then controlled the lateral flight path manually while monitoring the autopilot's continued control of the vertical flight path – ready to completely disengage it at the first sign of any deviation. While this sounds as if it may add a risk element in practice it is of course no different in principle to a training pilot monitoring a trainee's handling during on-line training or qualification.\n\nHaving proven the reliability and accuracy of the autopilot's ability to safely flare the aircraft, the next elements were to add in similar control of the thrust. This was done by a radio altimeter signal which drove the autothrottle servos to a flight idle setting. As the accuracy and reliability of the ground based ILS localiser was increased on a step by step basis, it was permissible to leave the roll channel engaged longer and longer, until in fact the aircraft had ceased to be airborne, and a fully automatic landing had in fact been completed. The first such landing in a BEA Trident was achieved at RAE Bedford (by then home of BLEU) in March 1964. The first on a commercial flight with passengers aboard was achieved on flight BE 343 on 10 June 1965, with a Trident 1 G-ARPR, from Paris to Heathrow with Captains Eric Poole and Frank Ormonroyd.\n\nSubsequently, autoland systems became available on a number of aircraft types but the primary customers were those mainly European airlines whose networks were severely affected by radiation fog. Early Autoland systems needed a relatively stable air mass and could not operate in conditions of turbulence and in particular gusty crosswinds. In North America, it was generally the case that reduced but not zero visibility was often associated with these conditions, and if the visibility really became almost zero in, for example, blowing snow or other precipitation then operations would be impossible for other reasons. As a result, neither airlines nor airports placed a high priority on operations in the lowest visibility. The provision of the necessary ground equipment (ILS) and associated systems for Category 3 operations was almost non existent and the major manufacturers did not regard it as a basic necessity for new aircraft. In general, during the 1970s and 1980s, it was available if a customer wanted it, but at such a high price (due to being a reduced production run item) that few airlines could see a cost justification for it.\n\nHowever in the 1980s and 1990s, there was increasing pressure globally from customer airlines for at least some improvements in low visibility operations; both for flight regularity and from safety considerations. At the same time, it became evident that the requirement for a true zero-visibility operation (as originally envisaged in the ICAO Category definitions) had diminished, as clean-air laws had reduced the adverse effect of smoke adding to radiation fog in the worst affected areas. Improved avionics meant that the technology became cheaper to implement, and manufacturers raised the standard of the \"basic\" autopilot accuracy and reliability. The result was that on the whole the larger new airliners were now able to absorb the costs of at least Category 2 autoland systems into their basic configuration.\n\nSimultaneously, pilot organizations globally were advocating the use of Head Up Display systems primarily from a safety viewpoint. Many operators in non-sophisticated environments without many ILS equipped runways were also looking for improvements. The net effect was pressure within the industry to find alternative ways to achieve low visibility operations, such as a \"hybrid\" system which used a relatively low reliability autoland system monitored by the pilots via a HUD. Alaska Airlines was a leader in this approach and undertook a lot of development work with Flight Dynamics and Boeing in this respect.\n\nHowever, a major problem with this approach was that European authorities were very reluctant to certificate such schemes as they undermined the well proven concepts of \"pure\" autoland systems. This impasse was broken when British Airways became involved as a potential customer for Bombardier's Regional Jet, which could not accommodate a full Cat 3 autoland system, but would be required to operate in those conditions. By working with Alaska Airlines and Boeing, British Airways technical pilots were able to demonstrate that a hybrid concept was feasible, and although British Airways never eventually bought the regional jet, this was the breakthrough needed for international approval for such systems which meant that they could reach a global market.\n\nThe wheel turned full circle in December 2006 when London Heathrow was affected for a long period by dense fog. This airport was operating at maximum capacity in good conditions, and the imposition of low visibility procedures required to protect the localiser signal for autoland systems meant a major reduction in capacity from approximately 60 to 30 landings per hour. Since most airlines operating into Heathrow already had autoland-equipped aircraft, and thus expected to operate as normal, massive delays occurred. The worst affected airline was of course British Airways, as the largest operator at the airport.\n\nGarmin Aviation started studying an emergency autoland feature in 2001 and launched the program in 2010 with more than 100 employees, investing around $20 million.\nFlight tests began in 2014 with 329 test landings completed in a Cessna 400 Corvalis and another 300 landings in other aircraft.\nThe feature is activated by a guarded red button on Garmin G3000 avionics, evaluating winds, weather and fuel reserves to select a suitable diversion airport and taking over the aircraft controls to land, it advises the ATC and displays instructions to occupants.\n\nA Piper M600 single-engine turboprop began flight tests in early 2018 and completed more than 170 landings to seek pending FAA certification.\nProviding access to more than 9,000 runways over , it is offered from 2020 for $170,000 including extra equipment.\nIt will also be certified for the single-engine Cirrus Vision SF50 jet from 2020, landing on runways over , and eventually be offered on the SOCATA-Daher TBM 900 and others.\n\nA typical autoland system consists of an ILS (integrated glideslope receiver, localizer receiver, and perhaps GPS receiver as well) radio to receive the localizer and glideslope signals. The output of this radio will be a deviation from center which is provided to the flight control computer; this computer which controls the aircraft control surfaces to maintain the aircraft centered on the localizer and glideslope. The flight control computer also controls the aircraft throttles to maintain the appropriate approach speed. At the appropriate height above the ground (as indicated by the radio altimeter) the flight control computer will retard the throttles and initiate a pitch-up maneuver. The purpose of this \"flare\" is to reduce the energy of the aircraft such that it stops flying and settles onto the runway.\n\nFor CAT IIIc, the flight control computer will continue to accept deviations from the localizer and use the rudder to maintain the aircraft on the localizer (which is aligned with the runway centerline.) On landing the spoilers will deploy (these are surfaces on the top of the wing towards the trailing edge) which causes airflow over the wing to become turbulent, destroying lift. At the same time the autobrake system will apply the brakes. The anti-skid system will modulate brake pressure to keep all wheels turning. As the speed decreases, the rudder will lose effectiveness and the pilot will need to control the direction of the airplane using nose wheel steering, a system which typically is not connected to the flight control computer.\n\nFrom an avionics safety perspective, a CAT IIIc landing is the worst-case scenario for safety analysis because a failure of the automatic systems from flare through the roll-out could easily result in a \"hard over\" (where a control surface deflects fully in one direction.) This would happen so fast that the flight crew may not effectively respond. For this reason autoland systems are designed to incorporate a high degree of redundancy so that a single failure of any part of the system can be tolerated (fail active) and a second failure can be detected – at which point the autoland system will turn itself off (uncouple, fail passive). One way of accomplishing this is to have \"three of everything.\" Three ILS receivers, three radio altimeters, three flight control computers, and three ways of controlling the flight surfaces. The three flight control computers all work in parallel and are in constant cross communications, comparing their inputs (ILS receivers and radio altimeters) with those of the other two flight control computers. If there is a difference in inputs, then a computer can \"vote out\" the deviant input and will notify the other computers that \"RA1 is faulty.\" If the outputs don't match, a computer can declare itself as faulty and, if possible, take itself off line.\n\nWhen the pilot arms the system (prior to capture of either the localizer or glideslope) the flight control computers perform an extensive series of built In tests. For a CAT III landing, all the sensors and all the flight computers must be in good health before the pilot receives an \"AUTOLAND ARM\" indication (generic indications that will vary depending on equipment supplier and aircraft manufacturer). If part of the system is in error, then an indication such as \"APPROACH ONLY\" would be presented to inform the flight crew that a CAT III landing is not possible. If the system is properly in the ARM mode, when the ILS receiver detects the localizer, then the autoland system mode will change to \"LOCALIZER CAPTURE\" and the flight control computer will turn the aircraft into the localizer and fly along the localizer. A typical approach will have the aircraft come in \"below the glideslope\" (vertical guidance) so the airplane will fly along the localizer (aligned to the runway centerline) until the glideslope is detected at which point the autoland mode will change to CAT III and the aircraft will be flown by the flight control computer along the localizer and glideslope beams. The antennas for these systems are not at the runway touch down point however, with the localizer being some distance beyond the runway. However at a predefined distance above the ground the aircraft will initiate the flare maneuver, maintain the same heading, and settle onto the runway within the designated touch down zone.\n\nIf the autoland system loses redundancy prior to the decision height, then an \"AUTOLAND FAULT\" error message will be displayed to the flight crew at which point the crew can elect to continue as a CAT II approach or if this is not possible because of weather conditions, then the crew would need to initiate a go-around and proceed to an alternative airport.\n\nIf a single failure occurs below decision height, \"AUTOLAND FAULT\" will be displayed; however, at that point the aircraft is committed to landing and the autoland system will remain engaged, controlling the aircraft on only two systems until the pilot completes the rollout and brings the aircraft to a full stop on the runway or turns off the runway onto a taxiway. This is termed \"fail-active.\" However, in this state the autoland system is \"one fault away\" from disengaging so the \"AUTOLAND FAULT\" indication should inform the flight crew to monitor the system behavior very carefully and be ready to take control immediately. The system is still fail-active and is still performing all necessary cross-checks so that if one of the flight control computers decides that the right thing to do is order a full deflection of a control surface, the other computer will detect that there is a difference in the commands and this will take both computers off line (fail-passive) at which time the flight crew must immediately take control of the aircraft as the automatic systems have done the safe thing by taking themselves off line.\n\nDuring system design, the predicted reliability numbers for the individual equipment which makes up the entire autoland system (sensors, computers, controls, and so forth) are combined and an overall probability of failure is calculated. As the threat exists primarily during the flare through roll-out, this exposure time is used and the overall failure probability must be less than one in a million.\n\n\n"}

It states clearly that actions which involve helping an enemy state against India are strongly condemned. It also states that one cannot approach, inspect, or even pass over a prohibited government site or area like an electrical substation. According to this Act, helping the enemy state can be in the form of communicating a sketch, plan, model of an official secret, or of official codes or passwords, to the enemy.\n\nPunishments under the Act range from three to life imprisonment (if intent is to declare war against India - section 5 )imprisonment. A person prosecuted under this Act can be charged with the crime even if the action was unintentional and not intended to endanger the security of the state. The Act only empowers persons in positions of authority to handle official secrets, and others who handle it in prohibited areas or outside them are liable for punishment.\n\nJournalists have to help members of the police forces above the rank of the sub-Inspector and members of the military with investigation regarding an offense, up to and including revealing his sources of information.\n\nUnder the Act, search warrants may be issued at any time if the magistrate determines that based on the evidence there is enough danger to the security of the state.\n\nUninterested members of the public may be excluded from court proceedings if the prosecution feels that any information which is going to be passed on during the proceedings is sensitive. This also includes media.\n\nWhen a company is seen as the offender under this Act, everyone involved with the management of the company, including the board of directors, can be liable for punishment. In the case of a newspaper, everyone – including the editor, publisher and the proprietor — can be imprisoned for an offense.\nOSA is controversial to the modern RTI act 2005.\n\nIn the OSA clause 6, information from any governmental office is considered official information, hence it can be used to override Right to Information Act 2005 requests. This has drawn harsh criticism.\nthe supreme court of india has also held that the RTI overrides OSA.\n\nIn June 2002, journalist Iftikhar Gilani was, arrested for violating the OSA 1923. He was charged under the OSA, with a case under the Obscenity Act added to it. The first military report suggested that the information he was accused of holding was \"secret\" despite being publicly available. The second military intelligence report contradicted this, stating that there was no \"official secret\". Even after this, the government denied the opinion of the military and was on the verge of challenging it when the contradictions were exposed in the press.\n\nThe military reported that, \"the information contained in the document is easily available\" and \"the documents carries no security classified information and the information seems to have been gathered from open sources\".\n\nOn 13 January 2004, the government withdrew its case against him to prevent having two of its ministries having to give contradictory opinions. Gilani was released the same month.\n\nAfter reviewing the provisions of the act, the Union Home Ministry in July 2017 submitted a report to the Cabinet secretariat. The goal was to amend the act to make it more transparent and in line with the Right to Information Act, 2005.\n\nA Delhi court in a 2009 judgement, in a case involving the publication of excerpts of a cabinet note in the Financial Express ten years earlier by Santanu Saikia, greatly reduced the powers of the act by ruling publication of a document merely labelled \"secret\" shall not render the journalist liable under the law.\n\nSaikia was arrested in February, 2015 in another case that the police said involved the writing of stories and analyses from documents allegedly stolen from the government. He was released on bail in May after spending 80 days in jail.\n\n50 cases of violation of the Official Secrets Act were registered in the country since 2014. Of these 50 cases, 30 were registered in 2016, nine in 2015 and 11 in 2014 according to Union Minister of state for Home Hansraj Ahir. Of the 30 cases registered in 2016, eight were lodged in Tamil Nadu, followed by five each in Punjab and Uttar Pradesh.\n\nAttorney General KK Venugopal also told the three-judge bench that the government could invoke the Official Secrets Act 1923 ,against The Hindu newspaper, which had published the papers. He claims that the documents pertaining to the purchase of Rafale jets published by the media are genuine\nJustice Joseph one of the three judges on bench asked government about Right to information act 2005, Section section 22 of RTI act have an overriding effect for official secret act and section 24 of RTI which mandates even security and intelligence organisations to disclose information on corruption and human right violations. Finally section 8(2) which compels government to disclose information \"if public interest in disclosure outweighs the harm to protected interest\".\n\n"}

{"id": "1841068", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1841068", "title": "Yunzi", "text": "Yunzi\n\nYunzi (Traditional: 雲子; Simplified: 云子; Pinyin: Yúnzǐ; IPA [yn˧˥tsz̩˨˩˦]) refer to special weiqi (Go) pieces manufactured in the Chinese province of Yunnan. At various times in history they have also been termed \"yunbian\" (云扁) and \"yunyaozi\" (云窑子). Though technically Yunzi refers only to sintered stones made of \"yunzi\" material (the exact composition is a secret), the term can also sometimes connote stones which are single-convex of any material. Yunzi-style stones made of jade for instance, were often presented to the reigning emperor and his court in ancient China.\n\nYunzi are delicately made with a green luster yet are neither brittle nor slippery. The black and white pieces each have unique individual qualities. Old style white pieces are opaque with a tint of yellow or green. The black pieces are dark, and when held to the light have a translucent green hue. Newer yunzi, however, have pure white stones.\n\nThe production of yunzi started in the Tang dynasty and reached its peak in the Ming and Qing dynasties; the total verifiable history of \"yunzi\" spans at least five hundred years.\n\nAmong yunzi, most famous was the \"yongzi\" (永子) manufactured by Yongchang Fu (永昌府, today the city of Baoshan, Yunnan) during the Ming dynasty. It was said that after a fire broke out in an imperial treasury, one of the keepers, who was from Yongchang Fu, discovered that melted pearls and jade had a special luster. When he returned to his hometown, he fashioned yunzi out of the agate and amber for which Yongchang Fu was famous. These yunzi went on to be prized by the literati and were offered to the Emperor.\n\nYunzi also appeared frequently in Chinese literature as the subject of a number of verses penned over the years, being mentioned in works such as \"Ming Yi Tong Zhi\" (Ming Dynasty Comprehensive Geographic Survey) and Travels of Xu Xiake, both of which favored the yongzi.\n\nToday in Baoshan there are still people who have antiques dating from the Ming dynasty; among those there remain one and a half original yongzi sets.\n\nThe yunzi have also been presented to international dignitaries including Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nThe traditional art of making yunzi was lost during the first few years of the 20th century because of war in the region. In 1964, General Chen Yi examined the situation of yunzi while inspecting Yunnan. Zhou Enlai also inquired about the possible reproduction of yunzi. The Yunnan Sports Commission investigated the Yunzi manufacturing processes and rediscovered the art by reverse engineering a few original Yunzi.\n\nIn 1974, the state-run Yunnan Weiqi Factory began manufacturing yunzi stones. They are used in professional weiqi tournaments in China and elsewhere. According to Chinese law, the yunzi stones can only be produced by the state run Yunzi company. The company creates the yunzi in an old factory that was used by the American Flying Tigers as barracks during World War II. The formula is thought to be ground Yunnan mountain stones and agate.\n\nLike other types of Go stones, yunzi are washed and dried using a gentle soap solution to remove any dust from the packaging/manufacturing process. Although a light coat of oil, wiped clean, will help yunzi stones appear at their best, care must be taken in oiling yunzi. Because vegetable oils, such as olive or canola oil, are rancid oils, they should not be applied to yunzi to avoid unpleasant odor with time. Instead, common practice is to use an unscented mineral oil to oil yunzi; alternatively, stones may be washed but remain unoiled; over time, the natural oils incurred by human touch will polish yunzi to a sheen.\n\nLike glass Go stones, yunzi are very durable. However, like glass stones, yunzi are still at risk for chipping if they are dropped or otherwise come into sharp contact with hard surfaces such as metal, tile, or stone.\n\n\n"}

It rises south of the eastern Stanovoy Mountains and flows east, receiving tributaries from the Stanovoys. It borders the northern side of the Dzhagdy Range. At the eastern end of the Stanovoys it receives a \"Maya River\" (not the other Maya River) from the high country to the northwest and flows about into Uda Gulf (also known as Uda Bay) at the southwest corner of the Sea of Okhotsk near the Shantar Islands.\n\nFrom the Treaty of Nerchinsk (1689) to the Treaty of Aigun (1858) its lower course was officially part of the border between Russia and China, although the border was not clearly marked and the area rarely visited. Some of Ivan Moskvitin's men reached the Uda in 1640. The local Lamuts told them of the Zeya River and the Amur River but would not guide them inland. In 1684 some Cossacks fled from the Manchus on the Zeya River, reached Udsk, and went up the Maya River to Yakutsk.\n\nUdsk Ostrog (fort) was founded in 1679, or 1659 on the left bank of the river upstream. There were suggestions to move Okhotsk south to Udsk but this was rejected because of the poor harbor and the proximity of the Chinese border. There were generally about 10 peasant families around the fort trying to produce grain and a few thin cattle, but results were poor. Sometimes seed corn had to be imported. A pood of rye flour that cost half a ruble at Irkutsk cost 8 to 10 rubles at Udsk.

Pack horses were usually left at Udsk as food for sled dogs or people while the Yakut drivers returned to Yakutsk on foot or skis.

Broadnax (December 28, 1916 – June 1, 1992), also known as \"Wilbur\", \"Willie\", and \"Wilmer\", was an American hard gospel quartet singer during the golden age of traditional black gospel. His most common nickname was \"Little Axe,\" due to both his small stature and his brother William \"Big Axe\" Broadnax, who was a popular baritone.\n\nBroadnax was born in Houston, Texas in 1916, to William Broadnax and Gussie Frazier. By 1930 he lived with his step-father Augustus Flowers, mother Gussie Frazier, younger brother William Broadnax, and younger step-sister Armatha Broadnax in Houston. Broadnax was assigned female at birth, a fact which was only discovered upon his death and leads to confusion surrounding his early life.\n\nAlthough Willmer was the oldest of the three Broadnax children, most sources state that Willmer was the younger of the two brothers . As Armatha Broadnax is unmentioned after the 1930 census, it is possible Armatha took on Willmer's name after his death and truly was William's younger sibling. This would mean that Willmer Broadnax as known today was born in 1922 in Louisiana to Augustus Flowers and Gussie Frazier. It is also possible that Willmer was in fact the older brother and had already started using male pronouns by age thirteen, and that later he was mistaken as the younger brother because of his high voice and short stature.\n\nBroadnax began his career as a gospel singer during his teenage years with his brother William as a member of the St. Paul Gospel Singers in Houston in the 1930s. The two brothers moved to Los Angeles and joined Southern Gospel Singers, of which Willmer was a member of from 1939-1940; the group only performed on weekends and did not tour.\n\nThe brothers eventually broke off to form their own quartet, Little Axe and the Golden Echoes. Although William eventually left for Atlanta, where he joined the Five Trumpets, Willmer stayed on as lead singer throughout the 1940s. In 1949 the group, augmented by future member of The Soul Stirrers Paul Foster (singer), recorded a single of \"When the Saints Go Marching In\" for Specialty Records. Label chief Art Rupe decided to drop them before they could record a follow-up, and shortly thereafter the Golden Echoes disbanded.\n\nPianist Willie Love said during this period that, \"Little Axe couldn’t sing low, because he had a relatively high voice. It wasn’t falsetto, it was naturally high. So somebody had to sing the bottom.\" His point is clear in the recordings of the Golden Echoes, where Paul Foster's rich baritone and Broadnax's clear tenor riff off each other to create the illusion of a multi-octave lead singer. As music critic Ray Funk points out, \"Little Axe’s lead is absolutely distinctive on these cuts. He is the high lead that takes over from the baritone of Paul Foster. His voice is sweet but almost vicious, dripping with emotion, while Foster, in contrast, would offer almost a growl.\" \n\nIn 1950, Broadnax joined the Spirit of Memphis Quartet. Along with Broadnax, the group featured two other leads – Jethro \"Jet\" Bledsoe, a bluesy crooner, and Silas Steele, an overpowering baritone. The Spirit of Memphis Quartet recorded for King Records, and Broadnax appeared on their releases at least until 1952. Shortly after that, Broadnax moved on, working with The Fairfield Four, and in the early 1960s as one of the replacements for Archie Brownlee in the Five Blind Boys of Mississippi. Until 1965 Wilmer headed a quartet called \"Little Axe and the Golden Echoes,\" which released some singles on Peacock Records. By then, quartet singing was fading in commercial viability, and Broadnax retired from touring.\n\nIn retirement, Broadnax continued to record new material occasionally with the Blind Boys into the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nBroadnax was killed in 1992 by his lover Lavina Richardson (age 42 at the time), who was later found guilty of involuntary manslaughter on February 4, 1993. Leading up to the stabbing, Broadnax had allegedly been jealous of Richardson. Broadnax saw Richardson in a vehicle with another man, bumped his car into theirs, and dragged Richardson out. He then threatened her with a knife before he was disarmed by a bystander, whereupon Richardson picked up his knife and stabbed him three times. Broadnax died from his injuries several days later on June 1, 1992.\n\nUpon Broadnax's death in 1992, it was discovered that Broadnax was a trans man. This created a stir in the gospel community, with many prominent singers at the time insisting that they had suspected all along that his gender assigned at birth was female, including JoJo Wallace of the Sensational Nightingales who said, \"I always wondered about Axe.\" However, it is more likely that only his brother William \"Big Axe\" Broadnax and other close family members knew about his gender identity.\n\nThe intersection of Broadnax's gender and race created some issues for him on tour as public bathrooms were segregated. It was not uncommon for many gospel singers to be unable to use public restrooms where they performed. Broadnax was forced to keep his gender identity a secret by using the restroom alone, which also provoked from retrospective suspicion by Claude Jeter who said, \"Ax’d always go off by himself.\" \n\nOn June 25, 2019, \"The New York Times Magazine\" listed Little Axe and the Golden Echoes among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Established in 1948, Sciences Po Bordeaux is one of the ten Institutes of Political Studies of France and a Grandes école.\n\nAll students in Sciences Po Bordeaux study a curriculum that is highly practical and broad based, focusing on the full range of the social sciences: law, economics, finance, management, etc. The school is considered as one of the most selective in France, mainly because it is one of the schools where main political and business leaders are born.\n\nAccording to article 2 of an 18 December 1989 decree, the mission of Institutes of Political Studies is : 1° to contribute to the training of higher civil servants as well as executives in the public, para-public and private sectors, notably in the State and decentralized communities 2° to develop the research in political and administrative sciences\n\nAlumni include many notable public figures, including one French Prime Minister, politicians and influential businessmen.\n\nThe Institute has approximately 1,300 students, admitted after a rigorous selection. Each year, Sciences Po Bordeaux receives about 3000 applications and only around 150 students will be accepted after the selection process, around 5% in average. This process makes it one of the most difficult French Political Institute to be accepted in.\n\nThe academic course lasts five years, at the end of which a student graduates with the Diploma of Sciences Po Bordeaux (which is equivalent to a bachelor's degree) and with one of three Masters offered by the Institute.\n\nSciences Po Bordeaux is a well integrated university, with more than 200 exchange-agreements with foreign universities around the world. It also proposes double degree programs with the universities of Stuttgart (Germany), Turin (Italy), Coimbra (Portugal), Madrid (Spain), Cardiff (UK), Moscow (Russia), Kingston (Jamaica) and Quebec (Canada).\n\nThe school was established by decree on the 4th of May 1948 under the name \"Institut d'études politiques de l’Université de Bordeaux\". Maurice Duverger was its first director.

Ebi was selected out of Westbury Christian School by the Minnesota Timberwolves in the first round (26th pick overall) of the 2003 NBA draft.\n\nEbi was raised in Nigeria before moving to Houston, Texas as a teenager to attend high school. He holds both British and Nigerian citizenship.\n\nEbi is also a movie producer.\n\nEbi was the first first-round pick in three years for the Wolves; the team had forfeited five first-round picks after the team owner illegally made a deal with forward Joe Smith (the penalty was later reduced to three picks). After Ebi appeared in 19 games over the course of two seasons, Minnesota attempted to get an exception from the NBA so they could send him to the NBA Development League. Ebi was technically ineligible as the 2005–06 NBA season was his third year, and the D-League only accepted players who had been in the NBA for less than two years. Minnesota wanted to guide Ebi in, and they tacitly argued that Ebi was hardly a two-year veteran in the figurative sense, given his limited playing time. The league rejected Minnesota's request regarding Ebi, and to make room for Ronald Dupree, Minnesota released Ebi on 1 November 2005.\n\nEbi signed a free agent contract over the summer of 2006 with the Dallas Mavericks. After playing five pre-season games, averaging 5.2 points per game (ppg), Ebi was waived by the Mavericks on 26 October 2006.\n\nOn 30 September 2007, he signed with Israeli club Bnei HaSharon for one season.

He last managed Konyaspor. Before he made his debut 1980 with the amateur club Kabataş Altınmızrak in Istanbul, Kocaman performed gymnastics at the club Eczacıbaşı, winning 40 medals and reaching second place at the national level. 1984, he moved to Sakaryaspor in Adapazarı, Sakarya and turned professional. Then in 1988, Kocaman signed a contract with Fenerbahçe, where he played and contributed much to success of his club until he was transferred to Istanbulspor in 1996.\n\nHe is one of only 5 players who achiewed 200 goals in Süper Lig history. He was fired from Fenerbahçe despite his championship winning goal in the third from last game of the season against Trabzonspor. His gentle words and his regret for the beaten rival team apparently angered the club president Ali Şen. Kocaman played four seasons for Istanbulspor and, retired in 2000 as active player. Some say he played his last years to pass the 200 goal barrier. He was famous for a special move, where he would ease a high-pass on his chest and rocket the ball to the goal. In his playing years some fans named this move \"Aykut\" after him.\n\nAfter his career as a player Kocaman served as manager of Istanbulspor for four successive seasons. Uzan Family withdrew its support from Istanbulspor in 2001. Because of this, Istanbulspor fell into financial crisis, and became 9th in 2002–03 finally in 2003. In 2004, financial problems at Istanbulspor forced him to leave and he signed a two-year contract to coach Malatyaspor. He resigned in March 2005 from his duty at Malatyaspor. He coached Konyaspor in the 2005–06 season and Ankaraspor in the 2006–07 season. He returned to Ankaraspor in the 2008–09 season. He mentored the talented Turkish winger Özer Hurmacı and introduced him to professional football. He became Fenerbahçe's Director of Football in the 2009–10 season.\n\nOn 26 June 2010 Kocaman was announced as Fenerbahçe's new manager, taking over from Germany's Christoph Daum. Kocaman officialized his new role as team coach in a signing ceremony held at the Şükrü Saracoğlu Stadium. Fenerbahçe's President Aziz Yıldırım said; \"Everyone knows Aykut Kocaman's place in the history of Fenerbahçe. We all know how the supporters and community appreciate him. It gives me pleasure to see what we expected to take place in three years to actually happen today\". Kocaman when joining as Fenerbahçe's Manager;\n\"There are no words to describe this moment. I highly appreciate the club's management for their utter support i am thrilled and excited. I hope this new role of mine will be beneficiary to both myself and Fenerbahçe. In my personal life, I am a fearless person. I am never afraid of anything, however, what worries me most is not living up to people's expectations. Apart from that, I don't have any other concern\".\nKocaman Despite a bad start which included being knocked out of the UEFA Champions League in the third qualifying round by Young Boys and knocked out of the UEFA Europa League in the Play-off round by PAOK. However, in January Fenerbahçe knocked out of the 2010–11 Türkiye Kupası in the group stage. On 22 May 2011, Fenerbahçe won an 18th Süper Lig title in the 2010–11 season with a 4–3 win over Sivasspor moving ahead of the 17 titles won by arch-rivals Galatasaray. Despite a 9-points deficit after 16 games, Fenerbahçe went on to an astonishing 17 wins and one draw from the last 18 games of the season and won the title with 82 points. Trabzonspor also finished on 82 points but were held back to due head-to-head goal average in favor of Fenerbahçe. Kocaman is the only name in Fenerbahçe history‚ who won the championship both as a player and as a manager. In July 2011, as part of a major match-fixing investigation by authorities in Turkey, nearly 60 people suspected to be involved with fixing games were detained by İstanbul Police Department Organized Crime Control Bureau and then arrested by the court. The Turkish football corruption scandal is an ongoing investigation about match-fixing, bribery, starting a gang, organized crime and intimidation in Turkey's top two divisions, the Süper Lig and the First League. On 10 July 2011, the club president Aziz Yıldırım was remanded in custody over allegations of match-fixing.\n\nOn 19 July 2011, the TFF announced that the Süper Kupa game between Süper Lig champion Fenerbahçe and Türkiye Kupası winner Beşiktaş was postponed to an unknown date due to prosecution investigation.\nAs a consequence of the match-fixing allegations, UEFA demanded that Fenerbahçe withdraw from the 2011–12 Champions League. The club refused but, under pressure from UEFA, the TFF withdrew them from the competition, giving Fenerbahçe's place to second-placed Trabzonspor. On 5 September, Fenerbahçe have appointed the lawyers Emin Öztürk and Jean-Louis Dupont and opened a court case against UEFA and the TFF at the CAS over their exclusion from the Champions League.\nThe case is opened with a demand now for €45 million and reserving the right for more in connection with our material loss due to the said exclusion.\n\nThe following season, after this scandal Fenerbahçe on 12 September 2011 in the opening match of the Super Lig season, have a victory 1–0 against Orduspor. On 16 September 2011 Süper Lig second round Fenerbahçe was winning against Gaziantepspor with score 3–1. In July 2011, Fenerbahçe fans invaded the pitch during a friendly against the Ukrainian champions Shakhtar Donetsk. As punishment, Fenerbahçe was sentenced to two Süper Lig games in empty stadia. The TFF later allowed those two games to be filled with spectators; the men were barred while women and children under twelve got in for free. The team plans to have similar promotions during the rest of the season in order to increase attendance and reduce violence, and Fenerbahçe in this match draw against Manisaspor with score 1–1. On 14 December 2011, Kocaman downplays Emre Belözoğlu's bust-up with teammate, and denies punch claims. The veteran midfielder was rumoured to have attacked his boss during a spat with fellow player Cristian Baroni, but this has been rubbished by the Turkish club. Kocaman has admitted he was annoyed with Emre Belözoğlu's recent behaviour in a bust-up with a teammate, but denies that the midfielder threw a punch at him. The former Inter and Newcastle man was reported to have had a disagreement with fellow player Cristian Baroni after the Süper Lig side's 2–0 win over Bursaspor on Monday night. During the incident, the 31-year-old was believed to have tried to strike his boss, and has subsequently been suspended for the time being. However, Kocaman has since insisted that the punch claims are untrue. \"I was angry with Emre arguing in the changing room with Cristian, but there was no punch-up,\" the 46-year-old told Dogan News Agency. When quizzed on the incident, Emre seemed to think that it was a minor disagreement that has been blown out of proportion by the press. 'This is nothing too serious. I feel I don't need to comment on the issue,\" the Turkey international told Anadolu News Agency.\n\nOn 16 January 2012, Monday evening as a last-gasp goal on Monday gave Kocaman's Fenerbahçe, aka the Yellow Canaries, a hard-fought 2–1 away victory over Manisaspor in week 20 of the Süper Lig. The victory at 16561Manisa's 19 Mayıs Stadium not only reduced the gap between the Canaries and runaway leader Galatasaray to four points, it also kept the Canaries firmly in the playoff race for this season's championship.

The Canaries will also be striving for their 1.000th league victory, something they failed to realize after the debacle during the \"“mini”\" Istanbul derby against Istanbul BB at Atatürk Olympic Stadium on Wednesday. Despite the loss to Istanbul BB, Kocaman's Canaries are still favored to make the play-offs at the end of the regular season. Kocaman and his men do not seem perturbed at all because all the coaches are currently talking about the play-offs at the end of the regular season, not the league championship itself. One thing, however, is crystal clear: The Canaries should avoid dropping points from now on. On 18 February 2012, Kocaman's Fenerbahçe thus became the first football team in the land to garner 3.001 points in 1.759 matches in 54 seasons since the inception of the Süper Lig in 1959. It is also worth noting that the Fenerbahçe were the first team to record 1.000 league victories. Saturday's victory also meant the Fenerbahçe extending their unbeaten run at Kadıköy to 36 games. Never since Fenerbahçe was beaten 3–2 by Bursaspor in week 22 of the 2009–10 season on 22 February 2010, has the team tasted defeat again at home.

It is also noted that the decision regarding players whose contracts expire at the end of this season will be made after the season ends.\nOn 13 March 2012, Kocaman signed the 3-year contract in a signing ceremony held at Şükrü Saracoğlu Stadium with the club official Ali Yıldırım. Yıldırım congratulated Kocaman and wished him luck in the upcoming period. He added that Kocaman stood strong when the club was going through turbulent times in the face of match-fixing scandal. On 27 April 2012, Fenerbahçe has advanced to the final in the Turkish Cup after beating Karabükspor 2–0 in a semi-final game in Ankara on Thursday. Kocaman said at a post-game press conference that he is happy his team has clinched a place in the Turkish Cup, one of their targeted finals. The other final that Fenerbahçe is seeking is the championship play-offs of Süper Lig. There will be no actual final in the play-offs, but the team still lags behind Galatasaray by two points and is trying to gain an advantageous position to win the league title. Fenerbahçe last won the coveted Turkish Cup in 1983 and is yearning to end the waiting of its fans. On 12 May 2012, Fenerbahçe lose the Süper Lig title with a 0–0 draw at arch-rivals Galatasaray on Saturday after a season marred by an ongoing court investigation into match-fixing allegations against leading clubs. In a highly charged derby that Fenerbahçe needed to win to retain the championship, Galatasaray hung on against the more attack-minded home side as red cards reduced both sides to 10 men in the second half. On 16 May 2012, Fenerbahçe win Turkish Cup for first time in 29 years trounced Bursaspor 4–0 to win the Turkish Cup for the first time in 29 years on Wednesday, gaining some consolation for finishing runners-up in the league to Galatasaray.

On 27 August 2012, Fenerbahçe defeated southeastern side Gaziantepspor 3–0 in week two of the Süper Lig on Saturday night for its first domestic league of the season and also for its first win in four official matches. But Saturday's victory was eclipsed by the crisis between Brazilian captain and playmaker Alex and young coach Kocaman, which saw the Brazilian excluded completely from the Saturday roster. For the record: A fit Alex has always been included in the Fener starting XI since he joined the Istanbul club in 2004. Therefore, without the slightest doubt there is something wrong somewhere. The match was played \"behind closed doors,\" meaning adult men were banned, while women and children were allowed in for free. And even the female Fener spectators took sides, asking, \"Say Kocaman, where is Alex?\" And this prompted Fenerbahçe Chairman Aziz Yıldırım to grab the stadium microphone during the match maybe something unprecedented in football history and say the following: \"You are mistaken,\" he said to the chanting fans. \"Respect and support the players on the pitch. No one is greater than Fenerbahçe\", he asserted. Yıldırım further said after the match: \"I can give my life for Fenerbahçe. No one is above Fenerbahçe, not even Aziz Yıldırım.

Just like \"anime\", \"aenimeisyeon\" was shorten to \"aeni\". However, \"aeni\" usually refers to Japanese animation in colloquial usage, although it can refer to Korean animation or animation in general. To distinguish it from its Japanese counterpart, Korean animation is often called \"hanguk aeni\" (; lit. Korean animation) or \"guksan aeni\" (; lit. domestic animation).\n\nA Sino-Korean term \"manhwa yeonghwa\" (; Hanja: 漫畫映畫), a portmanteau of manhwa and the Korean term for movie, is also used as a general term for all animation.\n\nThe South Korean animation industry was in a period of crisis throughout the 2000s. Depression at the reality of being an industry that the West merely gave factory-type drawing to began to sink in. This followed the 1990s, a period of explosive growth for the industry when Korean studios made most of their profits from OEM, mostly from the United States.\n\nIn many ways, 2011 was a bright transitional year for Korean animation, with home-produced animated feature films finally finding box office success in South Korea, instead of facing the usual financial failure. As far as overseas export market is concerned, the likes of Rough Draft Korea (RDK) kept on landing new contracts, which have seen Rough Draft perform the manual work on over 45 popular Western cartoon titles over 16 years.\n\nSouth Korean animation has boomed in popularity in Eastern Asia with the success of the series \"Pororo the Little Penguin\" and \"Origami Warriors\" in 2011, leaving fans wanting to discover more Korean animations. This success is due in part to perfecting the Korean animation technique, and financial returns being reinvested into new animated products.\n\nSome Korean animators still blame the booming Korean game industry for draining the animation industry's talent pool, but the box office success of the Korean animated film \"Leafie\" in 2011 in South Korea is inspiring a new generation.\n\nAnimation contracts for Korean animation studios range from collaboration/minor contribution contracts, to most of the work. The South Korean animation industry can be considered dynamic as there are more than a hundred animation studios. While it is mostly firms in South Korea that contract with Western studios, some of the work is reported to be subcontracted to North Korea as well.\n\n\nIn 2010, according to the Korea Creative Content Agency, the Korean market share of domestic characters was about 28% and the remaining 72% was for foreign characters, such as those from Japan and USA. In 2012, experts predicted that the total market size would grow to 10 trillion won (about 9 billion dollars in July 2018) in the near future . In 2014, the domestic character market share soared to 40% and its value in 2013 had reached 8 trillion won (about 7 billion dollars).\n\nBefore the emergence of Korean domestic characters, characters that enjoyed popularity were mostly from the United States and Japan. However, as the industry matured and grew in size, domestic characters received preference not just domestically but also internationally.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1841126", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1841126", "title": "WINS (AM)", "text": "WINS (AM)\n\nWINS (1010 AM) – branded \"1010 WINS\" (the call sign phonetically pronounced \"wins\") – is a commercial all-news radio station licensed to serve New York City, New York. Owned by Entercom, the station services the New York metropolitan area, Long Island, and the tri-state area of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. The WINS studios and newsroom are located in the Hudson Square neighborhood of Manhattan, while the transmitter is located in Lyndhurst, New Jersey. In addition to a standard analog transmission, WINS transmits on HD Radio via the in-band on-channel standard, is simulcast on the third HD digital subchannel of WNEW-FM, and is available online via Radio.com. \n\nWINS is the oldest continuously operating all-news station in the United States, having adopted the format on April 19, 1965 under former owner Westinghouse Broadcasting, and is one of two all-news stations in the New York City metro owned by Entercom (WCBS (880 AM) being the other). The station's nighttime signal, via ionosphere skywave propagation, reaches much of the eastern half of North America and has been recorded as far as Germany and Colombia.\n\nThe station began broadcasting in 1924 on 950 kHz as WGBS, with studios located in Gimbels Department Store near Herald Square; the call sign was an initialism for Gimbel Brothers Store. WGBS moved to 860 kHz in 1927, to 1180 kHz in 1928, to 600 kHz in 1929, and back to 1180 kHz in 1931. The station was bought by William Randolph Hearst in 1932. That same year, effective January 15, it adopted its present call sign, named after Hearst's International News Service. No longer owned by Gimbels, WINS relocated to the Hotel Lincoln on 8th Avenue.\n\nOn June 19, 1932, it moved to the WINS Building, 114 East 58th Street.\n\nWINS changed its frequency from 1180 kHz to 1000 kHz on March 29, 1941 as part of the North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement (NARBA), and moved again to 1010 kHz in 1944. Cincinnati-based Crosley Broadcasting Corporation announced its purchase of the station from Hearst in 1945 for $1,700,000, though it would be over a year before Crosley would take control of WINS, in July 1946.\n\nSportscaster Mel Allen was an early disc jockey on the station, hosting an afternoon popular music program beginning in 1947. \n\nCrosley sold the station to J. Elroy McCaw's Gotham Broadcasting Corporation in 1953 for $450,000. Soon after, WINS became one of the first stations in the United States to play rock and roll music full time. In autumn of 1954, Alan Freed was hired as a disc jockey on WINS. In 1958, Murray \"the K\" Kaufman joined as the all-night DJ, naming his show the \"Swingin' Soiree\". Noted sports broadcaster Les Keiter served as sports director for a period in the 1950s. Keiter is perhaps best remembered for his recreations of San Francisco (formerly New York) Giants baseball games, which WINS carried in 1958 to keep disconnected Giants fans in touch with their team. The Giants had moved west along with the Brooklyn Dodgers the previous year.\n\nIn the late 1950s and early 1960s, as the transistor radio became popular, especially with young people who could carry radios with them everywhere, rock and roll solidified as a genre, thanks in large measure to what became known as Top 40 radio. In New York, four stations battled in the category: WMCA (570 AM), WMGM (1050 AM), WABC (770 AM), and WINS. While WMCA was only 5,000 watts, it was at the bottom end of the dial, which gave it better coverage than might be expected for its power; the other three were all 50,000 watts, but only WABC was both non-directional and a clear channel station. Of those three, WINS was the most directional (aimed straight at New York's inner boroughs), with a weaker signal than the others toward the New Jersey suburbs and the Jersey Shore. \n\nIn 1962, WMGM adopted a beautiful music format under its previous call letters, WHN, while WINS was purchased by the Westinghouse Electric Corporation. WMCA enjoyed some early success after WINS and WMGM left the Top 40 format, but WABC became the dominant Top 40 station in New York City by 1965. On April 18, 1965, around 8 p.m., WINS bowed out of Top 40 competition with the song \"Out in the Streets\", by The Shangri-Las.\n\nOn April 19, 1965, after weeks of speculation, WINS changed its format radically. It became the third radio station in the United States to attempt all-news programming, going with the new format around the clock. WINS immediately established a template for its format with an easily identifiable, distinctive Teletype sound effect playing in the background. Most other all-news stations later dropped this, but WINS continues to use it to this day despite Teletype machines themselves becoming obsolete by the mid-1980s. WINS used memorable slogans such as \"\"All news, all the time\"\"; \"\"The newswatch never stops\"\"; \"\"Listen two, three, four times a day\"\"; and \"\"You give us 22 minutes, we'll give you the world\"\"; the latter tagline was a reference to WINS's format clock, which returns to the top stories every twenty minutes.\n\nWINS's switch to all-news was initially viewed as a risky programming choice. Tijuana, Mexico-based border blaster XETRA (690 AM) had programmed an English-language all-news format for the Los Angeles radio market, as had Chicago station WNUS and, previously WAVA-AM-FM in the Washington, D.C. area. Locally, WABC-FM (now WPLJ) aired a news format for several weeks during the 1962–63 New York City newspaper strike. None of the other attempts was a success, and as a result many in the radio industry predicted a quick demise for WINS. However, Westinghouse Broadcasting supported the format and WINS eventually prospered with it. Westinghouse made similar format changes at two other stations: KYW in Philadelphia, in September 1965; and KFWB in Los Angeles, in March 1968. Together, WINS, KFWB and KYW served as prototype all-news stations, and all three succeeded in attracting both listeners and advertising revenue over the years.\n\nIn 1995, Westinghouse Electric purchased CBS, a move which put WINS under common ownership with WCBS. Despite initial speculation after the merger that either station would drop the all-news format, both stations remained in place and are among the most successful radio operations in the U.S. in terms of advertising sales. The two stations have their own areas of dominance; WINS's ratings numbers are better within New York City, while WCBS's listener strength is greater in the suburbs, owing primarily to its much stronger signal. From a programming standpoint, they have different styles (hard news, vs. lighter and conversational) to appeal to different listeners. Since the Westinghouse-CBS merger, both stations have continued to perform well in both ratings and advertising revenue.\n\nWINS's signal was also improved in 1995 after the company bought KLRA in Little Rock, Arkansas, which had also broadcast on the same frequency, and took it off the air. This relieved WINS of the need to \"null\" its signal in the direction of Little Rock. WINS' towers in Lyndhurst, New Jersey, which were shorter than optimum for its frequency, were replaced with four taller ones. While the signal is still directional to protect other stations, such as CFRB in Toronto (itself a Class A station), the signal no longer has to protect Little Rock.\n\nDespite having been owned by CBS, WINS maintained an affiliation with ABC News Radio throughout, as WCBS was and remains the CBS Radio News affiliate for New York. WINS added a secondary affiliation with Westwood One News on January 1, 2015 after Westwood One ended a distribution deal with ABC News; WINS does not clear newscasts from either service but does air vocal reports and sound bites.\n\nOn February 2, 2017, CBS Radio announced it would merge with Entercom, which fully separated WINS and WCBS radio (both AM 880 and FM 101.1) from WCBS-TV. The merger was approved on November 9, 2017, and was consummated on the 17th.\n\nCBS was the first broadcaster to make an attempt to mimic Westinghouse's all-news formula. Locally in New York, WINS' success as an all-news station spurred CBS to make a similar transformation with WCBS in August 1967. At first, WCBS did not go full-time with all-news, offering other programming during late nights, but joined WINS in broadcasting all-news around the clock by 1970. After completing the conversion of WCBS to all-news, five of CBS' other owned-and-operated AM stations also adopted the format; WCAU (1210 AM) in Philadelphia and KNX (1070 AM) in Los Angeles competed directly against KYW and KFWB, but with varying results.\n\nIn 1975, NBC Radio tried a national all-news approach with its \"News and Information Service\" (NIS) network, but it was shut down in 1977 after only two years in operation. In the mid-1970s, Westinghouse's second Chicago station, WIND (560 AM), carried the format part-time while competing against CBS-owned, all-news WBBM. WIND was not successful, and Westinghouse tried again after selling WIND in 1985 and acquiring WMAQ (670 AM) from NBC in 1988. Westinghouse converted WMAQ (now WSCR) into a full-time news outlet with mixed results.\n\nIn the summer of 2011, New York would gain a third all-news station, this one on the FM dial, in WEMP's \"FM News 101.9\". In the wake of meager ratings, the format abruptly flipped back to the alternative rock format that had been on the frequency three years prior. Later in 2012, Merlin Media, LLC sold the frequency to CBS Radio, which turned it into an FM simulcast of WFAN, making it a sister station to both WINS and WCBS.\n\nToday, the New York outlets co-exist with the format as Entercom-owned sister stations. , Entercom operates eight successful all-news stations around the U.S., including WINS, WCBS, WBBM, KNX, KYW, KCBS in San Francisco, WWJ in Detroit, and KRLD in Dallas. (WBZ in Boston had also been a CBS all-news outlet until CBS Radio's merger with Entercom in November 2017 forced WBZ to be spun off to iHeartMedia to meet FCC ownership limits and concerns from the Department of Justice.)\n\n\n"}

Its main purpose was to plan and apply a national energy policy which, through the exploitation of the domestic products and resources, would distribute cheap electric power to all Greek citizens. PPC started the integration of all the small local grids to the national interconnected grid. Furthermore, the corporation resolved the purchase of all the small private and local electric power production units.\n\nToday, PPC Group consists of 3 subsidiary companies PPC or DEI S.A., the Hellenic Electricity Distribution Network Operator (HEDNO or DEDDIE) S.A. and PPC RENEWABLES S.A..

The workers of PPC responded by limited power cuts to selected towns across Greece. However, this plan is now in jeopardy as the incoming Tsipras Government has decided to suspend the privatization of PPC as one of its first anti-austerity measures.\n\nIn 1982, PPC developed the first Wind Farm in the world, combined with a Photo-voltaic Station to supply electricity to the isolated power system of the island of Kythnos.\n\nThe PPC has committed to buying renewable-source energy from independent producers at five times its selling rate until 2034.\n\nLegislation before Parliament in 2013-14 included making the PPC responsible for collection of the real estate tax, part of the EU/IMF/ECB requirements for the financial support of the economy.\n\nThe 34 major thermal and hydroelectric power plants and the 3 wind farms of the interconnected power grid of the mainland, as well as the 60 autonomous power plants located on Crete, Rhodes and other Greek islands (33 thermal, 2 hydroelectric, 18 wind energy and 5 photovoltaic parks) form PPC's industrial assets and constitute the energy basis of all financial activities of the country.\n\nThe total installed capacity of the 97 PPC's power plants is currently 12,760 MW with a net generation of 53.9 TWh in 2007.\n\nPPC has mining areas adjacent to many of its power plants. Some of these power plants produce electricity and power from lignite, while other plants use coal. The largest mining areas are located between Kozani and Ptolemaida, around Amyntaio in the Florina prefecture and around Megalopolis.\n\n\n"}

Diefenbaker Building is a building in the New Edinburgh neighbourhood of Ottawa, Ontario. The building served as Ottawa's city hall from August 2, 1958 to January 1, 2001, and is commonly known as Old City Hall. Purchased in 2003 by the Government of Canada, it was known by its municipal address, 111 Sussex Drive, until September, 2011 when it was renamed after Canada's 13th prime minister, John Diefenbaker.\n\nThe building is located on Green Island at the point where the Rideau River empties into the Ottawa River. The historic city hall on Elgin Street had been destroyed by a fire in 1931. For the next 27 years the city operated out of temporary offices in the Transportation Building. The International Style building was opened on August 2, 1958 by Princess Margaret as a member of the Canadian Royal Family. It is noted for being the first building in Ottawa to be fully air conditioned. It was designed by John Bland of the firm Rother, Bland and Trudeau and is considered one of the most important International Style buildings in Canada, winning the Massey Medal for design in 1959. The original drawings for the building are held at the McGill University Library Special Collections as part of the John Bland Archive.\n\nIn 1988 Ottawa mayor Jim Durrell initiated a controversial scheme to expand the building, quadrupling its original size. Architect Moshe Safdie was chosen for the redesign, carried out in 1992-93. Conflict soon broke out between Safdie and the city. Safdie demanded a higher fee and delayed the project for several months before the city acquiesced to his demand. Then a conflict broke out over a pair of eighteen story observation towers. City council voted to cut the towers to save the million dollars they cost. This infuriated Safdie who felt the towers were essential to the design. The panel that picked the design had singled out the tower as one of the highlights of the design. Eventually the city compromised and a bare scaffold was erected.\n\nThe new building caused considerable controversy in the city with some liking the design, but others seeing the $72 million structure a waste of money. The building was much larger than the city needed and for several years large sections were vacant. In 1999 offices were rented out to Global Affairs Canada, which is based nearby, and this mostly filled the building.\n\nOn January 1, 2001, Ottawa was amalgamated with Cumberland, Gloucester, Goulbourn, Kanata, Nepean, Osgoode, Rideau, Rockcliffe Park, Vanier and West Carleton. It was decided that the new city would be based at 110 Laurier Avenue West. This building was considerably smaller but more centrally located. In 2003 the Old City Hall was sold to the federal Public Works department. Today the building mainly houses Global Affairs employees. For several months it was also the site of the Gomery Inquiry hearings.\n\n"}

It can be small and manually operated and hold one simple die set, or be very large, CNC operated, with a multi-station turret and hold a much larger and complex die set.\n\nPunch presses are large machines with either a 'C' type frame, or a 'portal' (bridge) type frame. The \"C\" type has the hydraulic ram at the top foremost part, whereas the portal frame is much akin to a complete circle with the ram being centered within the frame to stop frame deflection or distortion.\n\nC type presses have a bed plate which is used to lock the die bottom bolster. For locking the die, T-bolts are used and so this plate contains T-slots into which T-bolts are slid in. These slots are placed diagonally and with a slot horizontal to the longer side of the plate, is the general practice. These slots run up to a central hole made in the plate, the hole being large enough to accommodate another bush with a hole, the hole being used for dropping the punched part to the bottom of the press. The top of the tool butted against a vertical sliding ram with a clamping system which accommodates only a particular diameter of a threaded cylindrical member called the \"shank\" of the tool. The bottom portion of the tool is locked to the bottom bed plate and the top portion of the tool is locked to the sliding ram. Top and bottom portions of the tool are generally guided by suitable pillar and bush assemblies, which gives safety to the punching elements of the tool.\n\nGenerally the tool is placed slightly above the bottom bed plate by providing two parallel blocks accurately ground to the same size. This is a necessary action since many tools, scrap (cut pieces which are a waste) is discharged through the bottom element of the tool, not necessarily in the centre of the tool. The scrap or the blank (the required portion) come out from the die at different places. These have to be taken out horizontally from between the parallels placed. Otherwise they get accumulated inside the tool itself and cause severe damage to the tool.\n\nIn very heavy presses with higher tonnage, the sliding ram has also a thick plate with T slots for locking the top plate of the tool (called the top bolster). In such cases the threaded cylinder called shank is not attached to the tool. The clamps are either mechanical (manually operated using spanners) or air operated varieties.\n\nTurret type punch press machines have a table or bed with brushes or rollers to allow the sheet metal workpiece to traverse with low friction. Brushes are used where scratches on the workpiece must be minimized, as with brushed aluminium or high polished materials.\n\nThe punch press is characterized by parameters such as:\n\n\nPunch presses are usually referred to by their tonnage and table size. In a production environment a 30-ton press is mostly the machine used today. The tonnage needed to cut and form the material is well known, so sizing tooling for a specific job is a fairly straightforward task. According to the requirement the tonnage may even go up to 2000 to 2500 ton presses.\n\nA die set consists of a set of punches (male) and dies (female) which, when pressed together, form a hole in a workpiece (and may also deform the workpiece in some desired manner). The punches and dies are removable, with the punch being attached to the ram during the punching process. The ram moves up and down in a vertically linear motion, forcing the punch through the material into the die.\n\nThe main bed of most machines is called the 'X' axis, with the 'Y' axis being at right angles to that and allowed to traverse under CNC control. Dependent on the size of the machine, the beds, and the sheet metal workpiece weight, the motors required to move these axis tables will vary in size and power. Older styles of machines used DC motors; however, with advances in technology, today's machines mostly use AC brushless motors for drives.\n\nTo start a cycle, the CNC controller commands the drives to move the table along the X and the Y axis to a desired position. Once in position, the control initiates the punching sequence and pushes the ram from top dead center (TDC) to bottom dead center (BDC) through the material plane. (The terms BDC and TDC go back to older presses with pneumatic or hydraulic clutches. On today's machines BDC/TDC do not actually exist but are still used for the bottom and top of a stroke.)\n\nOn its stroke from TDC to BDC, the punch enters the material, pushing it through the die, obtaining the shape determined by the design of the punch and die set. The piece of material (slug) cut from the workpiece is ejected through the die and bolster plate and collected in a scrap container. The return to TDC signals to the control to begin the next cycle.\n\nThe punch press is used for high volume production. Cycle times are often measured in milliseconds. Material yield is measured as a percentage of parts to waste per sheet processed. CAD/CAM programs maximize yield by nesting parts in the layout of the sheet.\n\nMost punch presses today are hydraulically powered. Older machines, however, have mechanically driven rams, meaning the power to the ram is provided by a heavy, constantly rotating flywheel. The flywheel drives the ram using a Pitman arm. In the 19th century, the flywheels were powered by leather drive belts attached to line shafting, which in turn ran to a steam plant. In the modern workplace, the flywheel is powered by an electric motor.\n\nMechanical punch presses fall into two distinct types, depending on the type of clutch or braking system with which they are equipped. Generally, older presses are \"full revolution\" presses that require a full revolution of the crankshaft for them to come to a stop. Full revolution clutch presses are known to be dangerous and outlawed in many countries unless the pinch point is fully guarded. This is because the braking mechanism depends on a set of raised keys or \"dogs\" to fall into matching slots to stop the ram. A full revolution clutch can only bring the ram to a stop at the same location - top dead center. Newer presses are often \"part revolution\" presses equipped with braking systems identical to the brakes on commercial trucks. When air is applied, a band-type brake expands and allows the crankshaft to revolve. When the stopping mechanism is applied the air is bled, causing the clutch to open and the braking system to close, stopping the ram in any part of its rotation. Modern part revolution clutch and brake units are normally combined units that operate in a fail safe mode, a dual air safety valve engages clutch and starts slide motion and brake is applied by springs.\n\nHydraulic punch presses power the ram with a hydraulic cylinder rather than a flywheel, and are either valve controlled or valve and feedback controlled. Valve controlled machines usually allow a one stroke operation allowing the ram to stroke up and down when commanded. Controlled feedback systems allow the ram to be proportionally controlled to within fixed points as commanded. \nThis allows greater control over the stroke of the ram, and increases punching rates as the ram no longer has to complete the traditional full stroke up and down but can operate within a very short window of stroke.\n\nA servo drive turret punch press uses twin AC servo drives directly coupled to the drive shaft. This drive system combines the simplicity of the original clutch and brake technology with the speed of a hydraulic ram driven system. This results in high performance, reliability, and lower operating costs. A servo drive press system has no complex hydraulics or oil-cooling chillers, thus reducing maintenance and repair costs. A turret press can be equipped with advanced technology that stores and reuses energy generated during ram deceleration, providing extended electrical power savings.\n\n"}

Although he was an accomplished solo pianist and composer, Levin received international acclaim for his work as an accompanist with several of the world's most celebrated vocal and instrumental performers.\nLevin was born in Kristiania (now Oslo), Norway. He grew up in the immigrant neighborhood in Grünerløkka, the child of David Levin (1882–1936) and Marie Scheer (1885–1954). Both were Jewish refugees from Lithuania who had immigrated in 1905. Levin's father supported his family through various means, including peddling sewing notions and carting coal.\n\nLevin caught interest in the piano when he was four and a half years old, at his grandmother's home. By the time he was five, he had taught himself well enough for his first public performance. He did not receive formal lessons until he was ten, and when he was twelve he was accepted by the pre-eminent music teacher of the time, Nils Larsen. Levin did his part to support the family by performing at restaurants, bars, and movie theaters during the silent film era. He only finished the first six years of public schooling. He learned at the synagogue for his bar mitzvah, but was mostly occupied with his music. He was also an avid reader of diverse literature.\n\nLike many of the classical musicians of pre-World War II era, Levin played at restaurants to support himself. He rose through the unofficial ranks as a teenager, overcoming strong antisemitic barriers. He took private lessons with concertmaster Gustav Fredrik Lange (1861–1939) and notably composer Fartein Valen (1887–1952), being exposed to a wide range of musical traditions and innovations. Levin was the last living silent movie veteran when he died in 1996. He also became an accomplished accordion player during this time. Levin had his performance debut on 26 January 1932 to widespread acclaim. Levin was introduced to several strains of modern music when he was engaged in the orchestra at Theatercafeen, where the Norwegian exponent of neo-Classical music Carl Gustav Sparre Olsen (1903–1984) performed. The orchestra also introduced Levin to jazz music.\n\nAfter Norway was occupied by Nazi Germany in 1940, Levin continued to perform but was subjected to daily threats and restrictions on the venues and music he could play. When Nazi authorities in occupied Norway started arresting and deporting Jews, Levin went under cover with friends and eventually fled to Sweden. The rest of his family arrived in Sweden a few days later, but many of Levin's closest relatives were deported from Norway and were victims of the Holocaust in Auschwitz.\n\nLevin became a proponent of Norwegian music and culture while in exile in Sweden. He wrote the music to several patriotic Norwegian songs, including \"Kirkenesmarsjen\", a march to commemorate the liberation of the Northern Norwegian town of Kirkenes by Soviet troops on 25 October 1944. Sponsored by the Norwegian government-in-exile and Svenska Norgeshjälpen, Levin performed for members of the Norwegian Resistance Movement in Sweden along with his wife Solveig, Randi Heide Steen, Ernst Glaser, Gunnar Sønstevold, Hugo Kramm, Gunnar Reiss Andersen, Axel Kielland, Lauritz Falk, Sonja Mjøen, and others. Levin also sent packages to musical colleagues in Oslo under the pseudonym \"Banjo-Lasse\".\n\nAfter the Liberation of Norway the Levin family returned to one of the central train stations in Oslo in June 1945. The orchestra which Robert Levin had to leave nearly three years earlier awaited him at the platform, performing at their arrival.\n\nAfter the war, Levin decided to concentrate more on a classical career, and after he accompanied Gösta Kjellertz, his career as an accompanist took off. He accompanied such diverse international artists as Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, Yehudi Menuhin, Roberta Peters, Rita Streich, Henryk Szeryng, Ann Brown, Kim Borg, Camilla Wicks, Felicia Weathers; and a panorama of Norwegian artists that included Ingrid Bjoner, Knut Skram, Arve Tellefsen, Terje Tønnesen, Elise Båtnes, Aase Nordmo Løvberg, Edith Thallaug, and Ole Bøhn.\n\nNotably, on 22 May 1984, he and American pianist Robert D. Levin, performed together in Carnegie Hall in a concert called \"From Grieg to Gershwin\" with then Crown Prince Harald and Crown Princess Sonja in attendance. The two, along with other musicians including Ole Bøhn, Knut Skram, Felicia Weathers, and Ingrid Bjoner performed pieces by Edvard Grieg, Richard Hageman, Harry Owens, Aaron Copland, Celius Dougherty, Oley Speaks, George Gershwin.\n\nLevin took part in performing tours all around the world. He became one of the most respected classical musicians of his time in Norway. He took an active part in music education at all ages, led the Norwegian Society of Composers and Lyricists (NOPA), and promoted the art of accompaniment. He was the first rector of the Norwegian Academy of Music when it was founded in 1973, where he was also a professor of interpretation. When the academy moved to its new facilities in Majorstuen in 1989, one of the performance halls was named after Levin.\n\nLevin received the Houens legat (1951) and Statens kunstnerstip (1954). Levin was awarded the Norwegian Music Critics Award (\"Musikkritikerprisen\") (1956/57), Lindemanprisen (1983) and Spellemannprisen (1977). He was also awarded the King's Medal of Merit (\"Kongens fortjenstmedalje\") in gold and was made a member of the Order of St Olaf. In 1993, he was awarded the Anders Jahre Cultural Prize (\"Anders Jahres kulturpris\") jointly with Stein Mehren.\n\nIn 1938, he married Solveig Margrethe Bernstein (born 1914). They were the parents of journalist, Mona Levin (born 1939). Their daughter, Sidsel Levin (born 1944) was music teacher and cultural facilitator at the Jewish Museum in Oslo. Levin died during 1996 at the age of 84 and was buried at Østre gravlund in Oslo.\n\n\n"}

They were commonly compared to Tomy's Bit Char-G (sold in the U.S. as MicroSizers) and Takara's Digi-Q micro R/C lines.\n\nFirst introduced in September 2002, ZipZaps were an instant success and one of the most popular gifts of the holiday season in North America, with RadioShack stores often selling out of the starter kits. They were referred to as \"micro R/C\" due to their diminutive size. At around , ZipZaps were only slightly larger than popular die-cast toy cars such as Hot Wheels and Matchbox.ZipZaps were unique among toy-style micro R/C vehicles in that they could be customized much like large R/C models. Each partially assembled ZipZaps kit included a pre-assembled chassis with built-in nickel metal hydride rechargeable batteries on which the gears, tires and hubcaps could be changed for better appearance and performance. Five motors and three gear ratios were offered, ranging from the 16,000 rpm stock unit to the high-speed 34,000 rpm \"NX\" (named after a popular brand of nitrous oxide). Gear ratios were 12:1 \"stock\", 9.86:1 \"performance\" and 8.25:1 \"turbo\". Tracking was adjusted via a wheel alignment lever underneath the vehicles themselves. The vehicle's on-board battery was charged by snapping the entire car onto the top of the transmitter. Full charge was accomplished in about 40 to 60 seconds with run times averaging five minutes. Neither steering nor throttle was proportional, with both functions either full on or full off. The SE series added semi-proportional, two-speed throttle and fully proportional rack-and-pinion steering with steering trim adjustable at the transmitter, as with a full-sized R/C.\n\nFurther customizing options came from the variety of body shells which snapped on over the top of the chassis, allowing the car to take on the appearance of any number of popular cars including the Chevrolet Corvette, Toyota AE86, Audi TT, Ford GT, Ford Mustang, Hummer H1 and Mercedes-Benz SL. \"Past and present\" two-packs of body shells were sold as well, depicting early and late versions of sports cars and muscle cars. In addition to selling the Initial D manga, RadioShack also sold bodies for the SE chassis of the AE86 Trueno and the AE85 Levin from the series in a two-pack (which also included a few performance gears and motors) for the holiday season in 2002. Motion picture vehicles were represented by the Ford Gran Torino from \"Starsky & Hutch\" and the tuned imports from \"2 Fast 2 Furious\". RadioShack marketed a replica of Herbie that tied in with the Walt Disney Studios 2005 release of \"\". In 2007, Radioshack released a set of ZipZaps for the live-action \"Transformers\" film, featuring Optimus Prime (the only model to feature a six-wheel chassis), Barricade, and Bumblebee. A series of monster trucks based on a larger chassis and with larger tires and motors and four wheel drive were available as well.\n\nThe original ZipZaps operated on one of two frequencies: namely 27 MHz and 49 MHz, so no more than two people can reliably race simultaneously. The SE series and monster trucks featured selectable frequencies within the 27 MHz band for up to six racers along with working headlights and taillights. The SE series had proportional control and used a pistol grip style remote control. Motors, tires and wheel covers (called \"hubs\") were interchangeable between regular ZipZaps and the SE series. The bodies were also interchangeable, but the lights on SE bodies obviously did not work on the regular chassis. Accessories such as lap counters, autocross pylons and carrying cases were available as well.\n\nThe popularity of ZipZaps waned somewhat in 2004 with RadioShack's introduction of XMODS. Like ZipZaps, XMODS offered customization options in both appearance and performance potential, but were considerably larger at 1:28 scale.\n\nOn October 2008, RadioShack relaunched the ZipZaps line – this time, as XMODS Micro RC. Only the name was changed; all parts were backwards and forwards-compatible between ZipZaps (except the light features of the SE line) and XMODS Micro RC lines, and used the same chassis and controller of the regular ZipZaps line (as opposed to the more advanced features of the SE line).\n\n"}

{"id": "1841199", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1841199", "title": "Pentecost Island", "text": "Pentecost Island\n\nPentecost Island is one of the 83 islands that make up the South Pacific nation of Vanuatu.\n\nIt lies due north of capital Port Vila. Pentecost Island is known as in French and in Bislama. The island was known in its native languages by names such as \"Vanu Aroaroa\", although these names are not in common use today. Pentecost has also been referred to as \"Raga\" or \"Araga\", a tribal name that originated in the north but is now widely applied to the whole island. In old sources it is occasionally referred to as Whitsuntide Island.\n\nPentecost is a lush, mountainous island which stretches north to south over some . It has an area of . The mountain range, of which the highest is Mount Vulmat (), marks the dividing line between the humid, rainy eastern coast and the more temperate western coast. The coastal plains, cross-cut by small torrents, are generally very green and ideally suited for plantations and livestock.\n\nThe climate on Pentecost is humid tropical. The average annual rainfall is about 3,500 mm of rain. There are two seasons in the year: the rainy season, which lasts from November to April, and the dry season, which lasts from May to October. The island is subject to frequent cyclones and earthquakes.\n\nIt was first sighted by the Spanish expedition of Pedro Fernandez de Quiros in April 1606. Pentecost was again sighted on the day of Pentecost, 22 May 1768, by Louis Antoine de Bougainville. It was also sighted by Captain James Cook, during his voyage through the New Hebrides (now Vanuatu) in 1774. It was influenced by successive Christian missionaries but traditional customs there remain strong.\n\nPentecost Island is most famous for being the spiritual birthplace of the extreme sport of bungee jumping, originating in an ages old ritual called the \"Gol\" (Bislama ), or land diving. Between April and June every year, men in the southern part of the island jump from tall towers (around ) with vines tied to their feet, in a ritual believed to ensure a good yam harvest. The ritual is also now used to show acceptance into manhood. Land diving was first given international exposure when David Attenborough and a BBC film crew brought back footage of the ritual during the 1950s, which aired as part of \"The People of Paradise\" documentary series. Visitors to Pentecost who witnessed the ceremony include Pope John Paul II (1986) and Queen Elizabeth II (1974).\n\nThe north Pentecost village of Laone was the home of Walter Lini, who led Vanuatu to independence in 1980. Today, the 'father of the nation' is commemorated by a statue at the nearby Lini Memorial College.\n\nThe Turaga indigenous movement, which rejects the Western economic system and instead promotes an alternative based on the \"\"kastom\" economy\", began on Pentecost and is based at Lavatmanggemu in the north-east of the island.\n\nThe practice of grade-taking (the elevation of social status through the slaughter of valuable pigs) has been studied by anthropologists.\n\nThe island has a population of almost 17,000 at the 2009 census. Pentecost's population centres are concentrated along the west coast, although a number of people also live inland. Major settlements along the west coast include (from north to south): Laone, Abwatuntora, Loltong, Latano, Nambwarangiut, Namaram, Bwatnapni, Melsisi, Ranwadi, Waterfall (Vanuu), Baravet, Lonoror, Hotwata, Panas, Wali, Panngi and Ranputor. Away from the coast, there are major settlements at Nazareth and Atavtabangga in the north, and at Enaa, Wutsunmwel, Tanbok, Naruwa, Ubiku and Tansip in the centre of the island. Most of these places have village telephones and one or two inhabitants who own 'trucks' (four-wheel-drive vehicles) or 'speedboats' (small motorboats), which the villagers use for transport. A couple of these villages also have small banks and post offices.\n\nThe east coast is wild and inaccessible, with large uninhabited areas, although people are moving into previously uninhabited areas as the island's population increases. Major villages on the eastern side of the island include Ranwas, Bunlap and Baie Barrier (Ranon) in the south-east, and Renbura and Vanrasini further north.\n\nThere are no real towns on Pentecost. Most islanders live in small rural villages, surviving by subsistence agriculture and growing cash crops. Taro, a root vegetable well-suited to Pentecost's wet climate, is the staple food. Manioc (cassava), yams, bananas, kumala (sweet potato), coconuts, island cabbage, pawpaw (papaya), nakavika (rose apples), citrus, sugar cane, cacao, mangoes, pineapples, nuts, and European vegetables are also grown for local consumption.\n\nVegetables are often grated into a paste, wrapped in large leaves, baked in an earthen oven and covered with coconut cream to create 'laplap', a savoury pudding.\n\nPigs are highly important in Pentecost society, not only as food but as a traditional item of value, which may be given as payment during marriage ceremonies or as compensation for transgressions. Boars with long, curved tusks are particularly prized. Woven, red-dyed mats are also used as a traditional form of currency. \n\nTraditionally, copra (dried coconut meat) was Pentecost's main export, but this has now been overtaken by kava, a narcotic root used to prepare a traditional drink. Kava is grown and drunk on many islands in the South Pacific, but Pentecost is particularly well known for it, and much of the kava drunk in Vanuatu's towns and abroad originates on Pentecost. \n\nCattle were once exported from Pentecost to the meat-processing factory at Luganville on neighbouring Santo island. However, most are now slaughtered locally instead, to feed Pentecost's growing population. \n\nHouses are traditionally constructed from local wood and bamboo, and thatched with leaves of \"natanggura\" (a variety of palm). However, wealthier islanders now build their houses instead using imported cement and corrugated metal.\n\nPentecost Island has two airports, Lonorore Airport in the south-west and Sara Airport in the north, at which small airplanes land two or three times a week. Lonorore was upgraded in 2008–2009 with a new tarmacked airstrip capable of handling larger aircraft and operating in wet conditions; Sara remains a short grass airstrip.\n\nCargo ships travelling between Port Vila and Luganville supply the island's west coast, although few ships visit the east coast, where sea conditions are rough and the population is sparse.\n\nA rutted dirt road runs from the north to the southwest of the island, and another road connects Salap in the southwest to Ranwas in the southeast. However, many villages are accessible only by steep mountain footpaths.\n\nPentecost Island receives regular visits from yachties, who anchor at the villages of Loltong, Waterfall and Panngi. Panngi also has a jetty capable of receiving cruise ships, which make occasional visits during the land-diving season.\n\nPentecost Island has five indigenous languages, all from the East Vanuatu language family: Raga (North Pentecost language), Apma (Central Pentecost language), Sowa (a recently extinct language of south-central Pentecost), Ske (a small and endangered language of south-western Pentecost), and Sa (South Pentecost language). Apma and Sa have multiple dialects.\n\nIn addition, most people on Pentecost speak Bislama, the form of pidgin English that is Vanuatu's national language, and the island's native languages are becoming increasingly mixed with Bislama words and expressions. Educated islanders also know English or French, which are taught in schools.\n\n\n"}

It is \"a classic story of life in a big, happy family.\" set in a small Sussex town in the south east of England. It was regarded as innovative and groundbreaking for its portrayal of a working-class family at a time when children's books were dominated by stories about middle-class children.\n\nIn 1938, Garnett won the second annual Carnegie Medal awarded by the Library Association for The Family from One End Street, recognising the best children's book by a British subject for the previous year. On the 70th anniversary of the Medal it was named one of the top ten winning works of the previous seventy years, selected by a panel from a public ballot to propose the all-time favourite.\n\nIt is regarded as a classic, and remains in print, most recently reissued as a Puffin Classic in 2014.\n\nThere were two sequels, \"Further Adventures of the Family from One End Street\" published in 1956 and \"Holiday at the Dew Drop Inn\" published in 1962 and subtitled \"A One End Street story\" in the United States.\n\nCollectively, the three novels are referred to as the \"One End Street\" series.\n\nThe Ruggles family lives at No. 1 One End Street in the heart of Otwell, located on the Ouse river. Otwell-on-the-Ouse is a fictional town resembling Lewes, Sussex, where the author lived.\n\nJosiah Ruggles works for Otwell council as a dustman and his wife Rosie takes in washing. They have seven children, so life is hard, but they are a happy family.\n\nCILIP, successor to the Library Association, assigns the subject tags \"family large roisterous\" and \"family working class\" in its online presentation of the Carnegie Medal winning books.\n\nThe story begins with Lily Rose, the eldest child, trying to help her mother Rosie with the ironing and ruining a green petticoat. She apologises to its owner, Mrs Beaseley, who forgives her. Mrs Beaseley also gives Kate (the second eldest child) her niece's cast off clothes for her new school, as the government funds to help with this are paid in arrears. Kate loses the school hat, and tries to sell mushrooms to pay for a new one, but the original is eventually found.\n\nJim, the older and more ambitious of the Ruggles twins, meets and joins the local gang, the Black Hands, led by a twelve-year-old named Henry Oates. Though they consider him too young to join and accuse him of spying, Jim begs to be accepted.\n\nThe next Saturday, as a hailstorm begins, Jim follows a dog into a drain pipe around a wharf's barge-loading area for shelter. Once the pipe is loaded on the barge Jim climbs aboard, hides in the pipe and is carried down the river to the seaport Salthaven. He is still in the pipe when it is loaded directly from the barge into a waiting ship. A man on the ship angrily returns him to the land, and the surrounding dock workers help him to get home.\n\nJohn, the younger twin, is a car fan and regularly visits Otwell Castle's car park. A wealthy couple called the Lawrences arrive at the castle, and allow him to \"mind\" their car. The same hailstorm which sends Jim into the pipe on the wharf for shelter catches John, and he climbs into the car for shelter. When the Lawrences return, they drive away without checking the back seat, and John does not awaken until they have driven some miles. Instead of turning around and taking him home, they invite him to their son's birthday party, and send a telegram to John's family to let them know that he is safe.\n\nWilliam, the youngest Ruggles child, is entered in the Annual Baby Show, but the family is concerned as he is a late teether. He wins his age category (6–12 months) but an older competitor wins the Grand Challenge Cup as William has no teeth. The Ruggles return home only to find that William now has a tooth.\n\nJo Ruggles junior, the fifth child, a Mickey Mouse fan, enjoys watching cartoons at the cinema. On Saturday morning he sneaks inside the empty building and hides in the orchestra pit to see the first colour Mickey Mouse film, where he soon falls asleep; several hours later, several cinema musicians find him. Jo explains why he sneaked in, and the men give him sixpence for the show, and a warning not to do it again.\n\nMr Ruggles receives a reward of £2 for returning some lost money, which he uses to take his family to the Cart Horse Parade in London's Regent's Park, where Mr Ruggles' brother has entered his horse in the competition. The horse, Bernard Shaw, takes first place, and the families climb into the cart to participate in the parade. The Ruggles spend the afternoon at a \"posh\" tea shop, nearly missing their train home in the excitement.\n\nEve Garnett herself wrote that \"The Family From One End Street\" was rejected as unsuitable by at least eight other publishers before being taken by Muller.\n\nThe US Library of Congress gives a longer title, \"The Family from One End street and some of their adventures\", for its oldest holding, a 1939 UK edition.\n\nRecent British editions have been published by Puffin. \"The Family\" first appeared as a Puffin Book in 1942, under the editorship of Eleanor Graham, only a year after Penguin Books introduced the imprint.\n\n\n —immediately, first US edition \n"}

The laws pertaining to the acquisition of firearms in Switzerland are amongst the most liberal in the world. A reason is not required to own a gun unless the reason is \"other than\" sport-shooting, hunting, or collecting. Permits for concealed carrying in public are issued sparingly. The acquisition of fully automatic weapons, suppressors and target lasers requires special permits issued by the cantonal firearms office. Use of hollow-point and soft-point ammunition is limited to hunting.\n\nThe applicable federal legislations are \"SR 514.54 Federal Law on Weapons, Weapon Equipment and Ammunition\" (, , ) of 20 June 1997 (current edition of 15. August 2019, revised 15.08.2019), and \"SR 514.541 Ordinance on Weapons, Armament Accessories and Ammunition\" (, , ) of 2 July 2008 (current edition of 15. August 2019, revised 15.08.2019). The Weapons Law recognises a qualified \"right to acquire, possess and carry arms\".\n\nSwiss gun culture has emerged from a long tradition of shooting (\"tirs\"), which served as a formative element of national identity in the post-Napoleonic Restoration of the Confederacy, and the long-standing practice of a militia organization of the Swiss Army in which soldiers' service rifles are stored privately at their homes. In addition to this, many cantons (notably the alpine cantons of Grisons and Valais) have strong traditions of hunting, accounting for a large but unknown number of privately held hunting rifles, as only weapons acquired since 2008 are registered. However, in a 2019 referendum voters opted to conform with European Union regulations which restrict the acquisition of semi-automatic firearms with high-capacity magazines. A permit for semi-automatic firearms equipped \"with\" high-capacity magazines is issued to members of a shooting club, a citizen who shoots at least once a year which needs to be proven after five and ten years, or a weapons collector. The law pertaining to the acquisition of a high-capacity magazine by itself did not change.\n\nSwitzerland thus has a relatively high gun ownership rate. There are no official statistics, and estimates vary considerably.\n\nThe 2017 report from Small Arms Survey has estimated that the number of civilian-held firearms in Switzerland is of 2.332 million, which given a population of 8.4 million corresponds to a gun ownership of around 27.6 guns per 100 residents. Other estimates place the number of privately held firearms upwards to 3.400 million, giving the nation an estimate of 41.2 guns per 100 people. The International Crime Victims Survey conducted in 2004-05 reported that approximately 28% of all households in Switzerland owned guns, giving Switzerland the second-highest percentage of firearm ownership in Europe.\n\nWhen Switzerland joined the Schengen Information System in 2008, it was forced to introduce a central registry for firearms. \nOnly firearms which changed hands since 2008 are registered. The number of registered firearms in this database was reported as 876,000 as of August 2017 which given a population of 8.4 million corresponds to around 10.3 registered guns per 100 residents.\n\nSwitzerland's Weapons Law (WG, LArm) and Weapons Act (WV, OArm) has been revised to accede to the Schengen Treaty effective 12 December 2008. The Act on Personal Military Equipment (VPAA, OEPM) governs the handling of military equipment, and in particular the handling of personal weapons by military personnel.\n\nThe law is applied to the following weapons:\nGenerally prohibited weapons are:\n\nIn order to purchase most weapons, the purchaser must obtain a weapon acquisition permit (art. 8 WG/LArm). Swiss citizens and foreigners with a C permit over the age of 18 who are not under a curator nor identified as being a danger for themselves or others, and who don't have a criminal record with a conviction for a violent crime or of several convictions as long as they haven't been written out can request such a permit. Foreign nationals who do not have a settlement permit but who are resident in Switzerland must present the competent cantonal authority with an official attestation from their home country confirming they are authorised to acquire the weapon or essential weapon component in that country in order to buy (art. 9a WG/LArm). Foreigners with citizenship to the following countries are explicitly excluded from the right to buy, sell and own weapons and their parts: Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, North Macedonia, Turkey, Sri Lanka, Algeria and Albania.\nThe following information must be provided to the cantonal weapon bureau together with the weapon application form:\n\nFor each transfer of a weapon or an essential weapon component without weapons acquisition permit (art. 10 WG/LArm), a written contract must be concluded. Each Party shall keep them at least ten years. The contract must include the following information (art. 11 WG/LArm):\n\nThis information must be sent within 30 days to the cantonal weapon registration bureau, where the weapon holders are registered, though CO2 and airsoft guns are not concerned by this (art. 11 WGLArm)\n\nThe following weapons can be acquired without acquisition permits (art. 10 WG/LArm):\n\nThe following weapons can be acquired with a shall-issue acquisition permit (art. 8 WG/LArm):\n\nThe following weapons can only be acquired with a may-issue acquisition permit that can be issued for professional requirements, in particular with regard to carrying out protection duties, such as protecting persons, critical infrastructure or the transport of valuables; target shooting by shooting clubs; collecting; National defense requirements; Educational, cultural, research or historical purposes (art. 28c WG/LArm):\n\nThe following weapons from the generally prohibited category can be bought with a shall-issue exceptional permit for sport shooter; proof of regular use or membership of a club needs to be provided after 5 and 10 years. This verification is to be done only for the first weapon purchased with that kind of permit (art. 28d WG/LArm & art. 13c WV/OArm):\n\nThe following weapons from the generally prohibited category can be bought with a may-issue exceptional permit for collectors with proof that they are kept in a safe place and protected from access by unauthorised third persons (art. 28e WG/LArm):\n\nThe following weapons can be bought with a regular may-issue exceptional acquisition permit for the following reasons (art. 28b WG/LArm):\n\nIn order to purchase ammunition, the buyer must fulfill the same legal rules that apply when buying guns<ref name=\"art. 8 al. 2 WG/LArm\" group=note>buyer must be over the age of 18, not under a curator nor identified as being a danger for themselves or others, and don't have a criminal record with a conviction for a violent crime or of several convictions as long as they haven't been written out.</ref> (art. 15 WG/LArm). Foreigners with citizenship to the following countries are explicitly excluded from the right to buy and own ammunition: Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, North Macedonia, Turkey, Sri Lanka, Algeria and Albania.\n\nThe buyer must provide the following information to the seller (art. 15, 16 WG/LArm; art. 24 WV/OArm):\nThe possession of the following ammunition is generally prohibited:\n\nTo carry a firearm in public or outdoors (and for a militia member to carry a firearm other than his issued weapons while off-duty), a person must have a gun carrying permit (, , ; art. 27 WG/LArm), which in most cases is issued only to private citizens working in occupations such as security. It is, however, quite common to see a person in military service to be \"en route\" with his rifle, albeit unloaded. The issue of such exceptional permits are extremely selective (see #Conditions_for_obtaining_a_Carrying_Permit).\n\nHowever, it is permissible to carry firearms in public or outdoors if the holder (art. 27 § 4 WG/LArm):\n\nFurthermore, any licensed holder of a gun may \"transport\" an unloaded firearm for special situations (see #Transporting guns).\n\nThere are three conditions (art. 27 § 2 WG/LArm):\n\nThe carrying permit remains valid for a term of five years (unless otherwise surrendered or revoked), and applies only to the type of firearm for which the permit was issued. Additional constraints may be invoked to modify any specific permit. (art. 27 § 3 WG/LArm).\n\nGuns may be transported in public as long as an appropriate justification is present. This means to transport a gun in public, the following requirements apply (art. 28 WG/LArm):\n\nA 2017 amendment to the European Firearms Directive, known as the \"EU Gun Ban\", introduces new restrictions on firearms possession and acquisition, especially on semi-automatic firearms, personal defense weapons, magazine capacity, blank firing guns and historical firearms. The restrictions must be introduced into the Swiss legal system by August 2018 due to its membership of the Schengen area.\n\nThe Directive also includes an exemption covering a specific Swiss issue – it allows possession to a \"target shooter\" of \"one\" firearm used during the mandatory military period after leaving the army, provided it was converted to semi-automatic only (art. 6(6) of the Amendment Directive). This part of the Directive specifically was however challenged by the Czech Republic before the European Court of Justice due to its discriminatory nature. The Czech Republic seeks nullification of the \"Swiss exemption\" as well as of other parts of the Directive.\n\nCivil rights organizations planned to hold a referendum to reject the amended EU directive. According to Swiss People's Party vice-president Christoph Blocher, Switzerland should consider abandoning EU's borderless Schengen Area if the Swiss people reject the proposed measures in a referendum.\n\nIn a referendum held on 19 May 2019, voters supported the stricter EU restrictions on semi-automatic weapons, as recommended by the government.\n\nThe Swiss army has long been a militia trained and structured to rapidly respond against foreign aggression. Swiss males grow up expecting to undergo basic military training, usually at age 20 in the recruit school, the basic-training camp, after which Swiss men remain part of the \"militia\" in reserve capacity until age 30 (age 34 for officers).\n\nPrior to 2007, members of the Swiss Militia were supplied with 50 rounds of ammunition for their military weapon in a sealed ammo box that was regularly audited by the government. This was so that, in the case of an emergency, the militia could respond quickly.\nIn December 2007, the Swiss Federal Council decided that the distribution of ammunition to soldiers would stop and that previously issued ammo would be returned. By March 2011, more than 99% of the ammo has been received. Only 2,000 specialist militia members (who protect airports and other sites of particular sensitivity) are permitted to keep their military-issued ammunition at home. The rest of the militia get their ammunition from their military armory in the event of an emergency.\n\nWhen their period of service has ended, militia men have the choice of keeping their personal weapon and other selected items of their equipment. However, keeping the weapon after end of service requires a weapon acquisition permit (art. 11-15 VPAA/OEPM).\n\nThe government sponsors training with rifles and shooting in competitions for interested adolescents, both male and female. The sale of military-issued ammunition, including Gw Pat.90 rounds for army-issued assault rifles, is subsidized by the Swiss government and made available at the many Federal Council licensed shooting ranges. That ammunition sold at ranges must be immediately used there under supervision (art. 16 WG/LArm).\n\nThe Swiss Army maintains tightened adherence to high standards of lawful military conduct. In 2005, for example, when the Swiss prosecuted recruits who had reenacted the torture scenes of Abu Ghraib, one of the charges was improper use of service weapons.\n\nRecreational shooting is widespread in Switzerland. Practice with guns is a popular form of recreation, and is encouraged by the government, particularly for the members of the militia.\n\nPrior to the turn of the century, about 200,000 people used to attend the annual \"\", which is the largest rifle shooting competition in the world. In 2012 they counted 130,000 participants. For the 2015 Federal Shooting (\"Eidg. Schützenfest\") 37,000 shooters are registered. In addition, there are several private shooting ranges which rent guns.\n\nSwitzerland has a strong gun culture compared to other countries in the world. Groups like ProTell lobby for the preservation of Switzerland's gun rights. Additionally, the Schweizerischer Schützenverein, a Swiss shooting association, organizes the \"Eidgenössische Schützenfeste\", every five years and the \"Eidgenössisches Feldschiessen\" is held annually. Every person with a Swiss citizenship, aged 10 years or older, can take part at any federal ranges and will be able to shoot for free with the ordinance rifle.\n\nAnother possibility for the children to shoot is the Young Shooters: the SAT (lit. shooting and off-duty activities) oversees lessons in which Swiss children can learn how to shoot using the SIG SG 550 starting at 15 years old for the regular course. This activity is free and the Young Shooters are able to take home the rifle in-between the lessons if they are 17. For security reasons however, the bolt has to stay at the range in which they attend the lesson. This training takes place over a span of 6 years within a 3-4-month period each year and, if wanted, they can become instructors for the new generation of Young Shooters.\n\nTraditionally liberal Swiss gun legislation has, however, been somewhat tightened in 2008, when Switzerland has complied with European Firearms Directive. Throughout the modern political history of Switzerland, there have been advocates for tighter gun control.\n\nThe most recent suggestion for tighter gun control was rejected in a popular referendum in February 2011.\n\nThe vast majority of firearm-related deaths in Switzerland are suicides. The suicide method of shooting oneself with a firearm accounted for 21.5% of suicides in Switzerland in the period of 2001–2012 (with significant gender imbalance: 29.7% of male suicides vs. 3.0% of female suicides).\n\nBy contrast, gun crime is comparatively limited. In 2016, there were 187 attempted and 45 completed homicides, for a homicide rate of 0.50 per 100,000 population, giving Switzerland one of the lowest homicide rates in the world. Of the recorded homicides (attempted or completed), 20.3% were committed with a gun (47 cases, compared to an average of 41 cases in the period of 2009–2015). In addition, there were 7 cases of bodily harm and 233 cases of robbery committed with firearms.\n\nThere were 16 completed homicides with a firearm in 2016. Of these, 14 were committed with a handgun, one with a long gun and one case marked \"other/unspecified\". None of the involved weapons were ordinance weapons issued by the Swiss Armed Forces. Similarly, out of 31 attempted homicides with firearms, 25 were committed with handguns, two with long guns and four \"other/unspecified\", with no use of ordinance weapons on record. For the period of 2009–2016, on average 16.5 out of 49.4 completed homicides were committed with a firearm, 13.8 with handguns, 1.9 with long guns and 0.9 \"other/unspecified\"; an average 0.75 cases per year (6 cases in eight years) involved ordinance weapons.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1841226", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1841226", "title": "Romer's gap", "text": "Romer's gap\n\nRomer's gap is an example of an apparent gap in the tetrapod fossil record used in the study of evolutionary biology. Such gaps represent periods from which excavators have not yet found relevant fossils. Romer's gap is named after paleontologist Alfred Romer, who first recognised it. Recent discoveries in Scotland are beginning to close this gap in palaeontological knowledge.\n\nRomer's gap ran from approximately 360 to 345 million years ago, corresponding to the first 15 million years of the Carboniferous, the early Mississippian (starting with the Tournaisian and moving into the Visean). The gap forms a discontinuity between the primitive forests and high diversity of fishes in the end Devonian and more modern aquatic and terrestrial assemblages of the early Carboniferous.\n\nThere has been long debate as to why there are so few fossils from this time period. Some have suggested the problem was of fossilization itself, suggesting that there may have been differences in the geochemistry of the time that did not favour fossil formation. Also, excavators simply may not have dug in the right places. The existence of a true low point in vertebrate diversity has been supported by independent lines of evidence, however recent finds in five new locations in Scotland have yielded multiple fossils of early tetrapods and amphibians. They have also allowed the most accurate logging of the geology of this period. This new evidence suggests that - at least locally - there was no gap in diversity or changes in oxygen geochemistry.\n\nWhile initial arthropod terrestriality was well under way before the gap, and some digited tetrapods might have come on land, there are remarkably few terrestrial or aquatic fossils that date from the gap itself. Recent work on Paleozoic geochemistry has provided evidence for the biological reality of Romer's gap in both terrestrial vertebrates and arthropods, and has correlated it with a period of unusually low atmospheric oxygen concentration, which was determined from the idiosyncratic geochemistry of rocks formed during Romer's gap. The new sedimentary logging in the Ballagan Formation in Scotland challenges this, suggesting oxygen was stable throughout Romer's Gap.\n\nAquatic vertebrates, which include most tetrapods during the Carboniferous, were recovering from the Late Devonian extinction, a major extinction event that preceded Romer's gap, one on par with that which killed the dinosaurs. In this Hangenberg event, most marine and freshwater groups became extinct or were reduced to a few lineages, although the precise mechanism of the extinction is unclear. Before the event, oceans and lakes were dominated by lobe-finned fishes and armored fishes called placoderms. After the gap, modern ray finned fish, as well as sharks and their relatives were the dominant forms. The period also saw the demise of the Ichthyostegalia, the early fish-like amphibians with more than five digits.\n\nThe low diversity of marine fishes, particularly shell-crushing predators (durophages), at the beginning of Romer's gap is supported by the sudden abundance of hard-shelled crinoid echinoderms during the same period. The Tournaisian has even been called the \"Age of Crinoids\". Once the number of shell-crushing ray-finned fishes and sharks increased later in the Carboniferous, coincident with the end of Romer's gap, the diversity of crinoids with Devonian-type armor plummeted, following the pattern of a classic predator-prey (Lotka-Volterra) cycle. There is increasing evidence that lungfish and stem tetrapods and amphibians recovered quickly and diversified in the rapidly changing environment of the end-Devonian and Romer's Gap.\n\nThe gap in the tetrapod record has been progressively closed with the discoveries of such early Carboniferous tetrapods as \"Pederpes\" and \"Crassigyrinus\". There are a few sites where vertebrate fossils have been found to help fill in the gap, such as the East Kirkton Quarry, in Bathgate, Scotland, a long-known fossil site that was revisited by Stanley P. Wood in 1984 and has since been revealing a number of early tetrapods in the mid Carboniferous; \"literally dozens of tetrapods came rolling out: \"Balanerpeton\" (a temnospondyl), \"Silvanerpeton\" and \"Eldeceeon\" (basal anthracosaurs), all in multiple copies, and one spectacular proto-amniote, \"Westlothiana\"\", \"Paleos\" Project reports. In 2016, five new species were found across the Ballagan Formation: \"Perittodus apsconditus\", \"Koilops herma\", \"Ossirarus kierani\", \"Diploradus austiumensis\", \"Aytonerpeton microps\". These stem tetrapods and amphibians provide evidence for an early split between the two groups, and rapid diversification in the Early Carboniferous.\n\nHowever, tetrapod material in the earliest stage of the Carboniferous, the Tournaisian, remains scarce relative to fishes in the same habitats, which can appear in large death assemblages, and is unknown until late in the stage. Fish faunas from Tournaisian sites around the world are very alike in composition, containing common and ecologically similar species of ray-finned fishes, rhizodont lobe-finned fishes, acanthodians, sharks, and holocephalans.\n\nRecent analysis of the Blue Beach deposits in Nova Scotia suggest that \"the early tetrapod fauna is not easily divisible into Devonian and Carboniferous faunas, suggesting that some tetrapods passed through the end Devonian extinction event unaffected.\"\n\nFor many years after Romer's gap was first recognised, only two sites yielding Tournaisian-age tetrapod fossils were known; one is in East Lothian, Scotland, and another in Blue Beach, Nova Scotia, where in 1841, Sir William Logan, the first Director of the Geological Survey of Canada, found footprints from a tetrapod. Blue Beach maintains a fossil museum that displays hundreds of Tournaisian fossils, which continue to be found as the cliff erodes to reveal new fossils.\n\nIn 2012, 350-million-year-old tetrapod remains from four new Tournaisian sites in Scotland were announced, including those from a primitive amphibian nicknamed \"Ribbo\". In 2016, five more species were unearthed from these localities, proving Scotland to be one of the most important sites in the world for understanding this time period.\n\nThese localities are the coast of Burnmouth, the banks of the Whiteadder Water near Chirnside, the River Tweed near Coldstream, and the rocks near Tantallon Castle alongside the Firth of Forth. Fossils of both aquatic and terrestrial tetrapods are known from these localities, providing an important record of the transition between life in water and life on land and filling some of the lacunae in Romer's gap. These new localities may represent a larger fauna, as all lie within a short distance of each other and share many fishes with the nearby and contemporary Foulden fish bed locality (which has not produced tetrapods thus far). As with East Kirkton Quarry, tetrapods at these sites were discovered through the long-term efforts of Stan Wood and colleagues.\n\nIn April 2013 scientists associated with the British Geological Survey (BGS) and the National Museums of Scotland announced the TW:eed project (Tetrapod World: early evolution and diversification). This project includes collaborators from across the UK, and aims to gather knowledge on the end-Devonian Early-Carboniferous world. One aim has been to drill a continuous 500-meter borehole at an undisclosed location near Berwick-upon-Tweed. This has produced a complete, centimetre-scale sampling of Tournaisian sediment, without discontinuities, providing a timeline on which fossil discoveries can be accurately placed. In the most recent paper to be produced by the TW:eed team, they announced some initial results from the core, including the apparent lack of oxygen excursion across Romer's Gap. This suggests that previous theories about low oxygen being the cause of Romer's Gap will need to be re-evaluated.\n\n"}

The marriage was annulled when Leeds discovered that Little was already married.\n\nAfter taking an acting course at the Bliss-Hayden School of Acting, Leeds signed with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and began appearing in small roles. Leeds appeared in the Red Skelton film \"The Show-Off\" (1946); \"Lady in the Lake\" (1947), based on a Raymond Chandler story; and in the Lana Turner vehicle \"Green Dolphin Street\", where she played a Eurasian who drugs the leading man and rolls him for his money.

{"id": "1841248", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1841248", "title": "Hongshan culture", "text": "Hongshan culture\n\nThe Hongshan culture () was a Neolithic culture in the Liao river basin. Hongshan sites have been found in an area stretching from Inner Mongolia to Liaoning, and dated from about 4700 to 2900 BC.\n\nThe culture is named after Hongshanhou (), a site in Hongshan District, Chifeng. The Hongshanhou site was discovered by the Japanese archaeologist Torii Ryūzō in 1908 and extensively excavated in 1935 by Kōsaku Hamada and Mizuno Seiichi.\n\nIn northeast China, Hongshan culture was preceded by Xinglongwa culture (6200–5400 BC), Xinle culture (5300–4800 BC), and Zhaobaogou culture, which may be contemporary with Xinle and a little later.\n\nYangshao culture was in the larger area and contemporary with Hongshan culture (see map). These two cultures interacted with each other.\n\nA study by Yinqiu Cui \"et al.\" from 2013 found that 63% of the combined samples from various Hongshan archeological sites belonged to the subclade N1 (xN1a, N1c) of the paternal haplogroup N-M231 and calculated N to have been the predominant haplogroup in the region in the Neolithic period at 89%, its share gradually declining over time. Today this haplogroup is most common in Finland, the Baltic states and among northern Siberian ethnicities, such as the Yakuts.\n\nOther paternal haplogroups identified in the study were C and O2a (O2a2), both of which predominate among the present-day inhabitants.\n\nNelson \"et al.\" 2020 link proto-Turkic languages and the proto-Turkic people to the Hongshan culture in a wider neolithic “Transeurasian” context (see Altaic).\n\nHongshan burial artifacts include some of the earliest known examples of jade working. The Hongshan culture is known for its jade pig dragons and embryo dragons. Clay figurines, including figurines of pregnant women, are also found throughout Hongshan sites. Small copper rings were also excavated.\n\nThe archaeological site at Niuheliang is a unique ritual complex associated with the Hongshan culture.\n\nExcavators have discovered an underground temple complex—which included an altar—and also cairns in Niuheliang. The temple was constructed of stone platforms, with painted walls. Archaeologists have given it the name \"Goddess Temple\" due to the discovery of a clay female head with jade inlaid eyes. It was an underground structure, 1m deep. Included on its walls are mural paintings.\n\nHoused inside the \"Goddess Temple\" are clay figurines as large as three times the size of real-life humans. The exceedingly large figurines are possibly deities, but for a religion not reflective in any other Chinese culture.\n\nThe existence of complex trading networks and monumental architecture (such as pyramids and the \"Goddess Temple\") point to the existence of a \"chiefdom\" in these prehistoric communities.\n\nPainted pottery was also discovered within the temple. Over 60 nearby tombs have been unearthed, all constructed of stone and covered by stone mounds, frequently including jade artifacts.\n\nCairns were discovered atop two nearby two hills, with either round or square stepped tombs, made of piled limestone. Entombed inside were sculptures of dragons and tortoises.\n\nIt has been suggested that religious sacrifice might have been performed within the Hongshan culture.\n\nJust as suggested by evidence found at early Yangshao culture sites, Hongshan culture sites also provide the earliest evidence for feng shui. The presence of both round and square shapes at Hongshan culture ceremonial centers suggests an early presence of the cosmography (\"round heaven, square earth\"). \n\nEarly feng shui relied on astronomy to find correlations between humans and the universe.\n\nSome Chinese archaeologists such as Guo Da-shun see the Hongshan culture as an important stage of early Chinese civilization. Whatever the linguistic affinity of the ancient denizens, Hongshan culture is believed to have exerted an influence on the development of early Chinese civilization. The culture also have contributed to the development of settlements in ancient Korea.\n\n\n\n"}

Magnum T.A. won the NWA United States Heavyweight Championship twice and was being groomed for a potential run with the NWA World Heavyweight Championship but a car accident in 1986 forced him into retirement. After retiring, Magnum T.A. continued to appear in non-wrestling roles for multiple promotions.\n\nAllen started wrestling in 1978 and joined the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA), where he began competing for the Championship Wrestling from Florida and the Pacific Northwest Wrestling (PNW) territories. While in the CWF, Allen won the Global Tag Team Championship on five different occasions before then moving to Mid-South Wrestling. Upon debuting in Mid-South, Allen renamed himself \"Magnum T.A.\" and adopted a character known as the \"American Heart Throb\", based on Allen's slight resemblance to actor Tom Selleck, who at the time was starring in the popular television series \"Magnum, P.I.\". Allen adopted the ring name after André the Giant suggested that he combine the Magnum name with the initials of his real name. After competing in Mid-South, he won the North American Heavyweight Championship, his first major title, after defeating Mr. Wrestling II on May 13, 1984. Magnum would hold the title for five months before he lost it to the \"Cat\" Ernie Ladd on October 16. On November 22, Magnum lost to Ladd via disqualification in a title rematch.\n\nIn 1984, the National Wrestling Alliance's Jim Crockett Promotions signed Allen. After debuting, Magnum began feuding with Wahoo McDaniel and defeated him for the United States Heavyweight Championship on March 23, 1985. At The Great American Bash, he successfully defended the title by defeating Kamala. He then began feuding with the Four Horsemen before feuding solely with Horsemen member Tully Blanchard and his valet Baby Doll. On September 28, Magnum lost to the Horsemen's leader Ric Flair in a near-30 minute title match for Flair's World Heavyweight Championship. Magnum would later lose his U.S. Title to Blanchard until Magnum regained the title in a famous \"I Quit\" match at Starrcade on November 28.\n\nIn April 1986, Magnum began feuding with Ivan Koloff, who had started proclaiming that his nephew, Nikita, would become the United States Heavyweight Champion. Jim Crockett, Jr. set up a contract signing for Magnum to defend his title against Nikita in May. At the signing, Magnum brought his mother, Marion, while Nikita brought Ivan. However, Nikita insulted Magnum's mother during the signing, instigating a fight. Then-president of the NWA, Bob Geigel, issued a public reprimand against Magnum for \"conduct unbecoming a champion.\" Magnum replied, \"Reprimand this!\" while punching Geigel. As a result, Magnum was stripped of his title and it was put up in a best of seven series between Magnum and Nikita. After losing the first three matches in a row to Nikita, Magnum began a comeback, winning the next three matches to keep the series going. In the tie-breaking match on August 17, 1986, in Charlotte, North Carolina, Nikita defeated Magnum to win the title with help from Ivan and Krusher Khruschev.\n\nOn October 14, 1986, Allen was driving in his Porsche in the rain and lost control, wrapping the car around a telephone pole. The accident happened on Sardis Road in Charlotte, North Carolina, only a couple of miles from his home. Initially, investigators believed he was speeding, but forensic reports showed he was driving the speed limit and he was left in his car for two hours before a witness called 911. The accident caused his C-4 and C-5 vertebrae to \"explode\", and it was doubted at the time whether he would ever walk again. Doctors at Carolinas Medical Center said Allen's physical conditioning saved his life. The right side of his body was paralyzed for months, ending his in-ring career. Losing Allen as a wrestler prompted NWA booker Dusty Rhodes to turn Nikita Koloff, Allen's last rival prior to his accident, into a babyface. According to the storyline, Koloff gained respect for Magnum from their feud and wanted to take his place. This was memorialized in the spring edition of the \"Wrestling '87\" magazine, with a large photograph of Koloff with the words \"I cry for Magnum T.A.\" beside him. Prior to his accident, Magnum was to win the U.S. Title for the third time before being groomed to become the NWA World Heavyweight Champion. Magnum's first on-screen appearance following the accident was on TBS's Supertowns on the Superstation, in an interview with Tony Schiavone. His first appearance in front of a live crowd was at the Crockett Cup in 1987, where, with the aid of a cane, and two referees, Magnum walked to ringside to embrace Dusty and Nikita, who would go on to defeat Tully Blanchard and Lex Luger for the tournament championship. Magnum (as \"The Boss\" Magnum T.A.) hosted an interview segment titled \"Straight Talk with The Boss\" on \"NWA World Wide Wrestling\" in 1988.\n\nMagnum later worked as a commentator for the NWA, UWF, and World Championship Wrestling (WCW), and also served as a manager for Rhodes and Koloff. In his last angle in WCW in March 1988, Magnum was attacked by his former rival Tully Blanchard, which prompted Dusty Rhodes to come to the aid of his friend. Rhodes was subsequently suspended and returned as The Midnight Rider, managed by Magnum. After Rhodes signed with Championship Wrestling from Florida and later the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), and Koloff signed with the American Wrestling Association (AWA), Magnum left JCP as well, although he would make sporadic reappearances with the promotion until 1993 at Slamboree.\n\nOn May 20, 1995, Allen made his first wrestling appearance in years as part of a legends recognition at Smoky Mountain Wrestling's \"Carolina Memories\" show in Charlotte. On January 14, 2005, Allen made an appearance as a guest at the Exodus Wrestling Alliance. He would later appear for the Carolina Wrestling Association in the corner of Jason Jones during Jones' loss to George South, Jr. on May 21. At the event Tribute To Starrcade on November 19, Magnum stood in Rhodes' corner as he lost to Tully Blanchard. On June 24, 2007, Allen, as Magnum T.A., made his first appearance for World Wrestling Entertainment at their pay-per-view, where he was noted as a former United States Champion.\n\nAllen attended high school at Norfolk Collegiate School in Norfolk, Virginia. He was a member of the collegiate wrestling team and won the state championship in the 167 pound division. After graduating high school, he attended Old Dominion University. \n\nAllen is stepfather to Tessa Blanchard, who moved in with him and her siblings and mother at age 4. He works as a manager at a network-solutions company and resides in Charlotte.\n\n"}

This album was out of print, but it has been reissued by Relapse Records as of November 2012. It is the band's only album to feature both guitarist James Murphy and bassist Terry Butler and the last to feature drummer Bill Andrews.\nThis is the first of Death's albums to show Schuldiner's lyrics moving away from the gore and horror themes of previous works, focusing instead on themes of society including abortion, genetics, and televangelism, a direction that would be further refined on 1991's \"Human\" album. The musical content is more obviously melodic, a facet highlighted by James Murphy's characteristic lead guitar playing. The members of Death and their manager/co-producer Eric Greif stayed in a single motel room at the Safari Inn, near Busch Gardens, for the entire six weeks the album was recorded and mixed, although bassist Terry Butler and drummer Bill Andrews frequently went home as they lived in the Tampa area.\n\nThis was the final Death album cover painted by Ed Repka. This period was one of massive controversy for Death, as Butler and Andrews toured Europe without Schuldiner (who refused to do the tour on the basis that it had been badly organised), with vocalist Louis Carrisalez in his place. Butler and Andrews were dismissed from the band following this incident.\n\nGreif played a Kawai K1 keyboard part in the middle of title track \"Spiritual Healing\".\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1841265", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1841265", "title": "Kingdom of Soissons", "text": "Kingdom of Soissons\n\nIn historiography, the Kingdom or Domain of Soissons refers to a rump state of the Western Roman Empire in northern Gaul, between the Somme and the Seine, that lasted for some twenty-five years during Late Antiquity. The rulers of the rump state, notably its final ruler Syagrius, were referred to as \"Kings of the Romans\" (Latin: \"rex Romanorum\") by the Germanic peoples surrounding Soissons, with the polity itself being identified as the \"Regnum Romanorum,\" \"Kingdom of the Romans\", by the Gallo-Roman historian Gregory of Tours. Whether this title was used by Syagrius himself, who claimed to be governing a Roman province and not a state independent from central imperial authority, or was applied to him by the barbarians surrounding his realm in a similar way to how they referred to their own leaders as kings is unknown.\n\nThe emergence of the Domain of Soissons began when Emperor Majorian (457–461) appointed Aegidius as \"magister militum\" of Roman Gaul. When Majorian was killed on the orders of Ricimer in 461, Aegidius maintained his own rule in the remnants of Roman Gaul that came to be known as the Domain or Kingdom of Soissons. In the chaos of contemporary Gaul, he maintained his power against Franks to his east and Visigoths to his south; his relations to the Romano-British of Brittany may have been friendly. Aegidius died in 464 or 465. His son Syagrius succeeded to the rule. In 486 Syagrius lost the Battle of Soissons to the Frankish king Clovis I and the domain was thereafter under the control of the Franks.\n\nThe Kingdom of Soissons originated in the reign of the Western Emperor Majorian (457–461). Majorian appointed Aegidius to be \"magister militum\" of the Gallic provinces. The remaining Roman territory in Gaul in the northwest was connected with the Roman possessions in the Auvergne, Provence and Languedoc which connected these to Italy. During Majorian's reign, that corridor was annexed by the Germanic tribes now occupying Gaul, thus effectively cutting off Aegidius and his citizens from the Empire. Majorian and Aegidius had recovered the Roman position in most of Gaul, but with the death of Majorian in 461 the Roman position in the center and south deteriorated. These provinces were annexed by the Visigoths and Burgundians in the years 462-477, which left the remaining Roman territories in Gaul isolated.\n\nAegidius was allied with the Alans, and with Childeric I, king of the Salian Franks of Tournai, and helped them defeat the Visigoths at Orléans in 463. According to Gregory of Tours, Aegidius even ruled the Franks during Childeric's banishment, but Childeric later returned from exile. It is possible that the \"Groans of the Britons\", referring to a Romano-British request for military assistance after the Roman departure from Britain, may have been addressed to Aegidius.\n\nAegidius continued to govern until his death in 464. His comes, Paulus of Angers, was killed shortly afterwards, possibly on the same campaign. At that point Aegidius's son, Syagrius, took his place as ruler. Syagrius governed using the title of \"dux\" (a provincial military commander), but the neighboring Germanic tribes referred to him as \"King of the Romans\"; hence one of the nicknames of his enclave. In 476, under the rule of Syagrius, the Kingdom of Soissons failed to accept the new rule of Odoacer who had dethroned the Western Emperor earlier that year. While both Syagrius and Odoacer sent messengers to the Eastern Roman Empire, the Eastern emperor Zeno chose to offer legitimacy to Odoacer instead of Syagrius. The Kingdom of Soissons cut all ties with Italy and had no further recorded contact with the Eastern Roman Empire. Even after 476, Syagrius continued to maintain that he was merely governing a Roman province. The Domain of Soissons was in fact an independent region.\n\nChilderic died about 481, and his son Clovis I became the Frankish king. Clovis made continual war against Syagrius, and in the end took over all his territory. Syagrius lost the final Battle of Soissons in 486; many historians consider this Clovis' greatest victory. Syagrius fled to the Visigothic king Alaric II, but the Franks threatened war if Syagrius were not surrendered to them. Syagrius was sent back to Clovis, who had him executed in 486 or 487.\n\nClovis I ruled the Franks until his death in 511. When he died, the Frankish realm was divided into four kingdoms, one for each of his sons. Clotaire I received the area formerly ruled by Syagrius. (Clotaire himself had been born in Soissons a decade after Syagrius' death.) By skillful diplomacy, warmongering, and murder of his relatives, Clotaire became the king of all Gaul by 555.\n\nWhen Clotaire died in 561, the Frankish realm was divided into three kingdoms, one for each son. The western kingdom of Neustria continued to be governed from Soissons until all Franks were once more unified under the Neustrian king Clotaire II in 613. Except for the period of 639-673, when a division between Neustria and Austrasia occurred, the Franks remained unified until the Treaty of Verdun in 843.\n\nWhen Aegidius was appointed \"magister militum of\" Gaul by Emperor Majorian, he took control of the remaining Roman troops in Gaul. According to Eastern Roman writer Priscus, Aegidius and Syagrius both commanded \"large forces\". At one point, Aegidius and/or Syagrius even threatened the Western Roman Empire with an invasion of Italy if the empire did not grant their requests. Their forces also offered effective resistance to the power of the Visigoth Kingdom, to the south and west of Soissons. There are however no figures available that make it possible to come to a judgement on the total strength of their troops.\n\n"}

Directed by Mike Fallows and written by Jeffrey Alan Schecter, this was the fourth film to star the Care Bears and their first in 17 years. This was also the first one in the franchise to be computer-animated.\n\nThe film centres on Funshine Bear, a Care Bear who loves to laugh and tell jokes. After one of his jokes backfires against Grumpy, another of the Bears, Funshine runs away to find a place where others can appreciate his talents better. He discovers a town known as Joke-a-lot, where laughter and humour are the order of the day, and soon becomes the area's \"King\". Unknown to the Bear, a rat named Sir Funnybone is using him that way in order to possess an important object called the Royal Sceptre.\n\n\"Journey to Joke-a-lot\" premiered in the United States on October 5, 2004, through Lions Gate, and was subsequently released overseas through Universal Studios. It received generally positive reviews, although the computer animation was singled out. In the midst of this installment's success, Lions Gate released a 2005 sequel, \"The Care Bears' Big Wish Movie\". A soundtrack album, featuring the film's songs and some original tracks, was released by Madacy Kids on the same day as the film's debut.\n\nThe Care Bears live in a cloud-filled land known as Care-a-lot (\"With All Your Heart\"). One of the Bears, Grumpy, is working on a rainbow carousel for the upcoming Care Bear Fair. His fellow Care Bears come by for a look; one of them, Funshine, loves telling jokes and making the other Care Bears laugh. After they reluctantly agree to try the carousel, it goes out of control and sends them into the sky before crashing down. Grumpy feels even worse after Funshine tries to cheer him up with a joke on height restrictions, which the other Bears find funny. Grumpy is not amused and even goes so far as to tell Funshine that if he doesn't understand that cheering up isn't making fun of, then maybe Funshine doesn't belong in Care-A-Lot. As a result, the Bears force him to make up with Funshine by apologizing. Upon reaching his house, they find no trace of their friend. Reading from a note, Tenderheart Bear realizes that Funshine has felt sorry for Grumpy and has gone in search of a place where his talents can be better appreciated. The other Bears are worried about his fate; as they cannot hold their Fair without him, they decide to look for him regardless and bring him back to Care-a-lot. Five of them— Tenderheart, Grumpy, Wish, Cheer and Share volunteer, while Laugh-a-Lot, Love-a-Lot, Friend, Good Luck, Bedtime, and Champ stay home to get ready for the fair.\n\nThe day after he runs away (\"Make Em Laugh\"), Funshine hears circus music in the distance and strays from his camping spot to find out. Taking a seat on a bumper car, he embarks on a long ride which leads him to Joke-a-lot, a town where humour is dominant (\"In the Land of Joke-a-Lot\"). The area's residents are astonished when he lands via parachute upon the town square; a female piglet called Gig tells him where he now is. Then a rat named Sir Funnybone arrives at the scene and dubs Funshine the area's long-lost King (although Funshine insists otherwise). Funnybone actually placed the car within the woods so that he could begin to gain his own power; he tells that to his henchmen, a trio of houseflies named Phido, Cleon, and Bidel.\n\nEventually, Funshine learns the hard way that \"serious\" is a very bad word in Joke-a-lot. The Joke-a-lot residents celebrate a \"Laff-Fest\" in his honour; Funnybone gives him a tour of the town and takes him to his Royal Palace, where Funshine learns of the last two Kings and is introduced to the Royal Sceptre. Stored in a vault within the voice-activated Royal Treasury, the sceptre holds the Royal Jewels of Joke-a-lot, which Funnybone says are \"the source of the magic power behind all the fun\" there; only the king is granted access. Funshine wants to look, but Funnybone tells him that a coronation is about to take place. He plans to take command of the sceptre, now in the hands of a slow, elderly alligator called Grand Duke Giggle.\n\nAt the coronation, Joke-a-lot's new \"king\" tells his audience two jokes to pass the time, before Grand Duke Giggle proceeds to give him the sceptre. Meanwhile, the other Care Bears find his belongings and take the same ride that he did. After they crash into the Royal Palace, Funshine is delighted to see them, but the Bears are a bit puzzled over what he has become. They miss Funshine and want him to return to Care-a-lot where he belongs. Even Grumpy apologizes for his earlier harsh words towards him. Thus, he must make a very difficult decision—to head back home with them, or remain King of Joke-a-lot (\"Here I'm a King\") and no longer live with his fellow Care Bears. He then announces that he will go home, but Sir Funnybone wants him to stay as king.\n\nDuring the \"Laff-Fest\", Giggle gives the sceptre to the new king. Funnybone orders Phido, Cleon, and Bidel to steal it when Funshine is not looking. He gets into the Treasury with it, unlocks the Royal Jewels, and escapes with this loot on a pink dirigible. As Grumpy is fixing his carousel, the other Bears must use it to stop Funnybone. The machine spins onto the dirigible, bursting the balloon and sending it aground.\n\nWhen the Care Bears come to Funnybone, he reveals his real name and homeland—Basil Ratbone, from the No Fun Atoll, whose inhabitants have lived through a \"serious\" \"modus operandi\". He wanted the jewels so much to enliven his fellow residents that he planned on stealing them from Joke-a-lot, and even pretended that Funshine's \"tummy symbol\" was the royal birthmark. Instead, the real one—a \"smiley mouth\"—was at the back of Gig's ears. The other Bears open the chest to find a jack-in-the-box, and other toys, which Funshine assures them are the real magic jewels. Funnybone apologizes for his misdeeds, and soon all of Joke-a-lot attends a coronation in which Gig becomes their Princess (though she is really more like a Queen). The Bears promise to return to Joke-a-lot some other day and ride home on the flying horses from their carousel.\n\n\"Journey to Joke-a-lot\" was produced at Toronto's Nelvana studio, and also at Sparx Animation, under the working title \"The Care Bears in King Funshine the Great\". The first in a tentative series, it was self-financed by Nelvana in the US$3–5 million range; a team headed by the studio's executive vice-president, Scott Dyer, oversaw its production. In early 2003, Artisan Entertainment acquired the distribution rights to the film from Nelvana. Glenn Ross, the president of Family Home Entertainment (then owned by Artisan), announced the characters' reinvention and re-introduction to parents and young viewers.\n\nUpon release, \"Journey to Joke-a-lot\" was the fourth film to feature the Care Bears, and their first one in over 15 years. It was also the first computer-animated installment in the franchise, and its first feature to go direct-to-video. Backed by an advertising campaign worth more than US$2 million, the film was released in North America by Artisan's successor, Lions Gate, on October 5, 2004; overseas rights were handled by Universal Studios soon after. In the U.S., the film's release coincided with the second annual National Care Week; it debuted at eighth place on \"Billboard\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s VHS sales chart in late October 2004, and sold more than 500,000 copies by April 2005. In January 2005, \"Journey to Joke-a-lot\" was a nominee in the \"Animated DVD Premiere Movie\" category at the fifth annual DVD Exclusive Awards. The film aired on U.S. cable television's Disney Channel in December 2004 and May 2005. In the midst of \"Joke-a-lot\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s success, Lions Gate Home Entertainment released another computer-animated film with the Care Bears, \"Big Wish Movie\", on October 18, 2005.\n\nThe DVD contains seven deleted scenes: \"Laugh If You Want To!\", \"Caring Is Serious Business\", \"Which Way to Funshine?\", \"I Wonder\", \"Packs-A-Magic!\", \"Unpacks-A-Magic!\" and \"The Great Escape!\". In his introduction to those scenes, director Mike Fallows says to the audience, \"Congratulations on finding your way this far.\" All of the scenes have partially completed animation except the last one, \"The Great Escape!\", which has finished animation.\n\nA writer for the \"Video Business\" magazine said of \"Journey to Joke-a-lot\": \"While [it] ain't no \"Shrek\"—the gold standard—the movie is still amusing enough to charm the target demographic of ages 2–5 and should do well with parents looking for harmless kiddie fare.\" Bruce Kluger of \"Parenting\" commented likewise: \"The computer animation might not be as quaint as the pen-and-ink of the 1980s version, but the new songs and brisk pace make this one a keeper for a new generation.\" In July 2005, Rob Lowing of Sydney, Australia's \"The Sun-Herald\" gave it three stars out of five, and wrote: \"Adults will find this computer-generated cartoon as sickly sweet as fairy floss but tiny tots will love the colourful blobs—oops, we mean the Care Bears. [...] Support characters that look like toys, four bright songs and lots of giggling will score with the under-fives.\" Saskatchewan's \"The Star Phoenix\" also praised the film and its soundtrack, adding that \"Even the movie is \"bear\"-able for grown-ups with subtle adult humour woven into the silliness.\" But MaryAnn Johanson of the Flick Filosopher called it a \"horrifying attempt at children's entertainment\", adding that \"The cold CGI animation removes any vestige of coziness that might have been found in what is essentially a giant advertisement for itself.\" She referred to the title setting, Joke-a-lot, as \"a sort of Oz-meets-Candyland with just a soupcon of pastel near-oddity Tim Burton might have pondered in a moment of sentimental weakness\".\n\nThe music for \"Journey to Joke-a-lot\" was composed and produced by Canadian musician Ian Thomas; Jane Siberry wrote and performed the opening track, \"With All Your Heart\". A soundtrack album released by Madacy Entertainment's Madacy Kids label features 13 tracks, five of which were featured in the film: \"With All Your Heart\", \"Make 'Em Laugh\", \"In the Land of Joke-a-lot\", \"Here I Am a King\" and \"I Like My Friends a Lot\". Some weeks after the release of \"Joke-a-lot\", Siberry performed \"With All Your Heart\" at the Alix Goolden Hall in Victoria, British Columbia; Adrian Chamberlain of that province's \"Times Colonist\" wrote that \"[she] performed [the song] with absolute sincerity, even the jaunty refrain which is whistled. Only an artist like this—so intensely focused, so innately talented—could deliver such a diversity of elements in a potent and convincing manner.\" In 2005, Ian Thomas was nominated for a Gemini Award for Best Original Score for an Animated Program or Series, for his work on the film.\n\n\n"}

A series of 65 aircraft were built and most were used by the Polish Air Force observation squadrons during World War II in 1939.\n\nThe aircraft was designed in response to a Polish Air Force requirement of 1933 for a new army cooperation plane, a successor of the Lublin R-XIII. The RWD team of the DWL workshops (\"Doświadczalne Warsztaty Lotnicze\") initially proposed the RWD-12 project, based on the RWD-8 trainer. It was however considered as not as good as the R-XIII, and was not built. Another aircraft, the RWD-14 was designed by Stanislaw Rogalski and Jerzy Drzewiecki instead. Designer Tadeusz Chyliński prepared its technical documentation.\n\nThe first prototype was flown in early 1936 (according to newest research, earlier given date December 1935 is wrong). It won the contest over the Lublin R-XXI project and the PWS factory project, but factory trials showed that its performance was still not satisfactory. In 1937 two modified prototypes were built, designated RWD-14a, but both crashed during trials that year due to steering mechanism faults (the pilots survived). Finally, in early 1938 the fourth improved prototype, designated RWD-14b, was built. After successful trials it was ordered by the Polish Air Force, receiving the name Czapla (Polish: \"heron\"), but due to a long development process, it was regarded as only an interim model, to replace the R-XIII until the advent of the more modern LWS-3 Mewa. In return for refunding the development costs, the DWL gave the rights to produce the RWD-14b to the state factory LWS (\"Lubelska Wytwórnia Samolotów\" – Lublin Aircraft Works, a successor of the Plage i Laśkiewicz).\n\nThe LWS built a series of 65 RWD-14b Czapla by February 1939. They were also known under a military designation LWS Czapla.\n\nThe Czapla entered service in the Polish Air Force in the spring of 1939, equipping some observation squadrons (\"eskadra obserwacyjna\"). Due to its long development, it was not a modern aircraft, only a little better than the Lublin R-XIII. Its advantage was its short take-off (140 m) and landing (120 m), enabling it to operate from fields and meadows. Its modern successor, the LWS-3 Mewa, did not manage to enter operational units due to the war.\n\nBy the invasion of Poland in 1939, the Polish Air Force had 35 Czaplas in five observation squadrons (out of twelve): No.'s 13, 23, 33, 53 and 63, each with seven aircraft. Squadrons were distributed among the field Armies. The remaining 30 Czaplas were initially in reserve. Several were used to supplement the combat units during the campaign (the mentioned squadrons and several others). In total, 49 Czaplas were used in units. Like the R-XIII, the Czapla was no match for any Luftwaffe fighter, bomber, or even reconnaissance aircraft, being much slower, and armed with only two machine guns. In spite of this, they were actively used for close reconnaissance and liaison tasks.\n\nMost – 35 RWD-14b were destroyed during the campaign. At least 14 were withdrawn to Romania (the sources quote numbers from 14 to 17). They were taken over by the Romanian Air Force and used for training and auxiliary duties. Several aircraft were captured in Poland by the Germans or the Soviets, but were not used by them. No RWD-14b has survived.\n\nMixed construction braced parasol high-wing monoplane, conventional in layout. A fuselage of a metal and wooden frame, covered with canvas. Wooden two-spar wings, canvas- and plywood-covered, fitted with slats. Wings were folding rearwards (width with folded wings: 3.9 m). Stabilizers of wooden construction. Conventional fixed landing gear, with a rear wheel. Crew of two, sitting in tandem in open cockpits, with twin controls and individual windshields. The observer had a 7.7 mm Vickers K machine gun, the pilot had a fixed 7.92 mm wz.33 machine gun with an interrupter gear. 9-cylinder air-cooled radial engine PZL G-1620B Mors-II with 430 hp (320 kW) nominal power and 470 hp (350 kW) take-off power. Two-blade wooden propeller. A fuel tank with a capacity of 315 litres in the fuselage, dropped in emergency. The aircraft could be fitted with radio N2L/T and camera.\n\n\n"}

Its freshwater and marine aquaria total approximately , and exhibit a variety of fish and other animals.\n\nThe Downtown Aquarium in Denver is owned and operated by Landry's Restaurants, Inc. It is accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA).\n\nColorado's Ocean Journey was founded by Bill Fleming and Judy Petersen Fleming as a nonprofit entity. It was partially funded by a $57 million bond loan as well as loans by the department of Housing and Urban Development, and its total cost was $93 million. The facility opened June 21, 1999 and soon earned accreditation by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA).\n\nAlthough the aquarium was highly successful and the attendance was high for years, after the 9/11 tragedy in 2001, the number of visitors fell drastically within a few months, and the aquarium failed to meet its attendance projections of over a million visitors per year, in part because of a downturn in the U.S. economy. The aquarium was not able to make payments on its high construction debt, and Colorado Ocean Journey Liquidation Inc. filed bankruptcy April 2002 with a $62.5 million debt. After a last-minute bidding war with Ripley's Entertainment, Landry's Restaurants, Inc. purchased the facility in March 2003 for $13.6 million.\n\nAfter the purchase, the facility remained open to the public until the summer of 2005, when it closed briefly for renovations. These included the addition of a full-service restaurant, bar, and ballroom. A marine aquarium was added to the restaurant area. Upon its reopening July 14, 2005, the facility was renamed Downtown Aquarium.\n\nA major theme for this landlocked aquarium is the relationship between inland freshwater ecosystems and the ocean. The original design of the aquarium was zoogeographic. It focused on the path to the ocean taken by two rivers, the Colorado River in North America and the Kampar River in Indonesia. The Colorado River Journey included exhibits of endangered fish, including desert pupfish; gamefish such as bass; and northern river otters, among other species. It ended with a large exhibit depicting the Sea of Cortez (Gulf of California), into which the actual Colorado River empties. The Indonesia River Journey included exhibits of animals such as Asian arowanas, rainbowfish, and endangered Sumatran tigers, among other species. It ended with a large exhibit depicting the southern Pacific Ocean. In addition to these two journeys, the aquarium housed a large sea otter exhibit.\n\nAfter the 2005 renovations, the two journey paths remain, but are no longer arranged in a strictly zoogeographic pattern. For example, tanks on the second pathway (formerly the Kampar River Journey) depict African and South American freshwater ecosystems; other tanks are mixed community aquaria. The sea otter exhibit was removed to make room for the restaurant tank.\n\nThe facility features several interactive exhibits, including a horseshoe crab touch tank and a stingray touch-and-feed tank.\n\nThe aquarium continues to focus on conservation. To that end, it houses numerous endangered or threatened species: 12 species of fish, six of reptiles, two of mammals, and two of birds. It participates in the AZA's Species Survival Plan for Sumatran tigers.\n\nA volunteer program administered by the Deep Blue Sea Foundation, a nonprofit group, is in place. The Deep Blue Sea Foundation was formed after Landry's purchased the aquarium to ensure the educational goals of the original founders would continue to be met. The aquarium also periodically hosts for-cost educational seminars.\n\n"}

It is a hard anatomical structure, a sort of curved shelly plate, now understood to be part of the body of an ammonite. Paired aptychi have, on rare occasions, been found at or within the aperture of ammonite shells. The aptychus was usually composed of calcite, whereas the ammonite shell was aragonite.\n\nAptychi can be found well-preserved as fossils, but usually quite separate from ammonite shells. This circumstance led to them being initially classified as valves of bivalves (clams), which they do somewhat resemble. Aptychi are found in rocks from the Devonian period through to those of the Cretaceous period.\nThere are many forms of aptychus, varying in shape and in the sculpture of the inner and outer surfaces. However, because they are so rarely found in position within the ammonite shell, it is often unclear which kind of aptychus belonged to which species of ammonite.\n\nWhen only a single plate is present, as is sometimes the case, the term \"anaptychus\" is used.\n\nAptychi seem to have most often existed as bilaterally-symmetrical pairs, and were first described (incorrectly) as being the valves of bivalve mollusks. Aptychi are now considered to be either: (1) a two-valved closing hatch on the shells of extinct ammonites; or (2) a double-plate jaw-piece similar to that of some modern cephalopods.\n\nSet near to or against the shell's terminal opening (the living chamber), the aptychi usually consisted of two identical but mirror image valves. Some authors consider the aptychus to be a jaw apparatus (mandibles), while others believe them to be paired opercula. If the latter is the case, then aptychi may have had a function similar to the head shield of modern nautiluses.\n\n"}

The album marked the beginning of a major stylistic change for Death, being more technically complex and progressive than the band's previous efforts. The lyrics are more introspective when compared to the gore-based lyrics of \"Scream Bloody Gore\" and \"Leprosy\" or the social commentary on \"Spiritual Healing\". This new style would continue to evolve on all following Death albums. This is the only album to feature Cynic members Paul Masvidal on guitars and Sean Reinert on drums, both only 20 at that time, and the first to feature bassist Steve DiGiorgio.\n\nBass player Steve DiGiorgio left after the recording of this album (though he would later return to record \"Individual Thought Patterns\"). He was replaced by Scott Carino, who toured with the band in 1991 and 1992. Carino also recorded the first half of bass on \"Cosmic Sea\", and the rest of the song (including the bass solo) was recorded by DiGiorgio. \n\nIn 2011, Relapse Records and Perseverance Holdings Ltd. re-issued the album to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the original release. This edition was remixed by Jim Morris of Morrisound Recording Studios, includes bonus tracks, and was authorized by Schuldiner intellectual property lawyer Eric Greif. Greif stated that it was necessary to remix the album since \"unbelievably Sony lost the original tape of the album mixes and any attempt to remaster from a CD would be a ripoff\".\n\n\"Human\" was released to critical acclaim from music publications and is seen as a pivotal release in the development of the technical death metal subgenre and on extreme metal in general.

The synod was instituted in 1970, replacing the Church Assembly, and is the culmination of a process of rediscovering self-government for the Church of England that had started in the 1850s.\n\nBefore 1919, any change to the Church's worship or governance had to be by Act of Parliament, which resulted in little being done. In 1919, the Convocations of the Provinces of Canterbury and York adopted the constitution of the National Church Assembly proposed by the Representative Church Council and presented it to the King as an appendix to an address. The constitution as proposed to the Sovereign was then recognised as already existing in the Church of England Assembly (Powers) Act 1919 thus obtaining legal recognition of the Assembly without implying that it had been created by Parliament or that Parliament could modify its constitution.\n\nBy means of the Church of England Assembly (Powers) Act 1919 Parliament then gave the Assembly power to prepare Measures which, once presented to Parliament and approved by a special procedure (see below), were to \"have the force and effect of an Act of Parliament\" on \"any matter concerning the Church of England\", and included the power to repeal or amend Acts of Parliament concerning the Church. The preparation of such measures lay mainly with a joint Legislative Committee of the three houses of the Assembly and this Committee negotiated with the parliamentary Ecclesiastical Committee to reach an agreed form.\n\nThe Act required that, after being passed by the Assembly, the measure had to be examined by a joint committee of both Houses of Parliament which prepared a report to both houses. If then approved by each House, it was submitted to the Sovereign for Royal Assent. If MPs or members of the House of Lords were not content with a Measure then they could vote to reject it, but not amend it. Once a measure had been agreed (\"deemed expedient\") by both Houses of Parliament, and received Royal Assent, it was (from 1926) printed with the Acts of Parliament for the year in question.\n\nBy the Synodical Government Measure 1969, the Church Assembly renamed and reconstituted itself as the General Synod of the Church of England. It also took over almost all the powers formerly exercised by the Convocations of Canterbury and York.\n\nThe synod is tricameral, consisting of the House of Bishops, the House of Clergy and the House of Laity. There are currently 467 members in total.\n\nThe House of Bishops is made up of the 30 diocesan bishops in the Province of Canterbury, the 12 diocesan bishops of the Province of York, the Bishop of Dover (who functions as diocesan bishop of Canterbury, in the Province of Canterbury), and seven other suffragan bishops (four from Canterbury and three from York) elected by all suffragan bishops.\n\nThe House of Clergy comprises clergy elected by the following:\n\nMembers of the House of Laity are elected by lay members of the Deanery Synod in each Diocese every five years by a system of single transferable vote. There are:\n\nThere are two or three synodical sessions per year (4–5 days each), one or two in Church House, Westminster, the other at the University of York, and each session is officially opened by the monarch. Meetings are presided over by the Archbishops of Canterbury and York as joint presidents.\n\nThe functions of the synod are:\n\nMeasures or canons must be passed by a majority of the members of each house of the synod. Most other business can be passed by a majority of the members of the synod overall. However changes to church doctrine, rites and ceremonies, or the administration of the sacraments, can only be made in the form agreed by the House of Bishops. Also, changes in the services of Baptism or Holy Communion, as well as proposals for union with any other church, cannot be approved unless they have also been approved by a majority of the diocesan synods. Some Measures do not extend to the Diocese of Sodor and Man unless so provided by a measure passed by the Sodor and Man Diocesan Synod and approved by Tynwald.\n\nThe General Synod also elects some members of the Archbishops' Council.\n\n\n"}

He was the youngest of eight children and went to school in Lichfield, Market Bosworth, and then in Birmingham under where his brother John Butt Salt taught. He took an early interest in portrait painting. While in Lichfield, he studied under a watercolour artist, John Glover, and in 1789, he went to London where he first studied under Joseph Farington and later under John Hoppner. After a time, he gave up portrait painting, having failed to build up a reputation.\n\nSalt found a position with the English nobleman George Annesley, Viscount Valentia, travelling as his secretary and draughtsman, recommended by Thomas Simon Butt. They started on an eastern tour in June 1802, sailing on the British East India Company's chartered ship \"Minerva\" to India via the Cape Colony. Salt explored the Cape of Good Hope, India, and the Red Sea area. Valentia came to describe Salt as a \"secretary-draftsman\": he was not only a companion, but also sketched the sites and scenes they encountered on their voyage. In 1805, Valentia sent Salt on a journey into the Abyssinian area (now Ethiopia) to meet with Wolde Selassie, Ras of Tigray to open up trade relations on behalf of the English. While visiting there, Salt gained the respect of the Selassie. He returned to England on 26 October 1806. His journey home took him through Egypt where he met the Pasha Mehmet Ali. Salt's paintings from the trip were used in Valentia's \"Voyages and Travels to India\", published in 1809. The originals of all the drawings were kept by Valentia, as also the copper plates after Salt's death. The format and style of the plates is similar to Thomas and William Daniell's work, \"Oriental Scenery\" (1795-1808).\n\nSalt returned to Ethiopia in 1809 on a government mission to develop trade and diplomatic links with the Ethiopian Emperor Egwale Seyon. Upon arrival, he was unable to meet with the king due to unrest in the country, so instead he went to stay with his friend the Ras Wolde Selassie. During this venture, Salt took on the side mission of verifying and correcting the information about the region reported by the Scottish traveler, James Bruce many years earlier. Salt came back to England in 1811 with numerous specimens of both plants and animals. Most notable was a species of dik-dik that was previously unknown to the people of England. He would go on to publish in 1814, \"\", whose contents were on the culture, geography, customs, and topography of Ethiopia. He also published a collection of drawings entitled \"Twenty-four Views Taken in St Helena, The Cape, India, Ceylon, Abyssinia and Egypt\". He later returned and continued a friendship with the Ethiopian warlord Sabagadis.\n\nThrough his book and details of exploration, Salt had earned himself a name in the British government and when an opening for the Consul General of Egypt opened up in 1815, Salt was recommended to the position by Lord Valentia and appointed to be the Consul General in Egypt. In 1816, he arrived in Alexandria and traveled to Cairo where he would be stationed as consul. Once set up in Cairo, he began to work on his mission of securing antiquities and artifacts for the British Museum. In order to successfully do this, he believed that he must first be on good terms with the ruler of Egypt, the Pasha Mohamed Ali (aka Mehemet Ali). Salt was able to foster beneficial relations between the British government and Ali acting as a middle man, negotiating deals concerning trade and territorial rights, earning him the affection of Ali. Ali was able to provide Salt with a good residence in the city and a place in his court in return for his help in negotiations. He also sponsored the excavations of Thebes and Abu Simbel, personally carrying out significant archaeological research at the pyramids of Giza and the Sphinx which earned him praise from Jean-François Champollion for his ability to decipher hieroglyphs. In 1825 Mr. Salt published, at his own expense, \"Essay on Dr. Young's and M. Champollion's System of Hieroglyphics; with some additional discoveries, by which it may be applied to decipher the names of the ancient kings of Egypt and Ethiopia.\"\n\nFurthermore, in his tenure as Consul General, Mr. Salt devoted himself to the task of assembling a collection of antiquities, although he was hindered in every possible way by Bernardino Drovetti, who, having been dismissed from his official post, now had the time personally to supervise the search of antiquities around the country. Drovetti had great advantages over his British rival because of his thorough knowledge of Egypt, where he had been living for many years by this time, and also thanks to his close friendship with the Pasha, Muhammad Ali of Egypt. But Salt was not easily discouraged and resorting to the same methods as his rival, he surrounded himself with agents who would not stop for anything. The year he arrived in Cairo he had the good fortune to meet both Giovanni Battista Belzoni, an extraordinary individual who immediately became his main agent, and \"Giovanni D’Athanasi\", a Greek known as \"Yanni\", who worked for him in the Thebes area from 1817 to 1827. Thanks to his assistants, Salt was able to begin selling his artifacts in just two years. \n\nHenry Salt died at the age of 47 on 30 October 1827 in the village of Desuke in Egypt. He was buried in Alexandria where he was stationed as Consul General. His paintings, papers, and artifacts he collected remain in the possession of the British Museum.\n\nHis first collection contained artifacts and pieces that Salt acquired from 1816 – 1818. When shipped to England and evaluated by specialists, the total value of the collection was estimated to be approximately \"£\"8000, although it would be sold for much less. Records show that the collection ended up being sold in February 1823. The sarcophagus of Seti I, a major piece of the collection was bought by the British architect Sir John Soane for \"£\"2000 and the rest was bought by the British Museum for the same price.\n\nFollowing the assembly of his first collection, Salt began acquiring what would be known as his second collection, containing items he collected from 1819 – 1824. While Salt's primary intention was to sell to the British Museum again, this time for a yearly pension of \"£\"600 for his service as the Consul, it would ultimately be rejected due to the price. Despite the British concerns over price, the French royalty wanted to buy the collection and display it at the Louvre, which they did in 1826 for a total of \"£\"10,000.\n\nSalt would spend the rest of his life putting together a third collection which featured his antiquities acquired from 1825 to his death in 1827. This collection was sold years after his death when an agent of his sold it to the British Museum for over \"£\"7000.\n\n\nSalt was portrayed by Robert Portal in the 2005 BBC docudrama \"Egypt\".\n\n"}

{"id": "1841309", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1841309", "title": "10/90 gap", "text": "10/90 gap\n\nThe 10/90 gap is the term adopted by the Global Forum for Health Research to highlight the finding by the Commission on Health Research for Development in 1990, that less than 10% of worldwide resources devoted to health research were put towards health in Developing Countries, where over 90% of all preventable deaths worldwide occurred. Every year, the spread of disease suffered in both rich and poor countries converges. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the most prevalent diseases consist of cardiovascular disease, cancer and diabetes. These diseases now account for 45% of the global health burden and is the culprit for up to 85% of deaths in low-income countries. The 10/90 Gap focuses on joining organisations together to reduce these statistics.\n\nA substantial portion of diseases, most prevalent in impoverished or developing countries, are those which are preventable and/or treatable. The World Health Organization (2004) stated in their world health report that an estimated eight million individuals die prematurely, from diseases and conditions that can be cured, every year. These deaths contribute to approximately one third of all human deaths in the world, each year. Table 1 lists several of these curable diseases.\n\nTable 1: Causes of avoidable deaths.\n\nGlobal health organisations across the globe have explicitly made research into health their priority. In 2000, World Health Organization established the Commission on Macroeconomics and Health, who in their 2001 report, verified the relationship between poverty and disease and discussed the benefit of investment on the economic climates of developing countries. Possible strategies that can be implanted to help reduce the 10/90 gap are, policies prioritizing funding for health research, also developing capacities of credible public and private health research institutions. Also activities of international NGOs to undertake research aimed at resolving the gap, and the setting up of research based mechanisms to ensure access to new effective products for the treatment and prevention of poverty-related diseases. However, given the number of diseases that are preventable, other factors that are blocking the access of patients to these products, such as cost of treatments to the individual, also need to be addressed, rather that just focusing on developing new drugs. There is also a need to build the primary health care sector in developing countries. It has been shown that early detection and effective management of disease can be provided by appropriately-trained, non-physician, healthcare workers.\n\nThe gap between financial needs and financial means in low income countries can only be filled by donations. The average health expenditure per capita in western countries is estimated at $947 compared to $20 per capita in low income countries. To assist the world's poorest, health expenditure between $44–60 per capita is placed as a target. This target is achieved by the contribution of 0.1% of advanced western countries gross national production (GNP) to fund global health, this recommendation was set by the WHO in 2001 and is estimated to save 8 million lives per year.\n\nAmong other efforts to address this issue are recent proposals for a Global Research and Development (R&D) treaty, and the creation of the nonprofit pharmaceutical company OneWorld Health which develops new and affordable medicines for neglected diseases. A treaty creates a system that allows health research to come from contributions by all and therefore the sharing of benefits for all, improving the fairness and sustainability of global research and development. In a positive development for the closing of the gap, in the 2012 London Declaration on Neglected Tropical Diseases many parties, including governments, funding organisations and drug companies, agreed to work towards the eradication of neglected tropical diseases.\n\nDespite the findings of the World Health Organization, and the disparity of curable diseases throughout developing and developed countries, some people believe the 10/90 gap is a myth. They criticise the fact that simple medicines which stop curable and treatable conditions such as diarrhoea and malaria are available to these countries. The issue is not with the medicine, but with the ability for the affected to access it. Access to medicine can be inhibited by many circumstances such as poverty, strict government regime and inadequate healthcare systems and infrastructure.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1841311", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1841311", "title": "Plain English", "text": "Plain English\n\nPlain English (or layman's terms) is language that is intended to be clear and concise. It attempts to avoid complex vocabulary. It attempts to be free of clichés and needless technical jargon, and should be appropriate to the audience's developmental or educational level and their familiarity with the topic. The term is commonly used when discussing government or business communication.\n\nThe term derives from the 16th-century idiom \"in plain English\", meaning \"in clear, straightforward language\". Another name for the term, layman's terms, is derived from the idiom \"in layman's terms\" which refers to language phrased simply enough that a Layman, or common person, can understand.\n\nIn 1946, writer George Orwell wrote an essay entitled, \"Politics and the English Language\", where he criticized the dangers of \"ugly and inaccurate\" contemporary written English. The essay focuses particularly on politics where \"pacification\" can be used to mean \"...defenceless villages are bombarded from the air, the inhabitants driven out into the countryside, the cattle machine-gunned, the huts set on fire with incendiary bullets...\".\n\nIn 1948, HM Treasury asked Sir Ernest Gowers to provide a guide to officials on avoiding pompous and over-elaborate writing. He wrote, \"writing is an instrument for conveying ideas from one mind to another; the writer's job is to make his reader apprehend his meaning readily and precisely.\"\n\nGowers' guide was published as a slim paperback \"Plain Words, a guide to the use of English\" in 1948, followed by a sequel \"The ABC of Plain Words\" in 1951, and a hardback book combining the best of both, \"The Complete Plain Words\", in 1954 – which has never been out of print since. Gowers argued that legal English was a special case, saying that legal drafting: \nThere is a trend toward plainer language in legal documents. Plain English Campaign has been campaigning since 1979 \"against gobbledygook, jargon and misleading public information.\" The campaign has helped many government departments and other official organisations with their documents, reports and publications. They believe that everyone should have access to clear and concise information.\" The 1999 \"Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts\" regulations mandate \"plain and intelligible\" language.\n\nAn inquiry into the 2005 London bombings recommended that emergency services should always use plain English. It found that verbosity can lead to misunderstandings that could cost lives.\n\nThe National Adult Literacy Agency (NALA). is the national leader in plain English training and provision in Ireland. Since 2005, NALA has supported organisations and government departments to use plain English through its training, style guides and editing work. In 2019, NALA saw its lobbying work pay off when a Draft Plain Language Act (2019) received cross party support, but Brexit discussions and then the Covid-19 virus put the draft act on hold. NALA and other plain English advocates hope that the draft Act is enacted soon. Meanwhile, NALA continues to support domestic and international efforts to make information accessible to all (particularly those with literacy and numeracy needs).\n\nIn early 2020, NALA developed an A-Z plain English guide to COVID-19 terms and continues to provide support and advise to those who wish to improve the quality and clarity of their information. It is also a keen supporter of, and contributor to, the evolving international plain language standards.\n\nIn the US, the plain language movement in government communication started in the 1970s. The Paperwork Reduction Act was introduced in 1976, and in 1978 President Carter issued executive orders intended to make government regulations \"cost-effective and easy-to-understand by those who were required to comply with them.\" Many agencies now have long-standing policies mandating plain language; in 2010, this was made a federal requirement with the Plain Writing Act.\n\nIn legal writing, David Mellinkoff, a professor at the UCLA School of Law, is widely credited with singlehandedly launching the plain English movement in American law with the 1963 publication of \"The Language of the Law.\" In 1977, New York became the first state to pass legislation requiring plain English in consumer contracts and leases. In 1979, Richard Wydick published \"Plain English for Lawyers\". Plain English writing style is now a legal duty for companies registering securities under the Securities Act of 1933, due to rules the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) adopted in 1998. In 2011, PLAIN (Plain Language Action and Information Network) published \"Federal Plain Language Guidelines\".\n\nLinguist and law school professor, Peter Tiersma, wrote an article titled \"Instructions to jurors: Redrafting California’s jury instructions\" in \"The Routledge Handbook of Forensic Linguistics\" in 2010. He outlines the history of legal trials and how pattern jury instructions were developed in order to create an atmosphere in which jurors are given pertinent information to a case in order to determine factual evidence and guilt of an accused individual. Throughout the 1930s and 1940s in California, a panel comprising judges and lawyers drafted pattern jury instructions.\n\nThese standardized jury instructions were problematic, as they were written using technical language rather than in Plain English. In the late 1970s, Robert and Veda Charrow studied jury instructions for comprehensibility, where individuals were asked to verbally summarize pattern jury instructions. The participants accounted for only one-third of pertinent information given in the jury instructions. The Charrows further identified linguistic features of these instructions that made instructions given to member of a jury difficult to understand. After revising the instructions to include a more recognized vocabulary, comprehension rose 47%.\n\nTiersma provides examples of jury instructions in both Legal English and Plain English. In the \"Book of Approved Jury Instructions\", or BAJI, instructions regarding the care of motorists when operating a motor vehicle read:\n\nTiersma points out several confusing terms and formal jargon used in this definition that would be difficult for jury participants to understand. He highlights \"to use like care\" as being overly formal and \"pedestrian\" as being atypically defined including individuals using wheelchairs and \"motorized quadrangles.\" The \"California Jury Instructions: Criminal\" or CACI, rework these instructions and read:\n\nThe CACI instructions are in common language and are more direct. Jury instructions that are more direct have been criticized, saying that utilizing a more recognizable vocabulary would make the instructions less precise in a legal atmosphere.\n\nClick on the hyperlink to see the full citation.\n\n"}

Founded in 109 BCE, Xuancheng has over 2,000 years of history. Located in the lower Yangtze River drainage basin and Yangtze River Delta, it borders Wuhu to the northwest, Chizhou to the west, Huangshan to the southwest, and the provinces of Zhejiang and Jiangsu to the southeast and northeast respectively.\n\nAs early as the Western Han Dynasty (206BC-24AD), Danyang Commandery was established on this region with Wanling (presently Xuanzhou District, the site of the Xuancheng Municipal Government) as its capital city. Xuanzhou has been the political, economic and cultural center of administration since then.\n\nIts terrain is varied and complicated, basically sloping downward from the south to the north. Its landform can be approximately divided into five types: mountain, hill, valley and basin, hillock and plain. The south and southeast regions belong to ranges of Tianmu Mountain, while the southwest and west regions are respectively parts of ranges of Mt. Huangshan and Mt. Jiuhua.\n\nThe city has a subtropical humid monsoon climate, with four distinct seasons and abundant precipitation. Of the four seasons, summer is the longest. Its annual average temperature falls round 15.6C (60.1F). Most of the rainfall occurs in summer. The plum rain season lasts from mid-June to early July.\n\nXuancheng City administers seven county-level divisions, including one district, one county-level city and five counties.\n\n\nThese are further divided into 115 township-level divisions, including 61 towns, 44 townships and ten subdistricts.\n\nIn Xuancheng, Jianghuai Mandarin and Wu Chinese are spoken as well as Standard Mandarin.\n\nXuancheng is a city with 2,000 years of history and cultural relics. It has a profound cultural heritage and rich tourism resources. There are many scenery resorts, such as the country's largest captive breeding bases—Chinese Crocodile Lake, one of the four unique scenes – Taiji Cave, Peach Blossom Pool, Jing Ting Mountain, Zhangshan Canyon, and cultural sites of the New Fourth Army, the Ancestral Hall of the Hu Family in Jixi, the former residence of Mr. Hu Shih, the Jiang's Village in Jingde, and so on. Since reform and opening up, the city has achieved a lot of progress, and is accelerating the development of municipal services, transport, tourism and other infrastructural facilities. Xuancheng, as a new city with pleasant environments of living, enterprising, sightseeing, is on the rise.\n\nXuancheng is known for its production of high quality Xuan paper (), Xuan writing brushes (), and Xuan ink stones (), all of which are used in traditional Chinese calligraphy and painting. These products make up a large proportion of the city's exports.\n\n\n\nXuancheng is served by the Anhui–Jiangxi Railway and Beijing–Taipei High-Speed Rail Corridor.\n\n"}

They first appeared in William Randolph Hearst's newspaper, the \"New York Journal\" on September 22, 1901, in a strip titled: \"Alphonse a la Carte and His Friend Gaston de Table d'Hote\". The strip was later distributed by King Features Syndicate. \n\nTheir \"After you, Alphonse.\", \"No, you first, my dear Gaston!\" routine entertained readers for more than a decade. Alphonse was short and grotesque; Gaston was tall and grotesque. The strip's premise was that both were extremely polite, constantly bowing and deferring to each other. Neither could ever do anything or go anywhere because each insisted on letting the other precede him.\n\nThough never a daily or even weekly feature, \"Alphonse and Gaston\" appeared on Sundays for several years. In addition to Hearst collections and licensed products, it was adapted into a stage play and several comedy shorts.\n\nA prolific artist and writer, Opper's other creations included \"Willie\", \"Hans from Hamburg\", \"Our Antediluvian Ancestors\", \"And Her Name Was Maud\" and \"Happy Hooligan\". The characters would occasionally make guest appearances outside their own strips. On one occasion, \"And Her Name Was Maud\" featured an appearance by Alphonse and Gaston aboard a runaway sleigh, each of them bowing to the other in the seat.\n\nThe strip faded from public view shortly after Opper's death in 1937, but the catchphrase \"After you, my dear Alphonse\" lived on. It continues to the present day, spoken in situations when two people are being overly courteous to each other, or when a person receives a dare to do something difficult or dangerous or both; the catchphrase returns the dare to the person who made it. Sometimes it is said when two people are simultaneously trying to go through the same doorway and awkwardly stop, each to let the other go through.\n\nThe phrase \"Alphonse-and-Gaston routine\", or \"Alphonse-Gaston Syndrome\", indicates a situation wherein one party refuses to act until another party acts first. From a September 23, 2009, \"New York Times\" editorial: \"For years, China and the United States have engaged in a dangerous Alphonse-and-Gaston routine, using each other’s inaction to shirk their responsibility.\"\n\nAlphonse and Gaston exchanges have also been employed by sportscasters during baseball broadcasts when two outfielders go after the ball and it falls in for a base hit. Also, the phrase has a specific meaning in baseball lingo: when two fielders allow a catchable ball to drop between them, it is known as “doing the Alphonse and Gaston.”\n\nThe 1909 short farce-comedy \"Alphonse and Gaston\" by Frank Dumont is based around the characters.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1841344", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1841344", "title": "Tableau vivant", "text": "Tableau vivant\n\nA ' (often shortened to ', plural: ), French for 'living picture', is a static scene containing one or more actors or models. They are stationary and silent, usually in costume, carefully posed, with props and/or scenery, and may be theatrically lit. It thus combines aspects of theatre and the visual arts.\n\nA tableau may either be 'performed' live, or depicted in painting, photography and sculpture, such as in many works of the Romantic, Aesthetic, Symbolist, Pre-Raphaelite, and Art Nouveau movements.\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries, tableaux sometimes featured ('flexible poses') by virtually nude models, providing a form of erotic entertainment, both on stage and in print.\n\nTableaux continue to the present day in the form of living statues, street performers who busk by posing in costume.\n\nOccasionally, a Mass was punctuated with short dramatic scenes and painting-like . They were a major feature of festivities for royal weddings, coronations and royal entries into cities. Often the actors imitated statues or paintings, much in the manner of modern street entertainers, but in larger groups, and mounted on elaborate temporary stands along the path of the main procession.\n\nThe history of Western visual arts in general, until the modern era, has had a focus on symbolic, arranged presentation, and (aside from direct personal portraiture) was heavily dependent on stationary artists' models in costume – essentially small-scale with the artist as temporary audience. The Realism movement, with more naturalistic depictions, did not begin until the mid-19th century, a direct reaction against Romanticism and its heavy dependence on stylized format.\n\nBefore radio, film and television, were popular forms of entertainment, even in frontier towns. Before the age of color reproduction of images, the was sometimes used to recreate artworks on stage, based on an etching or sketch of a painting. This could be done as an amateur venture in a drawing room, or as a more professionally produced series of presented on a theatre stage, one following another, usually to tell a story without requiring all the usual trappings and production of a full theatre performance. They thus influenced the form taken by later Victorian and Edwardian era magic lantern shows, and perhaps also sequential narrative comic strips (which first appeared in modern form in the late 1890s).\n\nTheatrical censorship in Britain and the United States forbade actresses to move when nude or semi-nude on stage, so had a place in risqué entertainment for many years. In the early 1900s, German dancer Olga Desmond appeared in \"Schönheitsabende\" ('Evenings of Beauty') in which she posed nude in \"living pictures\", imitating classical works of art.\n\nIn the nineteenth century, took such titles as \"Nymphs Bathing\" and \"Diana the Huntress\" and were to be found at such places as the Hall of Rome in Great Windmill Street, London. Other venues were the Coal Hole in the Strand and the Cyder Cellar in Maiden Lane. Nude and semi-nude were also a frequent feature of variety shows in the US: first on Broadway in New York City, then elsewhere in the country. The Ziegfeld Follies featured such from 1917. The Windmill Theatre in London (1932–1964) featured nude on stage; it was the first, and for many years the only, venue for them in 20th-century London.\n\nJean-François Chevrier was the first to use the term in relation to a form of art photography, which began in the 1970s and 1980s in an essay titled \"The Adventures of the Picture Form in the History of Photography\" in 1989. The initial translation of this text substitutes the English word \"picture\" for the French word . However Michael Fried retains the French term when referring to Chevrier's essay, because according to Fried (2008), there is no direct translation into English for in this sense. While \"picture\" is similar, \"... it lacks the connotations of constructedness, of being the product of an intellectual act that the French word carries.\" (p. 146)\nOther texts and Clement Greenberg's theory of medium specificity also cover this topic.\n\nThe key characteristics of the contemporary photographic according to Chevrier are, firstly:\n\nThey are designed and produced for the wall. summoning a confrontational experience on the part of the spectator that sharply contrasts with the habitual processes of appropriation and projection whereby photographic images are normally received and \"consumed\" (p. 116)\n\nBy this, Chevrier notes that scale and size is obviously important if the pictures are to \"hold the wall\". But size has another function; it distances the viewer from the object, requiring one to stand back from the picture to take it all in. This \"confrontational\" experience, Fried notes, is actually quite a large break from the conventional reception of photography, which up to that point was often consumed in books or magazines.\n\nThe photographic has its roots not in the theatrical , but in pictorialist photography, such as that of Alfred Stieglitz, a movement with its roots in Aestheticism, which already made heavy use of the as a non-theatrical visual art style. Pictorialism, according to Jeff Wall could be seen as an attempt by photographers to imitate painting (perhaps unsuccessfully):\n\nPictorialist photography was dazzled by the spectacle of Western painting and attempted, to some extent, to imitate it in acts of pure composition. Lacking the means to make the surface of its pictures unpredictable and important, the first phase of Pictorialism, Stieglitz's phase, emulated the fine graphic arts, re-invented the beautiful look, set standards for gorgeousness of composition, and faded. (p. 75)\n\nHowever photography did have the ability to unpredictable and spontaneous. This was achieved by making photographs related to the inherent capabilities of the camera itself. And this, Wall argues, was a direct result of photojournalism, and the mass media and pop culture industries. By divesting itself of the encumbrances and advantages inherited from older art forms, reportage, or the spontaneous fleeting aspect of the photographic image pushes toward a discovery of qualities apparently intrinsic to the medium, qualities that must necessarily distinguish the medium from others and through the self-examination of which it can emerge as a modernist art on a plane with others. (pp. 76–78)\n\nThe argument is that, unlike most other art forms, photography can profit from the capture of chance occurrences. Through this process – the snapshot, the \"accidental\" image – photography invents its own concept of the picture. A hybrid form of the \"Western picture\" (pictorialist photography) and the spontaneous snapshot. This is the stage whereby Wall argues that photography enters a \"modernist dialectic\". Wall states that unpredictability is key to modern aesthetics. This new concept of the picture, which Wall proposes, with the compositional aspects of the Western picture combined with the unpredictability that the camera affords through its shutter, can be seen in the work of many contemporary photographic artists including Luc Delahaye, Andreas Gursky, Thomas Struth, Irene Caesar, and Philip-Lorca diCorcia.\n\nThe \"tableau\" as a form still dominates the art photography market. As Fried notes: \"Arguably the most decisive development in the rise of the new art photography has been the emergence, starting in the late 1970s and gaining impetus in the 1980s and after, of what the French critic Jean-François Chevrier has called the \"\"tableau\" form\" (p. 143).\n\nHowever, there appears to be only a handful of young, emerging artists working within the \"tableau\" form. Examples include Florian Maier Aichen, Matthew Porter and Peter Funch. More recently, Canadian artist, Sylvia Grace Borda, has worked since 2013 to continue to stage \"tableaux\" for the camera within the Google Street View engine. Her work creates 360° immersive \"tableau vivant\" images for the viewer to explore. Through her efforts to pioneer the \"tableaux vivant\" for online exploration, she and her collaborator, John M. Lynch, won the Lumen Prize 2016 for Web Arts.\n\nThe 1969 film, \"The Color of Pomegranates\" directed by Sergei Parajanov presents a loose biography of the Armenian poet Sayat Nova in a series of \"tableaux vivants\" of Armenian costume, embroidery and religious rituals depicting scenes and verses from the poet's life.\n\nThe 2013 film, \"A Field in England\", makes use of the effect to add to the general occult look of the film.\n\nThere is a 2014 feature film produced entirely in \"tableau\" format titled \"In the Crosswind\".\n\n\n\n"}

A section of the park was fenced off for camping during the weekend of the festival. The festival was for a time sponsored in part by the digital radio station BBC 6 Music, which in return had exclusive broadcasting rights. The festival usually took place in August and grew from two stages to five over the course of six years. In 2005 the festival welcomed over 70 artists, both well-known and established bands, and local bands from around the East Midlands. This extended to over 100 bands, and the first ever sold-out festival in 2006.\n\nThe festival in later years was run over five stages: The Outside Stage was by far the largest and hosted the bigger bands, in conjunction with the Indoor Stage, the main auditorium of the De Montfort Hall. In addition, The Musician Stage was a tent featuring mainly acoustic and roots music at times when the Outside stage is quiet, and The Rising Stage featured new and local talent. In 2006 the eFESTIVALS Cabaret Stage was added, and these were added to in 2008 by the Phrased & Confused/Bathysphere tent, offering spoken word performances during the day and electronica artists later on. In 2012, the Musician Stage and the Rising Stage were replaced by two new performance spaces in The Village, named the Into the Wild stage and the Watering Hole following the festival's safari theme.\n\nFrom 2006 the festival was preceded the night before it began by an official warm up party, hosted by Pineapster to provide entertainment to those campers arriving in the City on the Thursday night and raise money for LOROS, a local hospice. From 2007 it became a full Fringe festival event entitled the Summer Sundae Fringe Festival occurring in the week or fortnight up to the festival curated by local arts bodies across Leicester and Leicestershire, culminating in a series of warm-up parties. In March 2008 the festival put on a Taste of Summer Sundae gig to provide a flavour of the bands expected to play the main festival.\nThe 2012 Summer Sundae Weekender festival took place 17–19 August.

Leading figures in the local community petitioned the King, Edward VI, to secure the school's future, and on 21 September 1551 the school was given a plot of land and money raised from three fairs by the king, which was administered by a Foundation which exists to this day. In 1564, Elizabeth I granted the manor of Louth and some additional property to support the school.\n\nUntil 1964 King Edward's was a boys' school.

His paternal grandfather, George Martin Balchin (1830-1898), of a line of wealthy Surrey farmers, was a farmer of 800 acres; his sudden decision in 1887 to cease work on his farm had a negative impact on the Balchin family's finances. At the age of eighteen months, Nigel knocked over a kettle of scalding water, and was so badly burned that he was not expected to survive. He was educated at Dauntsey's School and Peterhouse, Cambridge, where he took a scholarship and became a Prizeman in Natural Sciences. He then worked for the National Institute of Industrial Psychology between 1930 and 1935. For part of this time he was a consultant to JS Rowntree & Sons, where he was involved in the design and marketing of Black Magic chocolates and, he claimed, responsible for the success of the company's Aero and Kit Kat brands.\n\nHe wrote for \"Punch\" magazine, published three non-fiction books as Mark Spade, and also wrote novels under his own name. During World War II he was a civil servant at the Ministry of Food, and then, on the basis of his pioneering work on personnel selection and scientific research, appointed Deputy Scientific Adviser to the Army Council, being promoted to the rank of brigadier at the early age of thirty-six. In 1956, he moved abroad to write screenplays in Hollywood and elsewhere, but was increasingly troubled by alcoholism, and returned permanently to England in 1962. He died in 1970 at a nursing home in Hampstead, London, and is buried on the edge of the north path in Hampstead Cemetery in north London. His gravestone is small, but distinctive, having the form of an open book.\n\nHis novels enjoyed great popular success for a time. \"Darkness Falls from the Air\" is set during the London Blitz and was written while the bombing was still in progress. \"The Small Back Room\" became a Powell and Pressburger film of the same title. \"A Way Through the Wood\" was adapted as a stage play, \"Waiting for Gillian\", and as the 2005 film \"Separate Lies\", which marked the directorial debut of Oscar-winning screenwriter Julian Fellowes. Other critically acclaimed Balchin novels include \"A Sort of Traitors\", \"Sundry Creditors\", \"The Fall of the Sparrow\" and \"Seen Dimly before Dawn\".\n\nAs a screenwriter he worked on an early draft of \"Cleopatra\" but is principally remembered for \"The Man Who Never Was\", for which he won the 1957 BAFTA Award for Best British Screenplay, and \"Mandy\", the story of a deaf child. He also wrote the screenplay for \"The Singer Not the Song\" and adapted two of his own novels for the screen.\n\nBalchin was married twice, firstly in 1933 to Elisabeth Evelyn Walshe, daughter of the novelist Douglas Walshe, whom he had met at Cambridge where she was reading English, archaeology and anthropology at Newnham. Their children were:\n\nHis first marriage broke up following a partner-swapping arrangement between the Balchins, the artist Michael Ayrton and the latter's partner Joan. Elisabeth also had an affair with the composer Christian Darnton. Balchin divorced Elisabeth in 1951 and she married Ayrton a year later.. Balchin included an unflattering caricature of Darnton as the poet Stephen Ryle in his novel \"Darkness Falls from the Air\" (1942). \n\nIn 1953 he married Yovanka (later Jane) Zorana Tomich.

A nine-time All-Star, Burgess became known, later in his career, for his abilities as an elite pinch hitter, setting the MLB career record for career pinch-hits with 145. During his playing days, he stood tall, weighing . Burgess batted left-handed and threw right-handed.\n\nBorn in Caroleen, North Carolina, Burgess was signed as an amateur free agent by the Chicago Cubs in 1944. In , he led the Tri-State League with a .387 batting average. Burgess followed that by leading (minimum 100 games played) the Southern Association with a .386 average, in . He made his major league debut at the age of 22 with the Chicago Cubs on April 19, 1949. In October 1951, Burgess was traded to the Cincinnati Reds, who promptly traded him to the Philadelphia Phillies for catcher Andy Seminick before the start of the 1952 season. With the Phillies, he platooned alongside the right-handed-hitting Stan Lopata. Burgess had his best season in 1954, when he had a .368 batting average in 108 games for the Phillies, earning his first All-Star Game selection.\n\nAt the beginning of the 1955 season, Burgess was once again traded for Andy Seminick and returned to Cincinnati, where he finally got the chance to play every day. He rose to the occasion, hitting for a .306 batting average for the rest of the season along with 20 home runs and 77 runs batted in, gaining his second consecutive berth on the National League All-Star team. On July 29, 1955, Burgess hit three home runs and had nine runs batted in during a game against the Pittsburgh Pirates. He began the 1956 season as the Reds' starting catcher, but when the team faltered early in the season, Reds manager Birdie Tebbetts decided to shake things up, and replaced Burgess with a younger man, Ed Bailey.\n\nIn 1959, Burgess was traded along with Harvey Haddix and Don Hoak to the Pittsburgh Pirates for Frank Thomas,Whammy Douglas, Jim Pendleton and John Powers. He was the Pirates catcher on May 26, 1959 when Haddix took a perfect game into the 13th inning against the Milwaukee Braves, before losing the game. Burgess also won a World Series with the Pirates in 1960, batting .333 in the seven-game series.\n\nBy 1963, Jim Pagliaroni had taken over as the Pirates' starting catcher and in late 1964, Burgess was acquired by the Chicago White Sox, who were in the middle of a heated pennant race. In his first plate appearance with the White Sox, on September 15, against the Detroit Tigers, he hit a game-tying home run off pitcher Dave Wickersham. Over the next three years, Burgess was used almost exclusively as a pinch hitter, appearing in just 7 games behind the plate. In , he set a Major League record which still stands for the most games in a season (79) by a non-pitcher who did not score a run.\n\nBurgess played his final major league game on October 1, 1967 at the age of 40.\n\nDuring an eighteen-year major league career, Burgess played in 1,691 games, hitting for a .295 career batting average, with 126 home runs, 673 RBI, and a .362 on-base percentage. He accumulated 1,318 career hits, with 230 doubles, and 33 triples. His .295 career batting average ranked him 10th among Major League catchers, as of 2009. A six-time All-Star, Burgess led National League (NL) catchers in fielding percentage three times, in 1953, 1960, and 1961. His Major League record of 145 career pinch hits was broken by Manny Mota, in . Along with Curt Simmons, he was the last player to formally retire, who had played in the major leagues in the 1940s (not counting Minnie Miñoso, who un-retired twice).\n\nWhen his playing career ended, Burgess spent many years with the Atlanta Braves as a scout and minor league with the Pulaski Braves, in Pulaski, VA. \n\nBurgess was inducted into the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame, in 1975. \n\nBurgess was inducted into the North Carolina Sports Hall of Fame, in 1978. \n\nBurgess died at age 64, in Rutherfordton, North Carolina, September 15, 1991.\n\n\n"}

Christian missionaries have translated \"God\" as \"Gitche Manitou\" in scriptures and prayers in the Algonquian languages.\n\n\"Manitou\" is a common Algonquian term for spirit, mystery, or deity. Native American Churches in Mexico, United States and Canada often use this term.\n\nIn more recent Anishinaabe culture, the Anishinaabe language word \"Gichi-manidoo\" means Great Spirit, the Creator of all things and the Giver of Life, and is sometimes translated as the \"Great Mystery\". Historically, Anishinaabe people believed in a variety of spirits, whose images were placed near doorways for protection.\n\nAccording to Anishinaabeg tradition, \"Michilimackinac\", later named by European settlers as Mackinac Island, in Michigan, was the home of Gitche Manitou, and some Anishinaabeg tribes would make pilgrimages there for rituals devoted to the spirit.\nIn Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's \"The Song of Hiawatha\", Gitche Manitou is spelled \"Gitche Manito\".\n\nOther Anishinaabe names for God incorporated through the process of syncretism are \"Gizhe-manidoo\" (\"venerable \"Manidoo\"\"), \"Wenizhishid-manidoo\" (\"Fair \"Manidoo\"\") and \"Gichi-ojichaag\" (\"Great Spirit\"). While \"Gichi-manidoo\" and \"Gichi-ojichaag\" both mean \"Great Spirit\", \"Gichi-manidoo\" carried the idea of the greater spiritual connectivity while \"Gichi-ojichaag\" carried the idea of individual soul's connection to the \"Gichi-manidoo\". Consequently, Christian missionaries often used the term \"Gichi-ojichaag\" to refer to the Christian idea of a Holy Spirit.\n\nIn addition to the Algonquian Anishinaabeg, many other tribes believed in \"Gitche Manitou\". References to the Great Manitou by the Cheyenne and the Oglala Sioux (notably in the recollections of Black Elk), indicate that belief in this deity extended into the Great Plains, fully across the wider group of Algonquian peoples.\n\nCognate terms recorded in other Algonquian languages include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Gitche Manitou\" has been seen as those cultures' analogue to the Christian God. When early Christian (especially French Catholic) missionaries preached the Gospel to the Algonquian peoples, they adopted \"Gitche Manitou\" as a name for God in the Algonquian languages. This can be seen, for example, in the English translation of the \"Huron Carol\".\n\nSpirits who were either aspects of Gitche Manitou or lesser spirits under Gitche Manitou include:\n\nManitou is the spiritual and fundamental life force among Algonquian groups in the Native American mythology. Manitou is one aspect of the interconnection and balance of nature and life, similar to the East Asian concept of \"qi.\" In simpler terms it can refer to a spirit. This spirit is seen as a person as well as a concept. Everything has its own manitou—every plant, every stone and, since their invention, even machines. These manitous do not exist in a hierarchy like European gods/goddesses, but are more akin to one part of the body interacting with another and the spirit of everything; the collective is named \"Gitche Manitou\".\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1841385", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1841385", "title": "Projectionist", "text": "Projectionist\n\nA projectionist is a person who operates a movie projector. In the strict sense of the term this means any film projector and therefore could include someone who operates the projector in a show. In common usage the term is generally understood to describe a paid employee of a movie theater. They are also known as \"operators\".\n\nN.B. The dates given in the subject headings are approximate.\n\nThe need for professional projectionists arose from the commercial showing of movie films to the general public in buildings specifically designed for the purpose or using variety theatres as part of the \"bill\", which began towards the end of the first decade of the twentieth century. Before the emergence of purpose-built movie theaters, film projectors in venues such as fairgrounds, music halls and Nickelodeons were usually operated by a showman or presenter, in the same way as a lanternist. The light source for most projectors in the early period was limelight, which did not require an electricity supply.\n\nBetween approximately 1905 and 1915, two factors combined to transform the role of the projectionist into a separate job with a specific profile of skills and training. Concerns over the flammability of nitrate film, following several major fires during the cinema's first decade resulted in the increasing regulation of film exhibition, including the requirement that projectors be housed in fireproof booths, segregated from the auditorium. In the United Kingdom, for example, this requirement was introduced in the Cinematograph Act 1909, and effectively prevented the projectionist from also carrying out a public-facing role. The legal right to act as a projectionist in a public movie theater was, and to some extent still is, regulated, to varying degrees in different jurisdictions. Some required projectionists to be licensed by local or central government, and this process sometimes required projectionists to undergo assessments or sit exams. Trade union-based regulation of the profession was also widespread in some jurisdictions, in which the licensing of projectionists was incorporated into collective bargaining agreements between employers and unions. In the United States, projectionists were sometimes 'pooled out' to theatre companies via their union. Closed shop working by projectionists was common in British cinema chains until the early 1980s. The original reason for this regulation was the necessity for safety precautions for the screening of nitrate prints, and hence the requirement that projectionists should be formally trained to handle them to ensure public safety. But the formal training and licensing of projectionists continued in most of the US and Europe well after nitrate had been superseded in the 1950s, and in a minority of jurisdictions it still continues.\n\nWith the advent of feature-length films during the early to mid-teens and the increasing tendency for film screenings to be the main or only event that took place in a purpose-built theater, rather than incorporated into other forms of live entertainment, the role of the projectionist became more specialised and began to incorporate elements of showmanship once again. The safety precautions associated with nitrate required 35mm film prints to be shipped in reels no longer than 1,000 feet (approximately 15 minutes at 16fps). In order show a feature-length film without interruption while the following reel is laced up, two projectors focused on the same screen were used, with the projectionist 'changing over' from one to the other at the end of each reel. 2,000 foot 'double' reels were gradually introduced from the early 1930s onwards (approximately 20 minutes at the standardized sound speed of 24fps). Until the conversion to sound, electric motors were relatively uncommon on 35mm theater projectors: most were hand-cranked by the projectionist. Contemporary accounts suggest that hand cranking at a consistent speed took a considerable amount of skill. Presentation technique also began to include tasks such as operating auditorium lighting systems [dimmers], curtains [side-tabs] and masking systems and lantern slide projectors. During the 1920s, movie theaters became larger and projection equipment had to adapt to this. Limelight illumination was replaced by the electrically powered carbon arc lamp, and with the arrival of sound electric motors were installed to drive projectors (a more constant speed was required for sound playback than could be achieved by hand cranking). The operation and basic maintenance of audio equipment also became part of the projectionist's job following the introduction of sound.\n\nThe technology of cinema projection, and with it the role of the projectionist, changed fundamentally over an extended period between the early 1950s and late 1960s. Nitrate film was superseded by cellulose triacetate for release prints in the US and Europe over about a five-year period following the stock's commercial launch in October 1948 (though older nitrate prints remained in circulation for quite a long time afterwards and are still occasionally utilized in licensed cinemas for special screenings). With nitrate went the restrictions on reel lengths previously necessitated by the fire risk, with the result that systems were developed to enable the projection of a complete feature film using a single projector and unattended. Two essential technologies were needed to enable this: the long-play device, a.k.a. platter, i.e. a turntable 4–6 feet in diameter or (in the case of Sword Systems and Sabre Systems by EPRAD) an extremely large film reel 3–5 feet in diameter either of which enabled the reels of a feature presentation to be joined together into a single roll, in some cases up to 30,000 feet (approx. six hours at 24fps) in length; and the xenon arc lamp, which can burn continuously and unattended for as long as is needed (most carbon arc lamphouses will run for a maximum of 40–50 minutes before the carbon rod needs replacing, and require regular adjustment by the projectionist during that time). Automation systems were also introduced, which could be programmed in advance of each screening to perform functions such as operating auditorium lighting, adjusting volume levels and changing audio formats. Some would argue that these technologies reduced the skill level or downgraded the showmanship element of the projectionist's job (for example, by eliminating the need for changeovers and nitrate handling precautions). Others would argue that more advanced skills were needed in other areas. With the introduction of widescreen in the early 1950s, projectionists had to cope with the additional lenses, aperture plates and masking systems needed for different aspect ratios for the first time. Multiple channel audio systems using magnetic sound and 70mm film prints were also introduced in the 1950s, and these required specialist projection skills to handle. Like nitrate film prints, xenon arc bulbs require special safety precautions: if handled incorrectly they can explode, causing serious injury to the projectionist. Staffing levels in projection booths decreased rapidly during this period. In the classical \"movie palace\", the labour-intensive nature of changeovers, carbon arc lamps and nitrate handling required large workforces of projectionists, with up to six or seven working in a single booth and a rigid management hierarchy within the profession being common. In contrast, the multiplexes of the 1980s and '90s were designed in such a way that a single projectionist can operate simultaneous screenings in 10-20 auditoria, and it is unusual for these venues to have a total projectionist workforce of more than three or four.\n\nThe job description of the projectionist began to vary considerably according to the type and location of theatre he or she worked in. In many of the multiplex theatre chains that emerged in the 1980s, the role of the projectionist was largely confined to assembling screening programs (consisting of a feature film print and other supporting material such as advertisements and trailers) onto a long-play platter or tower device, programming automation systems and very basic equipment maintenance such as cleaning film path components and the routine replacement of life-limited parts. More extensive maintenance and repairs are carried out by technicians employed centrally by the parent company and who visit its theatres to conduct maintenance on a regular cycle. In smaller chains and independent theaters, and especially those situated in geographically remote locations, projectionists are more likely to undertake more extensive maintenance and repair duties, both on a theater's projection and sound equipment and on other infrastructure in the building, e.g. heating and air conditioning plant. 35mm release prints continue to be shipped on 2,000 foot reels to the present day, even though very few theaters still present films using a two-projector system with changeovers. A number of attempts have been made over the years to introduce larger shipping reels for print distribution, but none has gained widespread acceptance.\n\nSome larger theater chains are now in the process of eliminating the projectionist's job altogether. In order to avoid paying a higher wage rate and to circumvent skilled labor laws, some companies (such as Cinemark Theaters) use the job title \"Booth Usher\" for an employee who simply carries out basic screening operations and does not perform any program assembly, maintenance or repair procedures. Their starting wage is the same as that for popcorn concessionists and ushers ($7.84 per hour in Ohio as of August 2009). Smaller theaters in this chain and those with union bargaining contracts that specify a minimum wage utilize management for these duties. In Britain, this started to happen early 2000 onward as labour laws were wiped out by then.\n\nThe introduction of digital cinema projection, on a significant scale from approximately 2006 to 2008, is rapidly bringing to an end the role of the projectionist as a professionally skilled operator of film-based projection equipment in mainstream theatres. As of November 2010, the major chains in the US and Europe are in the process of a large-scale conversion to digital projection, in some ways comparable to the mass installation of sound equipment in the late 1920s and early 1930s. This has essentially been made possible by the virtual print fee model of financing the equipment and installation costs, in which studios and equipment manufacturers provide equipment to theatres on a hire-purchase basis. The basic operation of digital cinema servers and projectors requires little more than routine IT skills and can be performed by a theatre's front-of-house and managerial staff with minimal extra training. Within a few years, it is likely that projectionists, in the traditional sense of the word, will only be found in the small number of arthouse, cinematheque and repertory theatres that will continue to show film prints from archival collections. In May 2013, the BBC reported that by October 2013, \"there will be no cinemas left in this country projecting 35mm\".\n\nA projectionist in a modern theater in North America or Europe will typically carry out some or all of the following duties.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

O'Connor went on to score a further seven goals that season, including goals in five consecutive games between March and April.\n\nFollowing two seasons in which he struggled to fulfil his early promise, the arrival of manager Tony Mowbray at Hibs in May 2004 led to improved form for both O'Connor and the team as a whole, as Hibs finished third in the 2004–05 Scottish Premier League. O'Connor formed a formidable partnership with Derek Riordan, and between them they scored 42 goals that season, as Hibs earned qualification for the UEFA Cup.\n\nOn 26 February 2006, it was reported that O'Connor was set to join Lokomotiv Moscow for approximately £1.6 million. This offer was subsequently accepted by Hibernian, with Tony Mowbray conceding that the personal terms on offer, a reported weekly wage of £16,000, were \"life-changing for Garry and his family\". On 6 March, it was announced that the transfer had been agreed. O'Connor scored a total of 58 goals for Hibs in all competitions and scored in his final Hibs appearance, against Falkirk in the Scottish Cup.\n\nOn 22 March 2006, O'Connor scored for the first time for Lokomotiv Moscow, the opening goal in a 2–2 draw with Spartak Moscow in a Russian Cup tie. He opened the scoring for his side against Torpedo Moscow in a 4–1 win on 14 May. In the 2006 season, he scored seven league goals and a cup goal in the 29 matches he played in (although only on the field for the full 90 minutes in five matches – he averaged 58 minutes of playing time per match), and was yellow-carded once. In Moscow he formed a partnership with Russian international Dmitry Sychev, although Dramane Traoré, the Mali international, threatened his position.\n\nOn 27 May 2007, O'Connor came off the bench to score the winning goal for Lokomotiv Moscow in the 2007 Russian Cup Final against city rivals FC Moscow. The extra-time goal, coming in the 109th minute, was enough to seal a 1–0 victory for the railway team, and provided a measure of redemption for O'Connor, who struggled to settle in Russia for family reasons.\n\nO'Connor completed a £2.7 million move to Birmingham City on 28 June 2007, and scored his first goal for the club on his first appearance, on 15 August 2007 against Sunderland in a 2–2 draw. However, he lost his place, and manager Alex McLeish told him he needed to get fitter to return to the starting eleven. He had to wait until January 2008 for his second league goal, an equaliser against Arsenal. He missed several games in early 2008 through illness, and McLeish told him to \"write the season off and come back this season all guns blazing\".\n\nO'Connor worked with a fitness coach over the summer, lost weight, and returned to training with a positive attitude towards the coming season and towards his manager. He had a successful pre-season and started well in the Championship with an assist for Kevin Phillips followed by scoring three goals in three games, but then sustained a groin injury. Returning to the team a month later, he produced some good performances and scored three more goals in two games, prompting his inclusion in the Championship Team of the Week, before again injuring his groin, this time in the pre-match warm-up at Queens Park Rangers on 29 October 2008, a match which Birmingham went on to lose. He returned to first team action against Doncaster on 14 March 2009. O'Connor's goal for 10-man Birmingham which confirmed their 2–0 win over Championship leaders Wolverhampton Wanderers was voted as the club's Moment of the Season.\n\nO'Connor missed most of the 2009–10 season due to undergoing two operations on a hip injury. McLeish suggested that the injury dated back to O'Connor's time with Hibernian and had been aggravated by playing on synthetic pitches in Russia while he was with Lokomotiv Moscow. A Channel 4 documentary \"Dispatches\", aired in September 2011, claimed that O'Connor had been sidelined due to failing a drugs test. O'Connor's contract had been due to expire at the end of the 2009–10 season, but the club extended it until the end of 2010 in order for O'Connor to prove his fitness.\n\nTo regain match fitness, O'Connor signed on loan for Championship club Barnsley on 10 September 2010 for one month. He scored a goal on his debut in a 5–2 win against Leeds United. Although Birmingham were happy for the player to remain at Barnsley, whose manager wanted to extend the loan, budgetary considerations made it impossible. Though O'Connor returned to Birmingham's first team, Cameron Jerome's recovery from injury left the player again looking for regular football, so in November he rejoined Barnsley for another month. His 89th-minute winning goal at Preston North End on his second Barnsley debut secured the club's first away win since February. O'Connor then scored the third Barnsley goal in a 3–1 win at Ipswich Town. O'Connor then signed on a permanent basis with Barnsley, from 1 January 2011 until the end of the 2010–11 season. He scored only once in 13 appearances, and his contract was cancelled by mutual consent in April 2011.\n\nO'Connor re-signed for Hibernian on a one-year contract on 15 June 2011. He scored his first goal in his second spell with the club in their second match of the 2011–12 season, a 92nd-minute winner away to Inverness. Hibs had never previously won at the Caledonian Stadium. O'Connor made an excellent start to the season, scoring 10 goals in his first 11 appearances. This form meant that O'Connor was the subject of transfer speculation in January 2012, but injuries restricted his appearances. O'Connor was rested for some matches and given additional training to improve his level of fitness. He responded by scoring a goal in three consecutive matches, which helped to earn four league points and a place in the 2012 Scottish Cup Final. Hibs retained their place in the SPL, but then lost to Hearts in the Scottish Cup Final. O'Connor's contract with Hibs expired on 1 June 2012; on the same day, he was found guilty on charges of possessing cocaine and obstructing a police officer.\n\nO'Connor returned to Russian football in July 2012, when he signed a two-year contract with FC Tom Tomsk. He was initially unable to play for the club, which was subject to a player registration ban. O'Connor made his debut appearance for the club on 6 August, but was sent off after 65 minutes in the match against Baltika Kaliningrad. He was released from his contract in December 2012, having made just six appearances, scoring one goal.\n\nO'Connor returned to Scottish football on 6 January 2014, agreeing a contract with Greenock Morton until the end of the 2013–14 season. He left Morton at the end of the season, having scored only one goal as they were relegated to League One. O'Connor signed a one-year contract with Lowland League club Selkirk on 1 August 2014. He scored 18 Lowland League goals in the 2014–15 season, 21 in all competitions; he then re-signed with Selkirk for the 2015–16 season.\n\nScotland national team manager Berti Vogts gave O'Connor his international début, against South Korea in May 2002. O'Connor was then relegated to the Scotland under-21 squad for a few seasons as he struggled to find his best form. O'Connor's improved form in the 2004–05 season earned him a recall to the full squad, and he scored his first Scotland goal in a 2–2 draw with Austria in August 2005.\n\nAfter featuring in the 1–0 victory against France at Hampden Park on 7 October 2006, O'Connor and the rest of the team were given an evening off before reconvening ahead of the trip to Ukraine for another qualifying match. O'Connor failed to rejoin the squad and was axed from the travelling party by manager Walter Smith. O'Connor subsequently issued an apology through his agent without revealing the exact cause of his failure to appear, while assistant manager Tommy Burns announced that O'Connor was unlikely to be frozen out of the squad permanently. O'Connor said that his wife was unhappy with life in Moscow and he had decided to stay with her rather than return to training.\n\nHe was recalled to the Scotland squad in May 2007 under new manager, and his former boss at Hibs, Alex McLeish. O'Connor was initially drafted in due to squad call-offs but was given a place in the starting line-up for the friendly match with Austria. O'Connor scored the only goal of the game as Scotland won 1–0.\nThis was followed up seven days later with a goal in the 2–0 UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying victory over the Faroe Islands. O'Connor was then left out of the Scotland squad for almost two years after appearing against the Ukraine in October 2007, but was recalled for the matches in September 2009 against Macedonia and the Netherlands after Kevin Kyle withdrew from the squad due to injury.\n\nOn 28 October 2015, O'Connor was appointed as Selkirk caretaker manager following the sacking of Steve Forrest, a role he continued until the appointment of Ian Fergus.\n\nLokomotiv Moscow\nBirmingham City\n"}

{"id": "1841430", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1841430", "title": "Narrative film", "text": "Narrative film\n\nNarrative film, fictional film or fiction film is a film that tells a fictional or fictionalized story, event or narrative. In this style of film, believable narratives and characters help convince the audience that the unfolding fiction is real. Lighting and camera movement, among other cinematic elements, have become increasingly important in these films. Great detail goes into the screenplays of narratives, as these films rarely deviate from the predetermined behaviours and lines of the classical style of screenplay writing to maintain a sense of realism. Actors must deliver dialogue and action in a believable way, so as to persuade the audience that the film is real life.\n\nProbably the first fictional film ever made was the Lumière's \"L'Arroseur arrosé\", which was first screened at the Grand Café Capucines on December 28, 1895. A year later in 1896, Alice Guy-Blaché directed the fictional film \"La fee aux choux\". Perhaps the best known of early fictional films is Georges Méliès’s \"A Trip to the Moon\" from 1902. Most films previous to this had been merely moving images of everyday occurrences, such as \"L'Arrivée d'un train en gare de La Ciotat\" by Auguste and Louis Lumière. Méliès was one of the first directors to progress cinematic technology, which paved the way for narratives as style of film. Narrative films have come so far since their introduction that film genres such as comedy or Western films, were, and continue to be introduced as a way to further categorize these films.\n\nNarrative cinema is usually contrasted to films that present information, such as a nature documentary, as well as to some experimental films (works such as \"Wavelength\" by Michael Snow, \"Man with a Movie Camera\" by Dziga Vertov, or films by Chantal Akerman). In some instances pure documentary films, while nonfiction, may nonetheless recount a story. As genres evolve, from fiction film and documentary a one emerged, docufiction.\n\nMany films are based on real occurrences, however these too fall under the category of a “narrative film” rather than a documentary. This is because films based on real occurrences are not simply footage of the occurrence, but rather hired actors portraying an adjusted, often more dramatic, retelling of the occurrence (such as \"21\" by Robert Luketic).\n\nUnlike literary fiction, which is typically based on characters, situations and events that are entirely imaginary/fictional/hypothetical, cinema always has a real referent, called the \"pro-filmic\", which encompasses everything existing and done in front of the camera.\n\nSince the emergence of classical Hollywood style in the early 20th century, during which films were selected to be made based on the popularity of the genre, stars, producers, and directors involved, narrative, usually in the form of the feature film, has held dominance in commercial cinema and has become popularly synonymous with \"the movies.\" Classical, invisible filmmaking (what is often called realist fiction) is central to this popular definition. This key element of this invisible filmmaking lies in continuity editing.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1841463", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1841463", "title": "Gent–Wevelgem", "text": "Gent–Wevelgem\n\nGent–Wevelgem, officially Gent–Wevelgem – In Flanders Fields, is a road cycling race in Belgium, held annually since 1934. It one of the classic races part of the Flemish Cycling Week, run in late March on the last Sunday before the Tour of Flanders.\n\nAlthough the event is often called a \"sprinters classic\" due to its flat finishing terrain, its early-season date means riders are often tested by wind and rain, as well as several climbs, including two ascents of the steep and fully cobbled Kemmelberg. As a result, few editions of Gent–Wevelgem actually end in a bunch sprint – often the winner comes from a small group of escapees.\n\nIn 2005 the race was included in the inaugural UCI ProTour and in 2011 in its successor, the UCI World Tour. Since 2011 it is organized by Flanders Classics, which also organizes the Tour of Flanders. Since 2012 a woman's event is held on the same day as the men's race.\n\nSix riders share the record of victories. Belgians Robert Van Eenaeme, Rik Van Looy, Eddy Merckx and Tom Boonen, Italian Mario Cipollini and Slovak Peter Sagan each won the race three times. Sagan also achieved a record six podium finishes in the race.\n\nCreated in 1934 and originally run by the newspaper Gazet van Antwerpen, the race’s finish town of Wevelgem was selected because it was the home town of the event’s first owner, local textile manufacturer Georges Matthijs. Its origin is a tribute to Gaston Rebry, a native of Wevelgem, who was one of the stars of cycling in Belgium in the 1930s.\n\nThe first edition was run on 9 September 1934 as an amateur race on a flat, 120 km route. The race only had Belgian participants and was won by Gustave Van Belle. In 1936 the race distance was increased to 168 km and Robert Van Eenaeme was the first professional winner.\n\nThe event had its only interruptions during World War II, and was subsequently organized again as a professional event in 1945. Gaston Rebry, by then president of bike club \"Het Vliegend Wiel\", was the new race director. Robert Van Eenaeme was declared winner of the first post-War edition, surprisingly ten days after the race was over, after officials had closer inspected the photo finish.\n\nIn 1947 Gent–Wevelgem was granted a springtime date on the calendar and gained prestige. Organizer Rebry managed to line up Italian cycling icons Gino Bartali and Fausto Coppi, who attracted vast numbers of spectators to the race.\n\nIn 1957 the race became part of the short-lived \"Trophy of Flanders\", a two-day formula with the Omloop Het Volk, in which Gent–Wevelgem was raced on Saturday, the Omloop on Sunday. In the 1960s the race garnered international prestige. Belgian cycling legends Rik Van Looy and Eddy Merckx won the race three times; Tour de France winner Jacques Anquetil was the first French winner in 1964.\n\nThe race was in a constant search of identity and re-invention, as reflected in the regular route and calendar changes. In 1977 the distance was 277 km, the longest edition ever, featuring eleven climbs in the Flemish Ardennes and a double ascent of the Kemmelberg. The arduous edition was won by Bernard Hinault, claiming his first international success.\n\nSince the 1980s the race has built a reputation as a sprinters' classic. Italian sprint star Mario Cipollini claimed three victories. Sean Kelly, Guido Bontempi, Djamolidine Abdoujaparov and Tom Steels are some of the other sprint specialists on the roll of honour.\n\nIn 2003, Gent–Wevelgem abandoned its original start location Ghent and moved to suburban Deinze. Tom Boonen claimed his first classic victory in 2004, later proceeding to equal the winning record of three wins. For many decades, the race held a mid-week position between the Tour of Flanders and Paris–Roubaix. In 2011, the race was included in the UCI World Tour and returned to a Sunday date in the weekend between Milan–San Remo and the Tour of Flanders.\n\nSince 2015, the event is named \"Gent–Wevelgem – In Flanders Fields\", after the iconic war poem by John McCrae. Organizers wanted to commemorate the 100th anniversary of World War I, as the Westhoek region was at the heart of the war and is home to several Commonwealth war graves. The 2015 edition was won by Luca Paolini, but was particularly memorable as it was run in abysmal weather, with strong winds scourging the peloton. Several riders were blown violently off their bikes, including Geraint Thomas when he was leading the breakaway group, prompting media to describe the race as \"mayhem\" and \"one of the wildest bike races in recent years\". Only 39 riders finished the race.\n\nThe 2016 edition was marred by the death of Belgian rider Antoine Demoitié, suffering fatal injuries from a crash and collision with a motor bike. Peter Sagan won the 2018 event, marking Sagan's third Gent–Wevelgem title and sixth podium finish, thereby becoming the most successful rider in the race's history.\n\nUnlike most of the Flemish spring classics, which centre around Oudenaarde and the plentiful hills in the Flemish Ardennes, Gent–Wevelgem travels west into West Flanders and Northern France and has fewer hills, providing it with a different character and making it more suitable for sprinters. In recent years the total distance of the race was around 250 km.\n\nSince 2004, the race starts in Deinze, East-Flanders, southwest of Ghent. After the unofficial start on the city's Market Square, the route heads west, facing 100 kilometres through the wind-swept flatlands of West Flanders, up to and along the North Sea coast before turning south into the North department of France. After 120 km comes the cobbled Kasselberg climb in Cassel, which is addressed twice in quick succession. After the Katsberg, the second hill in France, the race re-enters Belgium after on French roads, to enter the key section of the race in Heuvelland.\n\nThe hill zone in the very south of West-Flanders holds three climbs, the Baneberg, Monteberg and Kemmelberg, covered within twelve kilometres of one another. This succession of climbs is interspersed with technical descents along narrow country roads, including the difficult descent of the Kemmelberg. The Kemmelberg is the hardest and most iconic climb of the race.\n\nAfter these three \"bergs\", the course loops round and riders re-ascend the Baneberg–Monteberg-Kemmelberg sequence, covering a total of nine categorized climbs. After the top of the ultimate climb of the Kemmelberg, some from the finish, the course invariably ensues on a long and flat run-in to Wevelgem. The finish is on the Vanackerestraat, Wevelgem's central avenue.\n\nThe essential ingredients of Gent–Wevelgem have remained the same for decades. First to take their toll on the peloton, in the opening 100 kilometres, are the crosswinds and often rainy weather on exposed, flat roads across Flanders’ largest open plain. As teams try to protect and position their captains in the early stages of the race, splits and echelons at this point frequently see 40 to 60 riders eliminated from the running.\nSubsequently, after hours of pounding across the Flanders flatlands and the occasional excursion to Northern France, the riders approach the hill zone in Heuvelland, which features the day's most difficult ascents. The hills are at the heart of the action and usually the sites where breakaways are formed. The race's most renowned climb is the Kemmelberg, a fully cobbled hill road in Kemmel with gradients up to 23%, but equally notorious for its difficult and technical descent.\n\nThe Kemmelberg, the highest point in the region, is the toughest climb and the emotional centrepiece of the race. Named after Camulos, the Celtic god of war, the Kemmelberg’s summit lies atop a thickly wooded ridge which was the scene of the Battle of the Lys in April 1918, in which more than 200,000 soldiers died. The climb has been controversial in the past because of several severe crashes in its descent. In 2007 French rider Jimmy Casper crashed heavily, suffering numerous facial and other fractures. In 2016 the climb was addressed by its steepest road for the first time in more than 20 years.\n\nAfter the Kemmelberg, the ultimate battle between breakaways formed on the \"bergs\" and the chasing peloton unfolds on the 35-kilometre flat roads towards the finish. Despite its reputation as a sprinter's classic, Gent–Wevelgem’s breakaways frequently hold off their pursuers because of the unpredictable terrain.\n\nAlthough media usually classify Gent–Wevelgem as a cobbled classic, the route actually has very few sections of cobbled roads. Only the Kemmelberg and the upper stretches of the Kasselberg are cobbled, totaling a possible maximum of two kilometres of cobbled section, which is significantly less than the other cobbled races of Flanders and Northern France. Moreover, there are no flat sections of \"pavé\" and both cobbled climbs are in excellent condition, as they are part of a busy suburban traffic network.\n\nThe first race was in 1934 on an all-flat route from Ghent's St Pieter's Station to Wevelgem. The second edition in 1935 addressed the Flemish Ardennes in East Flanders and included the climbs of Kwaremont, Kluisberg and Tiegemberg. From 1936 to 1939 the race ran from Ghent to Kortrijk, followed by local laps, including the Lauwberg as the main difficulty.\nAfter World War II, Gent–Wevelgem restyled with a new route across the Flemish Ardennes and the Heuvelland region. The Edelareberg, Hoppeberg, Kwaremont, Zwarteberg and Rodeberg featured along the way. In 1947 and 1948 the course looped up to and along the North Sea coast for the first time.\n\nFrom 1949 to 1954 the Flemish Ardennes returned, followed by the Heuvelland hills of Rodeberg and Vidaigneberg. In 1955 the Kluisberg and Kemmelberg made their first appearance. The road on the Kemmelberg was still unpaved. In 1956 the Eikenberg was included.\nIn 1957, as Gent–Wevelgem was part of the \"Trophy of Flanders\", organizers introduced climbs in French Flanders: Zwarteberg, Mont Cassel, Katsberg and Wouwenberg preceded the Kemmelberg. In 1958, these Franco-Flemish climbs were not included: the pre-Schengen border crossing caused too many administrative burdens. After the run-up to the coast, the route featured only the Rodeberg, Vidaigneberg and Kemmelberg climbs in Heuvelland.\n\nIn 1960 scheduling conflicts marked the end of the Trophy of Flanders and the race placed itself on the calendar between the more prestigious classics the Tour of Flanders and Paris-Roubaix. In 1961 Gent–Wevelgem implemented a two-day course, a one-year novelty. The race ran from Ghent to Antwerp on the first day and to Wevelgem on the second.\n\nFrom 1962 to 1976 Gent–Wevelgem ran via the coast to Heuvelland, with the Rodeberg, Vidaigneberg and Kemmelberg as fixed venues, sometimes supplemented with Monteberg, Baneberg, Sulferberg, Goeberg, Suikerberg (\"Sugar Hill\"), Kraaiberg and Scherpenberg.\n\nIn 1977, the hills of the Flemish Ardennes were addressed for the last time to date, featuring eleven significant climbs, including Koppenberg, Edelareberg, Kattenberg, Varent, Kluisberg and Tiegemberg. In 1993, the Franco-Flemish hills made their re-appearance but were omitted again in 1996.\nIn 2008, the route was substantially modified, following the race's status as a UCI Pro Tour event. The distance was increased from ca. 200 km to 235 km. The course no longer ran along long coastal stretches, but instead approached Veurne from the polders. More climbs in Heuvelland were inserted: Zwarteberg, Baneberg, Rodeberg, Vidaigneberg and Monteberg preceded the double ascent of the Kemmelberg. As a consequence of the heavy crashes of the 2007 race, the Kemmelberg was approached from the village of Kemmel, in order to avoid the dangerous cobbled descent and potential new crashes.\n\nIn 2010 the Franco-Flemish hills of Kasselberg, Scherpenberg, Katsberg, and Berthen were re-introduced, before ensuing the traditional route in the Heuvelland hills. In recent years the city of Ypres features prominently in the race finale. In the context of the Centenary of the outbreak of World War I, the peloton crosses the city centre and leaves it passing under the iconic Menin Gate, arguably the most famous \"Flanders Fields\" memorial, before proceeding on the final run-in to the finish in Wevelgem.\n\nThe 2017 race saw the addition of three so-called \"Plugstreets\" in Ploegsteert Wood, semi-paved gravel roads at the Ploegsteert Memorial to the Missing, to commemorate the Christmas truce of 1914. The three \"Plugstreets\" were integrated between the two Kemmel climbs, with a total distance of .\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic led to the cancellation of that year's edition: other than during the second world war, this is the only time that the race has failed to be held.\n\n\"Riders in italics are still active\"\n\nSince 2012 a women's race of Gent–Wevelgem is held, on the same day as the men's event but over a shorter course of 120 km. Unlike the men's race, the start is in Ypres and the course does not cover the hills in Northern France. The inaugural women's edition was won by British rider Lizzie Armitstead after a 40-km solo breakaway. Since 2016 the race is included in the UCI Women's World Tour, cycling's top-tier female elite competition.\n\nSince 2009, a cyclosportive is organized on the day before the professional event. There are four distances, ranging from 60 km to 215 km. All courses start and finish in Wevelgem, at the finishing location of the professional event. Most routes pass through the Menin Gate in Ypres, flirt with the French border, tackle the Kemmelberg before turning back towards Wevelgem. There are 5.000 participants on average; 40% of which are non-Belgians.\n"}

He played the roving investigator Jim Hardie in the television series \"Tales of Wells Fargo\" and Ben Calhoun, the owner of an incomplete railroad line in \"Iron Horse\". He often was presented as a deceptively thoughtful but modest Western hero. From 1968 to 1970, Robertson was the fourth and final host of the anthology series \"Death Valley Days\".\n\nBorn in 1923 to Melvin and Vervel Robertson in Harrah, Oklahoma, Robertson fought as a professional boxer while enrolled in the Oklahoma Military Academy in Claremore.\n\nDuring this time Columbia Pictures offered Robertson the lead in their film version of \"Golden Boy\" but Robertson turned down the trip to Hollywood for a screen test as he didn't want to leave the ponies he was training or his home.\n\nDuring World War II, he was commissioned through Officer Candidate School, and served in the United States Army 322nd Combat Engineer Battalion of the 97th Infantry Division in Europe. He was wounded twice and was awarded the Bronze and Silver Star medals.\n\nRobertson began his acting career by chance when he was in the United States Army. Stationed at San Luis Obispo, California, Robertson decided to have a photograph taken for his mother; so he and several other soldiers went to Hollywood to find a photographer. A large copy of his photo was later displayed in the photographer's shop window. He found himself receiving letters from film agents who wished to represent him. After the war, Robertson's war wounds prevented him from resuming his boxing career. He stayed in California to try his hand at acting. Hollywood actor Will Rogers, Jr., gave him this advice: \"Don't ever take a dramatic lesson. They will try to put your voice in a dinner jacket, and people like their hominy and grits in everyday clothes.\" Robertson thereafter avoided formal acting lessons.\n\nRobertson made his film debut in an uncredited role as a policeman in \"The Boy with Green Hair\" (1948). Two other uncredited appearances led to featured roles in two Randolph Scott Westerns \"Fighting Man of the Plains\" (1949) where he played Jesse James, and \"The Cariboo Trail\" (1950). Popular acclaim to Robertson's brief roles led him to be signed to a seven-year contract to 20th Century Fox. Robertson's first role for Fox was a support part in a Western \"Two Flags West\" (1951). He had a support part in the musical \"Call Me Mister\" (1951). He soon advanced to leading roles in films such as \"Take Care of My Little Girl\" (1951), where he played Jeanne Crain's love interest, and \"Golden Girl\" (1951), where he supported Mitzi Gaynor.\n\nFox gave Robertson top billing in \"Return of the Texan\" (1952). He appeared opposite Anne Baxter in \"The Outcasts of Poker Flat\" (1952), and starred in the historical adventure \"Lydia Bailey\" (1952).\n\nRobertson was never very cooperative with the press, even shunning the powerful columnist Louella Parsons. As a result, he won the press' Sour Apple Award for three years running. But then, commented Robertson, \"that dang Sinatra had to hit some photographer in the nose and stop me from getting my fourth.\"\n\nHe was one of several Fox names in \"O. Henry's Full House\" (1952) and was Betty Grable's love interest in \"The Farmer Takes a Wife\" (1953).\n\nRKO borrowed him for \"Devil's Canyon\" (1953) with Virginia Mayo and \"Son of Sinbad\", filmed in 1953 but not released for two more years.\n\nHe returned to Fox for \"City of Bad Men\" (1953) with Crain; \"The Silver Whip\" (1954) with Rory Calhoun; and \"The Gambler from Natchez\" (1954).\n\nRobertson went over to United Artists to star in \"Sitting Bull\" (1954), and \"Top of the World\" (1955), an adventure film.\n\nRobertson did \"A Day of Fury\" (1956) for Universal and \"Dakota Incident\" (1956) for Republic, then travelled to Britain for \"High Terrace\" (1956).\n\nDescribed by \"TIME\" in 1959 as \"probably the best horseman on television\", for most of his career, Robertson played in western films and television shows—well over 60 titles in all. \"Tales of Wells Fargo\", his best-remembered series, aired on NBC from 1957 to 1961, when it moved to ABC and expanded to an hour-long program for its final season in 1961-1962. The show originally was produced by Nat Holt whom Robertson felt he owed his career to for giving him his first leading roles. Robertson also did the narration for \"Tales of Wells Fargo\" through which he often presented his own commentary on matters of law, morality, and common sense. He was unique among his television contemporaries, stating that he hated the gun he was forced to carry, but saw it as a necessary evil, a \"tool of the trade\", and kept practicing. In its cover story on television westerns, published March 30, 1959, \"Time\" reported Robertson was 6 feet tall, weighed 180 pounds, and measured 42-34-34. He sometimes made use of his physique in \"beefcake\" scenes, such as one in 1952's \"Return of the Texan\" where he is seen bare-chested and sweaty, repairing a fence.\n\nIn 1960, Robertson guest-starred as himself in NBC's \"The Ford Show,\" starring Tennessee Ernie Ford. In 1962, he similarly appeared and sang a perfect rendition of \"High Noon\" on the short-lived western comedy and variety series \"The Roy Rogers and Dale Evans Show.\" In 1963, after \"Tales of Wells Fargo\" ended its five-year run, he played the lead role in the first of A.C. Lyles' \"Law of the Lawless.\" \n\nRobertson created United Screen Arts in 1965 which released two of his films, \"The Man from Button Willow\" (1965, animated) and \"The One Eyed Soldiers\" (1966). Robertson filmed a television pilot about Diamond Jim Brady that was not picked up as a series.\n\nIn the 1966–67 season, Robertson starred in \"Scalplock\" another television pilot released as a movie that became \"The Iron Horse,\" in which his character wins an incomplete railroad line in a poker game and then decides to manage the company. In 1968, he succeeded Robert Taylor as the host of \"Death Valley Days,\" a role formerly held by Stanley Andrews and future U.S. President Ronald W. Reagan. In rebroadcasts, \"Death Valley Days\" is often known as \"Trails West,\" with Ray Milland in the role of revised host.\n\nRobertson guest-starred on the Nov. 17, 1969 episode of \"The Dean Martin Show\".\n\nHe portrayed legendary FBI agent Melvin Purvis in two made-for-television movies \"\" (1974) and \"The Kansas City Massacre\" (1975).\n\nIn 1981, Robertson was in the original starring cast of \"Dynasty\", playing Walter Lankershim, a character who disappeared after the first season.\n\nIn 1983, Robertson made \"Big John\", another television pilot, where he played a Georgia Sheriff who becomes a New York Police Department detective. In 1987, he starred as the title character on \"J.J. Starbuck.\" Robertson also played Frank Crutcher in five episodes of the TV series \"Dallas\" during the 1982-83 season. In December 1993 and January 1994, Robertson appeared in two episodes of \"Harts of the West\" in the role of Zeke Terrell. During an appearance on \"The Tonight Show,\" Robertson said he was of Cherokee ancestry. He joked, \"I am the tribe's West Coast distributor.\"\n\nRobertson played a central part in two episodes of \"Murder, She Wrote\" with Angela Lansbury but he was not credited in either appearance.\n\nHe received the Golden Boot Award in 1985, has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and is also in the Hall of Great Western Performers and the National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum in Oklahoma City.\n\nIn 1999, Robertson won the award for film and television from the American Cowboy Culture Association in Lubbock, Texas.\n\nIn the last few years before his death, Robertson hosted a radio program called \"Little Known Facts,\" which was broadcast on 400 radio stations.\n\nIn his later years, Robertson and his wife, the former Susan Robbins, whom he married in 1980, had lived on his ranch in Yukon, Oklahoma, where it was reported he owned 235 horses at one time, with 5 mares foaling grand champions. He died at Scripps Memorial Hospital in La Jolla, California on February 27, 2013, from lung cancer and pneumonia.\n\n"}

{"id": "1841486", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1841486", "title": "Bob Probert", "text": "Bob Probert\n\nRobert Alan Probert (June 5, 1965 – July 5, 2010) was a Canadian professional ice hockey forward. Probert played for the National Hockey League's Detroit Red Wings and Chicago Blackhawks. While a successful player by some measures, including being voted to the 1987–88 Campbell Conference all-star team, Probert was best known for his activities as a fighter and enforcer, as well as being one half of the \"Bruise Brothers\" with then-Red Wing teammate Joey Kocur, during the late 1980s and early 1990s. Probert was also known for his off-ice antics and legal problems.\n\nPrior to playing with the Detroit Red Wings, Probert was with the Brantford Alexanders of the Ontario Hockey League. After being drafted, he spent one more season with the Alexanders before spending his 1984–85 season with both the Hamilton Steelhawks and the Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds of the OHL.\n\nProbert was drafted as the fourth pick in the third round (46th overall) in the 1983 NHL Entry Draft, in which the Red Wings also selected Kocur and Steve Yzerman.\n\nDuring the 1985–1986 and 1986–1987 seasons, Probert spent the majority of his time with the Red Wings while occasionally playing for their minor league affiliate Adirondack Red Wings of the American Hockey League. In the 1985–1986 season, he finished third on the team in penalty minutes behind Kocur and Randy Ladouceur, both of whom played more regular season games than Probert. In the 1986–1987 season, Probert accumulated only 24 points, but amassed 221 penalty minutes.\n\nThe 1987–1988 season was the pinnacle of Probert's career. He cemented his reputation as an enforcer with a league-leading 398 penalty minutes, the sixth-highest single-season total in NHL history. He also tied for third on the team with 62 points, and played in his only NHL All-Star Game. In addition he contributed the most points during the Red Wings' playoff run, in which Yzerman missed all but the final three games with a knee injury.\n\nProbert's career hit a snag in 1989 when he was arrested for cocaine possession while crossing the Detroit-Windsor border. U.S. Customs agents at the Detroit-Windsor Tunnel found 14 grams of cocaine hidden in Probert's underpants. He served three months in a federal prison in Minnesota, three more months in a halfway house, and was indefinitely suspended from the NHL. The NHL lifted the suspension at the conclusion of his prison term. Probert was initially ordered to be deported to Canada following his conviction, but he immediately filed for an appeal. The appeal process allowed him to resume his career with the Red Wings, but barred him from traveling with the team to Canada, as he would not be allowed to return to the United States. The matter was resolved on 7 December 1992, when the Immigration and Naturalization Service granted his appeal, restoring his travel privileges between the United States and Canada.\n\nWhen Probert returned to the Red Wings, he was temporarily one of the alternate captains of the team along with Gerard Gallant. While his penalty minutes remained high, he also averaged 40 points a season. During his last season with the Red Wings, he accumulated only 17 points for the team.\n\nAt this time, Probert once again got into trouble with the law. On 15 July 1994, he suffered minor injuries when he crashed his motorcycle into a car in West Bloomfield Township, Michigan. Police determined that his blood alcohol level was approximately triple the legal limit, and that there were also trace amounts of cocaine in his system. At the time of the accident, Probert had been ruled an unrestricted free agent. On July 19, the Red Wings announced that they would not offer him a contract. \"This is the end,\" said senior vice-president Jim Devellano. \"[In] my 12 years with the organization ... we've never spent more time on one player and his problems than we have on Probert.\"\n\nProbert signed with the Chicago Blackhawks on July 23, 1994, but was placed on inactive status by commissioner Gary Bettman in September 1994 while Probert entered rehab following his July 15 crash and subsequent drunk-driving charge. As a result, Probert sat out the lockout-shortened 1994-95 season before joining the Blackhawks.\n\nProbert's first season with the Blackhawks was the last in which he accumulated over 40 points in a season. From then on, his points and penalty minutes gradually decreased. While he never returned to the levels of point production he achieved with the Red Wings, he remained a physical force on the ice and continued many long-term rivalries with other enforcers.\n\nProbert also sustained various injuries during his time with the Blackhawks, most notably a torn rotator cuff injury which caused him to miss most of the 1997–98 season. One of the more noteworthy occurrences of his career with Chicago is that he scored the final NHL goal at the historic Maple Leaf Gardens on February 13, 1999.\n\nProbert often saw it as his job to protect his teammates, especially Detroit captain Steve Yzerman. In a 2007 news story, he recalled a time that he sucker-punched enforcer Kevin Maguire of the Buffalo Sabres (December 23, 1987) after Maguire attacked Yzerman. Maguire then unsuccessfully attempted to avoid Probert.\n\nSome significant tilts in Probert's career include:\n\nHe actively supported young hockey players in the community, and often bought tickets for kids who couldn't afford to go to Red Wings games. He encouraged a young fan in 1989 to pursue sobriety and challenged him to a contest in which he predicted he would surpass him. By August 18, 2011, that man had been sober for 23 years.\n\nAfter the 2001–2002 season, Probert was placed on waivers by the Blackhawks. Because he was not picked up by another team, he was advised that his role with the Blackhawks would be limited, or even relegated to playing in the minor leagues again. On November 16, 2002, Probert opted to \"unofficially\" retire so that he could join the Blackhawks radio broadcasting team. He had finished fourth on the NHL's all-time list with 3,300 penalty minutes.\n\nHis stint with the Blackhawks radio team did not last long. In February 2003, it was reported that Probert went back to rehab. During the 2003 offseason, Probert formally announced his retirement.\n\nProbert, along with former teammate Joe Kocur, is featured in a book entitled \"Bruise Brothers\" by Bob Duff .\n\nBefore his death, Probert had been working on a memoir with Kirstie McLellan Day, co-writer of Theo Fleury's bestselling autobiography \"Playing with Fire\". Probert's widow, Dani, decided to honour his wishes to tell his story and continue with completion of the book.\n\"Tough Guy: My Life on the Edge\" was published October 26, 2010, by HarperCollins Canada.\n\nProbert is the subject of Scoop Malinowski's 2019 book, \"Facing Bob Probert: Portrait of a Hockey Legend\", a collection of interviews of hockey figures about their memories of playing against Probert. Malinowski has also produced books about Facing Federer, Nadal, McEnroe, Sampras, Marat Safin, Serena Williams, Steffi Graf and Lleyton Hewitt.\n\nProbert routinely appeared in charity games, spoke at conventions, and conducted youth clinics. His activities as a Red Wings alumnus were somewhat limited by the fact that, due to his criminal history, he required an immigration waiver each time he wanted to cross the border.\n\nOn January 2, 2007, Probert appeared along with many other former Red Wings teammates to honor the retiring of Steve Yzerman's number 19 at Joe Louis Arena. He wore his number 24 Red Wings jersey, and helped former teammate Vladimir Konstantinov onto the ice for the ceremony. The Detroit crowd gave him a very warm welcome, which he later said he appreciated. He stayed on to watch the game with Joey Kocur behind the penalty box.\n\nThis was noted as a possible reconciliation with the Red Wings organization. Apparently it worked, as Probert became a late addition to a January 27, 2007, Red Wings alumni game against the Boston Bruins alumni at Joe Louis Arena. He scored a goal and two assists, though the Red Wings alumni lost the game 8–6.\n\nProbert recently worked on the Mike Myers 2008 film \"The Love Guru\", making a cameo as a hockey player. He commented on the irony of being given jersey number 28 to wear in the film — the same number worn by longtime rival Tie Domi.\n\nIn 2009, Probert participated in the Canadian figure skating reality television show \"Battle of the Blades\" which features figure skating pairs of male hockey players and female figure skaters competing against other pairs. Probert was partnered with Kristina Lenko.\n\nOn June 4, 2004, Probert was arrested for allegedly parking his BMW sport utility vehicle on the wrong side of the street and entering into an altercation over drugs with bystanders. Several police officers intervened and had to subdue Probert with taser and stun guns. He was later acquitted on all charges related to this incident.\n\nOn July 1, 2005, Probert was arrested at his Windsor-area (Lakeshore) home for breach of peace, resisting arrest, and assaulting a police officer. Probert's attorney, Patrick Ducharme, advised the media, \"I anticipate he will be pleading not guilty and going to trial.\" Probert was arrested again on August 23, 2005, at a bar in Tecumseh, Ontario, for violating two conditions of his bail conditions that he not consume alcohol or be in an establishment that serves liquor. He was released after paying $200 CAD bail. All charges stemming from the arrest on July 1 were eventually dropped.\n\nBob Probert died of a heart attack on July 5, 2010. During a severe heat wave, while boating on Lake St. Clair with his children, father-in-law, and mother-in-law when he developed what was described as \"severe chest pain\" and collapsed at approximately 2:00 pm local time. His step-father-in-law Dan Parkinson, the Cornwall, Ontario, chief of police, attempted CPR to save his life. He was rushed to Windsor Regional Hospital's Metropolitan Campus with no vital signs. Efforts to revive him were unsuccessful, and he was pronounced dead later that afternoon.\n\nFuneral services were held July 9, 2010, in Windsor, Ontario, and attended by several former teammates and opponents, including Dino Ciccarelli, Tie Domi, Chris Nilan, Gerard Gallant, Doug Gilmour, Stu Grimson, Joey Kocur, Brad McCrimmon, Darren McCarty and Steve Yzerman, as well as Red Wings general manager Ken Holland and owners Mike and Marian Ilitch. Yzerman delivered the eulogy. In recognition of Probert's love of motorcycle riding, his funeral procession was led by a group of 54 motorcyclists, and his casket was transported on a custom-built motorcycle sidecar. Probert is survived by his wife, Dani, and four children.\n\nProbert's family announced, on September 25, 2010, that his brain would be donated to the Sports Legacy Institute to assist researchers who are studying the effects of concussions and other sports-related head injuries. In March 2011, it was reported that researchers at Boston University they had found evidence of chronic traumatic encephalopathy in Probert's brain.\n\nOn Sunday April 9, 2017, Probert's family spread his ashes in the Red Wings penalty box at the Joe Louis Arena's final game.\n\nBob had an older brother Norm who also played hockey. Norm never played in the NHL, but it is mentioned in the 2018 documentary \"Tough Guy: The Bob Probert Story\" that Norm \"briefly played in Czechoslovakia.\"\n\n\n"}

While televisions were not widely available nor affordable, those who could spend the money on them became community leaders and often invited the neighborhood to visit. Bars and cafés turned from places where men would meet to argue or play cards into miniature cinemas where arguments over what show to watch would break out. Women and children were also more accepted inside the bars, as a result of the lack of men post-war and their need to enter working society.

{"id": "1841516", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1841516", "title": "Clericalism", "text": "Clericalism\n\nClericalism is the application of the formal, church-based, leadership or opinion of ordained clergy in matters of either the church or broader political and sociocultural import. \n\nIn a pejorative manner, clericalism is often used to denote ecclesiolatry, that is, excessive devotion to the institutional aspects of an organized religion, usually over and against the religion's own beliefs or faith. This means that all issues, even those that may be beyond the religion's jurisdiction, must be addressed by either clergy or their supporters. Clericalism is also used to describe the cronyism and cloistered political environs of hierarchical religions, usually Christian denominational hierarchy, and mainly in reference to the Roman Catholic Church. The phenomenon of clericalism is not restricted to the ordained (e.g., priests, ministers), as it occurs in purely secular guilds, such as academia, the legal and medical establishments, and the public-safety clergy: the police and military.\n\nOutside of Catholicism, \"clericalism\" is used to denote the divisions between ordained clergy and lay leaders in some Christian denominations while the older meaning of the term—an application of church-based theory or thought to secular issues—seems rather lost in most current uses of the term. In the aforementioned use of the term, it is important to discern the difference between a belief in a separation of church and state—which is not truly involving of clericalism—and the belief that church leadership should not be an internal and cloistered body that answers only to itself or that such leaders should not act as a powerful force in matters beyond the internal concerns of their church. Much debate in recent years over the sexual-abuse scandals in the Roman Catholic Church has brought about charges of clericalism in the sense of bishops and other leaders covering up the wrongdoing of clergy under their leadership. In this application of the term, clericalism has come to mean a division between ordained church leaders—that such leaders have an exclusive society unto themselves—and the lay followers.\n\nMuch debate over clericalism appears to dwell on whether the high clergy should have as much control over church offices and functions as they do, and whether the hierarchical and authoritarian nature of the traditional Catholic systems of promotion for clergy is effective in contemporary society. Again, while the Catholic Church is most commonly at the center of issues germane to clericalism, it is not the only denomination or religion in which charges of clericalism have been brought forth by those who feel the clergy has too much influence or should be reformed. Therefore, the debate over clericalism and anti-clericalism is often really a debate over how and by whom a religious organization (denomination) should be led and directed.\n\nIn political history of various countries, distinctive radicalized forms of nationalistic clericalism or \"clerical nationalism\" (clero-nationalism or clerico-nationalism) were emerging on the far-right of the political spectrum, specially during the interwar period in the first half of 20th century.\n\n\"The reason that the 19th century French statesman Léon Gambetta said that “\"clericalism\" is the enemy” was because he saw freedom from ecclesial power as the principal objective in the battle for public freedom.\"\n\nPope Francis in his address to the Synod Fathers at Synod2018 gave the following definition of clericalism:\n\nToronto priest Fr. Thomas Rosica names and defines “clericalism” with reference to Pope Francis, who he says uses “clericalism” to mean a kind of “ecclesiastical narcissism,” as well as a “club mentality and a corrupt system of cronyism.””\n\nClericalism has also come to be regarded as a euphemism for acts connected with the abuse crisis such as homosexual pederasty and rape.\n\nA Catholic deacon and a scholar at a Catholic university have criticized the Catholic priesthood for having some narcissistic priests. In 2007, Mary Gail Frawley-O'Dea wrote,\n\nIn his 1520 \"Treatise on the New Testament\", Martin Luther argued that clericalism was a result of canon law:\nClericalism was a significant theme in the 16th century Spanish novella \"The Life of Lazarillo de Tormes and of His Fortunes and Adversities\".\n\n\n"}

The film revolves around a bachelor party that a group of men throw for their friend Rick Gassko (Hanks) on the eve of his wedding and whether he can remain faithful to his fiancée Debbie (Kitaen).\n\nParty animal Rick Gassko (Tom Hanks), who makes his living as a Catholic-school bus driver, decides to settle down and marry his girlfriend Debbie Thompson (Tawny Kitaen). After learning the news of the engagement, Rick's shocked friends, led by Jay (Adrian Zmed), decide to throw him an epic bachelor party. The bride's wealthy, conservative parents are unhappy with her decision, and her father enlists the help of Debbie's ex-boyfriend Cole Whittier (Robert Prescott) to sabotage her relationship with Rick and win her back.\n\nWhile Debbie worries and goes off to a bridal shower thrown by her friends, Rick heads to the bachelor party, which takes place in a lavish, spacious hotel suite, and promises to remain faithful. Both parties start off on the wrong foot because of Cole's meddling. As the bachelor party starts to heat up, Debbie and the girls decide to get even with Rick and his friends by having a party of their own. Both parties eventually collide, leading to Debbie accusing Rick of infidelity.\n\nThe bachelor party becomes a wild, drunken orgy and the hotel room is trashed, which infuriates the hotel's frustrated manager (Kenneth Kimmins). Adding to the confusion is Rick's friend Brad, who has become despondent over the breakup of his marriage and botches several suicide attempts. When Brad tries to slit his wrists with an electric razor, Rick says, \"Well...at least your wrists will be smooth and kissable.\"\n\nRick convinces Debbie of his love and faithfulness just as the party is raided by the police. In the ensuing melee, Rick and Debbie become separated and Cole kidnaps Debbie, so Rick and his friends chase after them. The chase culminates in a showdown between Rick and Cole in a 36-screen movie theater, with a fist fight taking place in synchronization with a similar fight being shown in a 3D film projected behind them; the audience believes that the real fight is an extraordinary 3D effect. Rick wins the fight and is reunited with Debbie.\n\nAfter the wedding, Rick and Debbie are driven to the airport for their honeymoon in Rick's school bus, which is driven by a laughing Brad.\n\nThe idea for the film came from an actual bachelor party thrown by producer Ron Moler and a group of friends for fellow producer Bob Israel. Several members of the film's cast and crew were at that party when the idea began to take shape.\n\nThe film was made in the wake of the success of \"Police Academy\".\n\nThe soundtrack album from \"Bachelor Party\" was released in 1984.\n\n\nThe film also features these songs:\n\nReviews for \"Bachelor Party\" were mixed, holding a rating of 54% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 26 reviews. While some critics appreciated the humor, others found it to be vulgar and gratuitous. Film critics Roger Ebert and Janet Maslin both recommended the film, but had reservations about certain aspects, calling it \"sophomoric\" and \"not a great film.\"\n\nIn a \"Los Angeles Times\" review, writer Kevin Thomas praised Hanks as a \"likable, spontaneous zany\" but felt that the film was 15 minutes too long: \"That extra 15 minutes allows for just enough repetition (and just enough lingering over as much outrageous sexual connotation that an R rating permits) to let heavy-handed tastelessness creep in and dampen the fun.\"\n\nTwenty-four years after \"Bachelor Party\" was released, 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment produced a straight-to-DVD sequel (in name only) called \"\".\n\nOn October 21, 2014, it was reported that ABC would be developing a TV show inspired by the film.\n\n"}

It will be located on the former site of HMS \"Tamar\" on Hong Kong Island, Hong Kong. Tamar Station will be the eastern terminus of the Tung Chung Line and the western terminus of the Tseung Kwan O Line. It will also act as a transfer station between the two lines.\n\nThe MTR plans to start construction of the station in 2021 and open it in 2026. Geographically, the Admiralty MTR station is located to the north, while the reclaimed Central and Wan Chai are to the south. The station would sit at the foot of the Central Government Complex, directly under Tamar Park.\n\nThe Station will use the current footbridge which crosses Harcourt Road to connect Admiralty Station.\n\nAccording to the original plan, the site of the station was to be the location of the new Central Government Complex. However, since the September 11, 2001, attacks in the United States, the Hong Kong government worried that should the government headquarters be built above the railway station, terrorists might use the station to commit an attack against the complex. Also, due to fluctuations in real estate, the Hong Kong government requested that the land be auctioned for commercial purposes. The development of the lot has been pending, which has had a direct impact on the construction project site and the North Island line.\n\nIn 2006, the Hong Kong Government was set to implement the Tamar Development Project. The new Government Complex was inaugurated in 2011, but the timetable of the construction of the NIL station was still undecided.\n\nOn 21 February 2013, the Highways Department published an improved version of the \"Railway Development Strategy.\" As part of the second phase of public consultation for the North Island Line, the department created two proposals: a \"swap\" scheme and an \"interchange\" scheme. In the former plan, the North Island Line would be split in two lines. The Tung Chung Line would extend east from Hong Kong Station to serve the new Tamar, Exhibition, and Causeway Bay North stations before using the current Island Line track from Fortress Hill to Chai Wan. Meanwhile, the Tseung Kwan O Line would extend west past North Point station to the Island Line's Tin Hau station before going along the current Island Line to the Kennedy Town station. In the latter, the Tung Chung Line would be extended one stop, from Hong Kong to Tamar, while the Tseung Kwan O Line would be extended three stops, from North Point to Causeway Bay North, Exhibition, and Tamar (with Tamar becoming an interchange station and terminal for the two lines). The Hong Kong government opted for the \"interchange\" scheme in 2014, which meant that the Tamar station would be a four-track, two-level station, as opposed to the two-track, one-level station proposed as part of the \"swap\" scheme.\n"}

{"id": "1841564", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1841564", "title": "Contradanza", "text": "Contradanza\n\nContradanza (also called \"contradanza criolla\", \"danza\", \"danza criolla\", or habanera) is the Spanish and Spanish-American version of the contradanse, which was an internationally popular style of music and dance in the 18th century, derived from the English country dance and adopted at the court of France. Contradanza was brought to America and there took on folkloric forms that still exist in Mexico, Venezuela, Colombia, Peru, Panama and Ecuador.\n\nIn Cuba during the 19th century, it became an important genre, the first written music to be rhythmically based on an African rhythm pattern and the first Cuban dance to gain international popularity, the progenitor of danzón, mambo and cha-cha-cha, with a characteristic \"habanera rhythm\" and sung lyrics.\n\nOutside Cuba, the Cuban contradanza became known as the \"habanera\" – the dance of Havana – and that name was adopted in Cuba itself subsequent to its international popularity in the later 19th century, though it was never so called by the people who created it.\n\nThe contradanza was popular in Spain and spread throughout Spanish America during the 18th century. According to musicologist Peter Manuel, it may be impossible to resolve the question of the contradanza's origin, as it has been pointed out by Cuban musicologist Natalio Galán in humoristically labeling the genre as \"\"anglofrancohispanoafrocubano\"\" (English-French-Spanish-African-Cuban).\n\nThe most conventional consensus in regard to the origin of this popular Cuban genre was established by novelist Alejo Carpentier, in his book from 1946, \"La Música en Cuba\". In the book, he proposes a theory that signals the French contredance, supposedly introduced in Cuba by French immigrants fleeing the Haitian Revolution (1791–1803), as the prototype for the creation of the creolized Cuban Contradanza. However, according to other important Cuban musicologists, such as Zoila Lapique and Natalio Galan, it is quite likely that the Contradanza had been introduced to Havana directly from Spain, France or England several decades earlier.\n\nThe earliest Cuban contradanza of which a record remains is \"San Pascual Bailón\", which was written in 1803. Certain characteristics would set the Cuban contradanza apart from the contredanse by the mid-19th century, notably the incorporation of the African cross-rhythm called the \"tresillo\". \n\nThe habanera is also slower and as a dance more graceful in style than the older contradanza but retains the binary form of classical dance, being composed in two parts of 8 to 16 bars each, though often with an introduction. An early identifiable contradanza habanera, \"La Pimienta\", an anonymous song published in an 1836 collection, is the earliest known piece to use the characteristic habanera rhythm in the left hand of the piano.\n\nThe contradanza, when played as dance music, was performed by an orquesta típica composed of two violins, two clarinets, a contrabass, a cornet, a trombone, an ophicleide, paila and a güiro (Alén 1994:82). But the habanera was sung as well as danced.\n\nDuring the first half of the 19th century, the contradanza dominated the Cuban musical scene to such an extent that nearly all Cuban composers of the time, whether composing for the concert hall or the dance hall, tried their hands at the contradanza (Alén 1994:82). Among them Manuel Saumell (1817–1870) is the most noted (Carpentier 2001:185–193).\n\nThe New Orleans born pianist/composer Louis Moreau Gottschalk (1829–1869) wrote several pieces with the rhythm, gleaned in part from his travels through Cuba and the West Indies: \"Danza\" (1857), \"La Gallina, Danse Cubaine\" (1859), \"Ojos Criollos\" (1859) and \"Souvenir de Porto Rico\" (1857) among others.\n\nIt is thought that the Cuban style was brought by sailors to Spain, where it became popular for a while before the turn of the twentieth century. The Basque composer Sebastian Yradier's \"La Paloma\" (\"The Dove\"), achieved great fame in Spain and America. The dance was adopted by all classes of society and had its moment in English and French salons.\n\nIt was so well established as a Spanish dance that Jules Massenet included one in the ballet music to his opera \"Le Cid\" (1885). Maurice Ravel wrote a \"Vocalise-Étude en forme de Habanera\", and a habanera for Rapsodie espagnole (movement III, originally a piano piece written in 1895), Camille Saint-Saëns' \"Havanaise\" for violin and orchestra is still played and recorded today, as is Emmanuel Chabrier's \"Habanera for orchestra\" (originally for piano). Bernard Herrmann's score for \"Vertigo\" (1958) makes prominent use of the rhythm as a clue to the film's mystery.\n\nIn Andalusia (especially Cadiz), Valencia, Alicante, and Catalonia, the habanera is still popular. \"La Paloma\", \"La bella Lola\" or \"El meu avi\" (\"My Grandfather\") are well known. From Spain, the style arrived in the Philippines where it still exists as a minor art-form.\n\nIn the 20th century, the habanera gradually became a relic form in Cuba, especially after the success of the son. However, some of its compositions were transcribed and reappeared in other formats later on: Eduardo Sánchez de Fuentes' \"Tú\" is still a much-loved composition. The music and dance of the \"contradanza/danza\" are no longer popular in Cuba but are occasionally featured in the performances of folklore groups.\n\nThe habanera rhythm's time signature is . An accented upbeat in the middle of the bar lends power to the habanera rhythm, especially when it is as a bass ostinato in contradanzas such as \"Tu madre es conga.\" Syncopated cross-rhythms called the \"tresillo\" and the \"cinquillo\", basic rhythmic cells in Afro-Latin and African music, began the Cuban dance's differentiation from its European form. Their unequally-grouped accents fall irregularly in a one or two bar pattern: the rhythm superimposes duple and triple accents in cross-rhythm (3:2) or vertical hemiola.\n\nThis pattern is heard throughout Africa, and in many diaspora musics, known as the \"congo\", \"tango-congo\", and \"tango\". Thompson identifies the rhythm as the Kongo \"mbilu a makinu\" (\"call to the dance\"). The syncopated rhythm may be vocalised as \"boom...ba-bop-bop\", and \"da, ka ka kan.\" It may be sounded with the Ghanaian beaded gourd instrument \"axatse\", vocalized as: \"pa ti pa pa\", beginning on the second beat so that the last \"pa\" coincides with beat \"one\", ending on the beginning of the cycle so that the part contributes to the cyclic nature of the rhythm, the \"pa's\" sounding the \"tresillo\" by striking the gourd against the knee, and the \"ti\" sounding the main beat \"two\" by raising the gourd and striking it with the free hand. \n\nThe cinquillo pattern is sounded on a bell in the folkloric Congolese-based makuta as played in Havana.\n\n\\new RhythmicStaff {\n</score>\nCarpentier (2001:149) states that the \"cinquillo\" was brought to Cuba in the songs of the black slaves and freedmen who emigrated to Santiago de Cuba from Haiti in the 1790s and that composers in western Cuba remained ignorant of its existence:\n\nManuel disputes Carpentier's claim, mentioning \"at least a half a dozen Havana counterparts whose existence refutes Carpentier's claim for the absence of the cinquillo in Havana contradanza\" (Manuel 2009: 55–56).\n\nThe \"contradanza\" evolved into the \"clave\" (not to be confused with the key pattern of the same name), the \"criolla\" and the \"guajira.\" From the \"contradanza\" in came the \"(danza) habanera\" and the \"danzón\" (Carpentier 2001:147). According to Argeliers Léon (1974:8), the word \"danza\" was merely a contraction of \"contradanza\" and there are no substantial differences between the music of the \"contradanza\" and the \"danza.\" Both terms continued to denominate what was essentially the same thing throughout the 19th century. But although the \"contradanza\" and \"danza\" were musically identical, the dances were different.\n\nA \"danza\" entitled \"El Sungambelo\", dated 1813, has the same structure as the \"contradanza\" – the four-section scheme is repeated twice, ABAB (Santos 1982) and the \"cinquillo\" rhythm can already be heard.\n\nThe \"danza\" dominated Cuban music in the second half of the 19th century, though not as completely as the \"contradanza\" had in the first half. Two famous Cuban composers in particular, Ignacio Cervantes (1847–1905) and Ernesto Lecuona (1895–1963), used the \"danza\" as the basis of some of their most memorable compositions.\n\nIn Cuba the \"danza\" was supplanted by the \"danzón\" from the 1870s onwards, though the \"danza\" continued to be composed as dance music into the 1920s. By this time, the \"charanga\" had replaced the \"orquesta típica\" of the 19th century (Alén 1994:82 – example: \"Tutankamen\" by Ricardo Reverón). The danzón has a different but related rhythm, the \"baqueteo\", and the dance is quite different.\n\nThe Argentine \"milonga\" and \"tango\" makes use of the \"habanera\" rhythm of a dotted quarter-note followed by three eighth-notes, with an accent on the first and third notes. To some extent the habanera rhythm is retained in early tangos, notably \"El Choclo\" and \"La Morocha\" (1904).\nAs the consistent rhythmic foundation of the bass line in Argentine tango the \"habanera\" lasted for a relatively short time until a variation, noted by Roberts, began to predominate.\n\nIn 1883 Ventura Lynch, a student of the dances and folklore of Buenos Aires, noted the milonga was \"so universal in the environs of the city that it is an obligatory piece at all the lower-class dances (\"bailecitos de medio pelo\"), and ... has also been taken up by the organ-grinders, who have arranged it so as to sound like the \"habanera\" dance. It is danced in the low life clubs ...\"\n\nOrnamented and distributed throughout the texture, the contradanza remains an essential part of the tango's music.\nAnibal Troilo's \"La trampera\" (Cheating Woman), recorded by him in 1962, uses the same \"habanera\" heard in Bizet's \"Carmen\".\n\nAfrican-American music began incorporating Cuban musical motifs in the 1800s. Musicians from Havana and New Orleans would take the twice-daily ferry between those cities to perform. Whether the rhythm and its variants were directly transplanted from Cuba or merely reinforced similar rhythmic tendencies already present in New Orleans is probably impossible to determine. The habanera rhythm is heard prominently in New Orleans second line music, and there are examples of similar rhythms in some African-American folk music such as the foot-stamping patterns in ring shout and in post-Civil War drum and fife music. John Storm Roberts states that the musical genre \"reached the U.S. 20 years before the first rag was published\".\n\nFor the more than quarter-century in which the cakewalk, ragtime, and proto-jazz were forming and developing, the habanera was a consistent part of African-American popular music. Early New Orleans jazz bands had habaneras in their repertoire and the tresillo/habanera figure was a rhythmic staple of jazz at the turn of the 20th century. A habanera was written and published in Butte, Montanta in 1908. The song was titled \"Solita\" and was written by Jack Hangauer. Scott Joplin's \"Solace\" (1909) is considered a habanera (though it is labeled a \"Mexican serenade\"). \"St. Louis Blues\" (1914) by W. C. Handy has a habanera/tresillo bass line. Handy noted a reaction to the habanera rhythm included in Will H. Tyler's \"Maori\": \"I observed that there was a sudden, proud and graceful reaction to the rhythm ... White dancers, as I had observed them, took the number in stride. I began to suspect that there was something Negroid in that beat.\" After noting a similar reaction to the same rhythm in \"La Paloma\", Handy included this rhythm in his \"St. Louis Blues\", the instrumental copy of \"Memphis Blues\", the chorus of \"Beale Street Blues\", and other compositions.\n\nJelly Roll Morton considered the \"tresillo/habanera\" (which he called the Spanish tinge) an essential ingredient of jazz. The rhythm can be heard in the left hand on songs such as \"The Crave\" (1910, recorded in 1938).\n\nAlthough the exact origins of jazz syncopation may never be known, there’s evidence that the habanera/tresillo was there at its conception. Buddy Bolden, the first \"known\" jazz musician, is credited with creating the \"big four\", a habanera-based pattern. The big four (below) was the first syncopated bass drum pattern to deviate from the standard on-the-beat march. As the example below shows, the second half of the big four pattern is the habanera rhythm.\n\n</score>\n\n\n\n"}

The phrase is often used to express humorous criticism of middle-management, and specialty jargon, such as legalese, that non-specialists have difficulty in understanding. For example, \"I don't understand all that legal mumbo jumbo in the fine print.\"\n\nIt may also refer to practices based on superstition, rituals intended to cause confusion, or languages that the speaker does not understand.\n\n\"Mumbo Jumbo\" is an English word often cited by historians and etymologists as deriving from the Mandinka word \"Maamajomboo\", which refers to a masked male dancer who takes part in religious ceremonies. Mungo Park's travel journal \"Travels in the Interior of Africa\" (1795) describes 'Mumbo Jumbo' as a character, complete with \"masquerade habit\", whom Mandinka males would dress up as in order to resolve domestic disputes. In the 18th century mumbo jumbo referred to a West African god.\n\nAccording to the \"Concise Oxford English Dictionary\":\n\nAccording to the 1803 Supplement to \"Encyclopædia Britannica\" Third Edition:\n\nThe phrase appears in Charles Dickens' Little Dorrit, originally published in serial form between 1855 and 1857. \"He never dreamed of disputing their pretensions, but did homage to the miserable Mumbo jumbo they paraded.\"\n\nIt also appears in Thomas Hardy's \"A Pair of Blue Eyes\" published in 1873. 'A cracked edifice was a species of Mumbo Jumbo'.\n\nFirst published in 1899, \"The Story of Little Black Sambo\" has a titular protagonist whose parents are named \"Black Mumbo\" and \"Black Jumbo\".\n\nIn 1972, Ishmael Reed wrote a postmodern novel titled \"Mumbo Jumbo\" which addresses a wide array of influences on African diaspora and culture including historical realities like the Scramble for Africa and the Atlantic slave trade as well as its invented influences like the \"Jes Grew\" virus. The novel includes an etymology taken from the first edition of the \"American Heritage Dictionary\" that derives the phrase Mumbo Jumbo from the Mandingo \"mā-mā-gyo-mbō\", meaning a \"magician who makes the troubled spirits of ancestors go away.\" \n\n\"The Story of an African Farm\", an 1883 novel by Olive Schreiner, refers to half of a \"Mumboo-jumbow idol [that] leaves us utterly in the dark as to what the rest was like.\" Its reference symbolizes the confusion and lack of descriptiveness that came from such an idol.\n\nIn his preface to Frantz Fanon's \"The Wretched of the Earth\", Jean-Paul Sartre uses the phrase when speaking of revolutionary violence being diverted into native African religion: \"Mumbo-Jumbo and all the idols of the tribe come down among them, rule over their violence and waste it in trances until it is exhausted\".\n\nIn Vachel Lindsay's atavistic, racist poem \"The Congo\", Mumbo Jumbo is used as a metaphor for the pagan religion followed by the Africans he encounters. The phrase is \"Mumbo Jumbo will hoodoo you\".\n\nIn \"Stranger In A Strange Land\" by Robert Heinlein, the character Jubal speaks of Mumbo Jumbo as the \"God of the Congo\" towards the end of the novel in a discourse on the meaning of religions.\n\nIn \"\" by Alex Haley, the Mumbo Jumbo is also mentioned in the context of tribal men disciplining disobedient wives.\n\nIn the 1928 novel \"The Twelve Chairs\", when describing the limited vocabulary of one character, it is stated that \"The lexicon of a Negro from the cannibalistic tribe Mumbo-Jumbo comprises three hundred words.\"\n\n"}

It was the first of three ships of the United States Navy to hold the name \"Nashville\".\n\n\"Nashville\" (PG-7) was laid down on 9 August 1894 by Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Company, Newport News, Virginia; launched on 19 October 1895; sponsored by Miss Emma Thompson, and commissioned on 19 August 1897, Commander Washburn Maynard in command.\n\nThe contract to build \"Nashville\" was awarded on Jan. 22, 1894, the first Navy construction contract won by the Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Company.\n\nThe ship's originally planned sponsor was Miss Maria Guild, daughter of Nashville, Tennessee Mayor George Blackmore Guild. While Mayor Guild's party was en route to the christening ceremony, word was received that William Guild, Mayor Guild's son, was accidentally shot and killed. The party turned back immediately. Miss Emma Thompson, also from Nashville, christened the ship, with Joseph E. Washington standing in for Mayor Guild.\n\nUpon commissioning, \"Nashville\" joined the North Atlantic Fleet; and, as war with Spain became imminent after the sinking of the armored cruiser , she was ordered to the Caribbean. She was credited with firing the first shot of the war when, upon sighting of the \"Buena Ventura\", she fired a blank shot across the Spanish merchantman's bow. She captured four Spanish vessels from 22 April-26 July 1898, and assisted in cutting the undersea telegraph cable just off the shore of Cienfuegos, where many of her sailors and Marines were honored with Medals of Honor. \"Nashville\" remained on duty off Cuba until the war's end.\n\nThe gunboat departed the Caribbean for duty in the Philippines on 14 October 1899, arriving at Manila on 31 December via the Suez Canal. \"Nashville\" provided gunfire support for American troops in campaigns against Filipino insurgents until June 1900. When the Boxer Rebellion erupted in China, \"Nashville\" departed Cavite on 8 June for China with a Marine Detachment embarked. She arrived at Taku on 18 June, disembarked the Marines assigned to the International Relief Expedition, and remained until the allied forces lifted the siege of Peking. After patrol duty off China, \"Nashville\" arrived at Cavite on 3 February 1901, where she based until July.\n\nTransferred to the Mediterranean, the gunboat arrived at Genoa, Italy on 22 September. After a year's patrol duty, \"Nashville\" left Gibraltar on 1 November 1902, arriving at Boston, Massachusetts on 16 January 1903. On the Caribbean Station from 26 May 1903–4 March 1904, the \"Nashville\" was instrumental in preventing Colombian troops in Colon using the Panama railway thereby ensuring the success of the revolutionary junta in Panama and securing a treaty with the United States in building the Panama Canal. She returned to Boston on 18 June and decommissioned on 30 June.\n\nRecommissioned on 8 August 1905 at Boston Navy Yard, \"Nashville\" sailed on 8 September for Santo Domingo, operating off Cuba, Puerto Rico, and Santo Domingo until 26 June 1906, when she returned to Boston to decommission on 23 July.\n\nAfter three years in reserve, \"Nashville\" was assigned to the Illinois Naval Militia on 29 April 1909. From May 1909 – July 1911, she trained militiamen on the Great Lakes, homeported at Chicago.\n\nUSS \"Nashville\" caused an incident in 1909 when she was sent to the Great Lakes through the Canadian canal system unarmed. She was then later armed, along with four other ships, in contravention of the Rush–Bagot Treaty of 1817.\n\nAfter extensive overhaul and sea trials, she departed Boston on 7 January 1912, arriving Santo Domingo on 31 January to begin five years of patrol operations in the West Indies and off Central America, protecting United States interests. The ship participated in the United States occupation of Veracruz, proclaimed in April 1914 by United States President Woodrow Wilson, against the Mexican government of Victoriano Huerta. After a short period of reduced commission status from 10 May-8 July 1916 in New Orleans, the gunboat returned to Tampico, Mexico, where she remained until the U.S. entered World War I on 6 April 1917.\n\nAfter temporary duty off Tampico, \"Nashville\" sailed from Norfolk, Virginia on 2 August 1917, arriving Gibraltar on 18 August to patrol off the Moroccan coast. After serving as convoy escort off North Africa and in the western Mediterranean until 15 July 1918, \"Nashville\" departed Gibraltar, arriving on 1 August at Charleston, South Carolina.\n\nLt. Forrest Sherman, future admiral and Chief of Naval Operations, served aboard at about this time.\n\n\"Nashville\" decommissioned on 21 October 1918 at Charleston, South Carolina, and was sold on 20 October 1921 to J.

The western terminus is in Elgin, at the border with New York State south-west of Montreal (connecting with New York State Route 30 at the Trout River Border Crossing). Part of this highway is known as the \"Chemin du Roy\", or King's Highway, which is one of the oldest highways in Canada.\n\nIt passes through the Montérégie, Lanaudière, Mauricie, Capitale-Nationale and Côte-Nord regions of Quebec. In Montreal, Highway 138 runs via Sherbrooke Street, crosses the Pierre Le Gardeur Bridge to Charlemagne and remains a four-lane road until exiting Repentigny.\n\nThis highway takes a more scenic route than the more direct Autoroute 40 between Montreal and Quebec City. It crosses the Saguenay River via a ferry which travels between Baie-Sainte-Catherine and Tadoussac.\n\nUntil the mid-1990s, the highway's eastern terminus was Havre-Saint-Pierre, but in 1996 the extension to Natashquan was completed. A 40 km section between Natashquan and Kegashka opened on September 26, 2013, with the inauguration of a bridge across the Natashquan River.\n\nA second segment of about 17 km extends from Tête-à-la-Baleine's airport, east through Tête-à-la-Baleine, to the ferry terminal southeast of Tête-à-la-Baleine. There is also a 10.7 km roadway, la route Mecatina, from Mutton Bay to a ferry terminal in La Tabatière and continuing beyond.\n\nA third segment of Route 138 extends from Old Fort to the Newfoundland and Labrador border (connecting with Newfoundland and Labrador Provincial Route 510), near Blanc-Sablon on the eastern end of the Côte-Nord.\n\nA gap remains between Kegashka and Old Fort, through isolated communities accessible only by coastal ferry. On August 25, 2006, the Quebec government announced a 10-year project to connect the two segments by building 425 km of highway along the Lower North Shore. In 2011, the Quebec government announced an additional $122 million investment for the project over five years as part of the Plan Nord. However, by 2013 difficulties ensued between the Quebec Ministry of Transport and the Pakatan Corporation, who was previously responsible for managing the funding for this project, leading to the termination of agreement between the two. By this time only 12 km of this road had been built, plus some additional engineering work and deforestation. The construction of two segments of the highway (Kegashka–La Romaine and Tête-à-la-Baleine–La Tabatière) is set to begin in 2019. A total of $232 million will be contributed to this project.\n\n\n\"gap in roadway\"\n\"gap in roadway\"\n\n\n"}

He received his B.S. degree in Mechanical Engineering and his M.S. degree in Aeronautical Engineering from the University of Wyoming in 1963.\n\nHe was a jet fighter pilot in the United States Air Force, and as an exchange officer with the Royal Air Force attended the Empire Test Pilot's School in Farnborough, Hampshire, England. Following graduation, he served as a test pilot on the Hawker Hunter, English Electric Lightning, and Gloster Javelin British fighter aircraft from 1966 to 1967.\n\nEnevoldson had been awarded the USAF Distinguished Flying Cross in 1959 for his record flights in a Lockheed F-104 Starfighter. In 1974 he was awarded the NASA Exceptional Service Medal, for his contributions as NASA Project Pilot on the F-111 Supercritical Wing Program and on the F-15 Remotely Piloted Research Vehicle. In 1980 he was awarded second NASA Exceptional Service Medal for contributions as project pilot on F-14 stall and spin resistance tests.\n\nIn 1986 he retired from NASA and accepted a full-time position as the chief test pilot for the Grob Egrett in Mindelheim, Germany in 1988. The Egrett was a high altitude reconnaissance aircraft for the German Air Force. Enevoldson set the absolute altitude record for all turboprop aircraft in the prototype Egrett in 1988, as well as time-to-climb. With the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 the requirement for the Egrett diminished, and the project was cancelled after 6 aircraft had been built.\n\nSubsequently, he was the test pilot for the Grob Strato 2C. This was an extremely advanced, all carbon, very high altitude, propeller driven aircraft, built to carry two pilots, two scientists, and 2,000 pounds of scientific instruments to an altitude of 80,000 feet for 8 hours, or to 60,000 feet for 60 hours. On its 29th and final flight, Enevoldson reached an altitude of over 60,700 feet, which exceeded the official altitude record for all propeller driven aircraft by over 5,000 feet. The project was cancelled by the German Aerospace Research Center, DLR due to the cost of proposed final modifications necessary to make the aircraft mission-ready.\n\nAmong the NASA aircraft that he flew were the F-111, F-14, F-8 Digital Fly-By-Wire and Supercritical Wing, YF-12A, the oblique wing AD-1, Controlled Deep Stall Sailplane, sub-scale F-15 remotely piloted spin research vehicle and the X-24B lifting body.\n\nAmong the pressure suits in which he flew are the US MC-4, US A/P22S-6, US S-1000, US 1030/1034, UK pressure jerkin with Taylor helmet, the Russian KK0-15, the US copy of the UK pressure jerkin with P-mask.\n\nEnevoldson said that he had never intended to specialize in high altitude testing, but over a long career he has probably accumulated more diverse experience there than anyone. He has flown above 50,000 feet in 14 different types of jet aircraft, one turboprop (record altitude), one reciprocating engine (5000 feet above record altitude), one sailplane (record altitude), and one rocket aircraft (glide flights). He also held several time-to-climb records in the F104 (3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 20, 25 km — which have since been broken). He may also hold the record for longest time between record flights — 48 years.\n\nWhile working in Germany with the DLR he developed the meteorological basis for the Perlan Project. The theory, briefly, posits that the coincidence of the stratospheric polar night jet and the polar jet stream, when occurring over a mountain barrier, creates the necessary conditions for the amplification of standing mountain waves through the tropopause, in accordance with the Eliassen-Palm theorem. Enevoldson initiated a search for funding for the project. When balloonist and adventurer Steve Fossett heard about it from his friend Barron Hilton, Fossett enthusiastically joined the project as its sponsor. Using NASA and USAF full pressure suits Fossett and Enevoldson set the world sailplane absolute altitude record of 50,724 feet (15,460 meters), flying from El Calafate in the south of Argentine Patagonia, above the Andes mountains in the wind field of the stratospheric polar night jet.\n\nEnevoldson will be the pilot for the Perlan II follow-up project aircraft.\n\n"}

He spent seven years in India, accompanied by his nephew William, also an artist, and published several series of aquatints of the country.\n\nThomas Daniell was born in 1749 in Kingston upon Thames, Surrey. His father was the landlord of the Swan Inn at Chertsey (where he was later succeeded by Thomas' elder brother William and his wife Sarah). Thomas began his career apprenticed to an heraldic painter and worked at Maxwell's the coach painter in Queen Street before attending the Royal Academy Schools. Although he exhibited 30 works – mainly landscapes and floral pieces – at the Academy between 1772 and 1784, Daniell found it difficult to establish himself as a landscape painter in Britain. Like many other Europeans at that time, Daniell was drawn to India by stories of the wealth and fame that awaited travellers to the newly accessible East, and in 1784 he obtained permission from the East India Company to travel to Calcutta to work as an engraver, accompanied by his nephew, William Daniell, as his assistant.\n\nThomas and William Daniell sailed from Gravesend on 7 April 1785, arriving in Calcutta via Whampoa in China early in 1786. In July of that year, Daniell announced, in an advertisement in the \"Calcutta Chronicle\", his intention to publish a set of views of the city. Executed in etching and aquatint and hand-coloured by local painters, the twelve plates were completed in late 1788. In November of that year Daniell wrote to Ozias Humphrey \"I was obliged to stand Painter Engraver Copper-smith Printer and Printers Devil myself. It was a devilish undertaking but I was determined to see it through at all events.\"\n\nOn 3September 1788, the Daniells set out on a tour of north-west India leaving Calcutta by boat along the River Ganges, travelling as far as Srinagar (in the District of Garwhal, Uttrakhand), where they arrived in May 1789. Thomas and his nephew spent 1790-1 in the town of Bhagalpur (now in the Indian state of Bihar) with the orientalist and amateur artist Samuel Davis, whom Thomas had first met during his apprenticeship in London. They made many stops on their return journey, not arriving back in Calcutta until February 1792.\n\nOn 10March 1792 the Daniells left Calcutta once more, this time for Madras (now Chennai), reaching it on the 29th of the same month. They left Madras after only 11 days, having hired the services of a considerable retinue, including two palanquins and their bearers, taking a route which more or less followed that of the British army which had defeated Tipu Sultan the previous year. They were back in Madras in January 1793. A briefer third tour took them through western India. They left Madras in the middle of February 1793 and reached Bombay the following month. In May 1793 the Daniells left India and returned to England, reaching home in September 1794.\n\nOn his return to England, Daniell set about publishing an extensive illustrated work under the general heading title of \"Oriental Scenery\". Six volumes, published between 1795 and 1808, were based on drawings made in India by the Daniells themselves; another consisted of plates of the caves at Ellora after drawings by James Wales. There were 144 plates in total including a set published as \"Twenty-four landscapes, views in Hindoostan drawn and engraved by Thomas and William Daniell, with permission respectfully dedicated to the Rt.Hon. George O'Brien, Earl of Egremont\", first published on 1January 1804.\n\nThe Daniells also published \"Views in Egypt\" (1808–9) and \"Picturesque Voyage to India, by Way of China\" (1810). They etched all the plates themselves, almost all in aquatint. Daniell continued to exhibit Eastern subjects until 1828. He also contributed drawings to \"Rees's Cyclopædia\", but these have not been identified.\n\nHe contributed to some landscaping projects, designing an Indian temple for Sir John Osborne at Melchet Court, and various garden buildings for Sir Charles Cockerell's Sezincote. His paintings of Sezincote are rare exceptions to the Indian subjects which comprise almost his complete output after his return to England He was elected a Royal Academician in 1790, and a fellow of the Royal Society of Arts at around the same time.\n\nDaniell never married. He died at his home in Earls Terrace, Kensington, on 19March 1840, aged 91, having outlived both his nephews.\n\n\n\n\n"}

After recovering from his injuries he was promoted to the temporary rank of captain on 2 March 1916, and made an acting captain on 22 April. He later served with his regiment's 2nd Battalion, part of the 21st (Bareilly) Brigade in the 7th (Meerut) Division and the second of his regiment's two Regular Army battalions, in the Sinai and Palestine Campaign and the Mesopotamian campaign, including in the fall of Baghdad in March 1917. On 5 January 1917 he became his battalion's adjutant. He won the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) on 25 August 1917 and, having being confirmed in his rank of captain on 19 November 1917, was awarded the Military Cross (MC) on 15 February 1919 for his actions during the Battle of Megiddo in September 1918. The citation for his MC reads:\n\nRitchie was also mentioned in despatches. The armistice of Mudros and the armistice with Germany followed soon after and brought the war to an end.\n\nHaving gained a Regular commission in 1914, Ritchie remained in the army throughout the difficult interwar period. He served as adjutant to the 2nd Battalion, Black Watch until 28 February 1921 and, from 18 July 1923 until 30 September 1927, was a General Staff Officer Grade 3 (GSO3) at the War Office. He attended the Staff College, Camberley as a student from 1929 to 1930. Among his fellow students there included several future general officers, such as George Erskine, Hugh Stable, Herbert Lumsden, Ivor Hughes, Neil McKicking, Harold Freeman-Attwood, James Elliott, Harold Redman, Reginald Denning, Kenneth Crawford, Kenneth Strong, Edward Gurdon, Philip Balfour, Hugh Russell, John Edwards, Bernard Campbell Fletcher, John Winterton and Henry Vulliamy.\n\nGraduating from the two-year course in December 1929, Ritchie served with his regiment until being sent to India and made a GSO2 with Northern Command, India, a post he held from 2 April 1933 until 1 April 1937. While there he was promoted, for the first time in almost sixteen years, to brevet major on 1 July 1933, major on 2 June 1934, and brevet lieutenant colonel on 1 January 1936. On 4 December 1936 Ritchie married Catherine Taylor, daughter of James A. Minnes, from Kingston, Ontario, Canada. They had two children; Arnott Dugald Neil and Isobel Anne. On 3 January 1938 Ritchie transferred from the Black Watch, which by now he had been with for just over twenty-three years, to the King's Own Royal Regiment (Lancaster), and was promoted to lieutenant colonel. He became Commanding Officer of the 2nd Battalion, King's Own on the same date and took command of the battalion in Palestine, then engaged in internal security duties during the Arab revolt. Aided throughout this difficult period by his adjutant, Captain Richard Anderson, he commanded the battalion until August 1939, shortly before the Second World War began in September. For his services in Palestine Ritchie was mentioned in despatches. After handing over the battalion to Lieutenant Colonel John Hardy, Ritchie returned to England where he was promoted to colonel on 26 August 1939 (with seniority backdated to 1 January) and was made a GSO1 at the Senior Officers' School at Sheerness, Kent.\n\nRitchie was not to remain at Sheerness long, however, as, after being promoted on 22 December 1939 to the acting rank of brigadier, he was made Brigadier-General Staff (BGS) to II Corps, commanded by Lieutenant-General Sir Alan Brooke. II Corps was then serving in France as part of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF). Ritchie seems to have immediately impressed Brooke, as on 3 January 1940 the latter wrote in his diary that \"Ritchie, my new BGS, seems to be turning out well and should, I think, be good\". When the so-called \"Phoney War\" came to an end in May 1940, which occurred when the German Army invaded France, Ritchie further impressed Brooke by controlling the corps HQ in a calm and confident manner, thus enabling Brooke to concentrate on running the battle on his corps' front. After being evacuated to England Ritchie was again requested by Brooke when the latter was appointed to command a new \"Second BEF\". Accompanying Brooke to France, he was again sent back to England, after Brooke realised that further efforts to fight the Germans were pointless and, in his words, \"I sent Neil Ritchie off home this evening [16 June] as I did not feel that any useful purpose could be served by retaining him any longer\". For his services in France and Belgium Ritchie was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire on 11 July 1940, and was mentioned in despatches on 26 July.\n\nShortly afterwards Ritchie was made BGS with Southern Command, commanded by Lieutenant-General Claude Auchinleck who, like Brooke, thought highly of him. Ritchie was not destined to be there long, however, as, at the relatively young age of forty-three, he received a promotion to the acting rank of major-general on 28 October 1940 and was made General Officer Commanding (GOC) of the 51st (Highland) Infantry Division on the same date. He held this post until June 1941 when he handed over to Major-General Douglas Wimberley.\n\nRitchie's next posting was to the Middle East, where he served as Deputy Chief of the General Staff to General Archibald Wavell, Commander-in-Chief of Middle East Command. It was Auchinleck, who soon succeeded Wavell as C-in-C Middle East, who was to give Ritchie his highest field command, the British Eighth Army, in November 1941, following the dismissal of Lieutenant-General Alan Cunningham from that position. On 27 November 1941 Ritchie, whose rank of major-general was made temporary on 28 October 1941, was promoted to the acting rank of lieutenant general. For his period of service in the Middle East from July−October 1941, he was mentioned in despatches.\n\nRitchie had the bad luck to hold his highest command during the earliest phases of the war, when British fortunes were at their lowest ebb. The Eighth Army, fighting in the North African Campaign, was the only British land force engaging the German Army anywhere in the world. After some early successes against the Italians the British were pushed back following the arrival of the Afrika Korps under Erwin Rommel. Ritchie was originally intended as a temporary appointment until a suitable commander could be found, but in fact ended up commanding the Eighth Army for nearly seven months. He was in command of the Eighth Army at the Battle of Gazala in May–June 1942 where he failed to exercise strong command over the Army and the British and Commonwealth forces were heavily defeated, losing the port of Tobruk. He was sacked by Auchinleck on 25 June prior to the First Battle of El Alamein.\n\nAuchinleck is often seen as having appointed Ritchie, a relatively junior commander, in order to allow him to closely direct the battle himself as Commander-in-Chief of Middle East Command. Ritchie was criticised heavily both during and after the war for his failure to stop Rommel. Since then several commentators have come to his defence, most notably Field Marshal Sir Michael Carver.\n\nAfter being replaced as the Eighth Army commander Ritchie was, from September 1942, appointed to command the 52nd (Lowland) Infantry Division, which was then being trained in mountain warfare, in the United Kingdom, and relinquished command to Major-General Edmund Hakewill-Smith in November 1943.\n\nJudged by now fit to command a corps, he was selected to command XII Corps in place of Lieutenant-General Montagu Stopford, which formed part of Lieutenant-General Miles Dempsey's British Second Army and was chosen to participate in the invasion of Normandy. Ritchie was made a Companion of the Order of the Bath on 1 January 1944. Aided by his BGS, initially Roy Urquhart, later James Cassels, Ritchie led XII Corps during the Battle of Normandy in the middle of 1944 and the subsequent campaign in Western Europe, ending in May 1945 with the end of the war in Europe. The fact that Ritchie regained an active command following his dismissal, unlike his Eighth Army predecessor, Cunningham, reflects the high esteem in which he was held by Brooke, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff. For his services in Northwest Europe Ritchie was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire on 5 July 1945 and he was twice mentioned in despatches during the campaign, for \"gallant and distinguished services\", on 22 March and 9 August 1945.\n\nAfter the war Ritchie remained in the British Army, becoming GOC Scottish Command and Governor of Edinburgh Castle in 1945 and GOC Far East Land Forces in 1947.\n\nFrom December 1948 until retirement from the army, Ritchie held the ceremonial appointment of Aide-de-camp general to the King and from September 1950 he was colonel-in-chief of the Black Watch (Royal Highland Regiment), his old regiment. Following his retirement he emigrated to Canada, where he became a director of the Canadian subsidiary of Tanqueray Gordon & Co. and in 1954 became chairman of the Mercantile & General Reinsurance Co. of Canada. He died at the age of 86 in Toronto.\n\n\n"}

The migrations and upheaval in Central Europe had lessened somewhat, and two power regions had appeared in Europe: the Merovingian kingdom and the Slavic princedoms in Eastern Europe and the Balkans. A third power, the Catholic Church, had begun to expand its influence.\n\nIn Scandinavia, the Germanic clan society was still very much alive. In Uppland, in what today is the east-central part of Sweden, Old Uppsala was probably the centre of religious and political life. It had both a well-known sacred grove and great Royal Mounds. There were lively contacts with Central Europe, and the Scandinavians continued to export iron, fur, and slaves; in return they acquired art and innovations, such as the stirrup.\n\nFinds from well-preserved boat inhumation graves at Vendel and Valsgärde show that Uppland was an important and powerful area consistent with the account of the Norse sagas of a Swedish kingdom. Some of the riches were probably acquired through the control of mining districts and the production of iron. The rulers had troops of mounted elite warriors with costly armour. Graves of mounted warriors have been found with stirrups and saddle ornaments of birds of prey in gilded bronze with encrusted garnets. \n\nThese mounted elite warriors are mentioned in the work of the 6th century Goth scholar Jordanes, who wrote that the Swedes had the best horses beside the Thuringians. They also echo much later in the sagas, where king Adils is always described as fighting on horseback (both against Áli and Hrólf Kraki). Snorri Sturluson wrote that Adils had the best horses of his days. \n\nSwedish expeditions began to explore the waterways of what was to become Russia, Ukraine, Belarus at this time.\n\nGames were popular, as is shown in finds of tafl games, including pawns and dice. \n\n\n"}
{"id": "1841639", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1841639", "title": "Los Angeles Convention Center", "text": "Los Angeles Convention Center\n\nThe Los Angeles Convention Center is a convention center in the southwest section of downtown Los Angeles. It hosts multiple annual conventions and has often been used as a filming location in TV shows and movies (notably as a spaceport for \"Starship Troopers\" and used for the climactic fight scene in \"Rush Hour\").\n\nThe convention center, designed by architect Charles Luckman, opened in 1971 and expanded in 1981, 1993 and 1997. It was originally built as a rectangular building, between Pico Boulevard and 11th Street (now Chick Hearn Ct.) on Figueroa Street. The northeast portion of the Center was demolished in 1997 to make way for the Staples Center. The Convention Center Annex of green glass and white steel frames, mainly on the south side of Pico, was designed by architect James Ingo Freed.\n\nThe area in front of the convention center is known as the Gilbert Lindsay Plaza, named for the late councilman who represented the Downtown area of Los Angeles for several years. A -high monument honoring \"The Emperor of the Great 9th District\" was unveiled in 1995. The drive between Figueroa Street and the convention center building is also named after Councilman Lindsay.\n\nOn March 1, 1983, a tornado caused damages to the roof and upper-level panels. The building was repaired and new convention center lettering signs were installed at a total cost of $3 million.\n\nOn September 15, 2008, the convention center became the first in the U.S. and first Los Angeles City building of its age and size in the U.S. to be Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certified for Existing Buildings from the United States Green Building Council.\n\nIn 2013, the Los Angeles City Council voted to let Anschutz Entertainment Group manage the convention center.\n\nThe convention center hosts annual events such as the Los Angeles Auto Show, the Abilities Expo, the Anime Expo, and is best known to video game fans as host to the Electronic Entertainment Expo, also known as E3.\n\nDuring the week leading up to the annual Grammy Awards, the convention center typically hosts several Grammy week events. Since 2005, the convention center has hosted the MusiCares Person of the Year tribute, which takes place two days prior to the Grammy Awards.\n\nIt also hosted the pre-telecast portion of the Grammy Awards (preceding the main telecast at the Staples Center) until 2013, when the pre-telecast was moved to the Nokia Theatre (now the Microsoft Theater).\n\nFollowing the annual Primetime Emmy Awards ceremony, the convention center hosts the Governors Ball, one of the major Emmy after-parties.\n\nDuring the 2028 Summer Olympics, the convention center will host six sports. It will host women's Basketball Preliminaries, Boxing, Fencing, Taekwondo, Table Tennis and BMX Freestyle. It will be a part of the Live Site Olympic Zone down Figueroa St.\n\nThe convention center is one of the largest convention centers in the United States with over of exhibition space, of meeting space, of parking, and a 299-seat theater.\n\nThe lobby floors in the north half of the building feature two large multicolor maps of inlaid terrazzo. The project was installed by artist Alexis Smith in 1993. A map of the world centered on the Pacific Rim covers the entire floor of the main lobby, while a map of the constellations around the north celestial pole covers the floor of the upstairs lobby.\n\nIn 2010, the Anschutz Entertainment Group and businessman Casey Wasserman proposed construction of Farmers Field, a US$1 billion combination football stadium and convention center, meant to attract the return of a National Football League (NFL) team to the Los Angeles area. The development proposal was abandoned in March 2015. \n\nA new proposal was developed in 2015, approved by city hall and a design team was chosen. A new convention hall, called \"LACOEX\", would be built, with a connection to the south hall. Construction and approval is set to commence within 2019.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1841648", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1841648", "title": "Animal rescue group", "text": "Animal rescue group\n\nAn animal rescue group or animal rescue organization is dedicated to pet adoption. These groups take unwanted, abandoned, abused, or stray pets and attempt to find suitable homes for them. Many rescue groups are created by and run by volunteers, who take animals into their homes and care for them — including training, playing, handling medical issues, and solving behavior problems — until a suitable permanent home can be found.\n\nRescue groups exist for most pet types (reptile rescue, \"rabbit rescue\" or \"bird rescue\"), but are most common for dogs and cats. For animals with many breeds, rescue groups may specialize in specific breeds or groups of breeds. For example, there might be local Labrador Retriever rescue groups, hunting dog rescue groups, large-dog rescue groups, as well as general dog rescue groups.\n\nAnimal rescue organizations have also been created to rescue and rehabilitate wild animals, such as lions, tigers, and cheetahs; a job which is normally shared or backed by zoos and other conservation charities. These animals are normally released back into the wild where possible, otherwise they will remain in captivity and may be used in breeding for an endangered species.\n\nWidely recognized as an umbrella organization for animal rescue groups, Petfinder.org is an online, searchable database of more than 13,000 shelters and adoption agencies across the United States, Canada and Mexico. The American Kennel Club maintains a list of contacts, primarily within breed clubs, with information on breed rescue groups for purebred dogs in the United States.\n\nAnimal shelters often work closely with rescue groups, because shelters that have difficulty placing otherwise healthy and pet-worthy animals would usually rather have the animal placed in a home than euthanized; while shelters might run out of room, rescue groups can often find volunteers with space in their homes for temporary placement. Some organizations (such as Old Dog Haven) work with older animals whose age would likely cause them to be euthanized in county pounds. Each year, approximately 3-4 million cats and dogs are euthanized in shelters due to overcrowding and a shortage of foster homes.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, both shelter and rescue organisations are described using the blanket term \"rescue\", whether they have their own premises, buy in accommodation from commercial kennels, or operate a network of foster homes, where volunteers keep the animals in their homes until adoption.\n\nKennels that have a council contract to take in stray dogs are usually referred to as dog pounds. Some dog pounds also carry out rescue and rehoming work and are effectively rescue groups that operate a pound service. Some rescue groups work with pounds to move dogs to rescues. By law, a dog handed in as a stray to a UK pound must be held for seven days before it can be rehomed or euthanized.\n\nIn the US, there are three classifications for pet rescue:\n\n\nMany modern not-for-profit rescue organizations now not only focus on rehoming rescued animals, but rehabilitating and training them as well. Severely abused animals cannot move quickly from their previous environment into a new home. Specialized and trained rescue staff must identify signs of aggression and anxiety and work to remedy these behaviors. Like people, the recovery process is different for all animals. Some might recover immediately while others might always should signs of trauma.\n\nThere are two major differences between shelters and rescue groups. Shelters are usually run and funded by local governments. Rescue groups are funded mainly by donations and most of the staff are volunteers. While some shelters place animals in foster homes, many are housed on-site in kennels. Some rescue groups have facilities and others do not. Foster homes are heavily utilized in either case.\n\nWithin the dog rescue community, there are breed-specific and all-breed rescues. As its name implies, breed-specific rescues save purebred dogs of a certain breed, for example, Akitas, Boxers, Dalmatians, Labrador Retrievers, etc. Almost every breed is supported by a network of national and international rescue organizations with the goal to save abandoned dogs of this breed. All-breed rescues are not limited to purebred dogs. Instead they save dogs of any breed. Many work with specific shelters to support their efforts.\n\nMost rescue groups use similar adoption procedures, including completing an application, checking a veterinary reference, conducting an interview (can be in person or by phone) and a home visit. Rescue organizations are usually volunteer-run organizations and survive on donations and adoption fees. The adoption fees do not always cover the significant costs involved in rescue, which can include traveling to pick up an animal in need, providing veterinary care, vaccinations, food, spaying and neutering, training, and more.\n\nMost animals in the care of rescue groups live with foster home volunteers as members of the family until an appropriate adopter is found. There are a number of different techniques that can be used to make the transition from life at a rescue's foster home to an adoptive home easier on the animal. Generally, rescue groups provide adopters with basic information to aid in a successful transition.\n\nOften, adoption counsellors are involved in the process in order to ensure that the pet is being sent to a good, fitting home. Questionnaires for adoption vary between organizations, but are essentially used to ensure that the animal being adopted suits the lifestyle of the prospect owner and will have all of his or her needs fulfilled.\n\nThe Canadian Federation of Humane Societies accounts for the largest amount of dog and cat shelters in Canada. With 172 shelters throughout the country, it is estimated that 103,000 cats and 46,000 dogs were taken in during 2013. Of these, 60% of cats and 49% of dogs were strays, 28% of cats and 34% of dogs were surrendered by their owners, 2% of cats and 3% of dogs were cases of abuse, and the rest were either transferred from neighbouring facilities or born in the shelters themselves.\n\nOf the thousands of animals in shelters in Canada in 2013, only 47% of dogs and 45% of cats were adopted. The remaining majority were left to be euthanized, sent back to their previous owners, or stayed in the shelters, possibly being transferred from one to another hoping for better outcomes.\n\nThe rise of social media has since aided in adoption of pets, as shelters and rescue groups can now post pictures and biographies of the animals on their Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter pages. These outlets allow for people to, often without intention, find suitable pets in need of homes. Online interviews are now also possible, as well as international adoption through many organizations. Developments such as social media pages help shelters find appropriate adopters by venturing outside of their immediate surroundings and creating online networks, allowing more people to be exposed to the information and possibility of animal adoption. Dogs and cats of the Dominican Republic, for example, is an organization that creates profiles for stray animals in the Dominican Republic, and uses an almost entirely online platform to find homes for them, usually overseas, before sending them by plane, spayed and neutered, to be picked up by their new owner.\n\nWildlife rescue groups, unlike many other animal rescue organizations, focus on the rehabilitation and care of wild animals saved from illegal breeders, roadside circuses, and many other abusive situations. They do not seek to find adoptive homes for the animals, but rather to reintroduce the animals to lifestyles that suit their needs and that allow them to live freely, sometimes even releasing them into the wild after sufficient care.\n\nThe World Wildlife Foundation (WWF) is also an organization that, amongst other objectives, strives to rescue wildlife. This foundation raises awareness of endangered, vulnerable, and threatened species and accepts donations to aid in controlling climate, sustainability and ecosystems to ensure the safety and protection of these species. WWF's notable efforts to preserve wildlife has significant impact on the well-being of many species. They offer \"symbolic adoptions\" for animals, meaning that although one cannot raise a wild animal in a domestic environment, people have the opportunity to purchase a plush toy of an endangered species on the website and \"adopt\" said species. The money raised through this campaign goes towards conservation efforts, ultimately hoping to save these species from endangerment. WWF does support legal trophy hunting as a form of conservation, due to the amount of extra protection that wild animals receive and the boost that it provides to local communities.\n\n\n"}

Miller (March 13, 1924-September 1, 2006) was a United States Air Force officer who served in World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War. He served as a navigator for bombers in World War II, and as a helicopter pilot assigned largely to rescue missions in Korea and Vietnam. In Korea he made a number of notable rescues and was awarded a Silver Star and a Cheney Award. In between wars he served as an instructor, frequently flying fighter planes.\n\nDaniel J. Miller was born in Stony Point, New York on March 13, 1924 to John J. and Kathryn Miller. He attended Stony Point High School where he lettered in two sports and graduated in 1942. He met his wife, Julia Veronica Miller (Brophy) in high school and they married when Miller returned from WWII. Julia was born on September 12, 1924 to Frank and Julia Brophy and was raised in Grassy Point, New York. They had six children, Dan, Michael, Kevin, Tim, Julie, and Mark.\n\nMiller died September 1, 2006 in Indialantic, Florida.\n\nHe enlisted in the Air Force in January 1943 during World War II. Before going abroad, he trained at the Pueblo Army Air Base, attending navigation school. Upon graduation, he was commissioned a second lieutenant. In November 1944, he was assigned to the 484th Bombardment Group engaged in Italy with the 15th Air Force. In WWII he occasionally served as a gunner but served primarily as a navigator on B-24 Liberators. While stationed in Italy he flew 25 missions over Germany and was awarded with the Distinguished Flying Cross. He served with the 484th until 1945 and he was promoted to 1st lieutenant at the end of the war. In WWII, he was also awarded with the Air Medal with three clusters and the European Theater Ribbon with four battle stars.\n\nAfter the war, he trained to become a pilot and in March 1947, he graduated in class 47-A at Williams Field in Chandler, Arizona, earning his pilot's wings. In October 1950, during the Korean War, he was sent to Korea with the 3rd Air Rescue Service. There, he piloted H-5 helicopters flying wounded from the front line and often flying pilots whose planes have crash-landed or been shot down behind enemy lines.\n\nOn February 7, 1951, Miller and Lt. Earnest L. MacQuarrie piloted a pair of helicopters in what was called one of the most daring air rescues of the war of eight infantrymen. At the outset of that rescue, MacQuarrie's helicopter stayed in the air initially to help direct fire from the support F-80 fighter planes. When North Korean forces opened fire on the trapped men, Miller shot at them with his .45 pistol, allowing MacQuarrie to see the location of the enemy soldiers and direct the support fighters who bombed them with napalm. In September 1952, Miller was awarded the Cheney Award for this rescue. The Cheney Award was established in honor of Lt. William Cheney who was killed in an air collision over Foggia, Italy in 1928. The award may be given every year, although it had only been rarely awarded between its establishment and Cheney receiving the award in 1952.\n\nIn another rescue, Miller piloted a helicopter to rescue Major Frank H. Presley, a downed airman near Munsan. This mission was performed under severe fire and as Miller was leaving he attempted a second rescue of Captain Willis R. Brown, whose escort fighter had been shot down by anti-aircraft fire. Brown did not eject and had already died, and Miller aborted that second rescue. He would be awarded a Silver Star for this mission.\n\nBy July, Miller had flown 63 rescue missions. In a nod to his performance, he was one of two pilots given the mission to fly Allied officer-delegates to peace talks at Kaesong along with Lt. Harold W. Moore. In that mission he took colonel rank officers to a conference which could have paved the way for later negotiations, although the talks would ultimately fail.\n\nMiller continued to fly rescue missions, and in September, Miller and pilots Lt. Michael Angelo Mecca, Lt. Charles J. Dupont, and Lt. Leonard A. Hughes were credited with a rescue of 14 Army engineers who had been working on a section of a pontoon bridge which had torn away from the rest at Imjin River.\n\nAfter the war, Williams became an instructor-pilot at Williams Air Force Base. He was later assigned to the 81st Fighter Group at Wheeler Field, Hawaii where he flew the P-47 and P-51 fighters, and then at Moses Lake, Washington where he served as a jet pilot. In 1960 he graduated from the Air Command and Staff College at Maxwell Air Force Base in Alabama and then was assigned to the Air Training Command, and he became an instructor for F-80, F-84, and F-86 fighters. In 1967, he was given special recognition for helping his unit win the coveted U.S. Air Force Outstanding Unit award.\n\nDuring the Vietnam War, Miller flew rescue missions and commanded the 19th Tactical Air Support Squadron. At least one son also served in Vietnam; in 1968, Daniel, Jr. was stationed in Vietnam with the 281st Assault Helicopter Company.\n"}

For example, if \"M\" and \"N\" are two Riemannian manifolds with metrics \"g\" and \"h\", respectively, \nwhen is there a diffeomorphism\n\nsuch that\n\nAlthough the answer to this particular question was known in dimension 2 to Gauss and in higher dimensions to Christoffel and perhaps Riemann as well, Élie Cartan and his intellectual heirs developed a technique for answering similar questions for radically different geometric structures. (For example see the Cartan–Karlhede algorithm.)\n\nCartan successfully applied his equivalence method to many such structures, including projective structures, CR structures, and complex structures, as well as ostensibly non-geometrical structures such as the equivalence of Lagrangians and ordinary differential equations. (His techniques were later developed more fully by many others, such as D. C. Spencer and Shiing-Shen Chern.)\n\nThe equivalence method is an essentially algorithmic procedure for determining when two geometric structures are identical. For Cartan, the primary geometrical information was expressed in a coframe or collection of coframes on a differentiable manifold. See method of moving frames.\n\nSpecifically, suppose that \"M\" and \"N\" are a pair of manifolds each carrying a G-structure for a structure group \"G\". This amounts to giving a special class of coframes on \"M\" and \"N\". Cartan's method addresses the question of whether there exists a local diffeomorphism φ:\"M\"→\"N\" under which the \"G\"-structure on \"N\" pulls back to the given \"G\"-structure on \"M\". An equivalence problem has been \"\"solved\"\" if one can give a complete set of structural invariants for the \"G\"-structure: meaning that such a diffeomorphism exists if and only if all of the structural invariants agree in a suitably defined sense.\n\nExplicitly, local systems of one-forms θ and γ are given on \"M\" and \"N\", respectively, which span the respective cotangent bundles (i.e., are coframes). The question is whether there is a local diffeomorphism φ:\"M\"→\"N\" such that the pullback of the coframe on \"N\" satisfies\nwhere the coefficient \"g\" is a function on \"M\" taking values in the Lie group \"G\". For example, if \"M\" and \"N\" are Riemannian manifolds, then \"G\"=\"O\"(\"n\") is the orthogonal group and θ and γ are orthonormal coframes of \"M\" and \"N\" respectively. The question of whether two Riemannian manifolds are isometric is then a question of whether there exists a diffeomorphism φ satisfying (1).\n\nThe first step in the Cartan method is to express the pullback relation (1) in as invariant a way as possible through the use of a \"\"prolongation\"\". The most economical way to do this is to use a \"G\"-subbundle \"PM\" of the principal bundle of linear coframes \"LM\", although this approach can lead to unnecessary complications when performing actual calculations. In particular, later on this article uses a different approach. But for the purposes of an overview, it is convenient to stick with the principal bundle viewpoint.\n\nThe second step is to use the diffeomorphism invariance of the exterior derivative to try to isolate any other higher-order invariants of the \"G\"-structure. Basically one obtains a connection in the principal bundle \"PM\", with some torsion. The components of the connection and of the torsion are regarded as invariants of the problem.\n\nThe third step is that if the remaining torsion coefficients are not constant in the fibres of the principal bundle \"PM\", it is often possible (although sometimes difficult), to normalize them by setting them equal to a convenient constant value and solving these normalization equations, thereby reducing the effective dimension of the Lie group \"G\". If this occurs, one goes back to step one, now having a Lie group of one lower dimension to work with.\n\nThe main purpose of the first three steps was to reduce the structure group itself as much as possible. Suppose that the equivalence problem has been through the loop enough times that no further reduction is possible. At this point, there are various possible directions in which the equivalence method leads. For most equivalence problems, there are only four cases: complete reduction, involution, prolongation, and degeneracy.\n\nComplete reduction. Here the structure group has been reduced completely to the trivial group. The problem can now be handled by methods such as the Frobenius theorem. In other words, the algorithm has successfully terminated.\n\nOn the other hand, it is possible that the torsion coefficients are constant on the fibres of \"PM\". Equivalently, they no longer depend on the Lie group \"G\" because there is nothing left to normalize, although there may still be some torsion. The three remaining cases assume this.\n\nInvolution. The equivalence problem is said to be involutive (or \"in involution\") if it passes Cartan's test. This is essentially a rank condition on the connection obtained in the first three steps of the procedure. The Cartan test generalizes the Frobenius theorem on the solubility of first-order linear systems of partial differential equations. If the coframes on \"M\" and \"N\" (obtained by a thorough application of the first three steps of the algorithm) agree and satisfy the Cartan test, then the two \"G\"-structures are equivalent. (Actually, to the best of the author's knowledge, the coframes must be real analytic in order for this to hold, because the Cartan-Kähler theorem requires analyticity.)\n\nProlongation. This is the most intricate case. In fact there are two sub-cases. In the first sub-case, all of the torsion can be uniquely absorbed into the connection form. (Riemannian manifolds are an example, since the Levi-Civita connection absorbs all of the torsion). The connection coefficients and their invariant derivatives form a complete set of invariants of the structure, and the equivalence problem is solved. In the second subcase, however, it is either impossible to absorb all of the torsion, or there is some ambiguity (as is often the case in Gaussian elimination, for example). Here, just as in Gaussian elimination, there are additional parameters which appear in attempting to absorb the torsion. These parameters themselves turn out to be additional invariants of the problem, so the structure group \"G\" must be \"prolonged\" into a subgroup of a jet group. Once this is done, one obtains a new coframe on the prolonged space and has to return to the first step of the equivalence method. (See also prolongation of G-structures.)\n\nDegeneracy. Because of a non-uniformity of some rank condition, the equivalence method is unsuccessful in handling this particular equivalence problem. For example, consider the equivalence problem of mapping a manifold \"M\" with a single one-form θ to another manifold with a single one-form γ such that φ*γ=θ. The zeros of these one forms, as well as the rank of their exterior derivatives at each point need to be taken into account. The equivalence method can handle such problems if all of the ranks are uniform, but it is not always suitable if the rank changes. Of course, depending on the particular application, a great deal of information can still be obtained with the equivalence method.\n"}

{"id": "1841665", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1841665", "title": "Apostatic selection", "text": "Apostatic selection\n\nApostatic selection is a form of negative frequency-dependent selection. It describes the survival of individual prey animals that are different (through mutation) from their species in a way that makes it more likely for them to be ignored by their predators. It operates on polymorphic species, species which have different forms. In apostatic selection, the common forms of a species are preyed on more than the rarer forms, giving the rare forms a selective advantage in the population. It has also been discussed that apostatic selection acts to stabilize prey polymorphisms.\n\nApostatic selection was used in 1962 by Bryan Clarke in reference to predation on polymorphic grove snails and since then it has been used interchangeably with negative frequency-dependent selection. The behavioural basis of apostatic selection was initially ignored, but eventually established by A.B Bond\n\nApostatic selection can also apply to the predator if the predator has various morphs. There are multiple concepts that are closely linked with apostatic selection. One is the idea of prey switching, which is another term used to look at a different aspect of the same phenomenon, as well as the concept of a search image. Search images are relevant to apostatic selection as it is how a predator is able to detect an organism as a possible prey. Apostatic selection is important in evolution because it can sustain a stable equilibrium of morph frequencies, and hence maintains large amounts of genetic diversity in natural populations.\n\nIt is important to note however, that a rare morph being present in a population does not always mean that apostatic selection will occur, and the rare morph could be targeted at a higher rate. From a predatory view, being able to select for rare morphs actually increases its own fitness\n\nIn prey switching, predators switch from primary prey to an alternative food source for various reasons. This is related to apostatic selection because when a rare morph is being selected for, it is going to increase in abundance in a specific population until it becomes recognized by a predator. Prey switching, therefore, seems to be a result of apostatic selection. Prey switching is related to prey preference as well as the abundance of the prey.\n\nIt has also been determined that apostatic selection causes stabilization of prey polymorphisms, and this is caused by limitations of the predators behaviours. Since the common prey type is more abundant, they should be able to produce more offspring and grow exponentially, at a much faster rate then those with the rare morph since they are in much smaller numbers. However, due to the fact that the common morph is preyed upon more frequently, it diminish the exponential rate that they are expected to reproduce in, thus maintaining the population in stable amounts of common and rare morphs. Essentially, unless and environmental change or a species evolves it produces a stable equilibrium.\n\nA search image is what an individual uses in order to detect their prey. For the predator to detect something as prey, it must fit their criteria. The rare morph of a species may not fit the search image, and thus not be seen as prey. This gives the rare morphs an advantage, as it takes time for the predator to learn a new search image. Search image shift require multiple encounters with the new form of prey, and since a rare morph is typically not encountered multiple times, especially in a row the prey gets left undetected. An example of this is how a Blue tit searches for insect prey using a search image, leaving scarcer types of prey untouched. Predatory birds such as insect-eating tits (\"Parus\") sometimes look only for a single cryptic type of prey even though there are other equally palatable cryptic prey present at lower density. Luuk Tinbergen supposed that this was because the birds formed a search image, a typical image of a prey that a predator can remember and use to spot prey when that image is common. Having a search image can be beneficial because it increases proficiency of a predator in finding a common morph type.\n\nApostatic selection serves as a hypothesis for polymorphism because the variation it causes in prey. It is an explanation for why external polymorphism exists and this theory has been tested many times. Apostatic selection has been referred to as \"selection for variation in its own sake\". Apostatic selection has been used as an explanation for many types of polymorphism, including diversity in tropical insects. Selection on different morphs in tropical insects is high because there is pressure for phenotypes to look as different as possible from all others because the insects that have the lowest density in a population are the ones that are preyed on the least.\n\nIn order for apostatic selection to occur, and for the rare morph to have the advantage a variety of criteria needs to be met. First, there needs to be polymorphism present. In addition, the prey present can not be in equal proportions, since then there would not be a benefit to be able to detect either one. This is related to frequency dependent predation, where as the predator obtains the greatest advantage from having a search image for the most common type of prey. This causes the most common form of the prey is the most vulnerable. Changes in prey detection of predators occurs, but the speed in which it occurs and the flexibility a predators search image in dependent on the environment.\n\nIf the frequency of the different prey types is continuously changes, the predator is not able to change their behavior at a rate in which will provide an advantage. In these situations, the predators who show a more flexible behaviour and have a more broad search image are able to survive. In relation to apostatic selection, large changes in prey frequencies decreases the magnitude of the advantage of the rare morph if their predators have a flexible search image. Also, the high changes in polymorphism frequencies can be an advantage to the prey with the rare morph. This is because the predators without the flexibility of their search image would have to have many encounters with the rare morph to change its search image. Predators need multiple consistent encounters with a prey in order to form its search image around it.\n\nApostatic selection is also dependent on temporal variation. Since long periods of time are required for natural selection to act on predators, their degree of flexibility in their search image can not be changed over a short time frame. Therefore, quickly arising rare morphs favors apostatic selection since the predators are not able to change their behavior and search image in that time frame. This is yet another biological process that is a victim to evolutionary time delay.\n\nThe predators are more quickly to adapt and decrease apostatic selection when a drastic and abrupt change to the prey frequencies occur. This does not change the flexibility of the predators, but elicits a very high speed in the change of the search image.\n\nApostatic selection is most strong in environments in which the prey with the rare morphism match the background.\n\nMost of the work done on the behavioural basis of apostatic selection was done by A.B Bond. It has been suggested that for frequency dependent predation, the amount of encounters with the prey aids to shape the predators prey detection. These ideas are based on the assumption that when the predator is learning foraging behaviour, they are going to obtain the common form more frequently. Since the predator is going to learn what is most frequently and commonly captured, the most common morph is what is identified as prey. This concludes that their foraging behaviour is shaped by this learned preference, thus causing apostatic selection and a fitness benefit to the rare morphs. From this, it was concluded that this search image formation and adaption is the mechanism that drives the most common prey type to be more easily distinguished from the environment, and thus be eaten more frequently.\n\nVarious types of experiments have been done to look into apostatic selection. Some involve artificial prey because it is a lot easier to control external variables in a simulated environment, though using wild specimens increases the studies external validity Often a computer screen simulation program is used on animals, often birds of prey, to detect for selection. Another type looks into how apostatic selection can focus on the predator as well as the prey because predator plumage polymorphism can be another example of how apostatic selection works in a population. They hypothesized that a mutant predator morph will become more abundant in a population due to apostatic selection because the prey will not be able to recognize it as often as the common predator morph. Apostatic selection has been observed in both humans and animals, proving that it is not exclusive to lower level organisms, and the cognition it uses is applicable to all organisms in which can display learning. Though a lot of this work has been experimental and lab controlled, there are some examples of it happening with both wild specimens and in the natural habitat of the species.\n\nIn hawks, almost all of their polymorphism is found on their ventral side it allows for less common coloration to be favored since it will be recognized least. Polymorphism is defined by foraging strategies, one of which is apostatic selection. Because of the different morphs and the varying selection on them, changes in prey detection maintain prey polymorphism due to apostatic selection.\n\nApostatic selection can be reflected in Batesian mimicry. Aposematism and apostatic selection is used to explain defensive signaling like Batesian mimicry in certain species. A paper by Pfenning et al., 2006 looks into this concept. In allopatric situations, situations where separate species overlap geographically, mimic phenotypes have a really high fitness and are selected for when their model is present but when it is absent, they suffer intense predation. In this article it was suggested that this is caused by apostatic selection because strength of selection is higher on the mimics that are hidden by their original model.\n\nIn Batesian mimicry, if the mimic is less common than the model, then the rare mimic phenotype is favored because the predator has continued reinforcement that the prey is harmful or unpalatable. When the mimic becomes more common than the model, it switches and is preyed upon much more often. Therefore, the dishonest signals in prey can be selected for or against depending on predation pressure.\n\nAn example in birds is observed within ground dwelling passerines, in which the wild birds were kept in their natural habitat but were presented with dimorphic prey (artificial). The two colors of prey were present in 9:1 ratios, and then the prey were switched so both colors were in the higher and lower ratio. In all four of the passerine species that were observed, the more common morph of the artificial prey were consumed more frequently. regardless of the color of it. This study also had a second component in which they allowed the birds to become familiar with one color of the prey, and then presented the dimorphic prey in equal amounts. In this case, the passerines consumed more of the prey that they were accustomed too. This is consistent with the idea that the search image influences apostatic selection, and the more familiar form is encountered more making it preferred.\n\nApostatic selection has also been studied in cichlid fish, which presents a rare polymorphism, the gold ('Midas') colour morph. They discussed how apostatic selection a plausible mechanism for the maintenance of this Midas morph, and ruled out various other explanations for this morph. It was concluded that the rare morph is established by a difference in the predators detection probability of the Midas morph. One limitation of this study is that since the morphs in the wild are not able to be manipulated, no definite conclusions can be made, but the evidence predicts apostatic selection.\n\n"}

His grandparents were Italian immigrants who settled on the Island and his parents were born there as well. His father, Joseph A. Ciardiello was the youngest of four boys. He operated a dental practice in Staten Island., but also had a lifelong interest in drawing.\n\nCiardiello attended a Catholic grammar school and was accepted into the High School of Art and Design. When Ciardiello was a senior in high school, he was setting his sights on becoming a cartoonist, until Murray Tinkelman came to the school as a guest lecturer. After hearing his lecture and looking at his drawings, Ciardiello decided that Tinkelman's approach as an illustrator offered more possibilities for him than cartooning. When he enrolled in the Parsons School of Design, it was as an illustration major. At Parsons he met his second important influence on his work, his figure drawing instructor, Jim Spanfeller through whom he learned a love of drawing in an expressive way. Other instructors at Parsons included Bernie D’Andrea, Lorraine Fox and Maurice Sendak. Ciardiello would graduate from Parson in 1974 and receive his BFA in 1975.\n\nApart from Tinkelman and Spanfeller, Ciardiello's early artistic influences came primarily from illustrators who were working at the time, such as Alan Cober and Leonard Baskin. Ciardiello also drew inspiration from the work of Egon Schiele, who was an early 20th century Austrian artist.\n\nCiardiello's work first appeared in print in 1974 during his senior year in college, in Crawdaddy Magazine, who's offices were a few blocks from Parsons and which Rolling Stone credited with being the first serious journal dedicated to rock and roll.

In his youth he studied the Bokuden-ryū of swordsmanship, as well as a style of jō practiced by Shintō mountain priests (Kongō Jō jōhō).\n\nWhen he was 18, he was beaten in a friendly duel by his father's friend, the samurai Sakurai Gorōemon Naomitsu, who had utilized iai-techniques of the Hayashizaki school, and afterwards began to study under him. After being given an overview of those techniques and vowing to create a style of his own, Yoichizaemon travelled throughout Japan, to test his skills against other martial artists. During this period he trained in the naginatajutsu of the Buddhist monks from Mount Hiei, techniques that were applied often by the monks during the Warring States period.\n\nYoichizaemon was not content to develop only the physical side of his martial arts during this time. Instead, he continued training in ascetic practices, and meditated nightly, even going so far as to go on long retreats to secluded holy sites deep in the mountains. His perseverance in both his physical and spiritual training led to his eventual enlightenment. In the twentieth year of his exertions, he was struck with a vision of white gulls floating effortlessly and without conscious thought on water, and realised he could now use his sword in the same effortless manner.\n\nBased on his vision Yoichizaemon created the traditions 64 core techniques and named the style that arose from his revelation the \"Suiō-ryū\", or Water-Gull style of swordsmanship.\n\nThe spiritual, philosophical aspects of the tradition permeate the Suiō-ryū's techniques, and the core \"waza\", or techniques, are directly linked to Mima's teachings based on Ryōbu Shintō, a system of interpreting Shintō deities into Mikkyō Buddhism.\n\nYoichizaemon continued training and travelling throughout his life, and at age 67 retired to pass the Suiō-ryū to his son, Mima Yohachirō Kagenaga. To the core techniques established by the founder, Yohachirō added the ten basic \"Goin\" and \"Goyō\" forms, which serve to establish strong basic technique. The 9th sōke Fukuhara Shinzaemon Kagenori created Masaki-ryū Fukuhara-ha Kusarigamajutsu, in part based on the Masaki-ryū of Manrikigusari, which has been handed down ever since as a separate tradition to each headmaster of the Suiō-ryū Iai Kenpō. The tradition of oral transmission of techniques continues to the present day, in the person of the 15th \"sōke\" of Suiō-ryū Iai Kenpō, Katsuse Yoshimitsu Kagehiro (also iaidō kyōshi 7. dan, kendo kyōshi 7. dan, jōdō renshi 6. dan). The headquarters of the tradition, the Hekiunkan (\"Hall of Blue Clouds\"), is located at Shizuoka City, Shizuoka prefecture, Japan.\n\nThe Suiō-ryū is a comprehensive martial tradition with a focus on iai-techniques. Among the forms practiced are the following sets:\n\nMost of the solo kata can be, and are, also practiced with a partner, often with the aid of another kata, i.e. by pairing an offensive kata with one that offers a suitable defensive response.\n\nIn addition, there are also a large number of forms for other weapons.\n\n\nThe founder's son Yohachirō succeeded his father to become the 2nd head of the tradition and the lineage has continued unbroken to the present day. Traditionally, the kage waza were shared only with the successor to the tradition, in a form of transmission called \"isshi sōden\". However, now nearly all of the physical techniques of the tradition are taught openly. Even today though, one set of iai kata, which represent the very essence of the tradition's teachings, is set aside only for communication to the tradition's next sōke.\n\nThe line of succession is as follows :\n\n\nInstead of the modern kyū- and dan-grades, Suiō-ryū, like most other koryū, uses a more traditional menjō system of licenses. These licenses are, from lowest to highest, Shoden, Chūden, Shō Mokuroku, Chū Mokuroku, Dai Mokuroku, Shō Menkyo, Menkyo Kaiden and Inka. The Inka license is given only to the successor to the tradition and is not accessible to others. These licenses act as recognition from the sōke that the practitioner has demonstrated a physical and mental progression in the tradition and later that they have his permission to transmit the teachings of the ryu.\n\nAs is also common in classical schools, to properly learn its teachings the practitioner must formally join the school through an oath, \"keppan\". In this oath the future member swears not teach or demonstrate Suiō-ryū without the permission of the sōke to preserve the school's integrity.\n\nThe writer of the popular manga series Kozure Ookami (子連れ狼) or Lone Wolf and Cub, Koike Kazuo utilized the name of the Suio ryu for the style of swordsmanship practiced by the protagonist of the series, Ogami Ittō (拝 一刀), purely based on the romantic sound of the name. After learning of its actual existence he visited the headquarters of the tradition in Shizuoka, called the Hekiunkan, to pay his respects. Later, the fight choreographer of the second series of the TV show, featuring Yorozuya Kinnosuke, visited the Hekiunkan and impressed with the movements of the tradition spent some time learning the kata of the school.

It was founded on 12 April 1963 as a breakaway party from the Swaziland Progressive Party (SPP) led by Dr. J. J. Nquku.\n\nIt was launched on 24 February 1963 founded by Dr. Ambrose Phesheya Zwane and Prince Dumisa.\nIt had relations with Ghana as a Pan-Africanist Movement; it sent its members for political training to the Kwame Nkrumah Ideological Institute. Golden Highlanders were sent by the British Army in the early sixties due to pressure of the party’s protest actions in demanding political reforms for an Independent state and class struggle for a minimum wage. The Congress of the party on the eve of the state election of 1967 saw a clash of interest within members to an extent that we lost a margin of them to other political parties and to the state.\n\nA breakaway party was formed in 1972 on the eve of state elections due to failure of the President accepting a woman candidate as the Deputy President in the party’s Congress. The party won three seats out of twenty-four in the State Elections and was the first opposition to a Parliament dominated by the Imbokodvo National Movement. Bhekindlela T. Ngwenya was deported by the ruling elite on suspicion that he was not a Swazi therefore could not be a parliamentarian. This was done in total disregard of the courts of the land which ruled in his favor.\n\nIn 1973 the ruling party could not stand the NNLC as an opposition and therefore banned the party. The Leadership of the party was detained for sixty days without trial. Majority of our members that were able to escape the state forces and detention went to Tanzania, a Pan-Africanist State in which we had friendship with. After serving a long period in Tanzania the ruling class negotiated the return of the president, Dr. Ambrose Zwane. In 1997 the party reorganized itself though an Interim Committee led by Jimmy Hlophe.\n\nThe party buried its President Dr. Ambrose Zwane on 28 March 1998 in an overwhelming public support in which King Mswati III was represented. At the end of November 1998 the party had its congress in which Mr. Obed Mfanyana Dlamini, a former Prime Minister won the Presidency. In the Elections of 1999 the party opposed the country’s electoral system and boycotted the elections. Some members registered and participated in the elections. These were taken to a disciplinary hearing of which they were expelled. However in 2003 the party did not have a positional resolution on the elections of which it opened opportunities for individuals in the party to participate in the elections. The party’s President participated in the elections and won as Member of Parliament under the Nhlambeni Inkhundla. It shall be noted that the NNLC has associated its membership with the Swaziland Democratic Alliance and the National Constitutional Assembly.\n"}

It was established in the 13th century and lasted until the 18th century.\n\nIts name derives from the number of its members: one hundred (Catalan: \"cent\").\n\nIn 1249, James I created the fundamental structure of the municipal government of Barcelona: a board of advice of 4 members, helped by 8 counselors and an assembly of \"probi homines\" (leaders), all them members of the \"\" (Catalan for \"senior hand\", or the upper class formed by wealthy merchants).\n\nAfter several modifications, by the year 1265, the municipal organization gained its more permanent structure: the municipal authority rested on 3 counselors elected by a Council of one hundred individuals.\n\nIn year 1335, Peter III the Ceremonious permitted the Consell de Cent to use the royal insignia of the four (red) bars.\n\nThe importance of the Consell de Cent in the history and the government of the Principality of Catalonia is supported by many examples. For instance, in year 1464 it proclaimed Peter V of Aragon (known as \"Peter the Constable of Portugal\") as count of Barcelona. Another example is the rejection by the \"Consell de Cent\" of Martin the Humane's foundation on January 10, 1401 of the General Medical School in Barcelona with the same prerogatives as the University of Montpellier, because they felt this encroached on their municipal jurisdiction. This ultimately led to the creation of the University of Barcelona in 1450.\n\nIn the last decades of the 17th century it was represented in the \"Conferència dels Tres Comuns\" (in Catalan: Conference of the Three Commons). The Consell de Cent was abolished by Philip V of Spain with the Decretos de Nueva Planta upon his occupation of Barcelona after the Siege of Barcelona in 1714. Since that moment, the new government of the city was controlled directly by the monarchy.\n\nA main street in the city of Barcelona, the \"Carrer (street) del Consell de Cent\", is named after this institution (before 1978 it was known as Calle del Consejo de Ciento, in Spanish).\n"}

It is a pro-democracy socialist party. Formed in 1983 at the University of Swaziland, it is led by Mlungisi Makhanya. The Swazi government has been monitoring PUDEMO closely since it launched the \"Ulibambe Lingashoni\" (\"Don't Let the Sun Set\") campaign, which aims for a \"total liberation\" of Swaziland, and has recently cracked down heavily on even small manifestations of support for PUDEMO, such as the death in custody of PUDEMO member Sipho Jele, who was arrested for wearing a PUDEMO t-shirt in May 2010.\n\nThe People's United Democratic Movement was formed in 1983 at the University of Swaziland.\n\nIts 1985 manifesto stated that it was\n\nPUDEMO called for democratic reforms in 1988, 1990, and 1991. PUDEMO rejected King Mswati III's 1991 commission to review the tiNkhundla system, and the King's 1992 commission on electoral reform. King Mswati III responded by suspending the legislature, and began to rule by decree.\n\nThe Swaziland Youth Congress claimed responsibility for a Feb. 6, 1995 fire in the House of Assembly.\n\nPUDEMO held a campaign of strikes and civil disobedience in 1996.\n\nIn 2000, PUDEMO President Mario Masuku was arrested for \"insulting the king, sedition and treason.\"\n\nPro-democracy protests took place in Swaziland in 2002, with \"40% of Swaziland population believed to be on verge of starvation following poor harvests.\"\n\nAt the 2003 elections in Swaziland only non-partisans were elected. In March 2005, the Swaziland High Court ruled that \"political parties can not exist.\"\n\nIn March 2006, PUDEMO members, including Bonginkosi Dlamini, the PUDEMO secretary-general, were charged with petrol bomb attacks. In April 2007, \"Six PUDEMO members [were] charged with sedition following protests on the anniversary of King Sobhuza II's royal decree banning political parties.\"\n\nIn April 2008, PUDEMO's deputy President Gabriel Mkhumane was killed by criminals, according to the Swazi government. However, opposition supporters believe that he was assassinated by government operatives.\n\nThe Umbane People's Liberation Army, described as \"a secret militant group\" linked to PUDEMO, claimed responsibility for a series of small bomb blasts in Swaziland in 2008.\n\nOn 21 September 2008, Musa Dlamini and Jack Govender were killed while allegedly trying to bomb the Lozitha Bridge in an attempt to assassinate the King. Although PUDEMO had \"called for a more militant approach to achieving democracy ... [it] denied any part in the bombing.

He became the first and, , only Polish driver to compete in Formula One. Between 2006 and 2009 he drove for the BMW Sauber F1 team, promoted from test driver to race driver during 2006. In June 2008, Kubica took his maiden Formula One victory in the , becoming the first Polish driver to win a Formula One race. That season he led the championship at one stage, before finishing fourth overall, his best career position. Kubica drove for Renault in and was set to remain with the team in . Several years later Kubica spoke during an interview on a F1 official podcast 'Beyond The Grid' and confirmed he had signed a pre-contract for the season with Ferrari, a move that was eventually cancelled by his devastating rally crash in the winter of 2011.\n\nOn 6 February 2011, Kubica was seriously injured in a crash at the Ronde di Andora rally, in which his right forearm was partially severed. He was taking part in the rally for personal enjoyment. Kubica told Italian newspaper \"La Gazzetta dello Sport\" in a bedside interview that he could feel the fingers in his right hand and was determined to make a swift return to Formula One in 2011. Since his return to good health, however, he initially stated that a return to Formula One would be \"nearly impossible\" because of his injury. Since then, he has taken part in tests with Renault and Williams, admitting that a Formula One return in the near future was not impossible.\n\nKubica returned to racing in September 2012, winning a minor rally in Italy. Kubica was named one of \"The Men of the Year 2012\" by \"Top Gear\" magazine for his return to auto racing. In 2013, he drove for Citroën in the European and World Rally-2 Championships. He went on to win the inaugural WRC-2 title, and moved to the WRC championship full-time in 2014, driving a Ford Fiesta RS WRC prepared by M-Sport.\n\nOn 16 January 2018, it was announced that Kubica would become the reserve driver of Williams for the 2018 season. On 22 November 2018, Kubica was announced as a Williams race driver for the 2019 Formula One season. He left the Williams team at the end of 2019, moving across to the Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters while maintaining a Formula One presence as reserve driver for Alfa Romeo.\n\nKubica developed his love for all kinds of cars at the young age of four when he spotted a small off-road vehicle, powered by a petrol engine. After long talks with his parents, his father Artur bought him the car and young Kubica spent long hours driving around plastic bottles. When he got older it became apparent that he needed better equipment, so his father bought him a go-kart. However, Kubica was too young to start racing in the Polish Karting Championship as he was under the age of ten. When he entered the championship, he won six titles in three years. After his third season, Kubica decided to switch to a more competitive series in Italy. In 1998 Kubica became the first foreigner to win the International Italian Junior Karting Championship.\n\nKubica also scored second place in the European Junior Karting Championship and won the Junior Monaco Kart Cup held on part of the Formula One Grand Prix track. A year later, he defended his title in Italy and also competed in the International German Karting Championship. He also won the Monaco Kart Cup for the second time in a row, as well as the Margutti Trophy and Elf Masters races. In 2000, his last season in karting, Kubica scored fourth places in both the European and World Championships.\n\nKubica started his professional career in 2000, as a test driver for a Formula Renault 2000 car. During his first professional season in Formula Renault, Kubica scored his maiden pole position and also became a member of Renault's driver development programme. In 2002 Kubica won four races and scored a second place in the Italian Formula Renault 2000. He was also seventh in the Formula Renault Eurocup. At the end of the year he took part in a Brazilian Formula Renault 2000 race held at the Interlagos circuit. This one-off appearance resulted in a dominant win.\n\nAfter Formula Renault, Kubica moved to the Formula 3 Euro Series. However, his move was delayed by a road accident which left him with a broken arm, and titanium screws holding it together. At his delayed debut at Norisring, Kubica, driving with a plastic brace and 18 titanium bolts in his arm, won the race. He finished the season in 12th place. At the end of the year, Kubica won a street race in Sardinia and came fifth in races held in Macau and Korea. He ended his second season in the Formula 3 Euro Series, spent with the factory Mercedes team, in 7th position. In November 2004, he scored pole position in the Macau F3 Grand Prix, where he broke the lap record, but finished second in the race.\n\nIn 2005 he won the World Series by Renault championship with the Epsilon Euskadi team, earning Formula One tests with Renault.\n\nIn , Kubica became the official reserve driver for the BMW Sauber Formula One team. His results in both Friday testing and private test sessions, along with the words of BMW Sauber team principal Mario Theissen, led to speculation that he would become Poland's first ever Formula One racing driver in . In August 2006, Kubica's teammate, Jacques Villeneuve, complained about headaches after his accident during the ; he was deemed unfit to race by the team, against his own belief, and Kubica was chosen by the team management to replace him at the . Kubica qualified ninth, beating his more experienced teammate Nick Heidfeld. In the race, he finished in seventh place, but was disqualified after the race for having an underweight car. Villeneuve decided to leave the BMW Sauber team soon after the race, and Kubica's position in the team for the remainder of the season was confirmed by BMW.\nKubica had a disappointing race at the , finishing in 12th place after a mistake in tyre choice. Heidfeld, who was delayed in a first-corner accident, placed behind Kubica. In his third race, the , Kubica finished in third position, and became the first Polish driver to appear on a Formula One podium, as well as the first Polish driver to lead a Grand Prix. He was the first driver since Alexander Wurz in to finish on the podium within his first three Formula One starts.\n\nIn China, he finished 13th, again after a mistake in tyre choice. After going off track at the first turn of the race, he moved from 17th position to fifth, before pitting. He was the first to change from intermediate tyres to dry tyres after the wet track started to dry. This decision was made too early: a very slow next lap in extremely wet and slippery conditions and another pit stop to change back to intermediates cost him his place in the points.\n\nKubica performed well during the 2007 season, finishing consistently in point scoring positions. At the Kubica had a serious crash approaching the hairpin on lap 27, in which his car made contact with Jarno Trulli's Toyota, and hit a hump in the grass which lifted the car's nose into the air and left him unable to brake or steer. The car then hit the concrete retaining wall and rolled as it came back across the track, striking the opposite wall on the outside of the hairpin and coming to rest on its side. The car was heavily damaged and Kubica's feet could be seen exposed through the destroyed nose of the car. The speed measured when his car clipped the barrier was , at a 75-degree angle, subjecting Kubica to an average deceleration of 28 g. After data from the onboard accident data recorder had been analysed it was found that he had been subjected to a peak G-force of 75 G. Under safety car conditions, Kubica was removed from the car and taken to the circuit's medical centre, where he was announced to be in \"stable\" condition. Shortly afterwards, his manager Daniele Morelli said Kubica was conscious and talking. It was initially reported that Kubica could have a broken leg. However, Mario Theissen later confirmed that he was not seriously injured.\n\nFurther reports from late evening on race day, directly from the hospital, confirmed that Kubica had suffered a light concussion alongside a sprained ankle. After being kept in overnight for observation, Kubica left hospital the following day. On 14 June it was announced that as a precaution, Kubica would not race at the and would be replaced by test driver Sebastian Vettel. After missing Indianapolis, he returned for the where he qualified and finished in fourth place, receiving ITV broadcaster Martin Brundle's driver of the day award. He then went on to finish fourth again at the .\n\nKubica's retention as race driver for was confirmed on 21 August 2007. Over the first half of the season, Kubica qualified and finished strongly, including his and BMW Sauber's first pole position at the and second-place finishes at the Malaysian and Monaco Grands Prix.\n\nOn 8 June 2008 at the , Kubica achieved his first Formula 1 victory. He started second on the grid and passed race leader Lewis Hamilton in the first round of pitstops after the BMW Sauber pit crew completed a faster pitstop. On leaving the pits, Kubica and Kimi Räikkönen's Ferrari halted at the pit lane exit, waiting for the red pit exit light to change. Hamilton, running immediately behind them, missed the light and crashed into Räikkönen's Ferrari, eliminating both cars from the race. Kubica rejoined the race well positioned for the eventual victory. He passed Heidfeld's sister BMW Sauber, running one refuelling stop to Kubica's two stop strategy, and gained the necessary 24 seconds over Heidfeld to ensure that he maintained the lead after his second stop 22 laps later. The BMW Saubers remained first and second to the end of the race. Kubica later joked that he should thank Hamilton for electing to crash into Räikkönen instead of him. The win gave Kubica the lead in the Drivers' Championship.\n\nBMW Sauber's results were weaker over the second half of the season. At the at Magny-Cours, Kubica finished 5th, reporting that this was a lost race, complaining about aerodynamic problems with the car. Kubica's strongest result of the latter part of the year was in Japan where he qualified sixth. At the start, several drivers braked too late for the first corner. Kubica took an inside line overtaking several cars and emerged in the lead. He led for 16 laps, but lost his lead to Fernando Alonso at the first round of pit stops. Kubica finished second after defending his position towards the end of the race against Räikkönen in a faster Ferrari (his fastest race lap was 0.6 seconds quicker than the Pole's) Apart from that, Kubica achieved podiums in a race in Valencia and in the rain affected race at Monza. Kubica finished the year fourth in the Drivers' Championship.\n\nAt the season opener in Melbourne, Kubica qualified fourth on the grid. During the race, he was in third place and closing the gap to the front two cars before making contact with Sebastian Vettel while trying to overtake him. After the incident, Kubica continued briefly, but crashed into a wall at the next corner because his front wing had become stuck under the car. Vettel was later deemed responsible for the accident, and given a 10-place penalty on the grid for the next race in Malaysia.\n\nBMW motorsport director Mario Theissen claimed that Kubica would have won the race ahead of Jenson Button had it not been for Vettel.\nAt the , Kubica qualified in eighth place, but was promoted to sixth following Vettel's ten-place grid penalty for causing the crash in Australia, and Rubens Barrichello's five-place grid drop for changing his gearbox. However, he retired very early in the race with engine problems. The next two races, the and the were disappointing for the BMW Sauber team as both Kubica and his teammate Heidfeld finished outside the points with a non-competitive car.\n\nFor the next race in Barcelona, BMW Sauber prepared a modified version of the F1.09. The car proved more competitive but a mistake in fitting the tyres to Kubica's car during Q3 meant he could only qualify in 10th position. In the race, after a bad start (due to a clutch issue) he finished once more out of the points. Kubica suffered from an engine failure during second practice in Monaco, and retired from the Grand Prix due to a brake issue. At the , the team introduced the double diffuser. The car's performance improved and Kubica managed to score his first points of the season with a 7th place. In the next 3 races both BMW Sauber drivers finished outside the points again, but during the European and Belgian Grands Prix again proved to be competitive, scoring 8th and 4th positions respectively. In Italy, Kubica suffered engine trouble in qualifying and then retired from the race due to an oil leak. At the , Kubica finished 8th, defending his position from Kazuki Nakajima and Räikkönen in the last laps. He later stated it was \"the most difficult point I have ever scored\". At the , Kubica scored his first podium of the season despite engine temperature problems by finishing in 2nd place, 7.6 seconds behind winner Mark Webber. The podium was BMW's second of the season.\n\nOn 29 July 2009, BMW announced that they would leave Formula One at the end of 2009, which made Kubica a free agent for the season. For the 2010 season, it was announced that he had signed for Renault F1, the team he tested for during his junior career.\n\nKubica moved to the Renault team for . His position was briefly put in doubt, however, by the team evaluating its future in the sport following the 2009 season in the wake of the \"Crashgate\" scandal and the parent company's financial problems. This resulted in a Luxembourg-based investment firm, Genii Capital, taking a 75% stake in the team; Renault retained the remaining 25%. Eric Boullier was also appointed as the new team manager. Kubica said he might not stay with Renault, as his contract was only valid if the parent company had a controlling stake in the team, but he then decided to remain with them. On 31 January 2010, it was announced that Vitaly Petrov was to be Kubica's teammate.\n\nIt was reported in \"Autosport\" that Ferrari driver Felipe Massa had until the 2010 British Grand Prix to prove to the Maranello outfit that he was worth hanging onto: if not, Kubica would take his seat in . However, Ferrari re-signed Massa for 2011, leaving Kubica without a drive at the Italian team.\nOn 7 July 2010, it was confirmed that Kubica had extended his contract with Renault to 2012.\nAt the opening race of the season in Bahrain, Kubica was tagged by Adrian Sutil and spun on the opening lap but recovered to 11th. At the next race in Australia, he finished second after starting in ninth position. Fourth in Malaysia and fifth in China left him in seventh place in the Drivers' Championship, 20 points behind championship leader Jenson Button. Kubica felt that had there not been a second safety car period in China he could have finished on the podium. In Spain he finished eighth, but followed this up with another podium in Monaco, holding third throughout after losing second at the start to Sebastian Vettel. At the , he was held up behind Nico Rosberg for the second time in the season after Malaysia, and finished sixth.\n\nIn Canada, Kubica finished seventh after an eventful race and problems with tyre degradation which made his race difficult, but did set the first fastest lap of his career in the race's closing stages. He added a fifth in Valencia and seventh in Germany before taking his third podium of the season in Belgium. He was competitive throughout the weekend, qualifying third, and only a bungled pitstop cost him second to Mark Webber. In Singapore, he qualified eighth in front of Schumacher. During the late stages of the race, he was forced to pit from sixth place due to a puncture. He was released from the pits to twelfth place, but with the help from superior grip and a series of overtaking moves—his move against Sutil was favourably compared to the incident between Webber and Hamilton—was able to claim seventh place, ultimately gaining a place from his qualifying result. In Suzuka, he managed to trail the Red Bulls throughout the weekend and translated it into a strong third place in qualifying. However, despite getting a good start and overtaking Webber at the start of the race, but would retire during the safety car period after losing one of his rear tyres.\n\nFormula One journalist Mark Hughes remarked that Kubica was currently \"arguably the best driver\", considering the season so far. He emphasised Kubica's strong showing in tracks where Hughes believed that the differences in driver skills are able to overwhelm the differences in the capability of the cars; namely, Monaco, Spa and Suzuka. Kubica managed to finish on the podium behind the Red Bulls except in Suzuka where he was strong throughout the weekend nevertheless, despite retiring from the race through no fault of his own.\n\nKubica was retained by Renault – rebranded as Lotus Renault GP through Lotus Cars sponsorship – into the season, again partnered with Petrov. He tested the team's new car, the Renault R31, for the first time in Valencia on 2 February. On the last day of testing in Valencia he set the fastest time of the session.\n\nOn 6 February 2011, Kubica was injured in a crash on the first stage of the Ronde di Andora rally. He was driving a Super 2000-specification Škoda Fabia in Testico when his car left the road at high speed and hit a crash barrier, near the church of San Sebastiano. Kubica was trapped in the car for more than an hour before rescue workers were able to extricate him. He was flown by helicopter to Santa Corona Hospital in Pietra Ligure near Savona, where it was confirmed that he had suffered partial amputation of his forearm, compound fractures to his right elbow, shoulder and leg, as well as significant loss of blood. The severity of his injuries was the result of the crash barrier penetrating the car's cockpit, and hitting Kubica, while leaving his co-driver unscathed. Kubica underwent a seven-hour operation by seven doctors split into two teams, without complications. Two more lengthy operations to repair fractures to his leg, shoulder and arm were performed successfully a few days later. The condition of his hand was not clear for some time and as a result he missed the 2011 season. As he was unable to start the season, Lotus Renault signed his former BMW Sauber teammate Nick Heidfeld as his replacement on 16 February, while Kubica still remained signed with the team for the 2011 season. Bruno Senna replaced Heidfeld later in the season, at the . Kubica was released from hospital to begin his rehabilitation on 24 April 2011. In November 2011 it was announced that Kubica would not be ready for the beginning of the season, forcing Renault (who at which point had changed their name to Lotus) to begin the season with two other drivers, Kimi Räikkönen and Romain Grosjean. In an interview in 2018 Kubica revealed that he had signed for Ferrari for the season.\n\nKubica's recovery was dealt another setback after he re-broke his right leg, when he reportedly slipped on ice near his home in Italy, on 11 January 2012. He remained out of competitive racing for most of 2012, but returned to compete in the Ronde Gomitolo Di Lana in a WRC car on 9 September. He won the rally, finishing one minute ahead of the second placed driver.\nIn 2013, Kubica continued his return, focusing on rallying. He drove for Citroën in the European and World Rally-2 Championships. His first event was the Rally de Portugal, in which he was competitive, but crashed and issues with his car led to him finishing in 6th. Then, at the Acropolis Rally, Kubica won, finishing nearly 90 seconds ahead of second placed Yuriy Protasov. He repeated this success at the Rally d'Italia winning ahead of Abdulaziz Al-Kuwari by 4 minutes. At the 2013 Rally Finland Kubica lost to Jari Ketomaa by nearly 90 seconds. The Rallye Deutschland was a big success. Not only did the Pole win ahead of Elfyn Evans by 12.9 seconds, he became the leader of the World Rally-2 Championships. He re-gained this position (Al-Kuwari became the leader in Australia) at the Rallye de France, again beating Evans, this time by 4 minutes. He won again at the Rally RACC Catalunya, his fifth victory of the season. With this result he was able to clinch the championship, as his nearest rival Al-Kuwari was too far behind to regain the first position in the championship. Kubica conducted a number of simulator tests with the Mercedes Formula 1 team which showed promise, but limitations in the range of motion of his injured arm would prevent him from driving in twisty circuits like Monaco due to the tight confines of an F1 cockpit.\n\nIn 2014, Kubica started in the first round of the ERC season. He won the Internationale Jänner Rallye to claim his first victory in that championship, after coming very close on a number of occasions in 2014. His strong results in the stages for this rally eventually netted him the \"Ice Master\" trophy for the best driver in snow events that season. For the rest of the season, he participated in the main WRC class for the RK M-Sport, running as separate team, backed by Polish oil company Lotos. Kubica began his WRC campaign by taking the lead of the Monte Carlo Rally through the first two stages, but later retired on the second day after crashing out on SS9. Kubica suffered from a string of bad luck for the rest of the season, being fast on occasion but rarely managing to convert his speed into results. His best result was a 6th place at the Rally Argentina, a place lower than his highest finish in 2013 (5th in Germany) in a WRC-2 car. He finished the season in 16th place with 14 points. He finished the year on a positive note by winning the non-championship Monza Rally Show, beating motorcycle legend Valentino Rossi to second.\n\nAfter speculation following the 2014 WRC season, Kubica announced he would be racing in 2015, still running Ford Fiesta RS WRC and backed by Lotos, albeit no longer prepared by M-Sport. In 2016 due to a lack of funding his sole WRC rally was the Monte Carlo.\n\nIn March 2016 he took part in the Mugello 12 Hours, a round of Creventic's International Endurance Series, in a GT3 Mercedes. In September 2016 he competed in the Renault Sport Trophy at the penultimate round of the season in Spa, Belgium.\n\nIn January 2017, he took part in the first round of the 24H Series, the Dubai 24 Hour, driving a Förch Racing Porsche 911 GT3 in the A6-Pro class with co-drivers Robert Lukas, Marcin Jedliński, Wolf Henzler and Santiago Creel. This ended in retirement with undisclosed mechanical problems.\n\nOn 2 February 2017, Kubica was signed by the ByKolles privateer LMP1 team in the FIA World Endurance Championship. This came after he tested their car in November 2016 during the WEC rookie test at Bahrain, and lapped faster than the team's regulars managed on the race weekend. Oliver Webb will remain with the team, with a third driver for the Nissan-powered CLM P1/01 yet to be named. After the pre-season testing at Italy's Autodromo Nazionale Monza, where Kubica did not do any running, the driver announced via social media that he would not be participating in the forthcoming season.\n\nOn 2 May 2017, Kubica partook in an independently organised test of a Formula E car at Donington Park, with an aim of partaking in the New York ePrix. This failed to eventuate.\n\nOn 5 June 2017, it was announced that Kubica would be driving in a Renault-organized test of their 2012 car, the Lotus E20, at Circuit Ricardo Tormo, his first Formula One event since his accident in 2011.\n\nRenault organised a further test, with Renault boss Cyril Abiteboul stating that 'he was still quick, still consistent and more importantly he still has the enthusiasm he always carried to the team'. He added that there were 'no obvious roadblocks' to an F1 return, and told NBC Sports that Kubica could be an option for 2018.\n\nOn 24 July 2017, it was announced that Kubica would participate in the test for Renault, which would be held after the conclusion of the Hungarian Grand Prix. Abiteboul, Renault's team boss, said the test will allow the team to fully assess Kubica's current capabilities, and how likely he might be to \"return to competition in the upcoming years\". Kubica completed 142 laps of the Hungaroring on his return, finishing fourth-fastest nearly 1.5 seconds behind Sebastian Vettel.\n\nOn 11 October 2017, Kubica completed a one-day test with Williams at Silverstone driving the 2014 FW36. On 17 October 2017, Kubica had a second day of testing with Williams at the Hungaroring.\n\nAfter Felipe Massa announced his retirement from the sport for the second time, Kubica became one of the top contenders to take his seat at Williams Martini Racing. He then tested for them at the Yas Marina Circuit following the 2017 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, completing 100 laps in his first test with the team's 2017 FW40. He completed an additional 28 laps the next day and finished seventh fastest, with Williams technical chief Paddy Lowe reporting that \"there are no issues around\" his injuries, though doubts soon emerged about whether certain factors had made the times look better.\n\nOn 16 January 2018, it was announced that Kubica would become the reserve driver of Williams for the 2018 season. He took part in his first Grand Prix weekend since the final round of the 2010 campaign, in Friday's first practice session at the 2018 Spanish Grand Prix, outperforming teammate Lance Stroll.\n\nBefore the final round of the 2018 season, Williams announced that Kubica would race full-time for the team in 2019, partnering 2018 Formula 2 champion George Russell. Kubica chose 88 as his driver number, previously used by Rio Haryanto in 2016.\nThe team struggled during the season, with the FW42 being the slowest car of the field. Kubica finished in 12th place at the German Grand Prix, however was promoted to 10th following penalties for Kimi Räikkönen and Antonio Giovinazzi, scoring his first point since his return to F1 and breaking the record of the longest time between successive points finishes.\n\nOn 19 September 2019, before the Singapore Grand Prix, Kubica announced his decision to end his stint at Williams after the end of the season. Williams released a statement shortly after, stating that Kubica would see out the remainder of the season but would vacate his driver position for the 2020 season.\n\nKubica's first retirement since his return to the sport came in Russia, when Williams decided to retire his car to conserve parts after teammate Russell's race ended due to a wheel nut issue. Williams were criticised for the decision, particularly by Kubica's personal sponsors PKN Orlen. At the following race in Japan, Kubica criticised the team's decision to remove an upgraded front wing from his car for the race, after he had trialled it during practice sessions.\n\nKubica ended a difficult season in 19th place in the championship with 1 point, finishing ahead of rookie teammate Russell in the standings. He was replaced at the team for 2020 by 2019 Formula 2 runner-up Nicholas Latifi.\n\nOn 1 January 2020 it was announced that Kubica would join Alfa Romeo Racing in a reserve driver role for the 2020 season, returning to the team he made his Formula One debut with in (when it was still known as BMW Sauber). He competed at the pre-season test at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya and set the fastest laptime during the fourth day of testing. He will be joined by 2019 FIA F2 Championship driver Tatiana Calderón.\n\n As Kubica was a guest driver, he was ineligible to score points.<br>\n\n Did not finish, but was classified as he had completed more than 90% of the race distance.<br>\n\n\nAll Formula One race and championship results are taken from:\n\n"}

{"id": "1841740", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1841740", "title": "Curare", "text": "Curare\n\nCurare ( or ; or ) is a common name for various plant extract alkaloid arrow poisons originating from Central and South America. Curare is active only by an injection or a direct wound contamination by poisoned dart or arrow. These poisons function by competitively and reversibly inhibiting the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR), which is a subtype of acetylcholine receptor found at the neuromuscular junction. This causes weakness of the skeletal muscles and, when administered in a sufficient dose, eventual death by asphyxiation due to paralysis of the diaphragm. It is harmless if taken orally because curare compounds are too large and highly charged to pass through the lining of the digestive tract to be absorbed into the blood. For this reason, people can safely eat curare-poisoned prey.\n\nThe word 'curare' is derived from \"wurari\", from the Carib language of the Macusi Indians of Guyana. It has its origins in the Carib phrase \"mawa cure\" meaning of the Mawa vine, scientifically known as Strychnos Toxifera. Curare is also known among indigenous peoples as Ampi, Woorari, Woorara, Woorali, Wourali, Wouralia, Ourare, Ourari, Urare, Urari, and Uirary.\n\nInitially, pharmacologist Rudolf Boehm's 1895 sought to classify the various alkaloid poisons based on the containers used for their preparation. During this investigation, he believed curare could be categorized into three main types as seen below . However useful it appeared, it became rapidly outmoded. Richard Gill, a plant collector, found that the Indians began to use a variety of containers for their curare preparations, henceforth invalidating Boehm's basis of classification. \n\n\nManske also observed in his 1955 \"The Alkaloids\":The results of the early [pre-1900] work were very inaccurate because of the complexity and variation of the composition of the mixtures of alkaloids involved ... these were impure, non-crystalline alkaloids ... Almost all curare preparations were and are complex mixtures, and many of the physiological actions attributed to the early curarizing preparations were undoubtedly due to impurities, particularly to other alkaloids present. The curare preparations are now considered to be of two main types, those from Chondrodendron or other members of the Menispermaceae family and those from Strychnos, a genus of the Loganiaceae [ now Strychnaceae ] family. Some preparations may contain alkaloids from both ... and the majority have other secondary ingredients.\n\nCurare was used as a paralyzing poison by many South American indigenous people. Since it was too expensive to be used in warfare, curare was mainly used during hunting. The prey was shot by arrows or blowgun darts dipped in curare, leading to asphyxiation owing to the inability of the victim's respiratory muscles to contract. In particular, the poison was used by the Island Caribs, indigenous people of the Lesser Antilles in the Caribbean, on the tips of their arrows. In addition, the Yagua people, indigenous to Colombia and northeastern Peru, commonly used these toxins in their blowpipes to target prey 30 to 40 paces in distance.\n\nDue to its popularity among the indigenous people as means of paralyzing prey, certain tribes would create monopolies from curare production. Thus, curare became a symbol of wealth among the indigenous populations.\n\nIn 1596, Sir Walter Raleigh mentioned the arrow poison in his book \"Discovery of the Large, Rich, and Beautiful Empire of Guiana\" (which relates to his travels in Trinidad and Guayana), though the poison he described possibly was not curare. In 1780, Abbe Felix Fontana discovered that it acted on the voluntary muscles rather than the nerves and the heart. In 1832, Alexander von Humboldt gave the first western account of how the toxin was prepared from plants by Orinoco River natives.During 1811–1812, Sir Benjamin Collins Brody experimented with curare (\"woorara\"). He was the first to show that curare does not kill the animal and the recovery is complete if the animal's respiration is maintained artificially. In 1825, Charles Waterton described a classical experiment in which he kept a curarized female donkey alive by artificial respiration with a bellows through a tracheostomy. Waterton is also credited with bringing curare to Europe. Robert Hermann Schomburgk, who was a trained botanist, identified the vine as one of the genus \"Strychnos\" and gave it the now accepted name \"Strychnos toxifera\".\n\nGeorge Harley (1829–1896) showed in 1850 that curare (\"wourali\") was effective for the treatment of tetanus and strychnine poisoning. In 1857, Claude Bernard (1813–1878) published the results of his experiments in which he demonstrated that the mechanism of action of curare was a result of interference in the conduction of nerve impulses from the motor nerve to the skeletal muscle, and that this interference occurred at the neuromuscular junction. From 1887, the Burroughs Wellcome catalogue listed under its 'Tabloids' brand name, tablets of curare at grain (price 8 shillings) for use in preparing a solution for hypodermic injection. In 1914, Henry Hallett Dale (1875–1968) described the physiological actions of acetylcholine. After 25 years, he showed that acetylcholine is responsible for neuromuscular transmission, which can be blocked by curare.The best known and historically most important (because of its medical applications) toxin is d-tubocurarine. It was isolated from the crude drug – from a museum sample of curare – in 1935 by Harold King of London, working in Sir Henry Dale's laboratory. King also established its chemical structure. Pascual Scannone, a Venezuelan anesthesiologist who trained and specialized in New York City, did extensive research on curare as a possible paralyzing agent for patients during surgical procedures. In 1942, he became the first person in all of Latin America to use curare during a medical procedure when he successfully performed a tracheal intubation in a patient to whom he administered curare for muscle paralysis at the El Algodonal Hospital in Caracas, Venezuela.\n\nAfter its introduction in 1942, curare/curare-derivatives became a widely used paralyzing agent during medical and surgical procedures. In medicine, curare has been superseded by a number of curare-like agents, such as pancuronium, which have a similar pharmacodynamic profile, but fewer side effects.\n\nThe various components of curare are organic compounds classified as either isoquinoline or indole alkaloids. Tubocurarine is one of the major active components in the South American dart poison. As an alkaloid, tubocurarine is a naturally occurring compound that consists of nitrogenous bases, although the chemical structure of alkaloids is highly variable.\n\nLike most alkaloids, tubocurarine and C toxiferine consist of a cyclic system with a nitrogen atom in an amine group. On the other hand, while acetylcholine does not contain a cyclic system, it does contain an amine group. Because of this amine group, curare alkaloids can bind readily to the active site of receptors for acetylcholine (ACh) at the neuromuscular junction, blocking nerve impulses from being sent to the skeletal muscles, effectively paralyzing the muscles of the body.\n\nCurare is an example of a non-depolarizing muscle relaxant that blocks the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR), one of the two types of acetylcholine (ACh) receptors, at the neuromuscular junction. The main toxin of curare, d-tubocurarine, occupies the same position on the receptor as ACh with an equal or greater affinity, and elicits no response, making it a competitive antagonist. The antidote for curare poisoning is an acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor (anti-cholinesterase), such as physostigmine or neostigmine. By blocking ACh degradation, AChE inhibitors raise the amount of ACh in the neuromuscular junction; the accumulated ACh will then correct for the effect of the curare by activating the receptors not blocked by toxin at a higher rate.\n\nThe time of onset varies from within one minute (for tubocurarine in intravenous administration, penetrating a larger vein), to between 15 and 25 minutes (for intramuscular administration, where the substance is applied in muscle tissue).\n\nCurare has no effect if ingested so the meat of an animal killed by curare does not become poisonous, and it has no effect on its flavor.\n\nIsolated attempts to use curare during anesthesia date back to 1912 by Arthur Lawen of Leipzig, but curare came to anesthesia via psychiatry (electroplexy). In 1939 Abram Elting Bennett used it to modify metrazol induced convulsive therapy. Muscle relaxants are used in modern anesthesia for many reasons, such as providing optimal operating conditions and facilitating intubation of the trachea. Before muscle relaxants, anesthesiologists needed to use larger doses of the anesthetic agent, such as ether, chloroform or cyclopropane to achieve these aims. Such deep anesthesia risked killing patients who were elderly or had heart conditions.\n\nThe source of curare in the Amazon was first researched by Richard Evans Schultes in 1941. Since the 1930s, it was being used in hospitals as a muscle relaxant. He discovered that different types of curare called for as many as 15 ingredients, and in time helped to identify more than 70 species that produced the drug.\n\nIn the 1940s, it was used on a few occasions during surgery as it was mistakenly thought to be an analgesic or anesthetic. The patients reported feeling the full intensity of the pain though they were not able to do anything about it since they were essentially paralyzed.\n\nOn January 23, 1942, Harold Griffith and Enid Johnson gave a synthetic preparation of curare (Intercostrin/Intocostrin) to a patient undergoing an appendectomy (to supplement conventional anesthesia). Safer curare derivatives, such as rocuronium and pancuronium, have superseded d-tubocurarine for anesthesia during surgery. When used with halothane d-tubocurarine can cause a profound fall in blood pressure in some patients as both the drugs are ganglion blockers. However, it is safer to use d-tubocurarine with ether.\n\nIn 1954, an article was published by Beecher and Todd suggesting that the use of muscle relaxants (drugs similar to curare) increased death due to anesthesia nearly sixfold. This was refuted in 1956.\n\nModern anesthetists have at their disposal a variety of muscle relaxants for use in anesthesia. The ability to produce muscle relaxation irrespective of sedation has permitted anesthetists to adjust the two effects independently and on the fly to ensure that their patients are safely unconscious and sufficiently relaxed to permit surgery. The use of neuromuscular blocking drugs carries with it the risk of anesthesia awareness.\n\nThere are dozens of plants from which isoquinoline and indole alkaloids with curarizing effects can be isolated, and which were utilized by indigenous tribes of Central and South America for the production of arrow poisons. Among them are:\n\nIn family Menispermaceae:\n\n\nOther families:\n\n\nSome plants in the family Aristolochiaceae have also been reported as sources.\n\nAlkaloids with curare-like activity are present in plants belonging to the fabaceous genus \"Erythrina\".\n\nThe toxicity of curare alkaloids in humans has not been established. Administration must be parenterally, as gastro-intestinal absorption is ineffective.\n\nLD50 (mg/kg)\n\nhuman: 0.735 est. (form and method of administration not indicated)\n\nmouse: pot: 0.8–25; tubo: 5-10; calabash: 2–15.\n\nIn 1807, Alexander von Humboldt provided the first eye-witness account of curare preparation. A mixture of young bark scrapings of the Strychnos plant, other cleaned plant parts, and occasionally snake venom is boiled in water for two days. This liquid is then strained and evaporated to create a dark, heavy, viscid paste that would be tested for its potency later. This curare paste was described to be very bitter in taste.\n\nIn 1938, Richard Gill and his expedition collected samples of processed curare and described its method of traditional preparation; one of the plant species used at that time was Chondrodendron tomentosum.\n\nIt is known that the final preparation is often more potent than the concentrated principal active ingredient. Various irritating herbs, stinging insects, poisonous worms, and various parts of amphibians and reptiles are added to the preparation. Some of these accelerate the onset of action or increase the toxicity; others prevent the wound from healing or blood from coagulating.\n\nCurare poisoning can be indicated by typical signs of neuromuscular-blocking drugs such as paralysis including respiration but not directly affecting the heart.\n\nCurare poisoning can be managed by artificial respiration such as mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. In a study of 29 army volunteers that were paralyzed with curare, artificial respiration managed to keep an oxygen saturation of always above 85%, a level at which there is no evidence of altered state of consciousness. Yet, curare poisoning mimics the total locked-in syndrome in that there is paralysis of every voluntarily controlled muscle in the body (including the eyes), making it practically impossible for the victim to confirm consciousness while paralyzed.\n\nSpontaneous breathing is resumed after the end of the duration of action of curare, which is generally between 30 minutes and 8 hours, depending on the variant of the toxin and dosage. Cardiac muscle is not directly affected by curare, but if more than four to six minutes has passed since respiratory cessation the cardiac muscle may stop functioning by oxygen-deprivation, making cardiopulmonary resuscitation including chest compressions necessary.\n\nSince tubocurarine and the other components of curare bind reversibly to the ACh receptors, treatment for curare poisoning involves adding an acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor, which will stop the destruction of acetylcholine so that it can compete with curare. This can be done by administration of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors such as pyridostigmine, neostigmine, physostigmine, and edrophonium. Acetylcholinesterase is an enzyme used to break down the acetylcholine (ACh) neurotransmitter left over in motor neuron synapses. The aforementioned inhibitors, termed \"anticurare\" drugs, reversibly bind to the enzyme's active site, prohibiting its ability to bind to its original target, ACh. By blocking ACh degradation, AChE inhibitors can effectively raise the amount of ACh present in the neuromuscular junction. The accumulated ACh will then correct for the effect of the curare by activating the receptors not blocked by toxin at a higher rate, restoring activity to the motor neurons and bodily movement.\n\n\n"}

After a career in theatre in New York and London, Lorne made her first film in 1951, and for the remainder of her life played small roles in films and television. Her recurring role as Aunt Clara in the comedy series \"Bewitched\", between 1964 and her death in 1968, brought her widespread recognition, and she was posthumously awarded an Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series.\n\nLorne was born in West Pittston, Pennsylvania, a small mining town halfway between Wilkes-Barre and Scranton. She was the daughter of William Lorne MacDougall MD, and his wife, Jane Louise (née Oliver), known as \"Jennie\". She was born in 1883 (although by the 1920s she had shaved five years off of her age). While her year of birth is listed as 1885 in some sources, including the date inscribed on her urn (which appears to be erroneous), it was usually listed as 1888 when she was alive. The 1900 United States Census (enumerated in June 1900) gives her age as 16 and, along with the Social Security Death Index (SSDI), lists her year of birth as 1883. Her parents were Scottish and English immigrants. She had a younger brother, Lorne Taylor MacDougall (October 20, 1893 – September 5, 1943). She studied at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York City.\n\nLorne debuted on Broadway in 1905; she also acted in London theaters, enjoying a flourishing stage career on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean. In London she had her own theater, the Whitehall, where she had top billing in plays written by Walter C. Hackett, her husband. None of her productions at the Whitehall had runs shorter than 125 nights.\n\nAfter appearing in a couple of Vitaphone shorts, including \"Success\" (1931) starring Jack Haley, she made her feature film debut in her late 60s in \"Strangers on a Train\" (1951), directed by Alfred Hitchcock. From 1952-55, she was seen as perpetually confused junior high school English teacher Mrs. Gurney on \"Mister Peepers\".\n\nFrom 1957-58, she co-starred with Joan Caulfield in the NBC sitcom \"Sally\" in the role of an elderly widow who happens to be the co-owner of a department store. Although afraid of live television, declaring \"I'm a coward when it comes to a live [television] show\", she was persuaded to appear a few times to promote the film \"The Girl Rush\" with Rosalind Russell in the mid-1950s. Between 1958 and 1964, she made regular appearances on \"The Garry Moore Show\" (1958–1962).\n\nHer last role, as Aunt Clara in \"Bewitched\", brought Lorne her widest fame as a lovable witch who is losing her powers due to old age (and whose spells usually end in disaster). Aunt Clara usually visited by coming down the chimney; her hobby was collecting doorknobs, and she often brought her collection with her on visits. Lorne had an extensive collection of doorknobs in real life, some of which she used as props in the series.\n\nShe appeared in 27 episodes of \"Bewitched\" and was not replaced after she died of a heart attack in her Manhattan apartment on May 9, 1968, aged 84, prior to the start of production of the show's fifth season. She is interred at Ferncliff Cemetery in Greenburgh, New York.\n\nThe producers of \"Bewitched\" decided that Lorne's character as Aunt Clara could not be replaced by another actress. Comedic actress Alice Ghostley was recruited to fill the gap as \"Esmeralda\", a different type of older witch with wobbly magic whose spells often went astray. Coincidentally, Lorne and Ghostley had appeared side-by-side as partygoers in the iconic comedy-drama film \"The Graduate\", made the year before Lorne's death. She received a posthumous Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series for her work on \"Bewitched\". The statue was accepted by \"Bewitched\" star Elizabeth Montgomery.\n\nIn 1911, she married playwright Walter C. Hackett. They were married until his death in 1944. The couple had no children.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1841767", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1841767", "title": "Middle Platonism", "text": "Middle Platonism\n\nMiddle Platonism is the modern name given to a stage in the development of Platonic philosophy, lasting from about 90 BC – when Antiochus of Ascalon rejected the scepticism of the New Academy – until the development of Neoplatonism under Plotinus in the 3rd century. Middle Platonism absorbed many doctrines from the rival Peripatetic and Stoic schools. The pre-eminent philosopher in this period, Plutarch (c. 45–120), defended the freedom of the will and the immortality of the soul. He sought to show that God, in creating the world, had transformed matter, as the receptacle of evil, into the divine soul of the world, where it continued to operate as the source of all evil. God is a transcendent being, who operates through divine intermediaries, which are the gods and daemons of popular religion. Numenius of Apamea (c. 160) combined Platonism with Neopythagoreanism and other eastern philosophies, in a move which would prefigure the development of Neoplatonism.\n\nAntiochus of Ascalon (c. 125–68 BC), was the pupil of Philo of Larissa, and the teacher of Cicero. Through his influence, Platonism made the transition from New Academy Scepticism to Eclecticism. Whereas Philo had still adhered to the doctrine that there is nothing absolutely certain, Antiochus returned to a pronounced dogmatism. Among other objections to Scepticism was the consideration that without firm convictions no rational content of life is possible. He pointed out that it is a contradiction to assert that nothing can be asserted or to prove that nothing can be proved; that we cannot speak of false ideas and at the same time deny the distinction between false and true. He expounded the Academic, Peripatetic, and Stoic systems in such a way as to show that these three schools deviate from one another only in minor points. He himself was chiefly interested in ethics, in which he tried to find a middle way between Zeno, Aristotle, and Plato. For instance, he said that virtue suffices for happiness, but for the highest grade of happiness bodily and external goods are necessary as well.\n\nThis eclectic tendency was favoured by the lack of dogmatic works by Plato. Middle Platonism was promoted by the necessity of considering the main theories of the post-Platonic schools of philosophy, such as the Aristotelian logic and the Stoic psychology and ethics (theory of goods and emotions). On the one hand the Middle Platonists were engaged like the later Peripatetics in scholarly activities such as the exposition of Plato's doctrines and the explanation of his dialogues; on the other hand they attempted to develop the Platonic theories systematically. In so far as it was subject in this to the influence of Neopythagoreanism, it was of considerable importance in preparing the way for Neoplatonism.\n\nThe most important of the Middle Platonists was Plutarch (45–120), who also won fame as an historian. Although he was a Platonist, he was open to the influence of the Peripatetics, and even, in some details, to the Stoics, despite his polemics against their principles; he rejected absolutely only Epicureanism. In opposition to Stoic materialism and Epicurean \"atheism,\" he cherished a pure idea of God that was more in accordance with Plato. Nevertheless, he adopted a second principle in order to explain the constitution of the physical world. This principle he sought not in any indeterminate matter, but in the evil world-soul which had from the beginning been bound up with matter, but in the creation was filled with reason and arranged by it. Thus it was transformed into the divine soul of the world, but continued to operate as the source of all evil. He elevated God above the finite world, but he believed that God comes to our aid by direct revelations; this enabled Plutarch to justify popular belief in prophecy. The gods of popular religion are merely different names for one and the same divine Being and the powers that serve them. Daemons were for him agents of God's influence on the world. Plutarch defended freedom of the will and the immortality of the soul. Platonic-Peripatetic ethics were upheld by Plutarch against the opposing theories of the Stoics and Epicureans.\n\nAmong later Middle Platonists there were Theon of Smyrna, who wrote a mathematical introduction to Plato, and Gaius (2nd century) who was a teacher of Platonist philosophy. His pupil, Albinus, wrote an account of his lectures, of which we possess the introduction. Around the same time, Alcinous wrote an extant treatise on Platonism, in which he postulated three principles: the first God, the ideas, which are regarded as thoughts of this \"first God\", and matter. Apuleius (c. 125), a popular writer, expounded an eclectic Platonism in his books \"On the God of Socrates\" and \"On Plato and his Doctrine\" which are written in Latin. Maximus of Tyre (c. 180), like Plutarch, endeavoured to bridge the gulf between a transcendent God and matter by the assumption of numerous daemons as intermediaries. Atticus (c. 175) opposed the eclecticism which had invaded the school and contested the theories of Aristotle as an aberration from Plato. He was an uncompromising supporter of Plato and regarded the theory of immortality as the basis of his whole system. Nevertheless, in this theology he approached more closely to the Stoic idea of immanence.\n\nNumenius of Apamea (c. 160) combined both Neopythagoreanism and Platonism. He exhibited a far-going syncretism. Like Plutarch he supposed that an evil soul was combined with matter. From this the mortal part of the human soul is derived, which he described as the second irrational soul. Because of its guilt the soul had to descend from its bodiless life into the body, and after its departure from the body, if it does not need to undergo further incarnation, it becomes indistinguishably united with God. A gift of God is the wisdom which is the highest good, and this gift is only granted to those who devote themselves to the ultimate good to the exclusion of all other thoughts.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1841782", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1841782", "title": "Numic languages", "text": "Numic languages\n\nNumic is a branch of the Uto-Aztecan language family. It includes seven languages spoken by Native American peoples traditionally living in the Great Basin, Colorado River basin, Snake River basin, and southern Great Plains. The word Numic comes from the cognate word in all Numic languages for \"person.\" For example, in the three Central Numic languages and the two Western Numic languages it is . In Kawaiisu it is and in Colorado River , and .\n\nThese languages are classified in three groups:\n\n\nApart from Comanche, each of these groups contains one language spoken in a small area in the southern Sierra Nevada and valleys to the east (Mono, Timbisha, and Kawaiisu), and one language spoken in a much larger area extending to the north and east (Northern Paiute, Shoshoni, and Colorado River). Some linguists have taken this pattern as an indication that Numic speaking peoples expanded quite recently from a small core, perhaps near the Owens Valley, into their current range. This view is supported by lexicostatistical studies. Fowler's reconstruction of Proto-Numic ethnobiology also points to the region of the southern Sierra Nevada as the homeland of Proto-Numic approximately two millennia ago. Recent mitochondrial DNA studies have supported this linguistic hypothesis. The anthropologist Peter N. Jones thinks this evidence to be of a circumstantial nature, but this is a distinctly minority opinion among specialists in Numic. David Shaul has proposed that the Southern Numic languages spread eastward long before the Central and Western Numic languages expanded into the Great Basin.\n\nBands of eastern Shoshoni split off from the main Shoshoni body in the very late 17th or very early 18th century and moved southeastward onto the Great Plains. Changes in their Shoshoni dialect eventually produced Comanche. The Comanche language and the Shoshoni language are quite similar although certain low-level consonant changes in Comanche have inhibited mutual intelligibility.\n\nRecent lexical and grammatical diffusion studies in Western Numic have shown that while there are clear linguistic changes that separate Northern Paiute as a distinct linguistic variety, there are no unique linguistic changes that mark Mono as a distinct linguistic variety.\n\nThe sound system of Numic is set forth in the following tables.\n\nProto-Numic had an inventory of five vowels.\nProto-Numic had the following consonant inventory:\nIn addition to the above simple consonants, Proto-Numic also had nasal-stop/affricate clusters and all consonants except , , , and could be geminated. Between vowels short consonants were lenited.\n\nThe major difference between Proto-Central Numic and Proto-Numic was the phonemic split of Proto-Numic geminate consonants into geminate consonants and preaspirated consonants. The conditioning factors involve stress shifts and are complex. The preaspirated consonants surfaced as voiceless fricatives, often preceded by a voiceless vowel.\n\nShoshoni and Comanche have both lost the velar nasals, merging them with or turning them into velar nasal-stop clusters. In Comanche, nasal-stop clusters have become simple stops, but and from these clusters do not lenite intervocalically. This change postdates the earliest record of Comanche from 1786, but precedes the 20th century. Geminated stops in Comanche have also become phonetically preaspirated.\n\nProto-Southern Numic preserved the Proto-Numic consonant system fairly intact, but the individual languages have undergone several changes.\n\nModern Kawaiisu has reanalyzed the nasal-stop clusters as voiced stops, although older recordings preserve some of the clusters. Geminated stops and affricates are voiceless and non-geminated stops and affricates are voiced fricatives. The velar nasals have fallen together with the alveolar nasals.\n\nThe dialects of Colorado River east of Chemehuevi have lost . The dialects east of Kaibab have collapsed the nasal-stop clusters with the geminated stops and affricate.\n\nProto-Western Numic changed the nasal-stop clusters of Proto-Numic into voiced geminate stops. In Mono and all dialects of Northern Paiute except Southern Nevada, these voiced geminate stops have become voiceless.\n\nThe following table shows some sample Numic cognate sets that illustrate the above changes. Forms in the daughter languages are written in a broad phonetic transcription rather than a phonemic transcription that sometimes masks the differences between the forms. Italicized vowels and sonorants are voiceless.\n"}

The dance company constructed around her, , was in residence at La Monnaie in Brussels from 1992 to 2007.\n\nDe Keersmaeker did not study dance until her last year of high school, instead studying music, specifically the flute. She studied from 1978 to 1980 at Mudra in Brussels, a school with links to La Monnaie and to Maurice Béjart's Ballet of the 20th Century. She has said that the percussionist and her music teacher at MUDRA, , was a major influence on her. In 1981, she attended the Tisch School of the Arts at New York University. While at the Tisch she presented her first production, \"Asch\" (1980), in Brussels. In 1982 upon her return from the U.S.A. she created \", four movements to the music of Steve Reich\". It was this production that brought her \"a breakthrough on the international dance scene, performing, among other places, at the Avignon Festival\".\n\nThe success of \"Fase\" contributed largely to the foundation of the Rosas in 1983. \"Rosas danst Rosas\" - Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker's first choreography for the young company to new compositions of Thierry De Mey and Peter Vermeersch - brought Rosas the international breakthrough as a company. During the eighties, Rosas was supported by Kaaitheater of Brussels (director Hugo De Greef). Within the framework of Kaaitheater, her oeuvre took shape. Performances such as \"Elena's Aria\" (1984), \"Bartók\"/\"Aantekeningen\" (1986), a staging of \"Heiner Müller's triptych Verkommenes Ufer\"/\"Medeamaterial Landschaft mit Argonauten\" (1987), \"Mikrokosmos-Monument Selbstporträt mit Reich und Riley (und Chopin ist auch dabei)\"/\"In zart fliessender Bewegung - Quatuor Nr.4\", (1987), \"Ottone, Ottone\" (1988), \"Stella\" (1990) and \"Achterland\" (1990) were produced in collaboration with Kaaitheater.\n\nIn 1992, La Monnaie's general director Bernard Foccroulle invited Rosas to become the resident company of Brussels' Royal Opera \"De Munt\"/\"La Monnaie\". At the start of the residency, Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker set herself three objectives: to intensify the relation between dance and music, to build a repertory, and to launch a dance school (after the disappearance of MUDRA from Brussels in 1988). That year, Rosas created ERTS and released \"Rosa\" - a film of a choreography by Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker to Bartók music directed by Peter Greenaway. Later that year, Rosas created \"Mozart Concert Arias, un moto di gioia\" for the Avignon Festival. A production made in collaboration with the Orchestre des Champs Elysées, directed by Philippe Herreweghe. In 1993, Rosas created \"Toccata\", to the music of J.S. Bach, for the Holland Festival. In May 1994, the KunstenFESTIVALdes Arts in Brussels premièred \"Kinok\", produced in collaboration with Thierry De Mey and the Ictus Ensemble. At the end of 1994, this collaboration resulted in a new creation: \"Amor Constante más allá de la muerte\". In November 1995, La Monnaie premièred \"Verklärte Nacht\", a choreography that was part of a production of Schönberg music \"Erwartung\"/\"Verklärte Nacht\".\n\nIn 1995, Rosas and La Monnaie launched in Brussels a new international school for contemporary dance, the Performing Arts Research and Training Studios (PARTS), where sixty students coming from some 25 countries are trained, over a three-year period, by more than 50 teachers.\n\nIn December 1996, \"Woud\", three movements to the music of Berg, Schönberg & Wagner was premièred in Seville. At the beginning of 1997, Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker created, together with Steve Paxton and The Wooster Group, 3 solos for Vincent Dunoyer. In November 1997, \"Just Before\", to a live performance by the Ictus Ensemble of music composed by Magnus Lindberg, John Cage, Iannis Xenakis, Steve Reich, Pierre Bartholomée and Thierry De Mey, was presented in La Monnaie. In February 1998, Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker made her debut as an opera director at La Monnaie with Bartók's \"Duke Bluebeard's Castle\". In August 1998, the Impuls Festival in Vienna premièred \"Drumming\", a production to Steve Reich's composition of the same name. In November Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker created \"The Lisbon Piece\", for the Portuguese Companhia Nacional de Bailado: her first experience as a guest choreographer. In March 1999, Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker created, together with Rosas dancer Cynthia Loemij and Jolente De Keersmaeker and Frank Vercruyssen from the theatre company STAN, \"Quartett\"; a dance-theatre performance based on the text by Heiner Müller. One month later, she choreographed and danced a duet with Elizabeth Corbett for the production \"with/for/by\". In May 1999, Rosas premiered \"I said I\", a collaboration with Jolente De Keersmaeker for the direction, with the Ictus Ensemble, Aka Moon and DJ Grazzhoppa for the music composition and execution. Jan Joris Lamers designed the set and lighting and Dries van Noten the costumes. For \"In Real Time\" in 2000, Rosas again collaborated with Stan, as well as with the jazz-ensemble Aka Moon for the composition and live interpretation of the music.\nIn January 2001, Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker created \"Rain\", another performance to a score by Steve Reich, his \"Music for 18 Musicians\".\n2002 saw the celebration of twenty years of Rosas and ten years of residence at La Monnaie, with the re-run of the text-pieces, the creation of \"(but if a look should) April me\" and \"Rain live\", the two latter accompanied by Brussels contemporary music ensemble Ictus. A 336 pages book \"Rosas, if and only if wonder\" was published and a multimedia exhibition was organised in newly opened halls at the Centre for Fine Arts, Brussels, and was attended by over 15,000 people. \"Once\", a solo to the music of Joan Baez, concluded the celebration year's performances.\n2003 showed yet a new evolution: whereas in the past her choreographies had been very precise and closely linked to the music, in \"Bitches Brew / Tacoma Narrows\", De Keersmaeker for the first time allowed improvisation by her dancers during the performance.\n\nOver the past years, Rosas has also revived several earlier pieces: \"Rosas danst Rosas\", \"\", \"Mikrokosmos\", \"Achterland\" and others. Rosas' productions have been invited by theatres and festivals across five continents.\n\nIn October 2011, De Keersmaeker publicly accused the R&B singer Beyoncé of plagiarising choreography from two Rosas pieces—\"Rosas Danst Rosas\" and \"Achterland\"—in the music video for the single \"Countdown\".\n\nBoth the performances and the films of Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker have been distinguished by various international awards. \"Rosas danst Rosas\" won the Bessie Award (1987), \"Mikrokosmos\" received a Japanese Dance Award for the best foreign production (1989), \"Stella\" got the London Dance and Performances Award (1989), \"Drumming\" was prized with the Golden Laurel Wreath for the best choreography in Sarajevo (October 1998). In 2011, she received the American Dance Festival Award for her career and at this occasion presented one of her seminal work \"Rosas danst Rosas\" (1983).\n\nThe film \"Hoppla!\" was awarded a Sole d'Oro in Italy and the Grand Prix Vidéo Danse in Sète (1989). The film \"Rosa\" has been distinguished by a Dance Screen Award, got a Special Jury Commendation in the Black and White Short Film Competition at the Film Festival in Cork and was selected for the 49th Mostra Interazionale d'Arte Cinematografica in Venice (1992). In 1994 in Lyon a Dance Screen Award was offered to the film \"Achterland\" (1994), while the film \"Rosas danst Rosas\" obtained the Grand Prix International Vidéo Danse in 1997 and the special prize of the Jury of the International Festival of Film and New Media on Art in Athens in 1998. In 2000, the short film \"Tippeke\" got the Grand Prix Carina Ari of the Festival International Media Dance in Boulogne-Billancourt.\nFurthermore, in June 1995, Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker received the title of Doctor Honoris Causa at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel. In March 1996 the government of the province of Antwerp awarded her the Eugène Baie prize, and in May 2000 she was awarded by the French Republic the \"Officier dans l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres\" title. In 2002 she received the annual award of the Gabriella Moortgat Stichting and la médaille de Vermeil from the City of Paris and a medal ('Erepenning') of the Belgian Flemish government. In 2004 she was awarded the \"Keizer Karelprijs\" by the province of Oost Vlaanderen. In 2008, she became—again in France—\"\"Commandeur\" de l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1841795", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1841795", "title": "Strike rate", "text": "Strike rate\n\nStrike rate refers to two different statistics in the sport of cricket. Batting strike rate is a measure of how quickly a batsman achieves the primary goal of batting, namely scoring runs. Bowling strike rate is a measure of how quickly a bowler achieves the primary goal of bowling, namely taking wickets (i.e. getting batsmen out).\n\nBoth strike rates are relatively new statistics, having only been invented and considered of importance after the introduction of One Day International cricket in the 1970s.\n\nBatting strike rate (s/r) is defined for a batsman as the average number of runs scored per 100 balls faced. The higher the strike rate, the more effective a batsman is at scoring quickly.\n\nIn Test cricket, a batsman's strike rate is of secondary relevance to his ability to score runs without getting out. This means a Test batsman's most important statistic is generally considered to be his batting average, rather than his strike rate.\n\nIn limited overs cricket, strike rates are of considerably more importance. Since each team only faces a limited number of balls in an innings, the faster a batsman scores, the more runs his team will be able to accumulate. Strike rates of over 150 are becoming common in Twenty20 cricket. Strike rate is probably considered by most as the key factor in a batsman in one day cricket. Accordingly, the batsmen with the higher strike rate, especially in Twenty20 matches, are more valued than those with a lesser strike rate.\n\nBowling strike rate is defined for a bowler as the average number of balls bowled per wicket taken. The lower the strike rate, the more effective a bowler is at taking wickets quickly.\n\nAlthough introduced as a statistic complementary to the batting strike rate during the ascension of one-day cricket in the 1980s, bowling strike rates are arguably of more importance in Test cricket than One-day Internationals. This is because the primary goal of a bowler in Test cricket is to take wickets, whereas in a one-day match it is often sufficient to bowl economically - giving away as few runs as possible even if this means taking fewer wickets.\n"}

It is one of the few remaining inland, open-air salt-water swimming pools in the UK.\n\nThe Lido was originally built in the 1930s and the building features an art-deco style interior. The pool itself was filled with diluted brine, pumped from brine streams beneath the town. The salt in the water was strong enough to keep the water in the pool aseptic, without the need for additional chemicals such as chlorine.\n\nWhen the lido opened, it was marketed as the 'seaside come to Droitwich Spa', and the pool was heated to exactly the same temperature as the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nDuring the Second World War, the lido was closed, and its offices used by the military.\n\nThe lido continued to be a popular tourist attraction. Even after its closure at the end of the 1990s, people still travelled for miles just to see the once-popular pool.\n\nIn late 2004, Wychavon District Council voted against the re-opening of the lido, which sparked a local campaign group to form, with the sole aim of seeing the lido restored. Called \"Save a Lido Today\" (SALT), the group put pressure on the various councils and even went so far as to provide a business plan.\n\nIn April 2005, the people of Droitwich Spa held a parish poll in which 98% of the people who voted were in favour of restoring the Lido. Following this, SALT continued to work with the District and Town councils to restore the Lido to a working condition.\n\nIn the summer of 2007, the Lido reopened. One of the schools in Droitwich, Westacre Middle School, was the first to be able to go into the pool. Although the diving area has been filled-in to lower the water heating costs, the original 1930s fascia was left intact and the water still uses the salt that is the reason for the existence of Droitwich Spa itself.\n\n"}

It is administratively a subsidiary of the Université Grenoble Alpes.\n\nThe Institut d'études politiques of Grenoble was founded in 1948 on the model of Sciences Po Paris with the mission of providing France with public and private sector executives as well as specialists in the different fields of the social sciences. Its courses and degrees are modeled under the supervision of the National Foundation of Political Sciences. Since May 2012, Jean-Charles Froment has held the position of president (the former president was Olivier Ihl).\n\nAlike other IEP (Institutes of Political Science) it differs from the bulk of French universities by its elitist nature - having a selective entrance exam, and the plural-disciplinary curriculum it provides its students with. This highly selective undergraduate entrance exam has a typical acceptance rate of no more than 12% (it was around 11% in 2011). Because of this Sciences Po Grenoble is considered to be a \"grande école\".\n\nThe entrance exam comprises two different tests: The first one is made up of an essay and two short questions on a book chosen by the IEP (In 2014 the book chosen was Maxim Leo's \"Red Love: The Story of an East German Family\"; The second test is an English level examination consisting of an essay and a written comprehension.\n\nOf the around 200 students admitted each year, half have just finished high school while the other half have spent a year preparing for the exam after their high school graduation. The IEP also has a special program for admitting underprivileged students and high level athletes which pass the entrance examination and an interview.\n\nThe plural-disciplinary curriculum the IEP provides has the objective of giving students a strong knowledge in the different fields of the social sciences and thus equip these students with a large cultural foundation enabling them to be more flexible in adapting themselves no matter the field they decide to work in.\n\nThe first 3 years of the Sciences Po Program are the most diverse as courses in Political Science, Economics, Public Law, History, International Relations and Sociology are taught as well as a minimum of two foreign languages. In the second year of the 3 year undergraduate Program IEP students are sent abroad as exchange students and as they come back, specialize in one of the three sections the IEP proposes in the 3rd year of its curriculum. Following the 3rd year, students must choose and be accepted into the masters program they desire - which lasts two additional years. Although some students leave the IEP at the term of their 3rd year, new students are admitted from other universities at the masters level.\n\nThe IEP has only 1200 students : 800 \"diploma\" students (following the main course in 5 years: the Diploma of the IEP), 250 postgraduate students and 150 foreign students. The means of the IEP are nonetheless sizeable. Both in terms of staff (170 teachers, 65 researchers) and resources (there are twice as many computers in the IEP as in the neighbouring Grenoble II University).\n\nWhile the IEP of Bordeaux is prominent for its training of high-ranking civil servants, and the IEP of Lille for its specialty in International Relations, the IEP of Grenoble is renowned for its different masters programs in political science, middle eastern studies and international relations. The IEP-Grenoble is home to the Centre d'Informatisation des Données Socio-Politiques (CIDSP), one of the most dynamic research centres in political science in France. Grenoble is also known for its studies in cultural policies, European policies, private and public management.\n\nSeveral of the IEP's teachers are well known in France and abroad. Jean-Louis Quermonne, now an honorary teacher, is one of the leading political scientists in France. Pierre Bréchon, former director of the IEP and head of the CIDSP is a French specialist of quantitative studies.\n\nMany professors are non-academics who come with their professional from diverse professional backgrounds. This is especially the case for Masters level classes which are taught in coordination with other schools, among which the well established business school Grenoble école de management or the Grenoble School of Journalism.\n\nAlumni from the IEP have various careers. The IEP has a broad curriculum which can lead to a diversity many professional paths. Grenoble alumni include politicians, lawyers, high-ranking civil servants, executives, entrepreneurs and even artists.\n\nA complete listing of the IEP's teachers is available on the Institute's website.\n\nIn 2012, the school administration banned all parties in the beginning the school year because of repeated hazing incidents that had occurred the preceding years (involving alcohol-induced comas and sexual assaults).\n\n\n\nThe IEP Grenoble has a wide international outreach (considering its small size) with a hundred partner universities around the world, among which the University of Edinburgh, New York University, the University of North Carolina, Trinity College, Dublin, Waseda University, Sophia University, Bologna University, the University of British Columbia and many others.\nMost students spend a full year abroad where they earn credits that are fully part of their curriculum.\n\n"}

It is considered Critically Endangered due to accelerating habitat loss.\n\nGrey to white in colour and lacking stripes, the Mekong giant catfish is distinguished from other large catfish species in the river by the near-total lack of barbels and the absence of teeth. The Mekong giant catfish once held the \"Guinness World Records\"' position for the world's largest freshwater fish in 2005. Attaining an unconfirmed length of , the Mekong giant catfish grows extremely quickly, reaching a mass of in six years. It can reportedly weigh up to . The largest catch recorded in Thailand since record-keeping began in 1981 was a female measuring in length and weighing . This specimen, caught in 2005, is widely recognized as the largest freshwater fish ever caught (although the largest sturgeon species can far exceed this size, they are anadromous). Thai fisheries officials stripped the fish of its eggs as part of a breeding programme, intending then to release it, but the fish died in captivity and was sold as food to local villagers. Juvenile fish wear barbels that shrink as they age. Numbers of young fish are declining. Spawning fish in upper Cambodia are being over harvested. Larval fish are threatened by habitat fragmentation due to construction of dams which are becoming increasingly common.\n\nThe Mekong giant catfish is a threatened species in the Mekong, and conservationists have focused on it as a flagship species to promote conservation on the river. Although research projects are currently ongoing, relatively little is known about this species. Historically, the fish's natural range reached from the lower Mekong in Vietnam (above the tidally influenced brackish water of the river's delta) all the way to the northern reaches of the river in the Yunnan Province of China, spanning almost the entire length of the river. Due to threats, this species no longer inhabits the majority of its original habitat. It is now believed to only exist in small, isolated populations in the middle Mekong region. Fish congregate during the beginning of the rainy season and migrate upstream to spawn. They live primarily in the main channel of the river, where the water depth is over , while researchers, fishermen and officials have found this species in the Tonle Sap River and Lake in Cambodia, a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve. In the past, fishers have reported the fish in a number of the Mekong's tributaries. Today, however, essentially no sightings are reported outside of the main Mekong river channel and the Tonle Sap region.\n\nUnderstanding of the species’ migration pattern is incomplete. The fish are thought to rear primarily in the Mekong and Cambodia's Tonle Sap lake and migrate hundreds of miles north to spawning grounds in Thailand. Spawning fish in the upper Cambodia are being over harvested. Fragmentation caused by infrastructure development of dams are becoming increasingly common posing threats to larval fish and reducing breeding abilities. Overfishing, damming, destruction of spawning, and breeding grounds and siltation have taken a toll on the species' habitat.\n\nAs fry, this species feeds on zooplankton in the river and is known to be cannibalistic. After approximately one year, the fish becomes herbivorous, feeding on filamentous algae, probably ingesting larvae and periphyton accidentally. The fish likely obtains its food from algae growing on submerged rocky surfaces, as it does not have any sort of dentition. The Mekong giant catfish are toothless herbivores who lives off of the plants and algae in the river. The fish have been studied (inside the stomach linings) to feed on zooplankton and phytoplankton.\n\nEndemic to the lower half of the Mekong River, this catfish is in danger of extinction due to overfishing, as well as the decrease in water quality due to development and upstream damming. A 2018 study suggests that the Mekong stocks could fall up to 40% as the result of dam projects. The current IUCN Red List for fishes classes the species as Critically Endangered; the number living in the wild is unknown, but catch data indicate the population has fallen by 80 percent in the last 14 years. It is also listed in Appendix I of CITES, banning international trade involving wild-caught specimens.\n\nIn \"The Anthropologists' Cookbook\" (1977), Jessica Kuper noted the importance of the \"pa beuk\" to the Lao people and remarked, \"In times gone by, this huge fish, which is found only in the Mekong, was fairly plentiful, but in the last few years, the number taken annually has dwindled to forty, thirty or twenty, and perhaps in 1976 even fewer. This is sad, as it is a noble fish and a mysterious one, revered by the Lao.\" In 2000, fishers hauled out 11 giant catfish. In 2001 they caught seven. In 2002 they caught just five.\n\nFishing for the Mekong giant catfish is illegal in the wild in Thailand, Laos, and Cambodia, but the bans appear to be ineffective and the fish continue to be caught in all three countries. However, in recognition of the threat to the species, nearly 60 Thai fishermen agreed to stop catching the endangered catfish in June 2006, to mark the 60th anniversary of Bhumibol Adulyadej's ascension to the throne of Thailand. Thailand is the only country to allow fishing for private stocks of Mekong giant catfish. This helps save the species, as lakes purchase the small fry from the government breeding programme, generating extra income that allows the breeding program to function. Fishing lakes, such as Bueng Samran (บึงสำราญ) in Bangkok, have the species up to . The most common size landed is , although some companies specialise in landing the larger fish.\n\nThe species needs to reach to breed, and it does not breed in lakes. The Thailand Fisheries Department has instituted a breeding programme to restock the Mekong River. From 2000 to 2003, about 10,000 captive-bred specimens were released by the Thai authorities. Specimens are released into reservoirs rather than the Mekong River itself.\n\nThe Mekong giant catfish is described as a contemporary example of overharvest. Millions of tons of fish are harvested in Cambodia every year, with spawning fish being over-harvested. Fragmentation caused by dams increasingly poses threats to larval fish. Trends in water use, energy production, consumption and associated environmental degradation are projected to continue rising in southeast Asia. The Mekong giant catfish are highly migratory requiring large stretches of river for seasonal journeys and specific environmental conditions in their spawning and breeding areas.\n\nThe World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) works in partnership with other organizations including the Mekong River Commission and the Asian Development Bank which aims to ensure that environmental and social impacts are considered in developments of hydropower infrastructures. It also implements projects dedicated to conservation, research, monitoring and raising awareness of the Mekong giant catfish.\n\nIn Thai folklore, this fish is regarded with reverence, and special rituals are followed and offerings are made before fishing it. The species is represented as ancient art along the Mekong river.\n\n"}

His career was brief but prolific, including movie posters, album covers, and magazine covers. His portrait of comedian Lily Tomlin for the cover of \"Time\" is now part of the permanent collection at the Smithsonian Institution. He was associated with \"TV Guide\" for thirteen years.\n\nRichard Amsel was born in Philadelphia.\nShortly after graduating from Philadelphia College of Art, his proposed poster art for the Barbra Streisand musical \"Hello, Dolly!\" was selected by 20th Century Fox for the film’s campaign after a nationwide artists’ talent search; the artist was 22 at the time.\n\nAs Amsel came to the attention of New York's art enthusiasts, his illustrations caught the attention of Barry Manilow, \"then a young singer/songwriter named who was working with Bette Midler, a newly emerging entertainer in cabaret clubs and piano bars. Manilow introduced the two, and it was quickly decided that Amsel should do the cover of her first Atlantic Records album. The cover, for \"The Divine Miss M\" proved to be one of the most ubiquitous of the year.\" More album covers and posters soon followed, as did a series of magazine ads for designer Oleg Cassini.\n\nHis movie posters commissions included some of the most important and popular films of the 1970s, including \"The Champ\", \"Chinatown\", \"Julia\", \"The Last Picture Show\", \"The Last Tycoon\", \"The Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean\", \"McCabe & Mrs. Miller\", \"The Muppet Movie\", \"Murder on the Orient Express\", \"Nashville\", \"Papillon\", \"The Shootist\", and \"The Sting\". (The latter's poster design paid homage to the painting style of J. C. Leyendecker, evoking both his \"Arrow Collar Man\" and his covers for \"The Saturday Evening Post\".)\n\nAlthough his career was short-lived, his body of work was sizeable, outpacing much of what had been produced by others during his era. His portrait of comedian Lily Tomlin was featured on the cover of \"Time\", and is now housed in the permanent collection at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington D.C. In keeping with the magazine's stringent deadlines, Amsel's illustration was created in only two or three days.\n\nCommissioned by \"TV Guide\" in 1972 to design a cover featuring the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, in conjunction with a telefilm about their love affair, Amsel then went on to 13-year association with the publication, during which time he produced more than 40 covers.\n\nAmsel's magazine work included portraits of: Ingrid Bergman, Johnny Carson, Katharine Hepburn, Mary Tyler Moore, Elvis Presley, Nancy Reagan, Tom Selleck, Frank Sinatra, John Travolta, and Princess Grace, as well as of Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh, portraits which were created for the television debut of \"Gone with the Wind. He also created illustrations for the wedding of Prince Charles and Diana, Princess of Wales, and of Richard Chamberlain for the miniseries Shogun.\n\nAmong the most famous of Amsel's illustrations was his portrait of Lucille Ball, which was created for the magazine's July 6, 1974 issue in recognition of Ball's retirement from series television. \"I did not want the portrait to be of Lucy Ricardo,\" Amsel explained, \"but I didn't want a modern-day Lucy Carter either. I wanted it to have the same timeless sense of glamour that Lucy herself has. She is, after all, a former Goldwyn Girl. I hoped to capture the essence of all this.\" Ball then featured Amsel's work in the opening credits of a two-hour television tribute, \"CBS Salutes Lucy: The First 25 Years\".\nAs film studios changed their marketing style in the 1980s, employing photographs in favor of illustrations, Amsel and other artists were frequently limited to creating work for science fiction, fantasy, and adventure films. In response, Amsel created the posters for \"Flash Gordon\", \"The Dark Crystal\", and \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" which ultimately became his most famous work. Amsel completed two posters, one for \"Raiders\"' 1981 release and another, a year later, for its re-release. It has been reported that George Lucas and Steven Spielberg own the originals.\n\nRegarding commercial art, Amsel stated, \"Commercial art can be and sometimes is art, but if someone hangs a poster, it is still a poster pretending to be something it's not. My work is basically for the printed page, and not for hanging in living rooms... If, however, I paint or draw something that takes people into the realm of fantasy, then I feel that I've accomplished something.\"\n\nDuring his career, Amsel received multiple awards, including the New York and Los Angeles Society of Illustrators award, a Golden Key Award from The Hollywood Reporter, and a Grammy Award, as well as citations from the Philadelphia Art Director's Club. Amsel's covers were also shown at the Museum of Television and Radio in Beverly Hills, commemorating \"TV Guide\"'s fortieth anniversary.\n\nPosthumously awarded the University of the Art's Silver Star award for Outstanding Alumni in 2009, Amsel's award was accepted on his behalf at The University of the Arts Commencement Ceremony by his brother, Michael Amsel.\n\nA feature film documentary about Amsel's life, tentatively titled \"Amsel: Illustrator of the Lost Art,\" was announced in January 2016.\n\nHis last film poster was for \"Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome\", the third of George Miller's apocalyptic action movies with Mel Gibson.\n\nHis final completed artwork was for an issue of \"TV Guide\", featuring news anchors Tom Brokaw, Peter Jennings and Dan Rather. Amsel died less than three weeks later, succumbing to complications from AIDS on November 17, 1985. When he fell ill, he was to have done the poster for the \"Romancing the Stone\" sequel, \"The Jewel of the Nile\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1841851", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1841851", "title": "Stereopsis", "text": "Stereopsis\n\nStereopsis (from the Greek στερεο- \"stereo-\" meaning \"solid\", and ὄψις \"opsis\", \"appearance, sight\") is a term that is most often used to refer to the perception of depth and 3-dimensional structure obtained on the basis of visual information deriving from two eyes by individuals with normally developed binocular vision. Because the eyes of humans, and many animals, are located at different lateral positions on the head, binocular vision results in two slightly different images projected to the retinas of the eyes. The differences are mainly in the relative horizontal position of objects in the two images. These positional differences are referred to as horizontal disparities or, more generally, binocular disparities. Disparities are processed in the visual cortex of the brain to yield depth perception. While binocular disparities are naturally present when viewing a real 3-dimensional scene with two eyes, they can also be simulated by artificially presenting two different images separately to each eye using a method called stereoscopy. The perception of depth in such cases is also referred to as \"stereoscopic depth\".\n\nThe perception of depth and 3-dimensional structure is, however, possible with information visible from one eye alone, such as differences in object size and motion parallax (differences in the image of an object over time with observer movement), though the impression of depth in these cases is often not as vivid as that obtained from binocular disparities.\nTherefore, the term stereopsis (or stereoscopic depth) can also refer specifically to the unique impression of depth associated with binocular vision; what is colloquially referred to as seeing \"in 3D\".\n\nIt has been suggested that the impression of \"real\" separation in depth is linked to the precision with which depth is derived, and that a conscious awareness of this precision – perceived as an impression of interactability and realness – may help guide the planning of motor action.\n\nThere are two distinct aspects to stereopsis: coarse stereopsis and fine stereopsis, and provide depth information of different degree of spatial and temporal precision. \n\nThe stereopsis which an individual can achieve is limited by the level of visual acuity of the poorer eye. In particular, patients who have comparatively lower visual acuity tend to need relatively larger spatial frequencies to be present in the input images, else they cannot achieve stereopsis. Fine stereopsis requires both eyes to have a good visual acuity in order to detect small spatial differences, and is easily disrupted by early visual deprivation. There are indications that in the course of the development of the visual system in infants, coarse stereopsis may develop before fine stereopsis and that coarse stereopsis guides the vergence movements which are needed in order for fine stereopsis to develop in a subsequent stage. Furthermore, there are indications that coarse stereopsis is the mechanism that keeps the two eyes aligned after strabismus surgery.\n\nIt has also been suggested to distinguish between two different types of stereoscopic depth perception: \"static depth perception\" (or static stereo perception) and \"motion-in-depth perception\" (or stereo motion perception). Some individuals who have strabismus and show no depth perception using static stereotests (in particular, using Titmus tests, see this article's section on \"contour stereotests\") do perceive motion in depth when tested using dynamic random dot stereograms. One study found the combination of motion stereopsis and no static stereopsis to be present only in exotropes, not in esotropes.\n\nThere are strong indications that the stereoscopic mechanism consists of at least two perceptual mechanisms, possibly three. Coarse and fine stereopsis are processed by two different physiological subsystems, with a coarse stereopsis being derived from diplopic stimuli (that is, stimuli with disparities well beyond the range of binocular fusion) and yielding only a vague impression of depth magnitude. Coarse stereopsis appears to be associated with the magno pathway which processes low spatial frequency disparities and motion, and fine stereopsis with the parvo pathway which processes high spatial frequency disparities. The coarse stereoscopic system seems to be able to provide residual binocular depth information in some individuals who lack fine stereopsis. Individuals have been found to integrate the various stimuli, for example stereoscopic cues and motion occlusion, in different ways.\n\nHow the brain combines the different cues – including stereo, motion, vergence angle and monocular cues – for sensing motion in depth and 3D object position is an area of active research in vision science and neighboring disciplines.\n\nNot everyone has the same ability to see using stereopsis. One study shows that 97.3% are able to distinguish depth at horizontal disparities of 2.3 minutes of arc or smaller, and at least 80% could distinguish depth at horizontal differences of 30 seconds of arc.\n\nStereopsis has a positive impact on exercising practical tasks such as needle-threading, ball-catching (especially in fast ball games), pouring liquids, and others. Professional activity may involve operating stereoscopic instruments such as a binocular microscope. While some of these tasks may profit from compensation of the visual system by means of other depth cues, there are some roles for which stereopsis is imperative. Occupations requiring the precise judgment of distance sometimes include a requirement to demonstrate some level of stereopsis; in particular, there is such a requirement for airplane pilots (even if the first pilot to fly around the world alone, Wiley Post, accomplished his feat with monocular vision only.) Also surgeons normally demonstrate high stereo acuity. As to car driving, a study found a positive impact of stereopsis in specific situations at intermediate distances only; furthermore, a study on elderly persons found that glare, visual field loss, and useful field of view were significant predictors of crash involvement, whereas the elderly persons' values of visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, and stereoacuity were not associated with crashes.\n\nBinocular vision has further advantages aside from stereopsis, in particular the enhancement of vision quality through binocular summation; persons with strabismus (even those who have no double vision) have lower scores of binocular summation, and this appears to incite persons with strabismus to close one eye in visually demanding situations.\n\nIt has long been recognized that full binocular vision, including stereopsis, is an important factor in the stabilization of post-surgical outcome of strabismus corrections. Many persons lacking stereopsis have (or have had) visible strabismus, which is known to have a potential socioeconomic impact on children and adults. In particular, both large-angle and small-angle strabismus can negatively affect self-esteem, as it interferes with normal eye contact, often causing embarrassment, anger, and feelings of awkwardness. For further details on this, see psychosocial effects of strabismus.\n\nIt has been noted that with the growing introduction of 3D display technology in entertainment and in medical and scientific imaging, high quality binocular vision including stereopsis may become a key capability for success in modern society.\n\nNonetheless, there are indications that the lack of stereo vision may lead persons to compensate by other means: in particular, stereo blindness may give people an advantage when depicting a scene using monocular depth cues of all kinds, and among artists there appear to be a disproportionately high number of persons lacking stereopsis. In particular, a case has been made that Rembrandt may have been stereoblind.\n\nStereopsis was first explained by Charles Wheatstone in 1838: “… the mind perceives an object of three dimensions by means of the two dissimilar pictures projected by it on the two retinæ …”. He recognized that because each eye views the visual world from slightly different horizontal positions, each eye's image differs from the other. Objects at different distances from the eyes project images in the two eyes that differ in their horizontal positions, giving the depth cue of horizontal disparity, also known as retinal disparity and as binocular disparity. Wheatstone showed that this was an effective depth cue by creating the illusion of depth from flat pictures that differed only in horizontal disparity. To display his pictures separately to the two eyes, Wheatstone invented the stereoscope.\n\nLeonardo da Vinci had also realized that objects at different distances from the eyes project images in the two eyes that differ in their horizontal positions, but had concluded only that this made it impossible for a painter to portray a realistic depiction of the depth in a scene from a single canvas. Leonardo chose for his near object a column with a circular cross section and for his far object a flat wall. Had he chosen any other near object, he might have discovered horizontal disparity of its features. His column was one of the few objects that projects identical images of itself in the two eyes.\n\nStereoscopy became popular during Victorian times with the invention of the prism stereoscope by David Brewster. This, combined with photography, meant that tens of thousands of stereograms were produced.\n\nUntil about the 1960s, research into stereopsis was dedicated to exploring its limits and its relationship to singleness of vision. Researchers included Peter Ludvig Panum, Ewald Hering, Adelbert Ames Jr., and Kenneth N. Ogle.\n\nIn the 1960s, Bela Julesz invented random-dot stereograms. Unlike previous stereograms, in which each half image showed recognizable objects, each half image of the first random-dot stereograms showed a square matrix of about 10,000 small dots, with each dot having a 50% probability of being black or white. No recognizable objects could be seen in either half image. The two half images of a random-dot stereogram were essentially identical, except that one had a square area of dots shifted horizontally by one or two dot diameters, giving horizontal disparity. The gap left by the shifting was filled in with new random dots, hiding the shifted square. Nevertheless, when the two half images were viewed one to each eye, the square area was almost immediately visible by being closer or farther than the background. Julesz whimsically called the square a Cyclopean image after the mythical Cyclops who had only one eye. This was because it was as though we have a cyclopean eye inside our brains that can see cyclopean stimuli hidden to each of our actual eyes. Random-dot stereograms highlighted a problem for stereopsis, the correspondence problem. This is that any dot in one half image can realistically be paired with many same-coloured dots in the other half image. Our visual systems clearly solve the correspondence problem, in that we see the intended depth instead of a fog of false matches. Research began to understand how.\n\nAlso in the 1960s, Horace Barlow, Colin Blakemore, and Jack Pettigrew found neurons in the cat visual cortex that had their receptive fields in different horizontal positions in the two eyes. This established the neural basis for stereopsis. Their findings were disputed by David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel, although they eventually conceded when they found similar neurons in the monkey visual cortex. In the 1980s, Gian Poggio and others found neurons in V2 of the monkey brain that responded to the depth of random-dot stereograms.\n\nIn the 1970s, Christopher Tyler invented autostereograms, random-dot stereograms that can be viewed without a stereoscope. This led to the popular Magic Eye pictures.\n\nIn 1989 Antonio Medina Puerta demonstrated with photographs that retinal images with no parallax disparity but with different shadows are fused stereoscopically, imparting depth perception to the imaged scene. He named the phenomenon \"shadow stereopsis\". Shadows are therefore an important, stereoscopic cue for depth perception. He showed how effective the phenomenon is by taking two photographs of the Moon at different times, and therefore with different shadows, making the Moon to appear in 3D stereoscopically, despite the absence of any other stereoscopic cue.\n\nA stereoscope is a device by which each eye can be presented with different images, allowing stereopsis to be stimulated with two pictures, one for each eye. This has led to various crazes for stereopsis, usually prompted by new sorts of stereoscopes. In Victorian times it was the prism stereoscope (allowing stereo photographs to be viewed), while in the 1920s it was red-green glasses (allowing stereo movies to be viewed). In 1939 the concept of the prism stereoscope was reworked into the technologically more complex View-Master, which remains in production today. In the 1950s polarizing glasses allowed stereopsis of coloured movies. In the 1990s Magic Eye pictures (autostereograms) - which did not require a stereoscope, but relied on viewers using a form of free fusion so that each eye views different images - were introduced.\n\nStereopsis appears to be processed in the visual cortex of mammals in binocular cells having receptive fields in different horizontal positions in the two eyes. Such a cell is active only when its preferred stimulus is in the correct position in the left eye and in the correct position in the right eye, making it a disparity detector.\n\nWhen a person stares at an object, the two eyes converge so that the object appears at the center of the retina in both eyes. Other objects around the main object appear shifted in relation to the main object. In the following example, whereas the main object (dolphin) remains in the center of the two images in the two eyes, the cube is shifted to the right in the left eye's image and is shifted to the left when in the right eye's image.\n\nBecause each eye is in a different horizontal position, each has a slightly different perspective on a scene yielding different retinal images. Normally two images are not observed, but rather a single view of the scene, a phenomenon known as singleness of vision. Nevertheless, stereopsis is possible with double vision. This form of stereopsis was called \"qualitative stereopsis\" by Kenneth Ogle.\n\nIf the images are very different (such as by going cross-eyed, or by presenting different images in a stereoscope) then one image at a time may be seen, a phenomenon known as binocular rivalry.\n\nThere is a hysteresis effect associated with stereopsis. Once fusion and stereopsis have stabilized, fusion and stereopsis can be maintained even if the two images are pulled apart slowly and symmetrically to a certain extent in the horizontal direction. In the vertical direction, there is a similar but smaller effect. This effect, first demonstrated on a random dot stereogram, was initially interpreted as an extension of Panum's fusional area. Later it was shown that the hysteresis effect reaches far beyond Panum's fusional area, and that stereoscopic depth can be perceived in random-line stereograms despite the presence of cyclodisparities of about 15 deg, and this has been interpreted as stereopsis with diplopia.\n\nUnder normal circumstances, the depth specified by stereopsis agrees with other depth cues, such as motion parallax (when an observer moves while looking at one point in a scene, the \"fixation point\", points nearer and farther than the fixation point appear to move against or with the movement, respectively, at velocities proportional to the distance from the fixation point), and pictorial cues such as superimposition (nearer objects cover up farther objects) and familiar size (nearer objects appear bigger than farther objects). However, by using a stereoscope, researchers have been able to oppose various depth cues including stereopsis. The most drastic version of this is pseudoscopy, in which the half-images of stereograms are swapped between the eyes, reversing the binocular disparity. Wheatstone (1838) found that observers could still appreciate the overall depth of a scene, consistent with the pictorial cues. The stereoscopic information went along with the overall depth.\n\nComputer stereo vision is a part of the field of computer vision. It is sometimes used in mobile robotics to detect obstacles. Example applications include the ExoMars Rover and surgical robotics.\n\nTwo cameras take pictures of the same scene, but they are separated by a distance – exactly like our eyes. A computer compares the images while shifting the two images together over top of each other to find the parts that match. The shifted amount is called the disparity. The disparity at which objects in the image best match is used by the computer to calculate their distance.\n\nFor a human, the eyes change their angle according to the distance to the observed object. To a computer this represents significant extra complexity in the geometrical calculations (epipolar geometry). In fact the simplest geometrical case is when the camera image planes are on the same plane. The images may alternatively be converted by reprojection through a linear transformation to be on the same image plane. This is called image rectification.\n\nComputer stereo vision with many cameras under fixed lighting is called structure from motion. Techniques using a fixed camera and known lighting are called photometric stereo techniques, or \"shape from shading\".\n\nMany attempts have been made to reproduce human stereo vision on rapidly changing computer displays, and toward this end numerous patents relating to 3D television and cinema have been filed in the USPTO. At least in the US, commercial activity involving those patents has been confined exclusively to the grantees and licensees of the patent holders, whose interests tend to last for twenty years from the time of filing.\n\nDiscounting 3D television and cinema (which generally require more than one digital projector whose moving images are mechanically coupled, in the case of IMAX 3D cinema), several stereoscopic LCDs are going to be offered by Sharp, which has already started shipping a notebook with a built in stereoscopic LCD. Although older technology required the user to don goggles or visors for viewing computer-generated images, or CGI, newer technology tends to employ Fresnel lenses or plates over the liquid crystal displays, freeing the user from the need to put on special glasses or goggles.\n\nIn stereopsis tests (short: \"stereotests\"), slightly different images are shown to each eye, such that a 3D image is perceived in case stereovision is present. This can be achieved by means of vectographs (visible with polarized glasses), anaglyphs (visible with red-green glasses), lenticular lenses (visible with the naked eye), or head-mounted display technology. The type of changes from one eye to the other may differ depending on which level of stereoacuity is to be detected. A series of stereotests for selected levels thus constitutes a test of stereoacuity.\n\nThere are two types of common clinical tests for stereopsis and stereoacuity: random dot stereotests and contour stereotests. Random-dot stereopsis tests use pictures of stereo figures that are embedded in a background of random dots. Contour stereotests use pictures in which the targets presented to each eye are separated horizontally.\n\nThe ability of stereopsis can be tested by, for example, the \"Lang stereotest\", which consists of a random-dot stereogram upon which a series of parallel strips of cylindrical lenses are imprinted in certain shapes, which separate the views seen by each eye in these areas, similarly to a hologram. Without stereopsis, the image looks only like a field of random dots, but the shapes become discernible with increasing stereopsis, and generally consists of a cat (indicating that there is ability of stereopsis of 1200 seconds of arc of retinal disparity), a star (600 seconds of arc) and a car (550 seconds of arc). To standardize the results, the image should be viewed at a distance from the eye of 40 cm and exactly in the frontoparallel plane. There is no need to use special spectacles for such tests, thereby facilitating use in young children.\n\nExamples of contour stereotests are the Titmus stereotests, the most well-known example being the Titmus Fly Stereotest, where a picture of a fly is displayed with disparities on the edges. The patient uses a 3-D glasses to look at the picture and determine whether a 3-D figure can be seen. The amount of disparity in images vary, such as 400-100 sec of arc, and 800-40 sec arc.\n\nDeficiency in stereopsis can be complete (then called stereoblindness) or more or less impaired. Causes include blindness in one eye, amblyopia and strabismus.\n\nVision therapy is one of the treatments for people lacking in stereopsis. Vision therapy will allow individuals to enhance their vision through several exercises such as by strengthening and improving eye movement. There is recent evidence that stereoacuity may be improved in persons with amblyopia by means of perceptual learning (\"see also:\" treatment of amblyopia).\n\nThere is good evidence for stereopsis throughout the animal kingdom. It occurs in many mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibia, fish, crustaceans, spiders, and insects.\n\n"}

The title, a British idiom one might find in housing advertisements, is short for \"all modern conveniences\" and is a pun on the band's association with the mod revival. The album reached No. 6 in the UK Albums Chart.\n\nThe album was reissued in the US in 1979, with the song \"The Butterfly Collector\" replacing \"Billy Hunt\".\n\nFollowing the release of their second album, \"This Is the Modern World\", the Jam undertook a 1978 tour of the US supporting American rock band Blue Öyster Cult. The Jam were not well received on the tour and \"This Is the Modern World\" failed to reach the \"Billboard\" 200 chart. Under pressure from their record company, Polydor, to deliver a hit record, songwriter Paul Weller was suffering from writer's block when the band returned to the UK. Weller admitted to a lack of interest during the writing/recording process, and had to completely re-record a new set of songs for the album after producer Chris Parry rejected the first batch as being sub-standard. \"All Mod Cons\" was more commercially successful than \"This Is the Modern World\".\n\nBritish Invasion pop influences run through the album, most obviously in the cover of The Kinks' \"David Watts\". The single \"Down in the Tube Station at Midnight\", which Weller had originally discarded because he was unhappy with the song's arrangement, was rescued from the studio bin by producer Vic Coppersmith and became one of the band's most successful chart hits up to that point, peaking at number 15 on the UK Singles Chart. The song is a first-person narrative of a young man who walks into a tube station on the way home to his wife, and is beaten by far right thugs.

{"id": "1841896", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1841896", "title": "Army of the Pharaohs", "text": "Army of the Pharaohs\n\nArmy of the Pharaohs (most commonly abbreviated as AOTP or A.O.T.P.) is an American underground hip hop collective originating from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, formed by Jedi Mind Tricks MC Vinnie Paz in 1998. The collective has strong links to other underground east coast groups such as OuterSpace, Snowgoons, La Coka Nostra, Demigodz, 7L & Esoteric, and JuJu Mob. It has changed several times since its formation.\n\nPaz formed the outfit in the late 1990s with the original roster of Bahamadia, Chief Kamachi, Virtuoso, 7L & Esoteric, plus Jedi Mind Tricks' other member Stoupe the Enemy of Mankind. The group first released the \"Five Perfect Exertions\" and \"War Ensemble\" 12\" on Paz's short-lived Recordings in 1998, but then the underground supergroup remained silent for several years. After a couple of successful Jedi Mind Tricks albums and a new deal with Babygrande by 2003, Paz resurrected the crew, adding OuterSpace, Celph Titled, Reef the Lost Cauze, King Syze, Des Devious, and Apathy; however, Stoupe, Bahamadia, and Virtuoso had defected from the group. Babygrande issued their \"Tear It Down\" 12\" and first album, \"The Torture Papers\", in 2006. The 2007 follow-up album, Ritual of Battle, saw Jus Allah and JMT protégés Doap Nixon and Demoz joining the Pharaohs.\n\n\"The Unholy Terror\" was released on March 30, 2010. This album marked the return of Apathy and the addition of two new AOTP members, Block McCloud and Journalist. Two songs, \"Godzilla\" and \"Contra Mantra\", were released before the album. This album also marked the departure of Chief Kamachi who left the group because of business issues and an apparent feud with Vinnie Paz and Apathy.\n\nIn early 2011, Vinnie Paz announced on his Facebook page that \"In Death Reborn\" is due to be released in 2012, however the date was pushed back and almost seemed like it was never going to be released. Early in 2012, Houston underground MC VZilla and Connecticut's Blacastan were added to the group. Both artists have made names for themselves with their features and album releases in 2012. \"In Death Reborn\" was eventually released on April 22, 2014. The album featured members Vinnie Paz, Apathy, Blacastan, Block McCloud, Celph Titled, Demoz, Des Devious, Doap Nixon, Esoteric, Lawrence Arnell, King Magnetic, King Syze, OuterSpace, Reef the Lost Cauze and VZilla. Their fifth studio album, \"Heavy Lies the Crown\" was released on October 21, 2014.\n\nThe original incarnation of the group included five MCs: Vinnie Paz, Chief Kamachi, Esoteric, Virtuoso and Bahamadia, along with Jedi Mind Tricks producer [Stoupe the Enemy of Mankind]. The group released their debut EP/single \"The Five Perfect Exertions b/w War Ensemble\" in 1998. Both tracks were later included on Jedi Minds Tricks' 2000 album \"Violent by Design\"; with \"The Five Perfect Exertions\" being remixed into \"Exertions Remix\", and both \"Exertions\" and \"War Ensemble\" shedding Chief Kamachi's appearance. The Army Of The Pharaohs project was put on the back-burner while JMT's career took off. In 2003, AOTP released their debut compilation album \"Rare Shit, Collabos and Freestyles\". It contained various tracks from members of the group.\n\nThe group did not return until 2005, without Virtuoso and Bahamadia. The group was now composed of Paz, Kamachi, 7L & Esoteric, OuterSpace, Apathy, Celph Titled, Reef The Lost Cauze, Des Devious, King Syze and Faez One. After years of anticipation, the group recorded its first album, \"The Torture Papers\". It was released in March 2006 on Babygrande Records. The album was produced by AOTP affiliates such as DC the MIDI Alien, Undefined, Beyonder, Loptimist, and German producer Shuko. The album includes the singles \"Tear It Down\" and \"Battle Cry\", the former having a music video. The latter was a posse cut with nine of the group's then ten members. The album entered the top 50 on Billboard's Top Independent Album Chart, and reached #42 on the magazine's Heatseekers chart. An unofficial continuation of \"The Torture Papers\" soon began circulating around the Internet called \"The Bonus Papers\". It was composed of tracks not released on the album as it was thought that the songs didn't fit the artistic design of the album while others were known to have been extremely political and were possibly held back to reduce controversy.\n\nArmy of the Pharaohs released another mixtape in 2007 titled After Torture There's Pain. As the name suggests, it was released as an addition to their debut album; \"The Torture Papers\". The group's second album, \"Ritual of Battle\", was released on September 25, 2007. \"Ritual of Battle\"'s single, \"Bloody Tears\", used a sample taken from the soundtrack of the video game series Castlevania. The group added four new members for the album: Jedi Mind Tricks member Jus Allah, Doap Nixon, Demoz and King Magnetic. Apathy was not on \"Ritual of Battle\" as he was working on another project with Styles Of Beyond.\n\nIn 2008, Chief Kamachi of JuJu Mob left Army of the Pharaohs due to an apparent feud with Vinnie Paz and Apathy. He released a diss track titled \"First Warning\" taking aim at Paz and Apathy. Apparently, it started over an e-mail Apathy didn't respond to from Kamachi, what was written in the e-mail hasn't been disclosed. Chief Kamachi later went on to saying \"It wasn't nothing personal, it was more or less a business decision.\" On May 17, 2009, Apathy mentioned on his Myspace blog that a new AOTP album was completely finished. \"The Unholy Terror\" was released on March 30, 2010. This album marked the return of Apathy and the addition of two new AOTP members, Block McCloud and Journalist. Two songs, \"Godzilla\" and \"Contra Mantra\", were released before the album. This album also marked the departure of Chief Kamachi who left the group because of business issues.\n\nOn December 27, 2011, Paz announced on his Facebook page, \"Army of the Pharaohs - \"In Death Reborn\" - 2012\". Early in 2012, Houston underground MC V-Zilla and Connecticut's Blacastan (Demigodz) were added to the group. Both artists have\nmade names for themselves with their features and album releases in 2012. It has been said that the album will now be released in 2013 or later. Rumours speculated on Facebook saying that Reef the Lost Cauze would not appear on the album. However, on 27 Nov 2013 he tweeted how it's \"bullshit\" and he is going to be on the album.\nThe Army Of The Pharaohs will reunite for their fourth LP, \"In Death Reborn\". In April 2013, the official Facebook page of Army of the Pharaohs posted \"New album is not finished. Don't know when it will be finished. Will let you know when there's a release date. No need for further questions.\" On 27 June 2013, AOTP frontman; Vinnie Paz tweeted \"New solo EP. New Heavy Metal Kings. New Army of the Pharaohs. all coming within the next year.\"\n\nOn 4, October 2013, Apathy shared; \"\"Every AOTP album we've done in the past, we all handed in our verses via email and weren't too hands-on with. This one is different. Every day we've been emailing each other, going over songs... picking beats and showing each other our verses. This might be the best Pharaoh album yet. It definitely is the illest, lyrically. We're all having brotherly competition and trying to murder each other on these songs. It's great. Definite \"A\" game.\"\" On November 30, 2013, Vinnie Paz revealed that two new Army Of The Pharaohs albums would be released in 2014. \"In Death Reborn\" is slated for an April release, the second LP is expected to drop in November. On February 11, 2014, Celph Titled announced via Facebook that In Death Reborn would be released April 22, 2014.\n\nMany members of the group had released, or were working on, other projects around the time of \"In Death Reborn\". This period was dubbed \"The Pharaoh Season\". In promotion for \"In Death Reborn\", Vinnie Paz released \"The Flawless Victory\" mixtape on March 2, 2014. Reef the Lost Cauze released a collaboration album titled \"Fast Way\" alongside producer Emyd on March 9, 2014. Member Doap Nixon only appeared on the song \"7th Ghost\" from the album, however, he went on to say how he was only featured on one song because he had a lot of personal stuff going on and he is currently working on his fourth studio album \"Sour Diesel 2\", he stated that there will be more of him on the LP that is due to drop in November. King Syze released his fourth studio album a month before the album release on March 25 titled \"Union Terminology\", where he speaks out about working as a union trader. Apathy pushed back the release date of his upcoming album \"Connecticut Casual\" from April to June in favour of \"In Death Reborn\". Former Pharaoh Jus Allah didn't make an appearance on the album as he is currently working on his second studio album \"M.M.A. (Meanest Man Alive)\". A week before the release of \"In Death Reborn\", Zilla announced he was working on his fourth studio album titled \"Martyr Musick\" set to be released sometime June 2014.\n\nOn 6 August 2014, the content was published on the Jedi Mind Tricks website announcing the second AOTP album of the year \"Heavy Lies the Crown\" set for a release on 21 October 2014. Six months after In Death Reborn.\n\nAs of 2015, the group has been on a hiatus whilst they all focus on their solo careers and other ventures. In a 2018 poll, Jedi Mind Tricks, the group that spawned AOTP scored 43.64% in a comparison with rival hip hop group Slum Village, who scored 56.34% as the G.O.A.T. rap group in the fourth instalment of Ambrosia For Heads' annual battle series features.\n\nOn February 13, 2020, King Magnetic released his diss track towards Vinnie Paz entitled \"Be Quiet\", thus removing himself from the collective. The next day on February 14, 2020, Doap Nixon subsequently released another diss track towards Paz entitled \"Leg Shot\" on the same day as Paz's fourth studio album \"As Above So Below\", thus removing himself from the collective as well. Within their tracks, they both announced their departure from the supergroup. The issues between the pair and Paz supposedly started in 2009 with numerous trivial matters which were all squashed in 2015. Magnetic caught up with Paz after his 2016 Jedi Mind Tricks show in Albuquerque, New Mexico and agreed to put aside the differences they had. Unfortunately however, with Nixon's release of \"Sour Diesel II\", Paz threatened to remove his lyrics and track contributions on the album unless Nixon removed King Magnetic's verses from his album. This is what resulted in the releases of the diss track \"Be Quiet\" by Magnetic which was supposedly recorded many years earlier.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1841901", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1841901", "title": "Pluperfect", "text": "Pluperfect\n\nThe pluperfect (or plusquamperfect) is a type of verb form, generally treated as one of the tenses in certain languages, used to refer to an action at a time earlier than a time in the past already referred to. Examples in English are: \"we \"had\" arrived\"; \"they \"had\" written\".\n\nThe word derives from the Latin \"plus quam perfectum\", \"more than perfect\". The word \"perfect\" in this sense means \"completed\"; it contrasts with the \"imperfect\", which denotes uncompleted actions or states.\n\nIn English grammar, the equivalent of the pluperfect (a form such as \"had written\") is now often called the past perfect, since it combines past tense with perfect aspect. (The same term is sometimes used in relation to the grammar of other languages.) English also has a \"past perfect progressive\" (or \"past perfect continuous\") form: \"had been writing\".\n\nThe pluperfect is traditionally described as a tense; in modern linguistic terminology it may be said to combine tense with grammatical aspect; namely past tense (reference to past time) and perfect aspect (state of being completed). It is used to refer to an occurrence that at a past time had already been started (but not necessarily completed), (e.g. \"It had already been raining for a week when the big storm started.\").\n\nBernard Comrie classifies the pluperfect as an \"absolute-relative tense\", because it absolutely (not by context) establishes a deixis (the past event) and places the action relative to the deixis (before it).\nExamples of the English pluperfect (past perfect) are found in the following sentence (from Viktor Frankl's \"Man's Search for Meaning\"):\nHere, \"had thought\" and \"had reached\" are examples of the pluperfect. They refer to an event (a man thinking he has reached the limit of his capacity to suffer), which takes place before another event (the man finding that his capacity to suffer has no limit), that is itself a past event, referred to using the past tense (\"found\"). The pluperfect is needed to make it clear that the first event (the thinking and the supposed reaching) is placed even earlier in the past.\n\nSome languages, like Latin, make pluperfects purely by inflecting the verb, whereas most modern European languages do so using appropriate auxiliary verbs in combination with past participles. The ways in which some languages form the pluperfect are described below.\n\nAncient Greek verbs had a pluperfect form (called ὑπερσυντέλικος, \"more than completed\"). An example is ἐτεθύκει, \"had sacrificed\" – compare the perfect τέθυκε, \"has sacrificed\". See Ancient Greek verbs. Modern Greek uses auxiliaries to form the pluperfect; examples are given in the table at the end of this article.\n\nIn Latin, the pluperfect (\"plus quam perfectum\") is formed without an auxiliary verb in the active voice, and with an auxiliary verb plus the perfect passive participle in the passive voice. For example, in the indicative mood:\nThe subjunctive mood is formed similarly (in this case \"dedisset\" and \"data esset\" respectively). In many cases an ablative absolute phrase, consisting of a noun and perfect participle in the ablative case, may be used in place of a pluperfect; for example: \"Pecuniis mercatori datis, cessit emptor\", \"When money had been given (more literally: Money having been given) to the merchant, the buyer left.\"\n\nFor detailed information see Latin grammar and Latin conjugation.\n\nIn English grammar, the pluperfect is formed by combining the auxiliary verb \"had\" with the past participle of the main verb, as in \"had jumped\" or \"had written\". It is commonly called the past perfect, being a combination of perfect aspect (marked by the use of the \"have\" auxiliary with the past participle) and past tense (marked by the use of the past tense of that auxiliary, \"had\"). It is one of a number of analogously formed perfect constructions, such as the present perfect (\"have/has jumped\"), future perfect (\"will have jumped\") and conditional perfect (\"would have jumped\").\n\nUnlike the present perfect, the past perfect can readily be used with an adverb specifying a past time frame for the occurrence. For example, it is incorrect to say *\"I have done it last Friday\" (the use of \"last Friday\", specifying the past time, would entail the use of the simple past, \"I did it\", rather than the present perfect). However, there is no such objection to a sentence like \"I \"had done\" it last Friday\", where the past perfect is accompanied by a specification of the time of occurrence.\n\nEnglish also has a \"past perfect progressive\" (or \"past perfect continuous\") construction, such as \"had been working\". This is the past equivalent of the present perfect progressive, and is used to refer to an ongoing action that continued up to the past time of reference. For example: \"It had been raining all night when he awoke.\"\n\nIn German, the pluperfect (\"Plusquamperfekt\", \"Präteritumperfekt\", or \"Vorvergangenheit\", lit. \"pre-past\") is used in much the same manner, normally in a \"nachdem\" sentence. The \"Plusquamperfekt\" is formed with the \"Partizip Perfekt\" (\"Partizip\" II) of the full lexical verb, plus the auxiliary verb \"haben\" or \"sein\" in its preterite form, depending on the full lexical verb in question. \n\nWhen using modal verbs, one can use either the modal verb in the preterite or the auxiliary (\"haben\" for all modals):\n\nThere is a drastic shift of meaning between these variants: the first sentences denote that it \"had been necessary\" to rain in the past. The second sentence denotes that the speaker assumed that it had rained.\n\nIn Dutch, the pluperfect (\"Voltooid verleden tijd\") is formed similarly as in German: the past participle (\"voltooid deelwoord\") is combined with the past-tense form of the auxiliary verb \"hebben\" or \"zijn\", depending on the full lexical verb: \"Voordat ik er erg in had, was het al twaalf uur geworden. \" - \"Before I noticed, it had become noon already\". In addition, pluperfect is sometimes used instead of present perfect: \"Dat had ik al gezien (voordat jij het zag)\" - lit.: \"I had seen that (before you did)\". The parenthesized part is implied and, therefore, can be omitted.\n\nIn standard Swedish, the pluperfect (\"pluskvamperfekt\") is similar to pluperfect in a number of other Germanic languages, but with a slightly different word order, and is formed with the preterite form of \"ha\" (\"have\" in English), i.e. \"hade\" (\"had\" in English), plus the supine form of the main verb: \"När jag kom dit hade han gått hem\" - \"When I arrived there he had gone home\".\n\nIn French, the indicative pluperfect (\"Plus-que-parfait\", \"more than perfect\") is formed by taking the appropriate form of the imperfect indicative of the auxiliaries \"avoir\" or \"être\" and adding the past participle, \"j'avais mangé\". Another type of pluperfect (\"passé antérieur\") can be formed with the appropriate simple past form of the auxiliary: \"j'eus mangé\", though it is rarely used now.\n\nIn Italian, there are two pluperfects in the indicative mood: the recent pluperfect (\"trapassato prossimo\") and the remote pluperfect (\"trapassato remoto\"). The recent pluperfect is formed correspondingly to French by using the imperfect of the appropriate auxiliary verb (\"essere\" or \"avere\") plus the past participle. For example, \"Ero affamato perché non avevo mangiato\" \"I was hungry because I had not eaten.\" The remote pluperfect is formed by using the preterite of the appropriate auxiliary verb plus the past participle. In the Italian consecutio temporum, the \"trapassato remoto\" should be used for completed actions in a clause subjugated to a clause whose verb is in the preterite.\n\nThe second example may refer to an event that happened continuously or habitually in the past. (I.e. \"After I used to find it, I would sell it\" OR \"After I would find it, I would sell it\"). The first example, being the preterite, refers only to actions completed once in the remote past, or distant past.\n\nIn Spanish, there are also two pluperfects (as in Italian, French, Catalan and Portuguese), being the pluperfect proper (\"pluscuamperfecto\", or \"antecopretérito\") and the so called \"pretérito anterior\" (or \"antepretérito\"). While the former uses the imperfect of the auxiliary verb \"haber\" plus the past participle, the latter is formed with the simple past of \"haber\" plus the past participle. For example, in pluperfect Había comido cuando mi madre vino\" 'I had eaten when my mother came', but in \"pretérito anterior\" Hube comido cuando mi madre vino\" 'I had eaten when my mother would come'. This last form however is rarely used.\n\nIn Galician and Portuguese, a synthetic pluperfect (\"mais-que-perfeito\" or \"antepretérito\") has been conserved from Latin. For example, \"Quando cheguei, soube que o meu amigo morrera, 'When I came, I found out that my friend had died'. In Portuguese, however, its use has become mostly literary, and particularly in spoken communication, the pluperfect is usually formed using the auxiliary verb \"ter\", in the imperfect form (tinha tinhas tinha tínhamos tínheis tinham) plus the past participle. For example, \"Quando cheguei, soube que o meu amigo tinha morrido. A more formal way of expressing the pluperfect uses the verb \"haver\". For example: \"Quando cheguei, soube que o meu amigo havia morrido\". This periphrastic construction is not permitted in Galician, so Galician uses the synthetic pluperfect exclusively.\n\nIn Judeo-Spanish, the Latin pluperfect forms with little alteration have been preserved (e.g. final /m/ and /t/ are dropped) to express this tense (\"pluskuamperfekto\"), which is identical in form to the imperfect subjunctive. It has a similar form to the Portuguese, thus the Portuguese example above in Jidyo is, \"Kuando yegí suve ke mi haver morera 'When I came I knew that my friend had died'. It remains the main spoken form, though in some varieties, similarly to Spanish or Portuguese, the pluperfect is formed using the auxiliary verbs \"tener\" or \"aver\" plus the past participle. For example, \"Kuando yegí suve ke mi haver tuve morido or \"Kuando yegí suve ke mi haver avía morido\".\n\nIn Romanian, the pluperfect (\"mai mult ca perfect\") is expressed without any auxiliary words, using a particular form of the verb, originated in the Latin pluperfect subjunctive. (compare Italian imperfect subjunctive \"Sembrava che Elsa non venisse with Romanian pluperfect \"Părea că Elsa nu venise). For example, in \"Când l-am întrebat, el văzuse deja filmul\" 'When I asked him, he had already seen the movie'. The verb \"văzuse\" is in the pluperfect form of \"a vedea\" 'to see'. Technically, this form is obtained from the singular third person form of the simple perfect tense by adding specific terminations for each person and number.\nHowever, in northern Transylvania there is a regional way to state the pluperfect (that may reflect the German influence). The pluperfect is expressed by combining the auxiliary verb \"fost\" or the short version \"fo\" (= \"was\" in English or \"war\" in German) with the participle, which (quite difficult to explain) is stated in its feminine form. Examples:\n\"o fost foastă\" (or \"o fo' foastă\") = he had been; \"am fost văzută\" = I had seen; \"or fost venită\" = they had come.\n\nIn some of the Slavic languages the pluperfect has fallen out of use or is rarely used; pluperfect meaning is often expressed using the ordinary past tense, with some adverb (such as \"earlier\") or other periphrastic construction to indicate prior occurrence.\n\nUkrainian and Belarusian preserve a distinct pluperfect (\"давньоминулий час\" or \"запрошлы час\" – \"davn'omynulyj čas\" or \"zaprošły čas\") that is formed by preceding the verb with \"buv\" / \"bula\" in Ukrainian and \"byŭ\" / \"była\" in Belarusian (literally, 'was'). It was and still is used in daily speech, especially in rural areas. Being mostly unused in literature during Soviet times, it is now regaining popularity. Here is an example of usage: \"Ja vže buv pіšov, až raptom zhadav...\" (Ukrainian) and \"Ja ŭžo byŭ pajšoŭ, kali raptam zhadaŭ\" (Belarusian) \"I almost had gone already when I recalled...\"\n\nIn Slovenian, the pluperfect (predpreteklik, 'before the past') is formed with the verb 'to be' (biti) in past tense and the participle of the main verb. It is used to denote a completed action in the past before another action (\"Pred nekaj leti so bile vode poplavile vsa nabrežja Savinje\", 'A few years ago, all the banks of Savinja River had been flooded) or, with a modal verb, a past event that should have happened (\"Moral bi ti bil povedati\", 'I should have told you'). Its use is considered archaic and is rarely used even in literary language.\n\nIn Polish pluperfect is only found in texts written in or imitating Old Polish, when it was formed with past (perfect) tense of \"być\" \"to be\" and past participle of the main verb. The person marking is movable, e.g. \"zrobił byłem ~ zrobiłem był\" \"I had done\". Past tense of the adjectival verbs (\"powinienem był zrobić\" \"I should have done\") and conditional mood (\"zrobiłbym był\" \"I would have done\") are often wrongly considered pluperfect forms - morphologically, the latter is actually past conditional, rarely used in modern Polish.\n\nIn Serbo-Croatian, the pluperfect (\"pluskvamperfekt\") is constructed with the past tense (\"perfekt\") of the verb to be (\"biti\") plus the adjective form of the main verb.\nFor example: \"Ja sam bio učio\", which means, \"I had been studying\".\n\nIn Bulgarian, the pluperfect (\"минало предварително време\") is formed with the imperfect tense of the auxiliary verb \"съм\" (to be) and the perfect active participle of the main verb.\n\nFor examples of pluperfects in Bulgarian and Macedonian, see the table below.\n\nIn Welsh, the pluperfect is formed without an auxiliary verb, usually by interpolating \"-as-\" before the simple past ending: \"parhasem\", \"we had remained\".\n\nIn Irish, perfect forms are constructed using the idea of being (or having been) \"after\" doing something. In the pluperfect, \"bhíomar tar éis imeacht\", \"we had gone\", literally, \"we were after going\".\n\nIn Finnish, the pluperfect (\"pluskvamperfekti\") is constructed with an auxiliary verb \"olla\" 'to be', which is in the past tense. The primary verbs get the past participle endings \"-nyt/-nut\" in singular, \"-neet\" in plural forms (the 'n' assimilates with certain consonants) and \"-ttu/-tty/-tu/-ty\" in passive forms.\n\nIn German and French there is an additional way to construct a pluperfect by doubling the perfect tense particles. This is called doubled perfect (\"doppeltes Perfekt\") or super perfect (\"Superperfekt\") in German and plus past perfect (\"temps surcomposé\") in French. These forms are not commonly used in written language and they are not taught in school.\n\nBoth languages allow to construct a past tense with a modal verb (like English \"to have\", in German \"haben\", in French \"avoir\"), for example \"I have heard it\". This is largely equivalent to the usage in English. The additional perfect tense is constructed by putting the modal verb (\"to have\") in the past tense as if being the full verb (\"I have had\") followed by the actual verb in the past particle mode (\"I have had heard it\"). The same applies to those verbs which require \"to be\" (German \"sein\", French \"être\") as the modal verb for the construction of the past tense (which would not work in English).\n\nIn spoken language in Southern Germany the doubled perfect construction sometimes replaces the Standard German pluperfect construction.\n\nIn France it is uncommon in the Northern regions (with Parisian influence) but it can be found widely in Provençal dialects as well as in other regions around the world. In all regions the doubled pluperfect (\"I had had heard it\") is uncommon although it is possible - all of these forms emphasize the perfect aspect by extending the modal verb so that a doubled pluperfect would add upon the pluperfect in another part of the speech.\n\n"}
{"id": "1841908", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1841908", "title": "DFA Records", "text": "DFA Records\n\nDFA Records is an American independent record label founded in 2001 by Mo' Wax co-founder Tim Goldsworthy, musician James Murphy, and manager Jonathan Galkin. They previously had a production team called The DFA, consisting of Goldsworthy and Murphy.\n\nJames Murphy and Tim Goldsworthy met while working in New York on the David Holmes album \"Let's Get Killed\". After the recording was completed, Goldsworthy stayed in New York, and the two began to throw parties in the Lower East Side. They created the production duo, The DFA, but wished to grow The DFA into more than what it was. It was not until they met Jonathan Galkin, who subsequently quit his event-production job to work with James and Tim, that they turned DFA into a label.\n\nDFA Records began on a series of 12\" single vinyl releases starting with The Rapture's \"House of Jealous Lovers\" and The Juan Maclean's \"By the Time I Get to Venus\". \"House of Jealous Lovers\" went on to sell 7500 copies. Many of the early releases of DFA's catalog were released in Europe through Trevor Jackson's Output Recordings. After completing production on The Rapture's debut full-length album \"Echoes\", DFA began to shop around the album. Although The Rapture eventually signed to Universal Music Group, the DFA label secured a deal with EMI for distribution of its acts outside the United States, along with several distributors within the U.S.\n\nThe label has grown steadily since, producing full-length albums for its ever-growing roster of artists, as well as releasing a selection of singles and compilations on their label. Notable releases include The Rapture's EP \"House of Jealous Lovers\", the twice-Grammy nominated debut of James Murphy's band LCD Soundsystem and its follow-ups \"Sound of Silver\" and \"This Is Happening\". DFA have also released a number of compilation albums featuring artists such as The Rapture, The Juan Maclean, Black Dice, Shit Robot, Delia Gonzalez & Gavin Russom, J.O.Y., Pixeltan, Black Leotard Front, Hot Chip, and LCD Soundsystem.\n\nAs a production team, the DFA have produced and remixed artists including Radio 4, Le Tigre, N.E.R.D., Soulwax, Blues Explosion, Nine Inch Nails, Automato, Gorillaz, UNKLE, The Chemical Brothers and M.I.A.. The DFA remix of M.I.A.'s \"Paper Planes\" appeared on A. R. Rahman's Academy Award-winning \"Slumdog Millionaire\" soundtrack. They spent an afternoon writing a song with Britney Spears, and were also approached by Janet Jackson to collaborate. The production duo effectively came to an end when Tim Goldsworthy left New York and moved back to his native UK. The label is now primarily run by Jonathan Galkin and Kris Petersen.\n\nIn 2007 DFA Records started an imprint label titled Death From Abroad. This offshoot is used to release 12\" singles by artists not based in North America, such as Mock & Toof and ALTZ. The imprint also released a CD compilation of tracks released on the Berlin based Supersoul Recordings.\n\nThe label's original name was Death From Above Records, dating from Murphy's nickname for the sound system he had helped build for Six Finger Satellite. This name was deemed inappropriate for a New York City-based label following the September 11, 2001 attacks and subsequently shortened to its abbreviation DFA.\n\nIn 2004, DFA Records forced the Canadian duo Death From Above to change their name to Death from Above 1979. Murphy explained his side of the story in a 2005 interview with Pitchfork Media:\n\nWe knew about them for a long time, the name thing wasn't a big deal. It wasn't until they signed to a major label, which wouldn't release the record until we signed off on the name. That's how this all came about... [Parent company of Death From Above 1979's label, Vice] Atlantic's not gonna release a record by a band with the same name as another entity in music... We spent a lot of money because we didn't just wanna be total fucking assholes and just say no. We were trying to find a way for it to actually work... I was like, \"What the hell's wrong with Death From Above 1979?\" But the copyright attorney was like, \"No, that's not fine.\" And I said, \"If they become a totally different name, and it delays their record, that's something I'm not comfortable with.\" So we just tried to make it work as well as possible.\n\nThe band would later go on to change their name to Death from Above in 2017 without any legal repercussions.\n\nIn 2013 Murphy filed a lawsuit against Goldsworthy, alleging he owed money and had been making unauthorised withdrawals from bank accounts and using the company credit card improperly.\n\nAs well as Murphy's LCD Soundsystem the label is currently home to the likes of The Juan Maclean, Hot Chip (North America only), Shit Robot, Gavin Russom, Prinzhorn Dance School, Shocking Pinks, Holy Ghost!, Still Going, Syclops, Planningtorock and Yacht. They are also jointly releasing music with fellow New York City based label Rong Music, by artists such as Free Blood and Woolfy. The label has also reissued the first two albums by Athens, Georgia based new wave band Pylon, the first time they have been available on CD, as well as a retrospective collection of tracks by Peter Gordon and the Love of Life Orchestra.\n\nThe influence of musicians and bands like Brian Eno, Talking Heads, Liquid Liquid, ESG, Blondie, Yazoo, New Order, as well as Chicago House, can be heard throughout the DFA catalog. Rather than retread, however, the DFA have taken the live dance music of the time and infused the techniques and themes with a modern aesthetic—alternately faster, heavier, dubbier, noisier, and generally more intense than their influences.\n\nArtists who have released music on DFA Records include:\n\n\n\n\n"}

Cohen\n\nStephen Frand Cohen (born November 25, 1938) is an American scholar and professor emeritus of Russian studies at Princeton University and New York University. His academic work concentrates on modern Russian history since the Bolshevik Revolution and Russia's relationship with the United States.\n\nCohen is married to Katrina vanden Heuvel, editor of the progressive magazine \"The Nation\", where he is also a contributing editor. Cohen is a founding director of the reestablished American Committee for East–West Accord which was revived in 2015.\n\nCohen attended Indiana University Bloomington, where he earned a B.S. in economics and public policy in 1960 and an M.A. in government and Russian studies in 1962. While studying in England, he went on a four-week trip to the Soviet Union, where he became interested in its history and politics.\n\nAfter completing his Ph.D. in government and Russian studies at Columbia University in 1968, he became a professor of politics and Russian studies at Princeton University later that year and remained on its faculty until 1998. He then taught at New York University until his retirement.\n\nDuring the Cold War, Cohen was critical of both western hawks and also the Soviet government, which banned him from visiting the Soviet Union from 1982 to 1985. He supported the \"perestroika\", the reforms of Mikhail Gorbachev. In his book \"War with Russia?\", Cohen explains his suspicion that at \"least one U.S.-Soviet summit seems to have been sabotaged. The third Eisenhower-Khrushchev meeting, scheduled for Paris in 1960, was aborted by the Soviet shoot-down of a US U-2 spy plane sent, some think, by 'deep state' foes of detente.\"\n\nCohen has said that Putin's handling of the Ukrainian crisis, his annexation of Crimea, and his support for rebel fighters in the east were in reaction to the aggressive behavior of the United States and its allies, when they supported the overthrow of President Viktor Yanukovych. In a June 30, 2014 article in the left-liberal publication \"The Nation\", Cohen criticized the US political-media establishment for being silent about \"Kiev's atrocities\" in the Donbass region. Cohen stated that even if Putin's reaction was aggressive, the US should immediately negotiate with Russia to avoid escalation of the conflict.\n\nCohen has said that the US continued the Cold War after the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991. He cited President Clinton's backtracking on the promise of his predecessor not to extend NATO eastward and the flawed interpretation of an \"American victory\" and a \"Russian defeat,\" which led US leaders to believe that Russia would submit completely to US foreign policy. Cohen cites the cancellation of the ABM Treaty in 2002 and the refusal to admit Russia to the World Trade Organization at the G8 summit in Saint Petersburg in 2006. Cohen also criticizes the \"pointless demonization\" of Vladimir Putin as an \"autocrat.\"\n\nIn a July 2015 interview, Cohen said: \"Even Henry Kissinger — I think it was in March 2014 in \"The Washington Post\" — wrote this line: 'The demonization of Putin is not a policy. It’s an alibi for not having a policy.' And then I wrote in reply to that: That's right, but it’s much worse than that, because it's also that the demonization of Putin is an obstacle to thinking rationally, having a rational discourse or debate about American national security. And it’s not just this catastrophe in Ukraine and the new Cold War; it's from there to Syria to Afghanistan, to the proliferation of nuclear weapons, to fighting global terrorism. The demonization of Putin excludes a partner in the Kremlin that the U.S. needs, no matter who sits there.\"\n\nIn an article for \"The Nation\" that was published in February 2014, he made an accusation of \"media malpractice,\" including the journalism of \"The New York Times\" and \"The Washington Post\", with the result that the \"American media on Russia today are less objective, less balanced, more conformist and scarcely less ideological than when they covered Soviet Russia during the Cold War.\"\n\nIn a May 17, 2017 interview with Tucker Carlson, Cohen said: \"You and I have to ask a subversive question: are there really three branches of government, or is there a fourth branch of government – these intel services?\" He also stated that a military alliance that Obama had tried to establish with Putin against terrorism was \"sabotaged by the Department of Defense and its allies in the intelligence services.\" Each of Trump's efforts to \"cooperate with Russia\" was \"thwarted [by] a new leak of a story.\"\n\nCohen participated in a Munk Debate in Toronto, Ontario, Canada over the proposal \"Be it resolved the West should engage not isolate Russia...\" He and Vladimir Posner argued in favor of engagement, while Anne Applebaum and Garry Kasparov argued against. Cohen's side lost the debate, with 52% of the audience voting against the motion.\n\nIn 2015, a proposed deal with the Association for Slavic, East European, and Eurasian Studies (ASEEES) for a fellowship that would bear Cohen's name caused controversy and was initially revoked after some ASEEES members objected to it. Following a special meeting in May 2015, the board of ASEEES explained that it voted in favor of accepting \"the Cohen–Tucker Fellowship as named, should the gift be re-offered\" and the establishment of the Cohen–Tucker fellowship programme was announced shortly afterwards.\n\nAlso in 2015, Cohen and other intellectual colleagues reestablished the American Committee for East–West Accord, which describes itself as a pro détente advocacy group. From 2015, Cohen has been a member of the board of directors of the revived ACEWA.\n\nCathy Young characterized Cohen's 2014 article on \"Kiev's atrocities\" (mentioned above) as \"error-riddled\" and an \"embarrassing\" repetition of Kremlin propaganda. In a 2015 interview, Cohen said that \"this notion that this is all Putin’s aggression, or Russia’s aggression, is, if not 100-percent false, let us say, for the sake of being balanced and ecumenical, it's 50-percent false. And if Washington would admit that its narrative is 50-percent false, which means Russia's narrative is 50-percent correct, that's where negotiations begin and succeed.\"\n\nHis views on Ukraine have been criticized and described as pro-Putin and pro-Kremlin, and Cohen, in turn, has rejected such labels. According to \"The Chronicle of Higher Education\" Cohen's writings at \"The Nation\" have also helped lead to “[s]taffers at \"The Nation\"… openly revolting against the magazin’s pro-Russian tilt.”\n\nCohen has denied the existence of Ukraine as a sovereign independent European Country. He refers to Russia’s military invasion of Ukraine as a \"civil war\". Cohen also asserts that Russia did not shoot down Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, a calamity that killed all 298 people on board. He points out that the Ukrainian government had possession of Russian BUK surface-to-air missiles, and suggested the country \"was playing with its new toys and made a big mistake.\"\n\nHistorian Timothy Snyder disputed Cohen's claim that the Ukrainian prime minister described the government's adversaries as subhuman. Snyder wrote that the prime minister, in a message of condolence to families of killed Ukrainian soldiers, described the attackers as 'inhuman' and suggested that the origin of Cohen's claim was Russian media mistranslation of 'neliudy' as 'nedocheloveki' (subhuman).\n\nHis views on US-Russian relations have been criticized by Julia Ioffe and others as being pro-Putin. Ioffe's assessment has, in turn, been criticized by James W. Carden. Carden is executive director of the American Committee for East–West Accord (ACEWA).\n\nCohen uses the radio platform of the John Batchelor Show on Talkradio 77 WABC (Westwood One) to dispense his narrative of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nCohen's grandfather emigrated to the United States from Lithuania (then part of the Russian Empire). Cohen was born in 1938 in Owensboro, Kentucky where his father owned a golf course. He has a son and a daughter from his first marriage to opera singer Lynn Blair, whom he later divorced, and second daughter with Katrina vanden Heuvel, whom Cohen married in 1988.\n\nHe is a long-standing friend of former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, advised former U.S. President George H. W. Bush in the late 1980s, and helped Nikolai Bukharin's widow, Anna Larina, rehabilitate her name during the Soviet era.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

They were originally designed to have a Co-Co wheel arrangement, but it proved impossible to keep below the axle loading limit imposed by the British Railways Civil Engineer. A 1-Co bogie design originally used on the Southern Railway 10201 was used instead. \n\nConstruction began in the summer of 1958, although the first example was not completed until April 1959. The ten locomotives were originally allocated to Camden motive power depot and used on the West Coast Main Line, although also often seen on the Midland main line. However, with the advent of large numbers of Class 45 locomotives the 10 Class 44 locomotives were transferred to Toton.\n\nA 2,300 bhp Sulzer 12LDA28-A diesel engine drove a Crompton Parkinson GC426-A1 main generator which supplied power to six Crompton Parkinson C171-B1 traction motors. When initially put into service, the locomotives were fitted with multiple working. \n\nThey were geared for 90 mph running, although D2 was experimentally geared to run faster than this and was also fitted temporarily with the first intercooled 2,500 bhp B model of the engine. In 1962 it managed 110 mph with three coach test trains on the West Coast Main Line. This was not intended as a high-speed trial of the \"Peaks\", but to study the condition of the line, before and sustained high-speed running over it.\n\nBy 1960, the next batch of \"Peaks\", D11 and the class 45s, were in production. These had lowered motor gearing from 62/17 to 57/22 which reduced the tractive effort, but also reduced traction motor rpm at speed and so reduced the risk of flashover. In 1961, the same gearing change was applied to the class 44s, reducing their continuous tractive effort from 41,000 to 29,000 lbf.\n\nThe class suffered 'a considerable amount of early \"teething trouble\"' during the early 1960s. The bogies suffered from frame fractures. The vacuum exhausters gave trouble, as did the auxiliary motor, the original batteries supplied were also inadequate and soon became exhausted. The main problem with the exhausters was that they were mounted in the centre of the engine room and so had to be lifted through the roof by crane, taking 8-12 hours to change. The truss girder used for the body sides meant that there was no access through the sides of the bodywork. Considerable trouble was experienced with the water tanks for the steam heating boilers due to fractures. \n\nOnce the class 45 units were available, the locomotives were re-assigned to Toton and freight duties, and the steam heating boilers were removed. \n\nThe class worked regularly over the West Coast Main Line for a couple of years prior to its electrification, and also between London St Pancras and Manchester Exchange. Once they were consigned to Freight services, they mostly operated in the East Midlands, all being allocated to Toton until withdrawal.\nThe class was renumbered 44 001-010 with the adoption of the Total Operations Processing System in the early 1970s. Withdrawal of the whole class took place between 1976 and 1980. Two locomotives have survived to preservation.\n\n"}

The vessels did not inflict significant damage on each other, however the battle is notable for seeing the first combat use of the torpedo.\n\nIn May 1877, Nicolás de Piérola, former Minister of Finance initiated an attempt to overthrow then Peruvian President Mariano Ignacio Prado. As part of this coup attempt, on the 6th of May two of his supporters, Colonel Lorranaga and Major Echenique boarded the \"Huáscar\" at the port of Callao while the captain and executive officer where ashore. Officers remaining on the ship were part of the plot and persuaded the crew to join their cause. Now in rebel hands, the \"Huáscar\" put to sea with Luis Germán Astete in command. Other Peruvian naval ships present in the port, such as the \"Atahualpa\" were in a state of disrepair and unable to pursue.\n\nThe rebels used the ship to harass commercial shipping especially off El Callao, the main commercial port of Peru. However, after she boarded some British merchant ships, British authorities sent Rear Admiral de Horsey to capture the vessel.\n\nThe Peruvian warship managed to outrun the British squadron after a fierce exchange of fire. \"Huáscar\"s guns were undermanned, and she fired just 40 rounds. \"Shah\"s mast was damaged by splinters. On the British side, \"Shah\" fired 237 shots and \"Amethyst\" 190, but none of them carried armour-piercing ammunition. \"Huáscar\" was hit 60 times, but her armour shield defeated all the rounds. There was a last-ditch effort to stop or sink the rebels when two small torpedo rams from \"Shah\" attempted to find the \"Huáscar\", but the Peruvian ship managed to escape under the cover of darkness. The rebel crew was forced to surrender their ship to the Peruvian government just two days later.\n\nThis battle saw the first use of the newly invented self-propelled torpedo which, at the time, had just entered limited service with the Royal Navy. The torpedo was dodged by the rebel monitor.\n\n"}

The psammophore is used for gathering small seeds, helping to increase the efficiency of transportation of fine sand and pebbles during nest construction, or to carry eggs. However, this structure is missing in species of the subgenus \"Ephebomyrmex\" (Greek ἔφηβος/\"ephēbos\", \"beardless lad\"), and these species generally have smaller individuals and colonies.\n\n\"Pogonomyrmex\" (\"sensu stricto\") workers have the most toxic venom documented in any insects, with \"Pogonomyrmex maricopa\" being the most toxic tested thus far. It has an of only 0.12 mg/kg, compared to western honey bee venom, at 2.8 mg/kg, and comparable to cobra venom. The venom is presumed to be an antivertebrate defense, specifically against predators that have evolved to selectively feed on them such as horned lizards. Very few insects have had the toxicity of their venoms formally tested, and other insects likely have more potent venoms.\n\nThese ants dig very deep nests with many underground chambers in which they keep seeds, from which they derive food for their larvae. The areas around most \"Pogonomyrmex\" (\"sensu stricto\") nests tend to be utterly devoid of vegetation, and are easily seen from a distance.\n\nIn addition to horned lizards, predatory wasps in the genus \"Clypeadon\" feed only on \"Pogonomyrmex\" workers, paralyzing them with their venom, and carrying them back to a burrow where they will serve as food for the wasp's larva.\n\nAs of 2014, there are 69 extant and 1 fossil species in the genus.\n"}

After making her runway debut in 2011, she modeled exclusively for magazines \"CanCam\" and \"Steady\", while also making regular appearances on variety shows. At the same time, Kusumi continued to perform at music events and took part in Dream Morning Musume. Kusumi also ventured into acting, appearing in shows such as \"Woman Prisoner 7\" and \"\".\n\nKoharu Kusumi was born in Ojimaya, Washima Village in Niigata Prefecture, and grew up in a rural neighborhood. Her family consisted of her parents, an older sister, and an older brother. Around the middle of elementary school, Kusumi became interested in modeling from reading magazines like \"CanCam\". Prior to joining Morning Musume, Kusumi was the captain of her school's volleyball team.\n\nIn 2005, after seeing an audition call for new members for the Japanese idol group Morning Musume in a magazine, Kusumi considered applying after noticing she was eligible based on the minimum age requirements to participate. With her sister's help, Kusumi auditioned in secret with the song \"As a Person\" by Tomomi Kahara. She sang \"Furusato\" during the final audition and was selected for the group as the only seventh generation member, a feat which earned her the nickname \"Miracle\" from producer Tsunku.

It now has a mostly derogatory connotation, describing what is seen as an antiquated female role model in contemporary Western society. The phrase is vaguely equivalent to the American \"barefoot and pregnant\" or the Victorian \"A woman's place is in the home\".\n\nThe origins of the phrase are normally attributed either to the last German Emperor Wilhelm II, or to his first wife, Empress Augusta Victoria. She is likely to have adopted it from one of several similar German \"sayings by number\". The most suggestive of these is listed in the second volume of \"German proverbs Glossary: A Treasury for the German People\" published in 1870 by : \"Four K's are requisite of a pious woman, namely, that she keeps regard for church, chamber, kitchen, children.\" Wander refers for the origins of this saying to a 16th-century commentary on Sirach by Johannes Mathesius. He also lists another similar phrase: \"A good housewife has to take care of five K: chamber, kids, kitchen, cellar, clothes,\" which appeared first in the 1810 collection of German proverbs. by Johann Michael Sailer. In 1844 \"The newspaper for the German Nobility\" published this latter saying in its traditional last page \"feature\" short statements.\n\nThe phrase started to appear in its current form in writing in the early 1890s. \"After Germany, where women apparently take no interest in public affairs, and seem to obey to the letter the young emperor's injunction 'Let women devote themselves to the three K's,' (kitchen, church, and children), the active interest and influence of English women on all great questions were refreshing.\" wrote Marie C. Remick in \"A Woman's Travel-notes on England\" in 1892. The phrase then was used multiple times throughout the 1890s in liberal writing and speeches.\n\nIn August 1899 the influential British liberal \"Westminster Gazette\" elaborated on the story, mentioning, as well, the 4th \"K\". A story titled \"The American Lady and the Kaiser. The Empress's four K's\" describes an audience given by the Kaiser to two American suffragettes. After hearing them out, the Kaiser replies: \"I agree with my wife. And do you know what she says? She says that women have no business interfering with anything outside the four K's. The four K's are – Kinder, Küche, Kirche, and Kleider: Children, Kitchen, Church, and Clothing\".\n\n\"Kaiser's 4 K's\" is encountered again in Charlotte Perkins Gilman's 1911 book \"The man-made world\". The \"3 K's\" variation has remained by far more popular and well known.\n\nWhen Hitler came to power in 1933, he introduced a Law for the Encouragement of Marriage, which entitled newly married couples to a loan of 1000 marks (around 9 months' average wages at that time). On their first child, they could keep 250 marks. On their second, they could keep another 250. They reclaimed all of the loan by their fourth child.\n\nIn a September 1934 speech to the National Socialist Women's Organization, Adolf Hitler argued that for the German woman her \"world is her husband, her family, her children, and her home\", a policy which was reinforced by the stress on \"Kinder\" and \"Küche\" in propaganda, and the bestowing of the Cross of Honor of the German Mother on women bearing four or more babies.\n\nDuring this period, women were discriminated against in employment and forced out or bribed with numerous social benefits. Medicine, the law and civil service were occupations reserved for men alone.\n\nIn one of his essays, T. S. Eliot reproduces and then comments upon a column in the \"Evening Standard\" of May 10, 1939 headed Back to the Kitchen' Creed Denounced\":\n\nDuring World War II in Germany, women eventually were put back in the factories because of the growing losses in the armed forces and the desperate lack of equipment on the front lines.\n\nThe phrase continued to be used in feminist and anti-feminist writing in the English-speaking world in the 1950s and 1960s. So, notably, the first version of the classic feminist paper by Naomi Weisstein \"Psychology Constructs the Female\" was titled \"Kinder, Küche, Kirche as Scientific Law: Psychology Constructs the Female\".\n\n"}

Early in his career he was in the service of the governor of Shirvan, during which time he incurred the governor's wrath, for which he received the punishment of spending one night outdoors in the cold and snow. ‘Imad al-Din Mahmud Shirazi resorted to opium during that night, and, although he recovered from the immediate effects of the cold, he had a tremor for the rest of his life. He became an opium-eater (afyuni), convinced of the therapeutic value of opium.\n\nReflecting his own experience, ‘Imad al-Din Mahmud Shirazi wrote a treatise in Persian on the medical and addictive properties of opium and its use in compound remedies. The National Library of Medicine has a copy of this treatise that was made in Kerman in 1591, possibly during the author's lifetime or shortly thereafter. Another copy of this 16th-century Persian manuscript scribed between 1737 and 1744 is extant in the Library of Ibn Sina Academy of Medieval Medicine and Sciences.\n\n‘Imad al-Din Mahmud Shirazi also composed the first Persian-language monograph on syphilis and an important treatise on China root (chub-i chini), the rhizome of an Old World species of smilax found in eastern Asia and advocated for the treatment of syphilis.

His performance at work suffers and his appetite decreases as he devotes all his time and resources to tracking the duo.\n\nCoretti spots the man secreting money from some kind of pocket, and realizes that he has discovered a new kind of creature, one that has adapted to modern society more completely than any cockroach, fueled by the alcohol of a hundred bars.

{"id": "1842027", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1842027", "title": "Ashland Global", "text": "Ashland Global\n\nAshland Global Specialty Chemicals Inc. is an American chemical company which operates in more than 100 countries. Headquartered in Covington, Kentucky, the company traces its roots back to the city of Ashland, Kentucky, where it was headquartered from 1924 to 1999. The company currently has five wholly owned divisions, which include Chemical Intermediates and Solvents, Composites, Industrial Specialties, Personal and Home Care, & Pharmaceuticals, Food and Beverage, and Agriculture. Until 2017, the company was the primary manufacturer of Valvoline.\n\nAshland was founded in 1924 as the Ashland Refining Company in Catlettsburg, Kentucky, by Paul G. Blazer.\n\nIn October 1923, J. Fred Miles of the Swiss Oil Company of Lexington, Kentucky. employed Paul G. Blazer and assigned him the task of locating, purchasing and operating a refinery in northeastern Kentucky. Mr. Blazer selected a location on the banks of the Big Sandy River approximately two miles south of the Ohio River near the community of Leach Station. One mile south of the city of Catlettsburg, the site contained an existing refinery which was purchased by Blazer which had been in operation since 1916. The Catlettsburg site was advantageous due to its location near the Ohio River and offered an efficient means of transportation for the fledgling company. With funds supplied by Swiss Oil, Blazer arranged to buy, at a price of $212,500, the small unprofitable 1,000 barrel per day refinery of Great Eastern Refining Company which had been owned by coal operators in Huntington, West Virginia. With the purchase of the refinery came a small towboat and oil barge.\n\nOn February 2, 1924, alvin and three Swiss Oil executives incorporated Ashland Refining Company, with a capital of $250,000. They took over the operations of the Catlettsburg Refinery which had twenty-five employees who were working seven days per week and twelve hours per day. Blazer moved from Lexington to Ashland. The only member of the Swiss Oil organization to come to Ashland with Blazer was Ashland Refining Company's first treasurer, William Waples.\n\nAshland's refinery operations in Catlettsburg proved to be successful even from the very first month. Wages were increased and the hours of work were reduced. After making repairs and purchasing some new, modern equipment, the refinery soon had output of 500,000 barrels a year and sales of $1,300,000. In only a few years, the Ashland Refining Company began to show larger returns than the parent company.\nAshland Refining Co. grew rapidly through both internal expansion and acquisitions including Union Gas and Oil Company (1925), Tri-State Refining Company (1930), and Cumberland Pipeline Company (1931).\n\nBy 1933, Ashland Refining Company owned more than 1,000 wells, 800 miles of pipelines, bulk distribution plants in twelve cities, service stations, river transportation terminals and river equipment. In 1936, under Blazer's leadership, the company's ownership changed from Swiss Oil to the Ashland Oil and Refining Company shareholder group and was headquartered in Ashland, Kentucky. Blazer was appointed chief executive officer of the company.\n\nBlazer's success as manager was recognized by major stockholders. They gave him the power to run Ashland as his own operation, though at no point during his tenure as chief executive officer (1936–1957) did he own a controlling interest in the company.\n\nBlazer's philosophy of supporting the well-being of company employees was evident early on. Two of his early changes were offering employees' sick leave with full pay, and in 1947 the introduction of an employee profit-sharing plan. This move made the company one of the first in the region to offer such benefits. Blazer supported creative arts and invited nearby Greenup County educator and internationally acclaimed author Jesse Stuart to open each annual meeting with a story, a poem, or a bit of humor. He also was a pastor at his local church.\n\nAfter the end of World War II, Ashland teamed with Sperry Corporation to develop the introduction of radar on commercial river vessels and teamed with various shipyards to develop the integrated tow. The \"jumbo\" tank barge of 195 ft. by 35 ft. became the industry standard and was used by Ashland. Under Blazer's control, the company grew to become a \"Forbes\" 500 company by relying on barges to bring in crude oil and deliver refined products to independent marketers. In the process, Ashland soon operated the nation's largest inland towing fleet and in 1953 the Port of Huntington-Tristate exceeded Pittsburgh as the busiest port on the Ohio River and the busiest inland port in the United States, a title it retains to date.\n\nAshland Oil & Refining Company also grew through many acquisitions such as the Allied Oil Company (1948), Cleveland and Lakeland Tankers (1948), Aetna Oil Company (1949), Freedom-Valvoline Company (1950), Frontier Oil of Buffalo (1950) and National Refining Company (1950).\n\nBy 1953, Ashland Oil and Refining Company had 3,518 miles of crude oil pipelines, 252 miles of product lines, six refineries processing an average of 124,000 barrels a day, operated nine tow boats on the inland waterways, and owned over 100 barges.\nAlthough still involved as chairman of Ashland's Finance Committee and Executive Committee, Blazer stepped down as chief executive officer in 1957.\n\nLouisville Refining Company was purchased in 1959. United Carbon was purchased in 1963.\n\nIn 1966, Ashland Oil and Refinery Company Inc.'s sales had grown to $699,000,000.\n\nDiversification continued with the purchase of Warren Brothers in 1966, which later was to become Ashland Paving and Construction. A major leap into the chemical industry occurred in 1967 when Ashland purchased ADM Chemical Group. This chemical distribution segment of the business would go on to be one of the primary functions of the company in the later part of the 20th century. In 1969, the company reorganized to form Ashland Petroleum, as well as entering into a joint venture in Coal mining under the name Arch Mineral.\n\nIn the 1980s and early 1990s, Ashland continued to expand buying The Permian Corporation which it merged with Scurlock Oil Company in 1991 to form a subsidiary known as Scurlock Permian Corporation. In 1992, most of Unocal's chemical distribution business was acquired, making Ashland the top chemical distributor in North America. At this time, the Industrial Chemicals & Solvents (IC&S) division was established. The company's name was changed from \"Ashland Oil, Incorporated\" to the present \"Ashland Inc.\" in 1995, which noted the reduced importance of oil in the overall business.\n\nIn 1998, the petroleum division merged with Marathon Oil to form Marathon Ashland Petroleum, LLC (MAP). Following that in 1999, Ashland was #102 on the \"Forbes\" list of Fortune 500 companies when it agreed to sell its Scurlock Permian subsidiary to Plains All American Pipeline and the headquarters were moved from Ashland to Covington, Kentucky, although the company maintained an office building in Russell, adjacent to Ashland. A monumental change came in 2005, when Ashland sold its shares of the petroleum joint venture to Marathon Oil, effectively dissolving the remnants of their petroleum division. After the sale, the company was no longer involved in the refining or marketing of fuels. The original oil refinery in Catlettsburg, Kentucky, is still in operation to date, owned and operated by Marathon. In 2006, Ashland sold APAC (the paving and construction division) to the Oldcastle Materials subsidiary of Oldcastle Inc. of Dublin, Ireland.\n\nAshland purchased the adhesive and emulsions divisions of Air Products & Chemicals in 2008.\n\nAshland announced plans to acquire Hercules Inc. on July 11, 2008, for $3.3B. On November 13, 2008, the transaction was completed.\n\nIn July 2010 Ashland merged its foundry chemicals activity with Süd-Chemie of Munich, Germany, to form ASK Chemicals L.P. with headquarters in Dublin, Ohio.\n\nIn November 2010 Ashland announced plans to sell its distribution business known as Ashland Distribution to TPG Capital for $930 Million. The Ashland Distribution business had been a part of Ashland since 1969. With revenues of $3.4 billion, the Ashland Distribution business had approximately 2,000 employees across North America and Europe, and entered the China plastics market in 2009. The sale was finalized April 1, 2011, with a final sale price of US$979 million. The new privately held company is named Nexeo Solutions.\n\nIn May 2011 Ashland announced that it had bought the privately owned company International Specialty Products Inc. (ISP) for $3.2 billion. ISP is a supplier of specialty chemicals and performance-enhancing products for consumer and industrial markets.\n\nIn 2014, Ashland Water Technologies was sold to a private equity buyer.\n\nIn May 2017, Ashland separated its Valvoline business as Valvoline Inc. (NYSE:VVV), the final step of reorganizing itself as a global specialty chemicals company.\n\nIn January 2019, Ashland struck a deal with activist investor Cruiser Capital Advisors, which had planned to mount a proxy fight to replace four board directors. Instead, the two parties reached an agreement involving a consulting role for one of Cruiser's director nominees and more input regarding future board appointees. \n\nIn October 2019, Ashland announced Guillermo Novo would succeed William A. Wulfsohn as Chairman and CEO.\n\n\n"}

The operation also caused damage to the temple premises and casualties on both sides which angered the Sikhs. \n\nBeant Singh drew a .38 revolver and fired three shots into Indira Gandhi's abdomen; as she fell to the ground, Satwant Singh fired all 30 rounds from his Sten automatic weapon into her abdomen (thus, 33 bullets were fired in total, of which 30 bullets hit her).

In 2007, the death anniversaries of Satwant Singh and his wife were observed in various parts of Punjab and other countries. On 6 January 2008, the Akal Takht declared Beant Singh and Satwant Singh \"martyrs of Sikhism\", while the SGPC also labeled them \"martyrs of the Sikh nation\".\n\nThe Sikh-centric political party in India, Shiromani Akali Dal, observed the death anniversary of Beant Singh and Satwant Singh as \"martyrdom\" for the first time on 31 October 2008.

{"id": "1842056", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1842056", "title": "Digital matte artist", "text": "Digital matte artist\n\nA digital matte artist, or digital matte painter (DMP), is today's modern form of a traditional matte painter in the entertainment industry. He or she digitally paints photo-realistic interior and exterior environments that could not have been otherwise created or visited.\n\nThe term 'digital' is used to distinguish a DMP from a traditional matte painter, although this is unnecessary, as the nature of a matte painter's work remains the same, regardless of the tools and techniques used. Craig Barron, the co-founder of Matte World Digital, offered an insight regarding the transition of the art from traditional to digital in the following words:It is difficult to categorize what a matte painting shot is today... Most filmmakers still call what we do matte shots, and we like that because we see our work as an extension of the original craft. But it's more accurate to say we are involved in environment creation. \n\nTraditional matte painting is older than the movie camera itself and has actually been already practiced in the early years of photography to create painted elements in photographs. With the advantages of the digital age, matte painters have slowly transitioned to a digital work environment, using pressure-sensitive pens and graphic tablets in conjunction with a painting software such as Adobe Photoshop. A digital matte painter is part of a visual effects team being involved in post-production, as opposed to a traditional matte painter, who was a member of a special effects crew, often creating matte paintings on set to be used as backdrops. \n\nOne particular drawback to the work of the digital matte artist is an occasional tendency of their output to look too realistic, which traditional artists avoided by using impressionistic elements or by suggesting details. What this means is that digital matte art is often characterized by an artificially perfect look. One of the modern approaches adopted to address this is the integration of details from a photograph, say, of real places to depict realistic scenes. It is this reason why some digital matte artists refer to their work as a combination of digital painting, photo manipulation, and 3D, for the purpose of creating virtual sets that are hard or impossible to find in the real world.\n\nThe time period and extent of involvement of a digital matte artist in film production varies by the type of film and by the artist's supervisor's (film producer, film director, art director) intentions. However, there are artists such as Mathieu Raynault who stated that they are often brought into the production at a very early stage, providing sketches and concepts to get a dialogue started with the director or art director. Raynault was involved on films like \"300, \", and two \"Lord of the Rings\" films, among others.\n\nBecause of the growing need for 'moving' mattes, camera projection mapping has been implemented into the matte painting timeline. Although ILM CG Supervisor Stefen Fangmeier came up with the idea of projecting Yusei Uesugi's aerial painting of Neverland onto a 3D mesh modeled by Geoff Campbell while working on the motion picture \"Hook\" in 1991, projection-mapping based 3D environment matte art was until recently, like its predecessor matte painting has been, the industry's best-kept secret. The involvement of 3D in this until then 2D art form was revealed by Craig Barron in 1998 after completing their work on the feature film \"Great Expectations\" when they introduced this technique as a 2.5D matte to the public. In production today this combination of 2D and 3D is part of every matte artist's bread and butter.\n\nBecause of their high artistic skills, digital matte artists are often also involved with the creation of concept artwork.\n\n\n\n\n"}

After a brief spell as a Programme assistant at BBC Radio Solent, in 1989 Greening joined London's Local station BBC GLR as a producer, before becoming a presenter of their Breakfast show in 1991.\n\nIn April 1993, Greening joined the newly launched Virgin Radio, presenting a Friday and Saturday evening show and a Sunday morning show. After two months, he took over their weekday afternoon show, where he remained until he quit Virgin in December 1993.\n\nIn January 1994, Greening joined BBC Radio 1, presenting the Weekend Breakfast Show (Saturday and Sunday 710am). In the summer of '94, Radio 1 agreed to cover the Gay Pride event for the first time and these reports into the general days' output were fronted by Greening; the success of these led to Radio 1 becoming a regular fixture at Gay Pride events. In May 1995 Greening was named in Gay Times' \"Top 200 Gay Men and Lesbians\" as an out gay DJ.\n\nIn November 1994, Greening took over the Weekend Lunchtime show (Saturday and Sunday noon to 2pm). Again he featured many of his comedy characters (usually voiced by Andrew McGibbon) featured on Weekend Breakfast. October 1995 saw Greening move back to Weekend Breakfast where he would remain for another 16 months. Greening was given the Drivetime show in February 1997. Regular features on the show included the \"Joke du Jour\", \"60 Second Cinema\", and the \"Evening Procession\".\n\nEarly mornings seemed to play a big role during Greening's time at Radio 1, as he had presented Weekend Breakfast and had also been the main stand-in presenter for Steve Wright, Chris Evans and Mark Radcliffe on the weekday breakfast show, but October 1997 saw Greening present \"The Radio 1 Breakfast Show\" alongside Zoe Ball, where he would remain for 12 months.\n\nGreening moved to a Sunday morning show from 6:30 to 10am in September 1998. At the time he was also presenting shows for BBC World Service and a TV show for digital station BBC Choice. It was during this period that Greening became the main stand-in presenter on the network, covering for many weekday presenters including Scott Mills, Simon Mayo and Mark Radcliffe. There was also a period when Greening took over the weekday lunchtime show whilst regular presenter Jo Whiley was away on maternity leave. He occasionally made light of his status as a stand-in presenter, giving an alternative email address as supply.dj@bbc.co.uk (his main address being kevin.greening@bbc.co.uk)\n\nOn Sunday 16 January 2000, Greening presented his final Radio 1 show. In the last half-hour he played some of the sketches from his time with the station.\n\nNot long after he left Radio 1, in 2000 Greening moved to BBC Radio 5 Live, where he was a stand-in presenter for various daytime slots.\n\nIn March 2001, whilst undertaking supply work at Five Live, he began co-presenting a Saturday Morning show on GLR's replacement, BBC London Live, alongside Amanda Hussain, the show went out from 8 to 11am on Saturday mornings and lasted until September the same year when the show was taken over by Danny Baker.\n\nFrom late 2001 into 2002, 102.2 Jazz FM employed him for various slots, then in May 2002, he briefly joined London's Heart 106.2 presenting their 26pm weekend afternoon show.\n\nIn June 2002, he joined London's Rock station XFM, sitting in for Christian O'Connell on the Breakfast Show. One month later, he took over the station's mid-morning slot from 10am to 1pm, where he remained until December 2003.\n\nIn January 2004, he was moved to the Station's \"Best of X\" show on Saturday evenings from 6 to 9pm.\n\nAfter a stand-in stint on the BBC Radio 6 Music Night Train programme, and in addition to his Saturday evening show on XFM in April 2004, he re-joined 102.2 Jazz FM to present a Sunday morning show from 10am to 2pm. Shortly after, he also took over from Clive Warren on Saturdays from 10am to 2pm.\n\nOn 7 June 2005, he took over the 10am3pm slot on 102.2 Jazz FM's replacement, 102.2 Smooth FM. From 26 March 2007, he moved to a 14pm weekday afternoon slot on the relaunched 102.2 Smooth Radio where he built up a cult following. His \"game with no name\" quiz show, in which listeners had to suggest the most suitable song to play against a particular news item, was particularly popular.\n\nHe also presented Saturday afternoons from 2 to 5pm on the station.\n\nGreening was awarded a Fellowship by The Radio Academy in 2001. He was the only non-executive ever to be so honoured in the academy's 25 years.\n\nGreening was openly gay and had a previous long-term relationship with Andy Lowe, whom he often referred to on air as his \"lesbian life-partner\" or \"live-in chum\". When their relationship came to an end in 2005, after a brief separation they continued to share their house in north London.\n\nAt the time of his death Greening had been in a relationship with Sean Griffin for some time.\n\nOn 30 December 2007, it was announced by Chris North, Greening's agent, that Greening had \"died peacefully in his sleep\" one day before his 45th birthday. His boyfriend, Sean Griffin, was arrested the following day in connection with his death, and for possession of a Class A drug, but charges in relation to Greening's death were not pursued by police.\n\nOn 3 January 2008, it was revealed following the post-mortem that Greening died of a heart attack after taking large quantities of cocaine, ecstasy and GHB. He had spent part of the night prior to his death at the Recon event held at The Arches nightclub in Southwark, London.\n\nGreening was buried on 18 January 2008 in a woodland burial ground after a secular humanist farewell ceremony in accordance with his wishes.\n\nAt the inquest into his death, a verdict of death by misadventure was recorded as a result of a self-induced drug overdose during a bondage session.\n\nAfter his death an award was named after him at the Student Radio Association's annual Student Radio Awards. The Kevin Greening Award is dedicated to recognising unique on-air creativity, for which Greening was known.\n\n"}

{"id": "1842082", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1842082", "title": "Sagebrush Rebellion", "text": "Sagebrush Rebellion\n\nThe Sagebrush Rebellion was a movement in the western United States during the 1970s and 1980s that sought major changes to federal land control, use, and disposal policy in thirteen western states, where federal land holdings include between 20% and 85% of a state's area. Supporters of this movement wanted more state and local control over these lands, if not outright transfer of them to state and local authorities and/or As much of the land in question is sagebrush steppe, supporters adopted the name \"Sagebrush Rebellion.\"\n\nThe movement continues to have support by persons interested in developing the lands for resource extraction and private benefits, such as livestock grazing, mineral extraction, and timber harvesting. Opponents place higher value on private economic benefits through recreation, and societal benefits of open space and hard-to-quantify economic benefits of ecosystem services.\n\nThe term \"Sagebrush Rebellion\" was coined during fights over designation of National Wilderness lands, especially in Western states, and especially after the U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management conducted required surveys of plots of public lands of at least that had had roads removed after 1972 for potential designation as part of the National Wilderness Preservation System. This process was known as the \"Roadless Area Review and Evaluation\" (RARE, or later, RARE I). The RARE process developed significant opposition from both environmental groups and public lands users, and was challenged in federal court. Results of RARE I were nullified by the courts for lack of uniform criteria for evaluation of lands and other procedural problems. A second review started in 1977, known as RARE II, involving more than 60 million acres (240,000 km²) of wildland under federal jurisdiction. RARE II was completed in 1979. However, the effort was largely sidelined during the presidency of Republican Ronald Reagan, who was elected in 1980. Reagan declared himself a sagebrush rebel in an August 1980 campaign speech in Salt Lake City, telling the crowd, \"I happen to be one who cheers and supports the Sagebrush Rebellion. Count me in as a rebel.\" Reagan faced opposition from conservation organizations. This struggle persists today after changing form with the \"wise use movement\" in 1988. Even so, Congress has designated several wilderness areas since 1981, sometimes using data acquired through the RARE processes.\n\nThe National Wilderness Preservation System grew out of recommendations of a Kennedy-administration Presidential Commission, the Outdoor Recreational Resources Review Commission chaired by Laurence S. Rockefeller, whose 1962 report suggested legislation to protect recreational resources in a \"national system of wild and scenic rivers\", a national wilderness system, a national trails system, the federal Land and Water Conservation Fund, and recreation areas administered by then-existing public lands agencies beyond National Parks and National Monuments (both of which are administered in the Department of the Interior by the National Park Service).\n\nMuch of the wildland was sagebrush, which some wanted to use for grazing, off-road vehicle use, and other development instead of wilderness conservation. These \"rebels\" urged that, instead of designating more federal wilderness protection, some or much of the land be granted to states or private parties. They took on the phrase \"Sagebrush Rebellion\" to describe their opposition to federal management of these lands.\n\nComplaints about federal management of public lands constantly roil relations between public lands users — ranchers, miners, researchers, off-road vehicle (ORV) enthusiasts, hikers, campers and conservation advocates — and the agencies and environmental regulation on the other. Ranchers complain that grazing fees are too high. They also complain that grazing regulations are too onerous despite environmentalist complaints that the opposite is true, and that promised improvements to grazing on federal lands do not occur. Miners complain of restricted access to claims, or to lands to prospect. Researchers complain of the difficulty of getting research permits, only to encounter other obstacles in research, including uncooperative permit holders and, especially in archaeology, vandalized sites with key information destroyed. ORV users want free access while hikers and campers and conservationists complain grazing is not regulated enough and that some mineral lease holders abuse other lands, or that ORV use destroys the resource. Each of these complaints has a long history.\n\nAmong the first pieces of legislation passed following independence was the Land Ordinance of 1785, which provided for the surveying and sale of lands in the area created by State cessions of western land to the national government. Later, the Northwest Ordinance provided for political organization of the Northwest Territories (the present-day states of Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio, Illinois, Indiana and part of northeastern Minnesota).\n\nIn order to encourage settlement of western lands, Congress passed the first of several Homestead Acts in 1862, granting parcels in increments to homesteaders who could maintain a living on land for a period of time. Congress also made huge land grants to various railroads working to complete a transcontinental rail system. Much of these latter grants intentionally included mineral and timber-rich lands so that the railroads could get financing to build. Again, the hypothesis was that the railroads would sell off the land to get money.\n\nUltimately, however, it turned out that much land west of the Missouri River was not ecologically suited for homesteading because of mountainous terrain, poor soils, lack of available water and other ecological barriers to significant settlement. By the early 20th century, the federal government held significant portions of most western states that had simply not been claimed for any use. Conservationists prevailed upon President Theodore Roosevelt to set aside lands for forest conservation and for special scientific or natural history interest. Much land still remained unclaimed even after such reserves were initially set up. The Department of the Interior held millions of acres in the western states (with Arizona and New Mexico joining the union by 1913). President Hoover proposed to deed the surface rights to the unappropriated lands to the states in 1932, but the states complained that the lands had been overgrazed and would, in other ways, impose a burden on Great Depression-era cash-strapped state budgets. The Bureau of Land Management was created to manage much of that land.\n\nVarious bills intended to transfer federal public lands to western states had been proposed after 1932, all failing to garner much attention, let alone action. Among key objections to such transfers were the increasing value to the federal treasury of mineral lease receipts and complaints that the \"crown jewels\" of the national lands holdings, the National Parks, could not be managed adequately or fairly by individual states. Yellowstone and Yosemite National Parks were considered to be national treasures, and few legislators would concur with turning them over to the states.\n\nThe spark that turned these complaints into a \"rebellion\" was the enactment in 1976 of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act that ended homesteading, which meant that the federal government would retain control of western public lands. The act sought to establish a system of land management by the Bureau of Land Management. While the act required the bureau to plan land use accommodating all users, specifically naming ranching, grazing, and mining, it also introduced formal processes to consider preservation of the land from those uses. \n\nNewly elected Senator Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) joined in land transfer legislation efforts in 1977, after loud complaints from ranchers and oilmen from Utah, coupled with strong support from several Utah county governments. By late 1979, Hatch was the legislator most interested in land transfers. He sought to introduce a transfer bill that would get hearings and potential action. Upon advice of members of the Utah Wilderness Commission, appointed by Utah Governor Scott Matheson, Hatch agreed to leave National Parks and National Monuments in federal hands, and he drafted a bill that would allow states to apply for control over selected parcels. With 16 cosponsors, he introduced the bill in 1979, and again in 1981. Partly because Hatch's bill dealt with major objections to previous bills, news outlets for the first time covered the bill as if it had a serious chance of passing. This started a two-year newspaper, radio, and television fight for the legislation.\n\nUltimately, Hatch's bill got little more than press attention. The election of Ronald Reagan as president put a friend to the Sagebrush Rebels in the White House, James G. Watt, and his appointees slowed or closed down wilderness designation legislation. By Reagan's second term, the Sagebrush Rebellion was back to simmering on the back burner of federal land management agencies.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1842092", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1842092", "title": "509 Harbourfront", "text": "509 Harbourfront\n\n509 Harbourfront is a streetcar route in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, operated by the Toronto Transit Commission.\n\nThe 509 Harbourfront began service in 1990 as the \"604 Harbourfront\" and was referred to as the \"Harbourfront LRT\". It was the first new Toronto streetcar route in many years, and the first to employ a dedicated tunnel, approximately long. The route starts with an underground loop at Union station, runs south along Bay Street to the underground Queens Quay station, then turns west and emerges onto Queens Quay. The line's original terminus was Queens Quay and Spadina Loop, at the foot of Spadina Avenue; beyond this point non-revenue track ran north on Spadina to King, to connect the new line with the rest of the network.\n\nNumbers in the 600-series were used at that time within the TTC for rapid transit routes (i.e., subways and the Scarborough RT) rather than single-digit numbers as is the case today, and the Harbourfront LRT was given the number 601 to indicate that it was different from other streetcar routes. The 1990 \"TTC Ride Guide\" indicated the route with its own colour like a subway line rather than as a streetcar route. Since the route is not grade-separated, this was later felt to be misleading and it was treated like other streetcar lines, taking the number 510.\n\nIn 1997, the completion of a dedicated right-of-way on Spadina Avenue resulted in the Harbourfront route being relaunched as the 510 Spadina. The \"Harbourfront\" route name disappeared until 2000, when the Queens Quay streetcar tracks were extended west to Bathurst and Fleet Streets. The Harbourfront was then reinstated with the new number 509, and extended to Exhibition Loop at Exhibition Place, sharing its route with the 510 from Union to Spadina and with the 511 Bathurst from Bathurst onwards. Between September 2007 and March 2008, the Fleet Street portion of Route 509 has since been converted to a parallel private right-of-way, so that the entire route operates entirely separate from road traffic.\n\nIn July 2012 Waterfront Toronto began a major reconstruction of Queens Quay West, requiring the 509 streetcar to be replaced with buses for the duration of the construction. On 12 October 2014, streetcar service resumed on 509 Harbourfront route after an absence of over two years in order to rebuild the street to a new design, and to replace tracks. With the new street design, two auto lanes south of the streetcar tracks were eliminated from Spadina Avenue to York Street in order to extend Harbourfront parkland to the edge of the streetcar right-of-way. Thus, streetcars now effectively run on a roadside right-of-way instead of a mid-street median. A bicycle path and rows of trees are located on the immediate south side of the right-of-way.\n\nBy August 2016, after the reconstruction of Queens Quay West, the TTC reported that streetcars were taking 40 minutes to make a round trip instead of an expected 34 minutes. The new side-of-road track design results in streetcars encountering more traffic lights, pedestrians and cyclists, the latter two requiring streetcar to operate slowly to avoid collisions. TTC service planner Scott Haskill suggested that \"public realm and urban design\" drove the Queens Quay redevelopment at the expense of transit planning. However, accidents along Queens Quay are no more frequent than along other streets. Transit advocate Steve Munro analyzed the route's performance for May 2016 and concluded that the extra running time was consumed from Queens Quay Loop to the intersection of Bathurst and Fleet streets, and that the running time east of Spadina Avenue was the same as before the reconstruction because of fixes to traffic signal problems.\nBetween 2014 and January 2020, there were 27 instances of private unauthorized automobiles driving down the ramp of the streetcar tunnel entrance just east of York Street and getting trapped in the tunnel. In a January 2020 incident, a motorist bypassed bollards, flashing lights and gates to become stuck at Union Station. These tunnel intrusions have negatively affected both 509 Harbourfront and 510 Spadina service.\n\nOn 12 September 2017, 509 Harbourfront became the first streetcar route in Toronto to operate Flexity streetcars with electrical pickup by pantograph instead of trolley pole. Pending the conversion of the overhead on other streetcar lines, runs to and from the carhouse continue to use trolley poles, with the changeover taking place at Exhibition Loop.\n\nThe 604 Harbourfront route began operating in 1990 using rebuilt PCC streetcars belonging to the TTC's A-15 PCC classification. (The A-15 class PCCs were rebuilt from A-9 class cars purchased new in 1950–1951.)\n\nThe PCC cars were replaced by CLRV streetcars in 1994 due to complaints of squealing from the PCC wheels.\n\nOn 29 March 2015, Flexity Outlook low-floor vehicles were introduced on the 509 Harbourfront streetcar line. Since March 2017, the line has operated exclusively with Flexity vehicles, making the route fully accessible.\n\nThe TTC used to operate one of its two remaining PCC cars (of the A-15 class) on Sunday afternoons during the summer between Victoria Day and Labour Day. The PCC operated as an unscheduled extra subject to the availability of a PCC and a driver trained to operate it. This service had occurred in 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2016 and 2017.\n\nMost stops along the 509 route are surface stops with islands separating the regular traffic from the streetcar tracks. Streetcars begin underground at Union station and pass through a dedicated underground streetcar station at Queens Quay before climbing to the surface.\n\nA proposed Waterfront West project would extend the Harbourfront line farther west to join the existing right-of-way along the Queensway. This project was shelved by the city in 2013, but was revived for reconsideration in 2015.\n\n"}
{"id": "1842101", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1842101", "title": "New Grass Revival", "text": "New Grass Revival\n\nNew Grass Revival was an American progressive bluegrass band founded in 1971, and composed of Sam Bush, Courtney Johnson, Ebo Walker, Curtis Burch, Butch Robins, John Cowan, Béla Fleck and Pat Flynn. They were active between 1971 and 1989, releasing more than twenty albums as well as six singles. Their highest-charting single is \"Callin' Baton Rouge\", which peaked at No. 37 on the U.S. country charts in 1989 and was a Top 5 country hit for Garth Brooks five years later.\n\nThe origins of New Grass Revival lay in the Bluegrass Alliance, which Sam Bush (vocals, fiddle, guitar, mandolin) and Courtney Johnson (banjo, vocals) joined in 1970. At the time, the Alliance also featured bassist Ebo Walker and fiddler Lonnie Peerce. Within a year after Bush's and Johnson's arrival, Curtis Burch (dobro, guitar, vocals) joined the band. In 1972, Peerce left the band, and the remaining members decided to continue under the new name New Grass Revival. The band released their eponymous debut album \"The Arrival of the New Grass Revival\" later in 1972 on Starday Records.\n\nOther groups were also playing progressive bluegrass at the time, such as The Dillards, Eddie Adcock's II Generation, and the Country Gentlemen, but few did it with the flair of the New Grass Revival. At the time, bluegrass was a very tradition-bound music; bands were expected to have short hair and dress in matching outfits. The New Grass Revival bucked these traditions, with long hair, informal clothing, and performances of songs from a variety of genres, including music by Jerry Lee Lewis (\"Great Balls of Fire\"), the Beatles (\"Get Back\"; \"I'm Down\"), Bob Marley (\"One Love/People Get Ready\"), and protest songs (\"One Tin Soldier\"). This break from bluegrass tradition was not well received in some quarters—some thought it wasn't the way Bill Monroe meant for Bluegrass to be played. \"Our reason for doing the newer-type music wasn't pretentious or irreverent or sarcastic or disrespectful,\" explained Curtis Burch. \"We just felt like people were ready to see that you could really expand the sound, using those same instruments.\" (Monroe was a fan of New Grass Revival.) In 1979, they became the backup group and opening act for Leon Russell, further alienating them from the mainstream bluegrass community.\n\nAfter the release of their debut, Walker parted ways with the band, and the group replaced him with Butch Robins, who was only with the band for a short time. He was replaced by John Cowan, an Evansville, Indiana, native. This lineup was stable throughout the 1970s, recording a number of albums for Flying Fish Records. As their name suggested, New Grass Revival never played traditional bluegrass—all of the members brought elements of rock & roll, jazz, and blues to the group's sound. Consequently, certain portions of the bluegrass community scorned them, but they also gained a devoted following of listeners who believed they were moving the genre in a new, fresh direction. For example, they played regularly to sold-out shows at Amazingrace Coffeehouse in the Chicago metro area.\n\nIn 1981 Johnson and Burch left the band, claiming they were tired of touring. Bush and Cowan continued the group, replacing them with virtuoso banjoist Béla Fleck and guitarist Pat Flynn. These two moved the band to new musical heights. Fleck's compositions such as \"Metric Lips\", \"Seven by Seven\" and \"Big Foot\" were very well received as were Pat Flynn's \"Do What You Gotta Do\", \"Lonely Rider\" and \"On The Boulevard\". Pat Flynn also brought strong lead and harmony vocals to the group as well as a distinctive guitar style.\n\nIn 1984 the group moved to Sugar Hill Records, and released their first album featuring the new lineup, \"On the Boulevard\". In 1986 the band signed with EMI Records and released an eponymous album \"New Grass Revival\", which proved to be their breakthrough into the mainstream. Two of the singles from the album, \"What You Do to Me\" and \"Ain't That Peculiar\" were minor hits on the country charts, and Fleck's showcase \"Seven by Seven\" was nominated for a Grammy for Best Country Instrumental. \"Hold to a Dream\", released in 1987, was just as successful as its predecessor, featuring the hits \"Unconditional Love\" and \"Can't Stop Now,\" both of which nearly made the Top 40.\n\nIn 1989, New Grass Revival released their third major-label album, \"Friday Night in America\", which was yet another commercial success. \"Callin' Baton Rouge\" became their first Top 40 single, followed by the number 58 hit \"You Plant Your Fields.\" Even though the band was more popular than ever, Bush decided to pull the plug on the group after the release of \"Friday Night in America\". Bush formed The Sam Bush Band, and Fleck went on to a successful and respected solo career. \nIn 1993, Bush, Cowan, Fleck, and Flynn returned to the studio, to back Garth Brooks, on his recording of \"Callin' Baton Rouge\".\n\nBanjoist Courtney Johnson died of lung cancer in 1996 at age 56. Bush, Fleck, Cowan, and Burch reunited for one concert (September 24, 1996) at the Ryman Auditorium in Nashville, Tennessee to benefit his widow.\nThe concert included a number of musicians and groups, such as John Hartford, Hot Rize, Tim O'Brien, Vassar Clements, Del McCoury Band, Ricky Skaggs, Pete Rowan, Jerry Douglas and others.\n\nIn 1997, when Garth Brooks was invited on Late Night with Conan O'Brien to perform \"Do What You Gotta Do\", a song written by Pat Flynn, he asked Flynn, Bush, Cowan, and Fleck to join him in performing it. Since that performance, Flynn has worked with both Cowan and Fleck, but not Bush. Likewise, Bush has also worked with Cowan and Fleck on numerous occasions.

{"id": "1842118", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1842118", "title": "Ithaca Gun Company", "text": "Ithaca Gun Company\n\nThe Ithaca Gun Company is a manufacturer of shotguns and rifles originally established in Ithaca, New York in 1880.\n\nOver the years, Ithaca made numerous firearms, most notably the Ithaca Flues double barrel shotgun, the all-time best-selling American made double, and the Ithaca 37 shotgun.\n\nIthaca became famous for building firearms based on expired patents owned by Remington Arms. They also purchased patents from other firearm designers. In 1895 Emil Flues was granted Patent # 546,516, for a double barrel shotgun with only three moving parts per barrel. Ithaca bought the patent in 1907 and upgraded the design to allow for mass production. With the Flues designed Ithaca double, which became the best selling American double of all time with more than 223,000 produced between 1908 and 1926, Ithaca effectively drove Remington out of the double gun market.\n\nIthaca also produced the M1911 pistol during World War II and the M3 Grease Gun during Korean War, both for the United States military. Its 12-gauge shotguns were the standard used by the Los Angeles Police Department and New York Police Department, and sold to the Royal Thai Army in the early 1980s to arm farmers against communist insurgents. Its hunting shotguns were known for their fine decorative work, typically waterfowl or hunting dogs. In 1989, Remington purchased a design from Ithaca, the Mag-10 shotgun, which they produced as the SP-10.\n\nAround 1877, brothers Lyman Cornelius and Leroy Smith went into business with William Henry Baker. They moved the \"W.H. Baker Company\", which manufactured double- and triple-barreled shotguns, from Center Lisle, New York to Syracuse. In 1883, Baker and Leroy Smith left the company, moved to Ithaca, and established the original Ithaca Gun Company with several partners. The company was responsible for much of the early industry of Tompkins County, especially during World War I and World War II, and counted among its patrons John Philip Sousa, Annie Oakley, and Alfred Lee Loomis At the time Sousa was president of the American Trap Shooters Association and The Ithaca gun company named a shotgun in his honor, the Sousa Grade. Annie Oakley used an Ithaca Flues model in her competition and exhibition shooting. In 1917, Alfred Loomis and his brother-in-law, purchased 17,000 acres (69 km2) of Hilton Head Island, which they established as a private hunting preserve and purchased Ithaca shotguns for use by guests. Dwight D. Eisenhower and George C. Marshall also owned Ithaca double barrel shotguns\n\nThe \"Lefever Arms Company\" (1883–1916) was a manufacturer of guns in Syracuse, New York founded by Daniel Myron LeFever (1835–1906) who was an American gun maker, popularly known as \"Uncle Dan LeFever\". He is best known as the inventor of the hammerless shotgun, first introduced in 1878. The company was in the business of gun manufacture until 1916 when they were incorporated with Ithaca Gun Company in Ithaca, New York who continued with the LeFever gun production until 1921. Although production of the LeFever Sidelock Model designed by Dan LeFever ended, the Ithaca gun company continued to use the LeFever name on Boxlock action double and single barrel guns, until 1941.\n\nThe original factory was located in the Fall Creek neighborhood of the city, on a slope later known as \"Gun Hill\", where the nearby waterfall supplied the main source of energy for the plant. In later years, the company came under criticism regarding environmental pollution of Fall Creek, especially by lead, which led to a Superfund remediation effort. Various plans to demolish the derelict plant and to redevelop the land failed over the years due to the cost of remediation and community objection to construction proposals. The factory was condemned in March 2006 and only the smokestack remains. An apartment project has been proposed for the site. Despite having moved 6000 tons of lead-contaminated material between 2002 and 2004 at a cost of $4.8 million, it was still necessary to perform even more clean up at the superfund site in 2015.\n\nThe company was controlled by the Smith family until 1967, when it was sold to a Colorado company, Jerry Baldritch & Asso., which later, after buying 10X Clothing, Atlantic Dinghy, and American Fiberglass, became General Recreation, Inc. and in 1971(approx.) made a public stock offering on the NYSE. General Recreation encountered financial problems in the late 1970s, selling off all its subsidiaries except Ithaca Gun. After a failed attempt to move manufacturing to Colorado, it filed for Chapter 11 reorganization in December 1978, shuttering the plant on December 20 for several months. General Recreation filed for bankruptcy a second time in September 1985.\n\nIn 1987, new owners Ithaca Acquisition, Inc. moved manufacturing to King Ferry, New York. In 2005, it received a $150,000 development loan from Cayuga County, and in May of that year moved to larger facilities in Auburn. After being unable to facilitate an operational manufacturing facility in Auburn, the owners sold all of Ithaca's assets, trademarks, and manufacturing rights to the Marshalls from Upper Sandusky, Ohio. The physical goods were relocated to Floyd Marshall's 30+ years tool and die shop where all prints, programs, and processing were converted to CNC machine tools. Unable to secure state or local financing assistance with the startup conversion, the Marshalls were forced to sell the company. Dave Dlubak purchased the company in June 2007, and it continues to operate in Upper Sandusky, Ohio. It has undergone a revamp with newer manufacturing equipment, and still employs many of the people from Floyd Marshall's original staff.\n\n\n"}

Kramers wanted to obtain foreign experience during his doctoral research, but his first choice of supervisor, Max Born in Göttingen, was not reachable because of the first world war. Because Denmark was neutral in this war, as was the Netherlands, he travelled (by ship, overland was impossible) to Copenhagen, where he visited unannounced the then still relatively unknown Niels Bohr. Bohr took him on as a Ph.D. candidate and Kramers prepared his dissertation under Bohr's direction. Although Kramers did most of his doctoral research (on intensities of atomic transitions) in Copenhagen, he obtained his formal Ph.D. under Ehrenfest in Leiden, on 8 May 1919.\n\nKramers greatly enjoyed music and could play the cello and the piano.\n\nAfter working for almost ten years in Bohr's group and becoming an associate professor at the University of Copenhagen, Kramers left Denmark in 1926 and returned to the Netherlands. He became a full professor in theoretical physics at Utrecht University, where he supervised Tjalling Koopmans. In 1934 he left Utrecht and succeeded Paul Ehrenfest in Leiden. From 1931 until his death he held also a cross appointment at Delft University of Technology.\n\nKramers was one of the founders of the Mathematisch Centrum in Amsterdam.\n\nIn 1925, with Werner Heisenberg he developed the Kramers–Heisenberg dispersion formula. He is also credited with introducing in 1948 the concept of renormalization into quantum field theory, although his approach was nonrelativistic.. He is also credited for the Kramers–Kronig relations with Ralph Kronig which are mathematical equations relating real and imaginary parts of complex functions constrained by causality. One further refers to a Kramer's turnover when the rate of thermally activated barrier crossing as a function of the damping goes through a maximum, thereby undergoing a transition between the energy diffusion and spatial diffusion regimes. \n\nOn 25 October 1920 he was married to Anna Petersen. They had three daughters and one son.\n\nKramers became member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1929, he was forced to resign in 1942. He joined the Academy again in 1945. Kramers won the Lorentz Medal in 1947 and Hughes Medal in 1951.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1842124", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1842124", "title": "Orcadas Base", "text": "Orcadas Base\n\nBase Orcadas is an Argentine scientific station in Antarctica, and the oldest of the stations in Antarctica still in operation. It is located on Laurie Island, one of the South Orkney Islands (), at above sea level and from the coastline. Established by the Scottish National Antarctic Expedition in 1903 and transferred to the Argentine government in 1904, the base has been permanently populated since, being one of six Argentine permanent bases in Argentina's claim to Antarctica, and the first permanently inhabited base in Antarctica.\n\nThe nearest port is the Argentine city of Ushuaia, which is away. The base has 11 buildings and four main topics of research: continental glaciology, seismology, sea-ice-zone glaciology (since 1985) and meteorological observations (since 1903).\n\nOrcadas was the only station on the islands for 40 years until the British established a small summer base, Cape Geddes Station in Laurie Island in 1946, replaced by Signy Research Station in Signy Island in 1947. It also had the first radiotelegraph in the continent in 1927. The 11 buildings of the station house up to 45 people during the summer, and an average of 14 during winter.\n\nIn 1903 Dr William S. Bruce's Scottish National Antarctic Expedition established \"Omond House\", a meteorological station on Laurie Island. During the expedition, however, the crew became stuck in the ice and, unable to sail off, were trapped in the station for the winter.\n\nBruce left the station in December of that year for Buenos Aires to fix the ship and obtain supplies, leaving meteorologist Robert C. Mossman in charge of the base to continue the observations.\n\nBruce offered to the Government of President Julio Argentino Roca the transfer of the station and instruments for the sum of 5.000 pesos, on the condition that the government committed itself to the continuation of the scientific mission. He also offered to transport in his ship the appointed personnel back to the station.\n\nBruce had informed the British officer William Haggard of his intentions in December 1903. On 29 December, Haggard sent a note to the Argentine Foreign Minister, José Terry, ratifying the terms of Bruce proposition. Roca submitted the matter to the \"Oficina Meteorológica Nacional\" (National Office of Meteorology) who advised him to accept the offer. On January 2, 1904, the installations were accepted through a presidential decree.\n\nThe \"Scotia\" sailed back for Laurie Island on 14 January 1904 carrying on board Luciano H. Valette, from the Office of Zoology of the Ministry of Agriculture, Edgard C. Szmula, employee of the National Meteorological Office, and Hugo Acuña, from the Ministry of Livestock, who was also designated Postal Chief of the Orkney Islands by the Director General of the National Postal and Telegraphs Office, Manuel García Fernández. Mossman was left in charge of the expedition, along with William Smith as cook.\n\nIn 1906, Argentina communicated to the international community the establishment of a permanent base on the South Orkney Islands. On August 26, Haggard sent a letter to Foreign Minister Manuel Montes de Oca reminding him that South Orkneys Islands were British. The British position was that Argentine personnel was granted permission only for the period of one year. Argentine government ignored the note, \"considering it out of time\".\n\nOn March 30, 1927, naval non-commissioned officer Emilio Baldoni established the first radio telegraph link with Ushuaia. Up to that point, the Orcadas Base remained isolated from the rest of the world until the yearly relief arrived. The radio station (coded LRT in Argentina) allowed for a permanent communication link.\n\nThe station depended on the Ministry of Agriculture until Argentine Navy relieved the crew with navy personnel on March 3, 1951. Formal transfer occurred on December 23, 1952, when by presidential decree the base was put under the Service of Maritime Hydrography as \"Destacamento Naval Orcadas\".\n\nUnder the Köppen climate classification system, the station is located under a tundra climate (\"ET\"), very close to an ice cap climate (\"EF\"). The base is influenced by the cold Antarctic Circumpolar Current that runs past the Weddell Sea and the strong westerly winds, creating a colder climate than the coastal areas in the northwestern parts of the Antarctic Peninsula. Weather conditions can vary widely from year to year and day to day since low pressure systems frequently pass through the islands, which influences the climate.\n\nMean monthly temperatures range from in June to in February. In summer, the average high is while the average low is . During winter, the average high is while the average low is . Temperatures can occasionally rise above freezing during winter. When low pressure systems pass to the south of the base, they can result in exceptionally mild temperatures, with the highest temperature recorded being in 1987. However, when this occurs, the weather is stormy and cloudy with reduced visibility. In contrast, when low pressure systems pass to the north, it results in cold and dry conditions with good visibility, causing temperatures to fall to .\n\nFog is a frequent occurrence in the base, averaging 110 days. This can vary from year to year with 1987 being the foggiest year when there were 252 days with fog to only 30 days with fog in 1963. Being located in the path of low pressure systems throughout the year, the base experiences high cloud cover, particularly in summer. December and January are the cloudiest months, averaging 29 cloudy days each month. Winters are less cloudy, averaging 20 cloudy days in June and July. Clear days are extremely rare and are only occur between May to October, averaging 1–3 days. As a result, the base only averages 483.0 hours of sunshine per year or 13.5% of possible sunshine (possibly the lowest on earth), ranging from a low of 9.3% in January to a high of 22.5% in August.\n\nDecember and January are the least windy months, averaging while August and September are the windiest months, averaging more than . The base is subjected to strong winds throughout the year, with each month averaging 20 days with strong winds (wind speeds above ). Occasionally, it can experience gusts above .\n\nThe average annual precipitation is , which is fairly evenly distributed throughout the year. March is the wettest month while June is the driest month. Due to the cold climate and high humidity, snowfall occurs frequently throughout the year. Based on the 1961–1990 period, the base averages 227 days with snow, with February having the least days with snow (averaging 14 days with snow) and May having the most days with snow (averaging 22 days).\n\n\n"}

The station is owned by the CBS Television Stations subsidiary of ViacomCBS, as part of a duopoly with Stockton-licensed CBS owned-and-operated station KOVR (channel 13). The two stations share studios on KOVR Drive in West Sacramento and transmitter facilities in Walnut Grove. There is no separate website for KMAX-TV; instead, it is integrated with that of sister station KOVR.\n\nOn cable, KMAX-TV is available locally on Comcast Xfinity channels 12 and 712 in HD, AT&T U-verse channels 31 and 1031 in HD, Consolidated Communications channels 12 and 612 in HD, Spectrum channels 12 and 782 in HD and Wave Broadband channels 11 and 711 in HD in Placer County and channels 7 and 781 in HD in Yolo County.\n\nThe station first signed on the air on October 5, 1974 as KMUV-TV, operating as an independent station. It originally operated from studio facilities located on Media Place in Sacramento. The station was originally owned by Sid Grayson and had carried an all-movie format to counter-program against the area's other established stations, particularly then-independent KTXL (channel 40, now a Fox affiliate). However, on May 1, 1976, KMUV abandoned its all-movie format and largely began to air Spanish-language programming, along with some English-language religious programs (such as \"The PTL Club\").\n\nOn April 2, 1981, Koplar Broadcasting (then-owner and founder of St. Louis' KPLR-TV) purchased channel 31 and relaunched it on April 6 of that year under the callsign KRBK-TV (named for company founder Harold Koplar's son, Robert \"Bob\" Koplar), formatted as an English-language general entertainment independent to compete directly with KTXL.\nPappas Telecasting purchased the station in 1994. On January 11, 1995, the station changed its call letters to KPWB-TV (for Pappas WB) to reflect its affiliation with The WB Television Network, which launched the same day. Paramount Stations Group bought the station in March 1998, thus resulting in an affiliation swap with KQCA (channel 58) on January 5 of that year, that saw the UPN affiliation move to channel 31, which assumed the present call letters KMAX-TV, while The WB affiliation moved to KQCA. With Paramount's ownership stake in UPN, KMAX became the first English-language station in Sacramento to be owned and operated by a major network. Viacom acquired CBS in 1999, merging Paramount Stations Group with CBS' owned-and-operated stations to form the Viacom Television Stations Group.\n\nChannel 31 was the flagship television home of the NBA's Sacramento Kings from the 1988–89 season until the middle of the 2002–03 season, when the team's owners, the Maloof family, terminated the station's contract due to the Kings forming their own sales and marketing departments and taking the ad sales \"in house.\" KMAX remains the local over-the-air affiliate of the San Francisco Giants Major League Baseball franchise. It also held local broadcast rights to the Oakland Athletics before that team moved all its telecasts to regional sports network Comcast SportsNet California in 2009.\n\nIn May 2005, Viacom purchased KOVR from the Sinclair Broadcast Group, creating a duopoly with KMAX; KMAX's operations were also relocated to KOVR's studios in West Sacramento. Seven months later, Viacom divested itself of CBS due to the company's split into two separate entities (one of which retained the Viacom name); KOVR and KMAX, along with the other CBS and UPN stations operated by Viacom, became part of the newly formed CBS Corporation.\n\nOn January 24, 2006, CBS Corporation and Time Warner's Warner Bros. Entertainment (the division that operated The WB) announced that they would dissolve UPN and The WB, and move some of their programming to a newly created network, The CW. KMAX, as a CBS-owned UPN station, was tapped to become the market's affiliate of the new network through an 11-station affiliation deal, and became a charter affiliate of The CW on September 18, 2006. The station changed its on-air branding from \"UPN 31\" to \"CW31\" one month before The CW's September 18 launch to reflect this. As the Sacramento affiliate of The CW, KMAX-TV airs the Saturday morning educational \"One Magnificent Morning\" lineup on a four-hour delay, from 11:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. due to the Saturday edition of \"Good Day\" (it formerly aired until 4:00 p.m. until the block was cut by two hours in October 2017).\n\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\nKMAX-TV shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 31, on June 12, 2009, as part of the federally mandated transition from analog to digital television. The station's digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 21, using PSIP to display KMAX-TV's virtual channel as 31 on digital television receivers.\n\nKMAX-TV presently broadcasts 38 hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with six hours on weekdays and four hours each on Saturdays and Sundays); the station does not broadcast any local newscasts on weekend evenings. KMAX is also one of only three CW affiliates that produce a local newscast on weekend mornings, alongside WPIX/New York City and KTLA/Los Angeles. The station's morning newscast \"Good Day\" (which debuted in 1995 as \"The Morning Show\", then later as \"Good Day Sacramento\"), consistently ranks as the Sacramento area's second highest-rated morning news program—among both local or network shows—behind \"Today\" on NBC affiliate KCRA-TV (channel 3). The station has also maintained a nightly newscast since the 1980s, titled \"31 News\" (later \"31 Action News\" and \"UPN 31 Action News\"); the nightly newscast was cancelled in 1998 due to low ratings. A midday edition of \"UPN 31 Action News\" continued to air until 2000, when it was also cancelled, leaving \"Good Day\" as the only news program at the time.\n\nAfter Viacom's acquisition of KOVR, KMAX's news department was merged with KOVR, with reporters appearing on both stations and the \"Good Day Sacramento\" set being relocated into the KOVR studio facility. While it does hinder both stations, KOVR and KMAX each produce a weekday morning news block from 5:00 to 7:00 a.m., though KMAX's morning newscast starts at 4:30 and ends at 10:00 a.m. The station expanded its news programming in 2003 with a non-traditional late evening newscast called \"Good Evening Sacramento\", this program was cancelled the following year.\n\nOn January 11, 2008, KOVR/KMAX management announced on a viewer blog that KOVR would begin producing a prime time newscast on KMAX-TV. However, owing to cutbacks ordered by CBS corporate management, plans for this broadcast were shelved in late summer 2008. On June 1, 2009, KMAX-TV began broadcasting \"Good Day Sacramento\" in high definition; footage shot in-studio is broadcast in high definition, while all news video from on-remote locations was initially broadcast in standard definition. Both KMAX-TV and KOVR currently utilize high-definition cameras for field reports, and most (if not all) vehicles transmit back high-definition video.\n\nOn June 4, 2012, KMAX-TV debuted a half-hour weeknight newscast produced by KOVR at 11 p.m., becoming the station's first traditional evening newscast in over a decade since the 1998 cancellation of its earlier prime time newscast; unlike most CW affiliates, the program broadcasts in the traditional late evening news timeslot of 11 p.m., due to KOVR's hour-long newscast at 10 p.m. On March 14, 2016, KMAX-TV added a half-hour weeknight newscast at 6:30 p.m. (also produced by KOVR) to compete with KCRA's long-established 6:30 p.m. newscast. These newscasts, along with \"Good Day\", are translated into Spanish via the station's SAP audio feed. On July 30, 2018, the 11 p.m. newscast was relocated to KOVR, leaving its 6:30 p.m. newscast as the only evening newscast on KMAX.\n\nAfter sister station KOVR purchased the \"CBS 13 Mobile Weather Lab\" and \"Mobile13\" mobile news vehicles in 2014, the station acquired a \"Rover\" mobile news vehicle in 2015. The \"Good Day Rover\" and \"Mobile13\" use a roof mounted robotic camera, various interior cameras, microphones, and a \"LIVEU\" mobile video broadcast system to transmit live video via mobile broadband connections. \"Good Day\" uses the Rover in the early hours of the morning to cover traffic and spot news.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Once the flock is scattered, the hunter sets up and waits, as the scattered flock will return to that point individually, making them easy targets.\n\nBesides a literal turkey hunt, the term \"turkey shoot\" may also refer to a shooting contest in which frozen turkeys are awarded as prizes. The shoot is most commonly held using shotguns aimed at paper targets about 25–35 yards away. Original turkey shoots, however, date at least to the time of James Fenimore Cooper and were contests in which live turkeys were tied down in a pen and shot from 25–35 yards. If the turkey died, the shooter received it as a prize. That gave rise to the military term (see below). Today, turkey shoots are still popular in the rural United States. The winner is chosen according to which target has a shot closest to its center crossmark. Due to the random nature of the exact pattern of pellets that a shoot gun shoots, that removes almost all skill from the contest and allows every shooter an equal chance.\n\nAnother contest, depicted in the 1941 Gary Cooper film \"Sergeant York\", provided a caged turkey with a protective wall. Above the cage was a slot in which the turkey could raise its head. Single-shot rifles were used, and if the shooter was skilled and fast enough, the turkey was shot in the head, rewarding the shooter it as his prize.\n\nIn military situations, a turkey shoot occurs when a group or team catch the enemy off-guard or outgunned to the point of being unfair, as in the following famous examples:\n\n\n"}

He was on Caesar’s side during the Civil War with Pompey. At the decisive battle of Pharsalus he commanded the center of Caesar’s army. After the battle he became governor of Asia. He tried to oppose the invasion of Pharnaces, the king of Bosphorus, who had taken the occasion of the Roman civil war to invade the province of Pontus; however he suffered a crushing defeat at the battle of Nicopolis in Armenia (December of 48 BC). Direct intervention by Caesar brought a quick end to the conflict, and Pharnaces' army was annihilated at Zela in 47 BC. Despite this failure, he remained a trusted friend of Caesar. \n\nDomitius Calvinus's activities immediately after the death of Caesar are unknown, but in 43 BC he was a strong supporter of Octavianus and participated in the civil war against Brutus and Cassius. During the Philippi campaign in 42 BC, he had to bring reinforcements from Italia to Greece for Mark Antony and Octavianus' army, however his fleet was destroyed by the enemy in the Ionian Sea with the loss of two legions. Despite this defeat he was awarded the honor of a second consulship in 40 BC and was sent by Octavianus as governor to Hispania, where he remained for three years (39 BC-36 BC). Apparently, his military activities in Spain were successful, since he was saluted as \"imperator\" by his troops and on his return he was awarded a triumph. He also rebuilt the \"Regia\" in the Roman Forum. Although we do not have many facts concerning his further political activities, an inscription shows that in 20 BC he was still alive and a member of the important \"Arval Brethren\" priesthood, reserved only for members of the nascent Imperial family and to the emperor's most distinguished supporters.\n\nAlthough Domitius Calvinus' career does not show any particular ability, either in politics (he obtained his first consulship only after scandalous bribery) or in war (he suffered two major defeats), he maintained an important political role. This was most probably because he was one of the very few Roman nobles to support the Caesar/Octavianus party from the very beginning.\n\n"}

{"id": "1842206", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1842206", "title": "Nagold", "text": "Nagold\n\nNagold is a town in southwestern Germany, bordering the Northern Black Forest. It is located in the \"Landkreis\" (district) of Calw (Germany/Baden-Württemberg). Nagold is known for its ruined castle, Hohennagold Castle, and for its road viaduct. It takes its name from the river Nagold, which flows through the town.\n\nNagold has a beautiful city centre where half-timbered houses and modern architecture meet each other. The following small villages belong to the district of Nagold: Emmingen, Gündringen, Hochdorf, Iselshausen, Mindersbach, Pfrondorf, Schietingen and Vollmaringen.\n\n was probably settled as early as the early Stone Age: 2000 to 3000 BCE. With its fertile soil and mild climate in the low mountain ridge, the basin afforded ideal possibilities for settlement. Traces of early human occupation from the Hallstatt culture (700 to 450 BCE) have been found in the \"Bächle\" area.\nThe Celts were in the Nagold basin by the 6th and 5th centuries BCE. They were responsible for naming the river Nagold, meaning \"flowing stretch of water\". A Celtic royal burial mound (locally called Krautbühl) and signs of numerous settlements and graves have been found on \"Schlossberg\".\n\nBy the 1st century, the Romans had established two settlements in the basin. One of these settlements was unearthed in the 7th century during construction of Remigiuskirche. Stone walls from the remains were used in the Remigiuskirche foundation.\n\nThe Alamanni expelled the Romans from the Nagold Basin around 260. They emphasized settlement of the valley, and expanded their territory. Around 700, the Franks conquered the Alamanni. The Remigiuskirche was built during this time, and it is assumed the Franks established a court in the area. Nagold became the administrative center of the region which extended from Bondorf to Kniebis. Small towns and settlements began to spring up around Nagold.\nPfalzgraf Rudolf von Tübingen established Nagold as a city early in the 13th century in order to protect his holdings in the northern Black Forest. Through marriage in the year 1230, Nagold came under the control of the Grafen von Hohenberg, who sped up development of the city. By the end of the 13th century, Nagold was encircled with a wall, complete with moat and gate towers. Around 1350, the Plague devastated the population.\n\nConstruction was begun on Marienkirche church in 1360. The church was razed in 1876-1877, but an original tower built in 1401 still stands on Turmstrasse street.\n\nIn 1363 the Hohenbergs were forced out of Nagold, and the Dukes Eberhard and Ulrich von Württemberg bought the city. Nagold then served as a court city (Amtstadt), and in 1806 was elevated to a high court city (Oberamtstadt), which lasted until being abolished in 1938.\n\nIn the 16th century, farmers' uprisings led to the departure of the local aristocracy. Austria, always looking to expand the Habsburg domain, quickly moved into the Nagold area. Herzog Ulrich reclaimed his lands in 1534, and embraced Protestantism.\n\nDuring the Thirty Years' War (1618–1647), the Burg Hohennagold (castle) was destroyed.\n\nParts of Nagold were destroyed in devastating fires in 1825, 1850, 1887, and 1893. Marktstrasse is one of the few streets in Nagold to have escaped destruction in the fires. A large of portion of the architecture on this street dates to the 18th century, and includes the three-story Rathaus (1756–1758), the Stadtbrunnen (city fountain), the Schmidsche Apotheke with rich ornamentation, and numerous Fachwerk (timbered) houses from the 17th century. Other architectural treasures are scattered through the city. Among these are the Alte Schule (old school, 1706) and the Alte Vogtei with Celtic origins. The hotel \"Alte Post\" (1699) served as a stop on the old mail line between Stuttgart and Freudenstadt. The Oberamtei (from 14th century) is located on Oberamteistrasse, and was the location of the high court (Oberamt) from 1812 until 1938.\nAs early as 1924, Nagold was a NSDAP (Nazi) base of support. According to voting statistics, 19.4% of the population voted NSDAP in May 1924. Comparatively, the NSDAP captured just 6.5% of the vote nationwide, and a mere 4.1% in Baden and Württemberg during the same election.\n\nThe Reunification of Germany in 1989 brought new hopes for the future of Germany and Nagold, but was quickly followed by the worst recession in post-war history. Home construction, attraction of industry, and improvement of infrastructure have been difficult problems for Nagold. A city policy of construction, combined with improvement of the old city center, are cornerstones of the city planning. In 1992, the city's open-air swimming pool was amended with an indoor pool, and in 1996 a new cultural center named \"Kubus\" was built in the city center.\n\nData source: Estimates, Census results, data from statistical offices.\n\n\n\n"}

Here he came into contact with many innovative architects, artists designers, including architect Isaac Ware.\n\nIt is thought that Ware introduced him to the third earl of Burlington and his circle of friends. Paine’s first professional job, aged only nineteen, was as the Clerk of Works supervising the building of Nostell Priory, Yorkshire (\"c\".1737–1750), designed by Colonel James Moyser, a friend of Lord Burlington. Essentially a Palladian, Paine was to work on many other projects in the area including Heath House in the village of Heath in between Nostell Priory and Wakefield.\n\nPaine lived in Pontefract whilst working at Nostell Priory, and whilst working on that project, he was also commissioned to design the Mansion House at Doncaster, Yorkshire between 1745 and 1748.\n\nFrom the 1750s, he had his own practice, and designed many villas, usually consisting of a central building, often with a fine staircase, and two symmetrical wings. The most important house which he was involved with was Kedleston Hall, Derbyshire where he succeeded Matthew Brettingham from 1759 to 1760 and suggested the colonnaded hall, but he was himself displaced by Robert Adam, who altered his designs.\n\nAt around the same time, he designed the very grand stables at Chatsworth House in the same county. He was a favourite architect of the powerful Catholic families of the time. In the 1760s he was commissioned to rebuild Worksop Manor for the Duke of Norfolk as well as the new Thorndon Hall (1764–70) in Essex for Lord Petre and his house on Park Lane, London. From 1770 to 1776, he built New Wardour Castle in Wiltshire (which featured as the Royal Ballet School in the film \"Billy Elliot\").\n\nPaine held various posts, some sinecures, in the Office of Works culminating in appointment as one of the two Architects of the Works in 1780 but lost the post in a reorganisation in 1782. He was appointed High Sheriff of Surrey for 1783.\n\nHis practice declined in his later years as he refused to participate in the Neoclassical fashions established by the Adam brothers. He published much of his own work in his two volumes of \"Plans, elevations and sections of Noblemen and Gentlemen's Houses\" (1767 and 1783).\n\nIn 1789, Paine retired to France, where he died in the autumn.\n\nPaine married twice. His first wife was Sarah Jennings, daughter and coheir of George Jennings of Pontefract. They married in March 1741 and had a son, the architect, sculptor, and topographical watercolourist James Paine (1745–1829).\n\nAfter Sarah's death, Paine married Charlotte Beaumont (1722–1766), youngest daughter of Richard Beaumont of Whitley Beaumont, near Huddersfield. They were married by June 1748 and had two daughters, Charlotte (1751 – 31 October 1814) and Mary, known as 'Polly' (1753-1798). Charlotte married St John Charlton (April 1760 - 3 October 1802) on 22 December 1781 who later became High Sheriff of Shropshire in 1790 and the couple lived at Apley Castle. Mary married artist Tilly Kettle, with a dowry of £5,000.\n\nIn 1773 Paine bought the lease to Sayes Court, a country estate near Chertsey in Surrey. He became a justice of the peace for Middlesex in December 1776 and for Surrey in June 1777, and served as high sheriff of Surrey in 1785.\n\nPaine was a friend of artist Joshua Reynolds and had designed a large gallery and painting room, with an elaborate chimney piece, for Reynold’s home in Leicester Fields, now Leicester Square, London. In 1764, Reynolds painted a joint portrait of James Paine father and son pictured above (now in the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford). The following year Reynold painted a matching portrait of Charlotte and her two daughters, Charlotte and Mary \"Polly\", possibly in exchange for in exchange for some of Paine’s architectural work at his home. This portrait is now in Lady Lever Art Gallery, Liverpool. The portraits were intended to be hung so that the father and son faced mother and daughters. Reynolds’s appointment book records an entry for their sittings:'17 July 1765 Mrs Pain , Miss Pain and Miss Polly Pain.' Then, on 25 July, 'Mrs Paine etc.' on 2 August 'Miss Paine' sat alone, and 'Mrs Paine' sat three days later. On 3 October the entry read: 'Mrs Paine & Co'. There were further appointments on 27 September, 27 November and 2 December, for 'Dog.'The portrait \"Mrs James Paine, and Her Daughters Charlotte Paine, b.1751, Later Mrs St John Charlton and Mary 'Polly' Paine, 1753–1798, Later Mrs Tilly Kettle\") was exhibited twice in Yorkshire in late nineteenth century, and copies were made. It was eventually acquired by the art dealer C.J Wertheimer but when it was shown at Burlington House in 1908, it was catalogued as \"Portraits of the Misses Paine\", their mother Charlotte having been painted out to increase its sale value. William Hesketh Lever paid £4520. 5s for in 1918. In 1935, the Lady Lever Art Gallery Trustees took the decision to remove the over painting and restored Mrs Paine to her rightful place.\n\nIn 2017, the Friends of Doncaster Mansion House led on the James Paine Festival, celebrating his life and work on the 300th anniversary of his birth.\n\nThe following are major works attributed to Paine:\n\n\nNotes\n\nBibliography\n"}

It is 12 miles East of Stirling. Dollar was once a place of residence of Mary, Queen of Scots.\n\nPossible interpretations are that Dollar is derived from \"Doilleir\", an Irish and Scots Gaelic word meaning dark and gloomy, or from various words in Pictish: 'Dol' (field) + 'Ar' (arable) or \"Dol\" (valley) + \"Ar\" (high). Another derivation is from \"Dolar\", ‘haugh place’ (cf Welsh dôl ‘meadow’. This word was borrowed from British or Pictish into Scottish Gaelic as \"dail\" ‘water-meadow, haugh’). John Everett-Heath, in derives it as 'Place of the Water Meadow' from the Celtic \"dôl\" 'water meadow' and \"ar\" 'place'.\n\nA further theory, linked to Castle Campbell's alternative name of Castle Gloom, is that it stems from Scots-French \"Doleur\", meaning sadness.\n\n500-year-old Castle Campbell stands overlooking the town, sitting on a forward projection of rock on the south side of the Ochil Hills. The castle was the lowland seat of the Duke of Argyll, where Mary, Queen of Scots once stayed in the 16th century.\n\nThe original town (of which parts still survive) stands on the sloping ground beneath the castle, in what is now the north-east section of the town. Buildings here are general stone built and two storeys high. The oldest buildings date from the mid-17th century and several 18th century buildings exist. Development spread to the west and south through the 19th century.\n\nThe construction of Dollar Academy in the early 19th century, with its extensive grounds created a refocus westwards.\n\nAround 1840 the construction of a new road to Muckhart on lower ground south of the original route, created the current main east-west street. This quickly became the new \"town centre\" and the focus of shops and public activity.\nThe town has two war memorials, one for each world war. In the grounds of the Academy a bronze figure with outstretched hands by George Henry Paulin faces westwards and commemorates the fallen of the First World War. This also has names added for Northern Ireland. The dead were largely from the Academy; two non-Academy deaths (the Archibald brothers) are indicated by the word \"parish\" against their names. The Second World War has a far more modest memorial, in the small public garden on the main road, where the road suddenly twists. Both memorials are by local sculptor George Henry Paulin.\n\nA small museum run by volunteers contains a collection of local items, and much information about the former Devon Valley Railway, which closed to passengers in 1964. The town is now largely a dormitory community for people who work in Stirling and further afield — e.g. Glasgow and Edinburgh.\n\nIt is one of the Hillfoots Villages, situated between the Ochil Hills range to the north and the River Devon to the south. Dollar is 12 miles East of Stirling on the A91 road to St Andrews. The Devon Valley Railway linking Alloa and Kinross closed to passengers in 1964 and to freight in 1973.\n\nAttempts were made to mine lead and copper in Dollar Glen from the 18th century and possibly earlier, but these were of no economic significance. Coal mining in the area began around the same time and, until 1973, supplied the Kincardine Power Station, and later, the Longannet Power Station with coal from the Upper Hirst seam. A tiny private non-NCB coal mine operated from the Harviestoun estate from the mid-1970s, partly filling the gap that the closed NCB left, whilst there was still local demand for coal.\n\nIn common with the other Hillfoots Villages, the textiles industry played an important part in the town's development. The Harviestoun Brewery was established west of Dollar in 1985, before its move to Alva.\n\nFrom 1891 to 1975 the town had its own council. It is now within Clackmannanshire council area. It forms part of the Clackmannanshire East ward which includes Clackmannan, Comely Bank, Dollar & Muckhart. In the 2017 local elections, residents of the ward elected three councillors - one each from the Scottish National Party, the Labour Party and the Conservative Party.\n\nDollar had a provost from 1891 to 1975. The provosts were:\n\n\n\nDollar Academy is a fee paying school.\n\nDollar is home of the Dollar Glen Football Club, an 18-hole golf course (notable for its steep inclines and lack of bunkers), a tennis club, a squash club, a bowling club, and a cricket club. The Ochil Hills that overlook Dollar provide opportunities for mountain biking.\n\nThere are three churches, one Church of Scotland, one Scottish Episcopal Church and Ochil Hills Community Church which meets in the Civic Centre.\n\nDollar is twinned with the French town of La Ville-aux-Dames, which lies just outside Tours in the Loire Valley.\n\n"}
{"id": "1842246", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1842246", "title": "Shako", "text": "Shako\n\nA shako (, , ) is a tall, cylindrical military cap, usually with a visor, and sometimes tapered at the top. It is usually adorned with some kind of ornamental plate or badge on the front, metallic or otherwise, and often has a feather, plume (see hackle), or pompom attached at the top.\n\nThe word \"shako\" originated from the Hungarian name for the \"peak\", which Hungarian border soldiers (\"Grenz Infanterie\") added around 1790 to their previously visorless stovepipe-style hats. Originally these hats were part of the clothing commonly worn by sheperds, before being added to the uniform of the Hungarian hussar in the early 18th century. Other spellings include \"chako\", \"czako\", \"schako\" and \"tschako\".\n\nFrom 1800 on, the shako became a common military headdress, worn by the majority of regiments in the armies of Europe and the Americas. Replacing in most instances the light bicorne, the shako was initially considered an improvement. Made of heavy felt and leather, it retained its shape and provided some protection for the soldier's skull, while its visor shaded his eyes. The shako retained this pre-eminence until the mid-19th century, when spiked helmets began to appear in the army of Prussia, which influenced armies of the various German states, and the more practical kepi replaced it for all but parade wear in the French Army. The Imperial Russian Army substituted a spiked helmet for the shako in 1844–45 but returned to the latter headdress in 1855, before adopting a form of kepi in 1864. Following the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, military fashions changed and cloth or leather helmets based on the German headdress began to supersede the shako in many armies.\n\nAlthough the mid-19th century shako was impressive in appearance and added to the height of the wearer, it was also heavy and by itself provided little protection against bad weather as most models were made of cloth or felt material over a leather body and peak. Many armies countered this by utilising specially designed oilskin covers to protect the shako and the wearer from heavy rain while on campaign. The shako provided little protection from enemy action as the most it could offer was in giving partial shielding of the skull from enemy cavalry sabres.\n\nDuring the period of general peace that followed the Napoleonic Wars, the shako in European armies became a showy and impractical headdress that was best suited for the parade ground. As an example, the \"Regency\" officers' shako of the British Army of 1822 was in height and across at the crown, with ornamental gold cords and lace. Lieutenant Colonel George Anthony Legh Keck can be seen in a portrait from 1851 wearing a 'broad-topped' shako that was topped by a white plume and held in place by bronze chin scales.\nThe \"Regency\" shako was followed in the British Army by a succession of models —\"Bell-topped\", \"Albert\", \"French\" and \"Quilted\" — until the adoption of the Home Service helmet, in 1877.\n\nThe \"stovepipe\" shako was a tall, cylindrical type with a brass badge attached to the front. The stovepipe was used by the infantry of the British Army from around 1799, and its use was continued until the end of the Peninsular War. From then on it was used only by the light infantry. In the US Army, a lower felt shako superseded the top hat style, bearskin crest surmounted \"Round hat\" in 1810.\n\nThe \"Belgic\" shako was a black felt shako with a raised front introduced in the Portuguese Marines in 1797 and then in the Portuguese Army in 1806, as the . It was later adopted by the British Army, officially replacing the stovepipe shako in 1812, but was not introduced completely until 1815 and became therefore known as the \"Waterloo\" shako. This cumbersome headgear was already discarded in 1816, in favour of the slightly bell topped \"Regency\" shako. The Belgic shako was decorated with silver or gold lace for officers, according to regimental practice. In 1813 the US Army adopted a similar entirely leather made model, nicknamend by the soldiers as\"Tombstone\" cap, because of the extension of the top front that reminded on a grave marker.\n\nThe kiwa (also kiver) was a style of shako introduced into the Imperial Russian Army in 1812; its distinguishing feature was the dished or concave top. This style of shako was worn by the Black Brunswickers alongside shakos of the Austrian pattern.\n\nThe bell-top shako was a large and elaborate type which became popular in the 1820s and 1830s when there was little warfare between the major European powers and practicality on the battlefield became less important than appearance on the parade ground. It featured a crown that clearly flared outwards towards the top, giving a distinctive bell shape, and was often adorned with decorative cords and plumes. British troops were accoutered with the bell-top shako from 1829 to 1844. US troops followed that example by adopting the \"Yeoman\" crown cap in 1813 for Artillery and rifle regiments, followed by the bell crown cap (with concave sides) from 1821.The US shakos changed again from 1832 to 1851, when a leather made \"cap\" for infantry and artillery was introduced, resembling the former \"Yeoman\" crown cap. Dragoons were issued with a cap model, whose crown was smaller than the cap's base. All those models were dropped in between 1851 and 1854, in favour of a cloth made shako of smaller size and swung shape, similar to the british \"Albert\" shako.\n\nThe Albert shako was a British design introduced in 1844, which was intended to be more practical than previous models. It featured a lower crown that tapered inwards at the top, and a second peak at the back intended to protect the wearer's neck from the sun. It is named after Prince Albert who supposedly designed it. It was not popular, and during the Crimean War a round \"undress cap\" was often worn instead. It was eventually replaced by smaller, lighter versions. In the British Army it was the so called French pattern shako (1855-1861), the Quilted shako (1861-1869) and a last shako model (1869-1878), as lower and more ornamented version intended to be worn on parades only. The last two shako models were made of dark blue cloth mounted on a cork basis. The shako was finally superseded for most british regiments by the home service helmet in 1878. In the US Army, the last shako model of 1872 (a cut-down version of the 1851-1854 pattern) was replaced by the spiked helmet in 1882. Cavalry and artillery had adopted the helmet already in 1872. For undress or campaign dress, forage caps and felt hats had replaced the shako style cap since 1825 respectively 1855.\n\nThe Bengal Native Infantry of the British East India Company's army worn a version of the bell-top shako as described above, although lacking a vizor or peak. Frequently portrayed in contemporary illustrations as being worn by mutinous sepoys during the Great Indian Rebellion of 1857, this headdress was actually replaced by the Kilmarnock cap ten years before.\n\nIn 1914, the shako was still being worn in France (by \"chasseurs à cheval\", infantry of the Republican Guard, \"chasseurs d'Afrique\" and hussars); in Imperial Germany (\"Jägers\", \"Landwehr\" and marines); in Austro-Hungary (full dress of non-Muslim line infantry and hussars in both full and field dress); in Russia (full dress of generals, staff officers, and infantry, engineers and artillery of the Imperial Guard). In Belgium the shako was official field dress for line infantry, \"chasseurs à pied\", engineers, transport/ambulance, administration, fortress artillery, and mounted chasseurs, although after the outbreak of war it was usually discarded in favour of the \"undress\" cap. In Denmark it remained part of the full dress of Guard Hussars; in Mexico (full dress of federal troops of all branches); in Portugal (military cadets); in Romania (full dress of artillery); in Italy (horse artillery and military academies); and in Spain (line infantry, \"cazadores\", engineers, and artillery). The Highland Light Infantry and Scottish Rifles of the British Army retained small shakos for full dress and the 1911 \"Encyclopædia Britannica\" states that there were plans to reintroduce the shako as parade dress for all English, Irish and Welsh line infantry regiments - a project that was interrupted by the outbreak of World War I. The Swiss and Dutch armies wore shakos, even for field wear, until after 1916. The Japanese Army had worn the shako as a parade headdress until 1905, although a form of high-sided kepi had been the normal wear.\n\nDuring this final period of elaborate and colourful traditional uniforms, the shako varied widely from army to army in height, colour, trim and profile. Amongst the most distinctive of these were the high Napoleonic shako (\"kiver\") worn by the Russian Imperial Guard and the low streamlined model (\"ros\") of the Spanish Army. The Swiss version had black-leather peaks at both front and rear - a feature that also appeared in the shako-like headdress that was worn by British postmen between 1896 and 1910, and New Zealand policemen of the same period.\n\nMost German police forces adopted a version of the Jäger shako, after World War I, which replaced the spiked leather helmet (Pickelhaube) that had become identified with the previous Imperial regime. This new headdress survived several political changes and was worn by the civilian police forces of the Weimar Republic, Nazi Germany, East Germany, and West Germany. It finally disappeared in the 1970s, when the various police forces of West Germany adopted a standardised green and light fawn uniform that included the high-fronted peaked cap that is still worn.\n\nIn Europe, the infantry of the French Republican Guard, cadets at Saint-Cyr, cadets at the Belgian Royal Military Academy, cadets at the Portuguese Colégio Militar and Pupilos do Exército military schools, the Italian Horse Guards Corps, Horse Artillery and cadets at the Military Academy of Modena, the Danish Guard Hussar Regiment, and the Spanish Royal Guard and 1st King's Immemorial Infantry Regiment all have shakos as part of their respective ceremonial uniforms. Various Latin American armies, including those of Venezuela, Mexico, Brazil, Peru, Ecuador, Uruguay and Argentina, retain shakos for ceremonial guard or military academy uniforms. In Russia, the historic \"kiver\" has been reintroduced for wear by the Kremlin Guards for ceremonial occasions. In India the Madras Sappers & Miners of the Madras Engineer Group wear dark-blue visorless shakos as part of their ceremonial uniform. An Indonesian ceremonial unit as well as the cadet corps of the military academies of the Philippines and South Korea also use shakos.\n\nIn the United States, shakos are still worn as full-dress headgear by cadets of West Point (where it is known colloquially as a tarbucket), Virginia Military Institute, The Citadel, Marion Military Institute, New York Military Academy, and Valley Forge Military Academy and College (in a modified form) with their Full Dress Grey uniforms. Many college and high-school marching bands feature shakos as part of their dress uniform.\n\nIn the Canadian Forces, Les Voltigeurs de Québec are authorized to wear dark green shakos with full-dress uniforms.\n\nIn the US and the Philippines, shakos are frequently worn by civilian marching bands and drum corps. In the latter country, the cadets of some civilian institutions such as the Philippine National Police Academy, and some colleges and high schools, also use the shako, although peaked \"service cap\" styles have become more popular in recent years. Those shako styles still in use in marching bands are generally quite tall and have elaborate plumes. For example, at the University of Notre Dame in South Bend, Indiana, the kilted Irish Guard wear tall black fur shakos with bright yellow plumes, bringing their total height in uniform to almost tall. These shakos are typical of marching band drum majors, however the Irish Guard shako is unique in its size, color, and design.\n\nIn drum corps and corps-style marching bands, the chin strap is rarely worn under the chin; instead, it is worn just under the lower lip, in the style of cadets at West Point.\n\nIn Canada the shako is worn by volunteers in various historical forts wearing 19th-century period uniforms.\n"}
{"id": "1842249", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1842249", "title": "Melissa (song)", "text": "Melissa (song)\n\n\"Melissa\" is a song by American rock band the Allman Brothers Band, released in August 1972 as the second single from the group's fourth album, \"Eat a Peach\". The song was written by vocalist Gregg Allman in 1967, well before the founding of the group. Two demo versions from those years exist, including a version cut by the 31st of February, a band that featured Butch Trucks, the Allman Brothers' later drummer. Allman sold the publishing rights later that year, but they were reacquired by manager Phil Walden in 1972.\n\nThe song's title is frequently referred to incorrectly as \"Sweet Melissa\" due to the lyric being sung at the end of each of the first two choruses.\n\nThe version on \"Eat a Peach\" was recorded in tribute to Duane Allman, who considered the song among his brother's best and a personal favorite. He died in a motorcycle accident six weeks before its most famous rendition was recorded.\n\nGregg Allman penned the song in late 1967. He had previously struggled to create any songs with substance, and \"Melissa\" was among the first that survived after nearly 300 attempts to write a song he deemed good enough. Staying at the Evergreen Motel in Pensacola, Florida, he picked up Duane's guitar which was tuned to open E and immediately felt inspired by the natural tuning. Words came naturally, but he stumbled on the name of the love interest. The song's namesake was almost settled as Delilah before Melissa came to Allman at a grocery store where he was buying milk late one night, as he told the story in his memoir, \"My Cross to Bear\":\n\nIt was my turn to get the coffee and juice for everyone, and I went to this twenty-four-hour grocery store, one of the few in town. There were two people at the cash registers, but only one other customer besides myself. She was an older Spanish lady, wearing the colorful shawls, with her hair all stacked up on her head. And she had what seemed to be her granddaughter with her, who was at the age when kids discover they have legs that will run. She was jumping and dancing; she looked like a little puppet. I went around getting my stuff, and at one point she was the next aisle over, and I heard her little feet run all the way down the aisle. And the woman said, \"No, wait, Melissa. Come back—don’t run away, Melissa!\" I went, \"Sweet Melissa.\" I could've gone over there and kissed that woman. As a matter of fact, we came down and met each other at the end of the aisle, and I looked at her and said, \"Thank you so much.\" She probably went straight home and said, \"I met a crazy man at the fucking grocery.\"\n\nAllman rushed home and incorporated the name into the partially completed song, later introducing it to his brother: \"[I] played it for my brother and he said, 'It's pretty good—for a love song. It ain't rock and roll that makes me move my ass.' He could be tough that way.\" The duo produced a demo recording of \"Melissa\" that later surfaced on \"One More Try\", a compilation of outtakes released thirty years later. In 1968, the duo recorded it during a demo session with the 31st of February, a band that featured Butch Trucks, the Allman Brothers' later drummer. That version is thought to have featured the debut recorded slide guitar performance from Duane Allman, and the entire session was later compiled into \"Duane & Greg Allman\", released in 1972. Gregg Allman sold the publishing rights to \"Melissa\", as well as the Martin Luther King, Jr. tribute \"God Rest His Soul\", to producer Steve Alaimo for $250 shortly thereafter. He had been tied up in Los Angeles, contractually bound by Liberty Records (who had previously issued albums by the Allmans' first band, the Hour Glass), and used the money to buy an airplane ticket to fly back.\n\nWhen Duane Allman was killed in a motorcycle accident in 1971, his brother performed the song at his funeral, as he had grown to like the song over the years. Gregg Allman commented that it \"didn’t sit right\" that he used one of his brother's old guitars for the performance, but he nonetheless got through it; he called it \"my brother’s favorite song that I ever wrote.\" Both because he did not own the rights and found it \"too soft\" for the band's repertoire, he never mentioned the song to the members of the Allman Brothers Band. Following Duane's death, manager Phil Walden arranged to buy back the publishing rights in order to record the song for \"Eat a Peach\", the band's fourth album. Gregg brought it to the studio the day following his birthday and the band recorded it that afternoon at Criteria Studios in Miami, Florida. They felt it lacked a compelling instrumental backing element so guitarist Dickey Betts created the song's lead guitar line. \n\n\"Melissa\" has enjoyed renewed popularity in the 2000s due to its feature in a commercial for Cingular/AT&T Wireless cell phone company and the use of it in a scene in \"Brokeback Mountain\". It was prominently featured in the 2005 film \"House of D\", performed by both the Allman Brothers and Erykah Badu.\n\n"}

Wines is founder and president of SITE, a New York City -based architecture and environmental arts organization chartered in 1970. This multi-disciplinary practice focuses on the design of buildings, public spaces, environmental art works, landscape designs, master plans, interiors and product design. The main focus of his design work is on green issues and the integration of buildings with their surrounding contexts.\n\nWines is currently a professor of architecture at Penn State University. In addition to critical writing, he has lectured in fifty-two countries on green topics since 1969. In 1987, his book De-Architecture was released by Rizzoli International Publications. There have been twenty two monographic books museum catalogues have published his drawings, models and built works for SITE. In total, Wines has designed more than 150 projects for private and municipal clients in eleven countries. He has won twenty-five writing and design awards including the 1995 Chrysler Design Award.\n\nWines explicitly expresses his own \"concern for the Earth.\" Having written at length on new modes of architecture, design, and planning:\n\nJames Wines graduated from Syracuse University in 1956. He became a Fellow of the American Academy in Rome that year and was bestowed a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1962. He began his career as a successful sculptor and graphic designer, exhibiting with the Otto Gerson Gallery (subsequently Marlborough Gallery) in New York.\n\nProfessor Wines’ corporate clients include Swatch, MCA Universal, MTV, Nickelodeon, Williwear, Isuzu, Disney, Costa Coffee, Carrabba's Restaurants, Saporiti Italia, Brinker International, Allsteel, Ranger Italia, Reliance Energy Corporation, and Denny's. Among municipal clients, he has worked for the cities of Hiroshima, Yokohama, Toyama, Seville, Vienna, Vancouver, Le Puy en Velay, Chattanooga, and New York City. His original drawings for these projects have graced the covers of dozens of international design magazines.\n\nAs an educator, Wines originally held adjunct positions at the New School for Social Research (1963–65) and a number of other institutions. In 1974, he taught as an Associate Professor of Fine Art in the New York University Department of Art and Arts Professions. This was followed by visiting professorships at Dartmouth College, the University of Wisconsin, New Jersey School of Architecture, and Cooper Union Design Center. He was chair of the Environmental Design department at Parsons School of Design from 1984 to 1990. After teaching at Domus Academy in Italy and at the University of Oklahoma, he became a professor of architecture at Pennsylvania State University in 1999.\n\nWines daughter Suzan is also an Architect and is co owner with fellow Architect Azin Valy of the award winning firm I-Beam Design. Both Suzan and Azin are graduates of Cooper Union.\n\nProfessor Wines strongly advocates hand drawing as a key to conceptual processes, alongside computer-aided tools “For most architects graphic representation is notional, technical, or illustrative and mainly used as an analytical tool to record design intentions. I consider drawing more as a way of exploring the physical and psychological state of inclusion, suggesting that buildings can be fragmentary and ambiguous, as opposed to conventionally functional and determinate.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1842281", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1842281", "title": "Red River Bridge War", "text": "Red River Bridge War\n\nThe Red River Bridge War was a boundary conflict between the U.S. states of Oklahoma and Texas over an existing toll bridge and a new free bridge crossing the Red River.\n\nThe Red River Bridge Company, a private firm owned by Benjamin Colbert, had been operating a toll bridge between Colbert, Oklahoma, and Denison, Texas, carrying U.S. Route 69 and U.S. Route 75. Texas and Oklahoma had jointly built a new, free span northwest of the existing toll bridge.\n\nOn July 10, 1931, the Red River Bridge Company obtained an injunction against the Texas Highway Commission (now Texas Department of Transportation), keeping it from opening the new bridge. The company said that the highway commission had promised in July 1930 to buy the old toll bridge for $60,000 (equal to $ today). In reaction to the injunction, the Governor of Texas, Ross S. Sterling, ordered that the new free bridge be barricaded from the Texas end.\n\nOn July 16, Oklahoma Governor \"Alfalfa Bill\" Murray ordered the new bridge open, by executive order. Murray issued this order on the grounds that the land on both sides of the river belonged to Oklahoma, per the Louisiana Purchase treaty of 1803. Murray sent highway crews across the new bridge to destroy the barricades.\n\nGovernor Sterling sent Adjutant General William Warren Sterling and three Texas Rangers to the new bridge to defend the Texas Highway Commission workers enforcing the injunction, and rebuilt the barricade that night. The next day, Oklahoma crews under Governor Murray's order demolished the Oklahoma approach to the toll bridge, rendering that bridge impassable.\n\nThe Texas State Legislature called a special session on July 23 to pass a bill allowing the Red River Bridge Company to sue the state over the issue, partially in response to meetings in Sherman and Denison, Texas, demanding the free bridge be opened. The next day, Governor Murray declared martial law at the site, enforced by Oklahoma National Guardsmen, and personally appeared at the site, armed with a revolver, hours before a Muskogee, Oklahoma, court issued an injunction prohibiting him from blocking the northern toll bridge approach. Murray directed the guardsmen to allow anyone to cross either bridge.\n\nMurray discovered on July 27 that the free bridge was in danger of being closed permanently. He expanded the martial-law zone across the river, stationing guardsmen on both free bridge approaches. The injunction against the bridge opening was dissolved and the martial law order rescinded on August 6.\n\nNews of the dispute made national and international headlines. Adolf Hitler may have believed that the events were evidence of in-fighting between the American states, weakening the union.\n\nThe free bridge that was the cause of the dispute was opened on Labor Day, September 7, 1931. It was replaced in 1995, though a portion of the bridge was saved as a historical attraction and relocated to a park in Colbert, Oklahoma.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1842283", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1842283", "title": "WXMI", "text": "WXMI\n\nWXMI, virtual channel 17 (UHF digital channel 19), is a Fox-affiliated television station licensed to Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States and serving the Grand Rapids–Kalamazoo–Battle Creek television market. The station is owned by the E. W. Scripps Company. WXMI's studios are located on Plaza Drive (near M-37) on the northern side of Grand Rapids, and its transmitter is located southwest of Middleville.\n\nThe station signed on the air on March 18, 1982 as an independent station under the call sign WWMA, standing for \"West Michigan's Alternative\" (as it was the first locally-based independent station in the market not associated with a religious organization). The station was founded and originally owned by Heritage Broadcasting Company. Approximately a year after signing on, additional shareholders bought control of the station and changed the callsign to the current WXMI on August 15, 1983. In 1987, WXMI signed an affiliation deal to become the market's Fox affiliate; it joined the network on April 9, 1987 when Fox expanded its programming offerings to include primetime programming. In 1989, the station's stock was purchased by a New York-based company headed by Robert Dudley called Odyssey Television Partners.\nNine years later, WXMI was purchased by Indianapolis-based Emmis Communications, which traded the station with sister KTZZ in Seattle to Tribune Broadcasting in 1998 in exchange for FM station WQCD in New York City.\n\nOn May 8, 2017, Hunt Valley, Maryland-based Sinclair Broadcast Group entered into an agreement to acquire Tribune Media for $3.9 billion, plus the assumption of $2.7 billion in debt held by Tribune. Sinclair was precluded from acquiring WXMI directly, as it already owned CBS affiliate WWMT (channel 3). On April 24, 2018, Sinclair announced that it would sell WXMI and eight other stations – Sinclair-operated KOKH-TV in Oklahoma City, WRLH-TV in Richmond, KDSM-TV in Des Moines, WOLF-TV (along with LMA partners WSWB and WQMY) in Scranton/Wilkes-Barre and WXLV-TV in Greensboro/Winston-Salem/High Point, and Tribune-owned WPMT in York, Pennsylvania – to Standard Media Group (an independent broadcast holding company formed by private equity firm Standard General to assume ownership of and absolve ownership conflicts involving the aforementioned stations) for $441.1 million.\n\nTribune terminated the Sinclair deal on August 9, 2018, and filed a breach of contract lawsuit, three weeks after the FCC's July 18 vote to have the deal reviewed by an administrative law judge amid \"serious concerns\" about Sinclair's forthrightness in its applications to sell certain conflict properties; the sale to Standard Media was also cancelled, as it was predicated on the closure of the Sinclair–Tribune merger.\n\nOn December 3, 2018, Irving, Texas-based Nexstar Media Group announced it would acquire the assets of Tribune Media for $6.4 billion in cash and debt. Nexstar was precluded from acquiring WXMI directly or indirectly, as it already owned NBC affiliate WOOD-TV (channel 8), MyNetworkTV affiliate WXSP-CD (channel 15), and Battle Creek-based ABC affiliate WOTV (channel 41). On March 20, 2019, the Cincinnati-based E. W. Scripps Company announced it would purchase WXMI from Nexstar upon consummation of the merger, as part of the company's sale of nineteen Nexstar- and Tribune-operated stations to Scripps and Tegna Inc. in separate deals worth $1.32 billion; the sale was completed on September 19, 2019.\n\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\nFrom August 2006 to September 2007, The Tube aired on the station's second digital subchannel. In July 2010, the station reactivated its second digital subchannel to carry This TV, which moved to a new third subchannel on December 9 in anticipation of the December 31 launch of Antenna TV. In October 2019, WXMI-DT3 switched to Court TV (a network owned by Scripps sister company Katz Broadcasting), though it was a move planned by Tribune even before WXMI's sale to Scripps.\n\nWXMI shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 17, on June 12, 2009, as part of the federally mandated transition from analog to digital television. The station's digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 19, using PSIP to display WXMI's virtual channel as 17 on digital television receivers.\n\nIn addition to its main signal, the station also operates two translators, mainly to provide clear service of the station to lakeshore cities with varying terrain blocking reception of the main signal, and to address interference in farther portions of the market by former sister station WGN-TV from Chicago, which also broadcasts its digital signal on UHF channel 19. Two additional transmitters in the southern part of the market, officially classed as WXMI digital repeaters, serve the direct Kalamazoo area on channel 30 from the tower of WGVU-TV's Kalamazoo satellite WGVK, along with a second repeater licensed to Battle Creek on channel 17 transmitting from the city's south side; all four translators carry WXMI and its subchannel services, and all map via PSIP to channel 17. This means it is possible for a television in the Grand Rapids market receiving an over-the-air signal to map out up to four different WXMI signals in its channel map.\n\nW42CB channel 42 completed a flash-cut to digital-only broadcasting in November 2010. W52DB on analog channel 52 was replaced by a digital signal on channel 17 in December 2010. In late June 2011, W52DB calls became W17DF-D. In mid-March, 2019, W17DF-D moved from channel 17 to channel 18.\n\nSyndicated programming featured on WXMI includes \"The Mel Robbins Show\", \"The Steve Wilkos Show\", \"Maury\", \"Daily Mail TV\", \"Dateline\" and \"Modern Family\". WXMI is an affiliate of the Detroit Lions Television Network which airs pre-season games as well as the weekly syndicated show \"The Ford Lions Report\" during the regular season. Since it is outside of the team's local blackout area, it also airs all regular season games produced by Fox.\n\nWXMI presently broadcasts 68½ hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with 11½ hours each weekday and 5½ hours each on Saturdays and Sundays).\n\nOn January 11, 1999, WXMI started its news department and launched the market's first primetime newscast at 10:00 p.m. It originally aired for 35 minutes on weeknights and for a half-hour on weekends. The program would expand to a full hour seven nights a week in 2004. On August 28, 2006, the station premiered the \"Fox 17 Morning News\". Originally a two-hour-long broadcast, it expanded to four hours (running from 5:00-9:00 a.m.) on September 15, 2008. On April 17, 2009, WXMI became the first station in West Michigan to begin broadcasting its local newscasts in high definition; at the time, WOOD-TV and ABC affiliates WZZM (channel 13) and WOTV produced their newscasts in merely widescreen enhanced-definition (WWMT became the second station in the market to upgrade to HD newscasts on April 16, 2011, followed by WOOD-TV/WOTV on October 22, 2011 and finally, by WZZM on December 3, 2011). On April 20, 2011 during the weekday morning show, the station officially unveiled a new logo, graphics, music package (\"The Unexpected\" by 615 Music), and set.\n\nOn September 21, 2009, WXMI debuted an hour-long newscast at 6 p.m. that competes against half-hour newscasts on WWMT, WOOD-TV, and WZZM and their national network evening newscasts. On March 7, 2011, the station debuted an hour-long lifestyle program at weeknights 5 p.m. called \"The One Seven\"; the final broadcast of the program aired only five months later on August 19, 2011. It was hosted by Michele DeSelms and Tim Doty and featured lifestyle segments, art, entertainment stories, cooking segments and some local news. The program was replaced by a traditional hour-long local newscast at 5:00 p.m. (which debuted without any promotion) on August 22, 2011. On March 2, 2013, WXMI debuted weekend morning newscasts, running for four hours from 5:00 to 9:00 a.m. on Saturdays and Sundays. The station added a nightly 11 p.m. newscast on June 2, 2014; a promo for the new newscast references the shift from the common Fox affiliate news tagline of \"at 10 (o'clock) it's news, at 11 (o'clock) it's history,\" with the additional wording \"we changed our mind.\" A 4 p.m. newscast debuted on September 8, 2014.\n\n\n\n"}

As of August 2019, there are 435 species included in the official list. Of them, 50 are classed as accidental, 31 are classed as casual, 12 are classed as provisional (see below), seven have been introduced to North America, four are extinct and one might be, and three have been extirpated.\n\nThis list is presented in the taxonomic sequence of the \"Check-list of North and Middle American Birds\", 7th edition through the 60th Supplement, published by the American Ornithological Society (AOS). Common and scientific names are also those of the \"Check-list\".\n\nUnless otherwise noted, all species listed below are considered to occur regularly in Missouri as permanent residents, summer or winter visitors, or migrants. The following codes are used to designate some species:\n\n\nOrder: AnseriformesFamily: Anatidae\n\nThe family Anatidae includes the ducks and most duck-like waterfowl, such as geese and swans. These birds are adapted to an aquatic existence with webbed feet, bills which are flattened to a greater or lesser extent, and feathers that are excellent at shedding water due to special oils.\nOrder: GalliformesFamily: Odontophoridae\n\nThe New World quails are small, plump terrestrial birds only distantly related to the quails of the Old World, but named for their similar appearance and habits.\n\n\nOrder: GalliformesFamily: Phasianidae\n\nPhasianidae consists of the pheasants and their allies including the partridges, grouse, turkeys, and old world quail. These are terrestrial species, variable in size but generally plump, with broad, relatively short wings. Many species are gamebirds or have been domesticated as a food source for humans.\n\n\nOrder: PhoenicopteriformesFamily: Phoenicopteridae\n\nFlamingos are gregarious wading birds, usually feet in height, found in both the Western and Eastern Hemispheres. Flamingos filter-feed on shellfish and algae. Their oddly shaped beaks are specially adapted to separate mud and silt from the food they consume and, uniquely, are used upside-down.\n\n\nOrder: PodicipediformesFamily: Podicipedidae\n\nGrebes are small to medium-large freshwater diving birds. They have lobed toes and are excellent swimmers and divers. However, they have their feet placed far back on the body, making them quite ungainly on land.\n\n\nOrder: ColumbiformesFamily: Columbidae\n\nPigeons and doves are stout-bodied birds with short necks and short slender bills with a fleshy cere.\n\n\nOrder: CuculiformesFamily: Cuculidae\n\nCuculidae includes cuckoos, roadrunners, and anis. These birds are of variable size with slender bodies, long tails, and strong legs.\n\n\nOrder: CaprimulgiformesFamily: Caprimulgidae\n\nNightjars are medium-sized nocturnal birds that usually nest on the ground. They have long wings, short legs, and very short bills. Most have small feet, of little use for walking, and long pointed wings. Their soft plumage is cryptically colored to resemble bark or leaves.\n\n\nOrder: ApodiformesFamily: Apodidae\n\nThe swifts are small birds which spend the majority of their lives flying. These birds have very short legs and never settle voluntarily on the ground, perching instead only on vertical surfaces. Many swifts have very long, swept-back wings which resemble a crescent or boomerang.\n\n\nOrder: ApodiformesFamily: Trochilidae\n\nHummingbirds are small birds capable of hovering in mid-air due to the rapid flapping of their wings. They are the only birds that can fly backwards.\n\n\nOrder: GruiformesFamily: Rallidae\n\nRallidae is a large family of small to medium-sized birds which includes the rails, crakes, coots, and gallinules. The most typical family members occupy dense vegetation in damp environments near lakes, swamps, or rivers. In general they are shy and secretive birds, making them difficult to observe. Most species have strong legs and long toes which are well adapted to soft uneven surfaces. They tend to have short, rounded wings and to be weak fliers.\n\n\nOrder: GruiformesFamily: Gruidae\n\nCranes are large, long-legged, and long-necked birds. Unlike the similar-looking but unrelated herons, cranes fly with necks outstretched, not pulled back.

It is third-oldest rally in the world, preceded only by Österreichische Alpenfahrt and Monte Carlo Rally. In 1973, the Rally of Poland was the one of the thirteen rounds of newly established FIA World Rally Championship, but was removed from the 1974 calendar. It later found a place as a round of the European Rally Championship, and after a move to Mikołajki in the Masurian Lake District in 2005, event organisers started lobbying for the event's inclusion as a round of the World Rally Championship. After being run as a candidate event in 2007 and 2008, Poland returned to the World Rally Championship in 2009, which was won by Mikko Hirvonen. However, the event was once again removed after a single season, and was replaced by Rally Bulgaria.\n\nDuring the 2012 season, the FIA put forward a tender for new events, and after a delay of one year, considered events in Brazil, China, India, Russia, South Africa and Poland for inclusion on the 2014 season calendar. The Rally of Poland was the successful candidate, and returned to the championship in 2014. The proposed route featured stages in nearby Lithuania, in a format similar to the Rally of Sweden, which crosses over the border into Norway. It was removed from the calendar after the 2017 season after the FIA repeatedly raised concerns about the event's safety.\n\n† — Rally was part of the World Rally Championship.\n\n"}
