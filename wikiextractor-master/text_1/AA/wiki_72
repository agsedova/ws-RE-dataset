Introduced in the 1983 film \"Return of the Jedi\", he was brought to life both as a puppet and a costumed actor during the film. Nunb was puppeteered by Mike Quinn and was portrayed by Richard Bonehill in wide shots. The character was voiced by Kipsang Rotich, a Kenyan student who spoke in his native Kalenjin, as well as in the Kikuyu. Quinn and Rotich both returned for the role in the sequel trilogy, namely \"\" (2015), \"\" (2017), and \"\" (2019).\n\nWithin the fictional \"Star Wars\" universe, Nien Nunb is an arms dealer of the Sullustan species who joins the Rebel Alliance in fighting the evil Galactic Empire. Three decades later, Nunb is a starfighter pilot in the Resistance against the First Order, including the Battle of Starkiller Base.\n\nNunb's name originated from the fact that he was referred to as \"Number Nine\" on creature packaging. In an interview, Richard Marquand described Nien Nunb as, \"…a Muppet, a guy under the deck does his thing. He's got some dialogue to do. He's got this funny, twitchy face. He's a terrific character in my mind\".\n\nNien Nunb was brought to life by both a puppeteer and as a costumed-actor during the film. Initially, he was just to appear in the briefing room scenes, and the Endor celebration. For these appearances he was portrayed by stuntman Richard Bonehill, in costume and mask. However, Nunb was later chosen, by series creator George Lucas, to appear in the \"Millennium Falcon\", as Lando Calrissian's co-pilot. Since the character now had dialogue, it was decided that the mask would be reworked into a puppet, with mechanisms to allow for moving lips and eyes. For these scenes, in the cockpit, the role was handed over to puppeteer Mike Quinn.\n\nThe character was voiced by Bill Kipsang Rotich, a Kenyan student and native Kalenjin speaker, who spoke in Kikuyu and Haya for the role. After voicing the character, Rotich became a local celebrity in his home country, as many Kenyan viewers could hear their own languages in a \"Star Wars\" film, and understand the character's dialogue.\n\nQuinn returned to the role for \"The Force Awakens\", without Bonehill, who died in February 2015. Rotich was also tracked down in his native Kenya, by actor Christian Simpson, to voice the character again.\n\nNunb is introduced as a member of the Alliance Fleet, selected to fly as co-pilot to General Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams) aboard the \"Millennium Falcon\" during the Battle of Endor, where they lead the assault to destroy the second Death Star. Before the battle, when the Alliance Fleet gathers near Sullust, Nunb expresses concern about the plan of attack and whether General Han Solo (Harrison Ford), Princess Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher), and their team would be able to successfully destroy the Death Star's shield generator on the moon of Endor before the fleet arrived. Calrissian assures him that Solo would have the shield down on schedule.\n\nWith Nunb and Calrissian in the cockpit of the \"Millennium Falcon\" leading the attack, the Alliance Fleet arrives over Endor to find that the shield generator is still operational, quickly realizing that the battle is a trap set by Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) to engage and destroy the Rebel Alliance once and for all. The fleet remains over Endor and engages Imperial forces in the hopes that Solo and his team would still be able to complete their mission and destroy the generator. The fleet keeps to fighting Imperial TIE fighters and Star Destroyers, particularly once they learn that the Death Star is operational. Once Solo's team destroys the shield generator, the \"Millennium Falcon\" enters the Death Star's superstructure and fires the shot that begins a chain reaction that destroys the battle station. Nunb and Calrissian escape the Death Star just before it is consumed in a massive explosion. Nunb joins his fellow Rebels and the native Ewoks on the surface of Endor in celebrating the destruction of the Death Star and the downfall of the Empire.\n\nMike Quinn confirmed on October 19, 2015 via Facebook that he would return in \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\" as Nien Nunb. Later on December 6, the character's appearance was seen in a TV spot for the film. Kipsang Rotich also reprised his role as the voice for Nien Nunb, having been tracked down by actor Christian Simpson.\n\nIn the film, when the First Order destroys the Hosnian System with the Starkiller Base superweapon, the Resistance base on D'Qar becomes the next target. Quickly establishing a plan to destroy Starkiller Base, Nunb, along with the rest of the Starfighter Corps, flies to the planet in an attempt to destroy its thermal oscillator and disable the weapon. During the battle, many Resistance pilots are killed before the oscillator is destroyed by Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac). Nunb is one of seven surviving X-wing pilots, and he celebrates with the rest of the Resistance upon returning to D'Qar.\n\nMike Quinn reprised his role as Nien Nunb in \"\", the second installment of the sequel trilogy. Kipsang Rotich, on the other hand, did not, because the character doesn't have any lines in this film.\n\nIn the film, Nien Nunb evacuates alongside his fellow soldiers from the Resistance base of D'Qar, and is present aboard the \"Raddus\" during the battle of the Resistance's bombers against the First Order. Nunb later escapes offscreen alongside Leia and other Resistance members to the old Rebellion base on the planet of Crait. On Crait, Nien pilots a ski speeder along with Poe Dameron, rogue stormtrooper Finn (John Boyega), Resistance mechanic Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran) and X-wing pilot C’ai Threnalli. He (along with Poe, Threnalli and Tico) has to bail out as the super laser, which they were trying to destroy, becomes too powerful. Nunb is seen at the end of the film talking with Finn as the remaining members of the Resistance escape from the clutches of the First Order once more.\n\nKipsang Rotich returned as Nien Nunb for the first time since \"The Force Awakens\", and Mike Quinn returned as his puppeteer.\n\nOver one year since the last fight with the First Order, Nien Nunb follows the Resistance to relocate to Ajan Kloss, where they discuss how they are going to defeat Sheev Palpatine and his evil Sith Empire. Minutes before take-off, as the Resistance plan their final offensive, Nunb suggests to the Resistance that there aren't enough of them to defeat Palpatine's Sith Fleet. Poe persuades him and all of the Resistance that that is what Palpatine wants them to think - but it is not true. During the climatic final battle on Exegol, Nien Nunb flies the \"Tantive IV\", Leia’s personal craft. He loses control of the ship when Palpatine uses Force lightning to disable all of the Resistance ships in an attempt to stop them from destroying his fleet, before Rey stopped him and is killed in the process. \n\nIn the comic , which is set shortly after the end of \"\", Nunb helps Leia with a mission to unite the few survivors of the destruction of Alderaan. On his native planet, Sullust, Nunb helps Leia smuggle the Alderaanians away from the Empire. He also provides the arms in his ship to Leia and her people, to use against the Empire. Leia presents him with a necklace that once belonged to her adoptive mother, Queen Breha Organa of Alderaan, as a token of her gratitude.\n\nLater in the mission, Leia turns herself over to Imperial Commander Dreed on the desert world of Skaradosh in exchange for the release of Tula, an Imperial officer from Alderaan; Tula's sister, Tace, is part of Leia's group of refugees and Tula secretly manipulates her sister for information about Leia’s whereabouts. Before she can be taken captive, the Mellcrawler arrives to rescue her, with Nunb having slipped the ship onto the planet without the orbiting Imperial forces noticing. Leia thanks Nunb for his efforts, but he says that the real test would be making it past the Imperial forces alive. Nunb launches a decoy to fool the Imperial vessels, leaving them to follow the sensor decoy as the Mellcrawler avoids their detection. The trick is successful and the Star Destroyer crew believes the Mellcrawler has been destroyed, and Leia with it. At that moment, a fleet of Alderaanians from Espirion arrive to assist Leia. The arrival of the fleet allows the Alderaanians to destroy the Star Destroyer, and the Alderaanian fleet escapes the wrath of the Empire. Nunb later attends a celebration to celebrate the success of the mission to unite them.\n\nNien Nunb appears as a playable Hero character in the Outer Rim expansion pack for the video game \"Star Wars Battlefront\" (2015). Nien Nunb is a \"Unique\" unit in the 2017 ftp Mobile game \"Star Wars Force Arena\" by Netmarble. He is partnered with Lando Calrissian. He uses a ranged weapon to do area of effect damage and can evade melee attackers.\n\n"}

It was composed of two lines, one connecting Richmond (immediately north of Halifax) with Windsor, the other connecting Richmond with Pictou Landing via Truro.\n\nThe railway was incorporated March 31, 1853 and received a charter to build railway lines from Halifax to Pictou by way of Truro, as well as from Halifax to Victoria Beach, Nova Scotia on the Annapolis Basin opposite Digby by way of Windsor. The company also received a charter to build from Truro to the border with New Brunswick. The railway was a key project of the visionary Nova Scotian leader Joseph Howe who felt a government built railway led by Nova Scotia was necessary after the failure of the Intercolonial Railway talks and several fruitless private proposals.\n\nThe railway line to Windsor (known as the Windsor Branch) was opened in June 1858 and the line to Truro (known as the Eastern Line) was opened in December 1858. No further work was undertaken on the line to Victoria Beach beyond Windsor but the Eastern Line to Pictou Landing was completed by June 1867, under the supervision of Sir Sandford Fleming. The construction of the Nova Scotia Railway by the colonial government was partly encouraged by the construction failures and ongoing delays in building the Shubenacadie Canal The success of the railway came at the expense of the canal which opened in 1861, but soon fell into disrepair from lack of use (and because the rail bridges over the canal were too low for the steamers on the canal).\n\nOne noteworthy early feature of operations on the Nova Scotia Railway was the first known case of intermodal operations involving the \"piggyback\" transport of road vehicles on railway cars. Farmers in the Windsor area were able to drive their teams of horses and loaded wagons onto railway cars and be transported into Halifax to sell their loads, returning to Windsor the same day.\n\nOn July 1, 1867, ownership of the NSR was passed from the Government of Nova Scotia to the Government of Canada.\nThe Windsor Branch was leased to the Windsor and Annapolis Railway in 1871. The W&A became part of the Dominion Atlantic Railway or DAR in 1894 and the DAR itself was purchased by the Canadian Pacific Railway or CPR in 1912, although it was operated as a separate entity. When the DAR was sold by CPR in 1994, the Windsor Branch came under the control of the shortline Windsor and Hantsport Railway.\n\nThe Government of Canada dissolved the NSR in 1872 when it became part of the Intercolonial Railway. The ICR in turn was controlled by Canadian Government Railways from 1915-1918 and was merged into the Canadian National Railways or CNR in 1918. The Halifax to Truro line remains part of CN, however the rest of the Eastern Line from Truro to Pictou was sold by CN in 1993 to the Cape Breton and Central Nova Scotia Railway as part of CN's sale of the entire Truro to Sydney line.\n\n\n"}

The metropolitan area of Molsheim had 11,760 inhabitants in 2006, from 7,747 in 1968.\n\nThe old town of Molsheim is well preserved and contains a considerable number of old houses and buildings of typically Alsatian architecture. The most notable buildings are the medieval \"Tour des Forgerons\", the Renaissance \"Metzig\", the baroque (although built in late gothic style) \"Eglise des Jésuites\" – an inordinately large church insofar as it could house the entire population of the town when built – and the classical \"Hôtel de ville\".

Piqué fabrics vary from semi-sheer dimity to heavy weight waffle cloth. Twilled cotton and corded cotton are close relatives.\n\nThe weave is closely associated with white tie, and some accounts even say the fabric was invented specifically for this use. It holds more starch than plain fabric, so produces a stiffer shirt front. Marcella shirts then replaced earlier plain fronts, which remain a valid alternative. Marcella use then spread to other parts of the dress code and it is now the most common fabric used in the tie and waistcoat of white tie. A knit fabric with a similar texture is used in polo shirts.\n\nMarcella weaving was developed by the Lancashire cotton industry in the late 18th century as a mechanised technique of weaving double cloth with an enclosed heavy cording weft. It was originally used to make imitations of the corded Provençal quilts made in Marseille, the manufacture of which became an important industry for Lancashire from the late 18th to the early 20th century. The term \"marcella\" is one of a number of variations on the word \"Marseille\".\n\nPiqué fabrics are a type of dobby construction. Piqués may be constructed in various patterns such as cord, waffle, honeycomb and birdseye piqués. These fabrics require the addition of extra yarns, called stuffer yarns. These stuffer yarns are incorporated into the back of the fabric to give texture and added depth to the fabric design. Some piqués may be made using the Jacquard attachment on the loom. Although made of 100% cotton today, cotton-silk blends and even pure silk versions were made in the past and in a variety of weaves.\n"}
{"id": "1877895", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1877895", "title": "Operator product expansion", "text": "Operator product expansion\n\nIn quantum field theory, the operator product expansion (OPE) is used as an axiom to define the product of fields as a sum over the same fields. As an axiom, it offers a non-perturbative approach to quantum field theory. One example is the vertex operator algebra, which has been used to construct two-dimensional conformal field theories. Whether this result can be extended to QFT in general, thus resolving many of the difficulties of a perturbative approach, remains an open research question.\n\nIn practical calculations, such as those needed for scattering amplitudes in various collider experiments, the operator product expansion is used in QCD sum rules to combine results from both perturbative and non-perturbative (condensate) calculations.\n\nIn 2D Euclidean field theory, the operator product expansion is a Laurent series expansion associated to two operators. A Laurent series is a generalization of the Taylor series in that finitely many powers of the inverse of the expansion variable(s) are added to the Taylor series: pole(s) of finite order(s) are added to the series.\n\nHeuristically, in quantum field theory one is interested in the result of physical observables represented by operators. If one wants to know the result of making two physical observations at two points formula_1 and formula_2, one can time order these operators in increasing time.\n\nIf one maps coordinates in a conformal manner, one is often interested in radial ordering. This is the analogue of time ordering where increasing time has been mapped to some increasing radius on the complex plane. One is also interested in normal ordering of creation operators.\n\nA radial-ordered OPE can be written as a normal-ordered OPE minus the non-normal-ordered terms. The non-normal-ordered terms can often be written as a commutator, and these have useful simplifying identities. The radial ordering supplies the convergence of the expansion.\n\nThe result is a convergent expansion of the product of two operators in terms of some terms that have poles in the complex plane (the Laurent terms) and terms that are finite. This result represents the expansion of two operators at two different points as an expansion around just one point, where the poles represent where the two different points are the same point e.g.\n\nRelated to this is that an operator on the complex plane is in general written as a function of formula_1 and formula_5. These are referred to as the holomorphic and anti-holomorphic parts respectively, as they are continuous and differentiable except at the (finite number of) singularities. One should really call them meromorphic, but holomorphic is common parlance. In general, the operator product expansion may not separate into holomorphic and anti-holomorphic parts, especially if there are formula_6 terms in the expansion. However, derivatives of the OPE can often separate the expansion into holomorphic and anti-holomorphic expansions. This expression is also an OPE and in general is more useful.\n\nIn the generic case, one is given a set of fields (or operators) formula_7 that are assumed to be valued over some algebra. For example, fixing \"x\", the formula_7 may be taken to span some Lie algebra. Setting \"x\" free to live on a manifold, the operator product formula_9 is then simply some element in the ring of functions. In general, such rings do not possess enough structure to make meaningful statements; thus, one considers additional axioms to strengthen the system. \n\nThe operator product algebra is an associative algebra of the form\n\nThe structure constants formula_11 are required to be single-valued functions, rather than sections of some vector bundle. Furthermore, the fields are required to span the ring of functions. In practical calculations, it is usually required that the sums be analytic within some radius of convergence; typically with a radius of convergence of formula_12. Thus, the ring of functions can be taken to be the ring of polynomial functions.\n\nThe above can be viewed as a requirement that is imposed on a ring of functions; imposing this requirement on the fields of a conformal field theory is known as the conformal bootstrap.\n\nAn example of an operator product algebra is the vertex operator algebra. It is currently hoped that operator product algebras can be used to axiomatize all of quantum field theory; they have successfully done so for the conformal field theories, and whether they can be used as a basis for non-perturbative QFT is an open research area.\n\nIn quantum field theory, the operator product expansion (OPE) is a convergent expansion of the product of two fields at different points as a sum (possibly infinite) of local fields.\n\nMore precisely, if formula_13 is a point, and formula_14 and formula_15 are operator-valued fields, then there is an open neighborhood formula_16 of formula_13 such that for all formula_18\n\nwhere the sum is over finitely or countably many terms, C are operator-valued fields, c are analytic functions over formula_20 and the sum is convergent in the operator topology within formula_20.\n\nOPEs are most often used in conformal field theory.\n\nThe notation formula_22 is often used to denote that the difference G(x,y)-F(x,y) remains analytic at the points x=y. This is an equivalence relation.\n\n\n"}

After organizing swinging parties himself for a time, he opened a club \"for swingers\" in 1977, in the basement of the Kenmore Hotel on East 23rd Street between Lexington and Third Avenue, and called it \"Plato's Retreat.\" The same year, he moved it to the basement of the Ansonia Hotel, a 19th-century building on 2109 Broadway between West 73rd and West 74th Streets on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. The hotel used to house Continental Baths, a gay bathhouse where Bette Midler, often accompanied by Barry Manilow on piano, provided musical entertainment early in her career.\n\nPlato's Retreat was a \"members-only\" establishment that required everyone to follow the club's rules. Levenson barred male homosexuals, and accepted only straight couples – and women, escorted or otherwise – in the premises. Once a woman left a room after a sexual encounter, her male companion had to accompany her within two minutes. This rule was intended to ensure that women nearly always outnumbered men. Levenson strictly prohibited sexual activity between males but welcomed lesbians. Drugs, including alcohol, and prostitution services were forbidden, though, by subsequent accounts, prostitutes did frequent the premises and there was \"rampant\" use of drugs (most often quaaludes) by patrons.\n\nAccording to a 1979 advertisement in \"SCREW\" magazine, the club offered, besides a heated swimming pool, a sauna steam, whirlpool baths, disco dancing, free bar and buffet, \"cozy living rooms and lounging areas\", a \"variety of swing areas\", and a backgammon lounge.\n\nDuring its heyday, Plato's Retreat was considered the world's most infamous sex club, popular with celebrities, porn stars, and well-to-do couples. The clientele was described as \"an assortment of kinky types from the suburbs: dry cleaners and their wives, or fat men in toupees with their heavily made-up girlfriends.\" Owner Levenson often partook in sexual activity on the premises, once winning a bet against Al Goldstein and 'Butch' Katz, owner of 42nd Street's Roxy Burlesk theater, that he could ejaculate fifteen times within a twenty-four-hour day.\n\nIn 1980, Plato's relocated to 509 West 34th Street.\n\nIn 1985, New York City Mayor Ed Koch backed the New York City Health Department's decision to shut down the city's gay bathhouses, in response to concerns over the spread of HIV/AIDS. In closing the gay bathhouses while allowing the heterosexual swingers' clubs – most notably Plato's Retreat – to remain open, the city found itself in violation of the newly adopted anti-discrimination law. The Health Department, with Koch's approval, reacted by ordering the heterosexual clubs, including Plato's Retreat, to close as well. The club's Manhattan location was shut down on New Year's Eve 1985, ostensibly for violating public-health ordinances.\n\nIn 1981, Levenson and his by-then two partners along with Plato’s accountant were tried and convicted for tax evasion. When the prosecutor asked Levenson—who was the only owner to take the stand—why Plato’s kept its accounting records off the premises, Levenson replied, “Where would I keep them, in the swimming pool?” He served an 8-year prison sentence at the Allenwood federal prison. After serving his sentence, Levenson worked in various jobs, such as cab driver. He died in 1999 after a quadruple bypass heart surgery.\n\nPlato's Retreat relocated to Fort Lauderdale, Florida, where it reopened under the name \"Plato's Retreat 2.\" Located at 321 West Sunrise, the new location was in operation as an on-premises heterosexual swingers' club, open Monday through Sunday from eight p.m. until the last person left. Saturday night was for couples only. Plato's Retreat in Fort Lauderdale was a bring-your-own-bottle club, since no liquor was sold on the premises; however, it provided complimentary mixers, soft drinks, juices, and ice.\n\nIn 2006, Plato's Retreat 2 closed, and then reopened as a sex club \"for men only,\" keeping the same location and bring-your-own format. The club at the Fort Lauderdale location currently operates under the business name \"321 Slammer.\" In the 2010s, there are reportedly numerous on-premises swingers' clubs operating in South Florida.\n\nIn 1978, Joe Thomas released a disco single, \"Plato's Retreat,\" with lyrics referring to the club. The 2009 documentary \"American Swing\" relates the story of Plato's Retreat with archival footage and interviews.\n\nA scene in Spike Lee's film Summer of Sam takes place at Plato's Retreat.\n\nPro wrestler Jesse Ventura would occasionally wear \"Plato's Retreat\" T-shirts during wrestling interviews in both the AWA and WWE.\n\n"}

He played as an attacking midfielder, often occupying the space just behind the striker. Born in Dimona, he is sometimes nicknamed \"The Diamond from Dimona\" in Israel.\n\nBenayoun played for Hapoel Be'er Sheva and Maccabi Haifa before moving to Racing de Santander in Spain. Three years later he moved to the Premier League with West Ham United, and later Liverpool. In 2010, he signed for Chelsea, where he was used rarely, being loaned to Arsenal and back to West Ham, but nonetheless won the 2012–13 UEFA Europa League. After that, he was released by the club and spent a season in the Football League Championship with Queens Park Rangers before returning to Maccabi Haifa.\n\nA full international for twenty years from 1998 to 2018, Benayoun is Israel's most capped player of all time with 102 caps, and their joint second top scorer with 24 international goals.\n\nBenayoun currently holds the position of sporting director for Beitar Jerusalem, the club that he last played for.\n\nYosef Benayoun was born in Dimona, Israel, to a family of Sephardic Jewish (Moroccan-Jewish) descent. His father Dudu Benayoun was a footballer who played for Hapoel Dimona as well.\n\nJason Burt of \"The Independent\" reports that Benayoun's talent was spotted at the age of nine. At the age of 11 he was labelled a genius, and by 13, his face appeared on the cover of Israeli magazines. Benayoun began to play with Hapoel Be'er Sheva. To attend training, he hitchhiked the 60 km roundtrip with his father.\n\nWhen he was 15, Ajax invited Benayoun and his family to the Netherlands. By his 16th birthday, he was the Ajax youth team's highest scorer and best player, and Ajax duly offered Benayoun a four-year professional contract. However, Benayoun and his family found the adjustment to Amsterdam difficult, and they returned to Israel after eight months.\n\nAt the age of 16, he was promoted to the Hapoel Be'er Sheva senior team for the 1997–98 Liga Leumit, but could not prevent the club from being relegated to Israel's second division. In the last match of the season against Maccabi Haifa, Benayoun got a penalty kick in the 90th minute. Haifa's goalkeeper, Nir Davidovich, saved the shot but Benayoun scored the rebound to give his team the win. However, their relegation rival had won their match, meaning that his team would be relegated nonetheless. Seconds after scoring, while celebrating the winning and what he thought to be a league survival goal, Benayoun found out about the relegation and burst into tears. Benayoun finished as the league's joint fourth-leading goalscorer that season, with 15 goals in 25 appearances.\n\nAfter that season, Benayoun moved to Maccabi Haifa in a deal signed by Ya'akov Shahar (Maccabi Haifa's president) and Eli Zino (the former Be'er Sheva president), and it was agreed that the two clubs would share the profits from selling Benayoun to a European club.\n\nIn 1998, under the guidance of Dusan Uhrin and Daniel Brailovsky, Benayoun and Haifa reached the quarterfinals of the Cup Winners' Cup, and he scored a late equaliser against Paris Saint-Germain and also against SV Ried in a 4–1 victory.\n\nBenayoun also scored 16 goals in 29 matches for Haifa in the 1998–99 Liga Leumit, finishing the season as the equal eighth leading goalscorer for his team.\n\nIn 1999, he confronted his manager Eli Cohen, when Benayoun allegedly refused to be substituted during a match. This incident, plus a bad month for the club, ultimately caused Cohen's resignation. In the first ever Israeli Premier League of 1999 to 2000, (this league replaced the Liga Leumit which then became the second tier of club football), Benayoun scored 19 goals in 38 matches for Maccabi Haifa, and was the league's third highest goalscorer.\n\nIn the 2000–01 season under the guidance of Avram Grant, Benayoun led Haifa to a first championship after seven years and was chosen as the Most Valuable Player of the season, after amassing 13 goals in 37 matches. Another successful season placed him as the league's equal sixth highest goalscorer.\n\nThe next season, Benayoun helped Maccabi Haifa win another championship, despite suffering from an injury in the beginning of the season. When he returned to play, he combined well with Đovani Roso, Raimondas Žutautas, and Yakubu to win the championship. In his last season with Maccabi Haifa, Benayoun scored 7 times in 33 matches.\n\nBenayoun made 130 appearances for Haifa, scoring 55 goals.\n\nIn 2002, Benayoun moved to Racing de Santander in Spain's La Liga, scoring five goals in 31 matches his first season (2002–03 La Liga), seven goals in 35 matches his second (2003–04 La Liga), and nine goals in 35 matches his third (2004–05 La Liga), the latter including a hat-trick against Deportivo La Coruña in a 4–1 away victory.\n\nIn total, he made 101 appearances for Racing, scoring 21 goals.\n\nSantander opted to cash in on Benayoun by selling him to his agents Pini Zahavi and Ronen Katsav for €3.5 million. Benayoun rejected a €5 million move to CSKA Moscow, preferring a move to England or to remain in Spain. This sparked a great deal of interest in the player with Newcastle United, Tottenham Hotspur, Liverpool, Bolton Wanderers, Real Sociedad, and Deportivo La Coruña seen as likely suitors.\n\nNewly promoted FA Premier League team West Ham United completed the signing of Benayoun in July 2005 for a fee of £2.5 million, with Benayoun signing a four-year contract. Manager Alan Pardew hailed the signing citing Benayoun's ability to 'open the door when teams sit deep' while Benayoun revealed his excitement at the opportunity to play for West Ham and in the Premiership.\n\nHe made his Premiership debut for West Ham on the opening day of the 2005–06 season (13 August 2005 against Blackburn Rovers) in West Ham's 3–1 win. He went on to score his first Premiership goal for the club when he netted the closing goal in a 4–0 home victory over Aston Villa on 12 September 2005.\n\nIn May 2006, Benayoun played in the 2006 FA Cup Final for West Ham against Liverpool in Cardiff, West Ham losing on penalties after a 3–3 draw. Benayoun scored five times in 34 league matches in his first season at West Ham and three goals in 29 appearances his second season. His last game for West Ham was a 1–0 victory against Manchester United at Old Trafford on 13 May 2007, a game in which West Ham avoided relegation following a single goal from Carlos Tevez.\n\nBenayoun moved to Liverpool under controversial circumstances. He had verbally agreed a new four-year deal with West Ham in May 2007, only to go back on the agreement in a bid to move to Liverpool. The controversy was heightened on 10 July when the Israeli media reported that Benayoun's agent, Ronen Katsav, had agreed a deal with Liverpool which would mean Benayoun taking a lower pay than the £50,000 a week offered by West Ham in May. On 12 July, Liverpool reported on their official website that the signing of Yossi Benayoun had been completed a £5 million deal with him signing a four-year contract.\n\nBenayoun was introduced as a Liverpool player along with Ryan Babel on 13 July, and was given the number 11 shirt. He made his first competitive start for Liverpool against Toulouse in the UEFA Champions League qualifier 3rd round 1st leg. His first goal for Liverpool came on 25 September 2007 when he scored against Reading in the League Cup with a wonderful solo effort. Yossi scored a second hat trick against a mismatched opponent in his first season against non-league side Havant & Waterlooville in the FA Cup, a team 122 places behind Liverpool on the league pyramid. On 7 November 2007 in UEFA Champions League home game against Besiktas in the Group Stage, Benayoun scored a hat trick in Liverpool's 8–0 win against the Istanbul team. Benayoun ended a successful first season having played 48 games scoring 11 goals in the process, including four league goals against Wigan Athletic, Portsmouth, Aston Villa, and Birmingham City.\n\nHowever, his performance was not enough to prevent transfer rumours in the summer of 2008. This led to the Israeli openly announcing his intention to stay, saying: \"Liverpool is good for me and it was always clear I want to stay and Liverpool wants me,\" Yossi was given his preferred number 15 shirt (which was occupied by Peter Crouch during the 2007–08 season but was vacated when he moved to Portsmouth) for the 2008–09 season. Benayoun had worn the number 11 during his first season at the club, but switched to his favourite number 15, the number he wore for Hapoel Be'er Sheva, Maccabi Haifa, Racing de Santander, West Ham United and Israel.\n\nOn 6 December 2008, Benayoun scored his first goal of the 2008–09 season in Liverpool's 3–1 victory over Blackburn.\n\nOn 25 February 2009, Benayoun scored a header from Fábio Aurélio's free-kick in the 82nd minute against Real Madrid at the Santiago Bernabéu in the UEFA Champions League Round of 16 to give Liverpool a 1–0 win. This is probably the most important goal he has scored in his career to date. \"To score in the Champions League was special. It was one of the favourite goals of my career ... I am really pleased to score at the Bernabeu but the most important thing was to get the victory\", Benayoun said after the match.\n\nAgain on 4 April 2009, Benayoun came on as a substitute in Liverpool's match against Fulham to score a dramatic winner in the 94th minute. On 21 April 2009, in a home match against Arsenal, he scored a diving header and volleyed a late equaliser in injury time to level the scores at 4–4.\n\nBenayoun finished his second season at Anfield in spectacular fashion; scoring a goal in each of Liverpool's last three home matches. In the 2008–09 season, Benayoun played in 39 matches, scoring 9 goals, including eight league goals against Wigan, Blackburn, Newcastle, Sunderland, Fulham, Tottenham Hotspur and a brace against Arsenal. He established a regular starting position in the Liverpool team in the second half of the season.\n\nOn 6 July 2009, he signed a two-year contract extension tying him to the club until 2013.\n\nOn 12 September 2009, he scored his first Premier League hat-trick for Liverpool in a 4–0 win against Burnley. He was the first player to score Premiership, Champions League and FA Cup hat tricks, but has since been joined by Sergio Aguero and Harry Kane. He scored the first goal in Liverpool's 3–0 win over West Ham.\n\nBenayoun's last goal for the club came in the 2009–10 UEFA Europa League semi-final against Atlético Madrid. Benayoun scored in extra time to give Liverpool a 2–1 aggregate lead before Diego Forlán scored to put the Spanish side through.\n\nBenayoun signed for Chelsea on 2 July 2010, agreeing on a three-year deal, and keeping him with the Stamford Bridge club until summer 2013. Both clubs agreed on a fee of reported £5.5 million for the transfer of the Israeli winger's services. He said, in a statement to the club's official website, \"I am very excited to come to a club like Chelsea, it is a big club and I think it is a dream for every player. Hopefully we will be successful.\"\n\nBenayoun made his debut against Eintracht Frankfurt in a pre-season friendly before making his first competitive appearance on 8 August in a 3–1 loss against Manchester United in the 2010 FA Community Shield, by coming on for left-winger Florent Malouda in the 72nd minute. On 21 August, Benayoun scored his first league goal in the 93rd minute for Chelsea in a 6–0 thrashing of Wigan Athletic at the DW Stadium in Wigan, Greater Manchester.\nOn 22 September, Benayoun ruptured his achilles during Chelsea's 4–3 League Cup loss against Newcastle United. Benayoun fully recovered from this injury and was played in the second half against Wigan Athletic on 9 April 2011.\n\nOn 26 August 2011, Benayoun offered Juan Mata his number 10 shirt. Benayoun said: \"I decided to give Mata the number 10 – his favourite. For me it's just a number, not my lucky 15.\" (Florent Malouda wore number 15 at the time.) Mata wore the shirt for Valencia and while skippering Spain's Under 21s in the summer and expressed his gratitude to Benayoun. \"It is a very important number to me so I'm pleased to be wearing it. I want to thank Yossi,\" he said.\n\nDuring the 2011 Tour of Asia, in the friendly game against the Malaysia XI team, Benayoun suffered repeated booing from the Malaysian crowd each time he touched the ball. It was reported that \"The occasion was soured by the repeated jeering of Israel midfielder Benayoun by the 85,000-strong crowd ...\" another source reported that \"Muslim-majority Malaysia is a staunch supporter of the Palestinians and has no diplomatic ties with Israel. The midfielder was jeered throughout his appearance for the first half of the friendly.\"\n\nOn 31 August 2011, it was confirmed Benayoun had joined Arsenal on a one-year loan deal as he found chances at Chelsea limited. Benayoun made his debut on 10 September 2011 coming on as a second-half substitute for Andrei Arshavin against Swansea City. On 20 September 2011, Benayoun scored his first goal for Arsenal in the 78th minute of a League Cup match against Shrewsbury Town.\nBenayoun scored his first Champions League goal for Arsenal in a 3–1 defeat to Olympiacos. He scored his first Premier League goal for Arsenal against Aston Villa, scoring an 87th-minute header in a 2–1 victory on 21 December 2011.\n\nBenayoun captained Arsenal in their 1–0 League Cup defeat to Manchester City. He stated \"The truth is I did not expect this, but it was a nice moment. When the line-up was revealed at the hotel, I saw the letter 'C' next to my name; I thought there was some mix up. But overall it was a nice experience\"\nBenayoun started the match against Tottenham Hotspur on 26 February 2012. He came off in the 88th minute for Gervinho, receiving a standing ovation from the Arsenal faithful with the Gunners winning the match 5–2, after being 2–0 down. He then started against his old club Liverpool, on 3 March 2012, before being substituted in the 74th minute again for Gervinho, Arsenal went on to win the game 2–1. He then started the match against Manchester City on 8 April 2012, and nearly had a chance to score in the second half, but only to see his stabbing shot take a deflection, which then came off the post. He was substituted in the second half for Aaron Ramsey, and just like in the match against Tottenham, the Arsenal fans gave him a standing ovation when leaving the pitch. Arsenal went on to win the game 1–0, thanks to a late Mikel Arteta goal. On 11 April 2012 he scored his second league goal of the season in the 3–0 away win against Wolves, a result which strengthened Arsenal's place in third as they opened up a gap of five points over arch-rival Tottenham Hotspur and Newcastle United with five games remaining. He then opened the scoring against Norwich in Arsenal's final home game of the season which ended 3–3 and then scoring in the last game of the season for Arsenal against West Bromwich Albion at the Hawthorns, the match ended 3–2 to Arsenal, meaning Arsenal would finish third, beating their North London rivals Tottenham Hotspur, who finished fourth. In all, Benayoun played 19 league games for Arsenal, scoring four goals.\n\nOn 31 August 2012, Benayoun returned to West Ham United on loan for the 2012–13 season, becoming their eleventh signing of the transfer window. He sustained an injury playing against Newcastle United in November and pulled a ligament after returning to training. He played no further games for West Ham and returned to Chelsea in December 2012. He had played only six games on loan with West Ham.\n\nBenayoun joined Queens Park Rangers until the end of the 2013–14 season on 10 December 2013. He made his debut against Leicester City in a 0–1 loss in a league match coming as a 69th-minute substitute for Tom Carroll. He scored his first goal for the club on 22 March 2014 in an away trip to Middlesbrough to equalise in a game which QPR went on to win 1–3. He scored his second goal for the club three days later in a 1–0 home win over Wigan Athletic, though he was also sent off towards the very end of the game for a second bookable offence.\n\nOn 6 June 2014, it was officially announced that Benayoun would return to Maccabi Haifa on a two-year deal worth $1 million.\n\nBenayoun played one season in Maccabi Tel Aviv FC, scoring only one league goal and failing to win any title.\n\nIn the beginning of 2017–2018 Benayoun signed for Beitar Jerusalem. He started well, scoring 3 league goals with Beitar ranking among the league's leaders, but during January he lost his place in the first squad and had played very little. As a result, he left Beitar and signed for Maccabi Petah Tikva. After a short spell with Maccabi Petah Tikva, he returned to Beitar Jerusalem in 2019.\n\nIn April 2019, Benayoun announced his retirement from football.\n\nBenayoun was a member of the Israel U16 team that came third in the 1996 UEFA European Under-16 Championship.\n\nHe made his senior debut for Israel against Portugal in a friendly on 18 November 1998 that resulted in a 2–0 away loss. Benayoun scored his first international hat-trick in a UEFA Euro 2000 qualifier against San Marino at Ramat Gan Stadium on 8 September 1999. The match finished as an 8–0 win for Israel.\n\nDuring the 2006 FIFA World Cup qualifiers, Benayoun became the leading player of the Israeli national team after equalizing against Cyprus at home (in a game that ended 2–1 to Israel) and scoring twice against Switzerland. In the away game in Cyprus, Benayoun assisted the winning goal after Nir Davidovich saved a crucial goal. His strong performances gave Israel a chance at qualifying for the World Cup, but they missed out on goal difference.\n\nJust prior to the UEFA Euro 2008 qualifiers, Benayoun was given the captaincy of the Israeli national team. In eight appearances in the qualifiers, Benayoun has scored two goals. On 2 September 2010, Benayoun scored his second international hat-trick against Malta in a 3–1 win. Benayoun is Israel's most capped player of all time with 102 caps, and their joint second top scorer with 24 international goals.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Professor of architecture at University of Applied Arts Vienna and a studio professor at the UCLA School of the Arts and Architecture. He is CEO and co-Founder of the Boston based robotics company Piaggio Fast Forward. He was the winner of the Golden Lion at the 2008 Venice Biennale of Architecture. In 2010 Lynn was named a Fellow by United States Artists.\n\nLynn was born in North Olmsted, Ohio, and claims always to have wanted to be an architect. \"When I was twelve, I could already construct perspective drawings and draw axonometric projections,\" says Lynn. \"In high school, someone taught drafting and in the first day of class they saw that I could do all these constructed drawings. I started picking oddly-shaped objects like threaded combs and I would try to draw them in two-point perspective. I got into drawing as a kind of sport.\" Lynn graduated cum laude from Miami University (OH) with degrees in Architecture and Philosophy, and Princeton University School of Architecture with a Master of Architecture. He is distinguished for his use of computer-aided design to produce irregular, biomorphic architectural forms, as he proposes that with the use of computers, calculus can be implemented into the generation of architectural expression. Lynn has written extensively on these ideas, first in 1993 as the Editor of an AD Special Issue called “Folding in Architecture”. In 1999, his book “Animate FORM”, funded in part by the Graham Foundation focused on the use of animation and motion graphic software for design. In “Folds, Bodies & Blobs: Collected Essays” is the republished essay from ANY Magazine “Blobs, or Why Tectonics is Square and Topology is Groovy” for which he is credited with coining the term ‘blob architecture’ later to become ‘blobitecture’ popularized in a weekly Sunday New York Times article “ON LANGUAGE: Defenestration” by the late William Safire. The recent book “Greg Lynn FORM”, edited by Mark Rappolt, includes contributions by his colleagues, collaborators and critics including Ross Lovegrove, Jeffrey Kipnis, Chris Bangle, Sylvia Lavin, Imaginary Forces, Peter Schröder, Bruce Sterling and J. G. Ballard. Along with Hani Rashid, Jesse Reiser and Stan Allen, he was one of the earliest teachers to explore the use of the digital technology for building design and construction when he was teaching the ‘Paperless Studios’ started while Bernard Tschumi was Dean at Columbia Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation (GSAPP) from 1992–1999. He was the Professor of Spatial Conception and Exploration at the ETH Zurich Faculty of Architecture (ETHZ) from 1999–2002 and was the Davenport Visiting Professor at the Yale School of Architecture from 1999-2016.\n\nLynn's New York Presbyterian Church in Queens, New York, with Douglas Garofalo, Michael McInturf is an early project which used vector-based animation software in its design conception. He was profiled by Time Magazine in their projection of 21st century innovators in the field of architecture and design.\n\nLynn's latest works begin to explore how to integrate structure and form together as he discovered some biomorphic forms are inherently resistant to load. He often experiments with methods of manufacturing from aerospace, boat building and automobile industries in his installations such as Swarovski Crystal Sails and HSBC Designers Lounge for 2009 Design Miami, “Bubbles in the Wine” installation at the Grimaldi Forum in Monaco, 1999 Predator Installation at Wexner Center for the Arts with Fabian Marcaccio, 2002 „Expanding the Gap“ installation at Eigelstein 115 (Martin Rendel & René Spitz) with Ross Lovegrove and Tokujin Yoshioka, and in his industrial design projects like the super formed titanium Alessi Tea and Coffee Towers of 2003 and the Vitra Ravioli Chair. Working with Panelite his studio invented a hollow plastic brick called the Blobwall and using an upcycling approach to design and materials is repurposing children’s toys as the building bricks for Toy Furniture and a Fountain at the Hammer Museum by scanning rotomolded plastic toys, composing them on a computer, cutting them with a 5 axis CNC router and assembling them into welded monolithic objects. The Bloom House includes curvaceous interior elements and windows built in plastics, fiberglass and wood all using this software and CNC controlled machines for its fabrication.\n\n\n"}

The group disbanded in 1970, although Edmunds went on to enjoy solo success in the 1970s. Love Sculpture mostly performed blues standards, slightly revved-up, but still close to the originals. Their debut album, \"Blues Helping\", included such songs as \"Summertime\" and \"Wang Dang Doodle\".\n\nThey are best known for their 1968 novelty hit in the UK Singles Chart, a high speed cover version of the classical piece \"Sabre Dance\" by Aram Khachaturian, released on the Parlophone label (R 5744), which reached No. 5 in the UK Singles Chart in December 1968. The recording was inspired by Keith Emerson's classical rearrangements. \"Sabre Dance\" became a hit after receiving air play by British DJ John Peel, who was so impressed that he played it twice in one programme. In December 1968, the UK music magazine, \"NME\", reported that Love Sculpture had signed a US recording contract with London Records, guaranteeing £250,000. The band were also given an invitation to perform \"Sabre Dance\" live, on the German \"Beat-Club\" television programme of Radio Bremen, being broadcast in monochrome at that time.\n\nThis was followed by a second album \"Forms and Feelings\", with songs including: \"In The Land of the Few\", \"Farandole\", \"People People\", \"Seagull (West Coast Oil Tragedy)\", written by Paul Korda, and the equally fast cover of Chuck Berry's \"You Can't Catch Me\". The US version of the album also featured a recording of \"Mars\" from Gustav Holst's \"The Planets\", but Holst's estate refused to license the tune for the UK version.\n\nThey recorded three times for BBC Radio 1's John Peel sessions in 1968 (twice) and 1969.\n\nIn 1970 Mickey Gee joined the band as a second guitarist, and Terry Williams replaced Rob Jones on drums.\n\nLove Sculpture split up after a US tour, having recorded two albums. Edmunds shortly went on to further number one hit success with \"I Hear You Knocking\", and collaborated heavily with ex-Brinsley Schwarz bassist Nick Lowe, eventually forming the band Rockpile with him.\n\n\n(released in the US in mid-1969 on Motown's new Rare Earth label (RS-505), with a different cover design)\n\n\n\nBoth albums were reissued in May 2008, remastered and with bonus tracks (including the tracks from the two Singles listed below).\n\n\n\n"}

After the single was remixed, the band asked Mad Professor to listen to more of the album to explore the possibility of further remixes. The project then became a track by track remix of almost the entire album. Mad Professor heavily edited the original material to form a slow, pulsating mix in which the beat is emphasised, reverb is extensively used and the occasional vocals (many of the tracks are almost entirely instrumental) fade in-and-out in typical dub fashion.\n\nAccording to music journalist Robert Christgau, \"No Protection\" was the most hyped album during dub music's revival in the mid-1990s. In his review for \"The Village Voice\", he found the music well defined and textured: \"It also sustains a convincing gravity—a sense that all these whooshings and clangings and suckings and scrapings and boomings and snatches of tune relate to each other and the rest of the physical universe.\"\n\n\n"}

He started research for a PhD in 1969 with a year of fieldwork in Kenya, and his thesis was accepted six years later. He lectured in social anthropology for some years at Aarhus University, Denmark. Returning to the United Kingdom, he joined the scientific staff of the Social Science Research Council, where he was latterly Principal Scientific Officer.\n\nIn 1979 and 1980 he was head of the Historic Buildings Branch of the Scottish Development Department, and from 1980 to 1987, was Director of the National Heritage Memorial Fund, based in London.\n\nAfter this, he spent four years as Director of Public Affairs for the National Trust, before his appointment as Chief Executive and Deputy Chairman of the British Library from 1991 until 2000. During this period, the British Library made the delayed and over-budget move into its new building at St Pancras.\n\nLang is a trustee of the Heritage Lottery Fund, a member of the Cultural Commission and was appointed in August 2008 as the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Royal Scottish National Orchestra.\n\nHe was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2016 Birthday Honours for services to the arts, heritage, and education.\n\nLang succeeded Struther Arnott as Principal and Vice-Chancellor of the University of St Andrews in January 2001. During his first year at St Andrews, Lang was accused of sexual harassment by a member of the University's administrative staff.

He gained a reputation for identifying and solving problems and was head hunted by Ferrari in 1957. Bizzarrini's responsibility increased until he became sports car development chief at Ferrari in the late 1950s, working on such notable projects as the Ferrari 250 GTO. He split from the company as part of the 'Great Walkout' in 1961, worked first with ATS, and then in 1962 started his own company, Società Autostar, whose name was changed to Bizzarrini in 1964. In addition to producing the exotic Bizzarrini 5300 GT, Bizzarini also worked for other makers including Iso, Lamborghini, and Alfa Romeo.

His grandfather, also named Giotto Bizzarrini, was a biologist who had worked with Guglielmo Marconi on his inventions, especially the radio, following which one of the Livorno Library sections was named The Bizzarrini Library.\n\nBizzarrini received an engineering degree from the University of Pisa in 1953. His design thesis in his senior year was a complete redesign of a used Fiat Topolino, in which he modified the engine for increased power and relocated it in the chassis for improved handling.\n\nAfter graduation, he taught briefly before joining Alfa Romeo's 'Servizio Esperimenze Principali' unit under Ing. Nicolis in August 1954. He was assigned to the development of the Alfa Romeo Giulietta chassis, which was disappointing, as he aspired to become a powerplant engineer. He was later able to move to the Experimental Department, receiving on-the-job training to become a test driver. In his words: \"I became a test driver who coincidentally was also an engineer, with mathematical principles. I always needed to know why something fails, so I can invent a solution.\"\n\nBizzarrini left Alfa Romeo in 1957 and went to Ferrari when that company needed a test driver. He was quickly promoted to controller of experimental, Sports and GT car development.\n\nHe worked for five years at Ferrari as chief engineer. He also worked as a developer, designer, and skilled test driver. The 250 GT 2+2/GTE, the 3 litre \"Testa Rossa\" V12 engine, the 250 TR \"Testa Rossa\", and the 250GT SWB (Short Wheelsbase Berlinetta or \"Berlinetta Passo Corto\") were influenced by his ideas and technical solutions. For one of the most successful Ferrari racing series, the 250, Bizzarrini worked hard to develop the chassis, engines, and advanced dynamic solutions.\n\nHis masterpiece at Ferrari was the 1962 250 GTO. He became involved with the project in 1960. Ferrari wanted a GT racer with better aerodynamics than the previous 250 GT SWB. The SWB was a great racer but had considerable aerodynamic drag. Jaguar had just launched the E-Type and Ferrari needed a top contender in the tracks. Enzo Ferrari wanted to ensure that his racing team did not suffer another loss as it had in the 1959 LeMans race.\n\nTests started secretly with a 250 GT, bodied by Mario Boano, with chassis number \"#2643GT\" which was Bizzarrini's personal car. This car was developed and was used as a test mule for technical solutions later seen in the GTO. This car was known as the \"Bizzarrini Ugly Duck\". (He said, \"We dubbed the car \"Il Mostro\".\" 'The Monster') Experiments with the SWB chassis indicated considerable speed loss due to aerodynamic drag, so Bizzarrini reduced the frontal area and increased the bonnet length, to reduce both drag and tendency to front lift at high speeds. Bizzarrini moved the engine well back into the chassis and lowered it (by using a dry sump lubrication system) to improve weight distribution and handling. The result was the 250 GTO.\n\nIn 1961, Bizzarrini was one of the \"famous five\" engineers who left Ferrari in the so-called \"Ferrari night of the Long Knives\", provoked by a reorganisation of the engineering staff. With other ex-Ferrari engineers (including Carlo Chiti) Bizzarrini founded the Automobili Turismo e Sport (ATS) company to build a Formula 1 single seater and a GT sports car, the ATS Serenissima.\n\nIn 1962, Bizzarrini was hired by Count Giovanni Volpi, owner of the Scuderia Serenissima Republica di Venezia, to upgrade a Ferrari 250 GT SWB (chassis number 2819GT) to GTO specification. Ferrari was upset with Volpi and refused to sell him a GTO, so they had to acquire and modify a used vehicle.\n\nBizzarrini applied all the ideas from the GTO and developed with Piero Drogo of Carrozzeria Sports Cars in the Modena works an aerodynamically advanced body, even lower than the GTO, with the roof line dramatically extended to the rear end, then abruptly truncated following the Kamm aerodynamic theory. The car was completed in just 14 days. The mechanicals were extensively reformed and the engine set well back into the chassis and lowered, using dry-sump lubrication. This car, chassis number \"#2819GT\" was called the Ferrari Breadvan, and is currently raced in vintage Sport Car events. The car was raced at the time with some success, with Carlo Abate and other drivers at the wheel, but could not beat the GTOs because it still had the four-speed gearbox. At least another two 250GT series cars were developed by Bizzarrini, Piero Drogo and Neri and Bonacini to GTO specifications and received distinctive bodies with similar advanced shapes.\n\nIn 1962 Bizzarrini founded Società Autostar, an engineering firm through which he would bid for freelance engineering projects.\n\nFerruccio Lamborghini commissioned Società Autostar to design an engine for his automaking firm, Lamborghini's, new GT cars. The Lamborghini V12 was first manufactured for use in the 350GT in 1964. Variations of the basic design were used in every V-12 Lamborghini until 2010. Originally displacing in the 350GT, it had been increased in displacement to in the Murciélago SV.\n\nSocietà Autostar developed cars for Iso Autoveicoli S.p.A. including the Iso Rivolta IR 300 and the Iso Grifo.\n\nA dispute between Bizzarrini and Iso ended their collaboration, and led to Società Autostar building variants of the Iso Grifo under the Bizzarrini marque. This led Bizzarrini to change the name of Società Autostar first, in 1964, to Società Prototipi Bizzarrini and then in 1966 to Bizzarrini SpA.\n\nBizzarrini SpA is best known for the Bizzarrini 5300 GT Strada, produced between 1965-1968. This car had styling from Giorgetto Giugiaro when he was working for Bertone.\n\nGiugiaro's Italdesign was founded on February 13, 1968 with a forty day target to build their first design based on the Bizzarrini Grifo racing car with a deadline date for the Turin Motor Show in April. Giugiaro's Manta prototype caused a sensation and successfully launched the company. \n\nBizzarrini SpA was declared bankrupt in 1969, which ended Bizzarrini's days as an automobile manufacturer.\n\nAfter Bizzarrini SpA, Giotto Bizzarrini also developed advanced designs for other companies, including American Motors for which he built prototypes for the AMX/3 project, and as style and technical consultant for GM in Europe and USA, top Japanese motorcycle marques and well-known designer marques such as Pininfarina.\n\nGiotto Bizzarrini teaches and works with Rome University, developing advanced projects and designing, building and developing his own sport cars. He is often quoted as saying: \"I'm not a car designer, I am a worker\".\n\nOn October 23, 2012, during the inauguration of the University of Florence's new Design Campus in Calenzano, Professor Giotto Bizzarrini was given the Honoris Causa Degree in Industrial Design.\n"}

The organization was also charged with recruiting and training rabbis for military service, as well as providing support materials to these newly commissioned chaplains. The JWB also maintained oversight of Jewish chapel facilities at military installations.\n\nIn 1921, several organizations merged with the JWB to become a national association of Jewish community centers around the country in order to integrate social activities, education, and active recreation. These merged organizations included the YWHA, YMHA, and the National Council of Young Men's Hebrew and Kindred Association. \nIn 1941, in a response to a mandate from President Franklin D.

{"id": "1878002", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1878002", "title": "Djemal Pasha", "text": "Djemal Pasha\n\nAhmed Djemal Pasha (; 6 May 1872 – 21 July 1922), commonly known as Jamal Basha as-Saffah or Jamal Pasha the Bloodthirsty in the Arab world, was an Ottoman military leader and one-third of the military triumvirate known as the Three Pashas (also called the \"Three Dictators\") that ruled the Ottoman Empire during World War I and carried out the Armenian Genocide. Djemal was the Minister of the Navy.\n\nAhmed Djemal was born in Mytilene, Lesbos, to Mehmet Nesip Bey, a military pharmacist.\n\nDestined for the army, Djemal graduated from Kuleli Military High School in 1890. He went on to the Military Academy (\"Mektebi Harbiyeyi Şahane\"), the staff college in Istanbul, in 1893. He was posted to serve with the 1st Department of the Imperial General Staff (\"Seraskerlik Erkânı Harbiye\"), and then he worked at the Kirkkilise Fortification Construction Department bound to Second Army. Djemal was assigned to the II Corps in 1896; being appointed two years later, the staff commander of Novice Division, stationed on the Salonica frontier.\n\nMeanwhile, he began to sympathize with the reforms of Committee of Union and Progress (CUP) on military issues. It was in 1905 that Djemal was promoted to major and designated Inspector of Roumelia Railways. The following year he signalled his democratic credentials and joined the Ottoman Liberty Society. He became influential in the department of military issues of the Committee of Union and Progress. He became a member of the Board of the III Corps in 1907. Here, he worked with future Turkish statesmen Major Fethi (Okyar) and Mustafa Kemal (Atatürk), although Atatürk soon developed a rivalry with Djemal Pasha and his colleagues over their policies after they seized power in 1913. Between 1908 and 1918, Djemal was one of the most important leaders of the Ottoman government.\n\nHis grandson Hasan Cemal is a well-known columnist, journalist and writer in Turkey.\n\nIn 1911, Djemal was appointed Governor of Baghdad. He resigned to rejoin the army in the Balkan Wars on the Salonica front line, attempting to bolster Turkey's European possessions from encroachment. In October 1912, he was promoted to colonel. At the end of the First Balkan War, he played an important role in the propaganda drawn up by the CUP against negotiations with the victorious European countries. He tried to resolve the problems that occurred in Constantinople after the Bab-ı Ali Attack (Coup of 1913). Djemal played a significant role in the Second Balkan War, and with the revolution of the CUP on 23 January 1913, he became the commander of Constantinople and was appointed Minister of Public Works. In 1914 he was promoted as the Minister of the Navy.\n\nWhen Europe was divided into two blocs before the First World War, he supported an alliance with France. He went to France to negotiate an alliance with the French, but failed and then sided with Enver and Talaat, who favoured the German side. Djemal, along with Enver and Talaat, took control of the Ottoman government in 1913. The Three Pashas effectively ruled the Ottoman Empire for the duration of World War I and were the three main perpetrators of the Armenian, Greek, and Assyrian genocides. Djemal was one of the designers of the government's internal and foreign policies, nearly all of which proved disastrous for the Empire. For example, his policy to oppose the powers in Eastern Europe caused a dramatic escalation and the 'balkanisation' of the Slavic republics. Multiple contradictory allegiances in a redundant balance-of-powers strategy added immense complexity and immeasurable difficulties to Ottoman logistics across thousands of miles of desert.\n\nAfter the Ottoman Empire declared war on the Allies in World War I, Enver Pasha nominated Djemal Pasha to lead the Ottoman army against British forces in Egypt, and Djemal accepted the position. Previously snubbed by the Allies, Djemal switched his attention to an alliance with the Central Powers, although he had at first been opposed to a full alliance with Germany. Nevertheless, he agreed in early October 1914 to use his ministerial powers to authorise Admiral Souchon to launch a pre-emptive strike in the Black Sea, which led to Russia, Britain and France declaring war on the Ottoman Empire a few days later.\n\nDjemal Pasha was appointed with full powers in military and civilian affairs as Governor of Syria in 1915. A provisional law granted him emergency powers in May of that year. All cabinet decrees from Constantinople concerning Syria became subject to his approval. His offensives on both his first and second attacks on the Suez Canal failed. Coupled with the wartime exigencies and natural disasters that afflicted the region during these years, this alienated the population from the Ottoman government, and led to the Arab Revolt. In the meantime, the Ottoman army usually commanded by Colonel Kress von Kressenstein pushed towards and occupied Sinai. The two men had a thinly disguised contempt for each other, which weakened the command.\n\nHe was known among the local Arab inhabitants as \"al-Saffah\", \"the Blood Shedder\", being responsible for the hanging of many Lebanese, Syrian Shi'a Muslims and Christians wrongly accused of treason on 6 May 1916 in Damascus and Beirut.\n\nIn his political memoirs, the leader of the \"Beirut Reform Movement\" Salim Ali Salam recalls the following: Jamal Pasha resumed his campaign of vengeance; he began to imprison most Arab personalities, charging them with treason against the State. His real intent was to cut off the thoughtful heads, so that, as he put it, the Arabs would never again emerge as a force, and no one would be left to claim for them their rights … After returning to Beirut [from Istanbul], I was summoned … to Damascus to greet Jamal Pasha … I took the train … and upon reaching Aley we found that the whole train was reserved for the prisoners there to take them to Damascus … When I saw them, I realized that they were taking them to Damascus to put them to death. So … I said to myself: how shall I be able to meet with this butcher on the day on which he will be slaughtering the notables of the country? And how will I be able to converse with him? … Upon arriving in Damascus, I tried hard to see him that same evening, before anything happened, but was not successful. The next morning all was over, and the … notables who had been brought over from Aley were strung up on the gallows. During 1915-1916, Djemal had 34 political opponents executed as martyrs.\n\nAt the end of 1915, Djemal with viceregal powers is said to have started secret negotiations with the Allies for ending the war; he proposed to take over the Ottoman administration himself as an independent King of Syria. These secret negotiations came to nothing, in part because the Allies reportedly could not agree on the future territory of the Ottoman Empire; France objected strongly, and Britain was unwilling to fund the Imperial operations. In a new interpretation, historian Sean McMeekin casts doubt on the tradition that Djemal made any such overtures to the Allies. The Pasha was an outspoken critic of the Allies, collaborated fully with the German army, and grew to hate the British Empire.\n\nHis most successful military exploit was against the British Mesopotamian Expeditionary Force, which had arrived in early 1915 from India. 35,000 British troops marched north on Baghdad, hoping to take the citadel with relatively few casualties. Djemal Pasha was appointed to command and marshalled a vast army, ultimately led by General Halil Kut, which by the time of the siege of Kut al-Amara numbered 200,000 Turks and Arab auxiliaries. The British could only evacuate their wounded with Djemal's consent and attempted to send emissaries requesting permission to evacuate while the city was encircled on three sides. Djemal refused to compromise his advantageous position, and strafed enemy attempts by the Tigris Corps to take relief boats up river. They had underestimated Djemal's considerable administrative capabilities and will to resist the Allied armies. The Ottoman troops fought hard at the Battle of Ctesiphon, but the subsequent fate of POWs and civilians later enhanced Djemal Pasha's wartime reputation as a capricious and cruel general. Nonetheless, the successes impressed T. E. Lawrence to write a significant account of their diplomatic encounters when finally Kut fell in April 1916, which provides for \"a colourful character\".\n\nThe ever-present threat of Arab Revolt fomented by British intelligence was rising throughout 1916 and 1917. Djemal instituted strict control over Syria Province against Syrian opponents. Djemal's forces also fought against the Arab nationalists and Syrian nationalists from 1916 onwards. Ottoman authorities occupied the French consulates in Beirut and Damascus and confiscated French secret documents that revealed evidence about the activities and names of the Arab insurgents. Djemal used the information from these documents as well as from others belonging to the Decentralization Party. He believed that insurgency under French control was the main reason for his military failings. With the documents he gathered, Djemal moved against the insurgent forces which were led by Arab political and cultural leaders. This was followed by the military trials of the insurgents known as \"Âliye Divan-ı Harb-i Örfisi\" in which they were punished.\n\nGaza's head of garrison, Major Tiller, had 7 infantry battalions, a cavalry squadron, and some camel troops. The British under Colonel Chetwode already had 2,000 troops in front of the city. Reluctantly, Djemal marched with the 33rd Division to relieve Gaza. Kressenstein was delighted to have repelled the British assault and wanted to mobilise aggressively by driving into Shellal, Wadi Ghazze, and Khan Yunis, but Djemal absolutely forbade it. The British had a whole division in retreat, so Djemal apprehended that a two-battalion sortie would have been annihilated. One of Djemal's associates in Iraq was engineer Colonel Heinrich August Meissner who had built both the Hejaz and Baghdad railways and who was employed on an ambitious project to construct a railway to the Suez canal at Bir Gifgafa. By October 1915, the Central Powers had already built 100 miles of track as far as the oasis of Beersheba. Djemal insisted that an extended railway would be needed to attack British Egypt.\n\nDjemal was completely committed to the Turko-German military machine, and Britain would not relinquish its ambitions to control Syria. Kemal and Djemal became increasingly sceptical of German capabilities, but Djemal was not yet prepared to openly back the German allies. He insisted on the possibility of a planned allied assault behind the Yıldırım Army, as the Seventh Army gathered at the Turco-German Aleppo Conference. In the shake-up that followed, Djemal was demoted to a command of the Fourth Army under General Erich von Falkenhayn. They now adopted a plan similar to the Kress Plan for Gaza and sent the Yıldırım Army to Baghdad. It was not until October 1917 that the Seventh Army could march south to face the growing threat from Allenby, hampered by the limitations of the single-gauge railway, which was built away from the coastline to avoid Royal Navy salvos.\n\nOn 7 November, the British captured Gaza, but Djemal had long since been forced to evacuate. Although chased, he managed to retreat at speed. In December, the Turks were driven out of Jaffa, Djemal's army still in retreat, and the city fell without a fight. Falkenhayn had ordered an evacuation on 14th, and the enemy had begun to enter the same day. But now the Turkish Eighth formed a much stronger line of entrenchment; Djemal's organized defence of Gaza had been amply anticipated by the British. His army delayed them further at the vital Junction railway station. But the British were probably unaware of its importance.\n\nThe fighting in the hills was all but over by 1 December. On 6 December, Djemal Pasha was in Beirut to make a speech publicizing the allied deal to 'carve up' Syria-Palestine into partitioned spheres of influence in the Sykes-Picot agreement. At the end of 1917, Djemal ruled from his post in Damascus as a near-independent ruler of his portion of the Empire. But he had resigned from the 4th Army and returned to Istanbul. On 9 April and then 19 April 1918, Djemal ordered the evacuation of civilians from Jaffa and Jerusalem. The Germans were furious and rescinded the order, revealing the chaos in the Ottoman Empire. Djemal's ambiguous attitude to the subject populations played into the hands of British rule. The Turkish line was solidified in readiness for the final onslaught at Nebi Samwell and Nahr-el-Auja. To the south of Nebi were the defences of Beit Iksa; the Heart and Liver Redoubts before Lifa; and Deir Yassin, two systems behind Ain Karim. In all, there were 4 miles of fortifications.\n\nIn the last congress of Committee of Union and Progress held in 1917, Djemal was elected to the Board of Central Administration.\n\nWith the defeat of the empire in October 1918 and the resignation of Talaat Pasha’s cabinet on 2 November 1918, Djemal fled with seven other leaders of the CUP to Germany, and then Switzerland.\n\nA military court in Turkey accused Djemal of persecuting Arab subjects of the Empire and sentenced him to death \"in absentia\". Later in 1920, Djemal went to Central Asia, where he worked on modernising the Afghan army. Due to the success of the Bolshevik Revolution, Djemal travelled to Tiflis to act as a military liaison officer to negotiate over Afghanistan with the Soviets. Together with his secretary, he was assassinated on 21 July 1922 by Stepan Dzaghigian, Artashes Gevorgyan, and Petros Ter Poghosyan, as part of Operation Nemesis, in retribution for his role in the Armenian Genocide and the First World War. Djemal's remains were brought to Erzurum and buried there.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1878007", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1878007", "title": "Sources of international law", "text": "Sources of international law\n\nInternational law also known as \"law of nations\" is the name of a body of rules which regulate the conduct of sovereign states in their relations with one another. Sources of international law include treaties, international customs, general widely recognized principles of law, the decisions of national and lower courts, and scholarly writings. They are the materials and processes out of which the rules and principles regulating the international community are developed. They have been influenced by a range of political and legal theories.\n\nArticle 38 (1) of the Statute of the International Court of Justice is generally recognized as a definitive statement of the sources of international law. It requires the Court to apply, among other things, (a) international conventions, whether general or particular, establishing rules expressly recognized by the contesting states; (b) international custom, as evidence of a general practice accepted as law; (c) the general principles of law recognized by civilized nations; (d) subject to the provisions of Article 59, judicial decisions and the teachings of the most highly qualified publicists of the various nations, as subsidiary means for the determination of rules of law.\n\nDuring the 19th century, it was recognized by legal positivists that a sovereign could limit its authority to act by consenting to an agreement according to the principle \"pacta sunt servanda\". This consensual view of international law was reflected in the 1920 Statute of the Permanent Court of International Justice, and was later preserved in Article 38(1) of the 1946 Statute of the International Court of Justice.\n\nOn the question of preference between sources of international law, rules established by treaty will take preference if such an instrument exists. It is also argued however that international treaties and international custom are sources of international law of equal validity; this is that new custom may supersede older treaties and new treaties may override older custom. Also, \"jus cogens\" (peremptory norm) is a custom, not a treaty. Certainly, judicial decisions and juristic writings are regarded as auxiliary sources of international law, whereas it is unclear whether the general principles of law recognized by 'civilized nations' should be recognized as a principal or auxiliary source of international law. Nevertheless, treaty, custom, and general principles of law are generally recognized as primary sources of international law.\n\nTreaties and conventions are the persuasive source of international law and are considered \"hard law.\" Treaties can play the role of contracts between two or more parties, such as an extradition treaty or a defense pact. Treaties can also be legislation to regulate a particular aspect of international relations or form the constitutions of international organizations. Whether or not all treaties can be regarded as sources of law, they are sources of obligation for the parties to them. Article 38(1)(a) of the ICJ, which uses the term \"international conventions\", concentrates upon treaties as a source of contractual obligation but also acknowledges the possibility of a state expressly accepting the obligations of a treaty to which it is not formally a party.\n\nFor a treaty-based rule to be a source of law, rather than simply a source of obligation, it must either be capable of affecting non-parties or have consequences for parties more extensive than those specifically imposed by the treaty itself.\n\nThus, the procedures or methods by treaties become legally binding are formal source of law which is a process by a legal rule comes into existence: it is law creating.\n\nSome treaties are the result of codifying existing customary law, such as laws governing the global commons, and \"jus ad bellum\". While the purpose is to establish a code of general application, its effectiveness depends upon the number of states that ratify or accede to the particular convention. Relatively few such instruments have a sufficient number of parties to be regarded as international law in their own right. The most obvious example is the 1949 Geneva Conventions for the Protection of War Victims.\n\nMost multi-lateral treaties fall short of achieving such a near-universal degree of formal acceptance and are dependent upon their provisions being regarded as representing customary international law and, by this indirect route, as binding upon non-parties. This outcome is possible in a number of ways:\n\n\nPursuant to Chapter XVI, Article 103 of the United Nations Charter, the obligations under the United Nations Charter overrides the terms of any other treaty. Meanwhile, its Preamble affirms establishment of the obligations out of treaties and source of international law.\n\nArticle 38(1)(b) of the ICJ Statute refers to \"international custom\" as a source of international law, specifically emphasizing the two requirements of state practice plus acceptance of the practice as obligatory or \"opinio juris sive necessitatis\" (usually abbreviated as \"opinio juris\").\n\nDerived from the consistent practice of (originally) Western states accompanied by opinio juris (the conviction of States that the consistent practice is required by a legal obligation), customary international law is differentiated from acts of comity (mutual recognition of government acts) by the presence of \"opinio juris\" (although in some instances, acts of comity have developed into customary international law, i.e. diplomatic immunity). Treaties have gradually displaced much customary international law. This development is similar to the replacement of customary or common law by codified law in municipal legal settings, but customary international law continues to play a significant role in international law.\n\nWhen examining state practice to determine relevant rules of international law, it is necessary to take into account every activity of the organs and officials of states that relate to that purpose. There has been continuing debate over where a distinction should be drawn as to the weight that should be attributed to what states do, rather than what they say represents the law. In its most extreme form, this would involve rejecting what states say as practice and relegating it to the status of evidence of \"opinio juris\". A more moderate version would evaluate what a state says by reference to the occasion on which the statement was made. It is only relatively powerful countries with extensive international contacts and interests that have regular opportunities of contributing by deed to the practice of international law. The principal means of contribution to state practice for the majority of states will be at meetings of international organizations, particularly the UN General Assembly, by voting and otherwise expressing their view on matters under consideration. Moreover, there are circumstances in which what states say may be the only evidence of their view as to what conduct is required in a particular situation.\n\nThe notion of practice establishing a customary rule implies that the practice is followed regularly, or that such state practice must be \"common, consistent and concordant\". Given the size of the international community, the practice does not have to encompass all states or be completely uniform. There has to be a sufficient degree of participation, especially on the part of states whose interests are likely to be most affected, and an absence of substantial dissent. There have been a number of occasions on which the ICJ has rejected claims that a customary rule existed because of a lack of consistency in the practice brought to its attention.\n\nWithin the context of a specific dispute, however, it is not necessary to establish the generality of practice. A rule may apply if a state has accepted the rule as applicable to it individually, or because the two states belong to a group of states between which the rule applies.\n\nA dissenting state is entitled to deny the opposability of a rule in question if it can demonstrate its persistent objection to that rule, either as a member of a regional group or by virtue of its membership of the international community. It is not easy for a single state to maintain its dissent. Also, rules of the \"jus cogens\" have a universal character and apply to all states, irrespective of their wishes.\n\nDemand for rules that are responsive to increasingly rapid changes has led to the suggestion that there can be, in appropriate circumstances, such a concept as \"instant custom\". Even within traditional doctrine, the ICJ has recognized that passage of a short period of time is not necessarily a bar to the formation of a new rule. Because of this, the question is sometimes raised as to whether the word \"custom\" is suitable to a process that could occur with great rapidity.\n\nIt may be argued that the practice of international organizations, most notably that of the United Nations, as it appears in the resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly, are an additional source of international law, even though it is not mentioned as such in Article 38(1) of the 1946 Statute of the International Court of Justice. Article 38(1) is closely based on the corresponding provision of the 1920 Statute of the Permanent Court of International Justice, thus predating the role that international organizations have come to play in the international plane. That is, the provision of Article 38(1) may be regarded as 'dated\", and this can most vividly be seen in the mention made of 'civilized nations', a mentioning that appears all the more quaint after the decolonization process that took place in the early 1960s and the participation of nearly all nations of the world in the United Nations.\n\nA wealth of state practice does not usually carry with it a presumption that \"opinio juris\" exists. “Not only must the acts concerned amount to a settled practice, but they must also be such, or be carried out in such a way, as to be evidence of a belief that this practice is rendered obligatory by the existence of a rule of law requiring it.”\n\nIn cases where practice (of which evidence is given) comprises abstentions from acting, consistency of conduct might not establish the existence of a rule of customary international law. The fact that no nuclear weapons have been used since 1945, for example, does not render their use illegal on the basis of a customary obligation because the necessary \"opinio juris\" was lacking.\n\nAlthough the ICJ has frequently referred to \"opinio juris\" as being an equal footing with state practice, the role of the psychological element in the creation of customary law is uncertain.\n\nA peremptory norm or \"jus cogens\" (Latin for \"compelling law\" or \"strong law\") is a principle of international law considered so fundamental that it overrides all other sources of international law, including even the Charter of the United Nations. The principle of \"jus cogens\" is enshrined in Article 53 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties:\n\nRules of \"jus cogens\" generally require or forbid the state to do particular acts or respect certain rights. However, some define criminal offenses which the state must enforce against individuals. Generally included on lists of such norms are prohibitions of such crimes and internationally wrongful acts as waging aggressive war, war crimes, crimes against humanity, piracy, genocide, apartheid, slavery and torture.\n\nThe evidence supporting the emergence of a rule of \"jus cogens\" will be essentially similar to that required to establish the creation of a new rule of customary international law. Indeed, \"jus cogens\" could be thought of as a special principle of custom with a superadded \"opinions juries\". The European Court of Human Rights has stressed the international public policy aspect of the \"jus cogens\".\n\nThe scope of general principles of law, to which Article 38(1) of the Statute of the ICJ refers, is unclear and controversial but may include such legal principles that are common to a large number of systems of municipal law. Given the limits of treaties or custom as sources of international law, Article 38(1) may be looked upon as a directive to the Court to fill any gap in the law and prevent a nonliquet by reference to the general principles.\n\nIn earlier stages of the development of international law, rules were frequently drawn from municipal law. In the 19th century, legal positivists rejected the idea that international law could come from any source that did not involve state will or consent but were prepared to allow for the application of general principles of law, provided that they had in some way been accepted by states as part of the legal order. Thus Article 38(1)(c), for example, speaks of general principles \"recognized\" by states. An area that demonstrates the adoption of municipal approaches is the law applied to the relationship between international officials and their employing organizations, although today the principles are regarded as established international law.\n\nThe significance of general principles has undoubtedly been lessened by the increased intensity of treaty and institutional relations between states. Nevertheless, the concepts of estoppel and equity have been employed in the adjudication of international disputes. For example, a state that has, by its conduct, encouraged another state to believe in the existence of a certain legal or factual situation, and to rely on that belief, may be estopped from asserting a contrary situation in its dealings. The principle of good faith was said by the ICJ to be \"[o]ne of the basic principles governing the creation and performance of legal obligations\". Similarly, there have been frequent references to equity. It is generally agreed that equity cannot be employed to subvert legal rules (that is, operate \"contra legem\"). This \"equity as law\" perception is reinforced by references to equitable principles in the text of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea 1982, though this may be little more than an admission as to the existence, and legitimation, of the discretion of the adjudicator.\n\nHowever, the principles of estoppel and equity in the international context do not retain all the connotations they do under common law. The reference to the principles as \"general\" signify that, if rules were to be adapted from municipal law, they should be at a sufficient level of generality to encompass similar rules existing in many municipal systems. Principles of municipal law should be regarded as sources of inspiration rather than as sources of rules of direct application.\n\nAccording to Article 38(1)(d) of its Statute, the ICJ is also to apply \"judicial decisions and the teachings of the most highly qualified publicists of the various nations, as subsidiary means for the determination of rules of law\". It is difficult to tell what influence these materials have on the development of the law. Pleadings in cases before the ICJ are often replete with references to case law and to legal literature.\n\nThe decisions of international and municipal courts and the publications of academics can be referred to, not as a source of law as such, but as a means of recognizing the law established in other sources. In practice, the International Court of Justice does not refer to domestic decisions although it does invoke its previous case-law. \n\nThere is no rule of stare decisis in international law. The decision of the Court has no binding force except between the parties and in respect of that particular case. Nevertheless, often the Court would refer to its past decisions and advisory opinions to support its explanation of a present case.\n\nOften the International Court of Justice will consider General Assembly resolutions as indicative of customary international law.\n\nArticle 38(1)(d) of the \"International Court of Justice Statute\" states that the 'teachings of the most highly qualified publicists of the various nations' are also among the 'subsidiary means for the determination of the rules of law'. The scholarly works of prominent jurists are not sources of international law but are essential in developing the rules that are sourced in treaties, custom and the general principles of law. This is accepted practice in the interpretation of international law and was utilized by the United States Supreme Court in \"The Paquete Habana\" case (175 US (1900) 677 at 700-1).\n\n\n\n"}

The village is surrounded by green belt land. Over the county border in Cheshire, Widnes town centre is to the south-southeast.\n\nHistorically a part of Lancashire, Cronton is an ancient village and was once a centre for the makers of watch parts and movements. There is an ancient cross, now no more than a column of stone on ruined steps. This was one of many stopping places on the way to the parish church at Farnworth. The five-holed stocks next to the war memorial in Coronation Gardens are almost unique to Cronton with few other specimens found anywhere. Many of the 19th Century residents of Cronton were farmers. There was a blacksmith in Cronton Lane (opposite what is now the Black Horse pub). Family names common in Cronton during the 19th Century census returns: Leather, Haughton, Critchley, Dwerryhouse, Atherton, Glover and Lister. The Catholic Church, Holy Family, was opened at the start of the 20th Century. There is also Holy Family Primary school. Prior to this, many Cronton Catholics were carried to St Bartholomew's Church, Rainhill for burial.\n\nIn the early twentieth century, Cronton was \"a favourite resort for cyclists and picnic parties, both from Liverpool and Widnes, on account of a public recreation ground on Pexhill. This hill, rising to only above sea level, is covered with heather and gorse, and on the top are the Widnes Corporation reservoirs, formed in 1868\". Today the Liverpool Astronomical Society has an Observatory - Leighton Observatory - at Pex Hill. It was formerly known as Pex Hill Observatory and Visitors' Centre.\n\nThe village has grown since the 1950s but in recent years has slowed with very little new housing development as it is surrounded by Green Belt. The village has two primary schools and just over the border in Widnes is Riverside College (formerly Widnes sixth-form college and then renamed Widnes and Runcorn sixth-form college with the advent of another campus being added in Runcorn), and locally referred to as \"Cronton College\" as the site directly borders Cronton.\n\nTwo pubs are located in the village, The Unicorn and The Black Horse. Cronton is the location of Pex Hill JFC which is a fast-growing junior football club that utilises the Holy Family Club as its social club. It is also the home of Cronton Villa F.C who play in the Warrington and District league.\n\nNearby stood Cronton Colliery which ceased production in March 1984, shortly before the Great UK miners' strike (1984–1985). Although Cronton 'pit' was a twentieth century enterprise, the surrounding area had supported a coal mining industry throughout the previous century. It was in the 19th century that a large number of Welsh people moved nearby to work 'down the pit' and they brought their distinctive brand of Non-Conformist Christianity with them. There were once at least 31 non-conformist chapels within just three miles (5 km) of Cronton, including three Welsh chapels (Congregational, Methodist and Presbyterian) in Widnes, Welsh Calvinistic Methodists in Huyton Quarry, and a Welsh Methodist in Whiston. Methodism was especially strong in coal-mining communities and Cronton had its own Wesleyan Methodist chapel in Chapel Lane. This chapel still exists and now forms part of the Liverpool District (Widnes Circuit) of the Methodist Church.\n\nCronton colliers mined the pit's first coal during the Great War in 1915. Cronton thrived and the pit was one of 65 Lancashire collieries at the time of nationalisation. Mainly because of the exhaustion of economically viable reserves, the number of Lancashire collieries had been reduced to 41 by 1962. Five years later this had fallen to 21. By the time Cronton colliery finally closed in 1984 it had been making heavy financial losses for many years and the remaining coal reserves were both limited and difficult to mine. Local coal miners were offered alternative jobs at one of the seven remaining Lancashire collieries. (The last Lancashire deep-pit to close was Parkside Colliery in 1993).\n\nThe 43 hectare colliery site lay completely derelict for years until it was acquired by English Partnerships, the government's national regeneration agency, as part of the National Coalfield Programme. In 1995 the site was partially restored by removing both the colliery infrastructure and major earthworks, and then reclaiming colliery spoil by mixing it with paper mill crumb (provided by Brigewater newsprint mill in Ellesmere Port) and sewage cake to create soils for successful woodland planting.\n\nThe colliery site's ownership was transferred to the Northwest Regional Development Agency in 1999 but it will pass the Land Reclamation Trust in the autumn of 2007. The site has a future as public access land, probably as a new country park. To help improve nutrient-poor topsoil conditions, which are currently hindering plant development, compost made from recycled garden waste will be added. The aim is to help improve local biodiversity; establish sustainable, low-maintenance native plant communities; and encourage natural wildlife habitats.\n\nSince 1 April 1974, Cronton has been one of six civil parishes within the Metropolitan Borough of Knowsley, in the metropolitan county of Merseyside, and its boundaries fall within the Whiston South ward for election of Borough councillors. From 1894 until the local government reorganisation of 1974, Cronton was part of Whiston Rural District within the administrative county of Lancashire. Before this Cronton was a township and civil parish, part of the Ecclesiastical Parish of Prescot in West Derby Hundred within the historic county boundaries of Lancashire. To this day the bordering town of Widnes recognises the village as part of its 'empire' which includes the village of Farnworth, though no other surrounding area does.\n\nCronton village is on the A5080, which links Edge Hill in Liverpool to Penketh on the outskirts of Warrington. It lies from Junction 7 on the M62 motorway. Hough Green railway station, on the Liverpool to Warrington line, is away.\nThere are also bus links between Liverpool city centre and Warrington.\n\n"}

Built on a simple and robust design, they have an economical and reliable propulsion system which allows them to be used for overseas presence missions. They were initially intended for use by the French Navy, but have been acquired by the South African Navy, Argentinian Navy and Turkish Navy. \n\nThe \"D'Estienne d'Orves\"-class avisos were primarily designed for anti-submarine warfare (ASW) in coastal areas and colonial coastal patrol. They were ordered as replacements for the E 50 and E 52 type \"escorteurs\" of the French Navy. The ships are built austerely and have a standard displacement of and at full load. The avisos are long overall and between perpendiculars with a beam of and a draught of .\n\nThe avisos are propelled by two shafts turning controllable pitch propellers powered by two SEMT Pielstick 12 PC 2 V400 diesel engines rated at . The two engines are located in a single engine room mounted next to each other and controlled from a room abaft the machinery room. The two diesel engine system was selected due to the preference of endurance over speed. The \"D'Estienne d'Orves\" class has a maximum speed of and a range of at . All ships in the class are fitted with fin stabilisers except for and .\n\nThe class was intended to be constructed in two groups, the A 69 and A 70 types, with the latter type fitted with two Exocet MM38 surface-to-surface missiles (SSM) on either side of the funnel, but in the end, all ships of the class were fitted with the SSMs. The ships are armed with a CADAM gun turret with Najir fire control system and CMS LYNCEA, a pair of modèle F2 guns and four machine guns. For ASW operations, the \"D'Estienne d'Orves\" class mounts four fixed catapults for L3 or L5 type torpedoes with no reloads carried and one remote-controlled sextuple rocket launcher, with 30 reloads carried in a magazine located beneath the aft deckhouse.\n\nThe \"D'Estienne d'Orves\" class is equipped with one air/surface DRBV 51A sentry radar, one DRBC 32E fire control radar one Decca 1226 navigation radar and DUBA 25 hull-mounted sonar. The DUBA 25 is situated in a fixed dome with a retractable transducer, but is designed strictly for use in coastal waters. As countermeasures the avisos have one ARBR 16 radar interceptor, two Dagaie decoy launchers and one SLQ-25 Nixie countermeasure system, which was fitted in the mid-1980s. The ships have a complement of 90 and have space to accommodate 18 marines.\n\nBeyond the Nixe countermeasure system, the funnels aboard the avisos were heightened due to issues with the gases coming from them. had SEMT Pielstick 12 PA 6 BTC diesels with infrared suppression systems installed which led to delays into the vessel's entry into service.

Plans were drawn up to give the two ships a hangar and flight deck for helicopters, but this was abandoned.\n\nFrom 2009, the remaining vessels in French service were reclassified as Offshore Patrol Vessels and, as a result, had their surface-to-surface missiles and heavy anti-submarine weapons removed. \n\nThe Argentine Navy also operates three \"D'Estienne d'Orves\"-class ships, locally known as the . The first two ships, originally named \"Lieutenant de vaisseau Le Hénaff\" and \"Commandant L'Herminier\" while under construction for the French Navy, were originally acquired by the South African Navy in 1976. In the French Navy they were replaced by new ships with the same names. The two ships were renamed \"Good Hope\" and \"Transvaal\", but due to UN sanctions against South Africa, they were not delivered and were bought by the Argentine Navy on 25 December 1978. They were renamed and . A third ship of the class, , was ordered by Argentina and was delivered in 1981.\n\nIn October 2000, Turkey acquired six Type A 69 avisos. They were acquired for the Turkish Navy for coastal patrol in order to release more capable Turkish ships for frontline duty. Five of the six vessels were refitted at Brest before transfer.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1878023", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1878023", "title": "Hate It or Love It", "text": "Hate It or Love It\n\n\"Hate It or Love It\" is a single by American rapper and West Coast hip hop artist The Game, featuring vocals from his former G-Unit member 50 Cent. It was released as the third official single from The Game's debut studio album \"The Documentary\" (2005). The song features production from duo Cool & Dre, with additional production from Dr. Dre. The song features a music sample of \"Rubber Band\" by The Trammps from their debut album \"The Legendary Zing Album\" (1975). \"Hate It or Love It\" achieved commercial success worldwide. The track peaked within the top 10 in multiple countries, including the United Kingdom, Ireland, Netherlands and New Zealand. The single was commercially successful in the United States, peaking at number two on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 for five consecutive weeks, becoming The Game's second top-five single on the chart as a lead artist and 50 Cent's eighth overall top-ten hit. It is The Game's highest-charting single on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 to date.\n\nThe song was kept from the number one position on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 by 50 Cent's single, \"Candy Shop\", (featuring G-Unit Records' first female artist Olivia). \"Hate It or Love It\" reached the number one spot on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs, making it yet again another top five hit on the chart alongside \"How We Do\" which also featured 50 Cent. At the 2006 48th Annual Grammy Awards, the song was nominated for two Grammy Awards, including Grammy Award for Best Rap Song and Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group but lost in both categories to Kanye West's \"Diamonds from Sierra Leone\" and The Black Eyed Peas' \"Don't Phunk with My Heart\", respectively.\n\nThe song first began to be conceived during the middle period of the recording process for \"The Documentary\", in early 2004, during a recording process in which The Game would frequently fly to recording locations in New York City to work with 50 Cent: he would be given beats to hear along the way, to help inspire him. When he initially heard the production that would later become \"Hate It or Love It\", he did not display much interest, as he was \"in a different mind frame\" — conceiving more \"hard hitting\" records. However, on the flight home later that day, he took more of an interest and began to write the first components of the song.\n\nThe chorus is sung and written by 50 Cent, who helped with the rest of the writing process and recording for the song along with The Game at his mansion in Connecticut. The song was even suggested for 50 Cent's album \"The Massacre\" (2005), due to 50 Cent's large artistic input.\n\nWhen The Game arrived at the mansion on the day of recording, 50 Cent presented him with several already part-completed records, with variously placed verses and choruses. The Game wrote his final verse first and worked backward, to avoid tiredness affecting his later verses. After 50 Cent heard the final version of the song after the recording process had finished, he was excited by its potential and felt the song would have to be one of the album's singles. It was later released as the album's third, after \"Westside Story\" and \"How We Do\", both of which also featured 50 Cent.\n\nThe original production for \"Hate It or Love It\" first surfaced on a compilation CD, put together by Cool & Dre (who had been in contact with The Game since early 2002), and released unofficially to the local rap community. After G-Unit Records producer Sha Money XL received a copy of this disc, he requested a meeting with the duo, feeling that the song had much potential to be a hit. After Dr. Dre heard the original production, he made sonic alterations and, according to Aftermath Entertainment A&R Mike Lynn, \"made it sound like a record\", a process he carried out on all of the other tracks on \"The Documentary\". When Interscope Records chairman Jimmy Iovine later requested to hear the original production, he admitted could not tell the difference. Cool & Dre later praised the quality of Dr. Dre's mix, stating that \"Dre brought it to life... [As a mixer is what] I think is his best quality... his ear for instrument placement is amazing\".\n\nBuilt around a sample of the song \"Rubber Band\" by The Trammps, \"Hate It or Love It\" is backed by a soul-orientated production, which contains a \"smoothed out R&B funk vibe\".\n\n\"Hate It or Love It\" received general acclaim from critics. Scott McKeating of \"Stylus Magazine\" wrote that \"It's a great piece of warm soul-fuelled hip-hop, in which guest star 50 Cent manages to steal the show, considerably stepping up his lyrical content to squash together some great but clichéd lines against a level of his infamous smart arsed profundity.\" IGN described the song as \"a smoothed out R&B funk vibe underneath the tales of the hood.\" \"Pitchfork\" listed the song as the 93rd best song of the 2000s.\n\nThe song has earned The Game award nominations. In 2006 \"Hate It or Love It\" was nominated at the 48th Annual Grammy Awards for both Grammy Award for Best Rap Song and Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group, but lost in both categories to Kanye West's \"Diamonds from Sierra Leone\" and The Black Eyed Peas' \"Don't Phunk with My Heart\", respectively. \"Hate It or Love It\" was named number one on About.com's Best Hip-Hop Songs of 2005 and was ranked at number 43 on VH1's \"100 Greatest Songs of Hip Hop\".\n\nThe setting of the music video alternates between Compton, California and Jamaica, Queens, New York City, New York. The video recalls the rough childhoods of 50 Cent and The Game, showing where they come from, what it was like living in their neighborhoods, and the struggles they overcame as kids to become rappers. Tequan Richmond portrays The Game and Zachary Williams plays 50 Cent in their youth. In one scene, the two are caught spraypainting \"N.W.A\" on a wall, resulting in their arrest by two policemen. Big Fase 100, members of Black Wall Street, Tony Yayo and Lloyd Banks make cameo appearances.\n\nThis video was nominated at the MTV Video Music Awards of 2005 for Best Rap Video, but lost to the video for Ludacris' song \"Number One Spot\".\n\nThe music video was directed by The Saline Project.\n\nThere have been several remixes of the track:\n\n\n\n"}

In 2015 she was selected as the Jefferson Lecturer by the National Endowment for the Humanities. She is the founding director of the Institute on the Arts and Civic Dialogue at New York University.\n\nSmith was born in 1950 into an African-American family in Baltimore, Maryland, the daughter of Anna Rosalind (née Young), an elementary school principal, and Deaver Young Smith, Jr., a coffee merchant. She has four younger siblings. She started attending school shortly after the city had started integrating the public schools, and attended both majority-black and majority-white schools during her lower years. Smith is an alumna of the historic Western High School, an all-girls school. \n\nSmith studied acting at Beaver College (now Arcadia University), where she was one of seven African-American women in her class, graduating in 1971. During her college career, she started to identify as black. She went to the West Coast for graduate work, receiving an M.F.A. in Acting from the American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco, California.\n\nAt the beginning of her career, Smith appeared in a wide range of stage productions, including the role of Mistress Quickly in an Off-Broadway production of Shakespeare's \"The Merry Wives of Windsor\" with the Riverside Shakespeare Company, produced by Joseph Papp and the New York Shakespeare Festival. This production was set in New Orleans in post-Civil War America. For the role, Smith transformed herself into a \"Cajun voodoo woman.\" She used her ability to take on other characters in her future work. From being in a variety of situations and in a kind of outsider status, she was a close observer of people and their language. She later told Henry Louis Gates, Jr., when appearing on his show \"Finding Your Roots\", that she had difficulty getting jobs at the beginning of her acting career because people did not know how to categorize her in terms of ethnicity for casting.\n\nSmith is best known as a playwright and actress for her \"documentary theatre\" style, also called verbatim theatre, in plays such as \"Fires in the Mirror\" (1992) and \"\" (1993). Both featured Smith as the sole performer of multiple and diverse characters, based on interviews she had conducted with numerous residents and commentators in the two cities where riots took place. For these works, she won the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding One-Person Show two years in a row. She interviewed more than 100 people as part of her creation of \"Fires in the Mirror\", which dealt with the 1991 Crown Heights riot. In 1992, she interviewed some 300 people as part of her research for creating \"Twilight: Los Angeles, 1992\", which dealt with the 1992 Los Angeles riots after the acquittal of police officers who beat Rodney King, in events captured on tape. Both of these plays were constructed using material solely from interviews. \n\nSmith's plays \"House Arrest\" (2000) and \"Let Me Down Easy\" (2008) were also created in this style.\n\"Let Me Down Easy\", which explored the resiliency and vulnerability of the human body, debuted at the Long Wharf Theatre in January 2008. It was also performed at the American Repertory Theater in September and October 2008. A revised version of the show had its New York City premiere Off-Broadway at Second Stage Theatre in October 2009. It enjoyed favorable reviews and an extension into January 2010. It was a featured program as part of PBS's \"Great Performances\" series on January 13, 2012. \n\nSmith debuted her one-woman play, \"The Arizona Project\" in Phoenix, Arizona, in November 2008. The piece, which explored \"women's relationships to justice and the law,\" was commissioned by Bruce Ferguson, director of Future Arts Research (F.A.R.), a new artist-driven research program at Arizona State University in Phoenix.\n\nIn 2009, Smith was an artist-in-residence with the Center for American Progress.\n\nIn Spring 2012, Smith was the first artist-in-residence at Grace Cathedral, San Francisco, a program founded by the Very Rev Jane Shaw, Dean of Grace Cathedral, who shared Smith's vision of \"bringing together art and religion\". \n\nCommissioned by Grace Cathedral and the Cockayne Fund, Smith wrote and performed the play, \"On Grace\", based on interviews relating to the meaning of God's grace. The performances were accompanied by American cellist Joshua Roman.\n\nSmith has appeared in several films, including \"Philadelphia\" (1993), \"Dave\" (1993), \"The American President\" (1995), \"Rent\" (2005), and \"Rachel Getting Married\" (2008). \n\nShe had recurring roles in the TV series \"The Practice\" (2000) and as Dr. Nancy McNally on \"The West Wing\" (2000–06). Smith also appeared as hospital administrator Gloria Akalitus in the Showtime dark comedy series \"Nurse Jackie\", which premiered in June 2009. Early in her television career, she appeared on the long-running soap opera \"All My Children\" in the recurring role of \"Hazel the shampoo girl\".\n\nIn February 2014, Smith appeared as a mentor in \"Anna Deavere Smith: A YoungArts Masterclass\", part of the HBO documentary series \"Masterclass\".\n\nIn 2015, Smith appeared as a guest of Dr. Henry Louis Gates, Jr., on the PBS television show \"Finding Your Roots\". Her ancestry in America was revealed to her for the first time. She was descended from a long line of free people of color. The most striking facts were linked to her great, great grandfather, Basil Biggs, born 1820 in Maryland. He and his wife Mary were listed in the 1850 U.S. census to be free. His occupation was listed as veterinarian. In 1858, he moved his wife and four children from the slave state of Maryland to the free state of Pennsylvania. He chose to settle in Gettysburg. Another newsworthy article was found in the Cleveland Gazette (1892) which referred to Basil Biggs as the \"wealthiest Afro-American in Gettysburg,\" mentioning his great home on 120 acres. \n\nIn early 2017, Smith worked with Melissa McCarthy in the film \"Can You Ever Forgive Me?\" In New York City, they filmed one scene together in which their characters briefly reunite for the first time after the long-ago end of their relationship. Smith's character is a university professor of literature. In October 2018, this film was distributed to cinemas by Fox Searchlight Pictures.\n\nSmith teaches in the Department of Art & Public Policy at the Tisch School of the Arts at New York University.

The city center is on one side and the other side is named Samarinda Seberang.\n\nAt the start of the Gowa War, the Dutch under Admiral Speelman's command attacked Makassar from the sea. Meanwhile, the Netherlands' local ally Arung Palaka led a ground attack. The Kingdom of Gowa was forced to surrender and Sultan Hasanuddin was made to sign the Treaty of Bongaja on 19 November 1667.\n\nThe treaty did not quell all trouble for the Dutch however, since the Bugis from Gowa continued their struggle using guerilla tactics. Some Buginese moved to other islands close by such as Kalimantan. A few thousand people led by Lamohang Daeng Mangkona or Pua Ado I, moved to East Kalimantan, known then as Kutai, where they were welcomed by the local Sultan.\n\nSamarinda was a small, sleepy town in 1942 with several small oil fields in the vicinity. It was occupied by the Japanese after the Dutch East Indies had fallen.\n\nIn 1955, the Apostolic Vicariate of Samarinda was established in the city. In 1961, it was promoted as the Diocese of Samarinda. In 2003, the diocese was promoted as the. Metropolitan Archdiocese of Samarinda.\n\nRecent developments such as malls and housing complex have made Samarinda a little more livable than it was before.\n\nSamarinda City is divided into ten districts (Indonesian: \"kecamatan\"), tabulated below with their 2017 Census population:\nSamarinda has a tropical rainforest climate (Af) with heavy rainfall year-round.\nThe name Samarinda originates from the description of the way in which the Bugis houses were constructed. At that time houses were customarily built on a raft and generally had the same height. This provided important social symbolism of equality between residents; no person's house, and thus no person, was seen as higher or lower than another. They named the settlement 'Samarenda', meaning 'equally low'. After hundreds of years of use the pronunciation of the name changed slightly and the city became known as Samarinda.\n\nThe economy of Samarinda is driven by the large amount of logging and oil extraction companies based there. Similar to Balikpapan, many national logging companies are based in Samarinda. There are many abandoned coal mines in Samarinda. Coal mining used to be very popular in Samarinda. However, the Indonesian government revoked many mining licenses due to the use of illegal chemicals and machinery. Due to all these economical activities in Samarinda, it is one of the richest cities in East Kalimantan.\n\nSamrainda is connected by Trans-Kalimantan Highway Southern Route. From Balikpapan to Samarinda, the highway runs in parallel with the first controlled-access expressway in Borneo, the Samarinda-Balikpapan Expressway, which is now under construction, and expected to be operational by the end of 2018.\n\nThe city is served by Aji Pangeran Tumenggung Pranoto International Airport, which replaced previous Temindung Airport. It is one of Kaltim's busiest airports in terms of passenger and cargo movements. It is the primary hub of Kaltim Airlines.\n\nThe prominent coal loading port of Tanjung Bara (TBCT) lies about 160 kilometres to the north of Samarinda.\n\nThe territory's population in 2017 was 843,446 (435,947 man and 407,497 woman), with an average annual growth rate of 0.018% in 2016–2017. The majority of the people of Samarinda are of Native Indonesian and Chinese descent. There are also Americans, Canadians, Japanese and Koreans working in Samarinda. Life expectancy in Samarinda is 73.6 years as of 2014.\n\nSamarinda's main religions are Islam, Christianity and Buddhism. The Christian community of around 89,000 forms about 10.2% of the total population; Protestants form a larger number than Roman Catholics at a rate of 10:3. There are also Hindu communities.\n\n"}

The original lineup consisted of two brothers, Brandon (vocals, bass guitar and keyboards) and Benjamin Curtis (guitar and backing vocals), and Josh Garza (drums). Benjamin left the band in March 2007 to focus on his work with School of Seven Bells, and was replaced on guitar by Phil Karnats.\n\nBefore forming Secret Machines, the members played in various Dallas bands such as UFOFU, Captain Audio, Comet, When Babies Eat Pennies, and Tripping Daisy. Captain Audio was formed by Garza and vocalist/guitarist/chief songwriter Regina Chellew in the late 1990s as a two-piece noise duo. Brandon—and occasionally Ben—Curtis joined soon after as the original duo began to develop a more standard rock sound. In a little over a year they had recorded and released the EP \"My Ears Are Ringing But My Heart's OK\" (1999) and the full-length \"Luxury\" or \"Whether It Is Better To Be Loved than Feared\" (2000). Shortly after the release of \"Luxury\" the band went on extended hiatus and eventually disbanded when Garza and the Curtis brothers moved to New York, leaving Chellew in Dallas to form the band Chao and later join indie pop outfit The Happy Bullets.\n\nThe band first recorded their EP \"September 000\" in Chicago, six weeks after forming. Upon moving to New York the band developed their sound and signed to Warner Brothers.\n\nIn 2004, Secret Machines released their first full-length CD, \"Now Here Is Nowhere\". The album was released online for purchase well ahead of the physical release, an uncommon decision which helped garner additional press coverage. The song \"Nowhere Again\", from their debut album, was used in promotional spots for American during its launch, and appeared in the 2006 video game \"\".\n\nThe album was received very well critically with a composite 80 out of 100 rating from critics compiled by Metacritic.\n\nTheir second EP, \"The Road Leads Where It's Led\", was released on June 7, 2005. The EP includes a re-recording of the song \"The Road Leads Where It's Led\", which originally appeared on the debut full-length. Secret Machines opened for Interpol during their 2004 tour in support of the album.\n\nIn 2005, Secret Machines opened for Oasis in Europe and co-headlined a US tour with Kings of Leon.\n\nIn 2006, \"Ten Silver Drops\", their second album, leaked onto file sharing websites following the release of their lead single \"Alone, Jealous and Stoned\" in the UK. The album was once again received favorably. The album received a composite 75 out of 100 on Metacritic composite rating.\n\nIn 2006, the band toured heavily, including opening for U2 for three dates in Mexico.\n\nFollowing the album's release, the band were interviewed for radio by David Bowie, who was a fan of the band.\n\nBenjamin Curtis left the band on March 3, 2007, to focus full-time on his new band, School of Seven Bells. The news was posted by Brandon Curtis on the Secret Machines' message board. On December 29, 2013, Benjamin Curtis died of lymphoma in New York City at the age of 35.\n\nAfter Ben's departure from the band, Secret Machines played two shows in New York, one at the Annex, and the other at the newly opened Highline Ballroom. At these shows, the band played mostly new material to be put on their next album. They included two new members: Blasco (Interpol's touring keyboardist) on guitar, keyboards, and bass, and ex-Tripping Daisy member Phil E. Karnats on guitar. Since these shows, Karnats has become the official guitarist of the band, replacing Ben.\n\nThe band finished recording quickly during May 2007 and released a new, self-titled album in the United States on October 14, 2008, on their newly formed TSM recording and distributed by Worlds Fair Records. Karnats announced on his MySpace blog that he recorded guitar parts for the album and would continue to play live with the band.\n\nIn 2010, a new single \"Like I Can\" along with \"A terrible light\" was released digitally, and Brandon Curtis announced plans for a new Secret Machines album, to be titled \"The Moth, The Lizard and The Secret Machines\". While no official announcement was made, the band has been inactive since 2010.\n\nIn 2016, Run Out Groove Records, a subsidiary of Warner Brothers, announced that fans had voted \"Now Here is Nowhere\" as the new labels 3rd project for vinyl re-issue. This marked the first release of the title in The U.S. on vinyl, limited to 1,625 copies. On September 10, 2018, the label announced that the band's album \"Ten Silver Drops\" had been voted by fans as the next ROG re-release and would include a 6-song bonus disc containing B-sides and unreleased alternate versions of songs.\n\nSecret Machines has been described as progressive rock with some krautrock influences. They describe themselves as space rock. Many have also cited Secret Machines as a style of shoegaze.\n\nThe band described \"Ten Silver Drops\" as \"being influenced by our love for Brian Eno and all things experimental, on the other hand was our love for The Beatles.\"\n\nThey have toured with Foo Fighters, Spiritualized, Oasis, Interpol, M83, Kings of Leon, among others. Secret Machines supported the British rock trio Muse at London's Earls Court in December 2004. They appeared at Lollapalooza 2006 in Chicago and the Carling Reading and Leeds Festivals in England in the same year, as well as the Austin City Limits Music Festival in Texas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe band contributed three tracks to the soundtrack for the 2007 film \"Across the Universe\": a duet of \"I Am the Walrus\" with Bono on lead vocals and the instrumentals, \"Flying\", and \"Blue Jay Way\".\n"}

He was the founder of the town of Bellvue northwest of Fort Collins.\n\nPrior to the American Civil War, Flowers owned and operated three river boats along the Ohio River carrying passengers between Marietta, Ohio and St. Louis, Missouri. After two of his boats were destroyed in a sudden storm, he took the remaining boat and sailed down the Ohio to St. Louis, then up the Missouri River to Kansas City, Kansas, where he settled with his family in Wyandotte (now part of Kansas City). In 1873 he organized the Wyandotte Colony, a party of settlers, and led them west to the Colorado Territory to settle at the Union Colony at Greeley, which had been founded three years early as a religiously-oriented agricultural cooperative.\n\nFlowers was not contented at the Union Colony, however, and he relocated later that year upstream on the Cache la Poudre River to just west of Fort Collins, in an area just west of the Dakota Hogback known as Pleasant Valley. The valley had been settled by white homesteaders starting in 1860, and the area just south of the town near Stout (under present-day Horsetooth Reservoir) was the location of stone quarries developed by the Union Pacific Railroad. Flowers established and platted the town of Bellvue in the valley. In 1880, Flowers founded a general store in Bellvue to cater to the quarry workers and their families. He built a one-story sandstone building to house a general store. The building, which still stands, later became the local meeting of the Grange in the 20th century and today is known as the \"Bellvue Grange\". On June 24, 1884, he opened the first post office in Bellvue at his store. Flowers also built a horse racing track and grandstand for community gathers, dog and pony shows, and traveling medicine shows. He developed and garden and raised pigs for unfortunate families of quarry workers, a generosity that earned him the name \"Uncle Jacob\" in the local press during his lifetime.\n\nHe also surveyed a road through the foothills west of Bellvue south of Rist Canyon. The road was widely used for passage along the south bank of the Poudre River, as well as to access the timber in the foothills. The road was eventually extended over Lulu Pass and became known as the Flowers Road. It fell into disuse after the construction of present-day State Highway 14 through the Poudre Canyon. The road is sporadically marked as a foot trail through the foothills in the Roosevelt National Forest.\n\n"}

The film is the second film in the \"Pusher\" trilogy, portraying the lives of criminals in Copenhagen.\n\nThe film opens some time after the original film with Tonny serving out his last day of a prison sentence. His cell-mate delivers a monologue advising Tonny to conquer his fear. He then reminds Tonny that he owes him money, but has chosen to give him more time out of respect for Tonny's father, the Duke, a vicious gangster. Upon his release, Tonny visits his father's garage business seeking employment. The Duke has a younger son from a different mother now and receives Tonny coldly, but he ultimately allows Tonny to work for him on a trial basis. Tonny steals a Ferrari in an effort to impress his father, but the car is rejected and the Duke berates Tonny mercilessly for his lack of responsibility. \nWhile hanging out with his friend Ø, Tonny is told that he has a child with a local woman Charlotte. Charlotte has raised the child by herself so far and demands that Tonny start paying her child support. Tonny makes empty promises to pay, but soon comes to care for the child. Tonny successfully participates in a car heist for the Duke, but is forced to ride in the trunk of the escape car because there are no seats left.\n\nTonny helps a local pimp and hoodlum, \"Kurt the Cunt\", make a heroin deal with Milo, the drug lord from the first movie. When one of Milo's thugs arrives late, a spooked Kurt flushes the heroin down the toilet. Kurt now has no money or drugs to sell and cannot pay back the money he borrowed for the deal. Kurt convinces Tonny to help buy him a gun and shoot him in the arm to convince Kurt's backers that he was robbed. While visiting with Charlotte and his son, Tonny learns how to change his son's diaper. Ø watches and reveals that he is about to marry his girlfriend Gry and have a child of his own.\n\nAt Ø's wedding reception, the Duke delivers a toast telling Ø that he thinks of him as a son, and then chides Tonny. Tonny gets drunk and becomes angry as he watches Charlotte neglecting their child to snort cocaine with Gry in the club's kitchen. He insists that she take the baby home, but she refuses by berating and humiliating Tonny. Enraged, Tonny attacks Charlotte before several men pull him away. Realizing that he has once again made a fool of himself, Tonny leaves the party and meets Kurt, who is lingering outside. Kurt convinces Tonny to help him smash up his apartment to further support their story. In return Kurt promises to put in a good word for Tonny with the Duke. After Kurt attacks a prostitute that emerges from his bedroom, he tells Tonny he is going to finish her off and Tonny, wanting no part of it, leaves. Kurt reveals that his financial backer is the Duke and that he has lied so that Tonny will share in Kurt's debt.\n\nTonny visits his father to find a way to reconcile and pay off his debt. Tonny volunteers to intimidate the Duke's ex-wife Jeanette, who is trying to take custody of his young half-brother, to force her to drop the custody claim. The Duke is hesitant to give the job to Tonny, but his brother Red vouches for Tonny because he did well during the car heist. The Duke insists that Tonny kill Jeanette, and he agrees. Tonny visits Jeanette where she works, at Kurt's brothel, but he cannot go through with the murder. After returning and admitting his failure to his father, the Duke berates him savagely. Tonny snaps and viciously stabs the Duke to death. He flees and goes looking for Ø, but instead finds Gry and Charlotte getting high. They deride Tonny and then leave the baby unattended. Tonny takes the child and gets on a bus, fleeing the city. The film ends with a shot of the tattoo on the back of Tonny's head which reads \"\"Respect\"\".\n\n\nThe film holds a score of 100% on Rotten Tomatoes, with an average rating of 7.55/10 based on 10 reviews from critics. Metacritic gave an average score of 78 out of 100, indicating \"Generally favorable reviews\".\n\nThe soundtrack was composed by Peter Peter, in collaboration with Peter Kyed and performed by Peter Peter's band The Bleeder Group. The soundtrack uses an updated version of the \"\"Pusher theme\"\" composed by Peter Peter and Povl Kristian for the first film. Nicolas Winding Refn arranged a competition, the \"Pusher II Soundtrack Hunt\", in collaboration with GAFFA and the website Mymusic, to find diegetic music to use in the film. Among the tracks chosen was \"Sad Disco\" by Keli Hlodversson.\n\nThis movie is the second film in a trilogy of \"Pusher\" films written and directed by Refn. Each film takes place in the same fictional Copenhagen underworld. The original \"Pusher\" follows Tonny's original partner Frank (Kim Bodnia), and his desperate attempt to raise money after a drug deal gone wrong. \"Pusher II\" references the events of this film several times. Charlotte comments on the scars on Tonny's head, a result of the beating he received from Frank. Milo later asks Tonny if he has seen Frank lately, as Milo wanted to kill Frank at the end of \"Pusher\". This comment reveals that Frank disappeared after the events of that film, but it's not mentioned if he fled or if Milo killed him.\n\nThe third film in the trilogy is \"Pusher 3\", which follows the Serbian drug lord Milo as he struggles with his drug addiction, several bad drug deals, and his daughter's birthday celebration.\n\n"}

At least two P538s were built with the Chevrolet Corvette's 327-cu.in. V8 engines and two more with 4.0 and 3.5-litre Lamborghini V12 engines. Five-speed manual transaxles were used, with gearing specific to the race for which each car was constructed. Braking was via inboard four wheel disc brakes, with a fully independent suspension. The body was made of fiberglass over a tubular steel chassis.\n\nThe first V8-powered car debuted at Le Mans in 1966, with Swiss drivers Edgar Berney and Andre Wicky, but records indicate both retired after three hours with a cooling problem. A second team in a production-based Bizzarrini A3/C, driven by Sam Posey and Massimo Natili, was disqualified after a pit lane violation, possibly while returning with serious frame damage.\n\nAmerican Ferrari driver Mike Gammino then commissioned a Lamborghini 4.0-liter V12 powered car, which he raced once. The workshop of Neri and Bonacini and bodywork company BBM were involved in constructing this car. Bizzarrini attempted to build a second, 3.5-litre V12 car for Le Mans, but was unable to complete it before bankruptcy.\n\nBeginning in the mid-1970s and continuing at least through the 1990s, former Bizzarrini engineer Salvatore Diomante at Autocostruzione SD, Torino, began building continuation P538s on commission for private buyers. These may be distinguished from 1960s-built cars by the use of square as opposed to round tubing. Giotto Bizzarrini and his wife likely assisted in construction of the early cars, and they were built using some original Sixties Bizzarrini components as available. The first two cars of this series using square-tube construction bear serial numbers #002 and #003; the 3.5-litre V12 Van Horneff car also uses serial #002, and was last known to be located in England. Engines vary, but include Chevrolet V8s, Lamborghini V12s and possibly a six-cylinder Fiat. Diomante constructed an unknown number, using original fiberglass body molds, probably fewer than 8.\n\nEven Bizzarrini’s “production” A3/C and 5300 GT road cars are often obscure in origin; today, neither Bizzarrini nor Gammino are entirely clear on what happened more than 40 years ago. However, both agree that there has been no correct accounting of the P538s. There are definitely two surviving V8 and two V12 cars; there may be as many as four more V8 cars.\n\nBizzarrini used the first P538 built for development work in the beginning of 1966, and it probably crashed that winter. The car that appeared at Le Mans four months later may have been this car; it may have been a second car; or more likely, it reused any and all salvageable parts of the original car, whatever those were.\n\nIn 1967, Bizzarrini rebodied at least one V8 as a coupe and sold it to the Duke of Aosta (it is known as the Duca d’Aosta coupe). Some sources suggest this was a third V8 car, possibly constructed as a second 1967 Le Mans entry. Another, possibly the 1966 Le Mans car, was also rebodied; it ended up in the hands of Giugiaro at ItalDesign; he rebodied it a third time (at least) as his Manta show car. Both the Duca d’Aosta and ItalDesign cars have remained in those configurations, and are the only V8s that can be reliably confirmed as Bizzarrinis built in the 1960s.\n\nMike Gammino’s 4.0-litre car, often called 001 but actually un-numbered, was completed in 1965, after which he imported it into the US. He ran it once at Bridgehampton, where “we had some problems with it.” He gave it to his mechanic Libero Gerardi, and after his death, it passed through a series of owners until it landed at the San Diego Automotive Museum.\n\nThe other V12 P538 uses a Lamborghini 3.5-liter engine and is stamped P538 002 on a front stabilizer. It was built for the 1967 Le Mans 24h but never completed. According to an interview with Sir Stirling Moss, the transaxle casing appears to be identical to an Alfa Romeo Tipo. Disassembled by Bizzarrini by 1970, he finished it as a commission in 1974 or 1975. It is currently owned by American Van Horneff.\n\n"}
{"id": "1878076", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1878076", "title": "Fires in the Mirror", "text": "Fires in the Mirror\n\nFires in the Mirror: Crown Heights, Brooklyn and Other Identities (1992) is a one-person play by Anna Deavere Smith, an African-American playwright, author, actress, and professor. It explores the viewpoints of people from Black and Hasidic Jewish people based in New York City who were connected directly and indirectly to the Crown Heights riot that occurred in Crown Heights, Brooklyn in August 1991.\n\n\"Fires in the Mirror\" is composed of monologues taken directly by Smith from transcripts of the interviews she conducted with the people whom she portrays in the play. She interviewed more than 100 individuals in the course of creating this play. It is considered a pioneering example of the genre known as verbatim theatre. It received the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding One-Person Show.\n\nAnna Deavere Smith's play \"Fires in the Mirror\" is a part of her project \"On the Road: A Search for the American Character\". It is a series of monologues which she has created from interviews. \"Fires in the Mirror\" chronicles the Crown Heights riot in Brooklyn, New York in August 1991. In that racially divided neighborhood, populated largely by African Americans and Chabad Hasidic Jews, a car driven by a Jewish man veered onto a sidewalk and struck two children, killing Gavin Cato, a 7-year-old Caribbean-American boy. The death, and what the African-American community perceived as a delayed response of city emergency medical personnel, sparked protests by them in the neighborhood. During these, a group of black youths attacked and fatally injured Yankel Rosenbaum, a Jewish student visiting from Australia. Days of rioting ensued, exposing to national scrutiny the depth of the racial divisions in Crown Heights. The rioting resulted in 190 injuries, 129 arrests, and an estimated one million dollars in property damage.\n\nSmith interviewed residents of Crown Heights, including participants in the disturbances, as well as leading politicians, writers, musicians, religious leaders, and intellectuals. From this material, she chose which figures to highlight and speeches to use in the monologues of her play. Through the words of 26 different people, in 29 monologues, Smith explores how and why these people signaled their identities, how they perceived and responded to people different from themselves, and how barriers between groups can be breached. \"My sense is that American character lives not in one place or the other,\" Smith writes in her introduction to the play, \"but in the gaps between the places, and in our struggle to be together in our differences.\" The title of the play suggests a vision of art as a site of reflection where the passions and fires of a specific moment can be examined from a new angle, contemplated, and better understood.\n\nThe figures/characters are as follows:\n\nNtozake Shange: 42- to 45-year-old African-American playwright, poet, novelist.\n\nAnonymous Lubavitcher Woman: Jewish mid-thirties preschool teacher.\n\nGeorge C. Wolfe: African-American playwright who was also director/producer of the New York Shakespeare Festival. (served 1993-2004)\n\nAaron M. Bernstein: Jewish man in his fifties. Physicist at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n\nAnonymous Girl: A junior high, teen-age black girl of Haitian descent. Lives in Brooklyn. (near Crown Heights)\n\nThe Reverend Al Sharpton: Well-known African-American New York activist and minister.\n\nRivkah Siegal: Lubavitcher woman. Graphic designer. Age unspecified.\n\nAngela Davis: Prominent African-American activist in her late 40s. Author, orator, and scholar. Then a Professor in the History of Consciousness Department at the University of California, Santa Cruz. \n\nMonique 'Big Mo' Matthews: African-American rapper in Los Angeles.\n\nLeonard Jeffries: African-American Professor of African American Studies at City University of New York, where he was former chair of the department.\n\nLetty Cottin Pogrebin: Author and founding editor of \"Ms. Magazine\". Of Jewish descent and in her fifties.\n\nMinister Conrad Mohammed: African-American minister of New York associated with the Nation of Islam; he later became a Baptist. He served as minister for Louis Farrakhan.\n\nRobert F. Sherman: Executive Director of the City of New York's Increase the Peace Corps (part of the Mayor's Office).\n\nRabbi Joseph Spielman: Spokesperson in the Luabvitch community.\n\nReverend Canon Doctor Heron Sam: African-American pastor at St. Mark's Crown Heights Church. \n\nAnonymous Young Man #1: resident of Crown Heights, Caribbean-American man in his late teens or early twenties.\n\nMichael S. Miller: Executive Director of the Jewish Community Relations Council.\n\nHenry Rice: Crown Heights resident.\n\nNorman Rosenbaum: Brother of Yankel Rosenbaum, an Australian.\n\nAnonymous Young Man #2: Crown Heights resident, an African-American young man in his late teens or early twenties.\n\nSonny Carson: African-American activist.\n\nRabbi Shea Hecht: middle-aged Lubavitcher rabbi, spokesperson.\n\nRichard Green: Director of the Crown Heights Youth Collective and Co-director of Project CURE (a black-Hasidic basketball team that was developed after the riots)\n\nRoslyn Malamud: Lubavitcher resident of Crown Heights.\n\nReuven Ostrov: Lubavitcher youth and member of project CURE, 17 years old at the time of the riot. He worked as an assistant chaplain at Kings County Hospital.\n\nCarmel Cato: Father of Gavin Cato, immigrant from Guyana and resident of Crown Heights.\nThe play is a series of monologues based on interviews conducted by Smith with people involved in the Crown Heights crisis, both directly and as observers and commentators. Each scene is titled with the person's name and a key phrase from that interview. There are a total of 29 monologues in \"Fires in the Mirror\" and each one focuses on a character's opinion and point of view of the events and issues surrounding the crisis. Most characters have one monologue; the Reverend Al Sharpton, Letty Cottin Pogrebin and Norman Rosenbaum have two monologues each.\n\n\"Fires in the Mirror\" is divided into themed sections. The themes include elements of personal identity, differences in physical appearance, differences in race, and the feelings toward the riot incidents. The overall arc of the play flows from broad personal identity issues, to physical identity, to issues of race and ethnicity, and finally ending in issues relating to the Crown Heights riot.\n\nThe play is structured as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Fires in the Mirror\" is a collection of multiple voices and points of view. It is a hybrid of theater and journalism.\n\nSmith provides information as to where each interview was done, including the settings and environment, other people who were near, and when the interviews took place. This emphasizes the fact that the play was drawn from the words of people who were directly involved with events. \n\nThe play is written as verse. Smith uses lines, ellipses, and other notation, to express how people expressed themselves in each interview.\n\n\"Fires in the Mirror\" is a postmodern play. According to David Rush, characteristics of a postmodern play include the minimization of a single \"author\"; its purpose is to engage the audience rather than express one point of view. There may be multiple narratives interacting with each other, the structure departs from the conventional play pattern, and the play is usually fragmented. \"Fires in the Mirror\" encompasses all of these characteristics.\n\nThe central focus of \"Fires in the Mirror\" is the resentment anger between two ethnic groups in the densely populated area of Crown Heights, Brooklyn, in New York City: the Lubavitcher Orthodox Jewish community and the African-American community. The monologues refer to such historic events as the Holocaust of World War II and slavery history of the United States, defining periods for each ethnic group. In addition, they express the often-fraught relationships between the two ethnic groups and the police, as well as the perceptions of the relationships between each other.\n\nBy showing many different points of view and opinions on the issue of the riot, the play highlights that there are not just two sides, divided by race, but rather many different individual attitudes, emotions, and opinions.\n\n\"Fires in the Mirror\" is staged as a one-person play. In the original production, there was no real physical set and Deavere used a limited number of props and costumes. Black and white photographs were displayed behind Smith as she moved from one monologue and character to the next. She slightly changed her appearance and mannerisms for each character. Throughout most of her performance, she was dressed in black pants and white shirt, and was barefoot.\n\nMany of the monologues are accompanied by music, ranging from black hip hop to Jewish religious chants. The music is meant to pair with the author's background or the essence of each monologue.\n\nSmith presented a first workshop production of the play in December 1991 at George Wolfe's Festival of New Voices. \"Fires in the Mirror\" had its world premiere at the New York Shakespeare Festival on May 1, 1992. Its official press opening was on May 12, 1992.\n\n\"Fires in the Mirror\" has also been produced by the American Repertory Theatre in Cambridge, Massachusetts; the McCarter Theatre in Princeton, New Jersey; Brown University, Stanford University, Royal Court Theatre in London, and many others. It was presented as part of the 1994 Melbourne International Arts Festival in Australia at the Victorian Arts Centre (now Arts Centre Melbourne).\n\nA film of the play was adapted under the direction of George C. Wolfe and starred Anna Deavere Smith. Aired in 1993, it was produced by Cherie Fortis and filmed by \"American Playhouse\" for PBS.\n\nIt received the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding One-Person Show in 1993. In 1994, Deavere received the award again, for her \"\", another example of verbatim theatre, based on the riot in Los Angeles following acquittal of four white policemen of the LAPD who were taped beating Rodney King, an African American, after a traffic stop.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1878081", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1878081", "title": "Endace", "text": "Endace\n\nEndace Ltd is a privately owned network monitoring company, based in New Zealand and founded in 2001. It provides network visibility and network recording products to large organizations. The company was listed on the London Stock Exchange in 2005 and then delisted in 2013 when it was acquired by Emulex. In 2016 Endace was spun out of Emulex and is currently a private company.\n\nIn October 2016, \"The Intercept\" revealed that some Endace clients were intelligence agencies, including the British GCHQ (known for conducting massive surveillance on network communications) and the Moroccan DGST, likewise known for mass surveillance of its citizens.\n\nEndace was founded after the DAG project at the School of Computing and Mathematical Sciences at the University of Waikato in New Zealand. The first cards designed at the University were intended to measure latency in ATM networks.\n\nIn 2006, Endace transitioned from component manufacturer to appliance manufacturer to managed infrastructure provider. The company now sells network visibility fabrics, based on its range of network recorders, to large corporations and government agencies.\n\nEndace was the first New Zealand company to list on London's Alternative Investment Market when it floated in mid-June 2005 a move which was not without controversy. Poor share price performance in the early years and a seeming failure to attract a broad enough shareholder base lent weight to the criticism that Endace should have focused initially on developing its local profile (via NZX) rather than pushing for overseas investment (via London AIM).\n\nEndace is headquartered in Auckland, New Zealand, and has an R&D centre in Hamilton, New Zealand, and offices in Australia, United States and Great Britain.\n\nThe DAG project grew from academic research at Waikato University. Having found that software measurements of ATM cells (or packets) were unsatisfactory, both for reasons of accuracy and lack of certainty about packet loss, the research group set about developing their own hardware to generate better quality recordings. This hardware and its subsequent iterations introduced two fundamental innovations: hardware timestamping and hardware accounting for packet loss.\n\nConventionally, each packet or cell is given a timestamp by the host machine's kernel (i.e. in software) when the kernel driver is notified that a new packet has arrived. This approach results in poor quality timestamps for several reasons, among them the considerable latency and jitter between the packet arriving at the network interface and receipt by the kernel driver and uncertainty caused by interrupt coalescing wherein one host interrupt signifies the arrival of several packets. Such poor quality limits what research can usefully be done on network performance and related fields.\n\nTo solve this, the DAG generates timestamps in the hardware as close to the network interface as possible. Not only does this obviate latency, jitter and problems caused by interrupt coalescing, the hardware is capable of much greater accuracy and precision than software-generated timestamps. Precision comes from the freedom of custom hardware to assign as many bits to the timestamp as required and accuracy is assured by reference to an external time source such as GPS which is accurate to ± 40 nanoseconds. In contrast, the accuracy of NTP (by which kernel clocks can be corrected over the Internet) is in the order of milliseconds (about 100,000 times less accurate), depending on the conditions involved.\n\nThe DAG produces 64 bit timestamps in fixed-point format with 32 fractional bits, giving a potential precision of formula_1 seconds or 233 picoseconds. The actual precision offered varies with the particular model of DAG, the oldest giving 24 fractional bits (60 nanoseconds) and better precisions offered in DAGs for higher bandwidth networks.\n\nThe timestamp is derived from a free-running clock provided by a crystal oscillator but the accuracy of crystals drift with both temperature and age. The DAG's solution is to use direct digital synthesis using the 1 Hz pulse-per-second output that many GPS receivers provide as its reference clock. This mechanism is described in §5.5.3 of Stephen Donnelly's PhD thesis which also describes in detail the pre-commercial era models of DAG.\n\nCrucially, and an academically significant contribution of the DAG, the ability to use an external reference such as globally synchronised GPS makes it possible to do one-way time-of-flight measurements. This is of immense interest to academic researchers because packets flowing between two points on the Internet are neither guaranteed to follow the same path in each direction nor guaranteed to have the same timing characteristics in each direction.\n\nOutside of the academic world, timestamp accuracy has commercial applications in the enforcement and compliance with law such as the EU Markets in Financial Instruments Directive 2004.\n\nAlmost as important as timestamp accuracy is guaranteeing 100% cell or packet capture and, where loss is unavoidable, knowing not only \"that\" packets have been lost but \"where\". The \"where\" is important because, when analysing a packet trace, it's important to be able to compensate for lost packets when calculating inter-arrival times.\n\nMost commercial NICs keep a count of dropped packets, but they can't indicate where packets were lost. The DAG prepends a header which, amongst other things, indicates how many packets were dropped between that packet and the previously accepted packet.\n\nThe DAG is also engineered to deliver recorded packets to the host with the greatest possible efficiency. That, together with the interstitial loss counter, is what makes the DAG so appealing for surveillance applications. The interstitial loss counter also finds application in forensics; a prosecutor needs to be able to prove that the record is complete or, if it is not, where it is not.\n\nIn October 2016, The Intercept published an article showing that Endace customers include intelligence agencies, including the GCHQ, Canadian and Australian intelligence agencies, and the DGST (Morocco’s domestic surveillance agency). Edward Snowden documents have shown that the GCHQ has installed massive surveillance of network communications in UK, using the over-sea cable between Europe and North America.\n\nIn March 2020, Endace received awards for \"Most Innovative\", \"Best Product\" and \"Hot Company\" categories at the \"Cyber Defense Magazine InfoSec Awards\".\n\nAlso in March 2020, Endace was awarded the \"Grand Trophy Winner\" for winning several categories in the \"Info Security Products Guide Global Excellence Awards\". The company was awarded the Gold award for \"Best Security Hardware\", \"Most Innovative Security Hardware of the Year\", \"Network Security and Management\", and \"Critical Infrastructure Security\" categories as well as the Silver award for \"Best Security Solution\" and \"Network Visibility, Security & Testing\" categories.\n\n"}

He was signed by Bolton Wanderers from Dudley Town in 1969 and spent nine years at Bolton, helping the club to win the Second Division title in 1977–78. He spent the 1980s as a journeyman player, spending time with Sunderland, Millwall, Tampa Bay Rowdies, Coventry City, Huddersfield Town, Bolton Wanderers (for a second spell), Preston North End, and West Bromwich Albion (also working as assistant manager). During this time he helped Preston to win promotion out of the Fourth Division in 1986–87.\n\nMoving into management, he took charge of Irish club Limerick in 1991, leading the club to the League of Ireland First Division (second tier) title in 1991–92. He returned to England to coach at Preston North End, also serving briefly as caretaker-manager. He took up his first permanent management role in England at Blackpool in July 1994, but was sacked after two years having narrowly failed to achieve promotion. He spent January 1997 to October 1999 in charge at Notts County, taking them to the Third Division title in 1997–98. He then returned to Bolton Wanderers as manager, leading the club to promotion out of the First Division via the play-offs in 2001, as well as a League Cup final and UEFA Cup qualification. Following a spell at Newcastle United from May 2007 to January 2008, Allardyce managed Blackburn Rovers for a two-year spell from December 2008. He was appointed West Ham United manager in June 2011, leading the club to promotion out of the Championship via the play-offs in 2012, before leaving West Ham in May 2015 after criticism from fans over his playing style. He was appointed Sunderland manager in October 2015 and saved the club from relegation. He was appointed as manager of the English national team for a brief spell in July 2016, before taking charge at Crystal Palace five months later. After helping Palace to avoid relegation that season, he announced his resignation in May 2017. He took charge at Everton in November 2017 and remained in charge for a six-month period.\n\nAllardyce has been labelled a long ball manager by some analysts, though he has disputed this perception as \"totally and utterly wrong\". He takes a modern, technology and statistics centred approach to tactics and coaching, and has been praised for his organisational and man-management skills.\n\nAllardyce has been criticised for alleged corruption and has twice been the subject of undercover investigations. In September 2006, he and his son, Craig, were implicated in a BBC \"Panorama\" documentary for taking bribes, allegations which they denied. In September 2016, undercover \"Daily Telegraph\" reporters posing as businessmen recorded him offering to help them to get around FA third party ownership rules and provisionally agreeing a £400,000 contract. Following the \"Daily Telegraph\" investigation, Allardyce resigned as England manager in a mutual agreement with the Football Association on 27 September.\n\nSamuel Allardyce was born in October 1954 on the Old Park Farm Estate, Dudley, the son of Robert Allardyce (1916–1989) and Mary Agnes Allardyce (1918–1991). His father was a police sergeant. Both parents originated from Scotland with his father from Nairn and his mother from Dumfries. He has an older sister, Mary, born in Scotland in 1939 and an older brother, Robert junior, born in 1951. Allardyce was educated at Sycamore Green Primary School and later at Mons Hill School, having been unsuccessful in his Eleven-plus exam. He discovered in later life that he suffers from dyslexia. As a child, he supported Wolverhampton Wanderers and dreamed that one day he would play at and manage the club.\n\nAllardyce spent his youth with semi-professional side Dudley Town, making his debut at the age of 14 he quickly learned how to play centre-half in the highly physical West Midlands (Regional) League. He trained with local Football League clubs West Bromwich Albion and Wolverhampton Wanderers, and had an unsuccessful trial with Aston Villa. He was spotted by Bolton Wanderers just before leaving school at the age of 15, and signed an apprenticeship with the club. To supplement his income before officially starting his apprenticeship he worked in a factory producing record decks. The Bolton under-18s were very successful, winning the Lancashire Youth Cup and reaching the quarter-finals of the FA Youth Cup, and Allardyce quickly rose through the B-team into the A-team. He signed his first professional contract on his 17th birthday, receiving a £125 signing on fee and wages of £14 a week.\n\nManager Jimmy Armfield gave Allardyce his debut for the \"Trotters\" on 6 November 1973, in a 2–1 defeat League Cup to Millwall at Burnden Park. He made his Second Division debut eleven days later, in a 2–1 defeat to Notts County. However he failed to establish himself in the first team under Armfield, and only got a run of games under new manager Ian Greaves, who played Allardyce in the last ten games of the 1974–75 season after he sold Don McAllister to Tottenham Hotspur. He impressed during this short run, winning himself the club's Young Player of the Year award.\n\nBolton lost to Newcastle United after two replays in the FA Cup Fifth Round in the 1975–76 season, and went on to miss out on promotion out of the league by a single point. They suffered similar disappointment in the 1976–77 campaign, reaching the semi-finals of the League Cup, and again finished just one point outside the promotion places. Allardyce played alongside Paul Jones at centre-half, and a scouting report for England manager Don Revie in 1977 described Allardyce and Jones as \"one of the best central defensive pairings in the Football League.\" Despite this, however, he was never called up to the England team. Promotion was finally achieved in the 1977–78 season, as Bolton returned to the First Division as champions of the Second Division. Bolton consolidated their top-flight status with a 17th-place finish in 1978–79. However the 1979–80 season proved difficult, and manager Greaves was sacked as the club went seven months without a league victory, whilst his replacement Stan Anderson was unable to steer the club away from relegation and a last-place finish. Allardyce decided to leave Bolton at the end of the season as he felt that he was underpaid at Bolton and did not get on with Anderson.\n\nAllardyce was offered a contract by Norwich City manager John Bond, but the offer was bettered by Colin Addison at Derby County, and he verbally agreed a three-year contract with Derby. However, before signing the contract he received a late offer from Ken Knighton to play for Sunderland on a £300 a week contract with a £20,000 signing on fee – which more than quadrupled his wage at Bolton. Allardyce signed for Sunderland on 1 July 1980 for £150,000. Knighton appointed him as club captain. However Allardyce soon wearied of the long-distance travel from Sunderland to his home in Bolton, and put in a transfer request when chairman Tom Cowie refused to help finance the purchase of a home in Sunderland. Cowie sacked Knighton late in the 1980–81 season, leaving caretaker manager Mick Docherty in charge to steer the club out of the First Division relegation zone. New manager Alan Durban left Allardyce out of the team at the start of the 1981–82 campaign, leaving Allardyce's departure from Roker Park inevitable.\n\nHe was offered the chance to return to Bolton Wanderers, but manager George Mulhall was only able to offer 50% of Allardyce's wages at Sunderland. Instead he made a surprise £95,000 move to Third Division side Millwall, who were able to match Sunderland's wages and also pay out a £30,000 signing on fee and a £10,000 loyalty bonus. Millwall player-manager Peter Anderson had seen Allardyce as the successor to long-serving central defender Barry Kitchener, and as Anderson was also a property developer he allowed Allardyce to live rent free in a six-bedroom mansion. The \"Lions\" ended the 1981–82 season in mid-table, and Anderson was sacked in November 1982. Chairman Alan Thorne offered Allardyce the vacant management position, but Allardyce rejected the offer as he felt that at aged 28 he was far too young to enter management. Instead it was George Graham who took up his first management position, and Graham immediately froze Allardyce out of the first team on both matchdays and training after Allardyce insisted that he would not report teammates who broke Graham's rules. He came close to joining Charlton Athletic on a free transfer in March 1983, but Charlton boss Lennie Lawrence did not complete the move before the end of the transfer deadline. Graham agreed to pay Allardyce £15,000 to cancel his contract, acting under the assumption that Allardyce would struggle to find a club willing to offer him £300 a week.\n\nAllardyce wrote to every club in the top two divisions to inform them he was available on a free transfer, and privately lamented choosing his past clubs for financial rather than footballing reasons. Over the summer he played 11 games in the North American Soccer League for the Tampa Bay Rowdies, a club that shared facilities with the NFL's Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Allardyce subsequently applied in his managerial career many modern practices of American football with regards to training, player management and tactics. He found playing difficult however, due to the heat and the all-out attacking nature of his teammates, which led to him being frequently exposed at the back, though he found that the club's masseurs managed to cure a long-standing hamstring scar tissue problem.\n\nUpon returning to the UK he joined Bobby Gould's First Division Coventry City on a one-year £300 a week contract. He was made captain, and though Coventry enjoyed a good first half to the 1983–84 season they faltered badly in the second half of the season and finished just one place and two points above the relegation zone after beating Norwich City on the final day of the season. Midway through the campaign Gould had promised him a new two-year contract, but following the poor end to the season he instead opted to release Allardyce.\n\nIn July 1984, he was signed by Mick Buxton at Second Division Huddersfield Town. The move reunited him with Paul Jones, his former centre-half partner at Bolton. Huddersfield finished in 13th place in the 1984–85 season, and at the end of the campaign accepted an offer of £15,000 from Bolton Wanderers, who offered Allardyce a three-year contract. Bolton were then managed by Charlie Wright, who was the goalkeeper at Allardyce's first spell with the club. However Wright was sacked in December 1985, and his successor, Phil Neal, did not get along with Allardyce. Neal played himself at centre-half and relegated Allardyce to the bench, despite Neal being a full-back. Bolton reached the 1986 Associate Members' Cup Final at Wembley Stadium, which ended in a 3–0 defeat to Bristol City, with Allardyce as an unused substitute.\n\nAllardyce was offered the chance to join Tranmere Rovers, but instead joined Preston North End after being persuaded by manager John McGrath, who promised to make Allardyce the backbone of his team. Preston won promotion out of the Fourth Division in second-place in 1986–87 (Allardyce was also named on the PFA Team of the Year), and consolidated their Third Division status with a 16th-place finish in 1987–88. By this time Allardyce began considering his retirement as a player, and applied to management positions at York City and Notts County, and had an unsuccessful interview with Doncaster Rovers.\n\nBolton fans gave him the nickname \"Super Sam Bionic Man\" due to his tough tackling approach and the way he quickly got up after heavy collisions whilst the opposition player would be left flat on the ground. Veteran manager Dave Bassett, a friend of Allardyce, once humorously remarked that \"He was what I called a ball-playing defender... If he wasn't playing with the ball he was playing with your balls.\" He was uncomfortable in possession, and played simple balls to his nearest teammates when he found himself with the ball, whilst teammates would be reluctant to pass to him. He did however possess good awareness and heading skills, and his anticipation made up for his lack of pace.\n\nAllardyce was hired as a player-coach by Brian Talbot at West Bromwich Albion in February 1989. He spent most of the rest of the 1988–89 season at The Hawthorns managing and playing for the reserve team, before being promoted to first team coach in the summer, in a move that saw former first team coach Stuart Pearson demoted to reserve team coaching. Allardyce and Talbot were sacked in January 1991 following a defeat to Isthmian League side Woking in the FA Cup. He later worked as a part-time coach at Bury, but manager Mike Walsh could not afford to keep him on the staff for the 1989–90 season.\n\nAllardyce then took up the role of player-manager of Limerick, and guided the team to promotion into the League of Ireland Premier Division after winning the 1991–92 League of Ireland First Division. They achieved promotion despite tremendous financial pressures, with Allardyce coaching and playing for the first team whilst the club board signed players as Allardyce had no knowledge of the Irish football scene.\n\nAfter his season in Ireland, Allardyce returned to England for the start of the 1992–93 season to coach at Preston North End under Les Chapman. Ten games into the season, however, Chapman was sacked and Allardyce was appointed caretaker manager. Despite a promising spell in charge, Allardyce did not get the job on a permanent basis, and in December 1992 Preston appointed John Beck as manager. Allardyce worked as youth team coach for 18 months, but later said the extreme long ball tactics Beck enforced upon the club were \"indefensible\".\n\nOn 19 July 1994 Blackpool, West Lancashire derby rivals to Preston North End, appointed Allardyce as their new manager following the departure of Billy Ayre, agreeing a salary of £18,000 a year. He signed defender Darren Bradshaw, midfielder Micky Mellon and spent a club record £245,000 on Andy Morrison, who Allardyce described as a \"horrible in-your-face\" centre-back and a \"complete nutter\". He also changed the club's backroom staff, hiring Bobby Saxton as his assistant, promoting player Phil Brown to a coaching role, and appointing Mark Taylor as physio, who would follow Allardyce to Blackburn and Newcastle. Blackpool finished the 1994–95 season in 12th place after falling out of the promotion race with just one win in their final 11 games.\n\nHe spent £200,000 on striker Andy Preece, and also brought in young defender Jason Lydiate and goalkeeper Steve Banks for the 1995–96 campaign. Blackpool finished third, missing out on automatic promotion on the last day of the season, and were beaten in the play-off semi-finals by Bradford City. They had won 2–0 away at Valley Parade, only to lose 3–0 in the return leg at Bloomfield Road. Chairman Owen Oyston, while he was in a prison cell, sacked Allardyce shortly after the play-off defeat. Allardyce then had a brief spell on the coaching staff under Peter Reid at Sunderland, working as director of the academy.\n\nIn January 1997, Allardyce made his return to football as manager of struggling Division Two club Notts County. He arrived too late to save them from relegation in 1996–97, and in his autobiography described how the players \"would not respond\" to his coaching methods as they went 18 games without a win and pressure mounted on Allardyce. However he held on to his job, and led the club to promotion as champions of Division Three at the end of the 1997–98 season, built upon a three-man defence and a mid-season run of ten consecutive wins. County broke several club and national records, winning the title by a 19-point margin and becoming the first post-war side to win promotion in March.\n\nDespite the success, chairman Derek Pavis refused to spend money on transfers, and as a result fell out with Allardyce. Allardyce was eventually allowed to spend £50,000 on striker Kevin Rapley, who helped the club to steer clear of relegation at the end of the 1998–99 campaign. In the summer he signed midfielder Craig Ramage and utility player Clayton Blackmore. Allardyce remained in charge at Meadow Lane until 14 October 1999, when he resigned his post at Notts County to return to Bolton Wanderers.\n\nAllardyce was appointed manager of Bolton Wanderers following Colin Todd's departure, who had resigned in protest at the sale of Per Frandsen as the club attempted to raise funds for the new Reebok Stadium. He inherited a talented squad, which included Eiður Guðjohnsen, Jussi Jääskeläinen, Mark Fish, Claus Jensen, Dean Holdsworth, Bo Hansen, Michael Johansen, and Ricardo Gardner. However he was forced to sell Andy Todd, son of Colin Todd, after he broke assistant manager Phil Brown's jaw in a team bonding session. Despite being in the bottom half of the table when he took over, Bolton reached the 1999–2000 Division One play-offs, losing to Ipswich Town, and had an eventful run to the League Cup and FA Cup semi-finals, only missing out on the 2000 FA Cup Final after a penalty shoot-out defeat to Aston Villa. He blamed referee Barry Knight for the play-off defeat, who he accused of being biased against Bolton. Allardyce was rewarded for turning the club around with a ten-year contract, though the terms of the contract only entitled him to a one year's compensation pay if he was sacked.\n\nIn summer 2000, Guðjohnsen and Jensen were sold for £4 million each. Allardyce focused on spending money to improve the club's facilities and backroom staff, believing that money spent in these areas would allow Bolton to compete with clubs who had bigger budgets and paid bigger wages than Bolton could afford. On the playing front he spent £400,000 on striker Michael Ricketts and £1.5 million to bring back Frendsen from Blackburn, and also signed utility player Ian Marshall and Bradford City loanee Isaiah Rankin. Teenager Kevin Nolan was also promoted from the youth team, whilst 35-year-old defender Colin Hendry arrived on loan. Bolton reached the play-off final at the Millennium Stadium in 2000–01, where they beat Preston North End 3–0 to achieve promotion to the Premier League after a three-year absence.\n\nBuilding for the 2001–02 Premier League campaign, Allardyce signed France international defender Bruno N'Gotty from Marseille in a loan deal which was eventual made into a permanent one after N'Gotty established himself as a key first team player. He also brought in Henrik Pedersen from Silkeborg IF for £650,000, though otherwise remained loyal to the players that had won promotion the previous campaign. They recorded a 5–0 win at Leicester City on the opening day, then beat Middlesbrough and Liverpool to secure nine points from their first three games. After six games without a win, Bolton then recorded a shock 2–1 victory over Manchester United on 20 October. However their form dropped, and so in the January transfer window Allardyce brought in Danish midfielder Stig Tøfting, German striker Fredi Bobic (on loan), and World Cup-winning attacker Youri Djorkaeff. Djorkaeff scored both goals in a 2–1 win over Charlton Athletic on 23 March and Bobic scored a hat-trick in a 4–1 win over Ipswich Town on 6 April; the victory over Ipswich proved to be essential as Bolton ended the season in 16th place on 40 points, ahead of Ipswich who were relegated with 36 points.\n\nAllardyce manage to sign another big name on a free transfer for the 2002–03 season, bringing in 28-year-old Nigeria captain Jay-Jay Okocha, who four years previously had been purchased by Paris Saint-Germain for £14 million. He also brought in Spanish central defender Iván Campo on loan from Real Madrid. He sold 2001–02 top-scorer Michael Ricketts to Middlesbrough for £3.5 million, bringing in Pierre-Yves André on loan as his replacement. Bolton struggled all season, but managed to avoid relegation with a final day win over Middlesbrough.\n\nLooking to avoid another relegation battle, Allardyce made a number of signings in preparation for the 2003–04 season, the most significant of which were Brazilian defender Emerson Thome, Greece international Stelios Giannakopoulos, and target-man striker Kevin Davies. Allardyce's side finished eighth in the league and reached the League Cup final, in what was his first major domestic final appearance as a player or manager. Bolton lost 2–1 to Middlesbrough in the final, though Allardyce blamed referee Mike Riley for not giving a late penalty for an alleged handball by Ugo Ehiogu.\n\nNow an established Premier League club, Bolton signed veteran internationals Gary Speed and Fernando Hierro, aged 35 and 36 respectively. Speed and Hierro went into midfield, while Tunisia international Radhi Jaïdi was played at centre-back after arriving on a free transfer from Espérance; he was played alongside another new arrival, Israel defender Tal Ben Haim, who was recommended by Allardyce's son Craig. He also brought in Senegal striker El Hadji Diouf on a season-long loan from Liverpool, who he would eventually sign permanently for £3 million. After a good start to the season, Allardyce was offered the Newcastle United job, but turned it down and instead signed a new five-year contract with Bolton as he felt the Bolton squad to be more talented. Bolton went on to finish in sixth place in 2004–05 to win qualification to the UEFA Cup for the first time in the club's history.\n\nBolton reached the Round of 32 in the UEFA Cup in 2005–06, beating Lokomotiv Plovdiv (Bulgaria) in the First Round and successfully negotiating through the Group stage after beating Zenit Saint Petersburg (Russia), and drawing with Sevilla (Spain), Beşiktaş (Turkey) and Vitória Guimarães (Portugal), before losing to Marseille (France) in the knock-out stages. Allardyce's success with Bolton resulted in the FA putting him on a short-list of four people to succeed Sven-Göran Eriksson as England manager after the 2006 FIFA World Cup, alongside Alan Curbishley, Steve McClaren and Martin O'Neill. He was interviewed for the position and was told by FA Chief Executive Brian Barwick that the final choice would be between him and McClaren, however the FA eventually decided to give the job to McClaren. Allardyce was also again offered the Newcastle job and was this time to keen to take it, but Newcastle chairman Freddie Shepard broke off contract negotiations after electing to appoint caretaker-manager Glenn Roeder on a full-time basis. Allardyce's team seemed unaffected by speculation on his future or by their European exploits, and ended the season in eighth position.\n\nKeen to strengthen Bolton for a European push in the 2006–07 season, Allardyce signed France international striker Nicolas Anelka from Fenerbahçe for a club record £8 million. He also signed Ivory Coast defender Abdoulaye Méïté from Marseille, and in an unusual sequence of events made a £400,000 profit on Dietmar Hamann, who changed his mind about joining Bolton and signed with Manchester City a day after signing a pre-contract agreement with Bolton; Manchester City agreed to pay Bolton £400,000 in compensation. However Allardyce's relationship with chairman Phil Gartside became increasingly strained as Gartside refused to sanction greater transfer spending to finance a push for UEFA Champions League qualification. On 29 April 2007, Allardyce resigned with the club in fifth place with two games of the season left to play, and the following day his assistant Sammy Lee was announced as his replacement.\n\nAllardyce was offered the Manchester City job, but the offer was withdrawn after Thaksin Shinawatra's purchase offer of the club was accepted. On 15 May 2007, Newcastle United announced that Allardyce had signed a three-year contract to succeed Glenn Roeder as manager. Coincidentally Newcastle then also had a change of owners, as Mike Ashley completed his takeover of the club. The sales of Scott Parker and Kieron Dyer raised £13 million, allowing Allardyce to sign Australia international striker Mark Viduka (free transfer), utility man Alan Smith (£6 million), midfielder Geremi Njitap, controversial midfielder Joey Barton (£5.5 million), left-back José Enrique (£6.3 million), right-back Habib Beye (£2 million), and defender Abdoulaye Faye. Newcastle enjoyed a good start to the season, beating Allardyce's former club Bolton 3–1 on the opening day in a run of five wins and two draws from the opening nine league games. However they then had a series of disappointing results in the run-up to Christmas, and after gaining only one point from a possible six from bottom-of-the-table Wigan and Derby. Allardyce parted company with Newcastle United on 9 January 2008. He had gone into the meeting with chairman Chris Mort expecting to be told Newcastle had signed a new player, not expecting that Ashley and Mort had decided to instead sign Kevin Keegan to return as manager.\n\nOn 17 December 2008, Allardyce was appointed as manager of Blackburn Rovers on a three-year contract, succeeding Paul Ince who left the club in 19th place with just three wins from 17 games. Allardyce's first game in charge was a 3–0 victory over Stoke City at Ewood Park three days later. This was the first game of a nine-game unbeaten run. He strengthened the team by spending £2 million on Sunderland winger El Hadji Diouf and brought in defender Gaël Givet on loan from Marseille. Allardyce finished his first season in charge with a 0–0 draw with West Bromwich Albion and a final league position of 15th.\n\nBlackburn were forced to sell talismanic Paraguay striker Roque Santa Cruz to Manchester City and defender Stephen Warnock to Aston Villa for a combined £21.5 million to balance the books. Allardyce was permitted to bring in defensive midfielder Steven Nzonzi from Amiens for £500,000, Croatia international forward Nikola Kalinić from Hajduk Split for £6 million, and Pascal Chimbonda from Tottenham Hotspur for £2.5 million. In the 2009–10 season, Blackburn reached the League Cup semi-final against Aston Villa, but lost over two legs. Blackburn remained mid-table for the duration of the season, and finished tenth with a final day victory away at Aston Villa.\n\nThe club was put up for sale in summer 2010, and Allardyce was offered the job of managing Shabab Al-Ahli Dubai, but could not secure permission to leave Blackburn without paying compensation to the club and so remained in charge at Ewood Park. Allardyce was later sacked by new owners the Venky's on 13 December 2010, with Rovers placed 13th in the league. He was replaced by one of his coaches, Steve Kean, whose agent Jerome Anderson was a highly influential figure with the Venky family.\n\nAllardyce was appointed as manager of then-recently relegated West Ham United on 1 June 2011, signing a two-year contract. He vowed to play \"attractive football\" in getting West Ham back to the Premier League, according to the \"traditions of the club,\" and rejected the claims that he played dull, long-ball football at previous clubs. He signed Abdoulaye Faye, Kevin Nolan, Joey O'Brien and Matt Taylor. Faye, Nolan and O'Brien had all played under Allardyce at his former club Bolton Wanderers while Taylor was a Bolton player who had joined after Allardyce left the club. He made striker John Carew West Ham's fifth signing of the season, on a free transfer, followed by defender George McCartney from Sunderland on a season-long loan, strikers Sam Baldock from Milton Keynes Dons and midfielder Papa Bouba Diop on a free transfer. He concluded his summer transfer window signings on deadline day by bringing in midfielders David Bentley from Tottenham Hotspur and Henri Lansbury from Arsenal, both on season-long loans, as well as utility man Guy Demel from Hamburg for an undisclosed fee. Nicky Maynard, Ricardo Vaz Tê and Ravel Morrison followed in the 2011 winter transfer window. Over the course of the 2011–12 season a total of 25 players left the club while 19 were signed. In March 2012, despite standing in third place in the Championship, Allardyce's style of football was again questioned. Fans called for more passing of the ball and football played on the pitch and not in the air. On 19 May 2012, West Ham were promoted back to the Premier League after only one season in the Championship after beating Blackpool 2–1 the play-off Final. Allardyce described this promotion as his best ever achievement.\n\nA busy transfer window for the summer of 2012 saw Allardyce bring in eleven players, including his former Bolton goalkeeper Jussi Jääskeläinen, midfielder Mohamed Diamé, Mali international striker Modibo Maïga, Wales international centre-back James Collins, defensive midfielder Alou Diarra, winger Matt Jarvis, England striker Andy Carroll (on loan from Liverpool) and Israel international midfielder Yossi Benayoun. West Ham finished the 2012–13 season in tenth place, and Allardyce renewed his contract at West Ham by signing a new two-year deal.\n\nAllardyce's main signing of summer 2013 was Andy Carroll, for a £15 million fee from Liverpool, whilst he also spent an undisclosed fee on winger Stewart Downing, again from Liverpool, to provide crosses for Carroll to convert into goals. He also signed goalkeeper Adrián on a free transfer from Real Betis. However Allardyce's plans were disrupted when Carroll picked up a long-term injury, which left Allardyce regretting the transfer, especially as he had chosen Carroll instead of signing Swansea City's Wilfried Bony, who went on to score 16 league goals in the 2013–14 campaign. Allardyce was awarded the Premier League Manager of the Month for February 2014 following a run of four wins and one draw in their five Premier League games. In April 2014, during an away game against West Bromwich Albion, a section of West Ham fans expressed their distaste at the style of football played under Allardyce by displaying a banner which read \"Fat Sam Out, killing WHU\". The following month some supporters hung a banner bearing the legend \"Fat Sam Out\" outside the mansion owned by club chairman, David Sullivan, in Theydon Bois, Essex. Despite protests, on 20 May 2014, the club announced that Allardyce would be staying as manager and would be supported by new attacking coach Teddy Sheringham for the 2014–15 season to \"ensure the team provides more entertainment\" and to \"improve the club's goal tally\".\n\nIn summer 2014, Allardyce signed midfielder Cheikhou Kouyaté, left-back Aaron Cresswell, attacker Enner Valencia, right-back (on loan from Arsenal) Carl Jenkinson, striker Diafra Sakho, defensive midfielder Alex Song (on loan from Barcelona), midfielder Morgan Amalfitano, and forward Mauro Zárate. In October 2014, pundits like BBC's Robbie Savage were commenting about the team's \"more attractive and attacking playing style\" or \"the statistics [that] show the progress that West Ham have made in the last few months.\" Allardyce was awarded the Premier League Manager of the Month for October 2014 after three wins for West Ham out of four games played that month. Allardyce left West Ham on 24 May 2015, the final day of the season, after his contract was not renewed. Allardyce stated that \"I didn't want to stay. I suppose you could say it was mutual if they didn't want me to stay either\". His West Ham side had finished 12th in the 2014–15 season, one place higher than in the 2013–14 season.\n\nOn 9 October 2015, Allardyce was named the new Sunderland manager, replacing Dick Advocaat. When Allardyce was appointed, Sunderland sat 19th in the Premier League table with three points from their first eight games of the season. Signing a two-year contract, he became the first manager to have managed both Newcastle United and Sunderland. On 25 October, in his second game as manager, he guided Sunderland to a 3–0 win against rivals and his former club Newcastle United. However, after a run of 5 defeats in a row in December, Sunderland headed into the second half of the season in the relegation zone with only 12 points from 19 games.\n\nIn the January transfer window he signed centre-backs Lamine Koné and Jan Kirchhoff and attacking midfielder Wahbi Khazri. On 6 February 2016, Sunderland scored two late goals to draw 2–2 with Liverpool at Anfield, having trailed 2–0 with ten minutes remaining. Later that week winger Adam Johnson was sacked by the club after pleading guilty to one count of sexual activity with a child and one charge of grooming. Sunderland remained in the relegation zone for much of the remainder of the 2015–16 season, before they boosted their survival chances by beating Norwich City 3–0 at Carrow Road on 16 April, closing the gap on 17th-place Norwich to just one point. Allardyce successfully led Sunderland to safety from relegation after beating Everton 3–0 on 11 May, a result which also ensured the relegation of rivals (and one of his former clubs) Newcastle United. Allardyce earned praise for his management of Sunderland from some pundits, particularly for his organized approach and emphasis on a strong defence.\n\nOn 22 July 2016, Allardyce signed a two-year contract to become manager of the England national team. He won his first and only game in charge on 4 September, as an Adam Lallana goal deep into injury-time was enough to beat Slovakia on the opening day of qualification for the 2018 FIFA World Cup. Following allegations of malpractice, Allardyce left the role by mutual consent on 27 September, having managed the team for just 67 days and one match.\n\nOn 23 December 2016, Allardyce signed a two-and-a-half-year contract to become manager of Crystal Palace, a day after the sacking of Alan Pardew. He strengthened in the January transfer window by spending around £30 million on Jeffrey Schlupp, Patrick van Aanholt, and Luka Milivojević. The \"Eagles\" confirmed their safety from relegation in the penultimate game of the 2016–17 season with a 4–0 victory over Hull City at Selhurst Park. Allardyce announced his departure from Crystal Palace on 23 May 2017, saying he had no intention of seeking another job, in what was interpreted as a retirement announcement. However, on 19 July 2017, Allardyce said he would be open to an international management position, but not another club job.\n\nDespite previously announcing his retirement from his managerial career, on 30 November 2017, Allardyce signed a contract to manage Everton until June 2019, who were thirteenth place in the Premier League table, following a poor start to the 2017–18 season. His first game in charge came two days later, when his side defeated Huddersfield Town in a 2–0 victory. He guided the \"Toffees\" to a seven-game unbeaten run at the start of his tenure, a spell which included five clean sheets. Having steadied the defence, he stated that his next task was to bring in a consistent goalscorer. Everton ended the season in eighth-position, but fans were dissatisfied with the style of play. Whilst under Allardyce's management, Everton were ranked 20th for total shots, 19th for total shots on target, 16th for passing accuracy and 17th for shots faced in the Premier League. Allardyce left the club on 16 May 2018.\n\nDespite having been out of football management for a full season, in July 2019 Allardyce had the opportunity to return to Newcastle United as their manager, but he turned it down.\n\nAllardyce is a keen proponent of sports science and using technology and innovative techniques in coaching his teams, such as computerised performance analysis and yoga. Martin Hardy of \"The Independent\" described him as \"one of the pioneers of sports science in English football\". Former players and pundits have cited his preparation as his main strength, which allows his teams to have better organisation and defensive stability. Former Bolton player Kevin Davies also highlighted Allardyce's man-management skills as a strength.\n\nAllardyce also has a reputation for using long ball tactics, though he has said that this perception is \"totally and utterly wrong\". Former Newcastle player Lee Clark defended Allardyce from criticism of his tactics and said that Allardyce was right to work hard on set-plays and on the organisation of his team.\n\nCriticism of his perceived long-ball tactics became more intense as he managed West Ham United in the Premier League, including discontent from West Ham's own supporters. In January 2014, following a 0–0 draw at Stamford Bridge, Chelsea manager, José Mourinho criticised West Ham's football, likening it to \"football from the 19th century\". In October 2014, Allardyce claimed his reputation for playing long ball football was \"not founded in fact\" and had been used as an excuse by opposing managers such as Arsène Wenger, David O'Leary, Graeme Souness and Rafael Benítez following defeats by sides managed by Allardyce. Allardyce wrote in his autobiography that \"when they hit a 50-yard ball it was a cultural pass; when we did it, it was a hopeful hoof\".\n\nHe met his wife Lynne Ward while still a youth team player at Bolton Wanderers, and the pair married on 1 June 1974. They had a son, Craig (9 June 1975), and daughter, Rachael (21 April 1979). He was given an honorary doctorate by the University of Bolton in July 2010. In addition to his football career, Allardyce has also run a number of businesses, including a motor spares firm, a fast-food restaurant, a social club, a pub, a piano bar, and a pub restaurant. He published his autobiography, \"Big Sam\", in October 2015.\n\nIn January 2013, Allardyce received \"substantial\", but undisclosed, damages from former Blackburn Rovers manager Steve Kean. In 2011, Kean had been recorded in a bar in Hong Kong alleging that Allardyce had been sacked from his post at Blackburn Rovers because he was a \"crook\".\n\nIn May 2019, Allardyce's grandson, also named Sam, signed for Oxford United having previously been a youth team player with Manchester United and Bury.\n\nOn 19 September 2006, Allardyce, and his son, Craig, were implicated in a BBC \"Panorama\" documentary, \"Undercover: Football's Dirty Secrets\", which alleged that he had taken bribes from agents for signing certain players. Two agents, Teni Yerima and Peter Harrison, were secretly filmed, each separately claiming that they had paid Allardyce through his son. Allardyce denied ever taking, or asking for, a bribe. Others implicated of wrongdoing were Harry Redknapp, Kevin Bond, and Frank Arnesen. As a result of the allegation, Allardyce refused to speak to the BBC. While he also stated he was going to sue the broadcaster to clear his name, Allardyce failed to issue libel proceedings as he was advised that suing for damage to reputation was a costly and time-consuming process. The final report of the Stevens inquiry published in June 2007 expressed concerns regarding the involvement of Craig Allardyce in a number of transactions, stating that: \"The inquiry remains concerned at the conflict of interest that it believes existed between Craig Allardyce, his father Sam Allardyce—the then manager at Bolton—and the club itself.\" Allardyce stated that the inquiry was a public relations exercise and that the conclusion of a \"conflict of interest\" was \"innuendo, without any facts\".\n\nIn February 2014, Daniel Taylor, chief football writer for \"The Guardian\" and \"The Observer\", wrote that West Ham player and England prospect Ravel Morrison felt he had come \"under considerable pressure\" from Allardyce to sign up with football agent Mark Curtis, who represented Allardyce himself and a number of other West Ham players, including Kevin Nolan, James Tomkins, Jack Collison, Matt Jarvis, Andy Carroll, and Jussi Jääskeläinen. Curtis had been charged and eventually cleared by the Football Association during the 2008 investigation into Luton Town's illegal transfer dealings. Curtis responded to the allegations by saying they were \"nonsense\", while Allardyce talked of Morrison complaining about \"a groin injury\" while the club's medical staff could find \"no problem\", and made a reference to the player's \"disciplinary issues in the past\". Morrison was eventually loaned out to Championship side Queens Park Rangers for the remainder of the 2013–14 season.\n\nIn September 2016, \"Daily Telegraph\" reporters posing as businessmen filmed Allardyce, who had recently been appointed the manager of the England football team, allegedly offering to give advice on how to get around on FA rules on player third party ownership and negotiating a £400,000 deal, subject to FA approval. As a result, he left his job as England manager by mutual agreement with the FA after just one game in charge.\n\nRobert Sullivan, Director of Strategy at the FA, later confirmed to the Commons Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee that Allardyce's comments were \"a factual, correct statement around the laws of the English game and having third-party ownership\"\n\nFollowing a review by City of London Police, Allardyce was cleared of any wrongdoing, with \"The Daily Telegraph\" also clarifying that it \"did not suggest that Allardyce had broken the law\", though he agreed that he had been \"a fool\".\n\nSpeaking to \"The Observer\", Martin Glen, CEO of the FA, said that \"it is a tragedy that we have ended up having to part company with him [Allardyce] over the, the – you know – entrapment\".\n\nSource:\n\nBolton Wanderers\n\nPreston North End\n\nIndividual\n\nLimerick\n\nNotts County\n\nBolton Wanderers\n\nWest Ham United\n\nIndividual\n\nGeneral\n\nSpecific\n"}

This success was the first time a British rider won a major Tour classification, and was unsurpassed as the highest Tour finish for a Briton for over 20 years until Bradley Wiggins was retrospectively placed third in the 2009 Tour de France. York rode the Tour de France eleven times, completing the race eight times.\n\nYork finished second in the 1987 Giro d'Italia and also won the King of the Mountains classification. This was the highest finish by a Briton in the Giro d'Italia until Chris Froome won the 2018 race. As well as the Giro second-place finish, York finished second in two other Grand Tours: the 1985 and 1986 Vuelta a España. The second place at the 1985 Vuelta came after losing the leader's jersey on the penultimate stage, in what is widely thought to have been collusion by the Spanish-speaking teams. Further victories came at the 1985 Volta a Catalunya, the 1989 Tour of Britain and the 1990 Critérium du Dauphiné Libéré.\n\nAfter retiring in 1995, York moved into journalism, as well as spending a year as a coach for British Cycling. She reduced her public commitments in 2000 following hostile stories regarding rumours of her gender transition, and after an appearance as Millar at the 2002 Commonwealth Games left public life altogether. In the 2010s, having transitioned to living as York, she returned to journalism, publishing under the name of Robert Millar until a decision to appear on television commentary and reveal her transition publicly in 2017.\n\nYork was born and raised in Glasgow, Scotland, as Robert Millar. At one time destined for a career as a factory engineer, York attended Shawlands Academy in the south of the city. In 2017, York revealed that she had first felt \"different\" aged five, but was unaware that this difference came from discomfort with her gender.\n\nShe initially began riding for Glenmarnock Wheelers cycling club and quickly established herself as a leading amateur road racing rider. As Robert Millar, she was a relatively small man meaning she had comparatively less weight to carry uphill and she excelled as a specialist hill and mountain cyclist. She won the Scottish junior title in 1976 and was Scottish hill-climb champion the following year. In 1978, York established herself on the British scene. She was twenty-first in the Milk Race, and won the British amateur road race championship. She moved to France in 1979 to join the Athletic Club de Boulogne Billancourt (A.C.B.B.), one of Europe's top amateur teams, and quickly began winning races such the Grand Prix de la Ville de Lillers.\n\nIn 1979, after retaining her British road title, taking fourth place in the world amateur road championship, claiming five wins in France and winning the French 'Best Amateur' Trophy, she turned professional for the Peugeot cycling team, and as a climbing specialist focused on single-day road races and stage races in hilly or mountainous terrain. York was happy to travel abroad and wasn't homesick. As Millar, she married a French woman and lived with her in France.\n\nYork's 1980 debut pro season included second in the Tour du Vaucluse to Michel Laurent and eighth in a race in which she would finish in the top ten overall in her career seven times, the Tour de Romandie. Returning home for the UK National Championship, she finished fifth.\nIn 1981 she improved one place on the year before with her seventh place in the Tour de Romandie. 1981 was her first prominent finish in another race in which she would again consistently impress, the Critérium du Dauphiné Libéré. York finished seventh as per the Tour de Romandie and was the first of six occasions in which she would end the Dauphiné in the top ten in the General Classification.1982 saw York again finish seventh in the Tour de Romandie. In the second year of the under-23 Tour de l'Avenir being opened to professionals, York finished second to Greg LeMond.\n\nIn 1983 York came second in the Critérium du Dauphiné Libéré with LeMond again finishing a place above her. With her impressive June showing in the Dauphine, York was selected for the Tour de France for the first time. Any hopes of a high placing in the tour General Classification ended on stage three when she crashed losing seventeen minutes. 11 July was that year's tour first mountainous race crossing the Aubisque, Tourmalet, Aspin, and Peyresourde in the Pyrenees on stage ten. The only Pyrenean stage of that tour, York won the day six seconds ahead of Pedro Delgado. York finished fourteenth overall, twenty-three minutes behind the winner, Laurent Fignon and sandwiched in between two riders who would figure prominently in her career, Stephen Roche in thirteenth and Delgado in fifteenth. York's debut grand tour gave her third in the mountains classification, one place above Delgado like in the General Classification with Lucien Van Impe taking the polka dot jersey.\n\n1984 saw continued improvement. In the early season Paris–Nice, she and her team-mates finished second in the stage four team time trial. Two days later York finished second on a stage ending on Mont Ventoux putting her in the overall lead at that point. She ended the race in sixth overall behind winner Sean Kelly, Stephen Roche, Bernard Hinault, Michel Laurent and Phil Anderson. In the Tour de Romandie second stage at Crans Montana she beat Pascal Simon into second place. Roche won the race with York finishing in fifth. York took the mountains competition. York also enjoyed success in the Grand Prix du Midi Libre winning a stage and finishing fourth overall.\nThen came York's best Tour de France. Stage eleven again began at Pau. After crossing the climbs of the Portet d'Aspet, Core and Latrape, York won the stage finishing with a climb to Guzet-Neige ski station. She was forty-one seconds ahead of Luis Herrera with Delgado a further twenty seconds behind in third. York finished fourth overall (surpassing Tom Simpson's sixth place in the 1960s as the best British finish at the time) with Fignon winning for the second successive year and Hinault and LeMond also ahead of York. Kelly was a place behind York in fifth. York won the \"King of the Mountains\" polka dot jersey, the first time a native English speaker had won this jersey.\nOn 2 September was York's best finish in the UCI World Championships. Raced in Barcelona, York finished sixth with winner Claude Criquielion, Claudio Corti and Steve Bauer taking the podium places. Other races that year included second in the Tour du Haut Var to Eric Caritoux and second in Nice – Alassio to Roche. York finished seventh in the Volta a Catalunya, won by Kelly.\n\nIn 1985, the Vuelta a España was still held in its April – May slot as the first of the three grand tours of the season. York took over the race lead on stage ten, a stage won by Kelly. York held the lead going into what has become one of the most infamous days' racing in the history of the event. York started the day just ten seconds ahead of Francisco Rodríguez with Spain's Pello Ruiz Cabestany 65 seconds further behind in third. With the following day's last stage of the race little more than ceremonial, York said to the press, \"I just have to stick to Pacho Rodríguez's wheel and it's done.\" A mountainous stage with three major climbs, Rodriguez tried but was unable to make any inroads on York on the first climb of the day, the Morcuera. At the foot of the second climb, the Cotos, York punctured, meaning once the puncture had been tackled York had to chase to get back to Rodriguez and Cabestany. By the time riders reached the third climb, Los Leones, York had not only reached Rodriguez and Cabestany but was also taking their congratulations, indicating their acceptance of the race being effectively over as a contest.\nHowever, York was unaware that Delgado, in the mountains around his Segovia home town that he knew so well, had launched an attack. None of the riders in York's group made York aware of the attack by Delgado, an elite specialist climber like York, with the knowledge of the roads allowing him to descend aggressively. Delgado had support in his break from a second rider, Jose Recio. Delgado had started the day in sixth place and six minutes behind York. Working with Recio, Delgado was now nearly seven minutes ahead of York on the road. York had no team-mates in the group with Rodriguez and Cabestany as they had been unable to keep up. Recio won the stage and Delgado took overall lead of the race by thirty-six seconds from York. With the race being referred to as \"The Stolen Vuelta', from the collusion among the Spanish-speaking riders, York finished second overall. Peugeot directeur sportif, Roland Berland, said \"It's rotten, the whole peloton was against us. It seems a Spaniard had to win at all costs.\" L'Équipe's Philip Bouvet stated York was \"the victim of a formidable Spanish coalition\". York said afterwards \"I'll never return to Spain\". In the television documentary on the career of Robert Millar, \"The High Life\", York criticised Berland for his handling of the situation on the road when Delgado attacked, stating that Berland had been unable to negotiate support from other non-Spanish speaking teams during the stage to give York the required support to chase down Delgado's lead.\n\nEarlier that year, York had come sixth once more in the early season Paris–Nice, with Kelly again winning in his run of seven successive victories in the event. In the Tour de France, York finished eleventh. In September, York was overall winner of the Volta a Catalunya, taking the leader's jersey on the penultimate stage, a individual time trial at Tortosa. York beat Sean Kelly, the previous overall winner, by three seconds. In the Giro del Piemonte, York finished third behind Charly Mottet. In the Tour du Haut Var, York ended seventh, with Mottet again the victor. York was fourth in the Grand Prix de Wallonie (won by Marc Madiot). York was sixth in two races won by Stephen Roche, the Tour Midi-Pyrenees – now known as the Route du Sud – and the Critérium International. In the Critérium du Dauphiné Libéré, York placed ninth behind a winning Phil Anderson.\n\nYork changed teams in 1986 to ride for Panasonic. Despite her previous comment after the '85 race, she again rode in the Vuelta a España. York won stage six from Santander to Lagos de Covadonga putting her into the leader's jersey. On stage eleven however, a time trial at Valladolid, Alvaro Pino took over the lead and retained this to the finish with York finishing second overall like she had the year before. The winning margin was one minute and six seconds.\nIn the Tour de France York was racing well even before the race reached the mountains with a third in the team time trial and ninth in the individual time trial on stage nine. York was placed tenth at this point. This improved further in the Pyrenees on stage thirteen from Pau crossing the Tourmalet, the Aspin, the Peyresourde and finishing at Superbagneres. York finished second on the day to eventual winner of the race, Greg Lemond. This placed York in fourth overall at this point and in the lead in the mountains competition. She retained this to the end of stage seventeen between Gap and Serre Chevalier. However York was battling illness and began to spiral down the placings in a struggle just to stay in the race. In the stage twenty time trial, in contrast to the ninth place in the earlier time trial, York placed 112th over ten minutes behind the stage winner (Hinault). York started stage twenty-one in fifteenth overall but climbed off her bike to abandon the race before the conical final climb of the day up the Puy de Dôme.\nIn other races, York finished second overall in the Tour de Suisse behind Andrew Hampsten. York was sixth in the Vuelta a Aragón and seventh in the Escalada a Montjuïc.\n\nIn 1987 York rode the Giro d'Italia for the only time in her career. The race provided high drama due to the controversy between two riders on the same Carrera team, Roberto Visentini and Roche. The two teammates battled each other, but the presence of York and her own Panasonic team-mate, Erik Breukink, challenging for the race made this risky. York won stage 21 in a three-man breakaway with Roche and Marino Lejarreta. The result moved her up to second overall and gave Roche the win as Visentini fell, broke his wrist and lost six more minutes on what was to be his last day in the race. York also took the climber's green jersey. In the Tour de Romandie, York finished fourth, a race won by Roche as was the Tour de France. York finished nineteenth in the Tour de France, although at the end of stage fourteen from Pau to Luz Ardiden York again enjoyed her zenith in the race when she was fifth overall. Like the year before she had been helped by a strong showing in the first individual time trial. However, York slipped to fifth, then sixth, before on stage nineteen she lost over fifteen minutes to slide out of contention. Elsewhere York was fifth in Liège–Bastogne–Liège with Moreno Argentin winning for the third year running. York was sixth in the Tour of the Mediterranean (Gerrit Solleveld won) and seventh in the Setmana Catalana de Ciclisme behind winner Vicent Belda.\n\nIn 1988, York joined the French Fagor team as had Roche and Schepers. York managed her best position in a one-day 'Monument' Classic, third in Liège–Bastogne–Liège behind Adri van der Poel. York returned to the Vuelta a Espana and finished sixth overall with Kelly winning.\nIn the Tour de France, after struggling in the Alps, on stage fourteen she lost the opportunity of a repeat Pyrenees stage win in Guzet-Neige. York led over each of the first two climbs from Blagnac. In sprinting uphill to the finish with Phillipe Bouvatier, both riders mistook a gendarme's signals, took a wrong turn and ceded the win to Massimo Ghirotto. York finished in second on the day two seconds behind. The next day York was again riding at the front when leading over the second climb but cracked and finished twenty-one minutes behind. Stage seventeen was the last she would complete that year.\nHigh placings that year were second in the Bicicleta Vasca included third in each of the Critérium International and the Route de Sud (Ronan Pensec won). York was eighth in Volta a Catalunya] and ninth in Paris – Nice.\n\nYork returned to one of her previous teams, Z-Peugeot as it was now known and was second overall behind Mottet after winning stage seven in the Critérium du Dauphiné Libéré. York was a stage winner in the Tour de Romandie and a runner-up in the Grand Prix de Wallonie to Thomas Wegmüller.\nShe rode only one grand tour for the first time since 1984, and she had her best placing in the tour since the 1984 race. She won stage ten of the 1989 Tour de France from Cauterets to Superbagnères. York was first to the top of all four of that days climbs scaling the Tourmalet, Aspin, and Peyresourde before the Superbagneres finish. Charly Mottet was dropped from the three-man group approaching the finish leaving York to out sprint Delgado at the line. York was placed eighth at this point and ended that year's tour in tenth. In the autumn York was overall winner in the Tour of Britain with her decisive move coming in a long two-man breakaway with Mauro Gianetti into Cardiff. Gianetti took the sprint for the stage but York comfortably stayed in yellow for the rest of the race. Other top ten placings included eighth in the Tour de Vaucluse (Rooks won) and ninth in the Grand Prix of the Americas.\n\nVictory in the Critérium du Dauphiné Libéré arrived in 1990. York was in a stage six, two-person breakaway with Thierry Claveyrolat. Both riders finished in the top five in the leading group the next day. Stage eight was an individual time trial and despite strong time trialists being in the peloton such as Roche and Toni Rominger, York took the overall title with Claveyrolat the runner up.\nYork was runner up for a second time in the Tour de Suisse with Kelly the victor that year. York was a stage winner in the Tour de Romandie (Mottet took overall prize). York took fourth place in the Giro di Lombardia behind Gilles Delion. In between, she also took second place in the 1990 Tour of Britain hampered by a crash on the last day. In the Tour de France York rode as part of the team intended to support the previous year's winner and reigning world champion, Greg LeMond. The Z team not only helped deliver the yellow jersey for LeMond but also won the team competition. York though was denied the yellow cap award from the competition her team led from stage ten onwards. Stage fourteen was the last she completed on the tour that year. This was York's third and last withdrawal from the eleven times she rode the tour. Other placings in the top ten that year included fourth in the Vuelta a Andalucía and ninth in La Flèche Wallonne.\n\nYork won a stage in the 1991 Tour de Suisse and finished fifth overall. That year was her best overall finish in the Tour de Romandie, second, with Rominger the man denying York the title. She was second in the debut edition of the Classique des Alpes, fourth in the Critérium du Dauphiné Libéré, fourth in the Tour of Britain and fifth in the Grand Prix of the Americas. She finished the Tour de France in seventy-second place, the only one of her eight finishes in the tour that was outside the top twenty-five.\n\nIn 1992, York revealed her vegetarianism, which was an intention to improve her performance on the bike. \"It's not a principle – it's a personal thing. I've read a lot of books about it\". York completed the Tour de France in 1992 (18th) and 1993 (24th), and the Vuelta in 1992 (20th) and 1993 (15th).\n\nIn a time when doping was common and bans shorter, York tested positive for testosterone after a stage of the Vuelta a España, in 1992. She was fined £1,100, lost her third place on the stage, incurred a 10-minute time penalty and was given a three-month suspended ban.\n\nIn the final years of her career, she achieved top ten finishes in the Setmana Catalana de Ciclisme, Giro del Piemonti and Liege – Bastogne – Liege (all in 1992), and the Classiques des Alpes and the Midi Libre (both in 1993). However, further victories largely eluded her. Her final major victory came in June 1995 when she won the National Road Race Championship. However, soon afterwards, her French team Le Groupement went bust and York retired from racing.\n\nIn 1997, York became the coach of the British national team, and in 1998 managed the Scottish team in the Tour of Britain, an eight-day round-Britain stage race. She also worked in journalism, writing for several cycling magazines.\n\nYork and her wife were believed to have separated in the late 1990s. In 2000, a tabloid news story reported that York, still known publicly as Robert Millar, was now living as a woman. The story hurt York, who reduced her connections with cycling, though still kept up some writing and appeared at the 2002 Commonwealth Games as Millar. Following this, however, she receded further from view and cut her ties with cycling. In 2007, journalist Richard Moore wrote a biography of York titled \"In Search of Robert Millar\". After initially refusing to respond, York did answer some of Moore's questions via email, though dramatically cut off contact. At the time, Moore wrote that \"It is impossible to put a date on Millar's disappearance. It was more a fade-out than a vanishing act... These days, Millar is in very occasional email contact with one or two former acquaintances but his whereabouts are a mystery\".\n\nYork partially returned to journalism in the 2010s, writing a blog for \"Cyclingnews\" and later writing occasionally for other publications including \"The Guardian\". She remained a private figure, but following her announcement of her gender transition joined the ITV4 commentary team for the 2017 Tour de France.\n\nDuring the mid-1980s Millar appeared in television commercials for Kellogg's 'Start' cereal. A one-hour Granada Television documentary about Millar's 1985 racing season, entitled \"The High Life\", which also included appearances by Allan Peiper and music by Steve Winwood, was screened in Britain on the eve of the 1986 Tour de France.\n\n\"Robert Millar – The High Life\" was rediscovered and screened, simultaneously with the release of the book, at Edinburgh Bike Week Film Festival on 26 June 2007. A DVD version of the documentary was released in 2008. In 2011, Millar authored analytical opinions for \"Cyclingnews\" during the Tour de France.\n\nAs Millar, York married a French woman, Sylvie Transler, in December 1985. No-one from York's family was in attendance, nor were any of her team-mates, who had no idea she even had a girlfriend. Panasonic team-mate Phil Anderson commented, \"He didn't seem to have the skills for getting on with men, let alone women\". The couple were believed to have separated by the late 1990s.\n\nAs a cyclist, York had a reputation for being taciturn and could be uncooperative with the media. Jeff Connor, author of \"Wide Eyed & Legless: Inside the Tour de France\" was told to \"fuck off\" when requesting an interview during the 1987 Tour de France. When told this, commentator Phil Liggett replied, \"That sounds like Millar, he's been really awkward with us in the past. Personally, I think it's a disgrace. He has a duty to his sponsor to represent the team and you don't do that by telling journalists to 'fuck off'.\" During commentary for Stage 23 of the 1987 Tour de France, Liggett stated \"[It has been a] very disappointing Tour for Robert. He has lost a lot of popularity, too, one has to say. He won't speak to journalists and the team itself [Panasonic] is also becoming discontented with Robert this year.\" York subsequently left Panasonic at the end of the 1987 season, to join Fagor.\n\nYork's 'disappearance' during the 2000s was at the time attributed to her insularity and eccentricity. At the time, rumours of her gender transition were largely disregarded. On 6 July 2017, in a statement on \"Cyclingnews\", York confirmed her gender transition. She wrote that:\n\nYork is the first former professional cyclist to have publicly changed gender.\n\nSource:\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

In later years, Morrow left the world of politics to become a book publisher. He is best remembered as a factional leader of the American Trotskyist movement.\n\nFelix Morrow was born Felix Mayrowitz to an Orthodox Jewish family in 1906 in New York City. His parents, emigrants from Eastern Europe, ran a small grocery store in the city. Morrow later recalled his upbringing in a letter to historian Alan Wald:\n\nI came from a Hassidic family, but my father at the age of 15 had fled in disillusionment from the house of the Chortkow Rebbe where his father was a gabbai (rabbai's assistant). But my mother remained religious and I had a traditional Jewish education.\n\nIn the U.S., both of Felix Mayrowitz's parents had become socialists and Felix had been a participant in the youth section of the Socialist Party of America from an early age, beginning with the Junior division of the Young People's Socialist League. At age 16, Felix was employed as a reporter by the \"Brooklyn Daily Times.\" He later went to work for the \"Brooklyn Daily Eagle,\" using his paychecks there to help finance his education at New York University (NYU).\n\nFelix Mayrowitz graduated from NYU in 1928 and enrolled in graduate school at Columbia University, also located in New York City, where he studied religion in association with the Philosophy Department. At the time of his enrolling at Columbia, Felix availed himself of advice he had received that his professional progress would be easier with a less ethnic surname; it was at this time that Felix Mayrowitz became Felix Morrow. Friends at Columbia included Herbert Solow, Meyer Schapiro, Whittaker Chambers, George Novack, John McDonald, and Sidney Hook.\n\nIn 1931, the young graduate student applied for membership in the Communist Party USA in the wake of his friend Solow. At the time of his application, Morrow was advised by New York District Organizer Israel Amter that he would be of greater service to the party as a \"secret\" member of the organization rather than as a known public figure. Morrow was told by Amter to consider himself a party member, and his application was squirreled away in Amter's desk.\n\nMorrow traveled the country extensively as a reporter for the Communist Party literary-artistic monthly, \"The New Masses\" and for its daily newspaper, \"The Daily Worker,\" making use of the pseudonym \"George Cooper.\" His journalism was later collected into book form and translated into Russian for publication in the Soviet Union in 1933 as \"Life in the United States in this Depression.\" He also taught courses on American history at the CPUSA's New York party training school, served as a member of the party's speakers' bureau, and assisted Joseph Freeman with editorial tasks at \"The New Masses.\"\n\nMorrow was for many years a leading figure in American Trotskyism, best known for his book \"Revolution and Counter-Revolution In Spain\". He joined the Communist League of America in 1933. During this period, he described Malcolm Cowley as \"the literary cop who patrols The New Republic beat for Stalin.\"\n\nAfter Max Shachtman's minority split in 1940, served as editor of 'Fourth International' monthly theory/polemical journal of the Socialist Workers Party (SWP) between 1940–45, until displaced by E R Frank (Bert Cochran) on the maneuvers of James P Cannon and the SWP majority who opposed his views on perspectives for European Trotskyists at the mid-war point. He was one of 18 SWP leaders, including the party's National Secretary, James P. Cannon, imprisoned under the Smith Act during the Second World War.\n\nIn 1943 he formed a faction, with Albert Goldman which challenged the SWP's \"orthodox\" catastrophic perspective. Morrow and Goldman projected the likelihood of a prolonged period of bourgeois democracy in western Europe and emphasised the need for democratic and transitional demands against the maximalism advocated by the majority. Although he was expelled from the SWP in 1946 for \"unauthorised collaboration\" with Shachtman's Workers Party, he did not join Shachtman, and drifted from left-wing politics to the right. \n\nIn the early 1950s, with the help of friends Meyer Schapiro and Elliot Cohen, Morrow was hired by Schocken Books, working first as salesman and soon as a vice president there. He later worked at Beacon Press, a publisher based in Boston, Massachusetts.\n\nIn the late 1950s Morrow founded University Books, publishing hundreds of titles under that imprint, including a number of reprints.\n\nBy June 23, 1958, Morrow had obtained a US security clearance and had contracted with the CIA to prepare a Russian manuscript of Doctor Zhivago for distribution to Soviet visitors to the Brussels International World Fair, and also to give copies to sailors on ships bound for the Soviet Union.\n\nMorrow wrote the foreword to the book \"Aleister Crowley: The Man, The Poet, The Mage\" by C. R. Cammell (New Hyde Park, N.Y.: University Books, 1962) using the pseudonym \"John C. Wilson\".\n\nIn the 1970s University Books was sold to the publisher Lyle Stuart, who continued to publish books under the imprint along with his own.\n\nMorrow died on May 28, 1988. He is survived by two daughters, a son and two grandchildren. He lost another son to a car accident in 1969.\n\nMorrow's most important work was \"Revolution and Counter-Revolution in Spain\" on the Spanish Civil War.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1878113", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1878113", "title": "The Attractions", "text": "The Attractions\n\nThe Attractions were an English backing band for the English new wave musician Elvis Costello between 1977 and 1986, and again from 1994 to 1996. They consisted of Steve Nieve (keyboards and ukulele), Bruce Thomas (bass guitar), and Pete Thomas (drums). They also released one album (and two associated singles) as an independent entity, without Costello, in 1980.\n\nBacking for Costello's 1977 debut album was provided by the American West Coast band Clover. Later in 1977, Costello formed his own permanent backing band, the Attractions, consisting of Steve Nieve (born Steve Nason; keyboards and ukulele) from London, Bruce Thomas (bass guitar) from Stockton-on-Tees, and Pete Thomas (drums) from Sheffield. The two Thomases are unrelated.\n\nBruce Thomas was the oldest group member (29 when he joined), with the most professional experience prior to being an Attraction. He had previously been a member of the band Quiver, who had released two albums on their own in 1971/72, as well as functioning as the backing band for several albums by The Sutherland Brothers. These albums were rather awkwardly credited to \"The Sutherland Brothers and Quiver\"; Thomas played on the early recordings credited to this group, including the minor American hit \"(I Don't Want to Love You But) You Got Me Anyway\", which peaked at No. 48 in 1973. He left the group before their biggest success, 1976's \"Arms of Mary\", a No. 5 UK hit and a No. 1 hit in many European countries. Thomas was also a member of Moonrider for their lone album in 1975, and recorded as a session musician for Al Stewart in the early to mid-seventies.\n\nPete Thomas, who was born the same month as Costello, had recorded one album as a member of Chilli Willi and the Red Hot Peppers.\n\nOnly Nason, who had classical training, had never recorded or played with a rock band before. Just 19 when he joined the group, Nason gained the stage name \"Steve Nieve\" (pronounced as \"naive\") from Ian Dury; while Elvis Costello & The Attractions were playing a series of concerts with Dury before they recorded their first single, Nason innocently asked Dury \"What's a groupie?\" Dury immediately dubbed Nason \"Steve Naive\", and the name stuck (although the spelling was altered.)\n\nElvis Costello and the Attractions played live gigs as early as the summer of 1977, and a few live tracks were appended to the B-side of the Costello solo single \"Watching The Detectives\", issued in October 1977. The full band made their studio recording debut with the March 1978 single \"(I Don't Want To Go To) Chelsea\". From there, the Attractions backed Costello on all of his albums and singles until 1984, with the exception of \"New Amsterdam\" (1980), a solo single recorded by Costello.\n\nIn 1980, The Attractions recorded an album of their own, entitled \"Mad About The Wrong Boy\". The album featured original compositions by all three group members, and was produced by Roger Bechirian. Steve Nieve wrote the music for several songs under the pseudonym \"Norman Brain\"; for these songs, his then-girlfriend Fay Hart provided lyrics, leading to a writing credit of \"Brain/Hart\". The Brain/Hart composition \"Single Girl\" was released as the first single from the album, followed by the Nieve-composed \"Arms Race\" as the second single. Neither single charted.\n\nDue to their frequent use of pseudonyms and their associations with Bechirian, The Attractions were widely - but erroneously - rumoured to have been behind Blanket of Secrecy (BoS), a synthpop trio recognised at the time only by the pseudonyms 'Tinker', 'Tailor' and 'Soldier'. The group's lone album, \"Walls Have Ears\", was produced by Bechirian and issued in 1982. \n\nGuitarist Martin Belmont was briefly added to Attractions live line-up in 1981, but never recorded as an official member of the band. He did, however, make a guest appearance on the 1981 Elvis Costello and The Attractions single \"From A Whisper to a Scream\", which was also included on the album, \"Trust\".\n\nAlbums by Elvis Costello and The Attractions appeared regularly until 1984. On that year's \"Goodbye Cruel World\" and its associated tour, The Attractions' keyboardist was billed as \"Maurice Worm\"; yet another pseudonym for Nason/Nieve.\n\nIn early 1986, Costello released \"King of America\", billed to The Costello Show and made largely without the Attractions. The Attractions played on only one track, as well as the non-LP B-side \"Baby's Got A Brand New Hairdo\", billed to 'The Costello Show Featuring The Attractions'.\n\nLater that same year Costello reunited with The Attractions to record the album \"Blood & Chocolate\", but this would prove to be the final Attractions release for several years. Growing antipathy between Costello and Bruce Thomas contributed to the Attractions' first split in 1986, and the rift was exacerbated by what Costello felt was his unflattering portrayal in Thomas' 1990 book \"The Big Wheel\". Despite this, the original group reunited for several tracks on Costello's 1994 album \"Brutal Youth\" and toured together over the next two years. They recorded one further album as a group (1996's \"All This Useless Beauty\") but split for good in 1996.\n\nNieve and Pete Thomas continued to back Costello through various touring and recording lineups, and are still members of his current backing group The Imposters. The split between Costello and Bruce Thomas, however, appears permanent. Bruce Thomas made a brief appearance with his former bandmates when the group was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2003, but when Costello was asked why Thomas did not play with them at the event, he reportedly replied, \"I only work with professional musicians.\"\n\n\"For releases by Elvis Costello & The Attractions, please see the Elvis Costello discography.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1878130", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1878130", "title": "Bellwether", "text": "Bellwether\n\nA bellwether is an individual who either leads or indicates trends; a trendsetter.\n\nThe term derives from the Middle English \"bellewether\" and refers to the practice of placing a bell around the neck of a castrated ram (a \"wether\") leading the flock of sheep. A shepherd could then note the movements of the flock by hearing the bell, even when the flock was not in sight.\n\nIn sociology, the term is applied in the active sense to a person or group of people who tend to create, influence, or set trends.\n\nIn politics, the term more often applies in a metaphorical sense to describe a geographic region where political tendencies match in microcosm those of a wider area, such that the result of an election in the former region might predict the eventual result in the latter. In a Westminster-style election, for example, a constituency, the control of which tends frequently to change, can mirror in its popular vote the result on a national scale.\n\nIn the stock market, a bellwether is a stock that is believed to be a leading indicator of the direction of a sector, an industry or the market as a whole. Bellwether stocks, also known as barometer stocks, are often used to determine the direction in which an industry or market is headed in the short term.\nJPMorgan Chase is an example of a bellwether stock. As one of the major banks in the United States, it sets the tone for the rest of the industry. JPMorgan Chase also has contracts with companies in other industries, so its performance is reflected in other sectors of the market. Tata Consultancy Services is similarly a bellwether for technology stocks in the Indian markets, BSE and NSE.\n\nIn Australian federal elections, the Division of Robertson in NSW became the nation's new longest-running bellwether seat, continually won by party that also won government since the 1983 election. \n\nPreviously, the electoral division of Eden-Monaro elected its Member of Parliament from the party which won government at every federal election from 1972 until 2016, when the record was broken after Labor won the seat, while the Coalition won government. The Division of Lindsay in NSW, has elected its Member of Parliament from the party which won government in every Federal election since its creation in 1984 until 2016. Both Lindsay and Eden-Monaro lost their bellwether status in the 2016 election, both electing Labor MPs, despite a narrow Coalition win nationwide. \n\nThe Division of Makin in South Australia was a bellwether division from 1984 until 2010, although ceased its bellwether record in 2013, when Makin stayed Labor as the Coalition regained power nationwide. Also, in terms of nationwide two party preferred vote, Eden-Monaro, Lindsay, Robertson and Makin have bucked the bellwether trend in the past by voting Liberal at the 1998 federal election. In purely statistical terms, the state of New South Wales, which has the largest population of any Australian state or territory, could also be considered a \"bellwether\", as, until the 2016 federal election the party which wins government has won the majority of House of Representatives seats in that state at every election since 1963. Unlike many bellwethers, these are cited by analysts solely for their record and are not usually attributed to demographic factors that reflect the median of Australia.\n\nIn Brazilian direct presidential elections, the state of Minas Gerais is where the winning candidate took the lead in the last-round election from 1955 to 2018.\n\nIn the Canadian province of Ontario, Sarnia-Lambton (and its predecessor ridings) voted for the winning party in every federal election from 1963 until 2011. This streak was broken in 2015. St. Paul's has only elected three opposition MPs since it was created in 1935. Also in Ontario, Peterborough has been won by the party who has won the most seats overall in provincial elections since 1977. In Alberta, Peace River has elected only three opposition MLAs since the province was founded in 1905.\n\nSince the fifth republic president was elected by popular vote in 1965 up to 2017, five departments have always voted the chosen candidate in the second round: Ardèche, Calvados, Charente-Maritime, Indre-et-Loire and Loire. No region has done so in the first round.\n\nSince the creation of the Federal Republic of Germany (then West Germany) in 1949, the state where the leading party list vote (\"Zweitstimmen\") matched the party of the subsequently chosen Chancellor more times is Schleswig-Holstein (with two misses: 1969 and 2005), followed by the state of Lower Saxony (with misses in 1949, 1969 and 2005). Both states lie in the North of the country, neither containing many large industrial cities (the biggest being Kiel and Hannover respectively), nor large rural Catholic populations, the traditional base of SPD and CDU/CSU respectively. Schleswig-Holstein is also famous for having had several state elections result in a one-seat majority for the winning coalition and Lower Saxony's 1998 election (in which Gerhard Schröder was the SPD candidate) is often seen as a \"trial run\" for the subsequent federal election (which Schröder also won). Both the 1949 and the 1969 elections were rather narrow, the former resulting in a one-vote majority in the election for chancellor and the latter resulting in a 12-seat majority that had broken down due to defections by 1972.\n\nTwo individual seats, Valsad and West Delhi have successfully predicted the victory in the last eleven general elections.\n\nFurthermore, the party which wins the majority of seats in Delhi has always gone on to form the national government since 1998.\n\nThe state of Uttar Pradesh is also seen as a bellwether, with the national government having been formed the majority of times by the party that won the most seats in the state.\n\nIreland has a proportional representation electoral system, in which politicians are elected by the single transferable vote. Bellwethers here can only be measured by the number of candidates from each side elected to Ireland's multiple-seat constituencies that elect an odd number of members. Between the 1981 general election and 2011 general election, Meath and its successors, Meath East and Meath West, have elected a majority of Fianna Fáil TDs in years when Fianna Fáil formed the government, and a majority of Fine Gael and Labour TDs when those parties formed the government.\n\nIn New Zealand, there are three generally accepted bellwether electorates: Hamilton East and Hamilton West, both based around the city of Hamilton, and Northcote on Auckland's North Shore. Hamilton West and Northcote missed one election each since they were first contested in 1969 and 1996 respectively — the for Hamilton West and the for Northcote. Hamilton East, first contested in 1972, has missed three elections — 1993, 1999, and 2005. They were all held by the National Party in the 2017 election although Labour formed the government after the election. Since the National Party was still returned as the largest party in Parliament, however, the two electorates did in fact retain their bellwether status, albeit to a limited extent.\n\nIn the Philippines, the winner of Philippine presidential election has won in Negros Oriental in all instances since 1935 except for 1961 and 2016, and in Basilan since its creation in December 1973. After Negros Oriental voted for the runner-up in 2016, Basilan's streak that started in 1978 is currently the nation's longest.\n\nFor vice presidential elections, Pangasinan has voted for the winner in all elections save for 1986 and 2016.\n\nIn every general election to the National Assembly since the restoration of democracy the electoral district of Braga has voted for the party or coalition that has won the most seats in the election. (Note that following the elections of 2015, a minority government was eventually formed by the second-largest party in the Assembly.)\n\nSince the 1987 presidential election, the central province of North Chungcheong was the one in which the most voted candidate for the presidency was the national winner.\n\nSince democracy was restored in 1977 up to 2019 elections, two provinces have always voted for the winning party (Zaragoza and Huesca), as has the Autonomous Community of Aragon, where said provinces are located. Aragon is, moreover, the sole Autonomous Community to have done so.\n\nThe expression \"Som Ljungby röstar röstar Sverige\" (\"As Ljungby votes, Sweden votes\") was coined in the early 1970s, but more recently (2006) voting results in Karlstad, Kalmar and Halmstad more closely resembled the result of the whole nation in elections to the Riksdag.\n\nAccording to Statistics Sweden, election results in Karlstad have been closest to the national results for three consecutive elections, a fact often highlighted by media through Gallup Polls showing voting intentions in the area.\n\nFrom the first competitive multi-party elections in 1996 on, the Changhua County was the region of Taiwan where the leading presidential candidate became the elected president of the country.\n\nUnited Kingdom constituencies have been subject to frequent review since the late 1960s, particularly those of the House of Commons. Few constituencies are unchanged from one review to another. Therefore, true bellwethers are rare. However, it is possible to match new constituencies to old ones according to the destination of the bulk of the old electorate.\n\nLong running bellwether constituencies\nFormer bellwether constituencies\n\nThe constituencies of Cunninghame North, Stirling and Na h-Eileanan an Iar have all elected MSPs from the party which won the plurality of seats in the election overall for every Scottish Parliament election.\n\nAlso, the constituencies of Almond Valley, Dundee City West, Edinburgh Eastern, Glasgow Southside, Kilmarnock and Irvine Valley and Mid Fife and Glenrothes each elected an MSP from the largest party in the 2011 and 2016 elections. This continues the trend that their predecessor constituencies (Livingston, Dundee West, Edinburgh East & Musselburgh, Glasgow Govan, Kilmarnock & Loudoun and Fife Central) achieved in the 1999, 2003 and 2007 elections.\n\nThe American bellwether states can be determined in different ways (with respect to presidential elections):\n\nHighest percentage for varying lengths of time\n\n\nHighest percentage for a set length of time\n\nElectoral record of the states for presidential elections, 1896–2016:\n\n\nSmallest deviation from the national average\n\nAnother way to measure how much a state's results reflect the national average is how far the state deviates from the national results. The states with the least deviation from a two-party presidential vote from 1896 to 2012 include:\n\n\nStates that were considered bellwether states from the mid-to-late 20th century until the early 21st century include: \n\nStates that were bellwether states a very long time ago include:\n\nIn addition, the Territory of Guam has had no misses from 1984 to 2012 (100.0%). Guam has no electoral college votes, but conducts a straw vote on local election day. Also of note, from 1996 through 2012, Ohio was within 1.85% of the national popular vote result. Due to the Electoral College system, a bellwether of sufficient size is often also a focus of national attention and presidential campaigns as a so-called swing state that can decide the election one way or the other. As of 2016, Ohio and Florida are seen as the most important swing states and no Republican has won the presidency while losing Ohio and the controversial decision in \"Bush v. Gore\" ultimately hinged on a recount of Florida, that – had it gone for Gore – would have swung the Electoral College vote.\n\nIowa has voted for the winning candidate in all but three elections (1976, 1988, and 2000) since 1964.\n\nAmerican bellwether counties include:\n\n\nThe quarterly \"Bellwether Report\", published by the Institute of Practitioners in Advertising (IPA), monitors trends in expenditure in the UK advertising and marketing industry.\n\n"}

He grew up with two older brothers, Don and Ryan, both of whom played hockey. O'Neill played in the 1990 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with the Richmond Hill-Vaughan Kings minor ice hockey team from the Ontario Minor Hockey Association. As a 14-year-old, he played at the Midget level with his brother Ryan — almost three years younger than some of his peers. At 15, O'Neill signed with the Thornhill Thunderbirds Jr. A club (OHA), whose coach Scott McLennan stated he had the skills to make it to the Ontario Hockey League. O’Neill’s number was later retired by the Thunderbirds in 2004. He finished his rookie season second in the Metro Junior Hockey League in scoring.\n\nO'Neill was the first overall selection of the Guelph Storm in the 1992 OHL Priority Selection, held at Maple Leaf Gardens in June 1992. He was named OHL Rookie of the Year that year after scoring 79 points in 65 games with the upstart Storm. His point total of 79 for a 16-year-old was the second highest total by a 16-year-old since Kirk Muller recorded 112 with the Guelph Platers in 1982–83. He also played in the American Hockey League for the Springfield Falcons. O'Neill spent three years in the OHL with the Storm before jumping to the NHL with the Hartford Whalers in 1995. Also in 1995 he represented Canada at the world junior hockey championships winning a gold medal.\n\nO'Neill was drafted in the first round, fifth overall by the Hartford Whalers (now Carolina Hurricanes) in the 1994 NHL Entry Draft. He went to the 2002 Stanley Cup Final with the Hurricanes before losing to the Detroit Red Wings. O'Neill was selected to the Eastern Conference team for the 2002–03 NHL All-Star Game.\n\nOn July 30, 2005, the Hurricanes traded O'Neill to the Toronto Maple Leafs for a conditional draft pick in the 2006 NHL Entry Draft. He expressed a desire to play for the Maple Leafs, his hometown team, before the signing of the CBA.\n\nRe-united with former Carolina Hurricanes coach Paul Maurice, O'Neill enjoyed a resurgence early in the 2006-07 season and, benefiting from playing on the top line with Mats Sundin and Alexander Steen, was briefly one of the top scorers. However, towards the end of the season, O'Neill had been benched for the remaining games due to poor offensive performance. His poor performance combined with his fear of flying led him to consider retirement at the end of the season. He was invited to the Carolina Hurricanes 2008-09 Training Camp, but did not make the final roster and was released.\n\nO'Neill is presently a sports broadcaster and hockey analyst with The Sports Network appearing on Toronto Maple Leafs broadcasts and TSN Hockey programs. He currently co-hosts \"OverDrive\" on TSN Radio 1050 with host Bryan Hayes and fellow co-host and former goaltender Jamie McLennan.\n\n"}

Donelson was also the father-in-law of future United States president, Andrew Jackson, who married his daughter, Rachel.\n\nDonelson served in the Virginia House of Burgesses before moving to the Watauga settlements on the Holston and Watauga Rivers in Washington District, North Carolina. From about 1770 to 1779, he operated the Washington Iron Furnace at Rocky Mount, Franklin County, Virginia.

Best known for producing records for Kyuss and Queens of the Stone Age, he is regarded as an important figure in the development of stoner rock and desert rock genres. Goss is also the lead singer and guitarist of the hard rock band Masters of Reality.\n\nAs well as being the founding (and only constant) member of influential desert rock outfit Masters of Reality, Goss is also well known for his production work on albums by Kyuss and Queens of the Stone Age. Largely credited as the \"Godfather of desert rock\", Goss has on several occasions played down the importance of his role in this musical movement. In 1999 he stated, “I can't make any claim at all to inventing desert rock, or stoner rock, or whatever you want to call it. I make rock n roll records, and hopefully try to make the listener feel like I did when I heard my favourite music.”\nIn 2004, Goss highlighted exactly what kind of music he created, “There's a bunch of weirdos that I work with all the time, and we make what I call \"out of whack\" Rock records. That's what I do. When people want an \"out of whack\" weird Rock record, they call me, and I take an \"out of whack\" amount of money to do it, and I'm glad to be there. It's cool.”\n\nIn late 2004, Chris Goss had to be hospitalized due to severe internal infection and the European leg of his tour in support of the new Masters of Reality album \"Give Us Barabbas\" had to be postponed indefinitely. After his recuperation, he joined Jeordie White and Zach Hill to release \"I Got a Brand New Egg Layin' Machine\", a \"mini LP\" released under the name Goon Moon.\n\nGoss appeared with his longtime friend Josh Homme of Queens of the Stone Age as \"\" at the \"winter edition\" of ArthurFest, performing an intimate set which was \"crafted in less than a month as the duo was a rather late addition to the Arthurball line-up as Sunday's headliner\". Continuing with Goon Moon, Goss, White and Hill released a full-length album in May 2007 entitled \"Licker's Last Leg\" containing many guest artists synonymous with the desert rock scene.\n\nGoss also joined Queens of the Stone Age and Billy Gibbons to perform \"Burn the Witch\" on \"Late Night with Conan O'Brien\".\n\nIn 2013, regarding Josh Homme's supposed decision to sequence the album Era Vulgaris using songs originated in a \"Los Angeles studio [beginning recording] without a single thing written, just to see what it was like to force songs out of his [and his bandmate's] psyche\", Goss was quoted saying: \"I’ve seen him do that before with the Desert Sessions but never with Queens. The Queens Of The Stone Age is a business, where he’s the CEO. It’s not run the same.\"\n\nIn 2014, filming completed in Las Vegas for \"Death in the Desert\", a full-length movie for which Goss wrote an original song titled \"Only the Lonely\", performed by singer Roxy Saint, who plays the character Corey in the full-length film, which is directed and produced by Saint's husband, Josh Evans. It stars Michael Madsen, Shayla Beesley and Paz de la Huerta. The movie is inspired by the book Death in the Desert by Cathy Scott, with the screenplay by John Steppling.\n\nThroughout his career Goss has worked with a wide range of musicians in various genres.\n\n\n\n"}

Educated in a conservative Catholic family, he was a remote cousin of writers Antoine de Saint-Exupéry and Louise de Vilmorin, later companion of André Malraux. Estienne d'Orves spent the First World War as a high school student at the prestigious Lycée Louis-le-Grand and the Lycée Saint-Louis-de-Gonzague in Paris, and entered the École Polytechnique in 1921. He joined the \"École Navale\", (French Naval Academy), two years later, becoming an \"enseigne de vaisseau de 2e classe\" in October 1923 and joining the school ship \"Jeanne d'Arc\". He was then an officer on the battleship \"Provence\", and several other vessels. In 1929, he married Éliane de Lorgeril, with whom he had five children.\n\nIn 1930, he was promoted to \"lieutenant de vaisseau\", and was made a \"chevalier de la Légion d'honneur\" in 1935. In December 1936, he joined the Naval War School for one year. When World War II broke out in 1939, he was serving aboard the \"Jaguar\", as under-chief of the headquarters of the 2nd flotilla of torpedo boats in Mediterranean Sea. In December 1939, he was an aide to Admiral Godfroy in the Headquarters of the \"Force X\" aboard cruiser \"Duquesne\"\n\nOn 25 June 1940, the day the Armistice was signed, he was in Alexandria, Egypt. Politically, d'Estienne d'Orves belonged to the right-wing, and had sympathies for Charles Maurras and Catholic monarchism; nonetheless, while many far-right wing theoricists welcomed the arrival of Marshal Philippe Pétain, the strongly patriotic d'Estienne d'Orves was unwilling to accept France's defeat. He attempted to join General Paul Legentilhomme, commander of French troops on the coast of French Somaliland, who had announced his intention to refuse the armistice, but the colony had chosen to rally itself to the Vichy régime. D'Estienne d'Orves then gathered a group of volunteer sailors and officers, took the \"nom de guerre\" \"Châteauvieux\" (name of one of his ancestors) and came into relations with the Free France authorities. He set sail on a cargo ship from Aden to London, sailing around Africa for two months, and rejoined General de Gaulle in London on 27 September 1940.\n\nHe met with Admiral Émile Muselier, but was unable to obtain a command at sea. Promoted to \"Capitaine de corvette\" (lieutenant commander) on 1 October 1940, he joined the Second Office of the Free French Naval Forces and requested to be sent to occupied France. After having convinced General de Gaulle, he received the mission to organise an intelligence network in western France, codenamed \"Nemrod\", which had been created in September 1940 by Maurice Barlier and Jan Doornik, but lacked coordination and development. He was officially assigned to this task on 15 December 1940.\n\nD'Estienne d'Orves was codenamed \"Jean-Pierre Girard\". On 21 December 1940, he set sail from Newlyn to Plogoff in Brittany on a fishing boat, the \"Marie-Louise\", along with his 20-year-old radio operator Alfred Gaessler, a German-speaking Alsatian, codenamed Georges Marty. They arrived at the Pointe du Raz the following day.\n\nHe set his quarters in Chantenay-sur-Loire, near Nantes, at the house of M. and Mme Clément, and made several trips to Paris and in Brittany, with the notable assistance of Maurice Barlier. He set up the basic organisation of the spying web, and was able to transmit significant information about German forces (coastal defences, submarines, aerodromes and refueling point near Nantes).\n\nFrom 6 January to 19 January 1941, he was in Paris to set up a second network, meeting with Max André, Jan Doornik and numerous other members of the French Resistance. Back in Nantes on 20 January, he came back to the Cléments who reported to him suspicious activities by the radio operator Gaessler, seen hanging around in bars and talking with German soldiers. When interrogated, Gaessler said that this was a good way to gather information. D'Estienne d'Orves decided to lay down Marty at the next trip to London but, two days later, the Gestapo stormed the house and arrested him. After a brief resistance, a wounded and handcuffed d'Estienne d'Orves was brought to Angers, along with his companions.\n\nMarty's treason allowed the Nazis to also arrest Barlier, Doornik and most of the network, totaling 26 persons. The small intelligence network created by Max André, however, was untouched, and continued its operations until the Liberation of Paris in August 1944. For several weeks, Gaessler sent false information to London and allowed the Nazis to arrest several other agents. He was evacuated by the Nazis to Austria, and disappeared in 1945.\n\nOn 24 January, the prisoners were sent to Berlin, then brought back to Paris, to the Cherche-Midi Prison. D'Estienne d'Orves was put under a particularly harsh treatment, yet managed to cheer up his fellow prisoners; the moral strength which he would find in his faith would later be testified to by German chaplain Franz Stock.\n\nHis trial began on 13 May. D'Estienne d'Orves claimed full responsibility of the network, defending his fellow prisoners. On the 23rd, a German court martial sentenced him to death, along with eight of his companions, and transferred them to the Fresnes Prison.\n\nAcknowledging their patriotism, the court martial filed a request for grace immediately, and German legal advisor Keyser took it upon himself to make the trip to Berlin and request a grace for the prisoners from Hitler himself. However, the invasion of USSR by the Third Reich, on 22 June 1941, forced the French Communists to join the Resistance and greatly increased the attacks against German forces, inducing a harshening of the repression. Hence, on 28 August, the execution order was given for d'Estienne d'Orves, Barlier and Doornik. The three condemned were granted to spend their last night together, and to be shot standing and without a blindfold. They were blessed by Chaplain Franz Stock.\n\nD'Estienne d'Orves had an interview with president Keyser, the German military judge who had sentenced him to death, where he said: \"Sir, you are a German officer. I am a French officer. We both did our duty. Please allow me to embrace you\".\n\nThe execution took place on 29 August 1941 at dawn at the Fort du Mont Valérien. Honoré d'Estienne d'Orves was buried in Verrières-le-Buisson.\n\nA German poster advertised their deaths. A number of people joined the Resistance as a consequence of this execution.\n\nThe \"Capitaine de corvette\" d'Estienne d'Orves was later posthumously promoted to \"Capitaine de frégate\" (Commander) and made a \"Compagnon de la Libération\" (\"Fellow of the Liberation\").\n\n\n"}

It became a mining town after discovery of gold in the area in September 1886. The area was difficult to mine and produced small quantities of gold, and the population dropped off by the turn of the century. The land was acquired by the United States Forest Service and burned down in the 1930s, but a cemetery remains.\n\nThe town was founded as a gold mining camp, after a \"rich strike\" was discovered west of Fort Collins in September 1886 between the Seven Mile and Elk Horn creeks. This resulted in a rush of miners to the area along Manhattan Creek. The town was platted in 1887 and a post office opened in March of that year. Today only a few boards remain of the town that had the Ace of Cubs saloon, a hotel, a butcher, livery stable, blacksmith, and houses. At first, people lived in tents and by the end of October 1887 there were 100 miners in town and 125 claims had been made. A school was opened the previous month that served Manhattan, Rustic, Elk Horn and Seven-Mile. There was little gold found and it was expensive to get to deposits deep into the earth. There were about 50 people in Manhattan in 1888. A discovery in the fall of 1890 led to a boom and building construction. Two people died in a mine explosion at the Black Hawk mine on November 13, 1892. There were about 300 people in Manhattan in 1898, but that had dropped to 50 in 1899.\n\nThere were about 300 men who mined the Laugh-a-lot, Little Tipsy, and Katy's Pet mines, but the town never realized the boom predicted by \"The Denver Post\" in 1897. A radio soap opera, \"Our Gal Sunday\", and the book \"A Lady from Colorado\", later adapted into an opera by Robert Ward, were based upon the life of Irish immigrant, Katie Lawder, who was orphaned at the age of 12 and lived in Colorado beginning at age 18. In 1888, she married Cecil Ernest Moon, an Englishman and Oxford graduate who later attained a title and a fortune. Katie took her cowgirl clothing and western frontier ways with her on trips with her husband to England. Ultimately she fell out of favor with Cecil and his family and the couple was divorced. She then lived entirely in Colorado and wished to continue to be called Lady Cecil Moon. She bought a ranch by 1901 for US$2,500 ().\n\nThe town was then owned by the United States Forest Service and became a Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) site in the 1930s. Some of the buildings from the town were moved, those that remained were burned by the Forest Service in the 1930s. The Manhattan Cemetery remains on Country Road 68C/162.\n"}

She released two full-length albums, \"Lemon Love\" and \"The Dandelion Sessions\", as well as a 4-disc EP. She is also the sister of three members of the band Georgia.\n\nAslyn was born in west Florida and raised in Chiefland, Florida, outside of Gainesville. At the age of seven, she began taking piano lesson Immediately submersing herself into the music scene, she did everything she could to gain exposure to live performing: entering talent contests, singing at weddings, and performing at church.\n\nUpon graduating from high school, Aslyn attended Carson-Newman College in Jefferson City, Tennessee and received her college degree. She then followed her dream of performing, which led her to Atlanta, Georgia, where she lived on various people's couches for a while as she performed throughout the town.\n\nDuring this phase in her life, Aslyn purchased her first car with saved money. She referred to this car as a \"lemon\", and it eventually inspired the title track of her debut album, \"Lemon Love\". She briefly dated Butch Walker, mentioning him in her song \"Golden\" as \"Number Five.\"\n\nWhile performing on a nightly basis, Aslyn began to immerse herself in many different genres of music. Many artists influenced her including Stevie Wonder, The Beatles, Earth Wind & Fire, and Queen.\n\nBeginning in 2002, Aslyn began to compose many of the songs that would be the basis for \"Lemon Love\". Record companies in Los Angeles began to show interest in Aslyn's music, inspiring her to begin searching for a record label.\n\nAslyn performed a very personal song for Capitol Records entitled \"493–1023\" which speaks about her father's job loss and ensuing loss of family stability. Upon hearing the song, the record label signed her immediately.\n\nWhile preparing to record and write the songs for her debut CD, Aslyn requested to work with producer Guy Chambers. She had become interested in Chambers' work after hearing the heavily European sound on many of Robbie Williams' albums. Chambers produced eight of the twelve tracks on \"Lemon Love\". For the remaining four, Aslyn worked with a California-based producer, Eric Valentine.\n\nTwo singles were released off the album: \"Be the Girl\" and \"Gotta Get Over You\". The first single that peaked at #35 on the Billboard Adult Contemporary chart. Aslyn's sound as a performer has been classified as more of an \"independent pop/alternative singer\". Her single \"Be the Girl\" was featured in an episode of \"\" on MTV.\"Be the girl\" also got featured in the \"Bratz Rock Angels\" Video Game.\n\nAfter the release of her album, Aslyn began to tour the United States which such headliners as Ryan Cabrera, Better Than Ezra, Gavin DeGraw, The Click Five, and Chris Isaak. The album peaked at #36 on the Billboard Top Heatseeker chart.\n\nIn January 2008, Aslyn released an EP entitled \"The Grand Garden EP\". The EP features 27 songs divided up into four parts or phases, most of which were recorded between \"Lemon Love\" and \"The Dandelion Sessions\". The following year, she toured with Toby Lightman.\n\nHer second album, \"The Dandelion Sessions\", was released on August 1, 2009 on iTunes. \nAslyn also performed at the benefit Zac Brown Band and Friends Concert on October 30, 2009 to help raise money for Athens' historic Georgia Theatre which burned down four months earlier on June 19.\n\nIn 2011, Aslyn released a live album \"Five Live\" on digital services on February 14.

{"id": "1878175", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1878175", "title": "Tales from Turnpike House", "text": "Tales from Turnpike House\n\nTales from Turnpike House is the seventh studio album by English alternative dance band Saint Etienne. It is a concept album in which the songs depict characters who all live in the eponymous block of flats in London.\n\nThe exact setting of the stories told by the album's setting is somewhat amorphous. The real Turnpike House is a high-rise block of flats in Goswell Road, EC1, an area of ex-council blocks between Clerkenwell and Upper Street. The band had spent a lot of time in Turnpike House, as filmmaker Paul Kelly lived there during the period in which they were collaborating on \"What Have You Done Today, Mervyn Day?\". However, Sarah Cracknell has said that the building imagined in the album is \"not nearly as smart\" as the real Turnpike House. Bob Stanley has said that he imagined the album's setting to be more suburban, \"probably somewhere like Croydon or possibly Ponders End\". Pete Wiggs has said that his experience of living in Croydon was the inspiration for \"Side Streets\" and \"Slow Down at the Castle\" (the Castle is a water tower in Park Hill Recreation Ground). However, the title of \"The Birdman of EC1\" refers to the postal district in which the real Turnpike House is located.\n\nThe album features two tracks co-written and produced by Xenomania (\"Lightning Strikes Twice\" and \"Stars Above Us\") as well as a guest vocal from 1970s pop star David Essex on \"Relocate\" (Essex had earlier appeared on the Saint Etienne album \"So Tough\" via sampled dialogue from the 1973 film \"That'll Be the Day\").\n\n\"Tales from Turnpike House\" was released 13 June 2005 on Sanctuary Records and preceded by a single for \"Side Streets\" on 6 June 2005. In the United States, the album was released 24 January 2006 by Savoy Jazz. Initial quantities of the UK release came with a bonus EP of children's music titled \"Up the Wooden Hills\". The band felt that music for young children under seven was fed into unexceptional pop music, and wanted to make music that children and parents could enjoy together. Double-disc editions of the US release included instead the \"Savoy Nu Groove Sampler\", containing six tracks from various Savoy Jazz releases, including \"Side Streets\" from the album itself.\n\nAs part of the reissue programme of all Saint Etienne's albums, \"Tales from Turnpike House\" was re-released in a deluxe double CD edition featuring unreleased material and sleeve notes by Jeremy Deller in October 2010.\n\n\"Tales from Turnpike House\" was very well-received from critics, holding an aggregate 79 out of 100 from Metacritic based on 22 reviews. The album's most favorable reviews, including a five-star review from Dorlan Lynskey of \"The Guardian\", called it the group's best album yet, with praise going towards the album's songwriting, production, arrangements, sound, vocal harmonies and Sarah Cracknell's vocals. Ernesto Lechner wrote in his review for the \"Los Angeles Times\" that \"If it's pop craftsmanship you are after, few can equal this melancholy concept album and the sheer virtuosity of its hooks\", while Stylus Magazine's Edward Oculicz called it an \"overwhelmingly forward, ambitious album for a group fifteen years into their career and long past their commercial prime who could have quite happily introduced no new ideas—musical or thematical—and not challenged their dwindling but loyal fan-base.\"\n\nAllmusic journalist Andy Kellman called it the band's most organic release since their fourth album \"Good Humor\", highlighting \"Turnpike\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s concept as allowing \"for a range of material that's as broad as what can be heard on any other Saint Etienne album.\" Peter Relic of \"Rolling Stone\", who also noted the variety of musical styles, called the record \"an unabashedly joyful celebration of being British\" that \"could make an Anglophile out of anyone.\" \n\nIn a less positive review, Thomas Blatchford of Drowned in Sound called \"Tales from Turnpike House\" \"A good enough record, but we know they can do better.\" He felt the harmonies were \"over-egged\" and not complementary to Cracknell's lead vocals, and described the concept as difficult to grasp it due to it being \"too downbeat to be uplifting and too uplifting to be downbeat\". However, a reviewer from \"Q\" was the most negative towards the album. He found Saint Etienne's brand of indie disco \"dated\" and bashed the lyrical content as \"a concept album of kitchen-sink dramas about Tony The Milkman and Doris The Housewife\".\n\n\n\n\nfrom \"Side Streets\"\n\n\nfrom \"A Good Thing\"\n\n"}

Her father, John Hughes, is a Canadian of Irish descent, and was the captain of the NCAA champion 1969–70 Cornell University ice hockey team. Her mother, Amy Pastarnack, is Jewish and is a breast cancer survivor. Hughes has supported a variety of causes for breast cancer research and awareness, including Skating for Life, a television special that she promoted on NBC's Today show. She has five siblings. Her older sister, Sarah, is the 2002 Olympic figure skating champion, and her older brother, Matt, became an NYPD officer.\n\nIn 2002, Hughes cowrote a book in Random House's Young Dreamers series, \"I Am a Skater\". On December 18, 2005, she was the subject of a cover story in the Sunday \"New York Times Magazine\".

Foote VC Armoury in Hamilton, Ontario.\n\nThe idea for a full Highland regiment in Hamilton first took shape among the members of the St. Andrew's Society (of which James Chisholm was the long-time treasurer) and the Sons of Scotland (of which, he was also a member). Late in 1902 meetings were held and prominent members of the city's Highland-Canadian community were asked to \"take hold of the matter.\"\n\nJames Chisholm and his partner, William Logie (a captain in the XIII Regiment), took a leading role in organizing locally and in lobbying Ottawa. With the support of local Scottish organizations and clan societies, a deputation was sent to Ottawa bearing a petition to the minister of Militia. The minister, Frederick Borden, was less than enthusiastic about the potential cost and the Highland character of the proposed unit (he wanted the militia in a common uniform). Col. W. D. Otter, whom Logie canvassed for his opinion, was skeptical of the group's ability to \"get either the officers or the men and if we got both [of] these we could not get the money …\"\n\nHamilton's Scottish-Canadian elite moved quickly to fill the ranks of the officer corps and to raise the necessary funds to outfit the regiment in full Highland dress. Those who came forward included: Chisholm, Logie, J. R. Moodie, Walter W. Stewart, E. M. Dalley, Roy Moodie, E. F. Lazier, John Inglis McLaren, and many others from all walks of professional and business life.\n\nA draft letter written by either Chisholm or Logie to local MPs noted that the proposed \"officers are a fine lot of fellows and of good standing and large influence in the community.\" The group obtained (as of 25 March 1903) over 700 names for the rank and file. The \"men are a particularly fine class drawn chiefly from the better class of Scotchmen who own their own homes and have a stake in the community.\" Chisholm and Logie were well-connected within the Liberal Party and maintained steady pressure upon local politicians to forward the group's cause. Chisholm monitored all communications with Borden. When the minister curtly informed a local lawyer to forward his support of the proposed Highland regiment \"through the regular official channel,\" Chisholm promptly asked the minister of Militia for an explanation particularly as Borden had already written to Chisholm indicating that a Highland regiment would be raised. Borden denied having done so but by 17 August 1903 he reported (confidentially to Logie) authorizing the establishment of a Highland regiment. Chisholm, Logie, and the Scottish community were unrelenting and in the end won the day.\n\nThe regiment was formed on 13 September 1903 and gazetted three days later as the 91st Regiment Canadian Highlanders.\n\nIn winning the day, Chisholm and Logie used every reasonable tactic at hand. They were particularly adept at putting pressure at the highest possible level, usually the minister, thus circumventing the normal channels of the Department of Militia and Defence. They continued this newly established tradition after the Regiment was formed. When they wrote to the minister in 1904 concerning an account of $9.55 for plumbing in the officers' quarters, an exasperated senior aide wrote to Logie suggesting that \"your Regiment should come into line . . . .\" He went on to say, \"It would be simply impossible to run this Department if other Regiments went about these matters as yours does.\" Nothing, however, changed. When in 1906 the Department of Customs insisted upon charging duty upon a snuff mull sent to the 91st by the British Argylls, Logie and Chisholm appealed to Chisholm's friend, Adam Zimmerman, MP, who took up their case with the Assistant Commissioner of Customs. A compromise was eventually reached.\n\nChisholm began his service with the 91st on 16 September 1903 as its paymaster holding the rank of honorary captain. For the rest of his life, the Regiment was a major part of his life. Logie served as the Regiment's first commanding officer until 1911 so for a time Chisholm and Logie's office on James Street was an alternate battalion headquarters. Two evenings a week, Chisholm could be found at the James Street Armouries – the 91st was quartered in the recently built addition (designed in part by his architect brother-in-law Walter Wilson Stewart, also a member of the 91st). As well as the matters of weekly administration, there was an endless round of ceremonial functions and Chisholm took (and maintained) a particular interest in the Pipe Band. Finally, the 91st provided a rich social life in the elegant officers' mess, whether the normal course of socializing after weekly parades, full mess dinners, special functions, balls, or the annual celebration of Hogmanay.\n\nDuring the First World War, the regiment acted as a training unit providing 145 officers and 5,207 other ranks for service in the numbered battalions of the C.E.F., especially the 16th, 19th, and the 173rd Highlanders. The latter was broken up for reinforcements, much to the chagrin of its men. Although the Argylls perpetuate both the 19th and the 173rd, it is the former which provides the regiment its most intimate connection with the Great War. The 91st gave the 19th all four of its commanding officers and its Pipe Major, Charles Davidson Dunbar, DCM, a Pipe Major of international renown.\n\nAs part of the 4th Infantry Brigade, 2nd Division, the 19th went from the mud and misery of Salisbury Plain, England, to the mud and blood of Flanders. The battalion saw its first action at Saint-Eloi in April 1916 and went on to serve on the Somme, at Courcelette, Vimy Ridge, Hill 70, Passchendaele, Drocourt-Quéant, and the Pursuit to Mons. In December 1918, its pipe Band played a victorious Canadian Corps across the Rhine and into Germany. The 19th has no official history published, however in 2016, a detailed history was published in the book “It Can’t Last Forever - The 19th Battalion and the Canadian Corps in the First World War”, by David Campbell.\n\nThe 19th Battalion (Central Ontario), CEF was authorized on 7 November 1914 and embarked for Great Britain on 13 May 1915. It disembarked in France on 15 September 1915, where it fought as part of the 4th Infantry Brigade, 2nd Canadian Division in France and Flanders until the end of the war and disbanded on 15 September 1920.\n\nThe 173rd Battalion (Canadian Highlanders), CEF was authorized on 15 July 1916 and embarked for Great Britain on 14 November 1916. It provided reinforcements for the Canadian Corps until 4 January 1917, when its personnel were absorbed by the 2nd Reserve Battalion, CEF. The battalion disbanded on 1 September 1917. The 173rd Battalion was awarded the battle honour .\n\nThe 3rd Battalion, CMGC, CEF, was formed in France on 23 March 1918 from the machine gun companies of the 3rd Canadian Division, the 7th Machine Gun Company, 8th Machine Gun Company, 9th Machine Gun Company and later the 15th Machine Gun Company. It provided machine gun support to the 3rd Canadian Division in France and Flanders until the end of the war and disbanded on 15 November 1920.\n\n Lt. Hugh McKenzie, who had risen from Private to Company Sergeant-Major in Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry before accepting his commission and transferring to the Canadian Machine Gun Corps, was awarded the Victoria Cross posthumously for his actions during Passchendaele. He had already won the Empire's second-highest award for gallantry, the Distinguished Conduct Medal as well as the French Croix de Guerre with the PPCLI. On 30 October 1917, he was a member of the 7th Canadian Machine Gun Company, Canadian Machine Gun Corps, leading a section of four machine guns. Seeing that one of the PPCLI companies was hesitating to advance in the face of a German machine gun position on dominating ground, he handed command of his troops to an NCO and went to rally the men of his old regiment. Lt. McKenzie organized an attack and captured the enemy position. Once on the position, however, he realized that it was itself under dominating enemy machine gun fire from a nearby pillbox. Lt. McKenzie organized parties to capture the pillbox by making both frontal and flanking attacks. He was killed while leading the frontal attack. When the awarding of his Victoria Cross was announced in the London Gazette on 12 February 1918, his surname was misspelled as \"Mackenzie.\"\n\nThe Regiment went through the inter-war years, endured the general militia reorganizations, and prospered. Not only was it large in numbers, (rarely below 400, at times exceeding 600) it benefited from a considerable cadre of First War veterans of all ranks. Tradition continued to play a pre-eminent role and the Regiment enjoyed a visible civic profile through weekly parades on the streets, a close attachment to the city's elite, and the activities of three highly active bands (pipe — still under Dunbar, brass, and bugle).\n\nDetails from the regiment were called out on service before the actual start of the war on 26 August 1939 and placed on active service on 1 September 1939 as The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders (Princess Louise's) (Machine Gun), CASF (Details), for local protection duties.\n\nThe details were formed as a battalion and designated The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders (Princess Louise's), CASF on 15 August 1940. It was redesignated the 1st Battalion, The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders (Princess Louise's) (Machine Gun), CASF on 7 November 1940 and then the 1st Battalion, The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders (Princess Louise's), CASF on 1 February 1941. It served in Jamaica on garrison duty from 10 September 1941 to 20 May 1943, and embarked for Great Britain on 21 July 1943. On 26 July 1944, it landed in France as part of the 10th Infantry Brigade, 4th Canadian Armoured Division, and it continued to fight in North West Europe until the end of the war. The overseas battalion was disbanded on 15 February 1946.\n\nThe Argylls mobilized a battalion for the Canadian Active Service Force in June 1940. Prior to this, there were occasional call outs. Beginning in August 1939, Argylls performed guard duty on the local canal and electrical facility, for example. The problems of active duty were myriad. First World War pattern tunics and the kilt were issued until modern Battle Dress was issued, Ross rifles were the only weapons, and hollow pipes and bricks comprised heavy weapons for the mortar platoon.\n\nThe first months of the war were spent in and around Niagara-on-the-Lake, a dreary round of guard duty on the Welland Canal and local power facilities. There was little training and almost no new equipment. The first Bren light machine guns, for example, arrived in December 1940. But there was time for setting the foundations for excellent administration and for addressing the usual range of problems associated with turning civilians into soldiers. It was during this period that the notorious \"Mad Five\" went AWOL, made their way to the Sunnyside amusement park in Toronto and telegraphed the CO – \"Having a great time. Wish you were here.\" In May 1941 the 1st Battalion entrained for Nanaimo, B.C., where it underwent several tedious months of route marches alternating with inspections.\n\nSeptember 1941 to May 1943 brought a sojourn in the sun – garrison duty in Jamaica. During this period, the reality of war was brought home by the fate of the Winnipeg Grenadiers (which unit the Argylls replaced in Jamaica) in Hong Kong, and of the Royal Hamilton Light Infantry (a sister unit from Hamilton) at Dieppe. Under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Ian Sinclair, the unit received new weapons and modern equipment, improved its administration, and began a complete program of small unit tactics, fitness, and training.\n\nThe men of the 1st Battalion returned to Hamilton in May 1943. In preparation for overseas service, it received a new CO and senior officers, and many warrant officers and NCOs were also replaced. A notable exception was the Regimental Sergeant Major, Peter Caithness McGinlay. By August 1943 the unit had moved to England and joined the l0th Brigade of the 4th Canadian (Armoured) Division. Acting Sergeant John Rennie won a posthumous George Cross in October 1943, dying while shielding others from an exploding grenade during training. Collective training, specialized courses for individuals, and schemes at battalion, brigade and divisional level occupied the unit, now under the command of Lieutenant Colonel J. David Stewart for whom the Argylls' reported a genuine affection. In action, he was described as having an intuitive sense of battle (which could not be taught), cool imperturbability, and a refusal to fight according to preconceived notions.\n\nThe unit's first battles in early August 1944 were small successes fought along the road to Falaise. The first major action, Hill 195 on 10 August, was an unorthodox success; Stewart led the Battalion single file through the darkness of night and German lines to capture this hitherto unassailable strong point. It was an act which historian John A. English has called \"the single most impressive action of Operation Totalize.\" Less than ten days later in the Falaise Gap, a battle group of \"B\" and \"C\" companies of the Argylls, and a squadron of South Alberta Regiment tanks captured St Lambert-sur-Dives and held it for three days against desperate counter-attacks. The action resulted in Major David Vivian Currie of the South Albertas being awarded the Victoria Cross.\n\nOf the experience of battle, Cpl H. E. Carter wrote to his mother on 13 August:\n\n\"\"That life in the front is not fun, not glamorous — it's dirty, and fierce and anyone that says they're not scared is crazy. But I'm not going to talk much about that. We try and keep our spirits up, joke and enjoy yourself under fire and we do an exceptionally good job of it.\"\" That very same day Capt Mac Smith put it best when he wrote to his wife: \"\"The men are simply wonderful. They have done well, and are getting better. They grumble . . . and dig, and advance and dig, and advance. They stand shelling mortaring and occasional bombing, and then stand up in their trenches and ask where the hell the food is.\"\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCanadian Army Historian C.P. Stacey commented that the only time he saw what could be considered a war crime committed by Canadian soldiers was after the very popular Commanding Officer of the Argylls, Lieutenant Colonel F.E. Wigle, was shot dead during the battle of Friesoythe on 14 April 1945, allegedly by a German civilian. Col. Wigle was in fact killed by a German paratrooper at his tactical headquarters located south of Friesoythe.\n\n\"Apparently a rumour was going round that Colonel Wigle had been killed by a civilian sniper; as a result a great part of the town of Friesoythe was set on fire in a mistaken reprisal. This unfortunate episode only came to my notice and thus got into the pages of history because I was in Friesoythe at the time and saw people being turned out of their houses and the houses burned. How painfully easy it is for the business of \"reprisals\" to get out of hand!\"\n\nAs a result, Friesoythe was almost totally destroyed or, as G.L. Cassidy put it, \"The raging Highlanders cleared the remainder of that town as no town has been cleared for centuries, we venture to say.\" One German source estimates that 300 of 355 houses were totally destroyed, for a percentage rate of 84.5. Another source, the Brockhaus Enzyklopaedie, estimated the destruction as high as 90%. The incident is also recounted in Tony Foster's \"Meeting of Generals\".\n\nThrough Moerbrugge, the Scheldt, Kapelsche Veer, and the Hochwald Gap to Friesoythe, the Küsten Canal, and Bad Zwischenahn, the Argylls were successful against the enemy – but there was more. Their losses (267 killed and 808 wounded) were the lowest in the l0th Brigade and their successes constant. Cynicism is a soldier's rightful lot and the Argylls' never lost it. Self-satisfaction came with, and was sustained only by, success – a success sustained despite the successive wholesale turnovers in the rifle companies. Neither quality was lost during ten months of battle. It made them as Capt Claude Bissell once remarked \"\"a happy regiment and a formidable one in action.\"\"\n\nThe 1st Battalion provided the headquarters and one rifle company for the Canadian Berlin Battalion, a composite battalion which represented the Canadian Armed Forces in the British victory celebrations in Berlin in July 1945. The Battalion returned to Hamilton in January 1946 where it was dismissed.\n\nThe Regiment now reverted to its traditional peacetime role with the primary reserves. By the early 1960s the reservoir of veterans had dried up. Numbers shrunk with the various changes in defence policy and equipment became outdated. By the 1980s military policies reversed once more, and the emphasis in national defence shifted back to a focus on war fighting as opposed to civil defence. The 1990s saw the introduction of the Total Force concept in which the Militia was considered an equal partner with the Regular Force in meeting the commitments of the Canadian Forces. While retaining its Highland traditions, and Argylls serve Canadians whether combating natural disasters at home (66 deployed during the 1998 ice storm and many volunteered during the Red River flood) or augmenting UN or NATO deployments abroad. Since the 1950s, Argylls have been deployed on active service augmenting Canada's regular forces in places such as Cyprus, Germany, Bosnia, Kosovo, and Afghanistan.\n\nThe regiment contributed an aggregate of more than 20% of its authorized strength to the various Task Forces which served in Afghanistan between 2002 and 2014.\n\nA strong tradition of reciprocal local support (from 1902 to the present) is exemplified in the 91st Highlanders Athletic Association (which runs the oldest indoor track meet in North America) and the annual Greater Hamilton Tattoo. \n\nCommunity support has been symbolic, material, and artistic. In 1972, Hamilton granted the Argylls the Freedom of the City. The Ontario government has erected heritage plaques to two Argylls (Pipe-Officer Charles Davidson Dunbar, D.C.M. and Acting Sergeant John Rennie, G.C. 1919-1943) on the Armouries' outer walls (the only regiment in the Hamilton-Wentworth, Niagara, Toronto area to be so distinguished). Retired Colours hang in three Hamilton churches and there is a continuing affiliation with Central Presbyterian Church. The local business community contributed generously to the Argyll Regimental Foundation. Local, provincial, and national funds underwrote the project (1984–91) and publication (1996) of \"Black Yesterdays: The Argylls' War\", a pictorial history of the Regiment in the Second World War.\n\nOn 22 October 2014, Corporal Nathan Cirillo of the Argylls was murdered while standing ceremonial guard duty at the National War Memorial (Canada) in Ottawa, Ontario. He was approached from behind and shot several times in the back by an Islamic extremist. The shooter also fired shots at another guard, before traveling to the Parliament Buildings where he was shot dead.\n\nThe regimental Pipes & Drums band has represented the unit at gatherings across the country and internationally i.e. the famed Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo (five appearances since 1950, the most recent of which was in August 2012) and various events in Europe. \n\nA 3/4 Retreat March bagpipe tune 'Lament for the Argylls' was composed by Major Archie Cairns in honour of the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada (Princess Louise's). Major Cairns was Pipe Major of the regimental band during the 1950's and was son of Pipe Major John Knox Cairns who served with the 19th Battalion (Central Ontario), CEF as a piper during the First World War.\n\nPipe Major A.M.

This pattern of dicing was worn by the 93rd Sutherland Highlanders on Kilmarnock bonnets and balmorals from their inception in 1803 to their amalgamation with the Argyllshire Highlanders in 1881, and on glengarries by the Imperial Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders from 1881 to 2006. Affiliate regiments in the Commonwealth also wear this unique pattern of glengarry, including the Calgary Highlanders. Regimental pipers in all Argyll-affiliated units wear plain black glengarries without dicing.\n\n\n\n\nBattle honours in small capitals are for large operations and campaigns and those in lowercase are for more specific battles. Bold type indicates honours emblazoned on the regimental colour.\n\nThe Regimental stand of Colours includes both the sovereign's (Queen's Colour), the senior colour, and the Regimental Colour. The Queen's Colour is based on the National Flag (Maple Leaf), with a crimson circle inscribed with 'The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada (Princess Louise's)' surmounted by a crown emblazoned in the centre. The Regimental Colour is in the regiment's facing colour, yellow, and bears a crimson circle inscribed with 'The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada (Princess Louise's)' surmounted by a crown in the middle. Centred on the crimson circle is a leopard's head, the central device from the regimental cap badge. A wreath of maple leaves and thistles and the regimental motto ring the central design, and encircling the wreath are the 20 battle honours of the regiment selected for emblazonment. In each corner is the personal cypher of Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll, or of Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nStanley Thomas John Fryer (1885–1956), designed the memorial to the Men of the 91st Regiment, Canadian Highlanders, at the Hamilton Armouries, James Street North in 1921.\n\n\n"}

Kono set world records in four different weight classes: lightweight (149 pounds or 67.5 kilograms), middleweight (165 lb or 75 kg), light-heavyweight (182 lb or 82.5 kg), and middle-heavyweight (198 lb or 90 kg).\n\nOf Japanese descent, Kono was born in Sacramento, California, on June 27, 1930. Kono's family was relocated to Tule Lake internment camp in 1942 during World War II. Sickly as a child, the desert air helped Kono's asthma. It was during the relocation that Kono was introduced to weightlifting by neighbors including the late Noboru \"Dave\" Shimoda, a member of the Tule Lake weightlifting and bodybuilding club and brother of actor Yuki Shimoda and his friends, Gotoh, Toda, and Bob Nakanishi. After 3½ years they were released and Kono finished high school at Sacramento High. He later worked for the California Department of Motor Vehicles and attended Sacramento Junior College.\n\nKono was drafted into the U.S. Army in 1950 but was kept home from the Korean War after officials learned of his Olympic potential.\n\nKono was a gold medalist at both the 1952 Summer Olympics and 1956 Summer Olympics, and a silver medalist at the 1960 Summer Olympics under coach Bob Hoffman. Kono won the World Weightlifting Championships six consecutive times from 1953 to 1959 and was a three-time Pan American Games champion; in 1955, 1959, and 1963. A knee injury prevented him from qualifying for the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo and the following year he retired from the sport. He set a total of 26 world records and 7 Olympic records, making him the most accomplished U.S. male weightlifter to date.\n\nKono was also a successful bodybuilder, winning the Fédération Internationale Haltérophile et Culturiste Mr. Universe titles in 1954, 1955, 1957 and 1961. After his retirement he turned to coaching, taking on the Mexican 1968 Summer Olympics and West German 1972 Summer Olympics weightlifting teams before becoming head coach of the United States' Olympic weightlifting team at the 1976 Summer Olympics.\n\nDuring his weightlifting career in the 1960s, he developed a pair of bands to support knees during training. These eventually extended to the elbows and became standard weightlifting equipment. While he was coaching in Germany during the 1970s, his correspondence with Adidas led to the firm's development of low cut weightlifting shoes.\n\nAlong with his weightlifting and bodybuilding titles, Kono was an eight-time Amateur Athletic Union James E. Sullivan Award finalist, an award given annually to the top American amateur athlete. He was also one of the first members of the Hawaii Sports Hall of Fame in 1978. In 1990, Kono received the Association of Oldetime Barbell and Strongmen Highest Achievement Award and was inducted into the United States Olympic Hall of Fame. He was elected to the International Weightlifting Federation Hall of Fame in 1993. In 2005, the International Weightlifting Federation named Kono the \"\"Lifter of the Century\".\"\n\nKono is depicted as part of a mural located at 37 West Philadelphia Street in York, Pennsylvania. This mural was finished in 2000. \n\nKono died on April 24, 2016 in Honolulu, Hawaii from complications of liver disease, aged 85.\n"}

The added mechanical complexity was found to be of limited value, as reflected in their modest production and use.\nThere is one known surviving example: The Deep River Logging No. 7 \"Skookum\" (former Little River No. 126), built by Baldwin Locomotive Works in June 1909.

It is threatened in the wild, but widespread propagation and popularity in cultivation have reduced the demand on wild populations.\n\n\"Cephalocereus senilis\" is a tall, columnar species with clusters of stems that may grow to 5–15 m tall; the individual stems are usually unbranched, being unable to withstand the weight of side branches adequately. The most striking feature is the shaggy coat of long, white hairs suggestive of unkempt hair on an old man. The coat is a particularly striking silvery white on the young cactus; as the plant ages the stem begins to lose its covering. The flowers are red, yellow, or white, though the plant may not flower until 10–20 years old.\n\nThe hairs are modified spines and they make many a plant appear almost snow-white; they serve to protect the plant from frost and sun. However, the hairs are only the radial spines of the cactus; they conceal formidable sharp yellow central spines that belie the inoffensive appearance of the hairy covering.\n\n\"Cephalocereus senilis\" is a very popular cactus in cultivation, grown for its woolly appearance.

He came to prominence in the early 1980s as a member of Dio, and has been a member of Def Leppard since 1992 (replacing Steve Clark after his death.) Campbell has also worked with Thin Lizzy, Whitesnake, Sweet Savage, Trinity, Riverdogs, and Shadow King.\n\nCampbell began playing guitar at the age of 12 with a Telecaster Thinline and Carlsbro Stingray amp. When he was 15, Campbell joined Teaser, which went on to become Sweet Savage, a NWOBHM band. In 1981 they released an EP consisting of four BBC radio sessions and their first single, \"Take No Prisoners\". The band's song \"Killing Time\" was later covered by Metallica as a B-side for their \"The Unforgiven\" single, and was included on Metallica's \"Garage Inc.\" covers album. Campbell left Sweet Savage in early 1983 to join Dio after guitarist Jake E. Lee was offered Randy Rhoads's spot as Ozzy Osbourne's lead guitarist in December 1982.\n\nWhen Campbell joined Dio, Ronnie James Dio, Vinny Appice, and former Rainbow bassist Jimmy Bain had most of the songs to the album \"Holy Diver\" already written. The album was a success and included Dio's biggest hit, \"Rainbow in the Dark\". A concert video, called \"In Concert\", from this tour was released. The band also played at The 4th Monsters of Rock festival at Castle Donington, England in August 1983 and Monsters of Rock, Nurnburg, Germany in 1984.\n\nDio returned to the studio to write and record the follow-up to \"Holy Diver\". This album was called \"The Last in Line\" and charted at No. 23 in the US. \"The Last in Line\", \"We Rock\" and \"Mystery\" all became radio hits. A concert video from this tour called \"A Special From The Spectrum\" was released.\n\nThe follow-up \"Sacred Heart\" was also a success, and managed to peak at No. 29 in the U.S. It featured the hits \"Rock N Roll Children\" and \"Hungry For Heaven\", the second of which was also included on the soundtrack to the film \"Vision Quest\". Also around this time the band recorded the song \"Hide in the Rainbow\" for the \"Iron Eagle\" soundtrack, the last song Campbell would record with Dio. A live EP \"Intermission\" was also released. Craig Goldy played on the disc's only studio song \"Time to Burn\" and over-dubbed the rhythm parts on the live tracks. Campbell and the band parted company in 1986 and he joined Whitesnake. He was replaced by Goldy.\n\nHowever, Campbell had a feud with Dio. In 2003, Campbell said \"[Playing in Dio] never mattered to me – and still doesn't… He's an incredible talent, but he's an awful businessman and way more importantly, one of the vilest people in the industry.\" Campbell later stated that he regretted making this statement. Despite this, Dio stated in an article in Hit Parader that he wished Campbell \"the best.\"\n\nIn 1987, Campbell joined the British hard rock band Whitesnake. Ex-Thin Lizzy and Tygers of Pan Tang guitarist John Sykes wrote and played the lead and rhythm parts on the multiplatinum-selling album simply titled \"Whitesnake\" but was fired by the band's leader, David Coverdale, after recording was completed. Campbell was recruited to replace Sykes in the new, glammed-up Whitesnake Coverdale had put together to conquer MTV and American audiences; other members included Adrian Vandenberg, formerly of Teaser and Vandenberg, Tommy Aldridge of Ozzy Osbourne and Black Oak Arkansas fame, and Rudy Sarzo, who had become hugely successful playing with Ozzy Osbourne and Quiet Riot. While he didn't record an album, he replaced John Sykes' guitar solo on the \"Give Me All Your Love\" 1988 single remix. Campbell was fired from Whitesnake after the band's 1987–1988 world tour.\n\nAfter leaving Whitesnake, Campbell would go on to play on Lou Gramm's second solo album, \"Long Hard Look\". Though Gramm toured in support of the album, Campbell would not join him. Now a free agent in the business, Campbell joined the group Riverdogs after being tapped to produce their first demo. As an official member of the band, he would contribute to their eponymous debut album in 1990. Campbell once again teamed up with Lou Gramm in 1991 to join Gramm's new band Shadow King. After a single eponymous album, one music video, and one live show, Campbell left the group to join Def Leppard. Shadow King soon disbanded following Campbell's departure as Gramm and bassist Bruce Turgon would return to Gramm's former band Foreigner.\n\nIn 1992, Campbell joined the rock band Def Leppard, after the release of their \"Adrenalize\" album. He replaced Steve Clark, who died on 8 January 1991. \n\nAccording to fellow guitarist Phil Collen, Campbell was able to lock right into the position very naturally by simply being himself. Campbell made his debut with the band by playing a show in a Dublin club to approximately 600 people. A week later, 20 April 1992, the band took the stage at the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert, with their new guitarist. They performed, \"Animal\", \"Let's Get Rocked\", and the Queen classic, \"Now I'm Here\", with Brian May.\n\nDespite treatment for Hodgkin's lymphoma, Campbell continued to tour with Def Leppard during summer 2013, and he and the rest of the band have returned to the stage in summer 2014 as co-headliners with Kiss.\n\nIn 2005 Campbell released a solo album produced by Tor Hyams called \"Two Sides of If\", which features cover versions of his favourite blues tunes and one original blues song. Terry Bozzio plays drums on the album. ZZ Top's Billy Gibbons guests on two songs, and Joan Osborne on one other song.\n\nIn mid-2010/early 2011, when Def Leppard was on hiatus, Campbell agreed to join Thin Lizzy, long his favorite band. After the tour, which he said inspired him to play more aggressively, he asked Jimmy Bain and Vinny Appice to get together. With singer Andrew Freeman they recorded \"Heavy Crown\". Bain died before the album was released, and Campbell praised his creativity and his presence, adding that Bain deserved co-writing credits on more of the early Dio songs.\n\nCampbell currently lives in Southern California and has two daughters with ex-wife Julie Campbell. After getting divorced, Campbell married his longtime girlfriend Caitlin Phaneuf on 4 July 2014. He also plays football regularly with Hollywood United F.C., a team composed mostly of celebrities and former professional football players. \n\nOn 10 June 2013 Campbell revealed that he has Hodgkin's lymphoma. Though he announced in November 2013 that he was in partial remission, in June 2014 he took that back saying the statement was premature. He had stem-cell therapy in late 2014, and by October 2015 he announced that while the cancer is still there he was doing much better using immunotherapy, undergoing treatment every three weeks with pembrolizumab.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Meanwhile, Bart purchases an earring, which an outraged Homer confiscates.\n\nHomer and the others are placed on a nuclear submarine. While participating in a military exercise, Homer unintentionally has the captain fired out of a torpedo tube and pilots the submarine into Russian waters, which is seen by the United States government as an attempt to defect. This event creates a political schism between the USA and Russia, leading to the revelation that the Soviet Union in fact never truly dissolved, complete with the Berlin Wall rising from the ground, Soviet troops and tanks appearing on the streets and Vladimir Lenin rising from his tomb in Moscow.\n\nNuclear war is anticipated until the US Navy drops depth charges on Homer's sub, aiming either to destroy it or force it to surface. The consequent explosion causes a pinhole leak in the submarine's hull, but Homer uses Bart's earring to plug the leak and saves the submarine. The vessel surfaces and Homer is taken to be court-martialed, but because the officers on the review committee have done such awful things, Homer's punishment ends up being a mild dishonorable discharge and he immediately forgives Bart, as the earring saved his life.\n\n\"Simpson Tide\" was one of two season nine episodes that was executive produced by Al Jean and Mike Reiss, who together were the showrunners for the third and fourth seasons. Although Jean would later return to run the show the following season, it was the last episode that Reiss received an executive producer credit for. Joshua Sternin and Jeffrey Ventimilia, the episode writers, were working on Jean and Reiss's show \"The Critic\" at the time, and pitched an episode where Homer joins the Naval Reserve. Although the episode is partly based on the film \"Crimson Tide\", the original episode pitch was made before the film was released. After the release of the film, the writers decided to start incorporating things from the movie in the script. In the original draft, Bart sneaked on board the submarine with Homer. They were trying to do it \"for the comedy of it\", but could not get the draft to work, so it was cut. It was difficult for them to figure out how to get the captain off of the sub and they eventually decided to have him shot out of the torpedo tube, which in the DVD commentary, Al Jean says that Steiger claimed that he really did get stuck in a torpedo tube once.\n\nThe Navy drill instructor, along with the announcer to \"Exploitation Theater\", was voiced by Michael Carrington, who had written the season four episode \"Homer's Triple Bypass\" and previously voiced Sideshow Raheem. Bob Denver voices himself in the episode and was directed by Mike Reiss. Rod Steiger guest stars as the captain and was directed by Al Jean.\n\nMany parts of the episode, including the title, refer to the 1995 film \"Crimson Tide\". The captain of the submarine is based on Captain Frank Ramsey, a character in the film who was portrayed by Gene Hackman. The opening couch gag is a recreation of the \"Rocky and Bullwinkle\" animated bumper seen at the end of each Bullwinkle short. The music accompanying it is also adapted from the original music in the bumper. Homer mentions that he and his friends joining the Navy is similar to \"The Deer Hunter\", and the Russian roulette scene from the film is later parodied. Right before the submarine submerges, the song \"In the Navy\" is played and the Village People can be seen dancing. Homer dreams of being on \"the planet of the doughnuts\", which is reminiscent of the film \"Planet of the Apes\". When aboard the submarine, Homer refers to one of the crew members as Mr. Sulu, a reference to the \"\" character. Bart sings a portion of the song \"Do the Bartman\" and Ralph Wiggum comments that it \"is so 1991\", which was when the music video for the song was released. Grampa Simpson claims that he attacked John F. Kennedy on the \"PT-109\" when Kennedy stated \"Ich bin ein Berliner\", leading to Grampa mistaking him for a Nazi.\n\nIn its original broadcast, \"Simpson Tide\" finished 29th in ratings for the week of March 23–29, 1998, with a Nielsen rating of 9.2, equivalent to approximately 9.0 million viewing households. It was the second highest-rated show on the Fox network that week, following \"The X-Files\".\n\nMichael Schiffer, one of the writers of the film \"Crimson Tide\", is said to have enjoyed this episode. Mike Reiss considers the sequence where Russia returns to being the Soviet Union to be \"the nuttiest the show has ever been\". The authors of the book \"I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide\", Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, called it \"a fairly straightforward episode where the biggest laugh comes from Homer being able to talk to penguins and Bart trying to impress his classmates by doing The Bartman.\"\n\n"}

Pasternak spent the Hollywood \"Golden Age\" of musicals at MGM Studios, producing many successful musicals with singing stars like Deanna Durbin, Kathryn Grayson and Jane Powell, as well as swimmer/bathing beauty Esther Williams' films. He produced Judy Garland's final MGM film, \"Summer Stock\", which was released in 1950. Pasternak worked in the film industry for 45 years, from the later silent era until shortly past the end of the classical Hollywood cinema in the early 1960s.\n\nHe was born to a Jewish family in Szilágysomlyó, Austria-Hungary (now Șimleu Silvaniei, Romania). His father was a town clerk and Pasternak was one of eleven children.\n\nIn 1920, he emigrated to the US as a teenager and stayed with an uncle in Philadelphia. He worked in a factory, punching holes in leather belts, and did a variety of other jobs. He also studied acting in New York.\n\nIn 1922, Pasternak gained a job as a busboy at Paramount's Astoria studio in Queens, New York City at $8 a week; after a year he was head waiter and making $120 a week, including tips. He quit in 1923 to become an assistant for director Allan Dwan and worked his way up from fourth assistant at $16 a week to first assistant at $75 a week.\n\nHe worked as an assistant director on \"The Phantom of the Opera\" (1925) and \"It's the Old Army Game\" (1926). \n\nHe tried directing, a two-reeler with El Brendel. It was seen by Wesley Ruggles who offered him a job at Universal Studios as an assistant director at $35 a week.\n\nIn 1928, Universal sent Pasternak to Europe as an associate producer to work on German-language films for the international market. Pasternak produced a series of movies directed by, and often starring, William Dieterle: \"The Brandenburg Arch\" in 1929 with Paul Henckels and June Marlowe; \"Triumph of Love\" and \"Silence in the Forest\" also in 1929; \"Rustle of Spring\" and \"Ludwig II, King of Bavaria\", a drama, both in 1930, and \"One Hour of Happiness\" in 1931. Pasternak also produced three films directed by Edmund Heuberger and starring Eddie Polo: \"Secret Police\" (1929), \"Witnesses Wanted\" (1930), and \"Of Life and Death\" (1930).\n\nOther Pasternak films included \"The Daredevil Reporter\" (1929), written by Billy Wilder, starring Eddie Polo and directed by Ernst Laemmle; \"Next, Please!\" (1930) directed by Erich Schönfelder; \"Two People\" (1930) with Charlotte Susa directed by Erich Waschneck; \"The Great Longing\" (1930), directed by Steve Sekely; \"Seitensprünge\" (\"Infidelity\", 1931); \"Ich geh' aus und Du bleibst da\" (\"The Inconstant: I go out and you stay here\" in German and French, 1931); \"Der Storch streikt\" (\"The Stork Strikes\", 1931); \"The Night Without Pause\" (1931) with Sig Arno co-directed by Andrew Marton; \"Bobby geht los\" (\"Bobby goes off\", 1931); \"A Tremendously Rich Man\" (1932); \"Five from the Jazz Band\" (1932) directed by Erich Engel; and \"The Rebel\" (1932), a historical epic directed by Curtis Bernhardt, Edwin H. Knopf and star Luis Trenker.\n\nPasternak shot \"Secret Agent\" (1932) and \"Johnny Steals Europe\" (1932) both with Harry Piel, then \"A Tremendously Rich Man\" (1932) with director Steve Sekely, \"Die unsichtbare Front\" (\"The Invisible Secretary\", 1933) and \"Pardon, tévedtem\" (\"Excuse me, I was wrong\", 1933). (Note translations are basic, not officially approved titles.)\n\nWhen Hitler came to power in Germany, Pasternak moved to Hungary. There he did a series of films starring Franciska Gaal: \"Romance in Budapest\" (1933) with Sekely (also shot in German as \"Scandal in Budapest\"); \"A Precocious Girl\" (1934), directed by Max Neufeld and Richard Eichberg; \"Spring Parade\" (1934); \"Peter\" (1934) directed by Henry Koster; \"Little Mother\" (1934) (later remade in Hollywood as \"Bachelor Mother\"); and \"Catherine the Last\" (1936).\n\nUniversal recalled Pasternak, giving him a $500 a week contract. He brought back Henry Koster with him and the two men set about making the sort of movie they had in Europe. \"No one's going to get sick or die in my pictures,\" Pasternak said at the time. \"That's no form of entertainment.\"\n\nAfter seeing her in the short \"Every Sunday\" (1936), Pasternak cast 14-year-old Canadian singer Deanna Durbin in \"Three Smart Girls\" (also 1936), directed by Koster. The film became a huge hit and reputedly saved Universal from bankruptcy. He followed it with two more Durbin films, \"One Hundred Men and a Girl\" (1937), directed by Koster, and \"Mad About Music\" (1938), directed by Norman Taurog. In 1938, Pasternak did a comedy, \"Youth Takes a Fling\", then was back with Durbin for \"That Certain Age\" (1938), and \"Three Smart Girls Grow Up\" (1939). In all, Pasternak made ten films with Durbin.</ref>\n\nPasternak soon discovered another talented soprano, Gloria Jean, who began her own series in 1939, starting with \"The Under-Pup\" (1939). He produced Durbin again in \"First Love\" (1939). He had a large hit with the comedy Western \"Destry Rides Again\" (1939), starring Marlene Dietrich and James Stewart, which helped revitalise Dietrich's career.\n\nPasternak alternated between the three female stars – with Durbin he did \"It's a Date\" (1940), \"Spring Parade\" (1940) (a remake of his 1934 film), \"Nice Girl?\" (1940) and \"It Started with Eve\" (1941). With Jean he did \"A Little Bit of Heaven\" (1940), a sort of sequel to \"The Under-Pup\". Finally, with Dietrich he did \"Seven Sinners\" (1940) (with John Wayne) and \"The Flame of New Orleans\" (1941).\n\nIn June 1941, after finishing \"Eve\", Pasterrnak left Universal. Although he still had two years to run on his contract, he had \"differences of opinion\" with the studio's management, and by mutual consent the parties elected to terminate the contract.\n\nIn June 1941, Pasternak announced he had joined Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer as a producer for a reported $3,500 a week. Several studios had been interested in placing him under contract, but Louis B. Mayer wanted Pasternak and allowed the producer several concessions. Mayer assigned young soprano Kathryn Grayson, who had only made one film for MGM, to Pasternak's unit so that he might make her into a star like Durbin. Pasternak later sat on the executive committee and came to be regarded as one of the three most important persons in the company, alongside Louis B. Mayer and Vice President Sam Katz. \n\nAt MGM he continued to produce operetta films, starting with \"Seven Sweethearts\" (1942) starring Grayson, and \"Presenting Lily Mars\" (1943) starring Judy Garland. Both films were successful at the box-office. Pasternak followed these with \"Thousands Cheer\" (1943) with Grayson and Gene Kelly, which was a huge hit; \"Song of Russia\" (1944), a musical which later became problematic because of its pro-Russian viewpoint; \"Two Girls and a Sailor\" (1944) with June Allyson, Van Johnson and Gloria De Haven, and \"Music for Millions\" (1944) with Allyson and Margaret O'Brien. All these films were hits.\n\nPasternak was responsible for Esther Williams' first proper vehicle, \"Thrill of a Romance\" (1945), co-starring Van Johnson; it made over $3 million in profits. Similarly well received by audiences was \"Anchors Aweigh\" (1945) with Grayson, Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra. Pasternak also made several non-musical romantic comedy hits, including \"Her Highness and the Bellboy\" (1945) with Hedy Lamarr and Robert Walker, and \"No Leave, No Love\" (1946) with Johnson. However, around this time Pasternak mostly specialized in musicals: \"Two Sisters from Boston\" (1946) with Grayson and Allyson was a box-office success, as was, \"Holiday in Mexico\" (1946) with Walter Pidgeon and Jane Powell in her debut for MGM. However, \"The Unfinished Dance\" (1947) with O'Brien and Cyd Charisse lost over a million dollars - the first Pasternak MGM film to do so. \"This Time for Keeps\" (1947) with Esther Williams, was profitable. \n\nIn 1948 Pasternak had very mixed results. \"Three Daring Daughters\" in 1948 with Powell and Jeanette MacDonald, while popular, lost money. Pasternak also tried his first drama in the U.S. with \"Big City\" (1948), starring O'Brien, which was a big money loser. More popular were the 1948 musicals \"On an Island with You\" with Williams; \"A Date with Judy\" with Jane Powell, Wallace Beery and Elizabeth Taylor; and \"Luxury Liner\" again with Powell. Pasternak unfortunately had a big flop with the Sinatra-Grayson musical \"The Kissing Bandit\" that same year, which lost MGM over $2 million. \n\nPasternak bounced back with \"In the Good Old Summertime\" (1949) with Garland and Johnson, and introduced Mario Lanza in \"That Midnight Kiss\" with Kathryn Grayson, which was a solid hit. \"Nancy Goes to Rio\" with Powell, a remake of \"It's a Date\", made a minor loss. In 1950, \"The Toast of New Orleans\" with Grayson was a solid hit, as was \"Duchess of Idaho\" with Williams. Pasternak produced the final Judy Garland film at MGM, \"Summer Stock\" in 1950, co-starring Gene Kelly, and then had the biggest hit of his career to date with \"The Great Caruso\" (1951), a vehicle for Mario Lanza which made almost $4 million in profit for the studio. After the popular \"Rich, Young and Pretty\" (1951) with Powell, Pasternak made a film noir with Mickey Rooney, \"The Strip\" (1951) which flopped. \n\nMore typical was \"Skirts Ahoy!\" (1952) with Esther Williams; \"The Merry Widow\" (1952) with Lana Turner and Fernando Lamas; and \"Because You're Mine\" (1952) with Lanza. \"Small Town Girl\" (1953) with Powell lost money, as did \"Latin Lovers\" (1953) with Turner and Ricardo Montalban, but \"Easy to Love\" (1953) with Williams and Johnson was another hit.\n\nPasternak again tried a drama, this time with Turner, \"Flame and the Flesh\" (1954), but it was not a notable success. However, \"The Student Prince\" (1954) with Ann Blyth and Edmund Purdom miming to Mario Lanza singing, was a huge success. Pasternak did \"Hit the Deck\" (1955) with Powell, Vic Damone and Debbie Reynolds, which was popular but failed to recoup its cost. \"Athena\" in 1955 with Powell, Reynolds, Damone and Purdom, was a straight out flop. \"Meet Me in Las Vegas\" (1955) with Charisse was well received, but failed to recoup its cost. \n\nThe industry was changing, and musicals were becoming increasingly unprofitable for MGM. Conversely, a tough biopic Pasternak produced about Ruth Etting, \"Love Me or Leave Me\" (1955), starring Doris Day and James Cagney, was a hit. In 1956, Pasternak published his memoir, \"Easy the Hard Way\". Pasternak had two big flop musicals, \"The Opposite Sex\" (1956), a remake of \"The Women\" with Allyson, and \"Ten Thousand Bedrooms\" (1957) with Dean Martin. Also unsuccessful was the Jean Simmons comedy \"This Could Be the Night\" (also 1957). It was then time for a change.\n\nIn April 1956, Pasternak left MGM after 14 years. He set up the independent production company Euterpe with Sam Katz. They made an agreement with Columbia to finance their films, and announced several projects: \"The Chiselers\" starring Alan Ladd; \"Three Blondes\"; \"Gidget\", based on the novel by Frederick Kohner; and \"Nora\", an original screenplay by Felix Jackson. However Euterpe and Columbia could not come to terms and dissolved their agreement in November 1957.\n\nPasternak set up Euterpe back at MGM. He was an immediate success, turning out four hits in a row: a highly regarded thriller, \"Party Girl\" (1958), with Robert Taylor and Cyd Charisse; two comedies with David Niven: \"Ask Any Girl\" (1959) with Shirley MacLaine and \"Please Don't Eat the Daisies\" (1960) with Day; and a teen comedy, \"Where the Boys Are\" (1960), which introduced a group of new stars: George Hamilton, Dolores Hart, Yvette Mimieux, Connie Francis, Jim Hutton, and Paula Prentiss. \n\nIn the 1960s, Pasternak produced a mix of hits and misses. He reunited Hutton and Prentiss in \"The Horizontal Lieutenant\" (1962) but it was not as popular as \"Boys\". Then he had a failure with \"Billy Rose's Jumbo\" (1962) starring Day, which lost almost $4 million. However, Pasternak responded with a comedy starring Glenn Ford, \"The Courtship of Eddie's Father\" (1963) that was a hit; the film featured Ronny Howard (later known as Ron Howard), showing the producer still retained an ability to discover young performers. Less successful was \"A Ticklish Affair\" (1963) with Shirley Jones and \"Looking for Love\" (1964) with Francis and Hutton. He did a poorly-received musical with Ann-Margret (in a part turned down by Doris Day), \"Made in Paris\" (1966), then made two Elvis Presley films co-starring Shelley Fabares, \"Girl Happy\" (1965) and \"Spinout\" (1966), both of which made money. He also did a Natalie Wood comedy \"Penelope\" (1966), which was a box-office disappointment.\n\nPasternak produced the 1965, 1966 and 1967 Academy Awards. In 1966 he was honored with a retrospective of his work.\n\nIn 1967, Pasternak left MGM and became affiliated with 20th Century Fox, but made only one film for Fox, \"The Sweet Ride\" (1968). Pasternak had a stroke before filming, and \"Sweet Ride\" would turn out to be his last film. In 1968, he was also stricken with Parkinson's disease. He recovered slightly two years later but made no more films. He said at the time: \"I am proud that I have produced 105 pictures and not one of them is adults only.\"\n\nIn 1980, he estimated his films had earned $400 million. \"If I had a percentage I'd be the richest man in town,\" he said. His career as a film producer spanned 40 years and earned him two Oscar nominations and three Golden Globe Award nominations. He retired in 1968.\n\nPasternak is the father of Michael Joseph Pasternak, the radio disk jockey known as Emperor Rosko; Jeff Pasternak, a playwright and songwriter; and Peter Pasternak, a music industry professional. He was married to Dorothy.\n\nPasternak also authored a lovely and knowledgable cookbook entitled Cooking with Love and Paprika, distributed by Random House in 1966. The book is peppered with stories of dinner parties, entertaining tips, his life history, and delicious Hungarian recipes.\n\nJoe Pasternak died in Beverly Hills, California from complications arising from Parkinson's disease six days before his 90th birthday. He is interred in the Hillside Memorial Park Cemetery in Culver City, California. For his contribution to the motion picture industry, Joe Pasternak has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1541 N. Vine Street. David Chandler (writer) recorded and wrote the autobiography of Joe Pasternak, \"Easy the Hard Way\", published by G.P. Putnam's Sons, New York 1956.\n\n"}
{"id": "1878246", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1878246", "title": "Arch Rivals", "text": "Arch Rivals\n\nArch Rivals is a basketball arcade game released by Midway in 1989. Billed by Midway as \"A Basket Brawl\", the game features two-on-two full court basketball games in which players are encouraged to punch opposing players and steal the ball from them.\n\n\"Arch Rivals\" allows players to select from a variety of fictional teams (although arcade operators can change the team names to reflect real ones) and players. One playable character, \"Tyrone\" was also featured in the animated \"Power Team\" segments of the television series \"Video Power\". Home versions of the game were released for the Nintendo Entertainment System, the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive as well as the Game Gear. Emulated versions of the game were included in the compilations \"Midway Arcade Treasures 2\", \"Midway Arcade Treasures Deluxe Edition\", and \"Midway Arcade Origins\".\n\nThe game has been considered a forerunner to Midway's popular arcade basketball game, \"NBA Jam\".\n\nGames generally follow standard basketball rules; a full game consists of four quarters, with four minutes each. Each team has two players, and the objective of the game is to outscore the opponent until the final buzzer sounds. A player can call for his teammate to pass him the ball or to shoot it in this battle royale.\nIf the game results in a tie after four quarters, multiple sudden death overtime periods are added, in which case whoever scores the next basket will win the game. Every overtime period is one minute. If, however, no score occurs after overtime the procedure repeats.\n\nThe difference between \"Arch Rivals\" and other basketball titles is the ability to freely punch an opposing player without penalty and steal the ball away. The referee will only call shot clock violations. Also unique to the game are various on-court hazards such as soda cans and candy wrappers thrown onto the floor. If a ballhandler steps on those, he falls onto the floor allowing his opponent to steal the ball from him. Players could also fall over the referee in the same way as the objects on the floor, as well as steal the ball with a maneuver called the \"flying leap\" where the player would jump forwards at the opposition ball carrier. If the maneuver missed, the player would roll along the floor. If successful, the player would tackle the opposition holding the ball. In the Arcade version the \"flying leap\" would pull the opposition's shorts down, revealing the opponent's underwear. On home ports of the game, these graphics were left out.\n\nThere are eight playable characters, each with a unique characteristic. They are:\n\n\nThe teams in \"Arch Rivals\" are selected at random, with Player 1 playing as the home team and Player 2 (or the computer) as the away team. The teams in the arcade version are Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, Denver, Natural High and Brawl State.\n\nAlso, the game could be set up to reflect the names and colors of local teams through the custom \"Hometown Heroes\" feature.\n\nWhenever a basket is scored (for either two or three points), there are many random scenes that may be played. One scene has the coach yelling at his players, another features players from the other team groaning in disgust, and two scenes have cheerleaders shouting: \"Go team go!\" or \"Yay team!\"\n\nSometimes, the backboard can be shattered with a rim-rattling slam dunk. This effect was later carried over to the much better-known \"NBA Jam\".\n\nThe TV studio depicted in the game is that of the fictional WIDB-TV. It is shown after the end of each period and also at halftime. In addition, after the first and third quarters plus overtime, a \"Coaches Corner\" screen also appears, providing tips on how to become a better player. The cheer-leading squad performs the halftime show. The final stats are shown at the end of the game, showing how many points the human-controlled player scored, and also the number of steals and rebounds, and shooting percentage.\n\nThe four home ports of the game have lower-quality graphics than the arcade version, due to being released on 8 and 16-bit systems. The NES version of the game contains a glitch where a 3-point dunk can be achieved. The Sega Genesis version received poorer reception due to a glitch where almost 95% of shots taken from anywhere on the court would result in a basket.\n\nIt was also included on \"Midway Arcade Treasures 2\" for the PlayStation 2, Xbox and GameCube, \"Midway Arcade Treasures Deluxe Edition\" for the PC, and \"Midway Arcade Origins\" for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.\n\n\"Sinclair User\" and \"Computer and Video Games\" published positive reviews of \"Arch Rivals\", while commenting that the game was best suited to fans of the sport.\n\n\n"}

A double-disc deluxe edition was released on 3 May 2010 by Heavenly Records.\n\nFollowing two relatively uniform albums, \"Good Humor\" and \"Sound of Water\", \"Finisterre\" contains a wide mixture of sounds and styles (as would its successor \"Tales from Turnpike House\"). The album returned to the inclusion of vocal interludes between songs as last heard on their album \"So Tough\" and a more angular, electronic sound, particularly on tracks such as \"Action\", \"Shower Scene\" and \"New Thing\". \"Language Lab\" and \"Summerisle\" recall the ambient style of \"Sound of Water\", while \"Stop and Think It Over\" would not have been out of place on \"Good Humor\" or its predecessor, \"Tiger Bay\".\n\nThe vocal interludes were supplied by Michael Jayston's narration as featured in the film released to accompany the album, also called \"Finisterre\". The film was directed by Paul Kelly and Kieran Evans and was born out of visuals used to accompany certain tracks from the album shown during their live shows. The film debuted at a sold-out show in October 2002 at the Royal Festival Hall on London's Southbank, and was re-released to select screens in 2005. It is currently available on DVD. The album sleeve features a photograph of the East London tower block Ronan Point shortly after it collapsed in 1968 with the loss of four lives.\n\nNitsuh Abebe of Pitchfork Media scored the album 7.6 out of ten and wrote that \"[t]he big comeback on \"Finisterre\"s part is that they're tugging those strings again, confidently\", citing \"B92\" as a highlight. However, Abebe criticised \"Action\" and \"New Thing\" as \"just begging for the bigger kick drums that would turn them into flat-out stompers.\"\n\nPreviously unreleased tracks are \"So Mystified\", \"White Dress\", \"Stop and Think It Over\" (Kid Loco Mix). \"There There My Brigadier\" was never released commercially, but given away on a promotional single at a \"Doctor Who\" convention in 2003 for a later-abandoned album of Dr Who-related remixes.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1878256", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1878256", "title": "1632 series", "text": "1632 series\n\nThe 1632\" series, also known as the 1632-verse or Ring of Fire\" series, is an alternate history book series and sub-series created, primarily co-written, and coordinated by Eric Flint and published by Baen Books. The series is set in 17th-century Europe, in which the small fictional town of Grantville, West Virginia, in the year 2000 was sent to the past in central Germany in the year 1631, during the Thirty Years' War.\n\nAs of 2015, the series has five published novels propelling the main plot and over ten published novels moving several subplots and threads forward. The series also includes fan-written, but professionally edited, collaborative material which are published in bi-monthly magazine titled \"The Grantville Gazettes\" and some collaborative short fictions.\n\nIn terms of the history of Time Travel literature, the \"1632\" series can be considered an extension and modification of the basic idea dating back to Mark Twain's \"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court\", in which a 19th-century American engineer, finding himself in 5th-century England, is able—all by himself—to introduce into the past society the full range of his time's technologies. In Flint's version, a whole modern community is transplanted into the past, in possession of a considerable amount of the material and written resources of modern society—making their success in changing the past more plausible.\n\nThe \"1632\" series began with Flint's stand alone novel \"1632\" (released February 2000). It is, excepting the lead novel and the serialized e-novel \"The Anaconda Project\" (2007), virtually all collaboratively written, including some \"main works\" with multiple co-authors. However, Flint has mentioned contracts with the publisher for at least two additional solo novels he has in planning on his website. Flint, whose bibliography is dominated by collaborative work, claims that this approach encourages the cross-fertilization of ideas and styles, stimulating the creative process and preventing stale, formulaic works.\n\nAs stated in the first \"Grantville Gazette\" and on his site, Flint's novel \"1632\" was an experiment wherein he explores the effect of transporting a mass of people through time.\n\n\"1632\" occurs in the midst of the Thirty Years' War (1618–1648). The plot situation allows pragmatic, American, union-oriented, political thought to grind against the authoritarian, religion-driven societies of an unconsolidated Holy Roman Empire barely out of the Middle Ages. Flint explores examples of suffering due to the petty politics of self-aggrandizement and self-interest on the one hand, and the irreconcilable differences of the schism in Christianity such as the Protestant Reformation and the Counter-Reformation on the other. Despite the fact that the shift puts Grantville in May 1631 initially, because of the ongoing war and the primitive transportation networks of the day Grantville's arrival has something of a delayed impact, so the bulk of the book's action takes place in 1632, hence the name.\n\nThe series was initially continued with two collaborative works that were more or less written concurrently: \"1633\" (with best selling novelist David Weber) and an anthology called \"Ring of Fire\" (with other established science-fiction writers, including long, \"deep background\" stories by both Weber and Flint).\n\nOverall, the narratives are not oriented on one group of protagonists with a strong lead character, but instead are carried by an ensemble cast—though most books or short stories do have several strong characters who carry the action and plot forward. Flint had intended from the outset that the whole town would be the collective protagonist; a reflection of his philosophy that historic forces are not centered in the main on the actions of one or two key individuals, but on the many small independent actions of the many going about their daily lives and coping as best they can.\n\nBy late in \"1632\", the New United States-led coalition of the Confederated Principalities of Europe had become the arsenal and financier (through Jewish connections of real historical interest) for Swedish King Gustavus Adolphus (the displaced Americans' intervention in history already had the effect of preventing Gustavus from being killed in the Battle of Lützen, as happened in the \"original\" history). This leads the scheming Cardinal Richelieu, who'd been previously financing him to spite and weaken the Habsburgs, to turn on the Swedes. Various books from up-time Grantville, especially history books, had found avid readers amongst Europe's ruling elites, changing the plans and strategies of major players of the time. The readers, not understanding the chaotic nature of events (i.e., trivial-seeming changes can have large effects, and vice versa), often believe that these histories give them a strong idea of how they can guide events in a different direction. The \"players\" sent back through time have no intention of strongly guiding events, but understand how key forces (democracy, sanitation, medicine, egalitarianism, etc.) affect things in the long run to the betterment of mankind, and intend to promote and spread those even if they themselves are not \"in control\" of what results.\n\nRichelieu forms a four-way alliance, the League of Ostend, to oppose the New United States, Gustavus' expeditionary army, and allied princes of the German states. After the first book, the series begins multiple plot lines or story threads reflecting this independence of action by a multitude of characters. The sequel \"1633\" spreads the Americans out geographically over Central Europe. Next, the novel \"\", and the first of the anthologies called the \"Grantville Gazettes\" introduced new strong characters. The former begins what is called the \"South European thread\", and some of the stories in the latter and \"Ring of Fire\" began the Eastern European thread (Austria-Hungary northwards to Poland).\n\nCo-author of \"1633\", New York Times best-selling author David Weber was contracted for no less than five books in the series in what is called the \"Central European thread\" or \"Main thread\" of the series, but there was a delay before the two authors synchronized their schedules to write that next mainline sequel, \"\", released in May 2007.\n\nWithout waiting for Weber, other sequels such as \"\", \"\", and the \"Grantville Gazettes\" continue in one thread or another with in-depth looks at societal ramifications from technology, religion, and social unrest as Europe deals with the outlandish ideas of Grantville's influential presence, to machinations of Europe's elites trying to maintain their hold on power, or leverage off of Grantville-triggered events or knowledge for reasons of self-interest.\n\n1632 \"plot threads\" refers to the overall story arcs or sequences within the \"1632\" series. Flint has pointed out that he thinks in terms of plot threads, not of major protagonists. But most web chatter revolves around geographical \"spheres of influence\", locations, or where protagonists have a general effect. As a series focused on displaying a believable neohistory given the series beginning—\"of being as realistic as possible\" given the initial series premises—the two approaches both \"fail equally\" in covering all the cases by any strict measure, because the character set who is starring in one thread will almost invariably appear in one or more other story lines as a personal departure point for that character's personal biographical history, or as a supporting role for events depicted in a book mainly covering events in another thread.\n\n\"Real history is messy,\" Flint has written in the foreword to \"Ring of Fire\" in explaining why he took the unusual step of opening a universe consisting of a single novel at the time into a shared universe. A former union organizer and a socialist, Flint disdains the Great Man theory of history, where big figures of heroic scope define events, but instead lays claim throughout the entirety of works in the series, that history is the small actions of common men acting in their own self-interest who in the aggregate determine historical forces and force events and responses from those in power, who might lay some claim to being a giant of history—the statesmen and power brokers who dot the \"I\"s and cross the \"T\"s and add occasional curlicues to the historic march of events—riding the torrent far more often than leading it in Churchillian or Rooseveltian fashion. That some persons of that mold have existed is not disputed, but that the narrative report that makes up historical reporting tends to overstate their impact and role, is Flint's theme.\n\nNo matter what approach one takes to classifying a plot sequence in the series—be it geographical or character-based—the key element of the series to comprehend is that the events depicted in its now voluminous works are not taking place in a vacuum, but in most cases are concurrent with developments in other parts of the European center.\n\nThe Central European thread or more correctly, the Central and Southwest Central European thread, is the main plot thread of the series. It concerns events in the region from west to east of the Kingdom of England and Kingdom of Scotland, Northern France, the Spanish Netherlands, French Netherlands, and the Dutch Republic, and the whole of western Germany eastwards to Brandenburg and the Electorate of Saxony, and southerly to the northern reaches of Bavaria. Bavaria proper, Switzerland, Austria, Bohemia, and points easterly and north are properly geographically part of the Eastern European thread.\n\nThe Southern European thread, or Western South Europe and South Central European thread, or perhaps more appropriately, the South-Central and Southwestern European thread, involves characters introduced in the short story \"To Dye For\" by Mercedes Lackey but the thread plot action proper continued in the second published novel sequel of the series, the best-selling \"\" and its direct sequel, \"\", both co-written by Flint and Andrew Dennis. The main characters are, in part, Lackey's The Stone Family, combined with Flint's Sharon Nichols and Larry Mazzare.\n\nThe Eastern European thread is taken to be east of the East Central European thread, the latter of which may be understood as the baseline through eastern parts of modern-day Germany, Austria, and western Hungary. The first fiction written within this thread was the novelette \"The Wallenstein Gambit\" and the prequel short stories leading up to it, all published in Ring of Fire, but subsequent long fiction planned in the setting had to await authors' scheduling issues.\n\nDavid Weber and Eric Flint in 2002 (writing \"1633\" and \"Ring of Fire\") originally contracted together and with Baen's Books to co-write five \"main series\" books—the first two and perhaps some as yet unrevealed others being known as \"the naval thread\". When working on the long-delayed \"\" novel and with the prolonged and ongoing demand for the series sequels, and considering the already-experienced delays imposed by the difficulty of getting schedules between themselves synchronized (it took three planned \"windows of opportunity\" before one worked in \"The Baltic War\") well enough for the two to have the three to six months or so needed to collaborate successfully, the two decided to alter their original planning and spin off a new thread—one based on the United States of Europe as a naval power. The thread is continued in \"1636: Commander Cantrell in the West Indies\", which is the story of the United States of Europe's naval task force, operating in the Caribbean Sea and surrounding waters, and the various forces it comes into contact with (including the surviving remnants of the Dutch naval force destroyed in \"1633\").\n\nThis agreement for Weber to leave aside European threads likely will follow up foreshadowings of overt dislike evinced by various Grantville natives for both the African slave trade and the Amerindian encounters with colonizing Europeans—and Flint has already written a very sympathetic, two-volume alternate history from the American Native's viewpoint in his \"Arkansas Wars\" series—and he'd written similar foreshadowings into the series' earlier works that were spun into pro-democracy and anti-anti-Semitic social themes now manifesting in the series in the Eastern Europe thread in particular, as well as an overall, muted sub-theme. This revised author's decision released a logjam of backup of other novels in the series, so that since rehashing their arrangement, \"1632\" series books have been released regularly every 4–6 months.\n\nStories in 1632 Slushpile regarding obtaining strategically important materials and some which have reached publication in regard to the Essen Steel Corporation and Essen Chemical are foreshadowing activities (mining chromium for one) in North America, and others are pursuing latex rubber in South America. In addition, the three books contracted between Flint and David Weber will in part involve expeditions sent by Gustavus and Mike Stearns to American shores.\n\nTwo novels focused on the Americas were initially serialized in \"The Grantville Gazette\" magazine: \n\nThe first full novel in the Americas and Asia thread was published in 2013: \"\" (December 2013) by Iver Cooper.\n\n\nFans are encouraged to contribute to the series though an online message board known as Baen's Bar. The entire \"Grantville Gazette\" and large portions of the \"Ring of Fire\" anthology, both of which are considered canonical, are paid, fan-written (albeit edited by Flint) works, and have directly contributed material to the main novels. The author also worked with other established authors to develop new stories and plot lines for further novels which are also published in the two \"Ring of Fire\" anthologies.\n\n\"Ring of Fire\" has several levels of meaning: First it is the eponymous reference to what the townfolk themselves (and the few outside German witnesses) have come to call the observed phenomenon of their time-space juxtaposition. Secondly, it is a disparaging reference to the effects on the population of Germany at large, suffering under the war's environment outside American-controlled territory, used by Mike Stearns addressing a town meeting:\n\"1632\" is the first novel in the alternate history \"1632\" series. It is a science fiction novel originally released in November 2000, but atypically, continues to actually increase in quarterly sales, as do most of the sequels. Originally a single stand-alone story, the novel is now the first of an open-ended series with over twenty-six works of all kinds including e-published only works (e-books) of which twelve are standard trade printed books. Three (of eighteen of the bi-monthly \"Gazettes\", and counting) are the printed canonical \"Grantville Gazettes\" (\"I\", \"II\", and \"III\", the first of which is almost entirely longer fiction Flint couldn't put in the already lengthy \"Ring of Fire\" shared universe collection, the de facto first sequel antedating collaborative work on \"1633\", and of which two have been best sellers), published in print, and an additional, rapidly growing number of related \"Grantville Gazettes\" e-books or e-zines (not in print).\n\nIn writing \"1632\", Flint's web forum Mutter of Demons at Baen's Bar was soon taken over by exploratory posts as captivated readers commented on the E-ARC released book, creating a ground swell of interest (\"Internet buzz\") in the months before its hardcover release. So strong was the response, especially after the release of the printed work, that a new 1632 Tech Manual sub-forum was created for discussions about it in early 2000, for the discussions had also spilled over into Weber's Bu-ships tech forum, and Weber joined the bandwagon by suggesting a sequel was in order. In the event, the two co-wrote \"1633\" and collaborated further on integrating the short fiction (much of it unsolicited) into the de facto \"Ring of Fire\" sequel. It was followed by two other related forums: 1632 Slush and 1632 Comments, within the next two years.\n\n\"The Grantville Gazettes\" are a series of short stories in the collaborative fiction experiment, which started life as an online serialized magazine with an inconsistent and sporadic publication history. After the death of Jim Baen and with the publication of \"Grantville Gazette X\" by Baen Books, the last under contract with Baen, the \"Gazettes\" were again reconstituted as a subscription e-zine, now published regularly at six per year (bi-monthly) and paying above standard rates for submissions. They are a \"boiler room\" powering the collaborative synergy by the people involved with the 1632 Tech Manual and have developed into a repository for new ideas and themes in the series, although most explore the personal experiences of minor characters in the series or examine in depth some aspect (e.g. a multi-part serial explores and details Grantville's impact on public health in general, and the establishment of twin teaching hospitals as a joint project of the University of Jena and Grantville's new hospital, the Lahey Clinic). In general, the anthologies in the series depict deep background canonical to future tales, but which are not in the mainstream \"action\" of the novels focus. A group of stories have on several occasions produced a new plot thread. As of the end of 2012, there are now 42 volumes of the \"Grantville Gazettes\", most of them available in Amazon Kindle editions as well as some other electronic formats.\n\nThe \"Gazettes\" began as an experimental, semi-professional, online magazine featuring fan fiction and nonfiction edited by Flint and (eventually) a volunteer editorial board. At the time of Jim Baen's death in the summer of 2006 ten \"Grantville Gazettes\" were under contract and they had (with some fits and starts) settled into a new version roughly and irregularly three times a year. Baen's production staff was somewhat overworked by the deadline and the serialized magazine gave way to an e-book release from the sixth volume onward—though this was explained by Flint as primarily being due to Flint's other commitments, such as editing the new science fiction magazine \"Jim Baen's Universe\". Earlier on, he'd explained the production delays in terms of overworked proofreaders, executive editors, and so forth. Issues \"VI\" through \"X\", after being released as e-books, seem unlikely to see print; whereas Jim Baen has been releasing (all but the first) issues some months later as hardcover books, the last he bought has yet to appear. Flint has explained that the market for anthologies is always very soft, no matter the genre, and it seems likely that any new print version from the \"Gazettes\" will be a \"Best of The Grantville Gazettes\".\n\nIn the meanwhile, \"Grantville Gazette X\" was jointly published as an e-book by Baen, but also as the first foray of Eric Flint Enterprises at grantvillegazette.com, which looks to be a joint venture of Baen Books and Flint, where the new incarnation of the e-zine also pays SFWA rates and maintains a bi-monthly (six per year) publishing schedule. It is modeled very much on the same lines as \"Jim Baen's Universe\", which is edited by Flint.\n\nBeginning in early 2007, the \"Gazette\"'s publishers added an online, web-based edition published quarterly and moved the paper series to an annual \"best of\" volume. Additionally, the publishers moved to paying full professional rates instead of the semi-pro rates that had been paid. The \"Gazette\" is an SFWA-qualifying market.\n\nWhen the novel \"1632\" was written in 1999, it was conceived as an experiment in the literary genre alternate history by Flint, without intentions of writing any immediate sequel. He had, in fact, several other years of writing projects planned, which subsequent developments were to delay as late as publication in 2006–2007. Flint—as a relatively new writer at the time, following the popular demand for a sequel, elected to invite other established authors in the Baen's stable of writers to share the universe in order to rapidly develop its potential—in this he traded on his experience as an editor. This went on concurrently with a great deal of reader input in what became the 1632 Tech sub-forum on Baen's Bar. In this initiative, he became the editor (he was already a Baen editor for the Baen Free Library) and together with fan input on Baen's Bar, and collaboration with established best-selling author David Weber on the first long sequel, \"1633\", concurrently put together the \"Ring of Fire\" anthology to inaugurate the short fiction in the series.\n\nThe novel and anthology shaped one another, all filtered through and also shaped by the discussions on Baen's website. This process continues to this day, primarily in the form of \"The Grantville Gazettes\". Initially an experimental e-magazine of fan fiction, the first volume was successful enough to be released as a paperback. Subsequent \"Gazettes\" have also been released in print form.\n\nFlint, as editor of all the short fiction, also maintains the series canon (co-ordinated by the 1632.org website) and all copyrights to the alternate history universe per se, and with Flint as the controlling editor, the consequence is, semi-pro or professional payment rates aside, Baen doesn't publish anything in the series which is not canonical.\n\nIn point of fact, the short fiction in the series frequently provides a more in-depth background and foreshadows larger events that are the meat of the long fiction in the series. The longer works are replete with mentions to events covered in the shorter works, and with characters and the history and events unfolded in such materials. Flint always publishes one of his own stories within the short fiction collections, or in the case of \"\", considerably more, as it introduces several important background factors that are central to further series developments as the altered history is to unfold to the reader.\n\nIn June 2013, the Ring of Fire Press was created to reissue certain materials originally published online in the \"Grantville Gazette\". First, it would publish certain stories that were serialized across several issues of the \"Gazette\", so they can be read without hunting through the various \"Gazette\" issues. Second, it would publish several themed collections of fact articles. Initially, five Ring of Fire Press volumes was made available through Amazon as Kindle editions or print on demand paperback books. The press has since been renamed Eric Flint's Ring of Fire Press.\n\nIn January 2018, the Ring of Fire Press expanded their list of available publications by releasing their first original novel in the 1632 series, \"1635: The Battle for Newfoundland\", which only contained original material that was not previously published. In addition to Amazon, Baen began distributing selected titles for Ring of Fire Press through their web store and their other distribution channels.\n\nIn October 2018, the Ring of Fire Press began releasing novels that are part of the \"Time Spike\" series that were previously published as serials in the \"Grantville Gazette\".\n\nIn April 2017, the Ring of Fire Press began releasing novels that were not a part of either the 1632 or Assiti Shards book series.\n\nAs of 2014, four books in the series had significantly large number of sales of hardcover editions to become eligible for The New York Times Best Seller list. \"1634: The Galileo Affair\" was on the best seller list for hardcover fiction for two weeks during April 2004 while reaching number 27. \"1634: The Baltic War\" was on the same list for two weeks during May 2007, peaking at number 19. \"1634: The Bavarian Crisis\" was on this list for a week in October 2007 at number 29. The most recent book, was on the NY Times list for a week during June 2012 at number 30.\n\nAlmost all of the books in the series sold well enough to get listed on the various Locus Magazine Bestsellers Lists with some titles listed multiple times, and a few even reached the top spot for the month.\n\n\"1635: The Papal Stakes\" is the first book in the series to get listed on the Wall Street Journal Best-Selling Books list.\n\n\n"}

The company publishes a 60,000 circulation monthly publication which is distributed to intown locations and neighborhoods on the first Thursday of each month. www.creativeloafing.com is the website for the company and it also has a YouTube Channel featuring its video work over the years and a weekly \"Live from the Archives\" program featuring local musicians and bands. The company has historically been a part of the alternative weekly newspapers association in the United States.\n\nCreative Loafing began as a family-owned business in 1972 by Deborah and Chick Eason, expanding to other cities in the Southern United States in the late 1980s and 1990s. In 2007 it doubled its circulation with the purchase of the \"Chicago Reader\" and \"Washington City Paper\"; the $40 million debt it incurred, along with an economic recession, forced the company into bankruptcy one year later. The parent company, Creative Loafing, Inc. was dissolved and Atalaya sold off the Chicago Reader. In 2012, SouthComm purchased all of the properties and then sold off each of the papers to other publishers in 2018.\n\nThe Atlanta Creative Loafing launched the career of many writers and has been an institution in Atlanta's cultural scene. The Parrotheads of Jimmy Buffett fame were launched from an ad in Creative Loafing in the 1990s. Best-selling author and American humorist Hollis Gillespie by debuting her weekly column \"Moodswing,\" which first appeared in 2001 and ran for eight years. Jill Hannity, the wife of Sean Hannity, was the managing editor of the newspaper 1993–1996 until their move to New York City, which commenced Sean Hannity's television career.\n\nCreative Loafing, LLC is the name of the Publishing Company that owns Creative Loafing. Creative Loafing, LLC purchased the assets of Creative Loafing Atlanta from SouthComm in February, 2017 which put the paper back into the Eason Family's hands. \n\nOther newspapers the company published over its 40-year history included:\n\n\nDeborah and Elton \"Chick\" Eason founded \"Creative Loafing Atlanta\" in 1972, originally publishing it from the basement of their home in the Morningside neighborhood of Atlanta.\n\nAfter a decade and a half in Atlanta, the Easons established new \"Creative Loafing\" weeklies in March 1987 in Charlotte, North Carolina, and in 1988 in Tampa, Florida. Other expansions or acquisitions included newspapers in Greenville, South Carolina; Raleigh, North Carolina; and Savannah, Georgia.\n\nThe company also expanded its footprint in the Atlanta area, starting two community weeklies, \"Gwinnett Loaf\" and \"Topside Loaf\", covering the suburbs north of the city in Cobb, Gwinnett, southern Forsyth and northern Fulton counties. Bowing to reader complaints about racy advertisements in \"Creative Loafing Atlanta\", the Easons established a separate Atlanta publication, \"The Scene\", for nightlife listings. These three Atlanta-area publications would later be folded back into \"Creative Loafing Atlanta\" in 2001.\n\nBen Eason, son of Deborah and Elton, purchased the Tampa paper from his parents in 1994 and changed its name to the \"Weekly Planet\". In 1998 he expanded the paper and launched a second \"Weekly Planet\" in Sarasota, Florida.\n\nTwo years later, in September 2000, he and his two sisters led a group of investors to purchase a controlling interest in the entire Creative Loafing chain, and subsequently brought the \"Planet\" papers into the fold. After a false start during which the May 31, 2006, edition of Tampa's \"Planet\" was prematurely published with a \"Creative Loafing\" banner, the Tampa paper officially reverted to its former name and the Sarasota paper became \"Creative Loafing Sarasota\".\n\nShortly after the sale, Debby Eason purchased \"Creative Loafing\" Greenville and Savannah properties back from her children. The Greenville paper was renamed \"MetroBEAT\", while \"Creative Loafing Savannah\" was merged into \"Connect Savannah\".\n\nTo help finance the 2000 deal transferring ownership to Ben Eason's group, media conglomerate Cox Enterprises purchased a 25% minority share of the company for approximately US$5 million. In the process, Cox executives filled two seats on Creative Loafing's eight-member board. An uneasy four-year relationship between the two companies followed, as Cox also owned Atlanta's only daily, \"The Atlanta Journal-Constitution\", as well as television and radio outlets in the Atlanta area. After the \"Journal-Constitution\" in April 2003 quietly launched its own free entertainment weekly named \"Access Atlanta\", in direct competition with \"Creative Loafing\", the Easons and Creative Loafing board members voted to censure the two Cox executives for unethical conduct, and by June 2004 both companies agreed to allow the chain to repurchase its shares from Cox.\n\nOn July 24, 2007, Creative Loafing announced the purchase of the \"Washington City Paper\" and the \"Chicago Reader\", along with the \"Reader\" properties \"The Straight Dope\" and the SDMB, the associated Internet message board.\n\nIn order to accomplish the acquisitions, the company borrowed $40 million. The ensuing economic slump hurt ad sales, and CL Inc. filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on September 29, 2008.\n\nIn a bankruptcy auction on August 25, 2009, Atalaya Capital Management of New York City, emerged as the new owner, paying $5 million (it was also CL's largest creditor, owed $30 million before the bankruptcy). The Easons had put in a bid of $2.3 million, and with the change in ownership, Ben Eason was removed as CEO.\n\nOver the next two years, Atalaya sold Creative Loafing's remaining mid-market papers. The first to be sold was \"Creative Loafing Sarasota\", which was shuttered in December 2010, with its brand sold for an undisclosed sum to The New York Times Company, then-publisher of the competing \"Sarasota Herald-Tribune\". The \"Herald-Tribune\" published its own free weekly product under the \"Creative Loafing\" name for some time after the sale.\n\nIn October 2011, \"Creative Loafing Charlotte\" and \"Creative Loafing Tampa\" were sold to SouthComm Inc., a publisher of alternative weeklies based in Nashville, Tennessee.\n\n\"Creative Loafing\" three largest newspapers continued under Atalaya's ownership for one more year. In May 2012, the \"Chicago Reader\" was sold to Wrapports, publisher of the competing \"Chicago Sun-Times\", in a deal reported at $3 million. Two months later, on July 3, \"Creative Loafing Atlanta\" and the \"Washington City Paper\" were sold to SouthComm, for an undisclosed sum, and CL Inc. ceased to exist.\n\nIn 2016, the Charlotte Creative Loafing was sold to Womack Publishing of North Carolina. In 2018, the Charlotte Creative Loafing was sold again and ceased publishing a print version.\n\nIn February, 2017, Ben Eason re-purchased Creative Loafing in Atlanta and took the publication from a weekly to a monthly as part of a plan to take the company in a direction more compatible to the new digital publishing economy.\n\nThe Creative Loafing in Tampa was sold to a group from Ohio in 2018.\n"}

(subtitled \"A Musical Fairy Tale\") is a musical written by Tim Acito and with additional lyrics and material by Alexander Dinelaris. It has played in regional theatres, Off-Broadway and off west end. The story is set in a parallel universe where homosexuality is the norm and heterosexuality is a taboo. Set in mid-west America, \"Zanna\" takes place at heterophobic Heartsville High. Zanna is the school's matchmaker, bringing together happy couples until the football team's quarterback and the captain of the Girls' Intramural Mechanical Bull-Riding Team begin to discover their feelings for each other.\n\n\"Zanna, Don't!\" had a developmental run Off-Broadway at the Rodney Kirk Theatre from October 17, 2002, to November 3, 2002. It had a second off-Broadway run beginning on March 20, 2003 at the John Houseman Theater. The run closed after three months, playing 17 previews and 119 performances. Devanand Janki directed and choreographed, with a cast that featured Jai Rodriguez as the \"Magical Matchmaker\" Zanna in the 2003 production. It was produced off-Broadway by Jack M. Dalgleish in association with Stephanie A. Joel. A Broadway production was planned for 2005, but was cancelled. The title of the musical would have been changed from \"Zanna, Don't!\" to simply \"Zanna!\". After workshops with \"Avenue Q\" star John Tartaglia, revamping of the script and score, the run was postponed. The title of the show was originally inspired by the film \"Xanadu\", because Acito originally envisioned the lead character on roller skates, and Acito wanted to pay homage to the film. But, the roller-skating idea was soon dropped. Nevertheless, \"\"Zanna, Don't\" is a loving tribute to pop culture, and I thought a reference to \"Xanadu\" would be appropriate. It sort of represents the best and – many would argue – the worst of pop culture.\"\n\n\"Zanna, Don't!\" has been performed numerous times throughout the United States, including: Bailiwick Repertory, Chicago, IL in 2007, Contemporary Classics in Seattle, Washington in summer 2008, the New Conservatory Theatre Center in San Francisco, CA in fall 2008, Atlanta, GA, in May 2009, and Rochester, NY as an official event in the Gay Pride celebration in July, 2009. \n\nIt debuted in Europe on August 1, 2008 at George Square Theatre, Edinburgh, by students of the RSAMD, where it ran until 24 August. \"Zanna, Don't!\" premiered in London in May 2009, starring Mike Shearer as Zanna. Presented by Wild Oats Productions as part of the Enterprise 09 Festival, the musical was directed by Joseph C. Walsh and choreographed by Philip Scutt. It played a limited sell out season at The Space. The production later transferred to the Upstairs at the Gatehouse in June 2009, where it received rave reviews. The \"Zanna, Don't!\" cast could also be seen at West End Live! Leicester Square and \"Best of The West End\" Leicester Square Theatre.\n\nThe west coast premiere at Contemporary Classics in Seattle (June 2008) cast included Don Darryl Rivera (Broadway's Aladdin as Tank, Diana Huey as Roberta, and Casey Craig as Zanna. The Seattle Times recognized the production as one of the top musicals of 2008. Contemporary Classics revived the production in 2009 and 2010, with some new cast members each year.\n\nIn November of 2008, New Conservatory Theatre Center in San Francisco opened a production which ran to February 2009.

Patterson as Tank, Miquela Sierra as Candi, and Rodney Earl Jackson Jr. as Buck. The NCTC cast won awards for best ensemble, best choreography and best musical direction from the Bay Area Theatre Critics Circle (BATCC.)\n\nThe Los Angeles production of \"Zanna, Don't!\" premiered January 6, 2012, and ran until February 25, 2012 at Theatre/Theater produced by The Spotlight Theatre from Bakersfield, California. Directed by Alex Neal; the cast featured Kenny Maclin as Zanna, Nick Ono as Steve, Tessa Ogles as Kate, Zachary Gonzalez as Mike, Catt Fox as Roberta, Alex Bennett as Tank, Hannah DiMolfetto as Candi, Alex Neal as Arvin, and Hannah DiMolfetto as Loretta. The production was sponsored in part by The Kern County Board of Trade. \n\nIn April 2013, Speakeasy Theatre Ltd. produced the New Zealand premiere of \"Zanna, Don't!\" at Gryphon Theatre in Wellington. Directed by Stuart James and Musically Directed by Hayden Taylor, the cast included Jared Pallesen as Zanna, Jesse Finn as Steve, Katie Evans as Kate, Stuart James as Mike, Janelle Pollock as Roberta, Joshua Hopton-Stewart as Tank, and Hannah Bain as Candi LeRoi Kippen as Buck. True to the original Off-Broadway production, Speakeasy Theatre Ltd's \"Zanna, Don't!\" had only eight actors playing a myriad of characters and roles.\n\nIn 2014, See 'Em On Stage: A Production Company produced the New Orleans and Southern region premiere of \"Zanna, Don't!\" at the Old Marquer Theatre. Directed by Christopher Bentivegna, the show received seven New Orleans Big Easy Theatre Awards nominations, winning the award for best actor.\n\nThe musical is set in Heartsville, U.S.A, once upon a time. The exact time period is not specified, but the play takes place across a school year, beginning on the first day and ending at prom. This is an alternate, fairy tale America, where the majority of the world is homosexual, with heterosexuals subject to heterophobia. Despite the fairy tale aspect, the world is essentially equivalent to ours, with references to Star Trek, the internet, Wayne Gretzky, and many other recognizable people, things or ideas. The majority of the play is set at Heartsville High, where the main characters are students.\n\nAs the school year begins, DJ and student Tank reminds the world that Zanna is on the look-out for any extra love that needs to be shared (\"Who's Got Extra Love?\"). Zanna finds new kid Steve Bookman (a quarterback) lonely. Zanna sets him up with Mike Singer, a chess champion and idol of school. (In the musical's world, chess players are sex symbols, and football players nobodies.) Their love blooms quickly (\"I Think We Got Love\").\n\nMeanwhile, Kate Aspero, all-around overachiever, finds love with Roberta, a part-time waitress. Kate had long resisted Zanna's efforts to find love for her, citing \"SATs, ACTs, APs, and GPAs\" as being more worthy of her time, while Roberta seemed destined to a life of cheating girlfriends. She laments this in \"I Ain't Got Time,\" much to the chagrin of the diner's customers. Spurred by Zanna's magic, Roberta impresses Kate so strongly (\"Ride 'Em\") that they become a couple.\n\nZanna, pleased with his success, settles down for the night, singing \"Zanna's Song\" as he says goodnight to his magic wand and goodbye to his feathered friend Cindy, who migrates to Fort Lauderdale.\n\nThe next day, the kids decide to create a musical addressing the controversy over heterosexuals in the military. Their play includes the song \"Be A Man,\" touting the impressive homosexual leaders of history (including Leonardo da Vinci, Alexander the Great, and the ancient Spartans), and \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell,\" an overly dramatic ballad about a heterosexual couple forced to hide their love from the Army.\n\nIn a reprise of \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell,\" Kate and Steve realize they have feelings for each other, a fact they try quickly to forget, as their town is extremely heterophobic.\n\nSome amount of time passes. At the \"I'm Okay, You're Okay Corral,\" Mike proposes moving in with Steve after graduation, but Steve, trying to avoid the issue, believes they should slow down. Three Corral regulars, Tex, Bronco, and Loretta, insist that love should go \"Fast.\" Steve, scared and confused runs from Mike, who describes Steve's unpredictable behavior in \"I Could Write Books.\" Later, and much to the amusement of Tex, Bronco, and Loretta, it is also revealed that Zanna has feelings for Steve.\n\nKate and Steve's perplexing behavior leads Mike and Roberta to playfully suggest to each other \"Don't You Wish We Could Be In Love?\", but the light-hearted song turns serious as Kate, Steve, and Zanna all join in, reflecting on their relationships.\n\nThe focus shifts to the State Chess Finals. Steve promises to exchange varsity rings with Mike after the match, while Kate puts all her effort into being a perfect girlfriend to Roberta. Mike's hesitation in the final match causes Roberta to lead a raucous cheer that becomes the song \"Whatcha Got?\"—a successful cheer indeed, causing Mike to win the tournament.\n\nBut in the resulting celebration, Kate and Steve kiss, throwing the town into chaos. Mike, Steve, Kate, and Roberta are devastated (\"Do You Know What It's Like?\"). Kate and Steve run into classmates Candi and Buck, who have suddenly distanced themselves from the heterosexual couple. Unable to handle living in a heterophobic environment, Kate and Steve plan to run away from Heartsville. Zanna, desperate to make the world safe for them, finds a spell that, while likely to cost him his powers (and a possible deterioration of taste and style), will make everything better, or so he hopes. Deciding that nothing done for love can ever hurt, Zanna performs the spell (\"'Tis a Far, Far Better Thing I Do/Blow Winds\").\n\nZanna's spell is a success, in a way. Kate and Steve are King and Queen of the Prom, and everyone there is singing \"Straight To Heaven.\" But Zanna finds that everyone is now heterosexual, and that no one can remember what life was like before the spell, to the point that Zanna himself is ostracized. He reflects on his life, hoping that \"Someday You Might Love Me.\" The students, overhearing this song, realize that they were mistaken in abandoning their friend, singing a reprise of \"Straight to Heaven\" with \"straight\" replaced with \"right.\" Prom is a success, and Zanna is invited to a post-prom party, but he chooses to stay behind and think for a while. On his way home, he drops a shoe, and true to fairy tales, Tank rushes to return it to him, revealing not just his memories of before the spell but his love of Zanna, begging \"Sometime, Do You Think We Could Fall In Love?\"\n\nThe happy couple is joined by the ensemble for a reprise of \"Sometime, Do You Think...\" at the curtain call.\n\nIn parentheses are the actors who portrayed the role in the original Off-Broadway cast. Unless otherwise noted, each character is a student at Heartsville High.\n\n\nIn addition, the ensemble plays various townspeople and the Girls' Intramural Mechanical Bull-Riding Team.\n\nTrack Listing from PS Classics:\n\n\nThe recording, released by P.S. Classics, is available online, on iTunes, and in stores.\n\nSteve Gray wrote: \"The show has male characters to kill for... Stuart James brings a tender sweet quality to Mike... Vocally outstanding and a strong presence on stage, he brings a strong comedic sense to the show as well. Jared Pallesen... has a really strong voice and makes the character (Zanna) a fun, yet also heart felt creation. All in all, the show itself is easily one of the strongest in the ‘gay musical’ canon, and this is a fine production that will appeal to people of all ages. Good, gay fun with many laughs and a great score well sung. Congrats to all involved.\"\n\n\"This show deserves to be sold out so get your tickets quick.\"- Wellington Reviews\n\n\"The singing and dancing were impressivley professional, well supported by an unobtrusive band\"- Ewen Coleman, The Dominion Post\n\nTime Out London wrote that this is \"The fringe feel good show of the year\", and was a Fringe Critics Choice.\n\nThis show has a genuine spring in its step. It is lighthearted, tuneful and thoroughly good fun, delivered by a young, zesty cast of 12, who dance and sing for all they are worth. From whatsonstage.com\n\n\"The British Theatre Guide\" wrote that \"The whole cast give all they’ve got...I defy you not to like it.\" Mike Shearer is \"sparkling\".\n\ngaydarnation.com wrote that \"\"Zanna, Don't!\" is just the ticket to make the world seem fabulous again.\" Mike Shearer gives a \"skilful performance\" of \"Zanna that is both campy narrator and emotional centre of the show. It doesn’t hurt that he has a fantastic voice as well. The other standout performance comes out of the ensemble. William J Cassidy as Arvin...gives a brilliant performance.\" \n\nThe \"New York Times\" wrote \"Happily oblivious to everything else happening in the world, a chirpy new Off Broadway musical, \"Zanna, Don't!\" arrived at the John Houseman Theater last night with a pop score that aims to be nothing but catchy and a message that says nothing but that people should love each other. And gee whiz, wouldn't you know it? Something about its pure, sugary hopefulness satisfies a sweet tooth that many of us may have forgotten we have.\"\n\nThe \"Curtain-Up\" review of the Off-Broadway production in 2003 noted that \"the winning score has both variety and a contemporary feel, perhaps permitting it to find a cross-generational appeal.\" \n\n\n\n\nZanna, Don't! was also awarded 2003 GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding New York Theater Production and voted Favorite Off-Broadway Musical in the Broadway.com Audience Awards.\n\n"}

Hoskins\n\nWilliam George Hoskins CBE FBA (22 May 1908 – 11 January 1992) was an English local historian who founded the first university department of English Local History. His great contribution to the study of history was in the field of landscape history. Hoskins demonstrated the profound impact of human activity on the evolution of the English landscape in a pioneering book: \"The Making of the English Landscape\". His work has had lasting influence in the fields of local and landscape history and historical and environmental conservation.\n\nWilliam George Hoskins was born at 26–28 St David's Hill, Exeter, Devon on 22 May 1908: his father, like his grandfather, was a baker.\n\nHe won a scholarship to Hele's School in 1918, and attended the University College of South West England where he gained BSc and MSc degrees in economics by the age of 21. Both his MSc in 1929 and his PhD in 1938 were on the history of Devon.\n\nThe remainder of his life was devoted to university teaching and the authorship of historical works. He died on 11 January 1992 in Cullompton, Devon.\n\nHoskins was appointed Assistant Lecturer in Commerce at University College, Leicester in 1931. He found the trade statistics to be dull lecture material, but he enjoyed the evenings that he spent teaching archaeology and local history at Vaughan College. His academic researches covered historical demography, urban history, agrarian history, the evolution of vernacular architecture, landscape history and local history. He became a member of the Leicestershire Archaeological Society in September 1935.\n\nAfter the award of his doctorate Hoskins was appointed Reader in English Local History at University College, Leicester (1938).\n\nIn 1952, Hoskins resigned from his posts at University College, Leicester, and on the Leicestershire Victoria County History Committee to become Reader in Economic History in the University of Oxford. In his obituary, this was stated to be generally acknowledged as a mistake.\n\nIn 1955, Hoskins published the book that was to make his name. \"The Making of the English Landscape\" is a landscape history of England and a seminal text in that discipline and in local history. The brief history of some one thousand years has become a standard text in local and environmental history courses. Hoskins sets out his stall in the introduction with \"No book exists to describe the manner in which the various landscapes of this country came to assume the shape and appearance they now have...\". The brief concluding chapter contains only one image, Plate 82, \"The completed English landscape\" showing a tall tree in a wide open field, a strip of hedges and villages just visible in the distance. The chapter laments the damage caused to parts of the English landscape, mentioning bulldozers and tractors, nuclear bombers and by-passes, and ends by celebrating again the wealth of detail within a few hundred yards of Hoskins' study window at Steeple Barton.\n\nThe book has been well received by critics. Penelope Lively describes the book as \"a marvellous, robust, opinionated account of the landscape as narrative\". William Boyd describes it as \"an absolute trailblazer, a revolution.\" Boyd notes that W. H. Auden \"revered\" the book, and that reading Hoskins had enabled him to \"read\" a landscape as a \"historical palimpsest\". Local historian Graeme White calls the book \"brilliantly-crafted\".\n\nHoskins was one of the founders of the Exeter Group in 1960 (later to become the Exeter Civic Society). He was president of the Dartmoor Preservation Association from 1962 until 1976.\n\nHe became the first professor of local history at the University of Leicester in 1965 when he was appointed Hatton Professor of English History. He retired in 1968. \n\nFollowing his retirement, Hoskins presented an episode of \"Horizon\" based on \"The Making of the English Landscape\" in 1972. \n\nThis led to a BBC television series \"Landscapes of England\" which examined in more detail how human influence has greatly shaped the landscape of twelve distinct regions in England, the first series in 1976 and the second in 1978. For the final episode, Hoskins talks passionately about his home county of Devon and his home city of Exeter.\n\nHoskins was awarded the Fellowship of the British Academy in 1969 and the CBE in 1971. He was made an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects in 1973, and received the Murchison Award of the Royal Geographical Society in 1976.\n\nThe University of Exeter acknowledged his links with the city by conferring an honorary Doctorate of Letters upon him in 1974.\n\nAs founder of the Department of English Local History (now the Centre for English Local History) at the University of Leicester, his achievements are commemorated by the Friends of the Centre for English Local History each year in the annual \"W.G. Hoskins lecture\", and another at St Anne's College, Oxford.\n\nIn 2004 the Devon History Society erected a blue plaque on his birthplace in Exeter with the inscription: \"W. G. Hoskins CBE FBA Dlitt 1908–1992 Historian of Devon, Exeter and the English Landscape Born Here 'Hic Amor, Haec Patria Est'.\"\n\nHoskins wrote the following books and essays:\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1878313", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1878313", "title": "Theodora Komnene, Queen of Jerusalem", "text": "Theodora Komnene, Queen of Jerusalem\n\nTheodora Komnene or Comnena ( ) (born ) was a niece of Byzantine emperor Manuel I Comnenus, and wife of King Baldwin III of Jerusalem.\n\nTheodora was a daughter of the \"sebastokratōr\" Isaac Komnenos by his second wife, Eirene Synadene. Her father was a son of Emperor John II Komnenos and Piroska of Hungary, daughter of King Ladislaus I of Hungary.\n\nHer paternal uncles included Emperor Manuel I Komnenos. Her half-sister Maria Komnene married King Stephen IV of Hungary.\n\nBaldwin III of Jerusalem had taken control of the Kingdom of Jerusalem from his mother and Regent Queen Melisende in 1153. He was unmarried, however, and around 1157 it was decided by the \"Haute Cour\" that a wife should be sought from the Byzantine Empire, the kingdom's most powerful and wealthy neighbour. A Byzantine alliance would hopefully also bring much-needed money and military assistance against Nūr al-Dīn, sultan of Syria and Jerusalem's greatest enemy. \n\nAttard, archbishop of Nazareth, Humphrey II of Toron, constable of Jerusalem, Joscelin Piscellus, and William de Barris were sent to Constantinople to negotiate a marriage for the king (Attard died while on the mission). The ambassadors were delayed in Constantinople for almost an entire year but it was finally decided that Theodora would be chosen as Baldwin's wife. She was at the time only 12 or 13 years old, but was already renowned for her beauty. Her dowry was worth 100,000 hyperpyra, and William of Tyre estimated that her extravagant wedding clothes cost another 14,000 hyperpyra. As a dower from Baldwin, Theodora was granted the city of Acre, which she would hold as her own should Baldwin die childless. \n\nThe ambassadors arrived in Jerusalem with Theodora in September 1158. Aimery of Limoges, the patriarch of Antioch, performed the marriage, as the patriarch of Jerusalem had not yet been consecrated. Baldwin was previously known for his frivolous lifestyle, but now became a devoted and loyal husband. The marriage was short and childless: Baldwin died only a few years later in 1162, leaving Theodora a widow at the age of about 17. Theodora received the city of Acre, as promised.\n\nA few years later in 1166, Theodora's kinsman Andronikos, a first cousin of her father, visited the kingdom and was named lord of Beirut by Baldwin's brother and successor Amalric I. Andronikos invited Theodora to Beirut, and the two eloped to Damascus, or as William says, Andronikos abducted her in collusion with Nūr al-Dīn. It was likely not an abduction; Andronikos was already married, and had already had an affair with Philippa, a sister of Prince Bohemund III of Antioch and of Manuel's wife Maria of Antioch, and he was likely trying to escape persecution by Manuel, who did not approve of these incestuous affairs. As there was no legal marriage, Acre was returned to King Amalric. Amalric had also married a Byzantine princess, Maria Komnene, and the imperial alliance remained intact. \n\nAt the court of Nūr al-Dīn in Damascus, Andronikos and Theodora had two children together, Alexios and Eirene, although Andronikos was inevitably excommunicated. They also travelled to Baghdad, and then to the Sultanate of Rum where Andronikos was made lord of a castle in Paphlagonia.\n\nSome years later Theodora and her children were captured and handed over to the emperor Manuel, who kept them in Constantinople as a bait to encourage Andronikos to return to his Byzantine allegiance. He did in fact capitulate and visited Constantinople in 1180 to submit to Manuel.\n\nWhen he finally returned to Constantinople in 1182, becoming emperor in 1183, there is no evidence that Theodora went back to live with him. It was at this time, however, that their daughter Eirene married Alexios Komnenos, an illegitimate son of Emperor Manuel I by of Theodora Vatatzina. At this time, too, Theodora interceded with Andronikos to pay the ransom for her nephew, Isaac, a former Byzantine governor of Isauria now a captive in Armenia; Andronikos afterwards regretted doing so, since Isaac rebelled and seized control of Cyprus.\n\nK. Varzos suggests that Theodora Komnene and Theodora Vatatzina eventually conspired against Andronikos, but there seems to be no positive evidence of this. Her later history is not known.\n\nAnother Theodora Komnene was the wife of Prince Bohemund III of Antioch and sister of Queen Maria Komnene of Jerusalem. A third Theodora Komnene was the wife of Duke Henry II of Austria and mother of Duke Leopold V of Austria.\n\n\n \n"}

Private-charter entertainment boats also use Tower Pier.\n\nTower Millennium Pier was opened on 14 July by London Mayor Ken Livingstone. Its creation was funded by the Millennium Commission as part of the Thames 2000 project, and was one of five new piers provided by the Commission on the Thames (the others being Blackfriars Millennium Pier, London Eye Pier, Westminster Millennium Pier and Millbank Millennium Pier). The pier has at its upstream end a small cruise terminal facility which is used for processing passengers and baggage transferred by boat from cruise ships berthed alongside HMS Belfast. The Tower Pier project was part of an integrated transport and regeneration strategy for the Thames led by London's Cross River Partnership.\n\n\nIn 2002 the RNLI's Thames lifeboat service was introduced to the River Thames following the Marchioness disaster, and Tower Pier was initially used as a base for the lifeboat service.

Parachinar is situated on a neck of Pakistani territory west of Peshawar, that juts into the Logar and Nangarhar provinces of Afghanistan. With a distance of from the Afghan capital Kabul, Parachinar is the closest point in Pakistan to Kabul.\n\nThe name Parachinar is derived as a result of social meetings conducted under a large chinar tree. The remains of that tree are still there at a place now encompassed by the headquarters of Kurram Agency where the elders of famous tribe chamkani residing in para area used to conclude meetings under a Chinar tree to resolve their social matters. \n\nIn 1893, during the rule of Ameer Abdur Rahman (Barakzai Dynasty) of Afghanistan, a Royal Commission for demarcating a Boundary between Afghanistan and the territory of British governed India negotiated terms, agreeing to the Durand line. Two parties camped at Parachinar, now part of FATA, Pakistan, which is near Khost, Afghanistan.\n\nFrom the British side the camp was attended by Sir Mortimer Durand and Sahibzada Abdul Qayyum, Assistant Political Agent, Khyber Agency. The Afghanistan interest was represented by Sahibzada Abdul Latif and the Governor Khost Sardar Shireendil Khan, representing King Amir Abdur Rahman Khan.\n\nOn April 6, 2007, a gunman of Shia sect, Pakistan fired on a Friday prayer held by Sunni in Parachinar, leaving more than 40 people dead and more than 150 people wounded. Violent clashes in the region occurred in the following week until a ceasefire was reached on April 12, 2007.\n\nParachinar has been the target of several terrorist attacks since 2007 in which over 500 people have died, making it the second most targeted Pakistani city by militants after Peshawar.\n\nParachinar has a moderate humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification \"Cfa\"). Although the city's southeasterly aspect relative to the valley in which it is situated allows it to receive on occasions significant monsoonal rainfall, the most frequent source of rain is western depressions and related thunderstorms. During the winter, snowfall is common, and frosts occur on most mornings. Snow closes the Peiwar Pass, located on the Paktia border just over 20 km west of Parachinar, for up to five months per year.\n\nThe population of Parachinar is predominantly Shia Muslim.\n\nAs a result of many recent terrorist attacks, an estimated 60 percent of Parachinar residents suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder and approximately 40 percent of the population suffers from depression. A lack of mental health facilities in Kurram Agency has prevented many people in Parachinar from receiving treatment. Parachinar has a high suicide rate among young adults, and nearly 100 people commit suicide every year.\n\nFATA University plans to open a sub-campus at Parachinar.\n\nThe Thall-Parachinar road is the main road connecting Parachinar to the rest of the country.\n\nParachinar has an airport but currently it is non functional.

Its native range is eastern North America. Its scientific name honors Colonial Virginia botanist John Clayton (1694–1773).\n\nSpringbeauty is a perennial plant, overwintering through a tuberous root. It is a trailing plant growing to long. The leaves are slender lanceolate, long and broad, with a long petiole.\n\nThe flowers are in diameter with five pale pink or white (rarely yellow) petals, and reflect UV light. It has a raceme inflorescence, in which its flowers branch off of the shoot. The individual flowers bloom for three days, although the five stamens on each flower are only active for a single day. Flowering occurs between March and May depending on part of its range and weather. The seeds are between in diameter and a shiny black. The seeds are released from the capsule fruit when it breaks open. Elaiosomes are present on the seeds and allow for ant dispersal.\n\nIt is a polyploid, having 2n between 12 and 191 chromosomes. The largest number of chromosomes was observed in New York City.\n\nSpringbeauty is found in the Eastern temperate deciduous forest of North America. It is noted for its abundance throughout many parts of its range, especially in forests. The plant can be found throughout many different habitat types including lawns, city parks, forests, roadsides, wetlands, bluffs, and ravines.\n\nHammond's yellow spring beauty, \"Claytonia virginica\" var. \"hammondiae\", is a varietal with a very small range and population in a few areas of Northwestern New Jersey.\n\nThis plant has been used medicinally by the Iroquois, who would give a cold infusion or decoction of the powdered roots to children suffering from convulsions.

The name \"330\" refers to the approximate displacement of each single cylinder in cubic centimeters.\n\nThe first, the 2+2 330 America, was a 250 GT/E with a larger 4.0 litre engine; the 330 GTC/GTS shared its chassis with the 275; the 330 GT 2+2 had its own chassis and bodywork; the mid-engined 330P racer was part of the Ferrari P series, produced in four models. Production ended in 1968 with the introduction of the Ferrari 365 series.\n\nAll 330 models used an evolution of the 400 Superamerica's 4.0 L \"Colombo\" V12 engine. It was substantially changed, with wider bore spacing and an alternator replacing a generator.\n\nThe 1963 330 America shared the outgoing 250 GT/E's chassis but not its engine, being powered by the new 4.0 L \"Tipo\" 209 V12, with at 6600 rpm. Visually, the 330 America was almost identical to the Series III 250 GT/E, although some were fitted with an \"America\" badge on the rear. Like the 250 GT/E, the 330 America was fitted with 185VR15 Pirelli Cinturato tyres.\n50 330 Americas were built in late 1963 before being replaced by the larger 330 GT 2+2.\nThe provisional 330 America was replaced in January 1964 by the new 330 GT 2+2. It was first shown at the Brussels Show, early that year. It was much more than a re-engined 250, however, with a sharper nose and tail, quad headlights, and a wide grille. Power output remained the same at . The wheelbase was longer, but Koni adjustable shock absorbers improved handling. A dual-circuit Dunlop braking system was used with discs all around, though it separated brakes front to back rather than diagonally as on modern systems. When leaving the factory the 330 GT originally fitted Pirelli Cinturato 205VR15 tyres (CN72).\n\nThe 1965 Series II version featured a five-speed gearbox instead of the overdrive four-speed of the prior year. Other changes included the switch back to a dual-light instead of quad-light front, alloy wheels, and the addition of optional air conditioning and power steering. Prior to the introduction of the 'Series II' 330 GTs, a series of 125 'interim' cars were produced, with the quad-headlight external configuration of the Series I cars, but with the five-speed transmission and 'suspended' foot pedals of the 'Series II' cars.\n\n625 Series I (including 125 'interim' cars) and 455 Series II 330 GT 2+2 cars had been built when the car was replaced by the 365 GT 2+2 in 1967. Production of the smaller 330 GTC and GTS models overlapped with the GT 2+2 for more than a year.\n\nThe 330 GTC and 330 GTS were more like their 275 counterparts than the 330 GT 2+2. They shared the short wheelbase of the 275 as well as its independent rear suspension & the same tyres 205VR14 Michelin XWX. These models were more refined than earlier Ferraris, quieter and easier to drive. It has been stated that this \"was probably the first Ferrari in which you could actually enjoy a radio\".\n\nThe GTC berlinetta was introduced at the Geneva Motor Show in March, 1966. It was a two-seater coupé with a Pininfarina-designed body.\n\nThe GTS spider was introduced later, at the October 1966 Paris Motor Show . It used the same chassis and drivetrain as the GTC.\n\nAbout 600 coupés and 100 spiders were produced before the 1968 introduction of the 365 GTC and GTS. Both models' four litre engines produced .\n\nA 1967 330 GTC was given one-off bodywork by Zagato at the behest of American importer Luigi Chinetti in 1974. This car's targa top bodywork led it to be called the \"Zagato Convertible.\" It was exhibited at the 1974 Geneva International Motor Show.\n\nFour 330 GTC Speciale coupés were constructed by Pininfarina in 1966. These used the 330 GTC chassis and drivetrain, with unique bodywork incorporating styling from the 365 California and other Pininfarina-designed Ferraris. This model was introduced at the 1967 Brussels Motor Show. Original customers included Princess Liliane de Réthy of Belgium and Maria Maddalena da Lisca, wife of Pietro Barilla.\n\nIn the early 1970s, Ferrari allowed Swiss specialist Felber to use the Ferrari name on a retro roadster using 330 GTC underpinnings. Six or seven examples of the Felber FF were built between 1974 and 1977, with hand-made aluminium bodywork by Panther Westwinds, who helped develop the car.\n\nFour 330 LMB GT racing cars (with LMB standing for Le Mans Berlinetta) were built in 1963. This model is also known as the 330 LM. First presented in March 1963 alongside the mid-engined 250 P, they were essentially a development of the 250 GTOs and fitted with the 4-litre 330 engine, here rated at at 7,500 rpm. Although the front is visually similar to the 250 GTOs, the main structure came from the 250 Lusso. The four 330 LMBs are distinct from the three 1962 330 GTOs; the 330 LMB chassis and body differed significantly from the 330 GTO, which was almost identical to the 250 GTO. The wheelbase, at , was also 20 mm longer than either the Lusso's or the GTO's. The raised plates on the top of the rear fenders were necessary to clear the rear tires.\n\nThe 330 LMB did not see much racing, as Ferrari was moving over to the mid-engined layout for racing. One retired at Sebring 1963, while of three starters at Le Mans that year, two retired and the car of Jack Sears and Mike Salmon came in fifth. After this, the LMB saw no more works entries.\nFour models of mid-engined racing cars used the 330 engine and name as well — the 330 P/P2/P3/P4 range of the mid 1960s. The 330 P4 had 450 hp at 8000 rpm, which combined with its low weight of 792 kg (1746,06 lb) resulted in a top speed of 320 km/h (198.85 mph).\n\n\n"}

Simpson is the originator of the term and concept metrosexual. He has been described by one critic as \"the skinhead Oscar Wilde\". \n\nSimpson has written for numerous publications around the world, including \"The Times\", \"The Guardian\", \"Salon\", \"Arena Homme +\", \"GQ Style\", \"Vogues Hommes International\", \"The Independent on Sunday\", \"Têtu\", the Seattle \"Stranger\", and Dutch \"Playboy\". In December 2007, \"GQ Russia\" placed him in their 'Top Ten Things That Changed Men's Lives'.\n\nMark Simpson is credited with coining the term \"metrosexual\" in a 1994 article for \"The Independent\". He also introduced the word to the US in 'Meet the Metrosexual', a much-quoted essay on Salon.com in 2002, leading to the global popularity of the term. This was also the first citation of the UK footballer David Beckham as the ultimate example of the type. Simpson was later credited with introducing the term 'retrosexual' (in the sense of the anti-metrosexual) in 2003.\n\nDescribed as one of the \"Ideas of the Year\" by \"The New York Times\" in 2006, Simpson wrote on the issue of sport and advertising increasingly using homoerotic imagery, in a process he dubbed \"sporno\" (\"the place where sport and porn meet and produce a gigantic money shot\"). Simpson wrote about \"sporno\" for \"Out\" magazine commenting that: \"whole new generation of young bucks, from twinky soccer players like Manchester United's Alan Smith and Cristiano Ronaldo to rougher prospects like Chelsea's Joe Cole and AC Milan's Kak', keen to emulate their success, are actively pursuing sex-object status in a postmetrosexual, increasingly pornolized world.\" The London \"Times\" newspaper also featured sporno in their 'Year in Ideas' list.\n\nIn 2010, the global trend spotting website Science of the Time described Simpson as \"the world's most perceptive writer about masculinity\". \"The Times of India\" included 'metrosexual' in their review of the most important words of the last thirty years, commenting: \"Much has been written about metrosexuals, but no one has done it as well as the man credited with coining the term, Mark Simpson.\"\n\nIn 2014, Simpson proposed that the age of the \"metrosexual\" has passed and is evolving into a new kind of man called the \"spornosexual\". Spornosexual is a neologism, also coined by Simpson, combining the words \"sport,\" \"porn,\" and \"metrosexual.\" It describes an aesthetic adopted by some men who consume both sports and pornography. Such men, in addition to possessing certain metrosexual attributes, carry their own bodies as accessories and are not shy at showcasing them in public. The spornosexual style emphasises heavy, lean musculature, and certain kinds of tattooing. Spornosexuals spend much money and time on physical fitness and upkeep. Some commentators argue that the rise of spornosexuals is another indication of society becoming evermore narcissistic.\n\nSimpson's first book \"Male Impersonators\" (1994) provided the background for his theory of metrosexuality by examining the way men were represented in popular culture – movies, ads, mags, music, male stripping, and comedy – and showing how 'unmanly' passions such as homoeroticism, male narcissism, and male masochism were not excluded but rather \"exploited\", albeit semi-secretly, in voyeuristic virility.\n\nReturning to Freud's theory of universal bisexual responsiveness, Simpson also 'outed' what he saw as the homoerotic subtext of masculinity itself. In particular, Simpson analysed the way movies, ads, pop music, and bodybuilding, had replaced 'real' masculinity, if it ever existed, with something 'sexy and simulated'. In his chapter on Marky Mark and his (then) recent Calvin Klein ads, Simpson argued that the rapper's appearance on billboards in Times Square and on the side of buses 'in his prime and in his underwear', grabbing his 'package' to shift product, graphically demonstrated how the commodification of the male body – 'and gay men's love for it' – had become 'eyepoppingly' mainstream.\n\nThe book included a chapter arguing that the real romance in \"Top Gun\" was between Maverick (Tom Cruise) and Iceman (Val Kilmer). Quentin Tarantino made a cameo appearance in the film \"Sleep with Me\" later the same year as a party-guest making a similar argument.\n\nSimpson's collection \"Anti-Gay\" (1996), described on the jacket as \"the shameful antidote to feelgood politics\"', according to \"The Independent\", \"divided the gay community\". Led by Simpson, various 'non-heterosexual' contributors, such as Bruce LaBruce and Glenn Belverio, John Weir, Peter Tatchell, Lisa Power, and Anne-Marie Le Ble, voiced their criticism of the gay \"one-size-fits-all\" identity and the gay media's intolerance of anything that wasn't \"glad\" and \"clap happy\". \"Anti-Gay\" was one of the first \"post-gay\" books, appearing a year or so before a series of largely conservative American gay books critical of gay culture, such as \"The Rise and Fall of Gay Culture\" (D Harris, 1997) and \"Life Outside\" (M Signorile, 1997), \"Sexual Ecology\" (G Rotello, 1998).\n\n\"It's a Queer World\" published the same year, described on the dust jacket as \"hilariously perverse\" and \"taking a warped look at fin-de-siecle pop culture where nothing is as straight – or gay – as it seems\", collected Simpson's popular columns of the same name which appeared in \"Attitude\" magazine, and showed how gay and straight culture were converging, a decade before this became a common theme.\n\n\"The Queen is Dead\" (1998) collected his colourful and confessional correspondence with American writer Steven Zeeland. According to the jacket blurb: \"A chance letter sparks off an hilariously doomed transatlantic literary romance involving Marines, glory holes, cats, intellectuals, transsexuals and a bizarre love-triangle rivalry with gay serial-killer and Gianni Versace's assassin Andrew Cunanan.\" Despite its openly offbeat subject matter, it was reviewed positively: \"Something of a masterpiece\" wrote Roger Clarke in \"The Independent\".\n\n\"Sex Terror: Misadventures in pop culture\" is a collection of essays, interviews and articles from Simpson's late 1990s journalism, including writings in \"Attitude\" magazine and \"The Guardian\". Interview subjects include Henry Rollins, Julie Burchill and Dana International.\n\n\"Saint Morrissey\" was Simpson's \"psycho-bio\" of the former Smiths front man, written at a low point of the singer's career, and published the year before Morrissey's 2004 comeback. The book prompted some comparisons with the subject's style: \"Simpson is funny, clever, honest, irreverent and egotistical: quite the match for Morrissey. More biographies should be written this way.\" (Laurence Phelan, Independent on Sunday Books of the Year')\n\nSimpson's ebook, \"Metrosexy\" (2011), collects his writings on the subject of metrosexuality, offering a kind of biography of the subject, which he describes as a \"Frankenstein monster with flawless skin\". The book follows the term from its origin in an article of Simpson's for \"The Independent\" newspaper in 1994, to its international adoption in the early 2000s, the backlash against it and its subsequent \"Jersey Shore\" resurgence, to the point where Simpson argues that metrosexuality had come to be seen as simply \"normal\".\n"}
{"id": "1878393", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1878393", "title": "Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science", "text": "Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science\n\nFads and Fallacies in the Name of Science (1957)—originally published in 1952 as In the Name of Science: An Entertaining Survey of the High Priests and Cultists of Science, Past and Present—was Martin Gardner's second book. A survey of what it described as pseudosciences and cult beliefs, it became a founding document in the nascent scientific skepticism movement. Michael Shermer said of it: \"Modern skepticism has developed into a science-based movement, beginning with Martin Gardner's 1952 classic\".\n\nThe book debunks what it characterises as pseudo-science and the pseudo-scientists who propagate it.\n\n\"Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science\" starts with a brief survey of the spread of the ideas of \"cranks\" and \"pseudo-scientists\", attacking the credulity of the popular press and the irresponsibility of publishing houses in helping to propagate these ideas. Cranks often cite historical cases where ideas were rejected which are now accepted as right. Gardner acknowledges that such cases occurred, and describes some of them, but says that times have changed: \"If anything, scientific journals err on the side of permitting \"questionable\" theses to be published\". Gardner acknowledges that \"among older scientists ... one may occasionally meet with irrational prejudice against a new point of view\", but adds that \"a certain degree of dogma ... is both necessary and desirable\" because otherwise \"science would be reduced to shambles by having to examine every new-fangled notion that came along.\"\n\nGardner says that cranks have \"two\" common characteristics. The first \"and most important\" is that they work in almost total isolation from the scientific community. Gardner defines the community as an efficient network of communication within scientific fields, together with a co-operative process of testing new theories. This process allows for apparently bizarre theories to be published — such as Einstein's theory of relativity, which initially met with considerable opposition; it was never dismissed as the work of a crackpot, and it soon met with almost universal acceptance. But the crank \"stands entirely outside the closely integrated channels through which new ideas are introduced and evaluated. He does not send his findings to the recognized journals or, if he does, they are rejected for reasons which in the vast majority of cases are excellent.\"\n\nThe second characteristic of the crank (which also contributes to his or her isolation) is the tendency to paranoia. There are \"five\" ways in which this tendency is likely to be manifested.\n\n\nThese psychological traits are in varying degrees demonstrated throughout the remaining chapters of the book, in which Gardner examines particular \"fads\" he labels pseudo-scientific. His writing became the source book from which many later studies of pseudo-science were taken (e.g. \"Encyclopedia of Pseudo-science\").\n\nAs per the subtitle of the book, \"The curious theories of modern pseudoscientists and the strange, amusing and alarming cults that surround them\" are discussed in the chapters as listed.\n\n\nThe 1957 Dover publication is a revised and expanded version of \"In the Name of Science\", which was published by G. P. Putnam's Sons in 1952. The subtitle boldly states the book's theme: \"The curious theories of modern pseudoscientists and the strange, amusing and alarming cults that surround them. A study in human gullibility\". As of 2005, it had been reprinted at least 30 times.\n\nThe book was expanded from an article first published in the \"Antioch Review\" in 1950, and in the preface to the first edition, Gardner thanks the Review for allowing him to develop the article as the starting point of his book. Not all material in the article is carried over to the book. For example, in the article, Gardner writes:\nThe reader may wonder why a competent scientist does not publish a detailed refutation of Reich's absurd biological speculations. The answer is that the informed scientist doesn't care, and would, in fact, damage his reputation by taking the time to undertake such a thankless task.\nAnd comments in a footnote:\nIt is not within the scope of this paper, however, to discuss technical criteria by which hypotheses are given high, low, or negative degrees of confirmation. Our purpose is simply to glance at several examples of a type of scientific activity which fails completely to conform to scientific standards, but at the same time is the result of such intricate mental activity that it wins temporary acceptance by many laymen insufficiently informed to recognize the scientist's incompetence. Although there obviously is no sharp line separating competent from incompetent research, and there are occasions when a scientific \"orthodoxy\" may delay the acceptance of novel views, the fact remains that the distance between the work of competent scientists and the speculations of a Voliva or Velikovsky is so great that a qualitative difference emerges which justifies the label of \"pseudo-science.\" Since the time of Galileo the history of pseudo-science has been so completely outside the history of science that the two streams touch only in the rarest of instances.\nWhile in the book, Gardner writes:\nIf someone announces that the moon is made of green cheese, the professional astronomer cannot be expected to climb down from his telescope and write a detailed refutation. “A fairly complete textbook of physics would be only part of the answer to Velikovsky,” writes Prof. Laurence J. Lafleur, in his excellent article on “Cranks and Scientists” (\"Scientific Monthly\", Nov., 1951), “and it is therefore not surprising that the scientist does not find the undertaking worth while.”\nAnd in the wrap-up of the chapter:\nJust as an experienced doctor is able to diagnose certain ailments the instant a new patient walks into his office, or a police officer learns to recognize criminal types from subtle behavior clues which escape the untrained eye, so we, perhaps, may learn to recognize the future scientific crank when we first encounter him.\nA contemporary review in the \"Pittsburgh Post-Gazette\" particularly welcomed Gardner's critical remarks about Hoxsey Therapy and about Krebiozen, both of which were being advanced as anti-cancer measures at that time. The review concluded that the book \"should help to counteract some amusing and some positively harmful cults, the existence of which is all too often promoted by irresponsible journalism.\"\n\nThe work has often been mentioned in subsequent books and articles. Louis Lasagna, in his book \"The Doctors' Dilemmas\", considered it to be a \"superb account of scientific cults, fads, and frauds\" and wrote that \"This talented writer combines solid fact with a pleasing style.\"\n\nSociologist of religion Anson D. Shupe took in general a positive attitude, and praises Gardner for his humor. But he says\nIf there is a single criticism to be made of Gardner ... it is that he accepts too comfortably the conventional wisdom, or accepted social reality, of current twentieth-century science and middle-class American Christianity. Somehow it is evident (to me at least) that he is implicitly making a pact with the reader to evaluate these fringe groups in terms of their own shared presumptions about what is \"normal\". Thus he is quite confident throwing around labels like \"quack\", \"crank\" and \"preposterous\". In science the use of such value judgments can be quite time-bound; likewise in religions where today's heresy may become tomorrow's orthodoxy. The odds of course are always on the side of the writer criticizing fringe groups because statistically speaking so few of them survive. However, when a group does weather its infancy and go on to prosper, invariably its original detractors look a bit more arbitrary than they did initially, and then the shoe is on the other foot.\n\nIn the 1980s a fierce interchange took place between Gardner and Colin Wilson. In \"The Quest for Wilhelm Reich\" Wilson wrote of this book(Gardner) writes about various kinds of cranks with the conscious superiority of the scientist, and in most cases one can share his sense of the victory of reason. But after half a dozen chapters this non-stop superiority begins to irritate; you begin to wonder about the standards that make him so certain \"he\" is always right. He asserts that the scientist, unlike the crank, does his best to remain open-minded. So how can he be so \"sure\" that no sane person has ever seen a flying saucer, or used a dowsing rod to locate water? And that all the people he disagrees with are unbalanced fanatics? A colleague of the positivist philosopher A. J. Ayer once remarked wryly \"I wish I was as certain of anything as he seems to be about everything\". Martin Gardner produces the same feeling. By Wilson's own account, up to that time he and Gardner had been friends, but Gardner took offence. In February 1989 Gardner wrote a letter published in \"The New York Review of Books\" describing Wilson as \"England’s leading journalist of the occult, and a firm believer in ghosts, poltergeists, levitations, dowsing, PK (psychokinesis), ESP, and every other aspect of the psychic scene\". Shortly afterwards, Wilson replied, defending himself and adding \"What strikes me as so interesting is that when Mr. Gardner—and his colleagues of CSICOP—begin to denounce the 'Yahoos of the paranormal,' they manage to generate an atmosphere of such intense hysteria ...\". Gardner in turn replied quoting his own earlier description of Wilson: \"The former boy wonder, tall and handsome in his turtleneck sweater, has now decayed into one of those amiable eccentrics for which the land of Conan Doyle is noted. They prowl comically about the lunatic fringes of science ...\"\n\nIn a review of a subsequent Gardner work, Paul Stuewe of the \"Toronto Star\" called \"Fads and Fallacies\" a \"hugely enjoyable demolition of pseudo-scientific nonsense\". Ed Regis, writing in \"The New York Times\", considered the book to be \"the classic put-down of pseudoscience\". Fellow skeptic Michael Shermer called the book \"\"the\" skeptic classic of the past half-century.\" He noted that the mark of popularity for the book came when John W. Campbell denounced the chapter on dianetics over the radio.\n\nMark Erickson, author of \"Science, culture and society: understanding science in the twenty-first century\", noted that Gardner's book provided \"a flavour of the immense optimism surrounding science in the 1950s\" and that his choice of topics were \"interesting\", but also that his attacks on \"osteopathy, chiropractice, and the Bates method for correcting eyesight would raise eyebrows amongst medical practitioners today\".\n\nGardner’s own response to criticism is given in his preface:\n\n\n"}

Her parents divorced when she was young, and she was raised by her mother, the portrait artist Edith Stevenson Wright, while her brother, Blaine, went to live with his father, Ivan Wright, a theater critic in New York City. The siblings did not meet again until Dare moved to New York City in her twenties. Wright spent her formative years in Cleveland Heights.\n\nWright graduated from Laurel School in Shaker Heights in 1933 at the top of her class, and relocated to New York to attend the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. In 1935, she was cast in a small role as a maid in a stage production of \"Pride and Prejudice\", which she performed in Washington, D.C. and on Broadway.\n\nIn 1957, she photographed her childhood Lenci doll, Edith, along with two teddy bears bought at FAO Schwarz, for her first children's book, titled \"The Lonely Doll\". The book made \"The New York Times\" Best Seller list for children's books. In November 2010, The British Newspaper \"The Guardian\" named \"The Lonely Doll\" one of the 10 Best Illustrated Children's Books of all time. It was followed by eighteen other stories. Out of print for many years, it was reissued in 1998, introducing Wright to a new generation of readers. Another children's work, \"Lona: A Fairy Tale,\" features photographs of Wright herself dressed as a fairy princess, while using another doll in identical costume to give the illusion that Wright's character has been \"transformed\" to doll-size by a wicked wizard. \"Make Me Real\", which features another of Wright's childhood dolls, and \"Ocracoke in The Fifties\", her only book written for adults, have been published posthumously.\n\nDare Wright's photographs were exhibited for the first time in 2012 by Fred Torres Collaborations.\n\nThroughout her adulthood, Wright remained close to her mother and never married despite receiving a number of proposals.

Pinkney was often said to be the last surviving original member of The Drifters, who achieved international fame with numerous hit records. He was chiefly responsible for its early sounds. The Drifters have had a strong influence on soul, rhythm and blues, and rock and roll music. As an original group member, Bill Pinkney was a 1988 inductee into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame with The Drifters .\n\nBorn Willie Pinkney in Dalzell, South Carolina, Pinkney grew up singing his favorite music, gospel, in his church choir. He was raised in a Christian home, and at an early age accepted Jesus Christ as his personal Savior joining Mount Olive AME Church. He served in the United States Army in World War II. He earned a Presidential Citation with five service stars (for battles including Normandy and Bastogne under General Patton). Returning from the war, Pinkney began to sing again in various gospel choirs. There he met and joined with the men who became the original members of the Drifters.\n\nBill Pinkney, brothers Andrew and Gerhart Thrasher, and bass singer Willie Ferbie were approached by Clyde McPhatter, who had just quit as the lead tenor of the popular R&B group, Billy Ward & the Dominoes. McPhatter proposed they create a new group to record for Atlantic Records. On their first record, \"Money Honey\", Pinkney, a natural bass-baritone with a multi-octave range, actually sang first tenor.\n\nAfter Ferbie left, Pinkney switched to the bass part, in which he was heard on \"Honey Love,\" \"White Christmas\", \"Adorable\", \"Ruby Baby\", and many other early Drifters recordings. In 1954, the Drifters recorded their version of \"White Christmas\" by Irving Berlin. That version was featured in the 1990 movie \"Home Alone\", as well as the 1994 movie \"The Santa Clause.\" Pinkney can also be heard singing lead on the 1956 recording \"I Should Have Done Right\" and 1955's \"Steamboat\". Pinkney was in and out of the group from 1956 through 1958. He did not participate in the recording of later hits like \"Fools Fall in Love\" and \"Drip Drop\", which featured bass singer Tommy Evans.\n\nAfter Pinkney's permanent departure, The Drifters recorded hit classics such as \"Under the Boardwalk\", \"Save the Last Dance for Me\", \"There Goes My Baby\", \"Up on the Roof\", and \"On Broadway\", with a completely new line-up.\n\nIn 1958, George Treadwell, the group manager fired all of the individual Drifters and hired all new singers, The Crowns (formally known as the Five Crowns), signing them under the Drifters' name. Pinkney was forced to leave. Pinkney quickly created a group called the Original Drifters, made up of key members of the first (1953–58) association. Pinkney's Original Drifters was consistently popular throughout the southeastern United States. For decades their music was a staple of the \"beach music\" scene.\n\nLeaders such as President Bill Clinton and President Nelson Mandela of South Africa recognized Pinkney's contributions. Pinkney received many musical awards, including the Rhythm and Blues Foundation Pioneer Award, and was inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, United Group Harmony Association, and the Beach Music Hall of Fame.\n\nHe was selected for the South Carolina Black Hall of Fame and given a \"key to the state\", which proclaimed May 14 as Bill Pinkney Day. The cities of Sumter, Bamberg, and Myrtle Beach (all South Carolina), each presented its \"key to the city\" to Pinkney. He was honored by the United States Senate and the United States House of Representatives. In 2002, Pinkney received an Honorary Doctorate of Fine Music from Coastal Carolina University.\n\nPinkney died on July 4, 2007 in Daytona Beach, Florida from a heart attack, while staying at the Daytona Beach Hilton. Funeral services were held on July 9, 2007 at the Sumter County Exhibition Center in Sumter, South Carolina. Pinkney was buried at St. Luke's AME Church in Sumter.\n\nNote\n\n"}

To achieve these goals, it involves subsidiary organizations such as the Military Staff Committee and the Committee of Experts. \n\nMembers are elected by the African Union Executive Council and endorsed by the Assembly of the African Union so as to reflect regional balance within Africa, as well as a variety of other criteria, including capacity to contribute militarily and financially to the union, political will to do so, and effective diplomatic presence at Addis Ababa. \n\nThe council is composed of fifteen countries, of which five are elected to three-year terms, and ten to two-year terms. Countries are immediately re-eligible upon the expiration of their terms.\n\nIn the early 1990s, members of the Organization of African Unity (OAU), the predecessor to the African Union (AU), decided to abstain from active peacekeeping operations and focus instead on \"preventive diplomacy\". However, they reevaluated their stances after conflicts in Rwanda and Burundi.\n\nIn 1995, members of the OAU started to support the use of peacekeeping operations after a summit in Addis Ababa. However, the OAU still prioritized preventive diplomacy and believed that the United Nations should shoulder most of the responsibility for organizing peacekeeping operations.\n\nLater conflicts in Africa were largely mediated by African institutions rather than the UN. For example, conflicts in Liberia and Sierra Leone were addressed by the Economic Community of West African States. Similarly, conflicts in Lesotho and the Democratic Republic of Congo were addressed by the Southern African Development Community.\n\nThese sub-regional organizations' large role in addressing regional conflicts led to a debate about the effectiveness of the OAU. Members specifically wished to reform the OAU's focus on consensus-based meetings rather than on-the-ground action, since some conflicts' actors were part of the meetings and could interfere with their judgement. Similarly, the large size of the OAU, its consensus decision-making and its lack of clear procedures both obstructed constructive debate. However, on-the-ground interventions were also limited by the OAU's non-interventionist principles, which only allowed domestic military intervention with the state's consent.\n\nThus, in 2001, an OAU Assembly session moved to reform the OAU's mechanisms in a new institution: the African Union. The new African Union was designed to center around a central decision-making organ with concrete rules, a smaller membership of 15 states to facilitate decision-making, majority rather than consensus-based decision-making, and viable options to recommend military intervention to the African Union Assembly. After some debate, this decision-making organ was coined the Peace and Security Council, and its rules were outlined in the Protocol Relating to the Establishment of the Peace and Security Council.\n\nAdopted in July 2002, the Protocol was later ratified by a majority of AU members in December 2003. Within the Protocol's text, the institutional design, subsidiary committees, powers and goals of the PSC were outlined.\n\nSpecifically, its Objectives were stated in Article 3, and its Principles were stated in Article 4. When outlining its Principles, the Protocol cites three inspirations: \"the [AU's] Constitutive Act, the Charter of the United Nations and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights\".\n\nIn Article 5, the Protocol details the PSC's membership structure and membership criteria.\n\nArticle 8 outlines the PSC's procedural rules, including rules for voting, organizing meetings and creating subsidiary bodies.\n\nSpecific subcommittees that support the PSC, such as the Panel of the Wise, the Continental Early Warning System, and the African Standby Force are detailed in Articles 11, 12 and 13, respectively.\n\nFinally, the Protocol outlines the PSC's relationship with regional bodies in Article 16, and relationship with international organizations, especially the UN, in Article 17.\n\nThere are three levels of PSC meetings: meetings between permanent representatives, meetings between ministers, and meetings between heads of state. Permanent representative meetings meet at least twice a month, whereas the other two levels meet at least once per year.\n\nUntil 2007, there were three types of meetings: formal meetings, briefing sessions and consultations. In formal meetings, members discuss AU Commission reports, which often concern brewing conflicts. In briefing sessions, PSC staff briefs members on various subject areas and themes, such as terrorism and development. In consultation meetings, PSC members work to gather various actors and develop an understanding of a certain issue.\n\nAfter a brainstorming session in July of 2007, the PSC instead chose to meet under four types of meetings: public meetings, closed meetings, consultations and \"Arria-type\" meetings. In \"Arria-type\" meetings, PSC members meet with non-state actors and carry out informal discussions. \n\nAs of 2016, the PSC has held over 600 meetings.\n\nEvery month, a new chairperson is selected from the PSC members. This selection cycles through the alphabetical order of the PSC's member country names, in English.\n\nAlthough the PSC was partly inspired by the United Nations Security Council, unlike the UNSC, the PSC does not have any permanent members or veto power. All 15 members have equal power in the Council. Ten members are elected for two years and five members are elected for three years. Members are elected to represent Africa's regional distribution. In order, each potential member must meet certain criteria. These criteria are outlined in Article five of the Protocol Relating to the Establishment of the Peace and Security Council.\n\nAs of November 2018, the following countries occupy the seats of the PSC:\n\nThe mission of the PSC is to respond to conflicts in Africa. The PSC relies on collective security and its early warning detection systems. Article 3 of the Relating to the Establishment of the Peace and Security Council expands upon the PSC's objectives.\n\nArticle 7 of the Protocol Relating to the Establishment of the Peace and Security Council lists the PSC's power.\n\nSome of these powers include undertaking \"peace-making and peace-building functions to resolve conflicts\", recommending intervention to the AU Assembly in \"grave circumstances, namely war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity\", promoting a close relationship with regional bodies as well as with the United Nations, facilitating humanitarian action and finally, deciding \"on any other issue having implications for the maintenance of peace, security and stability on the Continent\".\n\nThe following peace support operations have been conducted under an AU mandate, or with AU authorisation.\n(1) African Union Mission in Burundi (AMIB) - 2003 to 2004\n\nAU mandated 2 April 2003 (for a period of 12 months); deployed 27 April 2003 to 31 May 2004 when the mission was succeeded by a UN mission. The Head of Mission and Special Representative of the Chairperson of the AU Commission was Ambassador Mamadou Bah (Guinea). The Force Commander of AMIB’s military component was Major-General Sipho Binda (South Africa), while his deputy, Brigadier-General G. Ayele, was from Ethiopia.\n(2) African Union Mission in Sudan (AMIS) – 2004 to 2007 \n(3) African Union Military Observer Mission in the Comoros (MIOC) - 2004\n(4) African Union Mission for Support to the Elections in Comoros (AMISEC) – 2006\n(5) African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) – 2007 to present\n\nOn 20 February 2007 the UN Security Council adopted SC Resolution 1744, which authorised AMISOM’s deployment.\n(6) African Union Electoral and Security Assistance Mission to the Comoros (MAES) – 2007 to 2008\n(7) African Union/ United Nations Hybrid Mission (UNAMID) - 2008 to present\n\nOn 31 July 2007 UN Security Council Resolution 1769 (UNSC 2007) established the AU/ UN Hybrid Operation in Darfur, also referred to as UNAMID.\n(8) Regional Cooperation Initiative for the Elimination of the Lord’s Resistance Army (RCI-LRA) - 2011 to 2017\n\nAuthorised by the AU Peace and Security Council in November 2011.\n(9) African-led International Support Mission to Mali (AFISMA) – 2013\n(10) African-led Support Mission to the Central African Republic (MISCA) – 2013 to 2014\n\nA regional peace support mission - the Mission for the consolidation of peace in Central African Republic (MICOPAX) - was deployed in 2008 under the leadership of the Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS). But a new crisis erupted in 2012-2013, when Séléka forces seized the capital Bangui. In response, on 19 July 2013, the AU Peace and Security Council approved the deployment of MISCA. The transfer of authority between ECCAS/MICOPAX and the AU/MISCA mission took place on 19 December 2013. The mission ended with the transfer of authority from MISCA to the UN mission MINUSCA on 15 September 2014.\n(11) Multinational Joint Task Force (MNJTF) – 2015 to present\n(12) Regional Protection Force - 2017 to present\n\nDuring July 2016 the AU agreed to a Regional Protection Force to bolster the UN mission in South Sudan, similar to the United Nations Force Intervention Brigade role with the MONUSCO mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo UN Security Council resolution 2304 adopted on 12 August 2016 approved the deployment of a Regional Protection Force to the UN Mission in South Sudan to provide a secure environment in and around Juba. Rwandan troops deployed during 2017 as part of the proposed force, but there has been little subsequent news of this force and it appears it may have been merely absorbed into the larger UN mission. It included a Bangladeshi engineer company and a Nepalese company in addition to a Rwandan mechanised infantry battalion, so cannot be said to be an African force.\n\nDuring December 2015 the Peace and Security Council authorised a force of up to 5000 troops to be deployed to Burundi for six months to help restore order in that country following an outbreak of politically-inspired violence. However, the African Prevention and Protection Mission in Burundi (MAPROBU) was not welcomed by the Government of Burundi and never deployed to the troubled country.\n\nSome AU members criticized the PSC Protocol for being vague on which institution has the \"primary legal authority\" to use military force; in Article 16, the PSC Protocol states that the AU has \"the primary responsibility for promoting peace, security and stability in Africa\" whereas in Article 17, the Protocol states that the UN Security Council \"has the primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security\".\n\nBen Kioko, the African Union's legal adviser, argued that \"[some African] leaders have shown themselves willing to push the frontiers of collective stability and security to the limit without any regard for legal niceties such as the authorization of the [United Nations] Security Council\".\n\nLater in 2005, African Union members acknowledged the Security Council's authority on military use, as demonstrated in a meeting roadmap which promised that the AU would first get Security Council authorization before carrying out military interventions.\n\nSome officials within the PSC have also argued that the PSC should broaden its scope beyond traditional military threats to security, and also address nontraditional threats such as disease and climate change.\n\nConversely, others question the political will of PSC and AU members to follow the PSC protocol and carry out military interventions against other members without their consent in cases of mass human rights abuses. Furthermore, the PSC relies on regional bodies contributing funds or troops for operations, but many regional bodies do not have enough resources to meet these standards.\n\nWhen electing members into the PSC itself, critics have noted that members who were actively disobeying AU decisions or carrying out human rights violations within their borders have still been admitted into the Council because the Assembly of the African Union Heads of State did not properly evaluate the potential members' compliance to the PSC membership criteria.  \n\nAboagye, Festus (2004) The African Mission in Burundi: Lessons learned from the first African Union peacekeeping operation. ‘'Conflict Trends'’ 2: 9–15.\n\nBoutellis, A. & Williams, P.D.

An electric field will be induced normal to both.\n\nThis effect is quantified by the Nernst coefficient |\"N\"|, which is defined to be\n\nwhere formula_2 is the y-component of the electric field that results from the magnetic field's z-component formula_3 and the temperature gradient formula_4.\n\nThe reverse process is known as the Ettingshausen effect and also as the second Nernst–Ettingshausen effect.\n\nMobile energy carriers (for example conduction-band electrons in a semiconductor) will move along temperature gradients due to statistics and the relationship\nbetween temperature and kinetic energy. If there is a magnetic field transversal to the temperature gradient and the carriers are electrically charged, they experience a force perpendicular to their direction of motion (also the direction of the temperature gradient) and to the magnetic field. Thus, a perpendicular electric field is induced.\n\nSemiconductors exhibit the Nernst effect. This has been studied in the 1950s by Krylova, Mochan and many others. In metals however, it is almost non-existent. It appears in the vortex phase\nof type-II superconductors due to vortex motion. This has been studied by Huebener et al. High-temperature superconductors exhibit the Nernst effect both in the superconducting and in the pseudogap phase, as was first found by Xu et al. Heavy-Fermion superconductors can show a strong Nernst signal which is likely not due to the vortices, as was found by Bel et al.\n\n\n"}

Rising above the harbor, its name is said to refer to its resemblance to the traditional shape of concentrated refined loaf sugar. It is known worldwide for its cableway and panoramic views of the city and beyond.\n\nThe mountain is one of several monolithic granite and quartz mountains that rise straight from the water's edge around Rio de Janeiro. Geologically, it is considered part of a family of steep-sided rock outcroppings known as non-inselberg bornhardts.\n\nThe mountain is protected by the Sugarloaf Mountain and Urca Hill Natural Monument, created in 2006. \nThis became part of a World Heritage Site declared by UNESCO in 2012.\n\nThe name Sugarloaf was coined in the 16th century by the Portuguese during the heyday of sugarcane trade in Brazil. According to historian Vieira Fazenda, blocks of sugar were placed in conical molds made of clay to be transported on ships. The form of the peak reminded them of the well-known resulting \"sugarloaf\" shape, and the nickname has since been extended to be a general descriptor for formations of this kind.\n\nA glass-walled cable car (\"bondinho\" or, more formally, \"teleférico\"), capable of holding 65 people, runs along a route between the peaks of Sugarloaf and Morro da Urca every 20 minutes. The original cable car line was built in 1912 and rebuilt around 1972–73 and in 2008. The cable car goes from a ground station, at the base of Morro da Babilônia, to Morro da Urca and thence to Sugarloaf's summit.\n\nTo reach the summit, passengers take two cable cars. The first ascends to the shorter Morro da Urca, high. The second car ascends to Pão de Açúcar. The Swiss-made bubble-shaped cars offer passengers 360° views of the surrounding city. The ascent takes three minutes from start to finish.\n\n\n\n\n\nVisitors can watch rock climbers on Sugarloaf and the other two mountains in the area, Morro da Babilônia and Morro da Urca. Together, they form one of the largest urban climbing areas in the world, with more than 270 routes, between 1 and 10 pitches long.\n\n"}

Currently led by Ancel Roget, the union was born out of the 1937 labour riots, the union was nominally led by the imprisoned TUB Butler but was actually organised by lawyer Adrian Cola Rienzi. The union was established on July 25, 1937, and formally registered on September 15. The first meetings were held in Fyzabad, and the first official headquarters were established on Coffee Street, San Fernando.\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, under the leadership of George Weekes, the union grew into a potent political force, playing a role in the Black Power movement in 1970 and playing a role in the foundation of the United Labour Front. The Oilfields Workers' Trade Union (OWTU), widely recognized as the strongest and most militant trade union in Trinidad and Tobago and the Anglophone Caribbean, was born out of the General Strike that started on June 19, 1937, in the oilfields of south Trinidad. This was the most powerful of the mass actions that were taking place across the Caribbean, as the working class throughout the region were taking a stand and making their voices heard as they struggled against the poor working conditions which they were experiencing. At the same time the vast majority of workers faced social conditions such as very poor housing, inadequate health care, the lack of educational opportunities and racial discrimination, among other ills.\nFrom the mid-1930s workers began to express their discontent through increasingly militant actions. Unemployment was high and wages which were low were reduced even as the employer class sought to ensure that they lost little in the face of the global economic crisis precipitated by the Wall Street Crash of 1929 and the Great Depression that followed. In addition to the many issues related to the poor working and social conditions which prevailed, these struggles also had a very important political dimension. The workers were also struggling against colonialism as evidenced by their call for \"Home Rule\". They knew that achieving independence would be a means to improving the conditions that they were then facing.\n\nIn this period of heightened mobilization against these injustices a leader emerged – Tubal Uriah \"Buzz\" Butler. Under his leadership the strike began on June 19, 1937 – the day Trinidad and Tobago commemorates today as Labour Day. The strike soon spread throughout Trinidad and involved all major sectors of workers (dockworkers, sugar workers, cocoa estate workers, railway workers and store workers) in the island. The uprising lasted until July 2, and the colonial authorities required the intervention of British troops from two battleships the Exeter and the Ajax to quell the protests. During this strike, 14 lives were lost, including that of policeman, Charlie King, hundreds were injured and many persons were arrested.\n\nIt was out of these dynamic and historic circumstances that the OWTU was born. The first official meeting of the Union was held on July 15, 1937, at Mr. Williams quarters, Coon Town, Forest Reserve, Fyzabad. The first officers elected to office were Caleb Roach, Chairman, McDonald Moses, Vice President, E. R. Blades, Secretary and E. Bennet, Treasurer. The OWTU was formally established just days later on July 25, 1937, at its Founding Conference, held at Saltfish Hall, Mucurapo Street in San Fernando. The Union was registered on September 15, 1937.\n\nWith Butler having to go into hiding after June 19 due to an warrant for his arrest on sedition and treason charges, a leader emerged – Adrian Cola Rienzi - who became the Union's first President General. Rienzi also became the first President of the All Trinidad Sugar Estates and Factory Workers' Trade Union (ATSEFWTU). At the same time McDonald Moses was made Vice President of both the OWTU and the ATSEFWTU unions. The OWTU's first Central Office established at 16 Coffee Street in San Fernando was also shared by the ATSEFWTU. The Blue Shirt uniform for which the OWTU is well known has been worn since the 1930s.\n\n"}

(BrT, ) was a major Brazilian telecommunications company headquartered in the Brazilian capital of Brasilia. The company was one of three land lines and eight mobile telephone companies – and only long-distance service provider – that emerged in Brazil following the break-up of Telebrás. Originally the company was called Tele Centro Sul, because its service covered the states in the central and southern parts of Brazil, namely Acre, Rondônia, Goiás, Tocantins, Mato Grosso, Mato Grosso do Sul, Paraná, Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul, as well as the Distrito Federal. Since 9 January 2009, the company is a subsidiary of Oi.\n\nThe Brazilian investment bank Opportunity, which managed funds for investors including Citigroup and some Brazilian pension funds, in partnership with Telecom Italia, paid 2.07 billion reais in June 1998 to buy Tele Centro Sul from the Brazilian government as part of the privatization process of Telebrás. In 2001, the company purchased small stake in the iBest Co. website and launched a portal and free internet access service; at the time, the Marcos Wettreich was the main shareholder in iBest. After some legal wrangling, Citigroup and the Brazilian pension funds took control of the company, removing Opportunity from the management of their respective funds and took control of the company in 2005. BrT started up a wireless service in 2004.\n\nBrasil Telecom's stock is traded on BM&F Bovespa, where it is part of the Ibovespa index, as well as on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nIn 2008, it was announced that Brasil Telecom would be acquired by Oi. That transaction required changes in legislation, since legislation at the time prohibited a fixed telephone company from purchasing another fixed telephone company in a different license area. That legislation has since changed, and Oi completed its purchase of BrT on January 9, 2009.\n\nBrasil Telecom, the country's third largest fixed-line operator, and Opportunity, which controlled Brasil Telecom, hired Kroll to determine whether Telecom Italia competed with Brasil Telecom in 2000 in the latter's acquisition of the Brazilian fixed-line phone company Companhia Riograndense de Telecomunicoes ('CRT') from Spain's Telefónica with the purpose of increasing the final price paid by Brasil Telecom for CRT, as both Opportunity and Telecom Italia were struggling for the control of Brasil Telecom.\nBrasil Telecom and Telecom Italia have been locked in court struggles since 2000. Kroll was accused of spying on Brazilian government officials.\nAdditionally, Opportunity also became involved in legal disputes with the investors in its managed funds, namely some Brazilian pension funds and Citigroup, which culminated in Opportunity's removal as the manager of these funds and, ultimately, Opportunity's losing the control of Brasil Telecom (along with other companies controlled by the funds, namely Telemig Celular, Amazonia Celular, Santos Brasil, and Opportrans/Rio de Janeiro's subway operator).\n\n\n"}

One such law is Riccò's law, discovered by astronomer Annibale Riccò. This law explains the visual relationship between a target angular area \"A\" and target contrast \"C\" required for detection when that target is unresolved (that is, is too small in the field of view to make out different parts of it). It is given by:\n\nwhere \"K\" is a constant (for a given background, see below).\n\nRiccò's law is applicable for regions where the target being detected is unresolved. The resolution of the human eye (the receptive field size) is approximately one arc-minute in the center (the fovea) but the size increases in peripheral vision. Riccò's law is applicable for targets of angular area less than the size of the receptive field. This region is variable based on the amount of background luminance. Riccò's law is based on the fact that within a receptive field, the light energy (or the number of photons per second) required to lead to the target being detected is summed over the area and is thus proportional to the luminance and to the area. Therefore, the contrast threshold required for detection is proportional to the signal-to-noise ratio multiplied by the noise divided by the area. This leads to the above equation.\n\nThe \"constant\" \"K\" is actually a function of the background luminance \"B\" to which the eye is assumed to be adapted. It has been shown by Andrew Crumey that for unconstrained vision (that is, observers could either look directly or at the target or avert their gaze) an accurate empirical formula for \"K\" is\n\nwhere \"c\", \"c\" are constants taking different values for scotopic and photopic vision. For low \"B\" this approximates to the De Vries-Rose Law for threshold contrast \"C\"\n\nHowever, at very low background luminance (less than 10 candela per square metre) the threshold value for the illuminance\nis a constant (around 10 lux) and does not depend on \"B\". In that case\nor\n\nAt high \"B\" such as the daylight sky, Crumey's formula approaches an asymptotic value for \"K\" of or lux per nit.\n\nRicco’s Areas are any areas of the retina where cells can detect a visual stimulus at threshold. The areas will change in location and size depending on the type of cells, the light conditions and the type of stimulus. \n\n"}

Until the West Line to 69 Street Southwest opened in 2012, Route 202's western terminus was at this platform. In addition, some Route 201 trains going southward started trips here. It was located at the western end of the free fare zone.\n\nUnlike other side-loading platforms on the 7 Avenue S transit mall, 10 Street station was the only centre-loading platform, allowing passengers to board on either side of the station (access to the station was offered from the nearby intersection, though users commonly jumped off the platform and walked across the street).\n\nThe 10 Street SW platform was one of six downtown platforms slated for refurbishment as part of the next phase of Calgary Transit's Seventh Avenue refurbishment project. The station underwent a design study in 2006, and at that time was chosen as the next of the downtown stations to be rebuilt and expanded to handle four car trains. Construction of the new station was deferred in 2007 with the approval of funding for the West LRT, and was constructed when the West LRT extension began construction in late 2009. The new station is located one block west of the current station and is designed as a dual side-loading station with a similar design to the rest of the refurbished downtown stations.\n\nThe platform served the Downtown West End community, both residential and businesses. A short walk from the platform is the Mewata Armoury, Kerby Centre (a major seniors facility) and Shaw Millennium skatepark. Greyhound Canada provided a shuttle service from the station to its bus depot. Once the West LRT project was completed in 2012, the shuttle ceased operation, as the new Sunalta station is located across a major street with an overpass to the bus terminal itself.\n\nOn an unknown date in 2012, the City of Calgary website posted a .pdf page about this station being renamed. Instead of just being called \"11 Street S.W.\", the station's new official name will be the Downtown West–Kerby station. On September 15, 2012, this station was permanently closed and removed, in preparing for the realignment of the tracks between 9 and 10 Streets W.\n"}

He was forced by circumstances to work at a very young age and had little formal education. Nevertheless, beginning with a small investment from money saved from menial jobs, he bought into the penny arcade business. Shortly after, in partnership with Adolph Zukor and others, he founded the successful but short-lived Automatic Vaudeville Company which established a chain of arcades across several cities. After the company dissolved in 1904 Loew converted his share of the business into nickelodeons and over time he turned Loew's Theatres into a leading chain of vaudeville and movie theaters in the United States.\n\nBy 1905, Marcus Loew was on his own and his success eventually necessitated that he secure a steady flow of product for his theaters. In 1904, he founded the People's Vaudeville Company, a theater chain which showcased one-reel films as well as live variety shows. In 1910, the company had considerably expanded and was renamed Loew's Consolidated Enterprises. His associates included Adolph Zukor, Joseph Schenck, and Nicholas Schenck. In addition to theaters, Loew and the Schencks expanded the Fort George Amusement Park in upper Manhattan.\nBy 1913, Loew operated a large number of theaters in New York City including the American Music Hall, Avenue A Theatre, Avenue B Theatre, Broadway Theatre (41st St.), Circle Theatre, and the Columbia Theatre in Brooklyn. Other Loew-operated theaters were the Delancey St. Theatre, Greeley Sq. Theatre, Herald Square Theatre, Liberty Theatre, Brooklyn, Lincoln Sq. Theatre, National Theatre (149th St.), Plaza Theatre, 7th Ave. Theatre (124th St.), Shubert Theatre, Brooklyn, and the Yorkville Theatre. Outside of New York, he managed the Columbia Theatre (Washington, D.C.) Columbia Theatre (Boston) and the Metropolitan Opera House (Philadelphia).\n\nLoew found himself faced with a serious dilemma: his merged companies lacked a central managerial command structure. Loew preferred to remain in New York overseeing the growing chain of Loew's Theatres. Film production had been gravitating toward southern California since 1913. By 1917 he oversaw a number of enterprises: Borough Theatre Co., Empress Amusement Corp., Fort George Amusement Co., Glendive Amusement Corp., Greeley Square Amusement Co., Loew's Consolidated Enterprise, Loew's Theatrical Enterprises, Mascot Amusement Co., Natonia Amusement Co., People's Vaudeville Co. In 1919, Loew reorganized the company under the name Loew's, Inc.\n\nIn 1920, Loew purchased Metro Pictures Corporation. A few years later, he acquired a controlling interest in the financially troubled Goldwyn Picture Corporation which at that point was controlled by theater impresario Lee Shubert. Goldwyn Pictures owned the \"Leo the Lion\" trademark and studio property in Culver City, California. But without its founder Samuel Goldwyn, the Goldwyn studio lacked strong management. With Loew's vice president Nicholas Schenck needed in New York City to help manage the large East Coast movie theater operations, Loew had to find a qualified executive to take charge of this new Los Angeles entity.\n\nLoew recalled meeting a film producer named Louis B. Mayer who had been operating a successful, if modest, studio in east Los Angeles. Mayer had been making low budget melodramas for a number of years, marketing them primarily to women. Since he rented most of his equipment and hired most of his stars on a per-picture basis, Loew wasn't after Mayer's brick and mortar business; he wanted Mayer and his Chief of Production, the former Universal Pictures executive, Irving Thalberg. Nicholas Schenck was dispatched to finalize the deal that ultimately resulted in the formation of Metro-Goldwyn Pictures in April 1924 with Mayer as the studio head and Thalberg chief of production.\n\nMayer's company folded into Metro Goldwyn with two notable additions: Mayer Pictures' contracts with key directors such as Fred Niblo and John M. Stahl, and up-and-coming actress Norma Shearer, later married to Thalberg. Mayer would eventually be rewarded by having his name added to the company. Loews Inc. would act as MGM's financier and retain controlling interest for decades.\n\nWhile immediately successful, Loew didn't live to see the powerhouse that MGM was to become. He died three years later in 1927 of a heart attack at the age of 57 at his country home in Glen Cove, New York. Reporting his death, Variety called him \"the most beloved man of all show business of all time\". He was interred in the Maimonides Cemetery in Brooklyn.\n\nFor his very significant contribution to the development of the motion picture industry, Marcus Loew has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1617 Vine Street. To this day, the Loew name is synonymous with movie theaters.\n\nHe and his wife Carrie had twin sons, David L Loew (1897–1973) and Arthur Marcus Loew Sr (1897–1977). Arthur married Mildred Zukor, daughter of Adolph Zukor and became president of MGM. Arthur's son Arthur Loew Jr. (1925–1995) was an actor, producer and writer.\n\n"}

In 2004, Strong graduated \"magna cum laude\" from Columbia University as an English major. He completed his Master of Fine Arts in Fiction and Literature in June 2009 at Bennington College.\n\nStrong began his acting career at the age of nine, when he starred as Gavroche in the San Francisco production of \"Les Misérables\", alongside Larisa Oleynik as Young Cosette. After the stage production, he appeared in small screen roles on television. In 1992, he received his first regular television series role as Julie Andrews's son on \"Julie\".

During the seven-year run, he was nominated twice for the Young Artist Award and nominated for once for \"The Hollywood Reporter\" YoungStar Award. He found it difficult coping with his newfound fame, citing at least one breakdown at 15 when he was on a \"Sail With the Stars\" charity cruise. However, in a later interview, Strong also stated that he was inconsiderate with his power, having previously set up weekly six hour roundtrip commutes back to Sonoma with his mother and brother.\n\nStrong permanently moved to Los Angeles at 16 and later attended morning classes at Occidental College.

Located in one of the oldest wine growing regions in France, Château Pécany had a small vineyard for producing house wine. With excellent terrain, soil, and environment, this vineyard developed a reputation for producing some of the best wines of the region.\n\nJean Siegler (second cousin to the de Courssou Family) bought the property in 1926, and, over time, enlarged the vineyard by buying surrounding land and plantation rights. The Pécany wine was first offered for commercial sale during this time. The château and vineyards remained in the Siegler family until, in the spring of 1973, a local farmer and vintner Jean Saladin bought most of the vineyards for his son Gérard Saladin. Under G. Saladin's relatively poor management and lack of attention, the quality of the vinification gradually decreased until, in 1998, Gérard Saladin opted to convert to the less time-consuming, and less profitable, path of selling bulk wine to the local vintners co-operative. In more recent years, G. Saladin did not vinify any wine, but instead sold the Pécany grapes in bulk.\n\nIn 1990, Château Pécany, but not the surrounding vineyards, was brought under the proprietorship of a single owner when Marie-France Siegler purchased the chateau from her siblings.\n\nIn July 2006 Véronique Langlands-Perry was appointed as sales and marketing director for the vineyard to expand sales of the Château's wines worldwide. \n"}

It is native to mountainous regions of Department Tarija, Bolivia between and .\n\nIts slender, erect, grey-green columns can reach a height of , but are only about across. The columns are formed from around 25 ribs and are densely covered with areoles, supporting four yellow-brown spines up to long and 20 shorter white radials.\n\nThe cactus prefers free draining soils, strong sunlight, but not high temperatures — in fact it can withstand hard frosts down to -10 °C. In its natural habitat it receives plenty of water during the summer, but almost none over the winter. In cultivation, watering too much in winter often leads to root rot.\n\nOlder cactuses, over tall, produce deep red, burgundy, flowers in late summer. The long cylindrical flowers protrude horizontally from the columns. In common with other cacti in the genus \"Cleistocactus\", the flowers hardly open, with only the style and stamens protruding. Cultivated plants often flower freely. In the United Kingdom, this plant is usually grown under glass, and has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. \n\nThe silver torch cactus (\"Cleistocactus strausii\") derives its name from the Greek word \"kleistos\" which means \"closed.\" This is due to its deep red/burgundy flowers rarely opening.\n\nThe cactus has gray-green columns that grow up to 3 meters tall and several centimetres in diameter which are covered in white spines. Only older plants will blossom deep red/burgundy cylindrical flowers. These flowers emerge horizontally from the stem of the cactus. They are deep red to burgundy and grow up to 10cm long.\n\nThe silver torch cactus, which has many names (snow pole, wooly torch), is a perennial cactus endemic to Department Tarija of Bolivia. As such, this cactus prefers mountainous regions that are dry and semi-arid. Like other cacti and succulents, it thrives in porous soil and full sun. While partial sunlight is the minimum requirement for survival, full sunlight for several hours a day is required for the silver torch cactus to bloom flowers. \n\nSilver torch cacti can thrive in low-nitrogen soil without facing the consequences of low nitrogen. Too much water will make the plants weak and lead to root rot. \n\nThis cactus is locally abundant in its native land and has few local threats to its survival, so it is rated Least Concern.\n\nThis cactus can be propagated by cuttings or seed. \n\nCuttings should be taken near the base of the main stem, similar to cuttings for aloe vera. Rooting of this new cutting usually occurs within 3-8 weeks, therefore it is usually better to propagate silver torch cactus via seed.\n\nAs a houseplant, the silver torch cactus is an easy to take care of so long as over-watering is avoided. To naturally simulate the porous effects of the sand in its native habitat, it is important to ensure that excess water will not pool in the soil, causing the roots to become water logged.\n\nThis plant’s native habitat does not have winter, but when temperatures drop to the low twenties, it can exhibit signs of tip frost. \n\nSilver torch cactus is most susceptible to mealybugs and spider mite. \n\nMealybugs are one of the most common pests of cacti and succulents. Mealybugs can be identified by their white, cottony masses on the plant. These are signs that the bugs are reproducing. These pests are especially problematic to plants such as the silver torch cactus because they suck out plant sap, depleting the strength of the plant. These plant-sucking bugs can also cause sooty mold along with their fluffy white wax, detracting from the appearance of these plants. Another form of mealybug attacks the root system of plants, which is harder to detect.\n\nMites thrive in the same hot, dry conditions that the silver torch cactus lives in. Spider mites cause damage by sucking out vital nutrients from the plant. Large populations of mites can cause irreversible damage on the plant, eventually killing the plant. \n\nHowever, both pests can be hosed off the cactus with water.\n\n"}

During the summer the tombolo is above sea level and accessible to walkers. During winter, stronger wave action removes sand from the beach so that it is usually covered at high tide, and occasionally throughout the tidal cycle, until the sand is returned the following spring. Depending on the definition used, St. Ninian's is thus either an island, or a peninsula; it has an area of about 72 hectares. \n\nThe nearest settlement is Bigton, also in the parish of Dunrossness.

Many seabirds, including puffins, visit the island, with several species nesting there.\n\nAs its name suggests, the island has ecclesiastical connections, which may like others in the Northern Isles, Hebrides and Faroes have connections to the Culdees or \"papar\". However, the island's history is far older than Christianity, and Neolithic graves have been found within the walls of the chapel (formerly beneath the floor).\n\nThe ruins of a 12th-century chapel can still be seen near the end of the tombolo. The dedication is to Shetland's patron saint, the enigmatic Saint Ninian of Galloway, who is also widely venerated on the nearby Orkney Islands, and may be commemorated in the name of North Ronaldsay. In 1958, an excavation found a hoard of 8th century silver in the chapel grounds under a stone slab in a wooden box, which caused a renewed archaeological interest in the island. It was suspected to have been buried to hide it from, or stolen in, a Viking raid. The remains of a pre-Norse chapel were also found, which may indicate some kind of Culdee presence.\n\nThe last family to live on the island, that of Henry Leask, left the island in 1796. Henry Leask was married twice and had 13 children.\n\nThe St Ninian's Isle Treasure was discovered under a cross-marked slab in the floor of the early St. Ninian's church, on 4 July 1958 by a local schoolboy, Douglas Coutts. Coutts was helping visiting archaeologists led by Professor A. C. O'Dell of Aberdeen University at a dig on the isle. The silver bowls, jewellery and other pieces are believed to date from approx. 800 AD.\n\n\n\n"}

It is located on the 7 Avenue transit mall between Macleod Trail and 3 Street S.E. It is the easternmost station downtown, and serves as a Gateway station. It was the first downtown station to have dual-side platforms (Downtown West–Kerby station, opened in 2012, was the second). It serves both the Red Line and the Blue Line and is the eastern extent of the free-fare zone.\n\nThis new dual-platform station replaces the previous City Hall and Olympic Plaza stations both of which opened May 25, 1981, as part of Calgary's first LRT line from 8 Street W to Anderson.\n\nThe original City Hall Station served only eastbound trains. The station was originally called 2 Street E. In late 1987, the station was renamed City Hall as 2 Street SE became Macleod Trail Northbound and the city did not want to call the Station Macleod Trail since it would not give a good indicator of the station's location because Macleod Trail is a long roadway traveling all the way to the very south end of the city. City Hall was chosen as the station is adjacent to the Calgary Municipal Building.\nThe original Olympic Plaza Station was initially called 1 Street E. It was renamed Olympic Plaza in late 1987 as its namesake is right across the street. The station was located between Macleod Trail and 1 Street SE.\n\nOn May 3, 2010, the original City Hall station was closed to be demolished and rebuilt on the spot, with a new westbound platform being constructed across the street, while the original Olympic Plaza station remained open. On June 6, 2011, both City Hall platforms opened and Olympic Plaza was permanently closed and demolished shortly thereafter. After the 2011 Stampede finished, the eastbound platform (South side of 7 Avenue; adjacent to Municipal Building) was re-closed to finish construction and officially re-opened on September 19, 2011. The Westbound platform (North side of 7 Avenue; adjacent to the Library) was completely finished as of June 6, 2011, and remained open.\n\nOlympic Plaza was the last of the vintage 1981 Stations on 7 Avenue to be demolished. Both of the new platforms are built to 4-car length and use the same design as all other downtown stations.\n\nNotable Locations near the station include the Calgary Municipal Building, Calgary City Hall, Arts Commons, Calgary Central Library, Bow Valley College and Olympic Plaza. Also, the United States Consulate Office is located at nearby Rocky Mountain Plaza across from Olympic Plaza (and also beside where the now-demolished station of the same name used to stand).\n\nThe station registered an average of 9,700 and 11,800 weekday boardings in 2005 (for City Hall and Olympic Plaza respectively).\n"}

It is governed by the Croatian Football Federation (CFF) and usually runs from late August to late May. Cup winners automatically qualify for next season's UEFA Europa League, except when cup winners are also First League champions, in which case cup finalists take their berth in the Europa League.\n\nThe cup was established in 1992, after Croatian clubs had abandoned the Yugoslav First League and Yugoslav Cup competitions following the breakup of Yugoslavia. As of the most recent 2018–19 season a total of 28 cup seasons were held. The competition has historically been dominated by the two Eternal Derby sides - the most successful club is Dinamo Zagreb (formerly known in the 1990s as \"HAŠK Građanski\" and \"Croatia Zagreb\") who appeared in 21 finals and won 15 titles, followed by Hajduk Split who won 6 titles out of 11 finals they appeared in.\n\nEither Dinamo or Hajduk appeared in all but two cup finals (in 1999 and 2006) and only three other clubs have won the cup - Rijeka (5 wins), Inter Zaprešić (1 win) and Osijek (1 win). Although clubs can qualify for the cup via regional county cups, which are usually contested by second-, third- or fourth-level sides, Istra 1961 (formerly known as Uljanik Pula) in 2003 was the only team in the history of the competition to have reached the cup final from outside the top level.\n\nAlthough in theory any club can take part in the cup, 48 teams enter the competition proper, based on three criteria:\n\nClubs which qualify via regional cups always enter in the preliminary round, which consists of 16 single-legged fixtures. In case of a draw at the end of normal time, thirty minutes of extra time is played, and if scores are still level, a penalty shootout is held to determine the winner of the tie.\n\nSixteen winners of the preliminary ties go on to the first round proper (round of 32), where they are joined by the sixteen best-ranked clubs according to cup coefficient (this usually means all First League clubs and a handful of best-ranked lower level teams). Round of 32 (R1) and round of 16 (R2) are also played as single-legged fixtures. Until the 2014–15 season, from the quarter-finals onward, the competition employed a two-legged tie format, with winners progressing through on aggregate score. Since 2015–16, quarter-finals are also played as single-legged fixtures and, since 2017–18, the same applies for semi-finals.\n\nIn case the score is still level at the end of regular time, extra time is played. If the score remains level after extra time, a penalty shootout takes place to determine tie winners. With the exception of 1997 and 1999 finals, all finals were also played as two-legged fixtures until the rules were most recently changed for the 2014–15 season and a single-match final was made permanent.\n\n"}
{"id": "1878584", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1878584", "title": "Broch of Clickimin", "text": "Broch of Clickimin\n\nThe Broch of Clickimin (also Clickimin Broch) is a large, well-preserved but restored broch in Lerwick in Shetland, Scotland (). Originally built on an island in Clickimin Loch, it was approached by a stone causeway. The broch is situated within a walled enclosure and, unusually for brochs, features a large \"forework\" or \"blockhouse\" between the opening in the enclosure and the broch itself. The site is maintained by Historic Scotland. According to its excavator, John R.C. Hamilton, there were several periods of occupation of the site: Late Bronze Age farmstead, Early Iron Age farmstead, Iron Age fort, broch period, and wheelhouse settlement.\n\nClickimin Broch is situated on the south shore of the Clickimin Loch, three-quarters of a mile south-west of Lerwick on the Lerwick-Sumburgh road. It sits on a small promontory jutting into the loch. It is one of the best preserved broch sites in Shetland.\n\nThe broch has an external diameter of around 20 metres and an internal diameter of around 9 metres. It is surrounded by a stone-walled fort consisting of a blockhouse and ringwork. The blockhouse is a free-standing drystone gateway set just within the entrance to the fort. Access to the broch is achieved via the entrance on the western side. The entrance passage may have had a \"guard cell\", now blocked up, on the right side, just inside the door jamb. The interior of the broch has two cells within the walls at ground-level. Excavations have revealed the postholes for internal timber buildings and in the 19th century there were said to have been radiating stone piers visible. There are two additional entrances to the broch at upper levels. The north entrance leads both into the interior and to a staircase. The other entrance leads to an intramural gallery.\n\nThe broch was originally excavated and cleared in 1861-2. Following major vandalism and dilapidation, parts of the site were rebuilt by the Office of Works in 1908-10. It was excavated again between 1953 and 1957 by J. R. C. Hamilton, who proposed a complex chronology for it. The earliest occupation of the site, according to Hamilton, was a small Late Bronze Age farmstead of the 7th or 6th centuries BC which (he said) was superseded by a larger circular Iron Age farmhouse built about the 5th century BC. In the 4th, or early 3rd century BC, Hamilton continued, a stone-walled fort consisting of the block-house and ringwork was constructed, which was in turn superseded by the broch in about the 1st century AD. In the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD a large wheelhouse was built within the reduced tower and with minor outhouses, storage pits and cattle stalls dug in the debris inside the older defences. \n\nIn recent years Hamilton's schema has been challenged by archaeologists and others: the ring wall, blockhouse and broch are now usually assumed to be contemporary. For a full account see B. Smith, 'How not to reconstruct the Iron Age in Shetland: modern interpretations of Clickimin broch', Northern Studies, 47, 2015.\n\nFinds include stone lamps, whetstones, bone and whalebone objects, a die, a few bronze objects, and two fragments of Roman glass.\n\n"}

It is located at an altitude of 700 metres, close to State Highway 73 between Darfield and Arthur's Pass. It is private property and located within the Kura Tawhiti Conservation Area.\n\nThe hill was so named because of the imposing array of limestone boulders in the area reminiscent of an old, run-down stone castle. The front of ChristChurch Cathedral in Christchurch was made from Castle Hill limestone. The station was established by the Porter brothers, and later owned by brothers John and Charles Enys. John Enys was a noted entomologist, and friend of novelist Samuel Butler.\n\nIt is widely considered to be the epitome of New Zealand's South Island climbing scene, where on any given day one can find rock climbers bouldering the unique limestone outcroppings. This area has recently seen more visitors, as nearby Flock Hill station was used for the filming of the climactic battle scenes of the 2005 movie, \"\". Flock Hill also has a huge number of climbable limestone boulders though access requires a short certification procedure via the internet, unlike Kura Tawhiti which, as a conservation area, allows free access at all times.\n\nThe nearby Castle Hill Village, located just north of Thomas River on State Highway 73, has a small number of permanent residents along with a number of holiday homes (used extensively during the winter ski season) but no public facilities other than a public toilet at the village hall and a children's playground. The village was started by the then-owner of Castle Hill Station, John Reid, in 1982.\n\n"}

The town was located in foothills southwest of Fort Collins, just west of the Dakota Hogback. It was established in the 1860s as a camp for workers at the nearby stone quarries in the area. The Union Pacific Railroad invested in quarrying operation in the valley around the town, and at one time Colorado and Southern Railway built a spur of their rail line from Fort Collins up to the town in order to transport stone for its own use. During its time of operation, Stout was also as a spot for the residents of the nearby town of Fort Collins to buy libations. Fort Collins had a 70 year old prohibition, preventing them from acquiring alcohol in their own. Due to transportation routes made for the stone quarry, it was easy for residents of Fort Collins to travel to Stout. These trips would end in excessive drunkenness, causing outrage from Fort Collins and Stout city officials, who worried about drunk drivers being a danger on the roads.\n\nThe town was abandoned in 1949 to make way for the inundation of the valley by Horsetooth Reservoir as part of the Colorado-Big Thompson Project. Some of the former town site is located under the southern end of the reservoir. In recent decades, a small community has developed around the south edge of the reservoir, locally known as \"South Bay\". A sign at the southern end of the reservoir somewhat whimsically proclaims the area as \"Stout, population 47-1/2\", although the designation is not official it is used by most residents of Fort Collins.\n"}

In fact, this project did not work out the way that they wanted it to be. Candee Jay's biggest hit singles are \"If I Were You\", \"Back For Me\" and \"Lose This Feeling\". Although the latter two never reached the chart heights of the former.\n\nCandee Jay has released one album, \"Electrifying\", in the UK, but it failed to make the chart there. Candee Jay made a moderate impression in the United States with \"If I Were You\" and \"Back For Me.\" Both singles sold well, and featured on the Hot Dance Singles Sales chart. However, \"Electrifying\" failed to appear on all Stateside music charts, including the Top Electronic Albums list.\n\nBefore her career as Candee Jay, Lankhaar was a professional model and successfully graduated from Lucia Marthas Dance Academy.

{"id": "1878607", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1878607", "title": "Don Garber", "text": "Don Garber\n\nDon Garber (born October 9, 1957) has served as the Commissioner of Major League Soccer since 1999. Garber is also the CEO of Soccer United Marketing and a member of the United States Soccer Federation board of directors.\n\nGarber has spent his entire career in the sports industry, working in a variety of capacities in marketing, events, television, and league administration prior to becoming MLS commissioner. Before joining MLS, Garber was with the National Football League for 16 years.\n\nUnder his leadership, MLS has experienced sustained growth in size and popularity in the United States and Canada. During his tenure, MLS has expanded from 10 to 24 teams and set records for attendance and broadcast revenue.\n\nIn addition, the league has seen significant increases in every metric – including team valuations, attendance, sponsorship, and digital and social media engagement. MLS ranks seventh among global soccer leagues in average game attendance.\n\nGarber has been selected by SportsBusiness Journal as one of the sports industry's most powerful executives every year since 2005. In 2018, he was 16th on the list. In 2016, SportsBusiness Journal presented MLS with its award for League of the Year. In May 2019, Garber was named the Sports Business Journal Executive of the Year. Garber has received numerous other industry honors, and in 2011 was named by the Los Angeles Times as one of the top sports commissioners. He has received an Honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters from both Montclair State University and the State University of New York. Garber was also inducted into the Athletic Hall of Fame at his alma mater, SUNY Oneonta. Garber was elected into the National Soccer Hall of Fame in 2016, but deferred his enshrinement until 2018.\n\nGarber spent 16 years with the National Football League, finishing his tenure as the senior vice president/managing director of NFL International, where he oversaw all aspects of the NFL's business outside the United States, including the NFL Europe League. Garber began his career at NFL Properties in 1984 as a marketing manager and became the League's director of marketing in 1988. In 1992, he was appointed the NFL's senior vice president of business development and was responsible for a variety of television, special event and marketing activities.\n\nGarber was appointed as Major League Soccer commissioner on August 4, 1999, succeeding Doug Logan. One of his first moves as commissioner was to bring the league more in line with the international standard, eliminating the shootout and having the referee keep the time on the field. In 2004, MLS also eliminated overtime and the three-plus-one substitution rule used since the league's inception. This enabled teams to substitute three field players as well as an additional goalkeeper. \"This decision reflects our focus on continuing our alignment with the world's game,\" said Garber at the time.\nGarber has emphasized gradual, sustained growth of the league over decades rather than attempting grandiose moves to win headlines. Before Garber came into the Commissioner's office, the league had only one team in its own stadium, Columbus Crew SC, whose Mapfre Stadium was built by Lamar Hunt in 1999.\n\nOn December 7, 2001, Garber met with club owners at the Colorado ranch of Philip Anschutz in order to establish a plan to ensure the league's survival. Among the concepts agreed upon was building soccer-specific stadiums; establishing what would be known as Soccer United Marketing – an agency designed to manage soccer content in the U.S.; and pursuing (and ultimately winning) broadcast rights to the 2002 and 2006 FIFA World Cups. The entire summit led by Garber at the Anshutz ranch is regarded as a critical moment in the eventual rise of MLS.\n\nFollowing Columbus Crew SC's lead, and after the summit at Anshutz's ranch, MLS clubs soon began building soccer-specific stadiums. The new venues enhanced the game-day experience for fans and granted teams full operating control of the stadiums and greater shares of stadium revenue.\n\nIn 2003, the \"cathedral of American Soccer,\" the Home Depot Center (now known as Dignity Health Sports Park), was built to house the Los Angeles Galaxy, and both senior national teams. Four more soccer-specific stadiums were built by the start of the 2007 MLS season. In 2020, MLS has 21 stadiums built or transformed for soccer. Within the next few years, a minimum of six more stadiums built for MLS clubs will debut.\n\nSoccer United Marketing (SUM), one of the game-changing ideas to come out of Garber's meeting with club owners at the Anshutz ranch, was established in 2002 and manages all sponsorship, licensing and advertising sales for MLS and other premier soccer properties in North America, including US Soccer and the Mexican National Team.\n\nSUM's first deal was the purchase of the English-language rights to the 2002 and 2006 World Cups for $40 million and to have the games broadcast on ESPN, splitting advertising revenue with the network. A decade later, FOX Network paid more than ten times that amount for the same rights.\n\nSUM continues to increase its partnerships. In 2016, the Confederation of North, Central America and Caribbean Association Football (CONCACAF) selected SUM to market and service its worldwide sponsorship rights. Today, SUM is valued at more than $2 billion.\n\nThrough a detailed and comprehensive expansion process, Major League Soccer grew under Garber's leadership from 10 teams in 2004 to 28 clubs in 2021. The league's plan is to expand to 30 clubs in 2022, with new teams in Sacramento and St. Louis. The cost of expansion clubs has risen steeply during this period. Toronto FC paid an expansion price of $10 million in 2006. The cost for teams to join MLS in its next wave of expansion is a reported $325 million. \n\nOn April 18, 2019, Garber confirmed the league announced it would expand to 30 teams. \n\nThere are some proposals to expand the league to 32 teams, with potential new teams in Detroit, Phoenix, Las Vegas, and San Diego. However, none of this has been confirmed by MLS.\n\nAs the league expanded and established a footprint across North America with successful clubs in Seattle, Portland, Toronto, New York, and Atlanta, among many others, team valuations have soared.\n\nWhen Forbes first released valuations of MLS clubs in 2008, the average team value was $48 million. In 2018, Forbes reported that the average value of a MLS club was $240 million – a 500 percent increase in 10 years.\n\nAt the conclusion of the 2006 season, MLS created the Designated Player Rule. The rule enables clubs to sign up to three players whose total costs exceed the maximum salary budget charge.\n\nGarber stated that fan research was one of the driving forces behind the decision to institute the Designated Player Rule. Garber and the league's owners also acknowledged that MLS needed additional \"marquee\" players to boost interest and the long-term strength of the league in a quicker fashion. The rule made it possible for clubs to sign an international icon like David Beckham with the LA Galaxy in 2006, or current stars like Jozy Altidore to larger contracts.\n\nThe strategy for signing Designated Players has evolved in recent years. Whereas clubs were more likely to use the rule to sign older, brand-name stars from Europe toward the perceived latter stages of their careers, teams began to utilize it to acquire younger, rising stars. For example, Seattle won MLS Cup in 2016 in part behind the strong play of 26-year-old midfielder Nicolas Lodeiro, who was signed as a Designated Player. \n\nWhen Atlanta United FC won MLS Cup in 2018, its Designated Players were 19-year-old Ezequiel Barco, 23-year-olds Miguel Almiron and Josef Martinez, and 22-year-old Hector Villalba. The average age of Designated Players in MLS in 2019 is 27.\n\nThe implementation of high-level player development initiatives has been a hallmark of Garber's stewardship of the league. In 2006, the league mandated the creation of youth development systems and declared that any player developed by a team could be signed by that team without the player having to go through the MLS SuperDraft. In 2010, MLS required each of its teams to establish youth amateur programs separate from the pro club. Players registered for at least 1 year in an MLS youth program became eligible to sign a pro contract with that team without entering the SuperDraft.\n\nWith a true foundation in place after a decade, homegrown players like FC Dallas’ Paxton Pomykal, LA Galaxy’s Efrain Alvarez, Sporting Kansas City’s Gianluca Busio and Seattle’s Jordan Morris have emerged. Smaller-market clubs like Sporting KC have been able to develop their own stars from local communities.\n\nAnd in 2019, the Under-17 club of Seattle Sounders FC proved how far it had come in a relatively brief time by winning the Champions Division of the Generation adidas Cup over the academy teams of top international clubs. \n\nMLS expanded into Canada midway through Garber's tenure. There are currently three Canadian teams playing in MLS. Toronto FC joined the league in 2007, Vancouver Whitecaps FC in 2011, and the Montreal Impact in 2012. All of them established successful MLS clubs.\n\nThe league has signed multiple, long-term broadcast agreements with Canada's sports networks. In January 2017, MLS extended its deal with TSN for five years and signed a new five-year contract with the French language network TVA Sports. This was in the wake of a banner year for Canadian teams in MLS in 2016, as Toronto FC defeated the Montreal Impact in the Eastern Conference Final. In 2018, DAZN Canada, a leading live-streaming sports service, and MLS announced a three-year agreement.\n\nIn 2017, the league enacted a major change in policy. A limited number of Canadians would now be counted as domestic players. Previously, Canadian players only counted as domestic in MLS if they played for one of the three Canadian-based franchises. The change was part of a collaboration with the Canadian Soccer Association (CSA) and executives from the three Canadian teams to improve youth development for Canada. Another aspect of the collaboration was a Canadian-specific Generation Adidas program to improve development of young players. The league and CSA work together to identify Canadian players who could be signed to contracts and made available in the MLS SuperDraft.\n\nAs MLS has grown in scope and popularity, the league's media rights deals have seen major increases. In 2014, the English-language rights to MLS and U.S. Soccer matches were sold to ESPN and FOX for $75 million per year for eight years. Univision won the Spanish-language rights for $15 million a year. The combined average rights fee of $90 million per year for eight years for ESPN, FOX and Univision represented a 500 percent increase from MLS’ previous broadcast deals, which averaged $18 million per year.\n\nMLS also signed new international TV agreements in 2015, including deals with Sky Sports, Eurosport and Globosat.\n\nIn 2017, MLS sold rights to league games to networks in India, Australia and New Zealand. In total, MLS matches can be seen in more than 170 countries.\n\nMLS has also been at the forefront of innovation in media among global sports leagues. In 2017, Facebook signed a deal with MLS and Univision to stream at least 22 matches during the regular season and exclusively stream 40 “Matchday Live” shows with highlights and analysis. The games are streamed on the Facebook page of Univision Deportes and the shows are available on MLS’ Facebook page. In 2019 there are six MLS clubs with exclusive streaming partnerships outside of deals with regional sports networks. \n\nFurthering the league's financial well-being is the landmark decision to be the first professional sports league in North America to allow sponsor's names on the front of jerseys. Real Salt Lake signed the first agreement with XanGo in 2006 for an estimated $4–5 million over 4 years. Teams now generate multimillion-dollar sponsorships for their jersey-front sponsorships. Most jersey-front sponsorships run between $2 million – $5 million per year. MLS has announced that starting in 2020, the league will remove its logo from the right sleeve of jerseys, allowing teams to sell a 2.5-by-2.5-inch square ad to corporate partners. The new sponsorship opportunity will bring each team more than $1 million a year.\n\nIn addition, major brands such as adidas, The Home Depot, Coca-Cola, Heineken, Audi, Johnson & Johnson, Continental Tire, Allstate, and Kellogg's have signed league-wide sponsorships and partnership renewals in recent years.\n\nDuring Garber's tenure, ownership has been dramatically diversified. In 2001, there were just three investor-operators in the league: Philip Anschutz's Anschutz Entertainment Group (AEG) controlled six teams, Lamar Hunt's Hunt Sports three teams, and Robert Kraft one team. When AEG sold its remaining interests in Houston Dynamo in 2015, the then 20-team MLS became for the first time a league without multiple-team operators.\n\nGarber champions “diversity of thought” among club owners in the current era of Major League Soccer. They range from Atlanta United FC owner Arthur Blank, the founder of Home Depot; NYCFC ownership groups City Football Group (which also owns Manchester City of the Premier League) and the New York Yankees; Brazilian businessman Flavio Augusto da Silva, who owns Orlando City SC; entrepreneurs Merritt Paulson (Portland Timbers), Andrew Hauptmann (Chicago Fire) and Anthony Precourt (Columbus Crew); and Seattle Sounders owners Adrian Hanauer and Drew Carey.\n\nAmong the owners of Los Angeles FC, which began play in 2018, are majority owners Larry Berg, Brandon Beck and Bennett Rosenthal, Magic Johnson, movie studio CEO Peter Gruber, U.S. Soccer icon Mia Hamm Garciaparra, and actor Will Ferrell. Inter Miami CF is owned by a diverse group of global entrepreneurs, including Jorge Mas, Marcelo Claure, Masayoshi Son and David Beckham.\n\nGarber detailed his view of the league's quality of ownership in a 2013 interview with Sports Illustrated: “It is about expanding our geographic footprint, trying to have more and more people on a national level engaging in soccer generally and Major League Soccer specifically. It’s about diversity of thought around our board table and having more committed investors.

The station has a center-loading platform that is accessed by stairs and an escalator inside the station building. A ramp is located at the South end of the platform to provide wheelchair access.\n\nThe Victoria Park/Stampede station is the only CTrain station with three platforms: the west track is used by trains going south, the central track by trains towards downtown and the Northwest, and the east track is mostly unused except for PR events, storage of LRVs or if one side of the main platform is not available. In the past, there was a special service train from the east platform to the Northeast after concerts and Flames games, and during the Stampede, but this service is very rare.\n\nAs part of Calgary Transit's plan to operate four-car trains by the end of 2014, all three-car platforms are being extended. Construction on a platform extension at Victoria Park/Stampede was completed in the Fall of 2013.\n\nIn 2019 the city of Calgary unveiled plans to demolish the original aging 1981 station in favor of building a more accessible at-grade station to better integrate with the area and with the BMO centre expansion along with the extension of 17th Avenue into Stampede Park.

The ridge is prominently visible as the first line of foothills along the edge of the Great Plains. It is generally faulted along its western side, and varies in height, with gaps in numerous locations where rivers exit the mountains. The ridge takes its name from the Dakota Formation, a sandstone formation that underlies the ridge. The hogback was formed during the Laramide orogeny, approximately 50 million years (50 my) ago, when the modern Rockies were created. The general uplift to the west created long faulting in the North American Plate, resulting in the creation of the hogback.\n\nWhile the hogback was created during the Laramide Orogeny, the geologic strata comprising the hogback are much older. For example, fossilized data such as dinosaur footprints have been observed in the exposed strata, created by dinosaurs which lived during the Jurassic Period approximately 150 my ago. Some of these footprints were attributed to the Diplodocus dinosaur and could be seen on the hogback west of Denver, Colorado as recently as the 1980s.\n\nThe ridge forms a barrier between the high plains and the Rocky Mountain foothills. The ridge is pierced by a few water-cut gaps, which have been used to provide road access between the mountains and the plains. The ridge is paralleled by I-25 from north of Cheyenne, Wyoming, through Colorado, into northern New Mexico. The ridge is to the west. North of Denver its major gaps are; I-80 in southern Wyoming, U.S. Highways 34 at Loveland, U.S. 36 to Rocky Mountain National Park. Interstate 70 passes through a highway cut, revealing the numerous layers making up the ridge. South of Denver, the major gaps are; U.S. Route 24 in Colorado Springs, U.S. Route 50 in Pueblo and finally in Colorado, U.S. Route 160 in Walsenburg.\n\nBefore the mountains, the region was a shallow sea. As sediments fell to the bottom of the water, they were compressed into soft sedimentary rock. Thus, oyster and clam shells, sand and mud built slowly into layers of sandstone, shale, limestone, and \"mudstone.\".\nAs the Rocky Mountains rose over the last 67 million years, up to nearly 30,000 feet above sea level. The soft sedimentary rocks were quickly weathered and washed away from the high mountains. But on the edge of the foothills, where the layers were scraped and pushed only slightly upward, the western edge of their remnant still stands at about a 45-degree angle - the Dakota Ridge.\nThe top layer is a hard sandstone. The Dakota Sandstone, from which the ridge gets its name. It protects the softer shales and limestones beneath it from weathering and erosion.\n"}

Wolters was inducted into the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame in 2017. \n\nWolters was born the youngest child of Liz and William Wolters and grew up in a basketball family. Her mother, Liz, once scored 50 points in one game at Wellesley High, more than any Massachusetts high school player before. Her father, William, known as \"Willie\", is in the Boston College Hall of Fame and played professional basketball for the Seattle SuperSonics in the NBA. He was born in West Germany and moved to America with his family at 11 years old. He later became an insurance lawyer in Boston. Kara has always worn uniform number 52, the same number as her father, as a tribute.\n\nWolters has stated she has always been tall and was already 6'3\" in eighth grade and she continued to grow rapidly during her career at Holliston High School. She still retains the schools scoring, rebounding and blocked shots record.\n\nHer brother Ray played basketball at Assumption College and later Eastern Connecticut State University. She has two older sisters: Kristen, who also played college basketball, at Rhode Island, and Katie.\n\nWhen Katie was six, a tumor was discovered in her brain. The growth was so large and tangled up in her brain stem that complete removal was not possible. Because of the subsequent surgery and treatment with radiation, she developed short-term memory loss and lost some of her sense of balance, and sometimes has seizures that prevent her from driving. Kara would later form the \"Kara Kares Foundation\" in 1998, which supports brain tumor research. Katie died in 2004 as a result of her brain tumor.\n\nWolters married Sean Drinan, a financial advisor with Stifel Nicolaus, in November 2004 and currently works as a studio analyst during University of Connecticut women's basketball games for SNY.

She helped the team to a 9–0 record, and the gold medal in the event. Wolters averaged 5.9 points per game.\n\nWolters represented the US at the 1997 World University Games held in Marsala, Sicily, Italy in August 1997. The USA team won all six games, earning the gold medal at the event. In the semi-final game against the previously unbeaten Czech Republic, Wolters scored 14 points, recorded ten rebounds and blocked five shots to hold the team win and advance to the gold medal game. Wolters averaged 11.3 points per game, second highest on the team and had 13 blocks, more than the rest of the team combined.\n\nWolters was named to the USA national team in 1998. The national team traveled to Berlin, Germany in July and August 1998 for the FIBA World Championships. The USA team won a close opening game against Japan 95–89, then won their next six games easily. In the semifinal game against Brazil, the USA team was behind as much as ten points in the first half, but the USA went on to win 93–79. The gold medal game was a rematch against Russia. In the first game, the USA team dominated almost from the beginning, but in the rematch, the team from Russia took the early lead and led much of the way. With under two minutes remaining, the USA was down by two points but the USA responded, then held on to win the gold medal 71–65. Wolters averaged 5.0 points per game and recorded seven blocks.\n\nWolters was drafted by the New England Blizzard of the ABL in 1997. She played for the team in the 97–98 and 98–99 seasons, the final two of the league's existence.\n\nWolters was selected by the Houston Comets in the third round (36th overall) during the 1999 WNBA Draft and subsequently in the 2000 Expansion Draft by Indiana Fever.\n\nWolters was traded to the Sacramento Monarchs for the 14th pick in the 2001 WNBA Draft on April 11, 2001.

Production of this vehicle was performed by the tank division of the General Motors Corporation. It used components from the M41 light tank and was constructed of all-welded steel.\n\nA total of 3,700 M42s were built. The vehicle has a crew of six and weighs 22,500 kg (49,500 lb) fully loaded. Maximum speed is with a range of 100 miles (160 km). Armament consists of fully automatic twin 40 mm M2A1 Bofors, with a rate of fire of 2×120 rounds per minute (rpm) and either a .30 caliber Browning M1919A4 or 7.62mm M60 machine gun. The 500 hp, six-cylinder, Continental (or Lycoming Engines), air-cooled, gasoline engine is located in the rear of the vehicle. It was driven by a cross-drive, two-speed Allison transmission.\n\nAlthough the M42 Duster was initially designed for an anti-aircraft role, it proved to be highly effective against unarmored ground forces in the Vietnam war.\n\nDuring the course of the Korean War, the U.S. Army decided to phase out all vehicles based on the M24 Chaffee chassis, such as the M19 Multiple Gun Motor Carriage 40 mm Anti-Aircraft, in favor of designs that utilized the chassis of the M41. Since the 40 mm guns were still seen as an effective anti-aircraft weapon, a modified version of the gun mount used in the M19 was mounted in a redesigned turret to accommodate the larger turret ring of the M41 and designated as the M42.\n\nInitially, the 40 mm guns were aimed with the assistance of a radar fire control system housed in a secondary vehicle of similar design but this idea was scrapped as development costs mounted.\n\nProduction of the M42 began in early 1952 at GM's Cleveland Tank Plant. It entered service in late 1953 and replaced a variety of different anti-aircraft systems in armored divisions. In 1956, the M42 received a new engine and other upgrades along with other M41 based vehicles, becoming the M42A1. Production was halted in December 1960 with 3,700 examples made during its production run.\n\nSometime in the late 50s, the U.S. Army reached the conclusion that anti-aircraft guns were no longer viable in the jet age and began fielding a self-propelled version of the HAWK SAM instead. Accordingly, the M42 was retired from front line service and passed to the National Guard with the last M42s leaving the regular Army by 1963, except for the 4th Battalion, 517th Air Defense Artillery Regiment in the Panama Canal Zone, which operated two batteries of M42s into the 1970s.\n\nThe HAWK missile system performed poorly in low altitude defense. To ensure some low altitude anti-aircraft capability for the ever-increasing amount of forces fielded in Vietnam, the Army began recalling M42A1s back into active service and organizing them into air defense artillery (ADA) battalions. Starting in the fall of 1966, the U.S. Army deployed three battalions of Dusters to the Republic of Vietnam, each battalion consisting of a headquarters battery and four Duster batteries, and each augmented by one attached Quad-50 battery and an artillery searchlight battery.\n\nDespite a few early air kills, the air threat posed by North Vietnam never materialized and ADA crews found themselves increasingly involved in ground support missions. Most often the M42 was on point security, convoy escort, or perimeter defense. The \"Duster\" (as it was called by U.S. troops in Vietnam) was soon found to excel in ground support. The 40 mm guns proved to be effective against massed infantry attacks. According to an article appeared in \"Vietnam Magazine\":\n\nMost of the Duster crew members had their AIT training in the 1st Advanced Individual Training Brigade (Air Defense) at Fort Bliss, Texas. Some of the Duster NCOs had received training at the Non Commissioned Offices Candidate School which was also held at Fort Bliss, Texas.\n\nThe 1st Battalion, 44th Artillery was the first ADA battalion to arrive in Vietnam on November 1966. A self-propelled M42A1 Duster unit, the 1-44th supported the Marines at places like Con Thien and Khe Sanh Combat Base as well as Army divisions in South Vietnam's rugged I Corps region. The battalion was assigned to First Field Force Vietnam (IFFV) and was located at Đông Hà. In 1968 it was attached to the 108th Artillery Group (Field Artillery). Attached to the 1-44th was G Battery 65th Air Defense Artillery equipped with Quad-50s and G Battery 29th Artillery Searchlights. The 1-44th served alongside the 3rd Marine Division along the Vietnamese Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) in I Corps thru December 1971.\n\nSergeant Mitchell W. Stout was a member of C Battery, 1-44th Artillery. He was awarded the Medal of Honor. Also killed in this action was SP-4 Terry Lee Moser, of Barto, Pennsylvania, also assigned to C Battery, 1-44th Artillery.\n\nThe second Duster battalion to arrive in Vietnam was the 5th Battalion, 2nd Air Defense Artillery. Activated in June 1966 it arrived in Vietnam in November 1966 and was diverted to III Corps, Second Field Force (IIFFV) and set up around Bien Hoa Air Base. Attached units were D Battery71st Air Defense Artillery equipped with Quad-50s and I Battery, 29th Artillery Searchlights. The \"Second First\" served the southern Saigon region through mid 1971. D-71st Quads remained active through March 1972.\n\nThe third Duster battalion to arrive was the 4th Battalion, 60th Air Defense Artillery. Activated in June 1966 it arrived in Vietnam in June 1967 and set up operations in the Central Highlands, based out of An Khê (1967–70) and later Tuy Hoa (1970-71). Attached units were E Battery 41st Artillery equipped with Quad-50s and B Battery, 29th Artillery Searchlights (which were already in country since October 1965). Members of these units not only covered the entire Central Highlands, but also supported firebases and operations along the DMZ to the north and Saigon to the south.\n\nEach Duster Battalion had four line batteries (A, B, C, D) and a headquarters battery. Each battery had two platoons (1st, 2nd), which contained four sections each with a pair of M42A1 Dusters. At full deployment there were roughly 200 M42 Dusters under command throughout the entire war. The Duster and Quads largely operated in pairs at firebases, strong points, and in support of engineers building roads and transportation groups protecting convoys. At night they protected the firebases from attack and were often the first targets of enemy sappers, rockets, and mortars. Searchlight jeeps operated singularly but often in support of a Duster or Quad section at a firebase.\n\nBetween the three Duster battalions and the attached Quad-50 and Searchlight batteries over 200 fatalities were recorded.\n\nThe three M42A1 equipped ADA battalions (1-44th, 4-60th and 5-2d) deactivated and left Vietnam in late December 1971. Most if not all of the in-country Dusters were turned over to ARVN forces. Most of the training Dusters at Fort Bliss were returned to various National Guard units. The U.S. Army maintained multiple National Guard M42 battalions as a corps-level ADA asset. 2nd Battalion, 263 ADA, headquartered in Anderson, SC was the last unit to operate the M42 when the system was retired in 1988.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He is perhaps best known for his appearances with Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) during the late 1990s and early 2000s, where he was a three-time ECW Tag Team Champion, as well as working for World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) on its ECW brand. Mahoney last worked for American independent promotions.\n\nRechner was born in Spring Lake Heights, New Jersey. He started wrestling at the age of 15.\n\nRechner trained at the Monster Factory and debuted in 1987, at age 15, as Abbudah Singh. He began wrestling in the independent circuit in New Jersey. He jobbed in the World Wrestling Federation from 1992 to 1993.\n\nHe made a small name for himself as Boo Bradley Jr. (a take-off of the character Boo Radley from \"To Kill a Mockingbird\") in Smoky Mountain Wrestling (SMW). He was originally allied with Chris Candido and managed by Tammy Sytch, who abused him for months, but they eventually turned on him, killing his pet cat, and turning him into a fan favorite in the process. He formed a friendship with Cactus Jack during this time. He went on to have a lengthy rivalry with Candido and Sytch. After his battles with Candido he moved on to a feud with Killer Kyle of the Gangstas. During his time in SMW Bradley won the SMW Beat the Champ Television Championship twice.\n\nIn 1995, he briefly appeared in the World Wrestling Federation as Xanta Klaus. From 1992–93 he jobbed under his real name losing to Papa Shango, Marty Jannetty, and Virgil. At in December, while Savio Vega and \"Santa Claus\" were at ringside handing out presents and playing to the fans, villainous manager \"Million Dollar Man\" Ted DiBiase appeared. DiBiase proclaimed that everyone had a price, even Santa. As Vega argued with DiBiase, \"Santa\" jumped him from behind and attacked him. DiBiase laughed his trademark laugh and introduced this warped Santa as Xanta Klaus, from the South Pole who steals presents. As Xanta, Rechner made only a couple more appearances (one on the following night's \"Monday Night Raw\"), before never being mentioned again.\n\nAfter WWF, Rechner wrestled as Boo Bradley for Mid Eastern Wrestling Federation where he became the MEWF Mid-Atlantic Champion. \n\nIn 1996, Rechner signed with Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) and found success as Balls Mahoney. Capitalizing on the ECW crowd's lust for violence and the hardcore attitude Rechner was never seen without his signature steel chair, usually with some kind of writing or sign placed on it, which he would use to bash any opponent at any time. He would come to the ring to the AC/DC song \"Big Balls\" and lead the crowd in singing the chorus before or after his matches. While in ECW he teamed with Axl Rotten, a similar hardcore and violent wrestler, and the duo became informally known as \"The Hardcore Chair Swingin' Freaks\". They feuded with The Dudley Boyz (Buh Buh Ray and D-Von) during their tenure.\n\nMahoney made his pay-per-view debut at November to Remember, participating in a Four-Way Dance match for the Tag Team Championship, along with his partner Rotten; The F.B.I. (Tracy Smothers and Little Guido) retained the titles. At Living Dangerously, they participated in a three-way dance, along with the Dudleyz in a losing effort to Spike Dudley and New Jack. Mahoney and Rotten got another chance at the titles at Wrestlepalooza against Chris Candido and Lance Storm, but lost.\n\nAfter failing to win the titles with Rotten, Mahoney found a new partner in Masato Tanaka. At November to Remember, the two defeated Dudley Boyz to win the World Tag Team Championship, thus beginning Mahoney's first reign as tag champion. Six days later, Mahoney and Tanaka dropped the title to the Dudleyz in a rematch. At Guilty as Charged, Mahoney and Rotten defeated the F.B.I. and Danny Doring and Roadkill in a three-way dance.\n\nMahoney's first singles match at a pay-per-view was a victory over Steve Corino at Living Dangerously. Shortly after, Mahoney formed a tag team with Spike Dudley. At Hardcore Heaven, the two faced the Dudleyz in a championship match but failed to win the title. The two teams faced in a rematch at Heat Wave, and this time, Mahoney and Dudley won the match and the World Tag Team Championship, marking Mahoney's second individual reign. At a show in August, the duo re-lost the title to the Dudleyz.\n\nOn the edition of August 14 of \"ECW on TNN\", Mahoney and Dudley defeated the Dudleyz in another rematch to win back the World Tag Team Championship. On the edition of August 26 of \"ECW on TNN\", they lost the titles to the Dudleyz again. At Anarchy Rulz, ECW World Television Champion Rob Van Dam was scheduled to defend his title against Johnny Smith but before the match, Mahoney, Rotten, and Dudley attacked Smith and took him out of the match. Mahoney then challenged RVD for the title but lost the match.\n\nAt November to Remember, Mahoney and Rotten lost to Da Baldies (Spanish Angel, Tony DeVito, Vito LoGrasso, and P.N. News) in a 4-on-2 handicap match.\n\nDuring an exchange of blows, ECW fans would often chant \"Balls!\" when Rechner landed a punch or kick on an opponent, and \"Nuts!\" when his opponent retaliated. At Living Dangerously, he defeated Kintaro Kanemura. He met his former tag team partner, Masato Tanaka in the first match at Hardcore Heaven, which Tanaka won.\n\nAt Heat Wave, he lost a match to F.B.I. member Sal E. Graziano. He formed a tag team with Chilly Willy and the duo feuded with Da Baldies. After losing a match to Da Baldies at Anarchy Rulz, Mahoney and Willy defeated them in a Flaming Tables match at November to Remember. At Massacre on 34th Street, Mahoney lost to EZ Money.\n\nMahoney's final ECW appearance was at ECW's final pay-per-view Guilty as Charged where Mahoney and Chilly Willy's match with Simon Diamond and Johnny Swinger ended in a no contest.\n\nAfter ECW folded, Rechner spent time in a number of independent federations across America, most notably USA Pro Wrestling (UXW) as well as Juggalo Championship Wrestling where he united with The Dead Pool (Violent J, Shaggy 2 Dope, and Raven) to become The Dead Pool 2000. He made an appearance in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) in 2004, teaming with The Sandman to face off against The Gathering. On January 9, 2004 he wrestled for Ring Of Honor losing to Samoa Joe.\n\nIn 2005, Mahoney made a non-wrestling appearance at the World Wrestling Entertainment-promoted ECW One Night Stand reunion show, taking part—alongside Axl Rotten—in a brawl with Kid Kash, Tommy Dreamer, The Sandman, the Dudley Boyz, and The Blue World Order (bWo) before the main event. After the main event, Mahoney and Rotten returned to the ring to brawl with the \"invading\" Raw and SmackDown! wrestlers.\n\nIn 2006, when WWE relaunched ECW as their own brand, one of the first announcements was the signing of Balls Mahoney. His signing was announced with that of Axl Rotten, but when Rotten missed some WWE dates and was released, Balls was left to start a singles career. During the \"cross promotion\" hype, Balls appeared on the June 5 edition of \"Raw\" with other ECW wrestlers who proceeded to attack WWE Champion John Cena. He appeared again as a part of the ECW team in the \"WWE vs. ECW team battle royal\" at the \"WWE vs. ECW Head to Head\" event on June 7. At One Night Stand, Balls defeated Masato Tanaka in a match following a chair shot (denting the chair) to Tanaka's head.\nWhen \"ECW on Sci Fi\" debuted, Balls started off with a small role in the company, having sporadic matches and little else. Once the show got going he started to appear in vignettes talking about how tough he was, elevating his role on the show. On the edition of September 5 of \"ECW on Sci Fi\" Mahoney entered a feud with Kevin Thorn after Thorn and his valet Ariel cost him a match against Stevie Richards and the next week, René Duprée.\n\nThe following week, he brought Francine to ringside with him, marking her first televised appearance at the revived ECW ring, where she proceeded to get into a catfight with Ariel. That pairing, however, was short lived as Francine was released shortly after.\n\nAt December to Dismember, Mahoney defeated Matt Striker in a Striker's Rules match.\n\nOn the edition of January 2, 2007 of \"ECW on Sci Fi\", Mahoney had one of his front teeth legitimately knocked out during a match with Kevin Thorn. Shortly after, Balls began a short feud with Snitsky. On the edition of June 5 of \"ECW\", Balls, Tommy Dreamer, and the Sandman faced Bobby Lashley in a 3 on 1 Hardcore Handicap match for the ECW Championship, in which they were defeated.\n\nOn the August 7, 2007 episode of \"ECW\", Balls went against The Miz in a losing effort. During and after the match, it appeared that Kelly Kelly was concerned about him. Over the weeks that followed, he attempted to ask her out and flirted with her backstage, but was interrupted by The Miz, Brooke, and Layla before Kelly could get a word in. Regardless, Kelly still showed interest in him each week, wishing him good luck before his match and cheering him on during his match. He asked if she would go out with him to which she could not respond due to The Miz taking her backstage. Weeks later, however, Kelly asked him out, starting an on-screen relationship.\n\nOn February 29, 2008, Balls made his return to television on \"SmackDown!\", taking on Big Daddy V. The match went to a no contest after The Undertaker chokeslammed Mahoney. Mahoney was released from his WWE contract on April 28, 2008.\n\nOn December 13, 2008 he returned to wrestling in World Wrestling Council his re-debut match against Abdullah the Butcher in Bayamon Puerto Rico in the annual event WWC Lockout, Abdullah the Butcher's final match in WWC. On April 16, he and Brother Runt appeared on \"TNA Impact!\" to wish Team 3D luck in their match at Lockdown. They later were attacked by Beer Money, Inc. Mahoney made an appearance for Insane Clown Posse's Juggalo Championship Wrestling at the 10th Annual Gathering Of The Juggalos on August 8, 2009, interfering in a \"Loser Leaves JCW\" match between 2 Tuff Tony and Viscera, which also featured WWE Hall of Famer Terry Funk as a special guest referee. After Viscera won the match, he, Mahoney, and Funk all attacked Tony. Also, as of late 2009, Mahoney has become a regular competitor for National Wrestling Superstars. On May 8, 2010, Mahoney made his debut for Ring of Honor, saving Grizzly Redwood from Erick Stevens and The Embassy. On July 29, 2010, it was confirmed that Mahoney would take part in TNA's ECW reunion show Hardcore Justice on August 8. However, his name was later pulled from the event's official website. At the event Rechner, using the ring name Kahoneys, teamed with Axl Rotten in a South Philadelphia Street Fight, where they were defeated by Team 3D. After the match Rechner vented his frustrations on Axl Rotten, proclaiming that he would never again team with him.\n\nOn September 11, 2010, Rechner returned to Ring of Honor at Glory By Honor IX, where he, competing under the ring name Ballz Mahoney, teamed with Grizzly Redwood in a losing effort against Erick Stevens and Necro Butcher. On October 23, 2010, Mahoney and Axl Rotten reunited at a Jersey All Pro Wrestling, where they unsuccessfully challenged Monsta Mack and Havok for the JAPW Tag Team Championship, in a three–way match, which was won by Sami Callihan and Chris Dickinson. On October 18, 2014, Mahoney was defeated by Sabu to crown the first WWL Extreme Champion at Insurrection. Mahoney's last match before his death took place at the DFC A Very Deathproof Christmas event on December 6, 2015, defeating Shaunymo in a Flaming Tables Match in Toronto, Ontario.\n\nRechner's son, Christopher, was born on November 15, 2007.\n\nRechner had numerous tattoos, including two tribal pieces, a dragon and inverted pentagram on his arm, and a tattoo dedicated to deceased wrestler and the namesake of his son Chris Candido. Rechner and Candido were childhood friends who got their start in the wrestling business setting up rings for local shows during their teenage years and eventually trained together at the Monster Factory.\n\nOn August 21, 2010, Rechner was charged with disorderly conduct after brandishing a knife during a staged fight with fellow wrestler \"Calypso\" Jim Zaccone in South Brunswick, New Jersey. The fight was meant to drum up publicity for an upcoming match in Perth Amboy, New Jersey.\n\nMahoney was a member of the Church of Satan.\n\nOn April 12, 2016, his 44th birthday, Rechner died suddenly at his home in Spring Lake Heights, New Jersey. He was watching \"Jeopardy!\" as he laid on his side to get more comfortable. Moments later, his wife noticed he was unconscious and called 911 before attempting CPR. However, he had already died before medics arrived. His death was first reported via Twitter by Johnny Candido. His autopsy was released in August 2016, where it ruled that he had died of a heart attack. On October 21, 2016, it was revealed Rechner had suffered from CTE. As a result of the CTE diagnosis, the Rechner family became part of a class-action lawsuit against the WWE over these reports and was represented by attorney Konstantine Kyros. U.S. district judge Vanessa Lynne Bryant dismissed the lawsuit in September 2018.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1878656", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1878656", "title": "Buddha's Birthday", "text": "Buddha's Birthday\n\nBuddha's birthday is a Buddhist festival that is celebrated in most of East Asia commemorating the birth of the Prince Siddhartha Gautama, later the Gautama Buddha, and was founder of the Buddhism. According to Buddhist tradition and modern academic consensus, Gautama Buddha was born c. 563–480 BCE in Lumbini (currently located in Nepal), and raised in the Shakya capital of Kapilavastu.\n\nThe exact date of Buddha's birthday is based on the Asian lunisolar calendars. The date for the celebration of Buddha's birthday varies from year to year in the Western Gregorian calendar, but usually falls in April or May. In leap years it may be celebrated in June.\n\nIn South and Southeast Asia, the Buddha's birth is celebrated as part of \"Vesak\", a festival that also celebrates the Buddha's enlightenment and death. In East Asia, the awakening and death of the Buddha are observed as separate holidays.\n\nThe exact date of Buddha's Birthday is based on the Asian lunisolar calendars and is primarily celebrated in Baisakh month of the Buddhist calendar and the Bikram Sambat Hindu calendar. This is the reason behind the term Vesak. In modern-day India and Nepal, where the Historical Buddha lived, it is celebrated on the full moon day of the Vaisakha month of the Buddhist calendar. In Theravada countries following the Buddhist calendar, it falls on the full moon, Uposatha day, typically in the 5th or 6th lunar month. In China and Korea, it is celebrated on the eighth day of the fourth month in the Chinese lunar calendar. The date varies from year to year in the Western Gregorian calendar, but usually falls in April or May. In leap years it may be celebrated in June. In Tibet, it falls on the 7th day of the fourth month of the Tibetan calendar (2019 June 9, in other years in May).\n\nIn South Asian and Southeast Asian countries as well as Mongolia, Buddha's birthday is celebrated on the full moon day of the Vaisakha month of the Buddhist calendar and the Hindu calendar, which usually falls in April or May of the Western Gregorian calendar. The festival is known as Buddha Purnima, as Purnima means full moon day in Sanskrit. It is also called Buddha Jayanti, with Jayanti meaning birthday in Sanskrit.\nThe corresponding Western Gregorian calendar dates varies from year to year:\n\nIn many East Asian countries Buddha's Birth is celebrated on the 8th day of the 4th month in the Chinese lunar calendar (in Japan since 1873 on April 8 of the Gregorian calendar), and the day is an official holiday in Hong Kong, Macau and South Korea. The date falls from the end of April to the end of May according to the Gregorian calendar.\n\nThe primarily solar Gregorian calendar date varies from year to year:\n\nIn 1999 the Taiwanese government set Buddha's birthday as the second Sunday of May, the same date as Mother's Day.\n\nAs a result of the Meiji Restoration, Japan adopted the Gregorian calendar in lieu of the Chinese lunar calendar in 1873. However, it took approximately until 1945, the end of World War II, for religious festivities to adopt the new calendar. In most Japanese temples, Buddha's birth is now celebrated on the Gregorian and buddhist calendar date April 8; only a few (mainly in Okinawa) celebrate it on the orthodox Chinese calendar date of the eighth day of the fourth lunar month.\n\nIn Bangladesh, the event is called বুদ্ধ পূর্ণিমা or Buddho Purnima. On the days preceding Purnima, Buddhist monks and priests decorate Buddhist temples with colourful decorations and candles. On the day of the festival, the President and Prime Minister deliver speeches addressing the history and importance of Buddhism, and of religious harmony in the country. From noon onwards large fairs are held in and around the temples and viharas, selling bengali food (largely vegetarian), clothes, and toys. Performances of Buddha's life are also presented. Buddhist monks teach celebrants about the Dharma and the Five Precepts (panchashila). Buddhists then attend a congression inside the monastery where the chief monk delivers a speech discussing the Buddha and the Three Jewels (tri-ratna), and about living the ideal life. Afterwards, a prayer to the Buddha is offered, and people then light candles and recite the Three Jewels and Five Precepts.\n\nIn Cambodia, Buddha's Birthday is celebrated as \"Visak Bochea\" and is a public holiday where monks around the country carry the Buddhist flag, lotus flowers, incense, and candles to acknowledge Vesak. People also take part in alms-giving to the monks.\n\nIn China, celebrations may occur in Buddhist temples where people may light incense and bring food offerings for the monks. In Hong Kong, Buddha's birthday is a public holiday. Lanterns are lit to symbolise the Buddha's enlightenment and many people visit the temple to pay their respects. The bathing of statues of the Buddha is a major feature of Buddha's birthday celebrations in the city. The festival is also a public holiday in Macau.\n\nThe public holiday for Buddha purnima in India was initiated by B. R. Ambedkar when he was the minister of law and justice. It is celebrated especially in Sikkim, Ladakh, Arunachal Pradesh, Bodh Gaya, various parts of North Bengal such as Kalimpong, Darjeeling, and Kurseong, and Maharashtra (where 77% of total Indian Buddhists live), as well as other parts of India as per Indian calendar. Buddhists go to common Viharas to observe a rather longer-than-usual, full-length Buddhist sutra, akin to a service. The dress code is pure white. Non-vegetarian food is normally avoided. Kheer, sweet rice porridge is commonly served to recall the story of Sujata, a maiden who, in Gautama Buddha's life, offered the Buddha a bowl of milk porridge. Informally called \"Buddha's Birthday,\" it actually commemorates the birth, enlightenment (nirvāna), and death (Parinirvāna) of Gautama Buddha in the Theravada tradition. Tibetans in exile remember Buddha's birthday on the 7th day of the Saga Dawa month (fourth month of the Tibetan calendar), which culminates with Buddha's \"parinirvana\" celebrations on the full moon day.\n\nIn Indonesia, Buddha's Birthday is celebrated as \"Waisak\" and is a public holiday. A large procession beginning in Mendut in Java, and ends at Borobudur – the largest Buddhist temple in the world.\n\nIn Japan, Buddha's Birthday is known as \"Kanbutsu-e\" () or \"Hanamatsuri\" (Flower Festival) () and is held on April 8. Buddha's birth is also celebrated according to the Buddhist calendar but is not a national holiday. On this day, all temples hold 降誕会 (\"Gōtan-e\"), 仏生会 (\"Busshō-e\"), 浴仏会 (\"Yokubutsu-e\"), 龍華会 (\"Ryūge-e\") and 花会式 (\"Hana-eshiki\"). Japanese people pour \"ama-cha\" (a beverage prepared from hydrangea serrata, a variety of hydrangea) on small Buddha statues decorated with flowers, as if bathing a newborn baby. The tradition of bathing the Buddha originated in China and was introduced to Japan where it was first held in Nara in 606. Lion dancing is also a major tradition practiced during Buddha's Birthday and has become associated with the festival in Japan.\n\nIn Malaysia, Buddha's Birthday is celebrated as \"Wesak Day\" and is a public holiday celebrated by the sizeable minority Buddhist population in the country. Temples across the country are decorated, and caged animals are set free. People engage in prayers, chanting, and alms-giving across the country.\n\nIn Mongolia, Buddha's Birthday is celebrated as \"Ikh Duichen\" and its date is determined by the Mongolian lunar calendar. As a result, the date falls in line with celebrations of Buddha's Birthday/Vesak in South and Southeast Asian countries as opposed to neighbouring East Asian countries. While not a public holiday the festival is popularly celebrated by many Mongolian Buddhists.\n\nIn Myanmar, Buddha's Birthday is celebrated as \"Full Moon of Kason\" and is a public holiday. It is celebrated by watering the Bodhi tree and chanting. In large pagodas, music and dance is also performed as part of the celebrations.\n\nIn Nepal, the birthplace of Buddha, his birthday is celebrated on the full moon day of May. The festival is known by various names, Buddha Jayanti, Buddha Purnima, Vaishakh Purnima, Saga Dawa, and Vesak. Purnima means full moon day in Sanskrit. Among the Newars of Nepal, especially from the Shakya clan of Newars, it is of great importance because they consider it as a continuation of the sage of the Śākyas- the clan that Lord Buddha's family belonged to. Thus, they celebrate the festival which is in their language known as Swānyā Punhi (स्वांया पुन्हि), the full moon day of flowers. The day marks not just the birth of Shakyamuni Gautama Buddha, but also the day of his Enlightenment and Mahaparinirvana.\n\nThe event is celebrated by gentle and serene fervour, keeping in mind the very nature of Buddhism. People, especially women, go to common Viharas to observe a rather longer-than-usual, full-length Buddhist sutra, something like a service. The usual dress is pure white. Non-vegetarian food is normally avoided. Kheer, sweet rice porridge is commonly served to recall the story of Sujata, a maiden who offered the Buddha a bowl of milk porridge.\n\nBuddha Purnima is the biggest day for Buddhists because on this day, it is believed three important events of the Buddha's life took place: his birth, his attaining enlightenment, and his death, Paranirvana. This day is known as Thrice Blessed Festival.\n\nBuddha's Birthday is occasionally designated as a public holiday in North Korea and is known as \"Chopail\" (). Designation of traditional Korean holidays as public holidays in North Korea are determined by the Cabinet a few days before the traditional holiday begins. Buddha's Birthday is a traditional festival in Korean culture, and was celebrated in Korea long before the division of the country. As a result, the festival is still celebrated in North Korea by the country's Buddhist population.\n\nIn Singapore, Buddha's birthday is celebrated as \"Vesak\" or \"Vesak Day\" and is a public holiday in the country. Buddhist temples hold celebrations and are decorated with Buddhist flags and flowers. Devotees also bring offerings to the temples.\n\nIn South Korea, the birthday of Buddha is celebrated according to the Korean lunar calendar and is a public holiday. This day is called (Seokga tansinil), meaning \"Buddha's birthday\" or (Bucheonim osin nal) meaning \"the day when the Buddha came.\" Lotus lanterns hang in temples throughout the month and lanterns are hung in homes and in the streets. On the day of Buddha's birth, many temples provide free meals and tea to all visitors. Breakfast and lunch are also provided, which often includes sanchae bibimbap. Buddha's Birthday is a popular holiday and folk celebration in Korea, and is often celebrated by people of all religious faiths.\n\nIn Sri Lanka, Buddha's Birthday is celebrated as \"Vesak\" and is a public holiday celebrated on the first full moon day of the month of May. Its date is determined by the Buddhist lunar calendar. People engage in religious observances and decorate houses and streets with candles and paper lanterns as well as bamboo-framed lanterns. \"Dansalas\" is practised and refers to the free offering of food and drink to people. Devotional songs known as \"Bakthi Gee\" are sung, and decorative gateways called\"pandols\" are erected throughout the country. Temples around the country also hold celebrations, and devotees bring offerings and burn incense. Electric light displays that depict stories from the Buddha's life are also a notable part of Vesak celebrations in the country.\n\nIn Taiwan, Buddha's birthday is a national holiday. Devotees pour fragrant water over Buddha statues to symbolise the beginning of a fresh start in life.\n\nIn Thailand, Buddha's birthday is celebrated as \"Visakha Puja\" and is a public holiday. People gather at temples to hear sermons, give donations and chant prayers.\n\nBuddha's birthday is celebrated throughout Vietnam. Many Buddhist temples hold celebrations that attract people from around the country, while pagodas around the country are decorated. From 1958 to 1975, \"Lễ Phật Đản\", the birthday of Buddha (on the 8th day of the 4th month in the Lunar calendar) was recognized as a national public holiday in South Vietnam, enjoyed with floats and lantern parades on the streets.\n\nIn Sydney, Buddha's birthday is celebrated at the Nan Tien Temple in Wollongong, while another celebration also organised by Nan Tien Temple is held at Darling Harbour, which features Buddha's birthday ceremony. A variety of vegetarian food is served, and culture stalls and multicultural performances are held, celebrating cultures from China, Japan, Vietnam, Korea, India, Malaysia, Sri Lanka, Australia. Other temples in the Fo Guang Shan Nan Tien Temple group in Australia also hld celebrations on the eighth day of the fourth month of the China lunar calendar. In Brisbane, the \"Buddha's Birthday Festival\" is held annually and features a variety of pan-Asian food, and performances from various cultures are held. It is a weekend-long festival which draws over 200 000 visitors. In Melbourne, the weekend-long festival called \"Buddha's Day and Multicultural Festival\" is held at Federation Square around April/May. In Perth, a two-day celebration also known as \"Buddha's Day and Multicultural Festival\" is held at Langley Park. Local Buddhist temples and smaller towns around the country such as Bendigo, Victoria also hold celebrations.\n\nOn the Australian external territory of Christmas Island, Buddha's Birthday is celebrated as \"Vesak Day\" and is celebrated alongside many other celebrations common in Australia and Malaysia as well as local celebrations of the island.\n\nVesak (Hanamatsuri) is widely known and celebrated in Brazil due to the country's large Japanese community. Hanamatsuri has grown in popularity and also attracts interest from the wider non-Japanese Brazilian population. As a result, Hanamatsuri has become a consumerist culture phenomenon in the country and is sometimes locally known as \"Festa das Flores\". Hanamatsuri is celebrated in the São Paulo neighbourhood of Liberdade which is home to the largest Japanese community outside of Japan. Hanamatsuri celebrations in Liberdade began in 1966 and includes a parade on Galvão Bueno street. Celebrations are also held at the suburb's major shopping centre, Liberdade Plaza.\n\nIn Toronto, three Buddhist temples representing the three main branches of Buddhism organize an annual event known as \"Vesak: Buddha's Birthday\". It is held at Mississauga Celebration Square, and features a number of Buddhist-themed events and activities, as well as cultural acts from Asia, including China, Sri Lanka and Vietnam.\n\nThe celebration of Buddha's Birthday in the United States differs from community to community, depending on ethnicity and nationality.\n\nThe Japanese celebration on 8 April has been significant in the Bay Area of California for some decades. In 1968 the first circumambulation of Mt. Tamalpais to celebrate Buddha's Birthday was conducted. Starting in 1969 at Tassajara Zen Mountain Center, \"Hana-Matsuri\" was celebrated each spring. Dressed in formal black robes, the roughly 70 monks and students form a formal procession to the Horse Pasture with the leader periodically ringing a small, clear bell. A temporary stone altar was built under a huge oak tree in a gorgeous field of green grass and abundant wildflowers; a small statue of a baby Buddha was placed upon it in a metal basin. Then each person, in turn, approaches the altar, and ladle one thin-lipped bamboo dipperful of sweet green tea over the statue, bow, and walk to one side.\n\nIn New York, the \"International Lotus Lantern Parade\" has been a notable and successful annual event held at Union Square Park. The event celebrates the Buddha's birthday and \"Yeon Deung Hoe\" (연등회), a Korean lantern celebration that is held during Vesak. The festival features a number of Buddhist themed events and is started off by numerous Buddhist centres of Japanese, Korean and Sri Lankan origins for example.\n\nSince 1963, the state of Hawaii has recognized April 8 of each year as \"Buddha Day\", which celebrates the birth of Siddhartha Gautama, the founder of Buddhism.\n\n\n"}

It serves the South Line (Route 201) and May 25, 1981, as part of the original line. The station is located on the exclusive LRT right of way (adjacent to CPR ROW), 10.6 km south of the City Hall Interlocking. The station is located just north of Anderson Road near Macleod Trail.\n\nThe station was, until October 8, 2001, the southern terminus of the South Line, having served in this capacity since the LRT's original opening in 1981. The station is located primarily near residential areas such as Southwood and Willow Park, and it also provides access to the Southcentre Mall, by means of a pedestrian bridge and skywalk that cross Macleod Trail. 1323 paved parking spaces are located on-site, as well as a 427 space overflow lot.\n\nThe station consists of a center-loading platform with Mezzanine access at the South end and grade-level access at the North end.\n\nAs part of Calgary Transit's plan to operate 4-car trains by the end of 2014, all 3-car platforms are being extended. Construction on the platform extension at Anderson Station started in June 24, 2013 and was completed in the late fall of 2013.\n\nIn January 2018, the south entrance to the Mezzanine level was closed as crews removed the entrance in preparation for renovations. On April 2, 2018, the Mezzanine level was closed to perform renovations. The grade-level entrance remains open, as well as the station itself while renovations are underway. Renovations were expected to be completed by October 2018 but due to soil and structural issues arising during construction, the completion date has been extended to Spring of 2019.\n\nThe Anderson Shops and Garage, where the CTrain vehicles are maintained, is located here. CTrains operating on the NE line had to come up from the Anderson Garage every morning from the opening of the NE line in 1985 until the Oliver Bowen Maintenance Facility opened with McKnight–Westwinds Station in 2008.\n\nIn 2005, the station registered and average transit of 11,300 boardings per weekday.\n\nIn 1996, Siemens brought a RegioSprinter DMU (diesel multiple unit) railcar as part of a demonstration tour of North America. A new passenger platform was added on the CP Rail line adjacent to Anderson station. The RegioSprinter was operated between this platform and a platform at 162 Avenue SW located near present-day Somerset–Bridlewood station. This service was only in operation during peak hours and was discontinued after a few months when RegioSprinter continued its tour but this service proved to be very popular and it convinced the city board to plan the extension of the SE line to Somerset–Bridlewood Station in two phases.\n"}

It is part of the Marine Corps Base Camp Smedley D. Butler complex.\n\nCamp Foster a United States Marine Corps camp located in Ginowan City. Some of its portions overlap with Okinawa City, Chatan town and Kitanakagusuku village in the Japanese prefecture of Okinawa Island. It houses the headquarters of Marine Corps Base Butler, Marine Corps Installations Pacific and the Okinawa Area Field Office of United States Forces Japan. It was named after the Medal of Honor recipient PFC William A. Foster.\n\nAmong its amenities are a large exchange with an adjacent food court. There is a smaller exchange “PX” next to the large exchange, which has a nail salon, barber shop, soft bank, AU, and a toy land. Near the commissary is a bowling alley, skate park, performing arts center and movie theater. The base operates three schools: Zukeran and Killin elementary schools and Kubasaki High School. The base's housing units include Kishaba, Chatan, Futenma, Plaza and Sada.\n\nIn October 2013 Japanese officials entered the base with US permission to look for buried cultural properties. They discovered dozens of abandoned metal drums, but did not report this to the Ginowan city's mayor until March 2014. Members of the Japanese defense ministry's local bureau and Ginowan city visually inspected the site, as part of its cultural property research and \"no unusual odor or color change in soil\" was detected. Also apparently no health problems have been actively \"reported by residents living around the base\". Ginowan city government had called the Japanese defense ministry's to investigate for \"possible environmental impacts\". The Japanese Defense Minister Itsunori Onodera said: \"We will take appropriate measures in cooperation with the United States and the city of Ginowan\" as they plan environmental studies on soil in the week of 18 March 2014. The United States rarely allow environmental inspections on U.S. bases not planned for return to Japan.\n\nThe Futenma housing area of the base originally was to be returned to Japan between 2001 and 2003, 5–7 years from 1996. \nIn 2006, the Nishi-Futenma housing area at Camp Foster was vacated and slated for return to Japan, but Japanese concerns of contamination stalled the transfer. For example, bungalows in the military housing area built in the 1950s were insulated with asbestos. Per the U.S.-Japan Status of Forces Agreement from 1960 the U.S military is not responsible for the remediation of land polluted by its bases in Japan. Because the central government has not challenged the dated agreement, the Okinawa Prefectural Assembly created its own special committee regarding U.S. bases, to collect information directly about past use and storage of chemicals. In October 2013 it created a department of pollution, which would circumvent the central government and its environmental investigations, which some believe are not interested in communicating the true levels of pollution.\n\nOn 31 March 2015 the West Futenma housing area on Camp Foster was returned to Okinawa Prefecture implementing agreements to reduce and consolidate land used by the U.S. military. A 20-hectare part of the area is earmarked for a medical division with plans to build a prefecture administered advanced heavy particle cancer therapy facility. The University of the Ryukyus Faculty of Medicine, including the University Hospital, is also scheduled to move from its current location in Nishihara into a new facility to be constructed on the land.\n\n\n\n"}

Page (1901–2000) was an American real estate developer, shipper, entrepreneur, and philanthropist; he is best known as the namesake of the Page Museum at the La Brea Tar Pits in Los Angeles, California.\n\nPage was born in Fremont, Nebraska. He lost his father at age five; Page and his brothers were raised by their mother as farmboys. When Page left for California at the age of 16, a goal he set four years earlier after tasting his first orange, the teenager had only $2.30 in his pocket. (Page later recalled, \"I was so awed by the beauty of that piece of fruit that I said, 'I hope someday I can live where that came from.'\")\n\nPage worked as a busboy (which he initially believed meant steering a bus) and a soda jerk until he had earned $1000. With this capital, in 1917, he bought a vacant store and founded a distribution company, Mission Pak, which shipped California fruits such as oranges as holiday gifts to cold-weather customers.\n\nThe idea came to Page as he boxed oranges home to his mother and brother one year earlier: 37 residents at his boardinghouse had asked if he would do them the same courtesy; the company proved enormously successful. (The Mission Pak jingle is still familiar to many older Angelenos: \"Say the Magic words, say Mission Pak and it's on its merry way! No gift so bright, so gay, so right, give the Mission Pak magic way!\") \n\nMr. Page was interviewed for Studs Terkel's book, \"The Good War\", about his experiences as an entrepreneur and real estate developer during World War II. At the time of Page's death, the president of the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County observed, \"The story of George C. Page embodies the American dream. His like will not come our way again.\"\n\nCapitalizing on his shipping company's success, Page founded a sports-car manufacturing plant. After selling Mission Pak in 1946, Page moved into real estate development; he built industrial and commercial parks, and leased space to the defense and aerospace industries and the federal government. Having begun as a packager, Page thought this brought an edge to real estate; Page was always attentive to the value good landscaping could add to a project.\n\nPage financed the construction of buildings at Children's Hospital Los Angeles (the George C. Page Building), at Loyola Marymount University (George C. Page Stadium), and in the district of Hawthorne, Los Angeles (the George C. Page Youth Center), along with arts programs at the University of Southern California and buildings and scholarships at Pepperdine University in Malibu. The Pepperdine University Law School dormitories are named in his honor.\n\nPage had begun visiting the La Brea Tar Pits while in his late teens; it troubled him that to move from pits to the disinterred fossilized remains required a seven-mile (11.3 km) trip to the Natural History museum. A half-century later, the museum that bears his name was opened to the public in April 1977. Page had devoted great care into each element of the museum—attractive fossil presentation, so it would not simply be \"bones, bones, bones\"; testing the most comfortable underfoot surface—carpet, not marble—and limiting the museum to exhibits that could be easily covered in about an hour. Among the site's visitors, five million in its first decade, were professional curators interested to see what Page, as an amateur, had put together. \"The thing that made me feel awfully good,\" Page told the \"Los Angeles Times \"in 1982, \" was that they said, 'George Page, we have never been in a museum with things displayed so well.'\"\n\nPage described The George C. Page Museum as a kind of living bouquet he had presented to the city: \"This is so living, so immediate. It's like giving flowers that I can smell while I'm still here.\"\n\n"}

The band consists of Tom Thacker, Theo Goutzinakis, Gabe Mantle and Steven Fairweather. Juno nominated for best new group in 2000, and another Juno nomination for best video in 2002. Gob's most successful album is \"World According to Gob\". Their best-selling songs to date are \"I Hear You Calling\", \"Soda\", and \"Banshee Song\". They have been featured in movies, TV shows, and many sporting video games such as \"NHL 2002\", \"NHL 2003, NHL 2004\" and \"Madden NFL 2004\" with songs such as \"Oh! Ellin\", \"I've Been Up These Steps\", \"Sick With You\" (both re-mixed for the game), \"I Hear You Calling\" and \"Give Up The Grudge\". The band has appeared at several music festivals, the most well-known being the Vans Warped Tour. Thacker is also a lead guitarist for fellow Canadian rock band Sum 41.\n\nGob formed in 1993 consisting of Tom Thacker as lead guitarist and vocalist, Theo Goutzinakis as rhythm/co-lead guitarist and vocalist, Patrick \"Wolfman Pat\" Paszana on drums, and Kelly Macauley on bass guitar. Thacker and Goutzinakis often switched between lead vocals with Goutzinakis playing the occasional lead guitar line. During the early days of the band, Tom usually kept his place as lead guitar while Theo had more vocal duties and focused on rhythm guitar. They recorded their self-titled \"Gob\" in 1993 and released it in 1994 on Landspeed Records with the odd numbered tracks sung by Theo and the even numbered tracks sung by Tom. The tracks 1, 2 and 8 were re-recorded and released on their next album \"Too Late... No Friends\". Kelly Macauley was replaced by Jamie Fawkes and in 1995 Gob released \"Too Late... No Friends\" on Mint Records and Landspeed Records. It was later reissued by Nettwerk in 2000. After the release of \"Too Late... No Friends\", Gob had replaced many bassists until they found Craig Wood. \"Wolfman\" Pat left the band due to his daughter being born before the recording of \"How Far Shallow Takes You\", so the band replaced him with Gabe Mantle, former member of a Vancouver Punk band Brand New Unit. With a newly formed band, Gob released \"How Far Shallow Takes You\". It was home to a heavier sound with a better production value, mature lyrics focusing on personal and political issues and a growth in musicianship. It was released on Fearless records in 1998 but re-released in 1999 on Landspeed because of conflicts with Fearless. In 1999, Gob signed with Nettwerk records, who re-released the \"How Far Shallow Takes You\" album in May of the same year.\n\nGob released \"World According to Gob\", in 2001. This album was Gob's most successful album to date; featuring one of their biggest hits \"I Hear You Calling.\" Musically, the sound was a continuation of their previous 1990s-era punk rock sound. Other singles released from \"World According To\" include \"For The Moment\", \"That's The Way\" and \"No Regrets\". The album was certified Gold by the CRIA in May 2002.\n\nIn 2002, Gob recorded the compilation \"F.U. EP\" as a promotional record for their new label Arista Records. \"Ming Tran\" was released as a single for the EP which also featured a re-recorded version of a classic Gob song \"Soda\", two exclusive tracks, \"L.A Song\" and \"Sick With You,\" as well as tracks from the band’s previous three studio releases. The band followed up the \"F.U. EP\" with their fourth studio album \"Foot in Mouth Disease\", which was released on Arista Records in April 2003. Singles from \"Foot in Mouth Disease\" include \"Give Up the Grudge\", \"Oh! Ellin\", \"Ming Tran\" and \"This Evil World\". Unlike the band's other albums, Theo only provides lead vocals on the album's twelfth (eleventh on Canadian version) track \"Bully\". The album has been described as having a much heavier and aggressive tone than the band's previous work.\n\nIn 2003, Gob filmed a cameo for the Canadian teen comedy \"Going The Distance\" (2004) where they appeared as themselves performing at the MuchMusic Video Awards. Swollen Members and Avril Lavigne also appeared in the film.\n\nIn 2004, longtime bassist Wood left the band to play guitar for Canadian superstar Avril Lavigne. The band have since recruited a bassist known only to fans as \"Peter Pan\" or, more commonly, Tyson, as Gob's members are on a \"first-name basis\" with their fans. (All albums credit the musicians simply by their first names, as well.)\n\nGob's friendship with several Canadian bands has come up often in the past few years. During Gob's downtime, Thacker has played lead guitar for Sum 41 live since 2007 because of the departure of their lead guitarist, Dave Baksh. Since then, Thacker has become Baksh's permanent replacement in Sum 41.\n\nTheir fifth full-length album, \"Muertos Vivos\", was released on Cobraside November 27, 2007, in the U.S. and was released in Canada on Aquarius Records October 23. They recruited Tyson Maiko as their bassist. The album is Gob's heaviest and most serious album to date.\n\nThe album's first single was \"We're All Dying\". They shot the video for \"We're All Dying\", as well as for their second single \"Underground\", on September 4 and 5, 2007, in downtown Vancouver. The album's final single was \"Banshee Song\".\n\nIn mid-2008, Maiko left the band and was replaced by Steven Fairweather who was a long time friend of the band. Even having them record most of \"Muertos Vivos\" in his childhood home. Fairweather had played in past bands including Revelation Records' post-hardcore band By a Thread, and appeared on demo versions of songs by sub pops' punk rock band the Black Halos.\n\nIn early 2009, the band toured Canada, after which, in April, Thacker joined up with Sum 41 for their Japanese and US tour. It was also confirmed that Thacker was officially a member of Sum 41.\n\nIn an interview with \"AMP\", guitarist Theo Goutzinakis revealed that the band had already started writing for their sixth studio album.\n\nGob released the album \"Apt. 13\" in August 2014. The band also announced a Canadian tour, with Canadian punk band Seaway.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The tower was built in 1600 by Patrick Stewart, 2nd Earl of Orkney, during his brief period as effective ruler of Shetland.\n\nIn 1564, Robert Stewart (1533–1593), illegitimate son of King James V, was granted lands in Orkney and Shetland and subsequently established himself as a powerful but unscrupulous figure in the islands. Despite numerous complaints against him for seizing lands and misusing taxes, Stewart was later made Earl of Orkney and Lord of Shetland by King James VI. He remained unpopular with the local lairds, and they subsequently turned the king against Stewart, who died impoverished in 1593, having had his Earldom revoked in 1587. Robert Stewart's son Patrick (c. 1566 – 6 February 1615), who had been on unfriendly terms with his father, remained in the king's favour and was himself created Lord of Shetland in 1590. He effectively succeeded as Earl of Orkney on his father's death, though this was not formalised until 1600. In Shetland he continued to appropriate lands and feuded with the lairds: Laurence Bruce of Cultmalindie, son of Robert Stewart's ally, became his chief opponent.\nFollowing his charter of the Earldom in 1600, Stewart began the construction of Scalloway Castle which was completed around 1607. His main residence was the Earl's Palace, built by his father on Birsay, Orkney, while Scalloway was used by his representative in Shetland. The new castle also served as a meeting place for the thing (parliament) of Shetland during Earl Patrick's ascendancy. Construction of the castle was undertaken by unpaid workers, summoned by Patrick from the parishes of Shetland, and was overseen by his master of works, Andrew Crawford. Crawford was probably also responsible for Patrick's Earl's Palace in Kirkwall, and Muness Castle on Unst, built for Bruce of Cultmalindie.\n\nIn 1609 the Shetland lairds complained to the king of Earl Patrick's misrule of the islands. Patrick was subsequently imprisoned at Edinburgh Castle, and was executed in 1615 for encouraging his son Robert to retake his Orkney possessions. Meanwhile, control of the islands was given over to James Law, Bishop of Orkney, who held his first court at Scalloway Castle in August 1612. In 1653 troops were stationed in the castle, and by the early 18th century its condition was described as poor. Some of the ornamental stonework was removed to be incorporated into the Haa of Sand, an 18th-century house to the north-west of Scalloway. The ruins were placed into state care in 1908, and are now maintained by Historic Scotland. Excavations in 1979–1980 uncovered the remains of 17th-century outbuildings to the north of the tower.\n\nScalloway Castle is built on an L-plan, with a main tower of , and a wing to the south-west of square. The roofless castle is of four storeys, with an additional garret over the main tower. The ground level is tunnel-vaulted, containing kitchens, stores and a well. A straight staircase leads up to the hall on the first floor, with spiral stairs leading to upper storeys. Around the third floor are bartizans (corner towers) projected on decorative corbelling.\n\nThere is an inscription above the door, illegible today but recorded in the 18th century as \"\"Patrick Stewart, Earl of Orkney and Shetland. James V King of Scots. That house whose foundation is on a rock shall stand but if on sand shall fall...\"\" The castle is a scheduled monument.\n\n\n"}

It was painted at a spot on the bank of the Rhône that was only a one or two-minute walk from the Yellow House on the Place Lamartine which Van Gogh was renting at the time. The night sky and the effects of light at night provided the subject for some of his more famous paintings, including \"Cafe Terrace at Night\" (painted earlier the same month) and the later canvas from Saint-Rémy \"The Starry Night\".\n\nA sketch of the painting is included in a letter van Gogh sent to his friend Eugène Boch on October 2, 1888.\n\n\"Starry Night\", which is now in the Musée d'Orsay in Paris, was first exhibited in 1889 at Paris' annual exhibition of the Société des Artistes Indépendants. It was shown together with van Gogh's \"Irises\", which was added by Vincent's brother, Theo, although Vincent had proposed including one of his paintings from the public gardens in Arles.\n\nThe view is from the quay (a waterside street) on the east side of the Rhône, into the knee of the river towards the western shore: coming down from the north, the Rhône turns to the right at this point to surround the rocks on which Arles is built. From the towers of Saint-Julien and Saint-Trophime at the left, the spectator follows the east bank up to the iron bridge connecting Arles to the suburb of Trinquetaille on the right, western bank. This implies a view from Place Lamartine towards the southwest.\n\nVan Gogh announced and described this composition in a letter to his brother Theo:\nIn reality, the view depicted in the painting faces \"away\" from Ursa Major, which is to the north. The foreground indicates heavy rework, wet-in-wet, as soon as the first state was finished. The letter sketches executed at this time probably are based on the original composition.\n\nThe challenge of painting at night intrigued van Gogh. The vantage point he chose for \"Starry Night\" allowed him to capture the reflections of the gas lighting in Arles across the glimmering blue water of the Rhône. In the foreground, two lovers stroll by the banks of the river.\n\nDepicting color was of great importance to Vincent; in letters to his brother, Theo, he often described objects in his paintings in terms of color. His night paintings, including \"Starry Night\", emphasize the importance he placed on capturing the sparkling colors of the night sky and of the artificial lighting that was new to the era.\n\n"}

However, in late 2003 (approximately 7 months before opening) the City decided to use the current name for it.\n\nThe site of Somerset-Bridlewood was originally opened as 162nd Ave Station in spring of 1996 as a temporary platform on the CP-Rail line to provide access to a conventional rail service during peak rush hour periods to a platform at Anderson station. The service only lasted five months but the ridership proved popular and led to the priority decision to complete the South extension.

It was released in 1964 as a single backed with \"Why Do Fools Fall in Love\", both later appearing on the band's album \"Shut Down Volume 2\".\n\n“Fun, Fun, Fun” is one of the Beach Boys many songs that defined the California myth. Its lyrics are about a teenage girl who deceives her father so she can go hot-rodding with his Ford Thunderbird. At the end, her father discovers her deception and takes the keys from her. Near the end of the song, the song's narrator suggests that the girl accompany him, so that they may have 'Fun, Fun, Fun' engaging in other activities.\n\nThe song was written by Brian Wilson and Mike Love. The lyrics are partly inspired by events from Dennis Wilson’s life. Russ Titelman recalled that he visited Brian while he was working on the song, and that its original lyric was \"Run, Run, Run\". Then-manager Murry Wilson was dissatisfied with the song, and had engineer Chuck Britz cancel one of its recording sessions. However, Brian rescheduled the session after discovering what happened.\n\nAccording to Salt Lake City radio manager Bill \"Daddy-O\" Hesterman of KNAK, an early promoter of the Beach Boys who brought them to Utah for appearances and concerts, the song was inspired by an incident involving Shirley Johnson, the station owner's daughter. Johnson had borrowed her father's 1963 Thunderbird, which had a University of Utah parking sticker, ostensibly to go study at the University library. Instead, she went to a drive-in theater. When the deception came to light, her driving privileges were revoked. In 2007, Johnson told KSL News that she was complaining loudly about the incident at the radio station, where she worked as a part-time secretary, when the Beach Boys happened to be there for an interview. Hesterman said that Wilson and Love, amused by the incident, jotted down the beginnings of the song as he took them to the airport that afternoon. \n\nThe opening electric guitar introduction of the song was based on Chuck Berry's \"Johnny B. Goode\". The track's punctuated drum fills were inspired by the work of Phil Spector. Phil Lambert noted that the initial two phrases of the song are based on almost the same chord progression as the first two phrases of \"Da Doo Ron Ron\", and are melodically similar.\n\nThe song was recorded on January 1, 1964, at United Western Recorders Studio 3. Vocals and additional overdubs followed on either January 8 or 9.\n\nThe stereo and mono mixes stem from the same recording but have a significant difference: the fadeout on the stereo mix fades out early into the song's outro, with the instruments fading away before the vocals (and an overdubbed drum part). The mono mix, as heard on the 45 as well as mono copies of \"Shut Down Volume 2\" has an extended outro.\n\nTrack details courtesy of session archivist Craig Slowinski.\n\nThe Beach Boys\n\nAdditional musicians\n\nThe \"Fun, Fun, Fun\" single backed with \"Why Do Fools Fall In Love?\" was released in the United States in February 1964. The single peaked at the number 5 spot on the \"Billboard\" chart.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the single was released in March 1964 through Capitol Records, but failed to chart. In Australia, the single peaked at the number 6 position, which was the band's highest charting single in Australia at that time. In West Germany, the single became their first single to chart in the country when it peaked at the number 49 position. According to various national charts published in \"Billboard\" through the 1960s, the single peaked at number 4 in The Philippines (February 1965) with thirteen weeks in its top 10, and spent four weeks at number 3 in Hong Kong (December 1965) with ten weeks in its top 10.\n\nThe instrumental track was released on the 2001 archival release \"Hawthorne, CA\". A new stereo mix, more closely resembling the original single version, was released in 2013 on the \"Made in California\" box set. Alternate live versions appear on \"Beach Boys Concert\" (1964), \"The Beach Boys in Concert\" (1973), and \"\" (2002).\n\nThe song was covered in 1996 by the then-current lineups of the Beach Boys and Status Quo (see \"Don't Stop\"), with a new verse written for the song. The Beach Boys sang mainly backing vocals, with Status Quo's Francis Rossi performing the lead vocal for the entire song, except the new verse, which was sung by Mike Love. It was released under PolyGram Records as a single in the United Kingdom. The single, featuring another artist on the B-side, peaked at number 24 on the UK Singles Chart.\n\n"}

In 2019, construction was completed on 'T' Space's architectural archive and research library, which will come to house Holl's work as a watercolorist, as well as models, drawings and other architectural materials developed in Holl's 40-plus years as principal of Steven Holl Architects.\n\nHoll won first prize in the Amerika-Gedenkbibliothek International Library Design Competition in 1988, an expansion and renovation of the American Memorial Library in Berlin. In February, 1989 Holl's work was exhibited in a solo show at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York City. MoMA later purchased twenty-five works by Holl for the museum's permanent collection. In the 1992 competition for a new contemporary arts museum in Helsinki, Finland, Holl's entry, entitled \"Chiasma,\" won first prize out of more than five hundred international entries. The museum opened to the public in 1998, having permanently adopted the name \"Kiasma,\" the Finnish translitteration of \"chiasma.\"\n\nIn designing the Chapel of St. Ignatius (built 1994-1997), Jesuit chapel at Seattle University, Holl addressed the campus's need for green space by siting the chapel in the center of a former street and elongating the building plan. New green campus quadrangles were formed to the north, west, and south, and a future quadrangle is planned to the east. The plan of the chapel won a design award in the American Institute of Architects of New York. Holl designed the Chapel around St. Ignatius's vision of the inner spiritual life, \"seven bottles of light in a stone box\", by creating seven volumes of different light. Each volume represents a different part of Jesuit Catholic worship, and has differently colored glass so that various parts of the building are marked out by colored light. Light sources are tinted both in this way and by indirect reflection from painted surfaces, and each is paired with its complementary color.\n\n\nAlong with Pallasmaa and Alberto Perez-Gomez, Holl wrote essays for a 1994 special issue of the Japanese architectural journal \"A+U\" under the title \"Questions of Perception: Phenomenology of Architecture.\" The publication was reissued as a book in 2006.\n\n\n"}

Although rather small in size, the fountain is the best-known landmark of the city. Today, it is an essential part of graduation celebrations, for every student who finishes a doctorate at the University of Göttingen has to climb the fountain and kiss the statue of the goose girl.\n\nA Gänseliesel is also situated in Monheim am Rhein, Hanover's Steintor Square and Berlin's Nikolsburger Square.\n\nSince the 18th century, a fountain was located on the site of the Gänseliesel. However, the old fountain was partially pulled down in the early 19th century due to deterioration. In 1898, the city council decided to construct a new fountain, for which sculptors from all over Germany presented their proposals. From all designs, the neo-gothical proposal \"Im Geiste der Alten/Tugendbrunnen\" (\"In the Spirit of the Ancients/Fountain of Virtue\") by the sculptors Mehs and Jehs was favoured while the goose girl design by the architect Heinrich Stöckhardt was only ranked second place. However, after the official ranking the three best designs were put on exhibition. The citizens of Göttingen widely preferred the simpler design of the goose girl, probably because the simple girl image best represents the common people - in contrast to the numerous statues of famous university scientists found in the city. After long discussion, the Gänseliesel, then designed by the architect Heinrich Stöckhardt and created by the sculptor Paul Nisse, was finally put up in 1901 without any official ceremony. The Gänseliesel fountain does not have any particular connection to the history of the town. The Original of the sculpture is today in the Town Museum (\"Städtisches Museum\")\n\nSoon after the fountain was erected, newly enrolled students of the Georgia Augusta university began to climb up the fountain and to kiss the statue which rapidly became a university tradition. Because the climbing of the fountain was usually celebrated with excessive consumption of alcohol and loud cheers of fellow students and because the number of students largely increased after World War I, police issued a decree in 1926 that officially forbade the climbing and kissing of the statue. A law student who was prosecuted for kissing the goose girl in the same year, took the case to court. However, the superior court of justice in Berlin legitimated the edict.\n\nThe tradition itself has changed over time, and today it is unusual for first year students to kiss the statue; it is now more common to bring a bouquet of flowers to the Gänseliesel and to give her a kiss after one's official reception of the doctorate degree. It is for this reason that the fountain is decorated with flowers very frequently, and throughout the year. Until recently, climbing and kissing of the monument remained officially forbidden although both the city of Göttingen and the university advertise themselves with pictures of PhD graduates kissing the girl.\n\nAs the fountain has been subject to vandalism, the original statue of the goose girl can today be seen in the Stadtmuseum while the fountain only carries a copy. After a severe assault during the winter of 2004 (malicious arson), the fountain needed to be disassembled and underwent major restoration.\n\nSince 1995, each year on a weekend in September the city of Göttingen stages the so-called \"Gänselieselfest\" in honor of the goose girl. Main event of these festivities is the election of a young woman from Göttingen as the Gänseliesel, representing the town and the statue for one year.\n\n"}

Designed as a mobile short-range system to fill the performance gap between the FIM-92 Stinger man portable missile, and the larger MIM-23 Hawk missile system, which were both in service at the time. Development work began in 1966, with the first test firings conducted in 1978. The system was designated as the Type 81 by the JSDF, and contracts were placed for the system in 1980. The system entered service in 1981. In 1987, minor changed system SAM-1B was designated.\n\nDevelopment work on an upgrade designated \"Tan-SAM Kai\" started in 1989. Upgraded system was designated as SAM-1C in 1995, initial production on upgrade kits for the system starting in 1996. Two fire units were scheduled to be upgraded in 2000, with work on the program continuing into 2006.\n\nDevelopment work on an upgrade designated \"Tan-SAM Kai II\" started in 2005.\n\nIn 2014, the new type of short-range surface-to-air missile designated as Type 11 was officially unveiled, which as \"Tan-SAM Kai II\" research & development results, would replace the Type 81.\n\nThe Tan-SAM 1 missile is cruciform in cross section with four clipped delta wings attached to the mid body, and four small steerable clipped delta fins at the rear of the missile. The missile is propelled by a solid rocket motor, with giving it a burn-out velocity of about Mach 2.4. It is initially inertially guided to a likely intercept point, with an all-aspect infra-red seeker taking over to handle terminal guidance. The missile has a 9.2-kilogram fragmentation warhead triggered either by contact or a radar proximity fuze with a lethal radius of between 5 and 15 meters depending on the target type.\n\nA fire unit consists of one Fire Control System vehicle and two launcher vehicles as well as a number of support vehicles with a total crew of fifteen men. The Fire Control Systems vehicle consists of an Isuzu Motors 6×6 truck with a 30 kW generator unit mounted behind the driver's cabin, and a rectangular three-dimensional pulse-doppler phased array radar. The radar can operate in three modes: omni-directional search, sector search/course tracking mode, and fine tracking mode. The radar is scanned both mechanically and electronically and can track up to six targets within the same 110-degree arc in course tracking mode. Two targets can be tracked in fine tracking mode at greater accuracy, with the single-shot kill probability for each target relayed to the operator via a CRT display. The radar has a range of about 30 kilometers, and has built in IFF capabilities.\n\nInformation on the two selected targets is then passed to the two attached launcher units, which are also mounted on Isuzu Motors 6×6 trucks, which slew and elevate their launchers toward the target. The launchers can be deployed up to 300 meters away from the Fire Control System vehicle. An intercept course is computed for the missile, and the missile is launched. The missile follows the initial inertial course until it reaches a pre-programmed point where it activates its infrared seeker. The infrared seeker only scans a programmed area of the sky to prevent it from locking onto the sun. From that point it switches to passive infrared homing for the terminal phase of the flight.\n\nThe infrared seeker does not use IR filters to reject decoys, although there is a degree of protection provided by the use of intermediate frequency seeker scanning pattern.\n\nEach launcher is equipped with an optical director than can be used instead of the radar in a high ECM environment or if the radar is not operational; additionally the vehicle can be mounted with one or two 12.7 mm calibre heavy machine guns, for self-defense in frontal forward areas against ground threats and close-in(<500 m) incoming air threats. The system can be set up in approximately 30 minutes, and the launcher reload time for all four missiles is around three minutes.\n\nSAM-1C upgraded missile use a phased array active radar seeker, with the capability of receiving mid-course guidance updates from the Fire Control Systems vehicle. The upgrade also increases the missiles maximum range to 14 kilometers while increasing the missile weight to 105 kilograms. A new smokeless motor with improved thrust is also fitted, replacing the existing motor. Also the Fire Control Systems vehicle is fitted with a thermal imager to improve operation in an ECM heavy environment.\n\nThe system is currently deployed by the JGSDF, JASDF and JMSDF with 57 fire units serving with the ground force (out of an initial requirement for 76), 30 serving with the air force, and 6 serving with the maritime force.\n\n"}

The reservoir sits in the foothills above the town on the western side of the Dakota Hogback, which contains the reservoir along its eastern side. The reservoir runs north-south for approximately 6.5 miles (10 km) and is approximately one-half mile (1 km) wide. It was constructed in 1949 by the Bureau of Reclamation as part of its federal Colorado-Big Thompson Project or \"C-BT\". Water distribution is currently managed by Reclamation and operated by the Northern Colorado Water Conservancy District. Horsetooth and Carter Lake serve as the two principal reservoirs for water diverted eastward under the continental divide via the C-BT.\n\nThe reservoir is a supplementary source of municipal water for Fort Collins, Greeley and other communities in the region, as well as for irrigation in the lower South Platte River basin. The reservoir takes its name from Horsetooth Mountain, a summit in the foothills west of the southern end of the reservoir.\n\nThe construction of the reservoir inundated the community of Stout. Prior to construction, the majority of the town moved to a location that today surrounds Horsetooth's South Bay, but a few building foundations, including that of the old school house, are now under water. The reservoir has a capacity of , a total shoreline of 25 miles (40 km). The reservoir is located roughly at . In recent history the reservoir has experienced relatively low water levels; however, in June 2014, it reached 98.6% of its capacity, the highest it had been in four years.\n\nHorsetooth Reservoir was created by the construction of four separate large earthen dams, all completed in 1949 and all modernized with a seismic retrofit in 2000-2004. The four dams, listed from north to south, are:\n\n\nTogether the dams contain more than 10 million cubic yards of earthfill.\n\nThe reservoir is a popular recreation destination for the region. According to a recent study conducted by the Bureau of Reclamation and the recreation manager at Horsetooth, Larimer County Parks and Open Lands, approximately 570,000 visitors come to Horsetooth every year. Larimer County has provided recreation management at Horsetooth, which is surrounded by 1,900 acres of public lands, and three other C-BT reservoirs since they opened in the early 1950s.\n\nRecreational boating is popular during summer months and swimming is allowed at the specifically designated Swim Beach maintained by LCPOL as well as in some of the coves. Kayaking and canoeing is also popular. Fishing is also highly popular from boats or from shore, but is no longer allowed from the dams due to security concerns. Since the late 1960s, the sport of bouldering has become an established climbing pastime at the reservoir, the hard Dakota sandstone providing many challenging problems for both American and foreign athletes. However cliff diving is prohibited in all areas of the reservoir due to safety concerns. Park rangers patrol the reservoir for violators to keep everyone enjoying the reservoirs safely. Road cycling around Horsetooth has also become popular as has hiking and mountain biking, particularly along the Foothills Trail that traverses the reservoir's eastern edge. The City of Fort Collins maintains several open spaces directly below the reservoir and the state-owned Lory State Park is along the reservoir's northwestern shore.\n\nOther ridge lines surrounding the reservoir have become the site of residential development in recent decades, with structures ranging from get-away-cabins to luxury homes.\n\n\n"}

After Colette chose Ravel to set the text to music, a copy was sent to him in 1916 while he was still serving in the war; however, the mailed script was lost. In 1917, Ravel finally received a copy and agreed to compose the score, humorously replying to Colette, \"I would like to compose this, but I have no daughter.\" It was eventually agreed that the composition would be more of an operetta, but retain the ballet dance elements. Colette accordingly revised the text and developed a libretto.\n\nRavel stopped composition of the work in the spring of 1920, suffering from physical exhaustion and poor health. In the next few years he was compelled to complete the work by Raoul Gunsbourg, director of the Monte Carlo Opera, who had insisted Ravel write a sequel to \"L'Heure espagnole\". By this time Ravel had become newly inspired by the stage presentations of American musicals and revues by composers such as George Gershwin. Ravel's work on the composition began to incorporate the musical style of these productions.\n\nBy early 1925 he had finally completed it. Colette, who had believed that the work would never be completed, expressed her extreme pleasure, believing that her modest writing had been raised beyond its initial scope. Now officially under the title of \"L'enfant et les sortilèges\", the first performance took place on 21 March 1925 in Monte Carlo, conducted by Victor de Sabata, with ballet sequences choreographed by George Balanchine. Ravel said of the premiere production:\n\nMarie-Thérèse Gauley sang the part of the child at both the premiere in Monte-Carlo and the first performance at the Opéra-Comique on 1 February 1926. The original cast also included Henri Fabert as Vieillard Arithmétique, Warnerey as the clock and cat, while at the Opéra-Comique, conducted by Albert Wolff and with choreography by Louise Virard, the cast included Germaine Féraldy, Mathilde Calvet, Madeleine Sibille, Roger Bourdin, René Hérent and Louis Guenot.\n\nThe opera was then seen in Prague (17 February 1927), Leipzig (6 May 1927) and Vienna (14 March 1929). The US premiere was given on 19 September 1930 by the San Francisco Opera. The Canadian premiere of the work was a film version made by CBC Television in 1950 with conductor Wilfrid Pelletier. It was not until 3 December 1958 that the opera was given its UK premiere, in the Town Hall in Oxford.\n\nThe score specifies that fire / the princess / nightingale must be sung by the same singer, and the little old man and frog by the same singer. It is also specified that the following groups or pairs of roles can be sung by the same singer: mother / china cup / dragonfly; the bergère / owl; the female cat / the squirrel; the male cat / grandfather clock; the armchair / tree.\n\nPart 1\n\nThis is the story of a rude child who is reprimanded by the objects in his room, which he has been destroying. After being scolded by his mother in the beginning of the opera, the child throws a tantrum, destroying the room around him and harming the animals nearby. He is then surprised to find that the unhappy objects in his room come to life. The furniture and decorations begin to talk; even his homework takes shape as it becomes an old man and a chorus of numbers. They all sing out the pain and misery that the child inflicts on them and their wishes to punish him for his misdeeds.\n\nPart 2\n\nThe bedroom becomes a garden filled with singing animals and plants which have been tortured by the child. The child attempts to make friends with the animals and plants, but they shun him because of the injuries he did to them earlier, before they could talk. They leave him aside, and in his loneliness, he eventually cries out \"Maman\". At this, the animals turn on him and attack him in an act of vengeance, but they wind up jostling among each other as the child is tossed aside. At the culmination, a squirrel is hurt, which causes the other animals to stop fighting. The child bandages the squirrel's wound and collapses exhausted. Seeing this act of kindness, the animals have a change of heart toward the child, and decide to try to help him home. They mimic the cry of \"Maman\", carry the child back to his house, and sing in praise of the child. The opera ends with the child singing \"Maman\", as he greets his mother, in the very last bar of the score.\n\n\nThe opera calls for a large orchestra, a mixed chorus of adults, a chorus of children and eight soloists, most of whom individually play a number of characters. The scale of the cast and fantastic setting make the opera difficult to stage, which helps to explain why the work is not performed often. Ravel uses various subtle leitmotifs throughout the work, and there is considerable virtuosity in the instrumental writing. Yet the orchestra plays a mostly secondary role to the sung melodies: Ravel explained that he was following the style of Gershwin and American operettas of the time. Ravel contrasted the work to his previous opera, \"L'heure espagnole\":\n\nThe opera was initially well received in Monte Carlo, but in a Paris production the following year it was less successful. André Messager criticized the purposely imitative nature of the music, but Francis Poulenc and Les six were impressed. His cat duet \"Duo miaulé\" is often seen as a parody of Wagner, which was quite controversial, although Arthur Honegger praised this piece in particular. The use of pentatonic music and parallel fourths in the depiction of the Chinese tea cup is an example of \"orientalism\" in orchestral music.\n\n\n\n"}

From the 1030s, however, the coin was increasingly debased, until in the 1080s, following the military disasters and civil wars of the previous decade, its gold content was reduced to almost zero. Consequently, in 1092, Emperor Alexios I Komnenos ( 1081–1118) undertook a drastic overhaul of the Byzantine coinage system and introduced a new gold coin, the \"hyperpyron\" (meaning \"super-refined\"). This was of the same standard weight (4.45 grams) as the \"solidus\", but of less gold content (20.5 carats instead of 24) due to the recycling of earlier debased coins.\n\nThe \"hyperpyron\" remained the standard gold coin until gold coins ceased to be minted by the Byzantines in the mid-14th century. It too, however, was subject to gradual debasement: under the Empire of Nicaea (1204–1261), its gold content fell gradually to 18 carats, under Michael VIII Palaiologos ( 1259–1282) to 15 and under his son and successor Andronikos II Palaiologos ( 1282–1328) to 12 carats. At the same time, the quality of the coins declined as well, and in the 14th century, their weight was far from uniform. The last \"hyperpyra\", and thus the last Byzantine gold coins, were struck by Emperor John VI Kantakouzenos ( 1347–1352). The name remained in use thereafter solely as a money of account, divided into 24 \"keratia\".\n\nThe name was adopted in various forms by Western Europeans (, ) and the Slavic countries of the Balkans (\"perper\", \"iperpero\", etc.) designating various coins, usually silver, as well as moneys of account. More often in the West the \"hyperpyron\" was called the \"bezant\", especially among Italian merchants.\n\nIn the early Komnenian period, the \"hyperpyron\" was the equivalent of three electrum \"trachea\", 48 billon \"trachea\" or 864 copper \"tetartera\", although with the debasement of the \"trachea\" it eventually came to rate 12 electrum \"trachea\" and 288 to 384 billon \"trachea\". In the 14th century, the \"hyperpyron\" equalled 12 of the new silver \"basilika\", 96 \"tournesia\", 384 copper \"trachea\" and 768 copper \"assaria\".\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1878793", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1878793", "title": "Form criticism", "text": "Form criticism\n\nForm criticism as a method of biblical criticism classifies units of scripture by literary pattern and then attempts to trace each type to its period of oral transmission. Form criticism seeks to determine a unit's original form and the historical context of the literary tradition. \n\nHermann Gunkel (1862-1932), Martin Noth, Gerhard von Rad, and other scholars originally developed form criticism for Old Testament studies; they used it to supplement the documentary hypothesis with reference to its oral foundations. Karl Ludwig Schmidt, Martin Dibelius (1883-1947) and Rudolf Bultmann later applied form criticism to the Gospels.\n\nOver the past few decades, form criticism's emphasis on oral tradition has waned in Old Testament studies. This is largely because scholars are increasingly skeptical about the ability to distinguish the \"original\" oral traditions from the literary sources that preserve them. As a result, the method as applied to the Old Testament now focuses on the Bible's literary genres, becoming virtually synonymous with genre criticism.\n\nForm criticism begins by identifying a text's genre or conventional literary form, such as parables, proverbs, epistles, or love poems. It goes on to seek the sociological setting for each text's genre, its \"situation in life\" (German: \"Sitz im Leben\"). For example, the sociological setting of a law is a court, or the sociological setting of a psalm of praise (hymn) is a worship context, or that of a proverb might be a father-to-son admonition. Having identified and analyzed the text's genre-pericopes, form criticism goes on to ask how these smaller genre-pericopes contribute to the purpose of the text as a whole.\n\nStudies based on form criticism state that the Evangelists drew upon oral traditions when composing the canonical gospels. This oral tradition consisted of several distinct components. Parables and aphorisms are the \"bedrock of the tradition.\" Pronouncement stories, scenes that culminate with a saying of Jesus, are more plausible historically than other kinds of stories about Jesus. Other sorts of stories include controversy stories, in which Jesus is in conflict with religious authorities; miracles stories, including healings, exorcisms, and nature wonders; call and commissioning stories; and legends. The oral model developed by the form critics drew heavily on contemporary theory of Jewish folkloric transmission of oral material, and as a result of this form criticism one can trace the development of the early gospel tradition. However, \"Today it is no exaggeration to claim that a whole spectrum of main assumptions underlying Bultmann's \"Synoptic Tradition\" must be considered suspect.\"\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1878824", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1878824", "title": "Dornier Seastar", "text": "Dornier Seastar\n\nThe Dornier Seastar is a turboprop-powered amphibious aircraft built largely of composite materials. Developed by of Germany, it first flew in 1984. The design is owned by Claudius Jr's son, Conrado, who founded Dornier Seawings AG (now Dornier Seawings) to continue work on the project after two previous firms, Claudius Dornier Aircraft and Dornier Composite Aircraft, both went into bankruptcy. Development of the aircraft was put on hold without any production Seastars being completed in 1991.\n\nMultiple attempts to put the Seastar into production, often as a joint venture with other aerospace companies, were made throughout the 1990s and early 2000s. However securing the necessary financing to proceed to the manufacturing phase proved challenging. After several false starts, in October 2009, Dornier Seawings announced that it was formally launching manufacturing of the type, although no aircraft were actually built. In November 2018 the company received US$170M in funding from its Chinese backers to construct a manufacturing facility and one prototype for flight, with production to follow in 2021.\n\nThe first prototype, a proof-of-concept aircraft, using the metal wings from a Dornier Do 28 and with large struts bracing the wing to the sponsons, conducted its maiden flight from Hamburg on 17 August 1984. A second prototype, which was more representative of the definitive design, featured several alterations; these included the adoption of a new composite wing, which connected with a set of cabane struts to the fuselage only, and was a larger aircraft overall. On 24 April 1987, the second prototype made its first flight from Oberpfaffenhofen. Development work on the project came to a close in 1991. A total of three aircraft had been produced at this point. In 1990, a European certificate of airworthiness was received for the type; in 1991, American airworthiness was also granted to the Seastar.\n\nDuring the 1990s, the programme encountered severe organisational issues, including a lack of funding and backers who subsequently withdrew their participation. In November 1989, the company behind the Seastar, Claudius Dornier Aircraft, filed for bankruptcy, amid claims that the German government had failed to support the project. Prior to this, more than 50 options and letters of intent had been received for the type. In 1990, Dornier Composite Aircraft acquired the Seastar program, but this firm was also bankrupt within two years. As a result, a new company, Dornier Seastar, was formed to complete the aircraft's development and to produce the type, and began to seek partnerships with Asian companies to achieve this.\n\nIn 1993, Dornier Seastar and a consortium of Malaysian investors signed a joint venture agreement, under which assembly of the Seastar was envisioned to take place at a factory in Malaysia within the following year. However, in July 1995, a company spokesperson stated that Dornier Seastar's Malaysian subsidiary would be shelved until further notice, due a lack of capital investment; it has been allegedly that investors were concerned about the technical and financial viability of the project, such as the acquisition of internationally recognised production certification in Malaysia. By the time of the withdrawal, all of the manufacturing tools, moulds and jigs to produce that aircraft had already been transferred to Penang, Malaysia, along with a prototype aircraft for sales demonstration purposes at Subang Airport, Selangor.\n\nFollowing the collapse of the Malaysian joint venture, Dornier Seastar promptly set about attracting new investors to finance the program into the manufacturing phase. While the company focused its search on the Asian market, representatives stated that they were considering relocating production of the type to another country; Dornier Seastar also dismissed claims that a further $100 million were required to complete development of the aircraft's design. In early 1998, Dornier Seastar proposed the formation of a partnership with Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL), with the goal of producing the type as a joint venture. HAL confirmed that it was examining the viability for the Seastar in the Indian market.\n\nBy 2003, one of the two Seastar prototypes had been restored and received public transport certification in December of that year. In February 2004, the company stated that, in addition to seeking investment, it had been evaluating potential manufacturing sites in Europe and Asia prior to initiating a planned development phase later that year. It was said that feasibility studies and market analysis indicated that there was a global demand for around 250 such aircraft over the next ten years; furthermore, that it was proposing three different versions of the aircraft, each one for a different market segment: A surveillance variant for government agencies, a 12-seat regional airliner configuration aimed at charter operators, and a six-seat layout that was suited to VIP customers. In August 2006, there were claims made that the project was close to being relaunched with backing from firms in Singapore and Abu Dhabi, the latter being contingent upon the Seastar being manufactured in Abu Dhabi.\n\nIn October 2008, the company announced its intentions to produce the Seastar in the US, in part due to favourable currency exchange rates. Fabrication was to be outsourced to other companies, and was intended to use mainly American suppliers. The firm viewed the aircraft as having a niche role among private owners, airlines, and search and rescue operators. Dornier Seawings stated that it was seeking an additional $150 million to bring the type into mass production; it was also said that, in the event of 25 or more sales being secured, the Seastart could be in production as early as March 2009. In March 2009, the firm stated that it was pushing back its planned launch to the third quarter of that year, attributing this to the effects of the Great Recession, but remained optimistic about market demand for the type; it was also said that Dornier required only an additional $65 million, rather than the $150 million figure given in an earlier business plan, to establish full production status and to begin manufacturing work.\n\nIn October 2009, Dornier Seaplane announced that it would launch production of the Seastar. According to Dornier Seaplane chief executive Joe Walker, the aircraft had been well received by a variety of public and private operators, and had received more than 25 letters of intent to procure the Seastar; he also stated that 2010 would be dedicated to selecting a final assembly site and major suppliers for the aircraft's manufacturing, and the first aircraft was then scheduled to be rolled out by the end of 2011.\n\nIn May 2010, Dornier Seaplane announced that it would build the Seastar in Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, about half an hour away from Montreal, Quebec, Canada. The site was picked due to the strength of the local supply chain and presence of skilled aerospace workers, as well as its proximity to Lake Champlain for flight operations. At this point, the company aimed to deliver their first production aircraft in 2012; production was projected to rise from a single aircraft in 2012, to six in 2013 and to 12 in 2014; dependent on demand, as many as 50 Seastars per year could eventually be built.\n\nIn 2013, the Seastar was acquired by Chinese companies Wuxi Communications Industry and Wuxi Industrial Development with the Dornier family retaining a minority stake.\nThe company became a joint venture with these two state-owned companies, and plans to produce the aircraft in two locations, with one site in Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany and another in Wuxi, China.\n\nIn January 2016, Dornier Seaplane announced that Seastar airframes would be built by Diamond Aircraft Industries.\nIn February 2016, Dornier launched the improved CD2.\nThe first new-generation Seastar rolled out on 18 August 2017 in Oberpfaffenhoffen and is prepared for its first flight in the first half of 2019, for a 2020 type certification.\nIt includes a redesigned and upgraded interior, Honeywell Primus Epic 2.0 avionics, a stern thruster, new Sumitomo corrosion-resistant landing gear, hydraulic electrically steerable nose gear, MT five-blade composite propellers and Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6A-135As.\nBy November 2018, the Chinese shareholders invested €150 million ($172 million) to develop and produce the CD2, to construct a new facility in Wuxi and to expand its Oberpfaffenhofen base, for a 2021 service entry.\n\nIt first flew on 28 March 2020.\n\nThe Dornier Seastar is a parasol wing flying boat, powered by a pair of Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6A-112 engines, mounted in a single nacelle over the wings in a push-pull configuration. In general layout, it strongly resembles both the innovative Dornier \"Wal\" all-metal monoplane flying boat of the 1920s, of which over 250 examples were built, and its direct successor, the larger Dornier Flugzeugwerke's Do 18 of the 1930s. Locating both of the engines in the center of the wing enables the weight of the engines to be more effective in reducing any induced rolling motions; it also protects the engines from water spray, reducing corrosion, and eliminates asymmetric thrust when operating.\n\nThe Seastar's fuselage is composed of a fiberglass composite material, which is corrosion-proof as well as being less prone to leaks in comparison to rivetted metal hull counterparts. Unlike typical floatplanes, which are often conversions of land-based aircraft, the Seastar has a low vertical center of gravity, achieved in part by carrying all of its fuel within its sponsons instead of the wings. The sponsons, which provide stability while submerged on the water, are shaped to break surface tension and to generate considerable lift during the acceleration performed during takeoff; they also accommodate the main landing gear. Other flying boats often retract the landing gear into the hull instead. The landing gear can be optionally removed and reinstalled when needed; a special 'water mode' for the landing gear is also present which prevents their deployment during a water-based landing.\n\nThe hull of the Seastar features complex angling and shaping, as the result of extensive water tank testing. Pilots exit and enter the Seastar through a single door on the left-hand side of the aircraft from the sponson, and passengers board via a separate hatch located aft of the wing, also stepping from the sponson. This approach enables the aircraft to close to a relatively short distance from docks or boats for boarding purposes. The cabin can house up to 12 passengers, in addition to the crew in high-density seating, or can alternatively accommodate six-nine passengers in more spacious configurations; an aft baggage compartment is also present.\n\nA series of improvements have been projected for the aircraft, such as the integration of an autopilot to enable single-pilot operations. Other prospective improvements include the adoption of a glass cockpit, deicing equipment, and air conditioning systems. Early production aircraft are intended to be compatible with the retrofitting of these improvements later on. According to Dornier Seawings, for surveillance missions the Seastar's flight endurance can be extended to around 11 flight hours by cruising on only a single engine. It is also claimed that the Seastar is one of the fastest flying boats on the market.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1878832", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1878832", "title": "English tort law", "text": "English tort law\n\nEnglish tort law concerns the compensation for harm to people's rights to health and safety, a clean environment, property, their economic interests, or their reputations. A \"tort\" is a wrong in civil, rather than criminal law, that usually requires a payment of money to make up for damage that is caused. Alongside contracts and unjust enrichment, tort law is usually seen as forming one of the three main pillars of the law of obligations. \n\nIn English law, torts like other civil cases are generally tried in front a judge without a jury.\n\nFollowing Roman law, the English system has long been based on a closed system of nominate torts, such as trespass, battery and conversion. This is in contrast to continental legal systems, which have since adopted more open systems of tortious liability. There are various categories of tort, which lead back to the system of separate causes of action. The tort of negligence is however increasing in importance over other types of tort, providing a wide scope of protection, especially since \"Donoghue v Stevenson\". For liability under negligence, a duty of care must be established owed to a group of persons to which the victim belongs, a nebulous concept into which many other categories are being pulled.\n\nLiability for negligence arises when one person breaches a duty of care owed to another. The main elements of negligence are:\n\nIn some situations, defences will be available to negligence. Special rules, and considerable bodies of case law have developed around four further particular fields in negligence: for psychiatric injury, economic loss, for public bodies, and when concerning omissions and third parties. \n\nThe establishment of a duty of care is usually broken up into a three-step test. The first case to establish a general duty of care was \"Donoghue v Stevenson\". Famously, Mrs Donoghue claimed compensation for illness after she consumed a ginger beer containing a decomposed snail in a public house in Paisley, Scotland. The bottle was opaque so neither Mrs Donoghue nor the shopkeeper could see a snail, and at the time she could not sue the shopkeeper for breach of contract or consumer rights. The House of Lords by a majority held that the manufacturer, Mr Stevenson, was liable in tort. Lord Atkin held liability was \"based upon a general public sentiment of moral wrongdoing for which the offender must pay\" and people \"must take reasonable care to avoid acts or omissions which you can reasonably foresee would be likely to injure your neighbour.\" By contrast, Lord Macmillan suggested that the law should protect Mrs Donoghue by incremental analogy to previous cases. Nevertheless, Lord Atkin's speech was widely followed and was understood to contain three main points for establishing a duty of care. First, the concept of reasonable foreseeability of harm; second, the claimant and the defendant being in a relationship of proximity; third, and more loosely, it being fair, just and reasonable to impose liability on the defendant for his careless actions. This three-step scheme (also known as the tripartite or threefold test), however, did not crystallise until the case of \"Caparo Industries Plc v Dickman\". A company called Caparo took over another company by buying up a majority of its shares. It did this because it sneakily obtained word from a company audit that the target was financially sound. The audit was prepared by a group of accountants (Dickman) and was intended for shareholders, not outsiders. Once Caparo owned the company it found that the finances were in fact pretty shoddy, and so it sued the accountants for being negligent in its audit preparation. The House of Lords found against Caparo and established the current threefold test. Although it was \"reasonably foreseeable\" that outsiders might learn of the carelessly prepared information, it was not the case that Caparo and Dickman were in a relationship of \"proximity\". This the court used as a term of art (note, this is different from the American use of the word) to say that it \"should\" not be the case that absolutely anyone who heard something said that was stupid and acted on it can sue. The court was reacting to its concern that to allow a claim here might open the floodgates of litigation. The third element, whether liability would be \"fair, just and reasonable\", was an extra hurdle added as a catch-all discretionary measure for the judiciary to block further claims.\n\n\nOnce a duty of care has been established, it must be shown that a duty has been breached. The question the courts ask is whether the behaviour exhibited by the defendant fell below the threshold of a \"reasonable man\" (the objective test). In some cases where the defendant was in a special profession, e.g. being a doctor, the court will ask what standard of care a \"reasonable doctor\" or the like might have done. Allowance is usually made for the defendants age and a lower standard of a \"reasonable child of a certain age\" is applied to children. On the other hand, no allowance is made for other personal circumstances, such as the fact that the defendant was inexperienced in the task he set out to perform. He is expected to perform this task as a reasonably skilled and competent person.\n\n\nCausation is complex, and is usually discussed in two parts. Simple causation is a question of whether \"but for\" the action by the defendant harm would have resulted. There has been some deal of discussion over whether a contributory cause is enough, and a variety of supplementary tests have been developed (e.g. the material contribution to risk and material damage to damage tests), often to deal specifically with a particular area of liability (asbestos cases, for instance).\n\n\nAfter a causal link has been properly established, the courts may still deny compensation if the harm was a very remote consequence of the initial wrong. So long as a type of damage is foreseeable, however, the manner in which it occurred – however remote – is of no concern to the courts.\n\n\nFinding a successful defence absolves the defendant from full or partial liability for damages, which makes them valuable commodities in the court. There are three main defences to tortious liability; to argue the claimant voluntarily undertook the risk of his harm, that he contributed to the harm, or that he engaged in illegal activity.\n\n\"Volenti non fit injuria\" is Latin for \"to the willing, no injury is done\". It operates when the claimant either expressly or implicitly consents to the risk of loss or damage. For example, if a regular spectator at an ice hockey match is injured when a player strikes the puck in the ordinary course of play, causing it to fly out of the rink and hit him or her, this is a foreseeable event and regular spectators are assumed to accept that risk of injury when buying a ticket. A slightly more limited defence may arise where the defendant has been given a warning, whether expressly to the plaintiff/claimant or by a public notice, sign or otherwise, that there is a danger of injury. The extent to which defendants can rely on notices to exclude or limit liability varies from country to country. This is an issue of policy as to whether defendants should not only warn of a known danger, but also take active steps to fence the site and take other reasonable precautions to prevent the known danger from befalling those foreseen to be at risk.\n\nContributory negligence is a mitigatory defence, whereby a claimant's damages are reduced in accordance with the percentage of contribution made by the claimant to the loss or damage suffered. Thus, in evaluating a collision between two vehicles, for example, if the wronged driver were not wearing a seatbelt, he would most likely be contributorily negligent. The court will then quantify the damages for the actual loss or damage sustained, and then reduce the amount paid to the claimant by 20%. Contributory negligence can also function as a full defence, when it is assessed at 100%, as in \"Jayes v IMI Kynoch\".\n\n\"Ex turpi causa non oritur actio\" is the illegality defence, the Latin for \"no right of action arises from a despicable cause\". If the claimant is involved in wrongdoing at the time the alleged negligence occurred, this may extinguish or reduce the defendant's liability. Thus, if a burglar is verbally challenged by the property owner and sustains injury when jumping from a second story window to escape apprehension, there is no cause of action against the property owner even though that injury would not have been sustained \"but for\" the property owner's intervention. However, a trespasser may be able to recover damages due to the unsafe state of the premises (see Occupiers' Liability below).\n\n\nHistorically, English courts have been reluctant to allow claims for nervous shock. Early claims involved ladies who suffered what the courts referred to as a \"malady of the mind.\" It was not expected for men to succumb to such problems.\n\nToday, courts are considerably less cautious but additional hurdles are still imposed upon claimants under certain circumstances. The following criteria must be satisfied:\n\n\nThe courts had been cautious for a number of reasons, including the fear of floodgates (indeterminate liability), potential for fraud (brought on by people exaggerating their claims), problems of proof and diagnosis (including the costs of expert opinion), psychiatric illness may be considered less serious than physical harm, the claimant is often a secondary victim, and finally, the courts argued that Parliament is better suited to dealing with this area.\n\nBut recently, in many cases, it has been recognised that psychiatric injury is more dangerous than physical injury. Claims can arise in a number of circumstances:\n\nDirect Participants\n\nIn the case of \"Dulieu v White\" [1901] 2 KB 669, the claimant, Mrs Dulieu, was working in a public house. While she was serving, the defendant negligently drove his horse-drawn van into the bar. She suffered shock which resulted in a miscarriage, and she sued the defendant. Mr White was held liable for causing nervous shock resulting in miscarriage, as the claimant reasonably believed herself to be in danger.\n\nSimilarly, in \"Page v Smith\" [1995] AC 155, it was held that Mr Smith was liable for causing Mr Page psychiatric injury (chronic fatigue syndrome) after a car crash, because Mr Smith could have reasonably foreseen that Mr Page would suffer physical injury for the crash. So liability for causing psychiatric injury depends on the foreseeability of the physical injury, as long as the psychiatric illness is medically recognised.\n\nIn \"Young v Charles Church\" (Southern LTD)(1997) 39 BMLR 146, the claimant was a \"participant\" in the event (i.e. a primary victim – Evans & Hitchinson LJJ). He and Mr Cook were raising scaffolding poles in an area that was not secured by the employers; the power lines were not switched off. Mr Cook touched a pole to the electric wiring and suffered a horrific death which caused Mr Young great distress. Even though he never feared for the loss of his own life, the court held that Mr Young was in the area of potential damage, so he was entitled to claim compensation.\n\nFinally, in \"McLoughlin v Jones\" [2002] QB 1312, there was an allegation that Mr McLoughlin was a bad landlord, threatening and beating up tenants to get their rent from them in cash. He was charged for a criminal offence and sentenced to prison. He claimed that his solicitors (Jones and Others) had acted without the evidence, especially the witness statement of a person who knew that Mr McLoughlin was not present when the beatings allegedly took place. It soon became apparent that he was actually an upstanding member of society and he suffered psychiatric injury as a result of the imprisonment and loss of reputation. (Note that solicitors have a pre-existing duty of care towards their clients.)\n\nSecondary Victims\n\nThe case of \"Alcock v Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police\" established a tripartite test to establish whether a claim by a secondary victim can succeed:\n\n\nCase law where this test has been applied includes \"McLoughlin v O'Brian\" [1983] AC 410, in which the husband and children of the claimant were involved in a car accident that was caused by the negligence of the defendant. The claimant found out about the accident an hour later and, when she got to the hospital two hours later, one child had already died. She saw her husband and children suffering and suffered shock, depression and a change of personality. The court established a spectrum of proximity; a pedestrian should be able to withstand seeing the accidents that occur in everyday life, but a family member of the victims will inevitably suffer greater emotional harm. Nonetheless, simply seeing the aftermath of the accident and not witnessing it is insufficient proximity. Similarly, seeing a video of the accident is insufficient.\n\n\"Alcock v Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police\" (1992) HL was a test case in the aftermath of the Hillsborough disaster, where 95 spectators were crushed to death and 400 injured in a stadium. The event was televised and broadcast on radio. In \"Alcock\", claims for damages for psychiatric illness were brought by fifteen relatives of the victims of the tragedy; some of them had been present at the match - but not in the area where the disaster occurred - and others had seen it on television or heard it on the radio. The Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police denied that the claimants were owed a duty of care. On the basis of the three exclusion criteria mentioned above, all claims were ruled out.\n\n\n\n\nWhile negligence actions set a general groundwork, many further fields of tort have developed their own identity or, where judicial decision-making was seen as insufficient by Parliament, through statutory reform. Major statutory torts concern food safety, health and safety and environmental law. For example, liability under the Nuclear Installations Act 1965, the Merchant Shipping Act 1995, or liability imposed on utility (gas and electricity) companies to ensure the safety of their products, all of which are strict liability. While a statute has said nothing specific, a tortious duty may have arisen. This will be a question of statutory interpretation (e.g. \"Stovin v Wise\" [1996] AC 923).\n\nIn consumer protection, with the \"Product Liability Directive\" in the European Union, where businesses making defective products that harm people must pay for any damage resulting. Liability for defective products is strict (see strict liability) in most jurisdictions. The theory of risk spreading provides support for this approach. Since manufacturers are the 'cheapest cost avoiders', because they have a greater chance to seek out problems, it makes sense to give them the incentive to guard against product defects.\n\nOne of the principal terms that accompanies the employment relationship is that the employer will provide a \"safe system of work\". As the industrial revolution developed, accidents from a hazardous working environment were a front line target for labour legislation, as a series of Factories Acts, from 1802, required minimum standards in workplace cleanliness, ventilation, fencing machinery, not to mention restrictions on child labour and limits to the working day. These Acts typically targeted particular kinds of workplaces, such as mines, or textile mills, before the more generalised approach took hold now seen in the Factories Act 1961. That applies to any workplace where an article is made or changed, or animals are kept and slaughtered. The Employer's Liability (Defective Equipment) Act 1969 made employers automatically liable for equipment with defects supplied by third parties. Because isolated employees lack the technical skill, time, training to litigate, such regulation's primary line of enforcement was through inspectors or agencies before matters went to court. Today the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974, enforced by the Health and Safety Executive, is the main law. The HSE can delegate enforcement to local authorities, whose inspectors have the power to investigate and require changes to workplace systems. In addition, HSWA 1974 section 2 foresees that employees will set up their own workplace committees, elected by the employees and with the power to codetermine health and safety matters with management. Spelling out the general duties found in HSWA 1974, are a set of health and safety regulations, which must also stay in line with the European-wide harmonised requirements of the Health and Safety Directive.\nWhile the modern scheme of legislation and regulation engenders a comprehensive approach to enforcement and worker participation for health and safety matters, the common law remains relevant for getting civil law compensation, and some limits on an employers' duties. Although the legislative provisions are not automatic, breach of a statutory duty is evidence that a civil law duty has been breached. Injured employees can generally claim for loss of income, and relatives or dependents recover small sums to reflect distress. In principle, employers are vicariously liable for all actions of people acting for them in the \"course of employment\" whenever their actions have a \"close connection\" to the job, and even if it breaks an employer's rules. Only if an employee is on a \"frolic of his own\", and the employer cannot be said to have placed him in a position to cause harm, will the employer have a defence. Under the Employers’ Liability (Compulsory Insurance) Act 1969, employers must take out insurance for all injury costs, and insurance companies are precluded by law and practice from suing their employees to recover costs unless there is fraud. However, until the mid-20th century there were a series of major limitations. First, until 1937, if an employee was injured by a co-worker, the doctrine of common employment, the employer could only be liable if it was shown they were personally liable by carelessness in selecting staff. The House of Lords changed this in \"Wilsons & Clyde Coal Co Ltd v English\", holding an employer had a non-delegable duty of care for all employees. Lord Wright held there were \"fundamental obligations of a contract of employment... for which employers are absolutely responsible\". The second old restriction was that, until 1891, \"volenti non fit injuria\" meant workers were assumed to voluntarily accept the dangers of their work by agreeing to their contracts of employment. Only if an employee callously ignores clear directions of the employer will he be taken to have voluntarily assumed the risk, like in \"ICI Ltd v Shatwell\" where an experience quarry shotfirer said he \"could not be bothered\" to wait 10 minutes before setting of a detonation, and blew up his brother. Third, even if a worker was slightly at fault, until 1945 such contributory negligence precluded the whole of the claim. Now the court will only reduce damages by the amount the employee contributed to their own injury. The fourth defence available to employers, which still exists, is \"ex turpi causa non oritur actio\", that if the employee was engaged in any illegal activity they may not claim compensation for injuries. In \"Hewison v Meridian Shipping Services Pte Ltd\" Mr Hewison concealed his epilepsy so that he could work offshore was technically guilty of illegally attempting to gain a pecuniary advantage by deception under the Theft Act 1968 section 16. After being struck in the head by a defective gangplank he suffered worse fits than before, but the Court of Appeal, by a majority, held his illegal act precluded any compensation.\n\nThe common law of tort also remains particularly relevant for the type of liability an employer has where there is scientific uncertainty about the cause of an injury. In asbestos disease cases, a worker may have been employed with at a number of jobs where he was exposed to asbestos, but his injury cannot with certainty be traced to any one. Although he may be able to sue all of them, a number may have already gone insolvent. In \"Fairchild v Glenhaven Funeral Services Ltd\" the House of Lords held that if any employer had materially increased the risk of harm to the worker, they could would be jointly and severally liable and could be sued for the full sum, leaving it up to them to seek contribution from others and thus the risk of other businesses' insolvency. For a brief period, in \"Barker v Corus\" the House of Lords then decided that employers would only be liable on a proportionate basis, thus throwing the risk of employers' insolvency back onto workers. Immediately Parliament passed the Compensation Act 2006 section 3 to reverse the decision on its facts. It has also been held in \"Chandler v Cape plc\", in 2011, that even though a subsidiary company is the direct employer of a worker, a parent company will owe a duty of care. Thus shareholders may not be able to hide behind the corporate veil to escape their obligations for the health and safety of the workforce.\n\nMany serious accidents in practice take place on the roads. Like workplaces, this encouraged Parliament to require compulsory insurance for harm. The Road Traffic Act 1988 requires that motorists either be insured against any liability for injuries to other drivers, pedestrians or passengers and damage to property, or have made a specified deposit (£500,000 in 1991) and keeps the sum deposited with the Accountant General of the Supreme Court. Using an uninsured motor vehicle on public roads is an offence. Private land to which the public have a reasonable right of access (for example, a supermarket car park during opening hours) is considered to be included within the requirements of the Act. Police may seize vehicles that do not appear to have necessary insurance in place. A driver caught driving without insurance for the vehicle he/she is in charge of for the purposes of driving, is liable to be prosecuted by the police and, upon conviction, will receive either a fixed penalty or magistrate's courts penalty. \n\n\n\nOccupiers' Liability is currently governed by the two Occupier's Liability Acts, 1957 and 1984. Under these rules, an occupier, such as a shopkeeper, a home owner or a public authority, who invites others onto their land, or has trespassers, owes a minimum duty of care for people's safety. One early case was \"Cooke v Midland Great Western Railway of Ireland\" [1909] AC 229, in which Lord Macnaughton felt that children who were hurt whilst looking for berries on a building site, should have some compensation for their unfortunate curiosity.\n\n\nThe tort of nuisance allows a claimant (formerly plaintiff) to sue for most acts that interfere with their use and enjoyment of their land. A good example of this is in the case of \"Jones v Powell\" (1629). A brewery made stinking vapors waft to neighbours' property, damaging his papers. Because he was a landowner, the neighbour sued in nuisance for this damage. But Whitelocke J, speaking for the Court of the King's Bench, said that because the water supply was contaminated, it was better that the neighbour's documents were risked. He said \"it is better that they should be spoiled than that the common wealth stand in need of good liquor.\" Nowadays, interfering with neighbours' property is not looked upon so kindly. Nuisance deals with all kinds of things that spoil a landowner's enjoyment of his property.\n\n\nA subset of nuisance is known as the rule in \"Rylands v Fletcher\", which originates in a case where a dam burst into a coal mine shaft. In such cases, a dangerous escape of some hazard, including water, fire, or animals, gives rise to a strict liability claim. This is subject only to a remoteness cap, familiar from negligence when the event is unusual and unpredictable. This was the case where chemicals from a factory seeped through a floor into the water table, contaminating East Anglia's reservoirs.\n\nA trespass is a direct injury to a person, his property or land, committed directly and intentionally by the defendant, for example, walking on someone's land is not trespass but cutting a gate into pieces with a saw is. However, this rule did not cater for anything injured indirectly by a person, for example if a farmer sets fire to a field, and someone's home is subsequently damaged. Trespass by the case did, however, provide a legal writ for injury caused indirectly by an action.\n\n\nDefamation means tarnishing the reputation of someone. It is divided into two parts, slander and libel. Slander is spoken defamation and libel is defaming somebody through print (or broadcasting). Both share the same features. To defame someone, you must (a) make a factual assertion (b) for which you cannot provide evidence of its truth. Defamation does not affect the voicing of opinions, but comes into the same fields as rights to free speech in the European Convention's Article 10.\n\nUK courts have created a common law responsibility to not share non-public information about others under certain circumstances, regardless of the existence of a contractual agreement.\n\nIntentional torts are any intentional acts that are reasonably foreseeable to cause harm to an individual, and that do so. Intentional torts have several subcategories, including tort(s) against the person, including assault, battery, false imprisonment, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and fraud. Property torts involve any intentional interference with the property rights of the claimant. Those commonly recognised include trespass to land, trespass to chattels, and conversion.\n\n\nEconomic torts protect people from interference with their trade or business. The area includes the doctrine of restraint of trade and has largely been submerged in the twentieth century by statutory interventions on collective labour law and modern antitrust or competition law. The \"absence of any unifying principle drawing together the different heads of economic tort liability has often been remarked upon.\"\n\nTwo cases demonstrated economic tort's affinity to competition and labour law. In \"Mogul Steamship Co. Ltd.\" the plaintiff argued he had been driven from the Chinese tea market by competitors at a 'shipping conference' that had acted together to underprice his company. But this cartel was ruled lawful and \"nothing more [than] a war of competition waged in the interest of their own trade.\" Nowadays, this would be considered a criminal cartel. In labour law the most notable case is \"Taff Vale Railway Co v Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants\". The House of Lords thought that unions should be liable in tort for helping workers to go on strike for better pay and conditions, but it riled workers so much that it led to the creation of the British Labour Party and the Trade Disputes Act 1906. Further torts used against unions include conspiracy, interference with a commercial contract or intimidation.\n\nThrough a recent development in common law, beginning with \"Hedley Byrne v Heller\" in 1964, and further through the Misrepresentations Act 1967, a victim of the tort of misrepresentation will be compensated for purely economic loss due to the misconception of the terms of the contract.\n\nThe English doctrine of restraint of trade was the catalyst for much of what is now called \"competition laws\" (or sometimes \"antitrust\"). These laws are a way of restraining those who would restrain \"free competition\" in the market economy, through monopolising production, setting up cartels, imposing unfair trading conditions, prices and so on. The English approach has traditionally been very flexible and liberal in its scope, but draconian when it did deem certain behaviour to be in restraint of trade. Many of these laws around the end of the nineteenth century were focused on the emasculation of trade unionism, until the reforming government of 1906 and the Trade Disputes Act 1906. Aside from the common law, legislation was introduced shortly after the second world war to foot policy on a statutory basis, the Monopolies and Restrictive Practices Act 1948, followed later by the Restrictive Trade Practices Act 1956 and the Monopolies and Mergers Act 1965.\n\nSince 1972, however, the U.K. has fallen under the cross-border-competition law regime of the European Community, which is found primarily in Articles 81 and 82 of the Treaty of the European Community. Companies that form a cartel or collude to disrupt competition (Article 81) or to abuse a dominant position in the market – for instance through a monopoly (Article 82) – face fines from the public-enforcement authorities, and in some cases they also face a cause of action in tort. A huge issue in the E.U. is whether to follow the U.S. approach of private damages actions to prevent anti-competitive conduct. In other words, the question is what should be seen as a private wrong (as was held in the vertical restraints case of \"Courage Ltd v Crehan\") and what should be seen as a public wrong where only public enforcers are competent to impose penalties. In 1998 the United Kingdom brought its legislation up to date, with the Competition Act 1998, followed by the Enterprise Act 2002, a regime mirroring that of the European Union. The domestic enforcers are the Office of Fair Trading and the Competition Commission.\n\nVicarious liability refers to the idea of an employer being liable for torts committed by their employees, generally for policy reasons, and to ensure that victims have a means of recovery. The word \"vicarious\" derives from the Latin for 'change' or 'alternation' and the old Latin for the doctrine is \"respondeat superior\". To establish vicarious liability, the courts must find first that there exists a relationship of employee and employer. The torts of independent contractors generally do not impose vicarious liability on employers; however, \"Honeywill and Stein Ltd v Larkin Brothers Ltd\" demonstrates this principle does not apply where particularly hazardous activities are contracted for, or a non-delegable duty is owed. Secondly, the tort must have been committed 'in the course of employment'; or while an employee is going about the business of their employer. A preferred test of the courts for connecting torts to the course of employment was formulated by John William Salmond, which states that an employer will be held liable for either a wrongful act they have authorised, or a wrongful and unauthorised mode of an act that was authorised. Where in \"Limpus v London General Omnibus Company\" an omnibus driver chose to disobey strict instructions from his employer, to obstruct a rival company, they were still liable, as he was merely engaging in his duties in an unauthorised way. However, in the contrasting case of \"Beard v London General Omnibus Company\", there was no liability where a conductor drove an omnibus negligently, as it was no part of his duties. Under the test, employers were generally not held liable for intentional torts of their employees. \"Lister v Hesley Hall Ltd\" established a newer test, stating that employers would be liable for torts which were \"closely connected\" to the duties of an employee.\n\n\nThe main remedy against tortious loss is compensation in 'damages' or money. In a limited range of cases, tort law will tolerate self-help, such as reasonable force to expel a trespasser. This is a defence against the tort of battery. Further, in the case of a continuing tort, or even where harm is merely threatened, the courts will sometimes grant an injunction. This means a command, for something other than money by the court, such as restraining the continuance or threat of harm.\n\nFor people who have died as a result of another person's tort, the damages that their estate or their families may gain is governed by the Fatal Accidents Act 1976 (replacing the Fatal Accidents Act 1846). Under s.1A the spouse or dependent of a victim may receive £11,800 in bereavement damages.\n\nAs a remedy to tort, injunctions are most commonly used in cases of Nuisance. The court may impose an injunction on a tortfeasor, such as in Sturges v Bridgman. This legally obliges the tortfeasor to stop or reduce the activity causing the nuisance and its breach could, potentially, be a criminal offence. Injunctions may be used instead of or as well as the awarding of damages (above).\n\nScholars and lawyers have identified conflicting aims for the law of tort, to some extent reflected in the different types of damages awarded by the courts: compensatory, aggravated and punitive or exemplary. In \"The Aims of the Law of Tort\" (1951), Glanville Williams saw four possible bases on which different torts rested: appeasement, justice, deterrence and compensation.\n\nFrom the late 1950s a group of legally oriented economists and economically oriented lawyers emphasised incentives and deterrence, and identified the aim of tort as being the efficient distribution of risk. They are often described as the \"law and economics movement\". Ronald Coase, one of the movement's principal proponents, submitted, in his article \"The Problem of Social Cost\" (1960), that the aim of tort should be to reflect as closely as possible liability where transaction costs should be minimised.\n\nCalls for reform of tort law come from diverse standpoints reflecting diverse theories of the objectives of the law. Some calls for reform stress the difficulties encountered by potential claimants. Because of all people who have accidents, only some can find solvent defendants from which to recover damages in the courts, P. S. Atiyah has called the situation a \"damages lottery\". Consequently, in New Zealand, the government in the 1960s established a \"no-fault\" system of state compensation for accidents. Similar proposals have been the subject of command papers in the UK and much academic debate.\n\nThere is some overlap between crime and tort, since tort, a private action, used to be used more than criminal laws in centuries gone. For example, an assault is both a crime and a tort (a form of trespass to the person). A tort allows a person, usually the victim, to obtain a remedy that serves their own purposes (for example by the payment of damages to a person injured in a car accident, or the obtaining of injunctive relief to stop a person interfering with their business). Criminal actions on the other hand are pursued not to obtain remedies to assist a person — although often criminal courts do have power to grant such remedies — but to remove their liberty on the state's behalf. That explains why incarceration is usually available as a penalty for serious crimes, but not usually for torts.\n\n\n"}

C7 is also the highest note on most other keyboard instruments. The seventh octave is the range of notes between C7 and C8. It is easier for very high coloratura sopranos to sing in this octave, but some people who are capable of singing in the bass range (like singers Adam Lopez, Nicola Sedda or Dimash Kudaibergen) can do it. While notes in the sixth octave, between soprano high C and C7, can have enough color to sound flutey or canary-like, the squeaky, whistly tones in the seventh octave help give the whistle register its name, as do the piercing qualities of notes in this octave.\n"}

A DLC digitizes and multiplexes the individual signals carried by the local loops onto a single datastream on the DLC segment.\n\nSubscriber Loop Carrier systems address a number of problems:\n\n\nLong loops, such as those terminating at more than 18,000 feet (5.49 kilometres) from the central office, pose\nelectrical challenges. When the subscriber goes off-hook, a cable pair behaves like a single loop\ninductance coil with a -48 V dc potential and an Electric current of between 20–50 mA dc. Electric current values vary with cable length and gauge. A minimum current of around 20 mA dc is required to convey terminal signalling information to the network. There is also a minimum power level required to provide adequate volume for the voice signal. A variety of schemes were implemented before DLC technology to offset the impedance long loops offered to signalling and volume levels. They included the following:\n\nDLC eliminates the need for these remedies by extending out closer to the customer the line card which digitises the voice signal for use by the PSTN. Once the voice signal is digitised, it is easily manipulated and is no longer subject to the vagaries of the analog loop caused by distance, impedance, attenuation and noise.\n\nThe DLC solution was dubbed \"pair gain\" (from the days when DLC was deployed to recover copper pairs in the loop plant environment).\n\nIn a typical configuration, DLC remote terminals are installed in new neighbourhoods or buildings as a means of reducing the labour and complexity of installing individual local loops from the customer to the central office (CO). A fibre optic cable or several copper pairs for the whole system from the CO to the DLC remote terminal replace the individual pair previously needed for each loop. DLC remote terminals are typically stored in Serving Area Interfaces–metal cabinets alongside or near roadways that overlie communications rights-of-ways.\n\nWith the growth in popularity of digital subscriber line (DSL) and the benefits provided by shorter metallic loops used with DLC systems, digital loop carriers are sometimes integrated with digital subscriber line access multiplexers (DSLAM), both systems then taking advantage of the digital transmission link from the DLC to the CO.\n\nFibre in the loop (FITL) systems are functionally equivalent to DLC. FITL accomplishes the same two primary functions DLC was intended for: pair gain and the elimination of electrical constraints due to long metallic loops. FITL architectures vary from simply deploying fibre feeder plants (between central office and remote terminal site) to \"fibre to the curb\" and, ultimately \"fibre to the home\" where an optical network unit (ONU) is located at each home.\n\nSee also Remote concentrator\n"}

Beyond sports, the first Stagg Field (1893–1957) is remembered for its role in a landmark scientific achievement of Enrico Fermi and the Metallurgical Laboratory during the Manhattan Project. The site of the first artificial nuclear chain reaction, which occurred within the field's west viewing-stands structure, received designation as a National Historic Landmark on February 18, 1965. On October 15, 1966, which is the day that the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 was enacted creating the National Register of Historic Places, it was added to that as well. The site was named a Chicago Landmark on October 27, 1971.\n\nA Henry Moore sculpture, \"Nuclear Energy\", in a small quadrangle commemorates the location of the nuclear experiment. The University's current Stagg Field is located a few blocks away and reuses one of the original gates.\n\nChicago Pile-1, the world's first artificial nuclear reactor, was built under the west stands of Stagg Field, which was by then no longer used for football. The first man-made self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction occurred on December 2, 1942.\n\nThe first Stagg Field was a stadium at the University of Chicago in Chicago. It was primarily used for college football games, and was the home field of the Maroons. Stagg Field originally opened in 1893 as Marshall Field, named after Marshall Field who donated land to the university to build the stadium. In 1913, the field was renamed Stagg Field after their famous coach Amos Alonzo Stagg. The final capacity, after several stadium expansions, was 50,000. The University of Chicago discontinued its football program after 1939 and left the Big Ten Conference in 1946. The stadium was demolished in 1957, and much of the stadium site was used as the site of Regenstein Library.\n\nIn addition to Maroons football, the stadium hosted other events. These include the 1893, 1898, 1913, 1923 and 1933 USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships, a regional qualifying meet for the US Olympic Trials for Track and Field held June 19–20, 1936 and the NCAA Men's Track and Field Championships in 1921, 1922, 1923, 1929, 1930, 1931, 1932, 1933, and 1936.\n\nNorthwestern also played a number of home games at Stagg Field. At the turn of the 20th century, Northwestern was unable to handle large crowds, so they hosted then-powerhouse Minnesota at Marshall Field for a 1901 game and a 1904 game. In 1925 (a year prior to the opening of Dyche Stadium) Northwestern again was unable to accommodate large crowds, and as a result played two games at Stagg Field. The first was a notable win over Michigan. The second was an October 24 game against Tulane that had originally been scheduled to be played at Soldier Field instead. Tulane won the game at Stagg Field 18-7.\n\nThe University of Michigan fight song \"The Victors\" was written by Michigan music student Louis Elbel in 1898, following a last minute 12-11 Michigan victory over the University of Chicago at Stagg Field for the Western Conference championship.\n\nThe current Stagg Field is an athletic field located several blocks to the northwest that preserves the Stagg Field name, as well as a relocated gate from the original facility. The school's current Division III football team uses the new field as their home. It is also home to the Chicago Maroons soccer, softball and outdoor track teams. Stagg Field has a seating capacity of 1,650, and the playing surface is made of FieldTurf.\n\n\n"}

Many of her works were written for young readers. She was the chairperson of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles. Her pen name Bing Xin (literally \"Ice Heart\") carries the meaning of a morally pure heart, and is taken from a line in a Tang Dynasty poem by Wang Changling.\n\nBing Xin was born in Fuzhou, Fujian, but moved to Shanghai with her family when she was seven months old, and later moved yet again to the coastal port city of Yantai, Shandong, when she was four. Such a move had a crucial influence on Bing Xin's personality and philosophy of love and beauty, as the vastness and beauty of the sea greatly expanded and refined young Bing Xin's mind and heart. It was also in Yantai Bing Xin first began to read the classics of Chinese literature, such as \"Romance of the Three Kingdoms\" and \"Water Margin\", when she was just seven.\n\nIn 1913, Bing Xin moved to Beijing. The May Fourth Movement in 1919 inspired and elevated Bing Xin's patriotism to new high levels, starting her writing career as she wrote for a school newspaper at Yanjing University where she was enrolled as a student and published her first novel. While at Yanjing in 1921, Bing Xin was baptized a Christian, but was throughout her life generally indifferent to Christian rituals.\n\nBing Xin graduated from Yanjing University in 1923 with a bachelor's degree, and went to the United States to study at Wellesley College, earning a master's degree at Wellesley in literature in 1926. She then returned to Yanjing University to teach until 1936.\n\nIn 1929, she married Wu Wenzao, an anthropologist and her good friend when they were studying in the United States. Together, Bing Xin and her husband visited different intellectual circles around the world, communicating with other intellectuals such as Virginia Woolf.\n\nIn 1940, Bing Xin was elected a member of the National Senate.\n\nLater in her life, Bing Xin taught in Japan for a short period and stimulated more cultural communications between China and the other parts of the world as a traveling Chinese writer. In literature, Bing Xin founded the \"Bing Xin Style\" as a new literary style.

{"id": "1878871", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1878871", "title": "Korean independence movement", "text": "Korean independence movement\n\nThe Korean independence movement was a military and diplomatic campaign to achieve the independence of Korea from Japan. After the Japanese annexation of Korea in 1910, Korea's domestic resistance peaked in the March 1st Movement, which was crushed and sent Korean leaders to flee into China. In China, Korean independence activists built ties with the National Government of the Republic of China which supported the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea (KPG), as a government in exile. At the same time, the Korean Liberation Army, which operated under the Chinese National Military Council and then the KPG, led attacks against Japan.\n\nAfter the outbreak of the Pacific War, China became one of the Allies of World War II. In the Second Sino-Japanese War, China attempted to use this influence to assert Allied recognition of the KPG. However, the United States was skeptical of Korean unity and readiness for independence, preferring an international trusteeship-like solution for the Korean Peninsula. Although China achieved agreement by the Allies on eventual Korean independence in the Cairo Declaration of 1943, continued disagreement and ambiguity about the postwar Korean government lasted until the Soviet–Japanese War created a \"de facto\" division of Korea into Soviet and American zones, prompting the Korean War.\n\nThe date of the Surrender of Japan is an annual holiday called \"Gwangbokjeol\" (\"Restoration of Light Day\") in South Korea, and \"Chogukhaebangŭi nal\" (\"Fatherland Liberation Day\") in North Korea.\n\nThe last independent Korean monarchy, the Joseon dynasty, lasted over 500 years (1392–1910), both as the Joseon Kingdom and later as the Empire of Korea. Its international status and policies were conducted primarily through careful diplomacy with the power \"en vogue\" in China (during this period of time dynastic control of China saw the end of the Yuan dynasty and the rise and fall of both the Ming dynasty and the Qing dynasty), though other interactions with other international entities were not absent. Through this maneuvering and a dedicated adherence to strict Neo-Confucianist foreign and domestic policies, Joseon Korea retained control over its internal affairs and relative international autonomy though technically a suzerain of the ruling Chinese dynasties for most of this period. These policies were effective in maintaining Korea's relative independence and domestic autonomy in spite of a number of regional upheavals and a number of invasions (including the Japanese invasions of Korea from 1592–98 as well as the First and Second Manchu invasions of Korea).\n\nHowever, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, with the rise of Western imperialism boosted by the Industrial Revolution and other major international trends, the weakening of China also made Korea vulnerable to foreign maneuvering and encroachment, both as a target in and of itself and as a stepping-stone to the \"larger prize\" of China. This period (roughly from 1870 until annexation by Japan in 1910) was marked in Korea by major upheavals, many intrigues, the inability of Joseon Korea and the later Empire of Korea to right itself amidst all of the maneuvering around it by larger powers (including, but not limited to, Imperial Russia, Japan, China, and to a lesser extent France, Great Britain, and the United States), revolts/insurrections, and other indicators of a turbulent time. By the end of the First Sino-Japanese War in 1895 it was evident internationally that China could no longer protect its international interests, much less its own, against its opponents, and that its attempts to modernize its military and institutions were unsuccessful.\n\nAmong other things, the Treaty of Shimonoseki that ended this war stipulated that China would relinquish suzerainty and influence over Korea, recognize Korea's full independence and autonomy, and end the tribute system which had linked China and Korea for many centuries. In practical reality, this stipulation implied the handover of primary foreign influence in Korea from China to Japan, as Japanese forces had taken positions in the Korean Peninsula during the course of the war. This paved the way for Imperial Japan to tighten its influence on Korea without official Chinese intervention. In 1905, the Eulsa Treaty made the Empire of Korea (Korean imperial status had been established in 1897 to put King Gojong on equal legal footing with his neighboring sovereigns and to fully sever Korea's superficial ties of suzerainty to China) a protectorate of Japan; in 1907, the Japan–Korea Treaty of 1907 stipulated that Korea's policies would be enacted and enforced under the guidance of the Japanese resident general; and in 1910, through the Japan–Korea Annexation Treaty, Japan officially declared its annexation of Korea, a move for which Japan had been preparing for an extended period of time. All of these treaties were procured under duress, and though under duress, Emperor Sunjong of Korea refused to sign any of them and considered them illegal and not binding (though he had no real power to oppose its enactment and enforcement).\n\nNotably, both the 1905 treaty (and by extension the 1907 treaty) and the 1910 annexation treaty were declared \"already null and void\" when the normalization of relations between the Republic of Korea and Japan was negotiated in 1965.\n\nThe Japanese rule that ensued was oppressive to a far-reaching degree, giving rise to many Korean resistance movements. By 1919 these became nationwide, marked by what became known as the March 1st Movement.\n\nJapanese rule was oppressive but changed over time. Initially, there was very harsh repression in the decade following annexation. Japan's rule was markedly different than in its other colony, Formosa. This period is called \"amhukki\", the dark period by Koreans. Tens of thousands of Koreans were arrested for political reasons. The harshness of Japanese rule increased support for the Korean independence movement. Many Koreans left the Korean Peninsula, some of whom formed resistance groups and societies in Manchuria to fight for Korean independence. Koreans also carried out armed struggles against the Japanese. In the 1920s, Korean independence army units engaged in resistance activities in Manchuria and the Maritime Provinces of Siberia. Some went to Japan, where groups agitated clandestinely. There was a prominent group of Korean Communists in Japan, who were in danger for their political activities.\n\nPartly due to Korean opposition to colonial policies, this was followed by a relaxation of some harsh policies. The Korean crown prince married the Japanese princess Nashimoto. The ban on Korean newspapers was lifted, allowing publication of \"Choson Ilbo\" and \"The Dong-a Ilbo\". Korean government workers received the same wages as Japanese officials, though the Japanese officials received bonuses the Koreans did not. Whippings were eliminated for minor offenses but not for others. Laws interfering with burial, slaughtering of animals, peasant markets, or traditional customs were removed or changed.\n\nAfter the Peace Preservation Law of 1925, some freedoms were restricted. Then, in the lead up to the invasion of China and World War II, the harshness of Japanese rule increased again.\n\nAlthough the Empire of Japan had invaded and occupied northeast China from 1931, the Nationalist Government of China tried to avoid declaring war against Japan until the Empire directly attacked Beijing in 1937, sparking the Second Sino-Japanese War. After the United States declared war on Japan in 1941, China became an Ally of World War II, and tried to exercise its influence within the group to support Asian anticolonialist nationalism, which included the demand of the complete surrender of Japan and immediate independence of Korea afterwards.\n\nChina tried to promote the legitimacy of the Provisional Government of Korea (KPG), which was established by Koreans in China after the suppression of the March 1st Movement in Korea. The KPG was ideologically aligned with the Chinese government of the time, as independence leader Kim Gu had agreed to Chiang Kai-shek's suggestion to adopt the Chinese Three Principles of the People program in exchange for financial aid. At the same time, China supported the leftist independence leader Kim Won-bong and convinced the two Kims to form the unified Korean Liberation Army (KLA). Under the terms in which the KLA was allowed to operate in China, it became an auxiliary of China's National Revolutionary Army until 1945. China's National Military Council had also decided that \"complete independence\" for Korea was China's fundamental Korean policy; otherwise, the government in Chongqing tried to unify the warring Korean factions.\n\nAlthough Chiang and Korean leaders like Syngman Rhee tried to influence the US State Department to support Korean independence and recognize the KPG, the Far Eastern Division was skeptical. Its argument was that the Korean people \"were emasculated politically\" after decades of Japanese rule, and showed too much disunity, preferring a condominium solution for Korea that involved the Soviets. China was adamantly opposed to Soviet influence in Korea after hearing about Soviet atrocities in Poland since its \"liberation\". By the Cairo Conference, the US and China came to agree on Korean independence \"in due course\", with China still pressing for immediate recognition of the exile government and a tangible date for independence. After Soviet-American relations deteriorated, on August 10, 1945 the United States Department of War agreed that China should land troops in Pusan, Korea from which to prevent a Soviet takeover. However, this turnaround was too late to prevent the division of Korea, as the Red Army quickly occupied northern Korea that same month.\n\nAlthough there were many separate movements against colonial rule, the main ideology or purpose of the movement was to free Korea from the Japanese military and political rule. Koreans were concerned with alien domination and Korea’s state as a colony. They desired to restore Korea's independent political sovereignty after Japan invaded the weakened and partially modernized Korean Empire. This was the result of Japan's political maneuvers to secure international approval for the annexation of treaty annexing Korea.\nDuring the independence movement, the rest of the world viewed Korea's resistance movement as a racial anti-imperialist, anti-militarist rebellion, and an anti-Japanese resistance movement. Koreans, however, saw the movement as a step to free Korea from the Japanese military rule.\n\nThe South Korean government has been criticized as recently as 2011 for not accepting Korean socialists who fought for Korean independence.\n\nThere was no main strategy or tactic that was prevalent throughout the resistance movement, but there were prominent stages where certain tactics or strategies were prominent.\n\nFrom 1905 to 1910, most of the movement’s activities were closed off to the elite class or rare scholar. During this time, militaristic and violent attempts were taken to resist the Japanese including assassination. Most of the attempts were disorganized, scattered, and leaderless to prevent arrests and surveillance by Japan.\n\nFrom 1910 to 1919, was a time of education during the colonial era. Many Korean textbooks on grammar and spelling were circulated in schools. It started the trend of intellectual resistance to the Japanese rule. This period, along with Woodrow Wilson’s progressive principles, created an aware, nationalist, and eager student population. After the March 1st movement of 1919, strikes became prominent in the movement. Up to 1945, universities were used as a haven and source of students who further supported the movement. This support system led to the improvement of school facilities. From 1911 to 1937, Korea was dealing with economic problems (with the rest of the world, going through the Great Depression after World War I). There were many labor complaints that contributed to the grievances against Japan’s colonial rule. During this period, there were 159,061 disputes with workers concerned with wages and 1018 disputes involving 68,686 farmers in a tenant position. In 1926 the disputes started to increase at a fast pace and movements concerning labor emerged more within the Independence Movement.\n\nThere were broadly three kinds of national liberation groups: (a) the Christian groups which grew out of missionary efforts led by Western missionaries primarily from the United States prior to the Japanese occupation; (b) the former military and the irregular army groups; and (c) business and intellectual expatriates who formed the theoretical and political framework abroad.\n\nKoreans brought Catholicism to Korea towards the end of the 18th century and faced intense persecution. Methodist and Presbyterian missionaries followed in the 19th century starting off a renaissance with more liberal thoughts on issues of equality and woman's rights, which the strict Confucian tradition would not permit.\n\nThe early Korean Christian missionaries both led the Korean independence from 1890 through 1907, and later the creation of a Korean liberation movement from 1907 to 1945. Korean Christians suffered martyrdoms, crucifixions, burnings to death, police interrogations and massacres by the Japanese.\n\nAmongst the major religious nationalist groups were:\n\n\nand in World War II.\nSupporters of these groups included French, Czech, Chinese and Russian arms merchants, as well as Chinese nationalist movements.\n\nExpatriate liberation groups were active in Shanghai, northeast China, parts of Russia, Hawaii, San Francisco, and Los Angeles. Groups were even organised in areas without many expatriate Koreans, such as the one established in 1906 in Colorado by Park Hee Byung. The culmination of expatriate success was the Shanghai declaration of independence.\n\n\nSun Yat-sen was an early supporter of Korean struggles against Japanese invaders. By 1925, Korean expatriates began to cultivate two-pronged support in Shanghai: from Chiang Kai-Shek's Kuomintang, and from early communist supporters, who later branched into the Communist Party of China.\n\nLittle real support came through, but that which did developed long standing relationships that contributed to the dividing of Korea after 1949, and the polar positions between south and north.\n\nThe constant infighting within the Yi family, the nobles, the confiscation of royal assets, the disbanding of the royal army by the Japanese, the execution of seniors within Korea by Japan, and comprehensive assassinations of Korean royalty by Japanese mercenaries, led to great difficulties in royal descendants and their family groups in finding anything but a partial leadership within the liberation movement. A good many of the righteous army commanders were linked to the family but these generals and their righteous army groups were largely eliminated by 1918; and cadet members of the families contributed towards establishing both republics post-1945.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was stationed on the steam sloop , which transported John Elliott Ward, the American ambassador to various cities in China to settle American claims.\n\nWhen the Civil War broke out, the \"Hartford\" was ordered to return home. Greene, having been promoted to lieutenant on August 31, 1861, arrived in Philadelphia on December 2, 1861. After a short leave, he volunteered for duty on the \"Monitor\". Greene was appointed executive officer, serving under Commander Lieutenant John L. Worden during its historic four-hour battle at Hampton Roads, Virginia, with the Confederate ironclad warship on March 9, 1862. During the battle he assumed full command of \"Monitor\" when Worden was temporarily blinded by shell fragments from an explosion from one of \"Virginia\"s broadsides. After the subsequent retreat and assessment of all damage Greene ordered the return to battle and continued engaging the \"Virginia\" to a standoff. Greene continued to command the \"Monitor\" until Thomas O. Selfridge, Jr. took command on March 10, 1862.\n\nFrom April to May 1862 Greene continued to serve as executive officer on \"Monitor\" during the Battle of Drewry's Bluff on the James River, Virginia, and later provided naval support for General McClellan's forces on land along that river. Greene was aboard the ship when it foundered in a gale 20 miles off Cape Hatteras on December 31 – January 1, 1863, which Greene survived after being pulled into a lifeboat by the ship's surgeon, Dr. Grenville M.

It is officially named the Blecher-Freeman Memorial Causeway after two California Highway Patrol officers who were killed in the line of duty on the causeway.\n\nFerry service was usually required to cross the Yolo Bypass basin during seasonal flooding; the first county seat of Yolo County was the town of Fremont, built near the ferry crossing near the confluence of the Sacramento and Feather Rivers. Fremont was wiped out during the floods of 1851. As an alternative, settlers established the Yolo Plankroad, which was a long route that ended close to present-day Woodland, California.\n\nBefore a causeway was built, wheeled vehicles between Davis and Sacramento were forced to detour south through Tracy and Stockton during seasonal flooding. Once the ground was sufficiently dry to support vehicle traffic, the first vehicle to make it across the Yolo Bypass established the seasonal \"Tule Jake\" Road, which was typically passable only during the summer months.\n\nThe original Yolo Causeway opened on 18 March 1916 as a two-lane structure wide and long, connecting what is now the city of West Sacramento with Davis, California. Residents celebrated with the four day-long Causeway Celebration, held from May 11–14, 1916.\n\nInitially, the causeway was composed of a timber trestle section ( long, on the west) and a concrete trestle section (remaining length), with a plate girder bascule span, which was opened to permit passage of levee maintenance barges. The causeway width was doubled in 1933 when a new all-timber viaduct was added just south of the 1916 reinforced concrete structure; lights were added in 1950.\n\nThe Lincoln Highway association initially declined to shift its route to take advantage of the Yolo Causeway, but in 1928, following the completion of the Carquinez Bridge, it was made a part of the re-routed Lincoln Highway, the first road across America. Later, the causeway became a part of US Highways 40 and 99W.\n\nThe current causeway was built in 1962. From west to east, the causeway is composed of twinned long concrete trestles, a long earth fill segment, and twinned long concrete trestles. The easternmost of the two bridges is the longer of the two and traffic reporters will sometimes refer to the two structures as the \"long bridge\" and the \"short bridge\". Each trestle carries a wide, three-lane roadway.\n\nIt was renamed the \"Blecher-Freeman Memorial Causeway\" in 1994, after two California Highway Patrol officers who were shot to death in 1978 after a highway stop near the causeway.\n\nIn 2018, Caltrans announced plans to extend the carpool lane along I-80 from Solano County to Sacramento County, which includes plans to widen the causeway to four lanes in each direction. The proposed widening would not start until at least 2024, and the project is estimated to cost $800 million. One proposed alternative would use the extra lane as a toll lane.\n\nThe Yolo Bypass protects Sacramento and other California Central Valley communities from flooding. During wet seasons, it can be full of water. It contains the Vic Fazio Yolo Wildlife Area, the largest ecological restoration project west of the Everglades. Other nature preserves in it include the Fremont Weir Wildlife Area and Yolo Bypass Wildlife Area.\n\nThe Yolo Bypass begins at the Fremont Weir Wildlife Area, located approximately northwest of Sacramento and lying south of the Sacramento River, upstream from its confluence with the Feather River. When seasonal rains cause the river to rise, water is diverted via the concrete Fremont Weir into the Yolo Bypass floodplain. The Yolo Bypass can carry up to five times the capacity of the Sacramento River, preventing it from flooding Sacramento. The diverted water re-enters the Sacramento River delta near Rio Vista. A 2002 study showed that water begins to flow from the Sacramento into the Fremont Weir when the flow reaches approximately ; for comparison, the capacity of the Yolo Bypass is .\nApproximately 250,000 Mexican free-tailed bats migrate to the Yolo Causeway every June. They roost in the expansion joints between the causeway segments, and feed on the insects that live in the wetlands formed by the Yolo Bypass.\n\nThe Causeway Classic is named after the causeway, and refers to the annual college football game between the Aggies of the University of California, Davis and the Hornets of California State University, Sacramento.\n\n\n"}

The Westin Dawn Beach in Sint Maarten is currently not in operation due to damage from Hurricane Irma; however, the adjacent timeshare buildings have been repaired and re-opened in December 2018.\n\nAt its peak in 2007, Columbia Sussex owned 86 hotels with 32,604 rooms and 13 casinos. The majority of the portfolio was lost during the great recession between 2008 and 2012.\n\nIncluded in the rooms lost by Columbia Sussex are 5,821 rooms (or 14 hotels) that were acquired by Blackstone after it bought out $300 million in debt on the 14 properties at a steep discount. Although Columbia Sussex made every payment required by the terms of the loan, Blackstone seized the portfolio via a \"deed in lieu of foreclosure\" in December 2010 after the loan securing the portfolio had hit maturity and Columbia Sussex was unable to re-finance due to the credit crisis.

The hotel was closed for renovations and re-opened as a Ramada Inn.\n\nColumbia Sussex then began a campaign of acquiring Holiday Inns and renovating them into properties featuring the Holidome concept. Together with the new loyalty program, Priority Club, which was a trailblazing concept at the time, market success followed. Holiday Inns were acquired in Dayton, OH, Springfield, OH, and a group of 4 Holiday Inns in Charleston, WV.\n\nIn 1980 Columbia Sussex completed their largest acquisition to date with the purchase of the 400 room Holiday Inn in Southfield, MI.\n\nIn the early 1980s Columbia Sussex continued to grow mainly through acquisition while focusing primarily on the Holiday Inn brand.\n\nIn 1983 a 400-room Holiday Inn was purchased and renovated in Louisville, Kentucky.\n\nIn 1984 Columbia Sussex began expanding through construction of new hotels. Major projects included a Holiday Inn Rochester, NY which served as the company's flagship for a few years. Also constructed in 1984 was a 400-room motel in Kissimmee, FL which carried the Best Western Flag. This was the last exterior corridor property ever constructed by the company. Columbia Sussex also opened the newly constructed Hilton Louisville East and purchased the Plymouth, MI Hilton.\n\nIn 1985 Columbia Sussex purchased 3 Holiday Inns in the Chicago Area in Glen Ellyn, Itasca and Hillside. 1985 marked the end of the Holiday Inn focus for the company and the beginning of the Radisson Era.\n\nColumbia Sussex became the first franchisee of Radisson hotels with the purchase, renovation and re-branding of the Americana Hotel at the Cincinnati Airport located in Northern, KY.

The hotel opened in summer of 2014.\n\nColumbia Sussex entered the gaming industry in 1990, purchasing the High Sierra hotel in Stateline, Nevada from Del Webb Corporation for $19 million. The property was renamed as the Horizon Casino Resort.\n\nThe Lighthouse Point Casino in Greenville, Mississippi was opened in November 1996. Columbia owned the riverboat casino and a 79% stake in its operating company.\n\nIn March 2002, JMBS Casino, a Columbia Sussex affiliate controlled by William Yung's children, bought Bayou Caddy's Jubilee Casino, a riverboat in Greenville, for $42 million.\n\nIn 2002, Columbia bought the closed Maxim Hotel and Casino near the Las Vegas Strip for $38 million. After a $90 million renovation, the property was reopened in 2003 as the Westin Casuarina, using the name of Columbia's resort in the Cayman Islands.\n\nIn 2004, Columbia bought the River Palms in Laughlin, Nevada and the Harrah's Vicksburg casino in Vicksburg, Mississippi, which it renamed to the Horizon Vicksburg.\n\nIn October 2004, Columbia agreed to buy the President Casino St. Louis from bankrupt President Casinos for $57 million. The company planned a $150 million residential and retail development around the casino, even though some of the land was already earmarked for Pinnacle Entertainment's Lumière Place project. The sale collapsed a year later, however, when Columbia withdrew its application for a gaming license. According to a lawsuit filed by President, the Missouri Gaming Commission was set to reject the application for \"flimsy\" reasons, including an IRS audit of Yung's 2000 income tax return and his use of a corporate credit card for personal expenses. President eventually won a judgment of $28 million plus $14 million in interest, for breach of contract and for unreasonable fee increases at the casino parking lot, which Columbia had already purchased.\n\nIn 2005, Columbia bought the Bally's New Orleans casino from Caesars Entertainment for $24 million. Caesars needed to sell the casino to avoid antitrust concerns in its acquisition by Harrah's Entertainment, owner and operator of Harrah's New Orleans. It was later renamed as the Amelia Belle.\n\nThe same year, Columbia bought Caesars Tahoe in Stateline from Caesars Entertainment for $45 million, and renamed it as the MontBleu.\n\nColumbia bought the Argosy Casino riverboat in Baton Rouge, Louisiana from Penn National Gaming in October 2005 for $150 million and renamed it as the Belle of Baton Rouge. The sale assuaged FTC antitrust concerns about Penn's acquisition of Argosy Gaming, which would have resulted in the company owning the only two casinos in the city.\n\nThe company made a second attempt to enter the St. Louis market in May 2006, agreeing to pay $200 million for the Casino Queen riverboat in East St. Louis, Illinois, across the river from the President Casino. However, after ordering Casino Queen the following January to remove a minority shareholder with ties to an organized crime associate, the Illinois Gaming Board did not approve the sale by the February deadline set in the contract, and Columbia ended the deal in March.\n\nIn December 2006, Columbia opened a 317-room $150 million Westin resort with a casino on the Caribbean island of Sint Maarten.\n\nIn January 2007, Columbia acquired Aztar for $2.1 billion, after winning a bidding war against Ameristar Casinos and Pinnacle Entertainment. Aztar owned five casinos: the Tropicana Las Vegas, Tropicana Casino & Resort Atlantic City, Ramada Express in Laughlin, Casino Aztar in Evansville, Indiana and Casino Aztar in Caruthersville, Missouri. A new subsidiary, Tropicana Entertainment LLC, was created to hold Columbia's and Aztar's casinos.\n\nColumbia Sussex did not want to make another try for a Missouri gaming license, so Aztar agreed before the acquisition to sell the Caruthersville casino to Fortunes Entertainment, the company of Argosy Gaming co-founder Lance Callis. The deal fell through because the licensing process for Fortunes could not be completed on schedule, so to avoid closing the casino, Aztar allowed the Gaming Commission to appoint a supervisor to operate it, effective when the merger closed. Casino Aztar was finally sold in June 2007 for $45 million to Isle of Capri, which renamed it as Lady Luck Casino.\n\nAt the time of the Aztar acquisition, the Tropicana Atlantic City was placed in a trust pending Yung's licensing by the New Jersey Casino Control Commission. Yung's license was denied in December 2007 due in part to complaints about the Tropicana's maintenance and sanitation after Yung laid off 1,300 staffers. The commission declared that the company displayed a \"lack of business ability, a lack of financial responsibility, and a lack of good character, honesty and integrity,\" and a \"defiance of the regulatory process.\" Former New Jersey Supreme Court Justice Gary Stein was appointed as trustee and conservator of the property, with a mandate to find a new buyer.\n\nThe loss of the Atlantic City property led Tropicana to default on its bank debt. Yung tried to sell the Vicksburg and Evansville casinos to raise cash to appease creditors, but it was not enough to prevent a lawsuit by bondholders. The Delaware Court of Chancery ruled in February 2008 that the transfer of the property to Stein constituted a technical default on the bonds. Stein asked to transfer the title back to Tropicana to cure the default, but the Commission roundly rejected the request. With no other options remaining, Tropicana Entertainment filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in May.\n\nDebtholders viewed Yung's presence as a \"distraction\" and asked a court to appoint a trustee to run the company. Yung settled the dispute by agreeing in July to step down, leaving the other four board members in place.\n\nIn May 2009, Tropicana, seeking to focus its Tahoe-area efforts on the MontBleu, transferred the Horizon Casino to a Columbia Sussex affiliate. Table games at the casino were eliminated, with a possible downsizing of slots also planned.\n\nThe Tropicana Las Vegas, which had a $440 million secured loan against it, emerged from bankruptcy in July 2009 as a separate company led by Canadian private equity firm Onex and former MGM Mirage president Alex Yemenidjian. The remainder of the company emerged on March 8, 2010 as Tropicana Entertainment, led by Carl Icahn.\n\nThe Amelia Belle, which was not included in the bankruptcy, was sold in October 2009 to Peninsula Gaming, owner of the Evangeline Downs racetrack, for $107 million.\n\nThe Westin Casuarina Las Vegas, which also was not included in the bankruptcy, defaulted on its mortgage in April 2010, and lenders, led by CW Financial Services, filed for foreclosure the following November. The hotel's general manager said in October 2011 that Columbia Sussex would not fight the foreclosure.\n\n\n\n"}

It was a forerunner of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. The company produced its films in New York, Los Angeles, and sometimes at leased facilities in Fort Lee, New Jersey. It was purchased in 1919.\n\nMetro Pictures was founded as a film distribution company in February 1915 by a number of \"exchange men\" with Richard A. Rowland as president, George Grombacker as vice-president and Louis B. Mayer as secretary. Grombacker owned exchanges in Portland and Seattle. Rowland and Metro's 2nd vice president James B. Clark were from the Roland & Clark company based in Pittsburgh. Metro was capitalized with $300,000 in cash and founded for the purpose of controlling movie productions for the exchanges. Rowland had been an investor in Alco Films which was a distribution company for a coalition of production companies. Mayer convinced Rowland to set up Metro to replace Alco to avoid being picked up by Paramount, Mutual Film, or Universal. Metro had Rolfe Photoplays, Inc. and Popular Plays and Players moving over from Alco to Metro. Additional production companies working with Metro were Columbia (1915–1917 [not the current Columbia], subsequently CBC Sales until 1918), Quality Picture Corporation, and Dyreda.\n\nIn 1915, Metro established its back lot in Hollywood on N. Cahuenga Boulevard between Willoughby Avenue and Waring Avenue bound by Lillian Way on the east (today home to Red Studios Hollywood.) Metro's first release on March 29, 1915 was \"Satan Sanderson\", a film produced by Rolfe Photoplays which was originally to be distributed by Alco Film Company. \"Sealed Valley\" was Metro's first production released on August 2, 1915. Mayer left to form his own production unit in 1918.\n\nIn 1919, the company was purchased by Marcus Loew as a supplier of product for his theater chain. However, Loew was not satisfied with the amount or quality of Metro's output. A few years later in 1924, Loew merged it with his recently acquired Goldwyn Pictures and shortly Louis B. Mayer Productions then renamed the new entity Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer that year with Mayer in charge.\n\nMetro's biggest stars during the World War I period were the romantic teams of Francis X. Bushman and Beverly Bayne and Harold Lockwood and May Allison. Also in top echelons of importance were actresses Mae Murray and Viola Dana and from the stage Lionel and Ethel Barrymore, Emmy Wehlen and Emily Stevens. Before merging into MGM in 1924, Metro's star roster had expanded to include Lillian Gish, Buster Keaton, Jackie Coogan, Marion Davies, Ramon Novarro, Wallace Beery and Lewis Stone.\n\nAlthough the Metro film library and stars were merged into MGM in 1924, a portion of Rowland's Los Angeles film studio continued with a life of its own. Originally spanning four city blocks, one block continued as a studio known simply as Motion Picture Studios through the 1940s, and as General Service Studios and Desilu Studios through the 1950s and 1960s. It became Ren-Mar Studios in 1974. In January 2010, Ren-Mar Studios was bought by Red Digital Cinema Camera Company. The complex was renamed \"Red Studios Hollywood\". It is located on Cahuenga Blvd. north of Melrose Avenue in Hollywood, directly behind the Musicians AFM Local 47 on Vine Street.\n\nDavid E. Kelley filmed several of his TV series there, including \"Picket Fences\", \"Ally McBeal\", and \"The Practice\".\n\nA 1965 fire in an MGM Archive #7 storage facility destroyed original negatives and prints, including the best-quality copies of every Metro picture and Louis B. Mayer Picture produced prior to 1924; over half of MGM's feature films from before 1930 are completely lost. On March 25, 1986, Ted Turner and his Turner Broadcasting System purchased pre-May 1986 MGM films (including Metro Pictures films) from Kirk Kerkorian for $600 million.\n\n\n"}

Located in the Bitterroot Range near the Idaho border along the route of the Mullan Road, it was a thriving railroad town c. 1908, named after William H. Taft (before he was elected president in 1908). It is said in both “Up the Swiftwater” by Sandra A. Crowell and David O. Asleson, and in “The Big Burn” by Timothy Egan, that the unnamed work camp got its namesake after Taft, then Secretary of War, traveling on the new Northern Pacific train, berated the town as a blight on the American landscape which must clean up its act, to a cheering drunken crowd. The town was then enthusiastically named in his honor.\n\nThe town was founded when the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad (\"The Milwaukee Road\") built its Pacific Coast expansion and had to bore a tunnel through the mountains near its site. Tunnel #20 on the railroad, it is known as St. Paul Pass Tunnel or Taft Tunnel; its East Portal is southwest at approximately above sea level and heads southwest into Idaho. In its earliest years the town of mostly men working for the railroad, mining or forest industries was notorious for drinking, gambling, a murder rate higher than Chicago, and a reputed \"five prostitutes for every man.\" One reporter described it as \"the wickedest city in America.\" \n\nTaft burned to the ground on 20 August 1910, during \"The Big Burn\" - a giant forest wildfire fed by Palouser winds. It was not rebuilt. (see \"The Big Burn\" by Timothy Egan. Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing, 2009.)\n\nToday, on Interstate 90, the site is noted by exit 5, marked \"Taft.\" The area hosts a maintenance yard for the Montana Department of Transportation, access to the \"Route of the Hiawatha\" rail trail, and access to St. Regis (Sohon) / Mullan Pass vía Randolph Creek Road, which heads north and west from I-90.\n\n"}

{"id": "1878915", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1878915", "title": "Siku Toys", "text": "Siku Toys\n\nSIKU is the range of toy vehicles and related products produced by the German company Sieper Lüdenscheid GmbH & Co. KG in Lüdenscheid, Germany. The company manufactures many vehicles, but the Super Series 1:55 scale die-cast line is the core product, thus Siku historically could be seen as the \"German Matchbox\". The company also owns the well known HO scale producer Wiking-Modellbau.\n\nSieper-Werke (The Sieper company) was founded in 1921 (Wagner 2002–2007). It was originally a manufacturer of metal tools and cutlery in zamac and aluminum and, later on, ashtrays, badges, medals, belt buckles, and buttons (Wagner 2002–2007). The factory in Ludenscheid was outfitted with new casting molds in 1949 for grating, sandblasting and painting zinc cast goods. The company was even contracted to make Mercedes-Benz's star-shaped hood ornament (Natrop 1998–2002).\n\nThe company also experimented with early plastics. In 1943 the company expanded to a facility in Hilchenbach, about 30 miles from Lüdenscheid, though the latter has always been Sieper-Werke's headquarters. Still, consumer products like plastics, furniture, mirrors and cabinets have been developed and manufactured in Hilchenbach. Lüdenscheid, in turn, generally focused on promotional items for major brands, such as the 'elephant shoe' and 'Zeller black cat' which were produced by injection molding.\n\nIt was not until 1950 that the company started producing toys in Lüdenscheid, registering the trademark SIKU for the new products. SIKU originates from abbreviating the name of the founder of the company, Richard Sieper, and the German word for \"plastic\", Kunststoffe (e.g. Sieper Plastics). Originally, there was a broad variety of SIKU toys which at first were plastic, including figures and animals. These were often called 'margarine figures' because they came in margarine packages as a food promotion (Natrop 1998–2002). The success of the plastic figures gave capital to start a post-war vehicle line.\n\nBetween 1951 and 1955, the first vehicles were generic representations of a fire truck, a race car, an amphibious truck, a moving van, and finally, in 1955, a Porsche 356 (Natrop 1998–2002; Wagner, 2002–2007). The scale chosen was approximately 1:60. By 1958, SIKU had dropped figures to focus exclusively on the plastic vehicles, except where animals attended tractors and such.\n\nIn 1955, the first dedicated line of vehicles, the V-Series ('V' for 'Verkehrs'modelle or Traffic Models), was produced. These were replicas of actual vehicles in a uniform 1/60th scale. Colors were often dull and rather pastel. Vehicles were well-proportioned and detailed, like the Magirus fire truck with a whole series of ladders, a very detailed electric street car, or some figures like the drivers in the Mercedes 190, Porsche 550 Spyder, or Karmann Ghia convertibles (Natrop 1998–2002; Natrop No date A). One particularly sharply detailed model was V228 all plastic Willys Jeep with trailer which featured a detailed driver and folding windshield.\n\nMost vehicles did not have interiors, with the exception of convertibles or the double decker bus. Some of the Mercedes-Benzes even had hood ornaments! (Natrop 1998–2002). Several American cars were also offered in plastic. A 1956 Buick Century, a 1957 Mercury Voyager station wagon and a 1960 Chrysler New Yorker were among the creative selections (Natrop No date A).\n\nThen in 1963, 12 new models produced in zinc alloy were introduced, and these were spray painted by hand (Wagner 2003–2009). Between 1963 and 1969, new releases were made in both plastic and metal, but there was a gradual shift to metal with fewer plastic models. The last plastic model was issued in 1969, and since that time all new models have been die-cast zamac.\n\nMost V-series vehicles came packaged in cardboard boxes with vehicles illustrated on opposite panels. Different colors were also shown on the opposite panels; some boxes being blue, red, some green and yellow. The style was somewhat reminiscent of early Solido boxes. This packaging was used until rather late, and seemed rather rustic compared to other companies' use of modern clear display blister cards which had become dominant by this time. Even most Matchbox Toys were now abandoning their Match\"boxes\". On the boxes, in German, was written \"Siku-Flitzer\" (or, \"Siku-Streaker\"). For some time on the boxes, illustrations of the vehicles were bathed in a yellow light from the round sun-like Siku logo. Other V-series boxes had orange and cream or green and yellow panels. In 1973, the letter V was removed from the numbering system. Similar to Corgi or Dinky, Sikus also used rhinestones for headlights which were sparkly and attractive but not very realistic (Ragan 2000, p. 36–37).\n\nOne notable example was a Ford F-500 flat bed truck made in the mid-1960s. Proportions were realistic and colors were authentic looking. The grille was also authentically detailed with jeweled headlights. Wheels were done in a utilitarian black, detailed, but with no chrome. Rear wheels were 'duallies'. One model offered a dark green body, brown interior, and a red metal chassis. It was a heavy model of a heavy duty real truck (Ragan 2000, p. 36).\n\nThe V Series came to an end in 1975, when the Super Series was introduced.\n\nThe Super Series replaced the V series becoming the principal model range. Some V models were transferred to the Super Series and renumbered, but there were two differences between the new series and the old. First, the models were no longer spray painted by hand. Second, the new models were made in a slightly bigger scale of 1:55. Models were now numbered in a four digit system – the first two designating the price range. Small cars traditionally had numbers that start in 10 or 13, but later on 08 and 14 were added. Larger vehicles including helicopters have various price range designations from 16 up. The second two digits are the model numbers within each price range. This uniform numbering system has since been applied to all new product ranges as well as to gift sets.\n\nSmall cars were at first packaged in both picture boxes and blister packs. Boxes were dropped entirely by the mid-1980s. Large models were mostly packed in window boxes, with a few exceptions. One unfortunate design element in this time period was the unrealistic and rather gaudy white-walled tires labeled with 'Siku' on opposite sides of each tire and with and white 'spoked' wheels that appeared on most vehicles in this series. Fortunately, by the late 1990s, realistic wheel designs were adopted, like accurate mini mags for the Mini Cooper seen on this page. This series is still produced today, and since the incorporation of the Club Series (see below) in the early 1990s, large trucks as well as military tanks and a few aircraft have been made in the small car size and put in blister packages. Of course, their scale varied greatly too. Hence, a unified scale of 1:55 (or 1:60 for cars from the V series) is not uniformly applied.\nSiku keeps up with odd German sports cars selections like the Gumpert Apollo or the Wiesmann GT. Occasionally Siku outdoes itself with a very odd model. Sixteen inch tall cranes have been produced, helicopters on flat bed semi trucks, forestry log loaders, piston bully snow tracked vehicles, an ultra-detailed stake bed Mercedes Unimog, potato digger truck, triple engined competition pulling tractor and modern tram and subway cars. Perhaps the most outrageous is the AIDA Aluna 10-story plus cruise ship in 1:1,400 scale (18 cm long).\n\nSiku first built 20 plane models in scale 1:250 in 1959. Despite good sales the company was forced to stop producing this range in 1964 due to the lack of a sufficient work-force. In the early 1990s, aeroplane models of this size reappeared. They were boxed and were in the price range 19.de (Wagner 2002–2009).\n\nClub Series was introduced in 1990 and consisted of die-cast trucks and farm vehicles made in smaller scale (usually 1:87). These were similar to the Super Series in that the blister packages were the same size and shape as those of small cars. The only difference was that the packaging had a different design and read \"Siku Club.\" However, after the first few years of production, the Club line was fully incorporated into the Super Series and adopted the Super packaging design. A few 1:55 models from the Super Series in the 08 price range were also packaged in the \"Siku Club\" package for a short period of time in 1992, when production switched from Germany to China (The Club Series vehicles have always been produced in China since their beginning in 1990).\n\nIn 1983, the Farmer Series was introduced, mainly in 1:32 scale (Wagner 2002–2009). Oddly, there is a Land Rover in the series (used as a farm vehicle!). The Farmer Classic line was added in 2002, and focused on old-timer tractors. Subsequently, more detailed and refined farm vehicles have been introduced in these two series. For example, Classic models featured tractors with rustic looking 'aged' paint (Wagner 2002–2007). Post 2005, some of these realistic plastic vehicles, like a MAN refuse truck, were twelve inches long or more and, typical for the era, made in China, not Germany.\n\nIn 2004, a radio-controlled tractor was introduced in the all new radio controlled 'SIKU Control' line, which added play value in addition to the regular SIKU Farmer Series vehicles. These have working acceleration, steering, headlights and turn indicators. Other models have since been added to the Control line.\n\nThis range of classic old-timer fire engines in 1:50 scale was added in 2005 to complement the contemporary models in the Super Series. This was done following the success of the Farmer Classic line.\n\nThrough the 1980s, HO (1:87) scale manufacturers like Herpa, Busch, Trident, and Roco became ever more important in the European hobby market. In 1984, Sieper Werke moved to strengthen itself in this market with the purchase of Wiking-Modelbau, based in West Berlin and famous for HO scale plastic models.\n\nWith scale of the models becoming variable in the Super Series, Siku also released the M87 series in 2003. All of the models are faithfully reproduced in 1:87, though this line is independent of the Wiking line. The range of models is limited but consists of semi-trailers, cranes, farm tractors, and cars. The trucks, cranes, and farm tractors are very similar to those made in smaller size in the Super Series (i.e., those that have their roots in the Club Series). The difference is that the M87 series vehicles are more detailed and are packaged in small window boxes versus blister card.\nThis Siku Junior line was launched in 1998. It consists of larger, detailed plastic trucks, construction vehicles, tractors and other agricultural vehicles and trailers. Siku Juniors are designed somewhat along the lines of German Bruder. Though the line is aimed primarily at outdoor play, these models are handsome and realistic and durability is a main feature.\n\nThis lineup was launched in 2013. It consists of plastic building and street tiles to complement SIKU vehicles.\n\nWith its respected V series, Siku battled with French Majorette and Dutch Efsi for the European market, but became the diecast kings in the Matchbox size in Germany. Starting in the early 1970s, Siku started breaking into international markets with increasing success, and the company abandoned most other diecast products, focusing more now on vehicles (Natrop 1998–2002). \n\nWhile Sikus became well-known across Europe, the brand never became widely popular in the United States, only sometimes being found at specialty hobby shops. Appearances at large department stores like WalMart, Hills, or Target were rare. The American scarcity was despite offering American cars like the Buick Wildcat, Oldsmobile Toronado, Pontiac Bonneville convertible, Cadillac limosine, Pontiac GTO, Chevrolet Corvette, Lincoln Mark III, and Ford Mustang and Ford Trucks (Ragan 2000, 36; Natrop No date B). As of 2010 SIKU does not export toys to the United States due to conflicts with the CPSIA (The Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act) of 2008.\n\nThe V-Series and the Super Series have recently been highly sought among collectors. The manufacturing quality of the models is significantly higher than average, however, the price of individual models is higher as well. Today, new models still retain their quality similar to older Matchbox, Dinky and Corgi of decades past. For example, Siku wheels are more sculpted and detailed. Tires are separated from wheels and made of rubber, while other manufacturers make theirs in single cast plastic pieces.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1878916", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1878916", "title": "Gnome et Rhône", "text": "Gnome et Rhône\n\nGnome et Rhône was a major French aircraft engine manufacturer. Between 1914 and 1918 they produced 25,000 of their 9-cylinder Delta and Le Rhône 110 hp (81 kW) rotary designs, while another 75,000 were produced by various licensees. These engines powered the majority of aircraft in the first half of the war, both Allied designs as well as German examples produced by Motorenfabrik Oberursel.\n\nIn the post-war era they started a new design series originally based on the Bristol Jupiter, but evolving into the excellent 1,000 hp-class (750 kW) Gnome-Rhône 14K \"Mistral Major\" radial, which was likewise licensed and used around the world during World War II. They were a major supplier of engines to the German \"Luftwaffe\", producing both their own designs as well as German ones under licence. Their factories were the target of highly accurate bombing, knocking them out of the war.\n\nThe company was nationalized as a part of Snecma in 1949, but the brand lived on for a time as the manufacturer of Gnome et Rhône motorcycles and Gnome et Rhône bicycles.\n\nIn 1895 the 26-year-old French engineer Louis Seguin bought a license for the Gnom gas engine from the German firm Motorenfabrik Oberursel. Sold under the French translation, the Gnome was a single-cylinder stationary engine of about 4 hp (3 kW) that ran on kerosene (known in the UK and South Africa as paraffin) intended to be used in industrial applications. The Gnome used a unique valve system with only one rod-operated exhaust valve, and a \"hidden\" intake valve located on the cylinder head.\n\nOn 6 June 1905 Louis Seguin and his brother Laurent formed the Société Des Moteurs Gnome (the Gnome Motor Company) to produce automobile engines. They soon started development of one of the first purpose-designed aircraft engines, combining several Gnome cylinders into a rotary engine. The design emerged in the spring of 1909 as the 7-cylinder rotary Gnome Omega, delivering 50 hp (37 kW) from 75 kg. More than 1,700 of these engines would be built in France, along with license-built models in Germany, Sweden, Britain, the United States and Russia. The Gnome powered Henry Farman's Farman III aircraft to take the world records for distance and endurance, as well as powering the first aircraft to break 100 km/h, as well as the first seaplane ever to fly in 1910, powering France to become the leading country in aviation at the time. Léon Lemartin and Jules Védrines were two young engineers who participated in the design, development and implementation of the Omega, and in the milieu of the pioneering days of flight they both went on to become successful pilots.\n\nAll of the Gnomes were known for their unique solutions to getting fuel to the top of the piston without using piping. Early models used two valves, one in the cylinder head and a second embedded in the piston itself, counterweighted to open at the end of the stroke. Without any springs or pushrods, the valve would pop open on the downstroke, allowing fuel to be drawn into the cylinder from the crankcase area. Unfortunately it was also very difficult to service, requiring the cylinder to be disassembled. In order to improve reliability and maintenance, later models used the Monosoupape (\"single-valve\") system instead, using a single exhaust valve at the top of the cylinder and using a series of ports to allow the fuel mixture into the top of the cylinder when the piston had moved down in the cylinder past the ports.\n\nThe basic Gnome design was then delivered in a series of larger engines. The Gnome Lambda of 1911 was a larger 80 hp (60 kW) version of the Omega, followed by the 9-cylinder 100 hp (75 kW) Gnome Delta in 1914 (also called the Gnome Monosoupape as it used that type of engine design for the first time). Gnome also tried a 14-cylinder two-row version, the Double Lambda of 160 hp (120 kW), but this saw little use, even though it was copied by Oberursel as the U.III in Germany, and used in a few early Fokker fighter designs without success. To deliver more power with the advent of high-power inline engines late in the war, a completely new nine-cylinder Monosoupape design was delivered in 1918 as the Type-N, delivering 160 hp. This design saw use on the little-known but excellent Nieuport 28.\n\nAnother French engineer, Louis Verdet, designed his own small rotary engine in 1910 which did not see much use. In 1912 he delivered a larger 7-cylinder design, the 7C, which developed 70 hp from 90 kg. This proved much more popular and he formed Société des Moteurs Le Rhône later that year. He soon followed the 7C with the larger Le Rhône 9C, a nine-cylinder design delivering 80 hp (60 kW). Compared to the Gnome's, the Le Rhône was considerably more \"conventional\", using copper intake manifold pipes to bring the fuel to the top of each engine cylinder, along with intake and exhaust valves. Like Gnome, the Le Rhône designs were widely licensed, in this case the 110 hp Le Rhone 9J was produced in Germany by Oberursel as their Ur.II model as designated by \"IdFlieg\", and in the United States; the Union Switch & Signal Company of Swissvale, PA was reported to have produced some 10,000 units - it was also built in Austria, Britain and Sweden.\n\nAfter several years of fierce competition, Gnome and Le Rhône finally decided to merge. Negotiations started in 1914, and on 12 January 1915 Gnome bought out Le Rhône to form Société des Moteurs Gnome et Rhône. Developments of the 9C continued to be their primary product, improving in power to about 110 hp (80 kW) in the Le Rhône 9J by the end of the war. The 9-series was the primary engine for most early-war designs both in French and British service as well as in Germany where, perhaps somewhat ironically, Oberursel had taken out a license just before the war. Oberursel's engine based on the Gnome designs were prefixed with a U, while those based on the Le Rhône a Ur.\n\nWith the end of the war the company rapidly diversified, using their factories to produce chassis and engines for the Rolland-Pilain and Piccard-Pictet cars, along with Ansaldo diesel engines, refrigerators, sewing machines and even jackhammers. In 1920 they also introduced their first motorcycle, simply known as the Gnome et Rhône 500 cc. Various models were produced up to the early 1950s, typically advertised as simply \"Gnome Rhone\" with no accents.\n\nBy 1920 their rotary engines were no longer competitive, and they had no new designs of their own. In 1921 they took out a license for the Bristol Jupiter, which was in the process of becoming the Gnome of its era. In 1922, Paul-Louis Weiller, a World War I ace, took over the company and decided to focus it on aircraft engines once again. Their Jupiter designs, the 9A, were soon selling very well. In 1926 they took out a license for the smaller 5-cylinder Bristol Titan, while Bristol licensed the Farman-style reduction gearing used by Gnome.\n\nNot satisfied to simply produce Bristol designs under license, Gnome started a major design effort based around the mechanicals of the Titan. The results were introduced in 1927 as the K-series, spanning the 260 hp (190 kW) Gnome-Rhône 5K \"Titan\", the 7-cylinder 370 hp (270 kW) version, the Gnome-Rhône 7K \"Titan Major\", and the 9-cylinder 550 hp (405 kW) Gnome-Rhône 9K \"Mistral\". All of these engines were delivered in a variety of improved versions, named with a three letter code; the first letter was the series number (a through f for instance), the second a r or l depending on which direction the engine turned, and the third indicating the charging system. With the introduction of the K-series, Gnome ended royalty payments to Bristol. By 1930 they had delivered 6,000 Jupiters, Mistrals and Titans, making them the largest engine company in France.\n\nBut the 550 hp (405 kW) Mistral was no longer powerful enough for the rapidly evolving industry. To provide more power Gnome once again turned to the two-row solution, using two banks of 7 cylinders, delivering the 625 hp (460 kW) Gnome-Rhône 14K \"Mistral Major\" in 1929. The new engine was an instant hit. By 1933 the 14Kfrs had improved the power to 1,025 hp (750 kW) through better supercharging (along with similar improvements in the Mistral, now at 770 hp or 570 kW), and the engine was once again being licensed around the world.\n\nLeaving the idea of having many engines in a single \"K-series\", Gnome continued work with the basic mechanical design to produce the 18-cylinder two-row Gnome-Rhône 18L of 1400 hp (1030 kW). Its power-to-weight ratio was not very good and work on the design was eventually stopped in 1939. A smaller engine, the Gnome-Rhône 14M \"Mars\" was introduced to replace the earlier K-series Mistral, notable primarily for its extremely compact frontal area, giving by far the most power for \"size\" of any engine of the era. It was especially used in the Potez 631 aircraft family.\n\nIn 1936 the 14K-series was replaced by the Gnome-Rhône 14N delivering 1,100 hp (810 kW) from a slightly heavier engine that nevertheless had a much better power-to-weight ratio. Starting with the N they introduced a new naming scheme, replacing the earlier model letters with numbers, delivering the engine in versions that turned left with even numbers and right with odd. The original 14N-0/1 was run through a number of versions, the 14N-10/11 being used on the Bloch MB.210 bomber, the 14N-25 on early examples of the MB.152 fighter, and the 14N-49 on late MB.152s as well as LeO 451s and Amiot 351s. The N-series finally ended with the 14N-50/51, which delivered 1,210 hp (890 kW) for takeoff. The 14N was not as widely licensed, as the war was approaching and the French government was becoming increasingly wary of licensing designs to potential enemies.\n\nThe 14N-series was itself replaced by the ultimate pre-war evolution of the line, the Gnome-Rhône 14R. The first versions introduced in 1939, the 14R-4/5, produced 1,291 hp (950 kW) for takeoff and was only slightly heavier than the 14N. By 1940 the improved 14R-8/9 was delivering 1,578 hp (1,161 kW) by increasing RPM from 2,400 to 2,600. Although this was a good figure for the era, British and German design had already passed this mark, and would soon be pressing on 2,000 hp (1,500 kW).\n\nWith the fall of France in 1940, Gnome et Rhône was ordered to produce the BMW 801 under license, while the 14M and 14N saw limited use on some German designs, such as the Henschel Hs 129B, Gotha Go 244B, and Messerschmitt Me 323. The company became infamous for slow production, building only 8,500 engines by May 1944, when the Germans had been estimating 25,000. An air raid by 56 Lancasters and 8 Mosquitos of 5 Group of the RAF completely destroyed the original Gennevilliers factories on 9/10 May. Another air raid by Lancasters of 617 Squadron led by Wing Commander Leonard Cheshire had also severely damaged the Limoges factory on 8/9 February 1944.\n\nWith the end of the war, the company was in no condition to continue in the aero-engine business, although they picked up small contracts to produce M4 Sherman tanks for the French army. In order to save what was left the company was nationalized on 29 May 1945, creating the Société Nationale d'Etude et de Construction de Moteurs d'Aviation (SNECMA), and producing the 14N, 14R and the new 14U.\n\nThe 14K was one of the most popular engines of its era, widely licensed and used around the world. In Poland it was used for export fighter variants, most notable PZL P.24. In particular it was used in Romania, where it powered a number of Polish designed PZL fighters before finally becoming the main engine of the IAR 80 fighter. In Yugoslavia the 7K, 9K and 14N-0 were built by Industrija motora Rakovica.\n\nIsotta Fraschini and Piaggio of Italy both took out licenses, the former producing the K.14, the latter the P.XI. These were used on a number of designs in the pre-war period, many of which were exported. This led to Manfred Weiss taking out a license in Hungary, producing it as the WM K-14 in order to power their versions of the Reggiane Re.2000 fighter called the MAVAG Heja \"Hawk\", as well as the Weiss WM 21 Sólyom.\n\nThe British firm Alvis had licensed the 14K and 18L, but neither entered production before the war ended. Nevertheless, Alvis pressed ahead with development, releasing the 9-cylinder Alvis 501 \"Leonides\" and later the 14-cylinder Alvis 701 \"Leonides Major\". The latter saw some use on post-war helicopter designs.\n\nThe Soviet Union, through its Tumansky OKB design bureau, license-built the 14K (as the M-85), building nearly 500 examples.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom 1920 Gnome et Rhône diversified into the bicycle and motorcycle business producing some relatively successful and stylish products. They first organized the \"Société Française des Moteurs ABC\" in Paris in 1920, to build the Granville Bradshaw designed ABC motorcycle in 1920, which they produced until 1924. Bradshaw's original 400cc design was enlarged by Gnome et Rhone to 493cc, and approximately 3000 models were produced through 1924. The company then embarked on its own motorcycle designs, producing single-cylinder and flat-twin machines through WW2. \n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1878950", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1878950", "title": "Yolo Bypass", "text": "Yolo Bypass\n\nThe Yolo Bypass is one of the two flood bypasses in California's Sacramento Valley located in Yolo and Solano Counties. Through a system of weirs, the bypass diverts floodwaters from the Sacramento River away from the state's capital city of Sacramento and other nearby riverside communities.\n\nDuring wet years, the bypass can be full of water. The main input to the bypass is through the passive Fremont Weir, where water spills from the Sacramento into the bypass if it reaches the crest. Downstream, the Sacramento Weir, just north of the city of West Sacramento, can also be opened to divert additional waters from the Sacramento if needed. From the west, Cache Creek drains into the bypass. The bypass itself runs south, parallel to the Sacramento, and drains into the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, a few kilometres north of Rio Vista.\n\nThe bypass is crossed by the Yolo Causeway, a long highway bridge on Interstate 80, linking West Sacramento and the city of Davis. To the north, Interstate 5 also crosses the bypass on the Elkhorn Causeway, east of the city of Woodland.\n\nSacramento experienced several severe floods prior to construction of the bypass. The Yolo Basin, a depression formed during the last Ice Age, would fill up with water during the winter months from seasonal rainfall and runoff into the three rivers surrounding what is now the city of Sacramento (Sacramento, San Joaquin, and American). This created a diverse marsh ecosystem that could last more than 100 days. During the 1800s, seasonal flooding would limit travel and access between cities in the Sacramento River valley.\n\nDestructive floods in 1862 and 1878 prompted various flood control measures, including the long Tule Canal (completed in 1864) along the eastern edge of the present-day Yolo Bypass; and the Elkhorn Weir (1897–1917), downstream of the confluence of the Feather and Sacramento Rivers.\n\nCongress approved the Sacramento River Flood Control Project in 1911, with a plan to divert the water through multiple weirs and bypasses. The Yolo Bypass is one of two major bypasses in the Sacramento Valley that helps deter urban flooding. The other bypass is the Sutter Bypass, which lies upstream of the Yolo Bypass. The Yolo Bypass floodplain was designed in the early 1930s by the US Army Corps of Engineers. It lies just in between Yolo and Solano Counties.\nThe Yolo Bypass extends approximately long, north to south, and wide. The western and eastern edges are defined by levees separated by a distance ranging from apart, except for an long segment immediately south of the mouth of Putah Creek. The two largest sources for the Yolo Bypass are the Sacramento Weir, completed in 1916, and the Fremont Weir, completed in 1929.\n\nAlmost 75% of the Yolo Bypass is privately owned, while the rest belongs to the Yolo Bypass Wildlife Area. Most of the land is used for agriculture during the summer and spring, and the rest makes up marshland. This marshland is ideal for animal habitat, and is also utilized for fishing, hunting, and other recreational activities.\n\nFlood control is the main purpose of the Yolo Bypass. When the flowrate of the Sacramento River exceeds approximately , the excess is released into the Yolo Bypass at the passive Fremont Weir, near that river's confluence with the Feather River. The Fremont Weir, which lies along the south bank of the Sacramento, is about tall, nearly shorter than the levee on the north bank. When the water reaches the mark it starts to flow out into the Yolo Basin.\n\nNorth of where the Elkhorn Causeway crosses the Yolo Bypass, the Cache Creek flood control basin drains into the Yolo Bypass. The Knights Landing Ridge Cut, where the Colusa Basin Drainage Canal empties, also contributes to the flow in the Yolo Bypass near this point.\n\nThere is a second weir just north of West Sacramento, the Sacramento Weir, upstream of the confluence of the Sacramento and American Rivers. The Sacramento Weir is opened manually when the Sacramento River reaches at the I Street Bridge. It was built in 1916 by the City of Sacramento and contains 48 gates over its length; water from the Sacramento Weir flows through the long Sacramento Bypass and drains into the Yolo Bypass. The crest of the Sacramento Weir is at and the top of the moveable gates is ; each gate is long.\n\nWater flowing through the Yolo Bypass is drained through a riparian channel along its southeastern edge, named the Toe Drain. In the Liberty Farms area, the bypass joins first Prospect Slough and then Cache Slough adjacent to the connection of the Sacramento Deep Water Ship Channel. Cache Slough then reconnects with the Sacramento River just north of Rio Vista. The water eventually flows into the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, just above Rio Vista, and from there into San Francisco Bay.\n\nThe Yolo Bypass can hold approximately four times the flow of the Sacramento River. Together, the Sacramento River and Yolo Bypass are designed to handle a maximum flow of , of which the Sacramento handles and the bypass . This flood management relieves pressure on the surrounding river levee systems and reduces the risk of urban flooding in nearby cities, such as Sacramento or Davis. During wet years, which occur during more than half of all rainy seasons, the Yolo Bypass is flooded; when flooded, it covers an area equal to the area of San Francisco and San Pablo Bays, to a depth ranging from .\nThe state of California has the right to inundate any land in the Yolo Bypass with floodwater. These rights also limit landowners from growing vegetation or building structures that would significantly obstruct flow. There is no compensation for farmers who may lose crops or other losses due to flooding. The state manages the flooding of the Yolo Bypass with farmers and native species in mind. Using adaptive management, there is a balance between providing efficient flood protection, agriculture, and habitat benefits in the Yolo Bypass year-round.\n\nThe Yolo Bypass contains the Fremont Weir Wildlife Area, Sacramento Weir Wildlife Area and Yolo Bypass Wildlife Area. The Vic Fazio Yolo Wildlife Area is also part of the Yolo Bypass Wildlife Area and was the largest public/private restoration project west of the Florida Everglades. The entire bypass forms a valuable wetland habitat when flooded during the winter and spring rainy season. In the summer, areas of the bypass outside the wildlife areas are used for agriculture.\nThe Yolo Bypass provides habitat for over 280 terrestrial vertebrate species, changing throughout the seasons. The natural flooding provides an exceptionally good nursery habitat for native fish species, including the endangered Chinook salmon. Juvenile salmon have been found to grow substantially better in the Yolo Bypass than the adjacent Sacramento River. Other special-status wildlife residing in the Yolo Bypass includes giant garter snake, fairy shrimp, bald eagle, Swainson's Hawk, and more. Wildlife managers occasionally flood certain areas to create wetlands for migratory waterfowl. The Yolo Bypass is somewhat of a pit stop for the waterfowl, and it provides nesting habitat and food for this abundance of birds. The Yolo Basin Wetlands Project is accounted as being one of the largest wetland restoration projects in the Western United States. Habitats in the Yolo Basin Wetlands includes seasonal wetlands, uplands, perennial wetlands, vernal pools and riparian forest. The Bypass also holds species of riparian vegetation such as cottonwoods, black walnut, willows, saltgrass, and other assorted tree and grass species.\n\nHabitat Management activities are monitored annually by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife's Wildlife Area Habitat Committee for area in the Yolo Bypass Wildlife Area. Each year they establish a specific management plan for different parts of the land. The targeted species for seasonal wetland management is the timothy species. This plant provides countless nutritional seeds for consumption by assorted migratory waterfowl. There are also quite a few nonnative species that are not necessarily wanted in the bypass such as dock and perennial pepperweed.\nYears with high flows in the Yolo Bypass also benefit fish populations in the San Francisco Estuary. This is mainly because of increased habitat availability, food supply, larval transport, and reduced predation.\n\nThe floodplains of the Yolo Bypass are a surprisingly good farming ground for multiple seasonal crops. The California Department of Fish and Wildlife leases out land to farmers through the Dixon Resource Conservation District. The most widely grown crops include rice, safflower, processing tomatoes, corn, sunflower, and irrigated pasture. Half of the rice grown in the Yolo Bypass is wild due to its tolerance to colder weather. Farming is mainly done in late spring and summer when flooding does not usually occur, but farming can be halted or pushed back depending on the water level in the Bypass.\n\nAgricultural crops from Yolo County amount to about $300 million a year. Leftover crop residue is also beneficial to animal habitat. The already harvested land creates foraging area, and food opportunities, such as seeds for ring-necked pheasants and mourning dove.\n\nThe Yolo Bypass provides a multitude of recreational uses and educational as well. The Yolo Bypass Wildlife Headquarters provides summer educational programs for children in kindergarten through high school. These programs include hands on activities on plants, animals, and wetlands, using the Yolo Bypass Wildlife Area as a classroom. They have summer camps, classes, and are open to schools wanting to coordinate field trips as well. The Bypass is also open for guided tours for all ages of the public every month.\nThe Yolo Bypass is often used for bird watching, hunting, and hiking. Game species include waterfowl (when the bypass is flooded), ring-necked pheasant, and mourning dove. There are also assorted trails that loop around the wetlands in the Yolo Bypass that may be accessed by the public.\n\nRecent modeling shows that increasing flow to the Yolo Bypass may be beneficial for animal habitat. An upcoming project looks to extend the Yolo Bypass by potentially pushing back the levees, and allowing more room for water to be released into the Yolo Bypass. Separately, the Bay Delta Conservation Plan includes plans to help restore fish habitat in the Yolo Bypass. Its plan is to put a notch at the top the Fremont Weir to allow for more water to flow, increasing the frequency of flooding for fish habitat.\n\nThe Nigiri Project is a collaborative research study being done in the Yolo Bypass at Knaggs Ranch by the UC Davis Center for Watershed Sciences, the California Department of Water Resources, and the nonprofit organization California Trout.\n\nThis research is being conducted to find out how floodplains, particularly flooded rice fields, can provide habitat to endangered species such as the Chinook Salmon. In the summer these fields are used for the production of rice, while in the winter, the land can be flooded to create ideal wetland habitat for salmon. They have been experimenting for the past 4 consecutive winters, and have documented the fastest growth of Juvenile Chinook Salmon ever recorded in the Central Valley. The experiment aims to mimic the natural annual flood cycle of the Sacramento River, which most native fish species relied upon.\n\nThis project is currently funded by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, California Trout, and the California Department of Water Resources.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1878953", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1878953", "title": "RENEA", "text": "RENEA\n\nThe Department of Neutralization of Armed Elements () commonly known by its acronym RENEA, is the main Albanian counter-terrorist and critical incident response unit. The force was constituted in the early 1990s in response to the growing crime levels in the country after the fall of communism. RENEA's responsibilities are rescue operations, hostage situations, counter-terrorism and response to particularly violent forms of crime. Since 1990, the unit has lost four men in action and more than forty wounded. Their skills are highly regarded and well thought-of inside Albania and in the West, they are reported to have one of the highest OPTEMPOs (frequency of deployments) in all of Europe and they have been trained by GSG 9.\n\nFollowing the emergence of capitalism in Albania after 1990 and in order to eradicate all semblances to and associations with the communist state, many investigators, attorneys and police officers were simply dismissed. This confused situation soon allowed organized and individual crime to flourish to the point that it soon became the norm of everyday life. Kidnapping, extortion, drug-related crime, murder and human trafficking were at an all-time high, and the Albanian fledgling democracy did not have the legal, administrative and organizational experience to combat these problems — in fact its infrastructure was almost non-existent. During communism, the force that was entrusted with CT and other special missions was Unit 326, but because of its role in suppressing public unrest during the popular uprising against communism, it had been neglected.\n\nThe new public order authorities recognised the need for a small professional force, and after exhaustive trials and training finally established what subsequently came to be known as RENEA. It was also known as Unit 88. It was composed of eighty members, or operatives, who were elected from the 600 original members of Unit 326. The rest of the operators joined subsequent special intervention groups that came into existence.\n\nThe real number is secret but is estimated to be about 200 members. Initially, its organization was military in nature, dividing each team in groups of four, after the reputable British SAS system. In case of an open conflict, the police were expected to assume military duties. However, after the administrative reform of the Albanian Police, such duties were excluded from the police curriculum. Consequently, even RENEA was reorganized, this time modelling itself after sister units such as GSG-9, GIS, NOCS, GIGN etc. The tactics are still primarily SAS-based, but not the actual duties. The unit is composed of negotiators, infiltrators, divers, rock-climbing, sappers, snipers and a small nucleus of logistics operatives.\nOrganization:\n\n\n\nThe selection process is held only once a year and lasts twelve weeks. Subsequently, recruits are trained for an additional nine months in other skills such as linguistics, signals, photography, and hostage negotiations. Candidates also continue undergoing strict psychological and physical tests. Only after a period of three years may the recruit become a RENEA operator cleared in participating in hostage rescue operations. About 90 per cent of candidates come from other branches of the police and the National Guard, while the rest are military. The military candidates that pass selection must also complete a six-month course on jurisprudence. The maximum age for selection is 26 years and candidates are expected to have been members of their respective previous units for no less than two years. The first two weeks are called the \"shake-down\", in which almost everyone takes part. Only the negotiators and part of the logistics group (not including drivers) are exempted. Candidates undergo long and complicated psychological and durability tests designed to weed out weaker applicants. \"Shake-down\" is harsh, consisting of forced marches in full combat gear. True to their SAS origins, the operatives must carry a 35 kg (77 lb) backpack, AK-47 with eight full magazines, handgun and magazines, knives, gas mask, and radio. Their training routes take part in the worst weather, in some of the toughest terrain that Albania has to offer: in the northeastern mountain range (the highest peak is Korabi, at 2,751 metres (9,025 feet)), the marshes of Vlora, and the swamps of Durrës and Lezha. Approximately 75 per cent of the candidates fail at this initial phase. The last day is reserved for infiltration tests. The candidates that have successfully accomplished the first phase are left helpless in some remote part of Albania, at a safe distance from the capital, with 200 commandos and national guardsmen at their heels. Each is expected to make it back to headquarters in Tirana unintercepted. If they are caught they go home. Training, preparation and tests change according to the whims of the instructors, who are themselves veterans of the unit. They have a reputation for being unyielding and unmerciful.\n\nFrom 1991, the unit's negotiators have resolved, without resorting to violence, more than 500 of the 600 cases involving kidnappers and armed occupations.\n\nAll negotiators must have served for minimum of ten years with the police force and are persons of good temperament and mental balance, with knowledge of all dialects and regional mentalities. They all either have a degree in law or have attended the police academy. In addition they complete training courses with the FBI at Quantico FBI Academy and with other United States federal agencies. The negotiators are the first to intervene in cases of an occupation with or without hostages. Nobody intervenes without their explicit order, except in cases when the hostage is already dead.\n\nThe force uses a motley collection of weapons. One of the primary tools is the Beretta ARX-160 A3, which Albania possesses in abundance. However, the unit is also known to have used the HK G3 7.62×51mm NATO. Submachine guns, such as the HK MP5 are also highly regarded. The fighting knives are of mixed origins - Randall and an assortment of locally manufactured products depending on the preferences of the operatives themselves. Knife fighting is a considered vital skill and the operatives are highly trained. RENEA's weaponry is currently being updated and brought in line with weapons that are conventionally used by sister units abroad.\n\nThe sniper rifle is another tool of the trade for RENEA. Initially, the unit favoured the Russian Dragunov SVD, which, is still in use with the military and various law enforcement agencies. However, the SVD is actually intended to extend the effective range of fire of infantry squads up to 600 metres. Given the delicate nature of their missions, RENEA reverted to \"proper\" sniper rifles and currently employs SAKO TRG-22, TRG-42 and M10 rifles.\n\nSearch and rescue training is effected with live ammunition. Operatives themselves simulate the hostage. Many special halls and rooms are built to conduct this type of training, and are known as \"SAS Rooms\" by the unit. In addition, \"Good faith shooting\" is practised, which consists of the operatives standing in line facing one another and shooting at targets placed between them. The bulletproof Kevlar vest and helmet are the same as those used by the German GSG-9. They are quite heavy, but they can stop a .30-06 projectile. All types of flash-bang, tear gas and non-lethal ammunition are in the unit's arsenal. British Avalon anti-gas masks, fireproof clothing (the same as used by the Italian GIS, and NOCS), kneepads, fireproof and tear-proof gloves are also used. Most of the personal equipment is of US origins, but a few Italian types are also in use, such as Vega and Radar.\n\nIn special situations the use of (Russian 7.62×39mm RPD and RPK machine guns) is authorized. Beretta APX and Glock 34 are the favorite sidearms. H&K USPs is also in use depending on the personnel preference. Vehicles in use include IVECO vans, Mitsubishi SUVs, and a motley collection of armoured and private cars. In waterborne operations, Zodiac boats confiscated from traffickers are in use. Depending on the circumstances, the Albanian Navy could place at their disposal various types of boats and other craft. Mil Mi-8 helicopter is used if a situation demands infiltration by air.\n\n\nOver the years (until 2002) the unit has suffered only 3 casualties: Specialist Lulezim R. Sulollari (1991), Non-commissioned officer Arben N. Ujka (1993), Captain Elam S. Elezi (1998).\nOn 24 June 2015 during a police operation in the village of Lazarat, southern Albania one operator (Ibrahim Basha) was killed in action, while two other operators (Perlat Hamitaj and Jetmir Isaj) were wounded.\n\nLoosely translated, RENEA stands for \"Department of Neutralization of Armed Elements\", whereby \"RE\" accounts for \"REparti\" (Departament), \"N\" for \"Neutralizimit\" (Neutralisation), \"E\" for \"Elementit\" (Element), and \"A\" for \"Armatosur\" (Armed). A common misconception is the addition of the word \"Elimination\" to account for the second \"E\". Therefore, the name would get a new meaning: \"Department of Elimination and Neutralization of Armed Elements\".\nIn another version (received directly by one of the most representing members of the group previously called \"repart 326\") the first \"e\" of RENEA stands for \"Energjike\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe force has a mascot, a little three-legged dog called Triçikle (English: tricycle), who is considered to bring great fortune to the unit.\n\n"}

It was released as a launch title for the Sony PlayStation 2 in 2000, and was subsequently ported to Microsoft Windows and Mac OS the following year. In the game, the player plays the role of Joseph and can assemble a team of compatriots and summon powerful monsters. The game has a world map, involved storyline, and unique hybrid combat system involving real-time and turn-based mechanisms.\n\nA sequel, \"Summoner 2\", was released in 2002, and would be the last game in the \"Summoner\" series.\n\nAfter the bankruptcy of publisher THQ in December 2012, the \"Summoner\" franchise was acquired by Nordic Games, who have since published \"Summoner\" on GOG.com (February 25, 2014) and on Steam Digital Distribution platform (March 12, 2014).\n\nIn addition to the main storyline, there are over twenty side quests that may be completed. Summoner's combat system is a hybrid system incorporating real-time and turn-based combat, with characters essentially \"taking turns\" to attack during real-time gameplay. Included within this system is a unique \"Chain attack\" mechanic, in which players can extend their \"turn\" by performing special melee attacks at the appropriate time. If done correctly, players can \"chain\" these special attacks into long sequences, inflicting far greater amounts of damage than they might otherwise have. These special attacks can also have special effects such as inflicting status effects, damaging an enemy's action points or inflicting more health damage than normal. Characters can also acquire and use a variety of special abilities and spells, expending \"action points\" in order to use these abilities. The game's Summoning mechanic allows the player to conjure monsters that will serve as additional party members, allowing the player to have a 5-character party instead of a 4-character party. These monsters have their own spells and abilities that they bring into combat, but will go rogue and attack the player's party if Joseph is defeated in combat.\n\nScott Lee was the main composer and senior sound designer of \"Summoner\" and did most of the game music with Dan Wentz helping on the soundtrack towards the end of development near gold master. Wally Shaw did sound design and some editing of music towards the middle of development. After interplay went bankrupt, Lee provided the first tech demonstration for THQ. During this time Lee and Wentz also worked on the early \"Descent 4\" trailer music, which later rebranded into \"Red Faction\" for legal reasons and \"FreeSpace 2\".\n\nBlake Fischer reviewed the PlayStation 2 version of the game for \"Next Generation\", rating it two stars out of five, and stated that \"This is PlayStation 2? Unfortunately for the game – and the system – it's proving all too typical.\"\n\nThe PC version received \"generally favorable reviews\", while the PlayStation 2 version received \"average\" reviews, according to the review aggregation website Metacritic.\n\nA sequel, \"Summoner 2\", was released in 2002.\n\nOn December 19, 2012, THQ filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy and its properties were auctioned off in individual lots.

She was married to Felício Pinto Coelho de Mendonça, a military officer of low rank. Crowned emperor, Pedro I invited her to move to Rio de Janeiro and offered her an office at the Court, placing her at the Empress's entourage as her lady-in-waiting. There she managed to have her first marriage nullified.\n\nThe emperor proved himself very generous when it came to honour his favourite and her family as well. Bestowing on her the title of Viscountness of Santos was a slap in the face of the family of José Bonifácio, the patriarch of the independence and the most eminent people of the city of Santos, São Paulo. He also did not hesitate in bestowing titles on their three daughters (the Duchesses of Goiás and Ceará and the Countess of Iguaçu) and insisting on their being educated with the royal princesses. The Marchioness' sister was made Baroness of Sorocaba and eventually she joined the extensive roll of royal mistresses, and bore a child with him.\n\nMaria Leopoldina, the empress, died in 1826 due to complications caused by a miscarriage. The public opinion held the Marchioness responsible for the grievances and humiliations suffered by the empress.\n\nSince marrying Domitila was not an option, Pedro chose for his second marriage the young Bavarian princess Amélie de Beauharnais von Leuchtenberg, granddaughter of Empress Josephine. Subsequently, he dismissed Domitila who returned to São Paulo. There she married again, to the brigadier Rafael Tobias de Aguiar.\n\nDomitila de Castro died from enterocolitis in her native São Paulo on November 3, 1867, aged 69.

{"id": "1879002", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1879002", "title": "Gianluca Pessotto", "text": "Gianluca Pessotto\n\nGianluca Pessotto (; born 11 August 1970) is a retired footballer who played as a defender or midfielder. A former Italian international, he spent the majority of his club career with Juventus, where he won several domestic and international trophies, and is now head of its youth system. He represented his country at the 1998 FIFA World Cup, and at UEFA Euro 2000, reaching the final of the latter tournament.\n\nAfter his retirement in 2006, Pessotto remained at Juventus as a member of the coaching staff. He is currently the Sporting Director (\"Direttore Sportivo\") of the club's youth academy.\n\nPessotto was given the nickname \"Il Professorino\" (\"The Little Professor\") by the fans, due to his glasses, his interest in philosophy and literature, and as he was able to obtain a law degree during his career. His stamina and ability to run very quickly – indeed he was often described as almost \"flying\" on field in the media – also earned him the nickname \"Passerotto\" (\"Little Sparrow\").\n\nBorn in Latisana, in the province of Udine, Pessotto started his career in the A.C. Milan youth system. However, he was instantly sold to A.S. Varese 1910 in 1989. He never made a professional appearance for Milan.\n\nAfter joining Varese in 1989, Pessotto officially began his professional career. In two full seasons with the club, he tallied an impressive 64 appearances, also finding the back of the net on a solo occasion.\n\nIn August 1991, Pessotto transferred to U.S. Massese 1919, although he only remained at the club for one season. in his lone season, he appeared 23 times in the league, netting one goal.\n\nFollowing impressive spells with both A.S. Varese 1910 and U.S. Massese 1919, he transferred to, then, Serie B club Bologna F.C. 1909 in the summer of 1992. Despite being a highly anticipated transfer, Pessotto made just 21 league appearances, and was sold at the conclusion of the season. He also scored one goal for the Bolognese club.\n\nAfter a season with Bologna in Serie B, Pessotto transferred to fellow Serie B club, Hellas Verona F.C. in 1993. Pessotto was an undisputed starter for much of the season, impressing greatly. He made 34 league appearances with a seasonal career high of 3 goals.\n\nAfter impressing in the second division of Italian football, Pessotto transferred to Torino F.C. in 1994. In his first season in the Serie A, Pessotto racked up a starting position along with 32 league appearances and his first Serie A goal. After greatly impressing in his debut Serie A season, Pessotto moved to city rivals and European giants Juventus, in 1995, in what was a very highly regarded transfer.\n\nAfter joining Juventus in 1995, Pessotto instantly became a key part of the first team and helped Juventus form what was considered to be one of the best defences in the world at this time, and teams strongly regretted ever going down a goal to the club, as they knew how hard it would be to score one back for themselves. Pessotto formed impressive defensive partnerships with the likes of Ciro Ferrara, Moreno Torricelli, Paolo Montero, Mark Iuliano, Lilian Thuram, Alessandro Birindelli, Igor Tudor, Gianluca Zambrotta, Nicola Legrottaglie, Fabio Cannavaro, Jonathan Zebina, and Giorgio Chiellini during his lengthy 12-year tenure with the club. He was one of many experienced players who had been at Juventus for a lengthy period of time. Injuries and other issues in the closing stages of his career limited his first-team opportunities to mainly being used a substitute to Jonathan Zebina or Lilian Thuram. Pessotto retired at the end of the 2005–2006 Serie A season, after back to back \"Scudetti\". With Juventus he managed well over 250 total appearances scoring 2 league goals in the process. Among his achievements as a Juventus player, Pessotto won the UEFA Champions League in 1996 (scoring a penalty in Juventus's shoot-out victory over Ajax), playing in 4 Champions League Finals, the UEFA Super Cup in 1996, the Intercontinental Cup in 1996, 1 UEFA Intertoto Cup in 2000, 4 Scudetti (1997, 1998, 2002, 2003) 4 Supercoppa Italiana titles (1997, 1998, 2002, 2003), and 1 Coppa Italia in 1995.\n\nIn total, Pessotto was capped 22 times for Italy between 1996 and 2002, under managers Arrigo Sacchi (1996), Cesare Maldini (1996–98), Dino Zoff (1998–2000), and Giovanni Trapattoni (2000–2002). He played for his country at the 1998 FIFA World Cup, where Italy were eliminated by hosts and eventual champions France on penalties in the quarter finals, and at Euro 2000. At Euro 2000, Pessotto scored a penalty in the semi-final shootout win over co-hosts the Netherlands, which sent Italy into the final against France. In the final, Pessotto would set up Delvecchio's goal; however, he only picked up a runners-up medal, as Italy lost to France for the second consecutive tournament, after conceding a last minute equaliser, and then subsequently conceding a David Trezeguet golden goal. Trezeguet became his Juventus teammate the following season. He was unable to take part at the 2002 World Cup with Italy due to injury.\n\nDespite initially not being known as the most naturally talented, flashy, or technically gifted footballer, Pessotto was considered to be a promising prospect in his youth, and later made a name for himself as a correct, hard-working, reliable, tactically intelligent, efficient, and versatile utility player, with solid ball control and a good positional sense, who was able to play as an attacking full-back or wing-back, or also as a wide midfielder on either flank. Despite being naturally right-footed, he was capable of playing with either foot, and he usually preferred to play on the left side of the pitch. In this role, he was known for his pace, calm composure, reading of the game, and stamina, as well as his ability to chase and close down opponents, win back the ball with his tackles, and subsequently carry it up the flank, play exchanges with teammates, get forward, and deliver crosses into the area, courtesy of his distribution and ability to make attacking runs, which enabled him to cover the flank effectively. He was also capable of playing as a central or defensive midfielder, and was even used as a centre-back on occasion, due to his consistency, awareness, and man-marking ability. He was also an accurate penalty taker. In spite of his reserved character, his sportsmanship, fair-play attitude, professionalism, discipline, elegant playing style, and gregariousness made him an important, well-liked, and respected figure in the dressing room, among both his teammates and managers.\n\nFollowing his retirement, Pessotto was successively appointed as the new Juventus team manager.\n\nWeeks after his retirement as a footballer, he survived a 15-metre fall from a fourth storey window at the headquarters of Juventus, on 27 June 2006. As he was holding a rosary, it is believed that he was attempting suicide in the wake of the Calciopoli scandal which led his club to be stripped of two Serie A titles and relegated in Serie B for their first time in history. He suffered multiple fractures and internal bleeding from the fall. On 17 July 2006, medical staff declared him out of danger and stated that he would not have long-term mental damage or physical paralysis. His wife Reana later declared it had not been a suicide attempt, but that Pessotto had blacked-out.\n\nAfter recovering Pessotto resumed his managerial duties. In the summer of 2009 he was appointed \"Primavera\" (U-20) coach, replacing former teammate Ciro Ferrara, who had been just been named the new first team manager.\n\n\n\n\n"}

From 2001 to 2010, the facility hosted the annual \"play-in\" game in the NCAA men's basketball tournament (officially the \"opening round\" game) which featured the teams rated 64th and 65th in the tournament field. Beginning in 2011, when the tournament expanded to four opening-round games, the arena continued to host all \"first four\" games. Overall, the arena has hosted more men's NCAA Division I basketball tournament games than any other venue.\n\nThe playing court is known as Blackburn Court, named after historic UD coach Tom Blackburn. The Donoher Center expansion on the southwest corner of the arena was completed in 1998. Named for former Flyers basketball coach Don Donoher, the Center provides an NBA-caliber facility for conditioning and game preparation. The arena was extensively renovated during the summer of 2002. The additions include new and expanded concession areas, luxury boxes, disabled access improvements, and a restaurant/bar named the Time-Warner Flight Deck. Because of this, the venue was awarded the 2003 and 2004 Atlantic 10 Conference men's basketball tournaments. In 2010, four new video screens by Daktronics were installed, one in each of the arena's four corners. Following the 2016–17 basketball season, a 3-year renovation project began at UD Arena. The renovation includes updated seating, a new four-sided video board above center court, new club seating, new corner terrace suites, updated bathrooms, new ticket office location, and improved arena Wi-Fi. These renovations are expected to be completed by 2020.\n\nThe arena has been hailed by sportscasters and opponent coaches alike as one of the greatest venues in college basketball.

Along with its hosting duties for the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Opening Round game (\"play-in\" game), it also served as the host of the Midwestern Collegiate Conference (now Horizon League) men's basketball conference tournament from 1989 to 1991 and was the host of the Atlantic Ten Basketball tournament in 2003 and 2004. The arena hosted the Opening Round game through 2010, when it was also a regional venue for the women's tournament. It then became the first location for the revised opening round of four games for the men's tournament in March 2011.\n\nThe University of Dayton Arena hosted second- and third-round games of the 2013 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament as well as the four opening-round games of the 2011, 2012 and 2013 tournaments. Through March 15, 2018, it has hosted 119 games in the NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament over its history, making it the most used venue to host NCAA Men's Tournament games ahead of Kansas City's Municipal Auditorium which has hosted 83.\nIn 1972, the new World Hockey Association looked to put a team in Dayton, but UD Arena did not have an ice plant, and the university balked at the cost of installing one. (That franchise eventually became the Houston Aeros.) \n\nAs the largest indoor arena between Cincinnati and Columbus, UD Arena is often a regular stop for concert tours. Elton John, Elvis Presley, Aerosmith, Rush, Bob Seger, Mötley Crüe, George Strait, Kenny Chesney, Usher, Lupe Fiasco, Jay-Z and other performers have performed at this arena.

The elevation of its floor is approximately above sea level.\n\nThe venue is also used for concerts (capacity 13,390), community events, and trade shows ( of arena floor space plus in the auxiliary gym). It hosted a Davis Cup tennis match in April 2013, a second-round tie between the U.S. and Serbia.\n\nThe arena's predecessor on campus was Bronco Gymnasium, which opened in the mid-1950s, during the junior college era. Its last varsity basketball game was the regular season finale in 1982 on February 27, against rival Idaho, ranked ninth in the AP poll. Sold out two weeks in advance, the Saturday night game had a record attendance of 3,946; the capacity of the gym at the time was listed at 3,682.\n\nLong in the planning stages, the architects were Cline, Smull, Hamill and Associates of Boise, selected in October 1978. Ground was broken for the arena in February 1980, directly north of the Bronco Gym. Construction displaced the tennis courts and the right field area of the baseball field, currently the site of the auxiliary gym on the west side of the arena.\n\nEight tennis courts were rebuilt on the former baseball infield, west of the arena. The baseball field was not rebuilt as BSU dropped baseball as a varsity sport following the During their final season, the Broncos played home games at Borah Field (now Wigle Field) at Borah High School, west of campus.\n\nThe arena opened in 1982 as the BSU Pavilion; its first event was BSU's commencement on May 16, followed by graduation ceremonies for the city's public high schools. That August, it hosted an eight-day Billy Graham Crusade, and its first significant sporting event was the 1983 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament.\n\nIn April 2017, Boise State ended their wrestling program, which had been using the arena as its home venue.\n\nThe BSU Pavilion received its first naming rights sponsorship in June 2004 with Taco Bell, a fast-food restaurant chain based in Irvine, California; the 15-year agreement with the university was for $4 million and the venue was renamed Taco Bell Arena. At its expiration in 2019, Boise State entered into a new agreement with ExtraMile, a convenience store chain jointly owned by Chevron and Jacksons; the 15-year agreement with the university was for $8.4 million and it was renamed ExtraMile Arena.\n\nWhile the Broncos were members, the venue hosted four Big Sky Conference men's basketball tournaments: 1985, 1989, 1990, and 1994. In those four tourneys, BSU made the finals in 1989 and won the title in 1994.\n\nExtraMile Arena has been a familiar site for early-round NCAA Tournament games, hosting first and second round competition nine times (1983, 1989, 1992, 1995, 1998, 2001, 2005, 2009, and 2018). The NCAA tournament is scheduled to return in 2021.\n\nIn 1995, UCLA guard Tyus Edney dashed the length of the court in just over four seconds to make a layup that gave the Bruins a 75–74 win over Missouri, which sustained UCLA's run to a national title.\n\nIn 2001, it was the site of the closest first-round day at a single host location ever, with the four games played on March 15 decided by a combined total of seven points. One was Hampton's upset of #2 seed Iowa State — Hampton was only the fourth #15 seed to beat a #2 seed since the tournament expanded from 53 to 64 teams in 1985.\n\n\n"}

Ray Thompson and former university president Dr. Edward J. Boling. The basketball court is named \"The Summitt\" after the late Lady Vols basketball coach Pat Summitt. It replaced the Stokely Athletic Center. The mammoth octagonal building lies just northwest of the Tennessee River, and just southwest of Neyland Stadium. As an echo of its neighbor and a tribute to the brick-and-mortar pattern atop Ayres Hall, the baselines of the court are painted in the familiar orange-and-white checkerboard pattern.\n\nIn terms of seating capacity, Thompson-Boling was at one time the largest facility ever built specifically for basketball in the United States with a seating capacity of 24,535 until its 2007 renovation. The current capacity is 21,678. The men's record crowd was 25,610 for a game against Kentucky on January 21, 1989, which is also the SEC record for a regular-season game. The Lady Vols' record crowd of 24,653, set at their win over archrival UConn on January 7, 2006, is also the all-time record for an NCAA regular-season women's game.\n\nThe facility hosted the 1989 Southeastern Conference men's basketball tournament. It hosted games of the NCAA men's basketball tournament in 1990 (first and second rounds), 1994 (regional), and 1999 (regional), and the 1990 NCAA Women's Final Four.\n\nSince 2001, it has played host to Knoxville's Living Christmas Tree.\n\nIn August 2006, ground was broken for the Pratt Pavilion, a basketball practice facility to be located adjacent to the arena. It was ready for use in early November, but not all exterior construction were finished.\n\nOn November 30, 2006, plans were announced at utsports.com to add new renovations to Thompson–Boling Arena. Renovations included black seats, a center hung scoreboard, and concourse refurbishments, such as graphics and other amenities. Also added were luxury suites and loge seating. Construction began in March 2007. Phase I was finished in late October 2007 with an opening game against the Temple Owls of the Atlantic 10 Conference.\n\nPhase II is scheduled to include a new lighting system, new ticket kiosks, and new food courts.\n\nThe outer volume of Thompson–Boling Arena is approximately .\n\nDuring the 2006–2007 and the 2007–2008 year, the University of Tennessee Men's Basketball team went 16–0 in Thompson–Boling Arena. As of November 18, 2008, Bruce Pearl's home record at Thompson–Boling Arena was 47–2, a home winning percentage at Tennessee of 96%.\n\nOn February 5, 2009, history was made at Thompson–Boling Arena, as the Tennessee Lady Vols defeated the Georgia Bulldogs 73–43, to give head coach Pat Summitt her 1,000th win.\n\nIt is also a concert venue, holding up to 25,000 people. It has been Tennessee's largest arena since it was opened. Only Greensboro Coliseum Complex has had a larger capacity among other arenas in the Southeast.\n\n\n"}

The arena opened in 1976 and is named after former Nebraska football coach and athletic director Bob Devaney. It is home to the Cornhuskers gymnastics, indoor track and field and swimming and diving teams, and was also home to the school's basketball teams through the 2012–13 season. The building largely replaced the Nebraska Coliseum, which was the former home of the volleyball and wrestling teams.\n\nIt hosted the 1980, 1984 and 1988 men's NCAA basketball tournament Midwest first- and second-round games, and the 1993 women's NCAA tournament first round.

He appeared in Hyndluljóð (the Lay of Hyndla), a poem in the Poetic Edda. In this tale, Óttar is said to be very pious to the goddesses. He built a shrine of stones, a hörgr, and on it made many offerings to Freyja. The goddess answered his prayers and went on a journey to help him find his pedigree. Freyja disguised Óttar as her boar Hildisvini (the Battle-Swine) and brought him to the giantess Hyndla, a seeress. There, Freyja forced Hyndla to tell Óttar about his ancestors, as well as to give him a memory potion so that he would remember all that he was told.\n\nIt has been theorized that the framework of the poem was created for the 12th-century poet to produce a list of mythical heroes' names. The poem does not connect much to other poems in the Edda, and is often viewed as a semi-historical work. \n"}

Huntsman Center is a 15,000-seat indoor arena in the western United States, on the campus of the University of Utah in Salt Lake City. It is the home of the Utah Utes of the Pac-12 Conference, the primary venue for basketball and gymnastics.\n\nOpened in late 1969 as the Special Events Center, it succeeded Nielsen Fieldhouse as the campus' primary indoor arena. It was renamed in 1987 in honor of chemicals entrepreneur and philanthropist Jon M. Huntsman father of Utah's former governor Jon Huntsman, Jr.\n\nFrom its opening until the completion of the Vivint Smart Home Arena in 1991 (as \"Delta Center\"), the Huntsman Center was one of Salt Lake City's premier sports and entertainment venues (along with the Salt Palace the home of the Utah Stars (ABA) and Utah Jazz (NBA)).\n\nArchitecturally, it was once known for its steel cloud, which hung from the arena's silver dome interior. The steel cloud held the arena's center court scoreboard, sound and lighting systems. The scoreboard was upgraded in the 1980s with the addition of state-of-the-art rear projection video screens. The rear projection system was upgraded in 1995, and replaced in 2006 by four LED video screens. In 2014, the arena was renovated again. The $6 million project removed the steel cloud, as well as added a new floor, LED lights, sound system, drapes, and two grand entrances to house a Hall of Fame and Legacy Hall. \n\nOn May 12, 1973, The Jackson 5 performed at the center.\n\nThe facility hosted the 1989 Western Athletic Conference men's basketball tournament.\n\nThe facility hosted two games of the Utah Jazz Summer League in 2016 due to a concert at Vivint Smart Home Arena. In 2017, the Utah Jazz Summer League moved to the Huntsman Center for all six games & four teams due to the Vivint Smart Home Arena undergoing renovations. \n\nThe 15,000-seat multi-purpose arena is home to the University of Utah's \"Runnin' Utes\" basketball teams (men's and women's), \"Red Rocks\" women's gymnastics team and women's volleyball team. It also hosts concerts, mostly second-tier acts; most premier concerts have been hosted at Vivint Smart Home Arena (Delta Center).\n\nUtah joined the Pac-12 in 2011 and the Huntsman Center became the largest arena in the conference.\n\nThe elevation at street level is approximately above sea level, second-highest in the Pac-12.\n\nThe Huntsman Center hosted the first and second rounds of the NCAA Tournament 12 times (1984, 1985, 1987, 1988, 1990, 1991, 1993, 1995, 1997, 2000, 2003, and 2006). It hosted the West Regional Final twice (1971, 1981) and one Final Four (1979). Due to the frequency of hosting first and second round games, the Huntsman Center is third all-time in NCAA Tournament games hosted, with 81.\n\nSince 2010, NCAA tournament games in the city have been played at Vivint Smart Home Arena, home of the NBA's Utah Jazz. Other venues for past NCAA games in the state include the Marriott Center in Provo and the Dee Events Center in Ogden. \n\nThe arena hosted the 1979 Final Four in late March, featuring the start of the rivalry between all-time greats Magic Johnson and Magic's Michigan State team defeated Bird's previously unbeaten Indiana State in the which remains the most-watched college basketball game in history. Many observers consider the Magic-Bird rivalry established here and carried into the NBA when both entered the league that fall to be a major factor in the league's 1980s renaissance.\n\n\n \n"}

Ground was broken for the $160 million facility on January 26, 2007, and it officially opened on May 11, 2010, with the inaugural class inducted the day following the 2010 NASCAR Sprint All-Star Race. The new Hall of Fame brings hundreds of jobs and an increase in tourism to Charlotte. In addition to the Hall of Fame, the NASCAR Plaza, a 20-story office building, opened in May 2009. The structure serves as the home of Hall of Fame-related offices, NASCAR Digital Media, NASCAR's licensing division, as well as NASCAR video game licensee Dusenberry Martin Racing (now known as 704Games). Other tenants include the Charlotte Regional Partnership and Lauth Property Group. Richard Petty and Dale Inman helped unveil the first artifact at the Hall of Fame — the Plymouth Belvedere that Petty drove to 27 wins in 1967.\n\nThe City of Charlotte was responsible for the construction of the building and is the owner of the NASCAR Hall of Fame. However, it is operated by the Charlotte Regional Visitors Authority. Winston Kelley is the NASCAR Hall of Fame executive director. Internationally renowned Pei Cobb Freed & Partners led the design effort, and Leslie E. Robertson Associates were the structural engineers. Little Diversified Architectural Consulting based in Charlotte is the local architectural firm overseeing many aspects of design and construction of the project. LS3P Associates, Ltd. was the associate architect for the office tower. Tobin Starr + Partners served as site architect, providing full-time representation for Pei Cobb Freed & Partners during construction. Engineering and fabrication of the stainless steel möbius that wraps around the structure was completed by Zahner, of Kansas City. Exhibition design is by Ralph Appelbaum Associates, and exhibition lighting by Technical Artistry. Tobin Starr + Partners is architect-of-record for exhibit and auditorium spaces. Jaros, Baum & Bolles (JB&B) was the mechanical, electrical and plumbing engineer. Site excavation and grading services started on May 21, 2007. The facility features a Hall of Fame and a 19-story office tower. The NASCAR Hall of Fame is set on a 150,000 square feet surface. In June 2008, NASCAR announced that the inauguration is planned in May 11, 2010. In 2009, Nascar Hall of Fame established a partnership with Buffalo Wild Wings to be its exclusive restaurant partner in Charlotte.\n\nBecause of stock car racing's roots in and wealth of famous drivers from North Carolina, Charlotte was considered the favorite by many fans and commentators. There are many NASCAR offices in the area and many teams in the three major NASCAR series (Cup, Xfinity and Truck Series) totaling over 73% of motorsports employees in the United States, in what the committee called \"NASCAR Valley.\" The Hall of Fame is in Uptown Charlotte, about 25 minutes south of Charlotte Motor Speedway. The bid was led by NASCAR car owner Rick Hendrick, then Mayor Pat McCrory, and business leaders in Charlotte. Pei Cobb Freed & Partners were enlisted to design the complex, which is near the Charlotte Convention Center.\n\nThe building contains the following:\n\n\nThere is a gift shop, the Hall of Fame Café and a Buffalo Wild Wings restaurant on site. An expansion, which includes a new ballroom, is part of the project.\n\nWhile most information on the Charlotte bid has been released voluntarily, the \"Charlotte Observer\" has asked the state Attorney General for an opinion requiring full disclosure of the financial details.\n\nThe self-proclaimed slogan used by Charlotte for the Hall of Fame was \"Racing Was Built Here. Racing Belongs Here.\"\n\nThe other two cities at the time of the announcement that were in the running were the cities of Atlanta and Daytona Beach.\n\nThe state of Alabama had been mentioned as a potential candidate location, and was no longer seen as a contender, possibly because Lincoln, Alabama is home to the International Motorsports Hall of Fame, which is not affiliated with NASCAR. The only northern area that considered bidding was in the state of Michigan. Detroit prepared bids, but state officials decided not to submit the proposals. The cities of Richmond, Virginia and Kansas City, Kansas, were among the five finalists, but on January 5, 2006, NASCAR announced they had been eliminated from the running, leaving just Atlanta, Charlotte and Daytona Beach as the remaining cities.\n\nFormer drivers must have been active in NASCAR for at least 10 years and retired for at least three. Starting with the 2015 Hall of Fame nominations that were voted in the 2014 nomination process, the three-year rule is waived for drivers who compete in 30 or more years in NASCAR-sanctioned competition or turn 55 years of age. The rule applies to all NASCAR-sanctioned competitions; some drivers in the Hall of Fame did not participate in the Cup Series.\n\nNon-drivers must have been involved in the industry at least ten years.

{"id": "1879052", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1879052", "title": "Schuco Modell", "text": "Schuco Modell\n\nSchuco is a German toy maker founded in 1912 by Heinrich Müller and the businessman Heinrich Schreyer in Nuremberg Germany's toy capital since early days. The company's specialty was usually cars and trucks in tin, plastic and diecast. The company went bankrupt in 1976 but was reorganized in 1993 and then totally independent again by 1996.\n\nOriginally named Spielzeugfirma Schreyer & Co, the company changed its name to the more succinct Schuco in 1921 (likely a derivation of Schreyer und Company; see Knox 2002, p. 4; Rixon 2005, p. 64). At its beginnings, the company made unique clockwork tin toys (Johnson 1998, p. 210). Some of these were clever in that, instead of using a key, one would wind an arm or another feature (King 1986, p. 173).\n\nIn the 1920s Schuco introduced its famous Pick-Pick bird (over 20 million were made up until the 1960s). A wind-up mouse, a dancing mouse and trotting dog wearing a cape were other popular offerings (King 1986, p. 173). Before World War II there were also a number of 'gnome'-like wind-up figures and soldiers sometimes called blacksmiths – finished in creative colorful attire.\nIn 1935 one of the first Schuco patent motor cars was produced, starting a legacy of producing toy motor vehicles that have usually been the company's main offering. Schuco toy lines always had some special quality or gimmick to attract collectors as well as children. Around 1938, production was begun on tin cars that were made either with clockwork motors or 'telesteering' where the toy could be steered through a small steering wheel attached to the car with a wire (Schuco 3000 No date).\n\nSchuco 'Studio' cars had a starting crank, removable wheels, varied gearing and rack and pinion steering. Cars came with miniature tool kits. Probably because the Schuco name ended in \"o\", this started a tradition of naming vehicle lines and sets with a somewhat male, Italian-sounding \"o\" at the end. Thus, Studio, Piccolo, and Varianto. One notable Studio car was the Luigi Fagioli Auto Union Avus 'Streamline', built in 1937, which came in a detailed box, complete with tools. Only 1,000 were produced. Schuco 'Turn Back' cars had a metal pin sensor that made the car turn when approaching the edge of a table (King 1986, p. 173). Wooden pegs were actually provided with the toy so the car could be driven around them.\n\nThe Schuco 'Command 2000' car was voice activated, by speaking loudly or blowing through louvres in the roof, it would start or stop on command (MAAS n.d.).\n\nToy production was halted during the devastation of World War II. In the late 1940s, Schuco again began tin toy assembly – this time focusing a bit more on the broader European and international market. Tin toys were larger scale – in the neighborhood of 1:24 to 1:18. During the 1950s there was a shift to plastic (especially for larger scales) and diecast metal, introduced in the Piccolo series in 1958, became commonplace for models in the early 1970s. Model types were varied and continued to include remote control and wind-up toys. Toy scales were always widely varied starting with HO (1:87) up to a foot long or larger (about 1:12).\n\nPost-war cars during the 1950s mimicked real cars but were most often generic – some Schucos looked like Kaiser-Frazers, BMW 328s, Buick sedans, or Porsches, but these names were never used for the toys until the Mercedes Elektro Phanomenal was introduced in 1955. By the mid-1960s, most cars were given specific brand names of actual automobiles (see the gradual transformation in Knox 2002, pp. 30–49).\n\nThe Schuco Varianto wire-track system was introduced in 1951. The company's advertisements stated, \"The automatic traffic game featuring a new kind of wire track never seen before.\" The clockwork or battery-operated cars had a guide wheel on the underside that set within coiled wire tracks. The tracks could be arranged in various configurations of the owner's own design. Different plastic pieces could be linked with the wire track to create intersections and overpasses. The Varianto system was sold for fifteen years and was immensely popular as a much cheaper alternative to electric train sets, having similar features and limited in layout only by the owner's imagination (Keus No Date; Schuco Varianto 2011).\n\nEdward Force wrote that Schuco's first consistent foray into diecast toys was in 1958 when the 1:90 scale 'Piccolo' series was introduced (Force 1990, pp. 216, 219). These solid metal (and heavy) cars were accurate, yet mildly cartoonish at the same time. Piccolos were solid cast metal without plastic windows nor did they have interiors. Piccolos are highly collectible today, whether the original models or the later Schuco reproductions. More than 100 different Piccolos have been produced, some in many liveries, like the VW transporter van (Lilliput 2009).\n\nWith a windup key, the 1:45 scale Micro Racer cars would zip around, yet could also be pushed forward or backward without harming the wind-up mechanism. The \"micro\" name came from the \"micro\" – threaded steering which could be precisely adjusted (Lilliput 2009). 'Old Timers' had specialized clock-work motors. When wound up and in neutral, the cars would shake and vibrate. Shift the car into gear and off they roll – the direction chosen by how the steering wheel was turned (Sinclair's 1983). Examples of cars in this series were a Ford Model T, a Mercedes Simplex, or a Mercer 35J. In addition, remote, drive-by-wire \"telesteering\" was seen on earlier, larger scale cars.\n\nLarger cars made during the 1970s were equally impressive and usually focused on German products (Rixon 2005, p. 76). The 1:12 scale BMW 3.0 CSL Coupe in racing colors had switches to turn on and off head, tail and hazard lamps. A lever on the steering column operated the turn signals. The instrument panel was illuminated. The model had working steering (Sinclair 1976). A 1:16 scale Porsche 911 was cleverly equipped with an electric horn that sounded with two tones and a set of studded rally tires that could be placed on the vehicle after raising it with a functioning jack. The car, similar to the BMW, ran with a smooth electric motor forward and reverse and also had working steering (Sinclair's 1976). Schuco's 1:16 scale Formula 2 Brabham Ford BT33 and Formula 2 Ferrari were made in the early 1970s and very nicely detailed with many pressed metal pieces including very authentic looking wheels and tires. They had electric motors for both forward power and steering.\n\nModels in 1:43 scale (the 1000 series) were introduced in 1960. In 1971 and 1972, a new 1:43 scale was introduced (the 600 line) and the first 1:66 Matchbox-sized 300 series appeared. The smaller cars were called \"Super Schnell\" (Super Fast), which after translation from German seems essentially identical to the wording used by Matchbox. As seen, other diecast and remote control vehicles were sometimes much larger.\n\nSchuco's diecast 1:43 scale line in the 1970s was extremely precise in detail with near perfect proportion to the real cars. Usually all features opened. Paint application seemed more refined and not as thick as with British Corgis and Dinkys. As might be expected, most models were German makes: Volkswagen, Porsche, Audi, Mercedes-Benz, and BMW.\n\nAccurate replication was as good as Solido and the earlier Politoys M series, and better than most Gamas or Conrads. Precision was perhaps on par with later NZG Mercedes and Porsche promotionals. Also, similar to Solido, Schuco avoided the attractive but less realistic jewels for head and tail lights. Alas, when the company comes up with near-perfect models – financial troubles arrive (Force 1990, p. 210).\n\nSome of the popular Schuco toy lines (often ending in -o) have been:\nCommand Car, Magico Series, Radio Series, Patent Series, Piccolo Series, Fex 1111, Mirako Series, Telesteering cars, Examinco Series, Akustico Series, Ingenico Series, Elektro Phanomenal, Dally cars, Grand Prix Racers, Studio series, Varianto System, Old Timers, Micro Racers, Motorcycle range, Elektro Radiant Airplanes.\n\nSchuco went bankrupt in 1976. An English company Dunbee-Combex-Marx (DCM) acquired Schuco (or large parts of it), but it too went bankrupt in 1980. Eventually, rival German toymaker Gama Toys, acquired the rights to Schuco in the mid 1980s, and, for a time, new Gama Toys were 1:43 scale Schucos put directly into Gama boxes – with no name change on the base of the vehicle. Whether these were newly cast cars with no change in lettering, or leftover stock is uncertain. In the U.S. during the 1980s, Schuco toys were marketed by the Lilliput Motor Company of Yerington, Nevada, with the Lilliput name appearing prominently on the colorful Schuco-style boxes (Johnson 1998, p. 210)\n\nEdward Force writes that about the time of the Gama purchase, Schuco dies were sold off to many other companies in different countries (Force 1990, pp. 218–219). Some even appeared with \"Made in Russia\" on their bases. The MIR Toy factory in Mir, Bulgaria (later to become Mikro'67 (see website link below), reproduced at least 16 different Schuco vehicles through the 1990s, in several colors. Sometimes they were packaged with \"Made in Germany\" still marked on their bases – but after a time this labeling was removed. Some Schuco model castings then appeared as Gamas; some went to France and became Norevs, and some went to Brazil and were sold by Rei (Force 1990, p. 218).\n\nIn 1993 Gama-Schuco combined with Trix, a maker of small ('N') scale trains, and a company previously associated with Märklin. In 1996, Schuco became independent again and saw a revival, producing a wide variety of collectible models, with many newly designed castings, but many being exact replicas of earlier lines.\n\nIn 1999, Schuco was acquired by the Simba Dickie Group and model boxes were labeled with stickers saying \"Dickie Schuco\" even if it was old inventory. Simba Dickie had previously absorbed Smoby which had previously purchased French Majorette which in turn had acquired Solido. Majorette and Solido were apparently spun off, but by 2009, Schuco was healthy enough to acquire Schabak.\n\nToday Schuco makes a variety of models (mainly street vehicles) in different scales. There are classic and newer lines, all accurately detailed. For example, the classic BMW 2000 sedan has a multi-colored interior, very tiny logo decals on the centers of the wheels, and more realistic clear plastic lights. One author wrote that the Schuco 2000's appearance was crisp because there were no opening features – which often causes the mismatching of body panels (Doty 1999, 88–89). The company also became involved, in the early 2000s, in the production of promotional models for GM (Opel and Vauxhall) in 1:43 scale. These were done in authentic GM colors and interior styles with authentic dark flat gray window trim (Rixon 2005, p. 64). Changes in the parent company caused the name to change to Dickie Spielzeug GmbH (Schuco milestones 2016). Under Dickie, the quality of the models is superior to the average toy model vehicles, therefore unit prices are higher as well.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1879056", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1879056", "title": "Clan Hay", "text": "Clan Hay\n\nClan Hay is a Scottish clan that has played an important part in the history and politics of Scotland. Members of the clan are to be found in most parts of Scotland and in many other parts of the world. However, the North East of Scotland, i.e. Aberdeenshire (historic), Banffshire, Morayshire and Nairnshire Nairn (boundaries), is the heart of Hay country with other significant concentrations of Hays being found in Perthshire, especially around Perth, in the Scottish Borders, and in Shetland.\n\nThe family name is derived from that of several villages called \"La Haye\" in the Cotentin Peninsula of Normandy, France. The word, \"haye\" comes from \"haia\", a hedge, which in modern French is \"haie\". It can also mean \"stockade\", but it may have been used here because this part of Normandy is characterized by centuries-old interlocking hedgerows (bocage). The French, \"de la Haye\", appears in Latin documents as \"de Haya\". The name has evolved into English as \"Hay\" and rendered into Gaelic as \"Garadh\". According to George Fraser Black, the Gaelic form of \"Hay\", \"MacGaradh\", was merely an invention of John Hay Allan, also known as John Sobieski Stuart, author of the dubious \"Vestiarium Scoticum\".\n\nThere are two ways to approach the origins of Clan Hay. The first is the Legend of Luncarty, which is an important Hay tradition, while the second is based on historical research, albeit that inconsistencies tend to occur after so many centuries.\nHector Boece, the Scottish academic, wrote the first known account of the Luncarty legend in his \"Scotorium Historia\", which was initially published in 1525, with a second edition being published posthumously in 1575. There are numerous versions of the legend that are based upon Boece's work but which include various embellishments. In contrast, George Buchanan’s account in his \"Rerum Scoticarum Historia\", published in 1582 and derived from Boece’s work, omits any reference to the hawk’s flight delineating the land grant. In 2010, Sutton published a hypertext edition, in both Latin and English, of Boece’s 1575 edition of the Historia, thus providing ready access to his original account of the legend. The version of the legend quoted below is from John Burke's \"Peerage\", 1832 edition.\n\n\"The traditional origin of the noble house of Hay is thus related:—In the reign of Kenneth III, anno 980, the Danes, who had invaded Scotland, having prevailed, at the battle of Luncarty, near Perth, were pursuing the flying Scots, from the field, when a countryman and his two sons appeared in a narrow pass, through which the vanquished were hurrying, and impeded for a moment their flight. \"\"What,\"\" said the rustic, \"\"had you rather be slaughtered by your merciless foes, than die honorably in the field; come, rally, rally!\"\" and he headed the fugitives, brandishing his ploughshare, and crying out, that help was at hand: the Danes, believing that a fresh army was falling upon them, fled in confusion, and the Scots thus recovered the laurel which they had lost, and freed their country from servitude. The battle being won, the old man, afterwards known by the name of Hay, was brought to the king, who, assembling a parliament at Scone, gave to the said Hay and his sons, as a just reward for their valour, so much land on the river Tay, in the district of Gowrie, as a falcon from a man's hand flew over till it settled; which being six miles in length, was afterwards called Errol; and the king being desirous to elevate Hay and his sons from their humble rank in life, to the order of nobility, his majesty assigned them a coat of arms, which was argent, three escutcheons, gules, to intimate that the father and two sons had been the three fortunate shields of Scotland.\"\n\nThe reliability of the legend has often been challenged. For instance, the Scottish historian John Hill Burton strongly suspected the battle of Luncarty to be an invention of Hector Boece, Burton was incorrect. Walter Bower, writing in his Scotichronicon around 1440, some 87 years before Boece first published his \"Scotorum Historia\", refers to the battle briefly as follows:\n\n\"“that remarkable battle of Luncarty, in which the Norsemen with their king were totally destroyed”.\"\nBower does not quote specific sources concerning the battle, but, two sentences later, he refers generally to ancient writings that he has consulted. The term Norsemen would include Danes.\n\nThe evidence that the battle actually occurred, other than Bower's brief reference to it about 1440 AD, was described by Reverend Moncrieff around 1791 in the First Statistical Accounts of Scotland. He witnessed the opening of the last remaining tumuli (burial mounds) on the reputed battlefield and describes the finding of human remains, including ashes and bones, together with weapons and bridles. These were not examined by professional archaeologists to determine whether they were consistent with the presumed date of the battle, as they would have been had the retrieval occurred in modern times. Moreover, the artifacts would not have been allowed to have been taken by local inhabitants, one of whom made farming implements of some of them. Similarly, the retrieval predated the use of radiocarbon dating techniques which would have dated the remains with considerable accuracy. Moncrieff also emphasizes the strong tradition of the battle among the local inhabitants; one individual, whose family had lived in the area for generations, could describe the battle as if it occurred yesterday. Two local names provide further evidence of the battle. First, the reputed battle site is located in Redgorton Parish. The name means red fields, perhaps fields of blood, and stretches back for centuries. Second, Turnagain Hillock is where the Danes are said to have been repulsed.\n\nIt is noteworthy that there is a discrepancy concerning the reputed date of the battle, 980 AD, and the identity of the king who led the Scots in the battle. He is invariably identified as Kenneth III of Scotland, but he reigned from 997 to 1005 AD; Kenneth II of Scotland reigned from 971-995 AD.\n\nRegarding the legend, Sir James Balfour Paul, noting that armorial bearings did not occur in Scotland till long after 980 (when the battle is said to have taken place), referred to Hector Boece as \"an incorrigible old liar\" in this and other stories.[27]. Cosmo Innes, further noting that surnames did not occur in Scotland till long after 980, states that the name Hay has as origin a place name in Normandy. This last point is discussed in the section, Origin of the Name, of this article.\n\nClan Hay descends from the Norman family of de la Haye (de Haya). The progenitors of the Scottish clan were William II de Haya and his wife, Eva of Pitmilly William II de Haya was the son of William I de Haya and his Norman wife, Juliana de Soulis, sister to Ranulf I de Soules. He was the first recorded Hay in Scotland, is known to have been in the Scottish court in 1160, was cup-bearer to Malcolm IV of Scotland and William I of Scotland, and was made the first Baron of Erroll by William I. He died soon after 1201 and was succeeded by his eldest son, David.\n\nThe origins of the Hays of Erroll were investigated around 1954 by Wagner who presented evidence, based largely on heraldry, that the Scottish Hays were descended from de La Haye of La Haye-Hue in the Cotentin Peninsula of Normandy. That evidence begins with a seal used by David de Haya (Haia), the son of William II de Haya, on a charter around 1230. It shows the arms of argent three inescutcheons gules, i.e., a silver shield containing three smaller red shields, and are the same arms presently used by the Earl of Erroll. They bear no resemblance to those of the de La Haye of England, but they are the same as those used by Jean de La Haye-Hue in Normandy around 1368–1375.\n\nThe de La Haye of La Haye Hue can be traced back to the 12th century, that is, when William II de Haya was first known to be in Scotland. Wagner therefore concluded that the Hays of Erroll and the Hayes of La Haye were related. He also pointed out that the Hays were linked to the powerful Normandy family of Soulis Ranulf I de Soules in that La Haye-Hue, now called La Haye-Bellefond, is located just across the small Soules River from Soulles, the seat of that family. Secondly, the Soulis name, rare in England, and the more common Hay, are both found in the records of Dover castle in the early 13th century.\n\nA third point, which Wagner did not mention, is that William I de Haya married Juliana de Soulis and these two were the parents of William II de Haya.\n\nDavid de Haya, who wedded Helen, daughter of Gilbert (or Gille Brigte), Earl of Strathearn, and had:\n\nGilbert, who succeeded his father at Erroll, was Sheriff of Perth before 1262. He was appointed one of the regents and guardians to King Alexander III. He married Idonea, daughter of William Comyn, Earl of Buchan, and had a son, Nicolas.\n\nHis son, Nicolas de Haya of Erroll was Sheriff of Perth before 1288. He swore fealty to King Edward I on 12 July 1296. He was summoned by Edward I to attend parliament at St. Andrews in 1303–04. He had four sons:\n\n\nThe son, Gilbert swore fealty to Edward I at Aberdeen in 1296. However, in 1306 he joined Robert the Bruce and continued faithfully to him throughout the War of Independence. Gilbert supported the Bruce at the victory of the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314. In consequence Edward I declared Gilbert a traitor, but Robert the Bruce rewarded him with a charter over the lands of Slains in Aberdeenshire and the office of Constable of the realm of Scotland. Gilbert de la Hay was also a signatory to the Declaration of Arbroath, 1320 .\n\nDuring the Anglo-Scottish Wars the Clan Hay suffered very heavy casualties in the Battle of Flodden in 1513. Another Hay, also named Sir Gilbert, was a Scottish knight who fought for Joan of Arc during the Hundred Years' War.\n\nFollowing the Reformation, the Hays remained loyal to Catholicism and thus were allies to Mary, Queen of Scots, who appointed George Hay, the 7th Earl of Erroll, Lord Lieutenant of all central Scotland. Francis Hay, 9th Earl of Erroll, was involved in a conspiracy with King Philip II of Spain, to overthrow Queen Elizabeth of England, convert King James VI to Catholicism and thus make Britain a Catholic stronghold. With the defeat of the Spanish Armada, however, the conspiracy came to nothing. In 1594 the Earl of Errol went into exile and Slains Castle was blown up under the supervision of the king, and has remained a ruin ever since.\n\nDuring the Civil War James Hay led his forces as Royalists against the Covenanters at the Battle of Aberdeen in 1644, where they were victorious. Sir William Hay of Delgaite served with James Graham, 1st Marquis of Montrose as his chief of staff during his campaign in support of Charles I of England. However Hay was captured, imprisoned and then executed in 1650, although he was given a state funeral after the Restoration of 1660.\n\nFollowing the Act of Union in 1707, the Hays were sympathetic to the Jacobite cause. The Clan Hay remained loyal to the Stuarts in both the Jacobite rising of 1715 and the Jacobite rising of 1745. The 13th Earl of Errol received the Order of the Thistle from James Francis Edward Stuart (the \"Old Pretender\"). He was succeeded by his sister, Mary, who used the ruins of their fortress of Old Slains Castle as meeting point for Jacobite agents and it was she who personally called out the Clan Hay to fight for Charles Edward Stuart.\n\nWith the collapse of Jacobitism, the Hays became loyal British subjects, and many Hays were involved in expanding the British Empire.\n\n\n\n\n\nLow country pairtes (Lowland Clans)\n\n\n\n\n(This information is incomplete, with the hay clan's utter most descendants having relations to the Wyllie-Gunn's, withholding facts.\n"}

{"id": "1879093", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1879093", "title": "Mamertus", "text": "Mamertus\n\nSaint Mamertus (died c. 475) was the bishop of Vienne in Gaul, venerated as a saint. His primary contribution to ecclesiastical practice was the introduction of litanies prior to Ascension Day as an intercession against earthquakes and other disasters, leading to \"Rogation Days.\" His feast day is the first of the Ice Saints.\n\nPrior to his elevation to the see of Vienne, little has been recorded about Mamertus' life. The fact that his brother, Claudianus Mamertus, the theological writer, received in his youth a sound training in rhetoric, and enjoyed the personal acquaintance of Bishop Eucherius of Lyons (434-50), suggests that the brothers belonged to a wealthy Gallic family from the neighbourhood of Lyons. Like his brother, St Mamertus was distinguished for his secular learning as well as theology, and, before his elevation to the episcopate, appears to have been married.\nHis election and consecration took place shortly before 462. As bishop he enlisted the services of his brother, who had withdrawn to a cloister, and ordained him priest of Vienne. The activity of the brothers is described in one letter of Sidonius Apollinaris, while another is addressed to Bishop Mamertus.\nIn 463, Mamertus was engaged in a dispute with Pope Hilarius on the question of the privileges of the Bishop of Arles. Pope Leo I had regulated the boundaries of the ecclesiastical provinces of Arles and Vienne: under the latter he left the Dioceses of Valence, Tarentaise, Geneva and Grenoble, but all the other dioceses in this district were made subordinate to Arles. Regardless of this decision and infringing on the rights of his colleague of Arles, Mamertus consecrated in 463 a bishop for the city of Die (Dea). King Gundioc of the Burgundians complained to Pope Hilary of this action, whereupon the latter wrote to Bishop Leontius of Arles on 10 October 463, bidding him summon a synod of bishops from the different provinces to enquire into the matter. In a subsequent letter to the bishops of the Roman provinces of Lyons, Vienne, Narbonnensis I and II and Alpina, he also refers to the matter, and directs them to obey Leontius's summons to a regularly constituted synod. The synod decided against Mamertus, as we learn from another letter of the pope dated 25 February, 464. In this letter, St Hilary declares that Mamertus and the bishop unlawfully consecrated by him should really be deposed; desiring, however that clemency be used, he commissioned Bishop Veranus to inform Mamertus that, if he did not recognize and submit to the regulations of Pope Leo, he would be deprived also of the four suffragan dioceses, still subject to Vienne. The bishop invalidly installed by Mamertus was to be confirmed in his office by Leontius, after which he might retain the bishopric. Mamertus evidently submitted, since we find no subsequent reference to the incident. \n\nDuring his episcopate, the remains of St. Ferreolus were discovered, and were translated by Mamertus to a church in Vienne, built in honour of that martyr. St. Mamertus was the founder of the Rogation Processions, according to Sidonius Apollinaris, and his second successor, Avitus In connexion with these intercessory processions, Mamertus summoned a synod at Vienne between 471 and 475. About 475 he attended a synod at Arles, which dealt with the predestination teaching of Lucidus, a Gallic priest. As this is the latest information we possess concerning him, we may assume that he died shortly afterwards.\n\nWilliam of Auxerre (d. 1231) says that Mamertus instituted the litanies after \"a plague of wolves. For just as is told in the Gospel, that demons, by God's permission and on account of the sins of men, entered pigs, similarly they entered wolves in order to hurt and kill people better, not only in villages but even in cities.\"\n\nAfter his death he was venerated as a saint. Saint Mamertus' name stands in the \"Martyrologium Hieronymianum\" and in the \"Martyrologium\" of Florus of Lyons under May 11, on which day his liturgical feast day is still celebrated (Henri Quentin, \"Les martyrologes historiques\", 348) in the Roman Catholic Church.\n"}

As president of the Texas State Historical Association, he launched the project that produced the \"Handbook of Texas\". He is also noted for his early criticism of the water usage patterns in the region. In 2012, he was inducted into the Hall of Great Westerners of the National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum.\n\nWebb was reared on his family farm in Carthage in rural Panola County, Texas. After graduating from Ranger High School in Ranger in Eastland County, he earned a teaching certificate and taught at several Texas schools. He eventually attended the University of Texas at Austin and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in 1915 at the age of twenty-seven. He worked as bookkeeper in San Marcos and optometrist's assistant in San Antonio, then in 1918 he was invited to join the history faculty at the University of Texas. He wrote his Master of Arts thesis on the Texas Rangers in 1920 and was encouraged to pursue his PhD. After a year of study at the University of Chicago, he returned to Austin, where he began a historical work on the West. The result of this work was \"The Great Plains\", published in 1931, hailed as great breakthrough in the interpretation of the history of the region, and declared the outstanding contribution to American history since World War I by the Social Science Research Council in 1939. He was awarded his PhD for his work on \"The Great Plains\" in 1932, the year after its publication.\n\nIn 1939–1946 he served as president of the Texas State Historical Association. During his tenure as president, he launched a project to produce an encyclopedia of Texas, which was subsequently published in 1952 as the \"Handbook of Texas\". The world wide web version of the work is a popular Internet reference tool on the state. In all, Webb wrote or edited more than 20 books. One of them, \"The Texas Rangers\" (1935) was considered the definitive study of the legendary Texas Rangers and its Captain Bill McDonald.\n\nIn 1958 Webb served as president of the American Historical Association.\nWebb's father-in-law was the Confederate States Army veteran and Austin, Texas-based photographer William J. Oliphant (1845–1930).\n\nWebb was killed in an automobile accident near Austin. He was interred at Texas State Cemetery in Austin on the proclamation of then Governor John B. Connally, Jr. At the time of his death he was working on a television series on American civilization under a grant from the Ford Foundation.\n\nIn his honor the University of Texas established the Walter Prescott Webb Chair of History and Ideas. The position is currently held by Philippa Levine. Webb Middle School in Austin, Texas is also named after him.\n\nRundell (1963) has examined Webb's main books to see what inspired and prompted the writing of each, what the purpose and message of each seems to be, and Webb's emergent philosophy of history. The professional reception of these studies was also considered. The message of \"The Great Plains\" (1931) is contained in its subtitle 'A Study in Institutions and Environment.' Its primary purpose was to present representative ideas about the region rather than to write its history. Webb called the settled area of Europe 'the Metropolis' and the rest of the world 'the Great Frontier', claiming that \"the Great Plains environment... constitutes a geographic unity whose influences have \nbeen so powerful as to put a characteristic mark upon everything that survives within its borders\", pointing to the revolver, barbed wire, and the windmill as essential to its settlement. He claims that the 98th meridian constitutes an \"institutional fault\", with \"practically every institution that was carried across it... either broken and remade or else greatly altered\". The book was hailed as one of the top contributions to Am. history since World War I by the Social Science Research Council in 1939.\n\nWebb's \"The Texas Rangers\" (1935) was a pungent and learned treatment of a frontier institution, but is regarded by many modern historians as an apologia for border violence perpetuated by Rangers against Mexican-Americans. The economic domination of the North, through the tariff, Civil War pensions, and patent monopolies, and the development of the centralized economy dominated by 200 major corporations (over the South and West, which contained the largest share of natural resources) was the theme of \"Divided We Stand\" (1937).\n\n\"More Water for Texas\" (1954) popularized and vitalized a federal study of what he regarded as the most serious problem of his state. The Webb thesis focused on the fragility of the Western environment, pointing out the aridity of the territory and the dangers of an industrialized West.\n\nIn 1951 Webb published \"The Great Frontier\", proposing the Boom Hypothesis, that the new lands discovered by Christopher Columbus in 1492 ran out by 1900, closing the frontier and giving the U.S. economic and ecological problems, threatening the future of individualism, capitalism, and democracy. The book caused a firestorm of controversy.\n\n\"O'Har\" (2006) shows that in his classic interdisciplinary history of the post-Civil War West, Webb develops dominant characteristics of the Great Plains – treelessness, level terrain, and semiaridity – and examines effect on the lives of people from very different environments. To succeed, pioneers made radical readjustments in their way of life, eschewed traditions, and altered social institutions. Webb believed what set the Great Plains apart from other regions was its individualism, innovation, democracy, and lawlessness, themes he derived from the Frontier Thesis of Frederick Jackson Turner. His focus is said to have missed the emergence of a national empire, and others criticize him for failing to acknowledge the roles played by women, Indians, and Mexicans.\n\nWebb was an esteemed historian when he wrote an article in the May 1957 edition of \"Harper's\" entitled \"The American West, Perpetual Mirage\". In the article, Webb criticized U.S. water policy in the West, stating that the region was \"a semidesert with a desert heart\", and that it was a national folly to continue to follow the current federal policy (managed through the United States Bureau of Reclamation) of attempting to convert the region into productive cropland through irrigation. Webb's criticism of federal policy was roundly rebuked at the time, but some contemporary critics of U.S. water policy regard him as prophetic in his views.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

In 1998, it acquired Casino Magic Corp. for $340 million, including two casinos in Mississippi, one in Louisiana and a controlling stake in two casinos in Argentina.\n\nThe company sold the Hollywood Park racetrack in 1999 to Churchill Downs, Inc. and in 2000 changed its name to Pinnacle Entertainment. Belterra Casino Resort & Spa made its debut in 2000 as Pinnacle's first company-designed and developed gaming resort. Then in 2005, Pinnacle opened L'Auberge du Lac in Lake Charles, Louisiana.\n\nIn September 2006, Pinnacle agreed to purchase the Sands Casino Hotel in Atlantic City, New Jersey and announced plans to replace it with a $1.5-billion resort. The property closed on November 11, 2006 and was demolished on October 18, 2007. Harsh economic times later caused Pinnacle to delay construction of the new resort. In February 2010, the company announced that it had canceled its construction plans and would instead seek to sell the land. Eventually it was sold in 2013 for $29.5 million to a group of local developers who planned to build a casino or family entertainment attraction.\n\nIn December 2006, Pinnacle purchased the President Casino in St. Louis, Missouri.\n\nLumière Place opened in downtown St. Louis in December 2007, anchoring an entertainment district including the Four Seasons Hotel St. Louis and HoteLumière. In March 2010, Pinnacle opened River City Casino, in Lemay, Missouri. Pinnacle announced the expansion of its L’Auberge Baton Rouge project in September 2010 and held a grand opening on September 1, 2012.\n\nOn November 9, 2009, chief executive officer Dan Lee was forced out by the company's board of directors after reportedly physically confronting and threatening a St. Louis County official.\n\nIn July 2010, the company sold its Argentina casinos for $40 million.\n\nIn January 2011, Pinnacle purchased River Downs Racetrack in southeast Cincinnati.\n\nThe company agreed in April 2012 to buy a 75.5% stake in Retama Park, a money-losing horse track in Selma, Texas, for $22.8 million. The purchase was seen as a \"defensive move\" to help soften the blow if gaming in Texas were expanded and drew visitors away from Pinnacle's Lake Charles properties.\n\nIn May 2011, Pinnacle expanded into the Asian gaming market with a $95-million investment for 26 percent ownership of Asian Coast Development Ltd., the owner and developer of the Ho Tram Strip, 80 miles away from Ho Chi Minh City in southern Vietnam, which will be the country’s first large-scale integrated destination resort. Upon the closing of the transaction, Pinnacle would enter into a management agreement through 2058 for the second integrated resort on the Ho Tram Strip.\n\nOn June 26, 2012, Pinnacle sold Boomtown Reno for $12.9 million to M1 Gaming, the company of former Station Casinos executive Dean DiLullo.\n\nOn August 14, 2013, Pinnacle bought Ameristar Casinos for $869 million plus $1.9 billion in assumed debt, adding nine properties in Colorado, Indiana, Iowa, Missouri, Mississippi and Northern Nevada. To gain FTC approval for the merger, Pinnacle agreed to sell its Lumiere Place property and Ameristar's under-construction casino in Lake Charles.\n\nIn November 2014, Pinnacle announced a plan to spin-off a real estate investment trust with the real estate assets of its 15 casinos. Gaming and Leisure Properties (GLPI) then approached Pinnacle with an offer to buy those assets, which it said would be simpler and faster than Pinnacle's plan. Pinnacle did not respond to the offer, so GLPI went public with its offer in March 2015. In July, the companies reached a deal for GLPI to buy 14 of Pinnacle's 15 properties for $4.75 billion in stock, and lease them back to Pinnacle, with rent starting at $377 million per year. The sale would be executed by Pinnacle spinning off a new company, also named Pinnacle Entertainment, with the casinos' operating businesses, along with ownership of Belterra Park (formerly River Downs) and the company's interest in Retama Park; GLPI would then acquire the original Pinnacle Entertainment. The sale was completed in April 2016. Pinnacle also purchased the operations of The Meadows Racetrack and Casino in Pennsylvania from GLPI for $138 million in September 2016.\n\nIn December 2017, Pinnacle agreed to be acquired by Penn National Gaming for $2.8 billion in cash and stock. To ensure regulatory approval for the deal, Pinnacle would sell the operations of four properties to Boyd Gaming for $575 million prior to the merger: Ameristar Kansas City, Ameristar St. Charles, Belterra Casino, and Belterra Park. The real estate of Belterra Park was originally to be sold to GLPI, but was ultimately sold to Boyd for $58 million. The transactions were completed on October 15, 2018.\n\nAt the time of its acquisition, the company operated the following properties:\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1879108", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1879108", "title": "Beck Depression Inventory", "text": "Beck Depression Inventory\n\nThe Beck Depression Inventory (BDI, BDI-1A, BDI-II), created by Aaron T. Beck, is a 21-question multiple-choice self-report inventory, one of the most widely used psychometric tests for measuring the severity of depression. Its development marked a shift among mental health professionals, who had until then, viewed depression from a psychodynamic perspective, instead of it being rooted in the patient's own thoughts.\n\nIn its current version, the BDI-II is designed for individuals aged 13 and over, and is composed of items relating to symptoms of depression such as hopelessness and irritability, cognitions such as guilt or feelings of being punished, as well as physical symptoms such as fatigue, weight loss, and lack of interest in sex.\n\nThere are three versions of the BDI—the original BDI, first published in 1961 and later revised in 1978 as the BDI-1A, and the BDI-II, published in 1996. The BDI is widely used as an assessment tool by health care professionals and researchers in a variety of settings.\n\nThe BDI was used as a model for the development of the Children's Depression Inventory (CDI), first published in 1979 by clinical psychologist Maria Kovacs.\n\nAccording to Beck's publisher, 'When Beck began studying depression in the 1950s, the prevailing psychoanalytic theory attributed the syndrome to inverted hostility against the self.' By contrast, the BDI was developed in a novel way for its time; by collating patients' verbatim descriptions of their symptoms and then using these to structure a scale which could reflect the intensity or severity of a given symptom.\n\nBeck drew attention to the importance of \"negative cognitions\" described as sustained, inaccurate, and often intrusive negative thoughts about the self. In his view, it was the case that these cognitions \"caused\" depression, rather than being generated \"by\" depression.\n\nBeck developed a triad of negative cognitions about the world, the future, and the self, which play a major role in depression.\nAn example of the triad in action taken from Brown (1995) is the case of a student obtaining poor exam results:\n\nThe development of the BDI reflects that in its structure, with items such as \"I have lost all of my interest in other people\" to reflect the world, \"I feel discouraged about the future\" to reflect the future, and \"I blame myself for everything bad that happens\" to reflect the self. The view of depression as sustained by intrusive negative cognitions has had particular application in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), which aims to challenge and neutralize them through techniques such as cognitive restructuring.\n\nThe original BDI, first published in 1961, consisted of twenty-one questions about how the subject has been feeling in the last week. Each question had a set of at least four possible responses, ranging in intensity. For example:\n\n\nWhen the test is scored, a value of 0 to 3 is assigned for each answer and then the total score is compared to a key to determine the depression's severity. The standard cut-off scores were as follows: \nHigher total scores indicate more severe depressive symptoms.\n\nSome items on the original BDI had more than one statement marked with the same score. For instance, there are two responses under the Mood heading that score a 2: (2a) \"I am blue or sad all the time and I can't snap out of it\" and (2b) \"I am so sad or unhappy that it is very painful\".\n\nThe BDI-IA was a revision of the original instrument developed by Beck during the 1970s, and copyrighted in 1978. To improve ease of use, the \"\"a\" and \"b\" statements\" described above were removed, and respondents were instructed to endorse how they had been feeling during the preceding two weeks. The internal consistency for the BDI-IA was good, with a Cronbach's alpha coefficient of around 0.85, meaning that the items on the inventory are highly correlated with each other.\n\nHowever, this version retained some flaws; the BDI-IA only addressed six out of the nine DSM-III criteria for depression. This and other criticisms were addressed in the BDI-II.\n\nThe BDI-II was a 1996 revision of the BDI, developed in response to the American Psychiatric Association's publication of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, which changed many of the diagnostic criteria for Major Depressive Disorder.\n\nItems involving changes in body image, hypochondriasis, and difficulty working were replaced. Also, sleep loss and appetite loss items were revised to assess both increases and decreases in sleep and appetite. All but three of the items were reworded; only the items dealing with feelings of being punished, thoughts about suicide, and interest in sex remained the same. Finally, participants were asked to rate how they have been feeling for the past two weeks, as opposed to the past week as in the original BDI.\n\nLike the BDI, the BDI-II also contains 21 questions, each answer being scored on a scale value of 0 to 3. Higher total scores indicate more severe depressive symptoms. The standardized cutoffs used differ from the original: \n\nOne measure of an instrument's usefulness is to see how closely it agrees with another similar instrument that has been validated against information from a clinical interview by a trained clinician. In this respect, the BDI-II is positively correlated with the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale with a Pearson r of 0.71, showing good agreement. The test was also shown to have a high one-week test–retest reliability (Pearson r =0.93), suggesting that it was not overly sensitive to daily variations in mood. The test also has high internal consistency (α=.91).\n\nThe development of the BDI was an important event in psychiatry and psychology; it represented a shift in health care professionals' view of depression from a Freudian, psychodynamic perspective, to one guided by the patient's own thoughts or \"cognitions\". It also established the principle that instead of attempting to develop a psychometric tool based on a possibly invalid theory, self-report questionnaires when analysed using techniques such as factor analysis can suggest theoretical constructs.\n\nThe BDI was originally developed to provide a quantitative assessment of the intensity of depression. Because it is designed to reflect the depth of depression, it can monitor changes over time and provide an objective measure for judging improvement and the effectiveness or otherwise of treatment methods. The instrument remains widely used in research; in 1998, it had been used in over 2000 empirical studies. It has been translated into multiple European languages as well as Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, Persian, and Xhosa.\n\nThe BDI suffers from the same problems as other self-report inventories, in that scores can be easily exaggerated or minimized by the person completing them. Like all questionnaires, the way the instrument is administered can have an effect on the final score. If a patient is asked to fill out the form in front of other people in a clinical environment, for instance, social expectations have been shown to elicit a different response compared to administration via a postal survey.\n\nIn participants with concomitant physical illness the BDI's reliance on physical symptoms such as fatigue may artificially inflate scores due to symptoms of the illness, rather than of depression. In an effort to deal with this concern Beck and his colleagues developed the \"Beck Depression Inventory for Primary Care\" (BDI-PC), a short screening scale consisting of seven items from the BDI-II considered to be independent of physical function. Unlike the standard BDI, the BDI-PC produces only a binary outcome of \"not depressed\" or \"depressed\" for patients above a cutoff score of 4.\n\nAlthough designed as a screening device rather than a diagnostic tool, the BDI is sometimes used by health care providers to reach a quick diagnosis.\n\nThe BDI is copyrighted; a fee must be paid for each copy used. There is no evidence that the BDI-II is more valid or reliable than other depression scales, and public domain scales such as the Patient Health Questionnaire – Nine Item (PHQ-9) have been studied as a useful tool.\n\n\n\n"}

The arena is named for philanthropists John Petersen and his wife Gertrude, who donated $10 million for its construction. John Petersen, a Pitt alumnus, is a native of nearby Erie and is the retired President and CEO of Erie Insurance Group. The Petersen Events Center was winner of the 2003 Innovative Architecture & Design Honor Award from \"Recreation Management\" magazine.\n\nThe arena opened in 2002 on part of the former site of Pitt Stadium, which housed the university's football team from 1925 to 1999. The Pitt men's and women's basketball programs make their home here, previously residing in Fitzgerald Field House. The new building, due to its larger capacity, also meant that Pitt no longer had to play certain games or hold graduation ceremonies at the Civic Arena.\n\nIts first event was a Counting Crows concert. For concerts the Center seats 9,000 for end-stage shows, 14,763 for center-stage shows. The first official women's basketball game at the Pete was a 90-51 win over Robert Morris University on November 22, 2002. The first official men's basketball game at the Pete was an 82-67 win over Duquesne University on November 23, 2002. Since its creation through the end of the 2012-13 season, the Pitt men's basketball team has compiled a record of 180–22 (.891) at the Pete, including a 9-1 record against teams ranked in the top five. Pitt broke the 100 win mark on November 22, 2008 with an 86-60 win over Indiana University of Pennsylvania, and the 200 win mark on December 30, 2014 vs Florida Gulf Coast.\n\nIn 2006, the Pittsburgh Xplosion, a professional basketball team in the Continental Basketball Association, played its first game at the arena. The team folded just prior to the start of the 2008-09 season.\n\nIn October 2011, a new high definition video board was installed in the Petersen Events Center.\n\nSince 2010, the Petersen Events Center has been used as the primary alternative to the much larger PPG Paints Arena, which replaced Mellon Arena, and is now the Pittsburgh home of Disney on Ice, Marvel Universe Live! and the Big3, and hosted the Ringling Brothers Barnum and Bailey Circus in its final years.\n\nWith 430,000 total square feet, the Pete seats 12,508 for basketball and 9,000 for end stage concerts. The arena features of lobby space with high ceilings and of glass with a barely visible coating that allows sunlight through while controlling heat loss and gain. A video score board that had previous hung in Pitt Stadium was also installed in the lobby. The arena also features 18 luxury suites, including five courtside luxury suites (the only college arena with courtside suites) and a 193-seat SuperSuite.\n\nThe section known as the Oakland Zoo is composed of the sections across from the team benches and next to the court. The name comes from Oakland, the neighborhood where Pitt's campus resides. The students in the Zoo wear gold T-shirts with the words \"Oakland Zoo\" in some way, shape or form across the front. This layout and unity is a large factor in why the Pete is such a tough place to play for opposing teams. In fact, Pitt has lost only five home non-conference games out of over 120 since the Panthers moved into the Pete in 2002.\n\nIn 2006, \"Sports Illustrated\" surveyed the Big East Conference's basketball players, and the Pete was named the \"Toughest Place to Play,\" with specific players mentioning the Oakland Zoo and the fans' creativity. In 2013, the facility was also ranked as having the second best game time environment in the nation by \"USA Today\".\n\nThe Petersen Events Center also has received accolades for being the sixth loudest college basketball venue according to \"ESPN the Magazine\", the eighth best overall college basketball venue according to ESPN's Jason King, and among the toughest places for opponents to play in college basketball according to multiple Bleacher Report articles. The Pitt men's basketball team has also sold out of season tickets since the venue opened.\n\nIn 2007 and 2010, \"The Pete\" hosted first and second-round games of the NCAA Women's Division I Tournament.\n\nThe Petersen Events Center serves as more than just the home court of the Panthers basketball teams. Located within the facility is a Baierl Student Recreation Center featuring four racquetball courts, two squash courts, Cybex weight machines, a free weight area, aerobics practice room, martial arts room, health assessment area, and aerobic area with treadmills, exercise bikes, elliptical and Stairmaster machines and four plasma TVs.\n\nIn addition, the McCarl Panthers Hall of Champions, which pays homage to and displays memorabilia from past Pitt athletics achievements, and the official Pittsburgh Panthers Team Store are located in the main lobby of the Pete.\n\nAlso included is the Willis Center for Academics for student athletes which includes computer and writing labs, a math and science area, individual tutor rooms, and a career resource area.\n\nAlso, a food court is located within the Pete and is available to students and others during the weekdays in addition to when events are being hosted within the arena.\n\nThe arena also features and auxiliary practice basketball facility, athletic training, office and media facilities.\n\nThe Pete also hosts the University's commencement ceremony.\n\nOn Wednesday October 23, 2019, All Elite Wrestling broadcast its weekly TV series live on TNT network.\n\n\n\nAt a March 30, 2011 concert by the band Furthur, a 19-year-old man ran through a window at the arena and fell four stories. Police say in the moments leading up to the incident, the man got into a football stance, yelled “hike,” and launched himself through the glass. The man was taken to UPMC Presbyterian Hospital with massive head trauma. He was pronounced dead just after 12:20 a.m.\n\n\n\n"}

A. Milne. The wood is visited regularly by the young boy Christopher Robin, who accompanies Pooh and company on their many adventures.\n\nIn A. A. Milne's books, the term \"Hundred Acre Wood\" is actually used for a specific part of the larger Forest, centred on Owl's house (See the map in the book, as well as numerous references in the text to the characters going \"into\" or \"out of\" the Hundred Acre Wood as they go between Owl's house and other Forest locations). However, in the Pooh movies, and in general conversation with most Pooh fans, \"The Hundred Acre Wood\" is used for the entire world of Winnie-the-Pooh, the Forest and all the places it contains.\n\nThe Hundred Acre Wood of the \"Winnie-the-Pooh\" stories is in actuality Five Hundred Acre Wood in Ashdown Forest in East Sussex, England, where the \"Winnie-the-Pooh\" stories were set. A. A. Milne's country home at Cotchford Farm, Hartfield was situated just north of Ashdown Forest, and \"Five Hundred Acre Wood\" is a dense beech wood that Christopher Robin Milne would explore on his way from Cotchford Farm onto the Forest. Five Hundred Acre Wood is long-established, having been originally sold off from the Forest in 1678. The wood remains privately owned, being part of Buckhurst Park estate, and is not therefore generally accessible to the public, though two footpaths which are public rights of way, one of which is part of a long-distance footpath, the Wealdway, cross through the wood and may be used by members of the public.\n\nMilne was inspired by the beautiful landscape of Ashdown Forest to use it as the setting for his Winnie-the-Pooh stories, and many features from the stories can be identified with specific locations in the forest. However, an American television episode \"How Much Is The Rabbit In That Window?\" suggests that the Hundred Acre Wood is relocated near a small city in the United States of America, as a postal box has \"U.S. Mail\" written on it. The car park at the hilltop of Gills Lap (the Galleon's Lap of the Pooh stories) in Ashdown Forest, (), contains a display panel with a map of the surrounding area and the features from several of the Winnie-the-Pooh stories marked on it. For example, Five Hundred Acre Wood lies a short distance to the north-east, while the \"Enchanted Place\" is a small wooded area to the north. A memorial plaque dedicated to A. A. Milne and his illustrator, Ernest H. Shepard, lies away. Five Hundred Acre Wood lies a short distance to the north-east.\n\nThe following places are shown on Ernest H. Shepard's map at the beginning of the Winnie-the-Pooh book:\n\n\nAdditional places mentioned in the books, but not shown on the map include:\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the \"Kingdom Hearts\" series, the Hundred Acre Wood is located within a book found at Merlin's house (which is in Traverse Town during \"Kingdom Hearts\", Hollow Bastion in \"Kingdom Hearts II\", and Twilight Town in \"Kingdom Hearts III\"). In the games, the main character, Sora, gathers pages of a Winnie-the-Pooh storybook after it is destroyed. The Hundred Acre wood is made up of several minigames which serve to level the player up and award items.\n"}

The stadium is also the host of the Military Bowl.\n\nThe stadium's opener was a 29–2 win over William & Mary on September 26, 1959, and its current seating capacity is 34,000. The attendance record is 38,792, set in 2017 during Navy's 48–45 defeat of Air Force on Prior to 1959, Navy played its home games at Thompson Stadium, which seated only 12,000. Its site on campus is now occupied by Lejeune Hall, the venue for USNA water sports.\n\nThe stadium hosted soccer games as part of the 1984 Summer Olympics. In April 2018, D.C. United of the Major League Soccer played a regular season game versus Columbus Crew.\n\nThe stadium serves as a memorial to the Navy and Marine Corps; it is dedicated to those who have served (and will serve) as upholders of the traditions and renown of the Navy and Marine Corps of the United States. The thousands of memorial bench-back and wall plaques are a constant reminder, as well as the list of numerous battles involving the Naval and Marine Corps forces since the early 1900s.\n\nIn 2004 the stadium underwent a partial renovation – expanded west side press box- by 360 Architecture with Jay Schwarz – Schwarz+Associates (formerly Alt Breeding Schwarz) acting as the local/Associate Architect.\n\nFrom 2005 through the present, Jay Schwarz – Schwarz+Associates as the lead Architect has continued to design and develop the expansion and ongoing renovations. These include a new processional entrance face lift through which the entire Brigade of Midshipmen marches on game days. Additionally, the Schwarz led team has lowered the playing field to increase stadium capacity, designed club seating and associated club lounges, private suites, additional stadium seating (north and south end zones), ADA enhancements, updated restrooms, concessions and stadium operation facilities, new banquet facilities, and renovated locker room facilities.\n\nFor its first 46 years, the stadium's playing field was natural grass. Prior to the 2005 football season, the grass field was replaced with FieldTurf, a next-generation infilled synthetic turf. The field runs northwest to southeast, with the pressbox along the southwest sideline, and the elevation of the field is approximately above sea level.\n\nThe field at Navy–Marine Corps Memorial Stadium is named \"Jack Stephens Field\", for Jackson T.

The story is told through text and photographs. It was first published by Doubleday in 1957, went out of print for years, was reissued by Houghton Mifflin in 1998, and brought out by Barnes & Noble in a narrated version for their Nook eReader in 2012. Wright wrote 10 books starring Edith and the bears. The nine that have been reprinted are \"The Lonely Doll\", \"Edith and Mr. Bear\", \"A Gift from the Lonely Doll\", \"Holiday for Edith and the Bears\", \"The Doll and the Kitten\", \"Edith and the Duckling\", \"Edith and Little Bear Lend a Hand\", \"Edith and Midnight\" and \"The Lonely Doll Learns a Lesson\".\n\n\"The Lonely Doll\" tells the story of a doll named Edith, who lives by herself until two teddy bears, called Mr. Bear and Little Bear, appear in her life. One day, Mr. Bear goes out for a walk leaving the two alone in the house; He returns to find they have rummaged in a closet for dress-up clothing, smeared themselves with makeup, and written \"Mr. Bear is just a silly old thing\" in lipstick on the mirror. Mr. Bear proceeds to discipline both Little Bear and Edith, leaving Edith to worry that he will take Little Bear and leave. Mr. Bear assures her that he will never, ever, leave her.\n\nEdith, the main character of many of her books, looks a great deal like Dare Wright herself, with a blonde pony tail and golden hoop earrings.\n\nEdith was named after Dare's mother, Edith Stevenson Wright, a portrait artist.\n\nWhen Houghton Mifflin reissued \"The Lonely Doll\" in 1998, it was not without a minor battle from colleagues, according to then children's book publisher Anita Silvey. At the core of the controversy was the scene in which Mr. Bear spanks Edith for misbehaving. As a result, some parents objected to the book. Other parents, such as critic and novelist Daphne Merkin and fashion designer Vera Wang, supported the book.\n\nThe doll is a felt Lenci Doll from the 1920s which belonged to Dare as a child. She sewed Edith's outfits for the books and changed her eye color to blue, resembling the author's looks.\n\nMr. Bear was manufactured by Schuco, and Little Bear was a special edition Steiff, \"Jackie Bear.\" Both were purchased in the 1950s with the help of Dare's brother, Blaine Wright.\n\nThe Rothschild Doll Company, founded by Mimi Rothschild and Howard Mandel, obtained a license directly from Dare Wright in 1985 to reproduce both a hard plastic and felt version of Edith The Lonely Doll. The Rothschild Doll Company manufactured a 22\" felt Edith doll as originally produced by the Lenci company. She had human hair, painted face, a cotton pink checked dress and black suede shoes. Rothschild made an exclusive basket set containing the 22\" felt doll, a Mohair joined teddy bear known as Mr. Bear and a 12\" Mohair jointed Little Bear.\n\nA new felt finished rendition of the Edith doll was manufactured in 2005 by the Alexander Doll Company, who made the first Edith doll in 1958. It was sold exclusively by The Toy Shoppe.\n\nIn 2007, R.

Born in Hanover, Pennsylvania, the left-handed Spencer was recognized for his excellent fielding ability, but also served in later years as a designated hitter.\n\nSpencer was drafted by the California Angels in the first round (11 overall) of the 1965 Major League Baseball Draft upon graduation from Andover High School in Linthicum, Maryland. After batting .292 with 28 home runs and 96 runs batted in for the El Paso Sun Kings in , Spencer earned a September call-up to the Angels. In nineteen games, he batted .191 with no home runs and five RBIs.\n\nSpencer began the season assigned to the Hawaii Islanders, but with former All-Star Dick Stuart not panning out at first base, he was back with the Angels by May. In just his second start of the season, he went four-for-five against the Baltimore Orioles. For the season, he batted .254 with ten home runs and 31 RBIs.\n\nWhile Spencer's offensive numbers improved in , his fielding improved more-so, as he led the American League with 1212 putouts at first and a .995 fielding percentage to win the Gold Glove award.\n\nInjuries limited Spencer to 82 games in . A month into the season, Spencer was dealt to the Texas Rangers with Lloyd Allen for Mike Epstein, Rich Hand and Rick Stelmaszek.\n\nSpencer was batting .300 for the Rangers when he was named to the AL All-Star team. He had one at-bat in the game, and flew out to left field. Despite the fact that Spencer committed just one error in 1973 and one in , he began seeing more time at DH with Mike Hargrove assuming most of the first base duties. He regained the first base job in with Hargrove shifting to left field. By the start of the following season, Hargrove was shifted back to his natural position.\n\nSpencer was traded twice in as many days at the 1975 Winter Meetings. He returned to the Angels along with $100,000 in exchange for Bill Singer on December 10. The reunion lasted only a day as he was sent with Morris Nettles to the Chicago White Sox for Bill Melton and Steve Dunning on December 11. In , Spencer had career highs in hits (131), RBIs (70) and stolen bases (6). He played 143 games, and only had 2 errors throughout the season, turning 116 double plays, good for a .998 fielding percentage.\n\nOn May 14, , Spencer enjoyed a two home run, eight RBI game against the Cleveland Indians. He followed that up with a second two home run, eight RBI game on July 2 against the Minnesota Twins. For the season, he batted .247 with eighteen home runs and 69 RBIs, and won his second career Gold Glove.\n\nFollowing the season, Spencer was traded with minor leaguers Bob Polinsky and Tommy Cruz to the New York Yankees for Stan Thomas and minor leaguer Ed Ricks.\n\nWhile backing up Chris Chambliss at first base, Spencer saw most of his playing time at DH in New York. He reached the post-season for the first time in his career in . Spencer did not appear in the 1978 American League Championship Series against the Kansas City Royals; however, he appeared in four of the six games of the World Series, and had two hits in twelve at-bats.\n\nSpencer's career high in home runs (23) came in with the Yankees, in a year that he only got 295 at-bats. He only had 85 hits on the season, 41 of which were for extra bases, giving him a .593 slugging percentage. Perhaps his most memorable at-bat of the season took place on July 13 against Nolan Ryan. Ryan had a no-hitter going when Spencer hit a drive to center field in the eighth inning. Centerfielder Rick Miller made a diving attempt at the ball, but could not handle it. The official scorer ruled it an error. Reggie Jackson officially ended Ryan's no-hit bid in the ninth.\n\nDuring spring training , Spencer was dealt to the Pittsburgh Pirates for Jason Thompson, however the trade was nixed by Commissioner Bowie Kuhn. On May 20, he and pitcher Tom Underwood were dealt to the Oakland Athletics for Mike Patterson, Dave Revering and minor leaguer Chuck Dougherty.\n\nSpencer batted only .191 while in Oakland, and was released early in the season.\n\nIn 1973, Spencer had a .999 fielding percentage, with one error in the 125 games he played at first base. The next year, he had one error in 60 games at first base for a .998 fielding percentage.\n\nOn February 10, 2002, Spencer died of a heart attack in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, at the age of 54. The night before his death, Spencer played first base in a charity baseball game benefiting the Joe DiMaggio Children's Hospital in Hollywood, Florida. He was buried at the Mount Pleasant United Methodist Church Cemetery in Taneytown, Maryland.\n\n"}

Reville (born April 19, 1943) is a former politician in Ontario, Canada. He was a New Democratic member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1985 to 1990 who represented the downtown Toronto riding of Riverdale. Between 1990 and 1995 he was an advisor to the government of Bob Rae.\n\nReville was born in Brantford, Ontario. After graduating from Brantford Collegiate Institute in 1961, he attended Trinity College at the University of Toronto and proceeded to law school. It was expected that he would follow the career path of his father, an Ontario judge. Instead, Reville became manic-depressive and attempted to kill himself during his law studies. He was institutionalized in a psychiatric hospital and became a crusader for mental health reform upon his release.\n\nDuring an interview with Canadian Press, Reville intoned, tongue firmly in cheek, \"I became a New Democrat because I was mentally ill\" and was bemused when his statement appeared as a headline in newspapers across the country. He was making the point that he had begun to learn something about powerlessness in hospital, and joined the NDP to fight for marginalized people. He once joked that he was the only MPP with a certificate to prove that he was sane.\n\nReville served on Toronto's city council from 1980 to 1985, and emerged as a popular alderman in the downtown area. Known primarily for his work on affordable housing, he was responsible for an environmental first. He got Council to award intervenor funding for a community group to be involved in the environmental assessment of a proposed refuse-fired steam plant. Out of the group that organized around the issue came two popular politicians, Marilyn Churley and Peter Tabuns, both of whom were City Councillors before being elected to the Legislature. David was elected to the Ontario legislature in the 1985 provincial election, winning an easy victory in Riverdale. He was re-elected in the 1987 election, defeating future Liberal Member of Parliament and then City Councillor Jim Karygiannis by about 1,500 votes. Reville was an opposition MPP throughout his time in the legislature. He was proud to be the author of a private member's bill that brought roomers and boarders under the protection of the Landlord and Tenant Act for the first time. (Bill 10)\n\nReville did not seek re-election in 1990, arguing that he wanted to devote his time to more useful pursuits. After the NDP won a majority government in the 1990 provincial election, he served as a senior advisor to Premier Bob Rae.\n\nIn 1994, Reville was appointed chair of the Ontario Advocacy Commission but it was disbanded by the Mike Harris government less than two years later. In 2001, he received an award from the Council of Canadians with Disabilities. He ran a consulting company called \"David Reville & Associates\" specializing in social research and community development. As a consultant to the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, he helped develop the augmented education program at George Brown College; the award-winning program helps people with mental health and addictions histories get their first jobs in the construction and culinary industries. In 2004, Reville began teaching for the School of Disability Studies at Ryerson University; one of his courses was called A History of Madness and the other Mad Peoples' History which received the Canadian Association for University Continuing Education Award of Excellence in 2011. He retired in 2014. That year, friends and colleagues honoured Reville by establishing the David Reville/Working for Change course bursary in Mad People's History; the winner is selected annually from the Working for Change community. Working for Change creates education and employment opportunities for people with mental health and addictions challenges. Reville was awarded an honorary Doctor of Laws by Queen's University in 2015.\n\nSinging has been a big part of his life. He was a member, man and boy, of the choir at Grace Anglican Church in Brantford for 10 years. He sang at the Mariposa Folk Festival with the Spadina Road Tabernacle Band in 1980 and at Carnegie Hall with newchoir, Toronto's first rock choir in 2015. He was a member of the Eastminster United Church choir in Toronto (2014-2019).\n"}
{"id": "1879170", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1879170", "title": "Shoot Out at the Fantasy Factory", "text": "Shoot Out at the Fantasy Factory\n\nShoot Out at the Fantasy Factory is the sixth studio album by English rock band Traffic released in 1973. It followed their 1971 album \"The Low Spark of High Heeled Boys\" and contained five songs. \"Shoot Out\", while achieving poorer reviews than its predecessor, did reach number six on the Billboard Pop Albums chart, one space higher than \"Low Spark\" had peaked in 1972. Like its predecessor, the original jacket for the \"Shoot Out\" LP had its top right and bottom left corners clipped. The album was remastered for CD in 2003.\n\nThe album was recorded with four members of the Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section (David Hood, Roger Hawkins, Barry Beckett, and Jimmy Johnson). Hood and Hawkins were listed as members of Traffic. Those two plus Beckett would go on the road with the band as evidenced by the subsequent \"On the Road\" album.\n\n\"Rolling Stone\" had a subdued reaction, saying that most of the songs are too even-tempered and uniform in structure and tone, but that \"Evening Blue\" and \"(Sometimes I Feel So) Uninspired\" are high points. They summarized that the album \"embodies the inconsistencies that beset the band as well as the high points that have kept Traffic moving.\"\n\nRetrospective reviews were less forgiving, with AllMusic stating that both the compositions and the performances are uniformly weak, adding up to \"a competent, if perfunctory effort in the band's familiar style\", while \"Village Voice\" critic Robert Christgau's review consisted of a single sentence followed by the note 'Giveaway: \"(Sometimes I Feel So) Uninspired.\"'\n\nThe original, full-length master of \"Shoot Out at the Fantasy Factory\" was initially only heard on the U.S. vinyl version. This was at a time when Island Records was manufactured and distributed by Capitol Records. When Island's distribution deal with Capitol ended, Traffic submitted a revised master in which \"Roll Right Stones\" and \"Uninspired\" were remixed and faded out early. \"Uninspired\" was shortened by about 15 seconds and \"Roll Right Stones\" by a full two minutes. This shortened master was used for all subsequent copies of the album until May 2003. With Island's 2003 remaster of the album, the original full-length versions of these songs finally became available on CD. LPs and CDs with the shortened versions of these songs commonly falsely list the longer times for them.\n\n\nAlbum\n\n"}
