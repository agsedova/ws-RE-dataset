{"id": "1983765", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1983765", "title": "Byline", "text": "Byline\n\nThe byline (or by-line in British English) on a newspaper or magazine article gives the name of the writer of the article. Bylines are commonly placed between the headline and the text of the article, although some magazines (notably \"Reader's Digest\") place bylines at the bottom of the page to leave more room for graphical elements around the headline.\n\nDictionary.com defines a byline as \"a printed line of text accompanying a news story, article, or the like, giving the author's name\".\n\nA typical newspaper byline might read:\nGershon Rabinowitz<br>\"New York Daily News Contributor\"\n\nA byline can also include a brief article summary that introduces the author by name:\nPenning a concise description of a long piece has never been as easy as often appears, as \"Staff Writer\" John Smith now explains:\n\nMagazine bylines and bylines on opinion pieces often include biographical information on their subjects. A typical biographical byline on a piece of creative nonfiction might read\nJohn Smith is working on a book, \"My Time in Ibiza\", based on this article. He is returning to the region this summer to gather material for a follow-up essay.\"\n\nBylines were rare before the late 19th century. Before then, the most similar practice was the occasional \"signed\" or \"signature\" article. The word \"byline\" itself first appeared in print in 1926, in a scene set in a newspaper office in \"The Sun Also Rises\" by Ernest Hemingway.\n\nOne of the earliest consistent uses of the idea was for battlefield reporting during the American Civil War. In 1863, Union General Joseph Hooker required battlefield reporters to sign their articles so that he would know which journalist to blame for any errors or security violations.\n\nThe practice became more popular at the end of the 19th century, as journalists became more powerful and popular figures. Bylines were used to promote or create celebrities among some yellow journalists during this time. Proponents of signed articles believed that the signature made the journalist more careful and more honest; publishers thought it made papers sell better.\n\nHowever, the increasing use of bylines was resisted by others, including the publisher–owner of \"The New York Times\", Adolph Ochs, who believed that bylines interfered with the impersonal nature of news and decreased the sense of institutional responsibility for an article's content. Bylines remained rare in that newspaper for several more decades.\n\nThe first Associated Press wire services story with a byline appeared in 1925, and the practice became commonplace shortly afterwards.\n\nSince the 1970s, most modern newspapers and magazines have attributed almost all but their shortest articles and their own editorial pieces to individual reporters or to wire services.\n\nAn exception is the British weekly \"The Economist\", which publishes nearly all material except blog posts anonymously. \"The Economist\" explains this practice as being traditional and reflective of the collaborative nature of their reporting.\n\nArticles that originate from press agency journalists are sometimes incorrectly attributed to newspaper staff. Dominic Ponsford of the \"Press Gazette\" gives the following examples:\n\nPonsford also highlights cases in which newspapers byline fictional authors for pieces that attack other newspapers: for example the \"Daily Express\"s use of \"Brendon Abbott\".\n\n"}

For both algebra and coalgebra, a functor is a convenient and general way of organizing a signature. This has applications in computer science: examples of coalgebras include lazy, infinite data structures, such as streams, and also transition systems.\n\nformula_1-coalgebras are dual to formula_1-algebras. Just as the class of all algebras for a given signature and equational theory form a variety, so does the class of all formula_1-coalgebras satisfying a given equational theory form a covariety, where the signature is given by formula_1.\n\nLet \n\nbe an endofunctor on a category formula_8.\nAn formula_1-coalgebra is an object formula_10 of formula_8 together with a morphism \n\nof formula_8, usually written as formula_14.\n\nAn formula_1-coalgebra homomorphism from formula_14 to another formula_1-coalgebra\nformula_18 is a morphism \n\nin formula_8 such that \n\nThus the formula_1-coalgebras for a given functor \"F\" constitute a category.\n\nConsider the endofunctor formula_23 that sends a set to its disjoint union with the singleton set formula_24. A coalgebra of this endofunctor is given by formula_25, where formula_26 is the so-called conatural numbers, consisting of the nonnegative integers and also infinity, and the function formula_27 is given by formula_28, formula_29 for formula_30 and formula_31. In fact, formula_32 is the terminal coalgebra of this endofunctor.\n\nMore generally, fix some set formula_10, and consider the functor formula_34 that sends formula_35 to formula_36. Then an formula_1-coalgebra formula_38 is a finite or infinite stream over the alphabet where formula_35 is the set of states and formula_27 is the state-transition function. Applying the state-transition function to a state may yield two possible results: either an element of formula_10 together with the next state of the stream, or the element of the singleton set formula_42 as a separate \"final state\" indicating that there are no more values in the stream.\n\nIn many practical applications, the state-transition function of such a coalgebraic object may be of the form formula_43, which readily factorizes into a collection of \"selectors\", \"observers\", \"methods\" formula_44. Special cases of practical interest include observers yielding attribute values, and mutator methods of the form formula_45 taking additional parameters and yielding states. This decomposition is dual to the decomposition of initial formula_1-algebras into sums of 'constructors'.\n\nLet \"P\" be the power set construction on the category of sets, considered as a covariant functor. The \"P\"-coalgebras are in bijective correspondence with sets with a binary relation. \nNow fix another set, \"A\". Then coalgebras for the endofunctor \"P\"(\"A\"×(-)) are in bijective correspondence with labelled transition systems, and homomorphisms between coalgebras correspond to functional bisimulations between labelled transition systems.\n\nIn computer science, coalgebra has emerged as a convenient and suitably general way of specifying the behaviour of systems and data structures that are potentially infinite, for example classes in object-oriented programming, streams and transition systems. While algebraic specification deals with functional behaviour, typically using inductive datatypes generated by constructors, coalgebraic specification is concerned with behaviour modelled by coinductive process types that are observable by selectors, much in the spirit of automata theory. An important role is played here by final coalgebras, which are complete sets of possibly infinite behaviours, such as streams. The natural logic to express properties of such systems is coalgebraic modal logic.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1983774", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1983774", "title": "Vivian Grey", "text": "Vivian Grey\n\nVivian Grey is Benjamin Disraeli's first novel, published by Henry Colburn in 1826. Originally published anonymously, ostensibly by a so-called \"man of fashion,\" part 1 caused a considerable sensation in London society. Contemporary reviewers, suspicious of the numerous solecisms contained within the text, eventually identified the young Disraeli (who did \"not\" move in high society) as the author. Disraeli continued the tale in a second volume, also of 1826, and three subsequent volumes in 1827. The form in which \"Vivian Grey\" is published now is the revised 1853 edition, which was severely expurgated and, according to critic Wendy Burton, lost much of the charm and freshness of the 1826 edition. The book is a frequent touchstone for discussions of Disraeli's political and literary career.\n\n\"Vivian Grey\" follows its eponymous hero from childhood through his attempt to succeed in the world of politics. The various systems of education through which Vivian Grey passes are analysed. The final system of education is experience, which proves the most instructive and the most shattering. Vivian chooses politics as his career and the novel traces his abortive attempt to gain political power through manipulation of an influential but ineffectual member of parliament. Vivian attempts to organise a party around the Marquess of Carabas, and is ultimately thwarted by his inexperience and naivete in dealing with the political machine. Vivian emerges as a misguided and arrogant young man who is ruthless in his pursuit of power. The catastrophe at the conclusion provides Vivian with a brutal but essential lesson in human behaviour. The novel offers a comment on the political and social temper of England in the early 1820s, and is specifically concerned with the question of personal advancement in a rigidly restrictive social structure. The plot is commonly considered to be a thinly-disguised re-telling of Disraeli's involvement with John Murray in the publication and failure of a new newspaper, \"The Representative.\"\n\n\"Vivian Grey\" provided a natural beginning for students of Disraeli, and a frequent touchstone for discussions of Disraeli's political and literary career. This situation is possible only when the scholar accepts the protagonist of \"Vivian Grey\" as a replica of the author, revealed in uncounselled and damaging testimony. The details of the composition of the first part of the novel, and the role of Sara Austen in that composition, as well as awareness of publishing practices in the 1820s in London, challenge the assumption that Vivian Grey is synonymous with the young Benjamin Disraeli.\nThe British poet Mary Montgomerie Lamb took her pen name 'Violet Fane' from a character in this novel.\n\nSome commentaters have suggested that \"Vivian Grey\" influenced Oscar Wilde in the writing of his only novel, \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\".\n"}

He was styled Master of Jedburgh until 1722, Lord Jedburgh from 1722 to 1735, and Earl of Ancram from 1735 to 1767. As the Earl of Ancram, he distinguished himself during the War of the Austrian Succession.\n\nOn 6 November 1735, he married Lady Caroline Darcy (d. 1778), daughter of Robert Darcy, 3rd Earl of Holderness, and thereafter assumed the style of Earl of Ancram rather than Lord Jedburgh. They had three children:\n\nAncram was commissioned a cornet in 1735. He was a captain in the 31st Regiment of Foot in 1739, and transferred as such to the 1st Regiment of Foot Guards in 1741. He fought with the Guards at the Battle of Fontenoy (1745) while serving as an aide-de-camp to the Duke of Cumberland, and was wounded during the battle. He was subsequently made an ADC to the King and a colonel. In the same year, he was appointed lieutenant-colonel of Lord Mark Kerr's Regiment of Dragoons, and commanded the cavalry on the left wing at the Battle of Culloden in 1746 (His younger brother, Lord Robert Kerr, was with the infantry and was the highest-ranking Government casualty of the battle). After the battle, he commanded the forces at Aberdeen until August, and then returned to the Continent with Cumberland in December. At some point during the year, he was appointed a Groom of the Bedchamber to Cumberland.\n\nAncram was sent home with the standards captured at the Battle of Lauffeld. On 1 December 1747, he succeeded Daniel Houghton as colonel of the 24th Regiment of Foot. On 11 December 1747, through the interest of his brother-in-law Robert Darcy, 4th Earl of Holderness, he was returned as Member of Parliament (MP) for Richmond at a by-election in place of Sir Conyers Darcy, who had also been returned for Yorkshire and preferred that seat.\n\nIn 1752, Ancram was appointed colonel of the 11th Regiment of Dragoons, in succession to his grand-uncle Lord Mark Kerr. He was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant General in 1758 and held a command under the Duke of Marlborough during the Raid on St Malo.\n\nAncram had followed his old commander Cumberland into politics, and with him supported Pitt and his opposition to the negotiations for the Treaty of Paris. While Ancram's political position was undermined in 1762 when his brother-in-law, Lord Holderness, sold off his interest in the borough of Richmond, Fox and Lord Shelburne were still at pains to persuade him to leave the House of Commons before the vote on the peace preliminaries without the interference of Cumberland. Ancram voted against the preliminaries on 9 December, having missed a message from Cumberland directing him not to do so; ultimately, he took the Chiltern Hundreds in 1763, having accepted, according to the Duke of Newcastle, £4,000 to do so.\n\nIn 1767, he succeeded to the Marquessate of Lothian. He was elected a Scots representative peer and appointed a Knight of the Thistle in 1768. He was promoted to general in 1770 and died in 1775 at Bath.\n"}

Henry's Cat shared the earlier character's tendency toward wild flights of fancy and laid-back approach to life. \"Henry's Cat\" creator Stan Hayward included the official explanation for the character's lack of a name on the official \"Henry's Cat Special Edition\" DVD in 2000. The explanation was that Henry, an unseen character in the series, had been Henry's Cat's original owner. He had moved away, and Henry's Cat had forgotten to go with him.

{"id": "1983799", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1983799", "title": "Central Massachusetts Railroad", "text": "Central Massachusetts Railroad\n\nThe Central Massachusetts Railroad was a railroad in Massachusetts. The eastern terminus of the line was at North Cambridge Junction where it split off from the Middlesex Central Branch of the Boston and Lowell Railroad in North Cambridge and through which it had access to North Station in Boston. From there, the route ran 98.77 miles west through the modern-day towns of Belmont, Waltham, Weston, Wayland, Sudbury, Hudson, Bolton, Berlin, Clinton, West Boylston, Holden, Rutland, Oakham, Barre, New Braintree, Hardwick, Ware, Palmer, Belchertown, Amherst, and Hadley to its western terminal junction at N. O. Tower in Northampton with the Connecticut River Railroad.\n\nIn the late 1860s citizens in the towns of Sudbury, Wayland, and Weston petitioned the General Court of Massachusetts to build a railroad through their towns. On February 21, 1868 the state chartered the Wayland and Sudbury Branch Railroad to run 6.75 miles from Mill Village in Sudbury through Wayland to a connection with the Fitchburg Railroad at Stony Brook in Weston. Later that year another group of citizens submitted a petition requesting that the new railroad extend further west to Northampton. On May 10, 1869 the General Court chartered the Massachusetts Central Railroad and united it with the Wayland and Sudbury Branch.\n\nThe Massachusetts Central Railroad was organized on September 2, 1869 with James M. Stone of Charlestown elected as its first president. Construction began the following fall despite difficulty in raising capital. The company hired contractor Norman Munson to build the railroad in April 1871 but two years later the Panic of 1873 forced Munson into bankruptcy and halted construction. The railroad stagnated until June 5, 1878 when new president Silas Seymour called a stockholders meeting. The stockholders elected a new Board of Directors which appointed George S. Boutwell president in 1879 and rehired Munson to resume construction. That same year the Massachusetts General Court amended the railroad's charter to allow for several new expansions. The most significant was an extension east to Cambridge which eliminated the connection with the Fitchburg at Stony Brook and placed the route's eastern terminus at North Cambridge Junction with the Middlesex Central Branch of the Boston and Lowell Railroad (B&L). Other amendments included a branch from Amherst to a connection with the Troy and Greenfield Railroad in West Deerfield and approval to connect with and build over the route of the never-constructed Holyoke and Belchertown Railroad through Granby and South Hadley.\n\nWith its new connection in the east the stockholders approved a 25-year lease of the Massachusetts Central to the B&L on March 21, 1880 pending its completion within two years. The first rails were finally laid in October that same year at the junction with the Framingham and Lowell Railroad in South Sudbury. The route from Cambridge to Hudson was complete by August 20, 1881 and inspected by state and company officials on September 21. Satisfied with the work the officials set the railroad's grand opening for October 1, 1881. The company appointed Munson as general manager and purchased five locomotives. The first schedule included four passenger round trips from Boston to Hudson, four passenger round trips from Boston to Waltham, and a daily freight from Boston to Hudson and back.\n\nMeanwhile, westward construction continued with tracks reaching Oakdale and Jefferson by June 1882. In 1883 the selling agents for the company's bonds, Boston-based Charles A. Sweet and Co., declared bankruptcy. The railroad ceased operations and construction on May 16 and remained in limbo for the next 29 months.\n\nTo restore service to the line the Central Massachusetts Railroad was formed out of the failed Massachusetts Central Railroad Company on November 10, 1883. The directors contracted with the B&L to operate trains over the Central Massachusetts route in the fall of 1885 with service resuming from Boston to Hudson on September 28 and to Jefferson on December 14. The new schedule included seven daily round trips from Boston to Jefferson and another ten to Waltham.\nThe B&L formally leased the Central Massachusetts on December 7, 1886, resuming work on the route to Northampton but abandoning any plans for branches to Holyoke or West Deerfield. Though considerable grading work had already been done along the original planned route in Hardwick, Greenwich, and Enfield the railroad's leadership decided to redirect the route through an easier terrain in the Ware River Valley, taking the line into Palmer and reconnecting with the original route in Belchertown. This turned out to be a fortuitous decision given that much of the disused portion of the line was flooded in the 1930s to construct the Quabbin Reservoir. Tracks were installed through Muschopauge in Rutland by November.\nThe Boston and Maine Railroad (B&M) leased the B&L On April 1, 1887, renaming the Central Massachusetts line as the Central Massachusetts Branch. The tracks reached Ware on June 27, 1887 and before the end of that year construction finished with the completion of the bridge over the Connecticut River. The first train to traverse the entire route, led by locomotive No. 238, \"Hudson\", left Boston at 8:30 A. M. on December 12 and arrived in Northampton at 12:30 P. M. Revenue service commenced on December 19 with three daily passenger round trips between Boston and Northampton, two between Boston and Hudson, three between Boston and Wayland, and two between Ware and Northampton.\n\nAlthough the Central Massachusetts Railroad never grew beyond Northampton as its early backers had hoped it nonetheless became an integral link for the B&M to points west and south. This was primarily due to the fact that no rail bridges spanned the North River in New York City, separating New England from major metropolitan areas such as Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Washington, D. C. In 1889 construction of the Poughkeepsie Bridge over the Hudson River at Poughkeepsie, New York completed the Poughkeepsie Bridge Route, the first all-rail route between New England and points south of New York City. Trains such as the \"Philadelphia and Washington Express\" and the \"Harrisburg Express\" traveled over the several railroads that composed the route, including the Central Massachusetts Branch of the B&M.\n\nWith the B&M suddenly such an important link into New England Archibald Angus McLeod, president of the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad (P&R), sought to use the line as part of his bid to control the coal mining traffic between eastern Pennsylvania and New England independent of the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad (NYNH&H). In 1892 McLeod took stock control of the B&M and of the New York and New England Railroad to fulfill his plan, electing himself president of the B&M on October 26. Early in 1893 the P&R went bankrupt and McLeod lost stock control of the B&M, resigning as president on May 23. With relatively stable local control restored the B&M was able to lease one of its major competitors, the Fitchburg Railroad, in 1900. Two years later, on February 20, 1902, the B&M outright purchased the Central Massachusetts Railroad and dissolved its corporate entity.\n\nWith the Central Massachusetts Branch now a part of its system the B&M set about improving the connections between the line and the rest of its network. The first change was in Oakdale where on March 30, 1902 the railroad shut down the accident-prone yard where the Central Massachusetts Branch crossed at grade over the Worcester, Nashua, and Portland Division (WN&P) main line. The next improvement was at Jefferson where the B&M rehabilitated a connecting track that split off of the Central Massachusetts Branch at Holden Junction and connected with the Worcester and Hillsboro Branch at Carr Junction to allow passenger service into Princeton, Hubbardston, Gardner, and Winchendon. Finally the B&M built a connection in Gleasondale from Gleason Junction on the Central Massachusetts Branch to C. M. Junction on the Marlborough Branch to enable passenger service into Marlborough. While traffic into Marlborough flourished, traffic along the connection in Jefferson languished, and in 1909 the B&M took up that track.\n\nOn June 5, 1895 the General Court of Massachusetts authorized the damming of the south branch of the Nashua River for the construction of the Wachusett Reservoir, flooding roughly of land in the towns of Clinton, Boylston, and West Boylston. The Central Massachusetts Branch needed to be rerouted as the new reservoir would cover of track as well as the stations at South Clinton, Boylston, and West Boylston. Two proposals for the new route emerged. The first proposal called for a connection to the defunct Lancaster Railroad in Hudson that would route traffic through Bolton to a connection with the WN&P Division main line in South Lancaster and leave Berlin at the end of a four-mile branch. The second proposal would build a new route through Clinton and connect with the WN&P Division main line there. On April 3, 1902 the Metropolitan Water and Sewerage Board reached an agreement with the B&M to reroute the Central Massachusetts Branch according to the latter plan.\n\nThe new portion of the Central Massachusetts Branch started just west of West Berlin Junction in Berlin where the Central Massachusetts Branch connected with the Fitchburg Line of the NYNH&H. From there it ran northwest into Clinton through a -long tunnel. The western portal of the tunnel opened onto a 917-foot viaduct near the site of the Wachusett Dam that passed over Route 70 and the Nashua River before connecting with the WN&P Division main line at Clinton Junction. Traffic over the Central Massachusetts Branch followed the WN&P Division main line through Sterling into Oakdale where a redesigned junction routed it back onto the original Central Massachusetts Branch. Just before Clinton Junction an additional connection branched off at Reservoir Switch leading to East Switch on the WN&P Division to allow traffic to approach the Central Massachusetts Branch from the north or continue from the Central Massachusetts Branch north along the WN&P Division main line. The first train passed over the new route on June 2, 1903 while the old track was officially removed from through service on June 15 but remained in place and used during the remainder of the reservoir construction, some of it being re-gauged to 3' to allow construction trains to utilize it. Under this arrangement the WN&P main line between Oakdale and Sterling Junction became exceptionally busy as it accommodated B&M traffic from the WN&P Division and the Central Massachusetts Branch as well as NYNH&H traffic heading between Worcester and Fitchburg along the tracks of the original Fitchburg and Worcester Railroad.\n\nIn 1907 Charles Sanger Mellen, the president of the NYNH&H and protégé of J. P. Morgan, gained control of the B&M to form a near monopoly on all rail traffic in southern New England. Mellen sought to build a direct route through Springfield that would funnel traffic into Boston along the Central Massachusetts Branch and away from the Boston and Albany Railroad (B&A), which was controlled by William H. Vanderbilt’s New York Central Railroad (NYC). Legal proceedings brought against Mellen by Louis D. Brandeis to break up his monopoly meant Mellen could not build the route himself so he befriended a railroad contractor from Westfield named Ralph D. Gillett and made him president of the Hampden Railroad with the intent to lease the new route upon its completion.\n\nThe Massachusetts General Court incorporated the Hampden in July 1910. It started at Hampden Junction on the Central Massachusetts Branch about two miles east of Bondsville and continued 14.82 miles southwest through Belchertown, Ludlow, and Chicopee to the B&A main line at Athol Junction about two miles east of Springfield. Construction finished by May 9, 1913 with service between New York and Boston scheduled to commence on June 23. Just days before its grand opening operations were suspended indefinitely as Mellen faced a hearing before the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) regarding his questionable business practices. He abruptly resigned from the presidencies of both the NYNH&H and B&M on July 9 leaving the Hampden a bridge between two suddenly competing railroads. Despite one more tour by B&M officials in November 1914 neither they nor the NYNH&H wished to lease the line, which was shut down for good in 1925.\n\nThe failure of the Hampden and Mellen's empire marked the beginning of the downturn of the Central Massachusetts Branch. Much of the traffic routed through Northampton under Mellen's empire vanished or was rerouted by the B&M along the parallel Fitchburg Division via Mechanicville. In August 1917 the B&M discontinued passenger service between Ware and Northampton and downsized the terminal in Ware significantly. The line enjoyed a brief upswing in traffic between World War I and the early 1920s but the Great Depression and increased competition from automobiles and trucks began to take their toll in the latter half of the decade. By 1928 no freights and only one passenger train ran the length of the line from Boston to Northampton.\n\nThe struggling economy and reduction in business forced the B&M to take austerity measures and cut back on less profitable lines including the Central Massachusetts Branch. To keep the line open but defray some of the operation and maintenance costs the B&M obtained trackage rights to the Central Vermont Railway's Southern Division in 1931, which ran parallel to the Central Massachusetts Branch for several miles between Belchertown and Amherst. Connections at Canal Junction in Belchertown and at Norwottuck Junction in Amherst allowed the B&M to route all of its trains over the Southern Division and abandon the parallel Central Massachusetts Branch tracks. The railroad pulled off a similar maneuver in January 1933, obtaining trackage rights to the Ware River Branch of the B&A. In order to maintain service to customers in Gilbertville and Wheelwright the B&M build three connections to the Ware River Branch at Barre Junction in Barre, Forest Lake Junction in Palmer, and Creamery in Hardwick. The railroad routed trains on the Central Massachusetts Branch along the Ware River Branch and made the sections from Creamery to Gilbertville and Wheelwright spurs, taking the tracks south of Gilbertville to Forest Lake and north of Wheelwright to Barre Junction out of service. The ICC approved the abandonments in 1941 and the B&M took up all of the abandoned tracks.\n\nTo further cut costs the B&M also reduced service on the Central Massachusetts Branch, discontinuing passenger service to Northampton on April 23, 1932. In 1943 the B&M abandoned the Marlborough Branch between its original connection with the Fitchburg Division in South Acton through Maynard and Stow to Gleason Junction, making the Central Massachusetts Branch the exclusive route into Marlborough. By 1938 most of the traffic on the Central Massachusetts Branch was east of Clinton. The only business on the western end of the line was local freight service between Northampton and Rutland. Since no trains passed over the middle of the route the B&M took the tracks between Oakdale and Muschopauge out of service on June 1, 1938. Later that year on September 21 the Hurricane of 1938 badly damaged the tracks, particularly near the Quinapoxet, Ware, and Swift Rivers where washouts severed the line at Coldbrook and knocked out a bridge in Gilbertville. The B&M could not justify the cost to make repairs to an area it was hardly using and so on January 30, 1939 the railroad formally submitted a request to the ICC to abandon the tracks between Oakdale and Barre Junction, abandon the tracks between Creamery and Gilbertville, and discontinue operations on the Ware River Branch between Creamery and Barre Junction. The ICC approved the abandonments on November 7 and then the discontinuance of service on the Ware River Branch a month later on December 17. With the line officially cloven in two the B&M renamed the line between Northampton and Wheelwright as the Wheelwright Branch and retained the Central Massachusetts Branch moniker for the eastern half of the line between Boston and Oakdale.\n\nOn the Wheelwright Branch freight service continued between Northampton and Wheelwright at least three times per week until 1973 when the paper mill in Wheelwright closed. In April 1974 the B&M cut freight service to once per week, took the tracks between Creamery and Wheelwright out of service, and embargoed all traffic on the line east of Bondsville. With only one customer in Bondsville the railroad petitioned the ICC to abandon the remainder of the Wheelwright Branch in June 1979, reasoning that that business could be better served by the new Massachusetts Central Railroad which the General Court had chartered on October 16, 1975 to run along the Ware River Secondary of the bankrupt Penn Central Railroad after that line was to be excluded from the government's reorganization of the northeast railroads into Conrail. The ICC approved the plan and operations east of Amherst ceased by August and on the rest of the line by November.\n\nOn February 14, 1980 the B&M officially took line from Northampton to Norwottuck out of service. Later that month the Massachusetts Central assumed responsibility for the customer in Bondsville but had to stop after about a year due to the poor condition of the tracks. The ICC finally approved the abandonment of the Wheelwright Branch in 1982 and the B&M took up the tracks between Northampton and Norwottuck later that year. This left only two sections of B&M-owned track on the Wheelwright Branch: between Canal Junction and Bondsville and between Creamery and Wheelwright. The Massachusetts Central could not afford to acquire either property and so in 1983 the B&M took up both. As of 2006 the last remaining portion of the Central Massachusetts Railroad still in revenue service is in Ware where the Massachusetts Central uses what remains of the yard in that town as well as a small section that provides access to a paper plant customer.\n\nIn 1939 the B&M ended passenger service to Marlborough leaving the four daily trains between Boston and Clinton the last of the passenger service on the Central Massachusetts Branch. Freight service, however, continued to all three communities and saw a major uptick as World War II intensified. In 1942 the United States Government built the Fort Devens-Sudbury Training Annex which connected to the Central Massachusetts Branch at Mirror Lake Junction just east of Ordway Station in Hudson. B&M trains transported huge quantities of ammunition to and from the bunker with inbound ammunition from Boston being dropped in a yard just north of Mirror Lake Junction and outbound ammunition being brought to the NYNH&H in South Sudbury. This business ended with the war as the government repurposed the facility and removed the yard and connection to the Central Massachusetts Branch.\n\nFurther east the B&M worked with the state and other railroads to modernize and streamline the rail infrastructure in and around Boston between 1951 and 1952. Rather than have the Central Massachusetts Branch and Fitchburg Division run parallel to one another from Clematis Brook to their connection at Fens in Cambridge the B&M decided to connect the two lines at Clematis Brook and route all Central Massachusetts Branch traffic onto the Fitchburg Division. After upgrading the Fitchburg Division to handle the increase in traffic the railroad took up the tracks of the Central Massachusetts Branch tracks between Clematis Brook and Hill Crossing. The remaining track between Hill Crossing and North Cambridge Junction became a part of the Hill Crossing Freight Cutoff to the yards in Boston. Around the same time the B&M also modernized its motive power, adopting diesel locomotives throughout its system. The last of the steam locomotive operations for scheduled passenger revenue service on the B&M took place between Boston and Clinton on the Central Massachusetts Branch. On May 5, 1956 the last steam-powered train on the line departed Clinton for Boston and shortly thereafter the railroad closed the engine house in Clinton and began using Budd self-propelled railcars for passenger service along the route.\n\nBy 1958 freight and passenger business between Clinton and Boston dwindled to nearly nothing. The B&M cut all service west of Berlin early that year with only two weekday passenger trains running as far as Hudson on the Marlborough Branch. On August 11 the railroad removed all track between Berlin and Clinton Junction, including East Switch, from service. The viaduct in Clinton remained in place until 1974 when the Metropolitan District Commission removed it. On June 14, 1959 the B&M further cut passenger service to Hudson back to one round trip daily.\n\nIn 1959, the NYNH&H discontinued passenger service on its lines in the former Old Colony Railroad network, triggering calls for state intervention. In response, the Mass Transportation Commission tested fare and service levels throughout the NYNH&H and B&M systems, concluding that commuter rail service was important enough to warrant continued operation, but was unlikely to be financially self-sustaining. Based on this conclusion, the state created the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) on August 3, 1964 and merged it with the existing Metropolitan Transportation Authority to serve a larger part of the state and subsidize commuter rail service. The MBTA immediately set to work optimizing the commuter rail networks of the NYNH&H, NYC, and B&M. On the Central Massachusetts Branch, this included cutting passenger service back to South Sudbury starting on January 18, 1965.\n\nIn spite of the subsidies, ridership continued to decline on the Central Massachusetts Branch, and by 1969 the MBTA recommended an end to all service on the line. Devoted riders managed to briefly delay the decision, but in December 1970 the B&M filed for bankruptcy. On July 30, 1971, the state renewed the B&M's annual subsidy but without funding for the Central Massachusetts Branch. A group of citizens from Wayland argued that the single train along the route was too inconvenient for commuters and so on October 1 the MBTA announced that it would temporarily schedule more trains to determine whether the line was still viable. After two months, the MBTA concluded that the modest increase in ridership was not sufficient to warrant continued funding; on November 26, all passenger service ended on the Central Massachusetts Branch. The MBTA examined the possibility of restoring passenger service to the line in 1972 and again in 1975, but nothing came of either study.\n\nDespite the end of passenger service on the Central Massachusetts Branch freight service continued well into the 1970s. Trains ran to South Sudbury 3–4 times each week and traveled as far as Hudson when needed, usually 1–2 times per week. With no business in Marlborough the B&M took the last section of the Marlborough Branch out of service in 1974. On December 27, 1976 the B&M sold the Central Massachusetts Branch as well as its Budd RDC fleet and several other lines to the MBTA but retained the rights to freight service. Business continued to decline however, and by 1977 the B&M had to reduce service to runs as needed. That same year the railroad removed the track between Berlin and Hudson from service as it had deteriorated to the point of being unsafe. In August 1979 the B&M petitioned the ICC to abandon the Central Massachusetts Branch between Berlin and Waltham North Station and the remaining segment of the Marlborough Branch. The last train to Hudson ran on June 19, 1980 and the last train west of Waltham about a month later on August 14. The B&M officially took the track west of Bacon Street in Waltham out of service on September 11 and the United States District Court overseeing the B&M's bankruptcy approved the abandonment in October. Around the same time the B&M and MBTA increased vertical height clearances along the New Hampshire Route main line. This made the Hill Crossing Freight Cutoff obsolete and in 1980 the B&M and MBTA took up the Central Massachusetts Branch track between Hill Crossing and North Cambridge Junction to make room for the MBTA's Red Line.\n\nIn 1983 Guilford Rail System purchased the B&M and began to transfer all operations to the B&M subsidiary Springfield Terminal Railway. The Springfield Terminal took over operations on the last piece of the Central Massachusetts Branch between Clematis Brook and Bacon Street in Waltham in 1987 and continued them until the last customer shut down in 1994. In 1996 State Representative Nancy Evans of Wayland proposed restoring commuter service on the Central Massachusetts Branch between Interstate 495 in Berlin and Boston to alleviate traffic on Route 20 but was met with substantial backlash from residents of new homes built along the dormant line in the time since its operations had ceased. The Executive Office of Transportation carried out a feasibility study anyway estimating that restoring service to the route as far as Berlin would cost in excess of $103 million and that any benefit gained was unlikely to outweigh the costs. In 1999 Evans, now the Director of Planning for the MBTA, proposed converting the Central Massachusetts right of way into a busway but the state rejected this proposal as well. As of 2006 the grade crossings and bridges between Clematis Brook and Berlin have been mostly removed but the tracks remain mostly intact if encroached upon and badly overgrown.\n\nIn 1996 the towns along the eastern portion of the Central Massachusetts Branch requested permission to convert the route between Clematis Brook and Berlin into the Wayside Rail Trail. The MBTA agreed to lease the property for the project with the stipulation that it would retain the right to revert it to a commuter rail line and that the trail would be policed and maintained by the communities themselves. Every town along the route except for Weston accepted the terms but without unanimous approval the trail never came to fruition. Nonetheless, Waltham moved ahead to convert the property in their city anyway reasoning that even if service were restored it would start from a new connection at Stony Brook west of their city limits. Efforts to convert the property to recreational trails found more success elsewhere along the route. The portion of the Marlborough Branch between Gleason Junction and Marlborough became the Assabet River Rail Trail. In Boston the former Central Massachusetts Branch section of the Hill Crossing Freight Cutoff between Hill Crossing and North Cambridge Junction became the Fitchburg Cutoff Path.\nThe towns along the former Wheelwright Branch exhibited similar enthusiasm for recreational trails along the property. In March 1985 with support from the local governments and regional planning agency the state purchased 10 miles of the line between the west end of the Connecticut River Bridge in Northampton and Amherst with the intent to convert it into a rail trail. Work began in 1992 and on July 29, 1993 the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Management officially opened the Norwottuck Branch Rail Trail. By 1997 the trail extended as far as Belchertown where progress halted due to a concerted effort from private landowners who had taken over the long-abandoned property. In 2006 the western end of the trail was extended to N. O. Tower. In West Boylston, Holden, and Rutland a volunteer organization called Wachusett Greenways began to convert the roughly 30 miles of property between Oakdale and Rutland to the Mass Central Rail Trail. The Mass Central Rail Trail currently includes a portion of the former Fitchburg and Worcester Railroad in Sterling between Sterling Junction and Sterling Center; however this route was never a part of the Central Massachusetts Branch and does not connect with the rest of the trail since the former WN&P Division main line tracks remain in service as the Worcester Main Line of Pan Am Railways.\n\nThe Massachusetts Central Railroad operated five locomotives between 1881 and 1883. These were the only five locomotives that the company ever owned with other railroads providing motive power later in the line's history.\n\nRogers Locomotive and Machine Works built locomotive No. 1 for the Indiana, Bloomington and Western Railway (IB&W) as their No. 70. In 1880 the IB&W returned the locomotive to Rogers which sold it to the Housatonic Railroad as their No. 21. The Massachusetts Central Railroad purchased the locomotive in 1881 then sold it to the St. Johnsbury and Lake Champlain Railroad (SJ&LC) in 1883 where it became No. 11, \"Col. Jewett\". The locomotive became a part of the B&L following its merger with the SJ&LC in 1885. The B&L renumbered it as No. 163, \"Highgate\". The locomotive returned to the SJ&LC 1887 when the B&M leased the B&L and became No. 8, \"Highgate\". The SJ&LC scrapped the locomotive in May 1892.\n\nRogers built locomotive No. 2 for the IB&W as their No. 71. In 1880 the IB&W returned the locomotive to Rogers which sold it to the Housatonic as their No. 22. The Massachusetts Central Railroad purchased the locomotive in 1881 then sold it to the SJ&LC in 1883 where it became No. 12, \"Col. Fairbanks\". The locomotive became a part of the B&L in 1887, which renumbered it as No. 164, \"Col. Fairbanks\". The B&M took possession of the locomotive in 1895, renumbering it as No. 629 and then No. 555 on February 29, 1904. The B&M scrapped the locomotive on March 20, 1907.\n\nSchenectady Locomotive Works built locomotive No. 3 for the Massachusetts Central Railroad. In 1887 the locomotive became B&L No. 10, \"Woburn\", and later that year it became B&M No. 310, \"Woburn\". The B&M rebuilt the locomotive in 1898 and renumbered it No. 680 in 1911 before scrapping it in August 1920.\n\nSchenectady built locomotive No. 4 for the Massachusetts Central Railroad. In 1887 the locomotive became B&L No. 65, \"Marlboro\", and later that year it became B&M No. 365, \"Marlboro\". Manchester Locomotive Works rebuilt the locomotive in 1904 and the B&M renumbered it No. 683 in 1911, scrapping it before 1923.\n\nPrior to its time with the Massachusetts Central Railroad Locomotive No. 5 was No. 11, \"N. C. Munson\", of the N. C. Munson Construction Company (incidentally the original contractor for the Massachusetts Central Railroad). It was sold to the Massachusetts Central around 1882 and sold at auction in 1886.\n\nIn addition to the above locomotives the Massachusetts Central Railroad would on occasion lease power from the B&L. Small 4-4-0, 4-6-0, and 0-4-0 locomotives predominated through 1900 partially due to weight restrictions over the line's bridges. After 1900 the 4-4-0 locomotives continued to provide the bulk of the power for passenger service with class B-14 and B-15 2-6-0, class L-1 4-8-0, and class A-41-f 4-4-0 locomotives mixed in for longer and freight trips. During WWII K-8-b and K-8-c class 2-8-0 locomotives worked the larger ammunition trains on the eastern end of the line. J-1 class 4-4-2 locomotives generally handled passenger service during the war and into the 1950s. Diesel power arrived in the mid-1950s with EMD SW9 switchers regularly assigned to the Marlborough local freight starting in June 1953. Road switchers equipped with steam generators took over passenger service on the Central Massachusetts Branch starting in 1956. Budd Rail Diesel Cars quickly replaced the road switchers for passenger service beginning in the late 1950s and continued service in that capacity until passenger service ceased in 1971.\n\nThe Central Massachusetts Railroad built its stations in the Gothic-inspired Victorian style of architecture popular during the 1870s. The name of the architect responsible for their design has been lost to time. Cost restrictions played heavily into the station designs though the railroad added decorations such as painted wainscotting and gables for aesthetics. All of the stations were wooden and based on one of two basic plans for smaller or larger communities. Individual stations were often tailored to their location, including additions such as attached or separate freight houses and milk sheds which were similarly decorated to appear presentable to the public. Other structures such as engine houses, water towers, section houses, and crossing shanties were not decorated. To create the illusion of variety the railroad never used the same design on two consecutive stations except at Waverly and Belmont where the consistent design helped passengers distinguish the Central Massachusetts Railroad stations from those of the parallel Fitchburg Railroad.\n\nThe station listing on the Central Massachusetts Railroad changed many times over the line's history thanks to leases, ownership changes, and rerouting. The list below is from the 1920 Boston and Maine Southern Division employees' timetable. The listings with grayed-out backgrounds are the stations between West Berlin Junction and Oakdale that the railroad abandoned during the construction of the Wachusett Reservoir. The italicized mileage numbers for these stations indicate their position on the line in the 1892 employees' timetable.\n\n\n"}

Sunday River included one double chair and a couple of surface lifts at the time. Sunday River slowly grew to become New England's second most popular resort in the 1990s.\n\nIn 1994, Otten formed LBO Resort Enterprises Corp and purchased Attitash Bear Peak in New Hampshire. By 1995, Sugarbush, Vermont was added to the portfolio of LBO resorts.\n\nIn 1996, Otten purchased Mount Cranmore in the Mount Washington Valley of New Hampshire. Later that year, Otten sought to purchase S-K-I Ltd., owners of Killington, Mount Snow, and Haystack, Vermont, Waterville Valley, New Hampshire, and controlling interest in Sugarloaf, Maine. Because of monopoly concerns, the company was only allowed to purchase Killington, Mount Snow, Haystack, and Sugarloaf. Upon acquiring S-K-I Ltd., LBO Resort Enterprises was renamed the American Skiing Company\n\nBy 1997, the company expanded west, buying Wolf Mountain in Park City, Utah. It quickly was transformed into The Canyons, now the largest resort in Utah. In 1998, the company, now known as American Skiing Company went public on the New York Stock Exchange and purchased Heavenly, California and Steamboat, Colorado from Kamori International. All American Skiing Company resorts have a \"Grand Summit Hotel\", a condominium-hotel in which investors were to buy a quarter of a year ownership of the hotel room units. The income from these condo quarter-shares was intended to be key to finances of the company. \n\nBy the time the new millennium rolled around, Les Otten had left the company amidst a huge debt crises; their earnings had not kept pace with their growth. William (BJ) Fair took over as CEO. As the huge debts racked up, ASC was forced to sell Heavenly to Vail Resorts, Steamboat to Intrawest, and Sugarbush to a group of investors.\n\nIn January 2007, rumors surfaced that ASC might be in the process of selling Killington and Pico to Powdr Corporation, and Attitash and Mount Snow to Peak Resorts. It was later confirmed in a letter to the All For One pass holders that Mount Snow and Attitash had been sold to Peak Resorts and that Killington and Pico have been sold to SP Land Company, LLC, who will join with Powdr in a new venture to operate the two mountains.\n\nIn June 2007, ASC announced plans to sell Sunday River and Sugarloaf to Boyne Resorts.\n\nFinally in July 2008, it was announced that American Skiing Company's last remaining and flagship resort, The Canyons had been bought by the Talisker Corporation for $100 million. This was the final resort sold by the American Skiing Company, in preparation for the dissolution of the company.\n"}

It was established in 1975 to provide railroad transportation services on portions of the Boston & Maine Wheelwright Branch in and around their trackage in Bondsville (a village of Palmer) and Ware, and later between Palmer and South Barre on the old Right of Way (ROW) of the Ware River Railroad.\n\nThe old Ware River Railroad was an independent line that ran from Palmer to the Cheshire Railroad in Winchendon and was built in 1868. The first section, from Palmer to Gilbertville, opened in 1870, and the rest three years later.\n\nUntil 1873 it was leased to and operated by the New London Northern Railroad, it was eventually taken over by the Boston and Albany Railroad and run as its Winchendon Branch.\n\nThe B&A wanted to run the Ware River Line in conjunction with the Monadnock Railroad in order to gain access to the resort areas of Peterborough, NH. When the B&A failed to gain control of the Monadnock, the Ware River Line was not very profitable.\n\nBy 1968, the line came under the control of the Penn Central and tracks were abandoned between South Barre and Waterville, splitting the line in two. The Boston and Maine Railroad took over the line from Waterville to Winchendon and operated it until it was abandoned in 1984.\n\nThe Penn Central continued to operate the line south of Barre, but in 1975 all service between Gilbertville and South Barre were discontinued. Conrail operated the line between Palmer and Ware and applied for abandonment of the remainder of the line. The Commonwealth of Massachusetts acquired most of the line, excepting a few miles in Palmer to the Palmer Depot and the B&A main line. The State contracted out the continued service to the newly formed Consolidated Rail Corp. (Conrail). By 1975, the MCER, or as it later became known—the MassCentral. It was formed by three individuals from Western Massachusetts, and started limited operations on a few miles of the Boston & Maine trackage in and around the Ware Yard. After a year of Conrail operations on the State-owned line, the contract was awarded to the MassCentral. The train rarely ran north of Ware until 1999 when a new rail customer, a \"reload\", justified restored freight service to South Barre. Service to half a dozen customers from Palmer Village up to the Reload at South Barre continues to the present, five days a week from its interchange with CSX. From the former Intermodal Yard around mile post one next to the ex Central Vermont Railroad main line (1 customer), with other customers located at the Gibbs Crossing Transload Yard (2); in and around Ware Yard (4); and at the \"Wildwood Reload\" at South Barre (1), where numerous customers are provided rail to truck services, including warehousing and transloading by the reload.\n\n"}

It is located north-northeast of Ukiah, at an elevation of 948 feet (289 m). It is located at the headwaters of the East Fork of the Russian River. The CDP population was 646 at the 2010 census.\n\nIn 1852, when William and Thomas Potter and Mose Briggs first entered what would become known as Potter Valley, they were searching for the headwaters of the Russian River from their base in Sonoma County. The Pomo people called it \"Ba-lo Kai\". They found three Pomo villages (each about 500 people strong), the Russian headwaters, and a lush valley with wild oats \"stirrup high\". Eventually the Potters returned to settle there, and the valley became known by the American ranchers' name.\n\nThe post office opened in 1870.\n\nPainter Grace Hudson was born in Potter Valley in 1865.\n\nIn addition to his famous Ridgewood Ranch, Charles S. Howard, the owner of the racehorse Seabiscuit, owned a ranch in Potter Valley where he ran cattle and occasionally secluded Seabiscuit when visitors became bothersome.\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the Census Designated Place (CDP) covers an area of 4.1 square miles (10.5 km²), 99.30% of it land, and 0.70% of it water.\n\nHowever, the CDP does not cover the full area of the geographic Potter Valley floor. The actual size of the valley is closer to 12 square miles and the area served by the Potter Valley Community Unified School District is 157.21 square miles.\n\nThe 2010 United States Census reported that the Potter Valley CDP had a population of 646. The population density was 159.2 people per square mile (61.5/km²).

{"id": "1983838", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1983838", "title": "Angiomotin", "text": "Angiomotin\n\nAngiomotin (AMOT) is a protein that in humans is encoded by the \"AMOT\" gene. It belongs to the motin family of angiostatin binding proteins, which includes angiomotin, angiomotin-like 1 (AMOTL1) and angiomotin-like 2 (AMOTL2) characterized by coiled-coil domains at N-terminus and consensus PDZ-binding domain at the C-terminus. Angiomotin is expressed predominantly in endothelial cells of capillaries as well as angiogenic tissues such as placenta and solid tumor.\n\nAngiomotin was discovered in 2001 by screening a placenta yeast two-hybrid cDNA library for angiostatin-binding peptides, using a construct encoding the kringle domains 1-4 of angiostatin.\n\n\"AMOT\" gene is located on human chromosome X:112,021,794-112,066,354, containing 3252 nucleotides in coding sequence as 11 exons.\n\nTwo splice isoforms are known for angiomotin: p80 and p130. The alternative splicing is somewhat tissue specific. Cells expressing p130 contained more actin than those expressing p80. p80 is not the product of cleavage of p130, as p130 contains no potential proteolytic cleavage site for such conversion.\n\nAngiomotin p80 is a 72.54 kD protein of 675 residues, characterized by conserved N-terminal coiled coil domains and C-terminal PDZ binding motifs, with angiostatin binding domain (ABD) located in the central region. It is hypothesized that the ABD is extracellular, while the coiled-coil and the PDZ binding domain are intracellular. The PDZ-binding motif of angiomotin serves as a protein recognition site and deletion of as few as three amino acids from the C-terminal results in complete loss of pro-migratory activity, and endothelial cells expressing such mutant angiomotin failed to migrate or form tubes.\n\nAngiomotin p130 differs from p80 by having an N-terminal cytoplasmic extension of 409 amino acids rich in glutamine, which mediates the binding of p130 to F-actin and tight cell-cell junctions. This binding remains after destabilizing actin with cytochalasin B.\n\nLike other surface-associated proteins that can bind plasminogen and its derivatives, angiomotin does not appear to have a signal sequence, thus its association with the cell surface may be via protein–protein interaction usually referred to as non-classic secretion.\n\nExpression of angiomotin p80 in endothelial cells increases the random migration of endothelial cells, as well as the migration of endothelial cells toward growth factors, e.g. bFGF, VEGF and LPA etc. Angiomotin also mediates tube formation of endothelial cells. Angiomotin promotes angiogenesis by both stimulating cell spreading and stabilizing established tubes, e.g. in mouse aortic endothelial (MAE) cells the tubes remained stable for over 30 days, while control tubes started to regress after 3 days. In the presence of angiostatin, endothelial cells expressing angiomotin p80 exhibit reduction in migration as well as reduction in tubules formation in vitro. These observations are consistent with the localization of angiomotin in the leading edge of migrating cells. Angiostatin therefore, is an inhibitor of angiomotin.\n\nAngiomotin p80 locates and binds angiostatin on the cell surface. In primary endothelial of Chinese hamster ovary, it localizes to cell-cell junction, recruits ZO-1 and interacts with MAGI-1. It may play a role in the assembly of endothelial cell-cell junctions, as well.\n\nAngiomotin p130 does not promote cell migration, nor responds to angiostatin. It localizes to cell-cell junction like p80 and regulates paracellular permeability. Its N-terminal domain localizes to actin fibers and stabilizes them, and this effect is not affected by angiostatin. Transfection of p130 angiomotin into MAE cells results in change in cell shape, increased average cell size and stress fiber formation. So p80 is involved in cell migration and expressed during migratory phase. While p130 controls cell shape by interaction with actin, and is expressed during the period of blood vessel stabilization and maturation. The relative expression levels of p80 and p130 regulate a switch between a migratory and a non-migratory cell phenotype, where homo-oligomerization of p80 and hetero-oligomerization of both isoforms are critical for this regulation.\n\nAMOT, AMOTL1 and AMOTL2 play critical roles in the Hippo signaling pathway by regulating the subcellular localization of the co-activators YAP (Yes-associated protein) and TAZ (transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif), and activating LATS2 through a novel conserved domain. The activity of YAP and TAZ can be restricted through their interaction with AMOT and AMOTL1, and such interaction depends on the WW domain of TAZ and the Proline-Proline-x–Tyrosine motif at the N-terminus of AMOT.\n\nIn position-dependent Hippo signaling, where the outer and inner cells are polar and nonpolar respectively, AMOT and AMOTL2 are essential for Hippo pathway activation and appropriate cell fate specification. In the nonpolar inner cells, AMOT localizes to adherens junctions (AJs), and Ser-176 at the N-terminal domain is phosphorylated by LATS downstream of GPCR signaling, which inhibits actin binding activity and stabilizes the AMOT-LATS interaction to activate the Hippo pathway. Thus, AMOT is a direct substrate of LATS and its phosphorylation at Ser-176 inhibits cell migration and angiogenesis. In the outer cells, the cell polarity sequesters AMOT from basolateral adherens junctions to apical domains, thereby suppressing Hippo signaling. It is therefore proposed AMOT acts as a molecular switch for Hippo pathway and links F-actin with LATS activity.\n\nAlong the Hippo pathway, AMOT's binding to Merlin releases its auto-inhibition and promotes Merlin's binding to LATS1/2. Phosphorylation of Ser-518 outside the Merlin's auto-inhibitory tail prevents binding and thus inhibits Hippo pathway kinase activation. USP9x regulates the ubiquitin-mediated turnover of AMOT, and the deubiquitylation of AMOT results in its stabilization and lower YAP/TAZ activity.\n\nA DNA vaccination targeting angiomotin generated antibodies that detected AMOT on the endothelial cell surface, which inhibited migration. It blocked angiogenesis and prevented growth of transplanted tumors for up to 150 days \"in vivo\". A combination of DNA vaccines encoding AMOT and the extracellular and transmembrane domains of the human EGF receptor 2 (Her-2)/neu oncogene inhibited breast cancer progression and impaired tumor vascularization in Her-2/neu transgenic mice, showing DNA vaccination targeting AMOT may be used to mimic the effect of angiostatin and no toxicity or impairment of normal blood vessels was detected.\n\nIn human breast cancer tissues, AMOT is highly expressed compared with control, and its level is associated with other angiogenesis markers. AMOT links to the proliferation and invasion of breast tumours and the long-term survival of the patients, and could be a potential target for therapy.\n\nFor melanoma, AMOT binds a variant of soluble cell adhesion molecule (sCD146) in endothelial progenitor cells (EPC). Silencing AMOT in EPC inhibits the angiogenic effect of sCD146, e.g. EPC migration, proliferation, and capacity to form capillary-like structures in Matrigel.\n\n"}

Such boards are formally designated to approve (or reject), monitor, and review biomedical and behavioral research involving humans. They often conduct some form of risk-benefit analysis in an attempt to determine whether or not research should be conducted. The purpose of the IRB is to assure that appropriate steps are taken to protect the rights and welfare of humans participating as subjects in a research study. Along with developed countries, many developing countries have established national, regional or local Institutional Review Boards in order to safeguard ethical conduct of research concerning both national and international norms, regulations or codes.\n\nA key goal of IRBs is to protect human subjects from physical or psychological harm, which they attempt to do by reviewing research protocols and related materials. The protocol review assesses the ethics of the research and its methods, promotes fully informed and voluntary participation by prospective subjects capable of making such choices (or, if that is not possible, informed permission given by a suitable proxy), and seeks to maximize the safety of subjects.\n\nIn the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Department of Health and Human Services (specifically Office for Human Research Protections) regulations (see Human subject research legislation in the United States) have empowered IRBs to approve, require modifications in planned research prior to approval, or disapprove research. IRBs are responsible for critical oversight functions for research conducted on human subjects that are \"scientific\", \"ethical\", and \"regulatory\". The equivalent body responsible for overseeing U.S. federally funded research using animals is the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).\n\nIRBs are most commonly used for studies in the fields of health and the social sciences, including anthropology, sociology, and psychology. Such studies may be clinical trials of new drugs or devices, studies of personal or social behavior, opinions or attitudes, or studies of how health care is delivered and might be improved.\n\nFormal review procedures for institutional human subject studies were originally developed in direct response to research abuses in the 20th century. Among the most notorious of these abuses were the experiments of Nazi physicians, which became a focus of the post-World War II Doctors' Trial, the Tuskegee Syphilis Study, a long-term project conducted between 1932 and 1972 by the U.S. Public Health Service, and numerous human radiation experiments conducted during the Cold War. Other controversial U.S. projects undertaken during this era include the Milgram obedience experiment, the Stanford prison experiment, and Project MKULTRA, a series of classified mind control studies organized by the CIA.\n\nThe result of these abuses was the National Research Act of 1974 and the development of the Belmont Report, which outlined the primary ethical principles in human subjects review; these include \"respect for persons\", \"beneficence\", and \"justice\". An IRB may only approve research for which the risks to subjects are balanced by potential benefits to society, and for which the selection of subjects presents a fair or just distribution of risks and benefits to eligible participants. A \"bona fide\" process for obtaining informed consent from participants is also generally needed. However, this requirement may be waived in certain circumstances – for example, when the risk of harm to participants is clearly minimal.\n\nIn the United States, IRBs are governed by Title 45 Code of Federal Regulations Part 46. These regulations define the rules and responsibilities for institutional review, which is required for all research that receives support, directly or indirectly, from the United States federal government. IRBs are themselves regulated by the Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Additional requirements apply to IRBs that oversee clinical trials of drugs involved in new drug applications, or to studies that are supported by the United States Department of Defense.\n\nIn addition to registering its IRB with the OHRP, an institution is also required to obtain and maintain a \"Federalwide Assurance\" or FWA, before undertaking federally funded human research. This is an agreement in which the institution commits to abiding by the regulations governing human research. A secondary supplement to the FWA is required when institutions are undertaking research supported by the U.S. Department of Defense. This \"DoD Addendum\" includes further compliance requirements for studies using military personnel, or when the human research involves populations in conflict zones, foreign prisoners, etc.\n\nU.S. regulations identify several research categories that are considered exempt from IRB oversight. These categories include: \n\nGenerally, human research ethics guidelines require that decisions about exemption are made by an IRB representative, not by the investigators themselves.\n\nNumerous other countries have equivalent regulations or guidelines governing human subject studies and the ethics committees that oversee them. However, the organizational responsibilities and the scope of the oversight purview can differ substantially from one nation to another, especially in the domain of non-medical research. The United States Department of Health and Human Services maintains a comprehensive compilation of regulations and guidelines in other countries, as well as related standards from a number of international and regional organizations.\n\nAlthough \"IRB\" is a generic term used in the United States by the FDA and HHS, each institution that establishes such a board may use whatever name it chooses. Many simply capitalize the term \"Institutional Review Board\" as the proper name of their instance. Regardless of the name chosen, the IRB is subject to the FDA's IRB regulations when studies of FDA-regulated products are reviewed and approved. At one time such a committee was named the \"Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects\". Originally, IRBs were simply committees at academic institutions and medical facilities to monitor research studies involving human participants, primarily to minimize or avoid ethical problems. Today, some of these reviews are conducted by for-profit organizations known as 'independent' or 'commercial' IRBs. The responsibilities of these IRBs are identical to those based at academic or medical institutions, and they are governed by the same U.S. federal regulations.\n\nThe regulations set out the board's membership and composition requirements, with provisions for diversity in experience, expertise, and institutional affiliation. For example, the minimum number of members is five, at least one scientist, and at least one non-scientist. The guidance strongly suggests that the IRB contain both men and women, but there is no regulatory requirement for gender balance in the IRB's membership. The full requirements are set out in 21 CFR 56.107.\n\nUnless a research proposal is determined to be exempt (see below), the IRB undertakes its work either in a convened meeting (a \"full\" review) or by using an expedited review procedure. When a full review is required, a majority of the IRB members must be present at the meeting, at least one of whom has primary concern for the nonscientific aspects of the research. The research can be approved if a majority of those present are in favor.\n\nAn expedited review may be carried out if the research involves no more than minimal risk to subjects, or where minor changes are being made to previously approved research. The regulations provide a list of research categories that may be reviewed in this manner. An expedited review is carried out by the IRB chair, or by their designee(s) from the board membership. Research activity cannot be disapproved by expedited review.\n\nThe International Conference on Harmonisation sets out guidelines for registration of pharmaceuticals in multiple countries. It defines Good Clinical Practice (GCP), which is an agreed quality standard that governments can transpose into regulations for clinical trials involving human subjects.\n\nHere is a summary of several key regulatory guidelines for oversight of clinical trials:\n\n\nThe reviewers may also request that more information be given to subjects when, in their judgment, the additional information would add meaningfully to the protection of the rights, safety and/or well-being of the subjects. When a non-therapeutic trial is to be carried out with the consent of the subject's legally acceptable representative, reviewers should determine that the proposed protocol and/or other document(s) adequately address relevant ethical concerns and meets applicable regulatory requirements for such trials. Where the protocol indicates prior consent of the trial subject or the subject's legally acceptable representative is not possible, the review should determine that the proposed protocol and/or other document(s) adequately addresses relevant ethical concerns and meets applicable regulatory requirements for such trials (i.e., in emergency situations).\n\nWhile the Belmont principles and U.S. federal regulations were formulated with biomedical and social-behavioral research in mind, the enforcement of the regulations, the examples used in typical presentations regarding the history of the regulatory requirements, and the extensiveness of written guidance have been predominantly focused on biomedical research.\n\nNumerous complaints by investigators about the fit between the federal regulations and its IRB review requirements as they relate to social science research have been received. Broad complaints range from the legitimacy of IRB review, the applicability of the concepts of risk as it pertains to social science (e.g., possibly unneeded, over-burdensome requirements), and the requirements for the documentation of participants' informed consent (i.e., consent forms). Researchers have tried to determine under what instances participants are more likely to read informed consent forms, and ways to improve their efficacy in the social sciences. Social scientists have criticized biomedical IRBs for failing to adequately understand their research methods (such as ethnography). In 2003, the Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP), in conjunction with the Oral History Association and American Historical Association, issued a formal statement that taking oral histories, unstructured interviews (as if for a piece of journalism), collecting anecdotes, and similar free speech activities often do not constitute \"human subject research\" as defined in the regulations and were never intended to be covered by clinical research rules.\n\nOther federal agencies supporting social science have attempted to provide guidance in this area, especially the National Science Foundation. In general, the NSF guidelines assure IRBs that the regulations have some flexibility and rely on the common sense of the IRB to focus on limiting harm, maximizing informed consent, and limiting bureaucratic limitations of valid research.\n\nAspects of big data research pose formidable challenges for research ethics and thus show potential for wider applicability of formal review processes. One theme is data breaches, but another with high difficulty is potentially dangerous predictive analytics with unintended consequences, via false-positives or new ways to invade privacy. A 2016 article on the hope to expand ethics reviews of such research included an example of a data breach in which a big data researcher leaked 70,000 OkCupid profiles with usernames and sexual orientation data. It also gave an example of potential privacy invasion and government repression in which machine learning was used to build automated gaydar, labeling strangers as \"probably gay\" based on their facial photographs. Analogies with phrenology and Nazis identifying people as \"probably part-Jewish\" based on facial features have been made to show what can go wrong with research whose authors may have failed to adequately think through the risks of harm. Such challenges broach familiar themes, such as mistaken identity, pre-crime, and persecution, in new applications.\n\nWhile the IRB approval and oversight process is designed to protect the rights and welfare of the research subjects, it has been the subject of criticism, by bioethicists and others, for conflicts of interest resulting in lax oversight. In 2005, the for-profit Western Institutional Review Board claimed to conduct the majority of reviews for new drug submissions to the FDA. In a 2006 study of 575 IRB members at university medical centers, over one-third reported industry financial ties and over one-third admitted they \"rarely or never\" disclosed conflicts of interest to other board members.\n\nIn 2009 the Government Accountability Office (GAO) set up a series of undercover tests to determine whether the IRB system was vulnerable to unethical manipulation. In one test, a fake product \"Adhesiabloc\" was submitted to a number of IRBs for approval for human tests. The product, company, and CVs of the supposed researchers were all fictitious and documents were forged by the GAO. The product was deliberately formulated to match some \"significant risk\" criteria of the FDA and was described by GAO as a \"gel that would be poured into a patient’s stomach after surgery to collect the bits and pieces left over from an operation.\" Despite this, one IRB approved the device for human testing. Other IRBs to whom the device was submitted rejected the application, one of them saying it was \"the riskiest thing I’ve ever seen on this board\". However, none of the IRBs approached detected that the company and product were fake. The GAO also set up a fake IRB and obtained requests for approval from companies. They succeeded in getting assurance approval from the HHS for their fake IRB. HHS has only three staff to deal with 300 IRB registrations and 300 assurance applications per month. HHS stated that it would not be worthwhile to carry out additional evaluation even if they had the staff to do it.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1983850", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1983850", "title": "Big bet", "text": "Big bet\n\nA big bet (BB) is the larger of two fixed bet amounts in a fixed-limit poker game. A big bet is used in the final rounds of a game to increase the pot amount and thereby enable the possibility of a bluff. Big bets are generally double the wager of the initial or \"small bet\". Any multi-round poker game can use big bets to standardize wagers while maintaining a sufficient risk-ratio to encourage bluffing. Casino poker tables use big bets to set a limit to the amount of money a patron can lose in each wager.\n\nBig bets are used in place of variable limit raises to add considerable risk to staying in a game until a hand is shown. This added risk enables other players to bluff or to win a considerable pot when proving that they weren't bluffing. Other methods of adding structure to poker games include buy-in limits and maximum raise limits. Some sort of table or bet limits are required in poker to keep a person with the \"deepest pockets\" from \"buying the game.\"\n\nWhile any multi-round poker game can use big bets, the unlimited buy-in nature of casino style play is best suited for BB limits. Casinos can advertise the relatively low maximum wager of the BB as a way of attracting players, and players can join the table at any time.\n\nBig bets are used in draw poker during the final round of betting to weed out tentative players. In theory, only those committed to their hand after seeing their final cards will be motivated to wager twice as much as their previous bet. In practice, however, additional motivation for players to fold is usually needed in a single draw game such as: a half-pot limit, a pot limit, or a spread limit. No limit poker is only employed when table limits are imposed, thereby disallowing casino guests to join the table after play has started.\n\nIn a $2/$4 Texas hold 'em game, the \"big bet\" would be $4, wagered in each bet of the last two cards. The $2 would be the \"small bet\", wagered during all other bets of the game. Given that a \"small bet\" is generally half of a \"big bet\" and that a \"small blind\" is generally half of the \"small bet\", the minimum BB in casino style holdem is four cents. On the other side of the scale, the largest required BB in regular play is that of $8000 at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. At this table, professionals like Doyle Brunson, Phil Ivey, Daniel Negreanu, Chau Giang, and Gus Hansen, along with wealthy tourists, are required to wager $8000 in each bet of each of the final two rounds of the game.\n\nBig bets are used in Omaha poker to allow buy-ins of players at any time. Omaha Eight-or-Better has a greater odds of winning and therefore less motivation to fold with a tentative hand. For that reason Omaha Eight-or-Better is sometimes played in a pot limit betting structure instead of big bets.\n\nBig bets are used in seven-card stud, generally after the last upcard, to motivate tentative players who already have a lot of money in the pot to fold anyway. By the last upcard, seven-card stud players have wagered an ante and three rounds of betting. With that much money already in the pot, there is little motivation to drop out during the final two rounds of betting, especially when there is a possibility that another player may be bluffing. The effect of adding the requirement of a big bet to the final two rounds of seven-card stud betting is that the game becomes one more of skill than of luck.\n"}

It is similar to collage, a two-dimensional medium. It is part of the visual arts, and it typically uses found objects, but is not limited to these materials.\n\nThe origin of the art form dates to the cubist constructions of Pablo Picasso c. 1912–1914. The origin of the word (in its artistic sense) can be traced back to the early 1950s, when Jean Dubuffet created a series of collages of butterfly wings, which he titled \"assemblages d'empreintes\". However, Marcel Duchamp, Pablo Picasso and others had been working with found objects for many years prior to Dubuffet. Russian artist Vladimir Tatlin created his \"counter-reliefs\" in the mid 1910s. Alongside Tatlin, the earliest woman artist to try her hand at assemblage was Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven, the Dada Baroness. In Paris in the 1920s Alexander Calder, Jose De Creeft, Picasso and others began making fully 3-dimensional works from metal scraps, found metal objects and wire. In the U.S., one of the earliest and most prolific assemblage artists was Louise Nevelson, who began creating her sculptures from found pieces of wood in the late 1930s.\n\nIn the 1950s and 60s assemblage started to become more widely known and used. Artists like Robert Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns started using scrappy materials and objects to make anti-aesthetic art sculptures, a big part of the ideas that make assemblage what it is.\n\nThe painter Armando Reverón is one of the first to use this technique when using disposable materials such as bamboo, wires, or kraft paper. In the thirties he made a skeleton with wings of mucilage, adopting this style years before other artists. Later, Reverón made instruments and set pieces such as a telephone, a sofa, a sewing machine, a piano and even music books with their scores.\n\nIn 1961, the exhibition \"The Art of Assemblage\" was featured at the New York Museum of Modern Art. The exhibition showcased the work of early 20th-century European artists such as Braque, Dubuffet, Marcel Duchamp, Picasso, and Kurt Schwitters alongside Americans Man Ray, Joseph Cornell, Robert Mallary and Robert Rauschenberg, and also included less well known American West Coast assemblage artists such as George Herms, Bruce Conner and Edward Kienholz. William C Seitz, the curator of the exhibition, described assemblages as being made up of preformed natural or manufactured materials, objects, or fragments not intended as art materials.\n\n\n"}

She is best known for her appearances with World Class Championship Wrestling and Jim Crockett Promotions in the 1980s.\n\nRoberts was born in Lubbock, Texas to Nick Roberts and Lorraine Johnson. Both Nick Roberts and Johnson were professional wrestlers and promoted weekly events at the Fair Park Coliseum. During her childhood, Roberts sold programs at her father's events, in the process befriending future wrestlers Bruce and Keith Hart and Kerry and Kevin Von Erich. From an early age, Roberts aimed to become a professional wrestler.\n\nIn the summer of 1984, while training to become an emergency medical technician (EMT), Roberts overheard her parents say that her childhood crush, World Class Championship Wrestling (WCCW) wrestler Gino Hernandez, was in need of a valet. Unbeknownst to her parents, Roberts contacted David Manning, the WCCW booker, and proposed that she could manage Hernandez. After Manning agreed, Roberts left college and traveled to San Antonio, Texas, making her debut alongside Hernandez in the sold-out Freeman Coliseum. She went on to train under Nelson Royal for the remainder of the summer.\n\nPerforming under the ring name Andrea, the Lady Giant (a reference to André the Giant), Roberts was booked to dominate both male and female wrestlers in the ring. Her character had a punk haircut and typically wore leather pants, a leather jacket, metal studded belts, spiked dog collars and wristbands and scarves and T-shirts relating to rock bands such as Aerosmith and Mötley Crüe. Hernandez and Roberts feuded with Mike Von Erich and his manager, Sunshine.\n\nRoberts left WCCW in December 1984. In February 1985, she joined the National Wrestling Alliance member Jim Crockett Promotions (JCP). She was introduced by Tully Blanchard as his new manager, \"The Perfect 10\" Baby Doll. She assisted Blanchard during his feuds with Dusty Rhodes and Magnum T.A.. After Rhodes defeated Blanchard for the NWA World Television Championship at The Great American Bash on July 6, 1985, Roberts was forced to be Rhodes' valet for 30 days. During this time, vignettes aired in which Rhodes tried to turn her into a \"real lady.\" \n\nIn December 1985, JCP ran an angle to get J.J. Dillon in as Blanchard's manager. Baby Doll was missing from Blanchard's side for some time and then returned on December 28th at a house show. Tully confronted her in an interview and demanded to know where she had been. The angle played out that J.J. had given her a ticket to Mexico and said it was from Tully for her Christmas present. Dillon denied it and Tully hit Baby Doll who was then \"saved\" by Dusty Rhodes.\n\nDuring a weekly Monday night television taping in Greenville, South Carolina in 1986, Jim Cornette and Beautiful Bobby Eaton attacked Roberts with a tennis racquet. She responded by introducing The Warlord as her newest client. The Warlord briefly feuded with Big Bubba Rogers before leaving JCP to further his training. At the 1986 Great American Bash on July 5, 1986, Roberts, Rhodes and Magnum T.A. defeated Cornette and The Midnight Express in a steel cage match. In addition to Rhodes and Magnum T.A., She also teamed with the Rock and Roll Express and the Road Warriors against Cornette and the Midnight Express throughout the 1986 Great American Bash Tour.\n\nOn August 9, 1986, Roberts turned on Rhodes, helping Ric Flair retain the NWA World Heavyweight Championship during a title bout with Rhodes in St. Louis, Missouri. Roberts briefly managed Flair before the JCP booking office sent her to the NWA Central States territory due to their disapproval of her marriage to fellow wrestler Michael \"Sam Houston\" Smith.\n\nIn 1987, Roberts left JCP and joined the Oklahoma City, Oklahoma-based Universal Wrestling Federation (UWF) alongside her husband. Upon leaving the UWF, she began appearing on the independent circuit with Houston.\n\nIn 1988, Roberts returned to Jim Crockett Promotions, managing Larry Zbyszko during his feud with Barry Windham over the NWA Western States Heritage Championship. Her tenure was short lived as her husband was then working for the rival World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in what was regarded as a conflict of interest.\n\nRoberts heard about the WWF restarting their women's division and trained with Nelson Royal to improve her ring-skills alongside her sister-in-law Robin Smith. Both tried out with the WWF, but Smith was chosen over Roberts.\n\nAt the inaugural WrestleReunion event on January 29, 2005 in Tampa, Florida, Roberts accompanied Jeff Jarrett to ringside for his successful defense of the NWA World Heavyweight Championship in a bout with Tully Blanchard. She went on to manage a number of wrestlers on the independent circuit throughout the late 2000s (decade). In 2016, Baby Doll appeared for Big Time Wrestling in Spartanburg, South Carolina, and Morganton, North Carolina in \"Battle of the Sexes\" matches vs. Jim Cornette.\n\nWhile at high school, Roberts set several records for the shot put.\n\nRoberts married fellow wrestler Michael \"Sam Houston\" Smith on July 30, 1986 in Lubbock, Texas. She gave birth to two daughters; Mikka Tyler Smith, in 1991, and Mikala Joy Smith, in 1992. Roberts retired from professional wrestling upon the birth of her second daughter, opting to devote her time to her children. She and Smith separated in 1991, briefly reconciled in 1992 and ultimately were divorced on February 17, 1995.\n\nAfter retiring from professional wrestling, Roberts worked in a number of fields, including baggage handling, cable installation, the manufacture of apparel for wrestlers and 13 years at Wal-Mart.\n\nNickla married Chad Byrd on July 4, 2017; they reside in Caldwell County, North Carolina.\n\n"}

Mogue Kearns attacked the garrison at Bunclody as part of the Wexford rebels campaign against border garrisons.(which border?) \n\nThe garrison was forewarned of the approaching rebels and had prepared defensive outposts facing the rebel line of advance. The rebel army occupied high ground to the west and stationed an artillery piece, captured in their victory over the military at the battle of Three Rocks, facing the approaches to town. As the bulk of the rebel army formed for the attack, their gunners opened an accurate fire on the exposed lines of soldiers who retreated into the cover of the town.\n\nSeizing the moment, the rebels quickly moved in, forcing the garrison to flee across the bridge into County Carlow but crucially, failed to occupy this approach to the town. The rebels now had an almost bloodless victory and numbers of them began to celebrate, roaming the town in search of plunder and enemies. As rebel discipline began to waver, trapped units of yeomen, some of whom had barricaded themselves into their own houses, opened fire on the unsuspecting rebels milling in the streets outside.\n\nMeanwhile, the garrison had paused in their retreat and upon hearing the sound of gunfire from the town, turned about and launched a surprise attack back across the bridge, which caught the rebels, distracted by the unexpected pockets of resistance, completely by surprise. In the rout that followed 400 of the rebels were killed and their army scattered for the loss of no more than half a dozen of the military.\n"}
{"id": "1983901", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1983901", "title": "Skool Daze", "text": "Skool Daze\n\nSkool Daze is a computer game released by Microsphere in 1984 for the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC, Atari 8 bit and Oric computers. It was written by David Reidy, with graphics designed by Keith Warrington. The game was commercially and critically successful, and praised for its original concept. It has since been regarded as one of the pioneers of the sandbox game genre.\n\nThe game features the player as a schoolboy named Eric, with the objective of stealing his report card out of the staff room safe by accomplishing various tasks around the school. The computer controls all the other characters in the game, including the headmaster, other teachers and other pupils.\n\nThe four teachers are Mr Wacker (the headmaster), Mr Rockitt (the science teacher), Mr Withit (the geography teacher) and Mr Creak (the history master). Other than Eric, three of the pupils are named: Boy Wander (the tearaway), Angelface (the bully) and Einstein (the swot). The player has the option of renaming the characters before the game begins. There are also many unnamed, undistinguished pupils at the school.\n\nIf Eric is caught out of class or otherwise misbehaving, teacher characters pursue him and issue lines. When 10,000 lines or more are accumulated, the game ends with Eric's expulsion. However, Eric can also receive lines for things that are not his fault, such as lying or sitting on the floor when in fact he has been knocked down, or being nearest a teacher who has just been hit by a projectile fired by one of the other pupils. So part of the challenge of the game is to prevent other pupils from getting Eric into trouble.\n\nHelen Reidy had a background in teaching, while David had fonder memories of activities between lessons and designed the game around this. The characters were based on schoolboy characters he read about as a child, including \"Just William\" and \"The Beano's\" \"The Bash Street Kids\". He later clarified that \"each of the rooms would look like a frame in a comic\".\n\nDavid Reidy considered himself to be more proficient as a programmer and engineer, and decided the game's graphics would benefit from a separate designer. He recruited a family friend, Keith Warrington, who was studying graphic design. Warrington learned the rudiments of computer graphics from David, and drew the characters as line drawings on squared paper. From this, he blocked in the individual pixels to create an appropriate sprite, with tracing paper to design the individual animation frames for each character. He later obtained a Spectrum to assist with the design, but found using graph paper easier. Warrington based the teachers on ones that had taught him at school, and later said the geography teacher, Mr Withit, was based on \"my all time favourite teacher\". He found the screen resolution limitations helpful, as it forced him to design cartoon-like characters, saying \"You couldn’t do a normal person because they would have all looked the same\". As with other Microsphere games, David designed the program on paper, which Helen typed into the computer.\n\nThere are plenty of seats in the Exam Room and the White Room but an insufficient number in the Reading Room and Map Room. This is a source of frustration to the player as Eric is constantly shoved out of his seat and punished with lines for sitting on the floor. In the sequel, \"Back To Skool\", this behaviour was altered so that other pupils were not able to push Eric out of his chair (though an examination of the code suggests that this feature is actually a bug).\n\nThe character of Boy Wander would write on blackboards about Microsphere games like \"Wheelie\" and \"Sky Ranger\". In \"Back to Skool\", Boy Wander writes about \"Contact Sam Cruise\".\n\n\"Skool Daze\" was a commercial success when first released, selling 50,000 copies despite very little marketing or promotion. Reidy later realised he could have made more money with an appropriate campaign, and regretted the loss of income due to software piracy, but was still happy that the game was profitable and covered costs.\n\nThe ZX Spectrum version was voted the 4th best game of all time in a special issue of \"Your Sinclair\" magazine in 2004.\n\nZzap!64 reviewed the Commodore 64 version which they found to be graphically and sonically weak, but enjoyable to play due to the innovative gameplay. It was given an overall rating of 78%.\n\nThe game has been recognised as being a pioneer of the sandbox game format, later used by \"Little Computer People\" and \"The Sims\".\n\nThe game was followed by \"Back to Skool\", which expanded the gameplay to include a neighbouring girls' school and a love interest (with the benefit of being able to reduce one's lines), along with stink bombs, mice, water pistols, frogs, sherry and a long-suffering caretaker. An unofficial remake is \"Klass of '99\", a PC edition of \"Skool Daze\" with updated graphics and various changes to the gameplay. Unofficial conversions of \"Skool Daze\" have been made on the Atari 8-bit family, Oric and Amstrad CPC computers.\n\n"}

Nalapura was the capital of Raja Nala of Naisadha, whose love for Damayanti has been mentioned in detail in Mahabharata. When Raja Nala left Damayanti asleep in the forests of Narwar she moved through dense forests and reached Chanderi protecting herself from wild animals. \n\nThe relatively shorter route through forests from Narwar to Chanderi is 200 km. A medieval fortress there was occupied by the Narwarias of the Chambal valley, who were also the founder and rulers of Gwalior, until it was captured by Parihara Rajputs in the 12th century. During the 13th century, the Yajvapala dynasty established its capital at Narwar.\n\nOn 12 August 1602, Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak, Akbar's courtier who also wrote Akbarnama was assassinated at Narwar while he was returning from the Deccan by Vir Singh Bundela (who later became the ruler of Orchha) between Sarai Vir and Antri (near Narwar) in a plot contrived by Akbar's eldest son Prince Salim (who later became the Emperor Jahangir), because Abu'l Fazl was known to oppose the accession of Prince Salim to the throne. His severed head was sent to Salim at Allahabad. Abu'l Fazl was buried at Antri. Abu'l Fazl's son Shaikh Afzal Khan (29 December 1571 – 1613) was later appointed governor of Bihar in 1608 by Jahangir.\n\nIn January 1859, Man Singh, raja of Narwar came across Maratha General Tatya Tope who had escaped alone into the jungles of Paron after being defeated by the British. Tatya befriended Man Singh and decided to stay with him. Man Singh was in dispute with the Maharaja of Gwalior. British successfully negotiated with Man Singh to surrender Tatya to them in return for Man safety of Man Singh's life and protection of his family from any reprisals by the Maharaja of Gwaliar. After this Tope was alone. The British forces had failed to subdue him for over a year. Tope was betrayed into the hands of the British by his trusted friend, Man Singh, while asleep in his camp in the Paron forest. He was captured on 7 April 1859 by a detachment of native infantry from British General Richard John Meade's troops led to him by Man Singh and escorted to Shivpuri where he was tried by a military court. and various other historic and local sources states that the RAYPUR a seat of PAWAIYA CHAUHANS was very powerfull and dominant at that time in this region therefore brittish and scindias tryed to stay away or not to interfere the area controlled by CHAUHANS and some other RAJPOOT\nLANDLORDS and sardars stayed independent. becouse it covers a one of major way to go towards malwa and RAJPUTS are gaining power continuously.\n\nNarwar Fort is situated atop a hill about 500 feet above ground level spread over an area of 8 km², which stands on a steep scarp of the Vindhya Range It is now in a dilapidated condition, but the remains suggest that, in the flourishing days, it might have been only second to the Gwalior Fort in magnificence. The interior of the fort is divided by cross walls into four 'ahata' and 'dholaahata'. The architecture of the fort and palaces is basically Rajput in style with flat ceiling, fluted columns and multifold arches. The inner walls of the palaces have been decorated with bright paint and glass beads. Near the fort are the Jai Stambha, Sati monument, Ladu bungalow, Chhip Mahal, Makardwaj Tal, Kacheri mahal, Sikandar Lodi's Mosque, and Jail Kambha. Traditionally said to have been the capital of Raja Nala of the Sanskrit epic Mahabharata, the town was called Nalapura until the 12th century. From the twelfth century onwards, Narwar was held successively by Kachwaha, Parihar, and Tomar Rajputs (warrior caste) until its capture by the Mughals in the 16th century. It was conquered by the Maratha Maharaja Scindia in the early 19th century. Outside the walled town are memorial pillars of the Tomar chiefs.\n\nNarwar is located at .It has an average elevation of 452 metres (1482 feet).\n\n India census, Narwar had a population of 15,748. Males constitute 53% of the population and females 47%. Narwar has an average literacy rate of 58%, lower than the national average of 59.5%: male literacy is 69%, and female literacy is 45%. In Narwar, 18% of the population is under 6 years of age.\n\n"}

Following Liefeld's departure from that publisher, the character went on to appear in books published by Liefeld's subsequent endeavor, Awesome Comics. A homage to Wonder Woman, Gloriana Demeter is a half-Amazonian, half-Demon warrior.\n\nGlory was the result of an alliance between the Lady Demeter of the Amazonians and the demon Lord Silverfall of the Underworld. Raised in her mother's world and trained by the Amazonians, she emerged as their finest warrior. However, she also struggled to control the savagery which was her paternal gift/curse. Not at home in either Amazonia or the Underworld, Glorianna went to the world of man.\n\nDuring World War II, Glorianna fought for the Allied forces against the Nazis, alongside Supreme. For a time she worked with Die-Hard and SuperPatriot as the team called 'Allies'. She was part of the second and third Brigade teams with other superheroes.\n\nWriter Alan Moore joined Image after leaving DC Comics and spending a period of time working for independent companies. As he did on other Liefeld works like \"Supreme\" and \"Youngblood\", Moore relaunched \"Glory\" in March 1999 under the Awesome Comics line.

A GameCube version was planned, but was cancelled. The Xbox version of the game was only released in North America and Europe, and is not compatible with Xbox 360.\n\nA year after the film, Jack Skellington once again feels Halloween has become dull and repetitive. He talks with Dr. Finkelstein improving the next Halloween with new scares and discoveries. The doctor gives Jack the \"Soul Robber\", a green, whip-like weapon. He then leaves to look for new frights; remembering his lesson from before, Jack searches solely in his world. Equally bored Lock, Shock, and Barrel revive Oogie Boogie, who brainwashes Dr. Finkelstein into creating minions for him. Oogie also kidnaps five of the seven Holiday World leaders. Oogie plans to become the \"Seven-Holidays King\" once he takes control of Christmas Town. But on December 23, Sally manages to send a magical paper airplane to find Jack to warn him of what has happened.\n\nJack returns to Halloween Town on Christmas Eve, just to find Oogie's shadow. After defeating the shadow, he is given the Halloween Holiday Door and finds everyone was deceived by Oogie into boobytrapping the town.\n\nJack learns Sally is imprisoned in a crypt, fighting through Oogie's minions to the graveyard. Once in the crypt, he finds Sally when a giant spider clings her to the ceiling and attacks Jack. Jack defeats the spider, saves Sally and receives the Valentine's Holiday Door. When Jack and Sally walk out of the crypt, she gives Jack an idea to use his Pumpkin King powers to defeat Oogie's monsters.\n\nSally then says she's worried about Dr. Finklestein and Jack goes to find him. Inside the doctor's lab, Jack finds the brainwashed doctor, who attacks him. Jack returns the doctor to normal by switching his brain back. Jack then goes to the Mayor's courtyard to save the Vampire Brothers. Each vampire gives Jack a key to the mayor's house. Jack finds the mayor and stops Lock, Shock, and Barrel; however, they drop him into a huge maze filled with booby traps. Jack escapes the maze and asks the mayor to release the holiday leaders.\n\nJack soon realizes Oogie wants to kill Santa, and travels to Christmas Town. Jack rescues Santa from a train-contraption, but Oogie, having become enraged by Jack constantly foiling his plans, leaves in Santa's sleigh full of Christmas presents. Luckily, Sally brings Jack's sleigh to help, and Jack and Santa chase after Oogie. Oogie falls out of the sleigh into a world of garbage after being frightened by one of Jack's jack-in-the-boxes that was dropped in the sleigh by an elf. There, he absorbs the waste and insects in the environment in a fit of rage and becomes a giant version of himself to beat Jack. Jack faces Oogie one-on-one. Oogie spills out his bugs, becoming nothing more than an empty husk, ending his threat for good. Afterward, Jack apologizes to Santa for almost ruining Christmas again, but having a change of heart about the skeleton, Santa thanks him for saving his life.\n\nAfterwards, Jack realizes that his home and loved ones are something more important than new discoveries. Like the film, the game ends with Jack and Sally embracing on top of Spiral Hill.\n\nGameplay in the game is similar to the \"Devil May Cry\" series, but easier for younger and less experienced players. Both titles were developed by Capcom. Jack can transform into Santa Jack and the Pumpkin King later in the game. Santa Jack can lay down three types of presents to thwart his enemies, while the Pumpkin King form can set them aflame or lay down a bomb. The game consists of 24 chapters (and two secret chapters). Players must fight numerous enemies, perform platforming tasks, and occasionally solve puzzles to progress through the story. The player's performance in each mission is given a letter grade of A, B, C or D, with an additional top grade of S. Grades are based on the time taken to complete the mission, the longest combo performed, the damage done to Jack, and the number of enemies surprised.\n\nThe doors of the various holiday worlds are obtained when a certain level is completed, though they are simply plot items and do not grant the player access to other holiday-themed towns. Later chapters, however, allow the player to enter Christmas Town. Each of Jack's costumes have different abilities. Santa Jack (which is obtained once Doctor Finklestein is defeated) can throw out presents to stun enemies or freeze enemies in ice, and the Pumpkin King (obtained after saving Sally from a large spider) can burn enemies and open doors by burning them. There are several unlockable costumes, though they do not grant any additional abilities.\n\nReception to the game was mostly mixed. GameRankings gave the game a score of 66.46% for Xbox and 64.95% for PlayStation 2, while Metacritic gave it a score of 65 out of 100 for both console versions. IGN reviewed the game, saying, \"Unpolished gameplay and poor pacing won't ever make for an outstanding product regardless of however endearing the source material may be\" and gave the game a 6/10 rating overall. Gametrailers.com criticized the game for its camera and story, which they believed copied too much from the movie instead of coming up with something truly original. However, \"The Times\" gave it all five stars and said, \"This adventure looks great, its landscape dominated by crooked buildings and brooding grey skies; navigating Jack is simple and the characters are all well realised. A perfect children’s game.\"\n\n"}

Though largely correct, he misjudged the relative atomic masses of tellurium and iodine.\n\nMoreover, Charles Darwin used his knowledge of evolution by natural selection to predict that since a plant (\"Angraecum sesquipedale\") with a long spur in its flowers exists, a complementary animal with a 30 cm proboscis must also exist to feed on and pollinate it. Twenty years after his death, a form of hawk moth (\"Xanthopan morganii\") that did just that was found.\n\nAnother example of predictive power is the prediction of Einstein's theory of general relativity that the path of light would bend in the presence of a strong gravitational field. This was experimentally verified by an expedition to Sobral in Brazil and the Atlantic island of Príncipe to measure star positions during the solar eclipse of May 29, 1919, when observations made by the astrophysicist Arthur Eddington seemed to confirm Einstein's predictions. Although the measurements have been criticized by some as utilizing flawed methodology, modern reanalysis of the data suggests that Eddington's analysis of the data was accurate. Later, more precise measurements taken by radio interferometry confirmed the predictions to a high degree of accuracy.\n\nThe predictive power of a theory is closely related to applications.\n\nGeneral relativity not only predicts the bending of light, but also predicts several other phenomena. Recently, the calculation of proper time of satellites has been a successfully-measured prediction, now incorporated into the method used to calculate positions via GPS.\n\nIf a theory has no predictive power, it cannot be used for applications.\n\n"}

It has a literary language based on the Southern dialect, one of the official languages of Dagestan.\n\nTabasaran is an ergative language. The verb system is relatively simple; verbs agree with the subject in number, person and (in North Tabasaran) class. North Tabasaran has two noun classes (also dubbed with the term \"grammatical gender\"), whereas Southern Tabasaran has none (i.e. one fewer than North Tabasaran, because no noun classes means that all nouns belong to the same class).\n\nIt is spoken in the basin of Upper Rubas-nir and Upper Chirakh-nir.\n\nThe post-alveolar sibilants may be whistled.\n\nVowel sounds of Tabasaran are [i, y, ɛ, æ, ɑ, u].\n\nTabasaran is written using Cyrillic.\n\nNote: The letters indicated in orange are encountered only in loanwords from Russian.\n\nTabasaran is very probably an active language of the fluid-S type.\n\nTabasaran was listed in the \"Guinness Book of World Records\" as having the largest case system in the world, with 48. Hjelmslev (1935) claimed that Tabasaran had the 'empirical maximum' number of cases, with 52 (though 2 occur only on adjectives). However, such claims are based on a sloppy analysis of 'case', and other languages such as Tsez would have even larger counts under such definitions. Comrie & Polinsky \n(1998) analyze the system as having 14 case morphemes (counting the absolutive with no suffix) in southern dialects (including the standard language) and 15 in northern dialects.\nThese include 4 core/argument cases (absolutive, ergative, genitive -n and dative -z). The absolutive is the citation form. The ergative, which may be irregular but typically ends in -i, functions as the stem for all other cases.\nThere are also 7 or 8 locative case suffixes: -ɂ 'in', -xy 'at', -h 'near / in front' (neutralized with 'at' in the south), -ɂin 'on' (horizontal), -k 'on' (vertical), -kk 'under', -q 'behind' and -ghy 'among'. The locative cases may take an additional suffix, allative -na or ablative -an, for 21 or 24 combinations. All of these, as well as the dative, can take a further suffix -di to mark the location as less specific, for 47 (southern) to 53 (northern) combinations of case suffixes.\n\n\"Uwu aldakurawu.\" \"Уву алдакураву.\" — \"You are falling.\"\n\n\"Uzuz uwu kkunduzuz.\" \"Узуз уву ккундузуз.\" — \"I love you.\"\n\n\"Uwu fudžuwa?\" \"Уву фужува?\" — \"Who are you?\"\n\n\"Fici wuna?\" \"Фици вуна?\" — \"How are you?\"\n\n\"Zakur ʕürza.\" \"Закур гъюрза.\" — \"I'll come tomorrow.\"\n\n\"Uzu kana qheza.\" \"Узу кана хъэза.\" — \"I'll be back.\"\n\n\n"}

Lower Makonikey has more year-round residents, and is considered one of the more desirable neighborhoods in Vineyard Haven, as the houses and lots tend to be larger than usual for that town, combined with waterviews and beach access (this is generally true of the neighborhoods in Vineyard Haven between Lamberts Cove Road and the Vineyard Sound, Northern Pines, Pilot Hill, and Lower Makonikey)\n\nLower Makonikey and Upper Makonikey are the subject of 2 separate associations, the Lower Makonikey Corporation and the Upper Makonikey Trust. The associations' main duties are road and beach maintenance. Beach access is private, like many other beaches in Massachusetts.\n"}
{"id": "1983939", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1983939", "title": "Matthew 4", "text": "Matthew 4\n\nMatthew 4 is the fourth chapter of the Gospel of Matthew in the New Testament of Christian Bible. Many translations of the gospel and biblical commentaries separate the first section of chapter 4 (verses -, Matthew's account of the Temptation of Jesus by the devil) from the remaining sections, which deal with Jesus' first public preaching and the gathering of his first disciples.\n\nThe original text was written in Koine Greek. This chapter is divided into 25 verses.\n\nSome early manuscripts containing the text of this chapter are:\n\nThe New King James Version organises this chapter as follows:\n\nThe New Revised Standard Version divides the chapter into three sections: , and .\n\nJohn Calvin's Commentary treats verses 1-4, 5-11, 13-16 and 18-25 as separate sections.\n\nThe section of this chapter dealing with the temptation of Christ by Satan is unquestionably the best known and most studied portion. Satan tempts him three times: in with food to relieve Jesus' fast, in with testing God, and in with control of all the kingdoms of the earth.\n\nThere are a number of theories regarding the temptations. One suggests that the three temptations show Jesus rejecting various visions of the Messiah. In the first temptation he shows that he will not be an economic messiah who will use his powers to feed the world's hungry. In the second that he will not be a miracle worker who puts on great spectacles, and the third that he will not be a political saviour but rather a spiritual one. Many scholars today reject this view. A popular theory today is that Jesus is demonstrating that he will not fail where the people of Israel did. There are several references to the period after the Exodus and this is the section of the scripture Jesus' draws his quotes from. In that section the Israelites anger God by testing him and they soon compromise their principles for political power, mistakes that Jesus does not make.\n\nIn the Gospel of Mark, chapter 1, the temptation narrative takes only two verses. Luke is quite similar to Matthew with only somewhat different wording and with the order of the second and third temptations reversed. It is thus widely believed that much of this section in Matthew came from the hypothetical document Q. Schweizer notes that Q likely contained little except the actual dialogue, as the extra information is quite different in the two gospels. David Hill argues that Mark is written in a manner which assumes his audience is already familiar with the temptation narrative, so this dialogue may have been widely known by the early Christians and thus not necessarily in Q.\n\nScholars generally consider Matthew's account to be more likely to be the original arrangement; however, Luke's version became more popular in the tradition. The temptation scene related here has inspired a number of works of literature. It is briefly recounted in \"Paradise Lost\" and is retold in great detail and expanded upon in \"Paradise Regained\". It also is an important inspiration for \"The Brothers Karamazov\" and \"Murder in the Cathedral\". The book \"The Last Temptation of Christ\" and its 1989 film adaptation also expand upon Christ being tempted by Satan.\n\nThe remaining verses of this chapter (verses 12 to 25) are generally seen as the introduction to the ministry of Jesus, which will take up the next several chapters of the Gospel and in the Sermon on the Mount, which begins immediately after this chapter. Jesus begins to preach a gospel of repentance: his words are the same as those of John the Baptist, now in prisoned in Machaerus Palace:\n\nVerses to describe the calling of the first four fishermen, who become his first disciples: two, Simon Peter and Andrew, were casting a net into the sea, and two, James, and John, working with Zebedee their father, were repairing their nets. The disciples abandon possessions and family to be what Jesus calls \"fishers of men\". The final three verses introduce the crowds whom Jesus addresses. These verses also serve as a summary of Jesus' ministry outlining the three forms it takes: teaching, preaching, and healing.\n\nIn the King James Version this chapter reads:\n\nThen was Jesus led up of the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil.<br>\nAnd when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was afterward an hungred.<br>\nAnd when the tempter came to him, he said, If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread.<br>\nBut he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.<br>\nThen the devil taketh him up into the holy city, and setteth him on a pinnacle of the temple,<br>\nAnd saith unto him, If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down: for it is written, He shall give his angels charge concerning thee: and in their hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone.<br>\nJesus said unto him, It is written again, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.<br>\nAgain, the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain, and sheweth him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them;<br>\nAnd saith unto him, All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me.<br>\nThen saith Jesus unto him, Get thee hence, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.<br>\nThen the devil leaveth him, and, behold, angels came and ministered unto him.<br>\nNow when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison, he departed into Galilee;<br>\nAnd leaving Nazareth, he came and dwelt in Capernaum, which is upon the sea coast, in the borders of Zabulon and Nephthalim:<br>\nThat it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying,<br>\nThe land of Zabulon, and the land of Nephthalim, by the way of the sea, beyond Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles;<br>\nThe people which sat in darkness saw great light; and to them which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up.<br>\nFrom that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.<br>\nAnd Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brethren, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers.<br>\nAnd he saith unto them, Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.<br>\nAnd they straightway left their nets, and followed him.<br>\nAnd going on from thence, he saw other two brethren, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in a ship with Zebedee their father, mending their nets; and he called them.<br>\nAnd they immediately left the ship and their father, and followed him.<br>\nAnd Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people.<br>\nAnd his fame went throughout all Syria: and they brought unto him all sick people that were taken with divers diseases and torments, and those which were possessed with devils, and those which were lunatick, and those that had the palsy; and he healed them.<br>\nAnd there followed him great multitudes of people from Galilee, and from Decapolis, and from Jerusalem, and from Judaea, and from beyond Jordan.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1983945", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1983945", "title": "Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney", "text": "Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney\n\nPhoenix Wright: Ace Attorney is a visual novel adventure video game developed by Capcom Production Studio 4 and published by Capcom. It was released in 2001 for the Game Boy Advance in Japan and has been ported to multiple platforms. The 2005 Nintendo DS version, titled \"Gyakuten Saiban Yomigaeru Gyakuten\" in Japan, introduced an English language option, and was the first time the game was released in North America and Europe. It is the first entry in the \"Ace Attorney\" series; several sequels and spin-offs were produced, while this game has seen further ports and remasters for computers, game consoles, and mobile devices.\n\nThe story follows Phoenix Wright, a rookie defense attorney who attempts to have his clients declared \"not guilty\". Among other characters are Phoenix's boss, Mia Fey; his assistant and Mia's sister, Maya; and prosecutor Miles Edgeworth. The player controls Phoenix through two sets of sections: investigations and courtroom trials. During investigations they gather information and evidence. During trials they cross-examine witnesses, and answer questions from the judge, the prosecutor, and the witnesses. The story is split into five cases. The fifth was introduced in the Nintendo DS version to take advantage of gameplay elements using the handheld's touchscreen not available in the original Game Boy Advance version.\n\nA team of seven developed the game over the course of ten months. Written and directed by Shu Takumi, it was originally planned as a Game Boy Color game about a private investigator. The game was designed to be simple; Takumi wanted it easy enough that even his mother could play. While the original version of the game takes place in Japan, the localization is set in the United States; this became an issue when localizing later games, where the Japanese setting was more obvious.\n\nFor the most part the game has been positively received by critics who praised its premise, writing, characters and presentation. The game has been a commercial success both in Japan and internationally. The North American release sold better than expected and was hard to find in stores shortly after its release. Other media based on the game have been produced. It has been credited with helping to popularise visual novels in the Western world. A manga series premiered in 2006, a film adaptation of the game, titled \"Ace Attorney\", premiered in 2012, and an anime series adaptation began airing in 2016.\n\n\"Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney\" is a visual novel adventure game where the player takes the role of Phoenix Wright, a rookie defense attorney, and attempts to defend their clients in five cases. These cases are played in a specific order. After finishing them, the player can re-play them in any order. Each case begins with an opening cinematic cutscene showing a murder; shortly thereafter, the player is given the job of defending the prime suspect in the case. The gameplay is divided into two sections, investigations and courtroom trials.\n\nDuring investigations, which usually take place before or between trial sessions, the player gathers information and evidence by talking to characters such as their client, witnesses, and the police. The player can move a cursor to examine various things in the environment. By using a menu the player can move to different locations, examine evidence, and present evidence to other characters. By showing certain pieces of evidence to some witnesses, the player can access new information.\n\nIn the game's fifth case, created for the DS version and used in all subsequent releases, the player is able to examine evidence more closely, rotating it to view it from all sides, and zooming in or out on it using touchscreen controls; they are also able to move a cursor to investigate specific parts of the evidence. The fifth case also features forensics tests the player can use at crime scenes to find clues. The player can spray luminol by tapping areas they want to examine on the touch screen allowing them to see otherwise invisible blood stains. They can touch the touch screen to apply aluminum flake powder to search for finger prints. After applying it, they can blow into the microphone to reveal the prints. Once the player has gathered enough evidence, the investigation section ends.\n\nDuring the courtroom trials, the player aims to prove their clients' innocence; to do so, they cross-examine witnesses. During these cross-examinations, the player aims to uncover lies and inconsistencies in the witnesses' testimony. They are able to go back and forth between the different statements in the testimony and can press the witness for more details about a statement. When the player finds an inconsistency, they can present a piece of evidence that contradicts the statement. In the Nintendo DS version, the player can choose to press and present by using vocal commands. In the Wii version, players have the option to present evidence by swinging the Wii Remote. At certain points, the player has to answer questions from the judge, the witnesses, or the prosecutor through a multiple-choice answer selection, or by presenting evidence that supports Wright's claims. A number of exclamation marks are shown on the screen; if the player presents an incorrect piece of evidence, one of them disappears. If they all disappear, the client is found guilty and the player must restart. When the player solves a case, they unlock a new one to play.\n\nPhoenix Wright, a newly hired defense attorney at the Fey & Co. law firm, agrees to represent his childhood friend Larry Butz, who has been charged with the murder of his girlfriend, Cindy Stone. With the help of his boss and mentor, Mia Fey, Phoenix proves that Frank Sahwit, the prosecution's star witness, is the real murderer.\n\nShortly thereafter, Mia is killed in her office. Her younger sister Maya is arrested after the police find her name on a note left by Mia. Phoenix takes her case, facing off against Miles Edgeworth, a skilled prosecutor. Phoenix manages to identify Redd White, a professional blackmailer, as the real killer, only to find himself charged with the killing instead. Representing himself, he exposes White in court and gets justice for Mia. In gratitude, Maya becomes Phoenix's assistant.\n\nHis reputation established, Phoenix takes on another case, this time defending Will Powers, the lead actor in a children's TV show, against accusations that he killed his co-star, Jack Hammer. It is revealed that Dee Vasquez, the show's producer, committed the murder in self-defense after Hammer tried to kill her and frame Powers for her death.\n\nOn Christmas Eve, Edgeworth is arrested for the murder of attorney Robert Hammond. After relenting for Phoenix's help after an initial refusal, Wright faces Edgeworth's mentor Manfred von Karma, who has appointed himself as special prosecutor. Phoenix discovers that Yanni Yogi shot Hammond while Karma provided Yogi with the gun. Years earlier, Edgeworth's father Gregory ruined Von Karma's spotless record when he convinced a judge to penalize Karma for misconduct. Unable to deal with such a blemish on his legacy, Karma murdered Gregory in cold blood, leaving Miles to believe he himself was responsible, while Yogi was publicly blamed and convinced by Hammond, his attorney, to fake insanity. After Karma suffers a breakdown in court and confesses to the cover-up, Edgeworth is set free. Following the trial, Phoenix explains that Edgeworth motivated him to become an attorney after he was accused of stealing money from Edgeworth. In the past, Edgeworth persuaded his teacher not to punish Phoenix. However, Edgeworth decided to become Karma's pupil following his father's murder after being motivated by his hatred of criminals. After the case, it was revealed that Larry was the true culprit of the theft. Nevertheless, Edgeworth decides to rethink whether or not he should resume his previous duties. Meanwhile, Maya announces that she will be returning to her home village to finish her spirit medium training.\n\nIn a fifth and final case added for the Nintendo DS and subsequent releases, Phoenix is hired by teenager Ema Skye to defend her sister Lana, the head of the prosecutor's office. Skye is accused of murdering detective Bruce Goodman, who was found in the trunk of Edgeworth's car. Together with Ema, Phoenix traces the origins of the murder to an incident two years prior, when a serial killer allegedly murdered Edgeworth's predecessor while trying to escape custody. Damon Gant, a senior police captain, accidentally admits that he framed Ema for the murder in order to manipulate Lana to do his bidding. Though Lana is cleared of murder charges, she agrees to resign her post to face judgement for protecting Gant. With Ema being sent to Europe to continue training as a forensic investigator, Phoenix looks forward to continuing his career defending the innocent.\n\nIt took a team of seven people ten months to develop \"Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney\". It was directed by Shu Takumi and produced by Atsushi Inaba, with music by Masakazu Sugimori. Kumiko Suekane designed the characters, with art by Tatsuro Iwamoto. In 2000, after Takumi had finished his work on \"Dino Crisis 2\", his boss, Shinji Mikami, gave him six months to create any type of game he wanted. Takumi had originally joined Capcom wanting to make mystery and adventure games and felt this was a big chance to make his mark as a creator. Takumi said that he initially received criticism for \"Ace Attorney\"'s concept for its relation to law and a perceived requirement of legal knowledge, but he said that the main point of \"Ace Attorney\" was the \"fun from solving puzzles and...calling witnesses out in their lies and evidence.\"\n\nAt first, the game was planned to be released for the Game Boy Color, but after the development team saw the Game Boy Advance system's screen and footage of \"Mega Man Battle Network\", Takumi felt it would be perfect for \"Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney\". The game was designed to be simple, as Takumi wanted it to be easy enough for even his mother to play. As it was less common at the time to use professional voice actors, the development team provided the game's voice clips; each staff member recorded every sample needed for the game, and then the best ones were used. Takumi used his privilege as the director to cast himself as Phoenix, however, while Sugimori voiced von Karma and Iwamoto voiced Edgeworth.\n\nThe game was originally going to be a detective game, with Phoenix as a private investigator who finds a body at his client's office and is arrested. As the lawyer who is assigned to his case is useless, Phoenix takes up his own defense. One staff member suggested that Phoenix should be a hamster; while this didn't happen, this early version of Phoenix did have a pet hamster. It was decided early during development to refer to the game as \"Surviban: Attorney Detective Naruhodo-kun\", with \"surviban\" being a portmanteau of \"survival\" and the Japanese word . Among other names considered were \"Boogie-Woogie Innocence\" and \"Bingo Bengo\", with \"bingo\" referring to answering correctly and being Japanese for legal representation. Takumi soon realized that finding and taking apart contradictions was not related to detective work. He felt the main setting of the game should be courtrooms. At one point the game was in danger of being cancelled when two staff members left the company, but Takumi's division leader and Inaba enlisted a member of the \"Resident Evil\" development team to help them part-time.\n\nTakumi cited Japanese mystery author Edogawa Ranpo as an inspiration, particularly \"The Psychological Test\", a short story which involves a crime that \"unravels due to the criminal's contradictory testimony.\" It had a big impact on him, and was a major influence on the game. He was also inspired by stories from another Japanese author, Shinichi Hoshi, stating that he was pursuing his \"element of surprise and unexpectedness.\"\n\nTakumi felt the best way to write a mystery with a good climax is to reveal various clues, then pull them together into one conclusion, and not have multiple possible endings. He said the biggest challenge with this is making the gameplay and story work together. The goal is to make the player feel they have driven the story forward themselves, with their own choices, even though the game is linear. While writing the episodes, Takumi ranked the importance of each. The first episode was the most important, to make sure the player likes the game; the second episode was the second most important, to solidify the player's interest, and the finale was the third most important. In general, each scenario was finished before anything else was done. Then characters were designed based on the scenarios, and Takumi adjusted the dialogue as needed to make sure it fit the designs. At this point, the scenes that were to have specific cut-in illustrations made for them were decided. Takumi drew rough sketches of them and also drew the storyboards for the episodes' openings, which consisted of a series of detailed drawings showing what is happening.\n\nIn Takumi's first draft of the story, the second episode, \"Turnabout Sisters\", was the first episode of the game. The development team decided because of its length, among other factors, it did not work well easing players into the game. As a result, he wrote a shorter episode, \"The First Turnabout\", which was used as the game's first episode. He wanted players to focus on the thrill of \"nailing the culprit\", especially for the first episode. For this reason, the culprit in the first episode is shown in its opening. This was the most direct way Takumi could think of doing it. Takumi said it was a challenge to write the episode. In addition to keeping it short, he had to set up the world of \"Ace Attorney\" and the types of characters players would meet. The third episode was written for the sake of the character Miles Edgeworth, and the theme of the fourth episode was \"rekindling the relationship\". In it, Takumi tried to portray an intensively strong friendship between Phoenix and Edgeworth. He did wonder if that was what people got from it, saying that some people interpreted the bond between Phoenix and Edgeworth as \"intensively passionate\". Because of these two episodes, Takumi considered Edgeworth to be the game's protagonist in a way. The classroom trial in the game's fourth episode is based on real events: when Takumi was in second grade, he had found a 5 yen coin and put it in his pocket; his teacher accused him of stealing it from another student and made him apologize to her.\n\nTakumi spent little time writing a backstory for Phoenix before writing the game's story, and instead made up dialogue and developed Phoenix's personality as he went along. He said Phoenix is himself in everything but name, with dialogue similar to what Takumi would have said in each situation in the games. He attributed this to being a first-time writer who did not think about developing characterization before writing the story. Takumi did not write a backstory for Dick Gumshoe. His character and personality just \"fell into place\" after Takumi decided the character would end his sentences with \"pal\". Other aspects of the character came about organically as he wrote the story. For instance, at one point Edgeworth says he will cut Gumshoe's salary; this became part of Gumshoe's backstory. Takumi came up with the partner character Maya thinking it would be more fun for players to have another character with them, providing advice, rather than investigating on their own. Originally, she was going to be a lawyer-in-training, preparing to take the bar exam.\n\nLarry Butz, the game's first defendant, was particularly difficult for Takumi to write. He re-wrote the character several times. Originally, he was going to be an \"average Joe\" type of character, who only appeared in the game's fourth episode. After his inclusion in the first episode, however, Suekane and Iwamoto told Takumi to give the character \"some oomph\". Takumi then wrote him as a \"prickly tough-guy\" who had the habit of telling people he was going to kill them. Some of the higher-ups at Capcom did not like this, so Takumi changed him to a character who laments his lot in life, saying \"I'm going to die!\" or that the situation is killing him. The third episode's culprit was originally going to be male, until Suekane pointed out that all the game's villains were men. The development team debated what to do with the now female character. Some staff members thought it would be odd to have a female character be the director of an action show, and some wondered what to do with the director role if she could not fill it. In the end, Takumi changed the scriptwriter character to a director, and made the culprit a \"strong, glamorous, fashionable, and cool-headed\" producer.\n\nThe game's fifth episode, \"Rise from the Ashes\", was not included in the original version of the game; it was created four years later as part of the Nintendo DS version of the game. Minae Matsukawa produced the fifth episode, under supervision of Inaba and Mikami. Naoto Tanaka composed new music pieces for \"Rise from the Ashes\". The idea to include the use of the Nintendo DS system's microphone came from American Capcom staff members. The Japanese staff did not like the idea of adding unnecessary features, but Takumi thought it was important to make the American audience happy, so it was included as an optional feature. \"Rise from the Ashes\" utilizes technical improvements from the Nintendo DS that weren't possible in the original game.\n\nThe original version of the game was released for the Game Boy Advance in Japan on October 12, 2001. The Nintendo DS port, which was titled , was released in Japan on September 15, 2005, and included a new episode and an English language option. The hope was the English language option would be a selling point in Japan, and that Japanese people studying English would play the game. North American and European releases followed on October 11, 2005, and March 31, 2006, respectively. A PC port of the Game Boy Advance version, developed by Daletto, was released in Japan in an episodic format, beginning on March 18, 2008. \"Yomigaeru Gyakuten\" was later released on Wii via WiiWare in Japan on December 15, 2009, in North America on January 11, 2010, and in Europe on January 15, 2010. The fifth episode was released separately on WiiWare, on March 16, 2010, in Japan, in May 2010 in Europe, and on May 24, 2010, in North America. An iOS version of \"Yomigaeru Gyakuten\" was released in Japan on December 21, 2009, and in the West on May 24, 2010.\n\nA high-definition version of the first three \"Ace Attorney\" games, \"Ace Attorney: Phoenix Wright Trilogy HD\", was released for iOS and Android in Japan on February 7, 2012, and for iOS in the West on May 30, 2013. Another collection of the first three games, \"Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trilogy\", was released for the Nintendo 3DS in Japan on April 17, 2014, in North America on December 9, 2014, and in Europe on December 11, 2014. It was also released for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One on February 21, 2019 in Japan, and on April 9, 2019 internationally; a Microsoft Windows version was released internationally on the same date.\n\nThe localization of the game was outsourced to Bowne Global, and handled by writer Alexander O. Smith, who was unfamiliar with the \"Ace Attorney\" series before working on it, and editor Steve Anderson. While the Japanese version of the game takes place in Japan, the localized version is set in the United States. Normally the setting would be left vague while cultural differences the target audience would not understand would be adapted. Because one of the episodes involves time zones, however, they had to specify where the game takes place and chose the United States without thinking a lot about it. This became an issue in later games, where the Japanese setting was more obvious. Bowne Global staff handled all the voice roles in the localized version; Takumi had wanted to do the English voice for Phoenix, but Ben Judd handled it.\n\nSmith faced several problems related to the game's use of puns. In the Japanese version, each character has a name that relies on Japanese wordplay. While Smith and Anderson had a lot of freedom when it came to localizing the names of minor characters, they had to discuss the names of the main cast with Capcom. Smith came up with a list of first and last names for Phoenix. The first suggestion was \"Roger Wright\"; \"Phoenix\" was also on the list, but further down. Smith felt that \"Wright\" had to be the character's surname, because Phoenix's surname in the Japanese version—\"\"Naruhodō\"\", meaning \"I see\" or \"I understand\"—was used many times in the game's text as a joke. The reason for the suggested first name \"Roger\" was alliteration; and \"Roger\" was a good source for jokes. A staff member of the development team, however, thought that \"Roger Wright\" was too similar to \"Roger Rabbit\". Other suggested first names included \"Pierce\", \"Xavier\", \"Marcus\", and \"Zane\". In the end, \"Phoenix\" was chosen for its heroic sound.\n\nAs the game's dialogue consists of a lot of wordplay and misunderstandings, Smith would analyze scenes before writing them: he would determine what the scenes were trying to accomplish, and where their beats were. After he had the structure of a scene in his head, he would write it. At times he was able to make use of the original Japanese dialogue, but most of the time he had to come up with new ideas himself. At several points, the English wordplay was inspired by the wordplay in the Japanese version. At others it was not possible to have wordplay in the same places as in the Japanese version, so Smith would change the structure of the scene slightly. Sometimes Smith came up with a joke or funny line and changed the scene to make the joke work. About half the jokes were rewritten based on the characters present in the scene, rather than using translations of the Japanese jokes.\n\nMost versions of the game have received \"generally favorable reviews\" according to the review aggregator Metacritic, with aggregate scores ranging from the high 70s to the low 80s out of 100; an exception is the Wii version, which holds an aggregate score of 67/100, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".\n\n\"Famitsu\" praised the idea of making a game based around trials. They felt this was innovative, and found it exhilarating and fun to uncover witnesses' lies. Michael Cole of \"Nintendo World Report\" said the game's design and interface would make it a good choice for non-gamers as well. Craig Harris of IGN felt the main issues with the game were its linearity, and how the puzzles are simple because the player can stop witness testimony at any time. Cole, too, felt the game was very linear, and that it was unclear how to proceed at certain points. He said that because of how story-driven it is, the game has low replay value; he still felt that players might want to replay it after a few years.\n\nThomas Bowskill of \"Nintendo Life\" said the game had changed his idea of what can make for a great game, and called it a \"masterpiece\". Bowskill appreciated the 2D presentation of the investigations, saying they suited the gameplay well and that it might have been difficult to find clues if 3D graphics had been used instead. Bowskill called the investigation sections \"tedious\" and \"boring\" at times, but said they were outweighed by the \"feeling of accomplishment\" from solving the cases.\n\nCarrie Gouskos of \"GameSpot\" said the game revitalized the adventure game genre. Gouskos appreciated the game's presentation, calling it \"unique and outstanding\". She noted the music and sound effects work well with the drama. The cross-examination graphics, showing the two opposing lawyers along with the sound effect of a sword being unsheathed, she added, created an atmosphere similar to that of a fighting game. Harris also likened the style to that of a fighting game. Gouskos said the graphics, while simple, work well to show each character's mood and personality. Harris agreed the visuals were well-drawn and called the soundtrack \"nicely rendered\", but felt the character animation was very limited. Cole felt the graphics, while dated, have \"visual flair\". He appreciated the opening cinematics for the cases, which he thought were both stylish and ambiguous, and the character animations, which he called \"priceless\". Nadia Oxford at \"USgamer\" said that early \"Ace Attorney\" games, despite the \"tinny\" sound of the Game Boy Advance versions, had spawned some of the most iconic music themes in video games; she noted \"The Detective That Came From the Wild West\", Jake Marshall's theme, as a particularly good track.\n\nBowskill found the mood of the game to be hilarious, saying the game never gets stale; he attributed this to the diversity of its characters. Gouskos called the game's characters cohesive, over-the-top, and quirky. Harris called the story interesting and well written, citing the characters, situations, and dialogue. Cole was impressed by the mysteries and their resolutions, calling them \"novel, unpredictable and plausible\". He also appreciated the character development arcs through the game, which he felt provided pacing and made the cases cohesive. He called the English localization \"top-notch\", and appreciated its humor. According to Fintan Monaghan of \"The Escapist\", the game is a critique of the Japanese legal system, which has a 99% criminal conviction rate.\n\nSpencer McIlvaine of \"Nintendo Life\" was disappointed in the Wii version that had only a single use for the Motion controller, and how the low-resolution graphics in handheld versions of the game were used. Dan Whitehead of \"Eurogamer\" also thought the motion controls were a minor addition. He was disappointed in how little effort Capcom had put into the port compared to LucasArts' remake of \"The Secret of Monkey Island\". IGN's Craig Harris called it \"incredibly lazy\", wishing it had included improved art and sharper text. Cara Ellison of \"Eurogamer\" called the \"Trilogy HD\" port \"perfunctory\", saying the animations are slow at times, the high-definition graphics take away from the charm of the pixel art in earlier versions, and there is a delay after button presses.\n\n\"Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trilogy\" was better received. \"US Gamer\"s Bob Mackey appreciated how the games were mostly left untouched, while given minor improvements, such as the player being able to read the text at their own pace and not waiting for it to crawl across the screen. He said the game's graphical upgrades were hit or miss, with certain characters, including Phoenix and Edgeworth, looking great. Elements that originally had less definition, such as the judge's beard, however, were \"a little wonky\". Thomas Whitehead of \"Nintendo Life\" said that Capcom had done a \"solid job\" with the port. He appreciated the stereoscopic 3D effect and the game's faithfulness to the original; he felt, however, that the lack of an orchestral soundtrack similar to that in \"\" was a minor disappointment. \"Hardcore Gamer\" Geoff Thew called the updated art gorgeous, noting it did not have the same animation-related problems as the \"Trilogy HD\" on iOS. He appreciated the 3D effect, which he said worked well most of the time. However, the window frame in the detention center was not rendered on its own layer. While this was not a huge problem, Thew said it was distracting as the player often visits that area. He also commented on the lack of a remastered soundtrack, calling it a letdown.\n\n\"Eurogamer\" ranked the game as the 18th best video game of 2005. It was also a nominee for \"GameSpot\"s 2005 Best Adventure Game award, which went to \"Fahrenheit\". \"Destructoid\" named the game the 48th best video game of the 2000s, citing the courtroom gameplay and characters, and calling it \"one of the most unique and surprising games\" of the decade. They said the third game in the series had the best story, but it relied too heavily on story events in previous \"Ace Attorney\" games; meanwhile, they found \"Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney\" to be fresh and have challenging cases, making it the best in the series. \"Game Informer\" named it the 178th best video game of all time in 2009. Adventure Gamers named it the 29th best adventure game of all time in 2011, citing its story, characters, and creative gameplay. In 2015, \"GamesRadar+\" named it the 55th best video game of all time, citing its music, story and look, calling it \"Shu Takumi's masterpiece\". In 2016, \"Famitsu\" readers voted \"Gyakuten Saiban\" as the second best Game Boy Advance title, behind only \"Pokémon Ruby\" and \"Sapphire\". In 2017, \"Famitsu\" readers voted \"Gyakuten Saiban\" the third best adventure game of all time, behind only \"Steins;Gate\" and \"\".\n\nThe Game Boy Advance version was the 163rd best selling video game of the year in Japan in 2001, with 62,169 copies sold. Another 37,143 copies of the budget-priced Game Boy Advance re-release were sold in Japan in 2003, making it the country's 277th best selling game of the year. The Nintendo DS version was the 127th best selling game of the year in Japan in 2005, with 101,902 copies sold. Between 2006 and 2011 the game sold an additional 419,954 copies dropping from the 133rd to the 650th best selling game during that period. \n\nDemand for the North American release of the Nintendo DS version was higher than expected. The game was hard to find in stores shortly after its release; the third printing sold out in around a week. As of February 2007, 100,000 copies had been shipped in North America, which Capcom's vice-president of marketing found surprising. \"Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trilogy\" was the 139th best selling game of the year in Japan in 2014, with 46,819 copies sold. The PC version of the collection was among the best-selling new releases of the month on Steam.\n\nAfter the release of the game, sequels, spin-offs, and a crossover have been made. The second and third games in the series, \"\" and \"\", were released in 2002 and 2004. The fourth game, \"\", which features the new protagonist Apollo Justice, was released in 2007. The fifth game, \"\", was released in 2013, and a sixth game, \"\", was released in 2016. Two spin-off games starring Miles Edgeworth, \"\" and \"Ace Attorney Investigations 2\", were released in 2009 and 2011, and two featuring Phoenix's ancestor Ryūnosuke Naruhodō, \"\" and \"Dai Gyakuten Saiban 2\", were released in 2015 and 2017. A crossover with the \"Professor Layton\" series, titled \"\", was released in 2012.\n\nA manga based on the game, written by Kenji Kuroda and drawn by Kazuo Maekawa, premiered in 2006 in \"Bessatsu Young Magazine\". Kodansha released it in North America in five volumes from June 2011 to July 2012. The third and fourth volumes both ranked No.2 on \"The New York Times\" Manga Best Seller List for one week each in 2011 and 2012, respectively. A live action film adaptation of the game, titled \"Ace Attorney\", produced at Toei Company, and directed by Takashi Miike, premiered in Japanese theaters on February 11, 2012. An anime series adaptation based on the original trilogy premiered in April 2016.\n\n\"Phoenix Wright\" has been credited with helping to popularise visual novels in the Western world. \"Vice Magazine\" credits \"Phoenix Wright\" with popularising the visual novel mystery format, and notes that its success anticipated the resurgence of point-and-click adventure games as well as the international success of Japanese visual novels. According to \"Danganronpa\" director Kazutaka Kodaka, \"Phoenix Wright\"s success in North America was due to how it distinguished itself from most visual novels with its gameplay mechanics, which \"Danganronpa\" later built upon and helped it also find success in North America.\n\n"}

{"id": "1983963", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1983963", "title": "Taj Mahal Palace Hotel", "text": "Taj Mahal Palace Hotel\n\nThe Taj Mahal Palace Hotel, is a heritage, five-star, luxury hotel built in the Saracenic Revival style in the Colaba region of Mumbai, Maharashtra, India, situated next to the Gateway of India.\nHistorically it was known as the \"Taj Mahal Hotel\" or simply \"the Taj\". The hotel is considered one of the finest hotels in the East since the time of the British Raj. \n\nIt was one of the main sites targeted in the 2008 Mumbai attacks.\n\nPart of the Taj Hotels Resorts and Palaces, this hotel with its 560 rooms and 44 suites is considered the flagship property of the group; it employs some 1,600 staff. The hotel is made up of two different buildings: the Taj Mahal Palace and the Tower, which are historically and architecturally distinct from each other (the Taj Mahal Palace was built at the start of the twentieth century; the Tower was opened in 1973). The hotel has a long and distinguished history, having received many notable guests, from presidents to captains of industry and stars of show business. Ratanbai Petit, the second wife of the founder of Pakistan, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, lived in the hotel during her last days in 1929; her mother, Sylla Tata, had born into the Tata family, builders and owners of the hotel. During World War I, the hotel was converted into a military hospital with 600 beds. The hotel is notorious as the most visible target of the 2008 Mumbai attacks.\n\nIn 2017, the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel acquired an image trademark, the first building in the country to secure intellectual-property-right protection for its architectural design.\n\nThe original building of the hotel was commissioned by Tata. Its doors opened to guests on 16 December 1903.\n\nIt is widely believed that Jamsetji Tata decided to build the hotel after he was refused entry to one of the city's grand hotels of the time, Watson's Hotel, as it was restricted to \"whites only\". However, this story has been challenged by many commentators who suggest that Tata was most unlikely to have been concerned with 'revenge' against his British adversaries. Instead, the Taj was built at the urging of editor of \"The Times of India\" who felt a hotel \"worthy of Bombay\" was needed and as a \"gift to the city he loved\" by Tata.\n\nThe original Indian architects were Sitaram Khanderao Vaidya and D. N. Mirza, and the project was completed by an English engineer, W. A. Chambers. The builder was Khansaheb Sorabji Ruttonji Contractor who also designed and built its famous central floating staircase. The cost of construction was £250,000 (£127 million in 2008 prices).\n\nOriginally the main entrance was on the other side, where now the pool exists, and the ocean was at the back, although it is now always viewed and photographed from the ocean side.\n\nBetween 1915 and 1919, work proceeded at Apollo Bundar to reclaim the land behind the hotel where the Gateway of India was built in 1924. the Gateway of India soon became a major focal point in Bombay.\n\nThe original clientele were mainly the Europeans, the Maharajas and the social elites. Many world-renowned personalities from all fields have since stayed there, from Somerset Maugham and Duke Ellington to Lord Mountbatten and Bill Clinton.\n\nWhen it opened in 1903, the hotel was the first in India to have: electricity, American fans, German elevators, Turkish baths and English butlers. Later it also had the city's first licensed bar, India's first all-day restaurant, and India's first discotheque, Blow Up. Initially in 1903, it charged Rs 13 for rooms with fans and attached bathrooms, and Rs 20 with full board.\n\nDuring World War I the hotel was converted into a military hospital with 600 beds.\n\nMuhammad Ali Jinnah's second wife Ratanbai Petit lived here during her last days in 1929. By 1966 the building had become neglected and run-down, perhaps as a result of losing the British customers after 1948.\n\nThe Taj Hotel was home to legendary Jazz musician Micky Correa, \"The Sultan of Swing\" from 1936–1960.\n\nThe Taj Mahal Tower, an additional wing of the hotel, was opened in 1973. It was designed jointly by Daraius Batliwala & Rustom Patell with the latter having a greater focus later on. Also in 1970s Taj Hotels Resorts and Palaces was organized that built new properties and converted palaces into heritage hotels. In 1980, it expanded overseas.\n\nThe hotel received extensive international exposure in 2008 during a terrorist attack and reopened after extensive repairs.\n\nTaj Mahal Palace Hotel was specifically chosen by Lashkar-e-Taiba, a terror group who attacked multiple targets, for an attack so that it will be \"striking a blow against a symbol of Indian wealth and progress\". The hotel was attacked on 26 November 2008, during which material damage occurred, including the destruction of the hotel's roof in the hours following. Hostages were taken during the attacks, and at least 167 people were killed, including many foreigners. The casualties were mostly Indian citizens, although westerners carrying foreign passports were singled out. Indian commandos killed the terrorists barricaded in the hotel, to end the three-day battle on 29 November. At least 31 died at the Taj. Approximately 450 people were staying in the Taj Mahal Palace and Hotel at the time of the seizure. The attack was planned using information compiled by David Headley, a Pakistani-American, who had stayed at the hotel multiple times.\n\nSoon after (30 November), Tata chairman Ratan Tata said in an interview with CNN's Fareed Zakaria that they had received advance warning of the attacks and that some countermeasures had been taken. These may have been relaxed before the attack, but in any case were easily sidestepped by the operatives.\n\nThe less-damaged sections of the Taj Mahal Palace and Tower hotel reopened on 21 December 2008. It took several months to rebuild the popular heritage section of the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel.\n\nHillary Clinton visited Mumbai in July 2009, aiming to deepen India – United States relations and stayed at the Taj hotel; she also attended a commemoration event. \"I wanted to send a message that I personally and our country is in sympathy and solidarity with the employees and the guests of the Taj who lost their lives … with the people of Mumbai.\" On 15 August 2010, India's Independence Day, the Taj Mahal Palace was reopened after restoration. The cost of the restoration of the hotel so far has been 1.75 billion rupees. The palace wing has been restored and offers new hotel services.\n\nOn 6 November 2010, U.S. President Barack Obama became the first foreign head of state to stay at the Taj Mahal Palace after the attacks. In a speech from the terrace of the hotel, Obama said that \"the Taj has been the symbol of the strength and the resilience of the Indian people.\"\nThe attack on the hotel is portrayed in the 2018 movie Hotel Mumbai.\n\n\n"}

Nationwide budget changes have resulted in the adoption of cryonic suspension over standard incarceration for convicted criminals. Following the assassination of a mayor in San Antonio, his replacement demands a solution, which is found in the form of the \"Knight 4000\", a car that will become the next generation of the Knight Industries' supercar KITT.\n\nThomas J. Watts is released from prison and assassinates the mayor. Police officer Shawn McCormick confronts the masked Watts holding the next mayor at gunpoint. She shoots Watts, who flees. The city's new mayor demands the gunman be found, while his councilmen reprimand him for disarming the police and setting up the cryo-prison where the inmates \"sleep away\" their sentences and emerge the same people as before.\n\nThe Knight Foundation, created from a combination of Knight Industries and the Foundation for Law and Government, offers a possible solution – the \"Knight 4000\". Devon Miles and his partner, Russel Maddock, are green-lit on the idea, but the city wants to see a working prototype. Devon brings in Michael Knight as the test driver. The Knight 4000 has most of KITT's original features, but adds an amphibious mode that allows the car to drive on water, a heads-up display, and a stun device that can remotely incapacitate a human.\n\nWatts shoots Shawn after she discovers that some of her colleagues are working with the assassin to rearm criminals so the city will give the police their guns back. Doctors save Shawn by installing a microchip implant into her brain. She recovers, but cannot remember the details of the attack.\n\nMichael is furious that KITT has been dismantled and rebuilds KITT's AI unit, which is difficult since Maddock has sold most of KITT's technology to medical research. He reactivates KITT's logic module and installs him in the dashboard of his 1957 Chevrolet Bel Air.\n\nShawn quits the police force after she learns her chief, Daniels, did not want to authorize her brain chip implant nor get involved in her case. She seeks employment with the Foundation, and Michael learns one of KITT's cybernetic chips is in her head. KITT links up with the chip and extracts her missing memories. Shawn remembers that Watts shot her and that her fellow officers were with him, including her partner.\n\nWatts learns Shawn is alive and sends the corrupt cops to eliminate her and Michael, who are chased down when they try fleeing in KITT. KITT helps them evade capture by driving off a pier where he quickly sinks. Michael and Shawn are safe, but KITT is damaged when water enters his circuitry. With Watts believing Michael and Shawn dead, he captures Devon and uses mind scanning technology to discover what Devon knows, killing him afterward.\n\nMichael and Shawn swim to safety and return to the Foundation, learning of Devon's death. After Devon's funeral, the mayor terminates FLAG's contract. Michael quits, but after Shawn confronts him, he returns and retrofits the Knight 4000 with KITT's AI.\n\nMichael and Shawn follow her former partner to a warehouse where guns are stored. Shawn arranges a gun transaction with her former partner. Before he can cooperate with FLAG's investigation, Watts shoots him. Michael saves Shawn from being killed.\n\nMaddock sends KITT a copy of the prison release papers for Watts, signed by the murdered mayor. Michael has KITT print more copies, sending one with a fake signature to Daniels using her name, and a similar one to the mayor, this time with his name. Following the mayor's limo, they record a conversation between the mayor and Watts discussing the papers.\n\nAfter ambushing a caravan of corrupt cops, they find no guns. KITT informs Michael there is another group of police cars headed for the local mall. Maddock convinces Daniels to allow KITT to pursue them.\n\nWatts has begun a transaction with a gun buyer. When one of the corrupt cops guarding Watts sights Shawn moving in, he shoots her, and the buyer and Watts flee. Michael catches up to Watts and disarms him. A fight ensues between Michael and Watts, Michael only stopping when Watts picks up his handgun. Shawn, only slightly wounded, arrives with the other handgun, instructing Watts to drop his. Michael talks Shawn down from shooting Watts. Watts then draws another gun hidden under his coat but Michael draws out an ultrasound gun and shoots Watts, who falls to his death.\n\nAfter Watts' defeat, the mayor is incarcerated, Michael returns to retirement, and KITT remains at the Knight Foundation with Shawn and Maddock. The trio continue their police work.\n\nActor James Doohan makes a cameo appearance as an innocent bystander that KITT mistakes for a criminal stealing money from an ATM. KITT stuns the suspect and the man collapses. When Michael and Maddock pick up the man to arrest him, they find Mr. Doohan, delirious (from being stunned), and mumbling various lines from his role of Scotty on \"\".\n\nThe theme song, \"Knight Rider 2000\", by Jan Hammer was released on his 1994 album \"Drive\".\n\nThe studio was unable to use the real Pontiac Banshee IV concept car for the movie, so instead it hired Jay Ohrberg Star Cars Inc. to customize a 1991 Dodge Stealth for the Knight 4000. The custom car can also be seen, albeit briefly, as a stolen supercar in \"CHiPs '99\", and as a future police vehicle in \"Power Rangers Time Force\", and in an episode of the television series \"Black Scorpion\" in 2001.\n\nAs well as being available as a single DVD, it is included in the Region 1, Region 2 and Region 4 versions of the \"Knight Rider\" Season One box set.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1983981", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1983981", "title": "Partizansk", "text": "Partizansk\n\nPartizansk () is a town in Primorsky Krai, Russia, located on a spur of the Sikhote-Alin Mountains, about east of Vladivostok, the administrative center of the krai. Population: \n\nThe town was formerly known as Suchan (), but its Russian name was changed to Partizansk in 1972 during a general campaign of cleansing the Chinese toponyms in Outer Manchuria.\n\nA number of creeks flow through the town into the nearby Partizanskaya River, previously known as the Suchan.\n\nPartizansk has a four-season humid continental climate. Its climate contains vast temperature differences between seasons, in spite of its relatively low latitude and position near the Pacific Ocean. It has slightly warmer summers than Vladivostok due to its inland position, whereas winters are similar in both locations, largely but not completely unaffected by any maritime moderation. The cold temperatures for the latitude are due to the Siberian High's influence. The climate features wet and humid summers as well as dry and snow-light winters.\n\nIn the late 19th century, the Vladivostok-based Russian Pacific Fleet was in deep need of a source of coal. The Department of Mines sent a geological expedition to the area south of Ussuriysk, working there from 1888 to 1893. Coal was found, which could be mined and sent to Nakhodka for the needs of the Fleet. In 1896, the Department of Mines made a large order for coal from the Suchan River area, and a settlement for miners was founded. The settlement was originally named Suchansky Rudnik, meaning \"mining pit of Suchan\".\n\nLater in 1896, more detailed prospecting was organized in Suchan, and commercial operations started at around that time. Suchan miners were living in dug-outs, cabins, and tents, and living conditions were awful. Only in 1900, when forty-six highly qualified miners arrived, construction of the mine #1 and of ten houses started. Government-owned coal mines were also established at that time. The first migrants started to move to Suchan.\n\nThe government often neglected to maintain good living conditions for Suchan workers. For the period of 1896–1922, only one two-story house was built. Suchan itself was just a group of several badly planned mine settlements. In 1905 and 1906, state schools were opened and a hospital for fifty people was built.\n\nIn the period of 1905–1914, several new mines were opened in Suchan. Wooden barracks and individual houses also appeared. Construction was carried out without proper planning, with each artel building a barrack for its workers. Some of those buildings remain intact to the present day. The founders of Suchansky Rudnik had not carried out much work up to 1914. After the beginning of World War I, development completely stopped. Many workers were called up for military service, extraction of coal reduced greatly, and construction works were cut down. Difficult years of need and hardship started.\n\nIn 1917, there were eleven mines which annually extracted up to 300,000 tons of coal. In 1918–1922, during the Russian Civil War, the supporters of the Bolsheviks conducted an active partisan struggle in the region. After the establishment of Soviet authority in Primorye, coal remained the region's main production.\n\nAfter 1922, restoration of old mines and building of new ones started. Spread settlements merged into one large locality. Construction of multi-story buildings began. At this time great attention was paid to cultural development of the settlement. In 1917, the People's House was built, which later transformed into a club of miners. It became a cultural center of the settlement. In 1926, a club for 350 people was built near mine #10. In 1932, a club for 200 people near mine #20 and for 250 people at timber plant were built. In 1933, the largest Palace of Culture in Primorye with a hall for 1,200 people started functioning.\n\nTown status was granted in 1932, and the name was shortened to Suchan. Soon after that Suchan was renamed Gamarnik (), after revolutionary commissar Yan Gamarnik; however, the name reverted to Suchan after Gamarnik's suicide (due to possible arrest during the Great Purge) in 1937.\n\nThe town was given its present name in 1972, when the cleansing of Chinese names in Primorsky Krai took place. The nearby Suchan River, from which the town had taken its name, was renamed the Partizanskaya.\n\nWithin the framework of administrative divisions, it is, together with eleven rural localities, incorporated as Partizansk Town Under Krai Jurisdiction—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, Partizansk Town Under Krai Jurisdiction is incorporated as Partizansky Urban Okrug.\n\nThe economy of the town and its surrounding area remains largely reliant on coal mining; however, the industry is currently in decline, with the previous coal reserves largely exhausted. Previous machine-building, chemical and pharmaceutical works have also been closed.\n\nTimber production has grown in importance in recent years. Light industry also prospers, with a garment factory, a tannery, a food-processing plant, and a brewery currently operating.\n\nThe 1970s witnessed some great effort in modernizing the town's industrial sector, crowned with building a power station which was later named after the town. Thirty years later the Partizansk Power Station was renovated and a new generator was installed to boost the output. Despite being one of the less important stations in the energy grid of the krai, especially with the reference to its minor share in the krai's energy output, Partizansk Power Station has a vital role in supplying with electricity the town and the close vicinity.\n\nThe town lies on the branch of the Trans-Siberian Railway leading to Nakhodka; this section of the railroad was completed in 1935.\n\nA coal deposit in Oleny Klyuch (near mine #1) was for the first time mentioned by Vasily Margaritov, a member of the Geographic Society of Amur Krai. This place is now called \"The First Coal\" (as it was the first mine in the area). Today, the mine is no longer in operation, and is commemorated with a cast-iron sign placed there in 1932. The sign contains the following text: \"In 1883 the first coal was found here. Here the mine begins.\"\n\nThe nearby area also includes a number of cliffs and waterfalls.\n\n\n"}

They are now bisected at their western end by the M5 motorway and a railway, the Bristol and Exeter Railway, part of the Great Western Main Line.\n\nThe hills stretch from Puriton, near Bridgwater, in the west, to Street, in the east. The ridge of the hill once accommodated a Roman road, from Ilchester to the port of Combwich. Roman and Iron Age objects from the \"Polden Hill Hoard\" are now in the British Museum. This road crossed the River Parrett by means of a ford, at the White House (White House Rhyne), on the Pawlett Hams. This western extension forms part of a Saxon route. The river crossing could only be used a few hours per day at low tide and was used by Samuel Taylor Coleridge in the 1790s when he stayed at Nether Stowey, to travel to and from Bristol. It went out of use as other roads were improved and the White House, a former public house, is now just a ruin. The modern road, now the A39, is carried on a causeway from the King's Sedgemoor Drain, at Bawdrip, to Bridgwater.\n\nThe Poldens are a low narrow ridge of Blue Lias with alternating bands of limestone and clay. Blue Lias is believed to have been quarried on the Polden Hills in the 15th century; and was quarried in Puriton from the early 19th century until the 1973, when the local cement works closed.\n\nGreat Breach and Copley Woods near Compton Dundon is a Nature Conservation Review Woodland Site, owned and managed by the Somerset Wildlife Trust. It has been designated as a biological Site of Special Scientific Interest because of the invertebrate population.\n\nThe former medieval planned town of \"Caput Montis\" was located at the western end of the Polden Hills. Caput Montis failed as a planned town and now exists as the earth works of a Motte and Bailey in the hamlet of Downend, now a detached part of the village of Puriton. There was also at Dunball a railway Halt, a Hotel, a Post Office and a Wharf - part of the Port of Bridgwater.\n\nThere are a number of small villages situated on both slopes of the ridge, many of which are named in the Domesday Book. Most of the eastern villages, from Street to Cossington, and possibly Woolavington, (which are also parishes) are located in medieval planned-parishes. They once formed parts of the Estates of Glastonbury Abbey.\n\nPuriton -\nBawdrip -\nWoolavington -\nCossington -\nStawell -\nChilton Polden -\nEdington -\nCatcott -\nShapwick -\nAshcott -\nWalton -\nStreet\n\n"}

Traditionally, in monasteries it is held daily so as to end immediately following sunrise, in contrast to parishes where it is held only on Sundays and feast days. It is often called matins after the office it most nearly corresponds to in Western Christian churches.\n\nOrthros is the longest and most complex of the daily cycle of services. It is normally held in the early morning, often — always in monasteries — preceded by the midnight office, and usually followed by the First Hour. On great feasts it is held as part of an all-night vigil commencing the evening before, combined with an augmented great vespers and the first hour. In the Russian tradition, an all-night vigil is celebrated every Saturday evening, typically abridged, however, in spite of its name, to as short as two hours. In the Greek parish tradition, orthros is normally held just before the beginning of the divine liturgy on Sunday and feast day mornings.\n\nThe \"akolouth\" (fixed portion of the service) is composed primarily of psalms and litanies. The \"sequences\" (variable parts) of matins are composed primarily of hymns and canons from the octoechos (an eight-tone cycle of hymns for each day of the week, covering eight weeks), and from the menaion (hymns for each calendar day of the year). During great lent and some of the period preceding it, some of the portions from the octoechos and menaion are replaced by hymns from the triodion and during the paschal season with material from the pentecostarion. On Sundays there is also a gospel reading and corresponding hymns from the eleven-part cycle of resurrectional gospels.\n\n\nIn very traditional monasteries, readings from the Church Fathers are read after each of the sessional hymns.\n\nThere are seven types of Matins:\n\n\n\n\n"}

Since its initial establishment, suggested to be in the 3rd century, the stupa has undergone several reconstructions as recently as the 1930s due to foreign invasions of the area. It is generally regarded as the most important national monument in Laos and a national symbol.\n\nPha That Luang according to the Lao people was originally built as a Hindu temple in the 1st century. Buddhist missionaries from the Mauryan Empire are believed to have been sent by the Emperor Ashoka, including Bury Chan or Praya Chanthabury Pasithisak and five Arahata monks who brought a holy relic (believed to be the breastbone) of Lord Buddha to the stupa. It was rebuilt in the 13th century as a Khmer temple which fell into ruin.\n\nIn the mid-16th century, King Setthathirat relocated his capital from Luang Prabang to Vientiane and ordered the construction of Pha That Luang in 1566. It was rebuilt about 4 km from the centre of Vientiane at the end of Pha That Luang Road and named Pha That Luang. The bases had a length of 69 metres each and was 45 metres high, and was surrounded by 30 small Stupas.\n\nIn 1641, a Dutch envoy of the Dutch East India Company, Gerrit van Wuysthoff, visited Vientiane and was received by King Sourigna Vongsa at the temple, where he was, reportedly, received in a magnificent ceremony. He wrote that he was particularly impressed by the \"enormous pyramid and the top was covered with gold leaf weighing about a thousand pounds\". However, the stupa was repeatedly plundered by the Burmese, Siamese and Chinese.\n\nPha That Luang was destroyed by the Thai invasion in 1828, which left it heavily damaged and abandoned. It was not until 1900 that the French restored to its original design based on the detailed drawings from 1867 by the French architect and explorer Louis Delaporte. However the first attempt to restore it was unsuccessful and it had to be redesigned and then reconstructed in the 1930s. During the Franco-Thai War, Pha That Luang was heavily damaged during a Thai air raid. After the end of World War II, the Pha That Luang was reconstructed.\n\nThe architecture of the building includes many references to Lao culture and identity, and so has become a symbol of Lao nationalism.\n\nThe stupa today consists of three levels, each conveying a reflection of part of the Buddhist doctrine. The first level is 223 feet (67 metres) by 226 feet (68 metres); the second is 157 feet (47 metres) along each side; and the third level is 98 feet (29 metres) along each side. From ground to pinnacle, the Pha That Luang is 147.6 feet (44 metres) high. \n\nThe area around Pha That Luang is now gated, to keep traffic out. Previously visitors could drive around the whole complex. The encircling walls are roughly 279 feet (85 metres) long on each side and contain a large number of Lao and Khmer sculptures including one of Jayavarman VII.\n\n"}

Douglas City sits at an elevation of . The ZIP Code is 96024. The community is inside area code 530. The 2010 United States census reported Douglas City's population was 713. The Whiskeytown–Shasta–Trinity National Recreation Area is nearby.\n\nThe prehistoric residents of the area were Wintun people; from North Fork to Douglas City the group was called \"Tien-Tien\" which means \"friends\". The Karuk called the same people the \"Kashahara\". Local people suffered loss of population beginning with the epidemic of 1842. The explorer Jedediah Smith and his party came through the Hayfork area in 1828, killing several local people to intimidate the others and permit their passage. The Tien-Tien population was further reduced during the gold rush along the Trinity River.\n\nIn 1848, Pierson B. Reading found gold along the Trinity; the bar he worked is at Reading's Creek just south of the Douglas City bridge. Reading took out over $80,000 dollars of gold on his first trip. Douglas Bar was active before 1856. Settlers arrived quickly, workings began on other bars in the area and towns formed at places along the trails for housing and supply. In just two years, every bar along the Trinity and its tributary streams was being worked and agriculture had started in some of the valleys.\n\nDouglas City was settled by Europeans and Americans around 1850 as a mining and supply town. It was named after Stephen Douglas of Illinois, who became well known after the Lincoln–Douglas debates of 1858.\n\nThe Natural Bridge (associated more with Hayfork than Douglas City) was the site of the Bridge Gulch Massacre in March 1852. Trinity Sheriff William H. Dixon and a number of men set out to catch the individuals (thought to be Wintu Indians) who killed a well-liked local butcher by the name of J. R. Anderson. There should be a note of sarcasm that most white men who died by the hands of Native Americans were “well-liked” or “well-known”. The posse never found the assailants of Anderson, but after two days of tracking, did find another (and much larger camp) of Wintu Indians at the natural bridge. They attacked in the early morning hours and killed nearly every man, woman, and child. Accounts vary, but the numbers usually trend toward 150 killed with one to three children surviving.\n\nThe streams and hillsides of the area suffered during the Great Flood of 1862. Gold panning and hydraulic mining continued. By 1864, the river bars around Douglas City had produced over $1,000,000 of gold, an enormous sum in 1864 dollars. The first Post Office in Douglas City started in 1867.\nUntil 1857 all transport to and from Douglas City was by foot, mule or horse. When a private road was built through the area, four-horse stagecoaches ran from Weaverville through Douglas City to Redding Creek, Brown's Creek and Hayfork Valley. In 1863 locals formed the \"Douglas City Rifles\" to combat the Wintun; none of their raids caused bloodshed. In 1859, Theodore Eldon Jones (later the first Trinity County Superior Court Judge) started the short-lived \"Douglas City Gazette\" newspaper. Renamed \"Trinity Gazette\", it stopped publishing in 1861 as people left the area for the American Civil War and new gold diggings in Idaho.\n\nThe Douglas City Library was founded on September 27, 1916 by Maude Marshall who maintained it in her home for both the public and students at the Douglas City school district.\n\nNearby towns and cities include Big Bar, French Gulch, Igo, Junction City, Lewiston, Redding, Weaverville, and Whiskeytown.\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP covers an area of , 99.95% of it land and 0.05% of it water.\n\nPleistocene deposits near Douglas City have Mammoth, Ground sloth and deer fossil bones.\n\nThis region experiences warm (but not hot) and dry summers, with no average monthly temperatures above 71.6 °F. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Douglas City has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate, abbreviated \"Csb\" on climate maps.\n\nThe 2010 United States Census reported that Douglas City had a population of 713. The population density was 28.5 people per square mile (11.0/km²). The racial makeup of Douglas City was 639 (89.6%) White, 0 (0.0%) African American, 22 (3.1%) Native American, 8 (1.1%) Asian, 2 (0.3%) Pacific Islander, 13 (1.8%) from other races, and 29 (4.1%) from two or more races.

{"id": "1984017", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1984017", "title": "Woe from Wit", "text": "Woe from Wit\n\nWoe from Wit (Russian: Го́ре от ума́, also translated as \"The Woes of Wit\", \"Wit Works Woe\", Wit's End, and so forth) is Alexander Griboyedov's comedy in verse, satirizing the society of post-Napoleonic Moscow, or, as a high official in the play styled it, \"a pasquinade on Moscow.\"\n\nThe play, written in 1823 in the countryside and in Tiflis, was not passed by the censors for the stage, and only portions of it were allowed to appear in an almanac for 1825. But it was read out by the author to \"all Moscow\" and to \"all Petersburg\" and circulated in innumerable copies, so it was as good as published in 1825; it was not, however, actually published until 1833, after the author's death, with significant cuts, and was not published in full until 1861.\nThe play was a compulsory work in Russian literature lessons in Soviet schools, and is still considered a golden classic in modern Russia and other minority Russian-speaking countries.\n\nThe play gave rise to numerous catchphrases in the Russian language, including the title itself.\n\nThe play belongs to the classical school of comedy, with principal antecedents in Molière. Like Denis Fonvizin before him and like the founders of the Russian realistic tradition after him, Griboyedov lays far greater stress on the characters and their dialogue than on his plot. The comedy is loosely constructed but in the dialogue and in the character drawing Griboyedov is supreme and unique.\n\nThe dialogue is in rhymed verse, in iambic lines of variable length, a meter that was introduced into Russia by the fabulists as the equivalent of La Fontaine's \"vers libre\" and that had reached a high degree of perfection in the hands of Ivan Krylov. Griboyedov's dialogue is a continuous tour de force. It always attempts and achieves the impossible: the squeezing of everyday conversation into a rebellious metrical form.\n\nGriboyedov seemed to multiply his difficulties on purpose. He was, for instance, alone of his time to use unexpected, sonorous, punning rhymes. There is just enough toughness and angularity in his verse to constantly remind the reader of the pains undergone and the difficulties triumphantly overcome by the poet. Despite the fetters of the metrical form, Griboyedov's dialogue has the natural rhythm of conversation and is more easily colloquial than any prose. It is full of wit, variety, and character, and is a veritable encyclopedia of the best spoken Russian of the period. Almost every other line of the comedy has become part of the language and proverbs from Griboyedov are as numerous as proverbs from Krylov. For epigram, repartee, terse and concise wit, Griboyedov has no rivals in Russian.\n\nGriboyedov's characters, while typical of the period, are moulded from the really common clay of humanity. They all, down to the most episodic characters, have the same perfection of finish and clearness of outline.\n\n\nA number of the characters have names that go a long way toward describing their personality.\n\nFrom Anton Chekhov's \"A Dreary Story from the notebook of an old man\"\n\nin what is more important. When an actor wrapped from head to foot in\nstage traditions and conventions tries to recite a simple ordinary\nspeech, \"To be or not to be,\" not simply, but invariably with the\naccompaniment of hissing and convulsive movements all over his body,\nor when he tries to convince me at all costs that Tchatsky, who talks\nso much with fools and is so fond of folly, is a very clever man, and\nthat \"Woe from Wit\" is not a dull play, the stage gives me the same\nfeeling of conventionality which bored me so much forty years ago when\nI was regaled with the classical howling and beating on the breast.'\n\nDostoevsky's “The Brothers Karamazov” refers to the play as “Sorrow from Wit”.\n\n\n"}

It was developed and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo DS. Nintendo has stated that it is an \"entertainment product 'inspired' by Ryuta Kawashima's work in the neurosciences.\n\nIt was first released in Japan, and later released in North America, Europe, Australia, and South Korea. It was followed by a sequel titled \"\", and was later followed by two redesigns and \"Brain Age Express\" for the Nintendo DSi's DSiWare service which uses popular puzzles from these titles as well as several new puzzles, and \"\" for Nintendo 3DS. A new installment in the series, \"Dr Kawashima's Brain Training for Nintendo Switch\", for the Nintendo Switch, was released in Japan on December 27, 2019.\n\n\"Brain Age\" features a variety of puzzles, including stroop tests, mathematical questions, and Sudoku puzzles, all designed to help keep certain parts of the brain active. It was included in the \"Touch! Generations\" series of video games, a series which features games for a more casual gaming audience. \"Brain Age\" uses the touch screen and microphone for many puzzles. It has received both commercial and critical success, selling 19.01 million copies worldwide (as of September 30, 2015) and has received multiple awards for its quality and innovation. There has been controversy over the game's scientific effectiveness. The game was later released on the Nintendo eShop for the Wii U in Japan in mid-2014.\n\n\"Brain Age\" is designed to be played a little each day, similar to the \"Nintendogs\" titles and \"\". The Nintendo DS is held on its side, with the touch screen on the right for right-handed people and the left for left-handed people. The game is entirely touch and voice-controlled – the player either writes the answer to the puzzle on the touch screen or speaks it into the microphone. Before the player can begin a Brain Age session, he or she must input information. First, players must confirm the date and select which hand they write with. The player then inputs his or her name and date of birth.\n\nAt the end of all Brain Age Check puzzles, Training puzzles, Quick Play puzzles, and Sudoku puzzles, the player is shown how quickly he or she completed it, the player's speed (according to metaphors such as \"bicycle speed\" and \"jet speed\", the highest being \"rocket speed\"), and a tip for either improving the player's brain or a game-related tip. If the player's time or score in Brain Age Check or Training is high enough, it will appear on one or both of the Top Three. The Top Three shown is the player's own top three attempts at a puzzle, while he or she can also compare the top three with those of other saved players.\n\nThe player is also awarded stamps for each day he or she completes the puzzles. When enough is accumulated, the game unlocks certain features such as more puzzles in Training mode, Hard versions of these puzzles, and the ability to customize his or her own stamps.\n\nWhile the player is navigating the menus outside of the puzzles, Professor Kawashima appears to prompt and encourage the user. \"Brain Age\" allows up to four players to save profiles on one DS game card, and these players can interact with each other in several different ways. There are five modes of play – Brain Age Check, Training, Quick Play, Download, and Sudoku.\n\nWhen starting a session, Kawashima may ask the player to participate in a Picture-Drawing Quiz, which requires the player to draw a person, place, or thing by memory using the touch screen. After the player has done all three, the game will compare his or her drawing to an example created by the game developers, along with advice of what to emphasize on below its image. If more than one player profile is saved on the game card, images for the day can be compared to those of other players.\n\nKawashima may also ask the player to participate in a Memory Quiz, which requires the player to recall a recent event, such as what the player ate or the most interesting thing seen on television the day before. Several days later, it will ask for the answer originally provided, and will then compare the answer given several days ago and the answer given on the current day to test the player's recollection skills. The player is not scored on his or her ability to remember. The purpose of these tasks is to help the player improve his or her recollection.\n\nThe game includes four modes: Brain Age Check, Training, Quick Play, and Sudoku. The Brain Age Check gives the player three puzzles to complete. The first is usually a Stroop test, although the player can choose to skip the Stroop test if he or she is not in a quiet environment or is otherwise unable to speak into the microphone. At the end of the Brain Age Check, the game reports on the players \"brain age\", a theoretical assessment of the age of the player's brain. The higher the brain age, the worse the player performed. The best possible score is 20, according with Kawashima's theory that the brain stops developing at 20. The player may replay the Brain Age Check, but it will not change the brain age for the day.\n\nOnce the player confirms whether or not he or she can speak into the microphone, Professor Kawashima will describe the first puzzle. If the player answered that they can speak, the game begins with a Stroop test; if the player cannot use the microphone, the game picks a random puzzle from the following: Calculations X 20, Word Memory, Connect Maze, Number Cruncher, and Speed Counting.\n\nDuring the Stroop Test, the game will display one of four words: blue, black, yellow, and red. A random word will appear on screen, one after another, each appearing in a random color (which may not match the color denoted by the word). The player is instructed to say the color of the word, rather than its semantic meaning (e.g., if the word \"Yellow\" appears in blue letters, the player should say \"blue\" – see Stroop effect for details).\n\nIn Speed Counting, which requires speaking but does not use the microphone, the player counts up from one to 120 as fast as they can without slurring the names of numbers.\n\nWord Memory gives the player a list of 30 four-letter words. The player is given two minutes to study the list and memorize as many words as possible. After this two minutes is up, the player must write down as many words as he or she can in three minutes. Another puzzle called Connect Maze gives players a randomly created group of circles, with letters and numbers in them. There is one circle for every letter in \"A\" through \"M\", as well as a circle for every number from 1 to 13. The player must then connect a line between a letter and a number, starting with \"A\". The player must connect the letter \"A\" to the number one, and then connect it to the letter \"B\" and then the number two, and so on until the player reaches 13.\n\nCalculations X 20 presents the player with 20 mathematical equations, including addition, subtraction, and multiplication. On the top screen are the questions, which scroll up as they are answered (whether correctly or incorrectly), while the touch screen is used to write out the answer. Calculations X 100 is identical to Calculations X 20, but with 100 equations instead of 20.\n\nIn Number Cruncher, the player is presented with a series of screens displaying several numbers, which vary in their appearance and on-screen behavior. For instance, a screen may display five blue numbers, three red numbers, and one moving yellow number, and above it is a question, such as \"how many blue numbers are there?\", which the player must answer as quickly and accurately as possible.\n\nThe Training mode allows the player to play a variety of puzzles, with all but one of the puzzles being exclusive to the Training mode. Once the player completes at least one puzzle, Kawashima awards him or her with a stamp, which he places on the current date. If the player places at least three puzzles, the stamp will expand in size. After accumulating a certain number of stamps, Kawashima will award him or her with a new puzzle, difficulty mode, or additional feature under the Options menu. Each puzzle can be played as many times as the player likes, although only the first play-through of the day will count in the graph for that puzzle.\n\nThere are nine puzzles in Training mode:\n\n\nQuick Play can be played by anyone, whether he or she has a saved file or not. Quick Play allows the player to play three modes – Quick Brain Age Check, Quick Training, and Quick Sudoku, all only providing the player with one of the easy puzzles in each of these modes to try. Quick Brain Age Check only allows the player to play the stroop test. In Quick Training, the game only allows the player to play Calculations X 20. And in Quick Sudoku is only available for North America, Europe and South Korea, the play may only play the easiest Sudoku puzzle available. At the end of each session, the player's brain age or time will be assessed, and Kawashima will give a preview of the full game.\n\nA player with a copy of \"Brain Age\" can send certain game data to other Nintendo DS consoles using the DS Download Play feature. He or she may either download Quick Play mode to this player's Nintendo DS, or Calculations X 30, a variation of the other Calculation puzzles which can be played by up to sixteen people. However, this mode is not supported in the Wii U Virtual Console version.\n\nIncluded in the North America, Europe, Australia and Korea versions of this game is a Sudoku mode, which features more than 100 puzzles across three different modes – Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced. Sudoku involves a 9×9 grid with numbers in every square. Some of these numbers are visible, while others are not. The objective is to fill in the hidden numbers using the visible numbers as hints. Each row, column, and 3×3 grid has nine squares in it, and each must contain each number in the range from 1 to 9.\n\nMany neurologists recommend the game for prevention of dementia/Alzheimer's. Nintendo of America has refused to support any scientific claims to the benefits of the game, stressing that they are in the entertainment business.\n\nOne study involved 600 Scottish students with one group of students who played twenty minutes of Brain Age before class daily for nine weeks and a control group that studied regularly. The students were tested at the beginning and end of the study. In the end, the group that played Brain Age improved test scores by 50%. The time to complete the tests in the Brain Age group dropped by five minutes, and this improvement doubled that of the control group.\n\nAnother study involving 67 ten-year-olds found no evidence to support claims that \"Brain Age\" improves cognitive function better than other means of training one's brain. However, the game states that the best indications of brain age are when the user is at least twenty years of age. Professor of cognitive psychology Alain Lieury at the University of Rennes, France said, \"The Nintendo DS is a technological jewel. As a game it's fine. But it is charlatanism to claim that it is a scientific test.\" Helping children with homework, reading, playing Scrabble or Sudoku, or watching documentaries, matched or beat the benefits of Brain Age. The children were split into four groups. The first two completed a seven-week memory course on a Nintendo DS, the third did puzzles with pencils and paper, and the fourth went to school as normal. Researchers found that children playing \"Brain Age\" failed to show any significant improvement in memory tests. They did do 19% better in mathematics but so did the pencil-and-paper group, and the fourth group did 18% better. In memorization, the pencil-and-paper group had a 33% improvement, while the Brain Age group performed 17% worse. In logic tests, the \"Brain Age\" group had a 10% improvement as did the pencil-and-paper group. The children who had no training improved 20%.\n\nIt has also been stated that the same effects of \"keeping the brain sharp\" can be achieved by either playing Sudoku, Tetris or talking with friends.\n\nA study conducted between March 2010 and August 2010 in Sendai city, Miyagi prefecture, Japan, assessed the impact of the brain training game on the elderly, using a double blinded intervention. Results showed that playing Brain Age for 4 weeks could lead to improved cognitive functions (executive functions and processing speed) in the elderly.\n\nNintendo was looking for something new to develop that would appeal to both traditional and casual gamers. In one of the meetings, the Chief Financial Officer of Nintendo's Japanese division suggested reviewing a published book titled \"\", which was enjoying a great deal of success in Japan. Satoru Iwata, the president of Nintendo, arranged for a meeting with Professor Ryuta Kawashima, the author of the book.\n\nAs both Iwata and Professor Kawashima were too busy to meet under normal circumstances, they both agreed to meet for an hour during the Nintendo DS launch. The original meeting became a brainstorming session that lasted for three hours, in which Professor Kawashima explained the basics of his studies. Iwata assigned a team of nine developers to develop the game and to have it ready in 90 days for demonstration.\n\n\"Brain Age\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s sound director was Masami Yone, while the music was composed by Minako Hamano and Akito Nakatsuka, both having composed music for Nintendo games as early as 1993 and 1987 respectively. The main menu song from this game was later used in \"Super Smash Bros. Brawl\".\n\nThe initial reaction from retailers was that of concern about the new title's ability to sell. The most important retailers in Japan were given the game for 15 minutes to test it out. In the end, Nintendo secured nearly 70,000 orders for the first shipment, an amount above most expectations. In comparison, the sequel had over 850,000 orders placed before its launch.\n\n\"Brain Age\" met with positive sales figures. The game debuted selling around 43,000 copies in May 2005, considered a good number for an educational title. Although most titles only stay in the Japanese weekly top ten list of games for a couple of weeks, \"Brain Age\" managed to stay, as of January 2006, between the most sold games for 34 weeks (except three weeks). As of June 11, 2006, \"Brain Age\" has sold 2,322,970 copies in Japan alone. It was the 94th best-selling game in Japan in 2008, selling 140,992 copies, with total lifetime sales of 3,750,890. During its first three weeks on sale in North America, \"Brain Age\" sold 120,000 copies, becoming the fifteenth title in the top U.S. video game charts during the month of May in terms of units sold. In Europe, \"Brain Age\" received critical acclaim, becoming number 1 in the Nintendo DS sales chart, and number 4 in the all-platforms chart on debut, and selling more than 500,000 units in just over two months. As of January 22, 2007, \"Brain Age\" has sold over 2 million copies in Europe. As of October 30, 2007, \"Brain Age\" has sold over one million copies in the United Kingdom. It was the 10th best-selling Nintendo DS game of December 2008 in the United States. As of September 30, 2015, \"Brain Age\" has worldwide sales of 19.01 million.\n\nThe game was received with generally positive reviews in the Western market, though some criticized the game for poor voice and handwriting recognition at times. The game's design earned it \"Edge\" magazine's \"EIEF06\" Edge Award for innovation. In 2007, \"Brain Age\" received the Interactive Achievement Awards for handheld game of the year. The game has also been featured in numerous media apparitions including newspapers and television in different countries, including the United States (Time magazine and Discovery Channel) and Australia (featured in Seven News). \"Wired\" included the game in its list of \"The 15 Most Influential Games of the Decade\" at No. 5, due to how it \"bucked the dominant trends\" and \"ushered in the era of games that are (supposedly) good for you, like \"Wii Fit\".\"\n\nThe positive sales figures and overall reception in Japan led to \"Brain Age\" being released in various countries around the world. In the North American market, the game is known as \"Brain Age: Train Your Brain in Minutes a Day\" and was released on April 17, 2006, and included 108 Sudoku puzzles of different levels of difficulty. Nintendo gave out copies of the North American version of \"Brain Age\" at the 2006 Game Developers Conference. They also shipped free retail versions to special members of the Nintendo NSider Forums. Both groups received their copies before the official release date. It has also been given away to certain retailers with the purchase of a Nintendo DS Lite.\n\nThe game was released as \"Dr Kawashima's Brain Training: How Old Is Your Brain?\" in the UK and Ireland. Like the American version, this version also features Sudoku. All 3 parts are saved on one cartridge. In the UK, its initial television commercials featured Chris Tarrant. Nicole Kidman, Ronan Keating, and Patrick Stewart feature in current European commercials for the \"Brain Age\" series.\n\nNintendo Australia featured an ad campaign that coincided with its Australian release. During the period of June 15, 2006 to July 17, 2006, Nintendo Australia stated that for every copy of \"Brain Age\" purchased, Nintendo would donate $1.00 to Alzheimer's Australia.\n\nThe game was one of the launch titles for the DS Lite in South Korea, along with \"\". It was released on January 18, 2007.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1984020", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1984020", "title": "Union blockade", "text": "Union blockade\n\nThe Union blockade in the American Civil War was a naval strategy by the United States to prevent the Confederacy from trading.\n\nThe blockade was proclaimed by President Abraham Lincoln in April 1861, and required the monitoring of of Atlantic and Gulf coastline, including 12 major ports, notably New Orleans and Mobile. Those blockade runners fast enough to evade the Union Navy could only carry a small fraction of the supplies needed. They were operated largely by British citizens, making use of neutral ports such as Havana, Nassau and Bermuda. The Union commissioned around 500 ships, which destroyed or captured about 1,500 blockade runners over the course of the war.\n\nOn April 19, 1861, President Lincoln issued a \"Proclamation of Blockade Against Southern Ports\": \nWhereas an insurrection against the Government of the United States has broken out in the States of South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas, and the laws of the United States for the collection of the revenue cannot be effectually executed therein comformably to that provision of the Constitution which requires duties to be uniform throughout the United States:\n\nAnd whereas a combination of persons engaged in such insurrection, have threatened to grant pretended letters of marque to authorize the bearers thereof to commit assaults on the lives, vessels, and property of good citizens of the country lawfully engaged in commerce on the high seas, and in waters of the United States: And whereas an Executive Proclamation has been already issued, requiring the persons engaged in these disorderly proceedings to desist therefrom, calling out a militia force for the purpose of repressing the same, and convening Congress in extraordinary session, to deliberate and determine thereon:\n\nNow, therefore, I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States, with a view to the same purposes before mentioned, and to the protection of the public peace, and the lives and property of quiet and orderly citizens pursuing their lawful occupations, until Congress shall have assembled and deliberated on the said unlawful proceedings, or until the same shall ceased, have further deemed it advisable to set on foot a blockade of the ports within the States aforesaid, in pursuance of the laws of the United States, and of the law of Nations, in such case provided. For this purpose a competent force will be posted so as to prevent entrance and exit of vessels from the ports aforesaid. If, therefore, with a view to violate such blockade, a vessel shall approach, or shall attempt to leave either of the said ports, she will be duly warned by the Commander of one of the blockading vessels, who will endorse on her register the fact and date of such warning, and if the same vessel shall again attempt to enter or leave the blockaded port, she will be captured and sent to the nearest convenient port, for such proceedings against her and her cargo as prize, as may be deemed advisable.\n\nAnd I hereby proclaim and declare that if any person, under the pretended authority of the said States, or under any other pretense, shall molest a vessel of the United States, or the persons or cargo on board of her, such person will be held amenable to the laws of the United States for the prevention and punishment of piracy.\n\nIn witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand, and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.\n\nDone at the City of Washington, this nineteenth day of April, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-one, and of the Independence of the United States the eighty-fifth.\nIn his \"Memoirs of Service Afloat\", Raphael Semmes contended that the announcement of a blockade carried de facto recognition of the Confederate States of America as an independent national entity since countries do not blockade their own ports but rather \"close\" them \"(See Boston Port Act)\". Under international law and maritime law, however, nations had the right to stop and search neutral ships in international waters if they were suspected of violating a blockade, something port closures would not allow. In an effort to avoid conflict between the United States and Britain over the searching of British merchant vessels thought to be trading with the Confederacy, the Union needed the privileges of international law that came with the declaration of a blockade.\n\nHowever, by effectively declaring the Confederate States of America to be belligerents—rather than insurrectionists, who under international law were not eligible for recognition by foreign powers—Lincoln opened the way for Britain and France to recognize the Confederacy. Britain's proclamation of neutrality was consistent with the Lincoln Administration's position—that under international law the Confederates were belligerents—and helped legitimize the Confederate States of America's national right to obtain loans and buy arms from neutral nations. The British proclamation also formally gave Britain the diplomatic right to discuss openly which side, if any, to support.\n\nA joint Union military-navy commission, known as the Blockade Strategy Board, was formed to make plans for seizing major Southern ports to utilize as Union bases of operations to expand the blockade. It first met in June 1861 in Washington, D.C., under the leadership of Captain Samuel F. Du Pont.\n\nIn the initial phase of the blockade, Union forces concentrated on the Atlantic Coast. The November 1861 capture of Port Royal in South Carolina provided the Federals with an open ocean port and repair and maintenance facilities in good operating condition. It became an early base of operations for further expansion of the blockade along the Atlantic coastline, including the Stone Fleet. Apalachicola, Florida, received Confederate goods traveling down the Chattahoochee River from Columbus, Georgia, and was an early target of Union blockade efforts on Florida's Gulf Coast. Another early prize was Ship Island, which gave the Navy a base from which to patrol the entrances to both the Mississippi River and Mobile Bay. The Navy gradually extended its reach throughout the Gulf of Mexico to the Texas coastline, including Galveston and Sabine Pass.\n\nWith 3,500 miles (5,600 km) of Confederate coastline and 180 possible ports of entry to patrol, the blockade would be the largest such effort ever attempted. The United States Navy had 42 ships in active service, and another 48 laid up and listed as available as soon as crews could be assembled and trained. Half were sailing ships, some were technologically outdated, most were at the time patrolling distant oceans, one served on Lake Erie and could not be moved into the ocean, and another had gone missing off Hawaii. At the time of the declaration of the blockade, the Union only had three ships suitable for blockade duty. The Navy Department, under the leadership of Navy Secretary Gideon Welles, quickly moved to expand the fleet. U.S. warships patrolling abroad were recalled, a massive shipbuilding program was launched, civilian merchant and passenger ships were purchased for naval service, and captured blockade runners were commissioned into the navy. In 1861, nearly 80 steamers and 60 sailing ships were added to the fleet, and the number of blockading vessels rose to 160. Some 52 more warships were under construction by the end of the year. By November 1862, there were 282 steamers and 102 sailing ships. By the end of the war, the Union Navy had grown to a size of 671 ships, making it the largest navy in the world.\n\nBy the end of 1861, the Navy had grown to 24,000 officers and enlisted men, over 15,000 more than in antebellum service. Four squadrons of ships were deployed, two in the Atlantic and two in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nBlockade service was attractive to Federal seamen and landsmen alike. Blockade station service was considered the most boring job in the war but also the most attractive in terms of potential financial gain. The task was for the fleet to sail back and forth to intercept any blockade runners. More than 50,000 men volunteered for the boring duty, because food and living conditions on ship were much better than the infantry offered, the work was safer, and especially because of the real (albeit small) chance for big money. Captured ships and their cargoes were sold at auction and the proceeds split among the sailors. When \"Eolus\" seized the hapless blockade runner \"Hope\" off Wilmington, North Carolina, in late 1864, the captain won $13,000 ($ today), the chief engineer $6,700, the seamen more than $1,000 each, and the cabin boy $533, compared to infantry pay of $13 ($ today) per month. The amount garnered for a prize of war widely varied. While the little \"Alligator\" sold for only $50, bagging the \"Memphis\" brought in $510,000 ($ today) (about what 40 civilian workers could earn in a lifetime of work). In four years, $25 million in prize money was awarded.\n\nWhile a large proportion of blockade runners did manage to evade the Union ships, as the blockade matured, the type of ship most likely to find success in evading the naval cordon was a small, light ship with a short draft—qualities that facilitated blockade running but were poorly suited to carrying large amounts of heavy weaponry, metals, and other supplies badly needed by the South. To be successful in helping the Confederacy, a blockade runner had to make many trips; eventually, most were captured or sunk. Nonetheless, five out of six attempts to evade the Union blockade were successful. During the war, some 1,500 blockade runners were captured or destroyed.\n\nOrdinary freighters were too slow and visible to escape the Navy. The blockade runners therefore relied mainly on new steamships built in Britain with low profiles, shallow draft, and high speed. Their paddle-wheels, driven by steam engines that burned smokeless anthracite coal, could make . Because the South lacked sufficient sailors, skippers and shipbuilding capability, the runners were built, commanded and manned by British officers and sailors. Private British investors spent perhaps £50 million on the runners ($250 million in U.S. dollars, equivalent to about $2.5 billion in 2006 dollars). The pay was high: a Royal Navy officer on leave might earn several thousand dollars (in gold) in salary and bonus per round trip, with ordinary seamen earning several hundred dollars.\nThe blockade runners were based in the British islands of Bermuda and the Bahamas, or Havana, in Spanish Cuba. The goods they carried were brought to these places by ordinary cargo ships, and loaded onto the runners. The runners then ran the gauntlet between their bases and Confederate ports, some apart. On each trip, a runner carried several hundred tons of compact, high-value cargo such as cotton, turpentine or tobacco outbound, and rifles, medicine, brandy, lingerie and coffee inbound. Often they also carried mail. They charged from $300 to $1,000 per ton of cargo brought in; two round trips a month would generate perhaps $250,000 in revenue (and $80,000 in wages and expenses).\n\nBlockade runners preferred to run past the Union Navy at night, either on moonless nights, before the moon rose, or after it set. As they approached the coastline, the ships showed no lights, and sailors were prohibited from smoking. Likewise, Union warships covered all their lights, except perhaps a faint light on the commander's ship. If a Union warship discovered a blockade runner, it fired signal rockets in the direction of its course to alert other ships. The runners adapted to such tactics by firing their own rockets in different directions to confuse Union warships.\n\nIn November 1864, a wholesaler in Wilmington asked his agent in the Bahamas to stop sending so much chloroform and instead send \"essence of cognac\" because that perfume would sell \"quite high\". Confederate patriots held rich blockade runners in contempt for profiteering on luxuries while the soldiers were in rags. On the other hand, their bravery and initiative were necessary for the nation's survival, and many women in the back country flaunted imported $10 gewgaws and $50 hats as patriotic proof that the \"damn yankees\" had failed to isolate them from the outer world. The government in Richmond, Virginia, eventually regulated the traffic, requiring half the imports to be munitions; it even purchased and operated some runners on its own account and made sure they loaded vital war goods. By 1864, Lee's soldiers were eating imported meat. Blockade running was reasonably safe for both sides. It was not illegal under international law; captured foreign sailors were released, while Confederates went to prison camps. The ships were unarmed (the weight of cannon would slow them down), so they posed no danger to the Navy warships.\n\nOne example of the lucrative (and short-lived) nature of the blockade running trade was the ship \"Banshee\", which operated out of Nassau and Bermuda. She was captured on her seventh run into Wilmington, North Carolina, and confiscated by the U.S. Navy for use as a blockading ship. However, at the time of her capture, she had turned a 700% profit for her English owners, who quickly commissioned and built \"Banshee No. 2\", which soon joined the firm's fleet of blockade runners.\n\nIn May 1865, CSS \"Lark\" became the last Confederate ship to slip out of a Southern port and successfully evade the Union blockade when she left Galveston, Texas, for Havana.\n\nThe Union blockade was a powerful weapon that eventually ruined the Southern economy, at the cost of very few lives. The measure of the blockade's success was not the few ships that slipped through, but the thousands that never tried it. Ordinary freighters had no reasonable hope of evading the blockade and stopped calling at Southern ports. The interdiction of coastal traffic meant that long-distance travel depended on the rickety railroad system, which never overcame the devastating impact of the blockade. Throughout the war, the South produced enough food for civilians and soldiers, but it had growing difficulty in moving surpluses to areas of scarcity and famine. Lee's army, at the end of the supply line, nearly always was short of supplies as the war progressed into its final two years.\n\nWhen the blockade began in 1861, it was only partially effective. It has been estimated that only one in ten ships trying to evade the blockade were intercepted. However, the Union Navy gradually increased in size throughout the war, and was able to drastically reduce shipments into Confederate ports. By 1864, one in every three ships attempting to run the blockade were being intercepted. In the final two years of the war, the only ships with a reasonable chance of evading the blockade were blockade runners specifically designed for speed.\n\nThe blockade almost totally choked off Southern cotton exports, which the Confederacy depended on for hard currency. Cotton exports fell 95%, from 10 million bales in the three years prior to the war to just 500,000 bales during the blockade period. The blockade also largely reduced imports of food, medicine, war materials, manufactured goods, and luxury items, resulting in severe shortages and inflation. Shortages of bread led to occasional bread riots in Richmond and other cities, showing that patriotism was not sufficient to satisfy the daily demands of the people. Land routes remained open for cattle drovers, but after the Union seized control of the Mississippi River in summer 1863, it became impossible to ship horses, cattle and swine from Texas and Arkansas to the eastern Confederacy. The blockade was a triumph of the Union Navy and a major factor in winning the war.\n\nThe southern cotton industry began to heavily influence the British economy. On the eve of the war, 1,390,938,752 pounds weight of cotton were imported into Great Britain in 1860. Of this, the United States supplied 1,115,890,608 pounds, or about five-sixths of the whole. Not only was Great Britain aware of the impact of Southern cotton, but so was the South. They were confident that their industry held large power, so much, that they referred to their industry as \"King Cotton.\" This slogan was used to declare its supremacy in America. On the floor of the U.S. Senate, Senator James Henry Hammond declaimed (March 4, 1858): \"You dare not make war upon cotton! No power on earth dares make war upon it. Cotton is king.\" The South proclaimed that many domestic and even some international markets depended so heavily on their cotton, that no one would dare spark tensions with the South. They also viewed this slogan as their reasoning behind why they should achieve their efforts in seceding from the Union. The Southern Cotton industry was so confident in the power of cotton diplomacy, that without warning, they refused to export cotton for one day.\n\nImagining an overwhelming response of pleas for their cotton, the Southern cotton industry experienced quite the opposite. With the decisions of Lincoln and the lack of intervention on Great Britain's part, the South was officially blockaded. Following the U.S. announcement of its intention to establish an official blockade of Confederate ports, foreign governments began to recognize the Confederacy as a belligerent in the Civil War. Great Britain declared belligerent status on May 13, 1861, followed by Spain on June 17 and Brazil on August 1. This was the first glimpse of failure for the Confederate South.\n\nThe decision to blockade Southern port cities took a large toll on the British economy but they weighed their consequences. Great Britain had a good amount of cotton stored up in warehouses in several locations that would provide for their textile needs for some time. But eventually Great Britain began to see the effects of the blockade, \"the blockade had a negative impact on the economies of other countries. Textile manufacturing areas in Britain and France that depended on Southern cotton entered periods of high unemployment...\" in the so-called Lancashire Cotton Famine. The article written in the New York Times further proves that Great Britain was aware of the influence of cotton in their empire, \"Nearly one million of operatives are employed in the manufacture of cotton in Great Britain, upon whom, at least five or six millions more depend for their daily subsistence. It is no exaggeration to say, that one-quarter of the inhabitants of England are directly dependent upon the supply of cotton for their living.\" Despite these consequences, Great Britain concluded that their decision was crucial in terms of reaching abolition of slavery in the United States.\n\nThe Confederacy constructed torpedo boats, tending to be small, fast steam launches equipped with spar torpedoes, to attack the blockading fleet. Some torpedo boats were refitted steam launches; others, such as the CSS \"David\" class, were purpose-built. The torpedo boats tried to attack under cover of night by ramming the spar torpedo into the hull of the blockading ship, then backing off and detonating the explosive. The torpedo boats were not very effective and were easily countered by simple measures such as hanging chains over the sides of ships to foul the screws of the torpedo boats, or encircling the ships with wooden booms to trap the torpedoes at a distance.\n\nOne historically notable naval action was the attack of the Confederate submarine \"H. L. Hunley\", a hand-powered submarine launched from Charleston, South Carolina, against Union blockade ships. On the night of 17 February 1864, \"Hunley\" attacked . \"Housatonic\" sank with the loss of five crew; \"Hunley\" also sank, taking her crew of eight to the bottom.\n\nThe first victory for the U.S. Navy during the early phases of the blockade occurred on 24 April 1861, when the sloop \"Cumberland\" and a small flotilla of support ships began seizing Confederate ships and privateers in the vicinity of Fort Monroe off the Virginia coastline. Within the next two weeks, Flag Officer Garrett J. Pendergrast had captured 16 enemy vessels, serving early notice to the Confederate War Department that the blockade would be effective if extended.\n\nEarly battles in support of the blockade included the Blockade of the Chesapeake Bay, from May to June 1861, and the Blockade of the Carolina Coast, August–December 1861. Both enabled the Union Navy to gradually extend its blockade southward along the Atlantic seaboard.\n\nIn early March 1862, the blockade of the James River in Virginia was gravely threatened by the first ironclad, CSS \"Virginia\" in the dramatic Battle of Hampton Roads. Only the timely entry of the new Union ironclad forestalled the threat. Two months later, \"Virginia\" and other ships of the James River Squadron were scuttled in response to the Union Army and Navy advances.\n\nThe port of Savannah, Georgia was effectively sealed by the reduction and surrender of Fort Pulaski on 11 April.\n\nThe largest Confederate port, New Orleans, Louisiana, was ill-suited to blockade running since the channels could be sealed by the U.S. Navy. From 16–22 April, the major forts below the city, Forts Jackson and St. Philip were bombarded by David Dixon Porter's mortar schooners. On 22 April, Flag Officer David Farragut's fleet cleared a passage through the obstructions. The fleet successfully ran past the forts on the morning of 24 April. This forced the surrender of the forts and New Orleans.\n\nThe Battle of Mobile Bay on 5 August 1864 closed the last major Confederate port in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nIn December 1864, Union Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles sent a force against Fort Fisher, which protected the Confederacy's access to the Atlantic from Wilmington, North Carolina, the last open Confederate port on the Atlantic Coast. The first attack failed, but with a change in tactics (and Union generals), the fort fell in January 1865, closing the last major Confederate port.\n\nAs the Union fleet grew in size, speed and sophistication, more ports came under Federal control. After 1862, only three ports east of the Mississippi—Wilmington, North Carolina; Charleston, South Carolina; and Mobile, Alabama—remained open for the 75–100 blockade runners in business. Charleston was shut down by Admiral John A. Dahlgren's South Atlantic Blockading Squadron in 1863. Mobile Bay was captured in August 1864 by Admiral David Farragut. Blockade runners faced an increasing risk of capture—in 1861 and 1862, one sortie in 9 ended in capture; in 1863 and 1864, one in three. By war's end, imports had been choked to a trickle as the number of captures came to 50% of the sorties. Some 1,100 blockade runners were captured (and another 300 destroyed). British investors frequently made the mistake of reinvesting their profits in the trade; when the war ended they were stuck with useless ships and rapidly depreciating cotton. In the final accounting, perhaps half the investors took a profit, and half a loss.\n\nThe Union victory at Vicksburg, Mississippi, in July 1863 opened up the Mississippi River and effectively cut off the western Confederacy as a source of troops and supplies. The fall of Fort Fisher and the city of Wilmington, North Carolina, early in 1865 closed the last major port for blockade runners, and in quick succession Richmond was evacuated, the Army of Northern Virginia disintegrated, and General Lee surrendered. Thus, most economists give the Union blockade a prominent role in the outcome of the war. (Elekund, 2004)\n\nThe Union naval ships enforcing the blockade were divided into squadrons based on their area of operation.\n\nThe Atlantic Blockading Squadron was a unit of the United States Navy created in the early days of the American Civil War to enforce a blockade of the ports of the Confederate States. It was originally formed in 1861 as the Coast Blockading Squadron before being renamed May 17, 1861. It was split the same year for the creation of the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron and the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron.\n\nThe North Atlantic Blockading Squadron was based at Hampton Roads, Virginia, and was tasked with coverage of Virginia and North Carolina. Its official range of operation was from the Potomac River to Cape Fear in North Carolina. It was tasked primarily with preventing Confederate ships from supplying troops and with supporting Union troops. It was created when the Atlantic Blockading Squadron was split between the North and South Atlantic Blockading Squadrons on 29 October 1861. After the end of the war, the squadron was merged into the Atlantic Squadron on 25 July 1865.\n\nThe South Atlantic Blockading Squadron was tasked primarily with preventing Confederate ships from supplying troops and with supporting Union troops operating between Cape Henry in Virginia down to Key West in Florida. It was created when the Atlantic Blockading Squadron was split between the North and South Atlantic Blockading Squadrons on 29 October 1861. After the end of the war, the squadron was merged into the Atlantic Squadron on 25 July 1865.\n\nThe Gulf Blockading Squadron was a squadron of the United States Navy in the early part of the War, patrolling from Key West to the Mexican border. The squadron was the largest in operation. It was split into the East and West Gulf Blockading Squadrons in early 1862 for more efficiency.\n\nThe East Gulf Blockading Squadron, assigned the Florida coast from east of Pensacola to Cape Canaveral, was a minor command. The squadron was headquartered in Key West and was supported by a U.S. Navy coal depot and storehouse built during 1856–61.\n\nThe West Gulf Blockading Squadron was tasked primarily with preventing Confederate ships from supplying troops and with supporting Union troops along the western half of the Gulf Coast, from the mouth of the Mississippi to the Rio Grande and south, beyond the border with Mexico. It was created early in 1862 when the Gulf Blockading Squadron was split between the East and West. This unit was the main military force deployed by the Union in the capture and brief occupation of Galveston, Texas in 1862.\n\n\n\n"}

The device may also change the voltage, but if it does, that is incidental to its principal purpose, since voltage conversion of alternating current is much easier to achieve than frequency conversion.\n\nTraditionally, these devices were electromechanical machines called a motor-generator set. Also devices with mercury arc rectifiers or vacuum tubes were in use. With the advent of solid state electronics, it has become possible to build completely electronic frequency changers. These devices usually consist of a rectifier stage (producing direct current) which is then inverted to produce AC of the desired frequency. The inverter may use thyristors, IGCTs or IGBTs. If voltage conversion is desired, a transformer will usually be included in either the ac input or output circuitry and this transformer may also provide galvanic isolation between the input and output ac circuits. A battery may also be added to the DC circuitry to improve the converter's ride-through of brief outages in the input power.\n\nFrequency changers vary in power-handling capability from a few watts to megawatts.\n\nFrequency changers are used for converting bulk AC power from one frequency to another, when two adjacent power grids operate at different utility frequency. \n\nA variable-frequency drive is a type of frequency changer used for speed control of AC motors such as used for pumps and fans. The speed of an AC motor is dependent on the frequency of the AC power supply, so changing frequency allows the motor speed to be changed. This allows fan or pump output to be varied to match process conditions, which can provide energy savings. \n\nAnother application is in the aerospace and airline industries. Often airplanes use 400 Hz power so a 50 Hz or 60 Hz to 400 Hz frequency converter is needed for use in the ground power unit used to power the airplane while it is on the ground. Airlines might also utilize the converters to provide in-air wall current to passengers for use with laptops and the like. Radio and combat systems equipment on Navy warships is often also powered by 400 Hz to reduce noise on the DC signal after rectification.\n\nIn renewable energy systems, frequency converters are an essential component of doubly fed induction generators (DFIGs) as used in modern multi-megawatt class wind turbines.\n\nAn HVDC-system can serve as frequency converter for large loads.\n\nFrequency converter may also refer to a much-lower-powered circuit that converts radio frequency signals at one frequency to another frequency, especially in a Superheterodyne receiver. See Frequency mixer. The circuit usually consists of a local oscillator and frequency mixer (analog multiplier) that generates sum and difference frequencies from the input and local oscillator, of which one (the Intermediate frequency) will be required for further amplification, while the others are filtered out. The same result was achieved historically by the pentagrid converter or a Triode and Hexode in a single tube, but can be implemented in transistor radios economically by a single transistor functioning as a self-oscillating mixer.\n\n\n"}

Founded in 1906, it is organized as an outdoor recreation, education, and conservation 501(c)(3) nonprofit, and is based in Seattle, Washington. The Mountaineers host a wide range of outdoor activities, primarily alpine mountain climbing and hikes. The club also hosts classes, training courses, and social events. \n\nThe club runs a publishing business, Mountaineers Books, which has several imprints and whose books are sold by major retailers. The famous manual, \"\", is published by Mountaineers Books.\n\nThe Mountaineers has 7 branches in Western Washington, 3 mountain lodges, and 2 program centers, one in Magnuson Park in Seattle, and one in Tacoma. All classes and trips are organized and led by volunteers, and includes activities like hiking, climbing, scrambling, navigation skills, first aid, photography, sailing, kayaking, and skiing, as well as community activities like film festivals and potlucks. The Mountaineers also publishes books, ebooks and guides on outdoor education, recreation and conservation.\n\nThere are no restrictions on who may join.\n\nOriginally a Seattle-based part of the Mazamas, a Portland based group founded in 1894, The Mountaineers formed their own branch shortly after the 1906 Mazamas Mount Baker expedition and dubbed themselves \"The Mountaineers\" with 110 charter members—nearly half women. The club constitution was officially adopted in 1907 by a membership of 151. Among these original members were Henry Landes (University of Washington geology dean and later acting president), Edmond S. Meany (the father of the University of Washington Forestry school), the famous photographer Asahel Curtis, and Seattle photographer and North Cascades guide Lawrence Denny Lindsley.\n\nThe activities initially were local walks with the first trip being a hike through Fort Lawton to the West Point Lighthouse (now part of Discovery Park). The first mountain climbing trip was Mount Si. In 1907, 65 members made a group climb of Mount Olympus and exploration of the Olympic Mountains. The next year a summit of Mount Baker was organized, followed by Mount Rainier in 1909. In 1915, a club outing became the first sizable group to hike around Mount Rainier and established the route that would later become known as the Wonderland Trail. The club organizes thousands of trips per year, has a large library and historical archive, teaches instructional courses, and advocates access and environmental causes.\n\nFrom 1907 to 1995, new climbs in the Cascades were reported in the Mountaineers Annual. Since 2004, the Northwest Mountaineering Journal (NWMJ), hosted by the Mountaineers, has recorded this information.\n\nIn the first 100 years since the club's founding it expanded to over 10,000 active members and expanded its offerings from a single annual alpine climb to over two dozen different types of activities occurring throughout the year including backpacking, biking, folk dancing, hiking, rock climbing, skiing, snowshoeing, volleyball, and water sports. The organization provides a forum for members to organize their own trips and find partners for climbs. Many classes are offered beyond climbing skills including nature photography. navigation, and first aid. A thirty-hour wilderness first aid course called \"Mountaineering Oriented First Aid\" (MOFA) was produced by the organization. The organization is home to The Mountaineers Players which perform in the organization's Forest Theatre on the Kitsap Peninsula and The Mountaineers Books publishing which publishes outdoor related literature and guidebooks.\n\nIn 2008, the Mountaineers moved from Lower Queen Anne to an old naval building in Magnuson Park, now leased from the City of Seattle. The new facility features indoor and outdoor climbing walls, including an indoor ice climbing wall. The grounds also feature native plants and a rock amphitheater for practicing scrambling and rugged hiking.\n\nThe Mountaineers operates three rustic lodges in the mountains of Washington State. They are primarily used as base-camps for activities, classes, and personal recreation trips. All have commercial kitchens and hostel-style sleeping accommodations. They can be rented for private functions, such as weddings, and Meany Lodge has served as the filming location for a movie.\n\nThe Mountaineers Library was founded in 1915. As of 2011 it contains 6000 books and subscribes to 40 periodicals. It specializes in studies on climbing, environmental studies, biographies of mountaineers, the history of exploratory mountaineering, and natural history.\n\nMountaineers Books, based in Seattle, Washington, is the professional book publishing division of The Mountaineers. Mountaineers Books was informally started in 1955 when a volunteer committee was formed to create a mountaineering training text from the materials that the Club was using for its classes.\n\nAccording to \"The Mountaineers: A History\" (Mountaineers Books, 1998), the committee was headed by member Harvey Manning, an accomplished climber who would go on to write more than 20 guidebooks during his association with the publishing business he helped found. The editorial committee created \"\", which produced its ninth edition in 2017. The first edition of \"Freedom\", as it is commonly called, was published in April 1960. The Club's editorial committee remained a unit and began additional publishing projects focusing on both outdoor recreation—such as hiking, climbing, and paddling—and on conservation topics—such as the preservation of wild places.\n\nMountaineers Books has produced more than 1,000 titles since its foundation in 1960. It shares the Club's 501(c)(3) nonprofit status. It also publishes conservation advocacy titles under the Braided River imprint, which is devoted to conservation education and is also a 501(c)(3) nonprofit.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1984035", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1984035", "title": "Oral Fixation, Vol. 2", "text": "Oral Fixation, Vol. 2\n\nOral Fixation, Vol. 2 (Spanish: \"Fijación Oral, Vol. 2\") is the seventh studio album and second English language album by Colombian singer and songwriter Shakira, released on 28 November 2005, by Epic Records. After attaining international success with her fifth studio effort, \"Laundry Service\" (2001), Shakira decided to create a two-part follow-up record. She released the project as the follow-up to her sixth studio effort \"Fijación Oral, Vol. 1\", with which she had attained international success five months prior. As co-producer, Shakira enlisted producers including previous collaborators Gustavo Cerati, Lester Mendez, Luis Fernando Ochoa and Rick Rubin to work alongside newer partners Jerry Duplessis, Wyclef Jean, Tim Mitchell and The Matrix.\n\nMusically the album follows in the vein of her earlier works, the album is heavily influenced by Latin pop styles, and additionally incorporates elements of dance-pop, pop rock, and trip hop. Upon its release, \"Oral Fixation, Vol. 2\" received generally favorable reviews from music critics, who complimented it as her strongest project to date. The album debuted at number five on the US \"Billboard\" 200 with first-week sales of 128,000 copies, the album was later certified platinum by Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and has sold over 1.7 million units in the country. It additionally topped charts in Denmark and Mexico. Globally, the album has sold over 8 million copies.\n\nThree singles were released from the album. Its lead single, \"Don't Bother\", reached number forty-two on the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100. The second single, \"Hips Don't Lie\", was included on the album's re-issue after peaking at number one in the country, becoming her first single to do so. The third and final single, \"Illegal\", peaked at number one on the \"Billboard\" Hot Dance Club Songs component chart. In December 2006, the albums were reissued as an expanded version, titled \"Oral Fixation, Vol. 1 & 2\". The projects were additionally promoted through the Oral Fixation Tour, which visited several countries throughout 2006 and 2007.\n\nAfter attaining international success with her third studio effort, \"Laundry Service\", in 2001, Shakira opted to create a two-part follow-up record. Having co-written nearly sixty tracks for \"Laundry Service\", she put herself \"on the mission of selecting [her] favorite ones\" to record for \"Oral Fixation, Vol. 2\" and its predecessor, the Spanish-language \"Fijación Oral, Vol. 1\". While recording the project, Shakira worked with previous collaborators Gustavo Cerati, Lester Mendez, Luis Fernando Ochoa and Rick Rubin, and newer partners Jerry Duplessis, Wyclef Jean, Tim Mitchell and The Matrix.\n\nFor the album, Shakira wrote all the lyrics, and the majority of the music. \"To start seeing people's first reactions, and how people start relating to these songs and appreciating every single piece of work I have done over the past two years, is the best reward an artist can have after so much hard work,\" says Shakira. \"I will not lie to you; it was not a path of roses. It was painful at times to come up with two albums, to write more than 60 songs and to fight my own insecurities and doubts.\" While speaking about the difference about expressing herself in Spanish and English, Shakira told, \"When I express myself in Spanish, I find elements that help me express an idea in perhaps a different way than when I do it in English. There are different aesthetics, but there is a certain style to the way I write my own songs, a particular way of describing feelings and emotions that I have developed over all these years making songs. I have gotten in touch with my own gift - I am sure, 10 years ago, I was not half as good as I can say I am today, and I am still not good enough. There is a long way to go.\"\n\nShakira designed the artworks for both \"Oral Fixation\" records, and commented that they were inspired by the biblical figure of Eve, elaborating that she wanted \"to attribute to Eve one more reason to bite the forbidden fruit, and that would be her oral fixation\" and that \"[she always felt] that [she has] been a very oral person. [It is her] biggest source of pleasure\". The second volume's cover sees an unclothed Shakira covered by a tree's branches and leaves while holding an apple in her hand. The baby girl she held in her arms on the cover of the first volume is sitting in the tree, alluding to psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud's theory that infants begin discovering the world through their mouths during the oral stage of psychosexual development.\n\nFor Jon Pareles of \"The New York Times\", \"For obvious reasons, it's eye-catching, as was the cover of the Spanish-language companion album, \"Fijación Oral, Vol. 1\". On Middle East versions of the album, Shakira was covered up with leaves which left her to be standing behind a bush, which surprised the singer. \"Complex\" magazine selected the album cover as the eleventh \"sexiest album cover of all time\", writing that it is \"the hottest portrayal of Eve in the Garden of Eden we can imagine.\" \"Maxim\" also listed the album's cover as one of the \"sexiest album covers\", writing that, \"A naked girl holding up an apple in a garden is played out, but not when the girl is hip-shaking Shakira. Damn, it could happen all over again, couldn't it?.\"\n\nFor Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic, the album touches on everything from the expected Latin rhythms to glitzy Euro disco, trashy American rock & roll, and stomping Britpop, all punctuated by some stark confessionals. \"How Do You Do\" is a bold opening track that features Gregorian chants and an eerie reciting of \"The Lord's Prayer\" before thrusting the listener into a song similar to Sarah McLachlan's 'Dear God', according to Kristina Weise of \"Songwriting Universe\". It presents bitter questions regarding faith and religion. The lyrics say, \"How many people die and hurt in your name?/Hey does that make you proud, or does it bring you shame?\" Shakira affirms, \"I decided in the bridge of the song to include chants from different religions like Islam, Judaism and Christianity. And the three chanters are saying basically the same: they are asking for forgiveness,\" she said off the track. The first single, \"Don't Bother\", presents the final chapter of a relationship and the confusion that faces anyone in a break up. It includes the lyric lines, \"For you I'd give up all I own and move to a communist country/If you came with me, of course/And I'd file my nails so they don't hurt you.\" She quickly follows with: \"And after all I'm glad I am not your type/I promise you won't see me cry/So don't bother/I'll be fine, I'll be fine.\" For Shakira, \"I think 'Don't Bother' has a lot of pain in it as a song, but also a lot of humor and sarcasm. Yes, it is a way of exorcising all of these feelings, a form of catharsis, getting rid of all of those emotions that torture us women at some point in our lives.\"\n\n\"Illegal\" features a guitar solo by Mexican guitarist Carlos Santana, and features lyrics such as, \"You said you would love me until you died/And as far as I know you're still alive\", which were compared to Alanis Morissette's \"You Oughta Know\", according to Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic. \"I'd like to be the owner of the zipper on your jeans,\" she sings on the racy \"Hey You,\" which was compared to the works of American rock-band No Doubt, by Slant Magazine. Mariachi horns bump up against surf guitars in \"Animal City\", a don't-go-there warning against fame and fake friends; while bossa nova accents wind through \"Something\", one of only two tracks reprised from \"Fijación Oral\", being called \"En Tus Pupilas\" on the first edition. While \"The Day and the Time\" is on the first edition, with the title \"Dia Especial\". Meanwhile, gypsy-caravan violin and marauder guitar complete \"Your Embrace,\" a teardroppy, adult-contemporary balladry, whilst \"Costume Makes the Clown,\" talks about her cheating on her guy, over battering-ram guitars. Shakira also dives into pulsating neo-disco on the closing track \"Timor\", but in the form of a protest song.\n\nAt Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, \"Oral Fixation\" received an average score of 74 based on 15 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Stephen Thomas Erlewine of \"Allmusic\" gave the album a rating of 4 stars (out of 5), calling it \"a deadly serious, ambitious pop/rock album, most assuredly not frivolous dance-pop, [...] it's pop, but it's unconventional\". Erlewine also wrote that \"Oral Fixation\", \"is not only a markedly different album from \"Fijación Oral\", but from every other record in her catalog -- or, most importantly, from any other pop album in 2005.\" Matt Cibula of \"PopMatters\" agreed, writing that \"Oral Fixation\" is \"the best pop record of the year\". Alexis Petridis of \"The Guardian\" wrote that \"Oral Fixation is the sound of an utterly unique voice in a uniform world.\" Agustin Gurza of \"Los Angeles Times\" wrote the album \"is a stronger work as a whole, with sharper edges and darker undertones,\" praising its music, writing that \"this work stands on its own, squarely within the mainstream of U.S. pop and rock with a lot less Latin flavor.\"\n\nDavid Browne of \"Entertainment Weekly\" gave the album a \"B-\" rating, writing that, \"Although \"Oral Fixation\" is hardly the first time a Latina act has aimed straight for the middle of the North American road and nearly lost control of the wheel in the process, it's among the most disappointing. For all the musical ingredients at her disposal, Shakira winds up with a relatively bland dish.\" Sal Cinquemani of \"Slant Magazine\" wrote that the weakest part in some songs on the album are \"the main(stream) hook, an attempt at radio-accessibility that white-washes the personality that sets Shakira apart from her competition.\" Barry Walters of \"Rolling Stone\" acknowledged that, \"Occasionally clumsy but most often clever, Shakira's English lyrics and performances still lack the confidence of her Spanish tracks, yet Oral Fixation manages to maintain the musical credibility that Fijacion Oral won back.\" Edward Oculicz of \"Stylus Magazine\" concluded that, \"Oral Fixation Volume 2 strikes a good balance between the creative audacity of its more extreme songs, all of which work as good pop, and the filler, which is well crafted and catchy.\"\n\nIn the United States, \"Oral Fixation, Vol. 2\" debuted at number five on the \"Billboard\" 200 with first-week sales of 128,000 copies. After being reissued in 2006 with \"Hips Don't Lie\" and an alternate version of \"La Tortura\", the record moved from number ninety-eight to number six. With sales of 81,000 copies that week, it had experienced a 643% increase. By 2007, the album sold over 1.7 million units in the country. The album was certified Platinum by the RIAA in the United States. Shakira received 18 Platinum certifications for the sales of \"Oral Fixation, Vol. 2\" in the following countries: Canada, Mexico, Austria, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland, Argentina, Peru, Chile, India, Greece, United States, United Kingdom, and her home country, Colombia. \"Oral Fixation, Vol. 2\" was named the ninth best selling album of 2006 worldwide. Also it was the 23rd best selling album in the United States of 2006. After the performance of \"Hips Don't Lie\" at the 2006 MTV Video Music Awards, which featured Shakira dancing in an Indian outfit, the album topped India Charts and was certified Platinum selling 80,000 units. In April 2007 \"Oral Fixation, Vol. 2\" re-entered the UK Albums Chart at #70 the same week that \"Beautiful Liar\", Shakira's duet with Beyoncé, entered the singles charts at No. 10 solely through downloads. It later moved to #69. The album was also certified Platinum in the UK in April 2007.\n\nTo further promote \"Fijación Oral, Vol. 1\" and \"Oral Fixation, Vol. 2\", Shakira embarked on the Oral Fixation Tour. It was launched on 14 June 2006, at the Feria De Muestras in Zaragoza, Spain. With the assistance of the Creative Artists Agency, she visited ninety-four cities and performed forty-one shows across five continents. The tour concluded on 9 July 2007, at the Turkcell Kuruçeşme Arena in Istanbul, Turkey. It grossed over $42 million in North and Latin America, and grossed $100 million worldwide. The set list primarily consisted of Spanish-language tracks, and additionally included earlier singles from Shakira's albums \"Pies Descalzos\" (1996), \"Dónde Están los Ladrones?\" (1998), and \"Laundry Service\" (2001).\n\nIn November 2007, Epic Records released the \"Oral Fixation Tour\" live album, filmed during a show in Miami, Florida in December 2006. Robert Silva from About.com provided a positive review, describing the recording as a \"very entertaining and lively performance\"; he expressed an additional interest in the bonus behind-the-scenes footage. William Ruhlmann from Allmusic shared a similar sentiment, complimenting her vocals and dancing abilities.\n\nThe lead-single, \"Don't Bother\", was released on 4 October 2005. The song received mixed reviews from music critics, who were ambivalent towards its production and songwriting. Commercially, the song was a moderate success, reaching the top ten in Austria, Germany, Italy, Switzerland and UK, while it only peaked at number 42 in the US, reaching a lower peak than \"La Tortura\", the lead single of \"Fijación Oral\".\nAfter the moderate success of \"Don't Bother\" and of the album, her label Epic Records asked Wyclef Jean, in early 2006, to remake his song \"Dance Like This\" with Shakira, attempting to revive sales of the album. After that, \"Hips Don't Lie\" was released as the second single from the album (first from the reissue) on 28 February 2006. The song received positive reviews from critics, while it gained 6 awards. Commercially, the single proved to be more successful than \"Don't Bother\", peaking at number-one in more than 13 countries, including Australia, France, Ireland, UK and US, becoming her most successful single to date.\n\nThe third and final single, \"Illegal\", was released on 14 November 2006. The song received favorable reviews from music critics, due to the inclusion of Carlos Santana on it. However, the song didn't perform well on the charts, after the huge success of \"Hips Don't Lie\", only managing to peak inside the top-ten in Austria, Italy and Netherlands, while elsewhere it reached the top-forty, including the UK. In the US, the song didn't enter the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart.\n\nCredits adapted from the liner notes of \"Oral Fixation, Vol. 2\".\n\n\n! scope=\"row\"| India \n"}

Its first home was Down House in the village of Downe, Kent (now part of the London Borough of Bromley), which had been the home of Charles Darwin.\n\nBy 1921 Down House was too small for the school, so Willis bought The Cloisters, Cold Ash, Berkshire, to which the school moved in 1922, and where it remains. It now accepts day pupils but is still predominantly a boarding school.\n\nDowne House won \"Tatler\"s \"Best Public School\" award in 2011.\n\nAs most girls at Downe House are boarders, the house system is incorporated with the boarding programme. Every girl belongs to a mixed age house (AGN, AGS, Aisholt, Holcombe or Tedworth) throughout their time at the school. Students, however, only live in the mixed age houses from U4–U5 (Years 9–11).\n\nThe houses are:\n\n\nDowne House educates girls between the ages of eleven and eighteen, taking them from the last years of junior school through to the sixth form. Girls can join the school at the ages of eleven, twelve, or thirteen, on leaving a primary or prep school, or at sixteen after completing GCSEs. The biggest intake of girls is at 11+.\n\nEntry into Downe House is competitive, with entrants needing to pass the Common Entrance Examination.\n\nThe core subjects at Downe House are English, Mathematics and Science as well as Humanities, Classics and Social Sciences subjects and there are options such as Fine Arts, Foreign Languages and Business Studies.\n\nIn 2010, the Cambridge Pre-U was introduced as an alternative to A Levels at Downe House.\n\nFor the first two years, pupils are split between three lower school boarding houses: Hill, Hermitage and Darwin. They then move on to their mixed aged houses in their third year, the houses being AGS, AGN, Aisholt, Tedworth and Holcombe. The final two years of sixth form are spent in either Willis or York house, as the houses alternate between year groups. The five mixed age houses are used for inter-house competitions such as House Drama, House Music, House Dance and Sports Day.\n\nIn 2004, as reported by \"The Times\", Downe House was one of about sixty of the country's leading independent schools which were accused of running an unlawful price-fixing cartel, contrary to the Competition Act 1998, enabling them to drive up fees charged to thousands of parents. After an Inquiry later that year, in 2005 the school was ordered to pay a nominal penalty of £10,000, and with the other schools agreed to make \"ex-gratia\" payments totalling three million pounds into a trust to benefit pupils who attended the schools during the period in question. However, the Independent Schools Council said the investigation had been \"a scandalous waste of public money\". Jean Scott, its head, said that the schools had always been exempt from anti-cartel rules applied to business, were following a long-established procedure in sharing the information with each other, and had been unaware of a change to the law, on which they had not been consulted. She wrote to John Vickers, the Office of Fair Trading director-general, \"They are not a group of businessmen meeting behind closed doors to fix the price of their products to the disadvantage of the consumer. They are schools that have quite openly continued to follow a long-established practice because they were unaware that the law had changed.\"\n\n\n\n"}

The name stems from the age of the rocks in the basin where the school is located, which are from the geological period that preceded the largest mass extinction in the history of life. The Permian Basin is the source of the large oil and natural gas deposits that drive the region's economy. Permian High began adding freshmen to the campus during the 2015-2016 school year. This began creating more additions to the campus as well as a bigger influx of students.\n\nHigh school football has long been extremely popular in Texas. The story of Permian High School's 1988 Permian Panthers team and its run towards the state championship was the subject of the best-selling book \"\", published in 1990. A movie based on the book was made in 2004 and the NBC television network aired a TV series loosely based on the school and book. Roy Williams, formerly of the Detroit Lions, Dallas Cowboys, and Chicago Bears, went to school at Permian and portrayed an assistant coach for Midland Lee in the movie.\n\nThe team, whose rallying cry is \"Mojo\", won the Texas state championship in the 4A classification (the state's largest until 1980) in 1965 and 1972 and the 5A classification in 1980, 1984 (a co-championship with French High School, located in Beaumont, Texas the last time that a football co-championship was awarded by the UIL; it would later adopt NCAA overtime rules), 1989 and 1991. Permian was selected by National Sports News Service as the High School Football National co-Champions in 1972 and 1989.\n\n\"Mojo\" supposedly originated in 1967 when a group of Permian alumni met the team in Abilene Cooper for the game between the Panthers and Cougars. Legend has it that Permian's fans began chanting \"Go Joe\" for one of the Permian players. Other fans misheard this as \"Mojo\".\n\nPermian plays its home football games at Ratliff Stadium.\n\nPermian's arch rivals are the Odessa Bronchos and the Midland Lee Rebels.\n\nFounded by Charles Nail and currently directed by Todd Berridge, a former pupil under Nail, Satin Strings is a strolling strings ensemble of the Permian High School Orchestra. The members of the group \"stroll\" (carry their instruments while performing), including the cellists but not the bass players.\n\nSatin Strings is regularly asked to play at major state and national functions. In 1994, Satin Strings played at the D-Day celebrations in Normandy, France and this performance led to an invitation to play at the 1997 inauguration of US President Bill Clinton. The ensemble played for the inauguration of the governor of Chihuahua, Mexico in 1998. The group also performed at the 2001 and 2005 inaugurations of President George W. Bush. Satin Strings and director Berridge are featured on the May 4, 2013 episode of the syndicated television series \"Texas Country Reporter\", starring Bob Phillips.\n\nThe Permian Orchestra was founded in 1959 with the opening of Permian High School. Under the baton of J.R. McEntyre, the program quickly gained a reputation for excellence that has endured for half a century. The Symphony Orchestra has received consecutive sweepstakes at UIL Concert and Sightreading Contest for 41 years. The Chamber String Orchestra (Satin Strings) has received sweepstakes at UIL Concert and Sightreading contest for 25 years, every year since the founding of it. The Symphony, Philharmonic and Chamber String Orchestras have each achieved individual success at festivals across the nation. The groups have been named \"Best in Class\" and \"Outstanding Orchestra\" at competitions in Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Missouri, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas. The Permian Symphony Orchestra has been selected as the TMEA State Honor Orchestra twice, once in 1980 and again in 1984. The orchestra program has only had five directors in its history: J.R. McEntrye (1959–72), Charles Nail (1972–88), Kathy Fishburn (1988–99), David Golden (1999–2008), and Todd Berridge (2008–present).\n\n\n\n"}

The mills sent lumber to the growing city of San Francisco.\n\nThe town was founded in the 1870s. It featured two hotels, a general store, a saloon, a meat market, blacksmith, livery stable, and a notion shop.\n\nStarting in the 1870s, the narrow-gauge North Pacific Coast Railroad ran through Duncans Mills on its way from Cazadero, California to Sausalito. After being sold several times, the railroad ceased operation in the 1930s. The town slowly faded, until a 1976 restoration project, associated with the celebration of the U.S. Bicentennial, brought about a period of building restoration and business re-vitalization.\n\nToday, Duncans Mills resembles the way it was originally built. It has an authentic North Pacific Coast Railroad Depot and several original cars from the old railroad line. A California State Park Sector Office is located in one of the old railroad buildings as a California State Parks administrative office. The Blue Heron Restaurant has served as the destination entertainment center of the town for decades.\n\nDuncans Mills is located on the Russian River about from the Pacific Ocean.

She is best known for her work in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA), where she spent most of her career.\n\nBrookshaw grew up on a pig and chicken farm in St. Marys, Ontario. In 2000, she won the \"Toronto Sunshine Millennium Calendar\" contest which led to her being named \"Miss June 2000\" and interviewed in the \"Toronto Sun\". Brookshaw went on to engage in promotional modeling work with the Molson, Labatt and Budweiser beverage brewers.\n\nIn her interview, Brookshaw said that she aspired to be \"the next WWF Superstar\". This led to her being introduced to Ron Hutchison, a professional wrestler who operated the Sully's Gym professional wrestling school out of Toronto, Ontario. Brookshaw began training under Hutchinson in March 2000 and debuted in January 2001 as \"Tracy Brooks\".\n\nBrooks appeared with numerous independent promotions, including Border City Wrestling and the Apocalypse Wrestling Federation (AWF). During her time in AWF, she worked a program feuding with La Felina and was managed for a short time by Canadian hip-hop artist, Dan-e-o. On August 30, 2001, Brookshaw (as Miss Apocalypse) defeated Joey Knight to win the AWF heavyweight title. To this day, she continues to do work for independent promotions, including Blood Sweat and Ears in her home region in Southern Ontario and, most prominently, NWA Cyberspace where she contends for the NWA Cyberspace Women's Championship.\n\nTraci even wrestled in independent custom wrestling matches against wrestlers like Amber O'Neal and Christie Ricci.\n\nBrooks debuted in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling on April 30, 2003 in Catholic schoolgirl apparel, attacking Lollipop, a dancer who entertained the live audience during intermissions. The following week, Brooks demanded to be entered in a gauntlet match in which the winner would receive a shot at the NWA World Heavyweight Championship, threatening to sue National Wrestling Alliance official Bill Behrens for sexual discrimination if he did not comply. When her threats failed, Brooks instead attempted to charm Behrens into allowing her into the match. Behrens then placed Brooks in a triple threat match with fellow female wrestlers Desire and Trinity, with the winner gaining entry into the gauntlet match. After Kid Kash ambushed Trinity and David Young accidentally punched Desire, Brooks won the match. Later that evening, she was attacked by Lollipop as she approached the ring to enter the gauntlet match. After she entered the ring, Brooks was quickly pinned and eliminated by Kid Kash.\n\nOn May 21, Brooks was paired with David Young in an \"Anarchy Alliance\" tag team tournament to determine the number one contenders to the NWA World Tag Team Championship. They defeated Kid Kash and Trinity on May 21 and Ron Killings (whose partner, Don Harris, had refused to team with him) on June 4. During the match, Brooks was injured by Killings. Nurse Veronica (who had recently debuted in an on-air role as TNA's backstage clinician) rushed to the ring to aid Brooks. During this time, Brooks was also involved in catfights with Young's valet, Desire. Brooks and Young then faced America's Most Wanted in the tournament final, but lost. After the match, Young threatened Brooks, but she was again saved by Veronica.\nDuring an interview with Goldy Locks, Brooks and Veronica announced that TNA officials would no longer allow women to compete against men; however, they would continue to work together as a stable named \"Bitchslap\". The duo then issued an open challenge to any women in attendance. TNA cage dancers April Pennington and Lollipop (who was attacked by Brooks several weeks earlier) accepted the challenge. They tried attacking Brooks and Veronica but were stopped by TNA security guards. The following week, Lollipop challenged Bitchslap to a match. Veronica (without Brooks present) accepted, but was attacked by both Lollipop and Pennington until TNA security again stopped the catfight. Veronica then replaced Brooks with a new partner, Cheerleader Valentina (who had earlier competed as JV Love on \"TNA Xplosion\" in a match against Brooks). The reason for the replacement is because Brooks was unable to travel from Canada to the TNA taping. The storyline with Bitchslap was eventually dropped because TNA didn't have enough female wrestlers to compete against the group, and Veronica turned down a two-year contract with TNA, instead attempting to sign with either WWE or a company in Japan. Brooks was removed from television for repackaging, Trinity was placed into other storylines, and TNA stopped booking Valentina.\n\nBrooks returned to TNA on November 5, 2003, helping Shane Douglas defeat The Sandman. On November 26, Douglas and Brooks, known now simply as \"Traci\", helped Michael Shane defeat Sonjay Dutt. Following the match, the trio celebrated, and Douglas announced that they were to be called \"The New Franchise\".\nThe New Franchise began feuding with Triple X (Christopher Daniels, Low Ki and Elix Skipper). The feud lasted until April 21, 2004, when Shane lost to Daniels after he passed up on a pinfall opportunity in order to try to hit his finisher. After Douglas admonished Shane, Shane began pushing and slapping his erstwhile mentor. Traci eventually grabbed Douglas from behind, enabling Shane to superkick Douglas. The following week, Traci helped Shane defeat Douglas in a singles match.\n\nTraci continued to manage Shane, who was by now pursuing the X Division Championship. Shane proved unable to defeat the incumbent champion, A.J. Styles, so he and Traci recruited Frankie Kazarian in order to maximize their numbers advantage. The result was a new stable/tag team that was known by fans as Shazarian. After several weeks of confrontations, Styles defended his title against Shane and Kazarian in a three way Ultimate X match on July 28, 2004. Though he was able to nullify the interference of Traci by giving her a Styles Clash, he was eventually knocked unconscious by the combined efforts of Shane and Kazarian. Shane and Kazarian then climbed for the X Division Championship, and simultaneously retrieved the belt, thus becoming co-champions. They lost the titles to Petey Williams in a Gauntlet Match on August 11.\n\nIn late 2004, Traci turned into a fan favorite by leaving Shane and Kazarian and becoming the assistant of the TNA Director of Authority, Dusty Rhodes. Trinity also wanted to be Rhodes' assistant, however, so he told each woman to recruit a new tag team. The teams faced one another at Destination X on March 13, 2005, with the winning team's manager becoming Rhodes' sole assistant. Traci's team (Don and Ron Harris, the Disciples of Destruction) defeated Trinity's team (Big Tilly and Bruno Sassi - Phi Delta Slam), making her Rhodes' assistant. Traci eventually left Rhodes' side and began managing Chris Sabin, who was feuding with Michael Shane and Trinity. At Lockdown on April 24, she tried to prevent Trinity from interfering in a four way X Division Xscape elimination match between Sabin, Sonjay Dutt, Shocker and Shane, but failed. The feud continued until Hard Justice on May 15, when Sabin and Traci lost to Shane and Trinity. In the course of the match, Traci turned on Sabin and Shane turned on Trinity, with Traci aligning herself with Shane once again and Trinity siding with Sabin.\n\nTraci began managing Shane once again and stayed with him when he changed his name to his real name, Matt Bentley. When Bentley sat out during contract renegotiations in August 2005, she did some interview work for TNA. At Unbreakable on September 11, Traci acted as a backstage interviewer throughout the event. She returned to Bentley's side after his return at Unbreakable. In February 2006, Bentley turned heel and began a dispute with longtime tag partner Lance Hoyt. Following the feud, Bentley was sidelined with an injury. Traci did promotional work for the company during the downtime.\n\nOn the May 15 taping of \"Impact!\", she wrestled Gail Kim in the first woman's match in over a year. The match was taped purely for the forthcoming TNA Knockouts DVD, not for the Spike TV program. Kim gained the pin after interference from America's Most Wanted. At Hardcore War she defeated Kim with Christy Hemme as referee.\n\nTraci was announced as Robert Roode's manager at Bound for Glory 2006 and changed her name to \"Ms. Brooks,\" thus becoming a villain. She managed him during the Fight for the Right Tournament at the October 28 \"Impact!\". She lost to Eric Young in a bikini contest at Turning Point. After this, she was told to sign Young to a contract- no matter what it took to do it. In the storyline, Ms. Brooks began to pressure him into having sex with her. Finally, at Against All Odds Ms. Brooks successfully seduced Young into signing a contract with \"Robert Roode Inc.\". After sometime without a storyline, she entered a rivalry with Gail Kim and was defeated at an \"Impact!\" taping. At Slammiversary, she was taken out by Kim once again.\n\nOn the August 23, 2007 episode of \"Impact!\", Roode wrestled Gail Kim, with Kim pinning Roode after a low blow leg drop. Following the match, Roode, unhappy at his loss, continued to attack Kim until Kaz came out to counter Roode. On the September 27 edition of \"Impact\". Tracy competed in 5-way match in losing effort to Roxxi Laveau. On the October 4 edition of \"Impact!\", it was revealed that Brooks and Roode were not romantically linked, and that the only reason she continued to take Roode's abuse was to help her sick mother. Subsequently, on \"Impact!\" and at Genesis a female fan held up signs asking Roode to replace Ms. Brooks with her. Roode then joined the Angle Alliance with Ms. Brooks begrudgingly by his side. At the Genesis pay-per-view on November 11, 2007, Traci fainted due to heat exhaustion, but appeared to be doing fine following help from medics. However, news reports have arisen that claim that her fainting was staged, as Brooks was asked to do so by Vince Russo. At the January 10 \"Impact!\" tapings, Roode fired Ms. Brooks and replaced her with the female fan, identified by Roode as Ms. Payton Banks. Shortly thereafter, Brookshaw reverted to a crowd favorite and to her \"'Traci Brooks\" ring name and began feuding with Banks. She defeated Banks at the annual pay-per-view, Against All Odds. On the April 3 edition of \"Impact!\", Traci defeated Payton Banks after a facebuster from the top turnbuckle. At Lockdown, She participated in the first ever \"Queen of the Cage\" match which was won by Roxxi Laveaux. At Sacrifice, Traci participated in the first ever TNA Knockout Makeover Battle Royal, which was won by Gail Kim.\n\nDuring the July 17 edition of \"Impact!\" a backstage segment revealed that Brooks was in talks with Jim Cornette about something concerning the Knockouts. Soon after on the August 7 episode of \"Impact!\", Brooks was the special guest referee for a match between Roxxi and Jacqueline, which Roxxi won. In August 2008, Cornette announced that Traci officially is in charge of the Knockouts Division, known as the \"Knockout Law\". In January 2009, Traci stopped appearing in TNA and Jim Cornette resumed control over the Knockout division. She returned on the March 12, 2009, edition of \"Impact!\" as a referee.\n\nTraci returned to television on the July 23, 2009 episode of \"Impact!\". During an interview with Lauren, she announced that had taken time off TNA to work on some projects in Hollywood and she was returning as the referee for a Knockout battle royal later that evening. The winner of the battle royal would receive $50,000 and spot in The Main Event Mafia. As the match wound down to Tara and Awesome Kong as the final two participants, Brooks revealed that she was actually a participant in the match and tossed both women out of the ring. Upon winning the match, Traci turned villainous and became a member of the Main Event Mafia. On the following Impact, Traci cemented herself as a villainess during an interview with Lauren in which she denounced TNA for not giving her a spot on television, explaining her absence. On August 27 episode of \"Impact\", Traci competed in the TNA Knockout Tag Title tournament teaming with Sharmell to represent The Main Event Mafia, but they lost in the first round of the tournament to Awesome Kong and Raisha Saeed. On the October 1 edition of \"Impact!\", Traci was defeated by Christy Hemme in a \"Battle of the Playboy Models\" match. After the match, the villainous Traci attacked Christy. The following episode of \"Impact\", Brooks teamed up with Alissa Flash and The Beautiful People (Velvet Sky and Madison Rayne) to defeat Taylor Wilde, Sarita, Hemme and Hamada in an elimination match.\n\nOn the October 22 edition of \"Impact!\" the Main Event Mafia disbanded. On the November 12 episode of \"Impact\", Traci began a rivalry with the villainous Alissa Flash when she attacked Flash after losing to her in a singles match. On the November 19 episode of \"Impact\", Traci attacked Flash after she lost to Sarita, In the process, Traci cemented herself as a face. On the November 26 edition of \"Impact!\", Traci competed in a number 1 contenders battle royal to face ODB for the Knockouts Championship at Final Resolution but failed to win after being eliminated by Wilde and Sarita. On March 4, 2010, Brookshaw was released from her contract.\n\nOn February 14, 2011, at the tapings of the February 17 edition of \"Impact!\", Brooks made a one night return to TNA, saving her real life husband Kazarian from Robbie E and Cookie. On April 7, Brooks wrestled at TNA house show in Erie, Pennsylvania, unsuccessfully challenging Madison Rayne for the TNA Women's Knockout Championship. Two days later Brooks defeated Rayne in a non-title match at a house show in Cleveland Ohio. On the July 21 edition of \"Impact Wrestling\", Brooks made her return to TNA, saving Velvet Sky and Mickie James from ODB and Jacqueline. On the August 18 edition of \"Impact Wrestling\", Brooks re-applied for the job of \"Knockout Law\". However, on the September 1 edition of \"Impact Wrestling\", the job was given to Karen Jarrett, who then hired Brooks as her executive assistant. On the December 8 edition of \"Impact Wrestling\", Brooks returned to the ring to face Jarrett's ally Gail Kim. Despite being told to lay down, Brooks decided to fight back, but eventually lost following interference from Madison Rayne. After Karen Jarrett was fired from TNA on the December 15 edition of \"Impact Wrestling\", Brooks began wrestling more regularly, feuding with Madison Rayne. On the January 5, 2012, edition of \"Impact Wrestling\", Brooks and Mickie James failed to capture the TNA Knockouts Tag Team Championship from Rayne and Gail Kim. This turned out to be Brooks's Final match in TNA. After months of inactivity, Brooks announced on April 17, that she had been released from TNA.\n\nBrooks made her debut for Women Superstars Uncensored, on November 28, 2008, defeating Annie Social in singles competition. On the March 6, 2010, where she lost to April Hunter, following the match, Traci saved Hunter from an attack from The Boston Shore. On the April 10 episode of \"WSU\", Traci unsuccessfully challenged Brittany Savage for WSU Spirit Championship.\n\nOn July 18, 2015, Brooks made her final professional wrestling appearance for House of Hardcore (HOH), managing Frankie Kazarian and Christopher Daniels to a win over The Kingdom (Matt Taven and Michael Bennett).\n\nOn July 26, 2009, it was revealed that TNA had signed a deal with \"Playboy\" making Brooks the first TNA Knockout to ever pose for \"Playboy\". On September 2 it was reported that \"Playboy\" had decided not to publish Brooks' photo shoot in the magazine. The photo shoot was instead released through their Cyber Club on September 17, 2009.\n\nBrookshaw married fellow TNA wrestler Frank Gerdelman, better known as Frankie Kazarian, on January 7, 2010; they started dating in 2006 when she acted as his manager. In October/November 2012, Brookshaw and Gerdelman welcomed their first child, a son, which she confirmed on Twitter in early July 2013.\n\nIn an October 2008 interview with the \"Chicago Sun-Times\", Brookshaw revealed that she suffered from Erb's palsy as an infant as a side-effect of her birth. While she recovered for the most part, due to aggressive treatment, she noted that she has impaired function in her right arm which affected her in the ring. She has said that \"I don't have a biceps or a triceps. I have a uniceps.\"\n\n\n\n"}

The Greek Orthodox Monastery (Convent) of the Theotokos, the Life-Giving Spring is also located there. Prior to the acquisition of the land by the ranch and the monastery, the land was known as the Sally K Ranch with two of the old ranch dwellings now being occupied by the ranch manager and assigned clergy. On the ranch property itself, there is an old barn, totally constructed of redwood, with a chapel inside (on the second floor). Referred to as \"The Barn Church\" or \"St. Nicolas Chapel\" by locals, the chapel has a minimalist design, and is home to a colony of bats. The extremely large barn itself was built in 1891 to house livestock, with the chapel being a much more recent addition. In the late 1800s the large barn was also used to store ice for the city of Fresno; the ice was cut in the winter, reportedly at nearby Hume Lake, and then the large blocks were moved to the barn.

She came from a well-to-do background, being the daughter of Laurence Harvey. Harvey's fame was increased posthumously by the 2005 release of the film \"Domino\", which was loosely based on her life, in which Harvey was portrayed by Keira Knightley.\n\nHarvey was born on 7 August 1969 in Hammersmith, London to the actor Laurence Harvey and fashion model Paulene Stone. Laurence Harvey was married to Joan Cohn until 1972; he married Stone shortly after divorcing Cohn. After Laurence Harvey died of cancer in 1973, Stone raised Domino in Belgravia, an upmarket area of London. As a girl, Harvey was a tomboy and enjoyed playing with action figures. She later recalled that she studied martial arts and frequently fought other children. She attended four boarding schools, including Dartington Hall and Frensham Heights, and was expelled from some of them.\n\nHarvey dropped out of school as a teenager to pursue a career in modelling, but did not enjoy it. She later claimed to have attended the Lee Strasberg Institute and been represented by the Ford Modeling Agency; in a 2005 article, Aida Edemariam of \"The Guardian\" noted that she was unable to verify these claims independently, no-one having any recollection of Harvey. Harvey studied sound engineering and worked as a DJ at several clubs in London, managing one of them. Around that time, she lived in Notting Hill and also designed and sold T-shirts at Kensington Market, London. At age 19, after spending time in Israel, Harvey moved to Southern California, where her mother had relocated years earlier after marrying the American businessman Peter Morton. Harvey had previously resisted the idea of moving to the United States.\n\nIn California, Harvey initially worked as a DJ at clubs in Los Angeles. She then worked on a ranch near San Diego, and served as a volunteer firefighter in Boulevard, California. At that time, her friends trained her in the use of firearms. After serving as a volunteer firefighter for a year, Harvey trained as an EMT and took courses in fire science. In 1993, she unsuccessfully applied to the Los Angeles Fire Department, and then enrolled in a short course to become a bail recovery agent, or bounty hunter.\n\nAfter completing a bail recovery agent training course, Harvey began working with the teacher of the course, Ed Martinez, at a bail bond agency in South Los Angeles run by Celes King III. As one of very few women working as bounty hunters in the United States, she primarily sought drug dealers and thieves, but occasionally tracked murderers. She enjoyed the work and Martinez later said she was one of the most skilled bounty hunters he knew. She primarily worked with two other bounty hunters when tracking fugitives. During their operations, she occasionally posed as a lost tourist.\n\nHarvey collected swords and knives, and kept AK-47s in her apartment. As a bounty hunter in the mid-1990s, Harvey earned roughly $30,000–40,000 annually. The agency where Harvey worked was paid 10% of the bail posted by each fugitive they caught. She said she chose bounty hunting for the excitement of the work, even though it was not a high-paying job. She typically worked in Southern California, but on one occasion travelled across the United States to Atlanta, Georgia, to seek one of the FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives.\n\nHarvey lived above the garage of her mother's home in Beverly Hills, California. After she began working as a bounty hunter, the \"Daily Mail\" published an article about her. Director Tony Scott read the article and contacted Harvey. They soon became friends and regularly visited each other; Scott spent time observing her while she tracked fugitives. Their friendship lasted for the rest of her life.\n\nHarvey entered drug rehabilitation clinics four times; each stay was funded by her mother. Scott claims that Harvey and the bounty hunters with whom she worked would often keep drugs they found when arresting criminals. Martinez has said that they used marijuana, cocaine, and heroin. In 1997, Harvey travelled to a drug rehabilitation clinic in Hawaii. She lived in Hawaii for two years. In 2001, having returned to California, she attempted to become a bounty hunter again but was unable to find work with her previous employer.\n\nIn 2003, Harvey was arrested on charges of possession of crystal methamphetamine after sheriff's deputies found the drug at her home while investigating a burglar alarm call-out. She pleaded guilty and attended a treatment programme; the arrest was consequently removed from her criminal record. In May 2005, Harvey was arrested on federal charges of trafficking methamphetamine; she maintained that she was innocent. She spent three weeks in the Metropolitan Detention Center, Los Angeles. She posted $1 million bail and was placed under house arrest, staying at her home in West Hollywood. While under house arrest, Harvey wore an electronic monitoring ankle bracelet.\n\nHarvey continually denied that she was a drug trafficker, claiming to have been set up. While under house arrest, she lived with a person whom she had hired as a \"sober guardian\" to help her refrain from drug use. On the night of 27 June 2005 her aide discovered her unconscious in her bath. She was taken to a hospital but could not be resuscitated. The Los Angeles County Department of Medical Examiner-Coroner determined that she had overdosed on the painkiller drug fentanyl.\n\nA film inspired by her life, \"Domino\", was released in October 2005. In his preparations for the film, director Tony Scott taped hours of conversations he had with Harvey about bounty hunting incidents. During filming, Harvey spent three weeks on the set. There have been tabloid reports that the ending was changed after her death and also that she was unhappy with the film's portrayal of her. The film studio has countered that she was involved with the project for nearly 12 years. Promotional featurettes for the movie include Harvey on set with the cast and crew; she contributed to the soundtrack and also attended the movie's wrap party in December 2004. Harvey herself appears at the very end of the cast credits of the film. She did not live to see it released.\n\n"}

It is the highest football league in Denmark and is currently contested by 14 teams each year, with 1–3 teams relegated.\n\nFounded in 1991, the Danish Superliga replaced the Danish 1st Division as the highest league of football in Denmark. From the start in 1991, 10 teams were participating. The opening Superliga season was played during the spring of 1991, with the ten teams playing each other twice for the championship title. From the summer of 1991, the tournament structure would stretch over two calendar years. The 10 teams would play each other twice in the first half of the tournament. In the following spring, the bottom two teams would be cut off, the points of the teams would be cut in half, and the remaining eight teams would once more play each other twice, for a total of 32 games in a season.\n\nThis practice was abandoned before the 1995–96 season, when the number of teams competing was increased to 12, playing each other thrice for 33 games per Superliga season. For the first season of this new structure, Coca-Cola became the name sponsor of the league, which was then named \"Coca-Cola Ligaen\". After a single season under that name, Faxe Brewery became sponsors and the league changed its name to \"Faxe Kondi Ligaen\". Before the 2001–02 season, Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) became the head sponsor, and the name of the tournament changed to \"SAS Ligaen\". From January 2015 the Danish Superliga is known as \"Alka Superliga\", as the Danish insurance company Alka became name sponsor.\n\nLogos used for naming rights agreements for the league:\nFrom 1996 through 2016, the league included 12 clubs which played each other three times. The two teams with the fewest points at the end of the season were relegated to the Danish 1st Division and replaced by the top two teams of that division. During this era, each team played every other team at least once at home and once away plus once more either at home or away. The top six teams of the previous season played 17 matches at home and 16 away while the teams in 7th to 10th place plus the two newly promoted teams played 16 matches at home and 17 away.\n\nFollowing the 2015–16 season, the league was expanded to 14 teams, accomplished by relegating only the last-place finisher in that season and promoting the top three teams from the 1st division. The 2016–17 season was the first for the new league structure. It began with the teams playing a full home-and-away schedule, resulting in 26 matches for each team. At that time, the league split into a six-team championship playoff and an eight-team qualifying playoff. All teams' table points and goals carry over fully into the playoffs.\n\nIn the championship playoff, each team plays the others home and away again. The top team at the end of the playoff is Superliga champion and enters the Champions League in the second qualifying round. The second-place team enters the Europa League in the first qualifying round. The third-place team advances to a one-off playoff match for another Europa League place. If the winner of the Danish Cup finishes in the top three, the match will instead involve the fourth-place team.\n\nThe qualifying playoff is split into two groups, with the teams that finished the regular season in 7th, 10th, 11th, and 14th in one group and those finishing 8th, 9th, 12th, and 13th in the other. Each group plays home-and-away within its group. The top two teams from each group then enter a knockout tournament, with each match over two legs. If the Danish Cup winner is among the top two finishers in either playoff group, it is withdrawn from the knockout playoff and its opponent automatically advances to the tournament final. The winner of that tournament faces the third-place (or fourth-place) team from the championship playoff in a one-off match, with the winner entering the Europa League in the first qualifying round.\n\nThe bottom two teams from each group then contest a relegation playoff with several steps, centered on a separate four-team knockout playoff, also consisting totally of two-legged matches:\n\nThe 10 most scoring players throughout the history of the Superliga.

In Hinduism, the story of Ajamila is used to illustrate that by uttering God’s divine name, there is hope for even the sinful to be redeemed from their propensity to commit sins.\n\nAjamila was raised according to the Vedic regulations. He was a perfectly trained Brahmin and had a beautiful wife. \n\nBut one day, while he was out in the fields collecting flowers for worshipping the Lord, he happened to see a drunken sudra and a prostitute engaged in sexual embrace. Ajamila became bewildered and attracted; his mind becoming more and more attached to the prostitute. Although Ajamila was a strict Brahmin he became helplessly entangled by seeing a man and woman engaged in sexual activity. Consequently he took this prostitute into his home as a maidservant. Inevitably, he became so entangled that he abandoned his family, wife and children and went off with the prostitute. Due to his illicit connection with the prostitute, he lost all his good qualities. He completely forgot his values, and indulged in sinful life.\n\nAs a result, he had children with \"then-prostitute\" and in serving his woman and children, he neglected devoting time to the God. But, due to his past moral values and devotion to the God, Ajamila was capable of seeing Yamadutas - the servants of Lord Yama (the god of death in Hinduism), when they arrived to take out his soul. He was so into his family, that even in his death bed, he called out to his son, whose name was Narayana, instead of praying to God. (Narayana is another name of Lord Krishna). Lord Krishna appeared at that instant and took Ajamila with him, cleansing him off his sins in his life. Although Ajamila did not devote his life to prayer, he was purified from all his sins because at the last moment he chanted the holy name of Krishna, Narayana.\n\nThe story promises that the Lord is waiting for man to call for him. Even an innocent utterance of His name is enough for Him to lend helping hands to man.\n\nMarkandeya\n\n"}

It is related to the Greek verb \"kērússō\", literally meaning \"to cry or proclaim as a herald\" and being used in the sense of \"to proclaim, announce, preach\". Amongst biblical scholars, the term has come to mean the core of the early church's oral tradition about Jesus.\n\n\"Kerygmatic\" is sometimes used to express the message of Jesus' whole ministry, as \"a proclamation addressed not to the theoretical reason, but to the hearer as a self\"; as opposed to the didactic use of Scripture that seeks understanding in the light of what is taught. The meaning of the crucifixion is central to this concept.\n\nIn the 4th century, the kerygma will be formally published in the Nicene Creed. \n\nDuring the mid-20th century, when the literary genre of the New Testament gospels was under debate, scholars like C. H. Dodd and Rudolf Bultmann suggested that the gospels were of a genre unique in the ancient world. They called the genre \"kerygma\" and described it as a later development of preaching that had taken a literary form.

A bigger animal has proportionately less of its body close to the outside environment than a smaller animal of otherwise similar shape, and so it gains heat from, or loses heat to, the environment much more slowly.\n\nThe phenomenon is important in the biology of ectothermic megafauna, such as large turtles, and aquatic reptiles like ichthyosaurs and mosasaurs. Gigantotherms, though almost always ectothermic, generally have a body temperature similar to that of endotherms. It has been suggested that the larger dinosaurs would have been gigantothermic, rendering them virtually homeothermic.\n\nGigantothermy allows animals to maintain body temperature, but is most likely detrimental to endurance and muscle power as compared with endotherms due to decreased anaerobic efficiency. Mammals' bodies have roughly four times as much surface area occupied by mitochondria as reptiles, necessitating larger energy demands, and consequently producing more heat to use in thermoregulation. An ectotherm the same size of an endotherm would not be able to remain as active as the endotherm, as heat is modulated behaviorally rather than biochemically. More time is dedicated to basking than eating.\n\nLarge ectotherms displaying the same body size as large endotherms have the advantage of a slow metabolic rate, meaning that it takes reptiles longer to digest their food. Subsequently gigantothermic ectotherms would not have to eat as often as large endotherms that need to maintain a constant influx of food to meet energy demands. Although lions are much smaller than crocodiles, the lions must eat more often than crocodiles because of the higher metabolic output necessary to maintain the lion's heat and energy. The crocodile needs only to lie in the sun to digest more quickly and create ATP.\n\n\n"}

One live bonus track was added for the 2005 re-release.\n\nThe album front cover, photographed by Paul Brierley, shows a Lichtenberg figure. The image was described by journalist Geoff Barton in \"Sounds\": \"It's actually a frozen-in-action shot of an electrical discharge from a real Van de Graaff generator machine, set in acrylic.\"\n\nGeoff Barton of \"Sounds\" wrote: \"Where \"Still Life\" scores over past LPs is in its precise and accurate reproduction of leader Hammill's vocals.

Here, however, every subtle nuance of the 'chords has been captured successfully, providing greater variation, an abundance of light and shade.. \"Still Life\" is an essential album.

An advocate of polyamory, she is credited with coining the word. With her husband Oberon Zell-Ravenheart she designed deity images.\n\nMorning Glory was born as Diana Moore in 1948 in Long Beach, California. She was raised an only child in a strict Christian household by her Pentecostal mother, though she switched from attending a Methodist church to a Pentecostal one around age 10–12. At age 14 she broke with Christianity after arguing with her Methodist minister grandfather that animals had souls and went to heaven. She was strongly influenced by the Sybil Leek book, \"Diary of a Witch\", which she read during high school. At the age of 17, Diana began practicing witchcraft. At the age of 20 she changed her name to Morning Glory because she did not care for the chastity requirement demanded of followers of the goddess Diana.\n\nWhile en route to join a commune near Eugene, Oregon, in 1969, Morning Glory met a hitchhiker named Gary Ferns who joined her. The two were soon married, and the next year she gave birth to a daughter whom she named Rainbow. As a mother she was known as Morning Glory Ferns. Although Gary and Morning Glory conducted an open marriage, the union was broken when she met Timothy Zell after he gave the 1973 keynote speech at Gnosticon in Minnesota. Morning Glory divorced Gary and brought her daughter to St. Louis, Missouri, to live with Zell. Morning Glory and Zell married at the Gnosticon of Easter 1974, the well-attended ceremony performed by Archdruid Isaac Bonewits and High Priestess Carolyn Clark.\n\nIn St. Louis, Morning Glory studied and was made a priestess of Zell's Church of All Worlds. She helped him edit the group's journal, \"Green Egg\". In 1976 the two began almost a decade of traveling, adventure, and living in various retreats and in a school bus they converted to a mobile home. They founded the Ecosophical Research Association in 1977 at Coeden Brith, a ranch in rural Mendocino County, California, northwest of Ukiah, to investigate arcane lore and legends of cryptids such as Bigfoot and mermaids. Their wandering years ended in 1985 when they took up permanent residence at Coeden Brith, initially for the purpose of raising \"unicorns\" created from horn surgery on baby goats, which they did.\n\nIn 1979 Timothy Zell changed his first name to Otter, and for a short time the couple styled their surnames as G'Zell, a contraction of Glory Zell. In 1994 he changed his name to Oberon.\n\nFor Morning Glory, the ideal marriage had always been an open one, and her relationship with Zell developed into a polyamorous one made up of three people from 1984 to 1994, including Diane Darling. When this arrangement ended, Zell and Morning Glory bonded with others to make a marriage of five and sometimes six. The group took the collective surname Zell-Ravenheart, and lived in two large homes. Morning Glory's May 1990 article \"A Bouquet of Lovers\", first published in \"Green Egg\", promoted the concept of a group marriage having more than two partners. The article is widely cited as the original source of the word \"polyamory\", although the word does not appear in the article—the hyphenated form \"poly-amorous\" does instead.\n\nWith Darling, Morning Glory revived \"Green Egg\" in May 1988. The journal had been defunct since 1976. In 1990, she established the business Mythic Images, offering for sale reproductions of goddess and mythology sculptures crafted by Zell. Morning Glory ran the business in addition to lecturing and writing.\n\nIn 1999, the Zell-Ravenhearts moved to Sonoma County, California, where Oberon started the Grey School of Wizardry, which as of 2014 is the world's only registered wizard academy.\n\nMorning Glory went to the hospital in 2005 to treat broken bones suffered in a fall. There, she learned she had multiple myeloma. She received surgery, chemotherapy and radiation treatments, and also entreated her friends to form a healing circle. She experienced a great increase in health in 2007. She lapsed in taking her medications in late 2011, and the disease returned in early 2012. During a period of remission in August 2012 she was filmed for a documentary about polyamory for the Destination America television channel, the show called \"Hidden in America\", the segment titled \"Polyamory in America\".\n\nHer husband Oberon and his long term marriage partner Julie O'Ryan appeared together on screen to talk about their practice of polyamory. In reporting about the upcoming broadcast, Alan M of \"Polyamory in the News\" wrote that Morning Glory and Oberon, both battling cancer, looked \"hale and hearty\" in the preview available online.\n\nIn adolescence, her daughter Rainbow left to live with her father Gary, taking the name Gail.\n\nMorning Glory Zell-Ravenheart died at her home on May 13, 2014, two weeks before her 66th birthday, after a long battle with cancer.\n\n\n"}

The medal was instituted by King George VI on 23 June 1939.\n\nThe Union of South Africa King's Medal for Bravery, Gold, the senior of two classes of South Africa's highest civilian decoration for bravery, was instituted by Royal Warrant of 23 June 1939, published in Government Gazette no. 2671 dated 25 August 1939, and amended by Royal Warrants of 18 February 1947, 24 October 1949 and 17 October 1950.\n\nThe medal is unique insofar, at the time it was instituted, there was no equivalent British award. It predated the institution of the George Cross and George Medal in 1940 and, since South Africans were not eligible for the award of these latter two decorations, the Union of South Africa King's Medal for Bravery, Gold was not superseded by them.\n\nThe medal was awarded to recognise great and exceptional gallantry performed in the face of imminent and obvious peril by residents of the Union of South Africa or its dependent territories who endangered their lives in the act of saving, or endeavouring to save, the lives of others.\n\nIn the British order of precedence, the Union of South Africa King's Medal for Bravery, Gold ranks as a second level decoration, equivalent to the George Medal. It is preceded by the Venerable Order of Saint John and succeeded by the Distinguished Conduct Medal.\n\nIn South Africa, the medal is ranked as a first level decoration but, despite its status, it has no post-nominal letters. It is preceded by the Honoris Crux Gold and succeeded by the Woltemade Cross for Bravery, Gold.\n\nThe decoration is silver-gilt and is a disk, 38 millimetres in diameter with a raised rim and a large ring suspender. The obverse depicts the crowned effigy of King George VI, facing left, surrounded by the words \"GEORGIVS VI REX ET IMPERATOR\" around the upper perimeter.\n\nA public competition was held to find a suitable design for the reverse of the medal. The winning entry, by Miss Renee Joubert, depicts the 18th-century Cape hero Wolraad Woltemade on his horse, rescuing shipwreck survivors from a stormy sea. As a result, the medal became commonly referred to as the \"Woltemade Medal\". The image is circumscribed with the words \"FOR BRAVERY • VIR DAPPERHEID\" around the top.\n\nThe ribbon is 44 millimetres wide and dark blue with 4½ millimetres wide orange edges.\n\nUpon the accession to the British Throne of Queen Elizabeth II on 15 December 1952, the Union of South Africa King's Medal for Bravery, Gold was discontinued and replaced by the Union of South Africa Queen's Medal for Bravery, Gold.\n\nThe Union of South Africa King's Medal for Bravery, Gold was awarded only once, on 8 September 1944 to Master Francis C. Drake. Drake was fourteen years old on 6 January 1943 when he rescued the two-year-old Neville Roberts from a 40 feet deep well with deep water into which he had fallen at Parys in the Orange Free State.\n"}

A version by Johnnie Ray hit #14. A rendition by Enoch Light was featured prominently on Command Records' \"Provocative Percussion\" as well as the \"Command test record\".\n\nA live recording (from Carnegie Hall in 1954) by Ella Fitzgerald can be found on the Verve/Polygram release \"Jazz at the Philharmonic, the Ella Fitzgerald Set\", with Ray Brown on bass and Buddy Rich on drums.\n\nThere are at least 15 Finnish versions by different artists of the song, the first and most popular by Olavi Virta, in 1956.\n\nIt has also been covered by David Clayton-Thomas, and is often played by breakbeat DJs. The R&B singer Debelah Morgan sampled it (with different lyrics and a new middle section) on her international pop hit \"Dance With Me\" released in 2000. The instrumental section of The Johnston Brothers' 1955 recording (a No. 1 UK hit that year) was used as the theme for Brick Top Polford in the 2000 movie \"Snatch\".\n\nIn 2014, the song was featured on the FOX show \"So You Think You Can Dance\" during its 11th season.

However, Bailey often refers more precisely to two streets, North Bailey and South Bailey, that run along the peninsula.\n\nSouth Bailey begins close to St Cuthbert's, near to Prebends Bridge, at the southern tip of the peninsula. It is cobbled and flanked by numerous old buildings, many of which are owned by the Cathedral and University. Running northwards, South Bailey becomes North Bailey at the gate into \"the College\", an enclosed square containing the houses of the Cathedral's Dean and Canons as well as the Chorister School. North Bailey continues, and is flanked by three colleges, as well as numerous university subject departments. Some of these buildings are more modern in origin. The North Bailey ends at its junction with Owengate, which leads up onto Palace Green.\n\nThe remainder of the peninsula is centred around Durham Market Place. Saddler Street is borne out of Owengate and North Bailey, continuing downhill to the Market Place. Elvet Bridge leads over to Elvet, the eastern part of Durham city centre, and is now pedestrianised. The Market Place itself is centred on a statue of Lord Londonderry. Saddler Street enters at its south-east corner, whilst Silver Street falls away to the south-west towards Framwellgate Bridge. St Nicholas' Church, Durham lies to the north of the Market Place, alongside the exit from Durham's Congestion Charge Zone onto Claypath. The dual carriageway A690 forms a northern border to the peninsula area.\n\nWith steep cliffs and the River Wear on three sides, Durham's peninsula has long been recognised as a prime defensive site. A fortress was first established there in 1072, with the present keep being built in the 14th century.\n\nIn the Middle Ages the whole peninsula was known as \"the castle\" and was enclosed by a wall. Parts of the wall can still be seen in the grounds of the Bailey colleges of Durham University and to the west of the Cathedral; these walls are Grade I listed. Along the inside of the wall on the east side ran a street. This road still exists and forms the present North and South Bailey. At its southern end, the street is still cobbled and is widely regarded as among the most attractive streets in the city.\n\nThe central and southern parts of The Bailey, including the Castle, the Cathedral, the College, and Prebends Bridge, are now designated a World Heritage Site.\n\n"}

The character has been depicted as a member of the Soviet Super-Soldiers.\n\nHis first appearance was in \"Incredible Hulk\" #258, and the character was created by Bill Mantlo and Sal Buscema.\n\nBorn in Blagoveshchensk, Mikhail Ursus was one of the first known mutants born in the Soviet Union in the 20th Century to survive past childhood. Up until the time of his birth, the Soviet government had killed all mutants at the first manifestation of their superhuman powers. In Mikhail's case this was at a young age and he was abandoned in the mountains, growing up amongst the animals of the forest and presumably using his shape-changing power to survive.\n\nDue to the efforts of scientist Piotr Phobos, the government was made to see the potential value of superhumans serving the state and Phobos soon opened a private school to train mutants. Mikhail Ursus was among the first of the many mutants trained by Professor Phobos. Unknown to both his students and the Soviet government, Phobos had built a device to siphon off energy from his students to give himself artificial powers of his own. The process tended to kill the subjects after a time, and Phobos explained their deaths as training casualties. When the second Red Guardian discovered Phobos's scheme, he managed to overpower her and went into hiding, but not before giving two of his students, Darkstar and Vanguard, graduation 'gifts' through which he could continue to siphon their power.\n\nFollowing certain field work, Mikhail, Darkstar and Vanguard (the three best-trained students of Phobos's school) were reunited and organized by the government into the elite Soviet Super-Soldiers, a team of Soviet government agents. Ursus was given the code name Ursa Major (though he is also known as 'Major Ursus'). The first mission of the Soviet Super-Soldiers was to investigate the contained radioactive area of Khystym known as the Forbidden Zone and to stop the Presence. There they encountered the Hulk, and discovered that their former teacher Professor Phobos was engaged in a project to radioactively contaminate all of the Soviet Union in order to foster the birth of more mutants whose powers he could eventually siphon. The Soviet Super-Soldiers, aided by the Hulk, thwarted Phobos's plan and brought him before the government to stand trial.\n\nAlthough the Super-Soldiers resolved to remain together as a team, they vowed to never again unquestioningly serve the state. They have subsequently undertaken one government mission, but generally act independently. They were based in a scientific fortress in the region of Khystym.\n\nUrsa Major later battled the Red Ghost alongside the Soviet Super-Soldiers. With the Soviet Super-Soldiers, he was dispatched to capture Magneto, and battled the X-Men and the Avengers. With Vanguard and Darkstar, Ursa Major later attempted to defect to the United States, but they were beaten comatose by the Supreme Soviets.\n\nLater, Ursa Major followed Vanguard into the employ of General Tskarov, a communist sympathizer who wanted to undermine American business along the East coast. They only agreed, however, in order to find the missing Darkstar, who (as Ursa later discovered) was in fact being experimented on in Tskarov's own laboratory. Ursa, Darkstar, and Vanguard then joined the Black Widow and Daredevil in defeating Tskarov.\n\nUrsa Major is one of the few mutants in the world to retain their powers after Decimation. Ursa Major returns as part of the Winter Guard, helping them and War Machine fight off a Skrull attempt to steal Russian nuclear bombs. Despite orders to the contrary, the entire Guard assists War Machine in killing or driving off the invaders.. \n\nThe Winter Guard would soon fight a group of superhuman Soviet revolutionaries called Remont Six. This group is led by Iron Maiden and they come into conflict with the Guard when they raid an AIM facility. Ursa Major would fight the Snow Leopards and Volga. The Winter Guard prevail and defeat the Remont Six. Later, Ursa and the rest of the Winter Guard team up with the Agents of Atlas to battle Warlord Krang. After teaming up with the Protectorate (including former Winter Guard members Powersurge and Vanguard), Ursa and the rest of the Winter Guard battle the Presence and former Winter Guard member turned Dire Wraith Fantasma and their Dire Wraith children.\n\nHe was later seen in a Russian gulag, forced to battle Bucky Barnes, who had been surrendered to the Russian government for alleged crimes as the Winter Soldier, convicted in absentia. When asked by the prison warden why Ursa Major had been incarcerated, Colonel Rostov replied \"it's not too difficult to find treason or corruption charges on any government agent.\"\n\nFollowing the \"Secret Empire\" storyline, Ursa Major is seen as a member of the Black Widow Ops Program where they cloned Black Widow following her death at the hands of Captain America's Hydra Supreme counterpart. He bribed Epsilon Red to let him add her current memories while secretly disposing of the bad programming.\n\nAt some point, Ursa Major was incarcerated in a gulag. He was approached by a Russian official who states that they are bringing the Winter Guard back together while presenting a pardon as a condition of him joining. Ursa Major accepted under the condition that they can expunge his criminal record as well. Ursa Major later represented the Russian government when he attended Black Panther's meeting in the Eden Room of Avengers Mountain. He started to get aggressive towards Black Panther. This caused Black Panther to have Avengers Mountain's teleportation system send Ursa Major to Siberia. Afterwards, Black Panther apologized and commented to the other representatives that he hoped that the Russian government would send Crimson Dynamo and that they sent Ursa Major on purpose. Black Panther concluded that they will not be getting any allies from Russia.\n\nDuring the \"War of the Realms\" storyline, Ursa Major is seen talking to Gorilla-Man in the Wundagore Zoo in Transia, discussing about an undercover operation he is running for Black Panther, until Ka-Zar shows up to pick up Gorilla-Man and take him to Avengers Mountain.\n\nUrsa Major has the mutant ability to transform himself into a large anthropomorphic bear. While in this form, Ursa Major retains his human intelligence, personality and ability to speak, though his personality does become more feral and he begins to lose control over his human intelligence if he remains in his transformed state for several hours consecutively. Ursa Major was trained by the Soviet Military, and trained in the use of his powers by Professor Phobos, being a graduate of Professor Phobos's mutant training school.\n\nWhile transformed, Ursa Major possesses superhuman strength, stamina and resistance to physical injury to a much greater degree than an actual bear of similar size possesses. His strength is sufficient to allow him to engage in a one-on-one battle with The Hulk and survive. His senses are also heightened to a superhuman degree, particularly his sense of smell, which he can use to track a target by scent. Also, like a real bear, Ursa Major possesses non-retractable claws. These claws are relatively blunt, as they are with an actual bear, but can be used as effective weapons when coupled with his great strength.\n\nUrsa Major is seen as a member of the Soviet Super-Soldiers in the House of M.\n\nIn the \"Marvel Zombies\" universe, Ursa Major works as a guard for the Kingpin's human clone vats. He attacks the Earth-616 Machine Man and tries to bite his head off. Machine Man extrudes spikes from his head, killing Ursa Major.\n\n\n"}

He is widely believed to have been killed at the hands of the Islamic Republic intelligence ministry for criticizing of Iran's Supreme Leader.\n\nSaidi Sirjani was a disillusioned supporter of the Islamic Revolution who used satirical and allegorical stories to criticize the Islamic Republic for what he saw as its \"authoritarianism, religious hypocrisy, and obtrusive meddling in people's personal lives.\" His first open confrontation with the authorities came following the publication of a book of essays, stories, and parables called \"You of Shortened Sleeves\" in 1989. The first printing sold out in days and the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance banned not only the second printing but all other books by Sirjani.\n\nSirjani then initiated a letter-writing campaign, demanding that a second printing be released. Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, then told Sirjani through intermediaries to halt his writings and his protestations. Sirjani refused and \"directly assailed the Islamic Republic in an open letter.\" According to Iranian scholar Ahmad Karimi-Hakkak, this 'letter sealed the author's fate in a way that no previous writing of his ... had done.'\n\nSaidi-Sirjani was arrested on 14 March 1994 (another source says 13 March 1993) and charged with openly criticizing the government, among other things. A spokesperson for the Iranian Ministry of Security and Intelligence claimed that the arrest was for \"drug use, production of alcohol, homosexual activity, contacts with spy networks, and having received money from Western counterrevolutionaries\" which majority of Iranians knew at the time to be a false accusation. A few months later a letter purportedly \"written by Sirjani himself admitted to a range of crimes against the state, but even then everyone knew the confession was not written by him.\"\n\nHis arrest became \"a rallying point\" for disparate factions of \"expatriate Iranian intellectuals, academics,\" who came together \"as never before.\" Letters of protest were dispatched to various political and professional organizations in Europe and the United States. Organizations such as Amnesty International, the American PEN, Human Rights Watch, and the Middle East Studies Association, as well as many European associations\nof writers.\n\nThe international human rights campaign failed to secure Saidi-Sirjani's release, however, and he died in custody 8 months after his arrest, reportedly at one of the safe houses of the Intelligence Ministry in Shemiran neighborhood in northern Tehran. Iranian authorities gave the cause of his death as a heart attack, although his daughter, Sayeh Sirjani, said her father had no history of heart ailments. The Sirjani family had also repeatedly denied allegations that he was addicted to drugs. The Government is reported to have \"refused to deliver his body to his family or to allow an independent autopsy.\"\n\nIt is widely believed and there is some evidence that he was killed by Saeed Emami's \"Unleashed\" group at the Ministry of Security and Intelligence. According to journalist Emadeddin Baqi, the method used to kill him was potassium.\n\nIranian journalist Afshin Molavi speculated that Sirjani was killed for crossing \"the red line\" from \"writer and thinker to rebel.\" While the Islamic Republic would \"grudgingly allowed allegorical criticism read by an elite,\" it took punitive action when the criticism became widely popular, when citizens disobeyed orders to stop protest and finally when they wrote \"open letters to newspapers questioning the Supreme Leader.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1984178", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1984178", "title": "Steam Heat", "text": "Steam Heat\n\n\"Steam Heat\" is a show tune from the 1954 Broadway musical \"The Pajama Game\", written by Richard Adler and Jerry Ross.\n\n\"Steam Heat\" was one of four songs which Adler and Ross wrote (\"within two days, I think\" - Adler) and submitted to George Abbott in hopes of being hired to score the stage musical Abbott was developing, which would become \"The Pajama Game\". Rather than complementing the musical's storyline of a labor dispute at a garment factory, \"Steam Heat\" manifests as an overt staged number being a song-and-dance number featured as the \"entertainment portion\" of a union rally with the factory boss' s secretary Gladys as lead performer. Carol Haney originated the role of Gladys and she sang and danced the \"Steam Heat\" number in the original production of \"The Pajama Game\" with the accompaniment of Peter Gennaro and Buzz Miller.\n\nThe \"Steam Heat\" number in \"The Pajama Game\" would make stage musical history by introducing the signature style of choreographer Bob Fosse. George Abbott had asked Fosse to stage \"Steam Heat\" in a manner appropriate to the amateur entertainment it was supposed to be, with Abbott specifically stating: \"Do something small\". When the \"Steam Heat\" number, featuring Fosse's minimalist but riveting dance moves, prefigured its Broadway reception by stopping the show during \"The Pajama Game\"'s out-of-town tryout in New Haven, Abbott - discomfited by the disruption to the play's flow - moved to cut the number: however Abbott's partner Jerome Robbins successfully lobbied for its retention.\n\nThe \"Steam Heat\" number would be recreated for the 1957 film version of \"The Pajama Game\" in which Haney would perform \"Steam Heat\" accompanied by Buzz Miller and Kenneth LeRoy. Haney, who would die in 1964 at age 39, had severe health problems during the film's shoot being hospitalized at one point and according to Harvey Evans, a dancer in the film: \"When you watch 'Steam Heat' [in the film] you can see that [physically] she's not really up to par\".\n\nIn the national tour of the original Broadway production of \"The Pajama Game\" Barbara Bostock would perform \"Steam Heat\" with accompaniment from Lee Capo and Cy Young.\n\nThe 1955 West End production of \"The Pajama Game\" featured \"Steam Heat\" as performed by Elizabeth Seal with accompaniment from Johnny Greenland and Ivor Meggido.\n\nIn the 2006-07 Roundabout Theatre revival of \"The Pajama Game\" the \"Steam Heat\" number was reassigned to a factory worker character named Mae, played by Joyce Chittick: Chittick was accompanied on the \"Steam Heat\" number by David Eggars and Vince Pesce. Taprena Augustine as Mae performed \"Steam Heat\" in the national tour of the Roundabout Theatre production (2008–09).\n\n\"Steam Heat\" was performed in \"Fosse\" by Meg Gillentine with Julio Monge and Josh Rhodes.\n\n\"Steam Heat\" became a staple of Shirley MacLaine's nightclub act, as MacLaine had been the understudy for Carol Haney in the original Broadway production of \"The Pajama Game\" and had gone on for Haney at a performance attended by film producer Hal B. Wallis who was interested in Haney: MacLaine's performance had so impressed Wallis that he'd come backstage to invite her to audition for him the next day with the result being MacLaine being signed for her motion picture debut in \"The Trouble with Harry\". (\"Hernando's Hideaway\", Carol Haney's other big number from \"The Pajama Game\", was also a staple of MacLaine's act.)\n\n\"Steam Heat\" became at Top Ten hit for Patti Page as released by Mercury Records as catalog number 70380: debuting on the \"Billboard\" chart of 26 May 1954, the disc charted for nine weeks with a #8. (The film rights for \"The Pajama Game\" would eventually be purchased to provide a vehicle for Page although she was to play the character of Babe rather than Gladys: ultimately Babe would be played in the film by Doris Day.) The recording featured a replication of radiator being pounded, an effect performed by Mac Ceppos, a career session violinist who previously had been heard barking on Page's 1952 #1 hit \"The Doggie in the Window\". Page's recording was prominently featured at the end of \"Hot Water\", Episode 20 of Season 3 of \"Pretty Little Liars\" broadcast February 19, 2013: Spencer Hastings (played by Troian Bellisario) had been endangered by being locked in an overheating sauna earlier in the episode, which ends with the series' unseen stalker putting the finishing touches on a funeral wreath while listening to the Patti Page recording of \"Steam Heat\".\n\nElla Fitzgerald recorded \"Steam Heat\" for her 1963 album release \"Ella Sings Broadway\".\n\nLiza Minnelli and Tracey Everitt sang and danced Everitt's choreography to \"Steam Heat\" on The Judy Garland Show's Christmas Special episode (Aired Dec. 22, 1963).\n\nThe Pointer Sisters remade \"Steam Heat\" for their 1974 album \"That's a Plenty\" on which \"Steam Heat\" was framed by the original composition (by Jeffrey Cohen and Bruce Good) \"Bangin' On the Pipes\": released as a single, the Pointer Sisters' \"Steam Heat\" failed to become a major hit, only \"Bubbling Under\" the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 at #108. However \"Steam Heat\", which was featured on the 1974 concert album \"The Pointer Sisters Live at the Opera House\", became a signature song of the Pointer Sisters' first career phase, with the group performing \"Bangin' On the Pipes\"/\"Steam Heat\" on \"The Carol Burnett Show\" broadcast of September 28, 1974. The February 28, 1976, broadcast of \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show\" titled \"Sue Ann Falls in Love\", featured Georgia Engel performing a sultry song and dance number to \"Steam Heat\". The \"Good Times\" episode broadcast December 20, 1978, featured cast members Esther Rolle, Ja'net Dubois, BernNadette Stanis and Janet Jackson performing \"Steam Heat\", with the quartet introduced as \"the Pointless Sisters.\"\n\nWall Street Crash performed \"Steam Heat\" for the European release of their 1982 self-titled album.\n"}

The castle is situated above the town of Spišské Podhradie and the village of Žehra, in the region known as Spiš (, , , ). It was included in the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites in 1993 (together with the adjacent locations of Spišská Kapitula, Spišské Podhradie and Žehra). This is one of the biggest European castles by area (41 426 m²).\n\nSpiš Castle was built in the 12th century on the site of an earlier castle. It was the political, administrative, economic and cultural center of Szepes County of the Kingdom of Hungary. Before 1464, it was owned by the kings of Hungary, afterward (until 1528) by the Zápolya family, the Thurzó family (1531–1635), the Csáky family (1638–1945), and (since 1945) by the state of Czechoslovakia then Slovakia.\n\nOriginally a Romanesque stone castle with fortifications, a two-story Romanesque palace and a three-nave Romanesque-Gothic basilica were constructed by the second half of the 13th century. A second extramural settlement was built in the 14th century, by which the castle area was doubled. The castle was completely rebuilt in the 15th century; the castle walls were heightened and a third extramural settlement was constructed. A late Gothic chapel was added around 1470. The Zápolya clan performed late Gothic transformations, which made the upper castle into a comfortable family residence, typical of late Renaissance residences of the 16th and 17th centuries. \nThe last owners of the Spiš Castle, the Csáky family, abandoned the castle in the early 18th century because they considered it too uncomfortable to live in. They moved to the newly built nearby village castles/palaces in Hodkovce near Žehra and Spišský Hrhov.\n\nIn 1780, the castle was destroyed in a fire. The cause of the blaze is unknown, but there are a few theories. One is that the Csáky family purposely burned it down to reduce taxes as at the time additional taxes applied to roofed buildings. Another is that it was struck by lightning, which started the fire. A third is that some soldiers in the castle were making moonshine and in the process accidentally started the fire. Whatever the case, after the fire, the castle was no longer occupied and began to fall into disrepair.\n\nThe castle was partly reconstructed in the second half of the 20th century, and extensive archaeological research was carried out on the site. The reconstructed sections house displays of the Spiš Museum, and artifacts such as torture devices formerly used in the castle.\n\n\nJayden R. likes Xiclali J A from treeview. ----Xochitl ;)"}

The library also hosts special exhibits, such as Carter's Nobel Peace Prize and a full-scale replica of the Oval Office as it was during the Carter Administration, including a reproduction of the \"Resolute\" desk.\n\nThe Carter Library and Museum includes some parts that are owned and administered by the federal government, and some that are privately owned and operated. The library and museum are run by the National Archives and Records Administration and are part of the Presidential Library system of the federal government. Privately owned areas house Carter's offices and the offices of the Carter Center, a non-profit human rights agency.\n\nThe building housing the library and museum makes up 69,750 square feet (6480 m²), with 15,269 square feet (1419 m²) of space for exhibits and 19,818 square feet (1841 m²) of archive and storage space. The library stacks house 27 million pages of documents; 500,000 photos, and 40,000 objects, along with films, videos, and audiotapes. These collections cover all areas of the Carter administration, from foreign and domestic policy to the personal lives of President and Mrs. Carter.\n\nThe complex lies next to John Lewis Freedom Parkway, which was originally called \"Presidential Parkway\" (and at one point, \"Jimmy Carter Parkway\") in its planning stages.\n\nEarly in his administration, Carter indicated interest in having his presidential library be built in Georgia. The site chosen was in the Poncey–Highland neighborhood of Atlanta, on land that had been acquired by the state of Georgia Department of Transportation, for an interchange between two redundant highways that were cancelled by Carter when he was governor of Georgia, in response to the Atlanta freeway revolts. (See Interstate 485, Georgia 400, Interstate 675, and the Stone Mountain Freeway.)\n\nThe Atlanta firm of Jova/Daniels/Busby was selected as architects, in cooperation with Lawton/Umemura/Yamamoto of Hawaii. During design and construction, Carter's papers were temporarily housed at the former post office building in downtown Atlanta. Construction commenced on October 2, 1984, and the library was opened to the public on Carter's 62nd birthday, October 1, 1986. Construction cost $26 million, funded by private contributions.\n\nA $10 million renovation of the museum began in April 2009 with completion on President Carter's 85th birthday in October 2009.\n\nThe first director of the library and museum was Dr. Donald Schewe, who originally assisted with the transfer and processing of the Carter Administration materials at the end of Carter's term in early 1981.\n\nAs of 2014, the current director is Dr. Meredith Evans, an Atlanta native who had held various leadership positions in special collections and libraries in institutions such as Washington University in St. Louis and George Washington University.\n\nThe library and museum offers free admission to all students 16 and under. They can either go on a docent or self-guided tour. Together the library and The Coca-Cola Foundation have established funding for the library to provide transportation funds for all Georgia schools to use when bringing students to the museum for education activities.\n\n"}
{"id": "1984187", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1984187", "title": "Biomineralization", "text": "Biomineralization\n\nBiomineralization, or biomineralisation is the process by which living organisms produce minerals, often to harden or stiffen existing tissues. Such tissues are called mineralized tissues. It is an extremely widespread phenomenon; all six taxonomic kingdoms contain members that are able to form minerals, and over 60 different minerals have been identified in organisms. Examples include silicates in algae and diatoms, carbonates in invertebrates, and calcium phosphates and carbonates in vertebrates. These minerals often form structural features such as sea shells and the bone in mammals and birds. Organisms have been producing mineralised skeletons for the past 550 million years. Ca carbonates and Ca phosphates are usually crystalline, but silica organisms (sponges, diatoms...) are always non crystalline minerals. Other examples include copper, iron and gold deposits involving bacteria. Biologically-formed minerals often have special uses such as magnetic sensors in magnetotactic bacteria (FeO), gravity sensing devices (CaCO, CaSO, BaSO) and iron storage and mobilization (FeO•HO in the protein ferritin).\n\nIn terms of taxonomic distribution, the most common biominerals are the phosphate and carbonate salts of calcium that are used in conjunction with organic polymers such as collagen and chitin to give structural support to bones and shells. The structures of these biocomposite materials are highly controlled from the nanometer to the macroscopic level, resulting in complex architectures that provide multifunctional properties. Because this range of control over mineral growth is desirable for materials engineering applications, there is significant interest in understanding and elucidating the mechanisms of biologically controlled biomineralization.\n\nAmong metazoans, biominerals composed of calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate or silica perform a variety of roles such as support, defense and feeding. It is less clear what purpose biominerals serve in bacteria. One hypothesis is that cells create them to avoid entombment by their own metabolic byproducts. Iron oxide particles may also enhance their metabolism.\n\nIf present on a super-cellular scale, biominerals are usually deposited by a dedicated organ, which is often defined very early in the embryological development. This organ will contain an organic matrix that facilitates and directs the deposition of crystals. The matrix may be collagen, as in deuterostomes, or based on chitin or other polysaccharides, as in molluscs.\n\nThe mollusc shell is a biogenic composite material that has been the subject of much interest in materials science because of its unusual properties and its model character for biomineralization. Molluscan shells consist of 95–99% calcium carbonate by weight, while an organic component makes up the remaining 1–5%. The resulting composite has a fracture toughness ≈3000 times greater than that of the crystals themselves. In the biomineralization of the mollusc shell, specialized proteins are responsible for directing crystal nucleation, phase, morphology, and growths dynamics and ultimately give the shell its remarkable mechanical strength. The application of biomimetic principles elucidated from mollusc shell assembly and structure may help in fabricating new composite materials with enhanced optical, electronic, or structural properties.\nThe most described arrangement in mollusc shells is the nacre - prismatic shells, known in large shells as \"Pinna\" or the pearl oyster (\"Pinctada\"). Not only the structure of the layers differ, but their mineralogy and chemical composition also differ. Both contain organic components (proteins, sugars and lipids) and the organic components are characteristic of the layer, and of the species. The structures and arrangements of mollusc shells are diverse, but they share some features: the main part of the shell is a crystalline Ca carbonate (aragonite, calcite), despite some amorphous Ca carbonate occurs; and despite they react as crystals, they never show angles and facets. The examination of the inner structure of the prismatic units, nacreous tablets, foliated laths... shows irregular rounded granules.\n\nFungi are a diverse group of organisms that belong to the eukaryotic domain. Studies of their significant roles in geological processes, \"geomycology\", has shown that fungi are involved with biomineralization, biodegradation, and metal-fungal interactions.\n\nIn studying fungi's roles in biomineralization, it has been found that fungi deposit minerals with the help of an organic matrix, such as a protein, that provides a nucleation site for the growth of biominerals. Fungal growth may produce a copper-containing mineral precipitate, such as copper carbonate produced from a mixture of (NH)CO and CuCl. The production of the copper carbonate is produced in the presence of proteins made and secreted by the fungi. These fungal proteins that are found extracellularly aid in the size and morphology of the carbonate minerals precipitated by the fungi.\n\nIn addition to precipitating carbonate minerals, fungi can also precipitate uranium-containing phosphate biominerals in the presence of organic phosphorus that acts a substrate for the process. The fungi produce a hyphal matrix, also known as mycelium, that localizes and accumulates the uranium minerals that have been precipitated. Although uranium is often deemed as toxic towards living organisms, certain fungi such as \"Aspergillus niger\" and \"Paecilomyces javanicus\" can tolerate it.\n\nThough minerals can be produced by fungi, they can also be degraded; mainly by oxalic-acid producing strains of fungi. Oxalic acid production is increased in the presence of glucose for three organic acid producing fungi – \"Aspergillus niger\", \"Serpula himantioides\", and \"Trametes versicolor\". These fungi have been found to corrode apatite and galena minerals. Degradation of minerals by fungi is carried out through a process known as neogenesis. The order of most to least oxalic acid secreted by the fungi studied are \"Aspergillus niger\", followed by \"Serpula himantioides\", and finally \"Trametes versicolor\". These capabilities of certain groups of fungi have a major impact on corrosion, a costly problem for many industries and the economy.\n\nThe majority of biominerals fall into three distinct mineral classes: carbonates, silicates and phosphates.\n\nThe major carbonates are CaCO. The most common polymorphs in biomineralization are calcite (e.g. foraminifera, coccolithophores) and aragonite (e.g. corals), although metastable vaterite and amorphous calcium carbonate can also be important, either structurally or as intermediate phases in biomineralization. Some biominerals include a mixture of these phases in distinct, organised structural components (e.g. bivalve shells). Carbonates are particularly prevalent in marine environments, but also present in fresh water and terrestrial organisms.\n\nSilicates are particularly common in marine biominerals, where Diatoms and Radiolaria form frustules from hydrated amorphous silica (Opal).\n\nThe most common phosphate is hydroxyapatite, a calcium phosphate (Ca(PO)(OH)) which is a primary constituent of bone, teeth, and fish scales.\n\nBeyond these main three categories, there a number of less common types of biominerals, usually resulting from a need for specific physical properties or the organism inhabiting an unusual environment. For example, teeth that are primarily used for scraping hard substrates may be reinforced with particularly tough minerals, such as the iron minerals Magnetite in Chiton, or Goethite in Limpets. Gastropod molluscs living close to hydrothermal vents reinforce their carbonate shells with the iron-sulphur minerals pyrite and greigite. Magnetotactic bacteria also employ magnetic iron minerals magnetite and greigite to produce magnetosomes to aid orientation and distribution in the sediments. Planktic acantharea (radiolaria) form strontium sulphate (Celestine) spicules.\n\nThe first evidence of biomineralization dates to some , and sponge-grade organisms may have formed calcite skeletons . But in most lineages, biomineralization first occurred in the Cambrian or Ordovician periods. Organisms used whichever form of calcium carbonate was more stable in the water column at the point in time when they became biomineralized, and stuck with that form for the remainder of their biological history (but see for a more detailed analysis). The stability is dependent on the Ca/Mg ratio of seawater, which is thought to be controlled primarily by the rate of sea floor spreading, although atmospheric levels may also play a role.\n\nBiomineralization evolved multiple times, independently, and most animal lineages first expressed biomineralized components in the Cambrian period. Many of the same processes are used in unrelated lineages, which suggests that biomineralization machinery was assembled from pre-existing \"off-the-shelf\" components already used for other purposes in the organism. Although the biomachinery facilitating biomineralization is complex – involving signalling transmitters, inhibitors, and transcription factors – many elements of this 'toolkit' are shared between phyla as diverse as corals, molluscs, and vertebrates.\nThe shared components tend to perform quite fundamental tasks, such as designating that cells will be used to create the minerals, whereas genes controlling more finely tuned aspects that occur later in the biomineralization process – such as the precise alignment and structure of the crystals produced – tend to be uniquely evolved in different lineages. This suggests that Precambrian organisms were employing the same elements, albeit for a different purpose — perhaps to \"avoid\" the inadvertent precipitation of calcium carbonate from the supersaturated Proterozoic oceans. Forms of mucus that are involved in inducing mineralization in most metazoan lineages appear to have performed such an anticalcifatory function in the ancestral state. Further, certain proteins that would originally have been involved in maintaining calcium concentrations within cells are homologous to all metazoans, and appear to have been co-opted into biomineralization after the divergence of the metazoan lineages. The \"galaxins\" are one probable example of a gene being co-opted from a different ancestral purpose into controlling biomineralization, in this case being 'switched' to this purpose in the Triassic scleractinian corals; the role performed appears to be functionally identical to the unrelated pearlin gene in molluscs. Carbonic anhydrase serves a role in mineralization in sponges, as well as metazoans, implying an ancestral role.\nFar from being a rare trait that evolved a few times and remained stagnant, biomineralization pathways in fact evolved many times and are still evolving rapidly today; even within a single genus it is possible to detect great variation within a single gene family.\n\nThe homology of biomineralization pathways is underlined by a remarkable experiment whereby the nacreous layer of a molluscan shell was implanted into a human tooth, and rather than experiencing an immune response, the molluscan nacre was incorporated into the host bone matrix. This points to the exaptation of an original biomineralization pathway.\n\nThe most ancient example of biomineralization, dating back 2 billion years, is the deposition of magnetite, which is observed in some bacteria, as well as the teeth of chitons and the brains of vertebrates; it is possible that this pathway, which performed a magnetosensory role in the common ancestor of all bilaterians, was duplicated and modified in the Cambrian to form the basis for calcium-based biomineralization pathways. Iron is stored in close proximity to magnetite-coated chiton teeth, so that the teeth can be renewed as they wear. Not only is there a marked similarity between the magnetite deposition process and enamel deposition in vertebrates but some vertebrates even have comparable iron storage facilities near their teeth.\n\nIt has been suggested that biominerals could be important indicators of extraterrestrial life and thus could play an important role in the search for past or present life on Mars. Furthermore, organic components (biosignatures) that are often associated with biominerals are believed to play crucial roles in both pre-biotic and biotic reactions.\n\nOn January 24, 2014, NASA reported that current studies by the \"Curiosity\" and \"Opportunity\" rovers on the planet Mars will now be searching for evidence of ancient life, including a biosphere based on autotrophic, chemotrophic and/or chemolithoautotrophic microorganisms, as well as ancient water, including fluvio-lacustrine environments (plains related to ancient rivers or lakes) that may have been habitable. The search for evidence of habitability, taphonomy (related to fossils), and organic carbon on the planet Mars is now a primary NASA objective.\n\nMost traditional approaches to synthesis of nanoscale materials are energy inefficient, requiring stringent conditions (e.g., high temperature, pressure or pH) and often produce toxic byproducts. Furthermore, the quantities produced are small, and the resultant material is usually irreproducible because of the difficulties in controlling agglomeration. In contrast, materials produced by organisms have properties that usually surpass those of analogous synthetically manufactured materials with similar phase composition. Biological materials are assembled in aqueous environments under mild conditions by using macromolecules. Organic macromolecules collect and transport raw materials and assemble these substrates and into short- and long-range ordered composites with consistency and uniformity.\nThe aim of biomimetics is to mimic the natural way of producing minerals such as apatites. Many man-made crystals require elevated temperatures and strong chemical solutions, whereas the organisms have long been able to lay down elaborate mineral structures at ambient temperatures. Often, the mineral phases are not pure but are made as composites that entail an organic part, often protein, which takes part in and controls the biomineralisation. These composites are often not only as hard as the pure mineral but also tougher, as the micro-environment controls biomineralisation.\n\nBiomineralization may be used to remediate groundwater contaminated with uranium. The biomineralization of uranium primarily involves the precipitation of uranium phosphate minerals associated with the release of phosphate by microorganisms. Negatively charged ligands at the surface of the cells attract the positively charged uranyl ion (UO). If the concentrations of phosphate and UO are sufficiently high, minerals such as autunite (Ca(UO)(PO)•10-12HO) or polycrystalline HUOPO may form thus reducing the mobility of UO. Compared to the direct addition of inorganic phosphate to contaminated groundwater, biomineralization has the advantage that the ligands produced by microbes will target uranium compounds more specifically rather than react actively with all aqueous metals. Stimulating bacterial phosphatase activity to liberate phosphate under controlled conditions limits the rate of bacterial hydrolysis of organophosphate and the release of phosphate to the system, thus avoiding clogging of the injection location with metal phosphate minerals. The high concentration of ligands near the cell surface also provides nucleation foci for precipitation, which leads to higher efficiency than chemical precipitation.\n\nExamples of biogenic minerals include:\n\n\n\n"}

She is known for her roles in the 1923 film \"The Green Goddess\" and its 1930 remake of the same name.\n\nAlice Joyce was born in Kansas City, Missouri to John Edward and Vallie Olive McIntyre Joyce (1873–1938). She had a brother, Francis \"Frank\" Joyce (1893–1935), who was 2 years younger who later became an entertainment manager. Her father was a smelter of Irish and French ancestry and her mother a Welsh seamstress. Educated at a convent in Maryland, she ran away to New York while still a teenager.\n\nBy 1900, her parents' marriage fell apart, and her father John took custody of little Alice and Frank and moved to Falls Church, Virginia, where Joyce spent most of her childhood. According to the 1910 Census, her mother, Vallie, remarried in 1900 to Leon Faber, and they resided in the Bronx, New York, along with Alice and her brother, Frank, where she was employed as a \"photographer's model\" and appeared in illustrated songs.\n\nShe once said that film producer D.W. Griffith had told her that she \"reminded him of a cow\". Despite this unflattering comment, Joyce was a well-respected actress of the silent film era. Though D.W. Griffith did not show any interest in her, she found work modelling for both artists and photographers. One film historian ranks her among the top models of 1910, in the company of Mabel Normand and Anna Nilsson. She posed for some of the better known artists of the day: Harrison Fisher, Charles Dana Gibson and Neysa McMein.\n\nIt was director Sidney Olcott at the Kalem Company in New York City who gave Alice Joyce her first chance, casting her in his 1910 production \"The Deacon's Daughter\". She was sent to work under director Kenean Buel on the West Coast after Kalem acquired the old Essanay Studios property in East Hollywood in October 1913. Joyce spent time with Kalem (1910–1915) and Vitagraph (1916–1921), later working as independent for various studios. Her stardom began to wane with the advent of sound motion pictures.\n\nJoyce was married three times, the first time in 1914 to actor Tom Moore with whom she had a daughter, Alice Joyce Moore (1916–1960). They divorced in 1920. The same year she married James B. Regan, son of the managing director of the old Knickerbocker Hotel; her second daughter was born during this union. They divorced in 1932, shortly after which the actress declared bankruptcy before she married for a third time. Her last marriage came in 1933 in Virginia City, Nevada to film director Clarence Brown; they separated in 1942 and divorced in 1945. The actress retained Brown's name. During their separation, she sued him for reparation on cruelty charges. She resided in Northridge, California. In 1946, after Joyce was seriously injured in a traffic accident, Brown remained with her for nine hours and paid her medical bills.\n\nJoyce was known as \"The Madonna of the Screen\" for her striking features and presence. She made her last movie in 1930, after which she and ex-husband Tom Moore worked a late vaudeville circuit for a time. She declared voluntary bankruptcy in 1933. Joyce was active in women's organizations in the San Fernando Valley in her later years. She did book reviews and made sketches for friends.\n\nThe actress was ill for several years before her death from a blood and heart ailment at Hollywood Presbyterian Hospital. She was 65 years old. On her death in 1955, Alice Joyce was interred next to her mother Vallie in the San Fernando Mission Cemetery in Mission Hills, California. Alice Joyce had two daughters: Mrs. Alice Moore de Tolley of Dover, Delaware and Mrs. Peggy Harris of Clark Fork, Idaho. She left an estate valued at $175,000, with a gross income of approximately $27,600. Her daughters received a collection of jewelry, including an eight-carat (1.6 g) emerald-cut diamond ring and a 55 carat (11 g) star sapphire ring. The remainder of the estate was placed in trust under terms of the will. The income from this was divided equally between Joyce's daughters. \n\n"}
{"id": "1984210", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1984210", "title": "Sudden", "text": "Sudden\n\nJames Green aka \"Sudden\" is a fictional character created by an English author Oliver Strange in the early 1930s as the hero of a series, originally published by George Newnes Books Ltd, set in the American Wild West era. Oliver Strange died in 1952, and the series was revived by Frederick H. Christian in the 1960s. Christian classified the books as \"Piccadilly westerns\", that is books written by English authors, simply drawing on the conventions the genre, with no first hand experience of America. The Sudden books are among the earliest and best-loved of the type. Sudden is portrayed as an intrepid and accurate gunfighter in search of two men who cheated his foster father. James Green earns the nickname \"Sudden\" because of his lightning speed with a gun. Sudden is portrayed as a stereotypical gunfighter: an intelligent and resourceful drifting cowboy who is respectful of the law, unwilling to use a gun unless absolutely necessary, humanitarian, brave, strong, and fair. The first book was published in 1930 and was followed by 10 more until the 1940s and featured vivid descriptions of the western American landscape, rare in an author at that time. The series became popular for its exciting narrations combining elements of mystery, suspense, and action, with engaging characters, in a Wild West setting of dusty towns, ranches, and saloons.\n\nSudden's background story is not explicitly detailed but it is mentioned several times that as a young man, he promises his dying foster father that he will find the two men who cheated him and take revenge. In \"Sudden—Outlawed\", which goes back to the beginning of his story, he has returned to Texas from an Eastern education, but sets out on his quest for revenge on the death of his foster parent, using the name James Green. Almost at once, he himself is wrongly accused of murder and robbery and becomes an outlaw. In \"Sudden\" (1933), he is pardoned by the Governor of Arizona, Bleke, made a US deputy marshal, and subsequently sent on (typically undercover) missions to maintain law and order. In \"The Range Robbers\", in fact the first book to be written, his story is resolved. He is revealed to be Donald Peterson, son of one of the men he has been hunting, and he marries Noreen, who turns out to be the abducted daughter of his foster father. The other object of his search is the villain of this story, whom Sudden exposes and kills.\n\nThe second story to be written, \"The Law o' the Lariat\", follows on from \"The Range Robbers\". In it Sudden, this time calling himself Jim Severn, has temporarily left his wife and family to go and help another rancher. However, the original situation outlined in \"The Range Robbers\", of a once-outlaw turned undercover lawman, forced to move from place to place on his own quest for vengeance, provided a framework for any number of more or less self-contained stories, and Strange devoted the rest of the series to these earlier adventures.\n\nThe stories in the series follow very conventional and repetitive plot lines. A plot line typically revolves around Sudden arriving in a town that either has several unlawful elements or recent conflicts and mysterious deaths. Sudden earns the respect of the townspeople, fights against all odds, defeats the villains, protects the wronged, and then rides out into the sunset to continue his search.\n\nMany events are repeated in all the stories, for example, fist fights in which the cowboy faces a bigger adversary without using any weapons, and emerges victorious; gun fights describing Sudden's lightning speed; and kidnapping-cum-rescue-cum-chase sequences as the climax. Often he acts as a detective, piecing together clues, and revealing the villain in a well-attended denouement, leading to a violent resolution. Further, in every book, Sudden befriends a young man who acts as a capable sidekick, and this young friend falls in love and inevitably wins the hand of the girl he loves; the only exception is \"The Range Robbers\" where the romantic involvement is that of Sudden himself and Noreen. One of the young men he befriends, however, reappears in more than one of the stories.\n\nThe stories are classified as potboilers due to their conventional and predictable story lines, almost obvious plots, and scant characterization. Moreover, they essentially comprise the recurring motif of Sudden succeeding in uniting lovers, resolving conflicts, and then riding away to other towns to search for his enemies. However, they represent an important contribution to the Western genre, providing a description of the Wild West – the lifestyles, conditions, and customs, and the speech – which, accurate or not, is vivid and convincing. The novels are also well liked for the laconic style, sharp cutting dialogue, and dry humor. For example, in \"Sudden Rides Again\", when four rogues block the path of a girl in a saloon, Sudden remarks, \"Go ahead, ma'am; if anyone gets in yore way yu'll only have to \"step over him\".\" In \"Sudden\" (1933), to a question as to what his business is, Sudden replies \"Well, it ain't advertisin.\"\n\nSome claim that the books use language that may be unacceptable in modern society, while others argue that the language used is but a product of the times and representative of a period when such language was commonplace; for example, Sudden rides a black horse named Nigger. On the other hand, the lead character often professes respect and admiration for Native Americans. The books, in general, portray racism on the part of any character as a negative trait and undesirable. We are told that Sudden himself was brought up by a Paiute trader, before being adopted by his foster father Bill Evesham. Friendship with, understanding of, and learning from Native Americans are encouraged and treasured throughout the book, similar to the Westerns by Louis Lamour. In \"Sudden Plays a Hand\", the secondary hero rapes a young woman whom he wrongly believes to be a prostitute, then marries her to preserve her honour. The story narrates how she eventually comes to love and forgive him. The assumption that his crime would have been excusable if he had been right in his first assessment of her is not challenged, but would probably be typical of the time the story was written, and that in which it is set.\n\nAfter Strange's death in 1952 the novels were still selling well, and an editor at Corgi Books in England had the idea of continuing the series, with the approval of Strange's family . Under the name of Frederick H. Christian he produced \"modest little three-weeks-to-write westerns\", which also sold successfully. Christian not only copied two novels with almost similar story lines, but also botched up the narrative in \"Sudden Strikes Back\", where a bully tries to ride Sudden's horse and gets thrown down; the name of the girl who watches is given as \"Noreen,\" Sudden's wife who he meets only much later in \"The Range Robbers\" (according to Oliver Strange) which describes an almost identical incident. Similarly, \"Sudden at Bay\" has strong resemblances to \"Sudden (1933)\". In \"Dead or Alive!\", Christian makes Sudden a widower with references to Noreen clearly suggesting her death.\n\n\"The Range Robbers\" was the first book published, but when Oliver Strange continued the series, he went back and forth with Sudden's history and so the publication order is not the same as the chronological order. All Sudden novels are out of print today.\n\nOliver Strange wrote 10 Sudden books –\n\n\nFrederick H. Christian wrote 5 Sudden books –\n\n\nSudden Series\n"}

Various mnemonic names have been used to memorize these letters, such as \"Ear\" and \"Mouth\", the most common variation.\n\nE&M was originally developed for signaling between PABXs in different geographic locations over an analog private circuit. The protocol was later extended for use on digital carrier system with Channel Associated Signaling (CAS).\n\nThe E&M standards were initially developed by Bell Labs and extended by national PTT administrations. The standard defines two sides of the interface, the trunk circuit and the signaling unit. The trunk circuit is normally the side to which the PABX is connected. The signaling unit is the special modem that converts the DC signaling protocol into tones that could be transmitted over a four-wire link back to the PTT exchange.\n\nThe signaling unit and trunk circuit communicate their status over the E and M leads, using a combination of battery and earth (also known as ground) levels. The battery signal level used in the standard is nominally −48 VDC. All E&M installations require that the positive terminal of the battery is connected to a reliable shared earth circuit. The maximum distance between the signaling unit and the trunk interface is determined by the resistance of the wire, but is normally less than 100 meters for adequate noise immunity.\n\nThe group of E&M signaling includes several variations.\n\n\"Type I\" is the most common standard in North America and Japan, and signals an outgoing call from the PBX to the signaling unit with Battery on the M (\"Mouth\") lead. Incoming calls from the CO are signaled by an earth (ground) signal on the E (\"Ear\") lead. The interface is vulnerable to poor earthing at either end, and interference from external electrical noise which act on inferior voice signal quality. \n\n\"Types II to IV\" are variants which attempt to overcome the main limitation of Type I, which is the reference to earth at each end of the circuit. Types II-IV use the Signal Battery (SB) and Signal Ground (SG) lead in conjunction with the E&M wires. This improves noise immunity as the Signal Ground does not carry the same heavy currents as normal ground connections and provides a low resistance return path for signaling. However, if the main ground connection fails all earth current may flow via the interface, causing signaling failure, hum and in extreme cases destruction of equipment.\n\n\"Type V\" is the most common variant in use outside United States. In contrast to Type I, both ends of the connection indicate a call by grounding the relevant lead. This means that it is easy to interconnect two PABXs \"back-to-back\" by crossing over the E&M leads and transmit and receive pairs.\n\n\"SSDC5\" is commonly used in the United Kingdom and unlike Type V the on- and off-hook state, are backwards to allow for fail-safe operation. If the line breaks, the interface defaults to busy.\n\nE&M defines eight wires:\n\n\"4-wire E&M\" uses a 4-wire (2-pair) transmission path for the voice signal.\n\"2-wire E&M\" uses a single pair for both transmit and receive voice signal. This is much inferior to 4-wire E&M as the 2-wire interface uses hybrid transformers which reduce signal quality and can introduce echo.\n\nThe mechanisms described so far only allow circuit seizure – on-hook and off-hook – to be signaled. In order to allow dialing over the interface, \"start\" signaling mechanisms are defined. This allows the other end to know when to send the dialed digits, which are transmitted by pulse (loop disconnect) or multi-frequency tones. E&M defines three methods of \"start\" signaling:\n\n\nThe choice of letters for the E and M leads was fortuitous, unrelated to any names or meanings. However, various names have been associated with the letters \"E\" and \"M\":\n\n\n"}

The film included six new songs, but was poorly promoted and not received very well by the public (as the film had a somewhat darker and more mature tone than the TV series) or contemporary critics; in the decades since, it has become somewhat of a cult classic; some of the film's songs are now part of the Monkees' current concert setlist.\n\nThe Monkees' television series was canceled after its second season. The group hoped to take the television show in different directions, e.g. recasting it as an hour-long variety show with comedy sketches and musical guests.

It aired on NBC on April 14, 1969 (opposite ABC's live telecast of the 41st Academy Awards) to lower-than-expected ratings. The second two planned television specials were never produced. Peter Tork quit the group between the taping of \"33⅓ Revolutions Per Monkee\" and its broadcast; Michael Nesmith left the group - buying out of his contract - in early 1970 to focus on his solo career, leaving the Monkees as a duo of Dolenz and Jones, under which one final original Monkees album under the 1966 Colgems contract, \"Changes,\" was released in June 1970.\n\nThe Monkees returned to broadcast television with \"Hey, Hey, It's the Monkees,\" a reunion special which was broadcast on ABC on February 17, 1997.

These resources can be saved in a triplestore to reach them with the query language SPARQL.\n\nThe first version was published by the World-Wide Web Consortium (W3C) in April 1998, and the final W3C recommendation was released in February 2004. Many RDFS components are included in the more expressive Web Ontology Language (OWL).\n\nRDFS constructs are the RDFS classes, associated properties and utility properties built on the limited vocabulary of RDF.\n\nA typical example of an rdfs:Class is foaf:Person in the Friend of a Friend (FOAF) vocabulary. An instance of foaf:Person is a resource that is linked to the class foaf:Person using the rdf:type property, such as in the following formal expression of the natural-language sentence : 'John is a Person'.\n\n \"ex:John rdf:type foaf:Person\"\n\nThe definition of rdfs:Class is recursive: rdfs:Class is the class of classes, and so it is an instance of itself.\n\n\"rdfs:Class rdf:type rdfs:Class\"\n\nThe other classes described by the RDF and RDFS specifications are:\n\nProperties are instances of the class rdf:Property and describe a relation between subject resources and object resources.

Rosenthal, 40 Cal.4th 33 (2006), was a California Supreme Court case concerning online defamation. The case resolved a defamation claim brought by Stephen Barrett, Terry Polevoy, and attorney Christopher Grell against Ilena Rosenthal and several others. Barrett and others alleged that the defendants had republished libelous information about them on the internet. In a unanimous decision, the court held that Rosenthal was a \"user of interactive computer services\" and therefore immune from liability under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.\n\nThe California Supreme Court reversed a judgment by the California Court of Appeals, First District, which would have allowed a trial on one of the defamation claims. The lower court's decision was the first opinion to break from \"Zeran v. America Online, Inc.\" by holding that Section 230 immunity was \"not\" absolute for common law distributors. In reversing the Court of Appeals, the California Supreme Court reaffirmed \"Zeran\" and directed that all claims against the defendants be dismissed.\n\nThe case concerns an e-mail sent by Tim Bolen, a publicist for alternative medicine practitioners. While working for Hulda Clark, Bolen distributed a missive online that attacked Stephen Barrett and Terry Polevoy, medical doctors who publicly criticize what they consider quackery. Among other things, Bolen's letter accused Polevoy of stalking a Canadian radio reporter and preventing her from airing a show about alternative medicine.\n\nOne of the people who came across Bolen's letter was Ilena Rosenthal, who runs an Internet-based support group for women who have medical problems which they believe to be caused by breast implants. Rosenthal reposted Bolen's letter on two alternative medicine newsgroups. Barrett contacted her, claiming that the letter was libelous and threatening a lawsuit if she did not remove it. Rosenthal subsequently re-posted Bolen's letter, with a copy of Barrett's threat.\n\nStephen Barrett, Terry Polevoy, and attorney Christopher Grell filed suit against Clark, Bolen, Rosenthal, and 100 John Doe defendants in November 2000 before Alameda County Superior Court Judge James A. Richman. The case was originally captioned \"Barrett v. Clark\". The defendants were accused of libel and conspiracy to libel, for publishing or republishing allegedly defamatory statements on the internet.\n\nRosenthal was represented by an attorney from the California Anti-SLAPP Project. Rosenthal moved to be stricken from the suit, citing Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act and California's Anti-SLAPP statute. It was uncontested that Rosenthal had published or republished the e-mail on the internet.\n\nThe trial court granted her motion, effectively dropping all of the claims against Rosenthal. In an unusually long 27-page written opinion, Judge Richman dismissed the case (against Rosenthal only) under the California anti-SLAPP statute, which is intended to stop lawsuits that are \"brought primarily to chill the valid exercise of the constitutional rights of freedom of speech and petition for redress of grievances.\" The court further ordered that all three plaintiffs pay Rosenthal's attorney's fees.\n\nThe appellate court upheld the dismissal against Grell and Barrett, but vacated the decision as against Polevoy. The court held that Section 230 did not protect Rosenthal for one statement she had reposted on two newsgroups, regarding Polevoy's alleged \"stalking\" of a Canadian talk show host. The court ruled that Rosenthal, as a \"distributor\", could be held liable under Section 230 for content republished after receiving notice of a potentially defamatory statement, just as vendors of traditional media can be.\n\nRosenthal petitioned the California Supreme Court to hear the case, and the court granted her petition for review in April 2004.\n\nThe California Supreme Court overturned the lower court in November 2006, in a landmark decision that is the first to interpret Section 230 defamation immunity as providing immunity to an individual internet \"user\" who is not a provider. The American Civil Liberties Union, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, and a number of internet corporations — including Google, Yahoo!, and AOL — filed briefs on behalf of the defendant, arguing that only the originator of a defamatory statement published on the internet could be held liable.\n\nIn the majority opinion, Justice Corrigan observed that the plain language of Section 230 shows that \"Congress did not intend for an internet user to be treated differently than an internet provider.\" Both had immunity from liability for the republication of defamatory content on the internet.\n\nThe court agreed that \"subjecting Internet service providers and users to defamation liability would tend to chill online speech.\" (citing \"Zeran v. America Online, Inc.\" (4th Cir. 1997) 129 F.3d 327, 331-333), which ruled that Internet users – unlike publishers – are not liable for posting online content. Moreover, the court agreed with Rosenthal in the interpretation of congressional intent:\nThe congressional intent of fostering free speech on the internet supported the extension of Section 230 immunity to active individual users. It is they who provide much of the 'diversity of political discourse,' the pursuit of 'opportunities for cultural development,' and the exploration of 'myriad avenues for intellectual activity' that the statute was meant to protect.\n\nHowever, the court also acknowledged that blanket immunity for the redistribution of defamatory statements on the Internet has \"disturbing implications.\" Although plaintiffs are free under Section 230 to sue the originator of a defamatory Internet publication, \"any further expansion of liability must await Congressional action.\"\n\nIn a concurring opinion, Justice Carlos Moreno also suggested that immunity would not extend to an online publisher or distributor who conspires with an original content provider to defame. However, in this case, there was provided no proof of a conspiracy to defame.\n\nBecause Barrett and Polevoy were public figures, to pursue their defamation claims they would have had to show by clear and convincing evidence that Rosenthal republished Bolen's statements with malice. While the court affirmed the lower court's dismissal of Barrett's claims (finding the statements in question to be non-actionable statements of opinion), the court also noted that the statements concerning Polevoy's alleged stalking may still be actionable if the plaintiff can show that Rosenthal knowingly republished a falsehood or a statement in reckless disregard of its truth. The court also affirmed the lower court's decision to award Rosenthal attorney's fees for prevailing on her anti-SLAPP motion to dismiss; however, the court directed that those fees be reduced to reflect its ruling to permit Polevoy to proceed with his libel claim.\n\n"}

{"id": "1984246", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1984246", "title": "CPython", "text": "CPython\n\nCPython is the reference implementation of the Python programming language. Written in C and Python, CPython is the default and most widely used implementation of the language.\n\nCPython can be defined as both an interpreter and a compiler as it compiles Python code into bytecode before interpreting it. It has a foreign function interface with several languages including C, in which one must explicitly write bindings in a language other than Python.\n\nA particular feature of CPython is that it makes use of a global interpreter lock (GIL) on each CPython interpreter process, which means that within a single process only one thread may be processing Python bytecode at any one time. This does not mean that there is no point in multithreading; the most common multi-threading scenario is where threads are mostly waiting on external processes to complete.\n\nFor example, imagine when three threads are servicing separate clients. One thread may be waiting for a client to reply, another may be waiting for a database query to execute, while the third thread is actually processing Python code.\n\nHowever the GIL does mean that CPython is not suitable for processes that implement CPU intensive algorithms in Python code that could potentially be distributed across multiple cores.\n\nIn real world applications, situations where the GIL is a significant bottleneck are quite rare. This is because Python is an inherently slow language and is generally not used for CPU-intensive or time-sensitive operations. Python is typically used at the top level and calls functions in libraries to perform specialized tasks. These libraries are generally not written in Python and Python code in another thread can be executed while a call to one of these underlying processes takes place. The non-Python library being called to perform the CPU-intensive task is not subject to the GIL and may concurrently execute many threads on multiple processors without restriction.\n\nConcurrency of Python code can only be achieved with separate CPython interpreter processes managed by a multitasking operating system. This complicates communication between concurrent Python processes, though the \"multiprocessing\" module mitigates this somewhat; it means that applications that really can benefit from concurrent Python-code execution can be implemented with a limited amount of overhead.\n\nThe presence of the GIL simplifies the implementation of CPython, and makes it easier to implement multi-threaded applications that do not benefit from concurrent Python code execution. However, without a GIL multiprocessing apps must make sure all common code is thread safe.\n\nAlthough many proposals have been made to eliminate the GIL, the general consensus has been that in most cases the advantages of the GIL outweigh the disadvantages; in the few cases were the GIL is a bottleneck, the application should be built around the multiprocessing structure.\n\nUnladen Swallow was an optimization branch of CPython, intended to be fully compatible and significantly faster. It aimed to achieve its goals by supplementing CPython's custom virtual machine with a just-in-time compiler built using LLVM.\n\nThe project had stated a goal of a speed improvement by a factor of five over CPython; this goal was not met.\n\nThe project was sponsored by Google, and the project owners, Thomas Wouters, Jeffrey Yasskin, and Collin Winter, are full-time Google employees, however most project contributors were not Google employees. Unladen Swallow was hosted on Google Code.\n\nLike many things regarding the Python language, the name Unladen Swallow is a Monty Python reference, specifically to the joke about the airspeed velocity of unladen swallows in \"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\".\n\nAlthough it fell short of all published goals, Unladen Swallow did produce some code which got added to the main Python implementation, such as improvements to the cPickle module.\n\nIn July 2010, some observers speculated on whether the project was dead or dying, since the 2009 Q4 milestone had not yet been released. The traffic on Unladen's mailing list had decreased from 500 messages in January 2010, to fewer than 10 in September 2010. It has also been reported that Unladen lost Google's funding. In November 2010, one of the main developers announced that \"Jeffrey and I have been pulled on to other projects of higher importance to Google\".\n\nThe 2009 Q4 development branch was created on 26 January 2010, but no advertising was made on the website. Further, regarding the long-term plans, and as the project missed the Python 2.7 release, a Python Enhancement Proposal (PEP) was accepted, which proposed a merge of Unladen Swallow into a special py3k-jit branch of Python's official repository. As of July 2010, this work was ongoing. This merging would have taken some time, since Unladen Swallow was originally based on Python 2.6 with which Python 3 broke compatibility (see Python 3000 for more details). However, the PEP was subsequently withdrawn.\n\nIn early 2011, it became clear that the project was stopped.\n\n\nSupported platforms include:\n\n\nPEP 11 lists platforms which are not supported in CPython by the Python Software Foundation.

{"id": "1984280", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1984280", "title": "Monsanto Canada Inc v Schmeiser", "text": "Monsanto Canada Inc v Schmeiser\n\nMonsanto Canada Inc v Schmeiser [2004] 1 S.C.R. 902, 2004 SCC 34 is a leading Supreme Court of Canada case on patent rights for biotechnology, between a Canadian canola farmer, Percy Schmeiser, and the agricultural biotechnology company Monsanto. The court heard the question of whether Schmeiser's intentionally growing genetically modified plants constituted \"use\" of Monsanto's patented genetically modified plant cells. By a 5-4 majority, the court ruled that it did. The Supreme Court also ruled 9-0 that Schmeiser did not have to pay Monsanto their technology use fee, damages or costs, as Schmeiser did not receive any benefit from the technology. The case drew worldwide attention and is widely misunderstood to concern what happens when farmers' fields are accidentally contaminated with patented seed. However, by the time the case went to trial, all claims of accidental contamination had been dropped; the court only considered the GM canola in Schmeiser's fields, which Schmeiser had intentionally concentrated and planted. Schmeiser did not put forward any defence of accidental contamination.\n\nThe biotechnology company Monsanto developed and patented a glyphosate-resistant gene for the canola plant which has the effect of producing canola that is resistant to glyphosate. Monsanto marketed the seed as Roundup Ready Canola. Farmers using the system are able to control weed competition using Roundup, while avoiding damage to the Roundup-resistant crops. Users are required to enter into a formal agreement with Monsanto, which specifies that new seed must be purchased every year, the purchase price of which includes a licensing fee to use the patent rights. Roundup Ready Canola was introduced in Canada in 1996, and by 1998, it accounted for 25% of the country's canola area.\n\nAs established in the original Federal Court trial decision, Percy Schmeiser, a canola breeder and grower in Bruno, Saskatchewan, first discovered Roundup-resistant canola in his crops in 1997. He had used Roundup herbicide to clear weeds around power poles and in ditches adjacent to a public road running beside one of his fields, and noticed that some of the canola which had been sprayed had survived. Schmeiser then performed a test by applying Roundup to an additional to of the same field. He found that 60% of the canola plants survived. At harvest time, Schmeiser instructed a farmhand to harvest the test field. That seed was stored separately from the rest of the harvest, and used the next year to seed approximately 1,000 acres (4 km²) of canola.\n\nAt the time, Roundup Ready canola was in use by several farmers in the area. Schmeiser claimed that he did not plant the initial Roundup Ready canola in 1997, and that his field of custom-bred canola had been accidentally contaminated. While the origin of the plants on Schmeiser's farm in 1997 remains unclear, the trial judge found that with respect to the 1998 crop, \"none of the suggested sources [proposed by Schmeiser] could reasonably explain the concentration or extent of Roundup Ready canola of a commercial quality\" ultimately present in Schmeiser's 1998 crop.\n\nIn 1998, Monsanto learned that Schmeiser was growing a Roundup-resistant crop and approached him to sign a license agreement to their patents and to pay a license fee. Schmeiser refused, maintaining that the 1997 contamination was accidental and that he owned the seed he harvested, and he could use the harvested seed as he wished because it was his physical property. Monsanto then sued Schmeiser for patent infringement, filing its case in Canadian federal court on August 6, 1998. Negotiations to settle the matter collapsed on August 10, 1999, leading Schmeiser to file a countersuit against Monsanto for $10 million for libel, trespass, and contaminating his fields.\n\nRegarding the question of patent rights and the farmer's right to use seed taken from his fields, Monsanto said that because they hold a patent on the gene, and on canola cells containing the gene, they have a legal right to control its use, including the intentional replanting of seed collected from plants with the gene which grew accidentally. Schmeiser insisted on his \"farmer's rights\" to do anything he wished with seeds harvested from any plants grown on his field - including plants from seeds that were accidentally sown - and that this tangible property right overrides Monsanto's patent rights.\n\nCanadian law does not mention any such \"farmer's rights\"; the court held that the farmer's right to save and replant seeds is simply the right of a property owner to use his or her property as he or she wishes, and hence the right to use the seeds is subject to the same legal restrictions on use rights that apply in any case of ownership of property, including restrictions arising from patents in particular. The court wrote: \"Thus a farmer whose field contains seed or plants originating from seed spilled into them, or blown as seed, in swaths from a neighbour's land or even growing from germination by pollen carried into his field from elsewhere by insects, birds, or by the wind, may own the seed or plants on his land even if he did not set about to plant them. He does not, however, own the right to the use of the patented gene, or of the seed or plant containing the patented gene or cell.\"\n\nBeginning with the lead-up to the initial Federal Court trial, the case drew widespread public attention and media coverage. The contest was portrayed by some as a classic David-and-Goliath confrontation between small farmer and Monsanto, while others portrayed it as theft of the results of years of research and development. Environmental groups and anti-genetic engineering activists championed Schmeiser's cause and he spoke on the case around the world. Others depicted the case as a contest between a large biotechnology company and an equally large and well funded anti-biotechnology industry and raised concerns that the facts and context of the case was being misrepresented by Schmeiser, environmental groups and anti-genetic engineering activists.\n\n\"Monsanto v. Schmeiser\" was portrayed as being part of the process of legally defining the bounds of new biotechnologies, including genetic engineering and ownership of higher lifeforms. The case was frequently connected with that of the so-called Harvard mouse, where in 2002 the Canadian Supreme Court had rejected a patent for a special breed of mouse developed for research by Harvard University. The Canadian Harvard mouse case was a precedent-setting case in Canada with regard to the right to own higher lifeforms, where the Canadian ruling went against findings in the US and Europe, where the Harvard mouse patent was upheld. The Canadian Supreme Court eventually took pains to point out that the Monsanto v Schmeiser case focused on genes in seeds, and not on higher life forms; it was \"the first in which the top court of any country has ruled on patent issues involving plants and seed genes.\"\n\nThe issues of patent infringement and \"farmer's rights\" were settled, in Monsanto's favour, at the trial before the Federal Court of Canada and upheld at the appeal level before the Federal Court of Appeal. Both courts found that a key element in Mr. Schmeiser's patent infringement in his 1998 crop was that he knew or ought to have known the nature of the glyphosate-resistant seed he saved and planted.\n\nThe case was initially tried on June 5, 2000, in the Federal Court of Canada, at Saskatoon, Saskatchewan.\n\nAll claims relating to Roundup Ready canola in Schmeiser's 1997 canola crop were dropped prior to trial and the court only considered the canola in Schmeiser's 1998 fields. Regarding his 1998 crop, Schmeiser did not put forward any defence of accidental contamination. The evidence showed that the level of Roundup Ready canola in Mr. Schmeiser's 1998 fields was 95-98%. Evidence was presented indicating that such a level of purity could not occur by accidental means. On the basis of this the court found that Schmeiser had either known \"or ought to have known\" that he had planted Roundup Ready canola in 1998. Given this, the question of whether the canola in his fields in 1997 arrived there accidentally was ruled to be irrelevant. Nonetheless, at trial, Monsanto was able to present evidence sufficient to persuade the Court that Roundup Ready canola had probably not appeared in Schmeiser's 1997 field by such accidental means (paragraph 118). The court said it was persuaded \"on the balance of probabilities\" (the standard of proof in civil cases, meaning \"more probable than not\" i.e. strictly greater than 50% probability) that the Roundup Ready canola in Mr. Schmeiser's 1997 field had not arrived there by any of the accidental means, such as spillage from a truck or pollen travelling on the wind, that Mr. Schmeiser had proposed.\n\nIn the public arena, Schmeiser supporters argued that his account still leaves open the possibility that the harvesting and replanting of Roundup Ready canola from the sprayed region was accidental and resulted from a miscommunication between Schmeiser and his farmhand, or from a failure of Schmeiser to have the presence of mind to instruct his farmhand to avoid taking canola seed for replanting from the sprayed region. Supporters of Monsanto argued that an oversight of this nature is not plausible, especially in light of Schmeiser's claims regarding the extent to which he considered Roundup Ready canola undesirable in his fields and the importance he claims to have placed on the continued survival of his own strain of canola, and in light of his having been notified prior to planting his 1998 crop that Monsanto believed he had grown Roundup Ready canola in 1997. Legally, an oversight of this nature is not a defence against patent infringement, and was therefore irrelevant. Patents are civil law, and the presence or absence of \"guilty intent\" is not a factor in determining patent infringement. On this point, the Federal Court of Appeal noted that accidental genetic contamination of a crop beyond a farmer's control should be an exception to the rule that intent is not an issue in patent disputes.\n\nThe Court's ruling concluded:\n\nThe case was then heard by the Federal Court of Appeal at Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, beginning May 15, 2002. The Federal Court of Appeal upheld the ruling of the trial judge.\n\nThe Federal Court of Appeal in particular stressed the importance of the finding that Schmeiser had knowingly used the seed, in their decision to find Schmeiser in infringement of the patent, and noted that in a case of accidental contamination or a case where the farmer knew of the presence of the gene but took no action to increase its prevalence in his crop, a different ruling could be possible (see paragraphs 55-58 of the appeal ruling). No damages were assessed against Percy Schmeiser, the private individual. Only Mr. Schmeiser's farming corporation, Schmeiser Enterprises Ltd., was held liable, as Mr. Schmeiser had acted in his capacity as director of the corporation.\n\nLeave was requested of the Supreme Court of Canada to hear the case. This was granted in May, 2003, and the trial began on January 20, 2004. The issue before the Supreme Court was whether Schmeiser's planting and cultivation of genetically modified canola constituted \"use\" of Monsanto's patented invention of genetically modified canola cells.\n\nIntervening on Schmeiser’s behalf were a consortium of six non-government organizations (Council of Canadians; Action Group on Erosion, Technology and Concentration; Sierra Club; National Farmers Union; Research Foundation for Science, Technology and Ecology; and the International Center for Technology Assessment) and the Attorney General of Ontario.\n\nSchmeiser's principal defense at trial was that as he had not applied Roundup herbicide to his canola he had not used the invention. This argument was rejected; the court said that the patent granted for the invention did not specify the use of Roundup as part of the invention, and thus there was no basis for introducing the requirement that Roundup had to be used in order for the invention to be used. That is, a patent prohibits unauthorized use of an invention in any manner, not merely unauthorized use for its intended purpose.\n\nThe Court considered the question of whether knowingly (or, where one ought to have known) planting and cultivating genetically modified canola constitutes \"use\" of Monsanto's patented invention of genetically modified canola cells, even if the crop is not treated with Roundup and the presence of the gene affords no advantage to the farmer. The court ruled in favour of Monsanto, holding that his use of the patented genes and cells was analogous to the use of a machine containing a patented part: \"It is no defense to say that the thing actually used was not patented, but only one of its components.\" (Supreme Court Decision, Paragraph 78) The court also held that by planting genetically modified Roundup resistant canola, Schmeiser made use of the \"stand-by\" or insurance utility of the invention. That is, he left himself the option of using Roundup on the crop should the need arise. This was considered to be analogous to the installation of patented pumps on a ship: even if the pumps are never actually switched on, they are still used by being available for pumping if the need arises.\n\nOn May 21, 2004, the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 in favor of Monsanto. Schmeiser won a partial victory, where the court held that he did not have to pay Monsanto his profits from his 1998 crop, since the presence of the gene in his crops had not afforded him any advantage and he had made no profits on the crop that were attributable to the invention. The amount of profits at stake was relatively small, C$19,832; however, by not having to pay damages, Schmeiser was also saved from having to pay Monsanto's legal bills, which amounted to several hundred thousand dollars and exceeded his own.\n\nThe majority was written by McLachlin C.J. with Major, Binnie, Deschamps and Fish JJ. concurring.\n\nThe Court dismissed the argument that \"use\" of patented cells or genes applied only in the context of their isolated form. Nor does the fact that Schmeiser did not use Roundup herbicide on his crops preclude \"use\" of the gene. Even though the plants propagate without human intervention the realities of modern agriculture mean there is always human intervention in the growth of plants and thus farming is a method of \"use\" of plant genes.\n\nThe Court ruled that Schmeiser deprived Monsanto of its monopoly on the special canola plant by storing and planting the Roundup Ready canola seeds pursuant to his commercial interests. Thus, Schmeiser is considered to have infringed section 42 of the Patent Act. The Court, however, disagreed with the damages given by the trial judge as there was no profit directly resulting from the invention itself.\n\nIn the ruling, the court made it clear that patent infringement was the sole consideration, and concerns related to genetic engineering in agriculture were not within the scope of the case:\n\nArbour J., writing for Iacobucci, Bastarache, and LeBel JJ., dissented in part. The reasoning of the dissent closely follows that of the majority in \"Harvard College v. Canada (Commissioner of Patents)\" that concluded that though a company can patent products and processes, they cannot patent higher forms of life such as the whole plant itself. That is, \"the plant cell claim cannot extend past the point where the genetically modified cell begins to multiply and differentiate into plant tissues, at which point the claim would be for every cell in the plant\" (para. 138), which would extend the patent too far. The patent can only be for the founder plant and not necessarily its offspring.\n\nThe courts at all three levels noted that the case of accidental contamination beyond the farmer's control was not under consideration but rather that Mr. Schmeiser's action of having identified, isolated and saved the Roundup-resistant seed placed the case in a different category. The appellate court also discussed a possible intermediate scenario, in which a farmer is aware of contamination of his crop by genetically modified seed, but tolerates its presence and takes no action to increase its abundance in his crop. The court held that whether such a case would constitute patent infringement remains an open question but that it was a question that did not need to be decided in the Schmeiser case.(Paragraph 57 of the Appeals Court Decision)\n\nThe ruling did increase the protection available to biotechnology companies in Canada, a situation which had been left open with the Harvard mouse decision, where it was determined that a \"higher lifeform\", such as an animal, or by extension a plant, cannot be patented. This put Canada at odds with the other G8 countries where the patent had been granted. In Monsanto vs. Schmeiser, it was determined that protection of a patented gene or cell extends to its presence in a whole plant, even while the plant itself, as a higher lifeform, cannot be patented. This majority view, based on the precedent of mechanical devices, was central to the Supreme Court's decision, and put the onus on the Canadian Parliament to make distinctions between machines and lifeforms as it saw fit.\n\nIn 2005, a \"documentary theatre\" production dramatizing the court battle, entitled \"Seeds\", by Annabel Soutar, was staged in Montreal, Quebec. The dialogue was derived entirely verbatim from various archival sources.\n\nThe case is widely cited or referenced by the anti-GM community in the context of a fear of a company claiming ownership of a farmer’s crop based on the inadvertent presence of GM pollen grain or seed. \"The court record shows, however, that it was not just a few seeds from a passing truck, but that Mr Schmeiser was growing a crop of 95–98% pure Roundup Ready plants, a commercial level of purity far higher than one would expect from inadvertent or accidental presence. The judge could not account for how a few wayward seeds or pollen grains could come to dominate hundreds of acres without Mr Schmeiser’s active participation, saying ‘. . .none of the suggested sources could reasonably explain the concentration or extent of Roundup Ready canola of a commercial quality evident from the results of tests on Schmeiser’s crop’\" - in other words, even if the original presence of Monsanto seed on his land in 1997 was inadvertent, the crop in 1998 was entirely purposeful.\n\n"}

Warren\n\nFrancis Emroy Warren (June 20, 1844November 24, 1929) was an American politician of the Republican Party best known for his years in the United States Senate representing Wyoming and being the first Governor of Wyoming. A soldier in the Union Army during the American Civil War, he was the last veteran of that conflict to serve in the U.S. Senate.\n\nWarren was born on June 20, 1844 in Hinsdale, Berkshire County, Massachusetts and grew up attending common schools and his local Hinsdale Academy.\n\nDuring the civil war, Warren served in the 49th Massachusetts Infantry as a noncommissioned officer. At the age of nineteen at the siege of Port Hudson, Warren received the Medal of Honor for battlefield gallantry. His entire platoon was destroyed by Confederate bombardment and Warren, taking a serious scalp wound, disabled the artillery. Warren later served as a captain in the Massachusetts Militia.\n\nRank and Organization: Corporal, Company C, 49th Massachusetts Infantry.\n\nPlace and Date: At Port Hudson, La., 27 May 1863.\n\nEntered Service At: Hinsdale, Mass.\n\nBirth: Hinsdale, Mass.\n\nDate Of Issue: 30 September 1893.\n\nCitation:\nFrancis E. Warren married Helen Smith, a woman from Massachusetts, although all of their married life until his first election to the United States Senate, in 1890, was spent in Wyoming. They had two children, a daughter, Helen Frances, and a son, Frederick Emory. Helen Warren was the wife of General John J. Pershing. Mrs. Warren was the president of church, literary and charitable societies of Cheyenne, vice-president of the Foundling Hospital, and Daughter of the American Revolution.\nFollowing the civil war, Warren engaged in farming and stock-raising in Massachusetts before moving to Wyoming (then part of the Territory of Dakota) in 1868. Settling in Cheyenne, Warren engaged in real estate, mercantile business, livestock raising and the establishment of Cheyenne's first lighting system, becoming quite wealthy.\n\nWarren's political work included: member, Wyoming Territorial Senate (1873–1874, 1884–1885), serving as senate president; member, Cheyenne City Council (1873–1874); treasurer of Wyoming (1876, 1879, 1882, 1884); and Mayor of Cheyenne (1885).\n\nIn February 1885, Warren was appointed Governor of the Territory of Wyoming by President Chester A. Arthur, although he was removed by Democratic President Grover Cleveland in November 1886. He was reappointed by President Benjamin Harrison in April, 1889, and served until 1890, when he was elected first Governor of Wyoming (October 11, 1890 – November 24, 1890).\n\nIn November 1890, Warren resigned as governor, having been elected to the United States Senate as a Republican, serving until March 4, 1893. He then resumed his former business pursuits before returning to the senate (March 4, 1895–November 24, 1929). Warren chaired the following Senate Committees:\n\nWarren died on November 24, 1929 in Washington, D.C. His funeral service was held in the United States Senate chamber. At the time of his death, he had served longer than any other US Senator.\n\nF. E. Warren Air Force Base in Cheyenne, Wyoming is named after Warren. Additionally, Warren's daughter married then-Captain John J. Pershing in 1905. Several years later, President Theodore Roosevelt promoted Pershing from captain to brigadier general over 900 senior officers. Pershing's wife and three daughters were later killed during a fire at the Presidio in San Francisco. Warren was also the first senator to hire a female staffer and, as appropriations chairman during World War I, he was instrumental in funding the American efforts. Warren and his second wife, Clara LaBarron Morgan, bought the Nagle Warren Mansion in April, 1910, and their dining room hosted people such as Presidents Teddy Roosevelt and William Howard Taft. This mansion is now listed on the National Register of Historic Places. In 1958, he was inducted into the Hall of Great Westerners of the National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum.\n\n\n Retrieved on 2008-02-01\n"}
{"id": "1984288", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1984288", "title": "Roger of Lauria", "text": "Roger of Lauria\n\nRoger of Lauria (\"c\". 1245 – 17 January 1305) was an Italian admiral in Aragonese service, who was the commander of the fleet of the Crown of Aragon during the War of the Sicilian Vespers. He was probably the most successful and talented naval tactician of the medieval period. He is known as Ruggero or Ruggiero di Lauria in Italian and Roger de Llúria in Catalan.\n\nRoger of Lauria was born at Lauria or Scalea in southern Italy, the son of Richard of Lauria, Great Justiciar of the Kingdom of Sicily, and Donna Bella, a nurse of Constance of Sicily. His father had served under King Manfred of Sicily, a Hohenstaufen; when the last member of that family, Conradin of Swabia, was beheaded at Naples in 1268, he took refuge with other Ghibelline exiles at Barcelona, part of the Crown of Aragón with his mother.\n\nLater King Peter III of Aragon, who had married Constance of Hohenstaufen, made him knight together with Corrado Lancia, who was to be a comrade of Roger in many of his enterprises. In 1282, Roger was named commander of the Aragonese fleet, keeping this post under Peter's successors James II and Frederick III.\n\nRoger of Lauria commanded the Aragonese fleet during the campaign to capture Sicily from the Angevins after the Sicilian Vespers revolt in 1282, which made the Aragonese rulers of Sicily. He fought and won six naval galley battles in total. On 8 July 1283, he defeated the Angevins in the Grand Harbour at the Battle of Malta. On 5 June 1284, he defeated the Neapolitan fleet at the Battle of Castellammare and even captured the enemy commander, Charles of Salerno (the future Charles II of Naples).\n\nOn 4 September 1285, during the Aragonese Crusade, he defeated the French near Barcelona at the Battle of Les Formigues, which destroyed for a long time the French naval power in the Mediterranean. Within days, he had landed and taken part in the Battle of the Col de Panissars. On 23 June 1287, he again defeated the Angevins near Naples at the Battle of the Counts, despite being outnumbered forty ships to eighty. After this victory, without any authorisation from King James, he made a truce with the Neapolitans. Observers noted that this truce probably deprived the Aragonese-Sicilians of the victory also on the mainland.\n\nWhen Frederick III was elected King of Trinacria (Sicily), Roger received as reward for his victories the fief of Aci and the annexed castle, stripped from the bishops of Catania. However, the relationship between the admiral and the young King soon soured; when the former passed to the Angevins, Aci was besieged and captured by Frederick, and Roger took refuge at his summer residence in Castiglione di Sicilia. Again besieged and defeated, he was arrested and brought to Palermo. However, he managed to escape and left Sicily, while all his fiefs were confiscated. Roger then entered the service of Edward I of England to fight against the French. But, in spite of his promises, he returned to Italy, where, on 4 July 1299, he defeated the Sicilians near Sicily at the Battle of Cape Orlando, capturing eighteen enemy galleys.\n\nHe had another victory on 14 June 1300, the Battle of Ponza, in which he defeated and captured King Frederick himself. After the Peace of Caltabellotta, he submitted to Frederick and received a whole pardon. He retreated to Cocentaina in the Kingdom of Valencia, where he died in 1305.\n\nRoger was successful in naval warfare because of several skillful tactics. He tried to lure enemy fleets out of defended ports, pretending to retreat and getting them to chase him until they became disorganized, then turning in formation to attack. He had much more control over his captains than his foes did. His crews were made up of specialized troops, instead of the more generic types used by his enemies. His archers and crossbowmen were used initially, while his oarsmen and/or \"Almogavars\" (unarmored and highly mobile elite troops armed with two javelins, a lance and a dagger) stayed under cover. When his galleys closed, often from the sides of the enemy galleys (which damaged their oars), these skirmishers were much more agile than the heavily armored knights with swords his enemies often used, especially on the moving deck of a galley at sea. He used trickery to disguise the size of his force. In addition, he sometimes kept some of his galleys hidden, to attack the rear of the enemy after the battle had started.\n\nRoger was also infamous for ruthless sackings and devastation, often driven only by greed and personal advantage. On the other hand, his reputation alone possibly caused some enemies to lose heart during a battle.\n\nThe \"Regia Marina\" (Royal Navy) battleship \"Ruggiero di Lauria\", completed in 1888 and stricken in 1909, was named for Roger of Lauria.\n\nOne of the main paratrooper units of the Spanish airborne forces is named after him.\n\n"}

Libbey. Her father worked as a yardmaster for the Old Colony Railroad before becoming a salesman. Her parents separated when she was a toddler and Frederick was raised primarily by her mother to whom she remained close for the remainder of her life (her parents divorced around 1897). As a girl, she was fascinated with show business, and determined early to place her goals in the direction of the theater. She studied acting, singing and dancing at Miss Blanchard's Finishing School in Boston where she later graduated.\n\nHer father, however, discouraged her ambitions to be an actress and encouraged her to become an elocution teacher. After pursuing a career as an actress, her father disinherited her (he died in 1922). Due to her father's attitude towards her acting career, Pauline adopted the surname \"Frederick\" as her stage name. She legally changed her name to Pauline Frederick in 1908.\n\nShe made her stage debut at the age of 17 as a chorus girl in the farce \"The Rogers Brothers at Harvard\", but was fired shortly thereafter. She won other small roles on the stage before being discovered by illustrator Harrison Fisher who called her \"the purest American beauty.\" With Fisher's help, she landed more substantial stage roles. Nicknamed \"The Girl with the Topaz Eyes\", Fredrick was cast in the lead roles in the touring productions of \"The Little Gray Lady\" and \"The Girl in White\" in 1906. She briefly retired from acting after her first marriage in 1909, but returned to the stage in January 1913 in \"Joseph and His Brethren\".\n\nA well-known stage star, Frederick was already in her 30s when she made her film debut in 1915 as Donna Roma in \"The Eternal City\". In March 1927, she received some of her better reviews when she appeared in the play \"Madame X\" in London. Frederick was able to make a successful transition to \"talkies\" in 1929, and was cast as Joan Crawford's mother in \"This Modern Age\" (1931). Frederick did not like acting in sound films and returned to Broadway in 1932 in \"When the Bough Breaks\". She would continue the remainder of her career appearing in films and also touring in stage productions in the United States, Europe and Australia.\n\nFrederick's personal life was beset with marital and financial problems. Despite having reportedly made a million dollars for her work in silent films, Frederick filed for bankruptcy in 1933.\n\nFrederick was married five times. In 1909, she married architect Frank Mills Andrews. Frederick then briefly retired from acting, but returned upon divorcing Andrews in 1913. She married her second husband, playwright Willard Mack, on September 27, 1917. They divorced in August 1920. Her third husband was Dr. Charles A. Rutherford, a physician, whom she married in Santa Ana, California in 1922. Frederick filed for divorce in December 1924. Their divorce was finalized on January 6, 1925.\n\nIt was around this time that the then 43-year-old first met the much younger Clark Gable, then a struggling actor, with whom she allegedly had a two-year affair.\n\nFrederick married her fourth husband, millionaire hotel and Interstate News Company owner Hugh Chisholm Leighton (1878-1942) on April 20, 1930 in New York City. Leighton had the marriage annulled in December 1930 claiming that he was Frederick's husband \"in name only\". \n\nFrederick's fifth marriage, in January 1934, was to an ailing United States Army colonel, Joseph A. Marmon, commander of the 16th Infantry Regiment. They remained married until Marmon's death on December 4, 1934.\n\nOn January 17, 1936, Frederick underwent emergency surgery on her abdomen. Her health steadily declined, which limited her ability to work. She was dealt a further blow when her mother died in 1937.\n\nOn September 16, 1938, Frederick suffered an asthma attack. She suffered a second, fatal asthma attack on September 19, 1938 while she was recuperating at her aunt's home in Beverly Hills. According to her wishes, a private funeral was held on September 23 in Hollywood, after which she was buried at Grand View Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California.\n\nFor her contribution to the motion picture industry, Pauline Frederick has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 7000 Hollywood Boulevard.\n\n"}

Herlong is located at the extreme eastern edge of the Sierra Nevada Mountain Range in the southeastern region of Honey Lake Valley, north of Doyle, at an elevation of . Herlong is located in southern Lassen County near the southeast edge of Honey Lake, about north of Reno, Nevada, and about south of Susanville, the county seat. The community is accessible to U.S. Route 395 via Lassen County Route A25 or Lassen County Route A26.\n\nHerlong was developed in 1942 after the attack on Pearl Harbor during World War II, to house civilian workers to support the Sierra Army Depot, one of several ammunition storage facilities located inland in order to be safe from Japanese attack. The site also met the requirement of being a dry and isolated area. The community was named after Captain Henry W. Herlong, the first United States Army ordnance officer to die in World War II. The postal stamps, money orders and equipment bore the spelling \"Hurlong\", which lasted for about five days; the error was discovered and corrected.\n\nIn the 21st century, Sierra Army Depot serves as the Army's End of First Life Center and the CONUS-based Army Prepositioned Stock Site. It continues to provide expeditionary logistics support and long-term sustainment solutions.\n\nSince its beginning, the town has varied in size. Its population peaked at about 5,000 in the 1950s, consisting mostly of civilian employees on the base and their families. As of the 2010 census, the community had 298 people.\n\nHerlong has several churches, including the Bible Baptist Church, Assembly of God, and Southern Baptist. The State Office of Historic Preservation lists 62 historic properties in Herlong on its Historic Properties Data File for Lassen County. This is one of the last counties in the American West that is still considered to be \"open range\" land.\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , all land.\n\nThis region experiences warm (but not hot) and dry summers, with no average monthly temperatures above 71.6 °F. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Herlong has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate, abbreviated \"Csb\" on climate maps.\n\nThe 2010 United States Census reported that Herlong had a population of 298. The population density was 183.0 people per square mile (70.7/km²).

McLenaghen (September 4, 1891 – June 23, 1950) was a politician in Manitoba, Canada. He served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1927 until his death, and was a cabinet minister in the governments of John Bracken, Stuart Garson and Douglas Campbell.\n\nThe son of John McLenaghen and Elisabeth McIlquhan, McLenaghen was born in Balderson, Ontario, where he was educated until 1902; afterwards he went to school in Portage la Prairie, Manitoba. He later attained a Bachelor of Arts degree from Manitoba University, and worked as a barrister-of-law, after studying in the office of future Prime Minister Arthur Meighen. McLenaghen was called to the Manitoba bar in 1918. In 1919, he married Catherine Newman.\n\nMcLenaghen became active in the Conservative Party of Manitoba, and sought election to the provincial legislature for Kildonan and St. Andrews in the 1927 provincial election. He was successful, defeating Liberal W.H. Gibbs and a candidate aligned with the governing Progressive Party. He was re-elected in the 1932 election, defeating Gibbs (now a candidate of the merged \"Liberal-Progressive\" alliance) by 39 votes.\n\nMcLenaghen was returned by an increased majority in the 1936 provincial election, the first in which the Conservative Party was led by Errick Willis. Four years later, he helped to bring the Conservative Party into a governing alliance with the Liberal-Progressives, along with the smaller Cooperative Commonwealth Federation and Social Credit parties. All parties were given cabinet representation, and McLenaghen was appointed as Minister of Health and Public Welfare on November 4, 1942. The coalition's leader was Premier John Bracken, leader of the Liberal-Progressive Party.\n\nOn May 3, 1941, McLenaghen was appointed as the province's Attorney General. He left the Health portfolio on February 11, 1944, but continued to serve as Attorney General of Manitoba until his death. On December 14, 1948, he was also given the title Minister under the Trade Practices Enquiry Act. He also served as Minister of Labour from February 5, 1944 until February 14, 1946.\n\nAfter joining the coalition government, McLenaghen did not face electoral competition from Liberal-Progressive candidates. He was re-elected in 1941, 1945 Manitoba general election and 1949 over candidates of the CCF, though in 1945 he almost lost the coalition nomination to Frank Simmonds.\n\nMcLenaghen was known as a likeable figure, though essentially conservative on policy matters. Like other Attorneys-General in the coalition government, he refused to devote crown resources to prison reform during the 1940s. He was also an influential figure in the Conservative Party, and frequently defended the coalition against other Tories who saw it as detrimental to party interests. His death in 1950 deprived the pro-coalition forces in the party of their most powerful voice, and the Conservatives in fact left the coalition soon after.\n"}
{"id": "1984325", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1984325", "title": "Kokkina", "text": "Kokkina\n\nKokkina ( []; or ) is a coastal exclave (pene-exclave) of the \"de facto\" Northern Cyprus, and a former Turkish Cypriot village and enclave in Cyprus. It is surrounded by mountainous territory, with the Morphou Bay on its northern flank. Kokkina sits several kilometres west of the Northern Cyprus mainland and is a place with symbolic significance to Turkish Cypriots, because of the events of August 1964 (cf. Battle of Tillyria). In 1976, all Kokkina inhabitants were transferred to Gialousa (renamed \"Yeni Erenköy\" or \"New Erenköy\" in Turkish) and the exclave has since functioned as a North Cyprus Defence Force military camp.\n\nThe Tylliria/Dillirga region, where Kokkina is situated, had been a place of intense confrontation between the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities during the inter-communal struggle of 1963–1964. On 4 April 1964, armed groups originating from both communities had fought over a strategic location overlooking the region's only highway. There had also been several sporadic incidents of gunfire between villages of the region. On 8 April 1964, the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) managed to arrange a ceasefire which was enforced by stationing UNFICYP troops at several critical points.\n\nThe government of the Republic of Cyprus viewed Kokkina as a point of insertion for Turkish paramilitaries and weaponry in Cyprus because about 500 Turkish Cypriot volunteers who had been trained and armed in Turkey had landed there. So, on 6 August 1964, elements of the Greek Cypriot National Guard and Greek Army units led by General George Grivas attacked the area around Kokkina and surrounded the village forcing its defenders and the civilian population to retreat to a narrow beachhead. The defenders consisted of elements of the Turkish Resistance Organization and a number of the volunteers mentioned above. A heavy artillery barrage (with naval support) of the beachhead followed causing a number of casualties and heavy damage to the village.\n\nThe defenders, while completely out-powered and lacking supplies, managed to hold their positions until 8 August when Turkey decided to intervene. The threat of a Turkish military escalation and a resolution of the United Nations Security Council calling for a ceasefire, ended the stand-off. A ceasefire was declared on 9 August 1964 and UNFICYP forces were once again deployed to the area.\n\nTurkey claimed that the aerial attack and threat of further intervention were justified by her right to protect the Turkish Cypriot population under the 1960 Treaty of Guarantee. The village was heavily damaged by the artillery barrage and UN forces declared it a disaster area and brought in much-needed supplies for the civilians.\n\nSince December 1963, thousands of Turkish Cypriots became concentrated in enclaves, as a result of the intercommunal fighting (see Cyprus dispute). Kokkina was one of the last port areas under Turkish Cypriot control and a vital supply link with Turkey for Turkish Cypriot fighters.\n\nIn the eyes of the Greek Cypriot authorities, Kokkina was a threat to the nation's security posed by Turkish Cypriot paramilitaries and cutting it off would have severed Turkish Cypriot armed groups from resupply and reinforcement.\n\nWhen the Turkish military staged their operation in Cyprus in 1974, Kokkina was a specific objective. The exclave became part of the \"Turkish Federated State of North Cyprus\" in 1975, then part of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus when it declared UDI in November 1983. However, this declaration of independence was condemned as legally invalid by United Nations Security Council Resolution 541 (1983) and has yet to be recognized by any sovereign state except Turkey.\n\nWithin the exclave at the village cemetery, there are 13 carefully tended graves of Turkish Cypriots who were killed at the siege at Kokkina. The village itself still carries heavy battle damage. A museum memorializing the defenders and the North Cypriot military (Security Forces Command) is also at the village. Kokkina is the site of annual memorial ceremonies attended by high-ranking dignitaries of both the TRNC and Turkish governments. On Greek Cypriot maps, the village is referred to by its Greek name of Kokkina.\n\n"}

After a brief stint at France's RC Strasbourg, he played for Alemannia Aachen in Germany until his retirement in 2010.\n\nNémeth is the second-highest scorer in the history of the Slovakia national football team, with 22 goals in 58 matches from 1997 to 2006.\n\nNémeth started his career with Slovan Bratislava before moving to eastern Slovakia to join 1. FC Košice. At both clubs he played well, he moved to giants of the region, Czech team Sparta Prague for record fee 35 million CZK (€1.3 million) \n\nFrom here he moved back to Slovakia with one of the top teams in the country, Inter Bratislava. He won consecutive Slovak Super Liga titles in 1999–2000 and 2000–01, finishing as top-scorer in both.\n\nAmid rumoured interest from Inter Milan, he eventually signed for English side Middlesbrough on 12 April 2001 for £2.1 million on a five-year contract. Earlier that season, he had a trial at their local rivals Sunderland.\n\nNémeth scored 23 goals in 117 Premier League appearances for the club. He became known as the \"Lizard King of Teesside\" and \"Slovakian Express\" for scoring regularly off the bench. Németh was part of Middlesbrough's 2004 League Cup-winning team, despite not making the squad for the final. He also featured as they contested the UEFA Cup in the next two seasons. During his time in the Premier League, he scored in wins over Chelsea, Manchester United, Liverpool and Tottenham Hotspur.\n\nThe 2005–06 season saw Németh turn down numerous transfer offers, including UEFA Cup winners CSKA Moscow. He faced competition up-front that season from Yakubu, Mark Viduka, Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink and Massimo Maccarone, leading to his exit in January.\n\nOn 25 January 2006, Németh was sold to French club RC Strasbourg for a 'nominal fee'.

The ITU-T has Withdrawn P.861 and replaced it with P.862 (PESQ) which contains an improved speech assessment algorithm.\n\nUsing the PSQM standard allows automated, simulation-based test methodologies to objectively rate both speech clarity and transmitted voice quality. Various software and/or hardware products have been developed to facilitate this testing. This results in considerable savings in cost and time over the traditional practice of using large groups of people to subjectively evaluate voice signals and assess voice quality. Moreover, it yields objective results that are reliable and reproducible. This is very important to telephony providers who are mandated to maintain high Quality of Service standards.\n\nPSQM uses a psychoacoustical mathematical modeling (both perceptual and cognitive) algorithm to analyze the pre and post transmitted voice signals, yielding a PSQM value which is a measure of signal quality degradation and ranges from 0 (no degradation) to 6.5 (highest degradation). In turn, this result may be translated into a mean opinion score (MOS), which is an accepted measure of the perceived quality of received media on a numeric scale ranging from 1 to 5. A value of 1 indicates unacceptable, poor quality voice while a value of 5 indicates high voice quality with no perceptible issues.\n\nThe PSQM algorithm converts the physical-domain signal(s) into the perceptually meaningful psychoacoustic domain through a series of nonlinear processes such as time-frequency mapping, frequency warping and intensity warping.\n\nThe quality of the coded speech is judged on the differences in the internal representation. The difference is used for the calculation of the noise disturbance as a function of time and frequency. Besides perceptual modeling, the PSQM algorithm uses cognitive modeling such as loudness scaling and asymmetric masking in order to get high correlations between subjective and objective measurements.\n\nPSQM as originally conceived was not developed to account for network Quality of Service perturbations common in Voice over IP applications, items such as packet loss, delay variance (jitter) or non-sequential packets. These conditions usually give inappropriate results under heavy network load simulations, failing to account for a very real perceived loss of voice quality. Attempts to duplicate network fault conditions by introducing significant packet loss result in PSQM values that correspond to falsely inflated MOS values.\n\nIn order to overcome this limitation, PSQM+ was developed by modifying the original algorithm. PSQM+ generates results that seem to more accurately reflect the adverse performance of under realistic network load conditions.\n\nOther issues involve the lack of standardization in test signals used to evaluate various . PSQM provides more reliable and consistent MOS values if used in accordance with ITU recommended methods for objective and subjective assessment of quality (ITU-T P.800/P.830/P.861). These recommendations include using both male and female gender voice reference signals at an average level of -20dB. The type, gender, duration, gain of the voice or signal can all have a minor impact on the PSQM value or MOS score as does the threshold levels, number of calls made and other configuration settings of the environment. When comparing voice quality measurements the signal, environment and configurations should all be taken into account.\n\nMany exist and are used in a wide variety of applications. Careful selection of appropriate speech codec(s) is necessary to match system requirements. A list of common and their associated PSQM/PSQM+ derived MOS values obtained under various network load conditions is available.\n\n\n"}

The closest village is Barnesville, located just over one mile from the foot of the mountain. The peak of this relatively low mountain is approximately 800 feet (244 m) higher than the surrounding farmland. It is visible from many parts of northern Montgomery County and southern Frederick County, notably from I-270 north of the town of Germantown. Because of its geological and natural history interest, it was designated a National Natural Landmark in 1969. It is a notable example of an admission-free (although donations are requested), privately owned scenic park.\n\nThe mountain was visited in 1712 by Christoph von Graffenried, 1st Baron of Bernberg and his French-Canadian guide, Martin Chartier. The Baron wrote:\n\nDuring the Maryland Campaign of the American Civil War in 1862, Union forces occupying the summit, which was being used as an observation and signal station, first spotted the Army of Northern Virginia on September 5 as it crossed the Potomac River into Maryland. The following morning as the small Union force on the mountain began to retreat in the face of the oncoming Confederate Army, they ran into the unsuspecting 1st North Carolina Infantry and a small skirmish ensued. The Union force was able to escape, but it was later caught by Confederate cavalry at Urbana.\n\nIn the early 20th century Chicago businessman Gordon Strong bought substantial land holdings on and around the mountain. In 1925, the architect Frank Lloyd Wright, on commission from Strong, proposed an automobile objective development for the top of the mountain, but that was never carried out.\n\nPresident Franklin D. Roosevelt, briefly considered using Sugarloaf as his Presidential retreat, but he was persuaded by Strong to choose the nearby Shang-Ri-La site on the Catoctin Mountain, which today is known as Camp David.\n\nStrong set up a trust fund in 1947 that maintains a trail system and other tourist facilities at Sugarloaf Mountain. The mountain and its immediate environs continue to be open to the public, but they are privately owned by Stronghold, Incorporated.\n\nSugarloaf Mountain is an example of a monadnock — an isolated hill or small mountain rising abruptly from gently sloping or level surrounding land. It appears to be either an outlier to the east of the main mass of Catoctin Mountain, or a root remnant of the ancient Appalachian land mass.\n\nThe bedrock is the Lower Cambrian Sugarloaf Mountain Quartzite, a massive white quartzite interbedded with softer sericitic quartzite, slate, and phyllite. The formation is divided into upper, middle, and lower members.\n\nSugarloaf Mountain is an area tourist attraction, free of an admission charge, and open to the public. Visitors are however encouraged to voluntarily donate $5. Activities include hiking, rock climbing, picnicking, and sightseeing. The mountain is known to locals for its scenic views.\nThe Sugarloaf Mountain Trail system is a popular network of trails that link the East Face with the West Face. The blue trail system is popular with hikers while the yellow trail system can also be used by bikers and horseback riders at designated times of the year. The Strong Mansion at the base of the mountain is often used for weddings and other special events, and the nearby Sugarloaf Mountain Vineyard is a popular side excursion.\n\n \n"}
{"id": "1984334", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1984334", "title": "Theodor Reik", "text": "Theodor Reik\n\nTheodor Reik (; 12 May 1888, Vienna – 31 December 1969, New York) was a psychoanalyst who trained as one of Freud's first students in Vienna, Austria, and was a pioneer of lay analysis in the United States.\n\nReik received a Ph.D. degree in psychology from the University of Vienna in 1912. His dissertation, a study of Flaubert's \"Temptation of Saint Anthony\", was only the second psychoanalytic dissertation ever written, coming one year after Otto Rank's. After receiving his doctorate, Reik devoted several years to studying with Freud.\n\nFreud financially supported Reik and his family during his psychoanalytic training. During this time, Reik was analyzed by Karl Abraham. Reik, who was Jewish, emigrated from Germany to the Netherlands in 1934 and to the United States in 1938 in flight from Nazism. In 1944, he became a naturalized citizen of the United States.\n\nDuring the First World War, Reik was mobilized and had to face up to the experience of unbearable helplessness found in trench-warfare. Out of that experience, Reik contributed to a paper of Freud, published in 1919, \"The Uncanny\" (referring, in part, to that which is horrifying); and some years later, in a text called \"The Dread\" written in 1924 and published in 1929. Reik makes a link between the various aspects of traumatic neurosis, as disseminated in the written papers of Freud, and suggests his own further analysis; Freud recognized the paper's pertinence. In a book, published in 1935, Reik discusses the dread of confronting thoughts, from the point of view of the psychoanalyst (Tréhel, G. 2012).\n\nWhen peace was finally restored, a committee directed by Julius Tandler was organized in Vienna to investigate committed felonies; Julius Wagner von Jauregg participated as a member. At that time, the medical practice in places directed by Wagner von Jauregg and Arnold had been discredited by a former patient, Walter Kauders. Sigmund Freud was appointed as an expert witness on the medical care provided for war neurotics. In February 1920, the committee gave its opinion and, in October 1920, formally presented its conclusions.\n\nAnother matter shook up the Austrian capital. In November 1924, asked Freud to write an expert evaluation about the question of lay analysis—that is, analysis practiced by individuals who are not medical doctors. In December 1924, during a session of the Vienna Health State Board, Wagner von Jauregg asked for a list of the institutions using psychoanalysis. Reik was identified as not medically certified. In February 1925, he was, by official decree, forbidden to continue practising medicine; and in 1926, Newton Murphy, Reik's former patient, turned against him, suing him for harmful treatment— Freud publicly took up Reik's defence, reacting by writing to Tandler. The two affairs presented similarities. Specifically, they took place during the same period and in the same city, Vienna; they each concerned the practice of caregivers; and they implicated the same individuals who were in authority.\n\nAmong those treated by Reik in his Viennese period was the philosopher Frank P. Ramsey, during a prolonged stay in Vienna for that purpose.\n\nOnce in the United States, Reik found himself rejected from the dominant community of medical psychoanalysts because he did not possess an M.D. degree. In response, he went on to found one of the first psychoanalytic training centers for psychologists, the National Psychological Association for Psychoanalysis, which remains one of the largest and best-known psychoanalytic training institutes in New York City.\n\nAs part of Reik's conflict with the medical psychoanalysis community, he participated in the first lawsuit which helped define and legitimize the practice of psychoanalysis by non-physicians. His legacy for non-medical psychoanalysis in the US is accordingly important: that the training of non-medical analysts, such as psychologists and social workers, is now largely accepted, is significantly due to Reik's efforts.\n\nReik is best known for psychoanalytic studies of psychotherapeutic listening, masochism, criminology, literature, and religion.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Often, she is described as a charismatic leading lady with high ticket power. Today she is renowned almost more for her presence as a musical actress than her days as a pop-icon and singer.\n\nShe debuted in the role of Aida as the lead role in 2005. Many praised her strong vocals but were intensely critical of acting as well as her status as a former k-pop idol. When she returned to the role again in 2010 she fell ill and was unable to make one of the shows. The production only featured a single cast and no understudies or standbys were used during the run. Due to this, the show was cancelled and many people complained at the oversight of the situation, Ock was then blamed for the incident despite the company being at fault. The following year she starred in Chicago and was met with better reviews saying that her acting had improved.\n\nIn 2010, she appeared in the Count of Monte Cristo in the main role of Mercedes. She appeared as the leading female role in the Korean adaptation of Das Musical: Elisabeth, opposite JYJ's Junsu in 2012.

She followed these acclaimed adaptations of European musical theater into a new role as \"Mrs. Danvers\" in the musical \"Rebecca,\" inspired by Hitchcock's movie of the same name. Playing a slightly unhinged and dark character, Ock showed a new side of herself and was rewarded with great popularity among audiences and received the 2013 Korean Musical Award for Best Actress in a supporting role.\n\nIn 2014, Ock starred as Elphaba in the first Korean production of \"Wicked the Musical\" and also reprises the role of Danvers in \"Rebecca\" due to its popularity in South Korea. Starting in November 2014 Ock began her role as Marie Antoinette, in the musical Marie Antoinette at Charlotte Theater in Seoul, South Korea.\n\nIn 2016, Ock starred in her first original role with Mata Hari. It was also the first original musical from EMK Musical Company which was created in collaboration with Frank Wildhorn. He had stated that she had been one of the main inspirations for the character and songs of Mata Hari, and had sung high praises of her performances in his other musicals such as The Count of Monte Cristo. She later reprised her role in the 2017 production which had since been revised.\n\nIn 2018, Ock was cast as Anna Karenina (along with Jeong Sun Ah) for the Korean premiere. Prior to that, she travelled to Russia to meet the cast and crew of the Russian production that was opening before her own run. She appeared at the curtain call for opening night, and sang a trio with Ekaterina Guseva (Anna Karenina) and Sergey Lee (Alexey Vronsky).\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> Note: Most, if not all, large scale Korean Musicals are generally double or triple cast for a role.

{"id": "1984344", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1984344", "title": "Gino Hernandez", "text": "Gino Hernandez\n\nCharles Eugene Wolfe Jr. (August 8, 1957 – February 2, 1986) was an American professional wrestler, better known by his ring name, Gino Hernandez. He is best known for his appearances with the Dallas, Texas-based promotion World Class Championship Wrestling between 1976 and 1986. Hernandez' death was initially ruled a homicide case, but police later concluded that he had died of a drug overdose.\n\nAs a rookie, babyface wrestler in Ed Farhat's Big Time Wrestling promotion in Detroit, \"Gino Hernandez\" was a very young, fresh-faced performer who got over with female fans due to his long black hair, and good looks. He won Big Time's top title (its version of the NWA United States Heavyweight Championship) by defeating \"Bulldog\" Don Kent. During this time, Wolfe also wrestled at least one match for WWE forerunner the World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF). Gino lost the (Detroit) U.S. Title to his real-life boss: The Sheik (Big Time Wrestling owner and booker Eddie Farhat's 'Psycho-Arab' heel persona).\n\nWolfe's Gino character -- nicknamed \"The Handsome Halfbreed\" -- started wrestling in 1975 in the San Antonio, Texas wrestling territory, Southwest Championship Wrestling (SCW), after being trained by Jose Lothario. He was initially in a tag-team with Lothario, then turned into a singles act via a \"protege vs. mentor\" storyline. The storyline feud with Lothario culminated in a \"hair vs. hair match\", which Hernandez lost -- having his head shaved in the ring, as a result.\n\nIn the late-1970s and early-1980s, Gino worked for Dallas-based territory, World Class Championship Wrestling (WCCW) (called NWA Big Time Wrestling, at the time). The highlight was a storyline feud with David Von Erich over the NWA Texas Heavyweight Championship, which Gino won and lost back to David.\n\nGino returned to SCW, forming a hugely popular tag-team (\"The Dynamic Duo\") with the territory owner's son, Tully Blanchard. Hernandez and Blanchard's tag-team act became so successful, they were the top (based on box office drawing power) heels in the state of Texas -- regardless of territory.\n\nIn 1982, Gino instigated a storyline feud with Chavo Guerrero by hitting him over the head with a beer bottle, and later insulting the Guerrero family name. This short-lived feud played out across multiple Texas territories.\n\nGino returned to WCCW in 1984, at different times individually or collectively feuding with the Von Erichs: Mike, Kevin and Kerry Von Erich. That summer, Gino was paired with Nickla Roberts, who was billed \"Andrea the Lady Giant\" (a'la Andre the Giant). The duo worked a series of mixed tag team matches against Sunshine and Mike Von Erich. Even Sunshine's aunt, Stella Mae French, was involved.\n\nGino was put in a tag team with WCCW newcomer Jake \"The Snake\" Roberts in August 1984. Gino also formed a tag-team with Chris Adams; WCCW called them \"The Dynamic Duo\", as SCW had Gino & Tully. This WCCW version proved the more famous, as Adams & Hernandez drew high revenues and television ratings for World Class in their feud with the Von Erichs.\n\nThe duo invented the famed \"gold scissors\" gimmick: snipping hair from the heads of their incapacitated opponents right after defeating them (a humiliation tactic meant to increase fans' anger toward the heels, increasing the heels' TV/live show drawing power). This gimmick was later used in the WWF by Brutus Beefcake.\n\nAdams & Hernandez lost a \"hair\" match to Kevin & Kerry Von Erich at a Cotton Bowl show on October 6, 1985. After the match, Hernandez attempted to escape, but was tackled by Chris Von Erich, who was at ringside, and eventually had his hair shaved bald. His hair quickly grew back in two months, while Adams' hair took longer.\n\nWith the Von Erichs storyline completed but the momentum from it still red-hot with fans, Gino was next booked to turn on Adams in December 1985. WCCW management intended this new feud to become its top storyline throughout 1986. On January 27, 1986, during a grudge match in Fort Worth, Hernandez threw \"freebird hair cream\" (a \"hair-removal product\" previously established in WCCW storyline continuity in 1983 by Freebird Buddy Roberts) into Adams' face, rendering Adams blind (in reality, Adams was returning to his native England to spend time with his new wife [Toni], and his family; however, WCCW told Adams he had to continue to \"sell\" the blindness whenever out in public).\n\nHernandez was scheduled to perform on a house show the following Thursday, and on a non-televised show at Dallas' Sportatorium the following Friday. After Gino no-showed both events, WCCW management's phone calls to him went unanswered.\n\nOn February 4, 1986, concerned with Wolfe's well-being, two WCCW officials (David Manning and Rick Hazzard) and several local police officers broke into his Highland Park, Texas condo, discovering Wolfe's decomposing corpse. He had been dead for approximately three to four days. Initially, Wolfe's death was ruled a homicide case; but following autopsy reports, his death was ruled the result of a cocaine overdose.\n\nWolfe's drug abuse (e.g., alcohol and cocaine, among others) was no secret to many World Class mainstays, including onscreen manager/one-time booker Gary Hart, who claimed to have repeatedly encouraged Wolfe to \"get clean\". In the DVD documentary \"The Triumph and Tragedy of World Class Championship Wrestling\", Hart said that he had pictures of all of the wrestlers he managed except for Gino Hernandez, because seeing images (and the resulting memories) of his dead-too-soon colleague were too emotionally upsetting for Hart. Wolfe's career happened in an era of pro wrestling in which excessive partying was a commonplace piece of a U.S. wrestler's daily lifestyle. Compounding matters, promoters and bookers commonly directed wrestlers to \"live their gimmick\", so their on-screen/in-ring characters would seem even more believable to fans. While Vince McMahon broke with pro wrestling's strongly-held tradition of \"kayfabe\" (i.e., always fiercely hiding and denying that any aspect of wrestling wasn't 100% real), in 1987, the rest of the industry was reluctant to follow McMahon's lead. Many of the superstars included in the 1990s-2001s wave of premature wrestler deaths had been heavy abusers of both performance-enhancing drugs and party drugs -- alcohol and other, illegal drugs with extremely high purity levels (e.g., cocaine, heroin, marijuana, prescription pain killers) -- in the 1980s and 1970s. \n\nThe syndicated World Class TV episode scheduled to air the weekend of February 15, 1986 originally included a Gino Hernandez match taped on January 24 at the Dallas Sportatorium. This match never aired; instead, show announcer Bill Mercer gave an on-camera announcement of Gino's death, and a different match aired in its place.\n\nBoth Mercer and Marc Lowrance treated Hernandez's death as well as Chris Adams' blinding angle as equally significant during a time when World Class was about to go forward with their feud beginning at Texas Stadium. Adams returned the following May, and won the World Class Heavyweight Championship two months later.\n\nThe funeral service and its expenses were handled by a reputed local drug dealer/trafficker called \"John Royal\", with whom Hernandez had become friends. Family members were uncomfortable with Royal and his associates overseeing Charles Wolfe, Jr.'s funeral proceedings; many had never even heard of or met them prior to Wolfe's death.\n\nAlthough police dropped the homicide investigation into Hernandez' death, some still believe he was murdered in a drug-related incident. According to David Manning, Hernandez had five times the amount of cocaine in his system that would have resulted in a fatality, and he and Kevin Von Erich stated that Hernandez also had cocaine in his stomach. Manning also suspected foul play due to the fact that Hernandez's dead bolt on his door was not locked, as he made it a habit in the past to lock the dead bolt at all times. In the weeks before his death, Hernandez had expressed to Manning and others the belief that his life was under threat.\n\nFormer rival Michael Hayes said in a 2016 interview: \"I have a real, \"real\" hard time believing that Gino Hernandez OD'd... he was most definitely hanging with the wrong crowd, and either ran his mouth too much, or knew too much, or all of the above.\" Asked about Hernandez' death, Jake Roberts said: \"Gino was attached to some heavy people... he was running in some pretty big circles, man, that maybe he didn't belong [in].\" Hernandez's mother Patrice Aguirre and ex-wife Janice Marie Bancroft expressed the belief that he was probably murdered; Aguirre reported that criminal \"John Royal\" had told her of debts owed to him by Hernandez. She later tended toward the overdose ruling, however, after receiving a recorded message from a gangland source who was close to Hernandez.\n\nBoth Aguirre and Bancroft have explored the possibility that Hernandez faked his death, given that he had once talked about doing so, and because the autopsy report was replete with errors about his ethnicity and physicality. The family never saw his body, which was concealed by Hernandez's manager Walter Ayman due to its decomposed state, and honored in a closed-casket service.\n\nWrestler Brutus Beefcake has rejected the murder theory, saying that Hernandez \"had a serious drug problem\" and was an \"intense, crazy partier\".\n\nA documentary on Viceland TV, part of the \"Dark Side of the Ring\" series, called \"The Mysterious Death of Gorgeous Gino\", aired on May 8, 2019.\n\nHis mother was Patrice Aguirre and his father was Charles Eugene Wolfe Sr. with this latter's identity being unknown to the point that wrestling fans speculated that Wolfe's father was actually Houston Wrestling promoter Paul Boesch, due to how close they were. Wolfe was married twice, both times to Janice Marie Bancroft. They were first married on April 10, 1976 in Harris County, Texas, before divorcing soon after on January 27, 1977. During their first marriage, they had a daughter, Lisha. The pair remarried on April 12, 1978 before divorcing again on July 19, 1979. Wolfe adopted the Gino Hernandez name after his stepfather, Luis Hernandez, who trained with him when Gino was a child.\n\nAccording to former WCCW colleague Jake Roberts, Hernandez was involved with the gay community in Houston.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1984367", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1984367", "title": "Glacial lake", "text": "Glacial lake\n\nA glacial lake is a body of water with origins from glacier activity. They are formed when a glacier erodes the land, and then melts, filling the depression created by the glacier.\n\nNear the end of the last glacial period, roughly 10,000 years ago, glaciers began to retreat. A retreating glacier often left behind large deposits of ice in hollows between drumlins or hills. As the ice age ended, these melted to create lakes. This is apparent in the Lake District in Northwestern England where post-glacial sediments are normally between 4 and 6 Meters deep in . These lakes are often surrounded by drumlins, along with other evidence of the glacier such as moraines, eskers and erosional features such as striations and chatter marks.\n\nThese lakes are clearly visible in aerial photos of landforms in regions that were glaciated during the last ice age. The coastlines near these areas are typically very irregular, reflecting the same geological process.\n\nBy contrast, other areas have fewer lakes that often appear attached to rivers. Their coastlines are smoother. These areas were carved more by water erosion.\n\nThe formation and characteristics of glacial lakes vary between location and can be classified into glacial erosion lake, ice-blocked lake, moraine-dammed lake, other glacial lake, supraglacial lake, and subglacial lake.\n\nSince the glaciation of the Little Ice Age, Earth has lost more than 50% of its glaciers. This along with the current increase in retreating glaciers caused by climate change has created a shift from frozen to liquid water, increasing the extent and volume of glacial lakes around the world. Most glacial lakes present today can be found in Asia, Europe, and North America. The area which will see the greatest increase in lake formation is the Southern Tibetan Plateau region from debris covered glaciers. This increase in glacial lake formation also indicates an increase in occurrence of glacial lake outburst flood events caused by damming and subsequent breaking of moraine and ice.\n\nThe amount of sediment found in glacial lakes varies from four to six meters in depth, and has a general stratigraphic sequence of; organic muds, glacial clays, silty clays, and sands based on time of formation.\n\nOver time the glacial lake sediments are subjected to change. As seen in the English Lake District, the layers of the sediments at the bottom of the lakes contain evidence of the rate of erosion. The elemental make up of the sediments are not associated with the lakes themselves, but by the migration of the elements within the soil, such as iron and manganese.\n\nThe distribution of these elements, within the lake bed, are attributed to the condition of the drainage basin and the chemical composition of the water.\n\nSediment deposition can also be influenced by animal activity; including the distribution of biochemical elements, which are elements that are found in organic organisms, such as phosphorus and sulfur.\n\nThe amount of halogens and boron found in the sediments accompanies a change in erosional activity. The rate of deposition reflects the amount of halogen and boron in the deposited sediments.\n\nThe scouring action of the glaciers pulverizes minerals in the rock over which the glacier passes. These pulverized minerals become sediment at the bottom of the lake, and some of the rock flour becomes suspended in the water column. These suspended minerals support a large population of algae, making the water appear green.\n\nBiodiversity and productivity tend to be lower in glacial lakes as only cold-tolerant and cold-adapted species can withstand their harsh conditions. Glacial rock flour and low nutrient levels create an oligotrophic environment where few species of plankton, fish and benthic organisms reside.\n\nBefore becoming a lake the first stages of glacial recession melt enough freshwater to form a shallow lagoon. In the case of Iceland's Jökulsárlón glacial lagoon located on the edge of the Atlantic Ocean, tides bring in an array of fish species to the edge of the glacier. These fish attract an abundance of predators from birds to marine mammals, that are searching for food. These predators include fauna such as, seals, arctic terns and arctic skua.\n\nGlacial lakes that have been formed for a long period of time have a more diverse ecosystem of fauna originating form neighboring tributaries or other glacial refugia. For example, many native species of the great lakes basin entered via the Mississippi basin refugia within the past 14,000 years.\n\nGlacial lakes act as fresh water storage for the replenishing of a regions water supply and serve as potential electricity producers from hydropower.\n\nGlacial lakes' aesthetic nature also stimulates economic activity through the attraction of the tourism industry. Thousands of tourists visit the Jökulsárlón glacial lagoon in Iceland annually to take part in commercial boat tours and every two to four years thousands visit the Argentino glacial lake in Argentina to witness the collapse of the cyclically formed arch of ice from the Perito Moreno glacier, making it one of the largest travel destinations in Patagonia.\n\n"}

Bowen was re-selected for the next game of the 1886 Home Nations Championship this time against Scotland at the Cardiff Arms Park.\n\nIn 1887 Bowen played in all three games of the 1887 Championship, including the draw with England at Llanelli's cricket ground and the win against Ireland at Birkenhead Park.

It was the first front-wheel drive car made by the automaker. The 480 was available in only one body style on an automobile platform related to the Volvo 440/460 five door hatchback and four door sedan models.\n\nIt features an unusual four seat, three door hatchback body, somewhere between liftback and estate in form. The 480 was marketed as a coupé in Europe starting in 1986. The compact car was originally intended to be marketed in the United States as a 2+2 \"sports wagon\" in the fall 1987, although these plans were cancelled due to the continued weakness of the U.S. dollar during 1987.\n\nVolvo took six years from the time the 480 was conceived, through its development, and finally brought to production readiness. The press launch was on October 15, 1985, but the 480 was first put on public show in March at the 1986 Geneva Motor Show, becoming available to buyers in May 1986.\n\nThe automaker described the car as a four seater with \"sporty styling\" and the first front wheel driven Volvo. The press described it as having a \"sleek hatch body\" in contrast to Volvo's traditional \"boxcar look\". The 480 was the first Volvo of its style since the P1800ES, and the last until the unveiling of the C30. All of these models featured a frameless glass hatch for cargo access.\n\nThe 480 was produced in Born, Netherlands, at the factory that built DAF cars, including the DAF 66 based Volvo 66, and later, the Volvo 300 Series. The 480 was the forerunner of the Volvo 440 and 460 models, which were built on the same platform.\n\nVolvo also claimed that it was one of the first cars sold in Europe featuring bumpers designed to comply with United States National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) regulations to withstand a front rear impact without damage to the engine, lights, and safety equipment. This was the only Volvo to feature pop-up headlights, this was done to meet NHTSA standards on minimum headlight height while maintaining the aerodynamic shape. However, although it was foreseen to sell 25,000 cars overseas, the introduction of the Volvo 480 to the American market was postponed indefinitely in February 1988, citing unfavourable market conditions and the exchange rate of the US dollar.\n\nThe concept was to market a modern, compact front wheel drive car with a unique low slung design targeting buyers \"between 25 and 40, probably with a higher than average education and with a career.\" Designed by Volvo's Dutch subsidiary, the \"sporty 480 ES coupe\" was introduced to change the automaker's \"frumpy image\" and into the \"yuppie\" market segment.\n\nVolvo highlighted that the car was \"well-endowed with advanced electronics\" and the automaker's press release described in detail the numerous features. The 480 had good handling, due in part to its Lotus designed suspension. The normally aspirated Renault engines were reliable.\n\nThe 1987 models were available with an anti-locking brake system (ABS) as an optional extra.\n\nIn 1988, a Turbo version was introduced, the Garrett AiResearch turbocharger increasing the power from to . Maximum torque was compared to the for the naturally aspirated 1.7 L engine.\n\nIn 1993 (United Kingdom), due to new legislation which meant that catalytic converters had to be fitted to unleaded petrol engines, power dropped and so the 2.0 L engine was developed; it was rated at and . A four-speed automatic transmission was also offered.\n\nIn 1991, the 480 received new mirrors, headrests for the back seats, as well as subtle modifications to the trim and body colour bumpers. The 2.0 naturally aspirated engine was also introduced, again based on the Renault F3 engine.\n\nChanges between the CEM (Central Electronic Module) are externally apparent with the introduction of a total closure system whereby the key can be held in the lock position to close the windows and (where fitted) sunroof. Earlier CEM modules feature a \"passing\" function for the wipers, whereby fully depressing the accelerator pedal will switch intermittent wipers to full. Early 1992 saw the first release of special editions such as the \"TwoTone\" (with a two tone paintjob).\n1994 saw the United Kingdom release of the \"Celebration\" limited edition of 480 specially equipped and numbered cars. In 1994, the 480 also received its last light update, and now sported clear front turn signals. Production ended on 7 September 1995. According to the Volvo Museum, 76,375 cars in ES and Turbo versions were made between 1986 and 1995.\n\nWriting about the demise of the 480 in \"Car Magazine\", journalist Richard Bremner wrote about the car's decent power and low weight combination. \"This meant there was some danger of a sporty steer — pretty radical from a company that considered having fun at the wheel as acceptable as seducing a nun,\" he commented. \"Good grief, a Volvo worth preserving. And there aren't many of them.\"\n\nHe also commented on the last versions for the United Kingdom as, \"And Celebration it was too, as Europe waved goodbye to the badly built, pointless, DAF coupé with an outrageous asking price of £16,500. That paid for the CD player, alloys, leather and a pointless hallmarked plaque glued to the dashboard.\" It \"was no sports car\" with most being \"ridiculously underpowered\" and available to collectors \"at rock bottom\" prices.\n\nThe 480 factory also made several prototypes, including a 480 with an electric drivetrain, a supercharged version (G-Lader), a version with a sixteen valve engine, and a version with a turbocharged 2.0 L engine. \n\nA convertible was announced to the press in summer 1987, but not seen in public until the 1990 Geneva Motor Show. It was planned to be launched at the beginning of 1991, but it did not make production after a supplier declared bankruptcy, and concerns over roll over safety protection.\n\n"}
{"id": "1984401", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1984401", "title": "Elvin Hayes", "text": "Elvin Hayes\n\nElvin Ernest Hayes (born November 17, 1945), nicknamed \"The Big E\", is an American retired professional basketball player and radio analyst for his alma-mater Houston Cougars. He is a member of the NBA's 50th Anniversary All-Time Team, and an inductee in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.\n\nA quiet, introverted youth, Hayes first picked up a basketball in eighth grade, by accident. He was wrongly blamed for playing a classroom prank and was sent to the principal's office. But another teacher, Reverend Calvin, saw Hayes and said he was welcome in his class. Although the youngster showed no inclination for any sports, Calvin thought he would benefit by playing basketball and put him on the school team. Hayes was so clumsy, however, that he evoked laughter with his awkward attempts at shooting and dribbling.\n\nBut young Hayes was determined to improve, and during the summers he practiced long hours. As a 6'5\" ninth grader he was a benchwarmer on the junior varsity squad at Britton High School when he became determined to crack the starting lineup. \"I was too weak to shoot the turnaround then\", Hayes recalled, \"so all summer long I shot with a small rubber ball at a basket in my yard. My development was almost overnight.\"\n\nIn Hayes's senior year, 1963–64, he led Britton to the state championship, averaging 35 points during the regular season. In the championship game he picked up 45 points and 20 rebounds.\n\nHayes and Don Chaney were the University of Houston's first Black American basketball players in 1966.\n\nIn 1966, Hayes led the Cougars into the Western Regional semi-finals of the 1966 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament before losing to the Pac-8 champion Oregon State Beavers.\n\nIn 1967, he led the Cougars to the Final Four of the 1967 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament. He would attempt 31 field goals, and score 25 points and 24 rebounds in a 73-58 semi-final loss to the eventual champion UCLA Bruins featuring Lew Alcindor (now known as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar). His rebounding total is second to Bill Russell's Final Four record of 27.\n\nOn January 20, 1968, the Big E and the Houston Cougars faced Lew and the UCLA Bruins in the first-ever nationally televised regular season college basketball game. In front of a record 52,693 fans at the Houston Astrodome, Hayes scored 39 points and had 15 rebounds while limiting Alcindor to just 15 points as Houston beat UCLA 71–69 to snap the Bruins' 47-game winning streak in what has been called the \"Game of the Century\". That game helped Hayes earn \"The Sporting News\" College Basketball Player of the Year.\n\nOne month later on February 10, he grabbed a career-high 37 rebounds in a game against Centenary.\n\nIn the rematch to the \"Game of the Century\", Hayes faced Alcindor and UCLA in the 1968 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament at the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena. UCLA coach John Wooden had the Bruins play a 'triangle and two\" zone defense with Alcindor playing behind Hayes and Lynn Shackleford fronting him. He was held to 10 points, losing to Alcindor and the Bruins 101-69 in the semi-final game.\nHayes led Houston in scoring (1966 27.2 points per game, 1967 28.4, and 1968 36.8). For his college career, Hayes averaged 31.0 points per game and 17.2 rebounds per game. He has the most rebounds in NCAA tournament history at 222. While a student at Houston, Hayes was initiated into the Alpha Nu Omega Chapter of the Iota Phi Theta fraternity alongside fellow future Hall of Famer Calvin Murphy.\n\nWith his departure from college Hayes was selected as the first overall selection in both the 1968 NBA draft and 1968 ABA draft. He was taken by the San Diego Rockets and the Houston Mavericks, respectively.\n\nHayes joined the NBA with the San Diego Rockets in 1968 and went on to lead the NBA in scoring with 28.4 points per game, averaged 17.1 rebounds per game, and was named to the NBA All-Rookie Team. Hayes' scoring average is the fifth best all-time for a rookie, and he remains the last rookie to lead the NBA in scoring average. He scored a career-high 54 points against the Detroit Pistons on November 11, 1968.\n\nIn Hayes' second season, he led the NBA in rebounding, becoming the first player other than Bill Russell or Wilt Chamberlain to lead the category since 1957 (Chamberlain was injured during much of the season). In Hayes' third season, 1970–71, he scored a career best 28.7 points per game. In 1971, the Rockets moved to Houston, enabling Hayes to play in the city of his college triumphs.\n\nHayes was acquired by the Baltimore Bullets from the Rockets for Jack Marin on June 23, 1972. He teamed with Hall-Of-Famer Wes Unseld to form a fierce and dominating frontcourt combination. The 18.1 rebounds per game Hayes averaged in 1974 is the third highest rebounding average of any NBA player since Wilt Chamberlain retired in 1973.\n\nHayes and Unseld later led the Washington Bullets to three NBA Finals (1975, 1978 and 1979), and an NBA title over the Seattle SuperSonics in 1978. During the Bullets' championship season (1978), he averaged 21.8 points and 12.1 rebounds per game in 21 playoff games. Hayes set an NBA Finals record for most offensive rebounds in a game (11), in a May 27, 1979 game against the SuperSonics. The Chicago Bulls' Dennis Rodman would tie this record twice, both games coming in the 1996 NBA Finals, also against the SuperSonics.\n\nDesiring to finish his playing career in Texas and preferably Houston, Hayes was sent back to the Rockets for second-round draft picks in 1981 (Charles Davis) and 1983 (Sidney Lowe) on June 8, 1981. The \"Big E\" closed out his career with the Rockets in 1984. His final season was marked with some controversy; Hayes understandably did not play extensive minutes for much of the season due to his age and the team not being very good, but down the stretch he suddenly received extended minutes (he played all 48 minutes in one home loss) and speculation abounded that Houston was giving Hayes more playing time to ensure that the team would keep losing and have a better shot at getting the #1 draft pick (the Rockets did get that pick and used it to select Hakeem Olajuwon). Hayes finished his career with exactly 50,000 minutes played. Hayes had a career scoring average of 21.0 points and 12.5 rebounds per game. He played at least 80 games in every season. He ranks fourth in NBA history in total rebounds, behind Chamberlain, Russell and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.\n\nShortly after finishing his career in the NBA, Hayes returned to the University of Houston to finish the last 30 credit hours of his undergraduate degree. When interviewed about the experience, Hayes mentioned, \"I played 16 years of pro basketball, but this is the hardest thing I've ever done.\"\n\nFor a while he owned a car dealership in Crosby, Texas.\nIn November 2007, Hayes became a City of Liberty Police Reserve Officer, fulfilling a childhood dream. On November 22, 2010, it was announced that he would serve as an analyst for radio broadcasts of Houston Cougars games on Houston's KBME.\nHayes is currently a reserve police officer with the City of Jersey Village, a suburb of Houston.\n\nIn his career with the San Diego/Houston Rockets and the Baltimore/Capital/Washington Bullets, Hayes played 1,303 games over 16 seasons, registering 27,313 points (ninth all-time) and 16,279 rebounds (fourth all-time). He is the all-time leading scorer for the Washington Bullets/Wizards. Hayes never missed more than two games in any of his 16 seasons in the NBA. In addition to his 1968 scoring title, he led the NBA in rebounding in 1970 and 1974. Hayes played in 12 straight NBA All-Star Games from 1969 to 1980. His total regular-season minutes played in the NBA were exactly 50,000.\n\nHayes was elected to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1990 and named to the NBA's 50th Anniversary All-Time Team during the 1996–97 NBA season. He boycotted the Hall of Fame beginning in 1990 and refused to return until Guy Lewis, his coach at the University of Houston, was admitted. Lewis was admitted to the Hall of Fame in 2013, and Hayes was there for the first time since his induction in 1990.\n\nIn 2003, Hayes was inducted into the Breitbard Hall of Fame, which honors San Diego's finest athletes.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1984402", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1984402", "title": "Pakistan Television Corporation", "text": "Pakistan Television Corporation\n\nPakistan Television Corporation (; reporting name: PTV) is the Pakistani state-owned broadcaster. Founded on 26 November 1964 as a private company by NEC of Japan, PTV was nationalised by the Pakistani government in 1970, due to low revenue. PTV enjoyed a television monopoly until 1990. The end of this monopoly led to a boom in electronic media in Pakistan, which gained greater political influence.\n\nThe idea of establishing a media and television industry was conceived in late 1956 and created by the privately set up national education commission, with the support of President Ayub Khan in 1960. In 1961, the private sector media mogul and industrialist Syed Wajid Ali launched a television industrial development project, bringing the role of Ubaidur Rahman, an electrical engineer in the Engineering Division of Radio Pakistan, as the project director of the first television station in Lahore. Ali reached a milestone in 1961 after establishing a private television broadcasting company with the cooperation of Nippon Electric Company (NEC) of Japan and Thomas Television International of the United Kingdom.\n\nIn 1963, a public meeting was chaired by President Ayub Khan; in which the government made decisions about the Pakistan Television stations and the media industry in the country. Since 1963, its headquarters are in Islamabad, near the Cabinet Secretariat. From 1961 to 1962, a television headquarters was established in Lahore and several pilot transmission tests were taken by Rahman's team. Subsequently, many television divisions were established throughout Pakistan by this team, including East-Pakistan.\n\nOn 26 November 1964, after an introduction by Syed Wajid Ali, the first-ever news broadcast was done which was beamed as a black and white transmission by the PTV. The first programme, formatted by Thomas Television International, telecast amateur programmes with foreign films; the television division in the Punjab Province was established with the help of United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the Colombo Plan, and the Government of Japan. Aslam Azhar (1932–- 29 Dec 2015) was appointed the first managing director of the Pakistan Television in charge of all the staffing requirements at the first PTV Lahore Center. This first managing director and executive Aslam Azhar is widely considered to be the \"father of Pakistan Television\". Private industries commercials were permitted with no fee; initially all the commercials of industrial conglomerates were tax-free with no additional charges.\n\nThe PTV remained under the private sector management with more than half of the shares were sold to Ministry of Information and Broadcasting in a fear that all shares would fall into the hands of government in the name of greater interest of the country. President Ayub Khan appointed Ubaidur Rahman in the Ministry of Information to continue with the NEC joint venture collaboration in launching the PTV.\n\nThe project began with a tent on the back lot of Pakistan Broadcasting Corporation by Ubaidur Rahman where a transmission tower and a studio were constructed by his team. On 26 November 1964, President Ayub Khan inaugurated the first official television station commencing transmission broadcasts from Lahore, followed by Dacca in December 25, 1964 (then the capital of East Pakistan), a third centre was established in Rawalpindi and Islamabad in 1965 and the fourth in Karachi in 1966. On 29 May 1967, a private company was established as Pakistan Television Corporation under the Company Act, 1913, whereas the private sector remained charged with broadcasting on the television. At that time, all studio programmes were telecasted live as no VTR recording machines were available, which were made available in 1968.\n\nAfter the Indo-Pakistani war in 1971, the PTV was nationalized and brought in completely under the government-ownership management by then-President Zulfikar Ali Bhutto's government. Communication network expansion was vast by the PTV and government publicly funded its infrastructure expansion all over the country.\n\nPromotion of regional literature, science-fiction miniseries, country music, and romanticizing rural values in drama playwrights were on-aired by the PTV, at the behest of public funding by the Government of Pakistan. The PTV was considered as source of major national integration.\n\nMicrowave National Network was established among the centres of PTV in 1973 while Quetta and Peshawer centers were started in 1974.\n\nThe PTV transmission switched over from its original black and white to color transmission in 1975. Regional headquarters of PTV and television centers were established in Peshawar and Quetta in 1974. In 1977–78, the PTV broadcast the live Cricket match between England vs. Pakistan. During this time, the PTV's interview programming series brought many scientists, politicians, sportsmen, actors, musicians, and artists to public fame.\n\nBy the 1980s, the transmissions of PTV could be reached over 90% area of Pakistan. In 1980s, the PTV was the sole provider of television, and dominated the electronic media industry. During 1980s, the conservative ideas were promoted on the PTV as part of the government policy, and heavy investments were made on the promotion of education programming series.\n\nDuring the decades of the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, PTV dramas and teleplays were considered as the best in the Indian subcontinent. These included \"Khuda Ki Basti (1969–74)\", \"Unkahi (1982)\", \"Tanhaiyaan (1985)\", \"Aangan Terha\", \"Fifty Fifty (1979–84)\", \"Studio Dhai (2-1/2)\", \"Studio Ponay Teen (2-3/4)\", \"Andehra Ujala (1984)\", \"Sona Chandi (1983)\", \"Uncle Urfi\", \"Taleem-e-Baalighan\", \"Alif Noon (1981–82)\", \"Waaris (1979)\", \"Dhoop Kinare (1987)\", \"Sunehray Din\",\"Guest House\" \"Alpha Bravo Charlie\", \"Ana\", \"Akhri Chatan\", \"Zair, Zabar, Pesh (1974–75)\" and block buster serials like \"Dhuwan\", \"Kath Putli\", \"Wafa Ham Nibhaein Gai\", \"Bandhan\", \"Kaghaz Kay Phool\", \"Muqqdas\", \"Bint-e-Adam\", \"Malangi (2006)\", \"Sawan\", \"Sheela Bagh\", \"Tinkay\", \"Aisa Bhi Hota Hai\", \"Rasta De Zindagi\", \"Chubhan\", \"Kuch Lamhay\", \"Khuwahesho Kay Sarab\", and many others.\n\nIn 1990s, the PTV's programming was said initially to have intellectual appeal but succumbed to commercial pressure. In 1992, the composition of PTV's programming was based upon on 56% of entertainment, and only 25% of news and educational programmes. About 54% of national programming was based on Urdu and only 16% accounted for English. In response to challenges by private channels such as STN and NTM as well as Indian channels. PTV started its second TV Channel PTV-2 in 1992, it was the first-ever satellite channel of Pakistan as well. PTV-2 was the first Pakistani channel to appear on airwaves of Asia, Africa and Australia. PTV/PTV-1 joined this very satellite beam in 1993–94. PTV-2 was renamed as PTV World in 1998 and became digital on satellite in 1999. PTV expanded its broadcast area to Europe and later in North America in public-private partnership as PTV-Prime. STN came under PTV in 1999 as Channel-3 and started its regular broadcast with new name in 2000 as an all purpose channel. STN/Channel-3 was also visible on satellite.\n\nUnlike other state-run corporations, Pakistan Television Corporation was allowed by the Government of Pakistan to raise a sizable amount of private capital to finance the stations. This includes a Rs. 35 per month TV fee charge to all consumers of electricity.\n\nThe broader perspective to start electronic media in the country was to inform and educate the people through wholesome entertainment and to inculcate in them a greater awareness of their own history, heritage, current problems and development as well as knowledge of the world at large.\n\nIn fulfillment of its broad and main objectives, PTV's broadcast policy concerning matters of national and international interests has always been motivated and guided by the cardinal principles of educating viewers about the values that are vitally important in building a united, integrated and disciplined society. These objectives have successfully been achieved through programmes centred towards Islam, education, entertainment and culture.\n\nThe projection of new, emerging social order is highlighted in PTV's general programming, focusing on themes like morality, civic or national responsibilities, drive against narcotics, environmental pollution, agricultural reforms etc. through discussions, shows, and through anchorpersons in its broadcasting schedule.\n\nPTV had been received via satellite in South Asia, East Asia and the Middle East, Africa, Europe and North America. Selected programming could be seen on a satellite channel named Prime TV (with a partnership with PTV) in the United Kingdom, Europe and North America until 22 April 2006. On 22 April 2006, Pakistan Television Corporation started broadcasting directly to the overseas viewers including the US. This remains true as of January 2016.\n\nPTV operates the following channels:\n\nPakistan Television News informs its viewers across the country on the latest newsworthy happenings on the national and international levels. During the past few years, there has been rapid expansion in the area and scope of news coverage.\n\n\nCurrent affairs programmes have been a regular feature of PTV Transmission, ever since its inception. A separate PTV Current Affairs Directorate was established in 1982.\n\nCurrent affairs programmes, including regional languages, produced by each of the TV Centre are accommodated in regular PTV transmission. The themes of regional language programs mainly revolve around local and provincial matters of current affairs nature. The Current Affairs Division produces programs on special occasions such as live telecast of Armed Forces Parade on Pakistan Day, live telecast of flag hoisting ceremony on Independence Day, Head of State's Address to the Nation, documentaries on important national projects, live telecast of certain sessions of Senate and National Assembly. In the program Open Forum, Federal Ministers/Minister of States are invited to answer the questions through e-mail, on Telephone and by Media/Experts sitting in the various studios of Ptv. This program is live and is very popular amongst viewers.\n\n\nInternational Relations Division of Pakistan Television Corporation participates in the international television festivals/competitions sending best of its PTV programs to them. PTV has won distinguished prizes and commendations at those events.\n\nA large number of PTV programs have been sold for telecast in other countries which resulted in strengthening of the financial condition of PTV. Such companies as Shalimar Recording and Broadcasting Company and Sports Star International Company are the major distributors of PTV programmes.\n\nA lot of PTV plays and documentaries have been provided to foreign countries through government ministries and missions abroad free of charge for the projection of Pakistan and its people.\n\nDubbing and editing is carried out by PTV International Relations Division. Some selected programs are subtitled in English and Arabic languages for overseas projection especially for Muslim countries. Documentaries from National Geographic Magazine are being televised with Urdu dubbing. A series of animated imported programme \"Treasure Island\" is being dubbed in Urdu language for telecast. PTV has recently provided the satellite facilities to foreign agencies with regard to Pakistan's nuclear tests and has earned approximately US$400,000 each time.\n\nPTV has procured foreign canned programs on hire/rental basis. PTV procures foreign programs including feature films, cartoons, science fiction, comedy, adventure, classic drama serials/series and public general-interest programs.\n\nThe Engineering Division takes care of the day-to-day operations and maintenance of PTV centers and Rebroadcast Stations, new projects, Planning & Procurement, as well as Research and Development activities.\n\nIt was an engineering feat at the time Pakistan began television transmissions in 1964 at Lahore, long before its neighbors Iran in 1966 and India in 1965. Over the years, the system has grown into a countrywide network offering two programming channels. The engineering feat was a success because NEC (Nippon Electronic Corporation) co-operated with and helped PTV launching.\n\nThe IT Department was established as a Division of PTV in 1988 and as of today has a team of 450 IT professionals with representation in all PTV Centres namely Islamabad, Lahore, Karachi, Peshawar, Multan, Quetta and Muzafarabad, AJK as well as at the PTV Headquarters in Islamabad. The IT Department provides in-house software for the News systems for PTV-News, which includes all electronic news collection, relay and on-screen presentation. In-house software created by the IT Department including mNIMS & NAPeS for PTV-News, MAPS-RT for playback installed at all PTV Centres, software for Accounting and Medical database management as well as numerous others for the automation of processes at PTV.\n\nShortly after the VTR was brought to PTV in 1967, they needed a way to know if the recorded programs were suitable for TV airing. Therefore, PTV Censor Board was formed in 1968 and is headed by Director Programs Administration. It was separately instituted within PTV on the approval of the Secretary, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting in December 1980 to clear and certify bulk of imported and locally acquired programs with speed and efficiency. PTV Consultant of News/Current Affairs/Presentation presently heads the PTV Censor Board.\n\nEstablished in 1987, Pakistan Television Academy is an apex TV institution in Pakistan, which imparts professional training in disciplines of television broadcast technology. It is headed by a full-time director and assisted by a team of television professionals who are members of the academic faculty.\n\nAs of June 1998, over 3100 people had attended training programmes conducted by PTV Academy. They attended training courses in engineering, computers, finance, administration, news, current affairs and programme production. They included visiting participants from other countries including SAARC country members.\n\nUbaidur Rahman the first general manager and originator of PTV commissioned Pakistan's supremo artist Abdur Rahman Chughtai to design a conceptual logo for PTV, this logo was later redesigned with minor modifications by another leading artist Shahzad Nawaz Khan for a more up-to-date look. Recently in the year 2016, PTV's channel logos were redesigned by PTV's Creative Manager (Design) Babur Saghir. By redesigning the logos of these ten channels of PTV his design philosophy was as follows: \"The harmony in the design of our new logos depicts unity and connectivity. The non-conventional shape represents modernity, innovation and the new age of PTV. PTV engraved on gold symbolizes the last 50 years of our very strong connection with our audience (PTV Golden Anniversary was celebrated in 2014). The diverse colour palette is representative of the diversity of our people. The golden stroke shows dynamism and the transformation of PTV.\"\n\nThe chairman/CEO is appointed by the prime minister and, finally confirmation approved by the president. The chairman heads the board of governors that are appointed by the Government of Pakistan to manage its affairs and reports directly to the Information Secretary of Pakistan.\n\nThe managing director (MD) is the administrative head of the PTV with executive responsibilities. The appointment of MD comes from the approval from the Government of Pakistan and approval from the chairman of the PTV.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1984414", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1984414", "title": "PTV (Family Guy)", "text": "PTV (Family Guy)\n\n\"PTV\" is the fourteenth episode in the fourth season of the American animated television series \"Family Guy\". It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on November 6, 2005. The episode sees the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) censor the shows on television after a controversial wardrobe malfunction at the Emmy Awards. Peter starts to create his own TV network which he calls PTV, broadcasting classic shows unedited and uncut, as well as original programming. PTV is a big success and Stewie and Brian join him creating shows for the network. Lois calls the FCC to close PTV as she is concerned over the issue of how children will be influenced by Peter's programming. Not only do the FCC close down the network, but they also start censoring the citizens of Quahog, so the Griffin family travels to Washington, D.C. and convince the Congress to have the FCC's rules reversed.\n\nThe episode was written by Alec Sulkin and Wellesley Wild and was directed by Dan Povenmire. The episode is a response to the FCC's measures to the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy. Show creator Seth MacFarlane commented that the episode's plot was inspired by the rage of the \"Family Guy\" crew towards the strict rules that the FCC made after the controversy. The episode contains a sequence of various scenes from different previous episodes. Many of the scenes were cut from the episodes they were originally made for owing to Fox's internal censors. With a Nielsen rating of 4.4, \"PTV\" was the nineteenth most-watched episode of the week in which it was broadcast. The episode gained mostly positive responses from critics, and received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Animated Program (for Programming Less Than One Hour) as well as an Annie Award nomination for directing.\nIn a sequence unconnected to the remainder of the episode, Stewie prevents Osama bin Laden from sending a hostile message to the United States by attacking him and killing several of his henchmen, and (in a parody of the opening scene from \"\") rides off on his Big Wheel, cycling through scenes from various films and video games. He eventually arrives at his house and runs over Homer Simpson. Upon seeing Homer on the ground, Peter asks \"Who the hell is that?\"\n\nPeter awakens Lois by noisily installing a red carpet in their bedroom, anticipating watching the Emmy Awards, but Lois forces him to go to Meg's school play (which resembles the musical \"Godspell\") instead. After David Hyde Pierce's wardrobe malfunction during the ceremony, the FCC, led by Cobra Commander, receives an insignificant volume of phone calls concerning the incident, and decides to censor any content from television that could be even slightly harmful to viewers. The censorship is applied to such content as Chrissy Snow's cleavage from \"Three's Company\", Ralph Kramden’s threats of spousal abuse on \"The Honeymooners\" and even Dick Van Dyke's name. Peter is outraged, and on advice from Tom Tucker, starts his own TV network, PTV, on which he broadcasts classic shows unedited. He also includes original programming, such as Brian and Stewie's sitcom \"Cheeky Bastard\", Quagmire's \"Playboy After Dark\"-esque \"Midnight Q\", \"Dogs Humping\", and \"The Peter Griffin Sideboob Hour\".\n\nPTV is successful, but Lois is furious about everyone's interest in perverted TV, as she is concerned over how children will be influenced by Peter's programming (in the DVD release, Peter and Cleveland, in a parody of \"Jackass\", defecate on top of Lois' car). Brian argues that parents and legal guardians should take responsibility for what their children watch, and notes that there are worse influences besides TV. Regardless, Lois calls the FCC to have PTV shut down. This prompts Peter, along with Brian and Stewie, to perform an elaborate musical number lampooning the FCC's regulations. Although impressed with the song, the arriving FCC representatives shut down PTV. When Peter tells them that they cannot prevent people from being who they are even after they censor television, they decide to take on the challenge.\n\nThe representatives start to censor any foul language and inappropriate behavior in Quahog, ruining moments of privacy: a \"censor's bar\" is pulled over Peter's genitals by FCC employees as he leaves the shower, all expletives are drowned out with an air horn, audible farts are overdubbed with Steven Wright punchlines, and Mayor Adam West is cautioned for shaking his penis more than once after using a urinal. Everyone in Quahog is angered except for Lois, who believes that the citizens need a lesson in decency. However, she discovers that the FCC's guidelines prevent her and Peter from having sex. Realizing the consequences of her overzealous actions, Lois apologizes to Peter and admits he was right (prompting him to unveil a banner reading \"Peter's Right!\" which he had set up 15 years earlier in preparation for such an event; a clown was also supposed to appear, but he ended up dying and being reduced to a skeleton). They lobby Congress to have the FCC's rulings reversed; at first they disagree due to their strong support of the FCC, but they relent when Peter retorts by making them realize the resemblance of many Washington buildings to various private parts, including the Washington Monument to a penis, the Capitol Building to a breast and The Pentagon to an anus. With the oppression of the FCC finally over, Lois congratulates Peter, and the family watches an episode of \"The Brady Bunch\" that prominently features toilet humor.\n\nThe episode was co-written by Alec Sulkin and Wellesley Wild. Patrick Meighan, John Viener, Cherry Chevapravatdumrong, Tom Devanney and Kirker Butler acted as staff writers in the episode. The plot of \"PTV\" is a parody of the FCC's measures after Janet Jackson's wardrobe malfunction during the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show. In an interview, MacFarlane was asked where the inspiration to the episode’s plot came from, in his response he commented that \"In the case of 'PTV' it came out of rage. Rage over all the crap we have to deal with since Janet Jackson showed her 67 year old boob.\"\n\nThe episode was directed by Dan Povenmire, while Peter Shin contributed as supervising director. Various scenes in \"PTV\" were taken out of the episode due to Fox's internal censors. As the writers worked on the episode the producers ended up, as the \"Chicago Tribune\" describes it, \"horse trading\" with Fox, removing a body-part reference in exchange for a dirty word. While the writing staff of the show was disappointed with the number of scenes that were removed from the episode, they were happy with the final result. The opening sequence, of which \"Family Guy\"s creator Seth MacFarlane was particularly proud, was added into the episode after the producers discovered the episode ran three minutes short. The episode contained a montage which showcased the most bawdy moments of the previous seasons; Povenmire recalled the sequence; about it he stated that \"I just found those off the DVD and digitized them and edited them in. Basically because I didn't want to draw all those things! I found the most disgusting images from the first three seasons. And we actually got network notes on two of them saying, 'You're gonna have to cut that!' And I went, 'This has been on the air! And I'm only showing 8 frames of it!' And it turns out we cut them now when they're on the air. So apropos for the FCC episode.\"\n\n\"PTV\" and the thirteen other episodes from \"Family Guy\"s fourth season were released on a three-disc DVD set in the United States, in Europe, and in Australia on November 16, 2006, April 24, 2006 and May 29, 2006 respectively. The DVDs included brief audio commentaries by Seth MacFarlane, various crew and cast members from several episodes, a collection of deleted scenes, and a special mini-feature that shows director Peter Shin drawing Stewie. The episode was shown in the William S. Paley Television Festival, with which various writers, directors and voice actors of the show assisted.\n\nAll the main \"Family Guy\" cast members lent their voices to the episode, along with semi-regulars Lori Alan, Adam West, Ralph Garman, Gary Cole and Phil LaMarr. Staff writers Chris Sheridan and John Viener also had minor speaking roles. Guest appearances included voice actors Keith Ferguson, Maurice LaMarche, Hunter Gomez, Wally Wingert, and actress Stacey Scowley. Like most episodes, the music in the episode was composed by Walter Murphy, including the song titled \"The Freaking FCC\". The music was edited by Ron Jones.\n\n\"PTV\" contained various cultural references. \"PTV\" has been described as a satire on the \"government's ever-increasing reach into our living rooms\" by Television Watch executive director Jim Dyke. The opening sequence in which Stewie beats up members of Al-Qaeda and then rides his tricycle through various movie and game scenes is a reference to the opening sequence of \"Bobby's World\" and \"The Naked Gun\" series of films. The movies from which animated scenes are shown are \"The Wizard of Oz\", \"Ben-Hur\", \"The Shining\", \"The Empire Strikes Back\", and \"The Sound of Music\". Actual footage of the game \"Doom\" was also used.\n\nThe FCC censors various television shows, such as Ralph Kramden's threats of physical violence in \"The Honeymooners\", two-thirds of Dick Van Dyke's name in \"The Dick Van Dyke Show\" (\"dick\" and \"dyke\" being slang terms for penis and lesbian, respectively), Archie Bunker and wife Edith dressed as Ku Klux Klan members from \"All in the Family\", \"The Waltons\" and Chrissy Snow's bikini in a \"Three's Company\" commercial. Former \"Frasier\" cast member David Hyde Pierce was briefly mentioned in the episode. The extreme reaction of the FCC to Pierce's incident is a parody of the FCC's reaction to Janet Jackson's \"wardrobe malfunction\" during Super Bowl XXXVIII. Bob Hope, Wile E. Coyote, Ozzy Osbourne, Cobra Commander, Apache Chief, George W. Bush and Homer Simpson made appearances in cutaway gags. Terrorist Osama bin Laden was depicted prominently in the opening sequence. Stewie and bin Laden's sword fight has the same choreography as Yoda and Count Dooku's fight in the film \"\". The end of the episode is a parody to the ending of The Brady Bunch.\n\nThe episode was broadcast on November 6, 2005 on Fox. It gained a Nielsen rating of 4.4, making it the nineteenth most watched program in the week of October 31 to November 6.\n\nThe episode was positively received by critics. Maureen Ryan of the \"Chicago Tribune\" called \"PTV\" \"\"Family Guys\" most rebellious outing yet\". TV Squad critic Ryan Budke considered \"PTV\" his favorite episode ever. Jacqueline Cutler of \"The Star-Ledger\" called \"PTV\" \" the funniest, most sardonic half-hour on TV in a while.\" While exclusively airing the sixth season of \"Family Guy\" for British audiences, BBC Three aired this episode as part of the \"Family Guy\" 100th Anniversary special, declaring it to be \"The Best Episode...So Far\". The \"Hartford Courant\", however, gave it a largely negative review, stating it was \"not even funny for a second.\" MacFarlane revealed in an interview that the crew received a letter of inquiry from the U.S. regulatory board regarding the episode, but much to his surprise, \"they actually thought it was funny.\" The 59th Primetime Emmy Awards opened with Stewie and Brian singing about the upcoming TV season using the tune from \"The FCC Song\", originating from this episode. The altered version of the song contained references to shows such as \"Scrubs\", \"Two and a Half Men\", \"The Sopranos\" and \"Cavemen\". Tom Eames of entertainment website \"Digital Spy\" placed the episode at number eight on his listing of the best \"Family Guy\" episodes in order of \"yukyukyuks\" and noted the episode was show writer's \"way of aiming all their anger at the agencies who get in the way.\" He added that episode was \"one of those episodes where all the jokes worked\" and featured \"the show's first over-the-top song numbers\". IGN ranked PTV sixth in its \"Top 15 \"Family Guy\" Episodes,\" compiled in 2014 for the 15th anniversary of the series.\n\n\"PTV\" received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination in the Outstanding Animated Program (for Programming Less Than One Hour) category. Povenmire was nominated for an Annie Award for Directing in an Animated Television Production, but lost the award to Peter Shin, who directed the \"Family Guy\" episode \"North by North Quahog\". On June 1, 2007, the FCC song was voted second on The Paley Center for Media special \"TV's Funniest Moments,\" behind \"The Chris Rock Show\" segment \"Black Progress.\" The song was also voted sixth on IGN's list of \"Family Guy\"s \"Top 10 Musical Moments\", IGN stated \"if there's a song that perfectly resonates what \"Family Guy\" is all about, then this is it.\"\n\n"}

Pimental, and directed by Eric Stough.\n\nStan, Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny are inspired to go hunting for crocodiles by watching a Steve Irwin television programme in which Irwin is depicted as having a predilection for placing his thumb up an animal's rectum. Cartman causes Kyle to fall into a cave and sends Stan to retrieve him; once in the cave, Stan and Kyle discover a man frozen in ice. The boys retrieve him and take him to Dr. Mephesto to be dissected. Stan and Kyle get into a fight about who really discovered the frozen man and what name they should give him. Dr. Mephesto thaws the ice covering the man and discovers that he is alive and was frozen for only 32 months (according to his clothing brand/style). Despite this, Mephisto and all adults treat him as a prehistoric man and appear to be unable to understand him even though he speaks perfect English. To make his research more lucrative, Mephesto is persuaded by FBI agents to display the man to the public (Kenny is killed when he gets caught under the moving walkway).\n\nStan and Kyle become upset at the ice man's inhumane treatment, so they decide to set him free. Upon being released, the man (named Larry) returns to his home, only to discover that his wife Leslie has remarried and had two children. Later, as he attempts to refreeze himself, Kyle comes up with a solution for Larry - he takes a train to Des Moines, Iowa since everything there is still like 1996. Dr. Mephesto, Cartman, and the FBI, who have hired Steve Irwin as a tracker, catch up with Larry at the train station, just as he boards a train to Iowa. Irwin wrestles Larry, but the train crashes into a helicopter, killing Irwin as he gets sliced up by the helicopter's propellers. Larry escapes in the helicopter, thanks Stan and Kyle, and heads to Iowa. The FBI agents leave, disappointed as their plan to take over Sweden using Larry failed (much to Dr. Mephesto's confusion). Kyle and Stan decide to bury the hatchet while Cartman - now acting like Elmer Fudd - gets his body inadvertently stuck in a cow's rectum.\n\n\"Australian Outback Guy\" is a parody of the television series \"The Crocodile Hunter\" and its host Steve Irwin.\n\nAll 18 episodes of the second season, including \"Prehistoric Ice Man\", were released on a DVD box set on June 3, 2003.\n\n"}
{"id": "1984439", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1984439", "title": "Religion and the Internet", "text": "Religion and the Internet\n\nReligions are represented on the Internet in many ways. There are sites which attempt to cover all religions, traditions, and faiths, such as Patheos (which also provides a forum for atheism/humanism), Religious Tolerance, and Beliefnet. There are also sites that are specific to a religious tradition. Many sites are discussion groups, others host theological debates, and some provide advice concerning religious doctrine. Some sites aim to provide a religious experience facilitating prayer, meditation, or virtual pilgrimages. People also leverage search engines to investigate aspects of religion. Some religious websites are translated into several languages. For example, JW.ORG features content in over 1,000 languages. \n\nThere have been a number of attempts to create online Christian communities, usually supplementing, but occasionally attempting to replace, more traditional, brick and mortar Christian communities. It is common for even moderate sized Christian churches with only a few hundred members to have web sites to advertise themselves and communicate with their congregations. For example, Scott Thumma, a faculty associate at the Hartford Institute for Religion Research found that in the U.S. between 1998 and 2002, the ratio of churches with web sites went from 11 percent to 45 percent. Most sites concentrate on teaching and discussion. Some experiment with virtual meetings in cyberspace, and attempt to incorporate teaching, prayer, worship and even music into the experience. The i-church is the first Internet community to be fully recognised as an Anglican church.\n\nAfter being reassigned to the sinecure diocese of Partenia (a major Algerian city, that was consumed by the Sahara in the 5th century) by Pope John Paul II in 1995 as punishment for his controversial views, Roman Catholic Bishop Jacques Gaillot set up a website for the \"diocese without borders.\"\n\nThere are various web sites that aim to cover all of the Hindu religious traditions, including for example the Hindu Universe, which is maintained by the Hindu Studies Council. The site includes Hindu scripture and commentaries of the Rig Veda, Upanishads, the Bhagvad Gita and the laws of Manu.\n\nIn addition, there are a large number of web sites devoted to specific aspects of the Hindu tradition. For example, the major epics, the Mahabharata and the Ramayana, have web sites devoted to their study. There is a site devoted to the Kumbh Mela pilgrimage, giving Internet users the opportunity to join the hundreds of thousands of pilgrims who gather in Allahabad to bathe in the Ganges. Sites like Saranam.com allow worshippers to order a puja at the Hindu temple of their choosing and many pages have image of deities, which are thought to convey Darshan in the same manner as temple figures. The followers of Sri Vaishnava, Swaminarayan Sampraday and Dvaita Vedanta have web sites, and the International Society for Krishna Consciousness, also known as the Hare Krishnas, have their own site, which includes a Hare Krishna Network. Temples now webcast darshan live on the internet. In fact, important events too are broadcast live on the internet. For example, the Swaminarayan Temple in Cardiff broadcast its 25th anniversary celebrations live on the internet in 2007.\n\nIslamic sites fulfill a number of distinct roles, such as providing advice concerning religious doctrine, download daily prayers and for taking the shahadah over the Internet. For example, the Islam Page is a comprehensive Islamic web site, which links to a complete version of the Quran. Sites such as the Islam-Online site, according to Gary Bunt of the University of Wales, provide information about Islamic doctrine in addition to advice concerning individual problems including marriage, worship and Internet use. In order to answer online questions, an Imam or a team of religious scholars frequently provide a fatwa. These are stored in databases, which allow online users to search for their specific query. Gary Bunt has commented this has the advantage of facilitating resolution to issues that are considered dangerous or embarrassing to raise within the domestic framework.\n\nSeveral websites and blogs cover Judaism and Jewish life on the web. Some websites argue a certain religious or political viewpoint, while some take a purely cultural or secular focus. Conservative, Modern Orthodox, post-denominational, Reform, secular, and Haredi Jews are involved in writing J-blogs. Some J-bloggers, although religious in practice, use their blogs to discuss theological views which are skeptical or nonconformist. J-blogs fall into radical, liberal and conservative camps with respect to all Jewish communities across the world. Several blogs, such as CampusJ and Jewschool, cover Jewish life on campus.\n\nThe Internet has \"shipped\" Vodou via cyberspace, increasing it's accessibility outside of a Haitian context as there is no central text to be shared. Alexandra Boutros explains that while Vodou was formerly secret, it is now public, widespread, and available for consumption by any through the cyber world. Her concern is that the shipping of Vodou has led Internet, much like popular culture, to be full of \"voodoo that is not Vodou.\" \"Voodoo\" is a spelling used to denote tropes of Vodou, the Haitian tradition, which perpetuate misunderstandings, lies, and stereotypes. As such, Boutros explains that online Vodou, as well as cyberspirituality in general, are not representations of \"real religions in real places,\" but instead are their own \"dynamic entity,\" and this is an important distinction to make when studying Vodou or any other religion and its online presence.\n\nMany new religious movements have websites. A website of the Church of Scientology, for example, allows visitors to take an online personality test (the Oxford Capacity Analysis); however, to review the full results of this test, one has to make an appointment to meet a church representative in person. There has also been a series of legal battles—sometimes referred to as Scientology versus the Internet—concerning the publishing of esoteric teachings such as the \"space opera\" and, more specifically, Xenu.\n\nAccording to Stephen O'Leary of the University of Southern California, the Falun Gong's Internet awareness was an important factor in its ability to organize unauthorized demonstrations in the People's Republic of China. The group's leader, Li Hongzhi, was able to use the Internet to coordinate the movement, although he currently lives in New York.\n\nThere are various religious movements that have used the Internet extensively and this has been studied by academics, in the field of sociology of religion. Examples cited by Adam Possamai, of the University of Western Sydney, include Jediism and Matrixism. Possamai uses the term 'hyper-real religion' to describe these religions mixed with popular culture, arguing that they are part of the consumer logic of late capitalism and are enhanced by the growing use of the internet.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1984444", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1984444", "title": "Nineteen Day Feast", "text": "Nineteen Day Feast\n\nNineteen Day Feasts are regular community gatherings, occurring on the first day of each month of the Baháʼí calendar (and are often nineteen days apart from each other). Each gathering consists of a Devotional, Administrative, and Social part. The devotional part of the Nineteen Day Feast can be compared to Sunday Services in Christianity, Friday Prayers in Islam, or Saturday Prayers in Judaism, though the non-congregational nature of the Baháʼí Faith and that the Faith has no clergy limits the usefulness of the comparison.\n\nBaháʼís see the Feast in both practical and spiritual terms. It is both an administrative meeting, and at the same time it is an uplifting spiritual event, and thus it has a central purpose to the Baháʼí community life.\n\nThe Nineteen Day Feast serves to increase the unity of the community, and spiritually uplift the community members by having a devotional program, where readings and prayers from the Baháʼí holy writings are shared, and a social program where community members can socialize.\n\nAs an administrative meeting, the Feast provides an opportunity for the community to report news, or other salient items of interest to the community, and allows for communication and consultation between the community and the Local Spiritual Assembly.\n\nWhile attending the Nineteen Day Feast is not obligatory, its importance is stressed since it allows for consultation between the individual members, the community and the Local Spiritual Assembly, as well as increasing the unity of the community.\n\nThe Feast should, if possible, begin on the first day of the new month of the Baháʼí calendar. Attendance is considered a spiritual responsibility, but is not obligatory. The meeting can vary in style between any two communities, but each must have the same format - a devotional portion, followed by a community consultation, followed by a period of socialization. Quite often there is food served, though this is not a requirement. The different portions should not regularly be given undue weight. However, Shoghi Effendi cautioned against too many set forms, or allowing any particular cultural form to become rigid:\n\nThe devotional portion is seen as a means to uplift the spiritual character of the community, and put the members in a spiritual frame of mind, for their own sakes, and so that this spiritual atmosphere may permeate their consultations. The devotional portion usually consists of the reading of prayers and excerpts from the Baháʼí writings. The arts, especially music, have been highly encouraged by Shoghi Effendi in this portion.\n\nBaháʼís are encouraged to consult on all important matters, and the Nineteen Day Feast provides an opportunity to do so. The members also report news, or other salient items of interest to the community. This portion is also the primary outlet of communication between the community and its Local Spiritual Assembly, and recommendations to that body are often consulted upon in the Nineteen Day Feast.\n\nDuring the administrative portion Baháʼís are asked to consult in a specific manner, termed Baháʼí consultation, where people put aside prejudices and personal attitudes and rather fully explore the matters under consultation.\n\nThe Feast is a critical arena for democratic expression within a Baháʼí Community. Baháʼís from other communities may freely attend, though they may not vote on any recommendations that the community may put forward as recommendations to the Local Spiritual Assembly.\n\nPreviously if a non-Baháʼí attended the Feast, guidance was given that the administrative part of the feast should be omitted, or the non-Baháʼí was asked to step outside of the room during the administrative portion of the feast. more recent guidance from the Universal House of Justice has since allowed for the administrative portion of a feast to take place should a non-Baháʼí attend.\n\nThe social portion of the feast is normally accompanied by some refreshments although refreshments can be served at any point. It is the responsibility of the host to provide and personally serve something, even if this simply consists of water.\n\nIt is the responsibility of Local Spiritual Assemblies to ensure that the Nineteen Day Feast is held.\n\nAttendance at the Nineteen Day Feast is not obligatory, but is considered a duty and a privilege for Baháʼís since it is where they can enter into consultation with the rest of the community.\n\nThe Nineteen Day Feast is described by ʻAbdu'l-Bahá as \"The Lord's Supper\", likening it to the Last Supper in Christianity. In this sense, participation at Feast can be seen as slightly analogous to the Christian practice of Communion, though only in the sense that it should provide fellowship and connection between the faithful, God, and each other. This communal sharing of commitment and memory is crucial to both Christian communion, and to the Baháʼí Feast.\n\n\n\n"}

It is in the coastal town of Saen Suk, near the beach of Bangsaen in Chonburi Province. It was established on 8 July 1955, originating from Bangsaen Educational College which was the first regional tertiary educational institute. The university offers degrees in more than 50 programs of study, including 75 master's programs, three EdD programs, and 22 PhD programs.\n\nBurapha University has three campuses: \n\nThe university colors are gray and gold. Gray represents the progress of intellectual knowledge. Gold represents morality. The colors represent University's commitment to the intellectual knowledge and morality.\n\nIn September 2016, Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha invoked Section 44 of the interim charter allowing him to form a special panel to take over administration of the university as it was judged to be incapable of administering itself.\n\nThe university began as Bangsaen Educational College established on 8 July 1955, the first tertiary educational institution outside of Bangkok established to encourage teacher education. There were 41 first generation students.\n\nIn 1956 the college received Piboonbumpen School from the Division of General Education to be a demonstration school of the college and renamed it \"Piboonbumpen\" Demonstration School.\n\nIn 1984, when the Prasarnmitr College of Education in Bangkok was upgraded to university level and named Srinakharinwirot University, Bangsaen Educational College was included as a branch campus and started to offer degrees besides teacher education. In 1988, the cabinet was agreed to transform its status to become a new university and In 1990, as a result of the implementation the Thai government's Eastern Seaboard Development Project to industrialize the area, the Bangsaen Campus was upgraded to full university level and renamed Burapha University, which means \"University of the East\".\n\nFor more effective pedagogical management; for instance, Chanthaburi Campus was established in 1996 and one year later Sakaeo Campus was established.\n\nAside from its status as a government university, many students are drawn to the institution due to its location in Bangsaen, a resort destination popular with Thai tourists (particularly day visitors from Bangkok) that remains relatively unknown to foreign visitors.\n\nIn addition, the university contains service centers such as the Institute of Marine Science, whose aquarium is a major tourist attraction, the Library Center, the Academic Services Center, the Computer Center, and the University Hospital, which provides extensive medical services to the surrounding community.\n\nBurapha University has three campuses, which together cover about 1,353.35 acres (5.48 km2) of land.

{"id": "1984448", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1984448", "title": "Scorpio Sky", "text": "Scorpio Sky\n\nSchuyler Andrews (born April 2, 1983) is an American professional wrestler and mixed martial artist, better known by his ring name Scorpio Sky who is signed to All Elite Wrestling (AEW), where he is a member of SoCal Uncensored. He is best known for his appearances with Ring of Honor, Total Nonstop Action Wrestling and Pro Wrestling Guerrilla, but has also appeared for Wrestling Society X, WWE, Osaka Pro Wrestling in Japan, Westside Xtreme Wrestling in Germany and in England. He competes for the Championship Wrestling from Hollywood promotion, where he was the CWFH Heritage Heavyweight Champion and was the promotions inaugural Television Champion.\n\nAndrews took an interest in wrestling at a very young age, idolizing the likes of Bret Hart, Ric Flair, and The Midnight Express. In high school he trained with the wrestling team to gain experience. After graduating, Scorpio Sky joined the Revolution Pro Rudos Dojo along with Quicksilver and Chris Bosh. Sky debuted in Revolution Pro in June 2002 as a masked wrestler named Gallinero Tres in a match with Top Gun Talwar. After losing the match he spent the rest of 2002 under the mask from June until November when he re-debuted as Scorpio Sky in the Rudos Dojo \"Fight For the Revolution\" Battle Royal, a tournament where the winner would receive a Revolution Pro contract. The finals saw Sky face Quicksilver. The match went to a draw and both men were given contracts.\n\nAfterward, Sky and Quicksilver formed a tag team known as the Aerial Xpress (AXP). AXP received a strong push, defeating several other tag teams (such as Super Dragon and TARO) and were named the Southern California Tag Team of the Year for 2003. They also won the 2003 Revolution Pro Tag Team of the Year award. Sky won the 2003 Revolution Pro Wrestling Rookie of the Year award after winning the Revolution Pro Wrestling Junior Heavyweight Title by defeating Super Dragon on August 4, 2003. On October 18 he defeated Lost to become the last man to hold the APW-LA Light Heavyweight Championship and co-owned the Alternative Wrestling Show Tag Team Titles with Quicksilver. Later the APW-LA Lightweight title would become the AWS Light Heavyweight Title and Sky was named the first champion. Sky lost the Revolution Pro Junior title to Rising Son in December 2003 in a ladder match. His January 2004 rematch had to be postponed when doctors found he needed emergency surgery, which would sideline him for two months. He regained his title March 6, 2004 and remained champion for 10 months, surviving many title defenses. In the Summer of 2004, Sky and Scott Lost toured for Osaka Pro Wrestling in Japan. On October 16 Scorpio Sky won the \"Revolution J Tournament\", by defeating Super Dragon, Quicksilver and Joey Harder in a 4-way match. In November 2004 he debuted in Combat Zone Wrestling in a \"SoCal\" match. AXP once again were named the Southern California Tag Team of the Year. In December 2004, Revolution Pro Wrestling held its final show where Sky lost the Revolution Pro Junior Heavyweight title to his partner Quicksilver.\n\nSky joined Pro Wrestling Guerrilla (PWG), a new promotion owned by SoCal wrestlers Super Dragon, Joey Ryan, Disco Machine, Topgun Talwar, Scott Lost and Excalibur. \nIn PWG, Sky and Quicksilver hooked back up with Dino Winwood as their manager to chase the PWG World Tag Team Championship. They received a shot at the champions Arrogance (Chris Bosh and Scott Lost), but were unable to dethrone them. On February 12, 2005 the Aerial Xpress was given a rematch for the PWG Tag Team Title but were once again defeated by Bosh and Lost. Later in June, The AXP defeated Los Luchas (Zokre and Phoenix Star), thus becoming #1 contenders for the PWG tag team title. Bosh and Lost forced through stipulations that if the AXP lost the match, not only would that be their last tag team title opportunity, but they would also be forced to remove their masks. The Masks vs. Title Match took place on July 9, 2005 at \"2nd Annual PWG Bicentennial Birthday Extravaganza: Night One\". Quicksilver was taken out of the match due to injury after Bosh hit him with a chair leaving Sky alone. Though outnumbered Sky was able to roll up Lost for a three count. The match would go on to be named the Southern California Match of the Year for 2005. Despite the victory, Sky was assaulted after the match by Lost, Bosh, and \"The Technical Wizard\" Joey Ryan. The three bloodied Scorpio and removed his mask.\n\nThe next night Sky did not show up for a title defense and the Aerial Xpress were forced to vacate the title, and the team split. This led to Sky's \"Disappearance To Africa\" angle. Sky was seemingly out of the wrestling business, but finally made his return in September, without a mask, to attack Scott Lost after his match with Christopher Daniels at PWG's Battle of Los Angeles tournament. This led to a bitter feud between Sky and Lost ending with an \"I Quit Match\" in December, in which Sky was victorious.\n\nSky started 2006 on the sidelines with a knee injury. In February he returned and toured Germany and England on PWG's \"European Vacation\" shows. When they returned to the states Sky feuded with the Human Tornado. During this feud Sky broke Tornado's ankle in a match taking place in Las Vegas. Tornado's then manager Jade Chung turned on him and formed an alliance with Sky. The self-proclaimed \"Scorpio Sky Experience\" became hated by the fans quickly, and helped Sky climb to the top of PWG, defeating the likes of Kevin Steen, Chris Hero, Homicide and Human Tornado. Sky then went on to form a stable known as The Dynasty, consisting of himself, Jade Chung, Joey Ryan, Chris Bosh and Scott Lost.\n\nIt was at this time the rivalry between Sky and Frankie Kazarian began, after Sky assaulted Frankie after a match and cut his hair on May 6, 2006. In June, Sky toured in Europe, performing shows for 1PW, IPW, and Lucha Vavoom in England and the Netherlands. He competed in PWG's Battle of Los Angeles 2006 tournament on September 2, but was eliminated by Kazarian via disqualification after Jade Chung's interference. After Sky, Chris Bosh and Scott Lost defeated Kazarian and his tag team partners Chris Sabin and Alex Shelley, Frankie had enough and challenged Scorpio to a \"Loser Leaves PWG\" match which was to take place in January. On January 13, 2007 Scorpio Sky lost a \"Loser Leaves PWG\" match to Kazarian ending their nine-month-long feud and forcing Scorpio out of PWG.\n\nSoon after, The Dynasty seemingly brought Scorpio Sky back to PWG, but it was actually an impostor Sky who was noticeably smaller than the original. The \"real\" Sky would eventually come into the ring out of the crowd and beat the fake Scorpio Sky out of the building. In the summer of 2007, Sky and Joey Ryan feuded, ending with Sky defeating Joey Ryan and thus winning his reinstatement back into PWG. In October Sky made his official return to PWG teaming with The Young Bucks (Nick and Matt Jackson) to defeat Los Luchas (Zokre, Phoenix Star and Nemesis) in a 6-man tag. He then defeated Ronin at \"All Star Weekend 6\" before teaming with him in a Round Robin Tournament defeating Los Luchas in the first round.\n\nOn July 30, 2010 Scorpio Sky made his return to Pro Wrestling Guerrilla to compete against Scott Lost in Lost's retirement match. Sky defeated Lost after hitting him with his own \"Big Fat Kill\" finishing move. After the match they shook hands and bid goodbye to the fans. During the summer of 2011, Sky once again began regularly working for PWG, reforming the Dynasty with Joey Ryan. On August 20, Sky and Ryan defeated the RockNES Monsters (Johnny Goodtime and Johnny Yuma) to become the number one contenders to the PWG World Tag Team Championship. On September 10, Sky and Ryan failed to capture the PWG World Tag Team Championship from The Young Bucks. Sky's final PWG appearance came on December 1, 2012 when he defeated Joey Ryan in a single's match.\n\nSky participated in MTV's Wrestling Society X (WSX). In WSX, Sky had the gimmick of being \"the best athlete in history...of Montclair High\" and carried around two plaques that were awards he had won. He competed against the likes of Matt Sydal, Jack Evans, and 6-Pac. The show was not picked up for a second season.\n\nSky began working regularly for the Empire Wrestling Federation (EWF) in 2007 quickly making waves in the Inland Title Series Tournament. He defeated JT Blackstar and Ryan Taylor to advance to the finals where he would lose to Brandon Gatson. The match was nominated for the 2007 Match of the Year. Early in the year 2008, Sky chased for the EWF Heavyweight Championship held by Gatson. After defeating Dan Kobrick in a singles match he competed in a 4-way with Korbick, Bino Gambino and Gatson for the title. He was unsuccessful in winning being eliminated by Kobrick after a superkick from Gatson. Scorpio Sky then earned a shot at Gatson's Heavyweight Title after defeating Dan \"The Man\" Kobrick and Terex in a #1 contender's three-way dance. After the match, Gatson went out to congratulate Sky and then leveled him with a superkick. Their match at the \"12th Anniversary Extravaganza\" was one of the most hyped matches in the history of the EWF and held the rare distinction of being scheduled for 2 out of 3 falls. In another match of the year candidate, Scorpio Sky went on the defeat Gatson 2 falls to 1 and become the EWF Heavyweight Champion on May 2, 2008.\n\nLater that month on May 31 he defeated Lil Cholo and Karl Anderson in the AWS promotion to win the AWS Heavyweight Title, again becoming a double champion and being dubbed the \"King of SoCal\". Sky would successfully defend his EWF Heavyweight title 11 times over the summer defeating the likes of Ryan Taylor, Scott Lost and Joey Ryan in the process. On August 16 Sky lost the AWS heavyweight title to Scott Lost. Days later it was announced that he had suffered a serious back injury leading to him relinquishing the EWF heavyweight title on August 22. On April 26, 2009 Sky defeated Johnny Paradise to become #1 Contender for the AWS Heavyweight title. He faced Scott Lost for the title on May 17 but was unsuccessful due to a double count-out finish. On July 10, 2009, Sky defeated nine other men in a cash out match to become the first EWA Champion. On August 22 at XPW's 10 Year Anniversary Show Sky and Luke Hawx won the XPW World Tag Team Titles by defeating Matt Cross and Tool. On June 19, 2010 Sky would win the world record 159 man battle royal in AWS.\n\nIn 2011, it was revealed that Sky would take part in a new hiphop/pro wrestling collaboration, the Urban Wrestling Federation, with taping of the first event \"First Blood\" taking place on June 3.\n\nOn January 7, 2016 Scorpio Sky competed on the debut PCW (Pacific Coast Wrestling) show in Torrance, California defeating TJ Perkins in the semi-main event. He defeated Kenny King at their second show on March 26, 2016. On May 6, 2016 Scorpio Sky defeated Frankie Kazarian at the EWF 20th anniversary show.\n\nOn October 16, 2016 Scorpio Sky defeated DJ Zema Ion, Ricky Starks and Aaron Solow in a Fatal 4-Way for the Sideshow Championship at the inaugural WrestleCircus debut show.\n\nSky would hold the Sideshow title until early 2017 when he was pinned by Leva Bates. Sky would then go on to defeat Michael Elgin, Brody King, Mr. 450, and Andy Daulton en route to challenging Cody Rhodes for the ROH World title at Wrestle Circus \"Cody Rhodes Summer Show\". Cody would pin Sky after hitting Cross Rhodes onto a pile of thumbtacks. At the one-year anniversary show, CircusMania Sky pinned Sammy Guevara after hitting the Ace of Spades.\n\nOn September 17, 2010 the Hollywood-based NWA territory launched a weekly television show on KDOC. Sky's first appearance on \"NWA Championship Wrestling From Hollywood\" came on October 8, 2010 challenging Adam Pearce for the NWA World Heavyweight title. He came very close to winning but Pearce used a low blow followed by a piledriver to secure the victory. After the match, Rocky Romero & Claudio Castagnoli attacked Sky from behind. Joey Ryan and Willie Mack would come to Sky's aid leading to a 6-Man tag match on October 22. Joey Ryan, Willie Mack, and Scorpio Sky were successful. Sky's next appearance came in a losing effort to former partner Joey Ryan in a one on one matchup on November 5.\n\nOn the December 3rd edition Sky was seen laid out in the dressing room from an attack. On December 10 Sky faced and defeated \"Pretty\" Peter Avalon. On the January 7th edition Sky defeated Austin Aries in a 1 on 1 match. Soon after it was announced that the Sky/Aries rivalry would continue in a Best of 5 Series of matches. The second match between the 2 took place on February 4; Aries was the winner injuring Scorpio Sky's knee in the process. Two weeks later Aries & NWA World Heavyweight Champion Adam Pearce defeated Sky & Joey Ryan in a tag team match on February 18. Sky would get his revenge on March 12 when he defeated Aries in Match 3 of their series; pinning him after a vicious knee strike to the face. Aries wouldn't stay down long as he defeated Sky on March 18 in Match 4, giving him a concussion with a series of blows to the head. The 5th and final match in the series took place on May 7. Sky forced Aries to tap out to a figure 8 like submission hold but would refuse to release it after the match ended. The referee was forced to disqualify Sky and reverse the decision.\n\nOn July 2 Sky defeated Peter Avalon in the 1st round of the \"Be A Star\" Television title tournament. On July 30 he defeated James Morgan in the 2nd round. Finally, on July 10, 2011, Sky pinned So Cal Crazy after hitting the \"Ace of Spades\" to win the tournament and become NWA Hollywood's first Television champion. Sky's first title defense came on September 17 when he defeated Ray Rosas. He would once again defend his title on October 22 against Willie Mack. Despite Mack coming very close, Sky was able to pick up the victory after delivering the Ace of Spades. Shortly after Sky assembled a stable known as \"The Experience\" with strength coach Big Duke and agent Xtian Cole. The Experience would often be escorted to the ring by women and begin every match with a ring girl circling the ring with an \"Experience\" placard. On 12 May 2012, NWA Hollywood ran its first non-TV event in its history, with Scorpio Sky defending the Television Championship against Nick Madrid as it main event.\nSky would defend the Television title 3 more times before his year-long title run ended losing it to Willie Mack on July 22, 2012.

After two singles, Chelsea and April left the group due to the difficulties of adjusting to life as a J-pop idol (neither spoke any Japanese when the group was formed) and to pursue other careers, such as modeling.\n\nLehua Sandbo was then recruited as a member, and the group made two more singles until DeLaunay, who also had difficulties adjusting, left to pursue a career in theater. After DeLaunay left, the group switched from the Sony Music Entertainment Japan label to the Zetima label. Between \"Watashi mo 'I Love You'\" of Sony Music Entertainment Japan and \"Jōnetsu Yuki Miraisen\" of Zetima, sales increased by almost a quarter according to Oricon charts.\n\nAfter one more single, Sandbo, too, retired from the group, went on to the American pageant circuit, and eventually married and gave birth to a daughter. The remaining duo, Todd and Kimura, never released anything else under the Coconuts Musume name, though they contributed to Hello!

It has been the parliamentary majority in the Supreme Council since 2005. The party's Russian-origin name, \"Obnovlenie\", can interchangeably be translated as either \"Renovation\" or \"Renewal\", though the latter is generally preferred.\n\nThe party was founded as a political non-governmental organisation in 2000. Then in the legislative elections of 10 December 2000, it won 7 out of 43 seats.\n\nIn the 27 March 2005 local council elections, the party campaigned under the current name above, and won the majority of the seats for the first time in its five-year history. It improved on 11 December 2005 to win 23 of those 43 seats (with another 6 seats going to allies). Since the legislative elections of 2005, it is the majority party in the Supreme Council. The party's leaders in parliament during 2005 were Mikhail Burla and Yevgeny Shevchuk. The latter was elected speaker (chairman) of parliament following the party's sweeping December 2005 win.\n\nIt was officially registered as a full political party in June 2006.\n\nThere was a debate regarding the position of \"Obnovlenie\" in regards to Transnistrian president Igor Smirnov. Most analysts pointed to the party's opposition status, noting that it is not allied with President Igor Smirnov, whose party, Respublica, lost several seats to Renewal in the latest parliamentary election. However, others claim that the interests of the \"Smirnov clan\" are represented in all political movements of Transnistria, including Renewal.\n\n\"Obnovlenie\" strengthened their majority in the 2010 elections to 25 seats. In the 2011 presidential election, deputy party chairman Anatoliy Kaminski ran against incumbent Smirnov and Shevchuk, who ran as an independent. Shevchuk defeated Kaminski in the run-off.\n\nDuring Yevgeny Shevchuk's presidency, \"Obnovlenie\" held a majority in the Supreme Council of Transnistria and was mildly opposed to his policies. On 25 December 2012, the Supreme Council voted against a new state budget proposed by the government. Thus Transnistria is currently functioning without adopted state budget for the first time in its history. In spite of attempts to find compromise and formation of the joint commission to resolve conflict, these attempts did not lead to any results. In 2012-2013 members of the Supreme Council from the \"Obnovlenie\" Party voted against a number of important bills proposed by President Shevchuk and by Prime Minister Pyotr Stepanov, including bills aimed to reform Internal Revenue Code and to introduce value-added taxation in Transnistria.\n\nIn the 2015 legislative elections, \"Obnovlenie\" strengthened their majority by winning 10 more seats in the Supreme Council. Their candidate for the 2016 presidential election, Vadim Krasnoselsky, was also victorious, defeating incumbent president Yevgeny Shevchuk with 62.3% of the vote.\n\n"}

It is the first book in the \"Three Investigators\" series.\n\nThree boys are investigating a known haunted house, Terror Castle, in hopes that perhaps the famous film director Alfred Hitchcock would use it in his upcoming movie. Having just launched their investigation firm, the Three Investigators are hoping for a triumphant success to gain publicity and build their credibility. They briefly gain an audience with the skeptical Hitchcock, who is dismissive but agrees to introduce their case if they are able to demonstrate that the castle is truly haunted.\n\nTerror Castle is the former home of movie actor Stephen Terrill, who died in a possibly suicidal car accident that occurred as his career was on the verge of collapse. Terrill had pledged to haunt his former home to keep anyone else from living there. During their investigations, the boys find very scary and seemingly real activities going on in the abandoned structure, such as the Fog of Fear and the Blue Phantom.\n\nA movie based on this book aired on Disney XD on March 19, 2010 and then aired another one on April 2010. It was rebroadcast on October 2, 2010 and again on March 3, 2011 and aired again on July 25, 2012.\n\nThe plot of the movie differs significantly from that of the book. In the movie, Stephen Terrill is an inventor rather than a silent film actor; and many of the apparently supernatural occurrences are actually Terrill's inventions which continue to operate in the house. The 'haunting' is also partly the work of art thief Victor Hugenay.\n\nIn 1984, an audio adaptation based on the book was released on cassette (BOW-100) by Rainbow Communications Limited of England. It was adapted by Edward Kelsey and directed by Tony Bilbow.\n"}
{"id": "1984471", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1984471", "title": "Prosphora", "text": "Prosphora\n\nA prosphoron (, \"offering\") is a small loaf of leavened bread used in Orthodox Christian and Greek Catholic (Byzantine) liturgies. The plural form is \"prosphora\" (). The term originally meant any offering made to a temple, but in Orthodox Christianity it has come to mean specifically the bread offered at the Divine Liturgy (Eucharist).\n\nProsphoro is made from only four ingredients, wheat flour (white), yeast, salt, and water. Salt was not used in early times and is still not used in the Greek Orthodox Church of Jerusalem.\n\nAny member of the church who is in good standing and whose conscience is clean may bake prosphora. Often in a parish church the women will take turns baking the prosphora; in monasteries, the task is often assigned by the Hegumen (abbot or abbess) to one or several monastics of virtuous life.\n\nIt is common but not necessary to go to confession before baking prosphora, and it is often done in the morning while fasting. Sometimes, special kitchen implements are used for making the prosphora which are used for no other purpose. There may be special prayers said before commencing, and the baker tries to maintain a religious state of mind throughout, often saying the Jesus Prayer. Usually enough prosphora for a number of services are baked at the same time.\n\nA prosphoron is made up of two separate round pieces of leavened dough which are placed one on top of another and baked together to form a single loaf. This double-loaf represents the two natures of Christ: human and divine. Before baking, each prosphoron is stamped with a special seal called \"sphragis\" or \"Panagiari\", usually bearing, among other things, the image of a cross with the Greek letters IC XC NIKA (\"Jesus Christ conquers\") around the arms of the cross. This impression is baked into the bread and serves as a guide for the priest who will be cutting it.\n\nIn the Slavic practice (Russian Orthodox, Bulgarian Orthodox, Serbian Orthodox, etc.) five smaller prosphora are used (in commemoration of the five loaves Jesus used to feed the multitudes). In the Greek practice one larger prosphoron is used (in commemoration that all share in one \"Bread\" ).\n\nIn the part of the Divine Liturgy (Eucharist) known as the Liturgy of Preparation (\"Proskomedia\"), a cube is cut from the center of the prosphoron, and is referred to as the Lamb (). It is this Lamb which is consecrated to become the Body of Christ and from it both the clergy and the faithful will receive Holy Communion, while the remainder of the prosphora is cut up for the \"antidoron\", the blessed bread which is distributed at the end of the Liturgy.\n\nThe motto \"the loaf of Nature's kitchen table,\" a common metaphor for returning thanks and agape (unconditional love) back to nature, is derived from prosphora.\n\nProsphora can vary in size and imprinted design in different liturgical traditions. Generally, the Slavic traditions use five small prosphora with a simpler stamp, while the Greek-Byzantine tradition uses one large prosphoron with a more complex stamp, indicating the place from which the Lamb is to be taken and the places from which particles are removed for each of the remaining commemorations.\n\nIn addition to the Lamb, particles are removed from the prosphoron to commemorate the following:\n\nThe Slavic tradition uses a separate prosphoron for each of these, sometimes with a different seal for each prosphoron—or at least a distinctive one for the \"Panagia\". The laity may also present smaller prosphora together with a list of the faithful living and departed whom they wish to have commemorated during the Liturgy. From each of these smaller prosphora the priest will remove a triangular piece as well as several smaller particles while he prays for each of the persons listed.\n\nThe Prosphoron from which a particle is removed in honor of the Theotokos (Virgin Mary) is called \"Panagia\" (ἄρτος τῆς Παναγίας) and is solemnly blessed in her honour during the Divine Liturgy. This prosphoron is often stamped with an icon of the Theotokos. Before cutting this prosphoron, the priest makes the Sign of the Cross over it three times with the liturgical spear, saying:\n\nIn honour and commemoration of our most blessed Lady, the Theotokos and Ever-virgin Mary; through whose intercessions accept, O Lord, this sacrifice upon Thy most heavenly Altar.\n\nHe then removes a large, triangular particle and places it to the side of the Lamb, as he says: \"At Thy right hand stood the queen, arrayed in vesture wrought of gold and diverse colours.\"\n\nThe remainder of the prosphoron is blessed over the holy table, before the blessing of the antidoron, with the phrase \"Great is the name of the Holy Trinity.\" Today, this practice is usually performed only in some monasteries.\n\nAfter the Liturgy, a triangular portion is cut from the prosphoron by the refectorian (monk in charge of the refectory). The \"Panagia\" is then cut in half and laid crust downwards on a dish in a small table in the refectory. After the meal, the refectorian takes off his epanokamelavkion and kamilavkion, saying, \"Bless me, holy Fathers, and pardon me a sinner,\" to which the brotherhood replies, \"May God pardon and have mercy on you.\" Then, taking the \"Panagia\" in his fingertips, he lifts it up while saying, \"Great is the Name,\" and then the community continues with \"of the Holy Trinity.\" The rite then continues with \"All-holy Mother of God, help us\" with the reply \"At her prayers, O God, have mercy and save us.\" Two hymns are then sung while the refectorian, accompanied by a cleric with a hand censer, offers the \"Panagia\" to those assembled. Each takes a piece between his finger and thumb, passes it through the incense, and then eats it.\n\nThere are also loaves which are baked for blessing and distribution to the faithful outside of the Divine Liturgy. These are generally called \"artos\" (\"loaves\") and are usually made from a single round of dough rather than two. They may be stamped with the same seal used at the Liturgy, though usually they have only a simple cross or an icon such as the patron saint of the local church or monastery. Five loaves are usually made, and they are blessed at a service called the Artoklasia (\"breaking of bread\"). These loaves, together with wheat, wine, and oil, are blessed and distributed to the faithful during the All-Night Vigil.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1984506", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1984506", "title": "Benenden School", "text": "Benenden School\n\nBenenden School is an independent boarding school for girls in Kent, England. It is located in Hemsted Park at Benenden in the Kent countryside, between Cranbrook and Tenterden.\n\nToday Benenden remains an all-boarding school for over 500 girls aged 11 to 18. The headmistress is Samantha Price (previously head of Godolphin School, Salisbury, Wiltshire), who took over from Claire Oulton in January 2014.\n\nThe school occupies a Victorian mansion, set in 240 acres of gardens and woodland in the Weald of Kent. Living, learning, sporting and leisure facilities are clustered around the original 19th-century mansion. There have been, and continue to be, many improvements to the site. There is a sports centre (known as \"SPLASH\"), a humanities building (\"Leelands\"), a design technology centre, study centre (Clarke Centre) and a theatre and drama teaching complex (completed summer 2007) at the cost of £2.3 million. The study centre consists of the Eugenia Leung Library and classrooms. A new science centre, one of the most advanced centres of scientific learning available in the independent sector, was opened by the Princess Royal on 10 October 2012. The school's most recent enhancement has been the construction of an all-weather sports pitch and pavilion in September 2016.\n\nThe grounds which the school now occupies are known as Hemsted Park. The earliest available records show the land in the possession of Odo, Earl of Kent, the man believed to have commissioned the Bayeux Tapestry, having been given it—among much other property in the county—by his half-brother William the Conqueror.\n\nThe first property on the site was a house built by Robert of Hemsted in 1216. In the late 14th century, Richard II granted the manor to William of Guldeford. Elizabeth I visited Thomas Guldeford at the house and he was knighted by her at Rye a few days later.\n\nIn 1718 the property was sold to Admiral Sir John Norris, the commander-in-chief of George II's navy. He did a lot of work landscaping the property, forming much of the park as it is now.\n\nThomas Hallett Hodges bought the house in 1786. He reduced the size of the building and filled in the moat that had until that point encircled it. He also created the lake in the grounds.\nThe Elizabethan property was demolished in 1860 following the acquisition of the estate by Lord Cranbrook. He commissioned the building of a new house, the extant Hemsted House, employing David Brandon, president of the Royal Institute of British Architects to design the new mansion. The house, which featured a prominent tower and was described as having \"alarming vitality\" was subsequently remodelled in 1912 by Herbert Cescinsky at the behest of its new owner, newspaper magnate and later Lord Rothermere, Harold Harmsworth. The remodelling saw the \"vitality\" toned down and the upper levels of the tower removed. It is now listed at grade II.\n\nThe school was founded in 1923 by three teachers from Wycombe Abbey, Christine Sheldon CBE, Anne Hindle MBE and Kathleen Bird, who aimed to create a \"happy school with personal integrity and service to others always in mind, where everyone would be given the chance to follow her own bent\". It hence maintains sister school ties with Wycombe Abbey, as well as Godstowe Preparatory School, High Wycombe, and St Leonards School.\n\nIn July 1923 the first council meeting of the new school was held and 24 girls were registered. The new school had a temporary home in Bickley for the first term while the three founders set about finding a new permanent site, requiring at least 70 bedrooms and large grounds. In January 1924 Hemsted Park, near Benenden village in Kent, was leased to the Founders and the school was named Benenden School, to avoid confusion with Hemel Hempstead. In March 1924 The Benenden School (Kent) Limited prospectus was issued at £10 each; five shares entitled the holder to give a nomination to the school. Every parent was encouraged to pay a year's fees in advance. In September 1924 there were 126 girls on the school roll and in October 1924 the new Benenden School purchased Hemsted House for £20,000.\n\n1927 was an important year for Benenden with the roll reaching 200. The first general inspection was made and Benenden was recognised as 'efficient'. The Seniors' Association was established and the school magazine was inaugurated.\n\nAs the school grew, so more boarding houses were established or constructed: Norris House in 1924, Medway and Marshall in 1925, Echyngham in 1930 and Guldeford in 1936. The dining room was also built in 1936 with the school hall following in 1938.\n\nThe school was evacuated to Newquay in 1940. The school moved to the Hotel Bristol in Newquay, Cornwall, with Christine Sheldon and Kathleen Bird, two of the founders. Anne Hindle stayed at Benenden to look after the estate. She persuaded the Ministry of Health to use Benenden as a military hospital. On 3 August 1944, Capitaine Jean Maridor, a Free French pilot, died saving the school buildings and military hospital from being struck by a German V-1 flying bomb.\n\nThe founders retired in 1954 and Elizabeth Clarke CVO became Headmistress. In 1963 Princess Anne and Princess Basma of Jordan became pupils at Benenden. Janet Allen became Headmistress in 1976. The Jubilee Wing was opened by Janet Allen and Kathleen Bird in 1977.\n\nGillian duCharme became Headmistress in 1985. The new Guldeford House opened the following year. The 1987 hurricane hit Benenden hard and over 250 trees were lost in the parkland.\n\nFurther expansion to the school began with the opening of the new science and medical wing, Leelands, in 1988. SPLASH opened in 1990. Two further sixth-form houses opened in 1993 (Limes and Oaks).\n\nThe 75th anniversary of the school was celebrated in 1998–99 with a service at St Paul's Cathedral, a programme of special events for Seniors at Benenden, St James's Palace and other London venues. The book \"Benenden: A Great Company\" by David Souden was published. The school play, written for the occasion, \"A Great Company\" was performed at Her Majesty's Theatre, Haymarket.\n\nClaire Oulton, Head of St Catherine's Bramley and a graduate from Somerville College, Oxford, was appointed Headmistress in 2000.\n\nIn 2001 the Clarke Centre with the Eugenia Leung Library was completed. Norris House was redeveloped in 2003, creating new study bedrooms. The school dining room and cloisters were refurbished. The \"new stage\" theatre fundraising campaign was launched.\n\nThe new theatre was opened by Helena Bonham Carter in 2007 and \"Grease\" was its first production in December that year. The Seniors' Window was added to the chapel as part of a refurbishment and rededication. The following year the eco-classroom, a totally self-sustaining building, opened in the Victorian Water Gardens. A new cafe was added to the dining room in 2010.\n\nThe Benenden Science Centre was opened officially by the Princess Royal on 10 October 2012. The Leelands building was refurbished and became a classroom block for Humanities subjects.\n\nThe new All-Weather Pitch and Pavilion was officially opened by television personality Davina McCall on 10 September 2016. Primarily for Lacrosse and Hockey, the new facility allows girls to train in all weather and in the mornings and evenings. After their first season training on the new pitch, Benenden's 1st lacrosse team won the National Schools Championships.\n\nBenenden is a full-boarding school and has around 540 to 550 girls. Benenden says that its boarding ethos is to complement, not replace, family life. All students live in one of ten boarding houses. There are six junior boarding houses (ages 11–16), consisting of Marshall, Medway, Guldeford, Echyngham, Norris and Hemsted. The senior students, in their last two years (16–18), go to sixth-form houses called Beeches, Elms, Limes and Oaks, which make up the sixth-form centre, known as Founders. Sixth-formers remain members of their junior house and take up positions of responsibility in them. Founders has 184 single study bedrooms.\n\nEach boarding house has a housemistress or housemaster, a deputy housemistress or housemaster, a team of matrons (resident, day and evening) as well as tutors. All teaching staff and a significant number of administrative staff are house tutors. The role of the tutor is to provide individual weekly support and guidance.\n\nBenenden's stated aim is for its academic programme to encourage a lifelong enthusiasm for learning and discovery. The school has two main objectives: for every girl to achieve the best possible academic standards and qualifications, and for each girl to experience the maximum enjoyment in her learning. The curriculum is traditional, but also broad and forward-looking enough to provide education in its widest sense.\n\nThere is a traditional school hall where morning prayers are taken. The entire school must assemble for this every morning, except Wednesday, Saturday and Sunday, at 8:30. There is also a small chapel. Occasionally, the Sunday services are taken in the village church, about 15 to 20 minutes' walk away.\n\nLessons at the school start at 9 am and carry on until 5:30 pm. There are six periods in the day; each lesson is one hour long. Sports practices take place during the lunch break as well as after lessons end. In addition there are two hours' worth of lessons on Saturday mornings. Younger students will take a mixture of all subjects offered, as well as sports, music and PSHE classes.\n\nPupils studying for their GCSEs must generally take 10 or 11 subjects, including Mathematics, Science and English and one modern language. Classes average around 13 students at GCSE, and 6–8 students during A Levels. Drama and the Arts are popular; the school's annual play has on occasion been performed in London theatres such as the Palladium (\"Me and My Girl\"; 2002). The 2007 play was \"Grease\", held in the new theatre, completed in February 2007. Productions since then have included \"A Christmas Carol\", \"Tess of the d'Urbervilles\", \"Grimm Tales\", \"Beauty and the Beast\", \"Romeo and Juliet\", \"Kiss Me Kate\" and \"Les Miserables\".\n\nThe school years are known, in order, as follows: Fourths (IV), Upper Fourths (UIV), Lower Fifths (LVths), Fifths (V), Upper Fifths (UV), Six Ones (VI1) and Six Twos (VI2). Each year around 24 school prefects are nominated, called Upper Sixths. Instead of wearing the normal navy blue sixth-form uniform, they wear white- and red-striped blouses and grey jumpers. The prefects are known as \"grey jumpers\".\n\nBenenden offers a range of extracurricular activities. The belief is that these lead to a more rounded education and strongly favour individualism.\n\nMain school sports include, lacrosse, netball, rounders and tennis. Girls often play these at county and sometimes national levels; a current senior England lacrosse player was introduced as head of lacrosse in 2008. Other activities include hockey, fencing, badminton, volleyball, swimming, golf, riding, judo, tae kwondo, trampolining, rounders, football, aerobics, athletics, rugby sevens (Kent Girls Under-18 Champions 2009) and squash. Tours abroad are occasionally organised.\n\nFormer pupils of Benenden School are known as Seniors.\n\n\nKent Music Summer School has been held at Benenden School since 1948.\n\n\n"}

The council originated from the Derby Council, voting to organize as a first class council at its annual meeting on January 25, 1923. The council had jurisdiction over Scouting in Ansonia, Shelton and Seymour in addition to Derby, with the town of Oxford incorporated into the council at a later date. It has been headquartered in Derby, Connecticut since its founding.\n\nThe Housatonic Council owns and operates Edmund D. Strang Scout Reservation in Goshen, Connecticut. Paugassett Lodge, of the Order of the Arrow, serves this council.\n\nHousatonic Council's geographic area includes the following Lower Naugatuck Valley towns of Derby, Ansonia, Seymour, Shelton and Oxford.\n\nHousatonic Council is notable for being one of the smallest in the Boy Scouts of America. Despite several waves of council mergers instituted nationwide in the modern era, Housatonic Council's current composition is only one town larger than it was when it elevated to a full council in 1923. It is not uncommon for modern BSA councils to cover as many counties as Housatonic Council has towns.\n\nEdmund D. Strang Scout Reservation (ESSR), formally called Housatonic Scout Reservation (HSR), is located in Goshen, Connecticut. It is the only existing camp owned by Housatonic Council. ESSR is a smaller Boy Scout Camp with only . The camp is the home of the Paugassett Lodge. ESSR holds summer and winter Camp programs. Also, the camp is often used for a Fall and Spring Camp-o-ree. During the off-season, the camp is also available for use by outside organizations and Scout Troops, Crews and Packs. The camp is available for use by Housatonic Council \"and\" non-Housatonic Council units.\n\nThe summer program includes four weeks of Boy Scout Resident Camping and one week of Webelos Resident Camping. Boy Scout Resident Camp focuses on Merit Badge advancement. One week of the Boy Scout Resident Camp includes a Venturing program. It comprises a number of trips off-site for a more exciting approach to Scouting. Also, another week includes an Adventure to Eagle Program, where a unit composed of Scouts registered with the A2E program work on Eagle-Required Merit Badges and learn the steps along the Trail to Eagle. Webelos Resident Camp focuses on advancement in the form of Activity Pins.\n\nDuring all four weeks of Boy Scout Resident Camp, a variety of Program Areas are in operation. These Program Areas are Brownsea Island, Field Sports/Shooting Sports, Waterfront, Outdoor Skills, S.T.E.M.,Ecology/Conservation, Health Lodge, Climbing Tower and Handicrafts. The \"Brownsea Island Program,\" formerly known as \"First Class Emphasis,\" focuses on the fundamental skills of Scouting, such as the Patrol Method, First Aid, Hiking, Camping, Fire-Building and Knot-Tying. The Field Sports/Shooting Sports program includes Rifle, Shotgun, Archery and Personal Fitness. Also for troop activities, this Program Area sponsors various Field Sports. As part of an Older Boy Program, the area sponsors Black-Powder Shooting and Action Archery. The Waterfront Area includes Rowing, Swimming, Lifesaving, Small-boat Sailing, Kayaking and Canoeing. Also, early in the morning, the ever popular Polar Bear Swim occurs, where a large group of \"Lunatics\" jumps in the water for a period of singing and fun. There are also designated Free-Swim periods, where anyone may come to the area to swim or boat. Waterfront also offers advancement opportunities with Snorkeling, BSA, Kayaking, BSA, the Mile Swim and BSA Lifeguard. The Outdoor Skills area, formerly known as \"Scoutcraft,\" teaches subjects including Cooking, Pioneering, Wilderness Survival, Camping and Orienteering. Also, Backpacking, Hiking, Totin' Chip, Firm'n Chit and the Paul Bunyan Award are taught by Appointment. Ecology/Conservation, often referred to as \"Econ,\" teaches a large amount of merit badges including Astronomy, Bird Study, Environmental Science, Fish and Wildlife Management, Forestry, Mammal Study, Nature, Soil and Water Conservation and Weather. Insect Study as well as Reptile and Amphibian Study are offered by appointment. The Health Lodge currently offers First Aid. Handicrafts teaches Basketry, Computers, Home Repair, Indian Lore, Leatherwork, Metalwork and Woodcarving. Art is also available by appointment.\n\nCamp Irving was located in Shelton, Connecticut in the Birchbank area along the Housatonic River. The camp was closed in 1945 and the buildings were razed in 1948.\n\nPaugassett Lodge is the Order of the Arrow lodge for the Housatonic Council. Their Algonquian name is translated as \"Muddy Pond\". Their lodge totem in an Iroquois dance mask. The lodge was founded in 1961 and is still in existence. In 2000, the lodge was the recipient of the E. Urner Goodman Award for their effectiveness in promoting and increasing Scout camping in their council.\n\n"}

It has had various purposes over the years, and has been defined in different ways by five RFCs.\n\nPrior to the redefinition, the ToS field could specify a datagram's priority and request a route for low-delay, high-throughput, or highly-reliable service. \nBased on these ToS values, a packet would be placed in a prioritized outgoing queue, or take a route with appropriate latency, throughput, or reliability. In practice, the ToS field never saw widespread use outside of US Department of Defense networks. However, a great deal of experimental, research, and deployment work has focused on how to make use of these eight bits, resulting in the current DS field definition.\n\nThe modern redefinition of the ToS field, also used for the \"Traffic Class\" field in IPv6 packets, is an 8-bit differentiated services field (DS field) which consists of a 6-bit Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP) field and a 2-bit Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) field. While Differentiated Services is somewhat backwards compatible with ToS, ECN is not.\n\nThe Type of Service field in the IP header was originally defined in RFC 791, and has been interpreted for \"IP Precedence\" and \"ToS\" ever since. The definition was largely derived from a US DoD Specification JANAP-128, which defines message precedence. It defined a mechanism for assigning a precedence to each IP packet, as well as a mechanism to request specific treatment such as high throughput, high reliability or low latency, etc. In the RFC 1349 update, the Monetary Cost bit is introduced (this bit was previously marked \"Reserved for Future Use\"). Section 2.4 of RFC 1583 (OSPFv2) introduces a ToS-aware routing method.\n\nIn practice, only the IP Precedence part of the field was ever used outside US DoD networks: the higher the value of the IP Precedence field, the higher the priority of the IP packet. Some US DoD networks did use the delay bit for route selection between oceanic cable paths and Satellite Communication (SATCOM) paths when both paths existed. IPv6 has never had an IPv4-like \"traditional\" ToS field, partially because the authors were aware of DiffServ efforts at its drafting (RFC 2460 Section 7).\n\nIn RFC 2474 the definition of this entire field was changed. It is now called the \"DS\" (Differentiated Services, \"DiffServ\") field and the upper 6 bits contain a value called the \"DSCP\" (Differentiated Services Code Point). The upper 3 bits of DS maintains compatibility with IP Precedence. Since RFC 3168, the remaining two bits (the two least significant bits) are used for Explicit Congestion Notification.\n\nRFC 8622 added lower-effort (LE) DS for traffic that may be pre-empted by other traffic (best-effort traffic). It is intended for background traffic of low precedence, such as bulk data transfers with low priority in time.\n\nPrior to its deprecation, the Type of Service field was defined as follows from RFC 791:\n\nPrecedence was a 3 bit field which treats high priority packets as more important than other packets. If a router is congested and needs to discard some packets, it will discard packets having lowest priority first. Although precedence field was part of IP version 4, it was never used.\n\nRFC 1349 introduced an additional \"lowcost\" field. The four available ToS bits now becomes:\nThe naming here follows the convention of Unix operating systems. RFC 1349 and RFC 1060 only show examples of one bit used at a time for application-default values, although RFC 791 mentions that at most two of the three indications it has should be set nominally. One such use is known from mod_iptos.\n\nBecause the last three bits went through many definitions prior to RFC 2474 (see below), documentation and implementations may be confusing and contradictory.\n\nRFC 2474 (which was released in December 1998) reserved the first six bits of the DS (or IPv4 ToS) field for the Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP), and RFC 3168 reserved the last two bits for Explicit Congestion Notification.\nDSCP defines a Class Selector (CS) naming to each value it defines, mirroring what would have been interpreted as the IP Precedence if one follows the older specification:\n\nDSCP Nomenclature:\n\nThe above table, with individual values written out for values of the entire ToS field (not to be confused with the little-used 5-bit part):\n\nNote: In the above table, ToS is shown in decimal format. However, many routers express ToS in hex format.\n\nLet's start with an IP priority of 1, or codice_1 in Binary. The entire ToS field would then be codice_2, assuming that the unused 5 bits are zero. The DSCP can be interpreted by resegmenting to codice_3, where codice_4 = 8 is the DSCP value.\n\nAlthough not frequently used, IP ToS definitions are widely found in codice_5 of Unix-like or Unix operating systems as codice_6 macros. The \"lowcost\" field is commented out in OpenBSD due to its newer use for indicating ECN support. Remnants of the old RFC 1349 terminology can be found in Transmission 2.93 as well as other tools that support setting this field.\n\nAn old Apache module \"mod_iptos\", once packaged in Ubuntu, notes that a way to use multiple RFC 1349 option bits together emerged after some point.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1984529", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1984529", "title": "Argument-dependent name lookup", "text": "Argument-dependent name lookup\n\nIn the C++ programming language, argument-dependent lookup (ADL), or argument-dependent name lookup, applies to the lookup of an unqualified function name depending on the types of the arguments given to the function call. This behavior is also known as Koenig lookup, as it is often attributed to Andrew Koenig, though he is not its inventor.\n\nDuring argument-dependent lookup, other namespaces not considered during normal lookup may be searched where the set of namespaces to be searched depends on the types of the function arguments. Specifically, the set of declarations discovered during the ADL process, and considered for resolution of the function name, is the union of the declarations found by normal lookup with the declarations found by looking in the set of namespaces associated with the types of the function arguments.\n\nAn example of ADL looks like this:\n\nnamespace NS {\n\nclass A {};\n\n} // namespace NS\n\nint main() {\n\nEven though the function is not in namespace NS, nor is namespace NS in scope, the function is found because of the declared types of the actual parameters in the function call statement. \n\nA common pattern in the C++ Standard Library is to declare overloaded operators that will be found in this manner. For example, this simple Hello World program would not compile if it weren't for ADL:\n\n\nint main() {\n\nUsing codice_1 is equivalent to calling codice_2 without the codice_3 qualifier. However, in this case, the overload of operator« that works for codice_4 is in the codice_5 namespace, so ADL is required for it to be used.\n\nThe following code would work without ADL (which is applied to it anyway):\n\nint main() {\n\nIt works because the output operator for integers is a member function of the codice_6 class, which is the type of codice_7. \nThus, the compiler interprets this statement as\n\nstd::cout.operator«(5); \nwhich it can resolve during normal lookup. However, consider that e.g. the codice_8 overloaded codice_9 is a non-member function in the codice_10 namespace and, thus, requires ADL for a correct lookup:\n/* will print the provided char string as expected using ADL derived from the argument type std::cout */\noperator«(std::cout, \"Hi there\")\n\n/* calls a ostream member function of the operator« taking a void const*, \nwhich will print the address of the provided char string instead of the content of the char string */ \nstd::cout.operator«(\"Hi there\") \n\nThe codice_10 namespace overloaded non-member codice_2 function to handle strings is another example:\n\n/*equivalent to operator«(std::cout, str). The compiler searches the std namespace using ADL due to the type std::string of the str parameter and std::cout */\nstd::cout « str; \n\nAs Koenig points out in a personal note, without ADL the compiler would indicate an error stating it could not find codice_13 as the statement doesn't explicitly specify that it is found in the codice_10 namespace.\n\nFunctions found by ADL are considered part of a class's interface. In the C++ Standard Library, several algorithms use unqualified calls to codice_15 from within the codice_5 namespace. As a result, the generic codice_17 function is used if nothing else is found, but if these algorithms are used with a third-party class, codice_18, found in another namespace that also contains codice_19, that overload of codice_15 will be used.\n\nWhile ADL makes it practical for functions defined outside of a class to behave as if they were part of the interface of that class, it makes namespaces less strict and so can require the use of fully qualified names when they would not otherwise be needed. For example, the C++ standard library makes extensive use of unqualified calls to to swap two values. The idea is that then one can define an own version of std::swap in one's own namespace and it will be used within the standard library algorithms. In other words, the behavior of\n\nnamespace N {\n\nstruct A {};\n\n} // namespace N\n\nA a;\nA b;\n\nstd::swap(a, b);\nmay or may not be the same as the behavior of\n\nusing std::swap;\nswap(a, b);\n\n(where codice_21 and codice_22 are of type codice_23) because if codice_24 exists, the second of the above examples will call it while the first will not. Furthermore, if for some reason both codice_24 and codice_26 are defined, then the first example will call codice_26 but the second will not compile because codice_28 would be ambiguous.\n\nIn general, over-dependence on ADL can lead to semantic problems. If one library, codice_29, expects unqualified calls to codice_30 to have one meaning and another library, codice_31 expects it to have another, then namespaces lose their utility. If, however, codice_29 expects codice_33 to have one meaning and codice_31 does likewise, then there is no conflict, but calls to codice_30 would have to be fully qualified (i.e. codice_36 as opposed to codice_37) lest ADL get in the way.\n\n"}

It is less than east of Pen Mar, Maryland. The population of Blue Ridge Summit was 891 at the 2010 census.\n\nThe community was the birthplace of Wallis Simpson, the wife of Prince Edward, Duke of Windsor (previously King Edward VIII of the United Kingdom). It is also home to one of the 15 oldest golf courses in the United States. Built before 1885, the Monterey Country Club has served as a summer retreat for many Washingtonians, and American presidents Woodrow Wilson, Calvin Coolidge and Dwight D. Eisenhower all played the Monterey Country Club course.\n\nBlue Ridge Summit is located in the southeast corner of Franklin County at the height of land on South Mountain, the northern extension of the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia. It is bordered to the east by Adams County, Pennsylvania, and to the south by Frederick and Washington counties in Maryland. Directly to the south are the communities of Highfield and Cascade in Maryland.\n\nPennsylvania Route 16 passes through Blue Ridge Summit, leading east down the mountain to Emmitsburg, Maryland, and west downhill to Waynesboro, Pennsylvania.

An armed civilian militia encountered a detachment of Confederates under General Albert G. Jenkins. The militia was forced to retreat after a very brief skirmish. General Jenkins and his Confederate troops withdrew toward Hagerstown, joining General Richard S. Ewell, who was advancing with a larger force.\n\nFollowing the events at the Battle of Gettysburg, the Confederate Army retreated via Emmitsburg. On July 5, General J.E.B. Stuart's soldiers were engaged in some small skirmishes as he made his way back to General Robert E. Lee's army. A mountain swamp at Monterey Pass bogged down Stuart and the Army of Northern Virginia as they retreated. The Monterey Country Club sits upon that were once part of that swamp.\n\nFormer Vice President of the United States Dick Cheney sometimes resided in an underground complex near Blue Ridge Summit on Raven Rock Mountain when he was said to be \"at an undisclosed location\" in case of an attack on the United States. The complex is most commonly called \"Site R\", but also Raven Rock Mountain Complex or the Alternate Joint Communications Center, created in 1951 as a command center in the event of attack on Washington, D.C..\n\nBlue Ridge Summit is the 1896 birthplace of Wallis, Duchess of Windsor.\n\n\n"}

Aleph was an early set on the road to the creation of the first practical microkernel operating system, Mach.\n\nAleph used inter-process communications to move data between programs and the kernel, so applications could transparently access resources on any machine on the local area network (which at the time was a 3-Mbit/s experimental Xerox Ethernet). The project eventually petered out after several years due to rapid changes in the computer hardware market, but the ideas led to the creation of Accent at Carnegie Mellon University, leading in turn to Mach.\n\nApplications written for the RIG system communicated via \"ports\". Ports were essentially message queues that were maintained by the Aleph kernel, identified by a \"machine\" unique (as opposed to globally unique) ID consisting of a process id, port id pair. Processes were automatically assigned a process number, or \"pid\", on startup, and could then ask the kernel to open ports. Processes could open several ports and then \"read\" them, automatically blocking and allowing other programs to run until data arrived. Processes could also \"shadow\" another, receiving a copy of every message sent to the one it was shadowing. Similarly, programs could \"interpose\" on another, receiving messages and essentially cutting the original message out of the conversation.\n\nRIG was implemented on a number of Data General Eclipse minicomputers. The ports were implemented using memory buffers, limited to 2 kB in size. This produced significant overhead when copying large amounts of data. Another problem, realized only in retrospect, was that the use of global ID's allowed malicious software to \"guess\" at ports and thereby gain access to resources they should not have had. And since those IDs were based on the program ID, the port IDs changed if the program was restarted, making it difficult to write servers with clients that could rely on a specific port number for service.\n"}

The range extends about 75 miles (120 km) north to south, but are only about 12 miles (19 km) wide at their widest. The highest peak in the San Andres Mountains is Salinas Peak, at 8,965 feet (2,733 m).\n\nThough nearly contiguous with the Organ Mountains to the south, the two are very distinct geologically and botanically. The Oscura Mountains to the north are separated from the San Andres Mountains by Mockingbird Gap and the much lower Little Burro Mountains. The San Andres Mountains are comparatively dry and do not support any extensive woodlands. They are mostly closed to the public, lying almost entirely within the restricted White Sands Missile Range.\n\nThe San Andres Mountains form part of the eastern edge of the rift valley of the Rio Grande, and are made up of west-dipping fault blocks made primarily of San Andres Formation limestone, but also with extensive exposures of reddish Abo Formation sandstone on the western side, and quartz monzonite on the eastern side. Gypsum deposits washed from these mountains are the main source of the dunes in White Sands National Park. \n\nSignificant summits include:\nThe biggest and best desert bighorn sheep habitat in New Mexico is in the San Andres Mountains, which can host up to 400 bighorn. An area of in the southern portion of the San Andres Mountain range was set aside in 1941 as the San Andres National Wildlife Refuge to help preserve the desert bighorn sheep, which at the time numbered 33. In the mid 1970s there were around 200 sheep in the refuge; however, in 1979, a scabies mite epizootic reduced the population from 200 to 75. Subsequent years brought further declines from scabies and other causes until the population consisted of one ewe in 1997. Reintroduction of desert bighorn sheep occurred in 2002 and the herd has now about 80 members.\n\n"}

Most DVD players and Blu-ray players prohibit the viewer from performing a large majority of actions during sections of a DVD that are protected or restricted by this feature, and will display the \"no\" symbol or a message to that effect if any of these actions are attempted. It is used mainly for copyright notices or warnings, such as an FBI warning in the United States, and \"protected\" (i.e., unskippable) commercials.\n\nSome DVD players ignore the UOP flag, allowing the user full control over DVD playback. Virtually all players that are not purpose-built DVD player hardware (for example, a player program running on a general purpose computer) ignore the flag. There are also modchips available for some standard DVD players for the same purpose. The UOP flag can be removed in DVD ripper software such as: DVD Decrypter, DVD Shrink, AnyDVD, AVS Video Converter, Digiarty WinX DVD Ripper Platinum, MacTheRipper, HandBrake and K9Copy. On many DVD players, pressing stop-stop-play will cause the DVD player to play the movie immediately, ignoring any UOP flags that would otherwise make advertisements, piracy warnings or trailers unskippable.\n\nNevertheless, removing UOP does not always provide navigation function in the restricted parts of the DVD. This is because those parts are sometimes lacking the navigation commands which allow skipping to the menu or other parts of the DVD. This has become more common in recent titles, in order to circumvent the UOP disabling that many applications or DVD players offer.\n\nNewer DVD players (c. late 2010) have, however, been designed to override the aforementioned counter-countermeasures. The DVD reader software inside the DVD player automatically generates chapters for parts of the DVD lacking navigation commands, allowing them to be fast-forwarded or skipped; pressing the menu button, even in these previously restricted sections, will cause a jump to the main menu.\n\n\n"}

It was the original world tag team title of WCW and remained active until it was unified with the WWF Tag Team Championship.\n\nThe WCW Tag Team Championship was originally known as the NWA World Tag Team Championship of Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling (MACW) run by Jim Crockett Promotions (JCP). Following the title's introduction in 1975, the Minnesota Wrecking Crew became the inaugural champions on January 29. The title was renamed the WCW World Tag Team Championship in 1991 when Ted Turner bought JCP and it became World Championship Wrestling. Despite the title's name in MMACW, the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) did not recognize its own NWA World Tag Team Championship until 1992, when the NWA held a tournament to crown the first tag team recognized by all of the NWA territories. Terry Gordy and Steve Williams won the tournament.

Soon after, \"The Invasion\" took place in which the WCW/ECW Alliance was ultimately dismantled. During this time, the title was referred to as the WCW Tag Team Championship, with WWF wrestlers winning WCW titles, and WCW wrestlers winning WWF titles.

After school in Rachlau and Bautzen, he studied theology at the University of Leipzig. He was a pastor in Hochkirch (his home parish) from 1834–1837. Because of the death of his uncle he became a pastor in Kotitz. In 1848, he became a pastor in Weigersdorf, Prussia. He rejected the \"growing rationalism\" that was growing among the clergy, calling for a return to Scripture as authoritative, translating a number of German items into Sorbian.\n\nIt was during the year 1854 that about 558 Wendish Lutherans from Kilian's congregations in Prussia and also from Saxony called him to lead them to Texas. Many people in Kilian's congregation were dissatisfied with the philosophy of rationalism spreading through Europe. Some viewed rationalism as an attempt to replace religion with science. With growing religious discontent, economic hardship and Kilian's desire to be a missionary in a foreign country, Kilian brought his followers to Galveston and eventually settled about 55 miles east of Austin in Lee County.\n\nOn March 25, 1854, a new Lutheran congregation was organized at Dauban, to become the cornerstone of a large Wendish emigration. Rev. Kilian was called as Pastor. This move resulted in the establishment of Low Pin Oak Settlement later renamed Serbin. One of the first acts accomplished by Rev. Kilian was to apply for membership in the fledgling Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod. St. Paul's Lutheran Church in Serbin became the first of many Missouri Synod churches in Texas, and it had the only Wendish language speaking school in America.\n\nThe legacy of John Kilian is apparent at the campus of the Concordia University Texas where you will find Kilian Road and the over-150-year-old bell at the entrance of Building A which Kilian and his followers brought on their journey to Texas. At its old campus, the university's first building was named Kilian Hall.\n\n\n"}

The author seems to have needed a word rhyming with words ending in the sound \"or\". It would not be the only example of word creation by Victor Hugo. However, the word is the normal form that the Greek word ἑγρήγορος (Watcher) would take in French. This was the term used in the Book of Enoch for great angel-like spirits.\n\nEliphas Lévi, in \"Le Grand Arcane\" (\"The Great Mystery\", 1868) identifies \"egregors\" with the tradition concerning the \"Watchers\", the fathers of the nephilim, describing them as \"terrible beings\" that \"crush us without pity because they are unaware of our existence.\"\n\nThe concept of the egregore as a group thoughtform was developed in works of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn and the Rosicrucians and has been referenced by writers such as Valentin Tomberg, notably in his anonymously-penned book \"Meditations on the Tarot.\" It was also mentioned in the book El maravilloso universo de la magia, by Chilean author Enrique Barrios.\n\nA well known concept of the egregore is the GOTOS of the Fraternitas Saturni.\n\nGaetan Delaforge, in \"Gnosis\" magazine in 1987, defines an egregore as a kind of group mind that is created when people consciously come together for a common purpose.\n\nThe concept was featured in \"Corporate Metabolism\" series of articles by Paco Xander Nathan, which were published in 2001.\n\nThe notion of \"egregor\" also appears in Daniil Andreyev's \"Roza Mira\", where it represents the shining cloud-like spirit associated with the Church.\n\nEgregore is also used in relation to the Montreal Surrealists, best known as Les Automatistes, in Ray Ellenwood's \"Egregore: a history of the Montréal automatist movement\".\n\nEgregore is also the term for the spiritual personification of each nation in the UK LRP game Empire, run by Profound Decisions.\n\nGary Lachman identifies Pepe the Frog as an egregore in his book \"Dark Star Rising\".\n\n\n"}

While it may be used to express matter or material phenomena, especially that linked to the power of vision in samkhya, it is also used to describe subtle and spiritual realities such as \"svarupa\" meaning the form of the self.\n\nAccording to the Monier-Williams Dictionary (2006), rūpa is defined as:\n\nIn general, \"rūpa\" is the Buddhist concept of material form, including both the body and external matter.\n\nMore specifically, in the Pali Canon, \"rūpa\" is contextualized in three significant frameworks:\n\nIn addition, more generally, \"rūpa\" is used to describe a statue, in which it is sometimes called Buddharupa.\n\nRūpa is not matter as in the metaphysical substance of materialism. Instead it means both materiality and sensibility—signifying, for example, a tactile object both insofar as that object is made of matter and that the object can be tactically sensed. In fact rūpa is more essentially defined by its amenability to being sensed than its being matter: just like everything else it is defined in terms of its function; what it does, not what it is. As matter, rūpa is traditionally analysed in two ways: as four primary elements (Pali, \"mahābhūta\"); and, as ten or twenty-four secondary or derived elements.\n\nExisting \"rūpa\" consists in the four primary or underived (\"no-upādā\") elements: \n\nIn the Abhidhamma Pitaka and later Pali literature, \"rūpa\" is further analyzed in terms of ten or twenty-three or twenty-four types of secondary or derived (\"upādā\") matter. In the list of ten types of secondary matter, the following are identified:\n\nIf twenty-four secondary types are enumerated, then the following fifteen are added to the first nine of the above ten: \n\nA list of 23 derived types can be found, for instance, in the Abhidhamma Pitaka's Dhammasangani (e.g., Dhs. 596), which omits the list of 24 derived types' \"heart-basis.\"\n\nThe practice of \"dhyana\" is aided by \"anapanasati\", mindfulness of breathing. The Suttapitaka (the Agamas) describe four stages of \"rupa jhāna\". \"Rupa\" refers to the material realm, in a neutral stance, as different from the \"kama\" realm (lust, desire) and the \"arupa\"-realm (non-material realm). Each jhāna is characterised by a set of qualities which are present in that jhana.\n\n\n\n"}

He served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1927 to 1953.\n\nMacCarthy was born in Bracebridge, Ontario, the son of John Maurice MacCarthy and Ann Cooper, and was educated in that city. He worked as a farmer. In 1907, he married Frances Mary Tucker. A Roman Catholic, MacCarthy was also a member of the Knights of Columbus.\n\nHe was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in the 1927 election, for the rural constituency of Ste. Rose in the western part of the province. MacCarthy ran as a candidate of the Progressive Party, and defeated long-serving Conservative incumbent Joseph Hamelin by 224 votes. He was re-elected by an increased majority in the 1932 election, and was again returned to the legislature in the campaigns of 1936, 1941, 1945 and 1949. Following the merger of the Liberal and Progressive parties in 1932, he served as a Liberal-Progressive.\n\nHIs only difficult bid for re-election came in 1941, when he defeated Social Credit candidate Paul Prince by 199 votes. He served as a government backbencher for his entire career in the legislature.\n\nMacCarthy died at age seventy-five, one day before the 1953 provincial election, while seeking a seventh term in the legislature. He suffered a stroke at a political meeting, and died in hospital the same night. There is some confusion as to whether he died on June 7 or June 8, though newspaper reports from the period indicate the former.\n\nOn June 9, the \"Winnipeg Free Press\" newspaper published the following tribute: \"The quiet-spoken member contributed little to the actual debates in the House, but no one would deny that he was most active on behalf of his constituency, and that in his own quiet, sincere and effective way he brought it benefits which a more vocal and less active member would have been unable to do.\"\n"}

The former bassist of Sex Pistols, Sid Vicious, was the lead singer. It was his final concert in England, as he died of a heroin overdose the following February.\n\nRecordings of the concert, which included covers of Frank Sinatra's \"My Way\" and The Stooges' \"I Wanna Be Your Dog\", have been released multiple times: in 1991 on DeLorean Records, in 1993 on Receiver Records, in 2002 on Castle Records, and in 2007 on Sanctuary Records. The 2007 release includes an interview with Matlock and Scabies.\n\nVicious was due to fly to New York City and needed money, so after bumping into ex-Pistol Glen Matlock one day, he decided to play a gig with him. Matlock, who Vicious had replaced in the Sex Pistols, saw it as an opportunity \"to show there was no animosity\" between them, he later commented. Matlock recruited his Rich Kids bandmate Steve New on guitar, and The Damned's Rat Scabies completed the line up on drums. Vicious' girlfriend Nancy Spungen sang backing vocals, but after hearing her at rehearsals, Matlock made sure her microphone was not plugged in on the night of the gig. The name of the band came from an amalgamation of Sid Vicious, The Rich Kids and Rat Scabies' part-time outfit The White Cats.\n\nThe Vicious White Kids are described as heavy punk rock, much like Matlock and Vicious’ former band, the Sex Pistols. \n\nThe band performed in the Camden Electric Ballroom, a two-storey concert venue in Camden Town, London, England.\n\nThe Vicious White Kids performed several cover songs by musicians and bands such as The Stooges, Ramones, Frank Sinatra, and The New York Dolls. They also performed the controversial Sex Pistols song \"Belsen Was a Gas\".\n\nOther songs performed by the band during their concert included “Chatterbox” by The New York Dolls, “Tight Pants” by Iggy and the Stooges, Frank Sinatra's “My Way”, Eddie Cochran's “C'mon Everybody” and “Somethin' Else”, and Dave Berry's “Don't Give Me No Lip”. The Vicious White Kids also performed “I Wanna Be Your Dog” by the Stooges and “(I'm Not Your) Steppin' Stone” by the Monkees.\n\nThe Camden Electric Ballroom concert would be the one and only complete concert that the Vicious White Kids would perform as a band. Following the concert, the band became almost completely inactive in the music world. They would permanently disband when Spungen was stabbed to death in a hotel room in October 1978, and Vicious was arrested for her murder. Vicious died of a heroin overdose in February 1979. \n\nAfter the Vicious White Kids broke up, Matlock, Scabies and New all moved on with their career. Matlock has performed with a number of other artists, among them being Iggy Pop and the London Cowboys. Scabies has played in various bands as a drummer over the years. New was minimally active in the music business after the band broke up, and died of cancer in 2010.\n\nThe band's one concert has been released and re-released many times. It was released in 1991 by DeLorean Records, by Castle Records in 2002, and Sanctuary Records in 2007. The band's one concert has been fully released onto YouTube, as well, with a 31-minute concert video of the band's performance.\n\n\nTheir only concert has been released many times.\n\n\n"}

She has been a professor of composition at the Curtis Institute of Music since 1994. She has received many awards, including the 2010 Pulitzer Prize for Music for her Violin Concerto and three Grammy Awards for Best Contemporary Classical Composition, in 2010, 2018, and 2020. She was elected a Member of the American Philosophical Society in 2019.\n\nHigdon was born in Brooklyn, New York. She spent the first 10 years of her life in Atlanta, Georgia before moving to Seymour, Tennessee. Her father, Charles Higdon, was a painter and made efforts to expose his children to different types of art. He took them to various exhibitions of new and experimental art that gave her her earliest exposure to art and helped her to form an idea of what art was. She also developed an interest in photography and writing at an early age. Despite her early introduction to art, she received very little exposure to classical music in her home. Instead, her early musical education came from listening to rock and folk music from the 1960s. It was not until high school that she joined concert band, where she began playing percussion. At about the same time, she picked up a flute her mother had bought, and she began teaching herself to play using an old flute method book. She played flute in her high school's concert band and percussion in marching band, but heard little classical music before her college years.\n\nShe studied flute performance at Bowling Green State University with Judith Bentley, who encouraged her to explore composition. Because of her lack of formal training at an early age, Higdon struggled to catch up early in her college career. She said of beginning college, \"I didn't know any Basic Theory, how to spell a chord, what intervals were, and I had zero keyboard skills. I basically started from the very, very beginning. Most of the people I started school with were far more advanced than I was, and I had an extraordinary amount of catching up to do.\" Despite these challenges, she established herself as a hard worker and a resilient student, even when she faced discouragement from some professors.\n\nDuring her time at Bowling Green, she wrote her first composition, a two-minute piece for flute and piano named \"Night Creatures\". Of playing in the university orchestra, she has said: \"Because I came to classical music very differently than most people, the newer stuff had more appeal for me than the older.\" While at Bowling Green, she met Robert Spano, who was teaching a conducting course there and who became one of the champions of Higdon's music in the American orchestral community.\n\nHigdon earned an Artist's Diploma from the Curtis Institute of Music, where she studied with David Loeb and Ned Rorem, and taught virtuoso Hilary Hahn. She continued to demonstrate her fortitude and dedication by persevering despite a few graduate rejection letters. She eventually obtained both a Master of Arts and a PhD in composition from the University of Pennsylvania under the tutelage of George Crumb. She teaches composition at the Curtis Institute where she holds the Milton L. Rock Chair in Compositional Studies. She has served as Composer-in-Residence with the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, the Green Bay Symphony Orchestra, the Philadelphia Orchestra, the Fort Worth Symphony and the Music Academy of the West.\n\nHigdon lives with her wife, Cheryl Lawson, in Philadelphia. They met in high school.\n\nHigdon has received commissions from major symphonies including the Philadelphia Orchestra, the Cleveland Orchestra, the Chicago Symphony, the Atlanta Symphony, the National Symphony, the Minnesota Orchestra, the Pittsburgh Symphony, the Indianapolis Symphony, and the Dallas Symphony. Conductors who worked extensively with her include Christoph Eschenbach, Marin Alsop, Leonard Slatkin, and Giancarlo Guerrero.\n\nShe wrote her first opera based on Charles Frazier's 1997 novel, \"Cold Mountain\" with a libretto by Gene Scheer. It was co-commissioned by The Santa Fe Opera and Opera Philadelphia and premiered in Santa Fe in 2015.\n\nHer works have been recorded on more than four dozen CDs. Her most popular work is \"blue cathedral\", a one-movement tone poem dealing with the death of her brother from cancer, which premiered in 2000. It has been performed by more than 400 orchestras since.\n\nJennifer Higdon's musical background has influenced her in many unique ways. Her musical style grew out of her humble beginnings, listening to groups like the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, Simon & Garfunkel, and many other bands, rather than to classical music. As a result, she has described her own compositional process as \"intuitive\" and \"instinctive\", where she favors music that makes sense, rather than writing music that adheres to classical forms and structures. Popular and folk music were not the only early influences on her composition; the mountains and wide open spaces of her Tennessee home have influenced her style, and even helped bond her to George Crumb, who encouraged her to use nature as a muse.\n\nMany of Jennifer Higdon's pieces are considered neoromantic. Harmonically, Higdon's music tends to use tonal structures, but eschews traditional harmonic progressions in favor of more open intervals. Avoiding specific key signatures allows for sudden, surprising harmonic shifts and modulations. Open perfect fifths and parallel fifths can be found in most of her compositions. She also often uses scalar passages to add melodic or harmonic context to the music. Her early background in percussion likely influenced her rhythmic style; her music often features complex, intricate rhythmic passages, even when melodies are lyrical. She also makes use of rhythmic ostinati which give motion to many of her works - especially her more rapid compositions. Some of her rhythmic and melodic repetition could be considered minimalist in nature.\n\nIn her vocal and choral works, Higdon works to emulate speech patterns and applies them to writing both the pitch and the rhythm of her melodies. She tries to reflect the mood of the text, which results in melodies that tend to have a more romantic sound. On the occasions where she has set non-English texts, she tends to use both the text and translation in the piece, allowing the piece to more effectively communicate its message.\n\nStructurally, her music reflects the \"intuitive\" style that she composes by: Her music is decidedly sectional, but tends to have a natural flow - often melodies can carry over bar lines, creating some motivic and sectional ambiguity. Many of her works begin with a sparse orchestration, and build in performing forces as a piece continues, creating variety and interest throughout a given piece of music. Higdon does not intentionally compose with a form in mind, but allows the music to unfold naturally\n\nThe League of American Orchestras reported Higdon as one of the most performed living American composers, in 2008. \"Higdon's music is lithe and expert\", wrote Robert Battey of the \"Washington Post\". \"Jennifer Higdon's vivid, attractive works have made her a hot commodity lately,\" wrote Steve Smith of the \"New York Times\". Of her Concerto for Orchestra, Richard Morrison in \"The Times\" (London) stated that \"it is rare to witness a big new orchestral piece being acclaimed as Jennifer Higdon's \"Concerto for Orchestra\" was cheered on ... The most impressive aspect is the panache with which a huge orchestra is deployed ... This colourful, ever-changing instrumental panoply is doubtless one reason why the work makes an instant impression ... Higdon's work is traditionally rooted yet imbued with integrity, freshness and a desire to entertain.\"\n\nAmong less favorable assessments, Andrew Clements in the \"Guardian\" gave a CD of Higdon's music a minimal one-star rating. He referred to the music as \"American contemporary music at its most vacuous, a noisy mishmash\". Tom Service, also in the \"Guardian\" also criticized Higdon's \"Concerto For Orchestra\". He wrote: \"The problem with Higdon's piece ... is that its flamboyant gestures ... function only as surface effects, without creating any real structural momentum.\" Similarly, though in a more positive review, Raymond Tuttle wrote that \"even though the \"Concerto for Orchestra\" is not remarkable for its melodic content, there is so much color and brilliance in Higdon's writing ... that few listeners will notice.\"\n\nHigdon received awards from the Guggenheim Foundation, the American Academy of Arts & Letters (two awards), the Pew Fellowship in the Arts, Meet-the-Composer, the National Endowment for the Arts, and ASCAP. In addition she has received grants from the Pennsylvania Council on the Arts. Higdon has been a featured composer at festivals including Grand Teton, Tanglewood, Vail, Norfolk, Winnipeg and Cabrillo.\n\nShe has won the Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Classical Composition three times. The first was in 2010 for her Percussion Concerto. The second was in 2018 for her Viola Concerto. That concerto was part of an album dedicated to her music on the Naxos label, \"Higdon: All Things Majestic, Viola Concerto, and Oboe Concerto\", which also won the 2018 Grammy for Best Classical Compendium. The third was in 2020 for her Harp Concerto.\n\nHigdon won the annual Pulitzer Prize for Music for her Violin Concerto (Lawdon Press), which premiered February 6, 2009, in Indianapolis. The Pulitzer citation called it \"a deeply engaging piece that combines flowing lyricism with dazzling virtuosity\". It was commissioned jointly by the Indianapolis Symphony, Toronto Symphony, Baltimore Symphony and the Curtis Institute of Music.\n\n\n\n"}

The church building is near to Leeds General Infirmary. Although based in the city centre, the congregation is drawn from all parts of the city, including a large student congregation.\n\nThe current staff team includes the rector Lizzy Woolf, associate rectors Eve Ridgeway and Adrian Smith, curate Julia Wilkins, and John Walker. Jon Swales leads the Lighthouse community.\n\nRegular services at St George's occur at 10:30 am and 6:30 pm on Sundays with other activities throughout the week.\n\nThe 10:30 am service is a large family congregation, with provision for children's ministry. The 6:30 pm service is a congregation aimed at students and young professionals, with a focus on biblical teaching and musical worship. St George's sets itself firmly within the Charismatic Evangelical wing of the Church of England.\n\nThere are also additional congregations, St George's Community Church and The Lighthouse. Community Church holds services at 10:30 am on Sunday mornings at Parkdale Hall for those residents in the parish. The Lighthouse holds services after Sunday lunch in St George's Crypt aimed at those on the margins of society (esp. addicts, ex-prisoners, homeless and others).\n\nSt George's Church is known for originally founding the St George's Crypt charity, which works with the homeless and asylum seekers. The Crypt provides overnight accommodation and runs two hostels as well as charity shops, events and programmes to help people deal with addiction.\nThe Crypt is now a charity in its own right, separate from St George’s Church; although they still work closely together.\nThe telephone number for St George’s Crypt is 0113 245 9061.\n\nThe church is a Grade II listed building, built 1836–38. Its spire was blown down in 1962 and replaced in January 2006.\n\n1836 A scheme was outlined for a new church to be built at the West end of the city. Money was raised for the building and a local architect, John Clark was instructed to draw up plans for a church of ‘plain, bold style, free from ornaments’. As such, the design of the church comprised a nave and aisle under a timber roof, a clock tower, and a spire of 160 feet. The church was named St George's at the laying of the foundation stone by the then Bishop of Ripon, Charles Longley. At this stage, St George's was officially a chapel in the Parish of Leeds and remained so until 1868.\n\n1836 Work started on the building. There was a slight delay as a decision was made to create burial vaults under the church as there was a general shortage of burial space in the city.\n\n1837 The first Curate, the Revd. William Sinclair, an evangelical, was appointed and St George's became the leading evangelical church in the city. Since its opening, the reputation of St George's and that of its clergy, has been synonymous with evangelism. William Sinclair was officially known as a ‘Perpetual Curate’ of St George's because of the status of St George's within the Parish of Leeds.\n\n1838 The church building was externally finished in April and was consecrated on 7 November of the same year. The total cost of the build was £11,000.\n\n1839 A hurricane caused considerable damage to St George's and a rebuilding fund was set up. William Sinclair started St George's Day School.\n\n1841 The painter Charles West Cope presented St George's with the Sanctuary picture that is still in place today. Cope had been born in Park Square and had been approached by his friend John Atkinson, one of the Trustees, to paint an altarpiece for the church.\n\n1842 William Sinclair built St Andrew's (a chapel on Burley Road) as a memorial to his wife. This closed in 1958.\n\n1847 He then built St Philip's near the site of the Yorkshire Post Building. This closed in 1931 when its Vicar died. The building was bought by the Roman Catholic Church and was demolished stone by stone and rebuilt in Middleton.\n\n1855 The vaults and burial ground at St Georges were closed.\n\n1857 John Blomfield was appointed to St George's. According to John Heaton, the son of one of the original Trustees, ‘He was ‘a small feeble-looking man’ whose only gifts seemed to be the ability to preach evangelical sermons.\n\n1868 St George's became a Parish.\n\n1873 Samuel Adams became Vicar. It was he who bridged the gap between St George's Church and the Parish Church, thereby bringing a closer tie between the high and low church tradition in the city.\n\n1880 Charles Lamb came to the church and was also appointed as Chaplain to the adjacent Leeds Infirmary. When Charles Lamb left the church in 1887, the Chaplaincy was taken over by Leeds Parish Church.\n\n1881 A chapel, Emmanuel, was built to serve the northern end of the parish. This later housed the Anglican Chaplaincy of the University of Leeds.\n\n1882 By this time, three ‘Day’ schools as well as Sunday Schools had been established in the local area.\n\n1886 Renovations were made to the church. A chancel was created to include the organ which was moved from its original location in the west gallery.\n\n1887 Benjamin Lamb succeeded to the post of Vicar.\n\n1895 John Wright was appointed to St George's and successfully raised money for some much needed alterations and improvements to the church.\n\n1900 The apse, chancel arch and vestry were added. A pulpit and choir stalls were also introduced. This cost a total of £9,000.00.\n\n1904 Walter Green was appointed. Sunday Schools and church organisations were thriving and church attendances were high.\n\n1915 Arthur Alston was appointed.\n\n1918 Bernard Herklots became vicar. He travelled widely and, in 1927, exchanged livings with a vicar in Dorset, Douglas Adams.\n\n1927 Douglas Adams, having taken over as vicar found himself faced with internal church squabbling, including differences over the church school. He organised the first Sunday school trip which went to Boston Spa. He also dedicated the memorial chapel at St Andrew's to those who had lost their lives in the First World War.\n\n1930 Don Robins was appointed and this was the beginning of a remarkable new chapter in the life of the church. Don Robins was a charismatic leader who had a remarkable effect on all those who met him. The most renowned and longest lasting aspect of his work was the opening of the Crypt beneath the church. At first, the Crypt was a refuge for men who had returned from the war and gravitated to Leeds in search of work but who ended up destitute. Since its inception, the Crypt has offered support, advice and shelter to those people (men and women) on the margins of society and is still in existence today. Its work and its buildings have changed over the years to meet current demands and changes in society. Today, it is still a much respected Christian Charity helping those with addiction and social exclusion problems.\n\n1931 Don initiated the opening of a Women's Centre which provided food, clothing and opportunities for day trips for the poor of the parish. He helped set up Fellowship House where servicemen posted to Leeds could meet. Monthly meetings for families of prisoners of war were held. War widows and their families were provided with food and clothing. Under Don's leadership, church members were rallied to provide support for Estonians, Lithuanians and Latvians who had been brought to this country to work in the mills, and many of whom had been prisoners of war. Jobs were found for them and they eventually founded their own church.\n\n1938 The Church School was thriving and an extension was built which also served as a church hall. The church flourished under Don Robins’ leadership. There were Scouts, Guides, Women's Groups, Men's Groups and Young People's Groups. Parish residents were actively involved in the church, receiving and providing simultaneously. Don was an influential person in the City and was widely respected by both clergy and lay people. When he died suddenly in 1948, clergy from great distances travelled to his funeral.\n\n1948 Tony Waite was appointed vicar. He was an inspirational leader who encouraged and developed the work of the Crypt. He worked long hours and was a worthy successor to Don Robins.\n\n1954 Faith Lodge, an annex of St George's Crypt was opened with the aim of providing ‘sustained care in the environment of a home’.\n\n1958 Raymond Turvey succeeded Tony Waite and became well known for his sermons and Bible Studies. As a result of reorganisation of parish boundaries, St Andrew's Church closed and St George's took over its school.\n\n1962 On 11 February, only a few hours after a congregation of 400 had left the building, hurricane-force winds dislodged some of the pinnacles surrounding the church tower. These crashed through the roof of the church causing enormous structural damage, amounting to £20,000. The insurance for the church did not cover storm damage and there was a distinct possibility that the church might be closed. Throughout the week, the debris and destruction were cleared and the congregation met in the church on the following Sunday for worship. Within two weeks of the damage, £2,000 had been pledged towards the rebuilding costs: the rest came from sources all over the country and the world, including one large gift from Bridge Street Church in the City of Leeds. There building plans were drawn up by Peter Hill, the diocesan architect. He included a Narthex, male and female toilets and two meeting rooms. The cost eventually came to £26,000 and this was met.\n\n1972 Michael Botting became vicar with a brief to encourage more families to come to St George's. In this he succeeded and when he left in 1984, there were 25 babies in the crèche and over 100 young people in Sunday School each week and St George's was recognised as a family-friendly church. Michael Botting initiated and pioneered Family Worship services. The number of students attending the evening services rose as well. During his ministry, the church school closed and its main building was demolished, but the church purchased the extension which became known affectionately as TAC (The Activities Centre). Sunday School and other church activities were held in TAC.\n\n1976 Regent Terrace, another hostel of St George's Crypt, was opened.\n\n1984–1986 A two-year vacancy between vicars.\n\n1986 David Hawkins (later Bishop of Barking) was appointed vicar. His creativity, love of art, music, nature and the ‘element of surprise’ was evident in all aspects of his ministry, particularly in communicating the Gospel.\n\n1989 Due to serious problems with the church building, Hawkins' creative gifts were greatly used in re-ordering the church to provide a ‘flexible style, ideal for worship, conferences, concerts and theatre productions’. The re-ordering meant a two-year ‘exile’ from the building and the congregation worshipped in St Michael's School and Trinity St David's URC Church. At this time, David also instigated the development of the TAC site facility, finally completed in 2006.\n\n1990 A church plant in the parish, known as St George's Community Church, was established.\n\n1999 With the pressure to implement new health and safety regulations, and the need to update the facilities, a complete refurbishment of St George's crypt was undertaken.\n\n1999 St George's became a team ministry. David Hawkins became rector and the Community Church was granted district church status with its own team vicar, Peter Ellem.\n\n2002 David Hawkins left to become the Bishop of Barking. There followed a year's vacancy.\n\n2003 Jonathan Clark was appointed as rector.\n\n2006 The steeple, removed in 1962, replaced.\n\n2010 St George's Crypt reopens following a £15m refurbishment.\n\n"}

{"id": "1984769", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1984769", "title": "Verreaux's eagle", "text": "Verreaux's eagle\n\nVerreaux's eagle (\"Aquila verreauxii\") is a large, mostly African, bird of prey. It is also called the black eagle, especially in Southern Africa, leading to potential confusion with the Indian black eagle (\"Ictinaetus malayensis\"), which lives far to the east in Asia. Verreaux's eagle lives in hilly and mountainous regions of southern and eastern Africa (extending marginally into Chad), and very locally in West Africa, the Arabian Peninsula and the southern Middle East. It is one of the most specialized species of accipitrid in the world, with its distribution and life history revolving around its favorite prey species, the rock hyraxes. When hyrax populations decline, the species have been shown to survive with mixed success on other prey, such as small antelopes, gamebirds, hares, monkeys and other assorted vertebrates. Despite a high degree of specialization, Verreaux's eagle has, from a conservation standpoint, been faring relatively well in historic times. One population of this species, in the Matobo Hills of Zimbabwe, is arguably the best studied eagle population in the world, having been subject to continuous detailed study since the late 1950s. Like all eagles, this species belongs to the taxonomic order Accipitriformes (formerly included in Falconiformes) and the family Accipitridae, which may be referred to colloquially as accipitrids or raptors.\n\nThis species was first described by René Primevère Lesson in his 1830 publication, \"Centurie zoologique, ou choix d'animaux rares, nouveaux ou imparfaitement connus\", as \"Aquila Verreauxii\". The species’ name commemorates the French naturalist Jules Verreaux, who visited southern Africa in the early 19th century and collected the type specimen for the French Academy of Sciences.\n\nVerreaux's eagle is part of a broad group of raptors called \"booted eagles\" which are defined by the feature that all included species have feathering over their tarsus, whereas most other accipitrids have bare legs. Included in this group are all species described as \"hawk eagles\" including the genera \"Spizaetus\" and \"Nisaetus\", as well as assorted monotypical genera such as \"Oroaetus\", \"Lophaetus\", \"Stephanoaetus\", \"Polemaetus\", \"Lophotriorchis\" and \"Ictinaetus\". The genus \"Aquila\" is distributed across every continent but for South America and Antarctica. Up to 20 species have been classified in the genus but the taxonomic placement of some of the traditionally included species has recently been questioned. Traditionally, the \"Aquila\" eagles have been grouped superficially as largish, mainly brownish or dark-colored booted eagles that vary little in transition from their juvenile to their adult plumages.\n\nGenetic research has recently shown the Verreaux's eagle is included in a clade with its nearest relatives, the sister species Bonelli's eagle (\"A. fasciatus\") and African hawk-eagle (\"A. spilogaster\"), as well as the more distant sister species pair, the wedge-tailed eagle (\"A. audax\") and Gurney's eagle (\"A. gurneyi\"). Closely related to this clade are the golden eagle and Cassin's hawk-eagle. Some of the relationships within this group have long been suspected based on morphological similarities among the large-bodied species. The identification of the smaller, much paler-bellied \"A. fasciatus\" and \"A. spilogaster\" as members of the clade was a surprise, given that they were previously included in the genus \"Hieraaetus\". Cassin's hawk-eagle has been assigned to both the \"Hieraaetus\" group and the \"Spizaetus/Nisaetus\" \"hawk-eagle\" group but is now known based on this genetic data to also nest within \"Aquila\".\n\nOther largish \"Aquila\" species, the eastern imperial eagle (\"A. heliaca\"), the Spanish imperial eagle (\"A. adaberti\"), the tawny eagle (\"A. rapax\") and the steppe eagles (\"A. nipalensis\"), are now thought to be separate, close-knit clade, which attained some characteristics similar to those of the prior clade via convergent evolution. Genetically, the \"spotted eagles\" (\"C. pomarina, C. hasata & C. clanga\"), have been discovered to be more closely related to the long-crested eagle (\"Lophaetus occipitalis\") and the black eagle, and have been transferred to the genus \"Clanga\". The genus \"Hieraaetus\", traditionally including the booted eagle (\"H. pennatus\"), little eagle (\"H. morphnoides\") and Ayres's hawk-eagle (\"H. ayresii\"), consists of much smaller species, that are in fact the smallest birds called eagles outside of the unrelated \"Spilornis\" serpent-eagle genus. This genus has recently been eliminated by many authorities and is now occasionally also included in \"Aquila\", although not all ornithological unions have followed this suit in this re-classification. The small-bodied Wahlberg's eagle (\"H. wahlbergi\") has been traditionally considered an \"Aquila\" species due to its lack of change from juvenile to adult plumage and brownish color but it is actually genetically aligned to the \"Hieraaetus\" lineage.\n\nVerreaux's eagle is a very large eagle. It measures long from the bill to the tip of the tail, making it the sixth longest eagle in the world. Males can weigh and the larger females weigh . The average weight is approximately , based on the weights of 21 eagles of both sexes. Other reported mean body mass measurements of Verreaux's eagles were lower however, with seven unsexed birds averaging , while four unsexed eagles in an additional study averaged . In another group of weighed eagles, four females were found to average , which is more than a kilogram more than the average male, It is the seventh or eighth heaviest living eagle in the world. In average mass and overall weight range, if not linear measurements, the Verreaux's is very similar in size to its occasional competitor, the martial eagle, which is regularly titled the largest of the African eagles. It also rivals the martial and golden eagles as the largest extant member of the \"booted eagle\" clan. It has a wingspan of . The wing chord of the male is and that of the female is . Among other standard measurements in the Verreaux's eagles, both sexes measure in tail length and in tarsus length. Other than the female's slight size advantage, adult males and females are physically indistinguishable from each other. Adult Verreaux's eagles are mostly jet-black in color. The yellow coloration of the cere (the bill is gun-metal grey), eye-ring and “eye-brows”, all stand out in contrast to the black plumage. Even more prominent on flying birds when seen from above is the white on the back, rump and upper-tail coverts and part of the scapulars, which forms a V-shaped patch, although this feature is partially obscured in perched birds. Adults also have conspicuous white windows on the wing quills at the carpal joint (at the base of the primaries) when seen flying both from above and below. The bill is stout, the head is prominent on the relatively long neck and the legs are fully feathered.\n\nJuvenile and immature plumages differ markedly from the plumage of adults. They are overall a dark brown color. Immatures have a strongly contrasting golden crown and a rufous or ginger nape and mantle. They have small white streaks on the forehead and black on their cheeks. The throat is dark streaked, the lower throat is pale brown and the upper-chest is brown. The rest of the underside is brown but for a blackish-blotched rufous to cream-colored abdomen and lightly marked creamy thighs and legs. The feathers of the upper-tail and upper-wing coverts are brown with white streaks in young birds, while the other tail and wing quills are nearly black. The wing quills when seen from below in flight show considerable whitish mottling, with more extensive white than is typically seen in adult plumages. The immature has a dark brown iris and yellowish feet. Black feathers increase from 2 to 5 years of age amongst a scattering of brown-tipped feathers, though the contrasting creamy trousers are maintained through the 3rd year. By the 4th year, they look dark grey-brown with a buff-patch on the nape and mottling of retained brownish feathers. At the end of the subadult phase at around 5 years of age, the plumage is practically indistinguishable from the adult. Full adult plumage is probably attained in 5 to 6 years.\n\nThe Verreaux's eagle is essentially unmistakable, especially in adulthood. No other black-colored raptor in its range approaches this species’ large size, nor possesses its distinctive patterns of white. The golden eagle is of similar size or marginally larger size and the two species are the heaviest living \"Aquila\" species and measure only marginally less than the slightly lighter-weight Australasian wedge-tailed eagle in total wing and bill-to-tail length. While the juvenile Verreaux's eagle is quite different from the adult's, its plumage is no less distinctive. No other accipitrid shares the mottled brownish body, blackish wings with large white patches or contrasting whitish, rufous and golden color around the head and neck as that of an immature eagle. The flight profile of Verreaux's eagle is also distinctive, as it is the only \"Aquila\" species other than the golden eagle to soar in a pronounced dihedral, with the wings held slightly above the back and primaries upturned at the tip to make a V shape. In the Bale Mountains of Ethiopia and possibly in some parts of the Arabian Peninsula and the southwestern edge of the Middle East, the ranges of the golden and Verreaux's eagles overlap, but the golden is a mostly brown bird and shares none of the Verreaux's black plumage. The immature golden eagle has white patches on its underwing as do Verreaux's but they are less extensive than those of the latter species. The wing shape also differs from the golden, as the Verreaux's eagle has very broad outer secondaries and a relatively narrow pinch at the base of the primaries, whereas the tapering of a golden eagle's wing is more gradual. The Verreaux's eagle wings have variously been described as paddle, spoon or leaf shaped. Imperial eagles are another improbable but possible source of confusion, since they too have white markings on their wing coverts, but are totally different in flight profile (much flatter winged) and overall coloration (dark brown).\n\nThis species is largely silent, though is arguably a stronger vocalist than its close cousin, the golden eagle. Chicking and chirruping sounds like that of a young turkey or francolin, ', have been heard in various contexts, such as pairs being reunited. More striking sounds are loud, ringing ', ' or ' calls used as contact calls or during intruder chases. Various screams, barks, yelps and mews have been heard to be issued at potential mammalian predators. The young emits feeble chirps at first, later more likely to cluck like the adults.\n\nVerreaux's eagle has specific habitat requirements and is rare outside of its particular habitat type. It lives in kopjes, which are dry, rocky environments in anything from rocky hills to high mountains amongst cliffs, gorges and inselbergs often surrounded by savanna, thornbush and sub-desert. It is often found in dry areas with less than of average annual rainfall. It is highest ranging in elevation in Ethiopia and East Africa, where found up to above sea level. Verreaux's eagle is found from the Marra Mountains of Sudan southward through that country to 16°N in Eritrea, along the northern mountains of Somalia, in much of Ethiopia (mostly the central, mountainous spine), possibly some mountains in northeastern Uganda, Kenya, easternmost Democratic Republic of the Congo and possibly Tanzania. Southeastern Africa is the heart of the Verreaux's eagle range: they are found in most mountain ranges in Malawi but for the Nyika Plateau, the Mafinga Hills and the Lulwe Hills, in Zambia (especially the escarpments bordering Lake Kariba to the gorges below Victoria Falls), in Zimbabwe (especially east of the central plateau),Mozambique, Swaziland, Lesotho and down into South Africa, where they largely inhabit the Karoo, along the cliffs of the Great Escarpment, the Cape Fold Mountains and Cape Peninsula. A somewhat more sparse distribution is known in Botswana, western Namibia and southwestern Angola (in the Serra da Chela). Elsewhere in Africa, the Verreaux's eagle may be found but tends to be rare and only spottily seen, such as in eastern Mali, northeastern Chad, the Aïr Mountains of Niger and southwestern Cameroon (where known only as a vagrant). In 1968, only a single record of Verreaux's eagle (from Jordan) was known from outside of Africa, but now it is known they are a rare breeder out of their main continent. From a handful of immature records and territorial adult behavior, breeding as been inferred in Lebanon, Israel, Oman, Saudi Arabia and Yemen.\n\nFew other accipitrids are as singularly specialized to hunt a single prey family as Verreaux's eagles, perhaps excluding the snail kite (\"Rostrhamus sociabilis\") and the slender-billed kite (\"Helicolestes hamatus\") with their specialization to hunt \"Pomacea\" snails. Not even accipitrids named after their staple food are known to be as specialized, i.e. the bat hawk (\"Macheiramphus alcinus\"), palm-nut vulture (\"Gypohierax angolensis\"), lizard buzzard (\"Kaupifalco monogrammicus\") and perhaps the rufous crab hawk (\"Buteogallus aequinoctialis\"). Certainly, the Verreaux's eagle has the most conservative diet of \"Aquila\" species, though the diet is more diverse in South Africa than in Zimbabwe. Two species comprise considerably more than half of (often more than 90% of) the Verreaux's eagle's diet: the Cape hyrax (\"Procavia capensis\") and the yellow-spotted rock hyrax (\"Heterohyrax brucei\"). In the Matobo Hills of Zimbabwe, these two hyraxes comprised 1,448 out of 1,550 eagle prey items recorded at eyries just after the breeding season from 1995 to 2003. In the same area, from 1957 to 1990, 98.1% of the diet was made up of rock hyrax. In a sample size of 224 from 102 nests in Serengeti National Park in Tanzania, 99.1% of the remains were of hyrax. Elsewhere in Tanzania, the diet is more mixed, with 53.7% of the remains from 24 nests made up of hyrax. In a nest in South Africa, 89.1% of the remains from a sampling of 55 were of hyrax. No detailed statistics are known but the hyrax are likely to the main prey in every population and have been mentioned to dominate the diet in Mozambique, Malawi and Botswana Around 400 hyrax may be taken through the year by a pair with young. The entire distribution of the species neatly corresponds with that of the two species of rock hyrax. To date, there are no known instances of Verreaux's eagle hunting the two species of tree hyraxes.\n\nIn the first 10 years of constant observation of the population from the Matobo Hills, only two kills were witnessed. However, enough hunting behavior has been ultimately observed to give a good idea how a Verreaux's eagle obtains its prey. This species most often forages in low-level quartering flight, with the rock hyraxes chiefly caught after a rapid, somewhat twisting dive in the few seconds after the eagle “surprises” the hyrax. Like the golden eagle, Verreaux's eagle uses natural contours of the ground in rocky and mountainous habitats to increase the element of surprise, as hyraxes (appropriately considering their diverse range of predators) tend to be highly wary. Verreaux's eagle have been known to hunt from a perch, which, although not abnormal, is certainly rare. Hunting hyrax cooperatively has been recorded, with one eagle of a pair flying past and distracting the prey while the other strikes from behind. Verreaux's eagle may knock hyraxes off cliffs and take arboreal prey from treetops but usually kills on the ground. The daily estimate food requirements of this species are around , nearly a third more than that of a golden eagle despite the latter's marginally heavier body weight. Rock hyraxes are often difficult to observe other than a quick flash for humans, but a Verreaux's eagle can fly out and then return to the nest with a kill in the matter of a few minutes.\n\nOf the two species regularly taken, the yellow-spotted rock hyrax can weigh from with an average of , although specimens from Zimbabwe are noticeably heavier and larger than specimens from Serengeti National Park. Cape hyrax, weighing from with average of around , can be even larger than the Verreaux's eagles themselves, so can be more difficult to kill. Yellow-spotted rock hyraxes are more often taken in the Matobo Hills, perhaps because of their smaller size or its more diurnal habits. Adult rock hyraxes were disproportionately selected, perhaps due to being out in the open more regularly. In Cape hyraxes, 1 to 2-year-old males are particularly vulnerable, since they are forced to disperse at sexual maturity. Juvenile hyraxes constituted from 11-33% of prey remains in the Western Cape while 18% of hyraxes killed were juveniles in Matobo Hills. Because of their greater weight, Cape hyraxes are frequently either consumed at the kill site (putting the eagle at risk of losing prey to competing predators or to attack by large mammalian carnivores) or are decapitated and brought to the nest or perch. Fewer skulls or jaws of Cape hyraxes have been found at nest sites than yellow-spotted rock hyrax skulls. However, the Cape hyrax has a wider distribution than the yellow-spotted and the Verreaux's eagle may hunt the Cape hyrax almost exclusively outside of the long band of eastern Africa where the smaller species is distributed. In comparison to the golden eagle, Verreaux's eagle has a foot pad that's about 20% wider, which is possibly an adaptation to taking the bulky and broad-backed rock hyrax. The foot of the Verreaux's eagle is reportedly even larger than a human hand. In South Africa, where the Cape hyrax is the main prey species, the estimated mean size of prey taken to the nest is around , perhaps twice as heavy as prey taken by some nesting golden eagles. However, the mean size of prey taken by Verreaux's eagle in the Matobo Hills, with more yellow-spotted rock hyrax, was around , around the same estimated weight as prey taken by golden eagles in Europe and smaller than the average estimated mass of prey taken to golden eagle nests in some regions, like Scotland or Mongolia.\n\nVerreaux's eagle are easily capable of taking diverse prey but this is infrequent in areas with healthy rock hyrax populations. Cases where more diverse food is brought to the nest are usually either considered to be areas where rock hyrax populations have declined or areas where eagles occupy home ranges which included non-rocky habitat such as savanna, which are described by Valerie Gargett as “poor food areas” due to their lack of hyrax. In such areas, about 80% of prey is mammalian. Verreaux's eagles that are less specialized have diets and hunting capacities that are similar to those of the golden eagle, although the latter species often subsists on hares, rabbits, ground squirrels or grouse for about half or two-thirds of its diet, a portion still comprised by rock hyrax in the Verreaux's. One study accumulated records of Verreaux's eagle preying on at least 100 prey species. Other prey types recorded have included small (mainly juvenile) antelopes, hares, rabbits, meerkats (\"Suricata suricatta\"), other mongooses, monkeys, squirrels, cane rats, bushbabies and lambs (\"Ovis aries\") and kids (\"Capra aegagrus hircus\"). Francolin (\"Francolinus\" ssp.) and guineafowl (\"Numina\" ssp.) as well as waterfowl, herons, egrets, bustards, pigeons, crows (\"Corvus\" ssp.), doves, chickens (\"Gallus gallus domesticus\") and a great sparrowhawk (\"Accipiter melanoleucus\") have been among the recorded avian prey. Avian prey ranging in size from alpine swift (\"Tachymarptis melba\") to adult male Denham's bustards (\"Neotis denhami\"). In Tanzania, out of a sample size of 41 from 26 nests, 53.7% of remains were of hyraxes, 29.3% of francolins, guineafowl and chickens, 12.2% of antelopes, 2.4% of hares and rabbits and 2.4% of mongoose. Tortoises made up 145 of 5748 from 73 sites (2.5%) in South Africa. Rarely, snakes and lizards may also be taken and even termites have been eaten by this species.\n\nIn South Africa, the commonest foods were (in descending order of preference): Cape hyrax, Smith's red rock hare (\"Pronolagus rupertris\"), meerkat, mountain reedbuck (\"Redunca fulvorufula\"), goats and sheep, scrub hare (\"Lepus saxatilis\"), Cape francolin (\"Francolinus capensis\"), helmeted guineafowl(\"Numida meleagris\"), yellow mongoose (\"Cynictis penicillata\") and Angulate tortoise (\"Chersina angulata\"). In “poor food areas” of the Matobo Hills, three nests included 53.6% hyrax, 10.7% cane-rats, 7.1% monkeys, 7.1% mongoose and 3.6% antelope. From 1997 to 2005 in the same area, non-hyrax prey (each representing less than 10 out of 1550 prey items at nests) included white-tailed mongoose (\"Ichneumia albicauda\"), steenbok (\"Raphicerus campestris\"), domestic goat, vervet monkey (\"Chlorocebus pygerythrus\"), Jameson's red rock hare (\"Pronolagus randensis\"), helmeted guineafowl, Swainson's francolin (\"Pternistis swainsonii\"), Natal francolin (\"Pternistis natalensis\"), southern red-billed hornbill (\"Tockus rufirostris\"), rock pigeon (\"Columba livia\"), white-necked raven (\"Corvus albicollis\"), leopard tortoise (\"Stigmochelys pardalis\") and giant plated lizard (\"Gerrhosaurus validus\"). In the Walter Sisulu National Botanical Garden of South Africa, the primary prey found around nests after a perceptible hyrax decline has become helmeted guineafowl and francolins, followed by cane rats, rabbits and dikdiks (\"Rhynchotragus\" ssp.). Young baboons may also be hunted, even the large-bodied chacma baboons (\"Papio ursinus\") which have issued a predator alarm call in response to the presence of Verreaux's eagles. Carrion either fairly frequent or none at all. A study of the taking of domestic lambs in the Karoo found only two cases of lambs being eaten by Verreaux's eagle and these were already dead when carried off. This contrasts with the golden eagle, which in some areas may eat many dead lambs and occasionally hunt lives ones. Although any prey weighing over is rarely taken, some ungulates hunted by Verreaux's eagles can be considerably larger. Klipspringer (\"Oreotragus oreotragus\") brought to the nest have weighed up to an estimated . A Verreaux's eagle was observed to hunt and kill a mountain reedbuck lamb estimated to weigh . The smallest known mammalian prey was a Cape gerbil (\"Gerbilliscus afra\").\n\nAlthough it is the most specialized predator of rock hyrax in the world, it does not have monopoly on this prey. Many wild predators are also attracted to rock hyraxes, which thus puts them in potential competition with the Verreaux's eagles. Amongst the other very large eagles which are widely found in sub-Saharan Africa, both the crowned eagle and the martial eagle may also locally favor rock hyraxes in their diets. However, these species have highly different habitat preferences and hunting techniques. The crowned eagle, a forest-dwelling species, is primarily a perch-hunter and can spend hours watching for prey activity from a prominent tree perch. The martial eagle is a dweller mainly of lightly wooded savanna and often hunts on the wing. soaring high and watching for prey activity with its superb vision, quite unlike the contour-hunting technique used by Verreaux's eagles. While the habitats of crowned and Verreaux's eagle keep them segregated enough to likely eliminate competition, confrontations between Verreaux's and martial eagles have been recorded. Although somewhat larger and more powerful, the martial eagle is relatively less nimble in the air and there is a case where a martial eagle was robbed of rock hyrax prey by a Verreaux's eagle. Another case of kleptoparasitism by a Verreaux's eagle involved one stealing some carrion from a lammergeier (\"Gypaetus barbatus\"). Verreaux's eagles occasionally prey on other large raptors including vultures, including white-headed vulture (\"Trigonoceps occipitalis\"), white-backed vulture (\"Gyps africanus\") and Cape vulture (\"Gyps coprotheres\"), though the earlier cases probably refer to nestling or juvenile predation and the latter to nest defense on the part of the eagles. An apparent predation attempt on a full grown juvenile Rüppell's griffon (\"Gyps rueppellii\") was abortive. A unique opportunity to study Verreaux's eagle living with its closest extant cousin, the golden eagle, has been afforded in the Bale Mountains of Ethiopia. The two species, with similar habitat preferences, were observed to defend their territories from one another exclusively, with many cases of goldens chasing Verreaux's eagles out of their respective territories in flight and only one of Verreaux's chasing the goldens. However, since the golden eagles prefer hares and Verreaux prefers rock hyraxes, they actually seem to have no deleterious effect on each other's breeding activities. African hawk-eagles (\"Aquila spilogaster\") may also take a few hyraxes, but are likely to avoid direct conflicts with their much larger cousins, so will tawny eagles (\"Aquila rapax\"). Other predators of rock hyrax may include felids like African wildcats (\"Felis silvestris lybica\"), servals (\"Leptailurus serval\"), caracals (\"Caracal caracal\") and leopards (\"Panthera pardus\") as well as jackals (\"Canis\" ssp.), African rock pythons (\"Python sebae\") and owls (mainly the large Verreaux's eagle-owl (\"Bubo lacteus\") or possibly the Cape eagle-owl (\"B. capensis\")). Neonate rock hyraxes may fall prey to mongooses and venomous snakes like Egyptian cobras (\"Naja haje\") and puff adders (\"Bitis arietans\"). Due to the formidable range of competitors it pays for Verreaux's eagle to be cautious from the moment it bears down on its prey. Cases where pirating has been attempted has involved diverse carnivores like caracals and jackals. In at least one case, a Verreaux's eagle was observed to be displaced off a rodent-kill (likely a cane-rat) by an Ethiopian wolf (\"Canis simensis\"). As is often the case with reintroduced eagles (i.e. seen even in the huge harpy eagle (\"Harpia harpyja\")), reintroduced Verreaux's eagle may lose their fear of other predators to their own detriment and one such bird fell victim to a caracal. Cases where Verreaux's eagles have swooped at leopards are not likely competitive but are more likely to try to displace from their territory and such attacks have occasionally had fatal results for the birds. This species is not normally aggressive to humans but may swoop uncomfortably close when the nest is being investigated.\n\nA rough estimated average of home range size in Verreaux's eagle is . Density of breeding pairs varies from 1 pair per in the Matobo Hills, Zimbabwe, 1 pair per in the Karoo, 1 pair per in East Africa, 1 pair per in the Bale Mountains of Ethiopia to a known maximum spacing of 1 pair per in the Magaliesberg and Drakensberg ranges. The Matobo Hills reportedly has one of the greatest breeding densities known of any large eagle and territories are extremely stable through seasons and years. Such stable distributions are expected of long-lived raptors living in the tropics with a relatively stable food supply outside the seasonal variation of temperate zones. While Matobo Hill home ranges ranged from , most were observed to include about the same amount of kopje habitat (up to ). Populations fluctuate surprisingly little despite four-fold changes between peaks and troughs in hyrax numbers. At troughs, eagles may temporarily disappear or switch to alternate prey. This is only especially marked in drought periods and on average occurs once every 20 years. Some authors consider the Verreaux's eagle to be a partial migrant, others describe it as sedentary. This is more a matter of terminology than unclear behaviour, since this species is well known to behave like almost all raptors that breed in Sub-Saharan Africa. That is the young wander relatively widely once dispersed from their parent's territory but the adults generally remain sedentary on their home range for the remainder of their lives.\n\nVerreaux's eagle displays may potentially occur almost throughout the year. Frequently displays are in response to the presence of another soaring pair or after repelling a single intruder from the territory. They will also display if anxious about the nest when humans or other large mammals approach too closely. The male's display often consists of him first flying up in an undulating flight with wings readily held spread or closed. Then, once at a great height, he plunges down as far as at a time, then quickly rises back up, sometimes swinging to and fro like the arms of a pendulum, at other times diving and rising along a straight line. These evolutions may be embellished with somersaults and sideways rolls at the peak before the descent. Some displays involve pairs of eagles. A pair frequently circles or makes figures of eight over their territory. One bird may roll over and present claws in flight or the male may fly behind female with exaggeratedly upcurved wings. It is now the prevalent thought that most displays in \"Aquila\" eagles are territorial, as they often occur along the boundary of a given home range rather than near the nest. Displays with talon-grappling and tumbling are often aerial fights between territorial birds and occasionally the eagles may clasp and whirl downwards (one such fight reportedly resulting in the birds plunging into the sea).\n\nIn Zimbabwe, 60 pairs may nest in , equivalent to 1 pair per , but this is exceptional. In East Africa, one pair nests each and in South Africa sometimes as little as 1 pair per , but nearer being more typical. Verreaux's eagle may build from 1 to 3 nests, sometimes none over the course of a year. In the Matobo Hills, the average number of nests built per pair is 1.4. Eagles nesting in the Karoo have much larger territories, though are subject to persecution and habitat change, more so than many other populations. In the Matobos, the species is near the breeding population capacity level with almost unlimited nests that are rather unevenly distributed among available jumbles of rocky kopjes. In Kenya, nests are more scattered and Verreaux's eagle sometimes do not breed even where the habitat seems appropriate and there are good numbers of rock hyrax. By virtue of location on a narrow ledge, nests tend to be much broader than deep and a relatively small for the size of the eagle. The flattish nests, made out of green branches and lined with green leaves, are up to across and deep. Though a nest depth of around is typical, one old nest was deep. Typically nests are on cliffs, often in an overhung crevice or in a small cave, sometimes on an open ledge. The nest site is generally marked by a 'whitewash' which is formed by the birds' droppings. Verreaux's is the most cliff dependent of all eagle species, in the late 1970s only 3 known nests were in trees. Very rarely, they may nest in trees, such as \"Euphorbia\" or \"Acacia\", often those growing out of a cliff crevice. A handful of nests in South Africa have even been on electric pylons. A new nest takes up to four months to construct, with some repair being typical upon each use. Both sexes participate in the nest construction, though the female usually takes the lead. It may take several hundred feet of rope for a human to reach the nest. Predation of young in the nest is either suspected or anecdotely reported as having been committed by African rock pythons, baboons and caracals. However, predation is believed to be normally quite rare, due to the combination of factors such as the inaccessibility of most nests by foot (thus cutting off all but the most nimble mammalian carnivores) and the bold defenses of the parent eagles. Verreaux's eagle have reportedly dropped sticks on potential nest predators. This has been considered a form of tool-use, which is generally unknown in other raptorial birds and has been mostly reported in corvids and herons.\n\nEgg laying may occur from November to August in Sudan and Arabia, October to May in Ethiopia and Somalia, year around in East Africa (with a peak of June to December) and anywhere from April to November in Africa from Zambia southwards. In an unusual behaviour for eagles, the males may bring food to females before egg laying and, more typically, males bring almost all food during the incubation stage. Two eggs are generally laid, though a range of one to three is known. The eggs are rather elongated ovals and being chalky white sometimes with a bluish tinge or a few reddish-brown marking, measuring from in length and in width, with an average of . The eggs are laid at three-day intervals starting in the middle of the day. Both sexes incubate, but the female takes the major share and tends to sit all night over them. Sometimes, the male may sit for 40-50% of the day with more shifts for him towards the end of incubation. These are close-sitters, which are not easily disturbed off the nest. Incubation is 43 to 47 days. Hatching happens at about to 2–3 days apart, with about 24 hours from the first chipping of the egg's surface to complete hatching. One egg is sometimes infertile and the second egg tends to be about 10% smaller. The Verreaux's eagle is considered an “obligate cainist”, that is the older sibling normally kills the younger one (in more than 90% of observed nests), by either starvation or direct attack. Aggression may continue for up to 70 days after hatching. At one time no cases of two young successfully reaching the fledging stage were known, however a couple of cases of two healthy fledglings from a nest have been recorded. Siblicide is regularly observed in raptorial birds, including unrelated families like owls and skuas and is common, even typical, in \"Aquila\" eagles. The behaviour is most commonly explained as a kind of insurance policy, with the second nestling existing both to act as a backup if the first egg or nestling perishes and to mitigate the stressful workload demanded of the parent raptors in feeding, brooding and defending the young. The odds of survival for the second fledging are better in the golden eagle and other temperate-breeding \"Aquila\" eagles, possibly due to a shorter nesting stage in these species. In roughly 20% of golden eagle nests and in some cases, such as prey-rich areas of North America, about half of the nests will successfully produce two fledglings. In the Verreaux's eagle, no food is given to the hatchling in the first 36 hours, thereafter they are regularly fed. Early in the fledging stage, the young is brooded up to 90% of the time. After 20 days, parents spend up to 20% of time with their eaglet around the nest, not brooding in daylight after 21 days. Feathers appear through the down at about 34 days, by 60 days feathers cover the down. In Equatorial Africa, the eaglet fledges from the nest at 95–99 days, though sometimes as little as 90 days further south. In the golden eagle, the fledging stage is roughly 35 days shorter. The young Verreaux's eagle takes its first flight and then returns to the nest for the first fortnight. In the early fledging period, the male brings more food, later it is largely the female. At some point during the post-fledging stage, she ceases to roost with the young one and sits with the male at some distance, a behaviour that seems to vary from nest to nest in timing. After 45–50 days, food is caught by the parents but is likely eaten by themselves and not brought to the young. After leaving the nest, family parties may be together for up to 6 months. The eaglet grows stronger after the first month and accompanies the parents on hunting forays away from the nest. \nIt often breeds every year, occasionally only on every other year.\n\nVerreaux's eagles’ nests are estimated to have a 40-50% success rate. Success of nesting is significantly higher when hyrax are common: 0.56 young per year dropped to 0.28 young per year. In fact, in poor food areas no breeding attempt commonly occurred (66% did not attempt to breed) whereas 24% did not attempt to breed in better food areas. Frequency of breeding attempts is lower in wetter years. Near 90% attempted nesting in years with of rainfall whereas 45% attempted during years with roughly rainfall. In the Matobo Hills, persistent intrusion by an unmated adult into a pair's nesting territory seemed to have an adverse effect on nesting success. The estimated average lifespan is 16 years. Verreaux's eagle has a total population estimated very roughly to be somewhere in the tens of thousands in total. In northeastern South Africa, the local breeding population is estimated to include 240 pairs, while the western Cape region of the country may hold possibly more than 2,000 pairs. Verreaux's eagle lives in kopje habitat, which is generally non-vulnerable to human destruction, unlike, say, the savanna inhabited by martial eagles or the forests inhabited by crowned eagles. Unlike the other two big African eagles, they do not often partake of much carrion, so are at little risk of poisoning from carcass left out to control jackals. Nonetheless, some people shoot at or otherwise persecute them when given the opportunity due to the largely mistaken belief that they are a threat to small livestock. Perhaps the greatest concern for the species is when rock hyraxes are locally hunted by humans for food and skins, leading to likely declines and requiring the eagles to either switch to other prey or have their nesting attempts fail. In Walter Sisulu National Botanical Garden in South Africa, despite an appreciable decline in rock hyrax populations, breeding data revealed few inconsistencies with respect to the incubation period, nestling period and post fledging dispersal period in two known pairs of the eagles which were similar to established studies on Verreaux's eagles. In the prior area, despite it being one of the most popular nature areas in metropolitan Johannesburg, high levels of human activity have shown to have no apparent adverse effect on the eagles’ breeding behaviour (when exposed to similar levels of disturbance, golden eagles have been shown to temporarily abandon their nests). However, in South Africa, the overall number of pairs declined from 78 in 1980 (25 in reserves) to 27 in 1988 (with 19 in preserves). In Walter Sisulu National Botanical Garden, it has been wondered whether artificial feeding may be necessary in order to maintain a breeding pair in the face of continuing declines of available wild prey.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1984781", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1984781", "title": "William Steinberg", "text": "William Steinberg\n\nWilliam Steinberg (Cologne, August 1, 1899New York City, May 16, 1978) was a German-American conductor.\n\nSteinberg was born Hans Wilhelm Steinberg in Cologne, Germany. He displayed early talent as a violinist, pianist, and composer, conducting his own choral/ orchestral composition (based on texts from Ovid's \"Metamorphoses\") at age 13. In 1914, he began studies at the Cologne Conservatory, where his piano teacher was the Clara Schumann pupil Lazzaro Uzielli and his conducting mentor was Hermann Abendroth. He graduated with distinction, winning the Wüllner Prize for conducting, in 1919. He immediately became a second violinist in the Cologne Opera orchestra, but was dismissed from the position by Otto Klemperer for using his own bowings. He was soon re-hired by Klemperer as an assistant, and in 1922, he conducted Fromental Halévy's opera \"La Juive\" as a substitute. When Klemperer left in 1924, Steinberg served as Principal Conductor. He left a year later, in 1925, for Prague, where he was conductor of the German Theater. He next took the position of music director of the Frankfurt Opera. In 1930, in Frankfurt, he conducted the world premiere of Arnold Schoenberg's \"Von heute auf morgen\".\n\nIn 1933, Steinberg was relieved of his post by the Nazis because he was Jewish. According to the grandson of composer Ernst Toch, Steinberg was \"rehearsing [Toch's opera \"Der Fächer\" (\"The Fan\")] in Cologne when Nazi brownshirts came storming into the hall and literally lifted the baton out of his hand\".; Steinberg, who had married Lotte Stern in Frankfurt in 1934, was then restricted to conducting concerts for the Jewish Culture League in Frankfurt and Berlin. The Steinbergs left Germany in 1936 for the British Mandate of Palestine, which is now Israel. Eventually, with co-founder Bronisław Huberman, Steinberg trained the Palestine Symphony Orchestra, which would later be known as the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra. Steinberg was conducting the orchestra when Arturo Toscanini visited there in 1936. Toscanini was impressed with Steinberg's preliminary groundwork for his concerts and later engaged him as an assistant in preparing for the NBC Symphony Orchestra radio broadcasts.\n\nSteinberg emigrated to the United States in 1938. He conducted a number of concerts with the NBC Symphony Orchestra from 1938 to 1940. He conducted summer concerts at Lewisohn Stadium at the City College of New York (1940–41), led New York Philharmonic concerts in 1943–44, and also conducted at the San Francisco Opera. He became a US citizen in 1944, and was engaged as music director of the Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra from 1945 to 1952. Steinberg is best known for his long tenure as music director of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra from 1952 to 1976. Steinberg's Pittsburgh appearances in January 1952 were so impressive, he was quickly engaged as music director and also signed to a recording contract with Capitol Records. Thereafter, Pittsburgh was the center of his activity although he held other important positions. From 1958 to 1960, he also conducted the London Philharmonic Orchestra, but eventually resigned that post because the added workload led to medical problems with his arm. Steinberg led the New York Philharmonic for twelve weeks while on sabbatical leave from Pittsburgh in 1964-65; This led to his engagement as the Philharmonic's principal guest conductor from 1966 to 1968. From 1969 to 1972, Steinberg was music director of the Boston Symphony Orchestra (with which he had achieved earlier success as guest conductor), while maintaining his Pittsburgh post. He toured Europe with the Boston Symphony in April 1971.\n\nThese additional engagements often led to rumors that Steinberg would leave Pittsburgh for a full-time position elsewhere. In 1968 though he declared, \"We are too closely wed, the Pittsburgh Symphony and I, to contemplate any divorce.\" On another occasion, Steinberg said that conducting had become the profession of a traveling salesman. \"A conductor has to stay put to educate an orchestra.\" However, by 1975 Steinberg, who suffered from heart and circulatory ailments, felt pressured to end his tenure and retired from his post at the end of the 1975-76 Pittsburgh Symphony season.\n\nSteinberg guest-conducted most of the major US orchestras, including the Chicago Symphony, Cincinnati Symphony, Cleveland Orchestra, Dallas Symphony, Los Angeles Philharmonic, San Francisco Symphony, Seattle Symphony, and Philadelphia Orchestra. Abroad he conducted the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra, Berlin Philharmonic, Frankfurt Opera and Museum Orchestra, Frankfurt Radio Symphony Orchestra, Israel Philharmonic Orchestra, Montreal Symphony Orchestra, Munich Philharmonic, Orchestre de la Société des Concerts du Conservatoire, Orchestra dell'Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia, RAI Orchestra of Rome, Orchestra of the Teatro di San Carlo, Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra (in their 1955 Beethoven cycle), Royal Liverpool Philharmonic, Tonhalle Orchester Zürich, Toronto Symphony Orchestra, Vancouver Symphony Orchestra, and WDR Symphony Orchestra Cologne. He also appeared at summer festivals in the US and Canada (Ambler Temple University Festival, Hollywood Bowl, Ojai, Ravinia, Robin Hood Dell, Saratoga, Tanglewood, and Vancouver) as well as in Europe (Salzburg, Lucerne, Montreux). Steinberg conducted at the Metropolitan Opera in several productions including Barber's \"Vanessa,\" Verdi's \"Aida,\" and Wagner's \"Die Walküre\", during his sabbatical in 1964-65.\n\nSteinberg died in New York City on May 16, 1978, having entered the hospital after conducting a New York Philharmonic concert on May 1 that featured violinist Isaac Stern.\n\nSteinberg recorded \"Don Juan\" and his own suite from \"Der Rosenkavalier\" (works by Richard Strauss) with Walter Legge's Philharmonia Orchestra in the summer of 1957. The following year he conducted them in concerts at Lucerne before assuming the conductorship of the London Philharmonic. Steinberg's first recording was however made in 1928, when he accompanied Bronisław Huberman in Tchaikovsky's Violin Concerto with the Staatskapelle Berlin. In 1940 Steinberg recorded excerpts from Wagner's \"Lohengrin,\" \"Tristan und Isolde,\" and \"Tannhäuser\", as well as Mozart's \"The Marriage of Figaro,\" with Metropolitan Opera members, issued anonymously on \"World's Greatest Opera\" records. After the war Steinberg made a single album for the Musicraft label with the Buffalo Philharmonic - the first studio recording of Shostakovich's Symphony No. 7 in 1946. He led several accompaniments for concerto recordings on RCA Victor by Alexander Brailowsky, Jascha Heifetz, William Kapell, and Arthur Rubinstein.\n\nSteinberg made numerous recordings for Capitol Records, all but two of them with the Pittsburgh Symphony. The exceptions included a recording with the Los Angeles Woodwinds of Mozart's \"Gran Partita\", K.361, taped in Hollywood in August 1952, and the aforementioned Strauss disc with the Philharmonia Orchestra. His Pittsburgh recordings for Capitol, all made in the Syria Mosque, included concertos with Nathan Milstein and Rudolf Firkušný, as well as a cross-section of the symphonic repertoire from Beethoven to Wagner. Nearly all of Steinberg's Capitol recordings were reissued in a 20-CD box set by EMI in September 2011.\n\nIn February 1960 Steinberg and the Pittsburgh Symphony moved to Everest Records, but by mutual agreement this contract was terminated after three releases since Everest abandoned their classical recording program. These were audiophile 35mm film master recordings, a technique pioneered by Everest Records at that time. A casualty of this decision was a planned recording of Mahler's Sixth Symphony with the London Philharmonic, which was to have been made in conjunction with Steinberg's performance given as part of the Mahler centenary in London. Steinberg and the Pittsburgh Symphony in March 1961 signed a pact with Enoch Light's Command label. Light had attended a Steinberg concert in Danbury, Connecticut a few years before and told the conductor he'd like to record the orchestra. After the Everest contract lapsed, Steinberg subsequently made a number of technically acclaimed records for Command on 35mm film recording stock. The Command releases, hailed as \"outstanding examples of contemporary recording,\" were made in the Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Hall in Pittsburgh. Light preferred the sound of this high-ceilinged auditorium with its open stage to that of Syria Mosque for recording. The initial Command recordings, Brahms Symphony No. 2 and Rachmaninoff Symphony No. 2, were taped on May 1–2, 1961. Steinberg's recording of the Brahms Symphony No. 2 was nominated for a Grammy for Classical Album of the Year in 1962. Steinberg said of these sessions, \"At first I opposed this location, because I can't hear the orchestra there, the ceiling is so high. I suppose it must be so high to make room for the Lincoln inscription. But the engineers said, 'The microphones hear very well, and we will use a lot of them.' Who am I to argue with the engineers? So we recorded in Memorial Hall. I am the only conductor in history who memorized the Gettysburg Address while rehearsing Brahms' Second Symphony.\"\n\nSteinberg's Command recordings eventually included complete cycles of the Beethoven and Brahms Symphonies, along with a diverse list of other works. Command's Pittsburgh Symphony activity ended after Steinberg recorded Bruckner's Seventh Symphony, his early Overture in G minor, two arrangements by Robert Russell Bennett, and Dimitri Shostakovich's Symphony No. 1 in April 1968. Command Vice President and General Manager Loren Becker stated that \"Steinberg's stature as a great conductor will also mean many more recordings of standard fare.\" However Becker departed Command a few months later and ABC, the label's owner, ended the Pittsburgh series. When Steinberg assumed his post with the Boston Symphony in 1969, he made several recordings first for RCA Red Seal, then Deutsche Grammophon, which contracted the Boston Symphony upon expiration of the RCA contract. His Boston recordings for both RCA and DG were of the first rank, both musically and technically.\n\nSteinberg received numerous awards, including both the Kilenyi Bruckner Medal and the Kilenyi Mahler Medal from The Bruckner Society of America. He was named a member of the International Institute of Arts and Letters in 1960. Steinberg was given a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame the same year. The Pittsburgh Chamber of Commerce named Steinberg Man of the Year for 1964 for his contributions to the city's cultural life, and for leading the Pittsburgh Symphony on a triumphant tour of Europe and the Middle East. He was also an honorary member of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia, the national fraternity for men in music. Steinberg received an honorary doctorate of music from Carnegie Institute of Technology in 1954, an honorary doctorate of music from Duquesne University in 1964, and an honorary doctorate of humanities from the University of Pittsburgh in 1966. He was named Sanford Professor of Music at Yale University in 1974.\n\nWilliam Steinberg was noted throughout his career for his straightforward yet expressive musical style, leading familiar works with integrity and authority such that they sounded fresh and vital. Despite the dynamic drive of his interpretations, his podium manner was a model of restraint. Steinberg said of his interpretive philosophy, \"One must always respect the character of the music and never try to grow lush foliage in a well tempered English garden.\" Referring to some of his more acrobatic colleagues, Steinberg remarked, \"The more they move around, the quieter I get.\" Pittsburgh principal flute Bernard Goldberg told how Steinberg \"looked forward to being 70 years old because only then did a conductor know what he was doing.\" Armando Ghitalla, distinguished Boston Symphony principal trumpet from 1966–79, said of Steinberg that \"his musical taste was one of the finest I've ever heard.\" Boston Symphony concertmaster Joseph Silverstein said Steinberg was \"as sophisticated a musician as I have ever known.\"\n\nSteinberg had a wide range of repertoire, including a sympathy for the English music of Elgar and Vaughan Williams. He led several important premieres, including the US premiere of Anton Webern's \"Six Pieces for Orchestra\", Op. 6. During his first Pittsburgh season, Steinberg conducted works by Bartók, Berg, Bloch, Britten, Copland, Harris, Honegger, Milhaud, Schuman, Stravinsky, Vaughan Williams, and Villa-Lobos at the Pittsburgh International Contemporary Music Festival (all of these performances appeared on record, and the Bloch, Schuman, and Vaughan Williams were licensed by Capitol). He was also admired as an interpreter of Beethoven, Brahms, Bruckner, Mahler, Strauss, and Wagner. He made a famous recording of Holst's \"The Planets\" with the Boston Symphony for Deutsche Grammophon, after learning the piece at the age of 70. Unusual for a conductor born in Europe, Steinberg was a sympathetic conductor of George Gershwin's music (he made Gershwin recordings for three different labels). His last Metropolitan Opera appearances were three performances of Wagner's \"Parsifal\" in April 1974.\n\nAlthough sometimes criticized for his unusual programming, Steinberg was a champion of certain lesser known works including Berlioz's Roméo et Juliette, Tchaikovsky's Manfred Symphony, Reger's \"Variations and Fugue on a Theme by Mozart\", and his own orchestral transcription of Verdi's String Quartet in E minor. Steinberg said, \"The literature is so enormous. I look into what my colleagues won't. Actually, I am not success minded. I merely dare. I take a risk. Criticism I get anyway.\" Steinberg's prestige however filled Carnegie Hall to 80 percent capacity under the unlikely circumstance of the first all-Schoenberg orchestral program ever given in New York.\n\nSteinberg once remarked to a San Francisco Symphony musician he corrected, \"I may be wrong, but I don't think so.\" Violinist David Schneider said, \"This quality of not taking himself too seriously endeared him to the musicians.\" Although all business on the podium, Steinberg was not above a bit of clowning in public; at one Pittsburgh Symphony fundraiser, he donned a blonde wig on his bald head that Johnny Carson jokingly presented him. Steinberg's puckish humor was often in evidence, as when he told \"Time Magazine\" that he had conceived \"something for the New York snobs—an all-Mendelssohn program. This is really the height of snobbishness, the wonderful answer to the question of just what do the snobs need.\" He said that he spoke four and a half languages - the half being English. Of his habit of eating a steak before every concert he conducted, Steinberg told a columnist, \"So you see, it's an expensive business - this concert conducting.\" Referring to a disagreement with violinist Nathan Milstein that led to Milstein walking out of a rehearsal, Steinberg said, \"He decided he would not stay and I decided I would not have him.\" Concerning acoustics he said, \"If the hall is resonant, the tempos must be changed.

She attended Hollywood High School in Hollywood, California between 1959 and 1963 and later studied art at Los Angeles City College. In 1963 she married her Hollywood High sweetheart that lasted less than one year but long enough to get what she wanted: a son, Bret Vetri, born September 8, 1963. She began acting and modeling in her teens.\n\nUsing the name Angela Dorian, Vetri was chosen as Playboy Playmate of the Month for the September 1967 issue and subsequently was the 1968 Playmate of the Year. Her centerfold was photographed by Curt Gunther. Vetri won $20,000 when she was selected Playmate of the Year. Other prizes included a new car (an all pink 1968 AMC AMX), gold watch, skis and a ski outfit, a complete wardrobe, a movie camera, a typewriter, a tape recorder, a stereo, and a guitar. A nude photo of her (along with fellow playmates Leslie Bianchini, Reagan Wilson, and Cynthia Myers) was inserted into Apollo 12 Extra-vehicular activity astronaut cuff checklists by pranksters at NASA.\n\nVetri posed topless for the April 1984 \"Playboy\" pictorial \"Playmates Forever!

In one scene, Rosemary (Mia Farrow) remarks to Vetri's character, Teresa, that she resembles the actress Victoria Vetri.\n\nIn January 1969, Vetri signed a multi-picture contract with Warner Bros.-Seven Arts and was given a starring role in \"When Dinosaurs Ruled the Earth\". She refused to have her hair turned blonde from its natural auburn for the film. The story required a blonde, so Vetri demanded a wig instead.

{"id": "1984786", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1984786", "title": "Jack McKeon", "text": "Jack McKeon\n\nJohn Aloysius McKeon (; born November 23, 1930), nicknamed \"Trader Jack,\" is an American former Major League Baseball manager and front-office executive.\n\nIn , at age 72, he won a World Series as manager of the Florida Marlins. Two full seasons removed from his previous managing job, McKeon had begun the season in retirement, but on May 11, he was induced to return to uniform to replace Jeff Torborg as the Marlins' skipper. The team was 16–22 and in next-to-last place in the National League East Division. Described upon his hiring by Marlins' general manager Larry Beinfest as a \"resurrection specialist,\" McKeon led the Marlins to a 75–49 win-loss record, a wild card berth, victories over the San Francisco Giants and Chicago Cubs in the National League divisional and championship series playoffs, and then a six-game World Series triumph over the New York Yankees.\n\nHe remained at the helm of the Marlins through 2005, then retired at age 74. In 2011, he took over the Marlins on June 20 for a second time as interim manager following the resignation of Edwin Rodríguez and served out the season. In so doing he became, at 80, the second oldest manager in big league history, behind only Connie Mack. He retired again at the end of the season with a career managerial record of 1,051–990 ().\n\nMcKeon previously managed the Kansas City Royals (1973–1975), Oakland Athletics (parts of both 1977 and 1978), San Diego Padres (1988–1990), and Cincinnati Reds (1997–2000).\n\nFrom July 7, 1980, through September 22, 1990, he served as the general manager of the Padres, assembling the team which won the 1984 National League pennant, the first in San Diego history.\n\nBorn in South Amboy, New Jersey, McKeon was a , catcher who threw and batted right-handed. He played baseball for the College of the Holy Cross, and also attended Seton Hall University and Elon College, earning a bachelor of science degree in physical education.\n\nMcKeon spent his entire early professional career (1949–64) in the minor leagues. He became a playing manager in 1955 at age 24, and then worked in the farm system of the original, modern-era Washington Senators franchise, and its successor, the Minnesota Twins, handling Triple-A assignments for the Vancouver Mounties (1962), Dallas-Fort Worth Rangers (1963) and Atlanta Crackers (through June 21, 1964). He scouted for the Twins starting in mid-1964 before joining the Royals in 1968, one year before their Major League debut, as skipper of their Class A High Point-Thomasville farm team, where he won the Carolina League playoff championship. He led their Triple-A affiliate, the Omaha Royals of the American Association, from its founding in 1969 through 1972, and won two league titles.\n\nMcKeon, then 42, was promoted to manager of the Kansas City Royals for 1973, succeeding Bob Lemon. The 1972 Royals had gone a disappointing 76–78 during the strike-shortened season, and moved into brand-new Royals Stadium in 1973. Paced by the slugging of first baseman John Mayberry, an All-Star performance from centerfielder Amos Otis and the 20-win season of left-hander Paul Splittorff, McKeon's 1973 club finished with a record of 88 wins and 74 losses (a win percentage, the best record yet compiled by the five-year-old franchise), six games behind eventual world champion Oakland in the AL West and the fourth-best mark in the American League. The 1973 Royals also saw the mid-August call up of 20-year-old George Brett, the future Hall of Famer.\n\nBut the 1974 Royals could not sustain that momentum and finished 77–85 (), next-to-last in the West division. McKeon's relationship with some of the players soured late in the campaign after his demand that hitting coach Charley Lau be relieved of his duties resulted in the latter's reassignment to the minor leagues. Two months after primary starting pitcher Steve Busby threatened to quit the team, McKeon was fired and replaced by California Angels third-base coach Whitey Herzog on July 24, 1975. At the time, the Royals were in second place in the American League West but trailed the defending and eventual division champion Oakland Athletics by eleven games. Herzog led Kansas City to three successive AL West titles (1976–78), and, in the 1980s, he would become one of McKeon's trading partners when both were general managers in the National League.\n\nMcKeon spent 1976 back in the minor leagues as skipper of the Richmond Braves of the International League. At season's end, he was named manager of the Oakland Athletics during a time when meddlesome team owner Charlie Finley was trading away veteran talent in anticipation of free agency. Nevertheless, McKeon had led the stripped-down 1977 A's to a respectable 26–27 mark by June 8, only six games out of first place in the AL West, when Finley shocked baseball by replacing him with Bobby Winkles. McKeon remained in the Oakland organization, initially as an assistant to Finley for the rest of 1977 while the A's struggled under Winkles, going 37–71. Then, in , McKeon returned to uniform as one of Winkles' coaches. History repeated itself when the undermanned A's roared off to a 19–5 start. They were still in first place at 24–15 on May 21 when Winkles resigned because of Finley's constant second-guessing and criticism of his job performance. McKeon then returned to the manager's post and finished the 1978 season, with Oakland winning only 45 of 123 games and falling into sixth place in the seven-team AL West. \n\nFired again by Finley, McKeon departed the Oakland organization to manage the Denver Bears, Triple-A affiliate of the Montreal Expos, in 1979.\n\nMcKeon then moved from the field into the front office. He began the 1980 season as the top assistant to Bob Fontaine, the general manager of the San Diego Padres. During the 1980 All-Star break, with the Padres in last place in the National League West Division, owner Ray Kroc and club president Ballard F. Smith fired Fontaine and replaced him with McKeon, making him a first-time general manager at the age of 49. During his first off-season, he set about rebuilding the Padres through a flurry of trades—earning his \"Trader Jack\" nickname.\n\nHe began by acquiring young catcher Terry Kennedy from Herzog's St. Louis Cardinals in an 11-player deal. Over the next four off seasons, he would also trade for Dave Dravecky, Garry Templeton and Carmelo Martínez, draft young stars Tony Gwynn and Kevin McReynolds, and sign free agents Steve Garvey and Graig Nettles, the core of San Diego's National League champions. In June 1989, he traded his own son-in-law, pitcher Greg Booker.\n\nHe told the New York Times in 1988: \"Why do I trade? I'm aggressive. I'm confident. I'm a gambler. I'm willing to make a trade and not be afraid I'll get nailed.\"\n\nMcKeon stayed in the front office through the terms of four different managers. When the fourth skipper, Larry Bowa, started at 16–30, McKeon took over the managerial reins himself on May 28. He led the Padres to a 67–48 mark for the rest of 1988, and an 89–73 record in . But when his Padres stalled at 37–43 at the All-Star break, McKeon turned the team over to coach Greg Riddoch. Slightly more than two months later, he was ousted from the general manager's job when the Padres' new owner, Tom Werner, hired Joe McIlvaine away from the New York Mets.\n\nMcKeon was out of baseball in 1991–92 before joining the Cincinnati Reds in 1993 as a Major League scout and then senior adviser for player personnel, working under GM Jim Bowden. He was in his fourth season in the latter job on July 25, , when at age 66 he was asked to return to the field as the replacement for Ray Knight as the club's manager. The Reds were 43–56 and nine games out in the National League Central Division, but McKeon coaxed them to a 33–30 mark for the rest of the season. He then survived a poor campaign, with Cincinnati again posting a sub-.500 (77–85) record and finishing 25 games out of first place in its division (though the Reds had lost talent from previous years and were actually considered to have overachieved). McKeon turned the Reds around in , leading them to 96 victories and a tie for the National League wild card through the full 162-game season. However, the Reds were defeated 5–0 by the Mets in a one-game playoff held in their home ballpark, Cinergy Field, and were eliminated from the postseason. Nevertheless, McKeon was named 1999 NL Manager of the Year for his achievement.\n\nOn the eve of spring training, the Reds electrified their fans by acquiring superstar center fielder Ken Griffey, Jr. — a Cincinnati native and son of the Reds' coach and former star — in a trade with the Seattle Mariners. Young Griffey hit 40 home runs, but the Reds posted a disappointing 85–77 record and finished ten games behind the Cardinals. After the season ended, McKeon was relieved of his managerial duties.\n\nMcKeon was again named National League Manager of the Year in 2003 — the result of leading the Marlins, who were six games below .500 when he took over on May 11, to a 75-49 record the rest of the way. The Marlins proceeded to win the National League pennant, and were then victorious in the World Series, defeating the New York Yankees in a considerable upset. At age 72, McKeon became the oldest manager to win the World Series. The victory came against the team for which he rooted in his youth, having lived in South Amboy, New Jersey and attending Yankee games while a child.\n\nOn October 2, 2005, just after the Marlins won the last game of the 2005 season, McKeon announced that he would not be returning the following season. McKeon led the Marlins to three of the six winning seasons in franchise history, but the Marlins were undertaking a rebuilding process, exchanging for veterans for unproven youngsters, and there was a consensus within the organization that a managerial change was in order.\n\nOn June 20, 2011, after manager Edwin Rodríguez resigned, the Florida Marlins held a press conference to announce that McKeon had been named interim manager. \"I don't need this job but I love it,\" McKeon said, in taking over a team that had lost 10 straight and 18 of its last 19. He retired after the conclusion of the 2011 season.\n\nMcKeon currently lives in Elon, North Carolina. Prior to his latest managerial stint, he was serving as a special assistant to Florida Marlins owner Jeffrey Loria.\n\nMcKeon is a devout Catholic and attends daily Mass, even doing so while his team was traveling during his managerial career. He attributes much of his success, especially the Marlins' win in the 2003 National League Championship Series, to the intercession of Saint Thérèse of Lisieux.\n\nIn 1950, McKeon enlisted in the United States Air Force and played for the baseball team at Sampson Air Force Base in New York.\n\nMcKeon is the author of two books, \"Jack of All Trades\" and \"I'm Just Getting Started\".\n\nMcKeon's son, Kasey, was a minor league catcher from 1989–91 before becoming a scout; as of , he is the director of player procurement of the Washington Nationals. Jack McKeon's grandson, Kellan, is a two-time state champion wrestler for Chapel Hill High School and was the captain of the wrestling team at Duke University.\n\nOn May 5, 2012, McKeon was inducted into the Fulton County Baseball & Sports Hall of Fame for his achievements with the Gloversville-Johnstown Glovers, in which he played for in 1950 and 1951 in Gloversville, New York. On Tuesday, May 26, 2015, McKeon was inducted into the Irish American Baseball Hall of Fame, along with former Royals slugger Mike Sweeney, broadcaster Dave O'Brien, New York Mets public relations executive Shannon Forde, and Bill Murray, the comedic actor and owner of several minor league baseball teams. In 2017, McKeon was elected into the Padres Hall of Fame.\n\n"}

{"id": "1984807", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1984807", "title": "Jambalaya (On the Bayou)", "text": "Jambalaya (On the Bayou)\n\n\"Jambalaya (On the Bayou)\" is a song written and recorded by American country music singer Hank Williams that was first released in July 1952. Named for a Creole and Cajun dish, jambalaya, it spawned numerous cover versions and has since achieved popularity in several different music genres.\n\nWilliams began writing the song while listening to the Cajuns talk about food on the Hadacol Caravan bus. With a melody based on the Cajun song \"Grand Texas\", some sources, including AllMusic, claim that the song was co-written by Williams and Moon Mullican, with Williams credited as sole author and Mullican receiving ongoing royalties. Williams' biographer Colin Escott speculates that it is likely Mullican wrote at least some of the song and Hank's music publisher Fred Rose paid him surreptitiously so that he wouldn't have to split the publishing with Moon's label King Records. Williams' song resembles \"Grand Texas\" in melody only. \"Grand Texas\" is a song about a lost love, a woman who left the singer to go with another man to \"Big Texas\"; \"Jambalaya\", while maintaining a Cajun theme, is about life, parties and stereotypical food of Cajun cuisine. The narrator leaves to pole a pirogue down the shallow water of the bayou, to attend a party with his girlfriend Yvonne and her family. At the feast they have Cajun cuisine, notably Jambalaya, crawfish pie and filé gumbo, and drink liquor from fruit jars. Yvonne is his \"ma cher amio\", which is Cajun French for \"my good friend\" or more likely to mean \"my girlfriend.\" Technically in Cajun culture \"ma cher amio\" means my dear, which refers to Yvonne in this song.\n\nWilliams recorded the song on June 13, 1952, his first recording session in six months, at Castle Studio in Nashville with backing provided by Jerry Rivers (fiddle), Don Helms (steel guitar), Chet Atkins (lead guitar), Chuck Wright (bass) and probably Ernie Newton (bass). The recording Williams made differs significantly from Mullican's, which was released in the same month as Williams' version but with a different order of verses and extra rhyming couplets.\n\nSince the original melody of the song was from \"Grand Texas\", the song is a staple of Cajun culture. However, although Williams kept a Louisiana theme, the song is not a true cajun song, which helped the song gain widespread popularity:\nReleased in July 1952, it reached number one on the U.S. country charts for fourteen non-consecutive weeks. Williams performed \"Jambalaya\" at the Louisiana Hayride as part of his \"homecoming\" in fall, 1952 (after being fired from the Grand Ole Opry). A live recording released as part of a series of Hayride performances includes outbursts of applause. Another unreleased version is included in the 2017 CD set, \"At the Louisiana Hayride Tonight\".\n\nAfter Williams released his version, Cajuns recorded the song again using Cajun instruments. However, they used Williams' lyrics translated into the Cajun French language. \"Jambalaya\" remains one of Hank Williams' most popular songs today. International, translated or derived versions do exist at least in Chinese, Dutch, Finnish, French, Italian, Polish, German, Spanish, and Estonian.\n\nA demo version of Williams singing \"Jambalaya (On the Bayou)\" with just his guitar, likely recorded in 1951, is also available. Williams composed a sequel to the song from the female perspective, \"I'm Yvonne (Of the Bayou)\", recorded by Goldie Hill. It was not as popular. As with \"Jambalaya\" there is speculation that Williams may have written this song with Mullican and their friend Jimmy Rule.\n\n\n"}

Such preference has been described as being a matter of professional education, as opposed to an assessment of the actual merits of either method. In the latter group, however, the Society of Management Accountants of Canada endorses EAC, having discussed it as early as 1959 in a published monograph (which was a year before the first mention of NPV in accounting textbooks).\n\nEAC can be used in the following scenarios:\n\n\nA manager must decide on which machine to purchase, assuming an annual interest rate of 5%:\n\nThe conclusion is to invest in machine B since it has a lower EAC.\n\nSuch analysis can also be carried out on an after-tax basis, and extensive work has been undertaken in Canada for investment appraisal of assets subject to its capital cost allowance regime for computing depreciation for income tax purposes.

The keystone is the centre stone or masonry unit at the apex of an arch. The springer is the lowest voussoir on each side, located where the curve of the arch springs from the vertical support or abutment of the wall or pier.\n\nThe keystone is often decorated or enlarged. An enlarged and sometimes slightly dropped keystone is often found in Mannerist arches of the 16th century, beginning with the works of Giulio Romano, who also began the fashion for using voussoirs above rectangular openings, rather than a lintel (Palazzo Stati Maccarani, Rome, circa 1522).\n\nThe word is a stonemasonry's term borrowed in Middle English from French verbs connoting a \"turn\" (\"OED\"). Each wedge-shaped voussoir \"turns aside\" the thrust of the mass above, transferring it from stone to stone to the springer's bottom face (\"impost\"), which is horizontal and passes the thrust on to the supports. Voussoir arches distribute weight efficiently, and take maximum advantage of the compressive strength of stone, as in an arch bridge. The outer boundary of a voussoir is referred to as an \"extrados\".\n\nIn Visigothic and Moorish architectural traditions, the voussoirs are often in alternating colours, usually red and white. This is also found sometimes in Romanesque architecture.\n\nDuring the 18th and 19th centuries, British bricklayers became aware that, by thickening the vertical mortar joint between regularly shaped bricks from bottom to top, they could construct an elliptical arch of useful strength over either a standard \"former\", or over specially constructed timber falsework (temporary structure to be removed once the construction is complete). The bricks used in such an arch are often referred to as \"voussoirs\".\n\n\n"}

Formerly called Riverside, the place was renamed in 1888 for the atmospheric conditions of the Nehalem Valley. The first land claims in the area had been made circa 1870. The original Riverside post office was closed in 1975.\nOn July 6, 2001, the Mist store, which was built in 1874, caught fire and was destroyed. Until then, it was the oldest continuously operating business in Oregon, offering food and hardware and displaying historic newspaper clippings and antique logging equipment on the walls.\n\nMist is a crossroads community where Oregon Route 47 turns north to Clatskanie, and a pioneer trail (Burn Road) crossed the Nehalem River and went south to Vernonia. It is the eastern terminus of Oregon Route 202. The Nehalem River valley widens between Mist and Jewell and was favored by the Native American tribes of the area for hunting; it was later favored by early European American settlers for agriculture. Although the area is now sparsely settled, it is notable for having the largest operating sawmill in Columbia County and also geological conditions lending themselves to natural gas storage. Mist contains one of the very few, and therefore very valuable, natural gas storage areas in the Pacific Northwest. It operates unobtrusively on a hill near Mist. It is controlled by NW Natural (formerly Northwest Natural Gas) and is connected by several pipelines, including a and a pipeline along the Nehalem Highway.\n\nEarlier in the 20th century, Mist had a logging camp next to a railroad used by the Kerry Timber and Logging Company. The remains of the camp were discovered in 2008 and 2009. Though still important in terms of logging, the population today is sparse, and there is no longer a railroad.\n\n"}

Because the Baháʼí Faith has no clergy, they carry out the affairs of the community. In addition to existing at the local level, there are national Spiritual Assemblies (although \"national\" in some cases refers to a portion of a country or to a group of countries).\n\nBaháʼu'lláh, ʻAbdu'l-Bahá, and Shoghi Effendi stated how Spiritual Assemblies should be elected by the Baháʼís, defined their nature and purposes, and described in considerable detail how they should function. Since these institutions are grounded in the Baháʼí authoritative texts, Baháʼís regard them as divine in nature, and contrast the wealth of scriptural guidance with the paucity of scriptural texts on which Jewish, Christian, and Islamic religious institutions are based.\n\nThe Universal House of Justice has added that among the responsibilities of Local Spiritual Assemblies are to be “channels of divine guidance, planners of the teaching work, developers of human resources, builders of communities, and loving shepherds of the multitudes.” On a practical level, they organize local Baháʼí communities by maintaining a local Baháʼí Fund, owning the local Baháʼí center (if one exists), organizing Baháʼí events, counseling Baháʼís about personal difficulties, assisting with Baháʼí marriages and funerals, providing educational programs to adults and children, publicizing the Baháʼí Faith locally, fostering projects for the social and economic development of the region, and enrolling new members of the religion. Spiritual Assemblies appoint individuals, task forces, and committees to carry out many of their functions. National Spiritual Assemblies have a similar mandate at the national level: they coordinate publishing and distribution of Baháʼí literature, direct relations with national organizations and governmental agencies, oversee the work of local spiritual assemblies, and (in some countries) Regional Councils, set local Baháʼí jurisdictional boundaries, provide various educational services and programs, and set the overall tone and direction of the national community.\n\nThe origin of the institution of the local Spiritual Assembly originates from Baháʼu'lláh's book of laws, the Kitáb-i-Aqdas:\n\nThe passage gives the institution a name, a minimum number (nine, for “the number of Baha” refers to the numerical value of the letters of that word, which is nine), and a general responsibility to take care of the welfare of others even as they would take care of their own. While the resulting institution is local, in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas Baháʼu'lláh also spoke about the responsibilities of the supreme or Universal House of Justice. In response to the passage, Mírzá Asadu'lláh Isfahání, a prominent Baháʼí teacher, organized an unofficial Baháʼí consultative body in Tehran, Iran, about 1878. The first official Baháʼí consultative body was organized under ʻAbdu'l-Bahá's direction by Hand of the Cause Hají Ákhúnd in Tehran in 1897; by 1899 it was an elected body. Because of the difficulties in Iran caused by persecution of the Baháʼí Faith, the Tehran body served to coordinate both local and national Baháʼí activities. It is not known what name the body was organized under.\nThe development of a Baháʼí community in the United States in the 1890s necessitated the creation of local Baháʼí consultative bodies there. In 1899 the Baháʼís of Chicago elected a local council based on their awareness of the provisions of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas (which was circulated in provisional English translation as a typescript as early as 1900). The New York Baháʼís elected a “Board of Counsel” in December 1900. In 1901 the Chicago body was reorganized and re-elected and took the name “House of Justice of Bahais of Chicago, Ills.” In response, ʻAbdu'l-Bahá revealed three tablets of encouragement and guidance to the body, including prayers to say at the beginning and end of their meetings, prayers that Baháʼís use around the world today for their Spiritual Assembly meetings.\n\nIn 1902 ʻAbdu'l-Bahá sent a very important tablet to the Chicago governing body where he said \"let the designation of that body be 'Spiritual Assembly'—this for the reason that, were it to use the term 'House of Justice', the government might hereafter come to suppose that it was acting as a court of law, or concerning itself in political matters, or that, at some indeterminate future time, it would involve itself in the affairs of government... This same designation hath been universally adopted throughout Iran.\" For this reason, Baháʼí local and national governing bodies are designated “Spiritual Assemblies” to this day.\n\nThe first decade of the twentieth century saw the proliferation of local Baháʼí governing bodies. Often unaware of ʻAbdu'l-Bahá's guidance, they had a variety of titles in English and Persian, such as “Council Board, “Board of Consultation,” “House of Spirituality,” and \"Executive Committee.\" Unaware ʻAbdu'l-Bahá had told the Chicago Baháʼís to elect their body every five years, they were usually elected annually or even semi-annually. The number of members varied from five to nineteen (except in New York City, where ʻAbdu'l-Bahá, in 1911, said they should elect twenty-seven members in order to be inclusive of and to foster unity between that city's diverse Baháʼí groups). They were male only until ʻAbdu'l-Bahá said, in 1911, that women should be elected to the local governing bodies existing in the United States; their exclusion from local bodies continued in Iran until the 1950s, because of Iranian cultural conventions. In the period of 1900 - 1911, consultative bodies are known to have existed in Kenosha, Wisconsin, Boston, Massachusetts, Washington, D.C., Spokane, Washington, northern Hudson County, New Jersey, the greater San Francisco area, California, in the United States; and in Bombay, British Raj India; Cairo, Khedivate of Egypt; Acre, Ottoman Syria; Baku, Tbilisi, Ashgabat and Samarqand in the Russian Empire; and Mashhad, Abadih, Qazvin, and Tabriz, Persia. Consultative bodies also existed for the Jewish and Zoroastrian Baháʼís in Tehran and for the women of a few Baháʼí communities.\n\nBecause efforts to organize local Baháʼí consultative bodies remained informal, few additional ones had formed by 1921 (notable exceptions being Cleveland, Ohio, and London), and some of the ones in the United States had lapsed. Upon assuming the Guardianship of the Baháʼí Faith, Shoghi Effendi read ʻAbdu'l-Bahá's Will and Testament and made establishment of local spiritual assemblies an early priority. His second general letter to the Baháʼís of the world, dated March 5, 1922, referred to the “vital necessity of having a local Spiritual Assembly in every locality where the number of adult declared believers exceeds nine.” The letter also quoted extensively from Baháʼu'lláh and ʻAbdu'l-Bahá about the purposes and duties of Spiritual Assemblies.\n\nThe result was a rapid proliferation of local Spiritual Assemblies; a 1928 list had the following: Australia, 6; Brazil, 1; Burma, 3; Canada, 2; China, 1; Egypt, 1; England, 4; France, 1; India, 4; Japan, 1; Korea, 1; Lebanon, 1; New Zealand, 1; Palestine, 1; Iran, 5; Russia, 1; South Africa, 1; Switzerland, 1; Syria, 1; Turkey, 1; and the United States, 47, for a total of 85 local Spiritual Assemblies worldwide.\n\nThe number has grown ever since; in 2001 there were 11,740 local Spiritual Assemblies worldwide.\n\nNational Spiritual Assemblies are first mentioned in ʻAbdu'l-Bahá's Will and Testament, but the fact that they would be established circulated for years before the contents of the Will became publicly available in early 1922. In 1909, wrote extensively about the role of the national House of Justice (as it would have been known then) in his \"The Universal Religion: Bahaism, Its Rise and Social Import.\" In that year, also, the Baháʼís of the United States and Canada elected a nine-member “Executive Committee” for the Bahai Temple Unity, a continental consultative body formed to build the Baháʼí House of Worship in Wilmette, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago. Subsequently the Bahai Temple Unity, which held annual conventions, appointed committees to publish Baháʼí literature, coordinate the spread of the Baháʼí Faith across North America, and review Baháʼí publications for their accuracy. By the time of ʻAbdu'l-Bahá's passing in November 1921, the Bahai Temple Unity functioned as a “national” Baháʼí coordinating body.\nIn the same March 5, 1922 letter to the Baháʼís of the world that called for the election of local Spiritual Assemblies, Shoghi Effendi called on them to “indirectly” elect National Spiritual Assemblies. He also enumerated committees that a National Spiritual Assembly should have in order to carry out its responsibilities. “Indirect” election referred to the process, mentioned in the Will and Testament of ʻAbdu'l-Bahá, of the Baháʼís electing one or more delegates from each locality, who would represent them at a national convention and would vote for the nine members of the National Spiritual Assembly. The 1928 issue of \"The Baháʼí World\" listed nine National Spiritual Assemblies: Persia (Iran); the United States and Canada; Germany; Great Britain and Ireland; India and Burma; Egypt; Turkistan; Caucasus; and Iraq. Of these, the Iranian body was still the “Central Spiritual Assembly” in Tehran, elected by the Baháʼís of that community; it was not until 1934 that a national Baháʼí membership list could be drawn up that allowed the election of delegates and convening of a fully representative national convention. It is possible that the Turkistan and Caucasus bodies were preliminary as well. By 1953 the number of National Spiritual Assemblies worldwide had increased to 12; in 1963, 56; by 1968, 81, by 1988, 148; by 2001, 182.\n\nAn important part of the process was the establishment of “regional” National Spiritual Assemblies; thus in 1951 all of South America elected a single National Spiritual Assembly, but by 1963 nearly every nation on that continent had its own. National Spiritual Assemblies are still being formed as areas of the world achieve religious freedom. Some National Spiritual Assemblies have been formed in areas smaller than a nation: Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico have their own “national” bodies because they are geographically separated from the lower forty-eight states; Sicily has its own because Shoghi Effendi said major islands also like in the Caribbean should elect independent National Spiritual Assemblies.\n\nLike local Spiritual Assemblies, all National Spiritual Assemblies have nine members and are elected annually, usually during the Ridván Festival (April 21-May 2). All Baháʼí elections occur in an atmosphere of prayer where nominations, campaigning, and all discussion of persons is forbidden.\n\nThe members of the National Spiritual Assemblies collectively serve as the electoral college for electing the Universal House of Justice, the supreme governing body of the Baháʼí Faith, which was first formed in 1963.\n\n\n"}

With the Cincinnati & Cleveland Buckeyes he won a pair of batting titles, hit .340 over seven seasons from 1942 to 1948, and helped the team to two pennants and the Negro World Series title. He was named the National League's Rookie of the Year in with the Boston Braves, and led the NL in stolen bases in his first two seasons.\n\nNicknamed \"The Jet\" for his stunning speed, Jethroe was born in Columbus, Mississippi but grew up in East St. Louis, Illinois. Until late in his life he was believed to have been born in 1922, but more recent sources have given the year as 1917 or 1918. A switch-hitter who threw right-handed, he played semipro ball in the St. Louis area after high school, and briefly appeared as a catcher for the Indianapolis ABCs in 1938.\n\nFrom 1942 to 1948 he played for the Buckeyes of the Negro American League, leading the league in stolen bases three times. He batted .487 in 39 at bats in his first season in 1942, a year in which a car hit several Buckeyes players on September 7 while they were standing next to their disabled bus at a roadside outside Geneva, Ohio; catcher Buster Brown and pitcher Smoky Owens were killed.\n\nJethroe received a physical deferment from military service in World War II. In 1943, he batted .291 while leading the league in both doubles (8) and triples (4). In 1944, he won his first batting title with a .353 average, and led the league with 14 doubles and 18 steals. On April 16, 1945, following pressure from a Boston city councilman, Jethroe was one of three black players to try out for the Boston Red Sox on the recommendation of black sportswriter Wendell Smith. After the tryout was observed by coaches Hugh Duffy and Larry Woodall, he was turned away along with Marvin Williams and Jackie Robinson, as the Red Sox had no plans to integrate their roster. Jethroe returned to the Buckeyes and won his second consecutive batting title with a .393 average, again leading the league with 10 triples and 21 stolen bases. The Buckeyes won the pennant under player-manager Quincy Trouppe with a 53–16 record, and swept the Homestead Grays – loaded with aging stars such as Cool Papa Bell, Buck Leonard and Jud Wilson – in the Negro World Series. Jethroe hit .333, and Cleveland's pitching dominated the Series as the Buckeyes outscored the Grays 15–3.\n\nIn Jethroe batted .310 and led the league in steals for the third straight year with 20. He batted .340 in as the Buckeyes took another pennant but lost the Negro World Series to the New York Cubans four games to one, although Jethroe hit .316. He was named to the East-West All-Star team five times (1942, 1944–47), and ended his Cleveland career with a .296 average in 1948.\n\nRobinson broke baseball's color line with the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1947. Seeing Robinson's success, Dodgers general manager Branch Rickey acquired Jethroe's services from Cleveland for a reported $5,000. From 1948-49 he played for the Dodgers' Montreal Royals minor league team in the International League, batting .322 after joining the team late in 1948, and leading the league with 89 stolen bases in 1949 while scoring 154 runs. In October 1949, he was sold to the Braves for $150,000.\n\nOn April 18, 1950, Jethroe became the first black player on the Boston Braves roster, and collected two hits including a home run. He was named Rookie of the Year that season at age 32 (although he was then believed to be 28) after hitting .273 with 100 runs, 18 home runs and 58 runs batted in; his 35 stolen bases topped the National League, and were the most by a Brave since Hap Myers stole 57 in 1913. He remains the oldest player to have won Rookie of the Year honors. Jethroe enjoyed an almost identical but perhaps slightly improved season in when he posted better figures in batting (.280), runs (101), RBI (65), hits (160), doubles (29) and triples (10), and again hit 18 homers. He also repeated his 35 steals, once again to lead the league.\n\nIn he slumped badly, hitting .232, and reportedly had vision trouble; rumors were also circulating that he was older than his listed age. His career was also marked by difficulty in the outfield, as he led the NL in errors in each of his three full seasons, though he also led the league with 6 double plays as a rookie; his arm was not as accurate as those of most major league center fielders, and it was believed that he was playing too deep. In addition, he was among the NL's top four batters in strikeouts each year. On June 7 of his last year with the team, he hit the final grand slam in Boston Braves history before the club moved to Milwaukee.\n\nJethroe spent 1953 with Triple-A Toledo, hitting .307. Before the season he was one of six players acquired by the Pittsburgh Pirates in exchange for infielder Danny O'Connell, but Jethroe played only two games for the team, the last on April 15. After that, he spent the next five seasons at Toronto in the International League. Despite being among the league leaders in hits, runs and stolen bases during that period, his batting averages generally declined, and he never got another chance in the majors.\n\nIn a four-season major league career, he was a .261 hitter with 460 hits, 49 home runs, 280 runs, 181 RBI and 98 stolen bases in 442 games. He was called \"the quickest human being I've ever seen\" by former minor league teammate Don Newcombe.\n\nAfter his baseball career ended, Jethroe settled in Erie, Pennsylvania, where he worked in a local factory for several years, played in the city's semi-pro Glenwood League, then opened a bar. In 1994, Jethroe sued Major League Baseball in order to collect pension payments, as he was one of a host of other former Negro leaguers who couldn't qualify because of the racial discrimination of the 1940s and 1950s which delayed their professional careers. While the lawsuit was dismissed by a federal judge, in 1997 Major League Baseball decided to give a yearly payment plan to Negro league veterans, including Jethroe. He died of a heart attack in 2001 in Erie.\n\nIn 2019, the International League announced that Jethroe would be inducted into its hall of fame.\n\n\n\n"}

An adiabatic shear band is one of the many mechanisms of failure that occur in metals and other materials that are deformed at a high rate in processes such as metal forming, machining and ballistic impact. Adiabatic shear bands are usually very narrow, typically 5-500 μm and they consist of very highly sheared material.\n\"Adiabatic\" is a thermodynamic term meaning an absence of heat transfer – the heat produced is retained in the zone where it is created. (The opposite extreme, where all heat that is produced is conducted away, is \"isothermal\".)\n\nIt is necessary to include some basics of plastic deformation to understand the link between heat produced and the plastic work done. If we carry out a compression test on a cylindrical specimen to, say, 50% of its original height, the stress of the work material will increase usually significantly with reduction. This is called ‘work hardening’. During work hardening, the micro-structure, distortion of grain structure and the generation and glide of dislocations all occur. The remainder of the plastic work done – which can be as much as 90% of the total, is dissipated as heat.\n\nIf the plastic deformation is carried out under dynamic conditions, such as by drop forging, then the plastic deformation is localized more as the forging hammer speed is increased. This also means that the deformed material becomes hotter the higher the speed of the drop hammer. Now as metals become warmer, their resistance to further plastic deformation decreases. From this point we can see that there is a type of cascade effect: as more plastic deformation is absorbed by the metal, more heat is produced, making it easier for the metal to deform further. This is a catastrophic effect which almost inevitably leads to failure.\n\nIt appears that the first person to carry out any reported experimental programme to investigate the heat produced as a result of plastic deformation was Henri Tresca. These results were reported in a very long and useful paper in June 1878 \nTresca forged a bar of platinum (as well as many other metals); at the moment of forging the metal had just cooled down below red heat. The subsequent blow of the steam hammer, which left a depression in the bar and lengthened it, also reheated it in the direction of two lines in the form of a letter X. So great was this reheating, the metal along these lines was fully restored for some seconds to red heat. Tresca carried out many forging experiments on different metals. Tresca estimated the amount of plastic work converted into heat from a large number of experiments, and it was always above 70%.\n"}

The Grumbler was one of Robertson's more well known publications.\n\nHe was hired as a reporter and then city editor at \"The Globe\" in Toronto, but left \"The Globe\" to found \"The Toronto Daily Telegraph\" in 1866. That paper lasted five years, and Robertson went to England as a reporter for \"The Globe\". He returned to Toronto in 1876 and convinced his friend and former colleague, Goldwin Smith, to loan him $10,000 to enable him to launch the \"Toronto Evening Telegram.\" In the Toronto Evening Telegram he wrote a recurring column on Toronto landmarks. The Evening Telegram was a success from the start and Robertson was soon a wealthy man. Eventually these columns were published in a book called Robertson's Landmarks of Toronto which consists of six volumes.\n\nHe was elected to the House of Commons of Canada for the electoral district of Toronto East in the 1896 federal election defeating the incumbent Conservative MP, Emerson Coatsworth. An Independent Conservative, he did not run for re-election in 1900.\n\nThe world of sports was also a focus for Robertson’s public-spiritedness. A fervent advocate of amateur sport, he served as president of the Ontario Hockey Association from 1899 to 1905, which was a critical time period in the history of the sport. His battle to protect hockey from the influence of professionalism caused him to be called the \"father of Amateur Hockey in Ontario.\" During his term as president, the OHA was able to set rules defining professionalism in hockey. He worked especially hard to rid hockey of increasing violence both on and off the ice. Robertson’s donation of silver trophies to hockey, cricket, and bowling further encouraged amateur competition. The championship trophy of the Ontario Hockey League, the J. Ross Robertson Cup, is still named in his honour. He was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1947.\n\nRobertson was also one of Toronto's great historians and his home was filled with thousands of books and pictures of early Toronto. In his will, Mr. Robertson left to the citizens of Toronto his extensive collection of historical maps and paintings. He also helped fund The Hospital for Sick Children.\n\nIn 1881, Robertsons daughter Helen and niece Gracie died of scarlet fever on the same day. As a result, his wife Maria Robertson and his wife were profoundly affected by the death of Goldie and as soon as Mrs. Robertson recovered from her grief she began working as a volunteer at a new hospital which had been started by Elizabeth McMaster and a group of ladies. One day, Maria persuaded her husband to visit the hospital. Robertson was appalled at what he saw. Because the hospital had little money, the children were sleeping on torn mattresses in rooms so dilapidated they couldn't be scrubbed clean. The next day, Robertson send a cartload of beds and bedding and began a new career that would dominate the rest of his life. \n\nIn 1883, Robertson, at his own expense, build The Lakeside Home for Little Children, on Toronto Island. The Lakeside Home was a convalescent hospital usually occupied from June 1 to September 30. The Lakeside Home was demolished in a fire in 1915 and temporary buildings were used until 1928. In 1921, John Ross Robertson Public School donated $100 to Lakeside Home to maintain a cot. It was common practice for schools to donate money to maintain the cots on an annual basis. \n\nRealizing the desperate need for a larger hospital for children in the city, Robertson embarked on an extensive tour of children's hospitals in Europe and the United States. He wanted the hospital for sick children in Toronto to become one of the finest institutions of its kind in the world. Finally, Mr. Robertson saw his ideal - the recently opened hospital for sick children in Glasgow, Scotland. He asked the Scottish architect who had drawn up the plans of the hospital to draft blueprints for the proposed hospital in Toronto and placed these plans in the hands of Toronto Architects Darling and Curry. The new building became a reality and on June 10, 1889, Mr. Robertson's seven-year-old son turned over the first sod. The building was on College Street between LaPlante Avenue and Elizabeth Street.\n\nRobertson raised money for the new hospital through publicity in his newspaper by gaining support of influential citizens in the city and with the aid of a $20,000 grant from Toronto Council.\n\nWhen Robertson first heard of pasteurized milk in the early 1900s, he sent his sister off to New York City to learn the new process. The hospital was provided with a fully equipped plant to provide pasteurized milk for the babies in the in and outpatient departments with the goal of reducing the infantile death rate. If the families were unable to afford the milk, it would be provided for them. To make sure the bottles would be returned and not kept for flower vases or any other purposes, they made rounded bottom bottles, which could not stand, on a flat surface.\n\nIn 1902, Robertson was appointed Grand Junior Warden of England. He also became president of the inaugural Canadian Copyright Association. A few years later, he refused Knighthood honour and chose to remain a companion.\n\nRobertson became Chairman of the Hospital in 1891 and remained Chairman until he died in 1918. In 1951, the hospital moved to its present building on University Avenue. \n\nHe bequeathed his considerable book collection to the Toronto Public Library, founded a children's home, and left a large annuity to the Toronto Hospital for Sick Children. The John Ross Robertson Public School, an elementary school of the Toronto District School Board is named after Robertson, and is located at 130 Glengrove Avenue West in Toronto.. Construction of the school started shortly after his death. \n\nGeneral\n\nSpecific\n"}

One of five campuses in the University of Minnesota System, UMN Crookston had a fall 2018 enrollment of 1,834 undergraduate students. Students come from 20 countries and 40 states.\n\nLocated on the northern edge of Crookston, Minnesota, off U.S. Highway 2, the campus ( including research plots of the Northwest Research and Outreach Center) is situated in the Red River Valley, the center of a large agricultural region. The region is the transition point from the forested areas of the east to the great plains of the Dakotas.\n\nThe University of Minnesota Crookston uses the marketing slogan \"Small Campus. Big Degree,\" meant to highlight the small-campus environment and a degree offered by the University of Minnesota System degree.\n\nIn 1895, the Minnesota legislature appropriated $30,000 to construct experimental research farms at Morris and Crookston. The Great Northern Railway, under the guidance of James J. Hill, donated , and the Northwest Experiment Station was established.\n\nIn 1905, the Minnesota legislature appropriated $15,000 to establish the Northwest School of Agriculture (NWSA), a regional residential agricultural high school. Affiliated with the University of Minnesota, the school provided training in \"the technical and practical business of agriculture and in the art of homemaking.\" The school year began in October and ended in March to accommodate farm students. In 1906, the Northwest School of Agriculture officially opened.\n\nIn 1963, the University of Minnesota Bureau of Field Studies began examining the need for a two-year institution of higher education at the NWSA and, in the fall of 1966, the University of Minnesota Technical Institute, a two-year (associate) degree granting institution, opened its doors to the first incoming class of 187 students.\n\nFor two years the NWSA and the Technical Institute shared the campus. In the spring of 1968 a torch was passed—figuratively and literally—from the 60th and final graduating class of the NWSA to the first graduating class of the Technical Institute, now an official coordinate campus of the University of Minnesota. In all, 5,433 students completed their high school education at the NWSA. Later in 1968 the name of the campus was changed from the University of Minnesota Technical Institute to the University of Minnesota Technical College.\n\nBy 1977, the University of Minnesota Technical College had nearly 1,000 students taking classes in a range of degree options in the areas of agriculture; business; home and family services; and hotel, restaurant and institutional management. In 1988, the name was changed to the University of Minnesota Crookston.\n\nIn 1993, the University of Minnesota Crookston became a baccalaureate degree granting institution. That same year, the university launched its \"Laptop U\" initiative, providing laptop computers to all students and faculty. It is recognized as one of the first programs of its kind in the United States. Over the next few years, more than 100 colleges and universities from across the U.S. and Canada visited the campus to learn more about this innovation. Some of these adopted programs modeled closely after the one at UMN Crookston.\n\n\nThe campus is located on the northern edge of the city of Crookston. Including the research plots for the Northwest Research and Outreach Center gives a total. The campus itself includes fine specimens of numerous tree species, as well as flower gardens bordering a spacious mall. Less than a mile away lies a natural history area that contains a rare fragment of virgin prairie land with native grasses.\n\nFacilities built or renovated within the last 20 years include a student wellness center (2016), three new residence halls (2006, 2009, 2013), an immersive computer visualization and informatics lab (2010), various biology and chemistry labs (2010 and 2012), the centrally located Sargeant Student Center (2005), renovated Kiehle Building (2002), an indoor animal science facility with an equine arena and stables (1993 with addition in 1998), a recreational and athletic complex, a horticulture complex (1997), an early childhood education center (1999), and a controlled environmental laboratory facility (1998).\n\nIn July 2016 construction was completed on a $15 million wellness center adjacent to the current UMN Crookston Sports Center. Intended to offer students opportunities to engage in many activities involved with wellness, this new facility features a two-court gymnasium, a suspended walking and running track, a multipurpose room with fitness-on-demand equipment, a classroom, and areas with both cardio and strength training machines.\n\nIn addition to facilities dedicated to its undergraduate educational mission, the Crookston campus is home to a variety of partner organizations and agencies, most of which are affiliated with the University of Minnesota system:\n\n\nAs of January 2016, the University of Minnesota Crookston offered 34 undergraduate degree programs (majors), 39 areas of concentration, and 22 minors through four academic departments: Agriculture and Natural Resources; Business; Liberal Arts and Education; and Math, Science and Technology. Since 2004 the school has gained approval from the University of Minnesota Board of Regents to offer additional majors in fourteen additional subjects.\n\nAs of spring semester 2019, sixteen degree programs are offered entirely online (as well as on-campus). In January 2011, the New Century Learning Consortium (NCLC), founded at the University of Illinois at Springfield, added the University of Minnesota Crookston as its 10th member. The NCLC is designed to assist universities in implementing high quality, large-scale online and blended learning programs.\n\nIn February 2016, the University of Minnesota Crookston received reaffirmation of accreditation from the Higher Learning Commission. UMN Crookston uses the HLC's Academic Quality Improvement Program (AQIP) as its assessment process for accreditation.\n\nThe University of Minnesota Crookston Golden Eagles compete in NCAA Division II athletics in the Northern Sun Intercollegiate Conference (NSIC). The mascot is a golden eagle named \"Regal\". UMN Crookston offers the following sports:\n\n\nThe University of Minnesota Crookston is governed by policies established by the University of Minnesota Board of Regents. The president of the University of Minnesota provides oversight to the chancellor at the UMN Crookston. The vice chancellor for academic affairs oversees the four academic departments with leadership in each area provided by a department head. The associate vice chancellor for student affairs and enrollment management oversees most student support units. For more detail, review the organizational chart.\n\nThere are approximately 40 student clubs and organizations for students to join.\n\nThe Crookston Student Association (CSA) is the student governing body and serves as a conduit for student concerns to administration. The Crookston Student Association Executive Board meets weekly with its faculty and staff advisors to act on student concerns, plan campus events and represent the voice of the student across the campus and system wide. The CSA President serves as the Student Body President. The 2019-2020 CSA President is Gregory A Johnson.\n\n"}

He received his law degree from the University of California, Hastings College of the Law (1965). After being elected to the Iowa Legislature (1968), he lost a race for Congress in 1970, then won in 1972 and was re-elected in 1974. He made several unsuccessful U.S. Senate attempts in the 1980s. In 2001, he was convicted of 31 charges of felony fraud, and served five years in federal prison.\n\nIn 2010, he became father-in-law to Chelsea Clinton, the daughter of Hillary and Bill Clinton.\n\nMezvinsky grew up in Ames, Iowa, the son of Jewish grocery store owner Abe Mezvinsky. His father was born in Russia and his mother in Poland. He was an all-state football end and member of the Ames High School state championship basketball and track teams of 1955.\n\nMezvinsky attended the University of Iowa, graduating in 1960. He went on to earn a masters in political science from the University of California, Berkeley in 1963, and a J.D. from the University of California, Hastings College of Law in 1965. He returned briefly to Iowa to practice law, but quickly began a political career. In 1965, he worked for former Rep. Neal Smith in Washington on lobbyist disclosure and ethics bills. He was elected to the Iowa Legislature in 1968, where he attracted publicity as a consumers' advocate. He lost a 1970 campaign to unseat Republican Congressman Fred Schwengel in Iowa's 1st congressional district by only 765 votes (out of over 120,000 cast). After reapportionment improved his chances, Mezvinsky won a 1972 rematch.\n\nDuring his first term in Congress, he sat on the House Judiciary Committee and voted for the impeachment of President Richard Nixon for his activities in the Watergate scandal. He was one of nine Democratic members of the committee who voted for all five articles of impeachment drafted against Nixon; three were reported to the House, while two failed.\n\nAlthough Mezvinsky defeated Davenport businessman Jim Leach in 1974 in the immediate aftermath of the impeachment hearings, Leach defeated him two years later, in 1976. Six months into his first term in Congress, Mezvinsky separated from his wife of ten years Myra Shulman; they were divorced two weeks after his 1974 re-election. During his final term he married Marjorie Margolies, a television journalist. After his 1976 defeat, they relocated to suburban Philadelphia. After serving in Congress, Mezvinsky was United States Ambassador to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights from 1977-79.\n\nMezvinsky unsuccessfully sought the Democratic nomination for the United States Senate seat held by retiring incumbent Republican Richard Schweiker in 1980, but lost to former Pittsburgh Mayor Pete Flaherty. Flaherty lost the general election by a narrow margin to Republican, later Democrat Arlen Specter, who went on to serve five terms in the Senate.\n\nHe became chairman of the Pennsylvania Democratic Party, and made a run for state attorney general in 1988. He won the Democratic primary, but lost to Republican Ernie Preate in the general election. He also unsuccessfully sought the Democratic nomination for lieutenant governor in 1990, losing to incumbent Mark Singel.\n\nIn March 2001, Mezvinsky was indicted and later pleaded guilty to 31 of 69 felony charges of bank fraud, mail fraud, and wire fraud. Mezvinsky, who had been working as an attorney at the time, was funneling embezzled and fraudulently obtained money to West African con men after falling victim to an online advance-fee scam. In the waning days of the Clinton presidency, before the indictment was handed down, Mezvinsky's wife wrote personally to President Clinton requesting a pardon for her husband. Clinton declined. Nearly $10 million was involved in the crimes. Shortly after Mezvinsky's indictment, he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, but the judge at his trial disallowed a mental illness defense.\n\nHe entered prison in February 2003, and served his time at Federal Prison Camp, Eglin. Mezvinsky, Federal Bureau of Prisons # 55040-066, was released in April 2008, after 5 years. He remained on federal probation until 2011, and still owed $9.4 million in restitution to his victims.\n\nFrom 1993-95, Mezvinsky's wife Marjorie Margolies served a term in Congress. Together, they raised eleven children, three of whom were adopted. In 1998, she was the Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor of Pennsylvania. In 2000, she was running for the Democratic nomination for the U.S. Senate when her husband's business problems forced them to file for bankruptcy and forced her abrupt withdrawal. They divorced several years later.\n\nMezvinsky and his wife Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky became close to U.S. President Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton in the 1990s, both families met when they attended the annual Renaissance Weekend gathering in South Carolina. President Clinton was reportedly indebted to Margolies-Mezvinsky since she provided the crucial vote in the House of Representatives to pass his budget and tax bill, despite being \"one of very few Democrats who represented a district with more constituents who'd get tax hikes than tax cuts, and in her campaign she'd promised not to vote for any tax increases\", which cost her re-election in 1994. The Mezvinskys were frequent guests at White House state dinners during the Clinton administration.\n\nIn 2010 Mezvinsky's son, Marc Mezvinsky, married Chelsea Clinton, daughter of Bill and Hillary.\n\n\n"}

Previously known as the Television Corporation of the Pontifical Catholic University of Valparaíso or UCV Televisión, it was the oldest television station in the country and the only regional network outside of Santiago that had nationwide coverage. It started broadcasting on an experimental level in the Pontifical University of Valparaíso's buildings in 1957 and was officially launched in August 1959. In 2017, it moved its offices to the Agua Santa district in Viña del Mar.\n\nOn 21 November 2018 at 5:00pm, the channel was rebranded as \"TV+\" and premiered a new graphical package. In late-November, the digital-terrestrial-television subchannel UCV 3 (controlled by the PCUV) would be rebranded as UCV Televisión, broadcasting from its original studios in Viña del Mar.\n\nIn recent years, the television station's audience share started to plummet. In 2016, the Pontifical Catholic University of Valparaíso started to search a business partner to revamp the network. On 29 December, the University announced that it sold the channel to the TV enterprise «TV+ SpA», composed of PUCV Multipedios SpA, a media company owned by the University with 10% of the network's share, and Media 23 SpA — a joint venture between GCO Entretención, Disney's official licensed commercial partner in the country, and Contempora, owned by Jesús Diez González, a Chilean businessman owner of the \"TurBus\" transportation business and manager of the agricultural distributor Covepal— which holds the remaining 90% of the station's share.\n\nIn 5 October 1957, the first television broadcast in Chile was outcarried by a group of researchers from the Electronics Faculty of the Pontifical Catholic University of Valparaíso. The broadcast event was the inauguration of a new campus dedicated to laboratories and classrooms. The event was attended by the then-President of Chile, Carlos Ibáñez del Campo, government ministers and other authorities of the State during his administration.\n\nThis event was considered to be the first true scheduled television broadcast as the television network also aired a newscast following the event. The TV station was officially launched in 22 August 1959 on VHF channel 8 of Valparaíso. Its first aired television show was \"El hombre ante el universo\" (\"The man in the face of the universe\"), a cultural programme. From 1957 to 1960, UCV TV used to broadcast from 4:00pm to 10:00pm local time. However, from 1968 to 1970, the station increased its airtime, ranging from 3:00pm to 12:00am midnight. In 1969, the network moved its frequency to VHF channel 4 of Valparaíso.\n\nIn 1971, UCV TV built a relay transmitter in La Serena, which was the first city outside the Valparaíso Region that could receive UCV TV. Three years later, in 1974, the network built another relay transmitter in the capital, Santiago. In 1975, the TV channel purchased portable camcorders that made it easier for the network to record in the streets as most television stations at the time were still using cinema-centred camera equipment. In 1978, UCV TV started colour broadcasts along with Santiago's channel 13, the Television Corporation of the Catholic University of Chile (UCTV for short) and could adapt itself to these new changes in just three months. In that same year, it broadcast the first Teletón event as the \"Red UCV Televisión\", that could be identified by the channel numbers 4, 5 and 8, which represented the frequencies in which the network was broadcasting in Valparaíso, Santiago and La Serena, respectively. The affiliate in La Serena, known as \"Canal 8 UCV Televisión\", not only aired UCV TV programmes, but also imported programming from Santiago's channel 13. An affiliate started in Puerto Montt in 1990, initially on channel 7 before moving to channel 8 in 1998, by then it became a relayer.\n\nThe channel launched its own HD feed in 25 June 2010, back when it was still named UCV Televisión (the feed was distributed as UCV TV HD) with the broadcast of the football match between Chile and Spain during the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa, in association with TVN. It was launched on the digital terrestrial television platform on virtual channel 29.1 in Greater Valparaíso and virtual channel 5.1 in Greater Santiago.

{"id": "1984948", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1984948", "title": "Nationalist Movement Party", "text": "Nationalist Movement Party\n\nThe Nationalist Movement Party (alternatively translated as Nationalist Action Party; , MHP) is a Turkish far-right \nultraconservative political party that adheres to Turkish ultranationalism and Euroscepticism.\n\nThe party was formed in 1969 by former colonel Alparslan Türkeş, who had become leader of the Republican Villagers Nation Party (CKMP) in 1965. The party mainly followed a Pan-Turkist and nationalist political agenda throughout the latter half of the 20th century, but later moderated its views under the leadership of Devlet Bahçeli, who took over after Türkeş's death in 1997. The party's youth wing is the Gray Wolves (\"Bozkurtlar\") organization, which is also known as the \"Nationalist Hearths\" (\"Ülkü Ocakları\"). Türkeş, who is widely revered by Turkish nationalists as the founder of the idealist movement, is commonly referred to as \"Chieftain\" (\"Başbuğ\") by his supporters.\n\nAlparslan Türkeş founded the party after criticizing the Republican People's Party (CHP) for moving too far away from the nationalist principles of their founder Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, claiming that he would not have founded the MHP had the CHP not deviated from Atatürk's ideology. Although Türkeş failed to win any elections, the MHP won enough seats in the 1973 and 1977 general election to take part in two coalition governments led by Justice Party (AP) leader Süleyman Demirel. Türkeş served as the Deputy Prime Minister of Turkey between 1975 and 1977 in what was referred to as the First Nationalist Front government and again between 1977 and 1978 in the Second Nationalist Front. After Türkeş's death and the election of Devlet Bahçeli as his successor, the party moderated its views and adopted a more mainstream nationalist agenda. The party under Bahçeli's leadership won 18% of the vote and 129 seats in the 1999 general election, its best ever result, coming second only to the Democratic Left Party (DSP). Bahçeli subsequently became Deputy Prime Minister after entering a coalition with the DSP and the Motherland Party (ANAP), though his calls for an early election resulted in the government's collapse in 2002. In the 2002 general election, the MHP fell below the 10% election threshold and lost all of its parliamentary representation after the newly formed Justice and Development Party (AKP) won a plurality.\n\nSince the 2007 general election, in which the MHP won back its parliamentary representation with 14.27% of the vote and 71 seats, the party has strongly opposed the peace negotiations between the government and Kurdish separatist militants and has been fiercely critical of the governing AKP over government corruption and authoritarianism. Nevertheless, the MHP has often been referred to critics as the \"AKP's lifeline\", having either openly or covertly helped the AKP in situations such as the 2007 presidential election, repealing the headscarf ban and the June–July 2015 parliamentary speaker elections. In the 2011 general election, the party's vote fell to 13% and won 53 seats, though increased to 16.3% and 80 seats in the June 2015 general election. Having consistently maintained third-party status in Parliament since 2007, the MHP halved its parliamentary representation to win 40 seats with 11.9% of the vote in the November 2015 general election, becoming the fourth largest party in Parliament behind the Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP). The MHP supported a 'Yes' vote in the 2017 referendum, and formed the People's Alliance electoral pact with the AKP for the 2018 Turkish general election.\n\nIn 1965, nationalist politician and ex-Colonel Alparslan Türkeş, who had trained in the United States for NATO, founded the Turkish Gladio Special Warfare Department, gained control of the conservative rural Republican Villagers Nation Party (, CKMP). During an Extraordinary Great Congress held at Adana in Turkey on 8–9 February 1969, Türkeş changed the name of the party to the Nationalist Movement Party (MHP).\n\nThe MHP embraced Turkish nationalism, and under the leadership of Türkeş, militias connected to the party were responsible for assassinating numerous left-wing intellectuals and academics, including some Kurds, during the 1970s. The leader of the party's youth wing, known as the Grey Wolves after Turkic mythology, claimed that they had an intelligence organization that was superior to the state's own.\n\nOn the other hand, MHP had links to the \"Aydınlar Ocağı\" (AO; \"Hearth of Intellectuals\"), a right-wing think tank launched in 1970 by established university professors, which served as a connecting link between secular-conservative, nationalist and Islamic rightists, promoting the ideology of Turkish-Islamic synthesis. AO's ideas, which have been compared to those of the French Nouvelle Droite, had a determining influence on MHP's programmes and served to lend the far-right party a more legitimate, respectable appearance.\n\nOn May 27, 1980, the party's deputy leader and former government minister Gün Sazak was assassinated by members of the Marxist–Leninist terrorist group Revolutionary Left ( or \"Dev Sol\") in front of his home.\n\nWhen the Turkish army seized power on September 12, 1980, in a violent \"coup d'état\" led by General Kenan Evren, the party was banned, along with all other active political parties at the time, and many of its leading members were imprisoned. Many party members joined the neoliberal Anavatan Partisi or various Islamist parties. Party member (Agâh Oktay Güner) noted that the party's ideology was in power while its members were in prison.\n\nThe party was reformed in 1983 under the name \"Conservative Party\" (). After 1985, however, the name was changed to the \"Nationalist Task Party\" () then back again to its former name in 1992. In 1993, Muhsin Yazıcıoğlu and five other deputies separated and founded the Great Union Party, which is an Islamist party.\n\nThe MHP's view represents the Nine-Light doctrine, based on Turkish nationalism shaped by Islam. The MHP used to be described as a neo-fascist party linked to extremist and violent militias. Since the 1990s it has, under the leadership of Devlet Bahçeli, gradually moderated its programme, turning from ethnic to cultural nationalism and conservatism and stressing the unitary nature of the Turkish state. Notably, it has moved from strict, Kemalist-style secularism to a more pro-Islamic stance, and has – at least in public statements – accepted the rules of parliamentary democracy. Some scholars doubt the sincerity and credibility of this turn and suspect the party of still pursuing a fascist agenda behind a more moderate and pro-democratic façade. Nevertheless, MHP's mainstream overture has strongly increased its appeal to voters and it has grown to the country's third-strongest party, continuously represented in the National Assembly since 2007 with voter shares well above the 10% threshold.\n\nDue to their ideological differences, the MHP is strongly opposed to any form of dialogue with the left-wing Kurdish nationalist Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP), which Devlet Bahçeli has often opposed by voting against in Parliament. A notable example was in the June–July 2015 parliamentary speaker elections, where the MHP declared that they would not support any candidate and cast blank votes after the HDP announced support for the Republican People's Party (CHP) candidate Deniz Baykal. The MHP also ruled out any prospect of a coalition government that receives support from the HDP after the June 2015 general election resulted in a hung parliament, even rejecting CHP leader Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu's offer of Bahçeli becoming Prime Minister in such a coalition. MHP deputy leader Celal Adan claimed that 'even using our party's name in the same sentence as the HDP will be counted as cruelty by us.'\n\nIn early September 2015, the MHP and the HDP both voted against the new interim election government ministers from taking their oaths of office, causing speculation of whether the MHP was dropping their harsh stance against the HDP. However, Semih Yalçın downplayed any notions of an alliance between the two parties, stating that \"a broken clock will still show the correct time once a day, the HDP can sometimes take a correct decision in Parliament. Showing this as a 'MHP-HDP coalition' is a deliberate diversion.\"\n\nDuring the June 2015 Turkish general election, the MHP announced a new economic manifesto. The MHP promised to improve the situation of Turkey’s working poor by lifting taxes on diesel and fertiliser, raising the net minimum wage to $518, giving a $37 transportation subsidy to every minimum wage worker, and giving those who cannot afford a house an additional $92 per month in rental aid. The MHP said these policies would allow a minimum wage earner living in a big city to earn as much an extra $646 annually.\n\nThe MHP stated that their economic policies would create 700,000 jobs, increase the national income per person to $13.3K, and increase exports to $238 billion while keeping annual growth at 5.2 percent between 2016 and 2019.\n\nIn July 2015, amidst a wave of protests against the Xinjiang conflict, MHP-affiliated \"Ülkücü\" attacked South Korean tourists on Istanbul's Sultanahmet Square. In an interview to Turkish columnist Ahmet Hakan, MHP leader Devlet Bahçeli played the attacks down, stating that \"These are young kids. They may have been provoked. Plus, how are you going to differentiate between Korean and Chinese? They both have slanted eyes. Does it really matter?\" Bahceli's remarks were widely considered racist, and together with a banner reading \"We crave Chinese blood\" at the Ülkücü Istanbul headquarters, the affair caused an uproar in both Turkish and international media.\n\nThe party is headed by Devlet Bahçeli and has 49 deputies, three of them women, in the Grand National Assembly. The party has recently been putting a distance between itself and its history of ultranationalism, at occasion asking its members to keep away from \"ethnic politics\".\n\n\n\n"}

It is considered to be close to the Grey Wolves organization, and is related to the \"Alperen Ocakları\" tendency, which operated a synthesis between cultural nationalism and Islamism, and separated itself from the \"Nationalist Task Party\" (MÇP), which was renamed to Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) in July 1992.\n\nAlthough it is claimed that the founder of the party Muhsin Yazıcıoğlu left the MHP for lack of religious convictions, this should be seen rather as a speculation as Muhsin Yazıcıoğlu rarely blamed the MHP or talked about the separation. The rift between Muhsin Yazıcıoğlu and Alparslan Türkeş actually started after the 1980 Turkish coup d'état. Alparslan Türkeş defended himself in the infamous speech in which he declared \"My opinions and beliefs are of the same as the generals who organized the 1980 Turkish coup d'état, yet I am in prison\" speech during trials after the coup. The ideological separation started then and reached the surface after Alparslan Türkeş dismissed the Ankara headquarters of the MHP after the 1992 MHP Congress. The delegates had elected the candidate supported by Muhsin Yazıcıoğlu rather than the candidate of Alparslan Türkeş environment. Türkeş's dismissal, seen to show an anti-democratic approach, was the final blow to the relationship between the young clique who had suffered during the 1980 coup and were against anything anti-democratic, and the old clique which circled around Alparslan Türkeş and believed in a nationalist-socialistic way of democracy.\n\nThe party has been represented in the Parliament only via electoral coalitions with popular parties. At the 2002 legislative elections, the party won 1.1% of the popular vote and no seats; in the 2007 elections Muhsin Yazıcıoğlu was elected as an independent. In 2009 local elections the BBP's candidate was elected as the new mayor of Sivas.\n\nOn 25 March 2009, the leader of the BBP, Muhsin Yazıcıoğlu, died in a helicopter crash in south-eastern Turkey. A large search and rescue operation was conducted in the mountainous area around Göksun in Kahramanmaraş Province. The helicopter wreckage was found 47 hours after the crash, and all six people on board were found dead. İsmail Güneş, a reporter of the Ihlas News Agency, who was accompanying Yazıcıoğlu, initially survived the crash and placed a desperate call for help just after the crash, and reported a broken leg. By the time the search party located the crash site in the inclement weather, all six aboard, including Güneş, were dead. Yazıcıoğlu had been traveling from Çağlayancerit in Kahramanmaraş Province to Yerköy in Yozgat Province in central Anatolia for another political rally before local elections on 29 March when the chartered helicopter crashed.\n\nA delegation representing the BBP participated in the Gaza Freedom Flotilla on board the ship MV Mavi Marmara in May 2010.\n\nIn 2016, the Alperen threatened to stop the annual gay pride march in Istanbul. Alperen's Istanbul chief, Kursat Mican, stated:\n\nDegenerates will not be allowed to carry out their fantasies on this land...We're not responsible for what will happen after this point ...

However, this term is usually employed in a more narrow sense only to those bacteria and archaea that perform anaerobic respiration and carbon fixation simultaneously through the reductive acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) pathway (also known as the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway). These genuine acetogens are also known as \"homoacetogens\" and they can produce acetyl-CoA (and from that, in most cases, acetate as the end product) from two molecules of carbon dioxide (CO) and four molecules of molecular hydrogen (H). This process is known as acetogenesis, and is different from acetate fermentation, although both occur in the absence of molecular oxygen (O) and produce acetate. Although previously thought that only bacteria are acetogens, some archaea can be considered to be acetogens.\n\nAcetogens are found in a variety of habitats, generally those that are anaerobic (lack oxygen). Acetogens can use a variety of compounds as sources of energy and carbon; the best studied form of acetogenic metabolism involves the use of carbon dioxide as a carbon source and hydrogen as an energy source. Carbon dioxide reduction is carried out by the key enzyme acetyl-CoA synthase. Together with methane-forming archaea, acetogens constitute the last limbs in the anaerobic food web that leads to the production of methane from polymers in the absence of oxygen. Acetogens may represent ancestors of the first bioenergetically active cells in evolution.\n\nAcetogens have diverse metabolic roles, which help them thrive in different environments. One of their metabolic products is acetate which is an important nutrient for the host and its inhabiting microbial community, most seen in termite's guts. Acetogens also serve as \"hydrogen sinks\" in termite's GI tract. Hydrogen gas inhibits biodegradation and acetogens use up these hydrogen gases in the anaerobic environment to favor the biodegradative capacity of the host by reacting hydrogen gas and carbon dioxide to make acetate. Acetogens have the ability to use variety of substrates in an event where another competitor such as a methanogen makes hydrogen gas a limiting substrate. Acetogens can use and convert alcohols, lactates and fatty acids, which are usually restricted to syntrophs, instead of just carbon dioxide and hydrogen. This enables them to take on the roles of important contributors of food chain such as primary fermenters. Acetogens can work together with methanogens, as exemplified by the conversion of carbohydrates by a Methanosarcina barkeri and coculture of A. woodii. The methanogen takes up acetate to favor the acetogen. Sometimes the interspecies transfer of hydrogen gas between A. woodii and an H-consuming methanogen results in hydrogen gas being released from the acetogen instead of going toward acetogenesis by the Wood–Ljungdahl pathway. Acetogens are also one of the contributors to corrosion of steel. Acetobacterium woodii utilize hydrogen gas and CO to make the acetate that is used as carbon source for many of the sulfate-reducing bacteria growing with hydrogen gas and sulfate.\n"}

The British forces retreated and in the power vacuum left behind, considerable inter communal violence erupted between pro-Japanese Buddhist Rakhine and pro-British Muslim villagers. As part of the 'stay-behind' strategy to impede the Japanese advance, the Commander-in-Chief of forces in Delhi, Wavell, established \"V-Force\" which armed Rohingya locals in northern Arakan to create a buffer zone from Japanese invasion when they retreated.\n\nThe period also witnessed violence between groups loyal to the British and Burmese nationalists.\n\nTensions boiling in Arakan before the war erupted during the Japanese invasion of Southeast Asia, and Arakan became the frontline in the conflict. The war resulted in a complete breakdown of civil administration and consequent development of habits of lawlessness exacerbated by the availability of modern arms. The Japanese advance triggered an inter-communal conflict between Muslims and Buddhists. The Muslims fled towards British-controlled Muslim-dominated northern Arakan from Japanese-controlled Buddhist-majority areas, which stimulated a genocide of Rakhine Buddhists in British-controlled areas, particularly around Maungdaw. Failure of British counter-offensive attempted from December 1942 to April 1943 resulted in the abandonment of even more of the Muslim population as well as increase in inter-communal violence.\n\nMoshe Yegar, a research fellow at Truman Institute, Hebrew University of Jerusalem noted that hostility had developed between the Muslims and the Buddhists who had brought about a similar hostility in other parts of Burma. This tension was let loose with the retreat of the British. With the approach of Japanese into Arakan, the Buddhists instigated cruel measures against the Muslims. Thousands, though the exact number is unknown, fled from Buddhist-majority regions to eastern Bengal and northern Arakan with many being killed or dying of starvation. The Muslims in response conducted retaliatory raids from British-controlled areas, massacring scores of Buddhists and causing many Buddhists to flee to southern Arakan.\n\nAye Chan, a historian at Kanda University in Japan, has written that as a consequence of acquiring arms from the Allies during World War II, Rohingyas tried to destroy the collaborationist Arakanese villages instead of resisting the Japanese. Chan agrees that hundreds of Muslims fled to northern Arakan though states that the accounts of atrocities on them were exaggerated. The British Army's liaison officer Anthony Irwin in contrast praised the role of the V Force.\n\nMuslims from Northern Rakhine State tortured, raped, and killed more than 20,000 Arakanese, including the Deputy Commissioner U Oo Kyaw Khaing. In return the Buddhist also killed a large number of Rohingya Muslims. The total casualty of both parties in that conflict is not certain and no concrete official reference can be found.\n\nDefeated, 50,000 Arakanese eventually fled to the Dinaspur, Chittagong Division of Bangladesh after repeated massacres by the Rohingya and Japanese forces.\n\nImperial Japanese forces slaughtered, raped, and tortured Rohingya Muslims and Indian Muslims. They expelled tens of thousands of Rohingya into Bengal in British India. The Japanese committed countless acts of rape, murder and torture against thousands of Rohingyas. During this period, some 22,000 Rohingyas are believed to have crossed the border into Bengal, then part of British India, to escape the violence. Defeated, 40,000 Rohingyas eventually fled to Chittagong after repeated massacres by the Burmese and Japanese forces.\n\nBritish report stated, that after massacres \"the area then occupied by us was almost entirely Mussulman Country\".\n\n\n"}

A post-punk album with coming-of-age themes, \"Let It Be\" was recorded by the band after they had grown tired of playing loud and fast exclusively as on their 1983 \"Hootenanny\" album; the group decided to write songs that were, according to vocalist Paul Westerberg, \"a little more sincere.\"\n\n\"Let It Be\" was well received by music critics and later ranked among the greatest albums of the 1980s by AllMusic and \"Rolling Stone\" magazine. Now considered a classic, \"Let It Be\" is frequently included on professional lists of the all-time best rock albums, being ranked number 241 on \"Rolling Stone\"s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. The album was remastered and reissued in 2008, with six additional tracks.\n\nThe Replacements started their career as a punk rock band but had gradually grown beyond the straightforward hardcore of initial albums like \"Stink\". Westerberg recalls that \"playing that kind of noisy, fake hardcore rock was getting us nowhere, and it wasn't a lot of fun. This was the first time I had songs that we arranged, rather than just banging out riffs and giving them titles.\" By 1983, the band would sometimes perform a set of cover songs intended to antagonize whoever was in the audience. Westerberg explained that the punks who made up their audience \"thought that's what they were supposed to be standing for, like 'Anybody does what they want' and 'There are no rules' [...] But there \"were\" rules and you \"couldn't\" do that, and you \"had\" to be fast, and you \"had\" to wear black, and you \"couldn't\" wear a plaid shirt with flares ... So we'd play the DeFranco Family, that kind of shit, just to piss 'em off.\"\n\nPeter Buck of R.E.M. was originally rumored to produce the album. Buck later confirmed that the band did consider him as a possible producer, but when they met Buck in Athens, Georgia, the band did not have enough material. Buck did manage to contribute to the album in a limited capacity; he said, \"I was kind of there for pre-production stuff, did one solo, gave 'em some ideas.\"\n\n\"Let It Be\" is a post-punk album. Westerberg's lyrics feature themes of self-consciousness and rejection as felt by awkward youths, and deal with topics such as generational discontent on \"Unsatisfied\", uncontrollable arousal on \"Gary's Got a Boner\", and amateurish sexuality on \"Sixteen Blue\". According to music critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine, the album's coming-of-age theme is aligned between adolescence and adulthood, and unlike many other adolescent-themed post-punk records, \"Let It Be\" remains less on the subject of angst and incorporates humor and more varied music.\n\nThe cover of \"Let It Be\" is a photograph of the band sitting on the roof of Bob and Tommy Stinson's mother's house taken by Daniel Corrigan. Michael Azerrad stated that the cover was a \"great little piece of mythmaking,\" showcasing each bandmember's personality via how they appear in the photograph. The album's title is a reference to the 1970 album \"Let It Be\" by The Beatles; the reference was intended as a joke on the Replacements' manager, Peter Jesperson, who was a huge Beatles fan. Westerberg has stated the name was \"our way of saying that nothing is sacred, that the Beatles were just a fine rock & roll band. We were seriously gonna call the next record \"Let It Bleed\".\"\n\nReviewing for \"The Village Voice\" in 1984, music critic Robert Christgau said that the band has matured by incorporating melody in their music and felt that they succeed by writing about their likes and dislikes rather than adhering to garage rock principles. Debby Miller of \"Rolling Stone\" magazine called it a \"brilliant rock & roll album\" and wrote that, instead of the rugged, up-tempo rock of the band's first two albums, \"Let It Be\" has \"an amazing range\" of musical ideas. Bruce Pavitt, writing in \"The Rocket\", called the album \"mature, diverse rock that could well shoot these regional boys into the national mainstream.\" \"Let It Be\" was voted the fourth best album of the year in \"The Village Voice\"s annual Pazz & Jop critics' poll for 1984. Christgau, the poll's creator, ranked it second best on his own list, and in a decade-end list for the newspaper, named it the tenth best album of the 1980s. He later said that, along with X's 1981 album \"Wild Gift\", \"Let It Be\" represented the peak of American indie rock.\n\nIn a retrospective review, eMusic's Karen Schoemer said that \"Let It Be\" is \"as classic as rock & roll could be\" and cited it as a cornerstone album of alternative rock, along with R.E.M.'s \"Murmur\", the Pixies' \"Surfer Rosa\", and Sonic Youth's \"Daydream Nation\". Eric Boehlert of \"Salon\" called it a \"post-punk classic\". Singer-songwriter Colin Meloy wrote of \"Let It Be\" in an edition of the 33⅓ series dedicated to the album: \"I listened to \"Let It Be\" endlessly. The record seemed to encapsulate perfectly all of the feelings that were churning inside me [...] Paul Westerberg's weary voice sounded from my boombox and I trembled to think that here I was, thirteen and the 'hardest age' was still three years in the making.\" In a 2005 review, \"Rolling Stone\"s Christian Hoard wrote that the Replacements \"had no use for the principles or oblique artiness\" of contemporary indie rock bands such as Sonic Youth and Hüsker Dü, and concluded that \"few albums so brilliantly evoke the travails of growing up, and even fewer have so perfectly captured a young band in all its ragged glory.\"\n\n\"Let It Be\" has frequently been included on professional lists of the all-time best rock albums. In 2003, \"Rolling Stone\" ranked it at number 239 on its list of the 500 greatest albums of all time and called it \"a post-punk masterpiece\", and ranked at 241 in a 2012 revised list. In 1989, the magazine had also rated it at #15 on its list of 100 best albums of the '80s. In the 1999 miniseries \"VH1's 100 Greatest Albums of Rock and Roll,\" VH1 ranked \"Let It Be\" #79. \"Pitchfork\" rated the album at #29 on their 100 Best Albums of the 1980s. \"Spin\" ranked it #12 on their list of the 25 Greatest albums of all time. \"Slant Magazine\" listed the album at #39 on its list of \"Best Albums of the 1980s\". The opening track of the album, \"I Will Dare\" has been inducted in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The fish are flat, resembling pancakes with a maximum size of ca. 10 cm. They feed on small snails, clams, crustaceans, scallops, worms, and occasionally on small fishes. Their eggs and larvae are pelagic and develop upon reaching the bottom.\n\nTwo new species of \"Halieutichthys\" batfish were discovered in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010, in the region directly affected by the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. The two species were named \"Halieutichthys intermedius\" and \"Halieutichthys bispinosus\".\n\n"}
{"id": "1984987", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1984987", "title": "Tocopilla", "text": "Tocopilla\n\nTocopilla is a city and commune in the Antofagasta Region, in the north of Chile. It is the capital of the province that bears the same name.\n\nEvery year Tocopilla celebrates its anniversary on 29 September with a big show the day before, which includes a parade down in the main street of the city, food and a fireworks display at midnight.\n\nThe city is divided into two main parts consisting of the central city and smaller portion known as \"La Villa Sur\" (in which the more luxurious houses are located). The two parts are divided by the thermoelectric power plant and a large saltpeter processing and shipping plant, with the coastal highway connecting the two portions.\nThe northern portion of Tocopilla is home of the municipal buildings, the central square and many stores and shops. The steep gradient of the city from beach to vertical hillside is covered in houses and apartments crammed together to save space. A large artificial beach called \"Covadonga\" and a small artificial beach called \"Caleta Boy\" are the main attractions during summer months and serve as a focus away from the heat of the Atacama. On the north side of the city, there is a black sandy beach called \"El Panteón\".\nTocopilla is the birthplace of artist Alejandro Jodorowsky and footballer Alexis Sánchez.\n\nTocopilla means \"the devil's corner\".\n\nOn 14 November 2007, a magnitude 7.7 earthquake occurred east-southeast of Tocopilla, followed by aftershocks of magnitude up to 6.8. As a consequence, 1,200 homes were destroyed in Tocopilla, leaving 4,000 of its 27,000 inhabitants homeless. There were two fatalities, and at least 115 were injured.\n\nAccording to the 2002 census of the National Statistics Institute, Tocopilla had 23,986 inhabitants (12,050 men and 11,936 women). Of these, 23,352 (97.4%) lived in urban areas and 634 (2.6%) in rural areas. The population fell by 4.0% (999 persons) between the 1992 and 2002 censuses.\n\nAs a commune, Tocopilla is a third-level administrative division of Chile administered by a municipal council, headed by an alcalde who is directly elected every four years. The 2013-2016 alcalde is Fernando San Román Bascuñán (Ind./PRO).\n\nWithin the electoral divisions of Chile, Tocopilla is represented in the Chamber of Deputies by Mr. Marcos Espinosa (PRSD) and Mr. Felipe Ward (UDI) as part of the 3rd electoral district, (together with María Elena, Calama, Ollagüe and San Pedro de Atacama). The commune is represented in the Senate by Mr. Pedro Araya Guerrero(Ind.) and Mr.Alejandro Guillier(Ind.) as part of the 2nd senatorial constituency (Antofagasta Region).\n\nThe city has one association football team called Deportes Tocopilla who currently play in Tercera B (Chile).\n\nInter Milan forward Alexis Sánchez was also born here.\n\nThis city generates electricity for the entire region and is therefore known as \"the city of energy\". When saltpeter exportation in Chile was at its highest point, Tocopilla was especially significant as an export point. Nowadays, even when the saltpeter is not so profitable, Tocopilla is still home of companies focused on its extraction.\n\nIts position along the coast allows it to have an active fishing activity, that along with the mining activity are the main resources. It is a fishing port, with fishmeal and canned fish factories. Through its port the copper from Chuquicamata and saltpeter from El Toco are exported. Tocopilla has metallurgic, chemical and nitrate treatment industries, along with the power plant. Due to these activities, Tocopilla is a dormitory city, since many people work outside the city.\n\nTwo other important sports are volleyball, with relative success at school and federated level, and association football with a number of players that have gone to bigger clubs, such as Alexis Sánchez.\n\n\"The Dance of Reality\", a 2013 Chilean-French film by Alejandro Jodorowsky, was filmed in Tocopilla.\n\nThe city is mentioned in the Hank Snow and Johnny Cash song \"I've Been Everywhere\"\n\n"}

Traditionally, minibikes have a four-stroke, horizontal crankshaft engine, single or two-speed Centrifugal clutch transmission with chain final drive, 4\" or 6\" wheels and a low frame/seat height with elevated handlebars. Commercially available minibikes are usually equip with engines commonly found elsewhere on utilitarian equipment.\n\nWhile the minibike had precursors in machines such as the Doodle Bug and Cushman Scooters, which share smaller wheels, tubular-steel frames and air-cooled, single-cylinder engines, those vehicles had larger seat heights and lighting that allow them to be registered for road use as scooters. In the 1950s, minibikes were hand-made by enthusiasts. Antidotally, these were first popularly used as pit bikes, for drag racers to travel in the staging-areas during races. One of these \"Pit bikes\" was received by brothers Ray, Larry and Regis Michrina in early 1959 from local car dealer and racer Troy Ruttman. \n\nThe Michrina Brothers would create the first commercial minibikes by drawing inspiration from this \"Pit Bike\", delivering 3 prototypes to Troy Ruttman to sell through his dealership. The Michrina brothers are credited with creating the \"Minibike\", but failed to patent the design or trademark the term when founding their Lil Indian brand in 1959. . Lil Indian would go on to manufacture tens-of-thousands of Minibikes in their 40+ years. From the mid 1960's into the 1970's, the popularity of said machines would see over a hundred manufacturers attempt to market machines, an inexpensive venture due to the absence of patents. So popular and simple was the design, the June of 1967 Popular Mechanics magazine included an article with plans that could be made with proper tools and supplies.\n\nAs the market for minibikes developed, a variety of cottage and major industries offered models, including Arctic Cat, Rupp, Taco, Heath, Gilson, and Fox. Traditional motorcycle manufacturers also released models inspired by aspects of minibikes, most famously Honda with the Z50A, though this style is affectionately known as a Monkey Bike, a slang-term due to its street-legal demographic requiring a seminarian riding position. Sales peaked in the 1973, with 140,000 units between manufacturers.. By 1976 the bubble had burst and less than ten manufactures continued to make Mini Bikes. Popularity declined steadily, but leveled off in the early 1990's. Currently, machines can still be found at various retailers for less than $600.\n\nWhile US laws vary by state, Minibikes are unlawful for use on public through-ways due to lack of safety equipment, lights, and their diminutive size causing visibility issues.. In 1977, the CPSC was unsuccessfully lobbied to add federal regulation to Minibikes, so while Minibikes cannot be operated on Public Roads, they can operate in areas legal for use of other recreational vehicles, provided they have the proper equipment utilized at the time of sale, most notably a spark arrestor for the exhaust.In Canada, Minibikes do not meet Federal safety standards for use on public roads.In the UK, it is not legal for Minibikes to be used on public roads or land. Further, it is not legal to use Minibikes on property in proximity to a population if cited for Noise Pollution.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1985003", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1985003", "title": "Wet feet, dry feet policy", "text": "Wet feet, dry feet policy\n\nThe wet feet, dry feet policy or wet foot, dry foot policy was the name given to a former interpretation of the 1995 revision of the application of the Cuban Adjustment Act of 1966 that essentially says that anyone who emigrated from Cuba and entered the United States would be allowed to pursue residency a year later. Prior to 1995, the U.S. government allowed all Cubans who reached U.S. territorial waters to remain in the U.S. After talks with the Cuban government, the Bill Clinton administration came to an agreement with Cuba that it would stop admitting people intercepted in U.S. waters. For two decades thereafter, any Cuban caught on the waters between the two nations (with \"wet feet\") would summarily be returned to Cuba or sent to a third country, while one who made it to shore (\"dry feet\") got a chance to remain in the United States, and later would qualify for expedited \"legal permanent resident\" status in accordance with the 1966 Act and eventually U.S. citizenship. In January 2017, Barack Obama announced the immediate end of the policy the Thursday before his term expired.\n\nBetween 1960 and 1980, hundreds of thousands of Cubans entered the United States under the Attorney General's parole authority, many of them arriving by boat. In 1980, a mass migration of asylum seekers—known as the Mariel boatlift—brought approximately 125,000 Cubans (and 25,000 Haitians) to South Florida over a six-month period. After declining for several years, Cuban \"boat people\" steadily rose from a few hundred in 1989 to a few thousand in 1993. After Castro made threatening speeches in 1994, riots ensued in Havana, and the Cuban exodus by boat escalated. The number of Cubans intercepted by the U.S. Coast Guard or the U.S. Border Patrol reached a post-Mariel high of 37,191 in 1994.\n\nUntil 1995, the United States generally had not repatriated Cubans (except certain criminal aliens on a negotiated list) under a policy established when the government became Communist within two years of the 1959 Cuban Revolution. Not only has the United States been reluctant to repatriate people to Cuba, but also the Cuban government typically has also refused to accept Cuban migrants who are excludable under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) (Cubans who have been convicted of crimes in the United States pose complex problems, as Cuba is among a handful of nations that does not generally accept the return of criminal aliens.)\n\n\"Normalizing\" migration between the two nations was the stated purpose of the migration agreement enacted by the Clinton administration on September 9, 1994, when the U.S. policy toward Cuban migrants was altered significantly. The plan's objectives of safe, legal, and orderly immigration relied on six points.\n\n\nIt became apparent that the 20,000 minimum level per year could not be met through the INA preference system or the refugee provisions because of the eligibility criteria. In addition to Cubans who may qualify to immigrate through the INA preference system and who may qualify as refugees, the United States decided to use other authority in the law (i.e., parole), to allow Cubans to come to the United States and become legal permanent residents through the Cuban Adjustment Act. Specifically, a \"visa lottery\" program was established to randomly select who, among the many Cubans seeking to migrate, receives a visa.\n\nAs part of the effort to enact this agreement, Operations Safe Haven and Safe Passage were executed to alleviate overcrowding at Guantanamo Bay by using temporary camps in Panama.\n\nOn May 2, 1995, the Clinton administration announced a further agreement with Cuba that resolved the dilemma of the approximately 33,000 Cubans then encamped at Guantanamo. This new agreement, which came at the time of year when boat people traditionally begin their journeys, had two new points. Foremost, the United States allowed most of the Cubans detained at Guantanamo to come to the United States through the humanitarian parole provisions of the INA (Guantanamo).\n\nCuba agreed to credit some of these admissions toward the minimum 20,000 LPRs per year from Cuba, with 5,000 charged annually over three years. Secondly, rather than placing Cubans intercepted at sea in safe haven camps, the United States began repatriating them to Cuba. Both parties promised to act in a matter consistent with international obligations and to ensure that no action is taken against those repatriated. U.S. officials would inform repatriated Cubans about procedures to legally immigrate at the U.S. Interests Section in Havana. Those charged with alien smuggling, however, do face prison terms in Cuba.\n\nInterdicted Cubans are given an opportunity to express a fear of persecution if returned to Cuba. Those who meet the definition of a refugee or asylee are resettled in a third country. From May 1995 through July 2003, about 170 Cuban refugees were resettled in 11 different countries, including Spain, Venezuela, Australia, and Nicaragua. The State Department is required to monitor whether those migrants who are returned to Cuba are subject to reprisals.\n\nSince the 1994 migration agreement, the United States has conducted three visa lottery open seasons to implement the Special Cuban Migration Program. The three open seasons were at two-year intervals: Fiscal Year (FY) 1994, FY1996, and FY1998. The number of qualifying registrants has increased each year, from 189,000 in 1994, to 433,000 in 1996 and to 541,000 in 1998. Cubans qualifying through the 1998 lottery are still being paroled into the United States\n\nOnce selected through the lottery, the successful applicants are given parole status with a visa that is good for six months. The medical examination, required of all potential immigrants, is good for one year. Spouses and minor children may accompany the successful registrants. Over the years, there have been reports of barriers the potential Cuban parolees face, such as exorbitantly-priced medical exams, exit visas fees, and repercussions for family members who are sequestered.\n\nA well-publicized incident in June 1999 provoked outrage when the U.S. Coast Guard used pepper spray and a water cannon to prevent six Cubans from reaching Surfside Beach in Florida. A few weeks later, a Cuban woman drowned when a boat capsized during interdiction. Notably in late November 1999, the U.S. Coast Guard opted to bring six-year-old Elián González and two other survivors of an ill-fated journey to the United States rather than taking them to Cuba as the migration agreement provides.\n\nIn July 2003, a dozen people reportedly stole a Cuban-flagged boat from the marina where it was docked in Cuba and kidnapped the three watchmen guarding the marina in the process. When the boat was in international waters allegedly en route to Florida, Coast Guard officials tried to intercept it and reportedly faced violent resistance from the Cubans when they interdicted the vessel. All 15 persons on board were taken to the U.S. Coast Guard cutter and interviewed by a USCIS asylum officer. The three watchmen indicated a desire to return to Cuba. When the Cuban government offered to sentence the 12 persons implicated in crimes (purportedly boat theft, kidnapping, and assaulting federal officers) to 10 years in prison, the United States agreed to return them.\n\nOn January 7, 2006, the Coast Guard found 15 Cubans who had climbed onto a piling on the old Seven Mile Bridge in the Florida Keys. The old bridge had been cut off from land because it was no longer in use and the United States Coast Guard argued that since the refugees could not walk to land, their feet were still \"wet\". The Coast Guard's legal office, in conjunction with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, decided to repatriate the Cubans. The Coast Guard stated that the Cubans \"were determined to be wet-feet and processed in accordance with standard procedure.\" In retaliation to the Cubans being returned, Ramón Saúl Sánchez led a hunger strike against the policy, and on January 18, the White House agreed to meet with Sánchez at some point in the near future. After eleven days, the hunger strike was ended, and Sánchez has yet to meet with White House officials. On February 28, 2007, a federal judge ruled that the United States government had acted unreasonably when it sent home the 15 Cubans. The judge ordered the government to make its best effort to help the immigrants return to the United States. Fourteen of the 15 Cubans re-landed on December 15, 2006 and were given migrant visas.\n\nSince the late-1980s immigration patterns changed. Many Cuban immigrants departed from the southern and western coasts of Cuba and arrived at the Yucatán Peninsula in Mexico; many landed on Isla Mujeres. From there Cuban immigrants traveled to the Texas-Mexico border and found asylum. Many of the Cubans who did not have family in Miami settled in Houston. The term \"dusty foot\" refers to Cubans immigrating to the U.S. through Mexico.\n\nOther migrants arrive in the U.S. crossing the Mona Channel that separates the Dominican Republic from Puerto Rico, the latter being a U.S. Commonwealth. Using smugglers based in the Dominican Republic, migrants make the hazardous journey using rickety fishing boats commonly called \"yolas\" and set foot on Isla de Mona, a small uninhabited island that is part of Puerto Rico. Once on the island, U.S. Coast Guard patrol boats pick up the migrants and transfer them to Aguadilla where they are processed by U.S. immigration.\n\nBeginning with the United States–Cuban Thaw in 2014, anticipation of the end of the wet feet, dry feet policy led to increased numbers of Cuban immigrants. On January 12, 2017, President Barack Obama announced the immediate cessation of the wet feet, dry feet policy. At the same time the Cuban government agreed to accept the return of Cuban nationals.\n\n\n"}

He served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1941 to 1952 as a Liberal-Progressive, and was a cabinet minister in the governments of Stuart Garson and Douglas Campbell.\n\nBorn in Portage la Prairie, Manitoba, the son of Richard Henry Smith and Marion Sarah Marshall, Smith was educated at the University of Manitoba and Oxford University, receiving M.A., LL.B. and B.C.L. degrees. He worked as a barrister, and was also a lecturer at the Manitoba Law School. From 1935 to 1941, he served as an alderman in the City of Winnipeg. Smith was also a member of the O.C. 104th Company, and received the rank of Major in 1941. In 1924, he married Luella Gertrude Lick.\n\nIn the 1941 provincial election, Smith was a star candidate for the Liberal-Progressives in the Winnipeg constituency. During this period, Winnipeg elected ten members via a single transferable ballot. Smith finished third on the first count with 4,955 votes, and was declared elected on the second count following transfers from fellow Liberal-Progressive J.S. McDiarmid. He served as a government backbencher in the parliament which followed.\n\nSmith was re-elected in the 1945 provincial election. He fell to fifth place on the first count, but was elected on the eleventh count following transfers from Paul Bardal, another Liberal-Progressive. On February 15, 1946, he was appointed Minister of Labour in the government of Stuart Garson. When Douglas Campbell became Premier on December 14, 1948, promoted Smith to Minister of Education.\n\nWinnipeg's electoral map was redrawn before the 1949 provincial election, with the single ten-member constituency replaced by three four-member constituencies. Smith ran for re-election in Winnipeg Centre, and was elected on the first count following a first-place finish. On August 16, 1950, he was promoted again to Attorney General of Manitoba.\n\nDespite the party's name, the Liberal-Progressives were further to the right than the other major political parties in Manitoba. CCF leader Lloyd Stinson once described Smith as \"the only genuine liberal in the Campbell cabinet\". There are rumours that Smith came within one vote of defeating Campbell to become leader of the Liberal-Progressive Party, at a private caucus vote held in late 1948.\n\nHe was considered to be a gentlemanly and dignified figure, and as one of the most intelligent members of the house.\n\nHe resigned from the legislature in 1952 to become chair of the Federal Restrictive Trade Practices Commission. A year later, he was named chair of the Canada Labor Relations Board. In 1963, he was appointed Judge of the Court of Queen's Bench of Manitoba. Named to the Manitoba Court of Appeal in 1966, he became its chief justice the following year.\n\nIn 1971, he began working on a comprehensive inquiry for the provincial government of Edward Schreyer, examining the legal and financial development of the Churchill Forest Industries in The Pas. Later in the decade, he chaired a separate inquiry into flooding policies and aboriginal rights in northern Manitoba.\n\nHe died in Winnipeg at the age of 97.\n\nSmith was the father-in-law of Muriel Smith, who was a provincial cabinet minister in the government of Howard Pawley.\n"}
{"id": "1985028", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1985028", "title": "Nitrophorin", "text": "Nitrophorin\n\nNitrophorins are hemoproteins found in the saliva of blood-feeding insects. Saliva of the blood-sucking bug \"Rhodnius prolixus\" contains at least seven homologous nitrophorins, designated NP1 to NP7 in order of their relative abundance in the glands. As isolated, nitrophorins contain nitric oxide (NO) ligated to the ferric heme iron (Fe). Histamine, which is released by the host in response to tissue damage, is another nitrophorin ligand. Nitrophorins transport NO to the feeding site. Dilution, binding of histamine and increase in pH (from pH ~5 in salivary gland to pH ~7.4 in the host tissue) facilitate the release of NO into the tissue where it induces vasodilatation.\n\nThe salivary nitrophorin from the hemipteran \"Cimex lectularius\" (bedbug) has no sequence similarity to \"Rhodnius prolixus\" nitrophorins but is homologous to the inositol-polyphosphate 5-phosphatase (). It is suggested that the two classes of insect nitrophorins have arisen as a product of the convergent evolution.\n\nThe crystal structures of several nitrophorin complexes are known. The \"Rhodnius prolixus\" nitrophorin structures reveal lipocalin-like eight-stranded β-barrel, three α-helices and two disulfide bonds, with heme inserted into one end of the barrel. Members of the lipocalin family are known to bind a variety of small hydrophobic ligands, including biliverdin, in a similar fashion. The heme iron is ligated to histidine residue (His-59). The position of His-59 is restrained through water-mediated hydrogen bond to the carboxylate of aspartic acid residue (Asp-70). The His-59–Fe bond is bent ~15° out of the imidazole plane. Asp-70 forms an unusual hydrogen bond with one of the heme propionates, suggesting the residue has an altered p\"K\". In NP1-histamine structure, the planes of His-59 and histamine imidazole rings lie in an arrangement almost identical to that found in oxidized cytochrome \"b\".\n\nThe fold of nitrophorin from \"Cimex lectularius\" consists of central 11-stranded β-sandwich and seven peripheral α-helices. The heme is positioned between β-sheet and an α-helix, with heme iron ligated to cysteinate residue. NO can bind both to heme Fe and to proximal Cys-60 ligand causing reversible \"S\"-nitrosylation.\n\n"}
{"id": "1985032", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1985032", "title": "KICU-TV", "text": "KICU-TV\n\nKICU-TV, virtual and UHF digital channel 36, branded on-air as KTVU Plus, is an independent television station licensed to San Jose, California, United States and serving the San Francisco Bay Area. The station is owned by the Fox Television Stations subsidiary of Fox Corporation, as part of a duopoly with Oakland-licensed Fox owned-and-operated station KTVU (channel 2). The two stations share studios at Jack London Square in Oakland; KICU-TV's transmitter is located on Monument Peak in Milpitas. There is no separate website for KICU-TV; instead, it is integrated with that of sister station KTVU.\n\nOn cable, KICU-TV is carried on channel 6 on most providers in the market.\n\nThe Federal Communications Commission (FCC) originally assigned the UHF channel 36 allocation in Northern California to Stockton. It was occupied by KTVU (no relation to the present-day Oakland-based sister station of KICU), a short-lived independent station that signed on the air on December 18, 1953. The station carried mainly low-cost, barter syndicated programming and a limited amount of locally produced programs; during its final month of operation in April 1955, KTVU also carried a few NBC programs (including \"Mr. Peepers\", \"My Little Margie\", \"Howdy Doody\" and \"You Bet Your Life\") via simulcast with KRON-TV (channel 4, now a MyNetworkTV affiliate).\n\nAt the time, most television sets did not have built-in UHF tuners; the signal quality of UHF television stations, however, was marginal at best even with an external converter (the FCC did not require electronics manufacturers to equip televisions with UHF tuners until the All-Channel Receiver Act was passed into law in 1961, although UHF tuners were not included on all new sets until 1964). Consequently, as it was hampered by low viewership, (the original) KTVU ultimately ceased operations on April 30, 1955. Shortly afterward, Capital City TV Corp. (owner of independent station KCCC-TV [now Fox affiliate KTXL-TV] in Sacramento) entered into negotiations to purchase KTVU and return it into operation as a satellite station (Capital City also proposed as a backup to move the UHF channel 16 allocation from Red Bluff to the Pittsburg–Antioch area, a proposal that was approved by the FCC on June 8, 1955; however, Capital City TV never formally applied for a construction permit, and the allocation was later reassigned for land mobile telephone use).\n\nOn August 26, 1955, the FCC approved Capital City TV's purchase of KTVU and granted it authorization to resume KTVU's operations that same day; however, ABC refused to grant permission to have its programming be simulcast on KTVU, as its signal overlapped with the network's owned-and-operated station in the Bay Area, KGO-TV (channel 7). Channel 36 never returned to the air and its construction permit was deleted by the Commission less than a year later. The FCC later reassigned the UHF channel 36 allocation to the San Francisco–Oakland–San Jose television market in the early 1960s; Stockton, meanwhile, became part of the Sacramento television market.\n\nKICU-TV first signed on the air on October 3, 1967 as KGSC-TV. It is currently the longest continuously operating commercial UHF television station in the Bay Area, as well as the longest continuously operating independent station in the market. It was originally owned by Continental-Urban Television Corporation. It first operated from studios located on Kerley Drive in San Jose.\n\nFor much of its history, the station's programming schedule consisted mainly of syndicated off-network series, talk shows and religious programs, as well as a limited amount of locally produced public affairs programming. However, as KGSC, Channel 36 was notable for its all-night movie presentations, which were co-hosted for several years during the early 1970s by Andy Moore as prospector Old Sourdough and Gary Ferry as his Native American companion Chief Wachikanoka, characters that Moore and Ferry originated for a similar movie showcase on rival independent KEMO-TV (channel 20, now KOFY-TV) (Moore and Ferry hosted a similar program, as the characters Race Street and Bascom Avenue, until Moore left KGSC in 1973/74). The two characters often made jokes about the movies being showcased (similar to the humor used in \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\"), as well as engaged in comedic banter with guests promoting local businesses. The format would eventually be revised, with the interstitial segments conducted by Moore and Ferry being phased out in favor of a half-hour segment preceding the film.\n\nWhile there were several sets of hosts for the all-night movies, including Eugene Hogan, an experienced emcee who was best known for his work at San Jose radio station KLOK (1170 AM), most of the station's film presentations following Moore's departure from the station were branded as \"Movies 'Til Dawn\" (which was also used by KTLA in Los Angeles for its overnight film telecasts during the 1970s and 1980s), and sponsored by local retailer MMM Carpets, with which Ferry served as its television spokesman until the mid-1990s. The station promoted itself as \"The Perfect 36\" during the 1970s, employing busty San Francisco stripper/entertainer Carol Doda as its spokesmodel for station image promotions; Gloria Aponte-Rodriguez also served as spokesmodel for the \"Latin Weekend Audience\" programming block during the period.\n\nContinental sold the station to Ralph Wilson Enterprises, owned by Detroit businessman Ralph Wilson who also managed the Buffalo Bills NFL franchise in 1979. The station subsequently changed its call letters to KICU-TV (a play on the phrase \"I See You\") on March 27, 1981. the KICU calls had previously been assigned to an independent station on UHF channel 43 (now occupied by Estrella TV affiliate KGMC) in Clovis, which signed on in December 1961 under the ownership of Norwood Patterson (son of Rev. Sherwood Patterson, owner of now-defunct San Francisco-based independent KSAN-TV, channel 32, which operated as a satellite of the Fresno station from 1966 to 1968) and operated until October 1968 (although the license would not be cancelled by the FCC until 1975). The on-air identifications used by the station following the callsign change featured a breathy, husky voiceover by Doda reading: \"I see you, San Francisco. You're watching the perfect 36 ... KICU, San Jose.\" In addition to breathing the station IDs, Doda would also perform the station's editorial segments, which like the IDs were laced with double entendres. The first take of the editorials was always broadcast, with any mistakes made by Doda when they were recorded left in the aired segments.\n\nOver the years, the station ran a number of drama series and older movies; it also added more classic sitcoms and children's programs by the mid-1990s. However, the station gradually decreased the amount of children's programs it carried on its schedule between 1998 and 2002, outside of those it aired on Saturday mornings. In 1992, William Hirshey and three members of the station's management staff—president/general manager Jim Evers, vice president of operations Bill Beeman, and vice president and general sales manager John DuBois—acquired minority ownership stakes in the station, with Ralph Wilson Enterprises retaining majority control.\n\nOn August 28, 1999, after having rejected unsolicited bids to sell the station for the several years, Ralph Wilson Enterprises announced that it would sell KICU-TV. Station management cited the FCC's August 5 decision to relax its ownership rules to allow a single broadcasting company to own two television stations in the same market (on the pretense that one of the stations is not among the four highest-rated) as a caveat in its decision to divest KICU.\n\nAmong the station groups reportedly interested in acquiring KICU was NBC Television Stations, which sought to acquire an owned-and-operated station in the Bay Area after NBC was outbid by Young Broadcasting for longtime NBC affiliate KRON-TV in November 1999, leading to a dispute between the network and Young (which has since merged with Media General) during negotiations to renew NBC's affiliation agreement with KRON that resulted in the latter group declining to renew the contract after it expired on December 31, 2001. NBC would ultimately reach an affiliation deal with San Jose-based WB affiliate KNTV (channel 11), after then-owner Granite Broadcasting Corporation (from which NBC would later acquire KNTV) on February 18, 2000.\n\nOn November 29, 1999, Wilson sold the station to the Cox Broadcasting (now Cox Media Group) subsidiary of Cox Enterprises. The resulting pairing of KICU with KTVU created the Bay Area's first television station duopoly when the deal was finalized in March 2000; the operations of KICU migrated from that station's original studio facilities on Kerley Drive in San Jose, where KTVU relocated its South Bay news bureau, and were consolidated into KTVU's Jack London Square facility in Oakland.\n\nOn June 24, 2014, Fox Television Stations announced that it would acquire KTVU and KICU from the Cox Media Group, in exchange for trading two Fox owned-and-operated stations, WFXT in Boston and WHBQ-TV in Memphis, to the latter group. The trade was completed on October 8, 2014. It was part of Fox's pursuit of station acquisitions in the markets of NFL teams that are part of the National Football Conference—the San Francisco–Oakland–San Jose market, where the San Francisco 49ers are based, became the sixth-largest NFC market where Fox owned at least one television station.\n\nWith the completion of the deal, KICU became the first independent station to be operated by Fox since September 2006, when it converted KDFI in Dallas–Fort Worth into a charter owned-and-operated station of the co-owned MyNetworkTV programming service. , KICU remains the only Fox Television Stations outlet that is not a MyNetworkTV O&O, due to an existing agreement with KRON-TV (channel 4), which has been affiliated with the service since MyNetworkTV launched.\n\nThere remains the possibility that KICU may convert into a MyNetworkTV O&O in the future, either after the service's current affiliation agreement with KRON expires (similar to the situation in Charlotte in which Fox Television Stations purchased WJZY and nullified its affiliation agreement with charter Fox affiliate WCCB), or is given up voluntarily before KRON's agreement with MyNetworkTV lapses. If so, this would make the Bay Area the only American television market in which the stations carrying each of the six broadcast networks (though MyNetworkTV has been a programming service since 2009) are owned by their associated network's respective parent companies.\n\nIn November 2014, when KTVU transitioned from Cox's in-house digital platforms to the WorldNow platform used for Fox Television Stations' websites and mobile apps, KICU discontinued its standalone website, with Fox reducing the station's web presence to a minimalist subpage on the revamped KTVU site, incorporating only listings for KICU and KTVU, FCC-required disclosures for Children's Television Act and employment requirements and forms of contact, and the default \"TMZ on TV\" video portal.\n\nOn April 25, 2016, KICU adopted the \"KTVU Plus\" brand, replacing the \"TV 36\" branding that had been in use since September 2007. The co-branding with sister station KTVU is similar to that adopted in 2009 by San Jose PBS member station KQEH (channel 54), when that station, as a result of its purchase by Northern California Public Broadcasting two years earlier, changed its branding to \"KQED Plus\" to reflect its ties to sister station KQED (channel 9). The \"KTVU Plus\" branding has since inspired Fox to de-emphasis its localized MyNetworkTV brand and rebrand to an extension of their Fox O&O sisters in Dallas, Washington, D.C., Phoenix and Minneapolis/St. Paul.\n\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\nSister station KTVU used to operate its Mobile DTV feed over KICU-TV's digital signal, broadcasting at 1.83 Mbit/s, but later moved the Mobile DTV feed to its own signal. After the move, KICU began to broadcast its own programming over the feed.\n\nKICU-TV shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 36, on February 17, 2009, to conclude the federally mandated transition from analog to digital television. The station's digital signal relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 52, which was among the high band UHF channels (52-69) that were removed from broadcasting use as a result of the transition, to its former analog-era UHF channel 36 for post-transition operations.\n\nSyndicated programs broadcast by KICU-TV include \"Dish Nation\", \"The Big Bang Theory\", \"Modern Family\" and \"TMZ Live\".\n\nOccasionally as time permits, KICU may air Fox network programs normally seen on KTVU in the event that Channel 2 is unable to air them because of extended breaking news coverage or conflicts with Fox Sports event telecasts or locally produced special programming on that station; this was also the case when KTVU aired San Francisco Giants baseball games that ran into or aired during prime time hours, until that station lost the broadcast television rights to the Giants to NBC owned-and-operated station KNTV (channel 11) in 2007. Channel 36 assumed additional backup programming responsibilities in April 2016, when it began to air local newscasts normally seen on KTVU whenever that station is scheduled to air Fox Sports event telecasts that will overflow predeterminedly into the time slot of the given program.\n\nKICU previously aired select NBC programs pre-empted by the network's designated Bay Area affiliates at three separate times throughout its history. After the market's original NBC affiliate, KRON-TV, removed the program from its schedule in July 1998 (in favor of syndicated talk program \"The Howie Mandel Show\"), KICU aired \"Another World\" until the soap opera ended its run on the network in June 1999. Ten years later, after KNTV became the broadcast home of the Giants in 2008, KICU took on the role of airing NBC daytime and prime time programs pre-empted by the NBC-owned station. In April 2010, KRON took over the duties of running NBC programs preempted by KNTV. The duty of being NBC's backup affiliate in the Bay Area in the event that KNTV broadcasts Giants games and breaking news coverage reverted over to KICU in 2012. However, as of 2014, it is unlikely that preempted NBC programming will air on KICU due to its ownership by the corporate parent of competing network Fox; NBC O&O KNTV currently uses its Cozi TV-affiliated second digital subchannel to carry network programs in such situations. \n\nDuring the station's ownership tenures under Ralph Wilson Enterprises and Cox Enterprises, KICU-TV maintained a strong association with Bay Area sports. Perhaps with the exception of the San Francisco Giants of Major League Baseball, the NFL's San Francisco 49ers and the now-defunct San Jose Lasers of the American Basketball League, each of the city's major professional sports franchises, along with several local college and high school teams, have had their games televised on Channel 36.\n\nIn the spring of 1985, KICU obtained the broadcast rights to carry NBA games involving the Golden State Warriors, beginning with the 1985–86 season. The station initially aired up to 70 preseason and regular season games per season, some of which were broadcast on tape delay beginning in the late 1990s; the number of Warriors games aired on Channel 36 decreased to 30 per season after the 1997–98 season, when the team renewed its cable agreement with regional sports network SportsChannel Bay Area (later FSN Bay Area, now NBC Sports Bay Area), with KICU also passing a limited number of additional games over to KTVU following Cox's 1999 purchase of KICU. The Warriors' relationship with KICU ended after the 2001–02 season, when the team moved its local broadcasts exclusively to Fox Sports Net Bay Area through the signing of a ten-year deal with the cable channel.\n\nOn October 28, 1998, KICU-TV acquired the rights to broadcast Major League Baseball games from the Oakland Athletics, after the team exercised a clause in its existing five-year television contract with KRON-TV to shop the rights to other Bay Area television outlets following the 1998 regular season. Under the initial deal in which it became the team's broadcast television flagship, which began with the 1999 season, Channel 36 offered an expanded schedule of 55 regular season games, 25 more than what KRON was able to offer within its schedule due to difficulties with its programming obligations with NBC (all other A's games that were not televised nationally aired in the market on now-defunct Fox Sports Bay Area).\n\nDuring the first year of the contract, KICU carried all of the team's afternoon games on tape delay on a trial basis, to allow viewers who were at work while the game was being played the opportunity to watch it that evening. However, due to viewer complaints (particularly since play-by-play audio of the games that KICU televised could be heard on radio live, although A's director of broadcasting Ken Pries noted to the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" that the team had reservations about allowing the telecasts to be tape-delayed beforehand), the station switched to airing all A's telecasts, regardless of when they were held, live-to-air in May 1999. After it was purchased by Cox, the duopoly of KICU and KTVU, which held the over-the-air rights to the Giants, essentially had exclusive control of the local broadcast television contracts to both of the Bay Area's MLB teams; this lasted until Channel 2 lost the rights to the Giants to NBC owned-and-operated station KNTV following the 2007 season. KICU subsequently lost the rights to the Athletics after the 2009 season, when the team signed an exclusive television deal with Comcast SportsNet California (now NBC Sports California).\n\nThe station also was a longtime broadcaster of National Hockey League games featuring the San Jose Sharks from the team's inaugural season in 1991 until FSN Bay Area took over as the Sharks' exclusive local television broadcaster following the 2000–01 season. The station also carried Major League Soccer games involving the San Jose Clash (now the San Jose Earthquakes) from the team's inaugural season in 1996 until FSN Bay Area took over the local rights following the 2000–01 season, and the San Jose SaberCats Arena Football League franchise from that team's inaugural season in 1998 until FSN Bay Area assumed the local television rights to the team following the 2000–01 season.\n\nFrom 1991 until the program's cancellation in 2008, the station also aired the sports highlight program \"High School Sports Focus\" on Friday nights at 11:00 p.m. (which was rebroadcast on Sundays at 4:00 p.m.), which covered high school sports events throughout the Bay Area with a primary focus on events involving Santa Clara County area schools; the program won several Regional Emmy Awards throughout its 18-year run. In addition, after FSN Bay Area shut down in 2008, KICU occasionally served as a backup Fox Sports Net affiliate, carrying select California Bears basketball and football games to which FSN holds rights through its contract with the Pacific-10 Conference.\n\nOn April 24, 2017, KTVU relocated the rain-delayed Food City 500 to KICU, marking the first time a Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series race has been broadcast on the station. This occurred again the next year on April 16, 2018 with the 2018 running of the same race.\n\n, KTVU presently produces 10 hours of locally produced newscasts each week for KICU (with two hours each weekday); KICU does not carry newscasts on Saturdays or Sundays. In addition, the station airs the KTVU-produced program \"Bay Area People\", which is rebroadcast Sundays at 9:00 a.m.\n\nIn 1986, KICU-TV debuted a half-hour early evening newscast at 7:30 p.m., called \"Action 36 News\", the first newscast on a commercial television station in the market to have aired in the prime access time period. The program was eventually moved to 10:00 p.m. in 1988, placing it in direct competition with eventual sister station KTVU's higher-rated prime time newscast \"The 10 o'clock News\". The newscast was anchored for several years by former KPIX-TV (channel 5) sports anchor Jan Hutchins and Bay Area news veteran Ysabel Duron; the station's reporting staff included among others Bill Buckmaster, Tony Russomanno and Melanie Morgan. During its first three years in the later slot, \"Action 36 News at Ten\" was accompanied at 10:30 p.m. by the nationally syndicated \"Independent Network News\", which was produced by fellow independent station WPIX (now a CW affiliate) in New York City, until both programs were cancelled in June 1990. KICU revived its news department in 1992, with the debut of \"Action 36 Prime News\", an early evening local newscast at 7:00 p.m. that aired seven nights a week; this program was cancelled in 1994. In 1995, the station began producing the technology-focused business news program \"Silicon Valley Business This Week\", which aired until 1999. \n\nAfter being acquired by Cox Enterprises, sister station KTVU began simulcasting its flagship newscast on KICU. In January 2000, the station began airing a rebroadcast of \"The Ten O'Clock News\" immediately following its initial broadcast on KTVU each night at 11:00 p.m., under the title \"The Eleven O'Clock Edition of the Original Ten O'Clock News\" (the \"Original\" branding was used during that period to differentiate from other prime time newscasts that aired in that hour a few years prior on KRON-TV and CBS station KPIX-TV—both of which pushed their network evening schedules one hour early in August 1992, in an attempt to improve prime time viewership and to compete with KTVU—as well as a KNTV-produced program that aired on KBWB-TV (channel 20, now KOFY-TV) at the time); the simulcast was dropped from the schedule on September 14, 2001. From 2001 to 2003, KICU also aired a simulcast of KTVU's morning newscast \"Mornings on 2\" each Monday through Friday from 7:00 to 9:00 a.m., with the station inserting a ticker featuring traffic and weather information, news briefs and breaking news stories specific to the South Bay region.\n\nKTVU restored news programming to Channel 36's schedule on January 21, 2008, when that station began producing the half-hour \"Bay Area News at 7 on TV 36\", airing at 7:00 p.m. each weeknight. The rebroadcast of \"The Ten O'Clock News\" was restored onto KICU's schedule on April 5, 2010, being shown this time at 11:30 p.m. each weeknight; the rebroadcast reverted to the 11:00 p.m. slot it held during its original run on KICU on July 1, 2013.\n\nConcurrent with the station's rebranding under the \"KTVU Plus\" moniker on April 25, 2016, in addition to retaining the late rebroadcast of \"The Ten O'Clock News\", KICU expanded its 7:00 p.m. newscast to one hour. KTVU also began producing an hour-long extension of \"Mornings on 2\" for Channel 36; the newly added 10:00 a.m. hour of \"Mornings on 2\" extended the weekday editions of the program to a combined seven hours between the two stations (alongside the existing six-hour broadcast which precedes it on KTVU).\n\n\n"}
